"WORD UP WITH GARTH re you a saddy? 'Course not there are no sad people in the world of computer games (except some of the people who still own a Spectrum bor a Vic 20). So why do we keep getting attacked by the newspapers, consumer watchdog groups, Tory MP's and the like? Well, I can now exclusively reveal to you the reason. It's becuase they're all crumbly old bum burps who are too old to understand computer games and so are currently cacking themselves because we enjoy spending our spare time playing games. The next time some old git tells you that playing games is the scourge of kids today, why don't you remind them about the problems associated with the older generation lung cancer, alcoholism, wife battering, being extremely boring and wearing really sad suits with pukey ties. And so onto this month's pulsating CVG. The biggest game this month just has be Final Fight on the MegaCD. It's hotter than a deckchair attendant on Venus and means that now is the time to buy your MegaCD so you can slot in a top game. Add to that the other forty odd reviews in the magazine, the second tips bookle and the fact that this issue is bursting with up-to-the-minute news from the (non-crumbly) world of games and you just know that you can't lose! See yah GARTH CVG CREW NEWS... CVG CREW IN XENOBOT KICKABOUT MALARKY! Oh dear! We thought that we'd proved that computer games didn't numb the intelligence of the average gamesplayer, the CVG boys managed to go out and show themsleves out to be very sad men. The boys suddenly decided that it was too nice a day to stay indoors playing with their top-notch computer games so they decided to play computer games outside instead! Garthy, Rand, Mr Whitta, Anglin, Steve and Jon all piled out onto the street to find that there were no electrical sockets for them to plug their consoles into. Garth then made one of his stranger editorial decisions \"We don't need computers to play games! We made our own entertainment in my day!\" \"Huh?\" said Whitta, \"He's finally gone senile.\" \"Let's play Xenobots, 'cos it's brill man\" said Keeny. So here they are. Siz terminally sad men trying to play Xenobots without the aid of a computer. A spokesman for grown-ups (Lord EMAP) said of the CVG crew, \"Thish shurely shows the harm of playing games without computers for the mentally disadvataged.\" Lord EMAP is 82. "


"Chris and Violet stare on in bewilderment at the incredible gaming talents. MEET THE CVG CREW: GARTH Crumbly editor Garth has been putting in lots more late nights to ensure that CVG was ready and waiting for you when you popped down to the shops to buy it this month, but in-between time he still found the opportunity to get kicked in the chest by a horse and not know how to spell Sonic. What a great guy! (Mr Whitta you're sacked! -ED) GAMES OF THE MONTH: Alien 3 (SNES), Final Fight (Mega-CD) Garth takes the lead Hurrah! We can't believe it either! RENA When we asked Paul what he'd been up to this month, he replied \"Nowt\" and started to swear at us. Actually, this terrible behavoir was because it was a Bank Holiday Monday and he, like the rest of us mugs, were all slaving away on the magazine. We would all much rather have been at home watching the racing and eating big bits of cake. And then eating more big bits of cake. GAMES OF THE MONTH: Royal Rumble WWF2 (SNES), Goal (Amiga) UKSEGA GAMES CHAMPIONSHIPS GARY Gary wrote something really nice about himself to go here, but the CVG crew feel you should be told how horrible he really is. Gary said goodbye to his mummy and daddy one Saturday morning (he lives with them because he says his mom's dead soft and spoils him rotten), and didn't return home until Monday. In the meantime, Garth had phoned, his house and told his mum what Whitta had said. When he got back, he got the thick ear he richly deserved! GAMES OF THE MONTH: Super Strike Eagle (SNES), Final Fight (Mega-CD) Invitations for top notch events pour into the CVG office faster than Princess Di runs into MacDonald's with a book of Luncheon Vouchers! But few bashes are as prestigious as the recent 1993 Sega Championships. The incredible event was held at the Williams Formula One Team Headquarters, where 16 teenagers, whittled down from 3000, fought it out on a variety of games for the title of 1993 Sega UK Champion! The event was hosted by The Big Breakfast's top geezer Chris Evans and Bad Influence's vivacious Violet Berlin, with a special appearance from the William's team Formula One racer Damon Hill, who was helicoptered in especially for the event. The 18 and under category was won by Karl Roberts, from Port Talbot, and the 12 and under title was snatched by Alan Son, from Chelmsford Essex. The guys also stalked off with a VIP pass to Donington, a Mega CD and Damon's signed racing helmet! Our own Ed, Garthy, queued up with 13 other game-hardened computer jouros for the special UK Magazine challenge and managed to notch up 9,900,650 on Devil Crash in just over 10 minutes, claiming third place on the winners podium! A great day and a lorra laffs were had by all those invited!! JON Our boy Billington has been heartbroken by CVG's Jenny our very own pin-up designer and has been indulging in several romantic trips to the seaside with lovely ladies to try to take his mind off her departure. But sadly, it's all been to no avail. He's also been playing cards with some rather unusual forfeits to be payed by the loser and so far he's lost every game. GAMES OF THE MONTH: Goal! (Amiga), X-Men (Megadrive) DODO remember, left and right buttons operate the flippers, Garth! STEVE Steve Keen's bit is always the hardest to write, since no one's ever been able to find out what he gets up to after work. All we know is that he frequently comes in in the morning in the same clothes as the previous night, looks very tired indeed and has CLUB RAVE stamped onto his forehead in ink. And then he spends the whole day asleep at his desk. We'd normally ask Garth to give him a stiff talking to, but he's always asleep as well (although you can't tell because he keeps his eyes open). GAMES OF THE MONTH: Night Trap (Mega-CD), Tuff Enuff (SNES) SE Sega's giant video wall let the spectators get right up on the action. ANGLIN Poor old Anglin is still going through that curious age when strange things start sprouting up on his body and he gets all hot and sweaty from time to time. Perhaps this is why, after reading newspaper reports that Sega's Night Trap was pornographic and disgusting, he locked himself in the games room with the disks for the entire afternoon. The sooner his hormones sort themselves out the better. GAMES OF THE MONTH: Night Trap (Mega-CD), Night Trap (Mega-CD), DE SECA OSES STEVE Steve's the important one who makes all the top decisions and is so powerful he can even tell Garth what to do! He's so far resisted the temptation to use this power to make Garth jump in front of a speeding train, but we reckon it's only a matter of time. Apart from that, Steve has spent the month mucking in with the rest of us lads, and even came, in over the Bank Holiday to make sure everyone knew what they were doing. Which is more than our ugly, publisher did. GAMES OF THE MONTH: X-Men (Megadrive), Superfrog (Amiga) Above: Journos start straining their shorts before the big challenge! Right: A few of the challengers and an NMS scruffbag called Rad. "

"PAD-TASTIC! DREAM ON O QUICK SHOTO 081 365 1993 CYBERDREAMS 071 326 3267 fter last month's scintillating news about joypads, you'll no doubt be besides yourself with excitement at the revelation that Quickshot is releasing EVEN MORE Megadrive joypads The two new models soon to be setting light to shop shelves all across the country are the interestinglynamed Starfighter 3B and Invader 3. At .99 the Invader is the big one with all the extra buttons (autofire, slomo etc), and the Starfighter is the cheaper (.99) more bog-standard model. So, if your joypad breaks or you fancy a change, go and buy one, or something. Sorry, but it's very difficult to get very excited about this sort of thing. called No Mouth written by loony horror novelist Harlan Ellison. And what's more, the UK office of Cyberdreams has just been taken over by Mark Scriven, who used to work here at EMAP, so he'll no doubt be seeing us right with exclusives and stuff. Isn't that right, Mark? ff-the-wall American softco Cyberdreams has got an wacky game in the pipeline and like Darkseed before it, there's a top name from the world of science fiction attached to it. While Alien creator HR Giger produced the bizarre graphics for the adventure Darkseed, sci-fi man Syd Mead, who worked on movies like Star Trek, Blade Runner and Tron, is working on CyberRace, a \"revolutionary\" 3D combat and racing sim set in the far future. It's expected to be very Wing Commader-ish, with lots of ray-traced graphics and cinematic sequences.

Rage Software has just started work on Striker 2, but that's all there is to know at the moment. \"It'll be a bit special, that one,\" says Rage's Paul Finnegan... A QUICK correction for you.

MEGADRIVE CHART GARTH: \"RoboCop would obviously win because he's got a gun built into his leg, while The Terminator hasn't even got any clothes on half the time!\" WHITTA: \"The Terminator would win easily because he's ROCK hard, and RoboCop gets duffed up all the time. And he's got stupid lips. Wait a mo...what am I talking about?\" It's one to watch in '93, so Virgin Games is REALLY pushing the boat out for its new Megadrive game, Cool Spot. Not only have they enlisted rising pop group The Chosen Ones to promote the game, but they also spent rather a lot of money on free shandy and sherbert at the game's official launch, held at the European Computer Trade Show last month. Free sunglasses (like those worn by Spot in the game) were doled out, and despite Virgin marketing guru Sean \"Unfunny\" Brennan's deeply offensive jibe about the brilliant Tottenham Hotspur, we thought it was by far the best free booze-up we'd had all day.

"NELS TRIKER kicks off on Sega formats... NEW Megadrive and Mega CD unveiled... SEAGAL licence revealed... TOTAL CARNAGE comes to a machine near you, PLUS the ECTS show in all its glory.... HARD TO KONVERT SEGA STRIKER! O TECMAGIKO 071 243 2878 0 O SEGA 071 373 3000 O Rage Software's smash hit soccer game Striker will be appearing on all major Sega formats this August — the same time as the much-hyped Super NES version! Hecmagik has added a new star name to its list of licences joining Andre Agassi in the company's lineup is action film megastar Steven Seagal, who will be appearing in a Super NES beat'em-up early next year. Live action video footage is being used to create ultra-lifelike animation for the ponytailed hardman. Not only that but Tecmagik has just signed a big deal with Sony, who seem to be buying everything these days. Blimey. TOTAL CARNAGE! O ICE O 0453 756993 0 long with Sensible Soccer, Striker was one of last year's two top Amiga footy games. Rage has been busily beavering away on the SNES version (to be released by Elite), but we've been given a sneak preview of Sega's Megadrive version (also by Rage), and, by crikey, it's looking even better! As expected, the Master System and Game Gear versions are almost identical to one another, using a Kick Off-style birds-eye view rather than the trickier 3D perspective seen in the 16-bit versions. But all the main features are in there, and Game Gear owners will be able to link together for two-player games. Set for release on all three formats on August 2nd, we can't wait to find out is which version will play better Megadrive or Super NES! CE Software, best known for its military shoot 'em-up Fireforce, has just snapped up the licence to the Smash TV \"sequel\", Total Carnage!

"WN OF SEX OWER As Spring gives way to Summer, it's time to say goodbye to another European Computer Trade Show. Us CVGites love the show for the latest video games and hardware, because (a) it takes place just around the corI ner in Islington, (b) all our great software mates buy Tus lots of free beer and food and (c) it's a trade-only I show, so grotty little urchins like you can't get in. Having just returned from three solid days of signing up exclusives and doing top business deals, however, we're far too exhausted to write very much about the show, so we thought we'd let the snaps taken by our roving photographer speak for themselves. Enjoy... Phwoar! This was one of the more interesting products on display at the show. Rest assured, the CVG boys will be reviewing it as soon as they can get a copy... Look, here's Alfred Chicken from Mindscape plugging a new game. The all-star cast just keeps on coming. James Pond always manages to make it to these shows. Watch where you're pointing that thing, pal! QUICK NOTES NEW MEGADRIVE AND CD UNVEILED! DIGITAL Image Design, the top 3D team behind Epic and RoboCop 3, have just signed a SEVEN FIGURE deal with their long-time publishers Ocean. The deal covers DID's in-development sequels to Epic and F-29 Retaliator and beyond... JOURNALISTS from rival publishers Future have recently left the company to set up their own software label. Andy Smith and Bob Wade's company is called Asylum, and they hope to be releasing their first product on Amiga very soon and we'll review it for them. GREMLIN has just signed a deal with big-time licencing company PSL to produce a string of merchandise based on its chart-topping character Zool. So, expect to see no end of posters, greetings cards, cuddly toys and other Zool-esque gimmicks coming your way soon... The new look Megadrive 2 and MegaCD 2, which now bolts onto the side of the console. And look there's a mouse as well! CODEMASTERS has finally (and rather sensationally) WON its epic court battle with Nintendo, who have been trying to get the Darling brothers' Game Genie gadget off the shelves for years. The US Supreme Court ruled that Nintendo didn't have a case, so the cartridge for cheats will stay on sale AND the Codies get a walloping load of cash in damages to boot... Designed to wipe the smile of the faces of rival hardware manufacturers, the Megadrive 2 and new-look Mega CD model will no doubt be well advertised and stocked nationwide. If you're currently thinking of getting a Mega CD you might be advised to take our top-notch advice below. -QWHI REPEAT TO FADE Famous reviewing Famous reviewing ! cliches that CVG has (almost) managed to abolish over the years, but can still be found earning a respectacle living in other magazines. 1. \"They told us it was going to be good, but no-one prepared us for this!\" 2. \"This game should come with a government health warning!\" 13. \"it's brilliantly simple and simply brilliant!\" 14. No self-respecting gamer should be without it!\" 15. «Excuse me now, but I'm just off for another go...\" 16. \"Beg, buy or borrow a copy today!\" 17. \"It's got that just-one-more-go appeal!\" he Megadrive is dead long live the Megadrive 2! Sega has at long last taken the wraps off the new versions of its flagship console, and these are the first pictures! Both the Megadrive and the bolt-on Mega-CD machines have been redesigned inside smaller, sexier cases, which means the new machines will be much cheaper when they're launched over here in October. The Megadrive 2 will cost just , while the Mega CD will set you back  nearly  cheaper than the current model. Technology-wise, the machines remain exactly the same it's only the outer design that's changed. Nice as they are, the new models could well annoy buyers of the existing Mega-CD unit, which has only been on sale for a month or so at . No more Mega-CD \"1\"s are being produced, in preparation for the new model, so if you're after a CD unit, you might be best advised to wait until October or pick up an end-of-line bargain as shops try to clear their old stocks.

IT GLOBAL GLAD PUTER ANS THE BIGGEST AND ERST COMES ALIC IN THE WORLD 1164 PACKED PAGES COMPU 17DEO GA VES,24 END 0 15,2% FIRST LOOK SEOA STAR WARS 4 DKWAM HOLIDAYI In between breaks in filming The Crunch, Zig and Zag like nothing more than to relax with a copy of CVG. What excellent taste! WIN AN AMERICAN ER PULL OLT HAR CELEBRITY throughout the years that CVG has issued its gaming challenges to hopeful gamesplayers everywhere, our crack team of video warriors has taken on the very best and vanquished them, one by one. All across the globe there is a trail of once-proud gaming gladiators who have long since been cut down to size by the all-powerful might of the CVG boys. But this leaves us with one slight problem. We've beaten everyone this planet has to offer, so where do we go from here? The answer is simple-outer space! For the second of our all-new Celebrity Challenges, we decided that the only force capable of taking us on lay beyond the stars, and we were able to get hold of two real live (and extremely famous) space aliens none other than Zig and Zag from Channel 4's The Big Breakfast! Not only are they genuine extra-terrestrials, hailing from the faraway planet Zog, but they're also bona fide games experts, using their talents on the toprated breakfast show's Masterblaster reviews slot. The two prepubescent Zogians were only too pleased to take up our challenge, and seemed fairly confident of victory. \"CVG, CVG, CVG are games girlies!\" they chanted after we threw down the gauntlet, so we selected our warriors Gary Whitta and Paul Rand, back after last month's shock defeat by Nigel Benn and packed them off to The Big Breakfast's secret London location to meet their challengers... We've made CVG history this month with our first ever double challenge. It was decided that Paul would take on Zig, while Gaz faced Zag, because their names are the same backwards (brilliant, eh?). The challenge game was to be excellent Super MarioKart, a big lunchtime hit with the CVG boys, and the choice seemed to be particularly welcomed by Zag who, on hearing the news exclaimed \"Victory shall be ours, it shall, it shall, it shall! Our super simmering alien fingers are flexed to fight, let's plug this baby in and get gaming!\" Zig, however, wasn't as sure as his partner-in-crime. \"What's for tea?\" was the most aggressive thing he could think of to say. The gang's all here! A dream is realised for Zig and Zag and Gaz and Rand as they finally get to meet each other's idols! 24 "


"The challenge is on, and things are already going badly for Gaza RIUM GHOST HOUSE 1 Disaster for CVG! Whitta crashes out on the Ghost House and is forced to eat his joypad... MARIO CIRCUIT 1 technical hitch almost aborted the challenge before it began when the TV monitor would only work in black and white. We were told that this was due to special space signals sent out by Zag's ears interfering with the picture, but both competitors agreed to play in monochrome and the challenge was on! Gaz selected Koopa Trooper as his driver, while Zag opted for the mushroom-like Toad. \"Let's get this Toad on the road, buster!!\" he exclaimed bullishly. Disaster struck for the hopeless Whitta early in the first race when he over-rewed at the start line and Zag was able to clear the pack and take an early lead! Three laps later and a succession of lucky pick-ups had allowed Whitta to gain on Zag, but he screeched off the track near the final turn to let the surprisingly proficient Zag take the tape while Gaz had to settle for a measly third place. FIRST ROUND RESULTS ZAG (1st) TOTAL: 9 POINTS 41 am the Kart king, no doubt about it young man!\" WHITTA (3rd) TOTAL: 3 POINTS \"Where did a space alien learn to drive a go-kart like that?!\" s both competitors went into the final round, they knew that the match was still for the taking either way. After taking a break for some special Zogian orange juice, Zag bounced back with a burst of extra energy-unlike Whitta, who seemed to have had the wind knocked out of his sails. But into the final round they went and, surprisingly, it was Whitta who had the upper hand early in the race, using a pick-up invincibility Star to roar ahead of the pack again. But Zag was not to be outdone and stayed hot on Whitta's heels for most of the race. So it stayed right into the final lap when Whitta, confident of victory, turned into the final straight only to disover to his horror that Zag, right behind him, had picked up a red shell! The homing missile was delivered with frightening accuracy, spinning Whitta just before the finish line and letting Zag scream past for first place! Ultimately defeated, Whitta crawled over the line for a measly second place. Doh! DONUT PLAINS 1 HA ) Zag is taken aback as Whitta pulls back a vital victory on the Donut Plains! before resorting to violence and throttling his opponent! GAZ (2nd) TOTAL: 18 POINTS \"I do not belieeeeeeve it!\" ZAG (1st) TOTAL: 24 POINTS \"There's only one ZAG from ZOG, there's only one ZAG from ZOO0OOG!\" W ith Whitta already reeling from his shock first-round obliteration, Zag jumped up and down with excitement and boasted confidently that this course was his favourite. \"What a dunking good round this is!\" he said, as the cars lined up on the grid. But Gaz showed no fear; he knuckled down and within the first two laps was clear in front, with Zag stuck in a pathetic fifth place so much for his favourite track! But while Gaz drove even further ahead of the field in a startling performance, Zag battled back brilliantly into the scoring positions and finally into second, but still a good six seconds behind Whitta, who broke his own personal track record. Now the challenge was really on! SECOND ROUND RESULTS GAZ (1st) TOTAL: 12 POINTS «And now we've got a game!\" ZAG (2nd) TOTAL: 15 POINTS \"Don't count your Marios till they've hatched, Mr Smarmy Trousers. Victory shall be mine-next round now!\" Sensationally, the alien Zag had destroyed our Whitta 24 points to 18, and before our man could demand that the Zogian orange juice be tested for steroids, Zag nipped off for lunch, leaving the only hopes for mankind resting in the hands of Paul Rand in the next round. Defeated last month, could he turn the tables on the aliens now? NOW TURN OVER TO SEE PART 2 PAUL VERSUS ZIG! 25 "


"SER AND COMPUTS LUG CHALLENGE FUB CELEBRITY DEO GAS VERSUS -TWOROUN We're back after the halftime break! And the question about the last clip was... Round One and Rand stamps his authority on the game in style! Poor old Zig is left speechless! (for once). MARIO CIRCUIT 1 ! hey knew the stakes. After the utter humiliation of Whitta by Zag in the first part of the Challenge, everyone knew that Paul Rand held the last hope for CVG as he sat down for part two of the battle, against Zig. Could the pair of bungling aliens from The Big Breakfast really take on the might of CVG and win? The idea seemed inconceivable, but Zag had taken them halfway to victory, and now Paul's only hope was to defeat Zig and scrape a draw. Zig, however, knew that if he won, he and Zag could travel back to their home planet Zog bathed in glory. \"I hate baths, thanks very much,\" he was heard to say just before diving into the challenge. But there was nothing more to say. With Whitta still crying in the corner about his defeat, Paul took to the challenge settee next to Zig, who seemed just a little nervous about the responsibility that now lay on his shoulders. But Rand too looked equally uneasy could it be that he was still shaken psychologically by last month's challenge defeat? There was only one way to find out. Lads, grab those joypads AND GET DOWN TO BUSINESS! D oth grasping their joypads with sweating hands (here Paul discovDered that Zogian sweat is five times smellier than the earth variety pew!), Zig and Rand began part two of this monster challenge. This time it was Paul who picked Toad; \"If it worked for that purple dork, it can work for me\", while Zig chose Bowser \"because he's just a wikkle puppy wuppy dog and I love him\". As the race began Zag was discouraged from coaching Zig from the sidelines by Whitta placing a carrier bag over his head. \"Mmm-mm-mm\" he protested, but it was to no avail. The race was already underway, with Rand well in the lead and Zig, still trying to master the controls, floundering in seventh after one lap. From there on it was easy pickings for the CVG boy, who finally crossed the line in first place, despite an unfortunate collision with a Super Luigi, with Zig limping in sixth. Zag had by this time removed his bag and had this constructive piece of advice to offer Zig: \"You'd better pluck up your gaming plans, young man. A Glibble from the planet Flob could've done better, and they don't even have arms!\" FIRST ROUND RESULTS PAUL (1st) TOTAL: 9 POINTS \"Alien or not, you're no match for me!\" ZIG (7th) TOTAL: 0 POINTS \"Which one was I again?\" 26 "


"But no! Just when all seemed lost for the alien duo, Zig comes back brilliantly with a superb run! Rand's disgruntlement is all too clear, s in the first challenge, only three points separated the two drivers going into the final round, but this time it was CVG that had the advantage. A good performance here would seal the draw, but Zig was under immense pressure from his purple pal to repeat last round's miracle run. \"Come on Zig, don't let poncy Paul win\" was Zag's advice before the flag went up. With both drivers near the front of the grid, they were able to accelerate away from the pack, and before the first lap was over the fascinated crowd of Big Breakfast observers knew it would be a two-horse race all the way. And so it was, with Paul leading most of the way until Zig stumbled across a Star pickup and was able to whizz past the ginger whinger! It looked as though Zig was going to clinch it until he got too cocky, tried to take a corner on the final lap too fast and barrelled into the fence! In the time it took him to turn and get back on course, Paul had overtaken and won the race! 2 DONUT PLAINS 1 full nine points in the lead, Rand knew he was in the driving seat in more ways that one. Zig's inexperience was showing through, as was Zag's disgruntlement, as he stormed off to the kitchen to sulk and eat an entire packet of chocolate Hob Nobs in one go. Meanwhile it was onto Round Two and Zig, positioned at the back of the starting grid, suddenly seemed to find his feet (not easy as no-one's ever seen them) and race into third position as the race got underway. Rand, meanwhile, had got caught in the pack between Kong and Luigi, and was having problems breaking free. Eventually he barged his way through and caught up with Zig a ding-dong battle ensued, which ended with Zig miraculously forcing Paul off the track and roaring into the first place. Cursing his luck, Rand rallied well and came back, but it was too late and Zig had already crossed the finish line to win the race. But for Rand, third place just wasn't good enough, and the second round result had narrowed his victory margin dramatically. Zig could hardly contain himself and do you blame him? Zig resorts to the age-old *there's some thing wrong with my joy pad ploy, but it's all over! Zig's disastrous thirdcound perfor mance secures a draw for the world's greatest games mag! GHOST HOUSE 1 AND THE WINNER IS. SECOND ROUND RESULTS FINAL RESULTS PAUL (3rd) TOTAL: 12 POINTS PAUL (1st) TOTAL: 21 POINTS \"I knew that boss-eyed bozo didn't have the stay\"It's a fix! Ref! Ref!\" ing power!\" ZIG (1st) TOTAL: 9 POINTS \"Where's the loo? Where's the loo? ZIG (2nd) TOTAL: 15 POINTS \"Oops, sorry Zag!\" It was a draw. Gaz the buffoon comI pletely fluffed his challenge and let Zag walk away with it, but Rand pulled out all the stops to make up for it and won his battle against the inexperienced Zig. So it was a one-all draw on rounds under these circumstances we would normally let the points margin decide, but incredibly BOTH victors won six points clear, so there really wasn't anything to decide between the two. We suggested a scissor-paperstone competition as a tiebreaker, but Zig and Zag pointed out that they don't have scissors, paper OR stones on Zog so they didn't understand the rules and we had to abandon the whole thing. But it was the alien duo who were to have the final word: \"We shall return to conquer the CVG team, and next time! will put some effort into it,\" said Zag. \"I mean I only played half my usual gamepower, I didn't want you girly-boys to Aah, thals nice.no hard feelings at the end of the day. Zag and Paul can walk look too bad.\" \"Yeah, next time we'll away in pride, bureaz and Zig (right) have got some serious explaining to do... be in your FACE,\" added Zig. \"By the way, there's no loo roll...\" YOU CAN SEE ZIG AND ZAG EVERY WEEKDAY MORNING ON THE BIG BREAKFAST (AROUND 7:20) ON CHANNEL 4 "


"WORLD EXCLUSIVE! WORLD FYCL SENSENSUSKAS * ** Crash! Through the window of the throne room and the adventure begins! ne of the most successful and best-loved games of all time returns to your screens this Summer bigger, better and with more swashbuckling action than ever before! Gary Whitta lifts the lid on the year's most eagerly-awaited sequel Prince of Persia 2... GARY WHITTA and GARTH SUMPTER in Irince Csa The Shadow And The Flame When young programmer Jordan Mechner first wrote Prince of Persia for the crusty old Apple II back in 1989, everybody in America thought it was a flop-even two years later, when it appeared on the PC, it never made it into the software hit parade. It looked as though eighteen months of Jordan's hard labour was about to go down the drain without anyone noticing, but when the floppy versions came across the Atlantic to the UK on the Domark label later that year, something very strange happened people stood up and took notice. In fact, it caused an overnight sensation. \"Best Animation Ever!\" \"Platform Game of the Year!\" \"It's Like Playing a Film!\" the praise just kept on coming. Since then, the swashbuckling Arabian Jordan Mechner, Nights-style s programmer: \"I'd always adventure has hoped there'd be a sequel\". been converted to just about every home format imaginable, from the Super NES to the Apple Macintosh and Game Boy and at long last it's been a hit in America as well as across Europe. 28 "


"ISIVE! WORLD EXCLUSIVE! WORLD EXCLUS A PRINCE AMONG GAMES What was it that made the original such an instant classic? Well, it was the incredible animation that first caught people's attention the main character ran, fought and leaped like a real live action movie hero! But it wasn't all gimmicks, and it was the classy gameplay that kept people hooked once the graphic novelty wore off. Inspired by the classic action/adventure movies of silver screen heroes like Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Jnr, Jordan set out to create a game with the same Up the steps to the next level! says Jordan. \"Of course, for the first couple of years the sales of the game were unspectacular so it was difficult to get anybody very excited about the idea. But I always had a sequel in the back of my mind. While I was writing the original, I kept a folder for all the ideas that I wasn't able to put into the game. By the time the game was finished, the folder had gotten pretty fat!\" cliffhanging, swashbuckling atmosphere and he succeeded. With crumbling ledges suspended over razor-sharp spikes, deadly potions and swordfighting skeletons lurking around every corner, Prince of Persia captured players' imaginations and, for the first time, actually felt like playing a film! The only problem is, most people agree that the game hasn't aged that well over the years. What the public need now is a sequel! SOME DAY MY PRINCE WILL COME \"So,\" everybody's been asking for the last eighteen months, \"when's Prince of Persia 2 coming out, then?\" It may have been the question on everybody's lips, but POP publishers Broderbund and their new-found pals at Electronic Arts have been keeping tightlipped about the ultra-secret \"The graphics are a quantum leap forward from the original game.\" Jordan Mechner project until now. After two years of intense work by Jordan Mechner and a huge development team, Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow And The Flame is finally due to arrive this Summer. \"I always hoped there'd be a sequel,\" LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION! Four years have passed since the first version of the original Prince, and with the massive leaps in games technology that have been made in that time, Jordan has at last been able to reopen his bulging folder and for the sequel, bring to life all the ideas that never made it into the original game. The twoyear project has been huge almost like making a movie, with a two-hundred page script produced before programming began, dozens of action storyboards and a \"crew\" of over two dozen programmers, artists and musicians! \"The Prince 2 is by far the biggest team I've ever worked with,\" says the \"director\" Jordan. \"In comparison the original Prince team was very small just me!\" SO WHAT'S NEW? made the original so stunning to look at. «Also, we've expanded the Prince of Persia 2's basic story, with non-interactive platforms 'n' fighting formula storybook sequences in-between remains much the same as in the levels, with music, narration and original, but the game's much really beautiful illustrations which bigger, taking I think add place not just considerably to the inside the palace atmosphere and to but spilling the story,\" says outside the Jordan. grounds and even \"What I have tried to faraway to do in Prince of islands.

"ORLD EXCLUSIVE! WORLD EXCLUSIVE WOR the original Prince of Persia, for example, Jordan dressed up his brother in white pyjamas to look like the main character, and filmed him running and jumping around Central Park in New York to get the moves right! The technique known as Rotoscoping was born, and it's since been copied to amazing effect in games like Another World and Flashback. THAT MAN MECHNER Inspired by the classic Broderbund game Choplifter, 28 year-old New Yorker Jordan Mechner began his games-writing career with the beat'em up adventure Karateka before moving onto Prince of Persia, a more elaborate version of the same game. Since then, and during the success of his game on all manner of console and floppy formats, Mechner has got back to his real love film-making. He's already written two feature film scripts, and recently directed his own 19-minute movie called Waiting For Dark and shot on location in Cuba. It's Jordan's love of movies that enables him to make his games so atmospheric and film-like.

Using a The Prince leaves diabolical spell to make him look Persia as he arrived... Inspired by the likes of Errol Flynn, Jordan set out to create a swashbuckling game.... Prince of Persia 2's story is told using a cinematic introduction sequence, introducing the characters and setting up the plot before the action begins. Like all other aspects of the game, everything had been carefully sketched out by hand before, programming, so here's the original storyboard of what you'll eventually see on the screen... \"Prince 2 is by far the biggest team I've ever worked with...the original Prince team was very small just me!\" Jordan Mechner The Prince (that's you) goes to enter his throne room.

"\"DON'T BE GONE LONG ELLEN\" YEAH MAN, THE MOMMA AND SHE'S BAD ASS\" A LT EN The aliens are a very complex species, with loads of different breeds all out to get your blood. Here's a quick rundown: ALIEN EGG: May look harmless, but can cause a real headache. They'll constantly dispatch face huggers until you fry them, and that takes a lot of fuel from your flame thrower. The Alien 3 movie is the sequel to Aliens (I want to know why they didn't call it Alienss), which in turn is the sequel to Alien. If you've not seen the films yet, you're either very sad or far too young. The original is a classic piece of science fiction movie-making in which the crew of the Nostromo, under the command of Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, find that they have an alien stowed away in the cargo hold and have to rid themselves of the thing using nothing but cattle prods. The sequel took a turn for the violent. This sees Ripley, accompanied by the totally excellent Space Marines, going into an alien-infested space colony and basically blowing seven bells out of anything remotely ugly; needless to say this was easily the most enjoyable of the trio. The third, and least successful in the series, has Ripley marooned on Fiorina 161, a maximum security penal colony, which is attacked by the Aliens and, seeing as the prisoners have no weapons, things get a bit tricky. Alien 3 took a bit of a hammering at the box office with people complaining that there were no guns in it, which is a little strange seeing as there were none in the original either! You can now buy the Special Edition of Aliens on video, which contains 17 minutes of previously unseen footage. But don't get too excited, it's not that different to the original. FACE HUGGER: The simplest form of alien. The earlier breeds will not attach themselves to your face, but the blue or red ones will latch onto you tighter than one of the Fat Slags. CANINE ALIEN: The newest form of alien. These are capable of spitting acid over huge distances and very accurately. They can also leap incredibly far, so you'd better blast them quickly. REPTILE ALIEN: These things are very, very sneaky. Their small size makes them really difficult to see until they're right on you and they can take a bit of a beating as well. MOTHER ALIEN: This one's a real mutha! She is only found in a couple of locations in the later levels and spits a deadly vapour which will quickly send you to an early grave. She takes a hell of a battering and moves extremely quickly. QUEEN ALIEN: THE alien of all aliens. The queen alien guards the end of the game and does a damned good job of it as well! There's no point in trying to outrun her; this is a stand-up fight to the finish. These green ones take a real hammering. \"B GUN DOWN FIFTY PERCENT\" VERDICT Alien 3 is relentless; little Aliens, big Aliens, huge ones and ginormous ones, all shapes and sizes are included from the smallest of face-huggers to the whopping great Queen herself! The mission aspect adds lasting appeal, whilst the atmosphere generated by the smoky levels, with their great tunes, is fab. Ripley has three weapons to choose from at all times, and power-ups are spread throughout. The Megadrive version is a good 'un, but Sega owners will will be cursing their parents over their choice of console when they see this totally brilliant version. Fabulous! Ripley is not only a dab hand at rescuing hostages and wiping out entire species of killer Xenomorphs, she's also something of an electrician! The problem is that the aliens have gotten into every room in the entire colony and caused havoc. There are power generators down, fuse boxes blown pipes that need welding and countless other horrible tasks. To make matters worse, all of these tasks have to be completed while the aliens are running around! Fixing fuse boxes may sound as dull as Whitley Bay on a Friday night, but it actually provides a nice break from the rescuing of hostages, which is also one of Ripley's chief tasks. There are a few occasions where you have to perform that favourite task of the Space Marines welding doors shut. On some levels it is vital that you stop the progress of the aliens quickly, but remember once you've sealed a door, anything in that room is unreachable. On 100m STEVE KEEN SS Dos 35 "


"VERDICT Alien 3 manages to capture the moody feel of the movie to a tee. The animation is excellent with the aliens moving so fluidly, and the superb backdrops combine with the incredible sound to give this unrivalled atmosphere. The difficulty level is pitched perfectly; you can blast anything that moves and there's a real sense of extreme violence, but you can only get a little further with every go! The range of different tasks you have to perform keeps interest at a high! Alien 3 has been finely tuned and is one of the most streamlined and all-round brilliant carts I've seen. Ah, the beloved terminal. SAD FOLK START HERE PAUL ANGLIN If you're still stuck here after a day of play, then you should try quitting the Space Marine Corps and joining the Sad Morons Corps. If you're having that much trouble, try walking around in the crouch position all the time, as you'll be able to waste the Face Huggers a lot easier that way. NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER «BEES MAN. BEES HAVE HIVES\" IR: Cycles forward through weapons. L: Cycles backward through weapons. X: Rocket Launcher. GARTH A: Pulse Rifle. Alright, you're starting to get somewhere. Make sure the first thing you do is clear the Medic bays of alien eggs so that when your energy is low you can go and collect some without being bothered by newly-hatched aliens. AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! Directional Controller: Up, down, right, left. Select: Motion tracker. Start: Pause. B: Jump Y: Flame thrower. If you've got this far then you deserve to be in the next Alien movie (shame there won't be one really). You're just one stage away from facing the Queen alien. If you've got this far, there's not a lot more I can tell you, other than to have your trigger finger ready and make notes of any valuable rooms because these levels are BIG! \"NEXT TIME THEY WALK RIGHT UP AND KNOCK\" Don't you sometimes wish you could see around corners? In the SNES version of Alien 3 you're given the next best thing the motion tracker. As its name suggests, this swanky piece of kit will track anything that is moving in your immediate vicinity, giving you plenty of warning of anything that tries to catch you unawares. The motion tracker also picks up any trapped prisoners so you can locate them easily. Shame it doesn't pick up any icons though, 'cos that would be really handy. There are two main differences between the motion tracker on this version of Alien 3 and its Megadrive forerunner. For one, the motion tracker on the Megadrive version required batteries to keep it running, but this one doesn't. Second, the Megadrive tracker could be left on-screen all the time if you so wished, while this one can't. The problem is that when you push Select to bring up the motion tracker, it appears in the space where all your weapons are logged. This means that, as soon as you fire a weapon, that weapon will appear in its place. This can be very annoying at times, but it's easy to get it back up on-screen so it's not too bad. This is the ideal hiding place for Face Huggers-speak of the devils... THE 36 "


"ON THE OTHER HAND SUPER NES \"DO YOU HAVE ANY NEWS ABOUT MY DAUGHTER?\" CONTRA III : :99 This is a blast fest to the end. Contra III (or Super Probotector, depending on the version you purchase) pushes the Super NES to its very limits with some of the most stunning visual effects yet seen on the machine. Only play if your heart can take it; this is intense! REVIEWED: CVG No 126 PROS: Atmospheric, addictive, rock-hard. CONS: Most levels look very similar, and the animation of Ripley is a little suspect. You need energy fast. Tut tut, what a wasteful young lady. Anyone who's seen the movie will know that there are no weapons of any sort in Alien 3 . Luckily though, Acclaim has managed to sneak more than a few into the game. Ripley is armed with three different weapons: the flame thrower, grenade launcher and, of course, the ever-trusty Pulse rifle. You start off with all three weapons fully topped up and, whereas the grenade launcher is pretty much guaranteed not to run out, the Pulse rifle will need constant re-loading and the flame thrower can get a bit low when you're moving around in the tunnels a lot. GRAPHICS Excellent backdrops, with brilliantly detailed and animated sprites. INNOS Stunning music and effects combine to give unrivalled atmosphere. Now that's how to waste an egg! Very addictive and very hard you'll be playing well into the wee small hours ICON GUIDE VERDICT It may be , but believe me, it's  well spent. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES GRENADE PICKUP:This will give you a clip of ten grenades. AMMO PICK-UP: This will give you one full magazine for your Pulse rifle. GREEN FLAME PICK-UP:This will refill your green flame thrower. FLAME PICK-UP: This will refill your flame thrower. FIRST AID: This will replenish 20% of your energy. There's no denying that the Megadrive version of Alien 3 was a very good game the CVG boys still play it now. At least, we did until this Super NES version came crashing through the letterbox! Honestly, this is a stunning conversion of the movie, combining the best bits of the Sega game (which means the blasting parts) with a healthy portion of heart-pounding searching around the prison planet to complete the plethora of missions available to you. This is a massive cartridge it took us about three days to get to the end of what we thought was the game, but what in fact turned out to be only the first level! Graphically gorgeous and sonically far, far superior to a lot of current SNES outpourings, Alien 3 captures the atmosphere of the film and then some. In short, it's a smash!

As luck would have it, the twisted genius sturnbled across his dad's extraordinary cache of nukes. Hurrahla huge blow for world peace? A Pacific island has been atomised. The yanks have got pictures of the perpetrators, who are the notorious Drug lord, Carlos Ortega, and son of the Desert Strike madman, IBN Kilbaba. Spy satellites have unmasked a plot to incinerate Washington DC in revenge for interfering in the baddies' drug cartel. Once again you've been ordered to rid the world of menace.

"VERDICT PACK IT UP? NO PICK IT UP! Lumme mummy! A horror pad! EA promised great things for Jungle Strike and they have delivered. It combines all the best features of Desert Strike and some brilliant new ideas to boot. The range of scenarios is huge from Washington DC to the Jungle to the North Pole! You don't have to stick to flying a Comanche either! You can jump in a hovercraft or a top, new spanky F117A! Every aspect of the gameplay has been finely tuned and, as a result, Jungle Strike is more fun than even the original. A superb sequel that's set to do sell truckloads not to mention thousands of Megadrives as well! The Comanche may be one of the most streamlined and efficient killing machines yet devised, but even it needs to have its weapons topped up from time to time. The ammo crates are found in two different ways: either pick up the ones lying on the ground, or, if you find the ammo trucks, which isn't particularly hard to do, you can waste them, reaping a nice fresh crate for you to plunder. Be warned though, your Comanche can only hold one full ammo crate at a time, so only collect when you've zero weapons. PAUL ANGLIN Take the plane or the Comanche SO WHAT'S NEW? A VIEW TO A KILL So is Jungle Strike better than Desert Strike? The screenshots show that the game has undergone some pretty drastic changes. There's a vast range of scenarios and you even get to control a Stealth fighter! The basic gameplay hasn't changed all that much, although it has to be said, the chopper handles much better in this new version. (1 This is the main screen where you can view everything about the mission. 2 Go to this icon to see which part of the campaign you're in. 3 Go to this icon to see what still needs to be bombed. 4 This shows you which part of the mission you are currently viewing. 5 These counters show how much ammo you've got left for each weapon. 6 Everything you need to know about the state of your chopper. 0 2 34 You've got to waste that bridge, GUN9940 HELLFIRE54 HYDRAS 37 KR.

A BLOODY TAXI SERVICE? The hostages are in there, In the heat of combat, your chopper can take a bit of a battering, so repair it pretty frequently. There are two ways of doing this: firstly, if you're lucky you'll be able to pick up an armour repair kit that just happens to be lying around; secondly, take advantage of the quick repair service when you can drop off soldiers at the Landing Zone You'll get 50 points for each person dropped so it's worth collecting a load of men straight away so that, as soon as you get into trouble, you can drop them off and get sorted, rather than having to hunt around for a kit. It's gonna blow! Quick! Top up your energy How look at all that showy detail 39 "


"PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES. MEGADRIVE The major difference between Desert Strike and Jungle Strike is the fact that you get to use different vehicles in Jungle Strike. You start off with the standard ones, but, by the time you get through the game, you'll have driven a hovercraft and, in level seven fly F117A Stealth fighter! Currently the most expensive and deadly fighter plane in the known universe, EA give you the controls. The Stealth skims over the terrain and handles like an absolute dream. The plane even has its own weapons, including a bridge-busting bomb and a heat-seeking missile about as powerful as the Hydras (although you get a load of them). Hurrah, death to all things! PROS: Absorbing and very difficult gameplay, made pleasant thanks to superb grafics. CONS: Umm...errm...well...it could be just a little too 'strategic' for some people. Blow up the marijuana harvest just saying no isn't enough sometimes kids! SOHA Brilliantly drawn and excellently detailed sprites shift at an amazing pace. VERDICT Great music backed up by some well 'ard explosions. One of the night missions... Dark innit? As one my favourite Amiga blasters of all time, I always thought the scenario got a little samey by the end of the game with 16Mb in the cart, Jungle Strike blows away all these limitations, taking you from Washington DC to the frozen arctic wastes and tropical jungles. It's not just the settings that are more varied, either there's so much more depth to the missions and so the gameplay is even more atmospher ic and involving! I love the different types of vehicle, the night campaigns, the fact that it's all so much BIGGER oh, it's just excellent in every way. Get it! Get it now! Very very addictive, very very hard and just brilliant in every way. The bigger they are the harder they fall. GARY WHITTA SAD FOLK START HERE STEVE So, you can only get to level 2 eh? You sad cretinous, useless, negligible halfwit! Maybe you should try playing Mario Bros on one of those sad LCD game&watch things; you might actually be able to manage that! If you're stuck here though, just be very careful with your armour and top up as often as you can. Nine unfeasibly large campaigns that will take you ages to get through. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES THE FORMER MASTER To give you some idea of what Jungle Strike has to live up to here's a quick rundown on how well its predecessor did: Desert Strike was first released around '91 and sold absolutely stacks of copies. Not only that, but it also persuaded many-a-person to go out and exchange cash for a Megadrive! Then, late last year, Desert Strike sprinkled the same magic dust on the SNES; last month saw Amiga Desert Strike. What's the possibility of Jungle Strike moving onto other machines? EA are saying nothing but we reckon it could happen. NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER GARY You're obviously used to handling your meaty chopper. But you'll have to stay alert if you want to beat the drug lords. Here's a handy tip: If a building needs blowing up, fly close to it and emerge just around the corner. This way, you stay out of range 'til the last minute, allowing you to trash the gun installments. ONWOO 111111111 IIITT w WISS OK HIT AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! PAUL Level 7 is where the top nobs play! Once you're this far you deserve to star in Wings Of The Apache! By now you should have mastered the use of the jink button.

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE by SEGA .99 OUT: May. Contact Sega (071 373 3000) for information. You'll believe that a fit lass can fly! Punch that large, colourful thing! CHARACTER ASSASSINATION The latest release from Sega is yet another licenced platform game. Will this cart be good enough for super hero status? Although there are loads and loads of different X-Men in the comics, you can only choose to control four of them. So, let's see what special powers and stuff each one has to offer... CYCLOPS WOLVERINE So called because of his strange Our personal favourite because visor type attachment, Cyclops is he's so hard, Wolverine has lethal able to project a searing hot beam steel claws instead of fingernails of laser light from his eyeballs, which can shred an enemy in the burning right through any baddies blink of an eye. The claws are that get in its path. Using the really his only weapon, so all his correct combination of moves he other special moves, such as can also perform the Optic Blast lunge attacks and spinning slash, Spin Attack, which is revolve around these seriously crucial. retractable razors. WOLVERINE ou've got to hand it to these console games companies. They really know how to keep coming up with original ideas. After months of wondering if there would ever be an end to unoriginal products, Sega has silenced all the critics by releasing... oh, another arcade-style platform game. Sorry, that didn't really work did it? Yes, X-Men, the longawaited video game version of the Marvel Comics team of hero mutants, is a jump-about-and-beat-upthe-enemies extravaganza in the traditional style. But is it different enough to stand our from the crowd? NIGHTCRAVIER GAMBIT Binib verere Flame shoe hilarity abounds. NIGHT CRAWLER Night crawler is a bizarre Panther like character capable of teleporting through solid objects. This is very handy, but unfortunatley it leaves him a bit short in the fighting department, as all he can do is kick and jump around. Wimp! GAMBIT This bloke is by far the most ridiculous of the lot. Frenchman Gambit kills his enemies by throwing get this electrified playing cards at them! He also carries a staff that he slashes and spins around to kill close range bad guys. Claire Rayner's not the only one with wings. 42 "


"X-CRUCIATING? VERDICT MEGADRIVE PROS: Excellent atmosphere and good all-round feel. CONS: A bit fiddly at times, and we've seen most of this before. The clever thing about X-Men is that you're not limited to controlThe main problem X-MEN is that each of their abilities are used in a very ling just one character. Each super limited form. Nightcrawler has just two special moves and your control hero has unique special abilities, is limited to duck, sproing, and slash. If a prop that you'll need to use to get past er arsenal of fighting moves had been used some of the game's trickier obstafor you to beat your enemies SF2 style, then cles. Nightcrawler's teleportation this could have been a real winner. Instead, powers are ideal for getting past what you've got is a very standard platform brick walls and things so it's a romp, with nice graphics that you have limitgood job, that you can swap ed control over. What is left is an average between the four characters as game with some nice tunes and effects and many times as you like. Simply tasty graphics that don't do very much. A pause the game to bring up the Xwasted opportunity. Menu, select one of the other three heroes and presto! You're GARTH SUMPTER transformed into the new character! You may have to swap characX-CELLENT ters fairly often, since their special powers, like their energy, are limited and need a rest every now and then to recharge. Oh, and some of If you're not into Marvel Comics the other X-Men make guest you won't be familiar with the Xappearances in the form of special Men characters, so here's a quick smart bombs (they whizz on and snippet to tell you just what the kill all the baddies for you when heck they are. A bunch of mutated summoned) along with Marvel Girl, superheroes who, due to being who puts you back on the map bitten by radioactive insects/blastwith her tractor beam eyes when ed by gamma rays/experimented you fall off. on by the government etc, have That man's got a vine growing out of his head! acquired amazing mutant powers and terminally silly names like Gambit, Nightcrawler and Wolverine. Brought together by some doddery old bloke in a wheelchair, the X-Men constantly have to save the world from an equally mutated band of super-villains and, in particular, the everdevious Magneto. And he's been up to his old tricks again... CHARACTERS? BRAPHICS Nice X-Men sprites and backdrops, but nothing special. 80 SOUND A great collection of tunes and effects. GAMEPLAY It's average platform hack'emup action all the way. THE X-CITING STORY? VALUE It doesn't take long for the novelty to wear off, and once it does... Uh-oh-face-off time for an X-Man. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES You've died. That's quite sad, really. 7 Magneto has devised an evil plan to infect the world's computers with a deadly virus but to succeed he needs the X-Men out of the way. So, he transmits the virus to the X-Men's secret HQ on Earth and gains control of the computer that generates their holographic training ground. With the X-Men trapped inside the deadly world of holograms and Magneto in control of the game, our mutant heroes will have to use all their special powers to escape! Seeya, sad baddies! They're so thick doh! VERDICT ONWOOCO MISS OK! HIT Not being a comics fan like some other writers, I was able to approach the X-Men game without stars in my eyes and it's a good job too. XMen is a credible conversion of the popular comic characters, but gameswise it doesn't offer much that the majority of decent platform beat'em-ups don't already. The main hook is the ability to control different characters with unique abilities, but I must confess it's a novelty that doesn't do a great deal for me. You tend to stick with your fave character and only swap when absolutely necessary, and it soon becomes routine. X-Men looks and sounds great and plays better than the majority of games in this genre, but don't expect anything much above average. GARY WHITTA 43 "

"DR GENE'S BIG HELMET VERDICT MEGADRIVE So you've got a pretty straightforward task ahead of you, yes? Not at all! Montana Max, in order to keep you busy while he goes off in search of all the lovely loot, has enlisted his two dastardly chums, Dr. Gene Splicer and Elmyra. Dr. Splicer has invented a special helmet which brainwashes the wearer into doing the bidding of whoever holds the remote control. Elmyra has been given the job of kidnapping Babs Bunny, Fifi and Shirley The Loon, and Buster must rescue all of his pals as well as find the treasure to complete the game. A busy bunny this lad certainly is! Those of you expecting a conversion of the SNES game, forget it this is a brand new title, with the only similarities being the characters. There's been a lot of time spent getting the graphics right, and although there's nothing fresh in the gameplay I still found myself glued to the screen. It could have been tougher the fact that the player is given infinite continues AND a password system doesn't help matters much but for sheer enjoyment, Tiny Toon Adventures Buster's Hidden Treasure is up with the good 'uns. PROS: Excellent graphics, and loads of levels stuffed with baddies. CONS: The game can be completed quickly if you use infinite continues and passwords. PAUL RAND Here's the map screen, showing exactly where you are on the, erm, map. SIIHd149 Highly detailed and colourful cartoon sprites and backdrops. SPLICE 'N' DICE Jolly tunes and a suitable array of sound effects. Dr. Gene Splicer can be found at the end of certain levels, holding captive one of your Toon chums !

I must admit that I was expecting a straight conversion of the SNES version of this game and was bum faced when I realised that this was not the Tiny Toons that I was expecting. However, I soon warmed to the game because it takes all the best elements of it's cutesy SNES counterpart like superb cartoon-style grraphics and a simple yet demanding gameplay. All the puzzles within the game are progressive and there ae nice touches too! Like the way Buster totters when he's on the edge of a hill or platform and the way he runs through lines of carrot, his legs just a cartoon blur. All these details reflect the fact that the game has been put together properly and is the reason why Tiny Toons' simple class will just shine out! WISS OK!

"LREVIEW by NAXAT by NAXAT .00 .00 SUPER NES OUT: On import, Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the review cartridge. Famico The red car bruns rubber, while sad black lurches along behind. 0.5 [  PROS: Plenty of options and tracks to tackle veryone knows that us Brits are the topsters when it comes to the wacky world of Formula 1 racing. This perhaps, in a strange way, explains the Japanese need for racing games. Through these, Johnny Foreigner can act out his nation's fantasies of motor racing glory. So get that helmet on, rev your V12 and let rip on the road! YO CONS: Poor responsiveness and bad handling of the car ruin the game. WWE 0902 GRAPHICS Fairly clear and bright, but certainly nothing special. Se o Batte Grand Prix ANNOS Droney engine noise and very poor tunes. nem GAMEPLAY Irritating in the extreme, poor controls ruin the game. VROOM! VROOM! VERDICT Costs the same as Mario Kart, and is really no competition. There are loads of racing games already available for the Super NES, so the team behind Battle Grand Prix have decided to make their effort a bit different by giving it a top-down overhead view. The left and right controls rotate the car as it hares around the track, instead of steering it in the more conventional way, giving it an almost Micro Machines-esque feel. However, this is far more of a \"serious\" race game, and as such is stuffed with options. Blimey, what's this? Another racing game on the SNES! Battle Grand Prix has some great ideas in it, but unfortunately it's been completely ruined, mainly by the badly-implemented control system. The track scrolls so quickly and the car turns so erratically it's commonplace to oversteer not by accident, but just simply because the game is at fault. There's also the problem that all of the options are in Japanese, so you can't tell which teams and drivers are any good. All in all, Battle Grand Prix is a rather dull and insipid affair best avoided. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 3 PAUL RAND SCREECH! SCREECH! ONWOO  MUMU IIIIIIIIIIII PRIVER Selecting your driver and the team you wish to race for is a simple affair, as you can probably guess from this screenshot! CRASH! CRASH! MISS The player can select one of three race modes Survival, Champion or VS. Survival is a pretty simple knockout contest; should the player finish too late in the rankings, he's out of the race. Champion has you racing for points on all the top circuits of the world. VS mode is a two-player head-to-head race. After this, it's time to choose your driver, then it's team selection malarky all the way as you pick your favourite sponsor if you've chosen wisely, he'll be the one with the most money available to invest in your car and give you a better all-round chance. FROUND ! CAIRO EGUT UM REJ 16 horas It's possible to modify the weight, steering, tyres, suspension, brakes, transmission and, of course, engine of your speedy steed before each race, setting yourself up in accordance with the track itself and also the weather. However, the better the components, the more easily they wear out (there's logic for you), and the more visits to the pits required per race. COMP SORT 47 "


"REVIEW MEGA CD by CAPCOM -50 OUT: TBA. Contact Sega (0713733000) for information Special thanks to ACE Consoles (071439 1885) for their help with the Mega CD. INAL FIGHT The Mega CD has been without a contender to beat Final Fight for the beat 'em up crown...until now. he Mad Gear gang are a touch unhappy. Up until a few months ago their business' was running very smoothly: people were handing over their cash like there was no tomorrow, others were joining their ranks and any who refused to do either were being bounced off bridges. That was until Mike Haggar was elected the new Mayor. In one fell swoop Haggar cleared the city of the Mad Gear's crime, almost as quickly as they had plagued it. The ST Gears were furious; there was no way they could carry on now, so something just had to be done! WER Mike Haggar could hardly believe his Oo 'eck a strange spooky hand. ears. His lovely daughter Jessica, kidnapped by the Mad Gears and her safe return guaranteed only in exchange for the mayor's leniency. However, the ex-Streetfighter champion does not take kindly to threats and has decided that along with his pals Cody and Guy, he's t's 9:30 and Anglin's having trouble with the ticket going to get her back before the Mad Gears can even work out how much cash inspector again. they want for the lovely lass. they had to car LEVELS GALORE! There are some really tricky bits here, including a very awkward fiery floor bit. The guardian Metro City is made up of six different areas, here is an ex-army type called Rolento, whose each guarded by an incredibly hard end-ofhobbies include working for the Mad Gears level baddy. If you battle your way through to and lobbing grenades at anyone trying to close the end of the Slum level, you'll find yourself up them down, so look out! It's best to keep against Damnd. This guy's pretty easy just jumping around and watch the grenades intentkeep moving and watch out for all his pals that ly. The penultimate level takes place at the Bay will be running area.

The WR TOKY king of the Bay Area is none other than killers on the Underground, you'll have to FARK-li POSTRAL Abigail. Don't be misled by his girly take on the might of Sodom, who can be name, this guy is rock hard. Just pepper a bit of a git. Don't just stand in front of him with punches and try to jump out of him when he's got his swords or you'll his way when he runs across the screen. end up a kebab!

Be careful up level 4 (this is the level that was though, Jessica is his hostage. missed out of the SNES conversion). 48 "


"CONTROLS DIFFERENT CHARACTERS The main drawback with the SNES version of Final Fight was the lack of Guy (or Cody if you bought Final Fight Guy). Luckily though the Mega CD version has all three characters in. In case you've missed it, here's the profile on the lads. JUMP Hondon CODY Occupation: Streetfighter/allround top boy. Height: 5'11' Weight: 18716 Cody's speciality is the ancient art of Karate. His exceptional speed means that he can dodge a lot more blows than Haggar and then stun opponents with his considerable strength. Haggar and Guy can only throw knives, but Cody's expertise means that he can slash with them, causing a lot more damage. SPECIAL MOVE ATTACK ATTACK Tilt = ESET E2 BOLENID CHIEU]:= 156T51 BULENTO HAGGAR Occupation: Mayor/ exStreetfighter Height: 6'8\" Weight: 29716 Being the exStreetfighter that he is, Haggar is something of a powerful lad and has a tendency to slam his opponents into the pavement. He has a considerable array of moves, including his double lariat which was supposedly copied by Zangief of Streetfighter II fame blimey! GUY Look at that for a speed blur. Occupation: Ninja Height: 5'10\" Weight: 15816 Guy's main attribute is his speed, used to confuse opponents whilst he attacks with a superb combination of moves. His strength isn't tops though, so you'll have to work hard to win through! 690112 VERDICT Right on the chin. Look at the air on that kick. ON THE OTHER HAND 10 Ever fancied buying your own Final Fight coin-op? Well forget that, the Mega CD version is even better! Capcom have shoe-horned absolutely every aspect of the arcade original onto the CD. There have been no compromises anywhere all three characters are in there, all six levels AND the two player mode! The gameplay has aged superbly and after nearly three years this is still as playable as it ever was, not to mention damned hard! The fight action just never lets up and not once is there even a hint of slowdown. Final Fight also displays some of the fastest disc access times I've seen on a home CD machine and this gives the game that really polished, arcade feel. Forget Streetfighter 11 THIS is the best coinop conversion ever! w FINAL FIGHT SNES It's been available for a while now and it's excellent. However, there are only two characters, five levels and no two player option. It may not be perfect, but it's not too far off. REVIEWED: CVG No 128 PAUL ANGLIN "


"MEGA CD SAD FOLK START HERE If you can't make it up to Sodom then something is seriously wrong. Maybe you'd be better off leaving your Mega CD to one side and attending the odd garden fete like real mayors. But if you need my help then try using your special attack when you're surrounded. WEAPONS AHOY! NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER Seeing as Cody and the rest of the bunch are somewhat outnumbered, it's perfectly acceptable for them to use any object they find lying around on the floor with which to do in the Mad Gear gang. And it just so happens that there are all manner of rather nasty weapons scattered around the landscape. GARTH PROS: For the price this is the cheapest arcade machine you'll ever buy! CONS: Errm... well it's getting a little old now. GAME OVER Well if you've made it this far you're really starting to get to grips with Haggar and the boys. Keep on your toes 'cos things get harder now. When you're up against Edie, throw the smaller baddies into him to knock him off balance, and most importantly, stick close to him. AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL 'ARD! GRAPHICS The words \"arcade perfect\" hold true meaning here. These really are spot on. PAUL Okay then, the last but one level! When a load of Hollywoods and El Gados coming at you (about mid way through the level) just throw them into each other and they'll be gone in no time. A little tip for Abigail: When he gets mad (he turns red) and runs towards you, use a flying kick Coin-op tracks are not only faithfully reincarnated, but also beefed up a little. The first thing you'll come across is the knife. This is handy for lobbing at enemies but if you're controlling Cody, then you can also slash people with it. For the slightly more brutal amongst there are even sections of lead piping lying idle that can be used to bludgeon members of the Mad Gear into submission. Absolutely frantic beat 'em up action and it gets even wilder with two players. BONUS STAGES Every now and again, the boys decide to take a pop at something that can't hit back. First of all it's a lovely new car owned by one of the Mad Gears. You get thirty seconds in which to scrap the car with either your fists or the piece of lead piping that is lying at the side of the car. Fans of Streetfighter II will be more than familiar with this. The second smash stage is in a glass factory. There are panes of glass lined up and you have to destroy them all within the thirty second time limit. If you hit the glass in the right place it will smash instantly, if however you catch it wrong, it will spin round and whack you in the face causing you to lose valuable time. Plenty of fighting fun here especially with a second player. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT PICK-UPS MILLILITLU ONWA Glowing praise from Mr Anglin there, and that's hardly surprising, considering he's as mad about Final Fight as I am about Kick Off! This is indeed the fine conversion that the lad says! Everything's in there the excellent graphics (all the characters are extremely impressive, as are the many moody backdrops), the plethora of meaty tunes and sound effects, and the frenetic beat 'em up action. There's the two-player mode and third char acter which the SNES version didn't have, and an extra level that even the coin-op didn't pos sess! It's expensive, yes, but you're going to have to expect to pay slightly over the odds for Mega CD games in these early stages. And you certainly should buy this it's the best Mega CD title to date! MISS HIT What with all this top scrapping, ithe heroes can get a little wom out after a while. Luckily there are plenty of edible items lying around on the floor for your consumption. To pick them up, simply crouch over them and push attack. A range of different food power-ups to refill your energy can be found some of them are lying around on the floor, but on later levels they will mainly be hidden in barrels and things, so it's always worth destroying a bit of the scenery to try and locate an energy-replenishing bite. a PAUL RAND 50 "

"TREVEW SUPER NES by MICROPROSE .99) OUT: On import. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the review cart. Watch out for anti-aircraft flak it hurts! Please fasten your seatbelts... STRIKE EAGLE A REAL flight simulation for the Super NES at last? Well, not quite... t's almost comforting to know that, whenever some tinpot army starts kicking up a stink in a remote corner of the world, we can always rely on Uncle Sam and his lean, mean killing machine to pop over there and get it sorted. Yep, no-one knows more about having wars than the Americans, and these days they've got enough sexy killing technology to make them look hard and cool even when they lose. One such very swish piece of kit is the F-15 Eagle, which has not only struck several blows for truth, justice and the American way (hurrah!) over the years, but has also provided Microprose with a series of flight sim blockbusters on floppy formats and now on Super NES. So, strap yourself in and prepare to kick Gadaffi, Saddam and the rest of the warring loonies out of your no-fly zones! 52 and in range, you can attack with your cannon or Sidewinder missiles the latter of which will only guarantee a kill if you can hold the target in your sights long enough to get a positive lock. Enemy missiles are the main threat here, so be ready with chaff and flares when the onboard computer warns you that a missile is on your tail. TAKE THAT! Once you fly over one of the designated ground target, the REAL action begins! In this Mode 7-tastic action section, you fly your Eagle over the rotating landscape below, dodging anti-aircraft fire and trying to knock out the target installation. To do this you need to gain altitude, then swoop down on the target and hit it with either cannon fire or an air-to-ground missile before pulling up again and flying away from the scene. Once you're away and clear, it's on to the next target! truth, justi has also provies on floppy PUT 'EM UP! Once an enemy plane gets into firing range, the action switches to a conventional first-person flight sim view. From here you have two options fight or flee. On full afterburner you may be able to escape and get back on with your mission, but that gobbles up a lot of fuel, so the best option is to go for a quick kill. Once you've got the enemy fighter in your sights "


"HUD (HEADS UP DISPLAY) VERDICT N 1056 en Aw I'm in no doubt that Super Strike Eagle is one of the best and most original games on SNES in quite a while. It's not a real flight simulation in the true sense, but that's all to the good because we all know how slow and boring the more \"serious\" sims can be. What Microprose has done is transform its F-15 sim into a fast, action-orientated game while retaining some of the original's deeper, sim like elements the result is a game with plenty of arcade action on offer, combined with an important tactical side that means you constantly have to think and plan out your next move. With great graphics and oodles of atmospheric sound and speech adding to the fun, I'd recommend that you put Super Strike Eagle right at the very top of your SNES shopping list immediately!

"STRIKE EAGLE SUPER NES GET ORF MY LAND! Getting hit by enemy fire causes damage, and with limited fuel and weapons available, you'll need to fly back to the friendly airstrip or aircraft carrier to top up supplies and patch up the aircraft. Landing is one of the toughest parts of the game, as you have to come in at exactly the right speed and angle to avoid splashing yourself all over the runway. Once you've landed, repairs and re-arming are automatic, but you can only do this twice in each daytime mission during night missions you're not allowed to rearm at all, so the whole kit and caboodle must be done in one go! 0992 ali PROS: A brilliant mix of arcadestyle blasting and strategic planning. CONS: It's often too hard to land the F-15! LOH FUEL SIDEHIDDE! CRAPHICS Lots of variety, and particularly impressive in Mode 7 air-toground attack scenes. 2 JOYPAD JOLLIES!

Use the tactical map to find your way around. MISSIONS IMPOSSIBLE Super Strike Eagle is broken down into four campaigns, each set in a different part of the world and consisting of a number of increasingly tough missions. After a simple training sortie, you begin your tour in Libya, then progress to the Gulf, Korea and, finally, Cuba. As you give each country a good walloping, they cave in and join the United Nations like all good countries should. In each campaign, the map of the theatre (that's a military term for the place where the argy-bargy happens) remains the same, but the targets get tougher and increase in number as the missions go on. Four campaigns, dozens of missions and a handy password system! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Steer your plane towards targets (and away from baddies) on the main map. TAKE OFF! VERDICT ONWUOLO IT ILLLLLLLLL mm When I first heard that Microprose was converting F-15 Strike Eagle to SNES, I expected something more akin to their flight sims than an arcade action-based blaster. The latter is what you get though, and I for one am not complaining! Each mission is packed with features, not to mention excellent graphics Mode 7 has been pushed to the limit, and everything fairly rattles along at a pace that may catch you out when you first pick up and play. The downside to Super Strike Eagle is that there's not much diversion from the path laid out in the first level encounter an enemy plane, fly about on the map screen then switch to Mode 7 view and dive-bomb an enemy installation. Still, what's here is the tops; I'll be tinkering with this for a while yet. HIT Each mission's objective is simple knock out all the ground targets given in the preflight briefing. There can be just a few, or dozens of different installations targeted for a mission, and they're all protected by SAM missile sites and enemy MIG fighters (which take off from the many airbases), so you've got your work cut out. Most of the flying is done on the large scrolling tactical map simply point your plane towards your objective, and once you fly over it you, go in for the kill. The real trick with this not to let any of the enemy missiles or planes get too close chaff and flares can be used to decoy SAMs, but if a persistent MiG pilot gets close enough to engage, you have no choice but to get into a dogfight with him. 90 PAUL RAND "

It's chilly down in the ice caves. Nudge nudge, wink wink... it's the Superfrog fruit machine! More sub-zero shenanigans in Superfrog's frozen world. CONS: The controls take a bit of getting used to. SUPERFROG Beautiful sprites and backdrops add up to a visual feast. A bunch of entertaining tunes and FX add no end to the atmosphere. TEAM 17'S TOPPED EVERY OTHER ARCADE GENRE ON AMIGA NOW THEY'RE TRYING FOR THE CUTESY PLATFORM CROWN! ust what is it with these guys from Wakefield? A couple of years ago they were writing demos for the Public Domain circuit, and today they're among the hottest Amiga games developers around! Since the excellent Alien Breed back in 1990, Team 17 has become the computer shoot 'em up field with ProjectX, kicked Strider into touch with the excellent Assassin and revived the Amiga beat 'em up scene with the Streetfighter-smashing Body Blows. Now though, they face a much tougher challenge, taking on the might of Watch out for the bees they sting! the full-to-overflowing cutesy platform genre! Can they continue their Amiga rollercoaster ride with yet another hit? Only reading this review will reveal all... GAMEPLAY May be too fast for some people, but if you liked Sonic you'll love this. Depends on how good you are, but the five levels are big enough to last quite a while. ONCE UPON A TIME... ..there was a frog. And that, bar all the usual baloney about a kidnapped girlfriend, an evil witch and a bottle of Lucozade with magical powers, is all you need to know of the Superfrog story. Cutting through all the standard platform-game spiel, what it boils down to is a high-speed, Mario style platform actioner in the classic tradition. Complete with cape, Superfrog has to leap his way across five worlds before he can banish evil and be re-united with his betrothed. Ribbit! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 3 The hydraulic spikes in the castle can be a real pain in the ass. VERDICT ONWOO  WORLD HOPPER Superfrog's quest takes him across five sprawling worlds the enchant ed forest, haunted castle, big-top circus, Egyptian land and finally that old favourite, the ice world. Froggy's objective on each level is simple dash about the place and collect enough coins to open the magic exit, then find the door and whizz on through! Sounds easy? Don't you believe it. Each world's evil denizens will stop at nothing to turn Superfrog into toad-in-thehole, and initially the only way you can fight them is to bounce on their heads. Hold on, isn't this all sounding a bit familiar? Well, I'm impressed. Superfrog comes closer to emulating the look and feel of a classy console platform game than any other Amiga title I've seen. It looks, sounds and plays as good as a top-grade Japanese platformer, and while the likes of Mario and Sonic have the slight edge in terms of atmosphere and character, Superfrog is by far the best thing to happen to the Amiga platform scene in yonks! It thrashes all other contenders in the speed and graphics stakes and, with so many neat touches, Team 17 actually manages to bring some originality to a tired-out old genre. Do not, I repeat do NOT miss Superfrog! MISS OK HIT GARY WHITTA 56 "

"REVIEW TURBO DUO by LUCASARTS .99 OUT: Now. Review CD supplied by ACE Consoles (071 439 1185). Is that what they call a Greenhouse? TIL Joom LucasArts' first console-based fantasy game turns out to be dead dreamy.... A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION oung Bobbin Threadbare has been given a bit of a raw deal for the past sixteen years. He and his best friend, Mother Hetchel, have constantly been refused entry to weaving school. However, Hetchel has a little experience in weaving so she has been teaching Bobbin what she can, from a book that belonged to one of the elders. Suddenly, Bobbin and Hetchel have been summoned by the High Council to appear before them in the sanctuary. What was wrong? Had he and Hetchel been caught with the book? Were they now going to be banished from Loom Island for good? Or were they just going to be sent to the shop? Loom Island in all its glory. MS (1) Arrow: This is used to direct Bobbin and to point at objects before you weave a draft on them. (2) Distaff: This is the magic staff that is used to weave all the drafts, it must be found before you can do anything, (3) Animation window: This is where all the action takes place, (4) Icon box: This shows you what you are currently viewing. Click on it once to walk to it, click on it twice, to get the draft from it. 58 "


"NIGHT VISION VERDICT TURBO DUO can't see a thing. I'm a massive fan of the LucasArts series of adventures and was looking forward to seeing how well that style of game would translate to the new CD format. I'm not disappointed. The two biggest changes are the obvious hike in music quality, and the need to swap untold amounts of floppy discs has been negated. Graphically, Loom's a treat, and there's a wonderful story there which unfolds more and more the further you progress. The biggest gripe is the sometimes painful disc accessing, but it's not a massive hindrance and generally you'll swoon over Loom! This room shows you how to spin gold, but you can not find out how until you can see in the dark. PROS: Easy to get into, completely absorbing and great fun to boot. CONSO Slow disc access times and slightly easy gameplay. PAUL RAND Walk off towards the forest GRAPHICS Excellent animation and some brilliant stills. 92 Go through to the graveyard and walk to the thorn bushes. IT'S DE STAFF MAN 'If Bobbin is going to weave drafts, then he'll need to pick up his magic distaff. The distaff is the magical stick of the elders (okay, so Bobbin blagged it) which Bobbin uses to cast his drafts. To use the distaff, you must first point at something and then hit the notes in the right order. However, you do not start with the distaff. Between you and me though, it's hidden in one of the tents on Loom Island, I'm not going to tell you which one though get the game and find it for yourself! The village is just beyond that lence. Don't scare those sheep! SOUND Moody and atmospheric tunes give the game real atmosphere. When you touch the thorn bushes, a Rabbit will run out and the Owl that was covering the headstone will fly off to catch it. MOYO 793-2004 Destiny dravia Latin Der GAMEPLAY Incredibly easy to get into but is hindered by the slow disc access times. EHTO The importance of the headstone becomes apparent later on in Loom Island. Feels heavier than it looks. That huge machine is the Loom. The Dragon has quite a horde of gold. BIT DRAFTY IN HERE, INNIT? Being a spellcasting weaver isn't the easiest occupation in the world. The amount of drafts you have to learn is bewildering. The simplest draft of all, is the opening and closing draft. You will be given this when you you see Hetchel turned into a Swan (?). The most important thing to remember about all the drafts, is that the effects will reverse themselves if the draft is played backwards. The more complicated drafts come later in the game, and their use will often seem rather pointless (like the reflection draft) but they become oh so priceless later on. VALUE A brilliant title that's perfect for novices of the RPG world. Go to the first Owl hole and click. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 This room holds the secret of how to dye wool. Go to all the holes one after the other. If you don't do the bit with the headstone first, then there will only be Owls in three of the holes. The Owls will give you the draft. ONW70 000 VERDICT TIILIT MISS OK! HIT Back to the tent and cast the draft. Loom has to be one of the most instantly playable fantasy adventures ever! The simplistic nature of the game means that you can pick it up, and start playing right away. However, the excellent graphics and sound in Loom paper over two minor cracks in the game for one, the disc access time is sometimes horribly slow, and it's not the most difficult of games if you've played a few RPGs before. If you're a bit of a newcomer to the fantasy adventure scene, then Loom will provide you with a solid start to your future gaming endeavours. Well worth looking up. 89 PAUL ANGLIN Hurrah! You can now see, weave gold to your hearts content. 59 "

REVIEW 1, IECTRONIC ANIS-9 CXENO ROTS Check out our swift, no-nonsense guide to the three Xenobots you'll have to win over if you're to blast the marauding alien scum back to their festering planet. HUMANOID Height: 18 meters Width (front): 10.5 meters Length (side): 11.5 meters Std. Cruising Speed: 48 km/hr Max. Emergency Speed: 80 km/hr Offensive Weapons: Seeker and Plasma Cannon. Defensive Weapons: Sparkle Cloak and On-board ECM Crew: 1 SPEC: This is the hard-fast battle droid. A pure fighting machine, heavily armoured and lethally kitted out with the latest weaponry. The Seeker missiles have a range of over 2 kilometres and reload quickly, Plasma shots take longer to recharge but are the deadlier of the two and has twice the range. The excellent array of sensors and tracking devices make it the Hunter/Killer of the mechwarrior basin. NET BUILDER Height (to tail): 22 meters Height (of main hull): 14.5 meters Width (front): 30 meters Length (side): 36 meters Std. Cruising Speed (empty):48km/hrMax.Emergency Speed (fully loaded): 20% faster Max. Turning Rate: 6 degrees/sec Offensive Weapons: Dual Rapid-fire Cannons and Homing Missile Defensive Weapons: Mines, Sparkle Cloak, Alarm Buoy, ECM Buoy and EMI Decoy Cargo Bay Capacity: 12 NET Relays Crew: 1 Pilot and 1 Tech SPEC: Known as the Scorpion, the NET Builder is responsible for constructing and maintaining the power NET that provides your machines with juice. Extremely slow, but hide an awesome sting in their tail in the form of a homing missile that will track down and destroy virtually any target with one shot. An on-board camera, relays the explosion back to the craft. There are several automated commands to set the beast on the right track whilst you get on with the fighting. THE SCOUT Walking Height: 15 meters Minimum Standing Height: 12 meters Width (front): 11.5 meters Length (side): 13 meters Std. Cruising Speed: 72 km/hr Max. Emergency Speed: 95 km/hr Max Turning Rate: 72 degrees/sec Offensive Weapons: Small Cannon and Seeker Defensive Weapons: On-board ECM, Sparkle Cloak, Mines, ECM Buoy, Alarm Buoy and EMI Decoy Crew: 1 SPEC: Designed for reconnaissance, the Scouts' excellent manoeuvrability and speed allow it to move quickly into enemy territory. It's compact and ideal for advanced investigation of unknown regions. The Scouts' longer battery life means that they can operate outside the power NET for greater periods. With its incredibly long stride, the machine can often out run enemies even after it's been detected. IN D. Operator Log in VERDICT nfogrames had the idea of players controlling huge battling robots in their aging Amiga game Metal Masters. The French chose to waste the brilliant concept on a feeble beat 'em up. Last month Activision gave the gameplay a serious boost with Battletech on SNES, but that too fell flat on its rusty ass! Now, simulation kings Electronic Arts have taken up the challenge and, quite frankly, I can't imagine a better company for the gig! With the Earth invaded by aliens the only way we could repel their huge machines was to unleash the huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. Now the monsters're back, but they're in for more than they bargained for as the planet's finest brains have managed to rebuild some of the busted bots and turn them around to our side. You're in command now ... 62 Not too long ago, I toddled off down to the Trocadero in Piccadilly Circus and had my first game of Walker on the Virtuality set-up they've got down there. It was great, and I wanted to do the same on my home machine. Xenobots isn't the same as that top game for one, it's about ten million times harder to control than the VR version but once I'd waded through the manual a couple of times and generally tinkered with the controls, I got well stuck in to the action. And there's a lot of action; massive robots parade all over the place, looking to whoop your ass in a serious manner. The enemies are well-drawn, which adds to the effect of being there' and generally, I lapped up what Xenobots had to offer. PAUL RAND "

The main objective is to save the planet, but take things slowly, one step at a time. The whole world's been invaded and you'll have to claim it back piece by piece. You don't have much choice at the beginning, as there are only two missions available to you, but the more you complete the further you'll be able to travel. Some missions require you to control a huge amount of Xenobots and it can be hard to keep track of all your hardware. Can be slow, but not such a bad thing with all the different controls to master.

I hope he's wearing protection! ONWOOD ITUTIILI 00||||||| MISS OK! HIT Playing Xenobots is a bit like being in command of a huge American Football team. Each robot has its own functions and you can switch between each warrior and jump into the hotseat of any of your machines at the push of a button. All the droids can be placed on autopilot and left to their own devices or you can use the auto commands (which tell them to perform a certain tasks like shadow a builder bot and protect it from attack) The enemy have the same robots as you, so the idea's to extend your power NET towards theirs and destroy their main base. Sounds simple? You just wait, mate! This is more like it! Ever since the Manga films captured our imagination with gigantic robotic warfare l've been ripping my hair out for a game that would bring it all home and into my per sonal computer and here it is! The only problem with Xenobots is that there's much too much to take in all at once. With all the controls at your disposal it would be impossible to get any enjoyment out of the game without first reading the manual fully. But persevere, adopt a style and you'll get into the game in a big way. Xenobots is by no means perfect, but it'll certainly do for now! 80 STEVE KEEN 63 "


"We've got FIVE copies of the TERMINATOR on Super NES to give away! You could be playing this for FREE if you're lucky enough! iked the tip-of-the-top Terminator roundup we brought you last month? Course you did, and we thought it would be quite a good idea to round off that super-excellent batch of Arnie-related reviews and news with a spanking good competition. And here it is! Five lucky winners will each be waltzing off with a copy of Mindscape's brand new Super NES conversion of The Terminator, reviewed last issue. Not too shabby, eh? And just to make this compo even MORE scintillating, we've made it biro-bustingly easy to win, too! WIN WIN WIN! WITH CVG AND MINDSCAPE! We could tell you all about the game here, but you'd be better off reading the review in the last ish. Go on then! Terminators are well 'ard, as opposed to our competition, which is quite easy. WHAT DO YOU DO? Unfortunately, chief crayon-pusher Jon Billington is a bit thick, especially early in the mornings, and when we handed him some lines of dialogue from the original Terminator movie to use as headings in one of the reviews he, like a big fool, dropped them all on the floor and all the words got mixed up. Here at CVG, though, we've turned this problem into an opportunity and made the mix-up the basis of the competition! What we want you to do is identify the five jumbled-up lines of dialogue taken from the Terminator movie below, unscramble them and tell us how they should read. So here we go... ALGEDEEEEEEET HHH Easy, eh? Once you've got them all unjumbled, jot them down on a postcard or the back of a sealed envelope and send them to: 1. Night a nice walk for.

"VERDICT SUPER NES Cinando Pracom THRASH FOR CASH! So where does your Formula One career begin them? Well, with a small pot of money, access to a smart laboratory and a bog-standard car. Ahead of you lie eight tracks of progressive difficulty, from the relatively simple Moon City (like Tetbury turned on its side) through to the practically impossible White Night. Starting off with a couple of qualifying laps, you can pat yourself heartily on the back if you manage to qualify in any of the first five grid positions. As a lad, I always dreamed of owning the biggest Scalextric kit in the world. This isn't it, but it's not far off. Not the most realistic racer around, the cars seem to work more on the point-and-thrust steering method used in FZero than any Fl cars I've ever seen. That aside, this game is HARD. I mean REALLY HARD. It took a couple of hours to really get to grips with Exhaust Heat 2, and even then I just scraped my first win. It is extremely addictive though, and that's what'll make people persevere and eventually succeed. PROS: Very fast, very addictive. The promotion and lab aspects work well. CONS. This is one very difficult game to get into. GARY WHITTA WHAT STEERING WHEEL? GRAPHICS Standard SNES 3D, but so much faster! Although the other racers drive very fast, they don't always follow a true racing line. In fact, it seems they have most fun when weaving about madly trying to crash into you from all angles, including behind. Thankfully, you can tell when someone is about to shunt you by the implementation of a handy arrow which shows their point of entry onto the screen.

Here's the sequel to Exhaust Heat and it's another good 'un; as you can see here, it's pretty pictures central, but what you can't see and fully appreciate is the gameplay it's rock hard!

He may only be a youngster but Chuck Junior has already learned a variety of moves with which to rescue his beloved Pa. There are certain baddies that can't be killed but can only be avoided. Simply pull down on the joystick and Junior will stand on his club whilst the dinosaur walks harmlessly by. Not all of the dinosaurs are dangerous however. Come across a friendly one, climb on its back by pulling down on the joystick, and the dino will then take all the hits for you. And baby Chuck will have to leap over chasms, some of which are ginormous.

STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 Typical baby eh? TEETHING RINGS VERDICT ONWOOOOO  LETT M OK! Not all of the dinosaurs in Chuck Rock 2 are after you. Here's some of the helpful ones... Reggie the rock eater will gobble up any rocks that litter the path. Whack one side of a water hydrant and a jet of water will burst out of the other side, killing everything in it's path. Chuck Junior can use Susie the Spider's web to bounce onto higher levels; but be careful you don't bounce on it too long or Susie will come out and nab you. Or why not use Thomas the Turtle? Tommy sits at the edge of water or lava pools and when you step onto his back he will take you across. Chuck Rock 2 Son Of Chuck bears very little resemblance to the original, in so far as this one's actually quite good! The boring and somewhat limited figure of Chuck has been replaced with the fun and lively Junior. Baby Chuck has been given some real cartoon features to make him one of the most adorable 16-bit babbas yet seen. Obviously, gameplay differs hugely from the original and no bad thing either! But even though Chuck Rock 2 is different to its old and rather dodgy predecessor, it's still nothing more than a cutesy platform game. There are no real features to set it apart from anything else on the Amiga. Not one to be put at the top of the shopping list, but it should certainly be on it somewhere. 80 PAUL ANGLIN 72 "

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE by TAKARA .99 OUT: June. Contact Sega (071 373 3000) for information. BD0843 ing Of The Monsters was a roaring success on the Neo Geo and now it's rampaging all over a Megadrive near you! Take control of one of four towering titans and bash the balls off a gigantic opponent whilst trashing as much of the city that you're scrapping in as possible. Sounds like fun? You'd better believe it! But whether the game lives up to the heady heights of the incredible Neo Geo version is anybody guess. 150346 It's just as well we're hear to spill the beans for you now. ROWEAARRRGH! GETUR Quick, someone pass me the Waspeez! THE NEOGEO MONSTER HIT MAKES AN APPEARANCE ON THE MEGADRIVE! BUT IS IT A SNARLING SUCCESS? CRASH THE BOYS! AND BURN Pick up the joypad and take control of one of four titanic terrors. You couldn't get a more diverse crew, so here's what you can expect to be up against: GEON The bulkiest of the four monsters, Geon is the massive cross between a dragon and a dinosaur! Standing taller than a tower block, this gargantuan grappler can breathe fire and loves to get in close, gnawing opponents into submission and literally taking massive chunks out of their bodies! ROCKY Naturally Rocky's as tough as stone and runs across the screen extremely quickly, attacking with expert wrestling techniques. The Clothes Line is a favourite of this blockhead. And, by concentrating all his energy, Rocky can hurl huge boulders from his chest to flatten other fighters. The fights are spread over eight stages and four different cities. Everything from cargo ships, jet fighters, office blocks and tanks to My money's on Geon to win this grapple, skyscrapers, speeding passenger trains and the pride of Castle City, an ancient construction protected by law, can be crushed, smashed and trashed! How you do it is your business whether it's in Monster versus Monster mode, One or Two Player fun or pure Massive Destruction setting, the results are pretty much the same: TOTAL CARNAGE! Astro doesn't know what's hit him. VERDICT Asking the MD to match the Neo in the graphics department is impossible, but what really gets my goat is that nobody's even tried! The animation in King Of The Monsters is appalling, sound is monotonous and the variety of locations negligible. Everything just becomes so repetitive. Smack each other about a bit and then go for the pin. You never get your opponent down first or second go, but anything over three attempts and you should be in business. It looks like monster mashing's going to stay firmly out of MD owners' reach. Pity. BEETLE MANIA He may be the shortest monster, but Beetle Mania will scrap 'till he drops. Armed with a huge spiked horn on his head, the insect is deadly when he charges towards you. He can even shoot the spike at you when you're least expecting it, skewering you into submission! ASTRO GUY Astro's the only fighter remotely human. The huge hulk is constantly smiling, even when he hits you with his warp-speed flying kick! Astro's also armed with a powerful laser that shoots from his body at will! STEVE KEEN 74 "


"MONSTER MASH! MEGADRIVE Here's a great set of attacking combos to get you in the mood for mashing! 00340 PROS: One of the best ideas behind a game for years. Grab the big boy and hurl him forwards for a throw. Run by pressing C and then Clothes Line the sucker with B. Smack that plane, pick it up and chuck it at the baddy! CONS: The Megadrive can't handle it. Most of what made Neo KOTM a hit has been lost. 2:87 GRAPHICS Bad animation and lack of detail. Could be much better. Pick the loser up with B and throw him again with A. Celebrate in style whilst the other guy experiences real pain! Finish off the bozo with a crushing jump on the chest, A+B hurrah! Grunts, groans and mostly moans. Nothing special. VERDICT I remember when you couldn't get into the CVG games room for the absolute horde of people crowding round Neo Geo King Of The Monsters. It was always going to be a pretty impossible task for the 16-bit Sega to recreate a game designed for a machine the power of the Neo. As you'd imagine, Megadrive King Of The Monsters is a pale imitation of its big brother, with weak graphics, poor sound and unimpressive gameplay. I rapidly became bored with this title you'd do worse than leave it alone. NO HOLDS BARRED Each of the guys has his own moves and all three of the Megadrive's joypad buttons are used to the full in exasperating combinations. Everything from punching, kicking, gouging and biting to body siam, ming, knee dropping, throwing and frying is allowed. Because of the mayhem involved the city chiefs have sectioned off a large part of the town with an electrified wall that surrounds the fight and even that can be brought into your tactics! Set about your enemies with relentless ferocity and then pin them down for the three count, that's what this battle's all about! GAMEPLAY Will keep your attention for a few hours, but that's all. PAUL RAND 990000 I challenge anyone not to be bored by the fourth stage. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES ETUP ONWOOD PAUSE ) Geon takes Rocky to the limit! Double trouble for Bettie Mania. Listen to the guy GET UP! UIT POWER TO THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER HAND MISS OK HIT Get the monsters in a particularly fearsome grapple and they'll chuck up a power pill. Collect more of these and your beast will be transformed into a super-charged terror and special projectiles will change, up to two times the size! Rocky can get two rocks to shoot or even a massive boulder. All the other characters' weapons will soar up in power too! CYBORG JUSTICE: .00 Take charge of massive, selfconstructed robots in a fight to the death with other droids. Interchange parts for better weapons. More moves than you've ever seen in any other MD game. This one's totally awesome! REVIEWED: MAY '93 "


"REVIEW SUPER NES SUPER NEST by JALECO by JALECO .99 .99 On import. Thanks to Console Plus (Tel: 0532 500445) for the cartridge. Tough tactics on Vortz! 5333 3333 TEROFF Could it be true? Do we at last have a real contender to Streetfighter's crown? What arco's Blbin Jap course the wayer since Yerse! Have that lard ass! VERDICT t last it's here, a game actually good enough to tread in Streetfighter 2's magnificent shadow. What are we talking about? Why, Tuff Enuff of course! Jaleco's gigantic cart has scorched a flaming trail all the way from Japan and we've been dribbling at the gills ever since we saw early versions of it months ago. The cart's been bursting out all over the place in Japan where it's known as Dead Dance, and you'll be able to get your slice of the action when the official UK version is released over here in August. But until then, slip on your favourite reading slippers, pull up your comfiest armchair and settle back as CVG takes you to the outer limits with what could turn out to be the SF2 beater we've all been praying for! 76 SVIH ZEI KOTANO Tuff Enuff deserves to be up there with the greatest beat 'em ups of all time, in fact it's the second best game of the genre we've seen! Loads of moves that 'power-up' the further you progress and presentation that would make a Capcom executive weep! The moves are very easy to perform, although it'll take you some time to break out of SF2 habits, but once you do you'll be rewarded with a game that'll keep you brawling for months. It we dare say that SF2 is beginning to lose it's appeal then Tuff Enuff is certainly it's successor! VOXTZ 5 STEVE KEEN "


"IN AT THE DEEP END DID YOU SPILL MY PINT? Enough guff! What about the fighters? Well, easy they are not! Get a load of these specs and tremble in your wellies at the sight of their collective awesomeness! Fastest killing times are recorded! One of the best things about Tuff Enuff is that there's no messing about. You can jump straight in at the violence end and not bother with a ton of menus and settings. All you've gotta do is decide which mode you want to play in; the three on offer are 'Vs. CPU, allowing you to play against all six of the enemy fighters except for the ultimate boss, Jado. Second up is '1p Vs 2p', the traditional one-on-one combat scenario and finally, the best of all, 'Story, where you have to fight your way from the Colosseum, past your buddies and up Jade's tower, through all his henchmen, to his private chambers at the top. No one knows what the boss looks like and there's no way to fight him without going through the other guys first! Now there's a challenge! Deadly and quick. Syoh's second power-up. YOU'VE BEEN FRAMED What raises Tuff Enuff right above all the other SF2 copy-cats is that it's taken Capcom's successful formula and attempted to improve upon it, instead of simply ripping it off! One feature is the video replay the computer records the end of the deciding bout so that you can view the killing blows in slo-mo or normal speed when the action is over. You can even rewind it! However, it only stores the last few seconds, which mostly result in a tactical stand off and only one small hit being produced. Hardly exciting, but can produce the occasional gem! BEANS Could quite easily be full of wind, but the American Cyberpunk moves faster than a cheetah tied to the bonnet of an XJ220! Furious fist over fist punching, electro kicks and shocking punches are all part of his repertoire. FKT: 23secs. DOLF Another sick Libyan hell-bent on war, Dolf needs a bazooka and knife to take on the weakest of opponents. He's versatile and switches between both with ease. FKT: 24secs. REI Looks like a lass and scraps like a girl's blouse. This fop fights with Japanese clogs on and rolls balls of energy across the screen. Iron shoes are Rei's special weapon and, although slow, this warrior's amazingly unpredictable with so many specials, including flaming shield, dragon barrier, and hand of force! FKT: 29secs. GAJET One of the toughest to be found in the Tower. Incredibly powerful and fast. Thunderous fists and scorching tactics exacted with devastating damage and accuracy. Watch his sneaky double kicks too! FKT: 22secs. SIROU A top class Ninja with lightning reflexes. Sirou will cut you out of the sky nine times out of ten if you try and jump in on him. He's on of the hardest to master with his razor sharp sword and white-hot burning shield. Don't be put off using specials, they take time to perform, but they are the key to success. FKT: 24secs. SAD FOLK START HERE \"It's easy to see why you don't have a life! Still struggling with this clown? You might as well forget ever getting up to the beefy boys at the top of the tower. All you have to do to get past this guy is attack from the air with high punches. Get behind Rei and rip him apart!\" NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER GARTH \"Well you've made it to the first of the really tough boys. Gajet's the first bully to give you a real challenge, but he has a weakness, he's a sucker for throws. Get in close and paste his ass!\" AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! PAUL \"There's no denying that Jado's an awesome adversary. He's more uptight than Mike Tyson's cellmate! However, if you can leap over his head and take him from behind with devastating throws and uppercuts you'll win through eventually.\" JADO Jado, has more special moves than any character seen in any console beat 'em up. Fireball elbow, laser shot, flaming fist, disembowelling fist, fireball and fire shield are some of the deadly moves we've come up against and there could be a lot more! FKT: 7 secs. "


"TEROFF POWER TO THE PEOPLE SUPER NES Nintendo SUPER Famicom One brilliant feature of the game is the changing specials. The more thugs you defeat the greater your special attacks become! Zazi and Syoh receive huge flaming dragon's heads as fire balls and a massive deluge of blue flame for their shields, whilst Vortz's battle moves get even mightier and Kotono's knives turn into streaking red razors, amongst others! SUPER NINTENDO That'll roast his chestnuts! Go Boy! G! PROS: Brilliant effects and special moves plus fabulous playability. CONS: Slow-down on some stages and the bouts tend to be over very quickly. 7:1 *   SETTING THE SCENE GRAPHICS Excellent graphics on every stage of the game. Not bad, but a few samples wouldn't have gone amiss! DESTROYED JADO VIEW DECK Jado fights on the roof The fourth section of section of Here's the perilous path to the top. Fight your way through top and uses all the the Tower has been the coliseum, past the gate keeper and up the Tower to Jado's surrounding elements pad. Here's what can you expect to find in every room! from which to draw almost totally power. The clouds will destroyed in a war whip around you whilst and Gajet's really annoyed about it! thunder and lightning set the scene for the JADO There's no doubt it's scrap of your life! a good view through the crumbling plaster though! FACTORY The penultimate stage WOODEN of the Tower. K's has FLOOR electrified a metal grid Rei's stage is full of on the floor which he burning incense and uses to stick his flame filled robotic arms into to ornaments, but that's send out a sweeping as far as his storm of electrical meditation and energy, from which relaxation goes! there's no escape! IGURA AWE Easy to get into and the controls are very natural. TOWER'S GATE Beans is the gate keeper. His location's covered in rubble and he fights dirty! ICBM SILO D olf makes a dramatic entrance on top of a missile and springs down on you. A tricky fight, but once you've sussed his tactics it's a cinch. NINJA'S ROOM Here's where Sirou, the deadly martial artist, practices his art. The floors are padded but that's no compensation if you hit the deck! A great alternative to SF2, a definite buy! BORSE 223  STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 6 WW Crushed and defeated Syoh style! K's one mean mutha, but so's your bad ass! LLLLLLLLLLL VERDICT YOU'VE BEEN FRAMED ONWU HIT We've had this cart plugged in from dusk to dawn and it shows no sign of letting up on the action! Unlike SF2 all the moves are really easy to execute and you'll pick up the basics in no time. Dig a little deeper and you'll really release the game's true potential as a beat 'em up MONSTER! The only downer is that there're only four characters to control and two of those are more or less exactly the same, but don't let that put you off. SF2's still to be beaten, but this'll suit me until the next contender comes along. Bloody brilliant! What raises Tuff Enuff right above all the other SF2 copy-cats is that it's taken Capcom's successful formula and attempted to improve upon it, instead of simply ripping it off! One feature is the video replay the computer records the end of the deciding bout so that you can view the killing blows in slo-mo or normal speed when the action is over, You can even rewind it! However, it only stores the last few seconds, which mostly result in a tactical stand off and only one small hit being produced 90 PAUL ANGLIN 78 "

"by FLYING EDGE .99 MEGADRIVE OUT: On import. Contact Console Plus (0532 500 445) for information. NBA ALL STAR Un PROS. Excellent menu system, varied gameplay CONS Little skill involved. Becomes frustrating quickly. COLEMAN 0: 0 0 00 077 asketball can be an exciting game to watch, but is it really possible to transfer the game's playability on to a console? GRAPHICS A single view of the court, but the sprite animation is fairly realistic Ibang Distance Store NBA FAME AND FORTUNE SOUND Not much, but what there is sounds real enough. Three Point Shooting can you complete a full lap? RISE TO THE CHALLENGE! Basketball is a true test of skill, accuracy and reflexes, and the best are hard to beat. In NBA All Star Challenge you can leap into the sweaty trainers of any of America's 27 best players (one from each team in the league) and take on any of the remaining 26 in one of five games. All of the games are based on scoring more hoops than your opponent, although oddly enough there is no option to play a straight game of basketball. GAMEPLAY There just isn't enough control on your part. You can go one-on-one with an opponent of your choice, or play more interesting games, such as Horse (otherwise known as Donkey). You take a shot at the hoop from anywhere in the half, and if you make it, your opponent must do the same. Miss, and they get a letter (starting with 'H') and get to choose where you shoot from. The loser is the one who misses five times. Other games include 3-Point Shootout, where you have to fire 25 basketballs from preset positions within a minute, aiming to score with all 25. You can practise your free throws, or even set up an eight-player, one-on-one tournaDarc iek Coleman ment, should you so desire. You'll drop it in a day, thanks to the lack of gameplay. Just one of the 27 characters available for a match. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 SC TKALY VERDICT 0184 01 03 0 DEI, ONWOOOO TIL I've never really held out much hope for a realistic basketball game any sport that requires that much tactile control could never be recre ated using a joypad. This one didn't really make me think again, either. There is very little skill involved with scoring luck seems to play a big ger part than anything else. Even choosing different players seems to have little effect on your game. You can't really fault the look of NBA Basketball; sprites are impressive and backdrops are, well, as you'd expect akin to a basketball stadium. A great example of professional presentation, NBA will hold your interest for a short amount of time, but soon you'll be looking for something a little more fun. This is one game destined to be forgotten in a week. Whoops! The game looks out for any bending of the rules. MISS OK! HIT OFF THE PEG All the games can be tailored to your suiting, with options that allow you to set the finishing point, be it either on a points or timer basis, set the computer skill level or play against a friend.

"REVIEW by DATA EAST .99 SUPER NES OUT: September. Contact Data East (071 828 3201) for information. UBRE > R PROS: Easy to get into and bonus levels ahoy to find. CONS: This style of game has been done to death already. GRAPHICS Jolly and colourful, but nothing really outstanding on offer. Congo, girly and their chimp alteregos, altogether at last! Aww, isn't it sweet? SOUND The usual mishmash of inoffensive tunes and effects. Thanks, Mr Dactyl, for bringing me swiftly to this diamond-laden level! Data East go prehistoric with Congo reated by the hands that gave us Joe And Mac: Caveman Ninja, Congo's Caper journeys further into prehistory, with young Congo out to collect diamonds. Armed with a club, his aim in life is to traversing the eight-way scrolling levels which make up his world. However, out to put an end to his gem-collecting antics are a whole host of jealous Neanderthals and dinosaurs, all of whom want a piece of the action or Congo's ass at the very least. Fun for a while, but you've been there and done that so often in the past. BACK TO THE TREES Congo's world is a cross between the Adventure Island series and the aforementioned Joe And Mac. As he runs across the danger-filled lands our lad must fend off all attacks from the baddies in his quest for gems. If he fails to carry out this relatively simple task, he is sent back down the evolutionary scale to Monkey status, and one more hit after that proves fatal. Forty sovs for a reworking of an earlier SNES game is just too much to ask. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 5 VERDICT ROCK SOLID MATES Further on into the game, Congo's foes get steadily bigger, and include a huge cavern-dwelling Tyrannosaurus, but help is at hand from a band of heavily-disguised Pterodactyls which lift our primitive hero to previously-inaccessible areas filled with gems. In addition, further assistance comes in the form of little red eggs which, when hit with Congo's club, reveal either more gems or a little red sphere the latter of which will revert monkey-faced Congo to human form as soon as three are collected. ONWOOD What is it with these prehistoric game themes of late? Although very similar to Elite's Joe And Mac, Congo's Caper is by far the more enjoy able of the two games. In terms of playability and graphics, Congo is streets ahead of the Elite offering, but it is still far from the perfect plat former. The action seems a little too Taid back, and there's never any great sense of urgency in the proceedings to entice the player to the next stage. Additionally, although there's plenty to see and collect, the action itself is a little too samey, and even the addition of larger crea tures fails to add variety. I really wanted to like Congo's Caper as it certainly looks like a superior platform game. Sadly, there's very little meat on the bone. MISS OK! HIT NE PAUL ANGLIN Heads up! Or down, in this particular case if you want to keep it! 83 "


"REVIEW by TECMO by TECMO .00 .00 SNES UPOR Famicom OUT: On import. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the cart. TECMO IS OFFERING WHAT COULD BE THE MOST COMPLETE SIM EVER BUT IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL ENOUGH? W VEELMO SUPER NBA BASKETBAL PROS: Good graphics and enjoyable to play, especially in two-player mode, CONS: Basketball games have been done before, and better than this PER TERRIFIUS O SORUS GRAPHICS Nicely animated, with fluid movement even when the screen is busy. TECO TECNGs ffering more options than a Cadbury's low-fat chocolate drink, Tecmo's NBA licence aims to be the most complete basketball game released yet. A one or two-player game, NBA allows the player to compete as any one of the twenty-seven teams in the league, and also contains details on some 300 plus players from those teams more than enough info for all you trivia buffs out there. Once your team has been selected, a close-up of the team captains jumping for possession of the ball is shown before actual play begins. So get ready to slam-dunk with the best of 'em, boy! INNOS The odd squeak and bounce effect a bit like the real thing! 33 H HAWKINS RICHMOND Huh. Just when you get a good run, you lose the ball and have to run all the way back! Becomes a little too repetitive in the long term. SIDEWINDERS GAMEPLAY 000 O TENTOUL FEDO GEDD The lack of variety means that boredom will set in rather quickly. Opting for a conventional side-on viewpoint, a full five-on-five game gives the player full control over the player nearest the ball. Via the joypad's four buttons, a full selection of passes, dummies and shots are effected, including some rather nifty long shots! In addition, the game also recognises the full complement of basketball rules, and the computer-controlled referee is ever alert for signs of dodgy fouls, obstructions and players 'travelling with the ball. Similarly, if a player is on the receiving end of one too many fouls, he may have to be substituted before he comes a cropper and is suspended for the rest of the season. 14. SHHTEKLFL 51 L. JEPSE Yeah! A hoop well shot, that! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 8 H. HAWKINS Go on, Hawkins! SAY WHAT? Adding to the in-game atmosphere, smatterings of digitised speech also accompany the matches, and for those of you who feel up to attempting a full season in charge of, say, the Lakers, the cart also features a backup battery which allows you to store away your progress mid-season. ONWAUOVO 11111 VERDICT MISS OK! HIT NBA contains more than enough moves and features to keep the most ardent basketball fan content, but what it sadly lacks is variety. After all, running up and down a court is hardly pulse-pounding stuff and this proves doubly tedious when the viewpoint remains the same throughout, unlike NCA Basketball and its impressive Mode 7_graphics. There's no doubting that Tecmo's game is a very polished title and worthy of consideration by die hard Basketball fans, but casual gamers may prefer the slightly more pacey action offered by NCA Basketball.

"OUT: Now. Thanks to Electronic Arts (0753 546672) for the disks. REVIEW by ELECTRONIC ARTS _.99 MICHAEL JORDAN IN FLIGH PROS: Smart digitised graphics and fluid gameplay. CONS: It's quite boring actually. With a nickname like 'Air' you'd expect people to want to keep their distance from Michael Jordan... THREEDOM Rather than opt for the tradditional basketball format, the programmers have based In Flight on the three-on-three game. What that means to non-basketball players is three people a side, which makes for a faster game with more room for trick shots. If you're not quite up to the $12,000,000 a year salary standard, Michael's on hand with a few snippets of information. A few plays are described in the manual, but the best tactic once you've got the ball is, simply to put your head down and run like the wind. Digitised basketballers and smooth rotating court work well. GRAPHICS Neat sampled speech and sound effects. HOT PUMPING ACTION Basketball tough? You bet. This is the way to do it... Grab the ball and hot foot it to the nel, avoiding any stray doronders n the contrary, most people can't wait to get him to endorse their trainers, food, clothes and this, his latest computer game. The In Flight bit of the title refers to the fact that he spends much of his time in the air pushing balls through hoops in the most spectacular manner possible. For his first appearance in a PC game, programmers ZCT and Pacific Gameworks have teamed up with the man himself to make the game as realistic as possible. This involved getting his opinion at every stage of development and digitising thousands of pics of the man in action so he can be viewed at any angle in the game. GAMEPLAY Despite the great presentation it's not what you'd call actionpacked. Den to the alieno Mbun the balla tev times Tonally stop showing one put the ball through the logo There're plenty of better games to blow your readies on. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT NO-NWOOD The problem with Jordan In Flight is it focuses heavily on realism at the cost of fun. The rotating pitch and digitised graphics work perfectly and you can view the action in replay form from a near-infinite number of angles; but despite all its features and visual wizardry, In Flight just didn't work for me. There's just not as much action in this as console basketball games such as David Robinson's. It's the best thing out there for gamestarved PC basketball fans, but don't go out of your way to get it. MISS OK! HIT ROLL 'EM Michael Jordan's graphica aren't merely some programmer's attempt at making a sprite look like the real thing, all the animation is actually made up from hundreds of digitised frames of the man in action. For this the programmers spent ages videoing him scuttling around in front of a blue screen, occasionally pretending to dunk things. When that was done they sat down with the man himself to see what he thought needed changing. For the finished result they added these to a 3D pitch which can be viewed from almost every possible angle. 2= PAUL ANGLIN "


"MEGADRIVE by TAITO .99 OUT: On Import. Thanks to ACE Consoles (071 439 1185) for the cartridge. THE FLINTSTONES MAY BE A HIT CARTOON, BUT CAN THE PREHISTORIC PALS CUT IT IN THE WORLD OF THE CONSOLES? SCORE 001+800 03 oor old Fred Flintstone. When he finally finishes breaking rocks in the hot sun (with the help of a friendly Diplodocus, of course), does he get to sit at home and relax? Not a chance. When Fred returns to his once peaceful abode, he discovers that the place is in turmoil. Barney has lost his lucky fishing hook, Wilma has lost her favourite ribbon on the train and Pebbles has gone walkies...well crawlies anyway. And guess who's the only bloke in Bedrock great enough to save the town and get the goodies back? Yup, it's Fred. So all on his lonesome, Mr Flintstone trots off into the sunset in search of truth, justice and a lucky fishing hook! Fred has a little trouble with the first end-of-level bacay. Handy, these birds SLATE Unlike most platform games, The Flintstones doesn't give you one objective to work to for the entire game. Instead, you have to complete a different task for each level. The first in a long line of terrible tragedies to plague Bedrock is the strange disappearance of Wilma's lovely necklace and Fred's special salt shaker (oh really). Never one to let a lady down, Fred wanders off in search of the missing items. Then Barney loses his lucky fishing hook and face the terrible task of never catching another fish. Appalled by this state of affairs Fred volunteers to go and look for the item. Next on the list of ill-fortune is Betty. She's gone and lost her favourite ribbon on the train; lucky it may not be, but still, Fred decides to lend a hand in the search. The sadness goes on like this and just stops short of Fred having to search for Norma Major's lucky hairnet! LIMESTONE The end-of-level baddies are as wacky as some of the creations you'll come across in the Flintstones cartoon! You'll be up against everything from a swimming Brontosaurus to a huge dinosaur pulling a train! Some of the methods that have to be used to finish the baddies are excellent. For instance, when you fight the Pterodactyl, instead of just clubbing him over the head, you have two see-saws at the bottom of the screen, each of which has a rock balanced on it. To kill the big bird you must jump on one end of the see-saw, send the rocks flying into the air and whack the bird with them. It may sound a little odd but it's actually a real good laff and provides a little originality in the form of killing end-level nasties more of that, please. Stun the snakes then climb on them. Now that's what I call a cheap light bulb. It'll do until someone invents the bridge. VERDICT SCORE 0008600 Unoriginality abounds in The Flintstones, but that doesn't stop the game being enjoyable enough in its own right. The characters look like they do in the cartoons, and all of the enemies are well-defined. Sound isn't much cop the Flintstones theme music, for example, is an abomination but at least the game is playable and fun. And, although you might not expect it, you'll find yourself sticking with the game because you get a little further each time you play. Not a stunning release, but a jolly cart nonetheless. PAUL RAND BB vec The walls obviously haven't been Rhino-tested for thickness. "


"VERDICT MEGADRIVE When this first came in, we all swapped jokes about it having the usual assortment of one driving level, one underwater level and one level on a train, and then we turned it on, and it did! But for all it's lack of originality The Flintstones is actually a pretty good game. The graphics have been well drawn and the main sprite is a dead ringer for Fred Flintstone. There are some excellent little touches included in the game that really give The Flintstones that cartoony feel. For instance, some of the little gadgets avaialble to you are excellent. The driving level, as unoriginal as it may sound, is actually really good fun, too. The car has been really well animated, too. A good, solid platform game to add to your collection. CLAY Any NES owners out there getting slight tinges of deja vu, don't worry; we promise you're not going completely bonkers. The Flintstones did actually appear on the NES a short time ago. The main sprites look reasonably similar but the gameplay has been changed beyond recognition. Which is no bad thing seeing as the NES version wasn't anything to write home about. But at least it was better than the atrociously bad Amiga version. Grand Slam made rather a hash of their conversion of the classic cartoon the game bombed out horrendously and did the reputations of the jaunty Jurassic japesters no credit whatsoever. Oh well, eh? PROS: Clear Well drawn graphics and plenty of humour give a real feel of the cartoon CONS: Totally Unoriginal PAUL ANGLIN QUARTZ SIIHTS Well detailed sprites but not much of anything else 902.00 33 ONNOS Some nasty tunes with a pretty horrible rendition of the Flintstones tune. GAMEPLAY Uncomplicated gameplay makes this easy to get into, but it's just alittle too easy. Hey! it's Pete's Dragon! Wait a mo, hasn't this caption been a little overused of late? Everybody knows that the Flintstones is a classic cartoon, but what about other animated faves? Which is the greatest animated masterpiece of all time? Here's the CVG boys' faves: Garth: My favourite cartoon is the Road Runner. I think Wile E Coyote is the greatest of them all cos he he has all these mad, hair-brained schemes, just like me, wibble wibble. Rand: The Simpsons are the tops in my books. It's so hilarious yet so true and Homer says doh all the time Doh! Jon: I love a bit of Tom and Jerry because it's just so violent! Also it's errm...well it's...oh okay, it's just dead violent! Gary: Actually, I like Tom and Jerry as well. I'm probably their number one fan. Jon just got asked before I did. It's got nothing to do with me not having a mind of my own at all. Steve: I love any of the full-length Disney cartoons because they're so full of metaphorical meanings and if you look past the immense layer of extreme cosmetic beauty you can find a plethora of underlying philosophical meanings that can be applied to everyday life honest! Paul: There's no denying that Batman The Dark Knight is king of the TV 'toons. He has loads of money and drives like a nutter. I'd like lots of money and I drive like I'm somewhat unhinged as well. Plus it's on just at the same time as I crawl out of bed on a Saturday. GRANITE STAR these are worth 1000 points. The three difficulty settings should be enough to keep you going for some time. STAR WITH FRED. these are worth 400 points. este som har STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES WILMA Makes Fred invincible for a while. EXTRA LIFE One extra life funnily enough. Dammit! I missed. HEART Adds one more heart to your capacity. ONWAOC  APPLE Fills up one heart. ON THE OTHER HAND Phew! That was close. THE FLINTSTONES NES Any NES owners liking the look of the Flintstones should dry the tears from their eyes and get down to the shops to purchase this platform jaunt involving Fred trying to find his pet. It's nothing fancy, just a good solid platformer. 8 80 REVIEWED: CVG 131 Ooh Aah Me tootsies! 89 "

HIT The Japanese and Americans don't really understand our national game, which is why we're still waiting for a good console kickabout from abroad. Super Goal isn't a patch on classics like Sensible Soccer or Kick Off 2 and it doesn't play very much like football, but it has plenty of entertaining moments and is one of the better options for SNES owners in need of a footy fix. Unfortunately that says more about the sad state of the SNES soccer scene than the quality of this game. Surely someone can come up with something better? 062 The Scots nearly score a goal (which would make a change). GARY WHITTA "


"REVZEM AMIGA by VIRGIN .99 OUT: May. Contact Virgin Games (081 960 2255) for information. DINO DINI'S BACK IN TOWN WITH A GAME TO NICK THE SENSISOCCER CROWN! GOAL lously theventh day six days. od created the world in six days. And it was good. On the seventh day he had a rest. Which is obviously the time that Dino Dini snuck in and created Kick Off, the most amazing thing to happen to football simulations in the history of computing. But it came to pass that Sensible Software got in on the act with Sensisoccer. That was good. It also made Dino mad. So off he toddled to Virgin Games with Goal! The gamesplaying world expected more than just a re-hash of the original does the boy Dini deliver? SIGN ON, SIGN ON, WITH A PEN IN YOUR Hurrah! The sad Arsenal 'keeper hasn't a chance of stopping that! It's half-time time! Let's face it graphically, Kick Off and Kick Off 2 weren't up to much, were they. Basic sprites and flat pitches (mind you, there's not much else a pitch can be other than flat). Dino has listened to your complaints about visual blandness and spruced up the characters, which now look much more meaty they're better animated, too. Sound has also been given the treatment, and now there's a stack of extra sampled effects, the most impressive being the tell-tale thud of the ball smacking against the goalpost, announcing to the world that you're a sad man who can't stick it in the net! It's there! Hurrah! VERDICT ?????? I was dubious of Goal! when I heard it was coming. Exactly how much more could Dino Dini do with a game that many see as the benchmark for all soccer sims? I loaded it up, and found out. Goal! will have as much an impact now as the original did in the late '80s; the control system is much the same as before, but subtle additions, such as players running faster when you keep the joystick pushed forward, add so much more to the overall package. And, with the two new views, it's as if there's three different games in one! Move over Sensible Soccer, there's a new kid in town! PAUL RAND lan Wright's at it again! Is the Gooner going to miss? 92 "


"AMIGA VERDICT I'm one of the all-time Sensible Soccer fans an former Kick Off 2 addicthaving finally seen Dino Dini's latest, I have to admit he's once again done the impossible and created a game to rival the Sensible classic! There's something here for everyone, and whether you liked the Kick Off series or not, I guaran tee that you'll love Goal. My only problem is that, like the earlier Kick Off games, it takes a little while to get to grips with the controls, but once you've mastered the basics, there'll be no stopping you! Over to you, Sensisoft! PROS: Options a-plenty and for two-players you won't find a more enjoyable game. CONS: The control system is a chore to get to grips with in the initial stages. GARY WHITTA Fancy footwork, side-on. OVER 'ERE, SON, ON ME YEAD! Kick Offs control system was, and is, revolutionary. No football game previous to Dino's classic had employed a system which didn't involve having the ball stuck to the player's foot in Kick Off and its sequel, the infinitely better Kick Off 2, the ball is free to travel anywhere on the pitch. This winning system has again been employed, but in Goal!, as opposed to the previous two which made it very difficult to perform tackles without taking out the player and receiving a foul because the ball would be almost stood upon, the ball is positioned in a way that allows the opposition to steal it without taking out his man. Super animation, and generally a vast improvement over the prequel in all departments. DEDUC QUOTOONED HOONED SERHEDE TERRY BUTCHER'S ON THE DOLE! You can play in more than one perspective! As well as the ordinary Kick Off 2 view, you can also take on the opposition with the screen pulled back, very much like that seen in Sensible Soccer (this view is used to take corners and throw-ins in normal mode, but there is the option to play a full game using it). You can also flip the screen through ninety degrees and play horizontally! This option is the most impressive it totally changes the way you play the game it's like having two different footy sims in one! 201 ** OS SLEHORSE Lots of fitting sampled effects give the feeling of being right in the thick of the action. PLAVER MERE Options ahoy! THE GAME'S NOT OVER 'TIL THE FAT LADY SINGS Kick Off 2 was an excellent game, but a big gripe was not being able to tailor the teams to suit your requirements. You still can't alter stats in Goal!, but you won't complain too loudly because Dino has included over 3000 different players in the game, with the option to alter their names! Teams incorporated, include the cream of European and world sides, and each player has his own individual strengths and weaknesses making the game even more realistic. Take time out to learn the basics and you'll spend forever learning the intricacies! DONE Kit design has been updated in Goal! Even if you own Kick Off 2 you should get this it's a whole new ball game. Time for a stats check! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES ON THE OTHER HAND SUPER KICK OFF .99 Goal! Is on the Megadrive later this year, but if you can't wait that long you could do far worse than get your hands on this, the most impressive conversion of the prequel to Dino's latest and a bloody good game in its own right. The horizontal view. NONWOOD LLLLLLLLLLL REVIEWED: ISSUE 136 ISS OK HIT THE BOY DONE WELL The most radical change in Goal! compared to Kick Off 2 is the way throw-ins and corners are handled. This time around, both are catered for using the same method and it's an ingenious one. The screen displays a dotted line emanating from the player poised to take the throw/kick, and this can be altered for length and height using simple joystick commands. This system allows for far more accurate placing of the ball than was possible, certainly in terms of comer kicks which were taken using nothing more than a handful of directions. 889999555   Get ready for action...

"LREVIEWT by NAMCO by NAMCO .99 .99 | MEGADRIVE OUT: Now. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the review cart MORE ADDICTIVE THAN BREATHING 21 olling Thunder is a coin-op as old as the hills, and one of the best I've ever played. Now you can play it at home and face the awesome might of Geldra once more... PROS: Well playable, very addictive. Variety of weapons, enemies and tactics CONS: Later stages could be a little too difficult All sorts of bonuses are hidden behind the doors just have a look! RAPHICS Much the same as rolling Thunder 1, with slightly better backdrops Sad little plips and a machine gun that sounds like a cough DANGER SOUND SUSPENSE Now this is my kind of espionage. None of this 'leaving bugs' and 'mini cameras' and all that boring Mi5 nonsense. Go in with a gun, sneak through the buildings shooting everything in sight, and get to the source of the problem. Faster than tapping phones, more messy than infiltration and a damn sight more fun than a utility pen. Spread over half a dozen huge levels, Rolling Thunder 2 has taken the original idea of the balcony-leaping hero and upgraded it slightly. Instead of miles of bland corridor, you now have to fight your way through a variety of worldwide locations and beat a path to the door of the arms merchant, Gimdo. Albatross, the original hero, is available for action, but just in case you fancy a change, his more curvaceous friend, Leila, is armed and primed too. Or you can both go in at once, just to even the odds a little. GAMEPLAY Un-put-downable. Gets progressively difficult but too hard on later stages. Worth spending the dosh on. Nostalgic and very playable. As before, you are required to leap between balconies STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 98 There aren't just hoods out to get you. The dogs are dangerous, too. THRILLS VERDICT One (wo)man against Geldra is like pitting a six-year-old with a pea shooter against the Territorial Army. Geldra's men swarm everywhere, and they all have instructions to shoot first and ask questions later. Help generally comes in the form of weapons rooms hidden behind doors. Collect more ammunition and, occasionally, a more powerful weapon much needed in the face of giant robots and mad, bombing lizards! ONWA I have to admit, I wasn't quite sure when I stuck the cartridge in its slot. I was a huge fan of the original and obviously didn't want to be disappointed by a poor cousin of the excellent original game. Thankfully I was not disappointed. This game plays almost exactly like the coin-op, and retains all the excitement of the arcade thanks to very few enhancements, a bonus of sorts as the original played so well. And the difficulty level is well thought out, making the game seriously addictive its got that just one more go' feeling! OK! IIIIIIIII PAUL ANGLIN MITTUA IT "

Swords stuck in stones, loads of glorious Welsh countryside, damsels in distress, more loyal subjects than you could possibly slay in a week. Can the SNES really stand up to the challenge of recreating this classic myth? GRAPHICS ? ANNOS 78 24 As Arthur, the first thing you need to do before you pull your chopper out of the breeze block and run headlong into battle, is gather your subjects and find out what they can do. However, it seems the only way you have of testing them is to make them walk from right to left through buildings and over traps to reach an exit, employing whatever special powers they might have, such as being able to shoot, or blow things up. Mmm, it all sounds like Lemmings. However, I can't help thinking that the team behind King Arthur's World got the wrong idea. There's more to Lemmings than just small graphics. There's fun, speed and edge of the seat tension. Not slow indistinguishable graphics and plodding levels. King Arthur's World has no entertainment value at all.

GRAPHICS 52 ONNOS wo little tykes are on a mission from God. Let's hope that the Megadrive version of this arcade classic, otherwise known as Mega Twins, can do better than the previous ploppy conversions... The graphics try to be appealing, but simply-drawn characters are not automatically cute characters. The sound tries to be unique and full of character, but occasional high pitched squeaks do not overly excite the lug-holes. Yes, it plays fine, but find me a Megadrive platform game that doesn't play OK. There are so many better variants than this on the market, that this one just isn't worth considering. 45 59 Two boys were both deformed at birth by a large weight dropped on their mums. With a little help from the gods, the lads, Chiki and, erm, Chiki, are lead blindly into a quest to save their fantasy world from all sorts of marauding evil-doers.

But here's his PC debut. GRAPHICS con ANNOS SC 035819 HI 035819 SA 7  AMEPLAY M STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 22 10 00 Above: Zool's already been on loads of formats. Left: Leap, sproing platform fun! 7 T439 LIO2 SC 102861 I 182882 Zool was written with the Amiga in mind. Everything about it was designed to use all the tricks the Commodore machine could muster and so rightly earned its place as the ultimate in Amiga platform games. Trying to convert it directly to the PC might not seem right, but Gremlin has tried anyway, and they really haven't done too badly. There's no real plot or gameplay to explain. Zool is a Space Ninja that has to travel through numerous colourful worlds trying to get home. Along the way he has to do all sorts of console-style jumps and moves, and collect coins and bonuses and everything else you'd expect from a game designed to be a Sonic beater. However, on PC he just doesn't move as fast as he should, and the controls lack the necessary speed. ONWAVO ITTIT MIMI ||||||| | |||||||| 72 V IV373737 Gremlin is well proud of Zool.

VALUE 2013 Switches dot the levels, each performing a mysterious task. Will this one kill you? Pull it and see! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Helpful clues appear throughout the game and are there to give you a gentle push in the right direction. T You are a simple warrior, seeking the ultimate prize of immortality by facing a challenge layed down by the gods themselves. They have decreed that you must slay the four guardians of a city by way of proving yourself. This is not as easy as it sounds. For a start there are all sorts of creepy nasties just waiting to nip at your Achilles heel, and the complicated, maze-like layout of the city itself simply adds to what already feels like an almost impossible task. Although most of the game is action combat based, there is enough puzzle solving to keep hardened adventurers tearing at their hair, as switches need to be employed to allow you to pass dozens of obstacles and collect vital pieces of equipment. To make life easier, you can call up hints at various points, but for the most part these are so vague, they don't make much of a difference. An excellent game, converted well to the Megadrive.

"CHEAT THE COMPLETE CVG GUIDE TO ANOTHER WORnother World has been scorching the pants off Megadrive and SNES owners just lately so we though it was about time we printed the completed guide to it. And who better to do it than the person who lives in his very own world Paul Anglin. I'll step aside now and let the youngster take you through this stunning game. 102 "


"SCENE ONE The next screen is exactly the same. The next screen is exactly the same. Just run across the next screen until you get to the beast. You will automatically stop in front of him. As soon as you stop, press left on the joypad and hold it. This will ensure that you start running as soon as possible. Keep running until you get to the ledge. As you reach the ledge push diagonally up and left and jump. You will grab onto the vine in front of you. The vine will snap, so as soon as you get on it push right, and when it does snap push jump and you'll land on the floor. As soon as you hit the floor run right 'cos that beast is still after you. Eventually you will bump into a cloaked alien. He will blow away the beast for you, and capture you. That's the end of scene one. Here's some brilliant hints for this scene. As soon as you appear in the water, push up until you climb out of the pool. Move right onto the next screen. You will see a load of black slugs on the floor. To kill these walk up to them and use your kick. It's worth taking your time over this 'Cos if one hits you, you're dead. SCENE TWO the guard, the cage will drop down on top of him and kill him. The person who gets out of the cage is your friend so don't panic. He will turn to you and tell you something in Alien language. Take one step forward and crouch down to pick up the gun. Run after your friend but beware there are aliens around (remember that by holding down fire you will create a shield with your gun). When you catch up with your friend turn left left and create a shield immediately 'cos there will be aliens approaching any second. You need to protect your pal 'cos he will be tapping in a code that allows you to access the next part of the level. Put your hand through the shield and shoot the aliens. They will have also created a shield. To get through this, just hold down the fire button until a massive blue ball appears and let go. This will go straight through the enemy's shield. Remember to keep creating new shields to protect yourself. Once your companion has tapped in the code, follow him off the screen. Walk to the end of the dark passage and get on the platform. This is a lift that will begin to move the second you step on, so make sure your chum is on it as well. Pull down on the joypad to operate the lift and go right to the very bottom of the shaft. Walk left onto the next screen, there will be Once you have regained consciousness, you will find yourself in a cage with another hostage. To get out you have to make the cage swing. To do this push right and left on the joypad and continue until you get the cage swinging. When you have got enough swing and you are over 103 "


"SCENE 3 a guard. Kill him. You will see a dead end. You will notice there is a small gap going up in the ceiling with blue lights along it. Shoot at the wall and the lights will disappear. Then go back onto the lift and go up to the next level. Walk to the next screen. Charge up your gun until it gets to full power and then fire it at the door to blow it up. Walk up to the gap in the floor and pull down. This will transport you onto the lower level. There is a man trying to open three doors, but he won't be able to do it 'Cos you've blown up the power supply (that's what the blue lights were). Wait for your pal to catch up and then move onto the next screen. But don't hang around, there are aliens pushing you all the way. On the next screen push up to go to the next level and go through the first door. Wait there, your friend will come up and there will be another alien behind the door. But don't worry, your chum has got it all under control; he will open a trap door for you. Fall down the hole then roll across to the other hole and fall down that. You will find yourself in a narrow passage right in the midst of the incredible level three. Here's how to get out of it: roll left until you reach the stuff coming through the ceiling. This stuff kills you so be careful of it. Drop down a short way, now roll right until you drop down again, taking care to avoid the stuff. Then roll right until you fall again, then go left; there will be stuff falling from the ceiling on both sides of you here. Then right again and drop down. Then left and drop down. Then right. You will now be facing a blue brick wall. Walk towards the wall and the door behind you will close -and you will be lifted into the air while electricity flows around the room. When you're down walk out again. Your gun will now be fully charged. Walk out and stop before the three big doors. Blast them out of the way and get your gun charged up again. Run right onto the next screen and go down the passage onto the next screen. Kill the guy in front of you (it may be easier if you use your shield) and carry on running right.

Push up and jump to clear the spikes and then stop. Now push up and fire to jump onto the next screen. Rocks will start falling from the ceiling. This time you need to run as soon as the first pair of rocks hit the floor. Go past where they landed and then stop. Do the same with the next rock and go onto the next screen by RUNNING past the vines hanging from the ceiling. Once on the next screen run past the first set of vines then stop just at the edge of the hole. If you're not very good and keep falling down the hole then try just jumping it. Edge over to the next hole but stop there as soon as it starts chomping. Push up and jump to do a small jump over it then push up again to jump over the third hole. Walk onto the next screen and stop before you reach the vines. Quickly fire off three shots to get the vines to move back a little. Quickly jump over the first hole. Then do a big jump and run very fast. Next do a small jump over the gap in the floor and then a big jump over the last two. Walk onto the next screen and then just carry on to the next. Blast the door in front of you. Now for the fun part you've got to go all the way back again! Walk left onto the empty screen then onto the next. Small jump over the hole and a big one over the gap. When you appear on the next screen you will have noticed that the three sets of vines will have gone. Do a big jump over the first two holes then a small one over the third.

Run up the slope. A winged errm... thing should fly onto the next screen with you. Blast the bird and get it to fly onto the next screen with you. On the next screen stop quickly. At the edge of the drop do a big jump and push up, you will climb the piece of rock hanging from the ceiling, climb to the top of the rock and jump again. Carry on doing this until you are at the top of the rock on the next screen (the bat will keep the vines busy). Walk left and drop off the end of the rock. Move to the far left of the screen and turn around. Blow away the bottom of the big rock then run up it onto the next screen and jump over the two holes.

Carry on right past the next screen and the light grey area and onto the next screen after that and cor blimey, it's Scene 5 ahoy. 104 "


"SCENE 5 You will now be in a corridor, stop, you will see your friend below you crawling through a very small passage. He will get stuck. Don't worry you'll rescue him later. Walk onto the next screen and down the steps. An alien will suddenly appear, kill him and carry on walking right. On the next screen go down the steps, carry on down the steps until you are standing on a gap in the floor. Pull down and onto the ground. Turn left and fire. This will bring the aliens mate on so as you don't have to worry about him. Walk right, you will be punched by an alien as you try to go onto the next screen. He will pick you up by the throat. Push up and fire and you will kick him in the plums. He will fall over and you will drop to the floor. Run left and before you get to your gun pull down left and fire. You should roll and pick up your gun. As soon as you are kneeling down facing the alien, rapidly press fire to kill him. Move right onto the next screen. About one quarter of the way into the next screen stop and make a shield. Quickly turn around and make another shield. Firstly kill the alien on the left (because he fires more often than the one on the right). Now turn around and make yet another shield. Then kill the other alien. Walk right onto the next screen and jump into the water. Pull down and you will swim down and down. Swim to the bottom then go left...Carry on going left until you come to the two passages leading up. Go to the second passage and take a breather. Now swim right down past the upward leading passage entrance and down a gap in the floor. Carry on going down (don't worry about the spikes) and go right and climb out of the water. As soon as you are out of the water jump over the holes. Shoot the power supply (little blue lights going upwards). Then run onto the next screen and jump the holes, then jump back into the water. Swim back to where you first jumped in. Climb out on the right hand side. Run and then start jumping onto the next screen. After three jumps duck. The alien will fire a big shot. As soon as he has start jumping right again. Carry onto the next screen and stop. Turn around and edge back to the previous screen. As soon as you are there let rip with your gun and kill that alien. Now it's time to rescue your pal. Go left past the water and the other side onto the next screen. Carry on going until you come to a room with three sets of lights dangling from the roof. Climb onto the steps at the far left of the screen and turn around. Fire your gun and the biggest set of lights will fall to the ground. Now run back past the water and fall down the hole by the dead-end. The next bit needs to be done very very fast. When you land turn round and blow away the right hand side door. Now run past the next couple of screens until you reach what looks like a lift door. Facing left position yourself under the trap door in the roof. Make a couple of shields and kill the aliens that come onto the screen. Soon a hand will open the trap door and your friends head will appear. He grabs you and lifts you up. On the next screen quickly follow your friend into the tank. SCENE 6 After you have arrived in the fighting area a box will appear in the top left and corner. Using the hand press all the buttons. Eventually you will launch a load of missiles. Carry on pressing all the buttons. Again eventually you will press a button that makes you and your friend eject from the tank and fly through the air in pods. SCENE 7 A swimming pool appears with lots of naked aliens bathing in it. You crash through the roof and land on a platform. The women scarper and aliens appear and start to shoot at you. Run right onto the next screen. Very quickly make a shield and have a go at killing the aliens that appear. On the next screen your friend will smash through a stained glass window. Run after him. A gun shot will blow a hole in the walkway. You will automatically fall down the hole. A hand will grab you as you fall. You are lifted up by an alien. After being kicked around a couple of times your pal comes to the rescue. As soon as he does push right. You will eventually get to the four levels on the right hand wall. Eventually the alien throws your friend off the walkway but somehow he survives. When the Alien is in the middle of the screen press fire. A blue bolt of energy comes down and kills him. If you have only pulled one lever pull the second one and push left on the joypad. If you do this quick enough you will crawl into the beam of sunlight coming through the gap you just opened. You will now be transported upwards. 105 "

When you are close up, shoot the middle one and fly straight through. Three sets of these will appear, and then a face. Shoot it and the black hole will appear. Get to the Outer Dimension Zone by choosing course 3 (the bottom one) and, as before, fly into the Asteroid level. During the level a large Asteroid will come along. Avoid the first but blow up the second one on the right; an egg should fly out and go into the distance to hatch. A massive bird breaks and swoops towards you. Enter it and another dimension awaits.

Okay, it's whinge time this really isn't good enough, you know. Nothing but more sad RPG quezzies, and not many of them either. If you lot don't buck your ideas up, I'll soon have to be filling these pages with pictures of Steve Keen's sad flat-moving antics.

I have the Pierce collection and Plato's Lost Dialogue, but the Ward collection is nowhere to be seen. Karen Whittaker, Romford, Essex. I'm having real problems with Ecco The Dolphin. I've got to the bit where you have to swim down the chasms with strong currents pushing you up, but I can't do it; I keep getting pushed back up. What do I do? Matthew McEvay, Stockport. It's a floor down from where you are. When you get there, cover the arrowhead in the dirty wrap and use it to pry the screws out of the fallen bookcase. Lifting the case should reveal the Ward collection and the Lost dialogue. I can't believe you haven't managed to solve this one yet. Well here's the answer anyway. I'm not sure what level you mean 'cos this situation occurs on quite a few. Next to the chasm you should find a rock; just push the rock down the chasm and swim behind it. After reading your cheat for Super Star Wars (the one for loads of lives) I tried it out. I'm having real problems finding it, I keep falling off the cliff in the wrong place and dying. Could you please print a picture of where exactly it is? Scott Ode, Burnley, Lancashire. I'm having a real hard time beating the final boss on Y's. Could you please tell me how to defeat him? Craig Phillips, Wood Green, London. You're lucky. I've just got through playing this on the PC Engine Duo. Before you fight him, make sure you've got all the silver arms. Touch him and the platform will take off and fly into space. Dodge the fireballs he throws and, when you touch him, part of the floor will disappear. Start hitting him from the outside and work your way in so you don't make it difficult to walk around. This is hard to do, but it does work. No problem I've been playing Shinobi on the PC Engine for a couple of weeks now but I can't beat the Lobster. Do you know any level select cheats? Jon Skye, Bradford, West Yorkshire. Why level select cheats? Why not just ask how to beat the Lobster? Well anyway, here it is: Hold down SELECT until the words Mission 1 appear and keep it held until the screen goes blank. Now press button two to skip missions and button one to jump bewteen rounds. 110 "


"I'm stuck on Scene Four of Another World. I can get past all the chomping holes and everything, but at the bit when you have to climb along the ceiling, I keep getting had by the vines. I've tried sliding down the rock further but I just keep falling off. How do you do it? James Alimony, Portsmouth. It's perfectly possible that I'm a very sad man, but I can't find all the scrolls on The Ninja for the Master System. Could you please show me where they all are? Paul Stokes, Headington, Oxford. You're in luck sir! Not only do I know exactly what bit this is and how to do it, but there's also a complete guide to Another World on pages 102-105. So you can read that, matey! Nice one; by not telling me which scrolls you're looking for, now have to tell you how to get each and every one-ho hum. The first is on screen one kill the Ninja and it will appear. The second is on screen four-shoot the dog statue five times. The next one is on screen six, in the first Samurai house by the moat on the left of the screen. Cross the bridge and shoot the corner of the house to the left of the bush and it will appear. Next, on to screen eight; go through the entry way to the open field and shoot the last bush towards the back of the wall and there's the scroll. On screen nine, crawl up the wall, staying on the right side, then go past the rock holes and fight the boss, but don't kill him. Leave him and go to the right of the screen (almost above the far-right rock hole) and the scroll appears. Now kill the boss. On screen ten, walk along the middle of the stone grey walkway. There are bushes to the right and bushes with grey statues on the left. Go to the last grey statue, punch it three times and disappear three times. A message appears and you move onto the maze round, That's it I've had enough! This game is causing me real headaches, it's melting my brain. No matter what I do just cannot seem to get past the big plane at the end of level eight! Just what can I do? Brian Walker, South Woodham Ferrers. I am well stuck on level 69 of Pushover. Do you know how to do it or are there any ways I can skip it? Brian Hereford, Trowbridge, Wilts. I'm not going to tell you how to do it because I'm in a bad mood (Steve Keen just beat me for the first time ever on Mario Kart and now I've got to go to the shop). But I can give you the code for level 70: 19071. Ha, ha, ha ha! Excuse my fits of hysterical laughter, but this is one of the greatest letters I've ever had. Brian, this game obviously has melted your brain because you forgot to tell me which game you're playing! As I said in the intro, Brian has given me a great idea for a new section which will appear in the very next issue. And it basically involves sad letters (and I mean sad) being printed and getting a real good kicking! I won't put the boot in on Brian as he gave me the idea, but the rest of you beware. Are any of your letters going to do down in the Hall of Fame as the saddest of the sad? Then don't forget to catch Question Corner next month and find out!!! On King's Quest V for the PC, I keep getting captured by the Roc. I can't seem to escape from its nest. What are you supposed to do, 'cos I'm having major probs? Robert Hargraves, Milton Keyes. King's Quest V, eh? Well I don't mind admitting that I'm not particularly familiar with this one, but after a little play I finally managed to work it out. Before you go into Queen Icebella's castle you have to give half of your leg of lamb to the eagle. Then, when you get captured, it will automatically come and rescue you. HOLD YOUR HORSES! I'VE GOT SERIOUS PROBLEMS! I bought Twin Cobra for the Megadrive a while back now and I still can't beat the first end-of-level baddy, the tank. This is getting really frustrating what do I do? David Mills, Tottenham, London. G2G 3G allO C3 This is very sad. Well, me old mucker, there's no strategy to it at all, it's just a case of shooting it and dodging the bullets using your gamesplaying prowess. Maybe that's where you're going wrong you're probably just really crap at games! I'm stuck on Bubble Bobble for the NES. I've got to the monster that spits five missiles at me but I can't beat him. Can you help? Mr B Clough, Nottingham. Hey! We're not done yet. Anglin may have all the angles covered as far as the tips department goes, but what about all your techy problems? Who ya gonna call if you don't know your Turbo Grafx from your Wondermega? Where can you buy a special, limited edition Ranma 2.5, in which you CAN control the bosses? Perhaps you've heard mutterings on the grapevine about the new 32-bit PC Engine, but how can you find out if they're true? Well, the simple answer is to read CVG! Every month Steve Keen will be answering your most bizarre questions, calling on all his telepathic links with Japan, USA and the rest of the world and drawing in the most obscure information around. So, if you've got a question and nobody else can help, write to: STEVE SEZ: WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. Bubble Bobble? You mean people still play that? No wonder you didn't leave your real name. Well, as I said to David Mills before you, there's no set way to do it; it's just a case of aiming your bubbles correctly and dodging his. Good luck. I've just got round to buying that stunner Hellfire for my Megadrive. As I'm sure you'll appreciate, it's somewhat difficult. Anyway, how do I beat the boss on stage six? David Milne, Crawley, West Sussex. Wait until he drops his shield, then dodge his bullets and use your diagonal lasers to kill him. "


"NOT A HAPPY MAN Dear YOB I own a Megadrive. Please answer these questions: 1. What do you think of CDTV? 2. How much will SF2 cost? On the Megadrive, of course. 3. How much does the new six-button joypad cost? 4. Why is GO! so crap? 5. Why is Anglin so crap? Thanks MYANT Somewhere, Anywhere YOB: 1. I think it's worse than a slow fart on a warm Sunday in Jeremy Beadle's house with all the windows shut and the doors locked. 2. Should come in at about forty quid. On the Megadrive, of course. 3. A bit more than a bit less. 4. Because you're so sad you don't own a hand-held and a man comes round your house every day trying to make your parents fill out a form donating you to medical science. 5. Because the same bloke goes round his house afterwards and tries to make them do it too. DOH! Dear YOB, Could you please answer these questions, please? 1. When will Super Star Wars and Cybernator come out in the UK for SNES? 2. When will the CD-ROM be released in the UK? 3. Are Contra III and Super Probotector both the same game? 4. Would you recommend Super Double Dragon? ROSS O'BRIEN Co Clare, Ireland PS I think Aidan Wallace is a plonker. YOB: 1. It should be out by the time you read this. 2. There's about as much chance of the drive coming out this year as County Clare suddenly relocating to somewhere worthwhile. 3. Indeed they are. 4. Not unless you wanted to endure a slow and painful death. PS You could well be right... WELCOME to another hanky-polluting, spasminducing slice of the one and only Yob's Mailbag, stuffed from bowl to basin with the usual two-ply clingon correctors you insist on sending in thankfully my air-freshening wit and wisdom are on hand to blow off your sad and pathetic excuses for humour with my customary charm, sophistication and jumbo-size Domestos economy pack. If you reckon you're any match for the world's most knowledgeable and hilarious host, or you just want to know about games, then this is the place to be. Fire off your slightly warm and definitely unpleasant efforts to: SORRY THIS LETTER'S SO CRAP BUT PLEASE DELIVER IT ANYWAY, YOB'S TOE-TICKLINGLY HILARIOUS MAILBAG, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. Remember, there's a magnanimous ONE HUNDRED POUNDS for the best letter of the lot, and a fat man's fart for the rest... HELP! I'M NOT FUNNY Hi there YOB (or whoever is reading this), I don't know if you remember me, but I wrote to you a couple of weeks ago spouting off about this, that and the other. Well it's two o'clock in the morning and I'm a bit bored so I thought I'd send you some more scribblings. I'm sure you're familiar with (THIS SECTION HAS BEEN DELETED ON THE GROUNDS OF GOOD TASTEYOB) except wash the guys' underwear. I guess you'll have to edit this letter if you do print it, but do I care? Yes, actually. PETER 'BAZ' BAILEY Willenhall, West Midlands PS I'll be back. YOB: I wouldn't count on it. 112 "


"SADLY LACKING Dear YOB, I would be grateful if you could answer these questions for me: 1. Which game do you think is the best out of Super NBA, NCAA, NBA All Star Challenge and Bulls vs Blazers? 2. I am thinking of getting an arcade joystick for my Super NES. Which do you recommend? 3. Any news on the CD-ROM unit for the Super NES? 4. Are there any decent games coming out for the Super Scope? 5. Is there a colour Game Boy really coming out? Thanks KEVIN PARKER Wokingham, Berks PS I think your mag is really great. YOB: 1. I've got to be honest and tell you I think basketball computer games are the cackest thing since The Big E, so if you want my advice don't buy any of them. Nintendo's own basketball game, coming soon, is probably best of the lot. 2. The Capcom Arcade Power Stick is probably the best around. It's got six buttons, takes a right pounding and looks good. What more could you ask? 3. Not really. It's definitely in development, is definitely a 32-bit machine which bolts onto the Super NES and almost definitely won't come out until early next year. 4. Battle Clash isn't too bad, although generally it has to be said that most Super Scope games stink worse than my socks after two weeks and Nintendo ought to be ashamed of themselves for releasing them. UNFIT TO LIVE Dear YOB, I think you are really cool. Last week I lost my totally cool Ryu badge. After dinner my sister Claire told me that she had found it. When she gave it to me the pin on the back was broken. So please please please please please could you send me one? If you do it would mean a lot because wear it everywhere I go. I get CVG every month and it is BRILL. SHANE O'DRISCOLL Co Cork, Ireland YOB: OK, it's time to play the great YOB Answer game, in which the readers guess to choose which answer is, in fact, the correct one. Is it: a. Certainly Shane, you fine person you. b. Oh dear, Shane. What a shame, Shane. Sorry, but I can't help right now. c. Whatever next, you bloody stupid Paddy? HAVE YOU GOT BRAINS? Dear YOB, The February edition of CVG saw the last part of the Streetfighter 2 Strategy Manual. It gave you hints and tips for how to beat M Bison and I didn't fail to realise that M Bison himself was not in his own stage but in Chun Li's. I know now there must be a cheat to go M Bison so would you please please tell me it 'cos I'd be dead grateful. VINCENT WILSON Liverpool PS Can I have the .00 cash prize? YOB: The cart we used for the awesome SF2 Strategy Manual was our own Limited Edition custom-copy of the cart which, among other things, allows you to chose which boss to play, where to play him, what colour his underpants are and how many skid marks they contain. In this particular picture, the settings we had chosen from the CVG Control Panel were M Bison, China, Black and Get Those Pants Down The Launderette Sharpish Before They Walk There Themselves. I would send it to you now that we've finished with it but I won't. PS Does Bob Monkhouse make anyone Pickle laugh? EGOS SHUFFLING SHANDY MAN Yo YOB, I am probably your biggest fan, so I thought I might write in with a few quezzies: 1. Is SF2 better than Mario 4? 2. Is Joe 'N' Mac any good on the SNES? 3. I have saved up .16p which I'm going to spend on software for my SNES. What game should I get apart from SF2, Mario 4 and Bart's Nightmare? 4. Why do EA hardly make any SNES carts when they've made about 60 for the Megadrive? 5. Is an Action Replay better than a Game Genie? 6. Why are me and you so cool? 7. Is Sonic 2 better than Mario 4? 8. What is better a Megadrive or a SNES? 9. Recently I wrote to Nintendo, asking them to publish a fab game I had made up. They said write to the manufacturing Nintendo software house, but they didn't give me the address of it. As you're so cool, could you give it to 10. When will SF Turbo come out? 11. I missed issue 134 of CVG SO could you please send it to me? DANIEL JONES Yobfanland, Essex PS Print this letter! YOB: 1. In terms of sheer brilliance, they're almost exactly the same although Streetfighter wins out because there's no real end to the game as long as you're playing with somebody else. Streetfighter 2 is indeed the Greatest Game Of All Time until something better comes along. 2. Nah. 3. Get Starwing and use the rest of the cash on some new underpants you'll need them. 4. EA have decided only to convert their very best Megadrive titles and develop completely original games on the SNES. That all sounds rather damn sensible to me, so who's complaining? 5. Depends whether you want to be Sad or Completely Sad, in which case you'll be Too Sad To Tell The Difference. 6. I'm not at all sure about that 'me' bit... 7. Nah. 8. Depends which games you like and how much money you've got to spend. 9. Nah. 10. Who told you it will? 11. Nah. PS Why should I? (BOMBAT BOB.) YESSIREE! me? OBLVE UNDIES.3 Y NO! RED... 3 NO! BROWN 3 p WITH ORANGE et Piping.!\" FLOYD PARKIN 113 "


"SAD WITH UNFORTUNATE SURNAME Dear YOB, I am a poor boysel in distress and I need your help very badly. Call me a failure, or even a blob of useless pus, but it's not gonna stop me from asking my question. 1. Could you tell me how to kill the witch in King's Quest V (that's number 5) on the PC? I would appreciate it very much. 2. Can I have some passwords for Another World on the PC? 3. I think your mag is really great, but try to review some more NES games. By the way, I heard some stories about you giving 100 pounds to the best letter you print. I know that this letter is worse than a piece of puked out watermelon, but I really could use the cash. PAUL BUNT Netherland Embassy, Abu Dhabi, UAE. WORSE THAN BBC2 Dear YOB, I read the letter by Rory O'Kelly called \"To PC or not PC\" and was amazed by the ignorance shown about PC gaming. (This section deleted due to lack of interest YOB) Sorry it dragged on but it needed sorting out. DUNCAN WEST Eccleshall, Staffs YOB: Anytime... GO AWAY Dear YOB, I have a Super Nintendo and I have a few questions I would like you to answer: 1. Is there going to be a CD for the SNES? 2. If so, what's the release date? 3. What games would you recommend? JAMES GREEN Chepstow, Gwent PS Please could I have 100 quid? 1. Yup. 2. Probably not this year. 3. CD Mysterython, CD Nothingblaster, Super James Green Emptyhead Deluxe. PS I would have given it to you, but I had Bombay Bob's Rectum Surprise last night and ran out of Andrex. Sorry about that. BLIMEY! Yo YOB! Why are you such a cheesy cod slapper? Give me  before I scalp you, you scabby bandit! BENJEMIN DOCKERFACE Stanningley, Pudsey. YOB: Looks like the vet's left the cage door open again... WATER MELON MAN YOB: 1. Yes, I could. 2. No, you can't. 3. You're wrong. Your letter is actually worse than a piece of watermelon which came out the other end, so I'll only give you the cash when you can prove you've exchanged your brain. SPROU EERS Gear P LETTER DU MY PARENTS SHAVED A GORILLA Dear YOBBO, My name is Amy and I am a person (Doh!) My friend is Brooke, who is madly in love with you. (We are girls). I think you bear a resemblance to Luke Perry NOT! When I first saw your picture i continuously vomited for two weeks. I LOVE video games. I have a SNES and Game Gear. I don't know why you don't publish many girls' letters, you sexist snob, Yob. You look like something on the end of Kylie Minogue's bum. Think of that as a compliment. Schwin CDAY. YOB! p ot. B Hi, this is Brooke. Don't believe a word Amy said. She's just jealous. I don't buy your mag but Amy does and I read hers! God, it's bloody expensive. Yob, I have never seen you and I don't plan to either. I reckon YOB stands for Yucky Old Barsteward and the only good thing about you is the insults so go ahead and write lots. Me and Amy have just been looking at some old mags and read the insults. What a crack-up! If you think that's what we waste our time doing then you're a load of BEEP! (1 am a woman. God I love insulting!) I don't know why I'm writing this because you won't print it, I bet. Have fun! Love and kisses AMY and BROOKE Perth, Australia YOB: Isn't it uncanny that two people can be such good friends that their handwriting appears identical? Does the term schizo-ravingpsycho-loony mean anything to the pair of you? Perhaps you? Perhaps su you ought to have a chat and decide whether or not to go for a check up. Actually, seeing as you're both from Australia there wouldn't be much point. They'd probably make you Neighbours stars... Fosten WEE-OOH! WEE-OHH! SIMPLETON ALERT! Dear YOB, Please answer these few simple questions: 1. Is the Mega-CD a 32-bit machine? 2. Why is Rory MacCormack a fat (CENSORED YOB)? 3. Which machine do you think is best: Super Nintendo or Megadrive? 4. Please tell me the code on Streetfighter 2 for SNES to make it turn into Championship Edition. PAUL KELLY Kilkenny, Ireland YOB: 1. Ho ho ho. 2. Who who who? 3. Ha Ha Ha 4. UDRLYBANDSTARTONPOWER UPLOGOSOUND. Don't say I don't do anything for you... 114 "


"NAIL UP THE BOX QUICKLY! Dear YOB, Can you please tell me when will Streetfighter 2 ever come out on the Master System because I see it's on the Commodore 64 and it's really bugging me. And if you think that I'm a sad lad who blow-dries his bottom you've got another thing coming...you mouldy spam sandwich! PHILIP PRIOR Newbury, Berks THE TRUTH ExPOSED! Quhos DIDN'T I USED TO HAVE FRIENDS? Yo YOB! I'm Graeme Bown. I'm probably the only nine-year-old who owns a SNES and completes Streetfighter 2 on Level seven and get to the Special World on Mario AND complete it! I have a few questions for you. 1. I'm hearing a few rumours that there's going to be a game called Mario in the Fifth Dimension, where you race and fight Sonic, fight Zangief etc etc. Is this true? 2. When the SNES CD-ROM comes out, will there be a CD version of Streetfighter 2 or Streetfighter Turbo? 3. When will Streetfighter Turbo come out? 4. No offence, but Garth used to be Editor of a Spectrum mag. Why did he bother, when he knew consoles lead? GRAEME BOWN (NOT BROWN) Weymouth, Dorset PS I have enclosed a picture to give an important message to people who play Mario IV and would be glad if you print it. YOB:1. Yes. According to my sources in Japan, the game will use the incredible new BMX chip and during the game Mario spins his chin so hard he takes off into this amazing new dimension where up is down, left is right, black is blue and nobody with stupid surnames ever wastes my time again. 2. Bound to be. 3. You're the second person to ask me that. 4. So what do you think he's doing on CVG then? Doh! PS I'd be glad to. so YOB: Sadly, there's as much chance of SF2 on the Master System as there is of you avoiding a serious dose of piles unless you keep the air speed down. an POPULAR? NOT ME! Dear YOB, I love reading CVG, especially your Mailbag. You're the funniest person I've ever read since Good Omens by Terry Pratchett Here are some questions I would like you to answer: 1. Why in CVG do you never do reviews for the Atari ST? 2. Is the ST as good as the Amiga? 3. Send me . CARL PORTER Weston Super Mare YOB: 1. See Question 2. 2. Which answers question 1. 3. That's not a question. VAK FLIBBLE FLOBBLE Dear YOB, Please can I know about cheats on Nintendo NES version Super on Mario Bros and cheats onto Master System Two on the Ninja and Alex Kidd in the Miracle World. Thank you. NIKI WILLIAMS Llandysill, Dyfed YOB: You're welcome. STEVE SPILSBURY IS FUNNY CLAIM Dear YOB, Remember the chart toppers in Oct '83 ish of CVG Jetpac, Space Raiders, Arcadia and Donkey Kong? Well you might not, but I do. (That's because you're a boring old fart who will know that these games were produced BAH! NEW EANGLED by Ultimate, Atari, Imagine and Nintendo respectively Computer Games!) YOB). And in all that time I SBRING BACK THE have read this mag (ten Zx 81 ! THE BBC. 1 years) I have never felt so S ACORN! OH YES.. BLAH. compelled to write until now. The article in question is: PC Engine The One That Got Away. I am 24 and in my time have had a Vic-20, Megadrive, BBC B, SNES and a Turbo Duo. I treated myself to a Duo in November of last year from my local dealers KONG Console Concepts and to open this month's mag and see that article was just too much. I had to write and say why don't NEC get their act together? Don't they think that the British public need the Duo (Mega-CD ha ha ha). Keep up the good work and long live Paul Anglin. STEVE SPILSBURY Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs. YOB: Is everyone over 20 a time-hardened lump of horse cack or is that what living in Stoke-on-Trent does to people? DONKET THREE IMBECILES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE Dear YOB, I have been reading CVG for a long time now. I hope you are impressed. ALEXANDER PATTERSON, JOSPH ELLIS and EDMUND BAKER Diss, Norfolk. YOB: Did you take it in turns writing this one letter each and lowest IQ gets to lick the stamp? Is there any point to any of you at all, or am I just hallucinating when I see you all sitting in your high chairs with big spoons and chicken and banana flavour baby food, failing to get any of it into your mouths and screaming that your nappies need changing?

"STEVE SEZ: WWA's Your RBIEM: SPEEDY PC I've got a 386 PC and I've heard about 486s. What's the difference? They've both got similar speeds between 25 and 33Mhz. John Wilson, Bexley That line is just one of the quirky things that all Megadrives do. There's no way to get rid of it and it plagues every Megadrive owner, so just forget about it. JOYSTICK JAPERY Can I use Amiga Joysticks on my Megadrive, because I don't like the Sega joypads? Julie McVitie, Liverpool Basically a 486 is much faster than a 386. Although they have the same speeds, the 486 has got a much faster processor. It's a bit like a taking a Mini and turbo charging it, giving it a fuel-injection system, gas-flowing the cylinder heads and adding gofaster stripes. It'll then go as fast as a Porsche but it'll be a real strain. The Porsche will take it all in its stride. Nope, only joysticks specifically designed for the Megadrive will work. If you're that sick of joypads, Sega has just released a rather excellent stick which costs a mere .99. SUPER SONIC CARTRIDGE CALAMITIES Please could you answer some questions about the Mega CD: I read that using those universal cartridge adapters on my SNES which take two cartridges could blow a fuse in my machine. Is this true? Robert Croft, Dudley 1. Because of the new chips, is it better than the SNES? 2. Can the Mega CD run CD-I games? 3. Will Sonic be coming out on CD? Mat Johnson, Shropshire There's been a lot of debate about this, but as far as I know, you can't blow your SNES that way. Obviously it's best to use games released in the machine's country of origin, but we've had no problems with our adaptor. GENIE-US Can using a Game Genie or Action Replay cartridge damage my games? My friend reckons it can, but I think he's wrong. Peter Bryant, Acton 1. It's unfair to compare the two machines as cartridges can't hold as much information as CDs but it's really down to the games rather than the machines. This month we review Final Fight on Mega CD (page 48-50) and it's the hottest Sega CD game we've seen and a good reason for all Megadrivers to upgrade. 2. No. CD-I is Phillips' compact disc machine which uses software specific to it. 3. Super Sonic is due to be released in Japan any week now. As for the European release date, Sega is staying tighter lipped than Roy Castle in a kipper shop! Using a cheat cartridge won't damage your games, as they work by altering the information that is stored in the machine's memory rather than the data on the cartridge's ROMs. Want to plug your SNES into your mum's huge TV? Got a stupid brother who's busting your carts? Confused about converters? Worry ye not! Steve Keen's had all these problems and many more! The only difference between him and you is that he's sorted them all out and is now at one with the technical universe. Oh, he's also six-foot-one, an expert in Judo and leads a full and active social life... POWER-UP I've got an Amiga 600 and I'm thinking of upgrading to a 1200. Are there any games specific to it and will my old games work on it? Bob Sloan, Berks LINE OUTS When I play my Megadrive on a TV I get a line near the bottom of the screen. Does this mean there's something wrong with my machine? If not, how do I get rid of it. Richard Simpson, London Apart from the odd title such as Zool and Wing Commander there aren't any games specifically designed for the 1200, but there are loads of games which work better on it. Many companies are now developing software with 'enhancements on the 1200, as 120 "


"0 00 00 00 the machine outsold all Commodore's other products over Christmas. As for specific games, there are whispers and rumours, so keep an eye out for a batch of 1200 reviews in CVG some time in the next six months. Championship Edition and Sega is also releasing a special six-button joypad. Incidentally, the new Megadrive ll will come complete with these new pads. sure that he'll let you use the telly to watch Richard and Judy on Good Morning). 2 00 00 00 AMIGA/ATARI CONUNDRUM SCART-ALOGICAL I've just got a new TV with a SCART socket, and as my Megadrive has a compatible output socket, I was wondering whether it would be better to connect it this way. Daniel Leary, Rochester SEEDY IMPORTS I've just bought a British Mega CD and I want to know if Japanese games will work on it. James Hartley, Suffolk I'm thinking of buying an Amiga 1200, but was reading about the Atari Falcon and now I'm not sure which one to go for. Which one would you recommend? Alan Davies, Fleetwood switch your console off before removing the cartridge, otherwise you risk a power surge, thereby damaging the machine as well as the cartridge. No they won't. Sega has built a protection chip into the European Mega CD which scans discs for a specific piece of code. If it doesn't find it the game won't run. Definintely use the SCART socket! You'll get a much clearer picture and far better sound with SCART as it keeps each signal separate, whereas a TV aerial lead has them going down only two cables. EMERGENCY SURGERY MONITOR THE ACTION Each machine has its merits; in the Amiga's case, it's actually available. Technically the Falcon is the superior machine when it comes to sound and graphics and it also has a faster processor, but it lacks the custom chips of the Amiga. If you're after something mainly for games, the 1200 seems your best bet, simply because of the amount of software that's in the pipeline. CARTRIDGE CALAMITIES Is it possible to damage a cartridge by pulling it out of the machine without switching it off? It's just that I was playing Mario Kart with my brother and won, so he ripped the game out now when I plug the game in it just doesn't work at all. Please help. John Harris, Bolton When I switch my Megadrive on the picture comes out funny. I can eventually get a decent picture by hitting the corner where the cable plugs in, but I don't think that's good for the machine. Name and address not supplied CONSOLE YOURSELF Is it true there's going to be an Amiga console? If there is going to be one, will it be CD-based and will it be much better than the Sega Megadrive? Barry Stradler, Wilshire It sounds as though you've got a loose connection in the TV modulator or your lead is damaged, so it'll be cheaper to try a friend's lead first to see if that's the problem before sending your Megadrive anywhere. Your brother has well and truly knackered your game. Always   |  I want to buy a PC so I can play games like X-Wing, but they cost too much money with monitors. Is it possible to run them through a TV? Also, I own an Amiga 1200 and was wondering if there are any PC emulators available for it, and if so, are they any good? Stephen Ashby, Aberdeen There is going to be an Amiga console in the very near future, although Commodore is being really cagey about its technical specifications. We'll let you know exactly what it's all about as soon as we have some more info. DR.STEVE You can't run a PC through a TV because the screen can't handle the resolution of the graphics. As for PC emulators for the 1200, there are some in development, but once you buy the emulator you'll also need to purchase extra memory, a hard drive, video card and high density disk drive, so you're probably better off buying the real thing. TV HELL My mum won't let me play my SNES on the big TV in the living room because she reckons it'll bust the screen. I say it can't but she doesn't believe me. Tell her she's wrong so that I can have some wide-screen action. Paul Tunstal, Newcastle Never fear, Captain Keen is here, complete with underpants over his trousers! Our boy Steve is here to answer all your little questions about your games playing kit. So what are you waiting for? Ask away! Got a problem? Do you think that newspapers talk a load of old cobblers about computer games? (We do!) Not quite sure how to get the best out of your console? Confused about converters? Then it's time to pour your heart out to Steve Keen the agony uncle with attitude and a screwdriver. Scribble down your problems and send them to: STEVE KEEN'S GOT SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT ONE OF MINE WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?, CVG Towers, Third Toilet on the Left, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. Steve can't promise to answer all your queries. Especially if they're crap ones. MLAR SIX-BUTTON MAYHEM What's all this talk about Streetfighter Championship Edition coming out on the Megadrive? I own a SNES and reckon it can't be done for starters the joypads don't have enough buttons. Name and address not supplied Mrs Tunstal, you're wrong. Consoles and computers can't damage normal TVs, although they can cause problems with projection TVs, but as nobody owns one it's hardly worth mentioning it. So just cut out the amateur dramatics and let Paul use your television for what it was really meant for! (And I'm Nyarrgg! I've heard this one more times than Paul Rand's had dates with top girlies.

Getting the money means falling in with a seedy crime organisation and stealing some of the most valuable artifacts in the cosmos. It sounds like serious sci-fi, but the game's a comedy a cross between Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the Carry On films so expect plenty of rude jokes. \"One of our artists has done illustrations for Penthouse and Mayfair, which is a good qualification for this type of product,\" say the team. As well as spanning three whole planets, Innocent Until Caught is claiming to be the most technicallyadvanced graphic adventure yet, with a super-intelligent point-andclick interface, eight-way scrolling and a revolutionary character interaction system.

It's also due out in July, so look out for a review soon. SUMMER RELEASE Wiz'n'Liz: Two wiza WIZ'N'LIZ SUMMER TRODDLERS FINO which, despite many criticisms of being just a Lemmings rip-off, emerged as one of the best games of '92. Now, like most successful Amiga games these days, it's on its way to the Super NES in the form of a straight conversion that should please anybody bored of the neyerending stream of platform games and beat'em-ups. Troddlers sounds a lot like Lemmings on paper, but in fact it's got a gameplay style all of its own. In each of the 175 levels the player has to fulfill his mission objective it might be to rescue a certain number of the innocent Troddlers or fight the Troddler-killing zombies or pick up a certain number of special bonuses. Whatever you have to do, the rules the remain the same your on-screen character has no direct control over the Troddlers, but can influence their actions by dropping blocks and other obstacles in their path to make them do what you want. On each level the action takes place on a single boxed-in screen, with the Troddlers able to walk up the walls and even shuffle upside-down across the ceiling! Extra fun is to be had in the simultaneous two-player mode, where contestants can either work together or battle it out for the most points by destroying each other's precious Troddlers! It's frenetic stuff and bound to be a hit with RELEASE SNES STORM SUMMER $44.99 .99 Hot on the heels of Lemmings come another gang of helpless (and rather cute) little men who need your help to save them.

MEGA DRIVE PSYGNOSIS  .99 More arcade action is hot-footing its way towards the Mega Drive but this one's a little different to the rest of the action carts you'll find on offer this Summer. For a start there are NO in-game baddies to battle at all! Instead, Wiz'n'Liz pits you against the clock on a quest to collect rabbits from a series of magical landscapes. The story goes that since the two powerful wizards Wiz'n'Liz bought a pair of rabbits to keep them company, the floppy-eared friends have up again before they perish. It's a high-speed collect'em-up like no other, is Wiz'n'Liz. Playing against the clock is fun, but Psygnosis reckon the real laughs will be had in the split-screen two player mode, where Wiz and Liz compete against each other to snatch the most bunnies in the time allowed. With over a hundred magic spells to help you through the 56 levels and a host of exotic sub-games, Wiz'n'Liz promises to be at least one of the most frantic games of 1993. The Mega Drive Look!

YOU'D BETTER BE, BECAUSE ACCLAIM IS SLAMMING INTO THE SUMMER WITH THE WWF WRESTLING GAME TO END THEM ALL. GARY WHITTA GIVES YOU A RINGSIDE COMMENTARY... he popularity of the World Wrestling Federation may be on the wane in America, but over here in Britain it's going from strength to strength — would you believe the WWF record album is in the Top Ten and climing as we write this? And with Hulk Hogan recently making a much-hyped return to the ring after mysterious leave of absence, what better time to celebrate with a new WWF game than right now? Like Wrestlemania, and The Survivor Series, the Royal Rumble is one of the biggest events in the WWF calendar, bringing all the major superstars together for a big-time brawl to decide the new Champion. As you've no doubt already guessed, Acclaim's new game is based around that very tournament. WWE ROYAL RUMBLE DADDY RUMBLE The Royal Rumble hots up... ...geting tougher all the time... Look out behind you, Randy!! Every one of 'em a baddy. TONIGHT'S MATCH! Most (if not quite all) of your favourite WWF Superstars are taking part in this Royal Rumble, made up of a selection of new and old characters. There are a total of 12 in all — Ric Flair, Shaun Michaels, The Narcissist, Yokozuna, Razor Ramon, \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, Randy Savage, Mr Perfect, Crush, Tatanka, Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart and The Undertaker. Only the immortal Hulk Hogan himself is notable by his absence... One or two players can step into the boots of their favourite grappler in a variety of different matchups — there's the usual one-onone bout, two or three-man tag team brawls and — the daddy of them all the Royal Rumble itself. In this gargantuan battle to end all battles, up to eight Superstars climb into the ring for a free-for-all punch-up with no referee to maintain law and order. The object of the bout is simply to throw all of your opponents out of the ring, with the last wrestler left standing inside the squared circle declared the winner. Oof! Savage chins Flair.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? We have to admit we don't know very much about Sculptured Software, the team behind WWF Royal Rumble, because they live in America and Lord EMAP won't pay for us to use the phone the rotten old sod. But what we DO know is that the programmers behind this game are the same team who are also producing the Super Nintendo version of Mortal Kombat for Acclaim this Summer! If WWF is anything to go by, we should expect something very special from MK in a couple of months! (By the way, for more hushhush Kombat info, flick to page eight of this month's News section). GRAPHICS There isn't much more work to do, since it's nigh-on complete already and is just waiting for the go-ahead from Acclaim. But the graphics are a treat our WWF fans were able to identify the characters with ease, which gives you an idea of how good they look. PERFECT? WWF Royal Rumble is Acclaim's first ever 16Mb cartridge and it shows. From what we've seen so far, it could well be the most authentic and playable WWF outing so far, featuring super-accurate wrestler sprites (and sampled renditions of their theme tunes), some gorgeous animation and more moves than you can shake a stick at. Each wrestler has their own trademarked \"finishing move\" (including The Undertaker's fatal Tombstone and Mr Perfect's unbeatable Perfect Plex), and the sight of eight wrestlers grappling in the same ring in the big Rumble has to be seen to be believed! Look out too for guest appearances ONNOS Sound effects will be big and beefy, with lots of grunts and groans to add atmosphere to the action. Each wrestler's tune (like Macho Man's \"Land of Hope and Glory has been converted faithfully to the SNES, so WWF fans should be well pleased.
