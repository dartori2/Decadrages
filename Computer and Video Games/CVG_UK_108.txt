"0:36 z CREDITS: 2 DOMARK'S COIN-OP CAPERS Domark have just announced they have grabbed the licences to four new Atari coin-ops, to be published on the Tengen label during next year. The four are: Skull and Crossbones (a pirate adventure), Hydra (RoadBlasters on water), Thunderjaws, and RBI Baseball II. As far as Atari's newest coinops, Pit Fighter (a beat 'em up with digitised graphics and sound for added realism) and Race Drivin (the sequel to Hard Drivin', with new tracks and cars) are concerned, check the pics out on this page. No news of those being snapped up yet, but you can rest as sured we'll keep you informed. ACTI-VISIONS THE SUN MATERIAL SERM   EART  Before they depart our fair shores, Activision have announced the release of two of their last UK-sourced products, both of which are 16 bit. Hunter is a weird but impressive 3D adventure in which you have to walk, swim, sail and even windsurf around an archipelago of islands in the search for a missing person. Deuteros (pictured) is the sequel to that successful strategy game, Millennium 2.2, by the same author, but with many improvements over the original and even more depth. Watch out for reviews in the next couple of months. From next year Activision will be concentrating on marketing their American products, and their first such releases will be two Nintendo games, Rad Gravity (a cartoony sort of arcade adventure set in space) and Ghostbusters II (a shoot 'em up based on the film of the same name). We've had an early look at both of them, and both of them look peachy-keen, but, again, for the final verdict check out the reviews in C+VG early in '91. COMPUTER SHOW OR MOTOR SHOW? @ CHCETITION TOP SHOW PRIZE With the amount of motor cars on display at the CES show, you could have easily been fooled that you were walking around a motor show. Resplendent on the US Gold stand was a brand spanking new Lamborghini (why, we don't know) and Gremlin had a large, shiny red Lotus Esprit SE (to tie in with their license see the review later in TV PRIZES WERE YOU THERE? For those of you that missed last month's CES at Earl's Court, where were you? We were there, and so were those wacky Turtles, along with RoboCop, Frank Bruno, Esther Rantzen, Betty Boo and many others (where were Iron Maiden? Rob). Amongst many of the events happening was the International Video Game Championships (see the feature later in this ish), as well as Gremlin's Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge, with a massive two-seater console and steer ing wheels!

A NASCAR automobile was gracing a distributor's stand to promote Mindscape's Days of Thunder and there was also a rally Porsche, just parked by the main stage what that was rep. resenting is anyone's guess Show trivia fact: the most valuable single item at the show was Kevin Schwantz' Suzuki bike worth a cool ,000! whole bundle of other neato stuff. They also had a gob-smacking F15 Strike Eagle coin-op on the stand, set on free play! This caused large amounts of chaos, especially when we tried to get Richard off the flippin' thing check the pic out! (I don't care, I was enjoying myself! Rich). THE HAND...

They've already signed up with Sega to release three titles for the Master System the brill PacMania, Shadow of the Beast (ooh!). and the mega God-sim, Populous!! Quite how Tecmagik intend to cram all of this fantastic loveliness into the SMS is yet to be seen, but according to their PR person, Nikki Hemming, all three should be out some time next year, and \"should be nothing short of amazing\". We reserve judgement on that, but all the same, it should be rather interesting, eh? Remember Stavros Fasoulas? The C64 wiz behind such classics as Delta, Sanxion and Quedex? Well, after his stint with the Finnish Army (doing his National Service), a period of body building training, and writing a science fiction novel, he's back on the programming scene, and is now in the middle of writing a brand-new shoot 'em up for the Amiga! He's not giving any details away at the moment, but you can bet your bottom dollar that it's bound to be nothing short of amazing As soon as we have any more info on it, you'll be the first to know After reading our review of the superb Plotting (which received a whopping 94% in issue 106), those lovely people at Ocean took the hint, and are now re leasing versions for the Spectrum and C64! Due to be released any day now, Plotting should be .99 for both machines, so keep your eyes on the Updates section for a review. That's C+VG for you a force to be reckoned with! "

"POKER THIRD LAST NINJA USING 2E DUDDDD After the phenomenal success of Last Ninja and Last Ninja ll on the 8 bit computers, System 3 are now about to unleash Ninja Remix and Last Ninja III. Ninja Remix is aimed at the new gener ation of C64 owners, and although the actual game is exactly the same as Last Ninja II, the music on all seven levels has been remixed and an enhanced status area and an exciting film-like animated intro\" have been added. Remix will be available for the C64, Spectrum and Amstrad real soon, for .99 cassette and .99 disk so keep reading the Updates section for a review. Meanwhile, Ninja III is set in Tibet, where five shoguns are terrorising the population with their mystic powers. Once again, it's up to Mr Ninja to sort the problem out in his usual puzzle-solving, butt-kicking fashion. This latest instalment has been put together by Robin Levy who was one of the team behind Thalamus' scintillating shoot 'em up, Armalyte, and his superb graphics make Ninja III look something really special as you can see from the screenshot. However, there's always a price to be paid for quality and Ninja III will be appearing on cartridge only (so it will be compatible with the new Commodore C64GS console) priced at .99! This means no long-winded multiloads, and much to System 3 boss, Mark Cale's, satisfaction, a decreased risk of piracy. Other companies seem to concur with this strategy, one example being Ocean, whose Commodore version of Special Crimi nal Investigations will also be cartridge only! NO MORE MEAN MACHINES?

Ed), because at last The Stupendous C+VG Challenge has arrived! We thought we'd get the ball rolling this month with a full report on the recent International Computer Games Championship, which took place at the Earls Court Computer Entertainment Show on Saturday, 15th September. The likeable rogues from C+VG were there and actually made up a sizeable contingent of the US Gold-sponsored British team. THE UK LINEUP Managing Ed, Julian Rignall, took the role of team leader, and he was to be assisted by his C+VG colleagues, Richard Leadbetter and (at the last minute) Robert \"The Beard Swan. Last but not least was Simon Hadlington, the man who proved invaluable during last year's competition in Paris, and was to prove equally key to the team's performance in the 1990 championship. THE COMPETITION The competition was provided by teams from the USA, Italy. Man of the Match! Fabio and France, each with four members. However, when the Rossi, so happy he competitors assembled on Saturday morning the French wears his cap the wrong team, backed by Infogrames were nowhere to be found! way round! A boy scout runner was dispatched to the Infogrames stand only to discover that it was all closed up! The entire team and Infogrames staff had brown-trousered themselves and run off! What a load of onion-and-silly-stripy-jumper-wearing, garlic-'n-snail chompin', sheep-burnin' cowards! GAME 1 COLUMNS With half the opposition out of the way, the teams set to work on the British game choice, Megadrive Columns, in which each player had to go for the highest scores in the three minute timed game. A further complication arose when it was discovered that the processor in the Italian Megadrive was running faster than those in the other machines, so their on-screen timer had run out about half a minute before the others! A replay was demanded and the Italians came away with respectable scores. However, they were no match for our brave Tommies, who had been practising furiously, though, and Julian and Simon clocked up the top scores of 18,166 and 16,213. The Italian team took third and fourth place, leaving the American team (sponsored by US softco, Accolade) to bring up the rear. But they were about to play their Joker, because the next game up was their choice the Amiga version of Accolade's own Test Drive II. GAME 2-TEST DRIVE II As the disk booted, and the Italian team complained about the sandwiches, the British team discussed tactics. Only Richard had played the game before, but he rubbed his hands gleefully when he discovered that the competition was to get the fastest time to the first gas station. \"There's only one bend to worry about,\" he told his team-mates. Armed with this vital info, the Brits got ready to drive all over the opposition. But! Another false start! In a fit of nationalistic fervour the Italian team had chosen to drive the Ferrari F40, instead of the rather slower Porsche 959 which the \"sh per We UO.GOLD "


"ALLENGE CHAMPIONS! Hurrah! and Hurrooh! After trouncing the French and Spanish teams in last year's European Championship the British team proved they're world-beating gamesplayers! Each team was ushered up to the stage to be congratulated by the outstandingly famous stars of Grange Hill, a slightly less famous Cock ney comedian (whose name eluded everyone), and of course the vast crowd of show-going punters who had gathered around. After a rousing chorus of Land of Hope and Glory, everyone held matches in the air and began to sway with patriotic passion, and the team marched boldly off-stage to collect their prizes, and think of next year... LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE OLD SCOREBOARD.. And so the competition was over. Each team's top two scores on each game were noted and each player was allocated the following points according to his score. other teams had been told to select, giving them an instant speed advantage. With that problem corrected, the teams took off over the highways of California. The American team turned in some formidable times, and all their players finished the course in ust over 51 seconds. While the Italians seemed rather flummoxed by the game, the British lads soldiered on, and turned in two mediocre times after some catastrophic overtaking, then Rob ruined a potential winning run when he forgot to slop in front of the garage and ran out of fuel! \"Why didn't anyone tell me?\" wailed the bearded one. Luckily, Simon was learning from the mistakes of his compatriots, and he finished the race in the fastest time of all, beating the best American time by 0.2 seconds! GAME 3 E-MOTION Following a short lunch break, the teams reassembled to take on the final game of the competition, US Gold's E-motion, which had been chosen by the Italian team. Little did they know that both Richard and Simon were experts at the game, and during lunch they had been trading various secret bonuses and time-saving ricochets. Unfortunately, the American team had been watching over their shoulders and were soon practising the same tricks themselves! Each player had three minutes to get the highest score in this final round, throughout which the screaming compere who just happened to be Larry Sparkes, ex-marketing manager of Activision UK) continually exhorted the players to 'show some EMOTION!\" while the players continually whispered rude things about him under their breath. \"Come on! We want the numbers!\" he yelled into his failing microphone. Experts have yet to decipher this. With Larry Sparkes waiting in his ear, Richard wasn't doing too well, and he was forced to quit the game and restart three times, losing him a minute of time! But on the fourth game everything seemed to click, and he suddenly began romping through the levels with pinpoint accuracy, collecting special bonuses at every turn, and finally finishing the game with a heat-winning score of 41,250! However the best was yet to come, and when Simon stepped up for his heat he showed himself to be a true E-motion maestro and knocked up a vast score of 69,950. which was far and away the best score of the round! Fresh from meeting the cast of Grange Hill, The champions pause only for posing!

NIC TIIIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 This follow-up to the first Rotoscape game, Rotox, is far and away a better game. The actual rotary movement has been expanded to be able to zoom in and out, adding that extra dimension that Rotox lacked. The gameplay itself is involved and, above all, interesting. There's always something to keep you occupied, be it an enemy squadron or actually seeking out and annihilating the mission targets. My only gripe is that the Harrier is rather sluggish to control, and death is never far away. The graphics (a mixture of polygons and sprites) work very well indeed, but the sampled sounds, though functional, could not honestly be described as exciting.

"ADVERTISEMENT ( Just what a game should be: looks good, 99 sounds good, and plays like a dream. Chris Morley, ACE, October 1990 ACE RATED By Graftgold RETED 936 936 The 3D vector graphics system in Simulera features solld filled 3D graphics with shadows and light Intensity surfaces. The system allows solid and wireframe surfaces to be freely mixed. Stipple and transparent/semitransparent surfaces are also employed. The game code runs up to 252 non player objects on the map. The game cycle rate and the view cycle are Independent so that game time can be kept more or less constant even if the display rate is slowed down. Special explosion effects are achieved using a highly efficient particle controller that individually moves up to 100 particles. Definitely a game that goes with a bang! Simulcra uses a grid-based map similar to Virus but Includes 'blank' squares, Introducing ground-based and flight action To add variety to an already exciting game, Microstyle have thrown in a wide variety of enemies. First, and most common, are the laser turrets that slowly sweep in a complete circle until they lock onto you, whereupon they fire vlclously. Various ground and air attack craft, such as Jeeps and small tanks, race around the walkways, thankfully needing only one shot to kill. Then you reach the megatanks these can only be killed with missiles, but when shot axplode in the most satisfactory way yet, by first ejecting the gun turret and then collapsing in on MICROSTYLE hurl you into the themselves with a forrific sound effect.

Just what a game should be: looks good, sounds good, and plays like a dream. Here at MicroStyle we couldn't think of anything more to add to Chris Morleys' review for Octobers edition of Ace. The Simulcra is verging on the awesome, conjuring up immediate comparisons with the classic Virus. Your SRV rotates 360 degrees and can fly or drive. The rotation and shading are excellent and the game has a great feeling of speed, Battle is fast and furious and you can power up the SRV with loads of goodies including speedups, radar, fire and forget missiles, target display systems, shields, and extra lives.

"AMIGA BY ACTIVISION REVIEW IIIIIIIII GREE PRUSED: AME PAUSED A Our hero bites the bullet! N ow that Activision are closing their UK programming arm, this translation of UPL's coin-op looks like it will be one of their last arcade conversions, with the fate of R-Type II currently hanging in the balance. In Atomic Robo Kid you play the large-nosed cybernaut, who seems to be pretty unpopular amongst the inhabitants of this part of the galaxy and he is constantly beset by hordes of alien beasts out to fry his circuits. In such circumstances there is only one option openblast 'em out of existence!! Every so often power-up crystals appear, giving Kid additional speed, or one of four powerful weapons a mahoosive laser cannon, which fires large bursts of atomic energy, a three way needle laser, atomic missiles with a large destruction radius, and a five way beam cannon UPDATE Robo Kid will be blasting his way onto the ST, Amstrad, C64 and Spectrum real soon.

TOMIC RUBU WALA A Triple laser death annihiTI I III lates the opposition! AMIGA .99 Atomic Robokid didn't exactly set the arcades on fire when released, but was still a fun shoot 'em up to play, with jolly graphics and sound. Now it's on the Amiga, and pretty much the same story applies. The graphics are frue enough to the coin-op, with some Fan-cy that! RoboKid very nice sprites and bites the biscuit! backdrops, but the parale iOS lax-scrolling screen chugs along a little sluggishly, and the action slows down noticeably when the screen fills up. The sound is what you'd expect from a game of this nature (boom, bang, etc), and is nothing to write home about, although the title music is pretty swish. Overall, not a bad game, but it's overpriced and the aboveaverage skill level makes it a no-no for novice blasters. If you're up to it, take a look, but don't expect too much.

BUG BASH & NUCLEUS MICROTEC ENTERTAINMENT L ere's a novelty: two original Amiga games sold in a double pack for thirteen quidlets! Of course, it doesn't matter how many games you bundle together if they're all a complete sack of dung, but here Microtec Entertainment have come up with a couple of corking quality numbers. Bug Bash may sound like a game with Centipede overtones, but you actually end up with a horizontally scrolling (as smooth as a coin-op) garden-based blast 'em up. Beautiful graphics and bril liant sound tracks add loads to the trash collecting mayhem. This game could sell on It's own for thirteen quid 1 kid you not! After the smashing Bug Bash, Nucleus is a tad disappointing. Best described as a game with definite R-Type overtones, it has totally groovy sonics and slightly cluttered graphics, but unfortunately the scrolling's a bit too slow as is the firing rate of your ship, and the collision 70 "

The visuals are great, especially the moonwalking, spinning, grooving-around Michael sprite. The smart bomb feature is hilarious, especially when it's powered right up so that the bad guys start boogying to the relevant tune before going splat! The music is what sets Moonwalker head and shoulders above other games of this type the sound. Noteperfect renditions of Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, Bad, Thriller, Beat It and Another Part of Me thump out of the speakers, and the inclusion of various howls, oohs and other Jackson-type sound effects add further to the atmosphere. My only niggles are that the gameplay itself is rather simplistic (climb around the platform, blat a few nasties, rescue the kids) and a tad repetitive, and the level six space shoot 'em up is a bit of an anti-climax, but the audio-visual aspect more than makes up for this.

Apart from the computer opponent, the game is the same, and to my mind it was the interaction between real people that accounted for a good deal of the board game's appeal. The computer version is well presented, and follows the FISA Subbuteo rule book to the letter any wrong move is instantly picked up by the computer ref. The graphics are very nice, and perform their function well, but sound is sparse with the exception of a jolly title theme. The gameplay is quite slow in comparison with the table-top version, so unfortunately you can find yourself getting bored with it quite rapidly. To be frank, Subbuteo is a bit of a loss, not because it's badly put together (in fact the opposite is true) but because you could go out and buy the real thing for less, and have a heck of a lot more fun.

IMMORTAL Let's make no bones about it if you have the honour of owning a 1MB Amiga, then The Immortal is simply an essential purchase. The whole feel of the product is faultless. The puzzles require simple lateral thought (none of this \"use the plutonium on the toaster to create a thermo-nuclear missile\" rubbish), and the incredibly user-friendly control method means that actually doing what you want to do can be done with the minimum of bother. What can I say about the visuals? Well, try \"beautiful\", \"exquisite\", and \"superbly animated\" for starters! The atmosphere generated by these quality 3D isometric graphics is simply unsurpassed, beating even Cadaver into a cocked hat.

Mean Streets claims to be an interactive movie, and the way the plot unfolds as you follow up leads and the narrative style really does make you feel like you're in a detective flick. Effective digitised pictures appear whenever you meet people or use the videophone, and the latter is also accompanied by some decent sampled speech. The only slight downer is the 3D scenery graphics, which are a little jerky, and not very detailed.

V PAUSE IIIIIIIIIII MEGADRIVE .00 I wasn't really impressed with Insector X to begin with. The backdrops looked rather tedious, the sprites were small and dull, and the gameplay itself felt remarkably dated. My opinions only changed after I had conquered the magnificent wasp-like end-of-level boss! Both the background graphics and the variety of enemy sprites improve as you progress through the game. At times the screen is literally full of six-legged nasties, and you're going to need to stock up on your power-ups in order to progress. Lose a life (quite easy to do with the pinpoint accuracy of the collision detection) and you'll have to say goodbye all your weaponry and this makes getting further into the game extremely difficult. Insector X is pretty good and does present quite a challenge, but if you want a truly amazing shoot 'em up then you'd be better of buying the brill Thunderforce 3.

As you all might have guessed, it's a beat 'em up in which you have to stroll along the landscape slicing the seven shades of shinola out of anything that gets in your way, before your energy bar is worn down. An unusual twist is that If you collect the keys littered around the place, you can open a prison door and free the occupant who follows your footsteps and acts as a sort of power-up extra person. Ninjas, Wizards, Dwarfs and Amazons can all be freed to join you, although only one character can follow you at once.
