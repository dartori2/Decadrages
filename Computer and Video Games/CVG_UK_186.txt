I usually hate to write such cheese, but in this case I believe an action-packed issue is exactly what we have produced. Of course this has a lot to do with the current wave of software being so high class that we have to mind our manners in its presence! A recent Activision press conference genuinely renewed my faith in dedication toward originality in games, while retaining ingredients from the classics. That event also brought home the real excitement surrounding projects involving Hollywood talent, which can only come from big budgets. Yep, it's probably about time that we started to feel happy about major production costs and huge corporations overseeing this industry. So long as the heart is there (which it is). By the way, my apologies for the lack of Saturn coverage in last month's issue-there just wasn't the same level of high profile of titles. This issue more than makes up for that, especially since the Number One Game of the AOU is destined for Sega's 32-bit powerhouse: Vampire Saviour (DarkStalkers 3)! Voted better than Street Fighter 3 you'd better believe it! Last thing of importance: CVG has moved offices. From now on here's where to find us.

SCREENSHOT If the side-bar info fails to register anything at all, we know that a cool slice of action might help. Here's where we like to put a typical, hopefully quite awesome, screenshot for super easy reference. Does it look like your idea of fun? We switched from a percentage rating system to the now famous High Five. To back that up we tightened up the way we present the information in the magazine, enabling us to highlight crucial details while blowing you away with incredible screen-shots and amazing game art. There are a few devices used in CVG to help readers find their way around the magazine. These were explained back in issue #174. However we realise a large number of people reading this are either completely new to CVG, or have started to buy the magazine in the last year. So for everyone's benefit, here's how everything works once more, 3. INFO BOX Start here for need-to-know basic facts, such as the game's developer, who's releasing it, how much it costs, and what format it's on-CD, cartridge, or maybe even Bulky Drive sometime soon.

REVIEWER COMMENT Find out what the reviewer's personal view of the game is, after reading the facts they point out on the rest of the page. We spend too much time (ask the designers) trying to find everything there is to know about a game, before forming an opinion.

The type of feature Review, Coming Soon, or Special is printed at the bottom. The logo for each game system is always at the top. For Reviews we just use the name of the game, whereas in Coming Soon we draw you in with the game's most exciting feature(s). 5. OVERALL Our final say so, as generally agreed by one and all on CVG. The High Five system is explained in detail elsewhere, but it's generally based on our response to a game. This is how much we really recommend this game, at this point in time. REVIEW "

That's all you ever hear about from Tom how it's the best thing ever and we all should play it. Maybe so, but we should all play it quite a lot better than Tom who is, by anyone's standards, rubbish. Of course we only print these things to hurt his pride. Just to remind him that he still has an aspect of his character that you could class as pride after it has been demolished beyond all recognition by The Master and his minions.

Or else this is a clumsy attempt at a new concept. LOMAS DULL ...VERY POOR 00000 Almost a flat-liner, it's so lifeless. You'll be wanting to exchange this for something else straightaway. Save yourself the bother by avoiding in the first place. ou know Ed almost had us worried this month, as he declared a disinterest for video games only playing until 2:00 am most evenings. Gladly he's back on the habit again, clocking up more, hours than most peoples' best high scores on Ray Storm. And we re expected to feel sorry for him when he's tired and in need of a cola fix. Which brings us around to think ing that it might be a good idea if you all send in loads of sugary foods for Ed's con sumption. He'd work 10x faster! WE ONLY LIVE TO SERVE SENIOR STAFF WRITER CURRENT FAV GAMES  QUAKE  MICRO MACHINES V3 FIGHTERS MEGAMIX  NIGHTS  BARBIE STEVS KEY he reason we don't use the same review system as just about every other games magazine on the planet is simple: ours is honest, and direct. You have to remember that CVG has been around for over 15 years now, and has adopted numerous score systems. We lost percentages because they were often misleading, and ill-suited to most modern games which get closer to Hollywood grandeur each month. THE ONE AND ONLY COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES NEW uited ur very own Doctrine Dark look-a-like has made all the difference to the way we work on CVG. Like he's organised for one thing (organisation was a hitherto alien concept here). So how has this changed things? Well, for a start, we have managed to reduce the design team's fury gauge from Critical to merely Annoyed, We think. And the dress code seems to have improved, since Steve is usually so neat and clean. 'The Steve Key Guide To Flawless Living' is already underway. We're not just rating 'sound' now, as this important area of presentation now includes professional recording artists, and Dolby Surround Sound atmospherics. Same goes for 'Graphics'. and 'Animation' we're judging work that is comparable to the best stuff Disney, Spielberg, and Lucas has ever done. We judge the whole experience, and the High Five is perfect for that. SENIOR STAFF WRITER CURRENT FAV GAMES: QUAKE  MICRO MACHINES V3 RAGE RACER SOUL BLADE  PERFECT STRIKER TT   H OLD HIGHEST **** TENDATU t's got to be said that Alex gets a pretty good deal out of working for CVG. He blags all the best freebies (film previews, toys, etc) and gets all the best games to write about. That is, Alex believes he has the best games to write about, only the stuff he tends to go for the rest of us wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole! Which is all perfectly fine of course. And, as the say ing goes, it takes all sorts.

ART EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES: TETRIS JNR MICRO MACHINES V3 SF EX  SF 3  MARIO 64 MIKE NEWSON 1 Could be a pixel or two out of place here. Should lose one percent for that. But then we gave the 'sound' 97, and the 'graphics' are much better... (!) 1 This is just bad, okay, BAD! We could point this out using 20 or 30 pieces of a hundred. But we can do it just as easily with one of five. t's a miracle that Mike made it into the magazine this month, what with disaster lurking around every corner. Mike's the kind of guy who walks around with a 10-ton anvil hovering over his head. When it rains it bloody well hurts. And Mike, goes. \"told you so\". Metaphorically speak ing of course. Also metaphorically speaking, the rest of CVG dedicate every minute to constructing said anvil. We're hiring out some scaffolding to make the next one. It's gonna be big. Nyak! Nyak! CVG's only concern is that YOU are getting the best possible help and advice about the games you play. Our entire system of doing things not just the overall score is geared to perfect that service. We are always willing to listen to any problems you may have with the magazine, so please don't hesitate to drop us a line and let us know how we can do CVG better.

"computer video games NEWSO 3 HMV ARE YOU THE UK'S NO1 GAMES PLAYER? NINTENDO 64 ATTACKS! NINTENDO fter months of waiting, UK gamers finally have the chance to experience the official PAL Nintendo 64 after it hit the streets on March 1st and promptly sold out! Following the near year-long pre-release build-up, good initial sales were only to be expected, but such a sensational response came as something of a surprise. Stores across the country reported sell-outs on the first day, some within minutes of their doors opening! And from the bigger stores such as Virgin Megastores and HMV Level One, if you hadn't pre-ordered you didn't stand a good chance of buying the machine. From a pure machines-off-the-shelves point of view, the UK N64 launch was a success. However, not everyone is so convinced by this result, mainly because the initial shipment of N64s totalled a meagre NINTENDO ake sure you buy Computer and Video Games next month, because it contains news of a big opportunity for you. One of the world's largest retail outlets, HMV, in association with yours truly, CVG, is joining forces for the HMV/CVG Challenge. Full details will be revealed next issue, but we can tell you now that the UK's best players had better start honing their skills in the hope of winning major prizes. Discussions are underway to establish the very first HMV/CVG Challenge game. Very soon around 10-12 HMV stores up and down the UK will be previewing the one of the hottest games around. This will be your opportunity to get practicing for the preliminary rounds, the winners of which will receive an all-expenses paid trip to the finals at HMV'S flagship games store Level One, Oxford Street, London! This could change an awful lot about our somewhat mediocre games market. The HMV/CVG Challenge is going to be huge! You will want to be involved! But until next issue, watch this space. (Nintendo OFFICIAL UK MACHINE ARRIVED MARCH 1ST! ALL MACHINES SOLD OUT IN MINUTES UK N64 POST-MORTEM! SATURN + N64 GET QUAKE! 20,000 machines. And initial sales surges can always be put down to early adopters. Sega in particular, have voiced their opinion, following suggestions that the battle for supremacy is now a two horse race between PlayStation and Nintendo! Sega, with a European user base of 900,000, say they are still the most potent competition to Sony, and predict another million Saturn sales across Europe (around half that in the UK) this year. This in comparison to Sony's prediction of another 2.5 million PS sales this year. Nintendo's UK distributor THE, target 400,000 N64 sales by January 1998. Sega said recently in CTW. \"The three-way battle will start in September when THE has to start selling to less dedicated consumers. They won't find their way onto too many Christmas lists at .\" Meanwhile Nintendo predicted they would have worldwide sales of six million by March, which is half of the PlayStation's current worldwide sales figures. We can see whether that turned out to be the case next month. NEWS NUGGET! Nintendo have stated that Metroid 64 is not in development at this time! NINTENDO REWRITEABLE CARTRIDGE! SATURN AND N64 GET QUAKE!) NEWS his summer Nintendo are releasing a new Super Famicom game exchange system in Japan. By purchasing a special blank cartridge for Y5000 (approx ) you can copy your preferred game on to it. Whereas a new game would usually cost only about 3,000 to 6,000 Yen, the copied soft will only cost about 1000 to 2,500 Yen. Users will need to go to a special store (around 10,000 nationwide) such as Toys-RUs to have the game copied for them, but they can use the same cartridge again and again, so once they finish one game they can have it overwritten with another. Nintendo promise a selection of around one hundred games will eventually be available! oth the Saturn and Nintendo 64 versions of id Software's Quake are up and running and looking fantastic! Lobotomy have been working on Saturn Quake for the last few months. Everything is going to be the same as the PC version full 3D levels, enemies and items with realtime coloured lighting which actually improves on the PC game! Those who've played the Saturn game say that it's amazingly close to looking like the PC version and runs at a high speed already! Hopefully we'll have a copy of the game in time to do a full feature next issue! John Carmack of id Software recently announced how well Quake 64 was coming on, saying that it looks a lot like GL Quake (the 3DFXenhanced version of the game) at 30 frames per second! They've currently got DM5, The Cistern, running perfectly with the brilliant translucent water effect from GLQuake and Turok, plus coloured light sources and antialiasing to smooth out all of the textures! As John Carmack says \"The biggest pain is the tiny size of the cartridge. I am going to implement some more space efficient file formats, and all the maps are going to have the non-essentials crunched out, but we are still not going to be able to fit as many on as I would like\". The current plan is to have some modified original levels, some from the extra level packs plus some specially made for Quake 64! Can't wait! 10 PC screenshots shown. "


"computer Video games THE REAL SONIC COMING TO SATURN ZELDA COMING TO 64DD AND CARTRIDGE! 0223 s we went to press the Tokyo Game Show, starting on April 5th, had yet to happen. However, news of what's going to be there is sensational! Word is that Virtual On 2 on Model 3 will be unveiled, together with an RPG from Panzer Dragoon creators, Team Andromeda. Virtua Fighter 3 on Saturn is also claimed to make an appearance. If that's the case, we'll also see the add-on that will power Saturn VF3. Exciting as this may sound, it's not the biggest story. Sonic Team have a 'major announcement' to make at the show. Many believe it's NiGHTS 2, however we've received word that it is indeed Sonic the Hedgehog! Following the canned Sonic Extreme and the reasonable Sonic 3D, fans have been hollering for a genuine Sonic Team version. And contrary to rumours, we've been told it features 2D sideways scrolling gameplay, albeit with 3D backdrops similar to Pandemonium or Clockwork Knight. AND it uses an enhanced version of the NIGHTS engine! Expect a full report next month! V ith rumours flying about whether W Zelda is coming to 64DD or cartridge, Nintendo's publicist Yoshio Hongo has said that it will be released on both! The cartridge version is set for Japanese release by Winter this year, with the 64DD version to follow next year. The most impor tant news though, is that both games will be radically different from each other. In fact, there are different teams working on each game. Exactly how the games will differ, and what part the 64DD writable memory system will make to this, is still unclear. But we're going to keep following this story closely. NEWS FROM TOKYO TOY SHOW 1997 WIN AWESOME 55-GAME LCD KEYRINGS! In case you didn't know, there's a long-standing CVG tradition of putting some evil April fools jokes in the April issue of the magazine. Last month we had a few which drove hundreds of readers mad! For a start there was the Tomb Raider cheat to make Lara Croft take all of her clothes off, where you needed to dance along to a friend tapping out the Spice Girls tune Wannabe. While it may sound completely ridiculous, we had LOADS of letters and phonecalls from readers who'd spent hours trying to get it working, as well a fair number of enquiries from people working in the games industry! Ha ha! Then there was a little something in the New Games section called Ultimate Fighting Universe a game combining the four biggest 3D fighting games around! There were a few clues in there to help you figure it out it's by a company who's name is Japanese for April, their European Marketing Executive's name is an anagram of April Fool and there's a character in the game called Pedro star of last year's Mortal Kombat April Fool! Again, lots of people pestered us about this, including one bloke who sold his copy of Tekken 2 in readiness. Whoops! And then there was a slightly more subtle one in Checkpoint -a show at the Tokyo Eggworld where you can pick up as many free unreleased games as you want?

"computer video games Please send your letters to: CVG MAIL BAG.... Computer and Video Games, 37-39 Millharbour, The Isle Of Dogs, London, E14 9TX MAI] We regret that no personal correspondence can be entered into. Not even if someone offers us 1,000 free N64s. mazing how CVG readers always sense a shift in the magic aura which drives us. That is, a few of us here are completely hooked on the Final Fantasy VII sensation which is taking the world by storm. It's a strange coincidence that a fair proportion of our mail relates to RPGs, and, in particular, Final Fantasy VII. Even Daniel Hassany's essay' on game music names a couple of Square RPGs. Elsewhere people are agonising over whether they should get rid of their 32-bit system to raise cash for an .N64. While we're here, and to anyone who is considering the same thing, allow us to say just this: What are you, NUTS?! All these people wanting to abandon so many great games already. And with more to come. Krakatoa! ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL Dear CVG, I am writing partly to tell you of my enjoy ment of issue 183, it was a very good issue. I bought it because I am, to be truthful a bit of an RPG fanatic and I couldn't resist your review of Terranigma for the SNES. I liked the review so much I decided to buy the game straight away. Brilliant, I thought. One of the other things that really caught my eye was the section about next month's magazine, at the top to the list of games to be reviewed was Final Fantasy VII. Now I have been an avid fan of the Final Fantasy series since the American Final Fantasy II, so I knew that I WOULD buy this issue of CVG. The 12th of February came, I rushed to the shop at maximum speed and bought that marvellous gift of the gods, CVG issue 184. I turned to the contents pages, my hands shaki ng with excitement! But Noooo00oooo! It wasn't there, no review. scoured the entire magazine, but to no avail, no mention of what had happened to the review of this amazingly good looking game. Please, please tell us what's happening, don't any of you lot at CVG care about Final Fantasy VII? Daniel King, Macclesfield WISE UP SONY — RPGS RULE! CVG: We're sorry for any disappointment we caused you Daniel. At the time issue #183 went to press we were expecting to receive FFVII materials from Square direct, but they didn't arrive in time for the issue #184 deadline. Hopefully the coverage FFVII had been getting since #185 has put things straight. Of course we care ! HOOKED ON CLASSICS USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES * Dear CVG, I am a RPG loving PlayStation owner and want to get my point across about the lack of decent role-players available for the machine. I have had my console for a while now and before I purchased it I owned a SNES a brilliant machine with top RPGs like Zelda, the excellent Secret of Mana, Soul Blazer, Dungeon Master (my fave), the list goes on and on. Why can't games like these be available for the 32bit console? I'm aware of the growing range of adventures like Tomb Raider (which I own) and Warhammer (RPG/strategy), but true, top quality RPGs? The only ones can think of are Suikoden and Final Fantasy VII, and those are really adventures. I'm now missing my SNES so much I decided to buy it again, and hopefully some new new Role-players like Chrono Trigger. just hope Sony can wise-up and cater for the growing demand for RPGs in the UK, and I can assure you that me and the many other fans will be flooding the streets. Mark Lucas, Edmonton  Square Co Ltd Dear CVG, Ever since playing PC-Engine's version of Ys book I & II, Dragon Slayer, and Dungeon Explorer, the Phantasy Star and Shining Force series on the Mega Drive; to Secret of Mana, and the Final Fantasy series on the SNES I have become utterly hooked on RPGs. The reason for this letter is because I am bitterly disappointed with the RPG scene in this country. I now own a Sega Saturn and would like to ask where have all the following games gone to? And I bet a lot of your readers have never heard of these: because I'd like companies such as Sega, Squaresoft, Enix, Atlus, Falcom, and others to take notice and perhaps do something about porting over more 32-bit RPGs. I bought my Saturn purely on the thought of seeing some fantastic RPGs and I pray that another generation of great games won't go unnoticed because of lazy companies with people who have no marketing knowledge of what we want to play. NKM, Beckton CVG: We know Sega Europe pretty well, and we know that they care about RPGs and have great taste too. Due to the expense of translation work, and the extra pressure this puts on the original developers in some cases, Sega Europe can't bring over everything they'd like. However, thanks to independent publishers such as Working Designs (based in the US). and some bending over backwards on the Sega Japan side, we can expect to see Shining The Holy Ark definitely (see Coming Soon); Albert Odyssey, Terra Phantastica, and Dragon Force maybe; plus Grandia eventually. Riglord Saga II was planned, then canned! Others you mentioned involve third-party Japanese publishers who either don't have the inroads to the UK to make release possible, or simply don't see the need. Far East of Eden The Apocalypse IV Lunar Silver Star Story Albert Odyssey Legend of Eldean Magic Knight RayEarth Terra Phantastica Shin Megari Tensei Devil Summoner Dragon Force Airs Adventure Sakura Wars Ogre Battle Tactics Ogre Shining The Holy Ark Grandia Policenauts Riglord Saga Il CVG: Sony are almost ready to announce their plans for FFVII in the UK. By the way Mark, you're wrong to class Suikoden and FFVII as 'adventures'. They're closer to being true RPGs than Secret of Mana, Soul Blazer, and Zelda which are action adventures. Oh, and steer clear of the area near our office if you intend 'flooding the streets' with many other fans!  CHP 131HP 115HP 31 JHP 126 LETTERS You guys must admit that the RPG scene here in the UK is SLOW to say the least. And just why is it that some of the best games released in Japan have never made it to our shores? Games such as Squaresoft's Secret of Mana II, Front Mission, Romancing Sa.Ga series, as well as Enix's Dragon Quest sagas have been overlooked here. I think it's sad that now the 32-bit/64-bit scene is hotting up and that now the 16-bit generation is fading we will never have the satisfaction of playing these great games! I really hope this letter gets printed Shining The Holy Ark, from Sega. Expect this sometime soon for the Saturn, along with more great RPGs. 12 "


"computer video games BAG STAR*LETTER BUM NOTES MAKE GAMES STINK affecting the gaming industry as a whole. What with the declining popularity of ace 2D games and the Sony/Sega strict 3D all graphics no gameplay gaming policies, we don't need to go any lower. Slowly but surely the fun is being taken out of video games. Daniel Hassany, Hove FREAKING OUT OVER FFVII CVG CVG: Yep. How annoying would it be if the new Star Wars movies had bangin' techno pumping right the way through just to appeal to today's audiences! Crap music is just as much of a giveaway as appalling graphics when we come to recognising lazy software. Used to be that racing games all played Heavy Metal. Now it's Rave. Someone comes up with an interesting idea, then a hundred other dull software houses rip it off. Puzzle games all have bouncy, cute-style music since Puyo-Puyo. RPGs mostly try some kind of inane Vivaldi/Wagner cocktail which can be just as embarrassing. The best 'BGM' is always uniquely tailored to the atmosphere of a game. You should here the soul in Earthbound (Mother 2) a Nintendo RPG developed by HAL. That's unique and totally cool. Leave Enix and Square to the orchestral style if you can't compete. Dear CVG, In response to the question you raised several issues back, on the importance of game music. I would like to share my opinion on game music today. Throughout the computer game history, ingame music has taken a backseat to other game aspects graphics, playability, lastability, etc. And this is fair to an extent as it is far harder to convey a brilliant audio score than amazing graphics, through the use of the media, due to costs of demo discs, etc. Even in-store demonstrations have the sound turned off for the most part. As such the only way to listen to game music is to hire or buy the game itself. This factor has never deterred game manufacturers however, as far back as Turrican's incredible BGM on the C64, to even a fairly modern classic such as Secret of Mana on SNES. Games developers clearly showed a pride in their work and this filtered through to the game's audio content. Game music was individualist not the sort of thing to play on your stereo, but at the same time very atmospheric, and the perfect accompaniment for the in-game action. Who can forget the infamous Outrun tunes, or even F-Zero's brilliant BGM. Nowadays however we are constantly being bombarded with utterly dire techno/dance/house in-game music, in games such as Tempest X, Wipeout 2097. and RR Revolution. Sure this may well have suited Wipeout as a one-off, but to influence the entire games industry (in the UK at least). is a different matter. I honestly can't think of anything more off-putting and annoying than listening to The Prodigy whilst playing a game. Game manufacturers (Sony), let's get one thing straight video games, however realistic, are fantasy, and consequently need similarly fantastical sound. If I want to listen to some chart b****cks such as The Chemical Brothers I'd rather hear it down a nightclub than in a video game. In introducing such music, sonic standards are dropping, and are Dear CVG It was only a few months ago when I bought my first issue of CVG. The price is just superb but what I really am pleased about is your acclaiming of RPGs. You are the only mag since Super Play (now woefully extinct) that has gone mad over them! This is great but what is a real shame is that the UK is an RPG hating community. I luckily own some of the best games on the SNES by successfully hassling the importer. These games are in the genre of RPGs. Nothing, and I mean nothing, compares to Squaresoft's games. The music is literally superb and some in Chrono Trigger is indeed CD quality. No one can make music and indeed a gaming atmosphere as well as Square can. Unfortunately I bet when Final Fantasy VII is released in the UK it will not sell well. In America FFVII is the most awaited game and luckily I have the prequel FFIll on the SNES. I am confident that this is one of the best games ever. Any of you lot in CVG or the UK will certainly agree with me as it creates one of the best gaming atmospheres have ever played. An example is in the word of ruin when you really feel for all the characters. I am one of the few Square freaks in the UK, but in America the one game Final Fantasy III singlehandedly made the US go mental over the one genre the RPG. I swapped my PlayStation just for FFVII, it will be one of the best games ever along with Mario 64. Just remember all you CVG readers with RPG-OPhobia when FFVII comes out BUY IT!!! You would be quite literally mad to miss it. FFVII is the only game that can and hopefully turn all our beat 'em up crazed English into RPG freaks. Keep up the good work CVG and continue to hype FFVII for a long time. You UK gamers you would be MAD as a BSE infected cow to miss it! Dom, Bucks PlayStation wipegue * USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES DIROX 1919-2007 DOMUSPOSOBY Sometimes dance music is the perfect partner for video games. But there are more cases where the game content just isn't suited at all. CVG: We will introduce more RPG coverage when we feel the UK market is warm to it. But expect Final Fantasy VII to make charcoal of everyone! MR PAUL! MR PAUL! HE HAS A BAG ON (?) allowed to say anything good about the 32-bit consoles whilst working on NMS because all they seem to do is slag them off, which is ruining an otherwise brilliant mag. PPS What happened to Jaz Rignall? When he left for the States he said he would be sending some news over to NMS about the latest craze in America, and yet we haven't heard from him. Is he so rich he's decided we are not worth bothering about, or is he simply six feet under? Andrew Spiretos, Leeds Dear CVG, Like many people in the UK I am frustrated because the majority of decent RPGs never make it out of Japan. I played Zelda on the SNES and loved it. Then I played Secret of Mana and became hooked. Then, around late 1995, SNES mags were dripping with news of Secret of Mana II. With my heart rate steadily increasing I awaited its release, but then...nothing! No word of any release, anywhere. So I would like to know, was Secret of Mana Il ever finished? If so, was it released in Japan, and did it then get into the USA because I would love to get an import copy. Could you also give me a phone number or something so that I can talk to someone about imports? You keep saying that companies take note of these letters and so I'll say it again. I have a bag on (sic) because we don't get half of Japan's classy RPGs. Joe Parker, Swadlincote Dear CVG, I am a huge fan of Namco and I am also planning to get a UK N64 in March, so you can imagine my joy when I read (in NMS #50) that they were intending to release their games in the N64. However my joy was short lived as read the whole article which stated that they were planning to release only original games, and as an excuse for this they said the audience of the N64 is believed to be younger than that of the PS. What a load of brown smelly stuff. I think the true reason is that Sony bribed them to keep their arcade games PS only. Namco are known as arcade giants. The N64 is known for its lack of arcade conversions, while the PS is over flowing with them, at the same time lacking original games. So why not give PS owners the original games and give N64 some decent arcade conversions? After all with the likes of Zelda and the brill J League Perfect Striker how many copies do they hope to sell? (About two if they're lucky). Please give me some advice because at the moment it looks like I will have to buy a second-hand PS, as well as a new N64, which means I might have to sell a kidney to get that sort of spare cash! PS Can you tell me if Mr Paul Davies was CVG: Buy that PlayStation! Namco know what they're doing, and it will benefit us all. No point in everyone complaining that there's no original software, then moaning when it's announced! PAUL: I only used to comment on the 32-bit systems if I wanted to talk about how N64 would do things better. Now I know that it does things differently. I've always loved every new games system that comes along though. Sad, eh. CVG: Jaz Rignall is almost certainly very rich, as he has a high powered position with Virgin in America. Why are you bothered about him though? Are we not worthy?! SUIT CVG: Yes Secret of Mana Il was released in Japan. It was never adapted for released in the US. 13 "


"computer video games RICH LEADBETTER RETURNS CRAPPY OLD-FASHIONED PLAYSTATION THING speed. For games buy a Pentium or wait a littl and get a Pentium MMX. Sure, if you want a computer buy a PC. However don't expect to get a + of games machine. Many people I know who hav bought PCs for games rapidly become disenchanted with the crashy/buggy/kludgy nature the operating system and end up selling it and buying a console again. John Thorby, Huntingdon Dear CVG, I am concerned for my PlayStation's sake about the Ultra 64 so please will you answer me these questions. 1. I've got 16 games for my PlayStation including Rage Racer and Soul Edge. All of my Namco games seem to be the best but I've heard that Namco (PlayStation's best game maker) are developing games for the U64. Is this true because if they do I think Sony will slowly fade away. 2. I've got an imported PlayStation and I've got so many games because lots of brilliant games come pouring in month after month, I think PlayStation have done too much too soon. Do you? 3. I was off school sick a couple of months ago and my Mum brought me a different mag as a present. It said that PlayStation developers have pushed it to its limits with games like Tomb Raider. Is this true? 4. All my PlayStation games are the best games they have brought out. I played Mario 64 in my extremely brilliant kind importers shop, and I must admit it's amazing. In fact it's the best game I've ever played. Do you think so too? 5. Should I get an Ultra 64 or stick with PlayStation? Adrian Bosco, Stoke-on-Trent Dear CVG, I just have to write in and take issue with Rich Leadbetter's feature \"Own The Ultimate Games Machine.\" It was either fantastically naive or incredibly biased. Not wishing to see people waste their hard-earned money on a beige white elephant here are some of my grumbles: 1. \"you save at least a couple of hundred quid assembling it yourself\" cobblers. Selfassembly is MORE expensive as dealers have a higher mark-up on system components than they do on those same components sold as a ready-made system. You also get loads of OEM software with a complete PC. 2. \"sooner or later people will get wise and it will stop.\" (the recursive upgrade curse) No way. The whole PC market is built on fear and inadequacy and Intel and Microsoft know this. Many people realise early on that they will never get value-formoney from their PC but still spend more and more money in a vain and neurotic attempt to justify the large initial outlay, and, perhaps, play the latest games at anything above a snail's pace. Parents might cough up + once, albeit reluctantly, but when they realise some form of upgrade is a yearly occurrence they begin to yearn for the days of \"expensive\" carts. 3. Buying a Pentium Pro system for games A complete waste of time (oh, and money). The Pentium Pro runs 32bit code fast, but is no quicker at running 16-bit code games than a Pentium of the same clock RICH: Zzzzzz. What? Eh? [Rich wakes up) Point one: well it depends on the dealer, but I can't say I've seen any dealers THAT generous. Poin two: well everyone should have a dream, but tl main point I was making was that people are more likely to get a 3D accelerator than upgrade. Point three: 32-bit code? What like ai native Windows 95 program? Remember I wrot the bloody feature months ago when MMX was n't available, and even now the amount of sup port isn't exactly gargantuan is it? As for being naive? Yeah right. Biased? Well I own a PC yes but also a PlayStation, N64 and I'm editor of Sega Saturn Magazine. So no, I'm not. But would quite happily say that my lowly P133 wit 3DFX does things that even N64 can only dream of. So in that respect maybe it is \"the ultimate games machine\": Which was the point of the feature. Now I'm going off to do something more interesting... intel pentium AND WOULDN'T BE GOOD RIGHT IF. USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES CVG: To answer all your questions, or at least to address your major problem Adrian, don't give up on the PlayStation too soon! Decide for yourself whether owning Mario 64 is worth the price of the N64 alone. Oh, and an extra . (Believe it or not, some people on CVG aren't so sure).

"computer video 70% games COMPLETE 3D ACTION BY RAVEN  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  SATURN VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE TBA JUNE RELEASE 1-8 PLAYERS ROM  RELEASED BY ACTIVISION TEL: 01895 456700 ROM Fantastic though Quake is, there are still some people who want a bit more of an adventure from their games. Enter Hexen 2. . TO HEXEN 2 n Heretic we defeated the evil serpent riding wizard, D'Sparil. In Hexen we wiped out the second of the three serpent riders, Korax. Now the world of Hexen is threatened again, this time by the third and final serpent rider and it's up to four heroes to take him on and save Hexen! Based on the Quake engine, Hexen 2 looks set to be one of the biggest PC games of the year, and Activision are rightly proud to have got the rights to release it. Onward, saviours of Hexen! OH MY GOD! WHAT A S FABULOUS ROOM! HEXEN 2: QUAKE IN TIGHTS, CARRYING A CROSSBOW! Hexen 2 uses the excellent Quake game engine, just as the original Hexen used a modified Doom engine. Many of the textures appear to have been created from digitised photographs as they have a more realistic look to them than most of Quake's, yet the speed and fluidity of the movement is always brilliant. As many sections are meant to represent real furniture and buildings, there are some very intricately built areas. HALSTED This guillotine is in the middle of one of Hexen 2's towns! Thankfully there's an undertaker's nearby. TRAVEL THE WORLD COMING SOON HEXEN 2: QUAKE IN TIGHTS, DIE 1 The weapons aren't in place yet, but the levels already look fantastic! Check out the detail! The crouch button will let you crawl through small gaps. In the early version of Hexen 2 we played, only a few levels had been constructed. Most of the enemies and items weren't in place, but it's already clear how amazing the levels are. Rather than the game being set in a load of corridors, there's lots of variation in the level styles with Egyptian and Aztec sections as well as whole towns which you can walk round. One of the best parts is a mediaeval high street with a blacksmith's, a bar and an undertaker's, all of which you can go into! The undertaker's even has a load of tools on the wall and a half-finished coffin on the worktable! There's also a full-sized windmill on one level which you can go into, letting you see all of the cogs and workings inside! Of course, there are also quite a few enormous castles complete with banquet rooms, kitchens and even networks of sewers and dungeons! Once the enemies are in place, Hexen 2 will be truly terrifying! 1 There are some fantas tic temples in the Aztec levels with loads of long, complicated mazes. Expect some particularly evil traps too. RS The flying gargoyles from Hexen are already in Hexen 2. They swoop down and fly straight for your head! 20 "


"CLAN HEXEN! computer video games JON ME, THE PALADIN IN HEXBV 2 PVE GOT THE BIGGEST SWORD YOU KNOW. WIZARD PALADIN ROM The first Hexen gave players a choice of three different characters Baratus the Fighter, Parias the Cleric and Daedolon the Mage, each with different weapons and attributes. In Hexen 2 there is a choice of four characters three similar to the originals plus a Thiefstyle Paladin character! Everyone's going to pick their favourite character and stick with them, learning the way all of their weapons work as well as getting used to the way they control. Then, once the game's been completed with one of the heroes, they can pick another and do it all again! Also, Co-operative network games are more fun when there's a team using their unique skills to help one another. WARRIOR This statue looks amazing from a distance, but it's only when you get close that you realise the detail on it! HALSTED HEXEN 2: QUAKE IN TIGHTS, CARRYING A CROSSBOW! Kill the walking golem to gain more experience points! THE HEXEN EXPERIENCE! So far not many details of Raven's plans for Hexen 2 have been revealed, and the very early version of the game we've played (well, walked around really) doesn't reveal much about the gameplay features. We know that one new feature is that the characters now have experience points an idea not used in the original Hexen. Whenever an enemy is killed or certain tasks are completed the player gains more experience, and get promoted to higher levels. Also, there's going to be a big selection of magical items to use like those in the first game. Not knowing anything about a game is quite exciting, isn't it? HALSTED The level of detail in Hexen 2's stages is amazing! It looks real! GET READY FOR ADVENTURE! Although Hexen 2 is currently not much more than a few empty levels, it's obvious that it's going to be brilliant. Combining the fantas tic Quake engine with Raven's brilliant Hexen idea can't fail, and with the id Software Overlords keeping an eye on what's going on... it will RULE! 21 "

Luckily the PlayStation just about handles it. CREDIT 01 ROUND 2  MUSEUM Uroo 80000 NamCO VOL. 5000 5000 2000 Bts rcade machines that arrived on the scene in the late '80s influenced an entire generation of home video games. The shoot 'em up formula was established, and frequently updated. Action platform games were constantly reinvented, as every company sought to create a successful hero. And the concept of an Action Adventure was set in stone. Meanwhile some of the larger, established manufacturers were able to invest their fortunes in new technology to enable touches of graphical innovation. Namco rode this particular wave like champion boarders, issuing titles against which many recent games are still compared. Number four in the PlayStation Museum series is the best so far. Not least because it features the classic Pac-Land and the crazy Ordyne. Anyway, find out for yourself how cool this lot is in June. Meanwhile here's a reminder.  EDIN MORE CLASSIC ARCADE HITS FROM ORDY 31984 10390 HIGH SCORE S0000 As with previous Museums, all the authentic attract scenes for each game are included. Namco were treading dangerous ground when I they lifted Pac-Man from his maze and dropped him into a platform environment. However platform games were less common in 1984, and the boundaries not so clearly defined. Hence Pac-Land retains its intense score-based heritage, which can be initially confusing. Still the beautiful, unique graphic style and jolly tunes keep you coming back for more. Pac-Land is a classic. FORSBE S48unt E COOL FACTOR CREDIT OT ROUND 2 QOoo Geared solely toward amassing bonus points. Double-tapping a direction makes Pac-Man run. A jump button allows Pac-Man to hop quickly or, if tapped repeatedly, make him float gently down another trick for collecting bonus points. When combined these simple controls allow for some amazing feats. Secrets are found by pushing objects out of the way protective hats, warps to other stages, and so on. 1 Pac-Land bounces along to some of the coolest tunes in a video game. The control is almost perfect. And only almost, because nothing is perfect (grr!). HIGH SCORE HIGS0000 16580 ROUND 3 22 If it's State-Of-The-Art you want, stay away. If it's perfect nostalgia you want, stay forever! "


"computer video 1988 games TREASURE STORE RETURN *** *1984 BHTAR PlayStation Alamco capitalise on the sprite rotation and scaling capabilities of their new arcade hardware with an innovative tank game. Assault resembles Capcom's popular Commando game, introducing a twin stick control method reminiscent of Atari's Battlezone. For the PlayStation version, this control is transferred to both the top sets of buttons, leaving the L1 and R1 buttons to fire. Your mission is to destroy designated targets, found at the far end of increasingly dangerous battle grounds. is TINY SCREENI o ok IA/hile not entirely original this is very similar to Atari's Gauntlet VV the 3D approach, and password system mark The Return Of Ishtan as another landmark title. Players lead either Kai (a girl) or Gill (the fella) in a one or two player dungeon adventure. As the heroes make progress through the maze, they collect various items which help their status: Shields: Healing Potions, Protective Rings, and so on. 991 2 COOL FACTOR 2 COOL FACTOR At the time The Return Of Ishtar offered a pretty vast gameplay environment. Role playing in the arcades...! The pseudo 3D graphics looked stunning too. The detail in Assault is top quality, and the enemy craft follow imaginative attack patterns. Equally inventive are the giant launch pads which spring-board your tank into the air to bombard the tiny enemy below a blatant but effective showcase of Namco's cool hardware at the time. 1 For people who have adjustable monitors, there is an option to display the game full screen. Otherwise Assault is scaled down to fit inside a tall narrow window. 6 Players may control Kai and Gill simultaneously, using the direction buttons on the left of the pad for Gill, and the four top buttons for Kai. L1 and R1 are action buttons. F291555 MORE CLASSIC ARCADE HITS FROM namco 1988 GENPEI TOH MADEN The forerunner to Sega's Shinobi? We doubt this challenging action/platform game ever made it out of Japan, as even the score display uses Kanji characters. Genpei no doubt influenced many similar titles, providing the Samurai hero with numerous power-ups to improve his chances of survival. econd favourite game of the collection for CVG, after Pac-Land. This is the second home version of Namco's funky-style shoot 'em up, the first appeared on NEC's PC Engine. Of course the PlayStation version is 100% faithful to the original machine ignoring minute loading time. Ordyne is a horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em, using bright colours and humorous characters to identify it from serious contemporaries such as Irem's R-Type. One or two players get to join in the fun. 1986 Wank COOL FACTOR COOL FACTOR There are three gameplay styles in Genpei: side-scrolling platform; side-scrolling with giant-size sprites; and overhead. The scene changes each time the Samurai enters a temple gate. In all cases the Samurai uses his sword for defence, and evades obstacles by jumping. This game is tough, but it plays fair. Ordyne is one of the first shoot 'em ups to use an Item Shop (Sega's Fantasy Zone was the very first). Bought weapons are on a time limit, but speed ups are permanent. The more bizarre weapons make short work of the weirdo bosses. However once these are lost it's back to more skillful tactics. 1 Our favourite sound effects are alien voices which go, \"Koopiah! Koopiah! Koopi-koopikoopiah!\" WAKKA-WAKKAWAKKA-WAKKA, KOFF, BELCHI 25300 FOUR IS PHENOMENAL Sopoo Namco Museum 4 ought to be a sell out when it's released the wealth of gaming history on here shouldn't be overlooked by any games player. It's only because we're worried that you might forget about it that we're holding out a month for the review score. That Namco heritage just gets better and better. 23 "

Last month we re-introduced this title which caused a total upheaval in the video game scene. At that time we only managed to preview some of the major new features. We say 'only' because these ground-breaking elements have come to excede the highest expectations of our biggest Square devotee. Everything on offer in this RPG strikes the imagination with such force that it becomes embossed on your brain forever! The finest CG visuals, an awesome symphonic soundtrack (CD quality but not from the CD!), and a storyline to break your heart then fuel a fiery ambition. Everyone should play this game, and here's a few more reasons why. WOOTAI AND DATCHIAO MOUNTAIN Incredibly pretty location, comprised of ornate houses and lush countryside. Square succeed in letting players get a real sense of what a temple village feels like to be around. Struggle for your own words to describe the detail in this mountain shrine. WORLD KEEP ON TURNING COSTA DEL SOL When we left you last month, Cloud and his team had only just set foot outside of Midgar. Since then the true richness of the FFVII world has started to be revealed. Where to start? Well at this early stage, how about we just show you the best bits so far. For plot details, check out the coverage in CVG next month.. After the dismal dark of Midgar, this place looks like heaven. Only on the coastline however, as this is mere ly a facade for what lays beyond the bleak mountains. Shin-Ra are building another city, similar to Midgar, serviced by a railroad network. MOUNTAINS OF NIBULHEIM 1 Travel by boat to Costa Del Sol from the harbour at Junon. A major confrontation with a Materia keeper concludes a treacherous exploration trip in search of Sephiroth. The caverns glow with an eerie light, cast by the Materia in its natural state. This place is overrun by large green dragons!

Cosmo Canyon is a settlement perched right on top of a mountain, so that the telescope may have a clear view. An amazing FMV sequence takes place in the planetarium. An obsessed inventor, who later joins the party, lives here with his wife. The entire village grew up around, the rocket after it failed to launch successfully many years ago. Square use another lengthy cinematic to explain all of this. It's fantastic. This girl Aerith has a habit of going missing! Only here it is much more serious. In the beauty and calm of this village, which seems to be made up of crystal, shell, and bleached wood, a moment of extreme terror chills you to the core. 1 After being shot down Cid's prize aircraft is reduced to a weird kind of speed boat. 24 "


"computer video games ELEMENTALS CRASH THE PARTY! Last month's feature explained how gem stones called Materia grant special powers. Materia allows FFVII characters to use powerful magic to destroy enemies, or else benefit from its healing power. The tiny round stones vary in colour to distinguish their properties, and are attached to accessories so that their power may be channeled through the user. However there is another, more potent variety of Materia which takes on a life of its own. Or rather the supernatural state of an elemental being! The materia which supports these elementals is ruby red, and is very rare. Red Materia is usually only found in key situations such as a major confrontation with Shin-Ra, or the arrival at a turning point in the game. Characters can only benefit from its effects once during a battle, and they eat up Magic Points big time. But once is all you need.

"computer video games 60% CORRIDOR BY EPIC MEGAGAMES  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE TBA COMPLETE LOUNGE AUTUMN RELEASE 1-50 PLAYERS ROM 2. RELEASED BY GT INTERACTIVE TEL: 0171 258 3791 ROM One of the games battling for Quake's «Best corridor death game» crown is Epic MegaGames' Unreal. Just how do they plan to do that? UNREAL ou might expect everyone to be completely fed up with corridor games. Ever since Doom rocked the world all those years ago there have been hundreds of copy-cat titles, and we're now seeing a load following hot on Quake's heels. The biggest ones on the way at the moment are Hexen 2 (see pages 20 and 21 for more on that), Quake 2, Prey and Epic MegaGames' effort, Unreal! What's it all about? Well, just take a look at the pictures and you'll see guns and monsters! Yeeee-hah! ................................ A WHA...? WHERE AM I? A THE EASIEST EDITOR EVER! IT'S REALLY HERE UNREAL! When you start to play the finished version of Unreal. the first thing you know is that you've awoke in a wonky prison cell with no memory of how you got there. After a bit of exploration, you discover a weapons cabinet with a shotgun inside. You pick it up, and eventually discover the way out of the building to find that you're in the middle of a green valley with a lake in the distance. The prison building you've just escaped from is actually a spaceship which has crash landed. You need to find out where you are, WHO you are, and where you're going! 100 100 The levels already have some very intricate sections. A big advantage that the PC has over consoles is the ability to customise a lot of the games. Unreal has a VERY comprehensive and easy-to-use editor which will be available with the game, and is being used by the developers to create the levels. The editor provides three wire-frame views of the level which allow you to see the exact structure and to place items accurately. In the bottom-left corner of the screen is a view of how the level will look in the final game, and you can move around the level in real-time in this window. If you want to change anything you see in this view, click on it and choose what you want to turn it into in one of the menu screens! Changing surface appearance is as easy as clicking on a wall, then the texture you want mapped onto it! And it's not just the levels that you can edit you can change the characteristics and artificial intelligence of all of the enemies just as easily. D G Watch out for the Bigman up on the ledge! NOOS ININO) DER 3 werd 00 O OBSERVE THE WONDERFUL DETAIL N MY GAME! 30 The weapons in Unreal are particularly excellent. This one seems to fire like the nailgun from Quake. "


"THE HEART OF UNREAL A computer Video games The game engine used for Unreal may look quite a lot like Quake's from the screenshots, but is actually very different. Of course, all the levels are completely 3D with full-3D enemies and items, but Unreal has very fancy lighting effects. Not only do certain items illuminate a level (rockets, torches, etc.) but there are lots of set effects to add to the atmosphere. Light ripples on the walls when around water, and clouds cast shadows on the floor when outside. It is also planned to have all enemies and characters casting real-time shadows so that you'll be able to see shadows creeping round the corners before you know who's there! ROM This small pistol fires rapidly and has an excellent reload animation. Anti-aliasing is one of developers' current favourite graphical techniques, letting them blur textures to smooth out any pixelation. Both the Nintendo 64 and the fancy PC accelerator cards like the 3DFX do this with their hardware. Unreal has software anti-aliasing, meaning that it'll work on any PC. When you get close to a wall or enemy, you'll really notice how you can't see each blocky pixel as you can in most similar games. I WANT MY HONEY 100289 PLEASE SELECT A CONFUSED WARRIOR WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY? The final version of Unreal should have a choice of playable heroes, male or female. This will mean that when you come to multi-player games, everyone will be able to look different, rather than just having loads of differently coloured clones. As with all the best PC games, Unreal is planned to be a big internet and network game. The current plan is to have games of around 50 people playing at once, with all sorts of special, features. Of course, the usual deathmatch mode will be the most popular find people, kill them but other options along the lines of capture the flag will add to the fun. IT'S REALLY HERE UNREAL! Some fantastic lighting effects! STO DIE, ALIEN SCUM! All enemies in Unreal are 3D polygon models, rather like Quake. The big difference is that they've been motion captured to make them move very smoothly, whereas Quake has animation frames removed to keep the speed up. There are some particularly cool enemies in Unreal. A giant tentacle which hangs from the ceiling grabs at anyone who goes near it, Similar to the giant plant in Resident Evil! Unfortunately, there was no dragon in the final version of Quake but never mind Unreal's got one! NOOS INIWUJ WHOAH! UNREAL, MAN! Though Unreal has been in development for absolutely ages, it still has a long way to go before release. At the moment, while the game engine is very impressive, it's still jerky even on a high-end PC. Hopefully this problem will be resolved before Unreal is released later this year. 1 This fat enemy has guns for 1 These \"Skaari arms and is currently called a creatures have blades for «Bigman\". Scary name or what? hands and move brilliantly! 31 "

Well, because it's one of the best fighting games ever, that's why! This time we're previewing the first English language version, due to be released in America soon as well as revealing some of Sega Europe's plans for changes to the final UK PAL version of the game. And it gives us an excuse to play the game some more! Hooray! FIGHTERS MEGAMIX BORN IN THE USAL BEHOLD THE POWER OF 13 TERS We've now got hold of a near-complete American version of Fighters Megamix, and there have been a few changes made. As you'd expect, all the text has been translated, but some of the ending screens have also been changed. As we expected, the risqué \"A Taste Of Honey\" has been removed. Don't worry, Sega UK aren't quite as strict as Sega America, and the original pictures will be left in for British gamers. COOL BRITANNIA!*** TASTE HONEY or parte Instead of Honey in her underwear, American gamers get Candy's old alternate costume. SHA The final UK PAL version of Fighters Megamix is going to have the English translations from the American version, but will also have a few other changes made especially for Britain. For a start, the two lower difficulty settings are being removed completely no more Easy and Very Easy for you lot. Instead Normal, Hard and Very Hard will become Easy, Normal and Hard respectively. Sega have also assured us that a few small glitches in the Japanese version will be removed, and AM2 are converting the game as well as they did with Virtua Fighter 2 full-screen, full-speed. Also, they're doing something else we wanted the music won't restart between rounds! Five cheers for AM2! SAMMAN 999 Oooh dear. Tokio with his shirt unbuttoned is too disturbing for American gamers, so they get a different, and a slightly feeble picture. HIDDEN PANDACHAN RING! NOOS ININO) We've shown you most of the hidden extras in Fighters Megamix already, but just wanted to let you in on another. If you fight on BM's rooftop stage as Kumachan in the alternate Pandachan costume, the viper logo on the ring transforms into an enormous panda face! 3 WINS 99. A full-length picture of the robot Dural is far too rude for our friends in the USA, so here's a terrible picture of her face. Gee, that's great.

While it's not very exciting, this picture shows how the option text is in English. As this is the American version, it's still got the Very Hard difficulty setting. 32 "


"computer video games *WHAT'S IN A NAME? Obviously, all the text in the game has been translated into English for the American version of the game. As with Fighting Vipers, Honey's name is now Candy, and some of the secret character names have been changed to make some sense in English. GET ON WIV YOUR WOOOORK! JOHN PUBLIC 99 GUESS WHO! It takes a bit of time to get it, but there's a hidden card matching game in Fighters Megamix similar to the one in Christmas NIGHTS. Your reward for spending a long time fiddling about is a go at matching a load of character faces to get a few extra pieces of artwork. Not really worth the hassle, but entertaining for a few seconds nonetheless. 1 WIN When Rentahero's batteries run out, he becomes plain old \"John Q Public\"! Boooring! 99. ? ? ? ? ? Interestingly enough, the palm tree is now called \"Palm Tree\". Excellent.

FLASHY MOVES! 99, TIGHTING As you should know, the Fighting Vipers can do power counters moves which make them flash white for a split-second then attack immediately. These are all easy to do and are most often used to avoid one attack then counter straight away. In Fighters Megamix, all of the Virtua Fighter characters can do power counters as well simply by pressing Backwards and all three attack buttons at the same time. While this technique is frowned upon by many VF purists, it can come in very handy and also does more damage than the standard version of the attack. Fighters Megamix doesn't just have a measly 22 completely original and varied characters from two of the best fighting games in existence it has another load of secret characters on top! As we've mentioned before, there are ten question marks on the fighter select screen, plus another costume for Candy, as well as Kumachan's two alternatives Mr Meat and Palm Tree.

BE PATIENT, CHILDRENI The training mode is one area which benefits from the English translation most, as you can now read the names of the moves. While you may think that the list of moves for each character is big (up to 100 for some fighters), there are loads more which aren't listed. None of the wall throws are listed, and neither are any moves for the secret fighters, giving you lots to discover yourself. Or you can just read a future issue of CVG which'll have them in. The official UK version of Fighters Megamix isn't due for release until June, so we all need to wait a bit longer to find out just how good AM2's conversion is going to be. We'll keep you posted!

THE FUTURE OF LA eal-time war games are very popular at the moment, with games such as Command & Conquer: Red Alert, Warcraft II and Diablo topping the charts as soon as they're released. Dark Reign is Activision's attempt to claim the warsim crown, and with Ron Millar (senior designer of Diablo, Warcraft II, StarCraft, etc.) on the team they can't fail, can they? It's set in the future during a war between the Imperium and the Freedom Guard, where the player needs to learn more about the history of the war and they planets on which it is taking place. And the most valuable resource? Water. THE FUTURE OF WAR MENU PATHS CONSTRUCT > AND CONOVER Dext <Local A REAL COMMAND & CONQUER BEATER?

You then send them off to wherever you want a new building and assign them with whatever you want built. The bots don't return once they've built a new structure, so you need to keep constructing more all the time. One thing which you can't do in Command & Conquer which Dark Reign lets you do is stack the construction of units you can set your factory to make 20 vehicles one at a time, then leave it to do so rather than starting each one yourself.

"


"computer video games I CAN'T SEE CLEARLY NOW I LIKE DRIVING IN MY ROBOT Dark Reign adds another factor to consider in the form of undulating terrain. Seeing as everything's not flat, units will slow down to get up steep hills and some sections can only be reached from certain angles. Also, having hills and valleys means that Dark Reign lets you use true line-of-sight to your advantage. You can now hide in a valley and someone at the top won't be able to see you until they move right to the edge of the cliff, and vice-versa. The \"shroud\" in Dark Reign (the black area which is uncovered as you explore a level) shows which sections of the level aren't in the line-of-sight of any of your troops by having a shaded area which changes as your units move around. This means that positioning look-outs and spies is important in Dark Reign to keep tabs on what your enemy is doing. ROM As Dark Reign is set in the future, there are some strange vehicles available. One of the most useful is the Spider vehicle which has four wheels on stalks beneath it, letting it get over the trickiest terrain at high speeds. The Scout Units have a longer line-of-sight than the other vehicles, and can morph into scenery to hide from the enemy! There are plenty more wonderful pieces of machinery to use in Dark Reign, each with its own uses.

COMMS A DA ARTIFISHAL * INTELLIJUNCE Controlling the troops and other units is easy to anyone who's ever played Command & Conquer before, as it's basically the same click on who you want to move, then click where you want them to go or what you want them to attack. Dark Reign adds a lot to this system, with the ability to set the way each of your units will act you can edit their \"autonomy\" level to set how much they depend on your commands, and change their \"tenacity\" setting to set just how determined they are will they retreat at the first sign of trouble or fight to the death? It's your decision, commander! A REAL COMMAND & CONQUER BEATER? Neutral There's a fierce battle going on here, probably over the water to the North. Without water, you can't get any money. Without money, you're stuffed. FREE MISSION BUILDER INCLUDED! The Dark Reign Mission Builder comes with the game, and is the most comprehensive so far in a strategy game of this kind. You can edit the layout by raising and lowering terrain, as well as adding water sections, different surfaces, and loads of pieces of scenery. You can switch through the varied level styles, with jungles, deserts, snowy mountains, and even an alien planet to choose from. Also, for DOOD one-player missions, you can set the intelligence of all the enemies you place, as well as setting the object of the level so that players don't just have to destroy everything. The excellent selection of strange vehicles is one of the best things about Dark Reign. ORDERS NEXT MONTH: IT'S REIGNING, IT'S POURING ODOO Dark Reign is coming on very nicely at the moment, but we probably won't get a finished copy in time for a review next issue.

"computer video games PLATFORM BY KONAMI  NES, SNES, MEGADRIVE VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD COMPLETE JUNE RELEASE 1 PLAYER PlayStation  RELEASED BY KONAMI TEL: 01895 853 000 PlayStation Dracula's Castle is said to surface only once every century. It sure doesn't seem like a hundred years since Castlevania on Mega Drive. But here it is, back on PlayStation! CASTLEVANIA IT LOOKS LIKE, IT SMELLS LIKE, IT IS... CASTLEVANIA! ampires are definitely back in fashion. At the moment, Paul, Tom and Ed are enjoying the chills and spills contained within Legacy Of Kain. Now however, the true vampire video game has risen from its unholy slumber. Castlevania! A game series starring none other the Prince of Darkness himself Count Dracula! A game in which you play a heroic vampire hunter, seeking to destroy the dark one. A game that takes place within Dracula's very home, the infamous Castlevania itself. The fourth episode was, without a doubt, one of the best platform games on Super Nintendo, and now the series returns. Those of you upset by Konami's tampering with the classic style of Contra on PlayStation, need not fear. Castlevania keeps all the 2D brilliance of old, but with the dazzling power of PlayStation behind it. And there's a unique twist to the formula, as we reveal on these pages... This tunnel is actually a loading screen. It's a brilliant idea and you don't even notice the CD loadVELCOME TO MY HOMEI While Castlevania has always been set within Dracula's Castle, this latest instalment takes the concept to the extreme. There are no separate stages as such, just one massive fortress to explore. As you progress you can bring up a map of how much you've discovered, and the size of the play area is astounding! You can freely move back and forth throughout the castle, in fact it's essential to, since there are tons of secret areas to uncover! ing. THE STORY SO FAR... Begin play and the words 'Final Level' appear. This is no mistake though, as this Castlevania continues right where SNES Castlevania IV left off. As such, this first level is a re-enactment of the previous final boss level. Taking the role of undead exterminator Richter Belmont (we thought he was called Simon, but what do we know?). you climb the steps to the tower at the top of Castle Dracula, to face off against the dread Count. After a gripping battle in which Dracula turns into a monster, the vile one is ultimately destroyed. End of story you'd think, but PlayStation Castlevania is only beginning! UDDETEREDE DENEUROLD OwwBALIFE ...AND NOWI Castle Dracula has surfaced again and you'd expect one of those meddling Belmonts to take up the challenge. Only problem is, the last Belmont mysteriously vanished four years previous. So to face the re-emergence of Dracula, his own son Alucard enters the fray. And that's the twist to PlayStation Castlevania you get to play a vampire! Wicked! 36 "


"computer video games THE WAY OF THE VAMPIRE Playing as Dracula's sibling is the single factor that distinguishes this new Castlevania instalment from previous episodes. Unlike Richter Belmont, who was only able to use a whip (albeit in various powered-up forms) and special icons, Alucard is a far more versatile creature, with a far greater range, of weaponry and abilities. And being a stylish vampire babehound, he gets to wear most the cool artifacts he finds. PlayStation WEAPONS With two hands, Alucard is able to use dual weapons which can assigned to the Square and Circle buttons. Various weapons have specific abilities (a stone sword is best used against a stone golem), and some weapons such as large swords need two hands to hold them. It's best though, to use one hand for a weapon and one for a shield. CAPES The ultimate accessory of the fashionconscious undead, capes also hold certain magical properties. Ones that we've so far come across grant partial invisibility, or, in the case of the blood cape, allow you to draw energy from enemy wounds. Each one has its own individual pattern too! POWERS OF DARKNESSI  IT LOOKS LIKE, IT SMELLS LIKE, IT IS... CASTLEVANIA! ARMOUR Forget the stake through the heart or sunlight, this vampire can be hurt by a prod with a spear. Hence, vampirical armour. All sorts of breast-plates can be worn, lowering any hits you receive. They don't ruin your Countly looks either. Alucard can perform complex Street Fighter-style specials! As you progress, the moves are revealed, but you can work some of them out for yourself! Projectile attack items are found throughout the game. Only one can be carried at a time, and as with previous Castlevanias, you need to find hearts to power them. JEWELLRY All manner of baubles can be worn, boosting your social standing and powers of darkness. Rings power-up Alucard's stats (dexterity for better hit-rate, constitution for increased strength). Two particular rings are required to activate floor entrance too. WOLF! MIST! UUELLE HEADWEAR Hats to increase intelligence and necklaces that improve your attacking powers, can all be worn on the head or around the neck. The coolest thing you can wear on the head though, are spectacles, as sported by Gary Oldman's Dracula. One particularly smart pair allow you to see evil vital later in the game. They even give the main sprite red eyes! There's also a snorkel for underwater exploration. There's an amazing amount of supernatural powers, which when found are switched on in the inventory. Among them are double-jump abilities and transformation into various strengths of wolf, bats and mist! NEXT MONTH! DRACULA SPECTACULAR! COMING SOON  OR We're going bats for this awesome game! The Japanese version is near enough complete and work on the UK version is already underway. Castlevania is coming and we're gonna bleed it for coverage! Bwa-ha-ha-haaaaaaaa! Sigh. This screen shows the game's diversity. There are six exits here, but two need items to open them! Despite the new features, many classic ideas remain. Candleholders still contain goodies! | "


"computer video games SPIDER SIM BY BOSS STUDIOS 60% COMPLETE  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  SATURN VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD APR RELEASE 1 PLAYER TM PlayStation  RELEASED BY BMG TEL: 0171 973 0011 PlayStation What's got eight legs, lots of body hair and scares people Not including Phil. It's spiders, and BMG bring them to your PlayStation. SPIDER pider represents a step into something that is very rarely seen in video games these days an original idea. But that doesn't immediately give the title an advantage, because when it boils down to it, people still go mad for fighting and driving sims, no matter how many times they have been seen. The basic idea behind Spider is that a small time researcher (Dr Michael Kelly) has invented a new chip which lets him project his knowledge into robotic machines. However a few bigwigs have caught hold of this. They storm his lab shooting him in the process, and as he is being dragged away, he uses his new found invention to imprint his consciousness into the body of a spider. And the game begins here as you assume control of the spider, trying to get back Dr Kelly's body. I HAVE THE WORST CASE OF SPIDER GRAPES EVER SEEN! THE WEB SLINGER STICKY FEET WARNING ARACNOPHOBES... SPIDER IS IN TOWN! If you are going for the various other power ups scattered around the stages, you need to make use of the web. By making your way underneath a platform and hitting jump, the spider detaches itself completely, apart from one small thread of web. This web will suspend you in the air, and by pressing up or down you can increase the length of it. Left and right swings you from side to side rather surprisingly! Spiders can walk along virtually any surface. Why else would you find them on your ceiling and climbing up the plug hole as you're about to run a bath. And this is a forte that Spider the game utilises as well. Any solid surface can be scaled, often leading to numerous hidden power ups or icons. The roof is also a useful vantage point as you can hang there to attack non-jumping enemies without sustaining any hits. FUNNY BONES Because of the experiments carried out by by Dr Michael Kelly, you are now able to collect various icons to power up your otherwise flimsy legs. You can only carry four items at a time, but each of these can be switched between at any given moment. FLAME Easy one this. Collect the icon and you receive a small amount of fuel giving you the ability to spit flames at baddies. ELECTRO This works in a very similar fashion to the flame, except it gives you a weaker strength but quicker lightning bolt instead. MINES strange weapon this. as once released it hovers just above the surface of the floor for a short while before exploding. Pointless! 1 You have to swing here to collect these power ups. 1 The icons provide clues as to which way to scale the walls. COMING SOON BOOMERANG HOMING MISSILES Since when do spiders explode when they die, eh? The shield will temporarily protect you from the flames. Possibly the most You only get three of effective weapon as it these, so it's best to always comes back. It try and avoid wasting, only inflicts an average them on normal eneamount of damage on mies.

We've found one that isn't. LLLLLLLLLLERE ELEVATOR ACTION RETURNS hat do you expect from a game these days? With even more emphasis being thrown into 3D since the advent of the 'super consoles' as it were, games companies are under increasing pressure to come up with the goods by revamping old titles. Even the old wily dogs at Capcom have beefed up Street Fighter and given way to polygons rather than sprites. Which is why it's always refreshing to see games designers returning back to the old days rather than harping on about them. Elevator Action marks a leap back to the 2D, sideways scrolling shoot-'em-ups similar to Rolling Thunder and Contra. The game doesn't attempt to do anything flash with the graphics or sounds, just playability. It's already available on import, but Sega are still unsure about whether to release it or not. Now if they had any sense... KART BRADFIELD E DIE BURRET JRD THE TAFF OF POWER POVER POWER GUN V680 SPEED SPEED SPEED ROLLING THUNDER + LIFTS = ELEVATOR ACTION!

AVON CALLING A NOOS INIWUJ Shooting people in the head with a pistol is cause you to start swinging fists and swipa sure way of killing them, but isn't always ing legs at the hapless enemy. Having said practical. So why not forget the handheld for that, a bit of pistol whipping is also the minute and get down to the bare essentials norm for Jad the Taff (who came up with by engaging in a bit of hand-to-hand comthat name?). Couple this with the violence bat? When an enemy gets close enough to mode on full, and you get loads of gratuyou, hitting the fire button will automatically itous splats of blood everywhere. Cool. When you begin a stage, only a small part is open for you to run around. The only way to open up the remainder of the levels, is to locate the red doors and enter them, but once you exit, the doors become redundant. If you happen to miss one of the data storage units though, the game flashes a huge 'caution' message on screen and directs you to the cupboard, saving a bit of your time in the process. CAUTION! :REDIT 40 "


"LOOK OUT BELOW! compute Vded game As you wander through the corridors, disposing of various enemies, keep an eye out for the small items fixed to the ceiling. Light bulbs and sprinkler systems can be shot to the fall onto the heads of enemies, the benefit of this being that you get a bonus for your troubles. Also look out for the cardboard boxes on the ground, as some of those hold a small cluster of bombs which destroy virtually everything on screen. Shooting the lights also makes the corridor you're currently in go dark, and it is possible to plunge whole sections of the buildings into temporary darkness by shooting the main fuse sockets. You'll often hit these accidentally, and as yet we're unsure if they have any effect on the game, but it looks nice all the same! 0024000 PRESS START BUTTON CREDIT 3 The rocket stops everything that gets in it's way. WE NEED MORE BLOOD: For all of the squeamish out there, the game features a 'it'll please your mum mode' which enables you to switch the level of violence from the rather weak 'normal' mode to the excellent 'normal' mode where blood splats appear and dribble down the wall when someone is shot. Very gruesome. No flashy intro here, just a few Manga style cut scenes. But it's still cool!

F WHEEL OF FORTUNE You know about the red doors, but the blue ones are also pretty beneficial to you. Stepping inside one of these will reveal a small 'Wheel of Fortune' type affair containing every icon it is possible to pick up, and all you have to do is stop it to collect your bonus. One small tip that works about 90% of the time is to hold down on the joypad as soon you enter a room, and you should select the bomb icon. 001 PRESS START BUTTON PRESS START BUTTON 820 1 78 Luculliri NEXT MONTHGOING UP? 6 boy !

"computer video games %07 3D PLATFORM BY ACTIVISION  ANCIENT PREDECESSORS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD COMPLETE TM PlayStation LATE 97 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY ACTIVISION  TEL: 01895 456 700 TM PlayStation Just like Mario and Sonic, another seminal small-screen star gets his own 3D game. If only to prove that Pitfall Harry is no stick in the mud (though he has come close several times). PITFALL 3D itfall Harry was revolutionary when he first appeared on the Atari VCS in the early 80s, so has had a lot to live up to since then. While Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure broke new ground in terms of who it had on board to produce it, the gameplay on offer turned out pretty obvious. Activision had taken an old 8-bit title and dressed it up for the 16bit crowd perhaps just a little too late to capture any more imaginations they all belonged to Castlevania and Gunstar Heroes. Now Harry looks set to make a bigger impact, coming to PlayStation this year with a game which sets new standards of excellence in 3D games. AIN'T NO JUNGLE JIVE NO MORE PITFALL HARRY SWINGS IN A NEW DIRECTION! I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU WAY TO GO HARRY! Activision have been hard at work getting some of the best behind-the-scenes people from the entertainment industry involved, to make Pitfall 3D happen. Conceptual designers, responsible for inventing Harry's new world and its creatures, include a LucasFilm artist who has contributed to the new Star Wars trilogy. To assist with the animation of complex 3D characters, Activision hired a couple of ex-Sega Japan employees (actually one is Australian, the other is French but they worked for Sega Japan). The hired talent has paid off, with a distinctive and 3D world taking shape. The Pitfall concept is almost as old as video gaming, hailing from a time when the name of a game would tell you exactly what it was about Jet Pac, Lunar Lander, Asteroids, and so on. Activision's biggest contribution to video games is the 'pitfall', crossed by a swinging vine. Could be that if it weren't for Pitfall there may never have been a Castlevania series! In Pitfall 3D the swinging vine now gives Harry a choice of four directions instead of the traditional two. Could be tricky. In fact it's not. While Harry swings, players just nudge the directional up, down, left, or right to change the swing. The 3D vine has allowed Activision to hide more secrets from players, as well as present them alternative routes through any level. First thing Activision required to make Pitfall 3D happen, was take Harry out of the jungle. Seems a little strange, since the jungle is what Pitfall has been traditionally about, but there are good reasons. And those reasons are called trees. Apparently trees require an awful lot of processing to create whole forests of them in 3D, SO were abandoned early on. Now Harry finds himself in volcanic territory all rocks and crags where a heavy fall is likely to hurt a lot more! It's also much less predictable. The play area is true 3D, and Harry is required to dodge in and around obstacles as well as just hop over from left to right, above and below. This is much closer to how Mario 64 or Tomb Raider works than Crash Bandicoot or Pandemonium. However the player's viewpoint is fixed by the developers the producer of Pitfall 3D explained that he didn't want 'camera' control to obstruct the player's enjoyment of the game. THE WHIP TAKES A TRIP MORE PITFALL 3D SOON! Along with the jungle, Harry's Indiana Jones style bullwhip has gone too. Again this is due to polygon processing, which requires complicated routines to manage the behaviour of such a tool. In its place Harry totes a magic staff, which morphs into a more powerful and visually impressive version when Harry collects a specific icon. Most of Harry's time is taken dealing with the challenges of terrain, but the staff allows him to deal with enemies who get too close. A thorough playtest of Pitfall 3D is an opportunity we hope to have soon. When we do, you'll be the first to know all about it. Should be very interesting, folks, so keep in touch! Concept sketches of a few of the forms Harry's magic staff can adopt. 42 "

But does 3D enhance or affect the gameplay? TUNGThe ROATA nies' mof great tyle, th ince it began in 1992, Sega's Shining series has presented some stiff competition for other companies' most popular RPGs. Thanks to a bunch of great characters and an endearing graphical style, the Shining games are always ones to look forward to. They're not especially original-Shining Force I & Il bear many similarities to Nintendo's Fire Emblem games but that's a quality hard to find in any RPG other than the most early examples on Nintendo. Team Sonic have their own special brand of humour, and always a great tale to tell through their games. Shining The Holy Ark marks a welcome return to the first-person perspective of Shining In The Darkness Team Sonic's first RPG on Mega Drive. Thanks to the Saturn's way superior capabilities, their imaginations have been allowed to run wild! FIGHT ACTION FROM A FRONT LINE PERSPECTIVE LATEST IN POPULAR SHINING RPG SERIES CLASSIC STYLE RPG OVERHAUL Confrontations with monsters are a regular occurrence, right from the very first dungeon. Players used to the Shining series' friendly menu system should have no problem here. Everyone else must learn to adapt very quickly! The action is viewed from the eyes of the main hero, while the rest accompany him from behind. Enemies appear in a variety of imaginative ways: bats sometimes fly from behind, overhead; ghosts float out of walls from the left or right; zombies stroll into view Frankenstylee; and imps hop in from all sides. It's very cool. Occasionally the hero party have a premonition of danger, displayed as a cartoon flash on screen, which allows the player to make sure everyone's healthy before proceeding. In the heat of the battle, enemies strike directly at YOU, and partners are seen jumping into the fray when they make their move. It's obvious that the new Sega Graphics Library has helped the production of Shining The Holy Ark a great deal. Though the textures may look quite rough compare compared to recent PlayStation and N64 titles, the solidity of 3D is superb. Consequently Team Sonic have been able to generate some cool 3D worlds, which are explored from a first-person perspective at all times. Yes, even the towns and villages are full-blown 3D not just the dungeons. In a short matter of time, players become fully immersed in this environment, helped along by a cool system which allows players to look up and down, left or right from a standing position. Standard movement is simply achieved by pressing up to go forward. back to walk back, and left or right to rotate 90° in those directions. HP 15 HP HP 12 Ouch! That really hurt! You Go for it! Use the magic! won't get away with it though... Hyuk! Hyuk! COMING SOON LA 1 Explore the villages as though you were really there, in solid 3D. 1 Check up and down to find other means of escape from danger.  50  Take that, you...you... whatever you are! 1 Look left and right before chancing a run across corridors. 44 "


"IF THEY COULD SEE ME NOW computer Video games Presentation is everything in an RPG, and Team Sonic have done well to dress up what could otherwise have been very serious-looking game. The graphic style of Shining The Holy Ark depends heavily on CG renders, but this is backed up by manga portraits of the characters during conversation. Where the CG content comes into its own, however, is through the intermittent FMV sequences, and each time a character Levels Up', where they are seen to gain power through a brief animated pose move. Yeah, we like that. SAMURA LV 3 EAHP 27 ANP 11 x 27 Mo 17 BE # 9 VP-t 31 BS FLARE 5 L3 Cl2 1 Team Sonic have their own cool style when it comes to dramatic use of CG FMV. 1 Each time a character's status increases we're shown a neat animation sequence. Od HP XOT HP 22 HP 26 LATEST IN POPULAR SHINING RPG SERIES Santander LATEST IN POPULAR SHINING RPG SERIES PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT The Shining series' menu system is one of the best user interfaces we've ever encountered. Though it allows for a comparable amount of instructions to other RPGs, the appearance is more user friendly than most. At the press of a button, a group of four icons appears at the bottom of the screen, tailored to suit the current situation exploration of battle. So in the case of a battle, the initial four choices are attack, defend, use an item, or run away. Highlight any one of these and a further four choices are presented, for example in what manner you would like to attack. This is a very speedy system, which is essential for use against fast-moving enemies. It also helps in the quick exchange of cash for goods, and hassle free conversation with towns people. Enemies in outdoor locations are much stronger! xo P4 HP 15 HP HP 15 0-1 HP 14 HP BE You can refer to the menu system at any time, to examine status or whatever. You want magic? You got it! You want to eat a snack now? You got that too! Animation is fairly jerky, but the overall effect of being attacked by this kind of guy is scary!  SEGA COMING SOON SHINING A LIGHT Situations affect the choic es on the menu system: battle, exploration, and so on.

"computer video games SEGA SATURN RPG ROUND-UP SPECIAL TURN In response to the many letters we have received on the subject, CVG is here to provide Saturn users with a Rough Guide to the pick of its RPGs. lot of attention is focused on PlayStation at the moment because of one game which happens to be an RPG. However dedicated Saturn users have been begging CVG for news of RPG releases for a long time. To coincide with Sega Europe's plans to release Shining The Holy Ark, we've compiled this shortlist of titles which we think also ought to be considered. SPODED BY DA HOBBIED THOD There's no use pretending that it's easy playing through most Japanese RPGs, unless you can read the language. That said, it is possible to gain a lot from struggling on. It's worth checking with your importer if they know anyone else who has played the game, to see if they can put you in touch with an expert in case you get stuck. However we've been careful to choose ones here which don't present too many 'brick walls'. Thing is, if you're nuts about awesome graphics and great music, you're probably happy to savour what you can! So just enjoy the rest of the feature.

In Japan you OOOOOOOOOOOOO kay we admit that this one is a real tough one to get into, even if you are a native Japanese! BUT the rewards are worth the struggle it takes to get going. From our experience Terra borrows a lot from Sakura Wars/Shining Force, while utilising some of the elements in Dragon Force. Battles are treated as strategic exercises, taking into account the whole force as fighter is standing on. Those fightone, as opposed to individuals ing uphill are in a worse off posiworking toward the same goal. tion to those attacking from Between times mission briefings above.

"computer video games SAKURA WARS DEVELOPED BY RED 2 CDs DB @ ECA SATUR The heroes in this tale masquerade as actors, using a big old theatre in the heart of old Tokyo as their HQ. Sakura, the heroine in the game, looks innocent in her traditional attire, as do the rest of here team. However when duty calls they transform, Thunderbirds style, into giant robot battle suits to seek and destroy! Sakura Wars is a beautifully presented game, in which there are two distinct styles the anime used in the character/plot development sections, and the detailed CG rendering of the battle scenes. In the first case players are treated to minimally animated anime portraits of the characters, where interaction is done through a cursor which ontst changes shape according to the ! options available ie talk, look, * 12 ! knock, pick up, etc. Occasionally these 2D scenes break out into a Shining Force I and II on Mega full blown anime sequence to Drive should feel right at home with explain the story better.

Micro Machines 13 finally arrives, and in style. We all know it IGEN looks great, but is it any good? SEHOIH ENDATION RECON Micro Machines SCALE he PlayStation and Saturn have brought the arcade experience closer to the home than ever before. But if there's one thing missing from both systems' libraries, it has to be a good multiplayer game. Sure we've had some great two-player games, and four can enjoy most sports sims, but what about eight? What game could possibly meet the demands of eight sweaty-palmed individuals? Only the latest instalment in the successful Micro Machines series no less. A game that has promised much and is now ready to deliver, big time! Study these pages carefully, you're gonna learn to love this game! ATURES YOU LIKE THE WHEELS DON'T YOU? THHHWEEEDEEEE! Micro Machines Orange Anyone who has followed the previous instalments of Micro Machines, knows that there are cars and courses a-plenty on offer. MMV3 is no different, and offers more than ever before. There are 32 different vehicles to race, each with their own attributes sports cars are fast and skiddy, trucks slow but better at cornering. Vehicles are assigned to certain tracks courses with big jumps require fast cars, while circuits that have lots of twists need a slower vehicle with better handling. There are 48 courses to master, each set in the now famous MM locations. The breakfast tables, chemistry lab, classroom, snooker tables, garden, restaurant and beach are all here, looking better than ever before in glorious 3D! Much reported and obviously a major selling point for the game, are the 3D environments the races take place in. No MM game has looked this good before. The cars race around (and on) solid 3D models. Add the amazing light sourcing, reflective surfaces and the roaming camera view and the result is dazzling. Not only does this 3D world make cosmetic differences, but it also adds to the playability. The 3D allows you to understand the layout and intricacies of each track, much easier than in the older MM games. 0.59 2: CLASS 3D Rock Project 0.27 02 0.1783 LAPS 1 Some circuits from previous MM games return in a remixed form.

"V COOL THING 1 1 404 IT IS A GOOD DAY TO CRY! TO computer video games nnnn When heavier vehicles go around tighter bends and corners, they tip onto two wheels until they regain balance. A minor detail but it adds to the Micro Machine magic. V COOL THING 2 New to MMV3 are the Prize Cars and the Keepsies mode of play. Prize cars are awarded when you finish first place in a tournament race, or when you beat a previous best lap time in the Time Trial mode. Your Prize Cars can then be driven by yourself in the Test Drive mode, or if your feeling confident in the Keepsies mode. In a Keepsies race, each player selects one of their prize cars and then race each other on a selected track. The winner gets to keep opponents prize cars, providing you don't already have the same vehicle in your collection. If you are already in possession of the same motor, you get to destroy the loser's car! HA HA! PlayStation Vehicles, such as the police car and ice-cream van, have their own specific horn sounds. Press the horn and the police car turns on its' siren. The ice cream van plays childrens music! LEVEL 1 V COOL THING 3 COCTION \"Scotia When each race is loading, there are little symbols in the top-right of the screen , to indicate what to expect on the next track. See if you can figure out some of these. STARE Hmm, waves, jumps, a splat. Weird? COMMENT LAPS  COOL THING 4 The complete beginner can learn a basic course in Micro Machine mad skills, by entering Cherry's driving school. Finish the five quick courses and you'll be ready to take on the best. For me the original Micro Machines on NES was one of the best games ever, until the near-perfect Mega Drive Micro Machines 2 bettered the formula. Now Version 3 arrives, and it's the perfect evolution of the series! The transformation of the razorsharp style into realistic 3D is perfect. I was worried about the way the 'camera' would move to accomodate the action (it was a bit distracting in earlier versions), but the final version is problem-free. Codemasters know it's the spot-on gameplay that makes Micro Machines such a hit, and while they've spent a lot of effort on the graphics (which are truly incredible), they've made sure V3 plays exactly like its predecessors. As before, the game shines brightest in multiplayer mode this is one of the best multiplayer games made! Final Fantasy VII may have sold PlayStations in Japan, but I think Micro Machines Version 3 will do the trick in the UK. TOM GULSE 3 COULD IT BE MAGIC? = Micro Machines New to the series in MMV3 are power-ups! Gift wrapped parcels which appear dotted around the courses, each containing a special power-up. For the purists there is the option to turn power-ups off during multi-player games, but we think they'll be leaving them on! 0.57.90 LAPS REVIEWER Ca Sc CLAW MALLET A giant mallet is attached to the front of your vehicle, now start smashing! A large expandable claw, grab the vehicle in front and toss it behind you. ELAMEYBAL Zr Nb Turns you into a flaming mass, touch the other vehicles to gain an advantage. 1.123 With each new version of MMV3 that we've received, I've gotten more and more excited. Now after what seems a very long wait, the finished version arrives. Unlike another recent big sequel multi-player race game, that disappointed at first, MMV3 is immediately brilliant. From the moment the game loads, from the options screen, to the moment you've completed every tournament, the game delivers. This is also a game to play with friends, lots of them. The amount of different play options is great, adding to some long-lasting enjoyment. I'll ignore the small glitches in the graphics, they don't effect the play. All can say is thank you Codemasters. Thanks for not rushing the game out, for taking your time, for getting everything right. You've done yourselves proud. Well Done! ALEX HUTALA 1 1 LABS Keaner LAPS 522    3 INVISIBILITY MINE Difficult for people to see you, including yourself! A bit tricky this one.

Turn the page to see how Micro Machines V3 should really be played! FORCE FIELD SPEED UP It's not original or ground-breaking, but it plays brilliantly.

"computer video games THE CVG ALL INVITATIONS MICROMACHINES VB CHALLENGE PlayStation It's challenge time once again, and what better game to test the team spirit than the PlayStation's greatest multiplayer game Micro Machines V3! S ONO PAUL TOM JAIME MIKE EDDIE ALEX STEVE PHIL GROUP 2 RACE 1 FORMULA X ou've read the review on the previous page but, like it says, here's how to really play the game. Over the years and through the series of Micro Machines, Codemasters have proved that they know how to make a good fun multiplayer game. During the past few weeks several office grudge matches have been contested over this beauty of a game. Now is a time to bring all the mere mortals together, for The Hive Brain has commanded it. We can wait no longer we need to find a champion! GROUP 1 RACE 1 BREAKFAST AT CHERRYS The first race of the day, takes place on a tricky breakfast table circuit. Phil takes an early lead, he keeps repeating winner! \"Dawsuuun\" to put everyDAANSUN one else off. Paul can't get to grips with the controls, and everyone except Phil keeps asking \"which one am l\"? Phil quickly wins the race amid the confusion. Mike 0 Phil 30 Steve 20 Paul 10 The first race for the hardcore is set around a lab experiment and is very fast. Ed starts repeating his name, but manages to be even less humorous than Phil. Alex claims \"I've never played this game before\", Jaime swears a lot, blaming the course. Tom is a figure of pure concentration, he doesn't blink the whole race. Alex gets a fireball power-up \"I shall use the gift of fire to destroy Ed\". Ed starts making strange noises until he wins the race.  Ed 30 Alex 20 Tom 10 Jaime 0 Micro Machines m PRE-GAME SPECULATION Though we didn't place any hard cash down on the table, there was much debate over who the favourite would be. Past and present form was analysed, with MMV3 experience also playing a part. Ed emerged as a favourite, he's just so spawny at games (sometimes skilled, but usually spawny). Tom's bragging, about how he had enjoyed the MM series was seen by some as a bluff, but still placed him high in the rankings. Jaime the Mario Kart devotee could easily adjust to the MMV3 style, and Alex who wrote the review were both likened for places on the podium. The rest of the pack comprised of Steve who many felt could surprise, Paul who hadn't played the game, and Mike who had been spied practising, but most thought would only walk away with the wooden spoon. So CVG were all accounted for, but we needed an eighth person to make up the numbers. The Micro Goblin gracefully declined (though he easily beat Ed in practising), which left Phil Dawson aka the Cosmic Cracker to take his place, who those in the know felt could be the dark horse of the tournament.

Phil keeps repeating his name, but it's not so funny anymore so soon stops. Paul starts to get a bit better with the controls, but the race is between Steve and Phil.

They each have their own reasons for wanting the sword, and they have each heard different stories about its power some want to use it to save their people, and others know just how evil it is and want to destroy it forever.

As you'll know if you saw our feature on the Japanese version of Soul Edge, the introduction sequence is one of the best yet seen on any console! It's a lot longer than most intros and shows all of the characters in some amazing action sequences! The sequence has been slightly changed for the British and American versions of Soul Blade, with Li Long's nunchukus replaced with his bendy metal stick and Sophitia now wearing a vest while bathing! THE MISSING NUNCHUKUS In the intro sequence, Sophitia now wears a white vest! Doh!

HANDS UP F YOU USE IMPACT GUARDI WEAPON GRAPPLESI Blocking in Soul Blade can work in a few different ways. Simply holding the Guard button will make your character defend themselves with their weapon, meaning that it gets damaged instead of their health bar. Not only does this mean that you could be disarmed, but it also has quite a long recovery time, stopping you from instantly coming back at your enemy with a counterattack. This is where Impact Guarding comes in. If you do a quick attack just as you're about to be hit, you can knock an enemies' weapon and stun them for a split-second, just enough time for you to hit back! If both fighters do a vertical attack at the same time, chances are that their weapons will lock in a grapple. In this situation, you need to bash on the buttons to break out of the lock, giving you a free hit when you do so! Each button will beat one of the others, a bit like the old \"paper-scissors-stone\" game, leaving you to guess which button your opponent is pressing.

"computer Video games * NOW I AM THE MASTERI TAKI MITSURUGI The best PlayStation-only feature of Soul Blade is the brilliant Edge Master Mode, and it's improved even more now that it's in English! Each character has their own story which is told through the pages of a book as you play the game. Each page gives you more of a story as you search for the Soul Edge sword, explaining exactly why you are scrapping with all of the different enemies. For example, playing as Hwang you pass along a cliff edge and get nicked on the cheek by a poison arrow from an assassin below. You then need to beat Li Long the assassin with throwing techniques before the poison sets in and kills you! And sure enough, if you play as Li Long, you spend some time as an assassin positioned in the same area! Being able to read the story adds a lot to the atmosphere, though it's certainly not essential to sit through every page of the book.

The controls in Soul Blade are fairly simple you just use Guard, Horizontal Attack, Vertical Attack, and the Kick button to do all the moves and combos.

This sends your character into a very impressive quick combo, but also takes one third of their weapon power. While the Critical Edge is fairly powerful on its own, it's possible to add a sequence of button presses just as the combo finishes to extend the move by a few hits, doing even more damage! These combos are the most impressive to look at in the game, and can be very helpful when used at the right time. Soul Blade's practice mode is excellent, very much like Tekken 2's, and gives players the perfect opportunity to master the game. For a start, it's got a complete moves list which can be called up at any time, meaning that there's no need to learn from sheets of paper or an instruction book. Also, you can make the game display the directions and buttons you are pressing at the bottom of the screen so you can see exactly where you're going wrong, plus it shows how much damage each attack is doing and whether they are hitting high, middle or low!

The practice mode shows you how to do the strings of moves, but the best way to win is mastering floating combos. Some moves will knock your opponent into the air, giving you enough time to recover and hit them again before they hit the floor, leaving them defenceless! In Edge Master mode you sometimes need to use floating combos to win, and your choice of weapon for the fight becomes very important make sure you pick a fast weapon or you won't have a chance of winning!

FRESS 2P STARE You cannot deny that Soul Blade is a superb fighting game. But at the same time, it still doesn't match up to Tekken 2 for me. The first thing you notice about Soul Blade are the superb graphics. The fluidity of the fighters and the extravagant lighting effects will impress anybody. And the rendered intro is perhaps one of the greatest seen yet. But there just isn't the scope or depth found in Tekken. The number of moves in SB is quite limited, and and you often find yourself repeating the same moves over and over, hence the fights can become boring. There are nowhere near as many characters compared to those found in Tekken, so lastability suffers even more. It is still a great game, but not the best of it's kind on PlayStation. Steve 1.68 When you win a round, you can move and zoom the replay camera view around by moving the D-pad and pressing the Square and Triangle buttons! SOLBLADE BELLE ENDSI REVIEWER When you complete Soul Blade in Arcade mode, you don't get a rendered end sequence as you may expect. Instead, the endings show the characters exactly as they look in the game, in real-time! Not only is the movement of them excellent, thanks to Namco's motion-capture, but it's also possible to alter the course of the end story! For example, Seung Mina is normally stabbed by her father when she returns home, but it's possible to dodge the attack and earn his respect! These brilliant endings give you a reason to finish the game over and over with each character. Namco manage to do exactly what everyone wishes for from their arcade-toPlayStation conversions. Many fans would be perfectly happy with a \"plain old» perfect conversion, but Namco always go further by adding brilliant new features the INCREDIBLE introduction sequence and the brilliant Edge Master Mode in Soul Blade, for example. To be honest, I was dreading the UK PAL version of Soul Blade after the slow translation of Tekken 2, but thankfully the speed here is almost identical to that of the arcade and Japanese versions. Of course, Soul Blade plays just as it did in the arcade, meaning that it's very easy to do impressive attacks and still have combos and tricks to master. Thing is, you reach a point where you feel there's not much more to do, and once you've collected all of the weapons from the Edge Master Mode and finished the game with everyone, one-player mode goes stale. Of course, two-player mode is the best part, but it still isn't as intuitive, or as fast as say, Tekken 2 or Virtua Fighter 2. Even still, Soul Blade is one of the best 3D fighting games around, and is a fantastic showcase for both Namco and the PlayStation. 60 LOMAS The evil Soul Edge is defeated and you finally claim the sword!

This is just another of \"those\", games which, while not completely terrible, has nothing to make it worth buying.

Fighters Megamix is on the way, but first we get... SHETTO (4 MANEX SuperBike MANXT SuperBike ith the exception of a few games such as Panzer Dragoon Zwei and NIGHTS, the Saturn has thrived almost solely on excellent arcade conversions. And none have proved more supremely awesome than Sega's own AM division coin-op titles. The Saturn has built a solid reputation for being the only home machine where you'll find nearperfect conversions of all Sega's major arcade games always reproduced with spot-on gameplay. Whenever AM2, AM3 or AM Annex release a new machine into the arcades, you know you're looking at next year's hot Saturn games. So when Manx TT blew us away in the arcades last year, we expected a red-hot Saturn racer. Hell, the game even advertised Sega Saturn on roadside banners. Our faith was unquestionable. WELCOME TO THE ISLE OF MAN! If you haven't played the coin-op, or didn't read our feature last month (you interested in games or what?), here's what Manx is about. It's based on the Isle Of Man Tourist Trophy challenge the World's oldest existing motorcycle road race! Every summer, 37 and three-quarter miles of country lanes and village streets are converted into the infamously lethal racetrack, on which the famed 900+CC motorbikes battle it out. The game features an accurate replica of said course. For the coin-op AM3 filmed the roads to help produce authentic graphics. What you get is a dangerously snaking, rolling race track set across convincing British countryside surroundings! Castrol 6/  OTORCYCLE NEWSCAST THE HOME STRETCH! The real Isle of Man TT is made up of all manner of different races, the Superbike Challenge being just one.

Positi Causse Pau CourseMap 7/8 00:36:32 REVIEW The split-screen Versus Mode in Manx is quite impressive.

"computer video games GET READY TO RACE! Okay, here it is the raceway! Just like the coin-op, the Saturn version features two tracks, divided up out of the roads.

BESTEH 1 RP The coin-op featured an impressive replica-bike cabinet that used an Active Motion System to lean precisely about, while giving feedback when hitting things. To best simulate this control system, the Saturn version utilises the analogue controller. This allows you the same degree of fine-tilting. The coin-op's tactile response isn't there of course. However, the Left and Right triggers are also analogue, accurately mimicking the throttle grip and brake lever! Castro When Manx TT was released into the arcades, I was blown away! The incredible graphics, coupled with the fantastic machine pumping out a powerful engine noise, made the experience exhilarating. I was never expecting a Saturn version that could match the coin-op's thrills, but I was hoping for a home racer on par with Sega Rally. It's nowhere near in the same league. The graphics, while not amazing, are smart enough. And, when using the analogue pad, you can see that the handling matches the coin-op's. The problem is, it all seems a bit rushed. The intermission screens are unexciting and ugly, and the sounds are poor repetitive annoying speech, a pathetic engine noise and warbling music. The biggest downside though is the lack of game. Okay, the arcade only had two tracks, but more could have been done here. One extra track would have made a big difference. And weather conditions or a night race would have added more variety. Simply reverse mirroring the tracks isn't enough. There's a serious lack of options too. No catch-up or head-start settings for two-player mode make it quite dull. A reasonable conversion, and a *decent' game, but this should have been the one to beat Rally. A missed opportunity and I wouldn't buy it.

PORSCHE na|||enae he trouble with luxury sports cars is that most of us will never get the chance to drive one, let alone own! Not so the Boxster the new ,000 object of desire from Porsche. If you've got a PlayStation, you're about to get the chance to take the Boxster out for a spin, racing against other Boxster owners to prove who's the best. Working with technical data supplied by the Boxster's designers, Sony have managed to produce more than a race game this is a simulation! With the cars all handling just like the real thing. Add realistic racing environments, including Porsche's own Stuttgart test circuit, and Porsche Challenge starts looking like a very tasty game indeed. 5th 58: 43 blo M1 18: 23 48:3 THE BOXSTER 'Challende PORSCHE We can't write about this game without telling you a few nuggets of info about the car itself. The Boxster is the only all-new Porsche from the German Zuffenhausen base in 19 years. Its six-cylinder horizontally opposed engine is tamper-proof, sealed away in the middle of the car. We could tell you about all the technical stuff the five-speed Triptronic S transmission system, mono-block brake callipers and motorised duck tail spoiler, but we don't know what all that stuff means. We do know it has a top speed of 150 mph, and can go from 0 to 62 mph in 6.9 seconds. Oh, and it's got the world record for opening the roof, the button-operated cabriolet roof can fold away in under twelve seconds. Pretty impressive eh? DRIVERS REVIEW For more info, there's an FMV 'making of the Boxster' segment contained within the game. With everyone speeding around in one type of car, the drivers of each Boxster play an important part in creating some individuality. Each driver has their own distinct coloured car, as well as likes and pet hates, eg. Dan the kick boxer hates Beats the DJ, but loves Rachel the model. Drivers rivalry develops during the competition, with drivers who hate one another deliberately 'cutting' each other up. Each driver also has their own distinctive soundtrack to race by. The game contains what Sony have called 'SPU streaming', as the action changes, the music also changes beats get faster if you're running out of time, and the other drivers music blends with your own, if they get close. CE Challenge 64 150 polygons have gone into the making of each driver, and it does make them individually different! "

The Alpine circuit is full of hairpin bends and black-ice, the final location is Japan, with wide streets, tight corners and lots of pagodas. There are six different races available on each of the locations. The tracks are similar to the Ridge Racer style, of one circuit with different routes available in later races. Each location has a short, long and interactive course, with the final three courses being mirrors of the first three. This gives you a total of 24 courses.

Your first lap might be short, the next long, and so on. What makes the interactive circuits more interesting is the inclusion of short-cuts. At first play these are well hidden, and even if obvious they are hard to access. Essential for shaving seconds off your time, and beating your rivals who will definitely resort to the same tactics. Two players can race head-to-head with the aid of a horizontal split-screen. No more lugging your PlayStation round to a mate's house. If one player is an expert then use the Delay function, so the beginner can gain a head start. Also to keep duels fair there's a Catch Up option, whereby the trailing driver will be given a speed boost allowing them to stay in the race.

Another PlayStation racer that manages to find a gap in the glut of racers out there. Although Challenge isn't the best racer on the market, it comes pretty close. Think of it as a cross between Hard Drivin' and Ridge Racer with a wealth of interesting ideas and great presentation throughout. The cars and circuits all look realistic, the only nega tive aspect aired by many, is that it's a little boring. This is caused by there only being six cars on the large tracks at a time, often giving the impression that you're the only car on the road. It's one of those games missing something vital, which you can't quite put your finger on. Some extra courses would have been nice, plus some different cars. Ultimately Porsche is a game that plays better than it looks (and it looks good), but there's not enough to keep bringing you back. ALEX 4WTALA position 5th REVIEW RATING BATING Another great PlayStation racer, with some neat ideas, smart graphics and playability. Only let down by the variety of courses and opposition. Well worth a look. This is an easy shortcut, go through the gates to cut a huge corner off the course. 0 "

RELEASED BY SONY TEL: 0171 287 7803 PlayStation Sony try to cash in early on all the RPG hype at the moment, by releasing a fairly old classic, Kings Field. KINGS FIELD I'M THE FIRESTARTE on't read anything into the quote \"It's big in Japan.\" Their tastes differ a huge amount from ours, and the fact that they love Shampoo (the band) is a big testament to that. Same applies to games as well as tacky pop groups, which is where Kings Field fits in. This title became a cult hit in the Far East. Kings Field 2 and 3 have already been released to follow up the original version, but until now none of those games have infiltrated these shores. Recent trends in RPGs have leaned away from the first person perspective, but KF represents a jump back to those days. You control Alexander, a Knight sent out by the King to retrieve the Moonlight Sword. As you journey towards the Island of Melahat, your ship becomes wrecked and you are the only survivor... the usual stuff. So it's here that the game begins... ................ Although you start the game with only a dagger, you can carry an awful lot more. Together with acquiring medicinal herbs for example, you may also learn magic spells. If you come across the relevant crystals, they contain the information you need to learn the ability to summon various other projectiles. SE 1 The fire and wind magic are just two of the wide range, of spells available to you. Although they are initially weak, their strength rises as you reach higher levels. KINGS FIELD WHO ATE ALL THE PIES? As well as locating the chests and finding items that others have dropped, you can buy objects from various people who you bump into. Not everybody has their own shop, but one guy who does is Al Hunt. Go into his hut and he is sitting at the table scoffing his face. Talk to him and he mutters something along the lines of \"Why am I always so hungry\", then offers to sell you something. To begin with, all you can afford is the leather shield, but keep a mental note of where he's at because he has some cool stuff that would benefit you greatly. A PINT OF YOUR FINEST, LANDLORD HP 180 MP 195 REVIEWER Herbs heal your energy to the tune of 40 or so points, but when a more substantial dose is required other methods can be called upon. The Earth Crystal gives you healing powers via magic, but using the Crystal Flask is generally better. This is basically a little hip flask which you can keep filling every time you come across a fountain or pond. The water from these completely fill your energy, free of charge! This has to be one of the most boring games I have ever had the misfortune to play. How this has become as successful as it has is completely beyond me. First of all why so s...I...0...w? It trundles along at such a tedious pace. Trying to kill characters is so monotonous and often proves an arduous task, due to the incredibly slow combat system. In fact, ! think I fell asleep while playing and still didn't die. Underneath the drab interior Kings Field is probably quite an involving game, but I really don't want to play it to find out because it is so boring. STEVE 1:9 REVIEW BATING OOUU RATING BREV SOMEATER 1 The water has the same effect as at least three herbs, as it fills up your life completely, If FFVII is the gem, this is the scraggy pebble that your dog plays with.

We rushed a copy over to find out if everything in this classic fighter remains intact. he Street Fighter series may win the kudos for being the first major beat'em up around but for the true fighting game gurus King of Fighters, not Street Fighter, is the game that eats up most of their pound coins when the new edition comes out. And not suprisingly, KOF 96 continues the tradition. Saturn owners are already looking forward to getting their hands on KOF 95 before summer, so there's hope the next inline is headed that way too. But what makes SNK's flagship game the finest in the business? URLER SELECT BENT BY US KAUZY ZULU RASUN GETTING TECHNICAL ALREADY RUSH HIT Players who are already familiar with the KOF series are used to seeing elements \"borrowed' by other companies for their combat titles. See how much of this stuff you recognise from the latest popular titles. HI ULAS JUMPING Completely unique to the KOF series is the multiple jump, allowing players to control the distance a fighter jumps. There are four types of jump short, normal, medium, and long range giving players more options. Unlike Street Fighter. * TEAM MODE For people who don't know yet, choose three fighters then face off against another team of three in a one-onone fight. The winner stays on in a process of elimination KOF95 was voted Game Of The Year by Famicom Tsushin. Is KOF96 up to the standard? LILLE LESS GUT DUUAGE CHUCK OUT YOUR CHINTZI POW BAR POW bar can be powered up manually, by blocking or by getting smacked in the kisser. Having the POW bar at MAXIMUM gives you advantages over a normal character the ability to hit harder; use super death blows (like the Super Combos in SFA), and more importantly Guard Cancel! In KOF95, Kyo and lori proved to be the strongest fighters in the game. So strong in fact that once you were knocked up into the air by either Kyo's double jump kick or lori's 3 Deadly Flowers, you were more or less dead! You'd have to be a good player to juggle them all the way across the screen, but it was possible. Both fighters have been toned down considerably, with Kyo losing some of his moves. Other things to go include moves of certain characters (Ryo's aerial fireball), the beloved Takuma, Billy Caine, Eiji Kisaragi and Heidern as well as a change in the boss roster. ROLLING Dodging is out, rolling is in. Though dodging could be used to go into any combo in KOF 95, rolling allows you to go forwards/backwards while avoiding hits, making the roll more versatile than 95's dodge. GRUL BUAGE * DASHING Dashing can be seen in all of the 3D beat'em ups but rarely in the 2D genre. KOF96 makes amends to this and adds much more ways to attack! BEHT BY BENTRA ENCODE REVIEW RUSH RUSH 2 * HITSK. LLLLL ATHEN CUT BUURGE SUPER DEATH BLOWS Think Capcom created Super Combos? SNK has been using their version ever since Fatal Fury 2 way back in 1992! Super Death Blows can be used once when your POW gauge is MAXed, or infinitely when your energy bar is flashing red. Unlike KOF95, the effect is less but there are two different versions one for use with a POW MAXed with a healthy energy bar; another for a flashing red bar with a POW MAXed gauge. "


"WARNING! computer video games DIS POSE The Dis pose is basiclly a taunt move which has the added effect of reducing your opponent's POW guage by a third. This makes POW. MAXing harder than in KOF 95, but it's still good idea to keep an eye on both your enemy's and your own POW guage so that you know when guard cancelling is a possiblity. If you own Real Bout Fatal Fury or Samurai Spirits, it's a good choice to buy the CD only version of KOF96 as you can use the RAM cartridge from these games instead of shelling out extra for something you already own. But be warned, you can't use the CD on it's own. Or if you're new to the whole SNK thing, buy either KOF96 with the cart or the KOF96+95 double pack. SATUR GUARD CANCEL Guard Cancel is similar in concept to Alpha counters in SFA but gives the player more choice of follow ups than its Capcom counter part. Block an opponent's attack while your POW guage is MAXed and immediately perform a move of your choice. Unlike in KOF95, you can only use rolls for GC instead of special moves. REVIEWER TAXIMUM COURTER!! COUNTERNG When an opponent is trying to hit you, aim to strike before they do. This is known as countering. Countering allows you to juggle, which can be very useful if you two-in-one a super death blow with a counter hard attack KOF 95 is one of my most revered games in my collection alongside the likes of Street Fighter Zero2, Tekken 2 and Vampire Hunter. So late nights and the blistered thumbs have become a daily occurance again with the arrival of the Saturn version of KOF 96. On initial play the game may seem shallow and a SF rip off. But PERSIST, and you'll discover one of the finest fighting games in existence. From it's sheer wealth of techniques and tactics to all 29 original characters, the KOF 96 boasts quality. And the Team Edit option adds to the lastability of the game no end as you have fun developing your very own dream team. Once you've created a team of pure class, taking on all challengers adds another few months to the game's life. If you hate the shake out feel of the XMen games, KOF 96 is the game for you. This series is renowned for its precise control system, so no more blaming the game for your incompetence. It's not all DU GUARD CRUSH In KOF96, continously blocked attacks can lead to a Guard Crush which means the player on the recieving end temporarily can't block. Defensive players be warned! SAS GUTER REVIEW RATING BATING A Must Have title for beat'em up fanatics, and players who like a game with depth yes, even if you do own KOF 95! 69 "

Cear 6 0104233 eing the pioneers into an untapped market or the first to experiment with new chips must be a tough decision to make. The prime example has to be Atari and the Jaguar which sank quicker than the Titanic. On a smaller scale, Ubi Soft are taking the aforementioned 'first leap' into MMX technologies and adapting to fit the expanding 3DFX sector with their new racer, Pod. Although the graphical slant is one of the major selling points for this game, the fact that it's playable over the Internet is the game's biggest pro, with the American Pod website already well into construction, with the full British service going on-line at the beginning of May. The programmers are hoping it's then that the Pod experience will take off... pod pod THE BASIC MINIMUM JUST A NUDGE TO THE RIGHT What do you ideally need to play Pod then? As a rule. a Pentium 120 MHz is the basic, but Ubi Soft claim to have run it quite adequately on a 100 MHz, and even reports of 90's coping as well. You'll also need at least 16Mb of RAM to install it. And what about the chips? Well, as you know Pod supports both MMX and 3DFX, so if you have either of those, the game's quality increases dramatically too. In the one player mode lay-bys are merely pit stops. But once you begin a two player game, they take on a whole new dimension. If you approach the entrance to the refill points with another racer at your side, simply giving an opponent a sly nudge will give them no option but to take the enforced detour along a longer route, thus giving you a few seconds of advantage.

It's a dead end! 5/8 If you put all the Internet shenanigans to the side for a moment, Pod is still a quality title on it's own. Despite borrowing some elements of Wipeout, it still has enough individual touches to maintain a long-term interest. The graphics, as you would expect, are awesome. Even without the beefed-up chips, everything runs very smoothly and the scenery and track detail is of the highest order. Having said that, finding your way around some of the courses is difficult due to there being no real indications of where you are supposed to be going. The ambient style soundtrack is also pretty funky. The reason this didn't get a High Five however is because as it stands at the moment, Pod only has the potential to be a huge game. If the flow of new tracks and cars is constant, then it really will be worth a High Five. If that happens we'll revise the score. STEVE PES PUNTERS GO POD CRAZY! Pod has just entered the record books as one of the top 10 downloaded games ever to be released on the Internet. More than 100.000 gamers obtained the game, in the first seven days of release, proving that online games are indeed, very big business.

Pod makes good use of the new upgrade chips, yet proves you can have the flash graphics and keep old fashioned playability!  "

In Saturn Bomberman things are slightly different, there's still a story mode, but now two players can team-up to win the day. This time the villainous Mr Meanie and his Meanie Gang, are the ones to be stopped. They've discovered a rare power source deep in the jungles of South America. In the process a large creature is awakened. Mr Meanie is quick to slap on a control device, so he may use the creature for his own evil purposes.

Bomberman really is one of the simplest games around, easy to learn, but longer to master. The basic aim is to defeat all the enemies (or opponents in Battle mode), and open the exit for the next level. At the start of each game you are armed only with a bomb. Each level is a simple grid structure, with blocks that can be detonated, and those that can't. Simply remove the destructible blocks (often revealing power-ups), destroy the enemies and go to the next level.

Play is on such a huge scale, that the size of the players is scaled down, to accommodate the larger number of participants, and bigger play field hence the large TV. To make up the numbers, are a cast of Hudson Soft's best loved characters, including BC Kid aka Bonk, and Mr Higgins from Adventure Island, who is renamed Master Wiggins. High Ten is pretty legendary in the industry, for until now only a maximum of four players have been able to enjoy Bomberman battles at U home. Yet Hudson designed a version of the game that resided in their offices, and appeared at various conventions and shows, where ten people could play at once.

The music is great with some cool drum & bass and funky wah wah guitars, with neat cut sequences between levels.

Providing other comforts are essential. To begin, make sure they don't have to stand around waiting to be seen, give them seats. Otherwise their health becomes worse and they start spewing everywhere. Ensure that patients are kept warm by placing radiators in all the rooms. If they get thirsty, give them access to a drinks machine. Lastly, make sure you have enough toilets!

"MAKE SOME ROOM computer video games When the Inspector is around make sure everything is very tidy. The hospital's rooms are divided into four different categories: Diagnosis, Treatment, Clinics and Facilities. All are pretty self-explanatory. To build a room first you have to agree on the blueprints. By selecting which room you want to build, you will have to make sure the room is at least the recommended size (different rooms require varying floor space), and that you can fit it within your present free spaces. Then you add doors, windows and finally place objects in the room. All rooms have a set number of objects that must be placed in the room to make it function, if you have enough space you can add additional items. When building a GP's Office you are required to include a desk, filing cabinet and chair for the patient. Extra items you can add are radiators, a bin and some plants. ROM theme HOSPITAL Overhead projectors are cool, you can make shadows with your hands. LET ME OFF THE PAGE, I'M A DOCTOR... TRUST MEI REVIEWER Your progress is charted by moving your Doctor around the board. As you start at a new Hospital advance a space. IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH To keep things humorous, the majority of patients suffer from bizarre illnesses. With the corridors of your hospital often looking like some weird freak show. The first comedy ailment you will encounter is Bloaty Head syndrome. Patients suffer from incredibly large heads, which you can cure by building the Inflator. The Inflator simply pops the patients head like a balloon, and then pumps the head back up to normal size. Other patients may suffer from Invisibility, TV Personalities, Slack Tongue, the King (Elvis impersonators) and people who are completely covered from head-to-toe in hair. If you have the facilities to cure these patients, look closely when they are receiving their treatment as its highly amusing. After what seems a development period of aeons, Theme Hospital finally arrives, and I'm glad to say, doesn't disappoint. I never thought that running a hospital could make such a great game. Of course, this is no ordinary hospital (oops slipped into cliche mode a bit there). While very humorous to begin with, some of the jokes do begin to wear thin. Yet this doesn't matter, because the game itself is so engrossing. The icing on the cake, has to be the attention to detail throughout the game, eg put a pool table in the staff room and it does get played, or the spot-on sound effects that emanate from the toilets. It's because of the graphics that these elements are realised, large and colourful, with lots of animation. The business/ strategy element may be too simple for some, but for anyone that's played Theme Park and enjoyed it, this comes highly recommended. ALEX HUHTALA REVIEW RATING NOOSE Don't worry he may be green now, but in a second he'll look just like a frog again. A great game that will appeal to all ages. Funny and involving. If you're a fan of Theme Park or are looking for something different, get this. 75 "

IGVIS SHIA CST CVO MEN VG BECU hen Exhumed was first revealed on Saturn, no-one thought it was anything special. «Just another Doom clone\" we said. But as we played it more, we realised just how fantastic it really is. In fact, if we reviewed the Saturn version again today it would get a High Five for sure! Aliens attacked Earth many years ago and stole the body of the all-powerful Pharaoh Ramses as well as scattering the six powerful magic artifacts around the valley of Karnak. It's up to you to find out exactly what happened, track down those stinkin' aliens and let Ramses rest in peace! LOOK AT ME, I'M A BIRDIE! TUTANKHAMUN'S ARMY SURPLUS STORE The selection of weapons in Exhumed is excellent, though you start the game with just a machete. Before long you'll find some modern-day guns and some powerful Egyptian magic! Exhumed One of the coolest features of Saturn Exhumed is that you can \"bomb boost\" by bouncing yourself off the explosion from the Amun Bombs. By using the magical artifacts to float, you can drop a bomb straight below you and push yourself upwards slightly. Lobotomy made learning this tactic essential to completing the game properly as most of the team dolls are hidden in areas only accessible with the bomb boost. Interestingly enough, it's not possible to bomb boost in the PlayStation version of Exhumed instead, when you collect a certain number of team dolls you are rewarded with two new magical modes! Dolphin mode lets you swim at high speeds then leap out of the water while Eagle mode lets you fly wherever you want! These two skills make finding the last of the team dolls even more fun than before! MACHETE PISTOL M-60 Surprisingly damaging, but the first weapon you The weapon you'll end up you need to get right up collect is okay for the using the most. Very next to your enemies to initial stages of the game, quick to fire and powerful use it and it's very slow to but isn't much use later enough for most enemies, use. The good thing is that on. Slow-firing and not keep the M-60 well you can use it underwater. particularly powerful. stocked up with ammo. AMUN BOMB FLAMETHROWER COBRA STAFF The extra abilities Finding the team make the game easier. dolls is more fun! During the game itself, the Amun Bombs are only really used to clear big rooms, but once completed they are essential for finding all the secrets. RING OF RA Looks great, and is very This fires magical flying useful indeed. Not only snakes which explode on does it do lots of damage, impact. They home-in on but it can also set enemies enemies but don't do too on fire and do damage as much damage. You can use they try to get away! this underwater as well. MANACLE MAGICAL ARTIFACTS MEINES Using the Cobra Staff underwater makes killing the piranhas much easier than normal. The ring lets you fire The ultimate weapon! The small bouncing fireballs longer you charge it up, from the palms of your the more lightning bolts hands which are excellent are fired from your hand! when you're surrounded. They home-in on enemies Very useful. and do loads of damage! Your main quest throughout Exhumed is to find and collect the six magical artifacts from the Karnak Valley. Each one gives you a new power. 76 "


"computer video games I TOLD YOU, IT'S IN THE SANDI OBSERVE THE FANTASTIC SCENERY The 22 levels in Exhumed are spread around the Karnak Valley with no single set route through the game. Most of the levels have more than one exit, though some of them can only be reached with the use of artifacts collected from later in the game. As the game goes on and you collect more magical artifacts the plot develops, with the spirit of the Pharaoh Ramses giving you advice with every new power. Eventually you get to do battle with the aliens who stole Ramses' body in the introduction story! While most of Exhumed on the PlayStation looks the same as the Saturn version, some sections have been changed completely. Many of the secret sections have been redesigned and moved, and there are some more impressive structures than before. Take a look at some of the screenshots and you should be able to see what we mean. PlayStation T COLONY The lighting effects make the levels look even more realistic. THERE'S MORE While you may think that you've finished Exhumed once you've got all the artifacts, worked through every level and beaten the final boss, there's still a lot more to do before you can call yourself an Exhumed Master! For example, to complete the game properly you need to collect all of the pieces of the radio transmitter which have been scattered all around the Karnak Valley in order to call assistance to get out of there! If you don't, the ending shows... well, you'll have to find that out for yourself! Exhumed Massive lava-filled chasms often have these disgusting beasts swimming in them! REVIEWER LOROTON TO THE IN COLLECT THE ENTREN PROGRAMMING TEAM You've finished the game, you've got all of the artifacts, you rebuilt the radio transmitter what more is there to do? Look harder, that's what! Hidden throughout the game are 23 \"Team Dolls\" small mummies with the faces of the programmers stuck on them! These dolls are hidden in some of the most difficult-to-find places we've ever seen in a game, meaning that it takes LOADS of exploration to get them all. Quite a few of the dolls are in different places to those in the Saturn version of Exhumed, as there's now one doll on every level. And if you manage to get all of the dolls you get a free bonus game, though it's definitely not Death Tank from the American Saturn version... I didn't get into Exhumed on the Saturn until it had been out for quite a long time, as it didn't appeal to me at all to begin with. But as soon as you start to play, it becomes clear that it's far more than just a Doom rip-off set in Egypt. From the screenshots the PlayStation version may seem to be far superior, but it's actually a lot jerkier and a bit slower than it is on the Saturn though it's certainly not enough to ruin the game. In fact, it's still a lot faster than any of the other games of its style on the PlayStation. Exhumed must be the longest-lasting single-player corridor game ever, not only because it's so tough but also because it gives players loads to find even after they've finished it. The graphics are excellent, the sound is amazing, the control is fantastic and the level design is so good that there aren't any words to do it justice. Exhumed is essential to all Saturn and PlayStation owners after a challenge and is one of the best action adventures yet. Fantabulous! ED HOMAS HOT INFO: EXHUMED 21 There are some hot rumours going around at the moment about Enumed 2 which is said to be in development already! The major difference is that it won't be a first person perspective shooter like the first game, and instead will use a Tomb Raider style view. Also, it's scheduled to be set before Evhumed and you get to play as the Pharaoh Ramses himself, fighting off the alien invasion! It's rumoured to be coming out on Saturn. PlayStation and Nintendo 64. though none of this has vet been confirmed. Still, it sounds as though it could be fantastic! REVIEW HIGHNEJVE. INNI RATING RATING OO A perfectly-crafted adventure, and by far the best 3D shoot 'em up on the PlayStation.  "

MASS DESTRUCTION Finding the bonus objectives is the key to finding hidden missions. By simply completing the primary objectives, the easiest and quickest path to the end is the road you end up taking. Although this cuts out at least a third of the other missions, it leaves you wondering if you've missed anything special. So, once you think you've finished a level, check the map and it'll inform you of any secondary targets. Try to get as many of the bonuses as well. This should bring up the additional extraction point and taking this will lead you onto the more complex hidden missions. At the beginning of each round you're given your primary targets for that particular level, which are the basic minimum number of targets that you have to destroy in order to complete the levels. Hunt around a little, and you soon discover there is a lot more to discover. Secondary targets appear on your in-game map screen (press X) and there are also unmarked bonus objectives that you can carry out. The vast majority of these are simply taking out smaller groups of buildings tucked away in the corner of a stage, or mauling a few radar sites. Once a level is complete, the score screen will appear telling you what percentage of bonuses you managed to complete. If it's not one hundred percent, then it's back in again to look for them.

"computer video games LOOK HOW PUNY MY WEAPON IS! * With the emphasis in Mass Destruction on simply destroying things, you'd imagine there's a fair old arsenal of weapons at your disposal. And you'd be right. Just remember though, as soon as you finish a stage, all the weapons you were carrying will be lost and you have to start the next stage from scratch. Doh! SATURN 0381 OD 0180515 mm O150 SHENTS 003 IR 2018 * GET OUTTA MY WAY! The first of the two default weapons, it also has an infinite amount of bullets. They are quick firing, but sadly lacking in any real power. Finding the pick-ups for these is rare, but then again you never really need to use them. For sheer desperation and as a very last resort only. Racking up points is essential to this game, and the way you kill enemies is a testament to this. Some of the buildings and structures require two bursts of firing to destroy, and you don't get any points until it's completely destroyed. And then there are the foot soldiers. Shooting them with any weapon is not only fiddly, but also gives you a measly ten points. Our advice to you is to try and run them over instead. Not only does it provide you with maximum satisfaction, but it also gives you 25 points instead of ten. CHAIN GUN VORTEX BOIAB e Dress 39 DUBBE This is the other weapon you never lose and as with the shells, it has infinite bullets. Its short range is ideal for a bit of close combat. It says 'Cluster Bomb ammo' when you pick up shells for this weapon, but it's the same thing. This is your equivalent of a weak smart bomb. 25 Two men are trying to attack. Shooting one gives a paltry ten points, whereas running over one gives 25!! MASS DESTRUCTION HIGH EX MISSILE GUIDED MISSILE 30 0044 PUBEELD 0004 The most common pick up, and it's probably the most reliable weapon. You'll record high amounts of damage once these beauties connect. Although you can only hold five of these at once, they don't 'alf pack some punch guv'! Homing missiles that cause mass destruction! Cool. REVIEWER MORLAR OS QUE2840 FLVE THROWER 0 015 DIT IS The longer you hold down shoot when firing these, the greater the arc they travel. Tap the button however and they fire almost straight ahead. The best weapon bar none. Awesome looking, awesome amounts of damage and you get 200 units with every pick up you collect. Use it. Or die. If you fancy a game you can pick up and play for 20 minutes before you pop over to your mates, this is it. Those who want something that lasts a little longer may feel more than a little disappointed by the repetitiveness of Mass Destruction. Don't get me wrong, this was a whisker away from scoring a four, but at the end of the day, I found myself doing the same things over again and subsequently my interest waned. Graphically though, it's very impressive. The high resolution buildings don't suffer from any pop up and there isn't a hint of slow down. And the game is pretty fast paced with no let up in the action. There is always something to shoot but it's just a shame that it's always the same things I ended up killing. STEVE teg * CAREFUL WITH THAT MATE REVIEW The first couple of stages don't have any specific tasks as it were, just things along the line of 'blow this and that up'. Once you delve a little deeper however, a few targets that must not be shot, appear during the stages. For instance a Nuclear Power Plant needs destroying, but the main reactors must remain upright. The key to spotting these is to check your mission briefing at the start of each of the stages, or look out for the red dots on your radar. Then try your best to avoid hitting them. | RATING RATING HETER It's a very well put together game and does provide a lot of short term appeal, but the lack of variety prevents this from being outstanding. 2000  "

But this is Street Fighter with a difference Firstly it's SF and Vampire Hunter, featuring five characters from each, plus some secret ones too. Secondly, you do battle with little bricks. At first glance this looks like another Columns/Tetris rip off what with the falling blocks, getting rid of them in chain reactions and all that. But once you delve a little deeper, you discover that this really is a superb game. The sheer addictiveness is the main part. You constantly find yourself coming back for one last go, and before you know it you've been playing for hours. And it's fiendishly tough too, something which can't always be said for puzzle games.

Make your way through the 200 locations that make up the city of Salto, inhabited by over 80 different characters and strange creatures. Excalibur has a nice variety of fighting, spellcasting, puzzle solving and interaction with other characters, yet the whole thing is a little boring. The city is all on one level, and resembles a maze rather than a real place. The graphics and locations are all a bit similar, and the fighting moves at your command are limited. If you like games with orcs, goblins and the like, you could enjoy this. Its RPG element does get better the further you progress.

Here the Looney Tunes characters are teamed up with Michael Jordan against the alien team of Monstars, in a game of three-onthree basketball. Added to the court antics are several poor sub-games, which pop up between the periods. Find Michael's kit before the B-ball starts, make Yosemite Sam shoot hoops in a score challenge against one of the Monstars, and enter a space race with the aid of Speedy Gonzales. Do well here and your team's abilities are improved. All the characters have individual monster dunks and character animation. Younger gamers might like this, but as for the rest steer well clear.

GUN GAME TM PlayStation SATURN CRYPT KILLER APR RELEASE * MINI REVIEWS BY KONAMI 1-2 PLAYERS rypt Killer has been around in the arcades for a while now, and while it wasn't that good a game, it attracted punters because you use pump-action shotguns instead of normal weapons. And the same can be said for the home versions too, minus the shotguns of course. Most shooting games are generally good fun to play, as this is, but when a game looks as bad as this, then who cares? Plus Crypt Killer has nowhere near the same amount of depth and playability as say Virtua Cop. Once you've played it through, there is no real need to come back again, and even the two player mode doesn't save it. With the already far superior Virtua Cop 1 and 2 already available for Saturn, and Time Crisis well into development, I'd recommend that you get one of those instead.

The deciding factor for most will be the graphics to think that this game is running on the PlayStation is hard to believe, looking not much better than the original EA Hockey on the Mega Drive!

ROBOT GAME bu MECHWARRIOR 2 SENGER TM PlayStation OUT NOW BY ACTIVISION 1-2 PLAYERS onsidering the PC version of MechWarrior was such a huge success, it came as no surprise that it is was being converted to the PlayStation. What did come as a shock though, was that the programmers have completely overhauled the engine from the PC and assembled a new one! Although having now seen the end result, it doesn't seem to make it any better. The biggest fault of this is that it is far too slow. It's painful just trying to change direction, which in a game that relies on you being quick enough to avoid enemy mechs is baffling. And graphically it leaves a little to be desired. There's no real detail in any of the stages, they just look like flat expanses. Don't be fooled by other reviews this will become tedious very quickly, and you'll have wasted your money.

Unfortunately, it was released before any reviews were on the shelves and lots of people bought it on the strength of previous games. The Saturn version is actually a very good conversion of the PlayStation game, and looks almost identical... the problem is that it plays the same as well. Badly-worked out motion-capture means that players stop between moves and hobble around slowly, the artificial intelligence is terrible, loads of players are in the wrong team positions, the control is very slow, and a load more stupid errors like these just ruin the game completely.

As with the first Descent, the black borders at the top and bottom take up over a third of the screen but the graphics have almost the same level of detail as the PC version. The frame rate occasionally gets very jerky but overall it's not too bad. The controls take a bit of getting used to and customising until you find something you're comfortable with, though that's not surprising considering that the PC version used almost the entire keyboard. Descent 2 itself is pretty good full 3D movement (complete with free motion sickness), the key hunting game style of Doom, lots to shoot, and some fancy touches like the PlayStation-only coloured lighting.

In addition, most of the games on show were Japanese domestic versions, So American and European versions could also contain differences. CAPCOM AOU SHOW 1997: CAPCOM Although Capcom's stand was functionally well designed, it was still far too small to cope with the hundreds of gamers that swarmed over the two of the biggest hits of the show SFIII and Vampire Saviour. The general reaction to the new characters in Vampire Saviour was good, with Q-Bee being especially popular due to her insect-like attacks. However, reaction to BBHood was mixed with some feeling that she didn't really suit the game's image. The big question is why was Street Fighter III (CP-SYSTEM III not as popular as Vampire Saviour (CP-SYSTEM II)? The overall consensus seems to be that while most game players are familiar with the Vampire characters who are naturally colourful and exciting, it looks like it's going to take some time to get used to the new SFIII characters who in comparison do look very plain. LMT TIME or those wanting to know what big arcade hits lie ahead, there was no better crystal ball than the AOU '97 Amusement Expo.

Except that the game proved extremely popular, rating as the third top game of the show! Ken and Ryu, eight new fighters, the new Super Arts, and the power of the most advanced 2D arcade board, CP-SYSTEM III make Street Fighter III a force to be reckoned with. From the feedback we've been getting from those who've been playing it a while, the initially restrained response is slowly turning into one of buzzing excitement. Looks like SFill could have all the longterm elements that make a true classic! FANCY YOURSELF ONE OF THEM THERE NIFTY STREET FIGHTER III CLOCKS EN? DON'T BLAME YA! WELL, JUST TELL THEM CUG BOYS ME NAME. IT RHYMES WITH PRAWN! Q-BEE The Ghastly Insect! \"Your soul looks delicious!\" Just like Jedah, she works to gather souls. She is the head of the \"Soul Bee\" Hive. These insects exist wherever the honey of life can be found. They swarm, fight and devour together by instinct. JEDAH Messiah of the Darkness! \"All life must merge with me!\" One of the ancient lords of the Darkrealm he has been resurrected to save the dying world of Darkrealm. He has summoned all the Darkstalkers to his Damned Dimension, but what is their fate? WIN A STREET FIGHTER III CLOCK! Yes, Capcom have given us an official Street Fighter III clock for a competition prize. This nifty-looking time piece is actually fashioned out of a CD, with full-colour art on the front (as well as some clock arms). To stand a chance, just tell us the name of this character on the right. Send to our NEW address (see editorial) First entry randomly pulled from sack/box/drum/Ed's gut, wins. PLOT? The Darkrealm was in chaos. In those dark times, one soul was resurrected from the bottom of oblivion. Jedah, one of the ancient \"Three lords of the Darkrealm\" created a closed battle stage called the \"Damned Dimension\" and summoned all worthy spirits, declaring 'All living and dead souls should merge with me! That is your only hope for ultimate salvation!\" Thus, the gala of The Darkstalkers is held once again, only now it's for their own survival. Time is running out....and there's no second chance! Allo ARCADE Some way from its summer release in Japan, little is known about what differences there are to the game mechanics in this instalment. The most noticeable alteration is that there's no more \"Round\" system to slow down your fighting pace. Instead, Capcom have introduced the \"Damage Gauge System\", said to give more opportunities for counter attacks and make battles more exciting than ever! Expect Vampire Saviour to be released over here under the somewhat less cool name of Darkstalkers: Jedah's Damnation. 83 "

In particular, The House of the Dead stood out as a very impressive title, showing you don't need Model 3 technology to make a great game, just a good idea with plenty of exciting gameplay. Certainly the best of the three gun games at the show! Virtua Striker 2 takes over from VF3 and Scud Race as Sega's showpiece of Model 3 power, and Top Skater exemplifies Sega's classic originality as well. AOU 1997 PRESS START BUTTON THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD AOU SHOW 1997: SEGA (C) SEGA ENTERPRISES 1996 AM R&D DEPT #1 Model 2 board 80% complete /Japanese version One of the most impressive games at the AOU Show was SEGA'S new shooting game The House of the Dead. In a mix of Resident Evil meets Virtua Cop, you play a government agent who's been sent into a gothic-style research centre to rescue endangered scientists. As you battle zombies and monsters you're gradually caught up in the spine-tingling atmosphere of horror! AM1's attention to detail is immaculate. For example, each time you're hit a bloody mark appears on the screen. However, rather than simply using the same effect, each monster leaves a different mark. Axes leave a bloody gash, fangs leave a bloody bite mark, claws leave a bloody slash, while the chainsaw leaves a giant bloody... well, need we say more? Like a real horror movie, HotD always keeps you on the edge of your seat. The zombies come at you from all directions. They hang from the ceiling, leap out of the water, jump out from behind doors and even smash their way out of huge experimental glass tanks! The zombies are rock hard opponents, taking several well-aimed shots before exploding apart with green blood and guts flying everywhere as you continue to blast them! As you'd expect from a genetics research centre, there's more than just a few mutated zombies roaming around! Monkey zombies and fish zombies are just Cabinet artwork to rival that of Night Of The two we've seen, but as Living Dead. Now you get to join in the horror! levels progress you're faced with even more abominations. One is a huge winged demon surrounded by an army of giant bats! This creature is particularly well-animated. In the game's most unique feature, players can choose their own route. However, unlike in Virtua Cop 2 these junctions aren't fixed. Instead, they alter depending on the player's progress. Expert players won't have the PRESS START BUTTON normal routes, rather they'll be able to choose their routes from an earlier stage. A lovely view of the moon. During the time it takes beginner players Hey, get out the way, you zombie! to play several games, experts can discover many other things! Being a top government special agent requires not only precision shooting, but brains as well. Trigger happy players will not only wipe out all the horrors, but surviving scientists as well. Your 'Life Bonus' at the end of each level relies on the number of scientists rescued, so you need to be careful what you shoot! In addition, you need to look out for things to assist your mission. Shooting a control panel on the far side of a room raises a bridge so you can cross.

The handling of the cars has been improved. The control of the player's car during drift has benefited from advice they've received from the famous Japanese racing driver, Mr. Suzuki. The car line up has been altered to reflect their difficulty. The left side is for beginners (Porsche Easy, Ferrari Normal) while the righ is aimed at experts (Dodge High Torque, McLaren High Speed). The tactics of the rival cars has also been altered. Far from avoiding accidents, they are now trying to cause crashes!! As an incentive, the number of the car that crashed into you is now displayed! Other changes seem distinctly Daytona esque, The original featured 40 cars on all three tracks. This has now been adjusted to reflect the enemy car skills.

By pulling and pushing the handle bar back and forth, you're able to control the angle of the hang-glider's wing. Pull the bar toward you, your hang glider will start to descend. Speeds of up to 140km/h are not impossible! To slow down quickly, just keep pressing the bar to raise the wing. This acts as an air brake. This artwork shows the position you'd be in, fixed to a real hang glider. No simple pedal here, fool. AOU 1997 (C) KONAMI 1997 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Konami board In-development / Japanese version With the exception of Namco's Prop-Cycle there haven't really been any great arcade flying simulators around. That's all set to change with Konami's excellent Hang Pilot! Konami have gone to great lengths to give this dynamic sport the realism it needs. All the heart-stopping thrills of soaring like an eagle, but without the worry of pain and injury! The aim of Hang Pilot is to race your hang glider against the clock across an open course. Although you're free to choose your route, there are several checkpoints to pass through, so you need to avoid straying too far from the general direction of the finishing point. In addition, there are three other pilots racing against you. In the beginning they're quite useful because you can follow them to learn the basic route and pick up a few handy techniques at the same time. However, they soon become far more competitive! Depending on your skills you can choose from 3 different types of pilot. The Beginner Pilot's hang-glider is easy to control but has a lower top speed, while the Expert Pilot's hang glider is designed for high speed so it requires careful handling. The Normal Pilot's hang glider is a balance between the two, of course. There are four view points to choose from, including both a \"Behind View\" where you can see the entire hangglider (good for beginners because it's easy to understand) and a \"Pilot's Eye View\" where you can see only the handle bar and the front-tip of the hang-glider (this dynamic viewpoint gives a real feeling of speed). KONAME 50 The large foot plate at the bottom is used to turn your glider left and right. By placing both feet firmly on the Rudder Step and shifting your weight from side to side you can control the direction of the hang-glider the same way professionals do. Mastering the balance is essential for precision handling!! By leaning your body to the left and moving your feet to the right you can make a left turn, and vice versa. If you keep leaning to one side you can turn right around. Some of the 3D backdrops look simply incredible. Check ou that valley at the top-right! There are three different scenic courses available. The intermediate course is still under development, however here are the two courses we know about at the moment: AOU SHOW 1997: KONAMI/ PSIKYO RESORT ISLAND An easy course designed for beginners, with a beautiful coastal view and clear blue skies, just the thing for a gentle start to your flying experience. With a fairly level slope and limited obstacles, Resort Island is the perfect course to practice your handling, and master the techniques you'll need for the more difficult levels, WILD VALLEY Experts will enjoy the challenge of this alpine course. With numerous trees and cliffs along this difficult valley course you need to have mastered precision control of your hang glider if you want to avoid crashing.

Obviously with most of their programmers busy on future 64-bit titles SNK had to rely on third party games by Atari and Data East to fill out their stand, although Real Bout Special was also available.

It's almost impossible to commute, either to school or work, without using the train. The driver's cabin is part of the first train carriage with huge big windows so not only can you see the view ahead of the train you can also spend many fascinating hours watching the driver do his stuff with all the knobs, levers and buttons. So it's not really that surprising that they all want to become train drivers and mess around : with all those knobs, levers and buttons themselves! As such, Taito have done a first rate job of building an exact replica of the actual system used in most trains in Japan.

If you've never experienced the original, Arkanoid is a powered-up version of Breakout, as you clear the screen of blocks by bouncing a ball at them. The main difference this time round is that two players can play simultaneously! There's 100 stages in the game and the familiar selection of power-ups, that extend your Vaus (bat), stick the ball to it, give it firepower etc. Of course the best thing is that this arcade release probably means we'll get all-new console versions too.

Most amusing game at the show goes to Armadillo Racing. As one of the very few multi-player games available it offered a refreshing change from the serious fighting and shooting. Not really a mainstream arcade game, so not featured here, is Pocket Racer. This is basically Ridge Racer Revolution with all the cars in buggy mode and is intended for the kids. V100 ARMADILLO RACING 8 (C) 1997 NAMCO LTD ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. System Super 22 board 80% complete / Japanese version It's bizarre, but real! Armadillo Racing is a game in which up to four players race armadillos around a selection of courses set in the steamy jungles of South America. There are four player armadillos (red, green, blue and yellow), and a computer-controlled one too (purple). Niftily, each has its own uniquely patterned armour too! These critters face two types of race the Obstacle Course with falling objects, jumping platforms and a suspension bridge. And a Sprint Course, a two-lap speed frenzy! For the control method, it's return of the Track Ball! Anyone who's played the old Sonic coin-op will be familiar with this. Striking the ball with the palm hand in a DIE forward slapping motion moves the armadillo in the same direction as the ball. The faster the ball turns the faster your armadillo runs! There are loads of humorous touches. Throughout the entire race the poor little creatures huff and puff away. As they race along, little beads of sweat fly off them. In addition, as they run on the dirt sections of the track their little back legs kick up dust as well. There are other animals wandering around the courses too. You need to keep an eye out for a large crocodile that comes out the water and rests on the track! If you fall off a platform into the water, you have to swim all the way to the opposite side and scramble over the bank. Fall off the suspension bridge that spans the giant chasm and you need the friendly vultures to swoop down, grab you and put you back on the track. For players who finish playing a solo game with an excellent result you win entry to a bowling contest held in the jungle. We didn't get to see this contest at the show (too many people there for anyone to have a solo game), but from the pictures we've seen it appears that your armadillo actually roles up into the shape of a bowling ball!

Her dream is to build the perfect amusement park in China when she grows up, but she doesn't know what to do about the money. According to \"Grandpa\" Wong Jin Lei, who is both her teacher as well as her distant relative, the Mishima financial empire in Japan seems to be very rich. Xiaoyu wanted to meet Heihachi Mishima, the president of this empire. One day, while sightsee ing in Hong Kong with her family, Xiaoyu saw the Mishima flag flying on a luxurious cruiser anchored in the harbour (Heihachi was in Hong Kong to ask Lei to the tournament.). She crept on board. During the voyage to Japan, Xiaoyu was discovered and she scuffled with Mishima's men. On hearing the disturbance Heihachi rushed to the scene and saw his men lying there. Xiaoyu ran up to Heihachi and begged him to build her ideal amusement park in China. She even threatened him to act violently again if he turned down her request. Heihachi was so amused by this childish blackmailer that he laughed, promising her he'd build whatever amuse ment park she wanted if she won at the tournament. Xiaoyu agreed. Heihachi, believing she wouldn't participate, feels a little embarrassed.

An added bonus is the vibrating Jolt' pack, which fits inside the controller each time the Arwing takes a hit, the player does too! Star Fox McCloud renews his struggle against his nemesis Andross (aka Andolf), accompanied by Slippy Frog, Falco Bird, and Peppy Rabbit. Cute characters in situations that require amazing skill to survive. This time players must learn to control a tank, as well as the Arwing. As with the original Super NES game there are different routes to take through the galaxy, affecting difficulty and type of world. To top it all off there's also a competitive multi-player mode, accommodating up to four players. Another new technique is the 'Wing Over'. This is where the Arwing banks sharply to the right or left, flipping over in the process. The Barrel Roll is still pc possible too!

"19 computer Video games Cone 3 NINTENDO 64 A Link To The Past: Zelda IV was one of the very early Super NES games, and remains a classic to this day. The stunning sequel is nearer than ever! 0 ZELDA 64 umours abound, but we're living in hope that Zelda 64 will be one of the very first 64DD games (Nintendo's mass-storage N64 add-on). If Nintendo can reinvent the world of Princess Zelda and the hero Link the same way as they did the Mario universe we're headed for gaming nirvana later this year! Actually we're still concerned with the mythical world of Hyrule, governed as ever by the divine power of the Triforce. The pictures you see here are taken from a game still very much in the development stage. Zelda 64 looks incredible already, but remember how much was improved in Mario 64. So for another indeterminable period, we're waiting on Nintendo to update us with more information and advanced screen shots. Meanwhile let's examine what we have so far. The skeletal 'Stalfos' character, and the shiny-armoured 'Ironack' pose as the opponents for this particular demo. Expect Ironack to require something more substan, tial than a sword to defeat them, and Stalfos to resurrect himself after collapsing in a heap of bones! NINTENDO 64 NEW GAMES: ZELDA 64 NINTENDO 64 NEW GAMES: ZELDA 64 Los 0233 Link has always trusted his fellow Hyrulians to gather information. Nintendo have done a great job of modelling Link in 3D. Check this cool front and back view incredible detail! 0123 Link appears to have a similar range of movement to Mario in Mario 64, thanks to the precise control of the analogue '3D' stick. NEW GAMES With Zelda 64, players will be able to walk around the colourful world of Hyrule as though they were really there! Creating these villages must have required a lot of imagination and hard work on Nintendo's behalf. The results are brilliant though. In the new 3D environment Link can swipe horizontally AND vertically! GAGGING FOR FIRST SHOTS OF GANON! Nintendo have created a breathtaking atmosphere already, using dramatic lighting and superb attention to detail. Solving the problem of how to open doors is common ground for Link. You think this month's selection is impressive? Just bear in mind that we have only seen minor enemies and fairly standard locations. How much more amazing will it be when we finally see enchanted forests, castles, and the evil Ganon?! More on Zelda 64 soon we hope! 93 "


"computer video games NINTENDO 64 Words cannot do the buzz of Mother 2 justice. But we'll try: It's an RPG that has the affect of downing three cans of Coke and four Fuse bars t comes to something when even the in less than a minute, over and over for around Nintendo are as crazy and off-the-wali 40 hours. Here comes the jumped-up sequel! MOTHER NINTENDO 64 NEW GAMES: MOTHER 3 t comes to something when even the reference notes handed out to CVG by Nintendo are as crazy and off-the-wall as the RPG they describe. But this has probably more to do with the lively character of developers, Hal Laboratory, than anything else. Hal's games are pure confectionery, best illustrated by one of their flagship characters Kirby. The difference between Kirby and characters in the Mother series is that Kirby is perhaps too sickly sweet. In Mother games there is a certain dark mystery to everything a kind of sardonic humour delivered with all the innocence of classic Charlie Brown/Lucy confrontations. Everyone who features in the game has a practised weirdness about them, but underneath there are noble hearts united for the defeat of evil. In Mother 2 evil visits the hero's hometown as Gygas one intergalactic total bad mother-funster! Incidentally the hero gets to hear the prophecy of his grand future from a telepathic housefly, moments before its tragic death. Awesome. Enlightened playme Enlightened play. ers anyone who ever played Mother 2 (aka Earthbound in the US) have lots to anticipate in a 64-bit 64DD follow up. 1 A professor, who Hal haven't a name for yet. Apparently he loves iced doughnuts, though feels cheated if he gets one with a hole. Expect the prof's ability to create weird and wonderful inventions to make him a key personality in Mother 3. This is the Tropical Jungle area, where you can see two creatures called Shipopo poking their heads out of the swamp. When game development is over, Hal intend 'Colourful Snake' to make the sound of maracas. INTRODUCING THE NEW HEROES Players eventually control a variety of characters in Mother 2, understanding their individual scenarios before settling back with the main character. Here are the new playable characters who have major roles. TAZMILY VILLAGE DUSTER THE MYSTERIOUS PEDDLER AND SARUSA RYUKA This waitress is employed at the \"Chichibu' club. She doesn't help you out much unless you give her a good tip. Only then is she likely to pass on some secret information...  NEW GAMES Soldiers in Mother 3 have alternative names for ranks, which Hal go into some detail explaining. This guy is a Buhii, which means Sergeant. Immediately below him there is the Buhei. Below that is the Buu. Told you this was weird. Though we don't know full details, we're told that Duster works the night shift. Instead of coffee for breakfast he takes a cocktail down at the Chichibu club, no doubt looking for clues while he's there. An old man named Wess is Duster's mentor. With his sidekick monkey Sarusa, the Mysterious Peddler travels about the place trying to sell people...something. Hal haven't told us what just yet! MOTHER! Born and raised in the Tazmily village to a well respected mother and father. Ryuka also has an elder brother, in case you were wondering. As Ryuka loves animals he often goes out into the forest to spot them, which leads him into all kinds of trouble. 1 Art Director for Mother 3 is Ashura Itoh, whose development sketches you can see here. By looking at the odd-looking man and the vehicles, you can see how much character is emphasised before the transition to video game. You should all be looking forward to Mother 3, as it promises to be a really fun adventure that is as 'far out' as games go! Also this is another title to make use of the 64DD for N64. Should compete directly with FFVIIalbeit on a different plane. 94 "


"computer video games Of course Nintendo have a huge library of cool characters to bring N64. And they're bringing their trademark styles along for the ride. Here's the latest on Yoshi and Kirby. NINTENDO 64 YOSHI ISLAND he brilliant Super NES game looks hand drawn. On N64 Nintendo have developed a 'hand-made' style for Yoshi Island. We're especially hoping that Shigeru Miyamoto and his team have concentrated on some classy gameplay routines, as well as a great new look. If this doesn't supersede Super Mario World, in terms of gameplay inno vation there'll be a lot of disappointed people here. In the recent Donkey Kong series for the Super NES, the scenery is pseudo 3D you can see the top and bottom of objects depending on where DK is positioned. We're not certain, but it's a possibility that Yoshi Island 64 uses a similar effect. NINTENDO 64 NEW GAMES: YOSHI ISLAND 64/KIRBY'S AIR RIDE/CHAMELEON TWIST Something we always craved on the Another cool feature of the Mario series was in Mario 3, 16-bit Nintendo was more, bigger, and in which the plumber could sneak behind the scenery. very detailed sprites, Looks as though Perhaps Nintendo considered this for Yoshi Island 64. N64 has no problem responding to this. Lakitu, the guy on the cloud, is a wellknown character in the Super Mario universe. In Super Mario World players could hijack his cloud. Wonder if Yoshi can? KIRBY ISLAND nother of Hal Laboratories '2nd Party' projects for Nintendo. Kirby Island, Kirby's AirRide... this title has been renamed and set back many times since first appearing at Shoshinkai in November 95. The latest news is that the game is to encapsulate a Theme Park feel, in which Kirby has the opportunity to make the most of 64-bit freedom. The analogue stick is once again highlighted as the means to an incredible end. Our experience so far has been numerous clips of Kirby Air Boarding' down brightly coloured slopes, and a four-player game where Kirby adopts the form of a ball to join three others trying to knock each other out of a bowl. The latter was evidently just a quick demo intended for Shoshinkai that year. Anyhow these are the 802 latest shots just two. Get a move on Kirby! A close up of Kirby, who now wears a baseball cap backwards. We guess he's performing some kind of stunt here. Some kind of breathtaking view of Kirby's home planet, Dream Land. Scooting down this slope at speed should be a rush. 95 "

Lobotomy have been working on it for only a few weeks, though they've already ported over most of the levels from the PC game! There's still loads of work to do though, as the backdrops and enemies aren't in place, sections of levels still aren't built, and the controls haven't been designed properly yet, but it should still all be finished in time for release in early Autumn. As you can see, the Nintendo 64's anti-aliasing effects round off all of the textures, plus the frame rate is already extremely smooth. Hopefully we'll have a more finished version of the game soon so that we can do a full feature in a forthcoming issue! uke Nukem 3D on the Saturn is coming on amazingly well. So far only a few levels are complete, but having played them ourselves we can confirm that it's going to be brilliant! The basic game engine is the same as Exhumed's, meaning that it runs incredibly quickly and smoothly, with loads of new coloured lighting effects not in the PC version! Now, when you fire a rocket it lights up the floor and walls around it with an orange glow, and enemies firing from dark areas cause flashes of light! The levels which are in place at the moment look identical to those on the PC and run as well as they would on a high-powered Pentium! Lobotomy are currently putting the rest of the levels in place and touching up on the game engine, so Duke is still on-course for a Summer release.

This month we've got some more pictures which we just felt we had to share with you! As you can tell, it uses a similar game engine to Quake's, giving the designers more scope for creating fantastic levels. Also, we can now see how the cut-scenes are going to look with real actors and rendered sequences featuring all-new characters! And, as the main character Kyle Katarn is now a Jedi, you get to use a lightsaber and a selection of fantastic Force powers! ome games just don't know when to die. There we were, thinking we'd seen the last of Clayfighter, only for it to return on the N64 and PlayStation. Are we excited? The old SNES and Mega Drive versions were noted for being fun to play but weak in the long term appeal. Whether Extreme suffers a similar fate we'll have to wait : and see. For the third coming, Interplay have included ten new plasticine fighters. Including: Sumo Santa, Kong Pow, Hobocop and the return of Boogerman! Another new feature is that there are breakthrough sections on each stage much like in MK or X-Men: COTE, where the fighters can break into previously unseen sections of the level. At the moment Clayfighter Extreme looks pretty gorgeous, and hopefully there will be something to play too. 96 "
