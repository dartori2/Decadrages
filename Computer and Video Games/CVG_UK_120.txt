"NEWS SEGA SCHOOLS COMPO FUN Lere's a bit of a new idea. Sega are launching a competition throughout schools in the UK to find hot marketing talent among Britain's gamesplaying kids. Winners will be given a place on the Sega Advisory Board, set up to \"help shape the fu. ture of one of the most exciting and fast-moving new industries in the UK.\" The competition, open to 14-16 year olds throughout Britain, is apparently recognised under the National Curriculum and aims to encourage understanding of marketing. More than 750 schools will take part in the compo, which ends on 31st December 1991. KID VID oming soon from GremUlin is Videokid, starring a young lad who gets sucked into his VCR and must battle with a horde of adverseries across five different worlds! Shoot 'em up fare is the order of the day, with a vast array of weapons available to VideoKid in this 50 framesper-second, parallax scrolling whopper. Gremlin boast they'll be able to have a maximum twenty-five sprites on screen at any one time, which no doubt means that the player will have one heck of a hard time trying to escape the perils of Videoworld when the game is released in December on Amiga and ST. at a price of .99. Watch this space for more info! IMAGINE THAT! If you own a Super Famicom, you'll already know the name Imagineer. This is the company which released Sim City an Populous for your machine.

But by pressing the buttons on your remote, you could also play drums with Hendrix. No experience required. Or remix any of your CDs to create your own versions. If your tastes are more classical, listen to Beethoven's music while you see a picture of the composer and read about his life's works. That's multimedia in its truest sense. \"Switch off the TV while you're doing your homework!\" That phrase could soon all but disappear. Because what better way to swot up on Shakespeare than by acting in a play and speaking the part of, say, Romeo with CDTV as your prompt. For sheer entertainment, there's nothing to touch CDTV. With Trivial Pursuits, you're not just answering questions on a card.

"REVIEW REVIEWS AMIGA .99 BY TEAM 17 BAYS magine the scene you're a warrior sent aboard a returning spacecraft to find out what happened to the occupants. Its distress signal has worried the Earth authorities so much that they refuse to allow it to return to the planet without a thorough search first Fearing some kind of sabotage, they send you the top geezer in the local space cadets, to investigate the moment you board the craft, you feel the insidious chill, the strange atmosphere, the dripping water You call your voice echoing through the dark tunnels of the craft. Clang! The airlock door slams shut behind you Alone in a dark, almost cathedral-like space cruiser. You whirl around to see what made that odd. papery scuttling sound You see nothing Cautiosly. you creep forward, laser cannon primed searchlight sweeping probing the darkest corners... DANGER HO SHORT PERSONNEL 1311 SECTORS ad Ooh! Spooky music and creaking sound effects introduce Alien Breed, which blatantly rips off both Alien the movie and the games Gauntlet and Alien Syndrome. Believe it or not, this game is better in many respects than both of 'em! Alien Breed scrolls in eight directions around a massive complex of maze-like spacecraft corridors. There are tons of locked doors, for which you'll need keys (straight out of Gauntlet!) and lots of slithering, screaming aliens to waste. You can pick up extra weapons, money to buy them and the greatest necessity of all, ammo. The control method is fast, smooth and responsive and the atmosphere generated by the brilliant graphics is super creepy. Best of all though are the ace sound FX and the brilliant sampled speech. As far as presentation is concerned, Alien Breed makes even the mighty Psygnosis look a little pale and the sheer brilliance of the gameplay lifts this one above an otherwise banal crowd. FRANK O'CONNOR SUPER SCARY ALIEN SCUM! You're alone with the rythm of your own breathing and the soft tread of your rubber soled boots. You round a bend in the corridor and there feasting on the flesh of a fallen space pilot is a seven foot tall, dripping. slimy. vicious nasty super alien What do you do? Fill your pants and call the laundrette? No! You're a space hero and you open fireand what follows is the best excuse ever for a gauntlet style rampage of carnage and destruction on a massive scale!

INTER MINHENU 0 INTEL SERPON SELLES EHIT INTERNETUORH What an incredible blast this is! Here's a game which seems to have come from nowhere, and blows the competition away! Alien Breed is an excellent game in just about every respect, putting many of the offerings from established softcos to shame! You've probably never heard of Team 17. but I can guarantee you'll be hearing a lot more about these guys from now on! Alien Breed is best described as a Gauntlet style blast em up with some truly horrific aliens to dust. The game is slick to the max, featuring some quite superb graphics and truly atmospheric sound effects for that extra touch. But it's the gameplay which scores highest off all easy as pie to pick up. Alien Breed grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go just like the monstrous stars of the show!

"REVIEW NINTENDO .99 BY NINTENDO resh from his success in the dream which was Super Mario Bros 2. Mario wakes up to find a scrawled note lying on the doormat of his plumber's pad. Bearing the seal of the Princess Mushroom, the letter is difficult to read and obviously written in a hurry. The message warns of the treacherous Bowser, ruler of the Koopas, and his plan to take over the Mushroom Worlds. Having overrun the lands with his minions, Bowser turned the eight Kings into a variety of weird and wonderful animals stealing their magic wands in the process. Without these they are unable to revert back to their regular forms, thus making it impossible to lead their people, Putting away his plumbing gear (Mrs Miggins' leaky cistern would have to wait) Mario awakens his brother Luigi and, without pausing to consider the danger they may be placing themselves in, our heroes rush off to the Mushroom Lands. But Bowser is not stupid summoning his seven children, the Koopalings, he orders them each to take an airship to one of the Mushroom Worlds and guard the Royal Castles with their lives. Mario has had it easy in the past. This time he won't succeed... MIX 'N' MATCH Every time the player scores 80,000 points, a floating playing card will appear on the map. Moving to the position occupied by the card (an Ace of Spades) and pressing the A button sends Mario to the Matching Game A 4x6 square grid is displayed, containing various special items and coins all hidden, of course. Mario must uncover two of the same item to receive that object, with only one wrong move allowed before the DX 9 0001 100 900 game is over and the screen reverts to the main play area. @@@@@ @ 191 "


"REVIEW A REEL WINNER Pressing the A button on an area covered by a static Ace of Spades allows Mario to try his luck at the Spinning Reels game. Three items a Starman, a mushroom and a flower are repre sented across three horizontally spinning reels, the object being to correctly piece together one of the items in the middle of the screen by hitting the A button at the right time. Successful for mation of a whole item results in extra Marios, the highest num ber being five for the Starman. Hurrah! The third installment in the NES Super Mario Bros series rears its head at last and, in doing so, becomes, for me, the best game ever! Honestly, SMB3 is so astoundingly brilliant in every way, shape and form I'm sorely tempted to go out and buy a Nintendo simply for this cartridge. Graphically it's untouchable masses of bright and cheerful colour, superb definition and animation and hordes of different baddies to contend with over fifty in all and that is a lot, let me tell you! Sound is incredible. The instantly recognisable Mario effects make an appearance, along with some great new ones but it's the various ditties which appeal the most, from frenetic tunes to get the adrenalin racing to a couple of laid-back, reggae tracks containing excellent sampled drum noises! Then there's the game itself and what a game! Bursting with secret rooms, spilling over with bonus items and jam-packed with enemies, SMB3 is the most spectacular experience yet seen on a NES. There are continues available, but you won't want to use them as you'll actually feel disgusted with yourself for cheating! There is so much to collect, so much to kill, so many locations to find and explore, it's a puzzle as to how the creators had the imagination to come up with a game quite like this, let alone cram it all into one cartridge. What else can be said about this, the game to beat all games? Simply this Super Mario Bros 3 is one in a million, the Mona Lisa of video gaming. To compare it to anything else would be an insult just go out, get a Nintendo and make your life worthwhile! PAUL RAND "


"REVIEW FUN-FILLED FORTRESSES On each of the eight worlds is a fortress guarding access to the areas closest to the castle. These strongholds are guarded by Boom-Boom, boss of the Koopas and answerable only to Bowser. Boom-Boom holds the key to unlock the gate which in turn, allows Mario to tackle the later levels of each world, but it won't be easy to take it from him as he's running toward you, flying high and then divebombing you, and generally giving our Meditteranean mate a real headache ironically, that's exactly what Mario must do to Boom-Boom to win his prize! UPDATE Nintendo won't be releasing SMB3 on any other machine. Why should they, when they know fine well that it will shift untold quantities of their own console?! SUITS TO SUI Those silly Koopas have left a stack of power-suits scattered around the Mushroom Worlds and guess what they all it Mario like a glove!

FROG SUIT: Don this green garb on the watery levels and in stead of flapping around like a fish out of water, Mario can swim as gracefully as the ferocious launa he's up against HAMMER SUIT: No, not sunglasses and baggy trousers, but a smart set of togs rogued from the Hammer Bros gives Mario a load of devastating throwing hammers and, best of all, it's fireproof! sonundamentalmente 026 "


"REVIEW ! YOU GOT CARD Slippin-rippin-dang-fang. rotten-zarg-a-barg-a-dingdong! It's finally here. The game you thought would never actually exist. The best game ever. To be the best game ever, you would have to have perfect playabilty, immense lastability and graphics and sonics that pushed the host machine beyond its limits. Mario 3 does all those things and more. Fluid, smooth, uncomplicated controls, lush graphics and unbelievably jolly sampled tunes all add up to the most technically brilliant product on the NES. Better yet is the enormous variety of gameplay styles at your disposal. The game is massive. The stated eight levels are huge enough, but there are absolutely tons of hidden features and screens all over the place. There are sub-games aplenty, secret screens, bonus rooms, hidden levels and believe it or don't, a whole playable version of the original Mario Bros. game. This makes Sonic the Hedgehog look like a wet Sunday norning and even gives the Famicom's mighty Mario 4 a run for its money. If you have an NES, go down to your local Spank menagerie and software emporium and purchase this immediately, if you don't have an NES, go and buy one right now.

How the hell do you get a magazine out when the entire CVG office has gone down with a severe case of Marioitis? Symptoms include wide eyes glued to the screen, fingers clamped around the joypad and an inane sloppy grin stretched from ear to ear.

You have to see it to believe it, but Mario 3 is the best thing on any machine outside an arcade since, well, whatever used to be the best thing on any machine outside an arcade. Graphics and sound are superb, but the gameplay manages to defy even my highest words of praise! It's near flawless in its utterly stupendous incredibility and absolutely impossible to put down for anything less than a fire alarm and even then you find yourself weighing up the odds! Mario 3 is so addictive it ought to get a government health warning. Hide the cartridge and people start to get withdrawal symptoms it's that good!

"REVIEW Marl! .99 BY MICROPROSE ore renowned for their flight sims than ground-based transport Vlation, Microprose have put the pedal to the metal and come up with a breathtaking simulation of Formula One Grand Prix racing! Who can hope to capture all the thrills, spills glamour and excite ment of an entire Formula One season on computer? Geoff Cram mond, that's who the man behind Revs and The Sentinel. In Formula One Grand Prix, aspiring Sennas are given the chance to test their metal and mettle through the sixteen-race championship, including the British Silverstone circuit, Suzuka in Japan and the street course of Monaco regarded by many as the world's toughest. With a choice of 26 cars belonging to the official F1 teams of Wil liams, McLaren, Ferrari and others, performance data has been taken directly from that of the 1990 season. Do you think you pos sess the skill, stamina and sheer guts (and a decent motor!) to carry you to the top of the Drivers' Championship? Read on.. Geoff Crammond has a history of knocking out excellent car games, Revs and Stunt Car Racer being two brilliant examples. But why rest on your laurels when you can sit and slave for a year at a piece of software which surpasses all your previous efforts? Mircoprose's Formula One Grand Prix is the last word in highspeed driving games, except that it's not a game at all. It's an accurate simulation of a full F1 season, with all the attention to detail which we've come to expect from the masters of sim. The teams are there, the tracks are there, all accurately mapped from the real thing. If you happened to videotape the Monaco Grand Prix earlier this year, for example, put it on with the F1 Grand Prix version next to it and you'll notice that all the buildings are exactly where they are in real life! Whilst realism is important in any kind of sim, so too is playability and Grand Prix certainly scores here. Pull on your helmet, make sure the fire extinguisher's working and boot up Formula One Grand Prix, the fastest, smoothest, most exhilarating drive this side of Monaco! PAUL RAND 032 "

"REVIEWGRAMU acal SLIPPERY RIDE Being a simulation as opposed to a game, Formula One has a number of features normally available only to multi-million pound racing pros. Little graphical niceties are included, like a member of the pit-crew cleaning your windscreen when you make a pitstop and skidmarks on the track to mark the spots where unfortunate racers have come to a sticky end. Then there are the extras, not usually found in computer driving games but which the real guys experience every time they take to the road. The best of these is the effect of driving in the opposition's slipstream, at which point your engine revs higher allowing you to pull out and overtake easily! X1000 RP As far as I'm concerned Geoff Crammond has the Midas touch everything he works on is pure gold. Here he's gone platinum and produced a racing game so utterly superb I can hardly believe what I've seen let alone played! Somehow Formula One Grand Prix really does manage to capture all the best bits of racing fast cars for big money. Just drool over these screen shots, imagine all this running in real-time super-smooth 3D with yourself in complete control of one of the cars and you have some idea what I'm getting hysterical about. Remember those car-cam shots you see on the telly? The graphics look just the same and you're right in the middle of the action! This game is mega-fast too. There's an option to tone down the graphics for more speed, but even on full detail the cars are flying by! If you want my opinion, Murray Walker couldn't scream loud enough to do this game justice you've got to see it to believe it. Stunt Car Racer used to be my all-time fave 3D racer and I thought nothing could top it. I was wrong and you'd be a right wally to miss this! Take a bow, Mr C...

Bash the fuzzy ball over the net and hope you can still hit that sucker when your opponent bashes it back! The money to be made in this sport is immense and it's one of the few sports where women do as well financially as men. Tempers are short and the action intense. Super Tennis from Tonkin House attempts to capture the frenetic pace and hot bouncy action of the sport, with every feature of the real game included. You can play doubles or singles either against the computer or against a friend. So grab your balls and prepare to do battle on the Centre Court.  Who knows, you may just get to be famous... Gah! Another return goes badly wrong! WAGESI 67 PORT 30 ONET PO 69 178. 92 IS ACES 2 BERE UGAS 6 6 CHIYAN 10 The umpire's blind! CVG just ground to a shuddering halt when this cart arrived. The cute, colourful graphics and ultra-realistic sound effects had everyone begging for a go. As far as gameplay is concerned, Super Tennis is probably the best simulation of tennis ever! The control pad's four buttons give such a wide range of shots that it's possible to pull off some spectacular moves in times of stress. In one player mode Tennis is incredible. With two players it's unbeatable. Playing a set against a friend is, more fun than should be allowed. You begin to get an inkling why players like MacEnroe and Agassi take such terrible tantrums when things go wrong. The tension you feel when you have to play a Tie-Break to decide the winner is unbearable. Each player from the list plays a little differently, each with good points and bad. For example, some players can dive for shots while others have excellent serves. Choose your favourite and get ready for one of the best sport simulations ever! FRANK O'CONNOR 036 "


"312—18-==7  REVIEW Preparing for a lightning serve to ligh pull ahead  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING! And the winner is...me! Super Tennis makes use of the four buttons on the Famicom's control pad and shots can be further enhanced by hitting a direction as you take a shot. There are two different serves available and the different combinations of shot available are immense The choice of players is huge, you can play male or female and each player is uncannily similar to a real life tennis star and plays like 'em too! YOU'RE CRAZY! I ACED HIM! With tons of players on offer, you can choose any of your fa. vourite tennis stars including the likes of Andre Agassi, Boris Becker, Gabriella Sabatini, Monica Seles and the illustrious John MacEnroe. Each player has his or her own special talents Becker comes out on top as the best all-rounder while the girls, unfortunately, are all a bit sad very slow with a low quality service. At the end of the day, their talents really depend on your reflexes and ability. This means you can't use your choice of player to hide your crapness like the Mean Machines boys...

"REVIEW), SUPERIORES SUPER TENNIS 1 CURAE OREN SURFACE HARD YES NO ARE YOU BLIND? THE BALL WAS IN! There are three different court surfaces to choose from. Clay, a lawn and artificial. The artificial surface is the most predictable and therefore the easiest to play on. Players run a tad faster on the rubberized surface and the ball bounces higher. The lawn is the nicest in terms of feel and players are more inclined to dive for the ball on this surface. If you want a real challenge though, try playing on the clay court. The ball is unpredictable, the players slower and the going tougher. Clay is the surface for big. clever tennis players who want to impress their mates and act hard so choose it! So you want to be a super-fit tennis star with a jet-propelled serve, wear tight little shorts and run about throwing huge tantrums when line calls don't go your way? Well, now you can! Super Tennis is quite simply the most fun you'll have outside the Centre Court and just make sure there's nothing breakable around when you play! Somehow Tonkin House have captured all the speed and excitement of tennis and made it possible for absolutely anyone to play. First of all there's the quite breathtaking speed of the game: you have to be quick of the mark to return those rocket-hot serves and follow them up with an almost limitless variety of moves, Then there's the cutesy graphics and quite superb sound,  so good you'd almost swear you were there! Above all there's the unbelievable tension generated by the game, It's hard to explain, but you've just GOT to win! You'll do anything to dust your opponent, even if that means throwing tantrums to put him off the game! Forget the gentle sport of lawn tennis. Dan Maskell and all that Super Tennis is a killer of a game and any hotshot Famicom owner who doesn't bust his balls for a copy should get his head examined. It's that good!

"REVIEW AMIGA BY US GOLD .99 he Megatwins are cule. They live cute they treattie cute and they sleep cute. Life is lovely until bad news comes along in the shape of a horrific beast known only as the Monster who does away with their daddy and seperates them Boo! Little do the Twins know that their father was in fact the king of cuteland. When they find ou, our liny heroes set out for revenge in a quest to find thus Monster and dish out some serious aggro Using their incredible jumping abilities and the gift of magis swords, the Twins head off in the direction of the action and vow never to return until the evil Monster finally bites the dust. Hurran) THE WEIRD WORLD OF PSYCHIC TWINS The Twins are a bit of a sad case. They were separated from each other as infants and their pop was killed. Brought up believing themselves to be only children, they somehow developed a kind of psychic link. So bizarre was the extent of this link, that often they ate meals at exactly the same time! Sometimes they would wear the same kind of clothes, even though they were separated by thousands of miles. Often they would both turn out in jeans, T-shirt and trainers uncanny! Weirdest of all, when they did finally meet they discovered that they both shared exactly the same birthday! Spookalicious or what? (You Idiot Ed) sear on the Earth            or in the sea Hot 3 Yeeeurch! US Gold knew what they were talking about when they said this game is so cute it would make you sick. Fortunately it's also pretty brilliant, and must rank as one of the best platform titles to appear on the Amiga. The Megatwins are full of character and even the bad guys look as nice as hell! There are so many hidden features and nice surprising touches, that you'll be playing this one long into the right. The game itself is fairly huge, with squillions of levels to visit and absolutely tons of groovy guardians to destroy. The control method excellent and this conversion really captures the spirit of the coin-op. Mega Twins was an excellent arcade game is this is a smashing conversion need I say more? FRANK O'CONNOR 040 040 "


"BIG THRILLS AHOY! Megatwins game is a cutesy (and I stress the word cutesy) platform romp, featuring the two player antics of the Megatwins. The action takes place on the ground, in the air and under the sea with the gamestyle changing to suit the environment. The twins can hack at the baddies with their big choppers, often revealing hidden bonus coins and other equally useful goodies any serious avenging twin should never be without In appearance the game is a bit similar to Wonderboy 3, but the RPG bit isn't there and this one features more platforms than you can shake a sword al... Cutesy platform rompara. ma seems to be the order of the day right now, what with the likes of Rodland, Magic Pockets, Marvel Land, Snow Bros and countless others trying to tickle us all under the chin and Mega Twins ranks up there with the best of them. This is a fine conversion of a pretty spiffy coin-op. containing all the playability of the original. My only criticism is that the levels tend to look a bit samey, but that's not unique to this game and exactly the same grumble applies to the arcade original. I've seen so many cutesie games lately they're almost coming out of my ears, but Mega Twins is just so darned good you just have to keep playing and recommendations don't come too much higher than that! If you're ready for more oh-so-lovely graphics and a game which plays like a dream, then Mega Twins is the one for you. TIM BOONE C C AMIGA GRAPHICS SOUNDS OVERALL 90 BE 100 "

"  REVIEW .99 BY US GOLD octor Maybe is not a happy meglomaniac. First of all he was thoroughly trounced by James Pond Underwater Agent. Now he's been hiding away and planning his next evil escapade. After months of thought, the perfect idea suddenly appears in Maybe's brain and it's all to do with toys. But how can harmless toys possibly harm mankind? By altering their workings so that they become psycopathic killers. that's how. One quick jaunt to the Arctic later and hey presto! A toy factory site taken over, the toys are tampered with and the devillish Doc is ready to put his plan into action. Except that Maybe has not banked upon the wondrous advancements of piscine technology. F.1.5.H agents have devised the ultimate agent Robocod. Half aquatic animal, half machine. Robocod's directives are to shut down every toy in sight before shutting down Doc Maybe for good. Sounds easy? It would be, were it not lor the fact that there are ten factories to put out of action and Maybe isn't going down without a fight! SEEING DOUBLE Look familiar to you, this Robocod geezer? That's because he's been modelled from the original underwater agent. James Pond. As if you haven't guessed yet. Robocod is the sequel to that great computer and console game! While appearances suggest that the two are one and the same. the new. improved version has a number of revolutionary features: some of which you have to see to believe! James Pond was a scorcher of a title so much so that it became one of the few computer games to make the transition to cartridge. And whilst the sequel incorporates a very different style of gameplay, this one looks to be heading exactly the same way! Robocod is an excellent piece of software. lifting the styles of both Super Mario Bros and Sonic The Hedgehog and placing them into a frenetic game full of jolly sprites and challeng. ing platform action. Robocod's graphics really are something special: a jamboree of cute baddies, the best of which is that old sweetie himself. Bertie Bassett! There are also masses of collectables, including one of real significance to myself a Newcastle Brown Ale Bottle (well, that's what it looks like to me, anyway)! Lashings of sound only add to the game's overall atmosphere, making the overall package one of such a high quality that only a sad fool would deign to pass it by. PAUL RAND 044 "


"E REVIE REVIC FULL STRETCH FUN AND JAPES! Our man Pond has a wide range of skills and talents at his disposal, not least the ability to stretch his body in order to grab hold of the ceiling! Cod can rise miles by stretching his body straight up, then grab an object and shimmy along to avoid those annoying floor-based hazards! UPDATE Robocod should be doing his thing on an ST in your pond right about now so grab it while you can! SWEET THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR! Stuffed full of 70 gorgeous scolling screens. Robocod features all manner of supercute meanies to discover and destroy! Among them is a pretty Bertie Bassett-looking dude who's so cute it's almost a shame to trash him! Treated to an early preview of Robocod come time ago. I knew we were in for something very special. What an emormous laff this game is! No matter what anyone else tells you, Robo is very reminiscent of both Sonic and Mario but takes the best bits out of each and creates a fine balance between the two. The graphics are simply gorgeous somebody has gone to a lot of trouble to get the colour co-ordination just right and make the whole thing look like a big bold bag of jelly tots! Gameplay is where Robocod scores highest, though. There's almost nothing you can't do, and half the fun is finding just what lies in those strange places you didn't think you could reach. I'm fast running out of superlatives here, so let me just say that I think Robocod is one of the best Amiga platform games I've seen. Buy it and pat yourself on the back for knowing a bloody good game when you see one! TIM BOONE AMICA GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 93 LASTABILITY 92 OVERALL 93 "

HEAD BUTT PILEDRIVER Pitfighter has to be one of the most conspicuous arcade games around. With its use of enormous digitised, scaled sprites and ultra violence it was also going to be one of the most difficult conversions to produce. Thankfully, programmers Teque have turned in a competent job. Graphically. Pitfighter is very good not as awesome as the coin-op, but not far off with massive. reasonably smoothly animated characters. Special mention must go to the sprite scaling, which works remarkably well, helping in no small way to capture the feel of the arcade original. The same is true of the sound with plenty of \"oof's and \"urgh's and a cracking tune. Where Pitfighter can be found lacking is in its control. It takes what seems like ages for the characters to respond to your joystick movements and sometimes they don't do anything at all! Having said that, you learn to anticipate movements and get the shot in before your enemy can do anything and it's at this point that Pitfighter becomes a satisfying, if not completely accurate, conversion of a fabulous coin-op.

"I REVIEW WE ARE PIT FIGHTING HEROES The original Pitfighter coin-op allowed three players to fight sim. ultaneously against both the opponents and each other. Due to the computer's restrictions, that number has had to be reduced by one, but there are still the orginal trio of pit fighters to choose from. Here they are, in all their glory. UPDATE You lucky people! Pitfighter is coming soon on all major formats, so you too can kick ten bells out of someone without getting hurt! With Christmas just around the corner, it could be a straight scrap between this and Final Fight reviewed last ishfor the number one slot in Santa's sack. Domark took on one mother of a task when they said they were converting this Atari coin-op, and thankfully the results are pretty good! Tackling the arcade original's sprite scaling head-on, they've come up with a graphics system which just about apes the coin-op and looks pretty damn good on the Amiga when you see it first time, You'll find loads of features from the original included in the game scrapping away in the middle of the crowd, these bloodthirsty so-and-sos will try to push you back in if you try to do a runner! Boasting some fine digitised graphics and well above average sound, Pitfighter has all the hallmarks of a great game, but is let down in the playability stakes by a control method which is a bummer at best and a bitch at worst. Once you allow for this, and you will, Pitfighter becomes a game you'll want to return to but I have to say that US Gold's Final Fight just has the edge in the playability stakes. Try to take a look at both before you buy and decide which one's right for you.

The review of Heroquest received a ceeded to Screen One and, ten minutes later, returned to buy anHIT! mark but overall it received only 87% and a game has to other one. He went away again and returned to purchase a third have 90% or more to become a HIT! Finally, I would just like to me a HITI Finally I would just like to ticket.

With the likes of Xenon ll and Super Kick Off, Dear YOB, to name just two, I reckon the Master System's here to stay Are Master Systems phased out? If so, do you want to buy one (seeing as you're a poor old YOB) because, having a Game Boy yourself lucky every day that passes and nobody beats you so skulk off to wherever anyone can stand you and count and a Megadrive, I have stopped buying Master System games.

Dear YOB I am 13 years old and have a 32K BBC and a Sega Game Gear, both if which I use a lot. Ignoring the BBC, there is only one thing that irritates me: Machines like the Lynx and Game Gear are perfectly capable of producing excellent graphics, but I have yet to meet a great deal of people who think that having a handheld means having a proper console. Mostly their attitude is: \"Okay, so when do you get this console then?\" Down my neck of the woods, some see it as an expensive version of one of those Systema jobbies that you can get down at Argos for .99! Ok, so maybe it can run on virtually any power source you can throw its way and is no bigger than a very large box of fags, but the Game Gear still has 32 on-screen colours from a palette of 4096 (bigger than that of the DEAR YOB 05 BOYO "

Nottingham YOB: So your mates reckon handhelds aren't proper consoles, eh? How come they've now got their very own magazine then, free with CVG? Don't your miserable mates look stupid now? As anyone with any sense will tell you, BIRTHDAY BLUES 2 THE REVENGE Dear YOB. I have written this letter to you because you are the only hope that I have left of getting Shinobi for my Sega Master System. You see I have just had a birthday and I was looking forward to someone sending me loads of dosh so that I could buy the game but, alas, nobody sent me any money. I was broken-hearted, but didn't tell my Mum or Dad that I was disappointed because I didn't want to upset them. They don't even know that I've written this letter to you. Please, please please send me the game, YOB. If you do I will be in your debt for eternity because my birthday is the only chance I have to buy a games because they are so expensive. PAUL PETERS Wellingborough, Northants Handkerchiefs HAPPY BIRTHDAY PAVLOVE MUMMYk DADDY XX YOB: So you think you're hard done by, eh? All I ever got for my birthdays was a clout round the ear and an empty tin of sardines and that was from the postman. Actually, I tell a lie: Auntie once bought me a pair of bovver boots, but I was too young to tie the laces and crawled around the cot with them hanging off my feet. Still, why not look on the bright side. if you always get crap presents you'll grow up to be just like me. a stingy git who reckons you'll have to grovel a lot better than that before you get anything more than an old bovver boot up the backside...

And you don't get more remote than Lost Vega, the leisure station on the outskirts of the star system. Blame it on the booze, blame it on the mesmerising moves of the Thallian Thorax Dancer, but the boys stand motionless in awe of the sight before them. Only it isn't the dancing which is causing their hypnosis but the spells of the evil Dark Queen, disguised as the alien groover. Before they get the chance to defend themselves, the Dark Queen captures one of the Toads and whisks him off in her battleship, the Gargantua, to the planet Armagedda. The remaining two Toads, now fully recovered, race to their mentor, Professor T Bird, aboard the good ship Vulture.

Looking at the first issue of CVG. it's amazing to see how much things have changed. At the time it might have been the most happenin of mags, but these days it looks so-o-o boring. It's truly dire! For your 75p you got a full three pages of reviews in the magazine complete with no pictures or ratings! Apparently the person who designed the pages didn't like using screenshots and insisted on using drawings and illustrations instead. What a div! It's the same for the news, too pages of boring text and tacky little drawings! They really didn't have much of a clue back then, did they? Most of the magazine is taken up with type-in listings horrible BASIC programs usually packed full of bugs, and were always a pile of old crap when you finally got them to work! Other high lights included the Adventure Column (boredom central), puzzles and crosswords, a column on using BASIC (ugh), how to imake graphics (yawn) and an article on how to build your own computer (aaaagh!).

When the ZX81 started to run out of steam they changed their name to New Generation Software and released such minor Spectrum hits as Escape. 3D Tunnel, Trashman and Knot in 3D as well as Shoot The Rapids and Cliffhanger on the C64 before sinking without trace. IMAGINE Probably the most famous software flop ever. Their first Spectrum release, Arcadia, was a very addictive shoot 'em up but to say the quality of the games which followed were \"uneven\" would be an understatement. Schizoids, Frantic, Wacky Waiters. Zip Zap and Stonkers were comparitively dungy, but still the company hyped up the public with full page adverts detailing what type of sandwiches their programmers/designers/musicians ate, and they even got on national television in a news piece about the wonder of computer whizz-kids earning loads of money for programming games. Of course, because Imagine weren't producing many games which were worth buying, the whizz-kids weren't earning loads of money for long. In the midst of two \"mega game projects (advertised as Psyclapse and Bandersnatch) the company crashed spectacularly and the dream of boy programmers becoming computer pop stars was over. SLR (STACK LIGHT RIFLE) TOP GAME TITLES OF ALL TIME Looking through some old issues of CVG, we can see numerous oddball titles for numerous oddball games. There may well be a few we've missed (in which case why not send 'em in and remind us), but here are the most memorable... Blam! Light rifles like these were supposed to revolutionise gaming. Where are WE ARL SEEN ON N ...790 QUICKSILVA Quicksilva were there at the start, with versions of Defender and Asteroids for the ZX80 and ZX81 (both \"WRITTEN IN MACHINE CODE TO ENSURE FAST FLICKER-FREE GRAPHICS\"). They went on to produce two of the first Spectrum games, Space Intruders and Meteor Storm (which even gargled the words \"Meteor Alert!\" at the player), as well as Time Gate (a 48k 3D space trek which was very big in its day) and Ant Attack (stylish arcade adventure set in a city full of giant insects). Things went downhill a bit when Quicksilva began branching out into BBC and C64 games, and their parting shot was Gryphon, a very pretty 64 game by Tony Crowther (who latterly programmed Captive on the Amiga), which was bugged to oblivion. METAGALACTIC LLAMAS BATTLE AT THE EDGE OF TIME: Llamasoft got a bit too weird with this bizarre episode of llama destruction (possibly inspired by exotic herbal cigarettes). DEUS EX MACHINA: Automata's experimental odyssey into concept games which was synchronised to the taped voices of Jon Pertwee, Ian Dury and Frankie Howerd, amongst others. DADDY'S HOT ROD: Actually, this is a driving game. programmed for the Texas Instruments T1-99/4 by Lantern Software (\"Games That Shine\"). \"Guide Dad's Car! Plenty of obstacles! Suitable for all ages! Refuel as you go!\" ATTACK OF THE COMMUNIST SPACE MUTANTS FROM MARS: or something.

"TURTLES Nowabungal After the immense success of the comics, the cartoon series, the movie, the plastic toys, the soap-on-arope, the other spin-offs and, of course, the original console and computer game, Raphael, Leonardo, Michaelangelo and Donatello will be storming back onto monitor screens across the country in Turtles 2 The Coin-Op. A conversion of the smash three-player arcade game, Turtles 2 features the four heroes in a half-shell in a race against Shredder and his Foot Clan, who have kidnapped acei and friend April O'Neill and spirited her away into the depths of the city. All your favourite TMHT characters including Shredder, Be-Bop and Rocksteady, Professor Baxter Stockman and Krang, not forgetting that quartet of totally radical dudes, make an appearance, along with legions of those dreaded Foot Clanners. We've taken a look at Turtles 2 on the NES and a variety of computer formats as part of our great lowdown round-up, so let's see how they fare! THE NINTENDO GAME Whoa, dude! The NES version of Turtles 2 The Coin-Op is a multi-level extravaganza including so many features from the original arcade machine you'd swear someone had ripped the guts out of your Nintendo and shoved a PCB in its place! All the moves are there and the characters look as good and animate as well as they do in the coin-op right down to the Turtles sliding down the wall after being thrown against it! Unfortunately, due to the amount of joypad ports attached to the machine by Nintendo, Turtles 2 on the NES can only support two-player action, but all four greenbacks are there for the choosing so no-one can complain! We reckon Turtles Il is coming along marvellously SO keep those peepers peeled and look out for the official CVG review of a cart which looks a bit special... 071 "


"PRE THE COMPUTER VERSIONS As with the original Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles computer game (which, incidentally, sold an absolute stack of copies and is still in the charts!), Mirrorsoft are releasing the coin-op conversion with all the hard keyboard work being done down Croydon way by those bodacious lads at Probe Software. Most computer versions of arcade games these days have the graphics ported directly across from the original and are then touched up using a package such as D-Paint. With Turtles 2 the visuals have been drawn completely freehand using photos and video footage from the machine and, although memory restrictions have caused a reduction in animation frames, the movements of Raf, Leo, Mikey, Donny and their enemies are difficult to distinguish from the real thing! As far as gameplay is concerned, only the C64 version was in a sufficiently playable state to form an opinion. Whilst only two Turtles can play at the same time, it is looking very good in. deed. To find out whether the other versions Amiga, ST, Spectrum, CPC and PC come up to scratch, watch for the full review in these very pages! TOADS V TURTLES WHICH IS BEST? There's no doubt about it. the Toads have moved into Turtle territory in a big way, and seem certain to give our pizza munching heroes a serious run for their money. But which is best? We've seen both games, and whilst it's just too early to compare the two we reckon they're both looking pretty darned brill. Stay tuned for the ultimate CVG lowdown when we'll put. these two great games head to head to find out! VERSION NINTENDO DATE EARLY '92 PRICE   072 "

Once you own this company, spend all your cash and more call the broker and operate RR; there you can give $100,000 to the company just purchased give that company $7,000,000 and build track for that company and, when you have around $20,000,000, start to repay all the bonds sold at the start.

"AMIGA RAILROAD TYCOON MICROPROSE The pioneers of the age of the train come to life in Microprose's conversion of their top PC simulation. Choose to base your railroad in either East or West USA, Europe or England then, after selecting the appropriate skill levels, begin to build that railfreight system, ensuring that your line makes a profit (you don't want to end up in the same boat as BR, do you!) and keeping a beady eye on those greedy competitors. Microprose have done a superb job of converting Railroad Tycoon to the Amiga; the original never went overboard on presentation, so the graphics are a bit on the basic side, with sound effects amazingly similar to those heard on kids' TV show Rainbow (during the picture-drawing bit)! Gameplay's the important factor with this one you won't be disappointed. OVERALL SZE 92% SIGNOL TOWER DEPOT 150.000 25.000) INTERNATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP ATHLETICS Station 1 646.00 HAWK Well, the athletics season is over for another year, but if you crave for a spot of track and field on computer, why not take a look at International Championship Athletics, with its cornucopia of events including sprints, high and long jumps, javelin and hammer throwing, to name but a few? I'll tell you why. Because it's a pile of old . no, I can't use that word in these pages. This is one BAD piece of software. with some of the most embarrassing graphics ever witnessed. The commentator looks like a hideously deformed Trigger from Only Fools and Horses, the crowd look like undead Kevin Keegan clones and as for everything else? Don't ask. And certainly don't buy. OVERALL SILENT SERVICE MICROPROSE Six years after the original Silent Service submerged Microprose in an ocean of awards, the sequel makes its way onto Amiga screens. Converted from the PC. Silent Service II doesn't wildly differ from its parent in terms of playability perhaps not surprisingly, after all, there aren't that many differences between World War Il submarines. Where the big changes lie are in the updated graphics, some of which are digitised, and the inclusion of new missions and a campaign option. If you don't already possess the original, this is one game which simulation buffs should watch out for; if the original Silent Ser. vice is already propping up your software collection though, give the sequel a blast before purchasing 'cos this may be just too similar for your liking.

"F15 STRIKE EAGLE II ATARI ST MICROPROSE .99 Leap into the cockpit of the world's premier fighter jet and take to the skies over a number of hostile countries in this, the sequel to the top flight combat sim of bygone times Converted from the PC, this version of F15 II has managed to retain all of the original features and, more importantly, the feel which made players gasp it's a cross between a simula tor and a shoot 'em up, with all the graphical excellence which you associate with Microprose products yet a noticeable lack of keys to wrestle with just to get off the ground. If I were you, I'd snap up this particular little gem straightaway. 94% GRANDSTAND DOMARK .99 All you sporty types listen up: Domark have knocked together a compilation of four of the best known sports games around but what's it like? Three of the games are actually a bit smart. Continental Circus is a Grand Prix racer, and a very playable one at that with good-looking graphics to boot. Pro Tennis Tour is one of the few tennis sims available for the ST and probably the best one around, whilst World Class Leaderboard isn't exactly the best golf game doing the rounds but, as an arcade-style 18-holer in a compilation, you can't really go wrong. The only one not worth the effort is Gazza's Super Soccer. A wasted license the first time around, the game has deteriorated even further with age. Forget about that one and plump for the other three. 75% ILVERS LES og ARMALYTE THE FINAL RUN SHINOBI MASTERTRONIC THALAMUS .99 Generally regarded as the best ever shoot 'em up to ap. pear on the C64, Armalyte has been updated, tweaked and prodded and carted over to the 16-bits. Enter the Forbidden Zone and blast a trail through five tortuous levels of death. de. struction and many weapons. Thalamus could have made a treat of a game out of Arma lyte, but instead have chickened out and opted for a weak interpretation of the original. Graphically no great shakes, the biggest gripe is that the gameplay is simply too average to make Armalyte stand out from the wealth of shoot 'em ups which have launched onto the market recently. .99 Joe Mushashi, manager of the Ninja Training Academy, is in a bit of a tizzy. His pupils have all been taken prisoner and he must go off in search of them before their parents discover his inability to look after their sons and take them to some other school. What follows is a multi-level beat 'em up in which Joe goes up against the kidnappers using fists, feet and a host of ninja armaments. Unlike the high-quality C64 version which I looked at last issue, ST Shinobi is a bit of a sad attempt, featuring jerky sprites and watered-down gameplay. It's not a bad buy at .99. but there are better titles around for the same amount of money 64% 60% 091 "

"REVIEW AMICA .99 BY GREMLIN GRAPHICS Defore a trainee gets a crack at running his own colony, a strict cise must be successfully accomplished. This takes the form of a simulation featuring everything which could happen in a real outer-space colony The simulation can be completed in one of two ways wrong or wrong again. Commander Pacharell selected neither and won Winning in a no-win situation isnt something which happens day at the Training Centre, so the Council had little option but to give him a real mission to colonise the ten planets orbiting the Rhebus sun. Not the most simple of first-outings, as Rhebus is but a stone's throw away from the edge of the Open Systems infamous for their less-than-friendly habitants. Still, it was Pacharelli's big chance to show the Council that he could command more than a training machine, so he jumped at the chance... USA SECUT P EL POPULATE YOUR DREA SOU THIS SILL COSTO S REALS TO EATHE Crumbs, another Sim City lookalike to join the ever growing list of world simulators. So what's this one got which the others haven't? Not a lot, as it happens but it does most things a whole lot better than its competitors. The social side of Utopia is a good example annoy the colonists by mucking around with taxes, making them homeless or simply not clearing up the debris after a building has been demolished and they're likely to make sure you know exactly how they feel by striking and hitting the spot where it hurts most in the pocket. So many random events occur that the game is different each time you play. Eclipses render solar panels useless, knocking out power to the entire colony and leaving the population wide open to attack unless you've remembered to build power stores. Terrorists infiltrate the system and blowing up your most important buildings etc etc. There are some great graphics touches, but the biggest pull for me is the deep yet simple gameplay which had me engrossed for hours. Utopia is a title I'll certainly be returning to, simply because of its ease of play and massive possibilities. PAUL RAND IT'S A COLONY COR! Taking on the role of Pacharelli, the player is invited to build a mini-Earth on the ten planets of the Rhebus solar system. Using an initial grant from the mother planet, the area to be colonised must be suitably kitted out with all the necessary ingredients for a stable existance for the colonists. This entails supplying food. power, a security force. leisure and most important for this unstable part of space, a sound defensive in. frastructure. Taxes need to be set, accomodation constructed, raw materials mined and a multitude of de cisions made. Being master of all before you is an ominous, usually thankless task, so advisers are supplied to help keep track of the various goingson. Think you can keep the people happy, productive and free from alien slaughter. all at the same time? 094 "


"REVIEW ! SOCIAL INSECURITY People are people, even on an outer-space colony. They have to live together and work together and it's up to the Colony Leader to make sure that everything ticks along nicely. Big gripes include taxation setting the level of taxes too low keeps the people happy in the short term but starves the colony of funds, whilst too high a level causes resentment and disorder Folk need somewhere to live, so housing must be made available, along with various other facilities to increase the Quality of Life of the colonists. The lower the Quality of Life. the bigger the problems become, from strikes to acis of terrorism and even murders! PLANETARY PALS One man can't move a mountain, but a Colony Leader and a group of Advisers can form a successful colony, The player has access to six Advisers, each offering de tailed information on the complete workings of the colony, from amount of inhabitants and level of materials to current technological level and state of combat readiness. Here also, it's possible to alter some of the game's limits, like the amount of workers in a factory or the level of finance to hand over to scientific research. B5D de Just when you think you've seen enough world management games, along comes one with such a great edge on the others you're hooked once again! In the case of Utopia we're talking about ease of play, which makes a great difference when faced with the daunting task ahead. Playing God has never been such fun, 'cos all the colonists rely on you for just about everything they need to keep body and soul together. Mess it up and they're a mess. so the pressure's really piled on to get your backside in gear and sort these people out! With a squillion things which can go wrong and often do! Utopia keeps you right on your toes: So thank goodness it's a dream to pick up and play or you might blow your minions' lives away looking through the instructions! Great graphics, fine sound and gameplay which has been polished until it shines adds up to a game you'll want to add to your collection. Unless you're a shoot 'em up fiend who spends all his time blowing six bells out of everybody, in which case you won't. Good stuff! TIM BOONE MILITARY MATTERS A Colony Leader must be continually aware of and ready for an enemy allack, which is why Spying is such an important factor in Utopia. Agents will perform relative to cash, so while noi money means no spies, a large injection of funds gives access to the very best intelligence. Whether or not an attack is imminent, delenses must be con structed and maintained. Initially arms like ships and Tanks are, available, along with missiles and lasers but new, more power ful weaponry can be invented by scientists. Remember though, the technicians require materials to build these gizmos so en sure that ore deposits are quickly found and mines set up to ex plot these mineral riches.

His pals, the Chirps, have been rounded up by the Cats and placed around their maze like lair to be fattened for a feline feast. Hearing their little tweets for help. Flicky tracks down the entrance to the Cats hideout and, tea thers ruffled, marches through the door. Only then does Flicky understand the magnitude of his quest. Chirps are scattered around each level, guarded by Cats and L zards. In order to free them from their plight, they must be gathered together and led out of the Flicky Dooreither one at a time, in groups or all together. Meanwhile the cats will be trying to close down Flicky's rescue operation.

WSHH ES53 ELECTRIC BONUS ROUND PAUSE NET YOURSELF A TASTY BIRD! Every few levels Flicky can try his hand at the bonus game, which he plays along with those crazy Cats. The ferocious felines launch Chirps from see-saws, leaving Flicky to catch them in his butterfly net. There are twenty to collect and netting the lot grabs Flicky a whopping score! For a game consisting of a single-screen, wrap-round stage, Flicky is surprisingly brill! No need for massive scrolling levels or huge. axe-weilding sprites here all the characters are tiny, but they animate very well, especially Flicky himself who flaps his wings for dear life when you launch him into the air! The idea is not unlike Bubble Bobble, except you're saving, not killing, Other than that, and the fact that the screen isn't static, the game's basically the same. Actually, the wrap-round screen adds to the excitement . whilst running after a stray Chirp and being chased by a nungry Cat, it's difficult to know where you are on the screen. Flicky's sound only adds to the overall atmosphere, with a terribly joily ditty and lovely sound effects like those of the chirpy Chirps. The Megadrive is somewhat starved of cute plattorm titles and Flicky is a welcome new tall on the machines PAUL RAND OOOOOO 096 "

The bright and simple graphics may seem completely naff at first, but you soon discover they're perfect for this simple game and the game chirps away merrily as vou flap about like fury. Flicky is roughly the equivalent of The Birdy Song on computer . nobody will admit that they play it, but everybody sneaks off to the Games Room and chirps their way through a few more levels. I'm not sure how long this one will fare in the lastability stakes, but right now Flicky is a bit of an office sensation.

This is one hell of a big title, containing numerous playing possibilities as well as enough violence to satisfy even the most discerning Arnie fan. Polygons portray the action to great effect and, even though the frame rate can become desperately sluggish at times, the detail can be altered to give the proceedings that bit more of a boost. The option of playing either Reese or Arnie is an inspired one, creating two clear forms of play, and the amount of items to find, weapons to fire and people to kill is more than adequate. At times, Terminator can be a bit of a drag in the early stages of the game it's difficult to figure out just what you're supposed to do and how to do it mainly due to a lousy instruction manual but spend some time at the machine and everything becomes crystal clear. Pacifists, steer well clear of The Terminator, a sprawling epic definitely not for the weak of stomach! mas 055 0 216 0469 STEEN DIR: 007 PAUL RAND 100 "


"REVIEW REVIEW tngs YOUR CLOTHES GIVE THEM TO ME The Terminator gives the player the best of both worlds the option of playing either Reese or Arniel Each character obviously has differing objectives. Whilst Kyle must find and protect Sarah r, the Terminator needs to kill her along with anyone who stands in its way. With a pair of PCs linked together via a serial cable, two players can take part in the game at the same timeone as Reese and the other as the T-800 for a true multi-player experience!

Well, it is the 1980s you know! nad Gas ay Car NATORI I'LL BE BACK For the benefit of those unitiated few, the movie The Terminator, by Aliens/Abyss director James Cameron, was released in 1984. Costing $7,000,000 a pittance compared to the big-budget Rambo/Rocky Stallone extravaganzas of the same era The Terminator was the ideal vehicle for the movie's two stars, hitherto-unknown actress Linda Hamilton (whose previous work included a part in the dire chiller, Children Of The Corn) and one-time Mr Universe, dabbler in one or two film projects and incredibly large Austrian, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Both went on to better things thanks to the success of Terminator, Hamilton taking the starring role in hit American TV series Beauty And The Beast, whilst Schwarzenegger's credits hardly need mentioning: Commando, Predator, Red Heat, Twins and Kindergarten Cop to name just a few. Earlier this year the two came together again in Terminator 2 Judgement Day, a se quel which took seven years to appear and cost more than any other film to produce over $100,000,000. Described by one movie critic as \"the most spectacular sci-fi ride ever\", Terminator 2 became the highest-grossing cinematic production of all time, earned Arnie who switched from baddie to goodie $15,000,000 and a private plane, and managed to blag itself a 15 certificate despite various neck-skewering scenes and a particularly disturbing nuclear war sequence. If you haven't yet seen this, possibly the greatest film ever, then you don't deserve to have eyes... UPDATE No plans as yet for any conversions.

Having recovered from our three-page PC Terminator review, just run your peepers over this incredible preview of the Megadrive game of the film! Have we got the goods or what? As you'll quickly discover, the two games are completely different and published by completely different software houses, and both of them look totally bloomin' brill. Anyway, here's Arnie lookalike PAUL RAND to tell you all about Virgin's mega Megadrive cart. Take it away, muscles... Seven years after Seargent Kyle Reese saved the life of Sarah Connor and halted the destruction of the entire human race in James Cameron's classic Terminator, Virgin have picked up the rights to produce the game on Sega Megadrive. For a movie which, dollar for dollar, made around twelve times more than it cost to produce, as well as rocketing Mr Biceps to the top, it's taken a long time to make it to the con soles. After this long wait it had better be good... THE FUTURE: Reese must enter the Skynet control centre, running the gauntlet of Hunter-Killers and Terminators, set a time-bomb on the main power plant and find and enter the Time Displacement Equipment before it is destroyed in the resulting explosion. STREETS OF LA: Our hero is transported to the year 1984 and must begin his search for Sarah Connor. But first he must escape the wrath of the Los Angeles Police Department, who are on his tail and kitted out with cars and helicopters! 104 "


"PRE TECH NOIR: Reese finds Sarah Connor in the punk nightclub Tech Noir. Unfortunately, so does the Terminator. Kyle must ensure the safety of Sarah by taking out the cyborg, but 20th century weaponry is useless against a hyper-alloy combat unit... POLICE STATION: Reese is captured by the LA PD and placed in a cell, whilst Sarah enjoys what she believes to be the safety of a police department. The trouble is, noone banked on the Terminator gate crashing the party... VIEW Megadrive Terminator, programmed by Probe, follows the plot of the film closely. So closely, in fact, that the main character is not Arnie. The player controls Reese throughout the game, with the Terminator making regular cameo appearances. The action actually starts before the point at which the film began. Level one sees Reese in the year 2029, carrying out his orders to destroy the Time Displacement Equipment used by the Terminator to travel back in time to the year 1984, and going through the machine before the time-bombs detonate. From then onwards, the player will take Kyle on a digital journey across some of the best-known locations in sci-fi cinema history before the ultimate showdown... 0000000000 TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS PLANT: Reese and Sarah have succeeded in killing the Terminator in a massive explosion or so they think.

As for Reese, he was created using the same method seen in the spectacular Prince of Persia. An actor was videotaped carrying out a number of moves and each frame digitised and animated to create the running, jumping, shooting hero you see here. Drooling over these screen shots?

"WE ARE THE FIRST SAMURAI IMAGEWORKS PRE Cirst Samurai looks all set to become one of the biggest events on the Amiga this year. We sent CVG rising son Frank O'Connor down to Vivid Image Design to find out what all the fuss was about VIEW UN 000000 GET YOUR SWORD OUT! At first glance, first Samuri looks slightly similar to arcade classic Strider, and as you can see from these screenshots the graphics are looking absolutely brill! The action scrolls in four directions and takes place in all kinds of terrain. Starting off in the Japanese countryside, you eventually make your way to the city for the final showdown with the dark wizard dude. Your sword-swingin' samurai can perform all manner of neat tricks, including a handy reverse backswing. He can pick up weapons to aid him along the way and on occasion call up a good wizard to help things along. If this was just a jumping slashfest it would be a potentially brilliant game, but First Samurai is a whole lot more. There are tons of puzzles to solve and lots of problems to be overcome. Strategy plays almost as big a part as the excellent violence involved. Look out for this one before Christmas, 'cos that's when it'll be doing its thing. 100000 THE SAMURAI STORY Hundreds of years ago in fuedal Japan a young warrior trained under the watchful eye of his Samurai master. His strength, skill and courage were incredible and it wasn't long before his talents as a fighter superseded that of his mentor. But he was rash, and his master began to train him in the ways of Budo: the martial code and the importance of honour. Strange times were these, magic and mystery still hung like a dark shadow over the land of the rising sun... An evil magician, intent on conquering the land, killed our young warrior's master in a bloody and terrible battle. The evil wizard then tried to kill the young apprentice, but his prayers were answered and ancient Shinto gods hurtled the evil wizard into the distant future. The 21st century. The Samurai, now masterless, became a Ronin. A samurai with no leader and no incentive other than money and rage. He followed the dark magician to the future, seeking revenge in a land he could not understand... 3D 10 .550 VERSION AMIGA DATE DECEMBER DECEMBER DECEMBER PRICE      TBA 123 "

"THE BLUES BROTHERS PRE TITUS Jake and Elwood Blues: the two unlikliest brothers in the hisUtory of rock 'n' roll. If you haven't seen the movie then you must have been living in Minehead for the last forty years. The Blues Brothers are trying to get their band back together or at least they are in the movie version. In the forthcoming game from Titus, the Blues Brothers already have the band together, but the local sherrit won't let them play a concert. Legally, he ain't got no right to do that, but he's hidden the band's equipment all over town and it's up to Jake or Elwood to get it back with five very important bits of musical equipment to recover through five levels The game bears an unceny resemblance to the Mario series, but scrolls in lour directions. The bros have the ability to leap great distances climb wire fences and throw crates at oncoming baddies! The most interesting feature of this release are the very accurate renditions of top quality Blues Brothers tunes. Sampled guitars and rockin' good drum riffs all add to the general atmosphere or gettin the band together\". Watch out for it around yuletide this year.
