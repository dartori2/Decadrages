WHOSE FINGERPRINT ...? Dark and murky things went on behind the scenes while Mike Singleton was writing Treachery for us. There were rumours of industrial espionage and other computer magazines sneaking about the C&VG offices attempting to discover our secrets. One day when we arrived at the office we found this fingerprint on the door of Bug Hunter's cupboard. We have to keep him locked away at night you see otherwise he escapes to watch Crossroads and we don't see him again for weeks. Anyway, can you find your way through the fingerprint maze and discover just who it was lurking in the C&VG office. By following the correct path to the centre of the print, you'll discover the name of the culprit. And just to make it more interesting, the first ten names out of the C&VG memory bin on March 16th will win some games or a games tape for their computer. Fill in the coupon below and mail it to Fingerprint Contest, Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ, to reach us before March 16th. HOLMES — THIS IS YOUR LIFE!

The figure pushed the window open, brandishing a heavy square object that he pulled from his coat. Holmes turned to face him gasped checked the letter \"Oh no! What I read was true!\" he cried. The figure gave an evil-sounding laugh and said, \"Yes! It was true! Tonight, super-detective Sherlock Holmes, This Is Your Life!\" This winning entry from Gareth Randall of Essex was just one of several using Eamonn Andrews as the theme in the Sherlock Holmes competition. Other entries which made the judge's eyes widen in amazement were from Mr R M Stewart, Edinburgh, Carmen Molner from London, Joshua Dubin and Asdis Bergtharsdottir from Iceland. And finally the last offering to be chosen was from Robin Morley of Nottingham Holmes exclaimed, \"Well I never --a microdrive order form! That wraps up the mystery of the missing microdrives!\" Holmes threw himself to the floor as lan Logan dived into the room, snatched the form with a cackle, and leapt out!

The ATMOS has taken a remarkable step forward in home computer technology. But how? Most Micros 'waste' a large amount of memory on operating functions like graphics, colour and sound.

So the colour capability (8 graphics, 8 background), powerful sound synthesis and high resolution graphics of the ATMOS are achieved with fewer demands on computing power than its competitors. So what else makes the ATMOS so exciting? There's now a typewriter-style full response keyboard; it's directly compatible with most domestic cassette players; and there's a wide choice of software. The ATMOS is designed for convienience, too it uses extended Microsoft BASIC: your printer plugs in without an RS232; and it comes complete with leads and everything you need to get going.

"GAME O Softboxe R-E-V-L-E-W.S. SKI-ING IN THE PYRAMIDS? MUTANT CAMELS It's not often that C&VG praises the people behind the games we review. In this case, I can't help but mention Jeff Minter's refreshing originality, his extraordinary imagination and obvious and abundant programming skills which have produced the best Commodore 64 game to date, The Revenge of the Mutant Camels. Revenge of the Mutant Camels is a follow up to Llamasoft's Attack of the Mutant Camels, but the rôles have been reversed and you have now become a laser-spitting camel who must fight through an incredible 42 different attack waves. The game is played against a scrolling backdrop of Egyptian pyramids and ultra modern cities. The camel can spit laser fire in any of eight directions, kneel down, or jump in the most ungainly fashion I have ever seen. It would be totally impossible to describe every detail or idea contained in this game, but I'll give you a brief summary. Among the 42 levels are skiing kangaroos, teapots, winking pyramids, exploding sheep and baby camels not to mention FALCON PATROL DIABLO REDYRBN90 S'R+394a_NEXT ZONE aa kn DEMON ATTACK MUTANT CAMELS PENYEBN9N 4898258_NEXT 20NE BO KM PI-EYED Come e RIVER RAID MUTANT CAMELS 40 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"martechames ...a spectacular range of software BLASTERMIND SPECTRUM 48k .95 At first glance this might seem to be just another version of a very popular game. How wrong can you be!!! True, the start is simple enough. The Spectrum picks a code of numbers or colours with a selection of levels of difficulty -and invites you to do the same. You then take it in turns to guess each others code from the clue supplied after each guess. An extremely well written, fast and very clearly displayed game, with almost inevitable defeat. This was exactly as intended but unfortunately something went wrong. During the programming strange uncomplimentary messages began to appear on the screen. At first they were so few they were not taken too seriously, but soon they could no longer be ignored. Somehow the Spectrum had been given a personality a rather devious, supercilious, dislikeable, hateful, horrible mind * Side B contains a version of the game compatible with the * excellent Currah Speech unit even worse!! THE QUEST OF MERRAVID VIC 20 (16k) .95 or Commodore 64 .95 A really challenging and enjoyable adventure, written by a confirmed adventure addict who grew tired of the ease with which he solved other adventures himself. Will accept and act on sentences containing up to nine words The adventurer becomes Merravid, charged with the task of finding, taking and then returning the magic Firestone of the Dwarves However, overcoming the many novel and original hazards is no easy matter. Careful and imaginative thought is required if progress is to be made and the Firestone tracked down to the lair of the Dragon of Thargon. Even then the Dragon has to be defeated and the stone retrieved.

The harrier takes-off from an aircraft-carrier and flys over seaborne defenses to attack enemy installations on a nearby island. The harrier may fly faster, slower, higher or lower, and has bombs and cannon fire with which to protect itself and make its own attack. If it flies too high it is detected by enemy jet-fighters (which it may counter-attack) So it needs to hug the mountainous terrain which also varies with every new game. But the island is heavily defended by antiaircraft rockets and tanks, which again the harrier may counter-attack or try to fly through. A tally is kept of fuel, speed, altitude, ammunition, plus player score and high score. Finally the harrier must make its bomb-run over the enemy base before returning past more hostile shipping to its own carrier Pure machine code with super cartoon graphics. You are in control of a diver who must swim down through jellyfish, sharks, barracuda and a host of other under-sea nasties to locate the entrance of a submarine cave. He must then follow its twisting and branching passages which change with every new game, to locate the magical giant oysters with their fabulous treasure of enormous pearls Many of the passages lead to dead-ends, while some are filled with horrible underwater monsters. Each dive has to be timed carefully so that there is enough oxygen left for the return journey, which is further frustrated by the diver's boat shifting anchor and threatening to decapitate him with its propellor.

"VIDEO WHICH STICK? WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF OUR JOYSTICK SURVEY A computer without a joystick is like a canoe without a paddle. No self respecting games player would want to be without a decent stick for his machine. Opinions vary as to the best stick and video games players are like seasoned tennis pro's, when it comes to choosing their favourite. At C&VG over the last few weeks we've tested just about every stick on the market to bring you this comprehensive guide to the best sticks around. We have tested the sticks for responsiveness, ease of grip and fire, robust construction of casing, attractiveness, and value for money. 1 ARCADE PROFESSIONAL The Arcade Professional has a real arcade look and feel to it. Based on the controllers from an actual arcade game, the Professional comes in a shiny black metal case. It sits on a hard surface or on your lap with a foam base to protect your parents' best coffee table. Just like an arcade machine there are two fire buttons — useful in games like Scramble where you have to bomb as well as fire. The Arcade Pro is as responsive as any of the other sticks we tested. The fire buttons are true arcade style alien blasters as large as five pence pieces and dish shaped to avoid \"fingerslip\" — that dreaded affliction known to all vid kids! The Arcade Professional can be opened up to alter the stick's movement four directions for maze games and eight directions for shoot-'em-ups. THE VERDICT Robust stick which can actually be repaired unlike some of the plastic throw-away sticks on sale. This advantage, however, makes the Arcade Pro dearer at .50. Nice design will make your friends go green with envy! 2 QUICKSHOT The Quickshot range of joysticks are the slickest, most futuristic sticks on offer. The original Quickshot stick with its long helicopter-style grip keys makes it easy to hold. Rubber suction pads on the base of the stick also make it easier to use — particularly with maze games where you can benefit from the stick being firmly secured to a solid base. Two fire buttons — one at the top of the shaft for thumb firing and another at the base of the stick for you to choose your most comfortable fire position. THE VERDICT Good sturdy construction and comfortable grip. The stick scores best on shoot-'em-up type games where the shaft-mounted button is a real bonus The bulkiness of the shaft makes the playing of maze games a little more difficult. One of the better sticks — retailing at .95. Compatible with Atari 400, 800, 600XL and VCS — will also work with Spectrum through the Sinclair interface. QUICKSHOT || Spectravideo's Quickshot Il must be one of the best arcade-style sticks around for video gamesters. Its solid design promises hours of trouble free playing. And you can use it with the Atari VCS, or Atari home computers, the Vic-20, CBM 64 and many others. The Quickshot II has a number of interesting features. Starting from the top of the aircraft style stick grip, you'll find the primary shooting button for those games players who like to blast away using their VIDEO COMMAND 48 "


"THE VERDICT Wico sticks are generally regarded as the \"Rolls-Royce\" of video game controllers. If you can afford to fork out .95, you'll get no finer stick than the Red Ball the Extended Lever and Boss are also excellent sticks at a slightly more affordable price. paano thumbs. Below this is a trigger style fire button which lets those weary thumbs take a rest! Spectravideo say that the moulded stick grip is \"ultra-ergonomic\" and who are we to contradict them. Suffice it to say that the stick is comfortable even after an extended session of River Raid! The base of the stick is very sturdy and has a neat little innovation built in an Auto-Fire switch. This allows you to unleash a continuous stream of bullets by simply locking the shooting mechanism. To make the stick stable, there are four powerful suction cups on the bottom of the base — this allows you to play onehanded. And the stick won't come unstuck even during the most exciting space battle! The Quickshot II is available from Spectravideo stockists and costs .95. TRAK BALL Trak Ball controllers introduce a new specialist element to video-gaming. Like a professional golfer carefully selecting a certain iron to match the conditions of the green, so a true video games superstar will reach for a Trak Ball to play in certain games such as Centipede, or Missile Command. The Trak Ball offers precision control in games where you need to move your character all over the screen as quickly and accurately as possible. It is a sleek black box with triangular-shaped \"fire buttons\" in both top right and left hand corners. Trak Ball-style controllers were first used in arcade games, but are now also available for home use and the latest version is Atari's controller for the VCS, 400 and 800. THE VERDICT I tested the Trak Ball on Centipede and Missile Command and found that it added the real feel of the arcade to these games. Something of a luxury add-on — but if you really take your gaming seriously, the Trak Ball is a must at .99 THE VERDICT A winner from top to toe. The C&VG joystick jury voted the Quickshot Il the best stick to come into the office for same time. LE STICK Another baseless stick is Datasoft's mercury-controlled Le Stick. What's really unique about Le Stick is that to move an object on screen you simply point the stick in the direction in which you wish the object to move. Mercury inside the stick makes the connections to make the objects move. THE VERDICT A nice idea but one that doesn't come offand we cannot recommend Le Stick. Priced at .95. VIDEO COMMAND Video Command is a baseless stick with a control grip secured to the top of the shaft. The fire button is mounted half way down the shaft so that you fire with the same hand as you hold the stick. The stick is good on shoot-'em-ups, but the lack of a firm base makes it difficult to handle the tight cornering required in maze games. Manufactured by Imagic the makers of the Imagic range of video games the stick is in the shops at .99. THE VERDICT Design of the stick means that it is extremely lightweight and easy to use. Fire response was adequate. The only drawback is that the short knob controller may make the stick difficult to use in games where a large amount of manoeuvring is required. TAC II TAC stands for totally accurate controller. The stick's extra responsiveness is due to a set of mini sensors built on to the shaft of the stick itself. The TAC's construction is amongst the most robust of the sticks we tested. On maze games, the joystick performed excellently. It also proved to be a good alien stomper. THE VERDICT This is my work-a-day stick. The one reach for first when I sit down to review a game for C&VG. Its no-nonsense design with two large well positioned fire buttons makes the TAC II a joy to use. Available from Sumcom of Manchester at .95. RED BALL America's favourite deluxe controller (or, as they call them in the US, \"gourmet stick\"!) is the Wico range of sticks. It's easy to see why these sticks have been such a success across the water. They are sturdy, responsive, and built to last. The top of the Wico range is the Red Ball controller at .95. This is one of the most responsive sticks we tested with a steel shaft, and fire buttons mounted on the base and the ball at the top of the shaft. Slightly cheaper than the Red Ball is the Wico Extended Lever stick. This has an extremely long control shaft, though unlike the Red Ball it only has a fire button on the base. The cheapest of the Wico sticks is the .00 Boss. It has a moulded grip which makes it comfortable to use. A well sprung fire button is mounted at the top of the shaft. STARFIGHTER Suncom's Starfighter is described by its makers as the ultimate joystick. Short and stubby and difficult to get a good grip on, I did not find the Starfighter very easy to use. Although the stick was reasonably responsive, I found the shaft a little stiff. THE VERDICT I was not happy with the fire button it was sluggish and let too many nasty aliens slip through the net for my liking. Starfighter is a little overpriced at .95. ATARI 7 "

Yet a menace just as perilous threatens the world the sinister Professor Schweinstein and his terrifying Mandroid! After many years of secret research, Schweinstein recently succeeded in creating what could be the ultimate weapon, a device he called the Mindbomb. When detonated, the Mindbomb causes no physical damage instead it simply wipes clean the memories of any human being within ten miles of the explosion. The device is so powerful that even when it is just sitting around doing nothing, it can cause random outbreaks of amnesia for many miles around. Schweinstein has also perfected a superb method of delivering his weapon to the required target the Mandroid. In reality an android, this machine so closely resembles a man that it is virtually impossible to detect, especially in a large city. With the Mindbomb concealed in the Mandroid, Schweinstein imagined he could control the world! However, just as he had completed the Mandroid and Mindbomb, disaster struck. An accident occurred in his laboratory and Schweinstein forgot his plans for world domination. In fact he forgot everything he'd ever known! He forgot all about the Mandroid and the Mindbomb. He forgot where he had hidden the Mindbomb's remote firing button. He forgot where he had planted the Mandroid's homing beacon. He forgot about the two blackmail letters he had sent to the British and Soviet governments. He even forgot about his two hollow teeth one of which contained the antidote to the amnesia and the other which concealed a micro-disc (another of his inventions) which detailed the entire history of his researches!

They know where the Mandroid is at least they know which city it is in at any one time by simply asking local hospital staff how many cases of amnesia they have admitted on any one day. Beyond knowing where the Mandroid is, they can go no further in tracking the thing down and must let it wander the cities of Europe until they can bring it under control. Schweinstein himself is equally elusive. He is a broken man roaming the urban wilderness in search of his lost identity. Whichever side finds him first and contrives to spirit him back to their HQ will have pulled off a tremendous intelligence coup. Meanwhile the deadly Mandroid is also wandering across Europe and both M16 and the KGB must stop the other side gaining control of the homing beacon and firing button. With these two devices it would be possible to wipe out the opposition's intelligence network. While the Mandroid is on the loose, London and Moscow are in danger of losing their minds! Can YOU prevent disaster by finding Schweinstein, the Mandroid and the Mindbomb? How do you go about it?

In the listing these have been left in letter form so you can identify the right key to press more easily All the strings in the following lines contain graphics mode characters and not alphabetic characters. (To enter these lines, change to a \"G\" cursor by pressing caps shift/9 before typing the letters, and then return to a normal cursor with caps shift/9 again to finish typing the line. RJS) The lines are: 100-140, 510, 525, 2310-2325, 2380-2381. There is not space here to describe in detail how the program works but a study of the listing should reveal most of its mechanisms. When you run the program there's a long delay while the computer calculates Z$ (city, city). This array stores the shortest distance between any two cities. If you want to eliminate this delay, do a dummy run and then save Z$) as an array to tape. Then replace lines 2800-2880 with a statement to load Z$().

"MICRODRIVE COMPATIBLE ONLY 26-95 +pp PROGRAMMABLE JOYSTICK INTERFACE Spectrum or ZX81 for PACKAGE CONTENTS SUPPLIED  Programmable Interface Module as illustrated, complete with clip-on programming leads. Self adhesive programming chart detailing how to define which key is simulated by UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and FIRE. ACF SEBENE One pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards for at-a-glance setting to your games requirements. AGF PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE Recognised as the only true Hardware Programmed joystick interface this product offers all the features associated with such a design. You can use any Atari-compatible joystick controller with any software for your Sinelair Spectrum or ZX81, not just those with a joystick option, Movement of the joystick is recognised by the computer exactly the same as pressing the appropriate control keys, and can therefore give the most immediate response to that movement. The hardware programmed design works with all possible key-reading methods, both BASIC and Machine Code. Eight directional movement, with or without the fire button being pressed, can be achieved by only programming the left, right, up, down and fire keys required by the game. Programming is achieved by a two-digit code, which is looked up on the Programming Chart supplied, for each direction and firing button. These two numbers are then selected on a pair of leads which are clipped onto appropriately numbered strips on the interface. Once configured this can be marked onto a Quick Reference Programming Card for storing with the game. As the programming is not power dependent the interface can be immediately used when next switched on. The keyboard remains fully functional and can be used simultaneously with the joy. stick. An integral rear expansion connector means there is no need to remove the interface to connect other peripherals. NB. A recent design improvement now means that the AGF Programmable Interface works with the new Quickshot II rapid \"Auto Fire\" feature.  12 months guarantee and full written instructions.

"cantor you DOOMSDA CASTLE is an arcade style game with the feel SOFTWARE of a real adventure Doomsday Castle consists of a labyrinth of 76 complexly inter-connected Halls and Passages where you will meet a whole host of adversaries serving the infinitely evil Scarthax, the Garthrogs, the Orphacs, the phenomenally nasty Googly Bird and the Urks which manifest themselves in over fifty unbelievably weird and wonderful quises. Scarthax has scoured the Universe to bring together the six ancient stones of lifeforce.United in Doomsday Castle they are being used to wield an irresistable power over the cosmos, emanating waves of corruption through every galaxy. To save the Universe, you must battle your way through the Castle to find and collect the six stones and use their force against Scarthax to destroy Doomsday Castle, hopefully escaping yourself before the final cataclysmic explosion. The task is not easy (saving the Universe never is!) and it will take youmany games to unfold the structure of Doomsday Castle and discover the locations of the ancient stones. The addictive arcade style action will keep you coming back to play but the overall challenge should still keep you occupied for months. You take on the role of our super hero ZIGGY shown here above in his exploratory capsule in combat with an Urk disguised as a pangalactic gargleblaster (!!)

"The siege has been on for weeks. The invading troops have surrounded your castle fortress and are waiting for you and the rest of the inhabitants to surrender or die of hunger. The conflict has suddenly taken a turn for the worse. The frustrated troops are tired of waiting for the surrender and have attacked the fortress! Men are now swarming around the towers and battlements you are guarding, and have started clambering up the walls. You'll have to act fast to save your beleaguered people from being slaughtered to death in their beds. The only option open to you is to knock the invading soldiers down the outer wall by dropping rocks on their heads. More and more reinforcements are called and your task becomes a frantic race against time. Can you save the medieval castle from the marauders or will you be overcome and allow the fortress to be ransacked?

Will you be able to discover the map which tells you the secret of the hidden exit? Or will you be too greedy and go for the gold strewn around the maze and be trapped forever when the hidden exit closes? Well, get typing and find out you'll never know if you just sit there! Full instructions can be found in the program, but here are a few notes which might help you get more out of the game. The data for the maze can be found at the end of the program in four large arrays. You could create your own mind-boggling maze by playing around with the program using the following code. =wall, 1-path, 2=right hand turn, 3=left hand turn, 4=right hand turn with dead end, 5-left hand turn with dead end, 6-crossroads, 7=T-junction, 8=doorway, 9=dead end. The location of the map can be changed in line 3010 to make your game harder or easier. At the moment you'll find the map at location 11,7. 108 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES Illustration: Terry Rogers. "

"LL LISPECTUL Fortune seekers can strike it rich with the return of the Californian gold rush. Can you be the first gold prospector to reach the fabled pot of gold? You'll have to be tough to survive in the deserted mine workings. The ladders are old and rotten and if you lose your footing, the acid pools at the bottom of the shaft are just waiting to swallow you up. The only way to reach the hidden gold is via the treacherous old conveyor belts which through years of disuse have become riddled with holes. Your only chance to reach your waiting fortune is to run over the platforms and jump the moving holes. Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime, and don't forget to bring your shovel!

"complete revolution of the disc as it passes beneath the laser beam which reads the disc. Each side of one of these discs can store up to 54,000 individual pictures on the tracks. Discs used in arcade machines are one-sided unlike discs for domestic players and have an aluminium backing plate to prevent warping. The actual laser in the machines is a helium-neon design and produces a narrow beam of red light which reads the disc and after passing through a complex optical process is converted into electrical signals which are then processed by electrical circuits in the machine. Rumours abound about the new laser games about to hit the arcades a science fiction special effects company in the States are apparently working on a special 3D process for forthcoming discs. Victor Penman, the man who watched over the creation of Dragon's Lair reckons that the next generation of games will involve other sensesenhanced by the laser animations. So maybe in a couple of years you'll be able to smell those evil aliens coming at you across the stars and feel the icy grip of their tentacles! Maybe programmers will have to learn to use film cameras or become animation experts instead of simply brushing up on their computer language! The laser disc will open up whole new possibilities for those of you who enjoy playing interactive games Dungeons and Dragons with amazing 3D animated monsters and weird land scapes; Adventure games with real life locations filmed on disc. The possibilities seem endless. It seems that simple computer-generated graphics could soon be a thing of the past. Multi-screen games with incredible graphics and the facility for several players to take part at once are glimmering on the games horizon not just in the arcades either! Believe us, the laser disc is going to revolutionise games playing at home and in the arcade in the months to come. Dragon's Lair is just the beginning of what looks like becoming a major new section of the games industry. The future certainly looks exciting! tomer keeps putting the money in. Nothing worries an arcade owner more than watching players monopolise a machine for a whole evening on just 20p to prove to their friends that they can reach six-digit scores! Another advantage stemming from the Prestel-style systems is that daily average scores could be collated via the telephone lines, so the programmer or software company could see just how much they need to adjust the program to ensure that the games player finds it continually challenging and the programmer doesn't lose money! There are two additional twists in the laser disc tale that make the future even more exciting. The first is that Sony have succeeded in developing a laser system that can record as well as play back. At ,000 it's probably slightly out of your price range at present and it won't be appearing in arcades for a while yet. But give it time. All things electronic get simpler and cheaper. The second twist is the development of cable TV. With this it would be possible to record the visual part of your game overnight from your cable service and then load the computer software from Prestel. The following moming you'll wake up to a brand new video game with the most unbelievable graphics. Because the system is amazingly interactive, we can imagine a version of C&VGs Seventh Empire available on Prestel and cable where you could see Kenneth Kendall giving an up-to-date news report on the current state of the Empire day by day and you'd be playing 1,000s of other gamers. The laser disc has already revolutionised the arcade game where computer graphics are rapidly becoming a thing of the past despite the considerable cost of the new laser machines. And Coleco Vision, the home video games people, have announced a deal with the company who brought out one of the first laser arcade games Dragon's Lair. Coleco are apparently working on a laser disc attachment for their video game system and Dragon's Lair will be the first game on it. Laser disc software manufacturers are already considering selling discs for home use, so you could get arcade style games to run on your specially adapted computer or home video centre! The video disc player is a complex bit of machinery. It incorporates precision optics, a microprocessor system and laser technology to read information from the disc as it spins at 1,800 revolutions per minute. The disc itself is plastic coated metallized material and, like an audio disc, is encoded with information in the form of a series of bumps and pits within a spiral track.

"wion For the 48K Spectrum By lan Beynon After an attack by the Dark Horde 100 of your Beta Class androids were kidnapped Your mission is to rescue the androids from the maze of underground passages beneath the palace of Nedab, leader of the Horde. The 25 caverns are layed out in a 5 x 5 grid. Starting from the central cavern, you must journey through them all collecting your androids (4 in each cavern). Nedab, knowing of your mission has put his green Zygon guards on patrol Although these creatures only wander around aimlessly, they prove lethal on contact. Your Orion buggy is equipped with WX1To force screens which, when activated, enable you to destroy the Zygons. The white Renlim will also prove to be a hazard. These can be ran over for extra points, but then your scanners will be disabled until another android is rescued. Good luck, and watch out for the purple Power Guzzlers.

"It's the year 2243 and the Earth's foremost sporting event is ready to begin. The gladiator's arena is filled with an audience screaming for blood. You are to challenge the planet's champion gladiator in a fight to the death. Things have changed dramatically from the ancient Roman sporting battles. Swords and javelins are a thing of the past; laser bikes and guns are now the instruments of death. To defeat the champion, you must trap him within a wall of laser fire by moving your bike around the arena until your opponent runs out of room and crashes into one of the laser trails. The game can be played by one or two players using the keyboard or with joysticks. It also has a hall of fame hi-score table displayed throughout the game for you to check on your progress.

"FEB'S FOUL-UPS If you can't fit all the data on line 20, put half of it on 20 and then start again on 25 with 25 DATA more numbers... Then save the program, but remove lines 10 to 30 first. DEMOLITION SPECTRUM Two mistakes cropped up in February's issue. The first program to come under the bugs' attack was Briky for the Atari 400. Mal and his team have devised a new tactic. Instead of removing parts of the program, they've printed two of each line! When entering the program, just type in the listing up to line 30120 and miss out the rest. Bug number two appeared in Front Gunner for the Electron. We missed out the last part of the program. But I've managed to persuade Screaming Foul Up to give it back. So if you'd like a correct listing, just send me an SAE. character is printed when you press graphics \"F\", then you just change all the G's to a graphic 'Fwhere they should be fireballs. Remember that to put these characters in the listing, you should be in graphics mode so type the line as normal, then when you get to the character, get into graphics mode to type it, press caps shift 9 to return to an L cursor, and finish off the line. MORE ON THE YEARBOOK Some of you may have had problems with the graphics in Demolition If you come across such a Spectrum listing, what you do is this. Type the program in as normal. When you come PROFESSIONAL BUGS. Remember the problem with Valhalla? It seems that trying to perform certain actions like throwing the axe when the program isn't expecting it will produce an error message and return you to Basic. From there, just type LIST and you'll see most of the program! Oops! I've found a few more lines which were left out of the Atari version of Pirates and Polyps from the 1984 Yearbook. Line 370 should be... 370 ?,\" \"Pirates\":?:?\" polyps\":? :? \"If the projector has locked onto a\" while 410 is also missing and should read... 410? \"enjoy the game. Press any key\":GET#1,A:?\"*\":POKE710,N:POKE 16,64:POKE 53774,64 You'll also need... 280 ? :? ,.\"\":?\" Laser Scanner\" 290 ?\" Base /\":?.?.?,\" Press any key\":GET#1.A:?\",\" 1100 Q=1:IF K=2 THEN H = INT(RND(N)* 24+ 13):GOTO 1130 The game should now run better, with a pause after the first sheet of instructions. By the way, line 1055 can be removed. THOSE ATARI LISTINGS ZX81 BLOCKADE I still get letters and phone calls (01-278 3881) from Atari owners saying that they can't get Pirates & Polyps and Interstellar Intrigue to work I am as sure as I can be that the programs do work, but for all who have asked, here is a fuller explanation of how to put the machine code characters in lines such as 830 of Interstellar Intrigue on page 29. Taking this line as an example, you have to enter line 830 as printed on the Space Blockade from January's issue lost a byte at the end of the machine code loading program. When you've finished typing the machine code as directed, the program will not end. To finish it, type in an 'S'. as an example, you winite to me at Bug Hunter, et. Where it says \"pue Computer and Video Games, here\". you have to put the wront House, 8 Herbal Hill, ven in the yearbook. To do London, ECIR 5EJ. Or phone me on 01-278.3881. characters corresponding to the list of this... UNBREAKABLE SPECTRUM BROKEN 1) Type in as much of the program as you can, and then add the following lines. 10 for J=1 to 11: READ A: PRINT CHR$(A)NEXT 20 DATA 104,162,6,169... 30 STOP 2) Run the program. It will stop at line 30 and you'll have the characters printed on the screen. Now you need to get them into a program line, so 3) Simply use the cursor keys (the 4 arrows) to put the other characters from the sheet in the right place. Eg., the line number, LET etc. 4) Press return to enter the line into the listing When you've done this, you should have line 830 correct. Now change lines 10 and 20 to put in the other lines. You'll need to change the DATA and also the 11 in line 10. to a graphic character, replace it with a capital G (for Graphic). When you've finished, save the listing on tape to be safe, and then RUN it. Obviously it won't work, you'll just get a load of Gs printed. So, break in with the Break key. Now get into graphics mode by pressing caps shift/9 to get a 'G' cursor. First, press REM, then press the capital letters from A to U in order. If any of those letters are used in the listing as graphics they'll be printed as graphic characters. Watch as they appear on the screen. Then it's simply a matter of replacing all those Gs with the correct character. For example if, in Demolition, a fireball I've had a couple of letters from people saying that the line zero copyright message for the Spectrum which appeared in Bug Hunter didn't work. The correct version should be POKE (PEEK 23635+256* PEEK 23636 + 1), O and you should now be able to add a non-removable line 0 to the top of your Spectrum Basic programs. AND FINALLY... ... for this month, an apology to Texas owners. The 3D Maze program in the Yearbook, although it works perfectly, will not run without an Extended Basic cartridge. Sorry for not making that clear. BY ROBERT SCHIFREEN COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 141 "


"skool so you so want to be accounts YAHUI Bug hunting is a dangerous business — you never know when Screaming Foul-Up is going to sneak up behind you with a heavy Error Message clutched in his claws. But if you think you are up to it, C&VG's resident Bug Hunter, Robert Schifreen, has come up with a few hints and tips which could help you become a trainee Bug Basher. And they could save you the cost of a phone call to our Bug line! However, if all else fails, then either drop me a line at the magazine or call me on 01-278 3881. Occasionally, we have to admit, an error creeps into one of our listings. More often, we find that the person typing the listing has made a small typing error. Easy enough to do! Next time you have problems with one of our games, try out some of the suggestions below before phoning Bug Hunter. If the computer prints an error message when you type RUN it could be a very small typing error. Even mistaking a comma for a full stop could alter the way in which a program runs, So next time the computer rejects an afternoon's hard typing and prints one of those rude messages, check it with the list below. You never know, it could be just the solution. SYNTAX ERROR This is the most common error message. It means that the program line is not recognised by the computer as being \"RUN\"able. This may be because you have left out a character eg a bracket, or spelt a word wrongly eg. IPNUT instead of INPUT. Many syntax errors are quite hard to spot as one very small mistake can cause a whole line to be rejected. Check especially the commas, colons and semi colons. NEXT WITHOUT FOR A FOR-NEXT loop is a special part of a Basic program. There must be a FOR statement, then part of the program and then a NEXT statement. If the program comes across a NEXT but has not been through the matching FOR then you'll get this error. As well as incorrect typing of the FOR and NEXT lines, it could be that your GOTOs and/or GOSUBs are wrong. This might make the program jump to a NEXT without going through the FOR first. VARIABLE NOT FOUND On some computers, all variables are set to zero when you type RUN. On others, though, they are not given a value until you give them one. So if you set the value of X to 10 and then, further down the program, make a typing mistake and call it y, you'll get this error urdess Y also has a value. Both systems have advantages. If your program uses a lot of variables, it's annoying to have to set them all to zero. It does cut down on typing errors, though. BAD MODE This error is found on BBC micros and is similar to Out of Memory. It can mean that there is not enough memory for the selected mode. Each of the graphics modes on the BBC takes up a different amount of the computer's memory. This means that the size of the largest program which you can write depends on which graphic mode you use. OUT OF MEMORY Quite self explanatory, really. It means that you haven't got any memory left. This usually means that a program is too large to fit in the machine and that you've run out of RAM. However, there are some typing errors which will result in this error, especially DIM statements which are used to reserve memory for date. If your DIM is too large then you'll find yourself running out of memory. The computer stores a number in memory which tells it how much RAM it has left. If you change this number by poking into it inadvertently, then you'll get the impression that you have less (or even more!) RAM left than you should have. "


"RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB Similar to NEXT WITHOUT FOR. This is a pair of statements which must occur in order. If the computer reaches a RETURN but has not encountered a GOSUB on the way then you'll get this error. OUT OF DATA This is one of the most common errors. In many Basic programs you'll find lines with the word DATA at the beginning. These contain numbers or letters which the program needs to be able to run, and are read into the program with a READ statement. Each time there is a READ, it will get the next item from the DATA line. But, if there is a READ but no more DATA left to be read, you'll get this error. If this happens, check the DATA lines to make sure that they are typed correctly. Each item of DATA is separated by a comma so if you miss one of these out you will merge two DATA items into one. This means that although the DATA is all there, it will appear one short to the computer. CAN'T CONTINUE When you interrupt a program with BREAK or ESCAPE you can usually restart it by typing CONTinue. But there are some occasions where you can't continue. For example, if you alter the program in any way then the machine's memory will be rearranged to fit it in. Therefore all previous data is lost and you can't continue running the old program. If you are going to type something before continuing, eg printing the value of a variable, make sure that you type accurately as you can't continue after a SYNTAX ERROR. DIVISION BY ZERO In maths it is impossible to divide any number by zero. So if you try to do so in your program you'll get this error. It may be that you've typed the name of the variable wrongly. If your machine sets all variables to zero at the start and you type a variable name that has not been used in the program it will have a value of zero. If you then try to divide by this variable, you'll get this error. TYPE MISMATCH You have referenced two types of variables in the program line and they are of different types. String variables have a dollar sign after them while numeric ones do not. It may be that you're trying to store a letter or word in a numeric variable. BAD SUBSCRIPT An array has been dimensioned with a DIM statement but you are trying to access a part of the array which does not exist. For example, the line DIM A (100) will give array A 100 elements. If you then try to PRINT A(103) you'll get bad SUBSCRIPT. (The number in the brackets is known as a subscript). If you get this error, check any lines which deal with arrays, especially the DIM statements. REDIMENSIONED ARRAY Once you have set up an array with a DIM statement, you cannot set it up again without clearing it first, or typing RUN which does the same thing. If you get this error when typing a program from a magazine then check especially for typing errors in DIM statements. Check all your GOTO and GOSUB statements as well, as a typing error may be making the program jump back to a DIM. This error message may also be called a DD error, which stands for Double Dimension. (No jokes about it working wonders, please). ILLEGAL DIRECT There are two ways to type in a Basic statement. Either with a line number as part of a program or without one, known as immediate mode. There are commands, though, which can't be entered in immediate (or direct) mode but only as part of a program. An example is the INPUT command. If you try typing a command in immediate mode which can only be used in a program then you'll get this error. Try typing INPUT A on your computer and you'll see what I mean. STRING TOO LONG The program is trying to create a string which is longer than Basic allows. This is no problem on a Spec. trum, as there is no limit to the length of a string. On other micros, though, strings usually have a limit of 255 characters. Trying to add characters on to the end of a string without clearing it first will often produce this error. In standard Basic (but not on the Spectrum) the same goes for elements of string arrays. On the Spectrum you cannot have true string arrays. UNDEFINED LINE A GOTO or GOSUB statement points to a line of the program which does not exist. On some computers, the Spectrum for example, if a line does not exist, the program will jump to the next available line without producing an error. REDO FROM START Not exactly an error message, this, but it will happen if you A try to enter a string 6 from the keyboard when the program is expecting a number. If the program asks for a number and your input contains any characters apart from the numbers 0 to 9 you'll get this message. "

Each was attracted by a special feature of a machine watertight, 32-bit, own power, tele. pathic, makes the tea. The readout tells us: 1. No form of liquid was mentioned in the advertising of Bill's computer, nor of the one bought by Bilkins. 2. The lady called Thomson bought her computer from stand 3. The other lady did not make her purchase from an adjacent stand. 3. Joe did not buy from an odd numbered stand. The watertight computer was not on stand 2. 4. Mr North bought from an end stand. 5. Alice's computer produces its own power. The telepathic computer was displayed on stand 4 and the machine on stand I was not bought by Williams. 6.

Williams North Smith Thomson Watertight Telepathic 32-bit Own power Makes tea Feature Surname First name Stand FALSE ARREST At least in their latest job Sluffy's gang slightly improved on their previous effort. Then they had backed their van through the window of Todd's Videos before they read the notice fixed to the door which informed visitors that Todd's had moved to the High St. This time the gang's driver did manage to reverse into a thriving computer shop but, in going too far, wrecked most of the main display. As the startled owner just watched, one of the gang ransacked the shelves and passed what he fancied to another who loaded it into the back of the vehicle. It was a pity, too, that they had prearranged the signal to leave by means of a bang on the van's roof, for when a collapsing shelf hit the van the driver roared off leaving his two companions staring in wild disbelief through the smashed frontage. When invited later to visit their local police station and engage in frank, round the table discussions, the gang knew that they could not deny the robbery but hoped, if they could confuse the law as to who took which part, to throw some doubt in the minds of the jurors and so lessen their sentence. They had agreed that their poorest liar would tell the truth all the time and when questioned he made two true statements. One of the others told one truth and one lie and the third member told two lies: 'AMMER I DROVE THE VAN BASHER GRABBED THE GOODS BASHER I GRABBED THE STUFF CLOGGER DROVE THE VAN CLOGGER BASHER DROVE THE VAN TLOADED THE STUFF The police weren't confused for long and, hopefully, you won't be either.

If at any time you need to re-enable the break key, just type poke 410,57 RP EDWARDS of Wrexham has sent Program Extra a tip that will give Spectrum owners a little more time. Programmers sometimes require a certain time to test to see if a key has been pressed. This can be achieved by using the statement: LET T=7997-USR7997. The variable T contains the time in fiftieths of a second. The computer will wait for up to two minutes and 40 seconds for a key to be pressed which is very useful for displaying instructions. The user can then decide to read them or press any key to move on to the rest of the program PROGRAM EXTRA EXAS owners will remember our great game Paratrooper in the Jan *84 issue. Mike Waldron of Sheffield has sent C&VG an improved version of the game. The alterations make better use of the TI's graphics and colours and displays a score throughout the game.

"chamar >> > 28 GOING THROUGH THE PILE During the past month I have been playing my way through a pile of recently published Adventure games, and now find I run the risk of courting unpopularity among non-Spectrum owners! But on this occasion, the anti-Spectrum lobby should hold their fire. The trouble is, there are so many Spectrum Adventures around that the poor Spectrum owner deserves some extra help through a veritable minefield of software. And a minefield it is, for the Spectrum games I have played, with one exception, are so weak that if there was ever an Adventure equivalent of \"The Worst of Hollywood\", then many would feature. Spectrum owners are, at the time of writing, unable to set themselves a bench-mark by playing a Scott Adams game, so it is only right that the worst as well as the best should be mentioned. Which leads to an interesting thought! Perhaps a new method of rating Adventure games could be points in a range of one to ten on the Scott scale. A universal measure of Adventure quality \"This game rates 3.25 Scotts\" would, perhaps, speak for itself! In that case, a number of Spectrum games listed here wouldn't merit more than a handful of Scotts between them! QUITE A guarded by a mummy, centaur, dragon or knight. You must collect, in all, 40 units of treasure to complete the quest. The game is played in real time, and the maximum playing time is one hour (Oh happy reviewer!) Each game starts off with a new network of caves. Commands are entered as single letters, and the permissible options are displayed at all times. For example, if you type 'm' for move, then your next options might bel. r, u, d, s, meaning left, right, up, down and secret passage. Unfortunately, this very good game is let down by its lack of instructions to the user. The cassette inlay gives some instructions, true, but they in no way make it clear exactly how to use and manipulate things, nor how to use or interpret the cave map inset to the bottom right of the display. This can be easily overcome, of course produce an instruction booklet quick, Doric! The Oracle Cave is from Doric for 48k Spectrum, and costs a modest .95. CENTRE DUNGEON The instructions of Middle Kingdom load separately up to 26 hex, and are extremely complicated, occupying an incredible ll screens. They are also written in an extremely bad style, with poor grammar and spelling. If you can remember them after the main program has replaced them in memory, you are probably the type that can quote the complete works of Shakespeare. The main part of the game is reminiscent of Dunjonquest games but, being on the BBC, is much faster than the TRS-80 Hellfire Warrior, and enlivened with colour and sound. First you choose your character, weapons, and armour and then move around from room to room, doing battle with goblins and the like, using the special function keys to select the type of blow you wish to deal the enemy. Optional speed of messages and skill level is provided as well. Not really my cup of tea, but a very good game of its type. Pity about the instructions — why on earth couldn't they have been committed to paper? Perhaps the mis-spelling and poor grammar would put people off buying the game if seen in advance? Middle Kingdom is from Pro-Software for BBC priced .95. MULTIPLE DODGE SPECTRACLE! Following closely on the heels of Valhalla, but from Doric and relatively unsung, comes The Oracle's Cave, for Spectrum (what with Doric and Oracle, somehow this seems the wrong micro for the game!). Since animated graphics are again the order of the day, comparison is inevitable. In Oracle, the graphics are used in an entirely different way. Your little figure not only moves around, but the location 'pans' with him, so there is no sharp cut-off of one picture to be replaced by another thus movement is smooth and continuous. Response is fast compared with Valhalla, making the game a pleasure to play. At the outset, you may choose one of four quests obtaining a treasure WOsmous ayi ynojui punoy ay uayi 'podsues pue MO||01 quo unis       ay moJy is ise ob nok I'M 'N' Saloj ay up sixa   Aq pu aq  a103 ajiseo ayi jo sapp ayi jo awos quawy asipesed 01 hem ayi uo uoning yonoi shay ay   ns   jes -nas apsino sajnsean aaj 138|103 NIM Arcade versus Adventure is often a theme of readers' letters and, in Dodge City, the two are brought together. First an arcade game must be played up to skill level 12. You ride across the desert collecting mail, pursued by bandits, avoiding cacti and oncoming bullets. As you complete each alternate skill level, you are presented with a clue to the Adventure, and this culminates in the receipt of the password to enter the Adventure section. Into the Adventure itself then, and you find yourself in Dodge City, about to face a murder charge, and all the evidence stacked up against you. You must choose (1) to make a break for it or (2) submit to arrest. You choose (1) and find yourself looking into the guns of the Deputy Sheriff. You must decide (1) to raise you hands and surrender or (2) jump from the balcony... Get the picture? Yes, at last a real multiple choice adventure. It has instant 'wide-screen' graphics and a good sense of humour. It would probably make a good board game, and is certainly to be recommended for wallies wishing to boast of their Adventure prowess. Adventurers leave well alone. And the arcade game? (1) you like it or (2) you don't Y SY A009 SY SI QON Y BY KEITH CAMPBELL 150 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

URBAN BORE Another game for the Spectrum I would not borrow, let alone buy, is Urban Upstart from Richard Shepherd SoftTo cap it all, should you catch pneumonia out on the cold damp streets, an ambulance will take you to a hospital which turns out to be a perspective maze. All this frustration caused me to type nasty words at the game, whereupon I sked off to gaol on an obscenity charge. Non-moving commands are answered fairly promptly, so I tried my hardest to get out, all to no avail. Unfor tunately by then, I had lost faith in the game and decided to pursue it no furthware. Well, forgive me for associating a fantasy game with Adventure, and for assuming there would be a connection between the book and the accompany. ing Spectrum cassette. The book is best described as a multiple choice' Adventure, where, by use of a dice and selecting the next move from a choice of two or three, the player proceeds from paragraph to pa. ragraph, moving on to the paragraph indicated by his selection. This means constant and rapid page-turning, as there are 400 numbered paragraphs, and the result can perhaps be described as an Adventure story read in random order. Not so the software, which, not unreasonably, I anticipated would be a computerised version of the book. It is not. The game is almost identical to Halls of the Things from Crystal ComThe idea is good enough — quite original in fact. You must escape the environs of Scarthorpe, a town so depressed that the unemployed queue up to queue up for a job. The trouble is that the implementation ruins the idea. The top of the screen displays a picture of each location, starting off in your house, and progressing eventually out and around this neglected town. When you are outside a fish and chip shop, neither CHIPPY nor SHOP are recognised, and a bank, pictured and described, goes unrecognised likewise. I didn't bother with Arthur's bookshop. There are plenty of locations and pictures, and if you are hypnotised by watching your Spectrum slowly fill in your screen with blocks of colour, then you'll be in a trance in no time, for there is no 'graphics-off switch, and to move around takes upwards of ten seconds a er.

Well this isn't one of them! Described as a graphical adventure, all outdoor locations are displayed on part of a map pretty redundant stuff since all the necessary descriptions and exits are provided in the text anyway. Ghost Town is written by a teeny bopper with no dictionary, John Pickford. How Virgin Games have the nerve to give such trivia the name of a great, I cannot understand. Perhaps they don't even know there is already a Ghost Town? They should stick to producing records, and leave Adventures to those with some knowledge. Or could it be they are hoping to confuse Spectrum owners? Ghost Town from Virgin Games for 48k Spectrum, a rip-off even at .95. HELPLINE Simon Marsh drops me a reassuring line every now and again, and has come up with the theory that Adventure players are the best computer users kind, friendly, and always helpful! James Bibby has written from Birkenhead offering to help with quick tips, and specifically writes to help Denis Field, stuck in Castle of Riddles. His tips, and those from Gordon Keenan of Glasgow, are printed upside down. Dragon owner Mark Terry of for help Stoke-on-Trent offers W. Pooley in Jerusalem, but has come across an unexpected problem himself. He has all the treasures and has got through the gates, but nothing happens! Phew! I try to keep abreast of new Adventures, yet almost every month I get a desperate plea or two about a game that I have not heard of! Blade of Blackpool is one example, so can anyone help R. Gay from Rogerstone who wants to know if he can get past the landslide or monster, or nearer to the trees that emit an eerie light? Ken and Linda Thompson up in Chesterfield, on the other hand, are stuck with the carnivorous plant, can't find the jewel of Selmarn and are stuck in the quicksand! To make matters worse, they ventured into Wizard and Princess, and are stuck in a room with a crazed toad! Labyrinths of La Coshe is troubling Mark Chaffey in Tunbridge Wells, for he can't get through the passage past the waterfall. Remember Stephen Donoghue and the Ghost Town horse? His claim to completing Strange Odyssey in six days led Brian Pickarance to ask \"Is he a hyper-intelligent Skol-drinking mega-being from a distant planet?\" Poor Brian has been eaten by a slime tree, torn apart by a black hole, and decided that the dia-ice hound must be a Skol drinker, as he won't take the Saurian Brandy! All leading to a score of zero! Well, you're lucky Brian you don't make any mention of a methane snowstorm! It only seems a few weeks ago that I was introducing you to Simon Clarke, who has been helping me with your problems since last September, and was a major contributor to January's Book of Adventure supplement. Well, sadly we must now say goodbye to Simon, who is leaving to start up his own software company, Adventure Zone Ltd. Thanks for all your help, Simon, and the best of luck in your new venture!

"UGH BUG ZAP ZAPQUAK! Vivo Squad SORTER MASTERS OF THE GAME \"UGH. BUG. ZAP ZAP. QUAK.\".... Now, for the first time since late last week, you too can learn this amazing new phrase which is guaranteed to get you the very best new software around. \"Ugh\" has been rated the best-ever game for the Dragon 32 and is now selling like hot pterradactl eggs for the CBM 64. \"Bug Squad\" for the CBM 64 will leave you a little less sane after defending your garden from a host of loony bugs, a manic magnet, a mutant lawn mower and bottles of \"'Essence of Spinach\". Regain very little of your sanity as you zap away with \"Zoids\", our latest best-selling shoot-em-up game for the CBM 64. And finally get yourself locked away for playing \"Quak Attak\" which may or may not come complete with a nice padded jacket. Fly your turkey as you do battle with your laser lance against the Loons of Latvia on their menacing white ducks... And if you own a Spectrum, you'll be amazed at \"Starblitz\", our astounding new 'Truly Arcade Perfect' game for your machine which puts all similar games to shame..... Ugh is .95 for the Dragon 32, .95 for the CBM 64. Zoids, Bug Squad and Quak Attak are just .95 each (CBM 64) and Starblitz is only .95 (Spectrum).
