REVIEWER: STEVE JARRATT. 00001500 G collect a limited supply of bombs and perform acrobatic forward 'flips' in practice, a totally useless activity. The action offered by Desolator isn't the most original or interesting I've ever seen. Progress is slow and the gameplay is marred by niggling faults, such as the fact that Mac can't move and punch at the same time. The incessant hordes of enemies which constantly assail our poor hero also help to make this game a rather short affair. Overall, Desolator is an average game that offers a reasonable amount of entertainment take it or leave it. DR GRAPHICS on wasn't working on I SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY US Gold's Desolator is 00999999 based on the little-known Sega coin-op, Halls of 1500 Kairos (perhaps unknown Sega coin-op' might be a better phrase, for no-one! know has even seen the machine!).

Depending upon the version played there are Crossing a bridge in Desolator. GE TROS UPDATE The Commodore 64 version is colourful and loud, but is let down by its gameplay. It's just far too easy. Another big niggle is the very awkward and clumsy multiload, which disrupts play very badly. The same can be said for the Amstrad version. The Atari ST version has extra features not seen in the 8-bit versions, including extra weapons and a wider range of enemies. The graphics are also far better than the 8-bit versions. Still, there's no getting away from the fact that there are only four levels to battle through, and at  many experienced ST gamers mightn't think that enough to spend their cash on. "

Green, skinny Orc guards maraud about with their swords at the ready, and cave trolls prove hardy foes in combat. There are also scuttling crabs, slithering things and scorpion-like stingers to keep the player on his foes. Finally there's the Dungeon, a maze of doors, pits and highly dangerous creatures.

Love it or hate it, you can't ignore The Sentinel. Now that the Amiga version has been released, practically everyone has the opportunity to try one of the weirdest games ever written. The Amiga version is a bit of a disappointment, in that it doesn't make any significant use of the micro's superior graphics and sound abilities. Turn the sound off and you could well be playing the BBC version. That's not to say that the graphics are poor; indeed, they're quite unlike anything you'll have seen in any other game. Created using fractal techniques, the endless 3-D landscapes of The Sentinel consist of slopes, planes, and strange objects. Using the keyboard or mouse, you can change your viewpoint freely. scrolling the landscape to reveal ever new vistas of strange complexity. Your aim is to defeat the hooded Sentinel of each level by converting objects into pure energy, and using it to transfer yourself to higher levels. To do this you must create new bodies for your Synthoid robot, and move into them. You are first shown an overview of the landscape, showing the Sentinel, its Sentry henchmen, and the details of the topography, You can access an aerial view of the landscape at any time by aiming your viewpoint into the sky and pressing HELP. Around the landscape are dotted crystalline trees. These are your raw energy building blocks. Using the cursor, centre on a tree and press A to absorb it.

It's a promising idea and begins well as the unseen psycho escapes from a house where he's holding the occuptants hostage even though he's surrounded by police. But by the time scowling Tom Berenger has dragged Sidney Poitier, back in action after many years at the Fed, up the mountain, it's climbed the giddy melodramatic heights of True Life Macho Adventures. Nobody would call Woody Allen 'macho' but every so often he feels the need to flex his dramatic muscles. Unluckily September (PG) A Woody Allen's September. finds him in serious mood budget movie. It's messy once more and despite a and at two hours it's twenty packed cast, including minutes too long. But it's Denholm Elliott and Mia also bright and breezy and Farrow, it's as enjoyable as a heartfelt. rainy autumn day. At Mission the students A family gathers in their divide into two groups. The rural house to bitch, fight, hard core blacks are burst into tears about politically aware while the men-friends and the like, against a background of memories as they prepare to sell the place. When Allen gets serious he seems to lose his self-critical facilities. With its mannered dialogue Skool Daze. it may all work better on stage. In such a crowded month we can't mention everything, but a special Michael J. Fox tries once more word for Vice Versa (PG), to escape his squeaky clean image. the tale of a father and boy who magically swop identities. It doesn't open till 29th July, so I'll reviews it at greater length next month. Just room to tell you that it's an hilarious comedy thriller so go see it. Back to the dancing with Skool Daze (PG), though it's not actually a musical. Then again, it's not quite anything. There's some Animal House comedy, there's romance and there's a message about intolerance and integrity. But what makes these university hi-jinks really different is that Mission College is for blacks. Spike The Pet Shop Boys acting it couldn't happen here. Lee, who brought us the highly acclaimed, bargain basement She's Gotta Have It, has thrown in a bit of everything for his first big Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity seem more interested in imitating the ways of white students. It focuses on the hilarious rituals of the Gammas, and the rivalry of radical Dap and cool dude Julian and their girlfriends rivalry which is likely to turn into a dance number at the drop of a challenge! Don't be put off by its heavy-sounding theme or its lack of discipline though. For the most part Skool Daze bubbles along like they really are the best days of your life and it's a true original. The report reads: *Bags of enthusiasm. Will do even better in future.\" Better school than The Pet Shop Boys in their first film, It Couldn't Happen Here (15). It Shouldn't Happen Here is a fairer title for this mish-mash of supposedlymeaningful and heartfelt images rather like their songs you may say. What? You don't say! Then you're probably a Pet Shop Boys fan so ignore all my grumbles about this trip through a Britain stacked with second-hand surrealism in the hope of convincing us that Chris and Neil are really deep and sensitive. For the rest of us, this is what we always feared a ninety minute promo film! At least Prince concentrates on doing what he does best which is performing on stage. Prince Sign o' the Times (15) is a brilliantly well made documentary of his show. Now I'm no fan of the Purple Poser, but the sight of Sheila E pounding the drum kit is one even I won't forget in a hurry. Salome's Last Dance (18) isn't another Dirty Dancing imitator but a version of Oscar Wilde's scandalous play, set in a brothel, with the tarts taking the parts and Wilde and male friend in attendance. Only one director could be responsible the equally scandalous Ken Russell. It tells the story of the princess Salome, who demanded the head of John the Baptist on a plate, presumably because she's tired of Big Macs. Russell's idea of outrageous decadence is to have everyone's nipples painted gold or silver, which is neither wild nor Wilde! He should take a few lessons from John Waters. "
