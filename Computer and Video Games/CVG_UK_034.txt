The N.T.S.C. standards can be accommodated, though, if you have any knowledge of television, by using your old computer modulator part in place of the N.T.S.C.one. Carl Hales Long Eaton Notts CHARTING THE FAVOURITES! FOR THE BEEB VIDEO RACING FOR THE VIC? Dear Sir, After reading the brilliant article on video motor racing in June's C&VG, I wondered whether there were any of these around for the Vic-20.1 haven't heard of any available for the unexpanded or expanded Vic-20 but if there are, could you please tell me the name of the program, the price and the supplier. H. Y. Cheung, Mitcham, Surrey Editor's reply: The only one I know of is Chariot Race by Micro Antics at .95. Details on 09074 5147. CUT OUT THE MIDDLEMAN Dear Sir, I am replying to a recent letter about expensive American soft/hardwaremainly Atari. Most of the cost comes from shipping, import duty, wholesalers' and local dealers' profit. So to overcome the expensive middlemen, all you need is an Access card, or know someone who has one, and a telephone. You will also need an American mag: preferably A.N.T.I.C. or Analog these two are for Atari owners. Find who sells the bits or bit you want and give them a ring. Remember there is a time difference! When they answer, tell them who you are and where you are (it always impresses the Yanks if you say you are British). Then ask about overseas mailing they do it well. Order your things and then state three times your name, address and post code and ask him/her to read it back to you, including what you have ordered. This done, tell them to charge it to your Access card number. The only thing to do next is wait for the postman. Dear Sir, I am currently trying to compile a chart for the following micros BBC Dragon, CBM 64, Vic and Atari which doesn't show the best selling games but people's favourite games. Obviously, the more people who give their favourites, the more accurate it will be. If anyone would like to participate, they can send their Top 20s to R. Fabian, Thirlmere, Hookshill Road, Paignton, Devon TQZNH. Please make the chart out for one micro only and, if a copy of the finished chart is required, enclose a stamped addressed envelope. R.

Avon BRIGHT SPARKS FOR THE ATARI Dear Sir, For the very first time in my life, I have been compelled to write a letter to a magazine. It concerns the letter from Alan Pashby in your May issue. I too am an Atari owner and I cannot agree more with his wish that the English software houses should make available to us cheaper software than our American cousins, even if its quality is not the same. You can therefore appreciate my joy on reading an advert, in the same issue, "

Smith Editor's reply: When we accept entries into the Hall of Fame, we do so on the understanding that these scores have been achieved legitimately and that the programs haven't been tampered with. BEEPS FOR THE DRAGON Dear Sir, In answer to Jonathan Thomas' letter in your June Dear Sir, Here are some useful tips for the owners of any Atari home computer. For debugging programs, type in this program: 32500 POKE 764,255:X=0 32510 IF PEEK (764) 255 THEN LIST X:X=X+1:GOTO 32530 32520 GOTO 32510 32530 IF PEEK (764) = 28 THEN INPUT Z:Z-1 32540 POKE 764,255:GOTO 32510. After typing it in, save it using 'LIST \"C\", and then, to merge it with the program for debugging, use 'ENTER C:\", In direct mode, type 'GOTO 32500', then hold your finger on any key and see each single line scroll up. If the program starts at a high line number or jumps to a much higher line number, press ESC and type in the first or next line number. If you want to change a line, press BREAK, then do the editing and type CONT to continue the lines scrolling. For debugging more quickly, type 'LIST\" and then to stop and check, press CONTROL and 1 together which pauses the screen output. To start the scrolling again, press CONTROL and 1 together again. If you wish to edit a line, press BREAK and, using the facilities EDIT! Timothy Kingston Nettleham Lincoln Surrey 2 -21 Editor's reply: You are right, John. The first to complete the game were Cameron Else and Ross Holman and there are 83 objects in Jet Set Willy-full details on the Bug Hunter page. TURNING JAPANESE IMPOSSIBLE SCORES? WHO KNOWS THE SCORE? Dear Sir With regard to Alan Pashby's letter in the May issue of C&VG, I would like to point out that it would be better to buy BRITISH software so that all the country could benefit, not just his bit. Anyway, I don't think he is in much of a position to get all huffed up about English, American and Japanese software after going out and spending his money on a Japanese computer. Some of us don't want the computer industry to end up like the motorcycle or camera industry-all Japanese! Please could somebody tell this man, for his own sake, where Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland are and what Great Britain means! P. Shepherd Dear Sir, I would like to express my disgust at reading about people scoring 13,652,750 at Jet Pac. I am good (or so I think) at this game and my best ever is just over one million and this took me more than two and a half hours to complete. Assuming that the people playing the game achieved their scores twice as quickly as this, it would have taken them over 15 hours. How many people do you know who get up, play 15 hours of Jet Pac and then go to bed again? What happened to meal times? I am even more disgusted that anyone can believe a issue, here is a program for the Dragon which will make the computer \"beep' each time a key is pressed: 10CLEAR 72,&H7FB8 20DATA34,36,8,0,10,8,0, 1,30, 1,86,EO,B7 ,FF,20,7F, 1,12,7F, 1,13,B6, FF,23,8A,8,B7, FF,23,B6,FF, 1,84,F7,B7, FF,1,B6,FF,3,84, F7,B7,FF,3,73,FF,20,34, 10,30, 1F,26,FC,35, ,10,10,BC,1,12,2D, EF,8C, 0,70,26,C5,35,36, 30FOR N=&H7FB9 TO &H7FFF 40READAS:POKEN, VAL (\"&H\"+A$):NEXT SOPOKE&H16,&HTFPOKE &H16C,&HB9:POKE&H16A, &H7E 60'ON=POKE&H16A,&H7E 70'OFF=POKE&H16A,&H39 Miss E Hopkins Canterbury Kent Dear Sir, I am putting pen to paper because of a certain article that appeared in your June issue of C&VG entitled Join the Jet Set.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPET THE WAR OF THE WORLDS then you press the direction keys to walk in that direction. Without wishing to give the game or the book away (if you only ever read one sci fi book read this), you play the part of a journalist who stumbles across an alien invasion. Like any true romantic faced with the prospect of Armageddon, he can only think of one thing finding his beloved Carrie. Six locations must be visited in the correct order if he is to find Carrie and he must dodge the Martian Fighting Machines as he travels. The action is animated so that when \"a ghostly death ray\" spits from one of the Martians, you see this actually happening. The game runs on the 48k Spectrum but will also be available for the 64, Oric/Atmos, BBC, Electron and MSX machines later in the year. We have five first prizes of a copy of the game, Jeff Wayne's record of the War of the Worlds and a copy of the book, 15 second prizes of War of the Worlds and 25 third prizes of CRL's other recent release Glug Glug. To win, all you have to do is answer the questions about H. G. Wells and his famous book which are written beneath the screens from the game. Write your answers on the form below and send off to Computer & Video Games, WOW Competition, 8 Herbal Hill, London, ECIR SEJ. The H. G. Wells classic sci fi thriller The War of the Worlds is now available as a Spectrum game and you can win one exclusively in this issue of Computer & Video Games. The game is a joint venture between musician Jeff Wayne the man behind the War of the Worlds LP and East London software house, CRL Jeff Wayne had the idea of a video game version of his record two years ago and talked to several top American software houses about the project. Unhappy with the offers he received, as they tended to carve him out of the creative side of the project and wanted merely to use the Jeff Wayne name and the rights that went with it to WOW, he decided to put the idea on ice. It was on his return to the UK after a long spell in the US that Wayne met CRL boss, Clement Chambers who had been thinking independently of a WOW computer game. The game bears much evidence of Wayne's involvement in the project with several interesting jingles and musical scores miraculously squeezed out of the Spectrum's puny speaker. WOW looks set to become a major success for CRL and Jeff Wayne, which is due in large part to the excellent game created by programmer Nigel Taylor. Many companies have learnt to their cost that it's no good simply tying up the rights to a hot book or film. Without a good program to go with it, the title is as likely to flop as any other mediocre release. WOW won't flop because, as Jeff Wayne generously points out, the game stands by itself ... it's a very good program in its own right\". WOW is an Adventure-style game with animated graphics. If you want to go east, What are the chances of anything coming to Earth\"? What do the H. G. in H. G. Wells stand for? Where did the WOW aliens come from? WOW's programmer looks more like which famous pop star? a) Boy George, b) Simon Le Bon, c) Fergil Sharkey WOW COMPETITION Name Address Answers Lose yourself in the world of Activision.

So, it's not surprising that they have launched a computer version of the beer drinker's favourite sport darts. Obviously, the game is set in a seedy and down and out pub, filled with expert throwers who spend most nights exercising their arms in one way or another. The game offers the option of a 501 or 301 start. You can also play against the computer or a drinking mate, if you can find one that can still stand, that is. The screen comprises a cartoon animation of the inside of the pub and a high resolution picture of the board, or just a section if you want to home in on a vital double. The amount of alcohol you consume will affect your form and the large crowd in the pub will give you plenty of grief if you don't hit those treble 20s. Dartz is available from Portsmouth-based Automata Software for the 48k Spectrum and costs .50. "


"G.A.M.E.S N.E.W.S Leon GG39 SIMPLY MAGNETIC POWE THE BEEB MICRO POWER MICRO POWER, one of the best-known and most successful BBC software houses in Britain, has just launched its first four titles for the Commodore 64. The four games, Ghouls, Cybertron Mission, Felix in the Factory and Swoop are all versions of highly successful BBC and Electron games. Ghouls is a version of the highly successful Miner 2049er-type game. Commodore shoot'em-up fans are in luck. Swoop is probably the finest Galaxians clone available on either the BBC or Electron and should convert well to the 64. Felix in the Factory has been Micro Power's most successful game to date, apart from Killer Gorilla perhaps. You play the part of the unfortunate Felix who must guard an automated factory from gremlins during the night. All the games use the new high-speed loading system. All four programs are available from Leeds-based Micro Power and cost .95 each. CRAZY CRANE no more buttons to push or noisy engines to listen to Working on the docks all day. used to be so easy.

"GAM.ES N.E.W.S es C 03 L ONE JUMP AHEAD TURN-UP FOR TEXAS JUMP CHALLENGE First details have just been announced by Martech of their new game Jump Challenge based on the daring exploits of motorcycle stunt ace, Eddie Kidd. Eddie, who set a world bike jump record by leaping 190 feet clearing 14 double decker buses, has been closely involved with Martech's programmers for several months in developing Jump Challenge. The result is a game which challenges the player to try to match Eddie Kidd's skill, timing, control and sheer courage in leaping over increasingly difficult and dangerous obstacles. Jump Challenge will be launched in August, initially for the Commodore 64 and 48k Spectrum, and others shortly afterwards. Precise details of the game are yet to be finalised, but Martech promise it will truly test the nerve and skill of every player. The basic idea of the game seems to be to make the best jump possible. Long jumps will be rewarded by Martech in a monthly competition with prizes of BMX bikes, cash and computer equipment. Eddie Kidd will be guesting at the Martech stand during the Personal Computer World Show in September. Jump Challenge costs .95. PARCO Texas owners have been very badly treated by Texas Instruments over the years. Software support has been patchy and Ti's support for their customers has been pathetic. Many people thought that the TI99/4a was finished when the company announced that it was ending the production of the computer and any new software packages. I'm sure many Texas owners have already laid their machine to rest. Happily, I can report that the TI is alive and kicking and probably better value for money than ever. America has been awash with top quality Texas games for years now, but nobody, least of all Texas themselves, has been bothered to import them from the States up to now, that is. Parco Electrics has bought up all the Atarisoft, Texas Instruments and Tigervision cartridges that have been gathering dust in warehouses all over England. A list of all the available software and hardware for the Ti-99/4a can be obtained from Parco Electrics, 4 Dorset Place, New Street, Honiton. Tel: 0404 44425. One unlikely casualty CANNED KANGAROOS? One unlikely casualty of the home computer revolution could be the family pet or the local KOSMIC KANGA zoo. Games involving animals as the central character seem to be all the rage. Jeff Minter has been making a living out of mutant camels and laser spitting sheep for some time now. Animal lovers could easily be shocked by his treatment of furry beasts, but he claims he likes them really, having adopted a pet llama at his local zoo to prove it. So, with the British love of animals in mind, Micromania has now launched a game featuring Australia's second most famous export after Foster's canned kangaroos. Kosmic Kanga is the story of a destitute kangaroo, left at an airport in a one-wallaby town. If anyone fancies a trip down under for .95 with their Spectrum, you can pick up a copy of Kosmic Kanga from Micromania in Epsom, Surrey. "

"CAMING ENTER THE SUPERCHIP NEW VCS AND SUPER SYSTEM Atari has just developed a new \"superchip\" to speed up and improve the graphics of their new VCS cartridges. The first two games to feature the new chip are Millipede and Crystal Castles reviewed exclusively in C&VG last month. For the technically minded, the \"superchip\" expands the memory capabilities of the standard VCS cartridge, enhancing the graphics and allowing far more complex game play by boosting Read Only Memory (ROM) in the video game cartridge from the standard eight kilobytes to 16k, or by using a proprietary Random Access Memory (RAM) chip nicknamed Sara.

Secret passages are hidden behind the walls of the castle and you can gain entry to these by discovering the secret entrances. These are hidden behind clocks, barrels and bookcases. The passages will generally lead to another room on the same floor. ex cept for the barrel on the ground floor which leads you to a room on the first floor. The passages can only be used by certain characters. You can play the part of a serf, a knight or a wizard in this game.

Now to the Golden Key. There are as we've already mentioned -three parts to this key. They are hidden in various rooms in the castle. Two parts have the letters \"A\", \"C\" or \"G\" on them the remaining part is the ring-shaped end. There is always one part of the key in the attic and usually one in the caverns. The third is placed randomly in the castle. When you discover a section of the Golden Key, you must take it back to the room where the main doors are, drop it and go off in search of the other parts When you have found all the parts, you have to arrange them in the correct order on your scroll\" on the right hand side of the screen so they become the entire Golden Key.

"THE KEY RUG TRAPDOOR DOOR OF A.C.G UNLOCKED (NORMAL) DOOR COLOURED DOOR CLOCK BARREL TI BOOKCASE he BASEMENT ultimate aim is to find the qolden key As you play through the game using your map, draw the best route in pencil on your spare copy. With each new time you go through the game you can then improve and modify your route as you find a more efficient way of getting into the room of Ultimate. It is also useful to mark down the appearance of nasties where they are likely to occur regularly. When you are convinced that you have worked out the best route, draw this on to your master copy and keep it as a reference guide for future use. A Word on the Nasties The main thing to bear in mind about the Atic Atac nasties is that there are some you can kill and some you can't. This also depends on which character you are at any particular time. Most of the nasties including witches, monks, ghosts, ghouls and hungry monsters can be killed by shooting at them but others, like Frankenstein, the DOWNL UP 55 "

Dracula and the Devil can only be repelled. When you discover which article will help to repel individual nasties, it is worthwhile noting this down and keeping it together with your maps as a reference to Atic Atac. One thing worth remembering is that the idea of the game is not to kill nasties but to get out of the castle. Newcomers to the game will therefore have to exercise restraint in nasty-bashing. Don't be unnecessarily chivalrous-remember you are trying to escape, not become a hero. The History of Atic Atac Of all Ultimate's many successful games, Atic Atac is the biggest yet. It has reached that position where it is one of a handful of games that anyone who buys a new Spectrum would want to get to go with it.

DOWN FIRST FLOOR Secroll Little is known about how the game was programmed as Ultimate, as well as being regarded as the best game makers in the business, are also regarded as the most tight-lipped.

Their spanners were forged of an extremely precious metal and, as the strange creatures simply cast them aside as they left the mountain, the caves are full of these very valuable tools. Are you brave enough to attempt to go and collect a few? Inside the mountain there is a series of 20 tunnels and a nasty monster called the Woodle. If you can elude the Woodle, collect all the spanners and make it to the exit before the time limit runs out, then you're a better games player than the C&VG team! Martin has included a high score feature and you can enter your name alongside your top score. The program comes in TWO parts. The first defines the graphics and the second sets up the game itself so be careful to program in both parts. The first part must be SAVED before the second is loaded and RUN. The keys which control the game are: A-up, z -down, <= left and right. And remember watch out for the Woodle! "

The Creepsville Fair has come to town and the unsuspecting inhabitants think that this fair is just like any other they've ever been to. But, unluckily for you and the rest of the town, this is a haunted fairground and there are plenty of ghosts and monsters lurking around the amusements waiting to scare the life out of you. You didn't know this when you jumped on to the dodgem car but you certainly do now. The whole rink is filled with monsters trying to jump in the driving seat with you. So you'll need to keep your foot on the accelerator and a firm hold on the steering wheel if you're going to avoid them. The Z and X keys move you left and right. The / and keys move you up and down.

"raste tired + One of the computer's greatest assets is that it is always there and never gets tired. It is also very handy when you're alone and have nothing to do. Super Solitaire is a perfect example of the computer's usefulness and versatility. The program enables you to play the game quickly and easily because it saves you having to set up the board each time and it also makes the game more fun. A colour television should be used, but it is possible to play the game on a black and white set. If you can complete Solitaire, the computer recognises this and plays When the Saints Come Marching in as a salute. If it is obvious to the computer that you cannot solve the Solitaire, the computer will play The Last Post. 4 GOSUB 5000 5 RESTORE 10 XM=18: YM=10 20 G=0 28 GRAPHICS 3 29 POKE 752,1 30 SETCOLOR 4,6, 31 COLOR 3 32 FOR T=6 TO 15 33 FOR H=10 TO 26 34 PLOT HET 35 NEXT H: NEXT T 36 FOR T=14 TO 22 37 FOR H=2 TO 18 38 PLOT TEH 39 NEXT H: NEXT T 40 COLOR 1 50 FOR T=8 TO 12 STEP 2 60 FOR H=12 TO 24 STEP 2 70 PLOT HT 80 NEXT H: NEXT T 90 FOR T=16 TO 20 STEP 2 100 FOR H=4 TO 16 STEP 2 110 PLOT TEH 120 NEXT H: NEXT T 130 SC=STICK (0) 135 FOR D=1 TO 50: NEXT D 140 X=0: Y= 150 IF SC=7 THEN X=2 160 IF SC=11 THEN X=-2 170 IF SC=14 THEN Y=-2 180 IF SC=13 THEN Y=2 190 COLOR G: PLOT XM, YM 192 XP=XM: YP=YM 173 XMEXM+X: YM-Y+Y 194 IF XM< 12 THEN XM=12 195 IF XM>24 THEN XM=24 196 IF XM< 16 AND (YM<8 OR YM>12) THEN XM =XP: YM=YP 197 IF XM>20 AND (YM<8 OR YM>12) THEN XM =XP: YM=YP 198 IF YM>16 THEN YM=16 199 IF YM<4 THEN YM=4 200 LOCATE XM, YM, G 210 COLOR 2: PLOT XM, YM 220 IF STRIG (O)=THEN GOSUB 1000 230 GOTO 130 1000 IF G< >1 THEN RETURN 1003 FC=STICK (0) 1005 IF FC< >7 AND FC< >11 AND FC< >14 AND FC< >13 THEN 1000 1010 X=0: Y=0 1020 IF FC=7 THEN X=4 1030 IF FC=11 THEN X=-4 1040 IF FC=14 THEN Y=-4 1050 IF FC=13 THEN Y=4 1060 LOCATE XM+X, YM+Y,L 1065 LOCATE XM+ (X/2) , YM+ (Y/2), Z 1070 IF L<>O OR Z< >1 THEN ? \" NVALID MOVE!\":FOR A=1 TO 1000: NEXT A:?\" 3\":RETURN Illustration: Dorian Cross "

You play the part of a loving queen bee who is looking for a place to lay her eggs. Having spotted a cabbage field that looks perfect to leave the eggs, you must drop them so that the maximum number of cabbages are eaten when the grubs emerge from their shells. The game requires a lot of strategic planning and manoeuvring to cover the cabbage patch. But don't think you've got all day to work out the best plan, because there is a time limit. Once you've populated one field, the next screens have progressively more cabbages and smaller time limits.

"This little chap has been turning the arcades blue and pyramids assorted colours in the arcades for some time now. But now the cursing Q'bert has been cleaned up for the Sharp MZ-BOK by enterpris ing games author, Steven Burrows. Just like the arcade games of the same name, you have to help Q*bert change the colour of a pyramid built out of cubes. He does this by leaping from cube to cube using his amazing jumping powers. However, there are hazards which plague Q'bert like a qlant beach ball which bounces around after him and in later screens there's Coily the shake to contend with. Also the ball speeds up as you get better at the game and conquer more pyramids. You get three lives to begin with and an extra lite every two pyramids.

"The RAF needs a brave young test pilot to fly their brand new supersonic fighter plane which has a revolutionary anti-gravity propulsion unit, up to now untested. You have volunteered to fly the plane on its maiden trip. Your flight path takes you over a deserted area of the British Isles. The only building in the vicinity belongs to an old and now deserted mining town, so there will be no danger to the public if the plane malfunctions. As you take off, the plane responds beautifully. It seems as if it's going to be a good Mission: But, 50 miles from base, the engine begins to vibrate violently. You must land the plane but the only flat area in the mountains is the old mining town Your only hope of saving your life and the multi-million pound isto take as many runs at the village as you can, bombing the balding each time on overhead. You have only a few minutes of life left in the engine l i g and timing sharp enough to save the planes -116 BY J. L. TOLPUTT RUNS ON TI-99/4A in 16K "

Sinclair has decided to drop the trusty ZX printer. Hundreds of thousands have been sold but sales are now trailing. The reason for the decline is the release of the interface 1 and other units which offer an RS232 interface to Spectrum owners. This allows a proper daisywheel or dot matrix printer to be connected. ZX81 owners are not so lucky. Printer interfaces for their machine are rare and expensive. You'll still be able to buy rolls of silver paper for some time, but I suspect that this won't be available for much longer. USP 17 17111 FIRST BYTE Here's some news of a much-needed joystick interface for the Electron. Although the machine runs BBC Basic and many programs are compatible with both machines, the Electron lacks all the expansion interfaces and connections which the BBC model B has as standard. First Byte Computers, from Derby, has launched a joystick interface. The white Electron-coloured box is similar in size to the well-known Sinclair 16K RAM pack and plugs into the solitary expansion connector at the back of the computer. You can then plug a single joystick into the box. The reason that the interface caters only for one joystick is twofold: first to keep the price down and second because there's hardly any BBC or Electron software which uses two joysticks anyway. A conversion cassette is supplied with the interface and will convert twenty wellknown games for use with a joystick. There's also a universal converter routine which will convert any games which use the negative INKEY technique to read the keyboard. If you want to put a joystick into your Electron then this interface will set you back This is an \"official\" unit which plugs into | NEW INTERFACE 2 the one and only connector on the back of the computer and provides many of the You've probably seen the new Sinclair hardware facilities which BBC owners Interface 2 in the shops.

The first batch of machines was launched recently and, at first sight, they appear impressive. MSX stands for Microsoft Extended Basic. No, I know it doesn't exactly, but that's what they've come up with so that's what we call them. The idea, though, is revolutionary and it's surprising that no one has thought of it before. What's been done is that a group of computer makers have come together to design a standard for a micro. Each MSX machine, as they'll be known, will run the same version of Basic and have the same internal What's even more exciting is that software written on one MSX computer will run unchanged on any other MSX micro. Yes, if you buy an MSX machine and your friend buys one as well, then software from your machine will run on your friend's. Oops, perhaps I wasn't supposed to say that. Anyway, what is worrying quite a few people is that if you copy a tape illegally, then not only will it run on your MSX machine, but on anyone else's too. Now there's a thought. A catalogue of between 200 and 500 games programs has been promised for the initial launch of the first machines in August-September. Software will be either on cassette, cartridge or disk. Cartridges will retail for around  and, from the few which I managed to play with at the launch, I can promise you that they're well worth the money.
