"Namo To: Warwickshire County Council Department of Health Petition against Dominic Wheadon We, the undersigned, wish to submit an official complaint against Mr Dominic Wheadon of 13 Turret Grove, Coventry. Despite repeated requests from residents Mr Wheadon refuses to remove the 25ft hardboard Venus Fly Trap, pig and palm tree from his garden. The said monstrosities attract hordes of undesirable tourists to the street and causes frequent disruption in an otherwise quiet, respectable area. Mr Wheadon also refuses to remove the skunks, turtles and bandicoots which continually escape from his garden and foul the footpaths and grass verges. Lastly we would demand that Mr Wheadon be restrained from playacting scenes from \"Crash Bandicoot\", the PlayStation video game in his garden, as he creates noise and disturbance all night long, lowering the tone of the neighbourhood, Address Name GUMAM Smakains-drum 17 Turvet mere Dana Swacklun-Brenala Mr. Joseph Brenham Professor C.

SWAN SPECIAL THANKS TO: OUR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS US CORRESPONDENT: MATT TAYLOR JAPAN CORRESPONDENT: WARREN HARROD he most frustrating part about producing CVG at the moment is not, as you might suppose, Phil Dawson. It's that no matter how great we make the best games look, and describe every detail of how they play, we can't let you listen to any of them! So it's an obvious point to make, but since music is so vital (and, by the way, three of us hear just elected NIGHTS as one of our all-time favourite games because of it) perhaps CVG is missing something. Then again, you might be the sort of person who still insists on listening to Wigfield instead of the awesome music and effects to Wipeout 2097 wipiul Editorial and advertising: 0171-972 6700 Editorial fax: 0171-972 6701 Advertising/Ad Production fax: 0171-216 6219 Subscription and Back Issues: (9.30-5.30 Mon-Fri): 01858 468888 CVG Headquarters: Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. So here are a couple of questions which you ought to consider answering, as it's in you best interest: Should CVG regularly dedicate space to music in games special features, standard paragraphs within Reviews and Coming Soon?

Whenever the High Five is lit, you know this game is essential. trange how Paul seems to have been working a lot less hours recently. played loads more games but not quite so many as Ed, of course and CVG has been right on schedule for the first time in over a year. There can be only two explanations: Paul is a Pink Magician from Bettinuppy, who came to Earth via Halifax. After a brief stay in Rochdale, he saw that London required his assistance. Specifically EMAP Images. OR he's been getting everyone else to do all the work for him, so he can scive off and go to the theatre with his girlfriend. Hmmm...? e behave ourselves on CVG. Because if we don't, Mike says he'll kill Tom. And you can tell he means it. But there has been some exciting weather recently hasn't there... did you see old wossname on the telly the other day, er, night... okay Mike I'm writing! I'm writing look! Blah, blah. blah... (We're not scared of Mike at all, by the way it's just a little joke we like to have in here which makes him feel proud and we all get to feel smug about it. Heh-heh.) Look Mike I'm writing as fast as I can, you know! Can't go much quicker than this (heh-heh).

Luckily his bout of chronic diarrhoea ensured that he got to sit down quite a lot. His two front teeth are no longer his own, since he smashed the originals on the swimming pool floor. Which was fine too, as the pain killers meant he didn't feel a thing when he got beaten up. Oh, and he had his watch stolen. This was the best holiday in his life. e reckon Ed-genius freak boy that he is has devised a form of sonic torture which could reduce all anti-CVG agents to a puking wreck. He has this thing where he puts the cheat for infinite Custom Combos in Street Fighter Alpha 2. Then he selects Shin Gouki, and proceeds to Hurricane Kick, Fireball, and Dragon Punch nonstop for two hours. While all the screaming is going on, we get to listen to the strange clickety click of Ed's fingers on the controller. Equally abhorrent is the strange, barely audible wail which Freak Boy emits when listening to Pink Floyd. These games are either well produced examples of common concepts, or slightly flawed workings of originality.

Inspired by his exposure to foreign climates, Jaime wrapped all his belongings two boxes of Vitamins, and an N64 into a napkin, and left South End. Which is interesting. But maybe not quite so interesting as his recent Anthropology studies in Tenerife. There he watched the antics of Phil Dawson and Tom Guise in their natural state', albeit suffering from various forms of poisoning, which seemed to incite them to violence. In between swimming and sit-ups, Jaime said a prayer for the future of mankind. f you value your privacy, Phil Dawson isn't the best man to have around in times of vulnera bility. Before you know it, everyone will have seen snapshots of your bare backside, and Phil will be hopping around, guf fawing, and squealing, showing off his willy. If you need assistance in times of severe trouble (for example, if Tom were ever to get beaten up by a bunch of thugs) don't count on Dawson. He'll just hop around in the background, guffawing and showing off his willy. As CVG is an honest publication, we have the photos to prove it. But you don't want to see them. We're depressed by it.

"computer video games NEWSO DE PROGRAMMING HEROES GRACE L HMV RETRO EXHIBITION! HMV KNOW HMV. KNOW GAMES On Saturday 19th October one of London's biggest, most modern video games departments opened a Retro Games exhibition. As this was launch day, a number of famous English programmers were invited down to share their thoughts, and generally be available for questions from the public. The venue was HMV Level One, in London's Oxford Street. In the area usually dedicated, they have (until the end of November) a number of classic coinops Defender, Pac Man, and Space Invaders plus a corner lined with computers and video game systems of yesteryear. The atmosphere was a mixture of excitement for the new and unknown as it applied to younger visitors. Older gamers who grew up with these systems seemed equally thrilled to be reminded of how things really were as opposed to the fond memories of games such as Pong Basketball on the Grandstand entertainment system... THE RETRO REP CVG AND HMV RETRO EXHIBITION Characters such as Jason Moore, who edits a fanzine/ magazine called Retro Games, offered an expert insight into what was on display. His publication regularly details why machines like the Oric-1, for example, managed to remain a contender for a short while, simply because it could run ZX Spectrum games. Excitement? Or confusion that the graphics look like squiggles. ANDREW BRAYBROOK The game which brought rockin' C Andy Braybrook into the public eye was Paradroid for the C64 a weird robot shoot'em up in which the central character could steal abilities from defeated foes.

This streamlined version of Nintendo's popular handheld is two-thirds the size of the old machine, and half its weight. It also features a larger black-and-white screen which provides better contrast than the old green screen. Nintendo's UK distributors, THE Games, are marketing the machine as a fashion accessory and estimate the new GB Pocket could clock up 100.000 sales by the end of April. Certainly in Japan its release helped push a Gameboy title, Pocket Monsters, into the multi-format Top Ten. However, THE don't reckon the machine is going to supersede the old Gameboy sales of which currently top two million in the UK alone as the coloured Gameboys are still hugely popular. Gameboy Pocket is priced at .99 (original Gameboys are between -) without game.

Produced by Suburban Base Records, famous for their Drum and Bass offerings, Club Sega features remixes of music from various Saturn games, done by some particularly impressive DJs. Virtua Fighter by Marshall Jefferson for example, Fighting Vipers by Paul 'Trouble' Anderson, and Athlete Kings by Kenny Ken! The disc also features playable demos of NIGHTS, Worldwide Soccer, Athlete Kings, Panzer Dragoon Zwei and Baku Baku.

Alternatively, answer this question to get a disc for free. What music does Jeffry McWild enjoy when he's not fishing? Send your entries to: I WANT TO CLUB MY SATURN, BOYEEE COMP! at the usual address. The first three correct entries win. No doubt that's the witty headline the creators of the new PYST PC CD-ROM title are hoping for. The more astute among you may notice the similarity in spelling to MYST, the top-selling adventure. That's because PYST is a witty parody of said game. The developers, Parroty Interactive, are keen to stress though that this isn't a game. Instead, it features the Myst island, looking decidedly knackered since four million visitors have run rampant on it. And that's the joke familiar scenes, humourously distorted, with loads of amusing animations featuring John Goodman (big guy from Roseanne) as the new King. There's also a PYST website (www.pyst.com), with a special 'Members Only' area where owners of the CD-ROM can download video clips and send postcards and messages to other members. PYST is released on November 10th, priced .99. Dreadful looking sleeve design. But that's in keeping with typical dance compilation stylee! A COLLECTION OF CLUB REMIXES FROM: WARSHALL TERSON KENNT KEN TRIBAL GATHERING REVISTED By Jingo, these console-related dance albums are becoming standard practice. Of course, you may not think the Tribal Gathering '96 compilation is console-related. But Sony Computer Entertainment clearly do, as they've sent us three copies of the album for competition prizes. And they're quite entitled to their opinion, considering they sponsored both the Tribal Gathering and Big Love, this year's two big dance events (and they sent Tom to Tribal Gathering and he still hasn't said thank you so thank you). Anyway, let's cut to the deal. To win a copy of the album, just answer this tribal question. What was the hair colour of the cave people that lived near the sea in One Million Years BC?

"computer video games THE POWER OF NINE! NEWS O Who are these nine companies that, when combined, are known as the Game Designers Network? A few of them are quite obscure in this country. Namely, Japan Art Media, Neverland, Onion Egg and Bits Laboratory. Others, such as the CSK, Research Institute, are significant because they are related to CSK venture capital, who play an important financial role. Then there's Quintet the people behind the Actraiser Series, Soulblazer and Illusion of Time. Sting creators of Treasure Hunter G, published through Squaresoft to critical acclaim are working a new title called Baroque. We'll have more on these companies and their games in the near future. In the meantime, here's the two most relevant companies of the moment. THE GAME DESIGNERS NETWORK! TOP DEVELOPERS CREATE POWERFUL SATURN GAMES FACTORY! ne of the most incredible pieces of gaming news, revealed recently at the Tokyo Game Show, is that a group of major developers have joined forces to create a programming powerhouse for the Saturn. The Game Designers Network (GD-NET) exists to enable smaller game companies to against the major software giants, while allowing them to maintain their creative freedom. Currently, nine software houses are involved (see elsewhere on this page), and this new organisation will coordinate the technology, manpower, marketing, developing and funding for these member companies. The theory is this. The cost of CD-ROM development is escalating. And at this rate all future game investment will lie in the hands of the major software houses, who will put smaller companies under their brand name. Through GD-NET, these companies can take responsibility for their game development, with their own names on the finished package. This also gives them a greater desire to produce quality software, since people will know who produces the good and bad games. What's more, the companies can exchange ideas and information with each other, thus gaining help from other teams who may specialise better in certain areas. Although, as rivals, they'll still keep their own top-secret development tools to themselves. Funding also plays a vital role. Previously, developers have been limited to strict budgets set out by their publishers. This meant they could be forced to compromise their own ideas to meet their publisher's idea of what is a 'good' game. Also, exceeding budgets or deadlines meant the financier could make them cut corners, possibly resulting a poor final product. At the centre of GD-NET is a company called ESP (Entertainment Software Publishing), whose job it is to draw in funds for games which the individual companies would have trouble financing. In their first year, ESP intend on supporting 10 to 15 titles at a total financial cost of 1,000,000,000 yen (approx .7 million). This leaves the member companies free to develop games the way they want, without development interference or financial worry. Clearly next year promises monumental events for the Saturn. Seven game contracts have already been given the green light. And considering the quality of the teams involved, we can only imagine what they'll produce now they have full creative and financial freedom. Watch this space! Grandia Game Arts newest and most ambitious project yet. It's taken two years so far! GAME ARTS NEWS. SATURN DEVELOPERS POWERHOUSE EMERGES! QUETTE You'd better believe it. Short of the characters, everything here is realtime generated 3D! 2015 The makers of Mega-CD Silpheed and Gun Griffon are now working on an incredible looking new game Grandia. From the pictures you may think it looks like just another RPG. However, it's Game Arts' experience with polygons that makes Grandia so different. Although the characters are sprites, the backdrops are realtime-generated 3D. So instead of any point-and-click style interface, : you can interact totally with the environment! Anything can be touched or held, characters can sit down before eating, or kick bottles across the floor. To date Game Arts have spent two years on the game, clocking up 20,000 frames of animation! The story follows a boy called Justin, who has been born into the industrial age of his world. However, he dreams of travelling to  the ancient times of the Enjuul civilisation, which were said to be even more advanced. And he longs to be reunited with his father : who vanished after giving him the Spirit Stone. One day, while exploring some ruins, the stone begins to glow. In a quest to discover why this is happening, Justin travels to Elencia, a new continent that is said to hold unknown new technology. Each location of Grandia is promised to possess an individual style of its own. And already it's clear that graphically Grandia is  said to look fantastical. Unlike any Saturn game we've ever seen before! In fact, : Japanese interest in it is already said to be : stealing attention from Final Fantasy VII! We've yet to see it running, but so far it looks as good as FFVII on PS. And that's pre-rendered! TREASURE The acclaimed creators of Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy and Guardian Heroes are quite possibly the highest profile team in the GD-NET. Not much is known about their next big project short of its name Silhouette Mirage and the release of this main character artwork. However, even from these it's clear that this game has the winning style of the aforementioned games. If it has at least the same quality of gameplay, it's going to one of the most incredible games of 1997! 12 : Can Saturn really do this? We want to : see it running before we believe it! "

"NINTENDO: GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT compute videc games BAG Dear CVG, Having had most computers/ consoles at some stage in the last 17 years, I am, in my opinion, seeing the start of a collapse in the console market. And contrary to to what most people think, I see Nintendo as the culprit. The N64 is not just right for any market in any country. Being cartridge based it's dated, and software (in Europe anyway) will be quite expensive. The cheapest I can see games is .99 at the least, and who can afford that? Okay, Nintendo may be able to turn out software like SM64 and Pilot Wings 64 and turn a huge profit. But what about smaller developers, eg Microprose, who have pulled out? Also EA are considering pulling out firstly testing the N64 market with FIFA 97, their most popular game ever. Cartridge is outdated. Why? High manufacturing costs for one, and slow production rates. Okay, you get instant loading but I believe that with clever programming CD-ROM should have little or no delay eg Virtua Fighter 2. For me there is only one true gaming 'next gen' console on the market worthy of consideration the vastly underrated Sega Saturn. The games are brilliant especially NIGHTS, VF2, Sega Rally and Guardian Heroes. When you look at what's coming Fighting Vipers, Exhumed, VF3, Virtual On, Manx TT... it's just mind blowing. I know Sony have a fine machine, but it was hype that put it at the 10141 1st 5:01 forefront. In Japan it's different, but then Japanese gamers know their stuff when it comes to gaming. I apologise if at first I sound pessimistic then optimistic, but I don't believe the N64 is right for Europe. Let the rest of the world have it and for me saying that I see a collapse in the gaming market, maybe that's a slight exaggeration but it's definitely what it should be. Lastly, slap on the back to Sega for the analogue pad. It's brill. Alan Quirke, Youghal, Ireland Produto CVG: Cartridges are only a bad idea if the games are bad. Sounds naive, but when the 16-bit systems were at their peak, players couldn't get enough of the hottest releases. So you could argue that producing for cartridge demands a better quality product in order to make the investment worthwhile. But fair comment. Saturn isn't underrated just Sega have done a spectacularly inadequate job of marketing the thing. 6 Ciaglinski With fantastic games like Fighting Vipers, NIGHTS and Victory Goal '96 Saturn is the best, says Alan Quirke. But N64 is going to destroy the market, he predicts. Pah! 10. There seem to be slight delays, almost loading 10. There seem to be slight delays, almost loading time in Pilot Wings 64. Is this intentional or decompression lag? I thought the access time on a cartridge was 120ns? 11. Are there any plans for an N64 link-up cable, couldn't find any ports for one on my machine (unless you count the EXT.DD port on the bottom)? 12. What ever happened to Jaz?

While Capcom haven't cate ala Diamond Edge? gorically denied its existence, the signs aren't good: X-Men: Children of the Atom has been officially canned, and that game is much less intense. Also, PlayStation Street Fighter Alpha 2 is lacking some animations and features that the Saturn version has. All we can do is refer you to Capcom's announcement that they're ceasing 2D development on PS to concentrate on 3D projects. Fingers crossed, PlayStation WILL get Marvel Super Heroes! Then again... CVG: 1. We'd love to see that too! 2. Almost certainly, but those games benefit from an extensive number of stages, which requires lots of stored data especially in the kind of detail Contra demonstrates. So perhaps we're waiting for a Bulky Drive version. 3. Konami could do a Goonies style game, sure. But a Goonies license wouldn't make it any better, especially not now. 4. One of the reasons Virtual Boy is designed to sit on a desk top is for legal reasons Nintendo are very safety conscious, and don't want to have their users wind up unconscious at the bottom of the stairs with their head stuck in Mario Land. Maybe with an N64 acting as an anchor they'll feel safer with the idea. 5. Believe us, once you've played Shadows you won't be wanting for more. 6. The Super NES emits some pretty awful sounds too ever heard the game Tom and Jerry? It's down to the skill of developers such as Software Creations (Plok), and Rare (Donkey Kong Country, Killer Instinct) to make all the difference. 7. You like Capcom don't you.

This Christmas the N64 gets the sequel. We may never work again. zu ushing the Nintendo 64 to its known limits, Mario Kart 64 is expected to become the greatest racing game in the world. After all, it is still regarded as one of the best games ever made, let alone backing it into a niche. Even after the dizzying heights reached by Pilot Wings 64 and Super Mario 64, it would appear that N64 is capable of coming down to earth in style, hitting the ground running something even more awesome. This is N64's first 96-meg cartridge (the others have all been 64), and you can guarantee that every last bit of information is worth its weight in gold. Nintendo NEW TO THE KART CREW 64-BIT RETUNE OF THE WORLD'S MOST PLAYABLE RACER KART CONTROLI The one reason Super Mario Kart remains so popular is the intuitive control, which allows everyone a direct line to the brilliant gameplay. With the new analogue interface (the '3D' stick) Nintendo boast that the control and gameplay has advanced as much as the graphical style. While there aren't any more characters to choose, this year's tournament sees two new entrants. Donkey Kong takes over from his son Junior, and Wario booted Koopa out of the seat. What this means is the balance of power has changed! Previously the drivers were grouped into four sets of equal ability: Bowser and DK Jr were fast and heavy; Koopa and Toad had the best manoeuvrability; Princess and Yoshi had the fastest accleration but lowest top speed, and the Mario bothers averaged out. Since Wario is being presented as another heavy weight, it makes the situation a little uneven. Possibly each driver is now unique, which would reflect the fact that the controls are so much more precise. SPIN TURN TMI SE M / WMR 80*272 With one foot on the brake, and the other on the accelerator, drivers get to spin their kart through 180¬∞! This is called a Spin Turn, and is explained as a useful tactic for using weapons on someone close behind, after which another Spin Turn takes the kart right back on course. * POWER STEERING Even standard cornering is made more precise, as the wheels now turn precisely to match the corners. In some cases it may only require a slight push to the left or right, while others are sure to require complex power sliding techniques yanking the 'wheel' to one side then containing the slide neatly on the other. 1 Wario joins the race as a new heavyweight, will he be the fastest of them all? TIME O1'56\"2 * REVERSE By hitting the brake, then pulling back on the 3D stick, karts can reverse out of trouble. As the 3D world allows for the appearance of walls, it helps that drivers can back away from one after crashing right into it! In the Super NES game it's necessary to hop around awkwardly to realign the kart. MARIO LUIGI PEACH KINOPIO WARIO  D. KONO YOSHI 16 "

As the Mushroom Kingdom is now presented in real time 3D, this has allowed the laws of physics to play an important part.

For example it is important to approach the bottom of a hill at speed, however it's equally as crucial to slow down before reaching the bottom at the other side the momentum could send the kart crashing into a fence!

MOH MOH FARM ¬´Moh\" is the Japanese interpretation of \"Moo\", representing the cows. The uneven road surface lowers the karts' top speeds to around 50 km/h (max is 100). Power drifting is in danger of going out of control too. Just like in Donut Plains in Super Mario Kart, there are moles here who jump out of their hills to block the way. TURTLE BEACH Waves splash onto the beach, and the tide affects the shape of the course. Dark Wet sand shows where the coastline ends. Drivers who chance driving too close to the edge might find themselves swallowed up by the sea if they're not careful!

If this place resembles the ghost house in Mario 64 it's going to be very scary!!! * CHOCO MOUNTAN This too has a precarious drop to one side, as it follows a mountain trail. Mist prevents inexperienced drivers from navigating too far ahead, and falling rocks present an unpredictable danger too. There's even a \"Falling Rocks\" sign. Going up it's slow. Coming down no doubt requires some skill with the brakes! Characterised by slippy flagstones, just as they are in Super Mario Kart.

Of course our mortal efforts been getting much less predictable. would have been dreadful. Wave Race, on the other hand, is a godly piece of work. or some time now race games have been getting much less predictable. Not just the theme, but the run of events in general. Recently the Wipeout games have gained much due respect their futuristic setting is exciting because it allows for the impossible. However Nintendo have produced a dazzling new race idea for N64, based on a sport which takes place right now on this planet. We could never have imagined how a Jet Ski game could be so exciting so radically different! You won't believe your eyes. AVERACY WAVERAGE WAVE RACE TM  NINTENDO 1996 Kawasaki JETTA IT'S WATER Perhaps the best place to start with Wave Race is by bringing your attention to the amazing water effect. It's not enough to say \"there is water in this game\". By that we could mean anything there is water in many video games in some form or another. The difference here is that the water looks and behaves so realistically that you'd swear someone had emptied a bucket of the stuff into your telly! There's more to it than appearance too, as waves directly affect the handling of the Jet Skis which can work for or against the rider. WAVE RACE WAVE RACE ULTRA REALISTIC JET SKI ACTION ULTRA REALISTIC JET SKI ACTION Breaker Riding the crest of a wave not only feels sensational, it boosts speed too. They're not especially random, which helps seasoned Wave Racers plan ahead. Choppy In these rough conditions tight cornering is risky, as there is a chance of riders being bounced off their seat. Once you're used to it, though, it's ace! Glassy Practically no worries here at all. The challenge on a perfect surface comes from learning the course to the finest detail, so you can tuck in close to corners. iso 95 00 BRIE 6 MAR POWER A PO CRASHING TIME 0¬∞ 27¬∞438 L AD SPEED SU: TIME OORS 0 1 IDEED 75. ATY 1 HOW DOES IT FEEL? As with all the flagship N64 titles Wave Race 64 places great emphasis on the use of the analogue joystick. Steering the Jet Ski involves more than pushing left or right the stick is used to vary degrees of turn, as well as tilting the ski forward or backward in the water, or even in the air. In addition to that, riders perform stunts according to how the stick is manipulated. Such details soon become second nature. After that the game becomes one big opportunity for showing off! COMING SOON MISS LEANING ODIO Xuvia 999 Sta. Do 9 Instead of bouncing off the top of large waves, it's sometimes better to duck through them. This slows your speed a little, but it can aid tighter cornering and avoid collisions with other riders. Plus it looks extremely cool. RANK TAD 002 383) 91 KUR MAX POWER Kawasaki Most basic of all cornering skills is knowing how far to lean into a corner. The more you lean the greater the drag on the water.

After leaning into a turn, the stick is rotated to the back position which swings the back end of the ski around. Use the waves to bounce the ski ahead by pulling back slightly on the stick. This raises the 'nose of the ski, leaving it to hop over a series of deep troughs in the hope of preventing loss of speed. Kind of unstable though. MY FIRST JET SKI Plavers choose one of four riders to represent them three male, one female. The bikes are all tuned the same, but each rider's physique affects their handling. In the Time Attack option it's wise to select a rider whose abilities are best suited. However, for the Championship you need someone who you feel comfortable with all round.  AYUMI STEWART American Age 21 Male Less momentum than Ryota, but the better all-rounder for beginners to try. Ayumi has a nice balance between agility and acceleration power.

Of course the thing you most want to do with an expensive Jet Ski and a vast expanse of deep water is mess around. In Wave Race 64 there are points to be gained for exploring the alternative uses of your machine... and it gets pretty spectacular! CUSTOM MACHINE After selecting the rider, there is an opportunity to meddle with the ski's handling and power ratio. Power ratio controls top speed and acceleration, while handling is broken down into steering and grip (the amount of surface friction). After some experimentation there's potential to create the ultimate Wave Racer. DU 1470 Loop POINTS: 1000 Flip the ski backward through 360¬∞. For this you need some height usually gained from a ramp, though there are a couple of super waves which serve the same purpose. Tap forward, then pull back hard on the stick. 00000 22 Twist POINTS: 1000 Like the loop, only sideways. Again you need to be a way off the surface to do this successfully. The rider throws his/ her weight to one side, forcing the weight of the ski around them. Tap left (or right) then push hard right (or left). Handstand POINTS: 1000 Looks great, but is not so wonderful for controlling the ski. For this trick, players need to hold off the accelerator for a second, and press down then up. The rider stays in this position so long as the stick is pushed up. Backward POINTS: 1000 Gasp as your rider climbs over the handle bars to straddle the steering column, then drive from this backwards position! It's okay to stay like this indefinitely too. Rotate the stick clockwise through 360¬∞, then press down. Standing POINTS: 1000 This standing on the engine trick is made cooler because it can be followed by a backward somersault. For the rider to hop up there, rotate the stick counterclockwise through 360¬∞, then press up.

Back then the races took place in entirely different locations, featuring what appeared to be a sewer level, and Venice-style canal. More significantly, the vehicles are radically changed from transforming catamarans to the Kawasaki Jet Skis. Could it be that Kawasaki saw the demo at Shoshinkai, and approached Nintendo with a new angle?  733 A:202 e . AR3 With the addition of riders, there is a stronger sense of realism. Not only is it easier to identify with the riders, but watching them lean into the waves, and tumble into the water after an accident is much more impressive. Wave Race, as presented to the world last November. These futuristic ships transform from catamaran into canoe, to negotiate the bizarre courses. Could be we are looking at a prototype for F-Zero 64! SKI VERSUS SKI Competition with another player is presented as a one-on-one situation; horizontal splitscreen, on any course made available through the Championship game. We've discovered that there is a loss of detail to manage the two-player races, most notably on the water which loses its transparency. Also the clipping point (where the waves are seen to be 'drawn') is brought much closer. The only other worth mentioning is the absence of guidance arrows-though it could be argued that this is deliberate, to make races more challenging. BUT it's still a lot of fun. While we would have preferred the chance to compete in a two-player championship, there's still joy in humiliating a friend. Especially when pulling off cool stunts all the way!

Unfortunately, this isn't it... ep, that's right. This isn't the sequel to the amazing Command & Conquer isn't coming out for quite a while yet. That's because C&C: Red Alert is in fact the prequel to the original game, explaining how NOD and GDI were formed! Here you play as either the Allies or the Soviets, working your way through 20 missions for each until you eventually discover the truth! It sounds excellent already! COMMAND & CONQUER: RED ALERT YOUR MISSION, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT... There are 40 missions in Red Alert: 20 for the Soviets, and 20 for the Allies. As with the first game, they vary greatly in the amount of time they take to complete and in their overall objective. Some require you to build a solid base and train loads of soldiers, some are simple \"kill everyone\" missions, for others you'll need to clear an area of enemies in a strict time limit so that a convoy can pass safely. some will require you to send dogs to capture spies, and you'll even get the chance to play a spy and steal a truck yourself! NEW WEAPONS! As well as all of the units which were controllable in the first C&C, there are now a few more which can be used. The dogs, for example, haven't got any long-range weapons (obviously), but are very fast when running towards a target. There are different types of aircraft gunner planes, bombers, etc. which can be used, and even a tuxedo-wearing spy who can't be spotted by anyone other than the sniffer dogs!

Fighter planes and a submarine versus the gunboats! 1 The gunboats can be positioned wherever you want (in the water), and set to attack anything! I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW! While the graphics of Red Alert aren't massively improved over the original game (they're still all 2D with little sprites) there's a new high resolution mode for Windows '95. While you need a Pentium to try it out, it's immediately obvious how much better it looks giving you sharper graphics and more detailed objects. Bring on the bomber planes and take out those barracks! COMING SOON 1 A nice big base. That's what we like to see! Unless it's the enemy's, of course. NEXT MONTH... KEEP CONQUERING! This is where it gets hectic a fierce battle for ground! In the next issue you can pretty much guarantee a review of what we expect to be one of the top-selling PC games of the year.

Last year its sequel, 11th Hour, was less successful! At much the same time Sega of America was splitting itself into component parts.

Their main project has been Mr Bones, which is largely the work of respected CG Animation and modelling house, Angel Studios.

The early part of the game has him escaping his graveyard plot pursued by malevolent red-eyed corpses. It then develops into a journey into soul' as Mr Bones discovers his salvation in the blues guitar. He's given a trusty 'axe' by a blind Blues Scotsman and discovers it can mellow the denizens of hell. The plot is relayed in lots of long, digitised video passages, justifying the 'movie' tag, but it must be said that the quality of these is far beyond the level of most bog-standard digitised video bits concentrating on real characters and dramatic dialogue. Angel Studios know their stuff. When Bones first gets his guitar, he has to impress an audience of demonic skeletons by playing the right riffs in time to the rhythm. Wee-oow!!! Peeowpeow Weay-iiieee!!! 000eee-ow!! (Yeah). Panic-style gameplay as Bones attempts to man four sets of bongo drums, somehow wired up to the mains in the middle of a country field. Failure to bash the skins leads to an overcharge. Smacks of a demo looking for a game idea! Bones is suspended from a huge gargoyle which swoops through a series of cathedrals smashing through the amazing stained glass window in each. MOAT MONSTER FUNNY BONES DIGITAL INTEGRATION COMING SOON The 'FMV' sections are polished, but not groundbreaking. Still Mr Bones uniquely blends both into certain parts of its gameplay. In one section a long sequence of logs rolling down a hillside sets the challenge for a fleeing Mr Bones.

So have Activision finally hit the right note with Blast Chamber? on't know about you, but we can think of a whole sack full of better stuff to do with a ready-to-detonate time bomb strapped to your back, than run around a rotating chamber trying to prevent said device exploding. For starters, you could pop over to LA and spend as much money as possible except yours, try and get ex-Eternal girl Louise to give you a snog or walk up to Chris Eubank, stamp on his feet, call him a big girl's blouse and stroll off again. At least that would give you a some satisfaction. But Activision have gone for the 'rotating chamber' option... BLAST CHAMBER WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT THEN? BEATS RED BULL ANYWAY! id38WWHO IsV78 HIIM 330 aV  o18 N The idea behind Blast Chamber is a simple but bizarre one. You are trapped in a rotating arena with a time bomb strapped to your back. In order to prevent this bomb going off, you must obtain a crystal located in the arena. While you have this, your own timer stops, and you have a choice: bump up your time, or lower an opponent's. Take the crystal to your own coloured reactor to give yourself an extra thirty seconds. Take it to any other colour to make their time shrink by 15. And that's about it. Told you it was easy. Further into the game more icons adorn the chambers. Speed-up icons are the first you'll be able to utilise, but other bonuses include icons to reset the crystal to a neutral position, give the crystal a ten-second bomb which kills the holder at the time of detonation, or one to freeze everyone else on screen except the collector of the icon. Nobody said this was gonna fair! The circular icons are power ups that give you a much needed boost in the race against time. Lovely. SEEN ONE LEVEL, SEEN 'EM ALL? YOU MUST ELIMINATE THEM! Well not exactly in Blast Chamber. You see, every chamber has its own quirk or obstacle, designed to hinder another's progress. Some are completely covered in rotation arrows, severely shortening the time you have to get to the reactors. Others have portals or spikes which destroy you instantly. A good tactic is to try and rotate the cage so that people have no choice but to fall into the pits and turn themselves into mincemeat! Rotating the Spike Chamber (right) is the best way to kill other players quickly. Wow. Eliminator is probably the most entertaining of the three game modes featured in BC. There is no overall time limit, only an individual one for each of the characters, and the aim is to make sure you are the last one alive. Eliminator is where the more devious tactics come into play because you can all gang up on one person to take them out quick, making it easier for everyone else. Just don't expect the poor guy to give help in your time of need! Finish the Eliminator alive, and a sequence showing you ditching your bomb is the reward. 2:13 o It plays better than it looks. 500 ADO POINTS SCORED NEXT MONTH... CHAMBER OF HORRORS? 300 200 If we can manage to get everything done before our time runs out and the bombs start to detonate, Blast Chamber will be getting a full review next month. The countdown begins... 3... 2... 1). 32 "

Will it take these systems by storm, or is C&C destined for going to change though. Forget endless little more than a light shower? COMMAND & CONQUER onsole strategy games are about as common as a well-used Jaguar, and the few that are available are arguably dull as ditch water. All this is going to change though. Forget endless pages of historically accurate statistics, and don't even bother with grainy black and white photos of some battle damaged tank, because this is Command & Conquer and it doesn't take prisoners! It's a strategy monster which heavily relies on arcade action it's a resource management game that's more aggressive than Sim City 2000, and a frantic blast involving more more bullets fired than Deathmatch Doom. Some would suggest running for cover. We say stand up and take it. Oh yes! ............................................. WE WANT YOU! VIRGIN'S GAME OF CONQUERS Armchair generals choose to command one of two armies, either siding with the good guys, the GDI, or signing up with the nasty Brotherhood of NOD. However, rather than tackling the same mission from a different perspective, each of the scenarios is specific to the army. The Saturn version boasts all the missions from the original Command & Conquer, PLUS every sortie from the Covert Operations data disk. That's over fifty in total! $ 1300 OFF WITH A BANG! Anyone who's played Dune 2 on the Mega Drive will find Command & Conquer strangely familiar. No surprise really considering both games were developed by Las Vegas-based coders Westwood Studios. C&C is essentially Dune 3, but rather than two factions fighting over the precious Spice, this time it's the Global Defence Initiative and the Brotherhood of NOD who are, desperately battling for control over the mineral, Tyberium. Hmmm, ring any bells? $ 1700 BARRACKS NOD GDI CONSTRUCTING FOR KIDS VUOMING SOON Starting out with a handful of troops and an armoured car (if you're lucky), the objective is to first build an army before going on to eliminate the enemy. Providing cash is free-flowing, factories can be built, and from these a wide variety of tanks, combat bikes and troop carriers are spawned. Reinforcements spew from the barracks, Tyberium is harvested from the natural plantations, and even air strikes can be called in to level the opponent's HQ! $5100 Burn baby, burn! The flamethrower geezer goes bonkers and torches a load of his own troops! Don't bother messing around with a couple of troops, build an army and then attack! Take out the enemy soldiers and then raze their HQ to the ground. See, it really is that easy. 3 "


"THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT! computer video games Not every mission in Command & Conquer is won just by wiping out the enemy. Some have assassination objectives in which the target is a high-ranking officer. Others are successfully completed by using the engineers to run in and capture enemy installations. Still, most of the wars are won with big guns, So start building! SCHWARZENEGGER? PAH! You may suppose Command & Conquer doesn't look so hot. Wrong! The in-game graphics may be small. but they're well animated so much so that any soldier torched by a flamethrower staggers around in flames, before slumping to the ground and leaving a pile of ash! More impressive are the slick cut scenes, though, which C&C has by the bucket load. Combining computer.generated images with blue-screened actors, the cut-scenes are more action-packed than a Schwarzenegger movie. $4989 $5048 SATURN MINIGUNNER BARRACKS BUT 1. Erk, right from the word 'GO!\" the home base is under attack by the blummin' Brotherhood of NOD! What are you waiting for soldier, fight back! 2. Luckily the armoured car was quick on the case, and managed to gun down the invaders within seconds! Hmmm, looks like it's time to start repairing the barracks. 1 \"My name is John Schlongdinger. I've been an alcoholic for two years. I like crisps...\" $4844 POWER PLANT $200 MOBILE CONSTRUCTION YARD 3. Just as the last lick of paint is slapped on the barracks, reinforcements arrive in the form of the mobile construction yard and a team of engineers. 4. After base camp is set up it's time to start building a power plant to supply electricity. Meanwhile, enemy troops have been spotted to the north... VIRGINS GAME OF CONQUERS VIRGIN'S GAME OF CONQUERS $2395 5. We need more troops! To meet demands another barracks is constructed, miraculously doubling the recruitment rate. Where do all these blokes come from? 6. That's more like it. Now you've built up a sizable army it's time to charge north and attack the enemy encampment. C'mon lads, go get 'em!  ISHLU COMING SOON GIVE US A HAND 7. Minutes later and most of the enemy sol diers have been 'fragged'. All that remains is to raze their base to the ground. 8. Well done commander! Don't get too cocky though, because this was one of the easiest missions and there's another 24 to go. Ak! Reinforcements come in all shapes and size, from weedy foot troops to marines who walk around with rocket launchers. There's also a Rambo commando who's hard as nails, but still no match for the tanks and armoured cars which appear later in the game. LLLL NEXT MONTH... IT'S WAR! In this scene two actors were filmed against a blue-screen, and the background was added later. The finishing touches are being added to the Saturn version of Command & Conquer as we speak. So far it looks pretty damn good. Keep your eyes peeled for a full review though, which should feature in next month's CVG. 35 "

But why? Here's where you find out... TOTAL:02\" CYBERTROOPERS CYBER TROOPERS BER rom a British point of view, it would appear that the Japanese have a very selective taste in video games. Just about anything with giant robots of preposterous proportions and fighting seems to go down a treat. Which probably explains why Virtual On is one of the most popular arcade games of the moment, and probably the most eagerly awaited Saturn conversions in development. So what's the deal? Well, imagine CyberSled (and some Virtua Fighter overtones) with eight different robots, each kitted out with their own range of weapons battling it out in various cunningly designed battle arenas, and there you have it! ROOM 0592 Maret NEXT ENEMY VR.TEMJIN BIRU PERFECT Sud SER -FLOOBCO CITY SUPER ROBO-BATTLESUIT ACTION! ist. MISSION FOUR MEANS OF DESTRUCTION! Every single Virtual On participant (or Cyber Trooper, if you will) comes equipped with four different means of attack. The two main weapon types are fired off using the A and C buttons on your joypad. You can combine the two (by pressing A and C together) to fire off a truly powerful long-range onslaught. However, by far the most powerful attack is to fight at close range with your light sabre-style plasma sword. This inflicts hideous amounts of damage, leading to kamikaze suicide attacks from foes low on energy! 09192 PLAYER LPLAVER 9 EhEMY 493.1 Bonster SUORTEN BESTE TOTEL.

Take Virtua Fighter but put it in a third-person perspective. Replace those martial arts with long range weapons and introduce plenty of scenery to hide behind and much more running about. That's basically what Virtual On is about, the main objective being to wear down your opponent's energy bar. A really clever thing the coin-op does, which the Saturn version replicates well is the see-through walls trick. Should a building or other such piece of scenery appear to block your view, it becomes \"transparent\", which allows you to see where you are without any unnecessary ugly clipping ruining the graphics.

"computer Video games RE KIFLE Won SATURI 80-9 863 4156 TWO PLAYERS? YES SIR! Virtual On is a game made for two players. Indeed, one of the reasons why not many of the arcade units were sold in Europe is down to the fact that it can only be bought in a two-player sit-down form (and there's a Model 2 board per player used inside, making it even more expensive!). On the Saturn, you can achieve similar two-player effects by making use of the forthcoming NetLink option which will allow you to play Virtual On with people around the world! However, it's more likely that you'll be settling down next to a mate with the game's simultaneous two-player split-screen option (which looks great and doesn't slow the game down). Remember the possibility of the link-up cable being used last month? Forget it Sega of Japan appear to have disowned the cable and aren't planning any games at all for it. Boo. HOW CLOSE IS CLOSE? Now that work on the conversion is finally drawing to a close, we're able to be more specific on just how good this translation of the coin-op is. The good news is that considering that the original Model-2 version of the game is about forty times more expensive than a Saturn with the game, it's very, very close indeed! Here's a point-by-point breakdown: CYBERTROOPS IRUN BOOM! YOU'RE DEAD The arcade version of Virtual On was noted for its immensely impressive polygon conflagrations and generally pyrotechnical excellence. As you can see from the nice pictures below these words, the Saturn version manages to convey almost the same level of impact! 1. SPEED The original arcade game ran at 60 frames per second. This is down to 30 on the Saturn, but it's still very smooth indeed. Just as good as Saturn Sega Rally actually. So, compromises have been made, but nothing you're really going to be too upset about. 3262 Enem PLAYER ETIEMY 2. DETAIL The overall resolution is lower, again like Saturn Sega Rally. More emphasis appears to have been made to make the robots (the central figures in the game after all) closer to the arcade than the backdrops (the Cyber Troopers still have their Saturns plugged into their heads!). A lot of polygons are gone from the backgrounds, but clever use of texture-mapping gives the same overall impression as the arcade. CHARGING 3. TECHNIQUES The Sega AM3 teams pride themselves on retaining everything gameplaywise from the arcade game and from what we've seen so far, it looks as though every move and tactic from the original game works fine! SUPER ROBO-BATTLESUIT ACTION! NISSILE GRENADE 4. EFFECTS The special effects in the arcade game are spectacular! The Saturn does an excellent job of replicating the awesome explosions, although when it comes down to performing the transparencies, the Saturn's unfortunate gauze/net curtain effects (as seen in Wipeout) come to the fore. It still looks very good though. TOTAL DS 2859 In Virtual On, there are so many explosions going off that it's often hard to see where you're going! 5806 Enemy 5835 610S LATER 147. BEAN BIFLE SHOA B ER BIELE Tatr, 02\"SS\" 46 BULUN HAND BEAN The Plasma Sword inflicts what could be termed 'devastating damage' at close range.

This kind of spectacular visual effect is just one of many in Virtual On. Great! Compare Saturn Sega Rally to its coin-op parent. It's not quite as clear or as smooth, but everything else is brilliant, yes? Well expect the same thing with Virtual On potentially a world class conversion and wonderfully playable! Also expect loads of hidden extras not seen in the arcade original! IKKE 39 "

Visually Realms of the Haunting is similar to Hexen and indeed Quake, what with its extremely detailed 3D environment, but there's much more to this than all-out blasting. It's a full blown graphic adventure, and as such is crammed with mindbending puzzles that'll fox even the brainiest of gamers. It's not all boring problem-solving though, and ROTH has more than it's fair share of hack 'n' slay HORROR STORY One of the strongest features of Realms of the Haunting is its storyline, which follows the plight of Adam Randall as he delves deeper into the mysteries of his father's death. The game contains almost two hours of full-motion video, divided into short clips which detail Adam's progress. Like Wing Commander III, ROTH uses a combination of blue-sceened actors and computer-generated backgrounds, seamlessly blending the two for the end result. HELL-SPAWN Brain-taxing puzzles aren't the only obstruction that stands between Adam and success, as the house is plagued with all manner of fanged nasties and creatures of the night. From sword-swinging beasties to giant hellhounds, this is not a place you want to hang around after dark. Like the game environment itself, the monsters are completely 3D, and look pretty darn smart actually. All these rooms are You can just pull realtime 3D generated, your gun out and shoot moving around in that and stuff, but you need Doom-like way. to do more than that. Seamlessly blended stuff! Obviously, ROTH creator, Tony Crowther, is a fan of Ed Lomas. O COMING SOON Exploring areas like Cor, looks good this bookshelf is done enough to eat, don't using a novel point-andyou think? Well, to live click interface. in, anyway. NEXT MONTH... ROTH IS COMING TO GET YOU! Cor, it looks real, dunnit? Realms of the Haunting is currently enduring rigorous testing, and Gremlin Interactive is fine-tuning what it hopes is going to be the scariest adventure of the year. So far it looks like they've succeed but will the final version be as horrific? We'll see next month, so are you ready for the fright of your life? "

"computer video games SHOOT 'EM UP BY INTERACTIVE 80% COMPLETE  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED STORAGE 1 CD TM PlayStation DEC RELEASE 1-2 BUFFOONS  RELEASED BY BMG TEL: 0171 973 0011 PlayStation You can just tell, by its totally wacky name, that this game's gonna be keraazy. Firo and Klawd. Haw haw haw, we're laughing already! FIRO AND KLAWD kay, deep breaths. We can't let the total hilarity of this game consume us without first dishing out some hard facts about it. We last covered Firo and Klawd in the New Games section of issue 175. And in that fun-packed little feature, we gave you the lowdown on how Firo is an orangutan police officer and Klawd is a street cat hoodlum. An unlikely partnership, forced to work together to defeat a counterfeit money operation by the hard-nosed Crocodero Mob (they're crocodiles) in the crimeridden New Yak City. Outrageously hilarious stuff as you can tell. And surely deserved of the name Firo and Klawd. Snort, guffaw! GUN-HO-HOI COME LAUGH AT FIRO AND CLAWD WITH US! FUNNY MOTION VIDEO Cut through the thick overcoat of laughs, and what you have underneath is an isometric shoot 'em up. Two players can join together (playing as Firo and Klawd see?) and wander New Yak City, gunning down everyone in sight. There's a variety of weapons that can be collected, fists can be employed, and grenades thrown. All in 360 degree fashion. If you didn't know, Firo and Klawd is the work of Interactive Studios, the people behind the classically popular Dizzy games. About an egg. Interactive are clearly hoping to establish two more legendary gaming characters in Firo and Klawd, because an amazing amount of effort has been put into the presentation of the game. There's over 30 minutes of computergenerated FMV. Much of which goes into the lengthy intro, detailing how Klawd steals money from the mob and accidently passes it on to police officer Firo. There's also cut scenes, furthering the plot when you reach the end of certain sections. Multiple endings are also included to spice it all up. Crazy gun action on the streets of New Yak City. Nothing to laugh about, you'd think. And you'd be right too. * BACKGROUND LAUGHTERIX Firo and Klawd's landscapes are actually large 2D backdrops which extend far beyond the size of the screen. Starting in the city streets, our dynamic duo can wander down into the subway, or off to a bar (known as 'Beers', as in 'Cheers'). From here, new scenery is loaded in before the game continues. Giving the game a more three-dimensional realistic feel, there's all sorts of moving things on screen. Cars continuously zoom around the roads, fire hydrants can be blown up and even things like traffic cones and bar stools can be knocked around. Za-a-aany! COMING SOON NEXT MONTH... COMEDY HALF HOUR RETURNS! That wacky comedy duo should be back for their barrel-full-of-laughs review. Is the game a hilarious rollercoaster of action, or a pooey egg of a bad joke? We can't wait to find out. 5 1 Comical goings on in New Yak City. "

"more games CHECKPOINT This is one of the biggest months for a long time! All of the major Christmas releases from all of the major companies, as well as some of the biggest shows of the year, in the gaming capital of the world Japan! The month's events and software releases at a glance. Nov-Dec SHOSHINKAI E3: TOKYO t's the month before Christmas, and that's when all the software companies start warming up their big seasonal releases. Crash Bandicoot makes his big debut on PlayStation, and Destruction Derby 2 hits the road running. Meanwhile, racing onto the Saturn is Daytona Circuit Edition, together with Virtua Cop 2 and Virtual On. Command and Conquer: Red Alert hits the PC too! EA have also got Soviet Strike ready in the wings, Eidos have Tomb Raider finally ready for release, GT have Mortal Kombat Trilogy and Codemasters are ready with the stunning Micro Machines 3, all on PlayStation. Meanwhile, Duke Nukem 3D is down for an early December release on both PlayStation and Saturn, but we haven't seen anything of them yet, so don't count on that happening. And what of the Capcom stuff? Well, take a close look and you'll see PlayStation Star Gladiator there, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 on Saturn and PS, lined up for immediate release. All this, and a full month of shows revealing more incredible software for the year ahead. Things just ain't never not looked so good for games ever before! 24-26 November (Makuhari Messe Centre, Tokyo) Everyone knows what happened at last year's Shoshinkai show the Nintendo 64 was shown to the world for the first time. This year's show promises to be packed full of amazing Nintendo products, including a possible appearance of the 64DD and Zelda 64! Big games like Mario Kart R, F-Zero 64, and Yoshi's Island 64 will hopefully also be on display, letting us know exactly how good Christmas is going to be for Nintendo in Japan. We'll have a full show report as soon we get back. 1-4 November (Makuhari Messe Centre, Tokyo) Following the success of the Los Angeles E3 in April, the Electronic Entertainment Expo is making a second appearance, this time in Tokyo. Nintendo aren't going to be there (they're saving their stuff for Shoshinkai), so there's more room for the other big players. Sega aren't supposed to be planning anything grand, but other developers (Capcom, for instance) will be showing their Saturn stuff. Of course, with the PlayStation Expo in the same arena, there'll be plenty of PS conferences. And hopefully M2 stuff too! PLAYSTATION EXPO: '96-'97 WANT SOME FREE GAMES 2. EVENTS AND SOFTWARE RELEASES 1-4 November (Makuhari Messe Centre, Tokyo) Last year's PS Expo gave us Tekken 2, Jumping Flash 2, Kings Field, Dracula Detective and Kowloons Gate, but this year's promises to be even better! For a start, it's running over four days instead of last year's two, as well as being held at the Makuhari Messe in Japan, which is double the size of last year's venue. Namco are planning to unveil both Soul Edge and Rage Racer there, two games which could be absolutely massive for the company, while Square are likely to make a big deal out of Final Fantasy VII. We're also expecting a first real look at Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) from Capcom, and possibly even a version of Street Fighter Gaiden (Street Fighter 3D). Of course, CVG is going to be there and we'll be reporting on everything in next month's issue. Well come get some!

"computer video games This year once again saw the greatest in arcade shows, with the 34th Amusement Machine Show. At the Makuhari Messe centre the world's gaming elite gathered to display their latest arcade games to the world. The 34th AMUSEMENT MACHINE SHOW DATE: September 12th-14th VENUE: Makuhari Messe Centre, Tokyo, Japan THE REAL FUTURE! JAMMA CAPCOM f what you've been used to seems like the limit of gaming achievement, prepare to be blasted away by the real power of the arcade: Every major arcade manufacturer has embarked on a battle for arcade supremacy by secretly developing it's own state-of-the-art high-technology hardware! The full force of JAMMA  is the like of which you have never seen before! With power to torch your Playstation, Saturn or N64 to ashes these games aren't likely for conversion any time soon. So standby for action as the super-game systems of the future battle for the accolade of Ultimate Next Generation Game! Lets look at the competition: RELD ARNET MONSTERS In the scenaria mode there are eight deadly monsters to defeat. At the start of each stage a world map is shown. The world is divided into several regions, each under the power of one of these terrible monsters. At first, all the regions are red. As you defeat each monster it's region changes to grey. Unfortunately not all the details regarding the monsters have been revealed.  Capcom 1996 AM SHOW JAMMA KONAMI Hardware: Cobra Game: GTI Club, PF573 Project As well as the brilliant GTI Club, Konami had a pre-demo version of a 3D fighting game, with graphical power at least equal to Sega's Model 3 board. CAPCOM Hardware: CP-SYSTEM 3 Game: Red-Earth, Street Fighter 3 Proving sprite technology can advance just as much as 3D polygons, Capcom finally showed the future of fighting games with the amazing RedEarth. JAMMA proved to be the first real opportunity to savour a near complete version of Red Earth the Western version of War-Zard which we featured in issue #179. Significant because it is Capcom's first title powered by the new CPSystem III technology, we now have a better idea of the plot details, and all-important play mechanics. This game is still unfinished, so there may still be changes. However it is shaping up to be MONSTER exciting!!! KONGOU [Zipang Stage a burning vil lage near a Volcano] A Demon-Troll with huge spiked club. Has an amazing attack where his hair stretchs out and stabs you. LAVIA [Gora Stage set high in the mountains] The Harpy. Uses her wings to fly around the screen and shoot deadly feathers at you. SEGA Hardware: Model 3 Game: Virtua Fighter 3, Virtua On 2? Still the best game around. The final version in all it's magnificance was certainly the focal point of the show a clear demonstration of the future of arcade gaming. TAITO Hardware: TOP-SECRET Game: G-Darius Taito were also showing a demo of their first game to unleash the power of their new board. The next in the series of the incredible Darius series is now in 3D! & * CHARACTERS In either game mode there are four player characters to choose from: TESSA A beautiful young witch seeking to create a modern science of Super-Magic by blending ancient and modern magic techniques! Her weapon is forged from the magic of her own creation! HAUZER [Savalia Stage based on ancient Greece) A huge T-Rex with tiny wings, bird feet and ram's horns. Tends to leap in the air and crush you or charge with it's horns. SNK Hardware: TOP-SECRET Game: TOP-SECRET Imagine how the some of SNK's best fighting games of all time would look if they had even more power to run them! Well SNK's new board is coming soon! GIGI [Crypt Stage based on an ancient Aztec temple) The Stone Idol. Has four arms each with a massive sword the size of your body which all swing around like helicopter blades! NAMCO Hardware: TOP-SECRET Game: Tekken 3? To everyone's surprise Tekken 3 wasn't unveiled at the show, so we can't reveal much but we'll all betting that Tekken 3 will be the first game on it! MAI LING Mai Ling is a spirited girl living in Gora, a nation based on war. Her weapons are her extraordinarly keen fighting-sense and the flamrings she wears on her legs. GULIVE) LEO A half man, half lion warrior, armed with only a sword and shield who sets out alone for the mysterious empire in order to win back his stolen human form and the liberation of his country. L KENJI The head of the Ramon clan of assassins, which has been the secret protector for generations of the Tokugawa Shogun dynasty. A master of the Rasetsu style of ninja techniques. HYDRON [Icelarn Stage set in the arctic snowlands] The Nautilus. Can smash his tentacles down through the ice and then smash them back up again right underneath you. RAVANGE [Sangypt Stage based on ancient Egypt) The Sphynx. With it's four animal heads (Dragon, Ram, Lion and Falcon) and snake tail its range of attacks is stunning! Darminor Stage: UNKNOWN! Varuda Stage: UNKNOWN! 52 "


"computer video games THE DREAM OUIZ OF SEVEN COLOURS  You only have to look at the name to know this game offers more action than you ever thought possible! Boasting superlative game play and graphics that must be pushing CP-System Il to the limit, XMEN vs Street Fighter became one of the most popular games of the show you really had to wait a long time to get a game. Most people agreed that CAPCOM had got the balance right between the mutant X-MEN and the more human Street Fighters. Graphically, everyone was stunned that they'd been able to squeeze a game as great as this out of the CP-System II. An interesting new love quiz game, in which you are trying to collect seven shards of a crystal that are scattered around a small town. To retrieve them you must romance the seven young women who have become one with the crystal shards. The game system is based around a roulette wheel where you must use good timing to stop the ball on the square you want. Depending on the square, the course you take through the story changes. There are various problems to solve, and a variety of courses to take. 13VER! Shidat L EGEyny STREET FIGHTER EX NEW FEATURES * The control method remains faithful to the SF series: eight-direction joystick, plus six buttons. As you can see from the profiles, all the popular moves have been retained and from what we can tell are performed exactly the same as before. There are, however, some intriguing original features. Bear in mind that members of the Arika team created Street Fighter 2. So what's okay with them is fine with us! While no details are available on the kind of hardware being used to support the game, the results are nonetheless spectacular. It is genuinely exciting to see Street Fighter favourites Ryu, ken, Chun Li, and Zangief presented in this new way. Also on display at Capcom's stand was the much anticipated 3D polygon variaton on the Street Fighter theme. This game is being developed by a team called Arika, whose interview provides the main feature in FreePlay this issue. First impressions were slightly unsure because graphically it's still quite basic compared to other 3D games available. However, all those who played it agreed that the game-play was something quite special and indeed seeing your favourite 2D Street Fighter characters fighting in 3D is an amazing experience! Guard Break To increase the excitement of each round there is now a Guard Break technique, which momentarily demolishes an opponent's defense for the price of one block on the Super Combo Gauge. Super Combo Secret...!!! A new feature is promised which makes use of the Super Combo Gauge. So, alongside the regular Super Combos, expect something unique to Street Fighter EX when the game is completed!    Capcom.

They wanted to get it perfect so they choose the standard riding version (as opposed to Namco's standing version). Due to their close cooperation with Yamaha the feedback of wave bounces and landing in the water after going over a ramp is really powerful. You really feel like you're on the ocean. This game came as a complete surprise and everybody was amazed at how good Sega's first attempt was. Obviously competing with Namco's Alpine Racer 2 there are many simularities however until we have further details the jury will have to wait. Wave Runner is sponsored by Yamaha. KONAMI GTI CLUB 45 DIN 10/54'554 GANIVE) Konami's new race game is set in a beautiful resort area located in the South of France. Eight rally cars compete in each race with up to four of them controllable by the players, with the others driven by the CPU. There are several unique game features: Side Break Quick Turn a technical rally term referring to a manoeuvre used with these small FF (Front Engine, Front Drive) sports cars. The use of which gives GTI Club a new kind of driving feel. A 'Free Course Map' reffers to where, at each and every city street crossroads, you can freely choose any course across them. Weaving between the other vehicles, cutting across the traffic (one picture sees you cutting up a huge bus), you can even go the wrong way down the road! Basically you have total freedom! GTI Club appears to have redefined the car racing game for years to come! GO AHEAD There were always massive crowds around this game. Even those not playing could enjoy the game as it's so open and free that the players always seem to take totally unexpected routes. Certainly, the big hit of the show for CVG! 54 "


"SOLAR ASSAULT GRADIUS WINDING HEAT computer video games For all of Konami's fans who've been dreaming about the latest version of the Gradius Series the wait is over. We're unable to go into great detail at the moment but in general the game is a behind view 3D shooting game. The scale is big with huge 3D objects being moved around the screen. There's a power-up gauge and collectable capsules to power it up. Along with the ever popular \"Vic Viper\" (armed with missile and laser) is the equally famous \"Lord British\" (armed with spread bomb and cyclone laser). Lately it's become trendy in race games to have a variety of road surfaces, which means you have to choose the most appropriate car and tune it up to match the conditions. Konami have combined all these elements to make the ultimate racing game: Winding Heat! With 14 cars to choose from, and a variety of tune up options there are plenty of variations to keep bringing you back again and again. There are three course difficulty settings, from High Speed to Technical. Drive against competitors or compete in the Time Attack. The link cable allows up to four people to play at one time. With a huge variety of features such as rear-view mirror, selectable viewpoint, car configuration (Grip, Accel, Max Speed etc) this has to be the most comprehensive racing game yet. View from inside and out of the car. NAMCO 08 Az 1920 Released last year, Tokyo Wars has undergone some improvements and now it's back again. The major differences in this new version are that it's become four-player so you can have team battles, and secondly the control handle has recoil built into it. To refresh your memory, each player can choose either the Green Army or the White Army, then either compete or cooperate with each other to win the game. Each army is composed of between 12 to 30 tanks, who all fight against Bay Area a container yard on the Tokyo Bay, the other until all tanks of either small and simple, suitable for learning how to army are destroyed, or time runs out drive the tank! Down Town the complexity of Tokyo metropolis with it's wide and narrow streets, elevated railways, skyscrapers, roadside trees and signs. 10 ALPINE RACER 2 AM SHOW JAMMA Sequel to last years massive hit. This time there are two new features. Firsty, via the comunication cable, there is a two player mode. In Race Mode, players chase each other down the slopes with the CPU balancing speed to keep things competitive. In Time Trial Mode, players race at the same time and the difference of the player's skill is reflected as it is. Secondly, there are two new courses: High Speed Course (Novice & Intermediate) where skiers speed down the route designed as an extension of the usual ski slope (also suitable for two players). The Technical Course (Expert) where skiers enter dynamic challenges such as races along the edge of a precipice, a mountain road, or city street where people cannot usually ski a very difficult landform that expert players can really enjoy! Best for one player but two players are possible. At the show Alpine Racer 2 was only 40% complete, so expect some big improvements in the graphics and gameplay before it's released. DANCING EYES nano AQUA JET Unlike the Nintendo/ Kawasaki and the Sega/ Yamaha partnerships Namco have seemingly gone it alone as there appears to be no sponsorship involved. Nevertheless they have managed to capture all the realism of the sport. The jet ski pitches, rolls and yaws according to the condition. Unlike Sega's Wave Runner, where you sit down, Namco have opted for the stand-up version. Machines are controlled by shifting weight to swing a step. This makes for a challenging game as it requires more skill to remain balanced. namco A completely new type of puzzle game. Basically, you control a monkey which climbs around a woman removing the outer layer of her clothing to reveal what she's wearing underneath! To remove the panels you first place a marker at one corner of any panel, then trace a line around the edges of as many panels as you wish before finally returning to the orig. inal marker. At this point all the panels enclosed within your line are removed from the outer layer exposing the person inside. Also moving around the outer layer are an ever-increasing number of enemies, who you must avoid at all costs! Of course there are various tactics involved especially in the use of the various items which appear. These items all have different effects such as Speed-Up, Paralyze Enemy, etc. BE LG FEATURE  Konami.  Namco 1996 95 STAGE EAR TAGE namco It's not always women there's also a man and a cow.

"computer video games ATLUS TAITO PUZZLE BOBBLE 3 ULTIMATE DOMAIN Ultimate Domain uses SEGA's Model 2 board to create a high quality 3D polygon fighting game. The game has eight characters of which three are women. Although it uses the traditional one lever and three buttons ATLUS say it doesn't necessarily mean that the combat system is going to be simple, so look out for the possibility of some interesting derivatives on the traditional Virtua Fighter style game. The JAC (Japan Action Club) participated in the motion capture stage of this project to create a large number of very flash looking techniques. One of most important aspects of this game is the SOL-POWER feature where characters can utilise the sun's solar power to charge up super sure killing techniques. Each character has a special power depicted by a 2nd gauge underneath the life gauge. Ultimate Domain shows promise of being a really original game. Puzzle Bobble is back! Choose from eight unique characters and battle against a friend or the computer over a massive range of bubble layout variations (30 stages/560 rounds)! There are several exciting and fantastic new features: New Technique: Deflect from the ceiling as well as the sides New Item: the Rainbow Bubble burst a bubble next to the Rainbow Bubble and it changes to the colour of the burst bubble. New Feature: Puzzle Mode, where some kind of bubble puzzle slowly advances down the screen. Brilliant! HITS STROKE FIGHTERS' IMPACT The game play in Fighter's Impact is pretty straightforward. There's one lever and three buttons Shift, Punch and Kick but Taito added a whole range of special features to make it rather unique: 1. Latest motion capture technology for added realism. 2. All eight characters have three choices of fighting style (except Yukiwo who has only one) 3: Build your own original combo, where certain attacks in the right sequence creates an amazing combo! 4. The Shift buttton allows for a number of special evasive manoeuvers with the lever. Worth investigating. PRINCESS CLUB: BIG OPERATION AM SHOW JAMMA A diagonally scrolling action game. The three characters are Kurara, Kirara and Grey. Although there's plenty of fighting, the story is a comical fantasy and the characters are super cute. This game also is scheduled for a Saturn release, but don't pass up the arcade version. Such super smooth animation and the amazing special effects are unlikely to survive the conversion without a drop in quality. Bonsor 50 YUKWOT SNK floring Proving once again that they have plenty of good ideas up their GETIXID MOD AB sleeves SNK had a number of attractions at their booth. The MFX2000 is a simulator ride seating six people with a huge 72-inch screen a great experience! SNK also had a curious game which involves you moving a metal bar around a course.

Finally, SNK's new cabinet design now contains a video camera and TV screen! It's connected directly to your opponents cabinet so that you can see each other while you're playing. Great fun when you're with a friend because you l pull stupid faces when you beat them! Also on show was their football game. Ultimate 11. Tod's SIDE BY SIDE A race game in which TAITO go for realism not just in handling, but looks as well. All eight cars in SIDE BY SIDE are based on marketed cars, two cars from each of four manufacturers Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mazda. The performance of each car reflects that of the real car so some are quicker than others, depending on the course you choose. Each course represents one of the four sea sons: SPRING a high speed course suitable for beginners, in which cherry blossoms lining the road. SUMMER a slightly more challenging course perfect for intermediate drivers, set next to the seashore. AUTUMN you'll need to have mastered professional skidding to handle the narrow roads and a series of tricky corners which characterise this leafy forest. WINTER for superexperts, requiring a whole range of new driving skills in the snow. The four-player option is fun. Ranking FEATURE Only experts will be able to handle the cars in the icy WINTER course. SAMURAI SHOWDOWN IV Witness these incredible new Sure Killing Techniques that have characterised the series from the beginning! As far as sprite based games go, Samurai Spirits is among the most OTT there is. Not much info on this yet as it's still under development. It's the next sequel to the hugely popular Samurai Showdown series. This time there are 12 characters from Samurai Showdown 3, another three characters from even older versions of Samurai Showdown, and two completely new characters making a total of 17 player characters! Both the effectiveness of the weapon and level setting are selectable so both beginners and experts can enjoy playing it. More on this soon.  Taito.  Atlus.  SNK 1996  "


"computer video games KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE SUN SOFT WAKU WAKU 7 Sequel to '95s Kizuna Encounter, this time with an all new game system: One player can choose two characters (the tag system). On a normal MVS only one player can control at a time, but on the Special MVS version you can have 1P+1P VS 2P+2P and 2 players only have to put in one credit! Some of the other combinations are 1P+1P VS 2P, 1P+1P VS COM etc. The control system uses one lever and 4 buttons: Punch, Kick, Weapon, and Tag. Tagging is fairly simple: So long as you are in your tag area then when both characters touch they can tag to change places. Where there are two players in team the waiting character isn't left idle. While tapping on the button he can increase his health by restoring your life gauge. However, the more times you tag the effectiveness becomes less and less. There is also an emergency tag, operated by the waiting character if three conditions are met: 1. Your partner's bar is almost empty 2. your opponent's bar is over half full, and 3. your partner is in your tag zone. Probably the best 'tag' game available. Waku Waku is a Japanese word which describes the feeling of your heart beating fast because of excitement. Each time you clear a stage you get a special Waku Waku Ball which is then added to your Waku Waku gauge. You can collect up to a maximum of 7 balls. These are used to activate four features: Utilise a character's unique attack technique, break down an opponent's guard, power-up a sure killing technique or enter Super Mode. All characters have a wonderful collection of special attacks and 'deformed' animation patterns. It's big, bright and colourful with excellent animation in the true tradition of a CAPCOM production. This one-on-one fighting game is very similar to Capcom's Vampire/ Darkstalkers series in style outlandish fantasy characters and superb animation.  SNK.  Hudson.  Tecmo.  SunSoft.  Jaleco. 1996 HUDSON NEO BOMBERMAN O MELO 701 1-1-1 CHANGE At last he's back in the arcade! There are two modes. In the Normal Mode everything you could imagine from the Saturn version is there, but the scale is much bigger with even more in-depth game play. There are ten types of vehicles which are spawned from defeated enemies. Also, if you rescue your companions who are trapped in a cell, they can fight along side you. When all have been helped to safety you win! This time all the enemies have artifical intelligence to refine and improve their fighting strategies depending on your tactics and skill. This is done to make your life more difficult as their increasing smartness will be a source of great annoyance. In total there are five stages to be completed. All your favorite characters are here with their real voices taken from J-TV. AM SHOW JAMMA TECMO SPERRETERO51525 JALECO DEAD OR ALIVE At the show it still wasn't quite finished as Tecmo were still in the final stages of fine tuning, however, at the Tecmo Game Live show (see main news section) they unveiled the final version. Japanese dedicated Arcade magazine Gamest has been avidly following this fighting game for the past few months, so expect the final result to be fairly awesome. Tecmo also had their 3D polygon horse racing game Gallop Racer. 989 SECOND EARTH GRATIA Proving that there's still life in this genre of olden days Jaleco are fighting back with their latest offering, Second Earth Gratia! With incredible ships and background design they've generated a brilliant 3D effect to the game. By utilising the latest high quality 3D graphics technology they've tilted the typical horizontal scrolling game so that it's got true depth and perspective! This makes playing the game alot easier and much more fun judging angles, distances, and the size of objects is much more intuitive, so your shooting is much more precise. A decent shoot'em up still pulls in a fair amount of cash. GEATURE Sequences like these make it worth sticking in 50p just to see how it plays. 57 "

Mortal Kombat Trilogy's got loads of new characters, new moves, new combos, hidden features, and much more, making it one of the most packed-full fighting games ever. Of course, there's do doubt at all as to whether Mortal Kombat fans will like this they'll absolutely adore it but it's not likely to hook anyone who didn't care about Ultimate MK3. It's still got an excellent sense of humour, is fast, fun, and almost overflowing with features, but the fighting action just isn't as smooth and clever as SF Alpha 2. Mortal Kombat Trilogy is in fact a good example of the PlayStation's 2D spritehandling capabilities which have been criticised in the past, handling some massive characters, storing up to four fighters in memory at once and changing them around with no loading times, as well as throwing tons of body parts and blood splats around the screen at once!

Behold the ultimate incarnation of Capcom's greatest series from out of the arcade, into your home!!! PlayStation 93 he Street Fighter series goes from strength to strength. Considering the quality of Street Fighter 2, you can only expect the quality of the Alpha series to be better, some five years on. The first Alpha rewrote the game engine of the series, giving a subtly different style of play to the games before it. Alpha 2 uses an identical engine, but gives everything a massive overhaul new characters; increased speed; more moves; an all-new combo system; and loads more, give even the most devout of Street Fighter fans a real challenge. Just a few months after the arcade release of this amazing game, we have almost arcade-perfect home versions! Wowzer! NIPEX HIGHES VENDATID EST CV Zangief finishing Ryu off with an impressive Custom Combo explosion! CALLING ALL CHALLENGERS The excellent arcade intro is featured in both versions, and sets the scene well, with some lovely artwork of the new characters. NEW ALPHA FIGHTER SI ZANGIEF There are five new characters to Street Fighter Alpha 2: Zangief and Dhalsim from the Street Fighter 2 series; Gen from the original Street Fighter, Rolento from Final Fight, and the completely original Sakura. While they may take a bit of getting used to, and they may have wildly varying styles, they fit in with the other Street Fighter characters perfectly. This Super Combo catches jumping enemies and tosses them onto the floor. It doesn't look very impressive, plus it's very hard to catch someone properly with it. Zangief's new, more cartoony style makes him look even more amazing than before! All of his old moves remain: Spinning Lariats; Flaming Fist (now a Dragon Punch motion), and, of course, the Spinning Piledriver! Because of his lack of speed and 'chaining' powers, people seem to neglect poor old 'Gief, though he is one of the most powerful characters in the game. 201600 0 0 PRESS START The Final Atomic Buster is performed the same as ever (720¬∞ degree spin, then punch).

He also uses the Yoga Flame, Yoga Yoga Inferno (double Fire, the vertical Yoga Flame, and fireball and punch) sprays Yoga Teleport (which can now be flame around, hitting done in the air). repeatedly at close range. This strange Super Throw catches opponents mid-air, and repeatedly slams them into the floor. 62  Capcom 1995/1996 "


"SAKURA A PLUSI EXTRA CHARACTERSI computer video games Sakura is a big fan of Ryu, so most of her moves are based on his. Her fireball is charged up by repeatedly tapping the punch button at the end of the motion, makIng it bigger and more powerful while reducing the range. A Dragon Punch variant makes her dash forwards a long way, hitting repeatedly. Sakura's Hurricane Kick motion makes her hop forwards with a spinning kick (shouting what sounds like \"Duke Nukem!\"). As well as the 18 standard characters, there are another five variations of existing fighters.

What makes him so different from the other Street Fighters is that he's got two fighting stances: Mantis style (fists) and Crane style (feet). Each has its own special attacks, Super Combos, and standard hits making Gen a very difficult character to master. He has an E.Honda-style multiple slap, a dashing punch, a rapid-hitting forward kick, and a wall leap attack, as well as some very strange \"standard\" hits. GOUKI GOUKI MANTIS CRANE 1 A double fireball and punch causes this dashing hit which leaves Gen on the opposite side of his opponent.

A lot of Rolento's moves are like SF2's Vega, with quick wall leaps and annoying rolls to get him out of trouble, making him a difficult opponent to hit. Overall, Rolento takes a bit of getting used to but is very effective in the end, especially to naturally defensive players. This rapid punch leaves a timer above the opponent's head.

After beating each of the fighters, energy is added to your single bar depending on how well you did in that fight, meaning that consistency is essential. Also the whole thing is timed, so Survival Mode becomes a time attack game! How quickly can you clear all 18 on level 8?

NEW MOVES FOR OLD FIGHTERS 2700 1918 Gouki (Akuma) and Gen face off in Venice. As well as having all of the moves from the original Alpha, many of the characters have had new moves and other slight adjustments made to the way they play. For example, Adon's \"D to UF+K\" move has been changed to a Dragon Punch motion; Birdie's Super Combo is now a double fireball and punch rather than a 720 spin; Akuma s air fireballs drop at a very sharp angle and his golden fireball is a reverse motion: Chun-Li's fireballs don't need to be charged any more: Sodom's three different sai hits are now Fireball motions rather than Dragons; and Dan has been partly redrawn with loads of new animations. COOL COUNTER SI SODOM can catch jumping opponents with a dragon punch motion and any kick, tossing them away without taking damage. Alpha Counters are one of the major new features added to the Street Fighter series, enabling players to discourage jumping attacks by returning the force of the hit in an impressive fashion. In Alpha 2 there's no problem trying to remember whether your character uses punch or kick to counter as everyone can perform both! This means that jumping attacks which hit early can be punch countered, while deep attacks can be kick countered, catching players just before they land.

Your fighter 'powers up' and a time bar appears, which rapidly runs out. During this brief period, the recovery time is removed from every attack, meaning that you can string together impossible combos of standard attacks and special moves.

THE TROPHY CABINET And here are all the Custom Combo finish symbols for everyone... Street Fighter Alpha introduced the novelty of different win symbols depending on the type of victory. Street Fighter Alpha 2 takes this to the limit, adding loads of new symbols to indicate the type of victory, as well as a specific icon for each character's Custom Combo finish. ADON BIRDIE CHUN LI Ever since the days of Street Fighter 2 in the early nineties I have followed the series with great anticipation and high expectation for each new release, and i would say that alongside Super Street Fighter Turbo, Alpha 2 is the best sequel yet to this ever-improving fighting game. Alpha 2 refines the gameplay of its predecessor and adds to the elements which made SF Alpha special, with more counters, massive combos and even tighter gameplay. You can now even combine super and custom combos for awesome devastation. I really can't recom mend this game any more highly. My only concerns, however, are the large \"designer borders and the slightly slower gameplay compared to the Japanese version. But this doesn't really affect the gameplay, as it now has eight speed settings. Roll on Alpha 3, because I want Blanka, Guile. Retsou, Vega and Sheng Long etc, right this minute!!!

Like many people, my first impression of SF Alpha was that it was a step back from SSF2 Turbo. Of course, after a bit of play I realised that it was in fact one of the best games ever.

There are stacks of meaty puzzles to tuck into, some which are solved simply by playing around with the various objects in the inventory, while others can be worked out by conversing with the other characters in the game. A bit like the crystal maze when you think about it... Broken Sword proves that the PlayStation isn't just good for beat 'em ups and arcade games. It's a challenging adventure, and one that is as enjoyable to look at as it is to play. In terms of size Broken Sword is massive, and takes hours to complete. Thankfully it's not too frustrating either, and the solutions to the puzzles are fairly logical, so at least adventurers aren't forced to randomly play around with objects in the hope that something works the solution is usually nearby. Admittedly it's not as zany as Discworld, but it's compelling nonetheless. 1 C'est m'sieur en la hat trots dans le cafe et sit un a stool.

DAYTONA -Circuit EditionU S A hings move pretty fast in the world of Sega development. Following last month's rolling start first look at the all-new suped-up version of Daytona, we were intending to bring you an in-depth preview of the game this issue. But it wasn't to happen. Nope, instead we've got the game for review! Sega's CS Team have pulled out all the stops to complete their Daytona Remix, and now they've rolled out the finished product. So how does it fare? Have they overcome the infamous clipping problems of the previous game? Have they upped the frame rate? Can we expect yet more karaoke-howling tunes? What new features have been included? These questions and more are all answered on these pages as we reveal to you the long-awaited Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition! teIN Dr IT'S NOT AN ARCADE CONVERSION! If you were hoping for a much-improved conversion of the titanic arcade game, you're in for a bit of a shock. Clearly the CS Team consider last year's Saturn Daytona to be the ONLY conversion of the coin-op, because Circuit Edition is very much their own vision of the game. Bear this in mind as we offload a few ice-cold shocks onto you! A S -Circuit Edition-U PLEASE SELECT A STEERING MECHANISM! HELLO JACK, GOT A NEW MOTOR! The only real way to play original Saturn Daytona was with a joypad (the then-newly released Arcade Racer wheel was compatible, but awful). Now however, you've got a real choice of control systems. Here's how they handle... GALLOP HORNET STARTIT Ready for the news? The legendary red-and-blue arcade 41 car is gone at least as we know it. Instead there are now eight all-new cars to choose from, all featuring new bodyshells and individual performance. And each one is available as a manual or automatic transmission model for your driving enjoyment! HYRNEN GENTLEMEN START YOUR ENGINES REPLAY Good grip and acceleration, with reasonable max speed. Not that you'd know. Identical to the Gallop in all respects. Except for the paintwork. Nice to have the choice, mind. MAGIC MAX ORIOLES 17/30 ROLLIN ORIGINAL FLAVOUR JOYPAD Shockingly, the original joypad isn't so great for this game. The cars in CCE handle quite differently from previously. Powersliding seems virtually non-existent with this controller. magic Reasonable allrounder, but slightly lacking in acceleration. Not a popular choice. Superb grip and acceleration, but crap max speed. Good for two-player on boost. Below average grip, but very good top speed and acceleration make this an excellent choice. 15115TC TEA 20 ARCADE RACER STEERING WHEEL Certainly performs better than in the first Daytona, with more analogue response. Still inadequate for serious racing though, as you veer left and right like a mad granny. For laughs only! PHOENIX WOLF BALANCE HONE ANALOGUE CONTROLLER The essential steering mechanism. You get a much better degree of control from the A-pad, snaking, the car left and right with precision ease. And suddenly, semi-controlled powersliding exists!

L'ECOUTE LE MUSIQUE PLOP! AWAITING YOUR ENTRY! REVIEW Arcade Daytona IS the greatest multiplayer racing game. Which made the first Saturn conversion incredibly disappointing for one reason it was single player only. Well, Circuit Edition features that all-important Two Player Battle mode, although only as a split-screen option. The result is a mixed bag. Graphically it's pretty shoddy with bad pop-up. To play though, it's quite entertaining, providing you use analogue pads. They're essential to get that fender-scraping degree of battle control! Personally we (the CVG hive brain), thought the original Daytona tunes composed by Sega Japan in-house band, B-Univ were entertaining in a laughable kind of way. But who cares what we think? Clearly not Sega, who've enlisted the musical talents of Sega composers across the world, to revamp the soundtrack. The three main tunes have been remixed King Of Speed (track one) and Sky High (track three) are now spacey dance tunes, while Let's Go Away (track two) is like hill-billy rock or something. The two new courses feature some jazzy music. National Park's being more like Jamiroquai, whereas Desert City soundslik the theme to Are You Being Served? (according to Richard Leadbetter, but he's right). As for the rest of the in-game music, get ready for some dreadful rock courtesy of Eric Martin of the band Mr B ig. B-Univ come back. we always loved ya! ACCELONI A twin rolling start begins the epic splitscreen two-player battle. It's good fun, but the bad clipping is a bit of a letdown. Second player headstart, and Slowcar Boost options are in there. 70 "

The panoramic TV cam replays really demonstrate how much technically better the graphics of the sequel are. That IS impressive! SO COMMENT 12/20 CHEAT CORNER ERES 235 Original Daytona was famed for the wealth of | secrets it contained. How many of these have made it into the pseudo-sequel? Let's see... HIDDEN MUSIC? Like almost every other arcade fan, I think that Daytona USA is brilliant. And even though the first Saturn version was incredibly rough, I still played it LOTS when I first got it. This version just doesn't do the same at all. I was looking forward to a graphically improved Daytona so that I could relearn all the courses and break my lap records over again, but this just isn't quite it. While it may look a bit like Daytona, none of the cars handle anywhere near the way they do in the arcade or on the first Saturn game, and the new courses are nowhere near as clever and detailed as the originals. And, like Tom, I prefer the funky Japanese music and presentation to the very \"American\" look of the new game. It's not terrible, I just think that Sega, and the Saturn, could do better. 69 LOMAS The new tracks (Desert City shown here) are okay, but don't really shout Daytona! By entering certain initials on the name entry screen, you could access music to almost any previous Sega game! Sadly not so in this version. You still can't call yourself sex though. V , F 6919 STOP THE SLOT MACHINE REPLAY -Circuit Edition U The good old tracks. Pretty much identical, but the colours make them feel different. REVIEWER S A The Million Slot Arch on the 777 Speedway can be stopped. However, having earned three sevens, we didn't get any extra time. What does it do? RECORD BREAKERS! REPLAY TURN JEFFRY UPSIDE DOWN. Yes, pressing X does still roll the Jeffry statue onto his head. As entertaining as it ever was. Which wasn't much. Daytona set new standards in breaking lap records with its Time Attack feature (known as Time Lap over here). The CS Team then turned the feature into an artform in Saturn Sega Rally, with a whole host of extra features. Well, Time Attack is back, with yet more features to its name. There's the customary ghost car, which pits you against a visual recording of the previous Time Attack contender. Also, a Time Compare option informs you of how far ahead, or behind you are, against the current best. A new feature is the Section Lap timer, which helps you pace your speed by timing you on separate sections of each course. As far as I'm concerned, Daytona is still the greatest arcade racing game. And AM2's previous conversion, flawed as it is, is still brilliant. So, the concept of a new update with better graphics, definitely appealed to me. The result though, is massively disappointing. The graphics are improved, not perfectly, but still quite impressively, if these technical improvements had been added to the previous conversion, with its old style and handling, I'd consider this game to be excellent possibly the best home driving game ever made! Yes I'd like new features too. But if 'new features' means two substandard courses, ugly cars, and the excellent arcade style replaced with tasteless select screens and inapproriate music, I'd rather go without. As it is, even the superb handling from the original has been lost! I've always liked the Saturn for its close conversions of Sega's coinops. This isn't anything of the sort. It isn't even a fresh remix (as RR Revolution was with Ridge Racer). It's just a decent driving game. Personally, I'd rather have the original Daytona. Even the badly-bordered UK version, bad clipping and all. It's a far closer conversion of the coin-op, and a superior racing game. TOM GUISE HIDDEN VEHICLES EOS 2 COURSE RECORD 249..

This powerful force serves to boost defensive and offensive techniques, so it is important to become familiar with its ways as soon as possible Once in every round all fighters may unleash a sequence of spectacular and damaging moves from one simple, well timed command. This is achieved by simultaneously pressing A, B, and K. The fighter is, enveloped by Plasma energy, and, should the first blow connect, continues to land several big strikes on their opponent. PlayStation PLASMA COUNTER Similar to the Counter Strikes in Fighting Vipers, only far more spectacular! There are two types of Plasma Counter, turning high or mid to low level attacks against the aggressor. In both cases there is a flash of light as a blow is deflected, and the gleeful survivor retaliates with a mighty counter strike. PLASMA Hayato PLASMA COMBO Each fighter 'Type' has its own Plasma Tree which governs more than ten combinations of moves. Exactly four of these consist of five deliberately placed moves. On top of that, Types A and K have a Finish move tagged onto two of the major combos. Three Finish moves are available to B-Type characters. A special 'Plasma' bar rests beneath the Energy Bar. The letters A, B, and K light up in response to a fighter's attacks. If the letter forms part of a chain, it joins others to make a Plasma Combo. It's not so hard to find them. June 00 1 For the duration of a successful Plasma Assault the viewpoint snaps through many different angles. Just like AM2's Fighting Vipers, but with greater special effects. OYNAT RIN RED (HIGH Deflects most vertical attacks, and some horizontal. Press toward or away on the direction key, plus A and B. REVIEWER 00 Saturn EPISODE IOIT ZE SIAR At the end of certain five-hit combos the word FINISH replaces the collection of letters in the Plasma bar. This is where a sixth key move can transform the standard Plasma Combo into a Plasma finish. BLUE (MIDDLE OR LOW) Deflects most horizontal, and some low attacks. Press toward or away on the direction key, plus B and G. HOME OF THE FUTURE NO RING OUT Naturally Capcom have added all-new features for the home version of Star Gladiator. Though it doesn't appear that Capcom have found it necessary to add more to, or refine the gameplay of the arcade game. Whatever your entry level at Star Gladiator VF/ Tekken master, or beginner with an eye for taste the game almost assures big satisfaction. Though all the fighters are sitting on a respectable lists of special moves, these aren't required to start some very impressive routines going. A six-year-old could probably give a sixteen-year-old pro an eventful challenge at first. Beyond the first hour Star Gladiator begins to sort out the men from the boys, as the many counter attacks start to pay off. Plus it's one thing being able to memorise a character's Plasma Combo Final, but another to gauge the timing and distance just right. Like most recent fighting games which are big on presentation and special effects, I'm concerned that Star Gladiator is perhaps too weighed down with fancy extras. Compared to VF2 and even Tekken 2. the routines are all quite slow in execution. There are no snappy kicks or jabs everything is one big celebration of stateof-the-art motion capture finesse. Also there are times when I feel like I'm playing the game from the Plasma bar, and not with the fighter. Since the game has only been around for a couple of months in the arcade, its finer virtues are yet to be discovered. That is, I have faith that Capcom have this game well balanced as always. But it has to be said that it is a luxurious experience getting to know Star Gladiator better. These are some of the finest models and locations ever to have appeared in any type of game. Even Gamof looks cool after a while. If Capcom is your style, this could take preference to anything else. PAW. DAVIES TRAINING MODE Under normal circumstances Star Gladiator respects the Ring Out strategy introduced by Virtua Fighter. However their is a special option in the home version (once you've completed the game on the hardest difficulty) which allows players to create an invisible barrier around the fight stage kind of like Fighting Vipers. The difference is that this barrier is not used tactically throughout the fight, it is only there to keep fighters inside until they are defeated. Finishing blows still knock them out. | GROUP BATTLE Take any character into the practice hall, and pitch them against the stooge of your choice.

From forgettable computer games in the '80s, to some decent games for dodgy Sega add-ons, through to the acclaimed Thunderhawk 2, which did some serious business last Christmas. But they've never produced a game that's been truly original, or for that matter, universally liked. This is set to change with Tomb Raider, which is ambitious and accomplished, and being hailed from several quarters as the best thing Core have ever done. TOMB RAIDER HIGHES ENDATION CVGREBU ECOM TOMB RAIDER PIERRE YOU LITERBUG! THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND Lara is rich enough to have turned her Grade 11 listed mansion into a multi-purpose gym, which just happens to function as a training level before the game proper. There's a room for tumbling. one for climbing, a large hall filled with vaulting horses, where Lara practices her jumping techniques, plus a pool where the basic skills of swimming are acquired. VO 11 Tui Tomb Raider's inter-level movies are deserving of both praise and attention, revealing the story in parts with some impressive CG sequences. As a prologue, a nuclear test in New Mexico disturbs part of an ancient artifact known as the Atlantean Scion. There are other pieces of this relic in lost cities of three ancient civilisations the Peruvian Incas, the Roman Empire and the ancient Egyptians. Lara is not searching for herself, she's been commissioned by Jacqueline Natla, head of a shadowy technology corporation. Lara, curious of why Natla has sponsored the expedition, discovers more as she begins to piece the Scion together. Ini Lara gatecrashes Natla to find the location of the second Scion segment. PROTECTION OF THE DEAD Those clever Ancients anticipated looters and Tomb Raiders like yourself down the ages, and have sought to protect their relics with secrecy and traps. Cast your mind back to the Indiana Jones' trilogy and that's the kind of hassle you have to deal with rolling boulders, collapsing floors and poisonous spikes.

"computer video games PlayStation ENDANGEROUS SPECIES Isn't it ironic those species near extinction you've fought to protect, but now you have to turn your guns on them to survive! Lions. apes, panthers, wolves are the familiar wild animals that inhabit the earlier levels. And they do behave like animals resting, pacing. pouncing, growling and then writhing as you humanely despatch them. A nice touch is that animal corpses remain within the game, even when you restart a new session. Further into the game, the creatures become grotesque nightmares, mummies, dinosaurs, and monsters of myth! LARSON AROUND You have to contend with some of Natla's double-crossing cronies. Larson and Pierre Dudont pop up with guns blazing when you least expect it, trying to take the Scion for themselves! Scum! 1 Wolves have a reputation for being scary, but here they're gun fodder. 1 The raptors move with that shifty, bird-like motion they used in JP. Lara makes Larson, Natla's henchman, explain himself after he tries to ambush her in Qualopec. THE SPICE GIRL Lara luckily took her handguns with her just before they got banned. Those pistols pack a punch, but she's going to need something of a heavier calibre to make an impact further on. It's useful to find the shotgun, uzis and magnums left carelessly in the tombs. But bullets are scarce especially shotgun cartridges which are found only two at a time! RAIDER 1 The T-Rex's makes an entrance that Speilberg would be proud of. 1 You can inspect they lion's gnashers at this range, but it's not advised.

"computer Video games GOING DOWN There is enough jumping around in the gameplay to label Tomb Raider a platformer. But there's more intricacy to jumping than other 3D games like Exhumed or Quake. Lara can take standing or running jumps, grab ledges and pull herself along them or lower herself down. Combinations of these abilities are employed at the trickiest section. 11. lio TALE OF TWO TOMBS The PlayStation and Saturn versions are due out at pretty much the same time, so if you're lucky enough to have both consoles, which should you get? Well, it's that familiar story the PlayStation one is slightly superior. The differences are mainly cosmetic. The PlayStation handles light-sourcing better, and throws in a couple of nice effects, like reflective save-point crystals (which are plain-sided on the Saturn version). The sound seems better, probably a symptom of the rush to finish the Saturn version for a four week release advantage. Also, the PlayStation runs slightly smoother thanks to a higher-frame rate, which makes close combat easier (it's less confusing). Both versions use different means to create underwater effects, but the Saturn's are remarkably cool, so it's a matter of taste which you prefer. SEA SATURN The Saturn handles the effects pretty well. U COMMENT 1 You have no option but to get from up here to down there in one piece. The easiest way to describe Tomb Raider is as Prince of Persia in 3D. The control is very similar, with fixed moves which you need to learn the timing of very carefully But, as with Pop, everything soon becomes second nature, and the real adventure begins. There's a lot of exploration to be done, making it feel very different to Doom or Mario 64, and the tension created by the music when you actually come across an enemy makes it very nerve-wracking. Though the first few stages are just set in caves and ruins, the plot really comes into play early on, with the change through dinosaurs into mutants making a strange kind of sense. It's a brilliantly-made game, and won't disappoint anyone. 24 ED LOMAS 1 Just about every major jump is a cliffhanger. A bit excessive, but it works in building tension. The Playstation is slightly crispier, classier and better able to maintain a smooth update. REVIEWER TOMB RAIDER THE WATER MARGIN At first, the underwater areas appear to be a pleasant gimmick, but they feature largely in the gameplay, with mazes, switches and a set of creatures devoted to the submerged areas. One level is almost entirely devoted to swimming exploration The Cistern has a vast pool room and mechanism to raise and lower the water level throughout, which forms the basis of its clever puzzle. Games reviewers are so used to finding the 'catch' that spoils games that look as promising as Tomb Raider. Its technical brilliance has been accepted for a few months, but I was more concerned with how it was going to play. It's not Doom for starters, the kill rate just isn't that high. Think of it more as a mixture of puzzles, nasty creatures, a lot of plat. forming all striving for the atmospheric qualities of a big budget action movie. If that sounds like an over-ambitious mess, it's not, as the designers have obviously worked hard at getting each part of the mix right. The puzzles are logical, progressively more sneaky and relate to the ever-changing environment of the game. The creatures are convincing, from the trouble taken to animate and motivate them realistically. And the platforming provides lots of sweatypalm moments, followed by sickeningly long drops. The 3D is just excellent, with superb water and lighting effects, and the vastness of the 15 levels begins to get apparent when you're tired and lost somewhere about a quarter through the game. Considering the limits of what 32-bit machines can achieve, Tomb Raider is a faultless achievement. Alcus SWAN REVIEW  BATING 00 A great blend of action and adventure to appeal to more people than the average RPG ever will. 76 "

DESTRUCTION DERBY 2 9233s we 19 S2515 he first Destruction Derby on PlayStation got some amazing reviews about a year ago, and became the fastest-selling CD game ever (as has just about every PlayStation game since). The sequel has been eagerly anticipated because it keeps everything that made the first game fun. In addition there is a new set of car mechanics, and some of the most spectacular crashes ever in a video game! BOWL-A-RAMA! In Destruction Derby, you have to compete in a massive scrap in the bowl at the end of each season, but in DD2 there's a small change. There are now four different bowls, each one slightly different from the next. But the basic idea remains: Smash everyone else about for points, then trash them so that you're the last car left moving! MY PANELS NEED BEATING! While it sounds like a bad idea to put pit stops into Destruction Derby, it works very well.

There are three main modes of play in DD2 Wrecking Racing, Stock Car Racing and Destruction Derby. Stock Car Racing just awards points depending on your finishing position in a race, Destruction Derby only depends on how much you smash the other cars around, and Wrecking Racing is a combination of the other two. In the Destruction Derby races and Wrecking Racing, points are given for spinning cars: 10 for a 90¬∞ spin, 25 for 180¬∞, 50 for a complete 360¬∞ and 25 for wrecking a car. As an added bonus, the points are doubled if you do this to the car in first place! To be honest, I thought the first Destruction Derby game was boring rubbish. Even the graphics were overated. Not so with the much improved sequel. It looks miles better with twisting, sloping tracks that send cars airborne. The way the cars move too, with the suspension rocking about, makes it all look more dynamic. Even the destruction bowls are ace. Ploughing into the other cars now sends piles of them spinning up into the sky. All the more fun, when you're part of that monster mash. Still lacking that true racing element, but this is destruction to the ultimate level. Great fun! TOM GUISE LET'S GET ROCKED! Rare Pants OYD DD2 has a very different overall style to its predecessor, partly because the music has been changed totally from Wipeout-style techno to some real grinding rock. Two 'real' bands \"Jug\" and \"Tuscan\" (who we admit we've never heard of) have done the tunes, some of which are great, and some which are a bit naff. But they all ROCK! DESTRUCTION DERBY 2 REVIEWER In a bowl scrap, you don't want to get boxed in or you'll be smashed to bits! 000 05 za MPION While I didn't ever think that the first Destruction Derby was particularly good, I played it quite a lot when I first got it. The second game is definitely a lot better, not only because of the enhanced car mechanics but also because there's a lot more of a racing feel to the game. The tracks are designed really well, with lots of room to race around and overtake, with some excellent jumps, crossroads and alternative routes. The presentation is excellent, and the music (while not brilliant) fits the game well. And a special mention has to go to the excellent UK PAL version we've reviewed here. As with nearly all Psygnosis games it's full-screen, full-speed and an excellent frame rate, which just shows that it IS possible to have good UK PlayStation versions. Sony should really take note of this and spend more time on their big games, like Tekken 2. While it's a lot of fun (and I mean a LOT of fun!) for a while, it's not likely to last too long, as with the first game. Shame.  ! A$ HI EVERYONE! I'M PAUL PAGE! The replay mode isn't as comprehensive as in DD1, which lets you determine the path of a helicopter through your replays, but it's still impressive. You also get Paul Page's comments on the race (he's a famous American motor sport commentator) spoken in his usual excited voice. After a race you can watch it all again from a series of TV-style camera angles, slowing it down or saving it to memory card whenever you want. REVIEW The TV-style replays show off the graphics, but aren't as much fun to use as they could have been. It's a bit of a shame, really. RATING Lots of fun and excellent to look at. What more do you want from a game? If your answer's \"not a lot\" get this. 79 "

One night he falls asleep, only to be woken up by one of his own creations and dragged into their cartoon world. The evil Nefarious has created the Malevolator a machine which is turning the whole of \"Cutopia\" evil, and Drew must help the Cutopians save their world in order to escape.

Your animeve HARDCORE ARCADE ACTION You don't have to spend all your time just pointing, clicking and talking to people there are times that the style of play changes entirely. For example, to get a fake gold chain from a grumpy arcade owner (just take it from us that you'll eventually NEED the fake gold chain) you need to beat him at his favourite game WacMan! What's this guy's job? Yep, you guessed it: He's a footman! PEFAC CONCERTO As anyone who's a fan of \"point and click\" adventure games will tell you, Lucasarts are the true masters of creating clever, fun, and engrossing adventures. The two Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle and Indiana Jones: Fate of Atlantis are four of the best adventures I've ever played (they were all good enough to make me play them to the end) and Toonstruck is definitely high up the list with them. There's slightly more emphasis on talking to people here than in the Lucasarts games, but that adds to the excellent cartoony feel of the adventure, along with the most professional cartoon cut-scenes ever seen in a game! And it's this feeling of interacting in a cartoon, along with the strange sense of humour (with a few slightly ¬´adult\" gags!) that draws you into the game. It's not quite as instant as say, Monkey Island, mostly down to the massive amounts of conversation at the start of the game, but the simple controls and good difficulty curve soon get you going. Not quite a classic, but definitely the best point and click adventure for a long time. OV WAS These two characters work in the Wacme building, selling various dangerous implements. Their trick cigars don't just popthey take the top of your head off! Press the buttons on the cabinet to make your character stand, crouch or duck, and throw stars at your opponent's target.

And way), but we reckon point-and-click now your worst nightmare has arrived... PlayStation o doubt you'll write in telling us we're gaming fascists (you do anyway), but we reckon point-and-click adventures, being mouse-driven by design, remain very much games for computers, as opposed to consoles. Perhaps we're wrong. After all, Discworld on PlayStation did staggeringly well, and Broken Sword is actually superior on PlayStation. Yep, maybe times are changing. Perhaps point-and-click adventures DO have a place on console. Then along come Blazing Dragons to put you off the whole idea. BLAZING DRAGONS WHAT IN THE BLUE BLAZES? One of the most important parts of any adventure is a gripping plot. Well, Blazing Dragons has half of that vital element a plot. Of sorts. The game takes an ingenious' twist on the old King Arthur legend, by turning all the Knights into dragons. And humans are the baddies. Haha, love it! Anyway, you take control of a young dragon called Flicker. He's desperate to marry the fair Princess Flame (she loves him too, blah blah). but he's not a Knight, or even a squire. So somehow he has to earn serious promotion to enter the Royal Tournament and win her hand in marriage. Sigh. SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE BLAZE! Modern adventures are famous for their user-friendly interfaces. The days of fiddly control systems are gone nearly. BD attempts to create an speedy icon system, but it doesn't quite hit the spot. Basically, the moving cursor can be turned into four different activities walk, look, pick up and speak which are simple enough to use, except you have to cycle to the appropriate one everytime. Slow moving as adventures are, this eventually gets annoying. After all, you aren't ever going to talk to the kettle. BLAZING DRAGONS This is your inventory. It's a bag. Can you spot the one collectible item? REVIEWER FLAMIN' HILARIOUS! Humour is always a crucial key to the success of an adventure, especially if it's so bad it puts you off playing it. We wouldn't rate ourselves as comedy geniuses, so you judge for yourself if this is funny. Flicker happens across a pool, where the Lady of the Lake's arm rises, holding Excalibur. She says \"I'm fed up of people throwing this rubbish in the Lake!\" and bungs it onto a trash heap. Then she's caught by a fisherman who bellows \"Quit squirming fish-women, you'll make a tasty dinner for me and my wife.\" Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Clever. 1 Much humorous goings-on. That knight at the bottom gets called \"haircut boy\". Chortle! P'n'c adventures have never appealed to me greatly the set-up being too structured for my liking. However, Broken Sword and Toon Struck have changed my perception greatly, with their excellent plots and brilliant graphics. Blazing Dragons however, makes me take two steps back. It's everything! hate about these games. Unstylish graphics, laboriously trundling plot with awful humour, abysmal dialogue \"That would be like talking to a wall\" (accidently talking to a wall) and puzzles that only test your free time. We did have a few laughs at this game, crowding around the screen and sarcastically wisecracking at every quote. But if I'd paid money for it, I don't think I'd find it very funny at all.

Theme Park. Syndicate Wars. Yeh, they're fun. But for a real control freak, nothing less than complete domination of the galaxy will do. Cue The Empire Strikes Back soundtrack... 1 hat's what we really want from a Sim game. Building our own theme park, or being god over a group of little people is entertaining. Running a city, or taking over one by brute gang force, is even better. But we'd much rather sit in our floating Death Star, spreading our dread power across the universe through the awesome might of our space armadas. That's what we want and that's what Gremlin have given us. However, there's quite a way to go before you reach the status of Lord of the Universe!

Each of the various types of ore uncovered are of different value, with particularly rare types worth big moolah. If your planet doesn't contain these precious seams though, don't fret, just look to the skies... REVIEWER Can it be? Is Mike Newson a member of an alien warrior race? WAN That's what it's all about after all. Meet a new race, find their throne world, burn down their bases and take over. Yeh! Of course you need weaponry. And with enough money made from mining, you can build missile silos, space fighters, battlecruisers, even orbiting space stations. Eventually, you have giant space docks, surrounded by battlecruisers with little ships spewing out of 'em. The galaxy's your oyster... until you meet the Mauna! With the exception of Sim City, I've never really gotten into god-games, but Fragile Allegiance (an update of Gremlin's old K240) appeals to me, simply because of its wide-ranging scope. The early stages of the game, construct ing mining stations, allocating funds to various tasks, is very much bog-standard sim-stuff. However, this is just the prelude to the real game. Once you come into contact with alien races, the gameplay opens up. Searching for new worlds with your scout craft, building weapons of war, sending fleets to alien planets. intercepting their ships with your task force, making pacts with other races for your survival. It really seems you can do almost anything. You can even send spy probes to other planets, to watch their goings-on. An excellent game, with hours of ever-expanding planet-conquering entertainment.

If only they knew. hat can you say about the Strike games that hasn't already been said before? We all know that the first was ace, and that Jungle was the best of all. And Urban, although still a mighty fine game, wasn't quite up to scratch when it came to its superior predecessors.

But if you stop their way of getting to you then obviously, they can't attack.

FMV look even worse! I was really worried about a 3D Strike game as I'm a big fan of the 16-bit versions. But as soon as I turned Soviet Strike on I cheered up. And when I got into the game and realised that it moved and played just like the originals, I nearly smiled out loud! The mission structure is similar to before, but the strong plot really comes through with little sub-missions and decisions to get you even more involved. The graphics are good but slightly jerky, though not enough to ruin the excellent overall effect. Also, the FMV is worth mentioning, as it's all high quality full-screen stuff with some surprisingly good acting! It's the best anyone could hope a 32-bit Strike game to be brilliant! 6V LOMAS REVIEWER Lordy! Ammo, armour and fuel galore in this building. It's like a nuclear version of Kwik Save. BUT I'VE GOT TO DO THE DISHESI Every time you play Soviet, there is a chance that you'll uncover something you've never seen before. As well as discovering extra lives and hidden armour crates, short mini-objectives regularly appear throughout the game. On the first level alone for instance, Nick the copilot needs rescuing, a group of P.O.W's need saving from an ambush and some soldiers having a good beer up before they come and attack you need to be dispatched sharpish! All in a days work, you agree? The Strike games are one of my all time favourite series of games. They were original, tough and immensely playable and they wasted hours of my younger years. And spill me innards all over the floor with a sidewinder missile, if this one isn't going to do exactly the same. The most immediate thing, you notice is that the feel of the game hasn't changed at all. Just a few tweaks here and there, but this is classic Strike stuff. Superb graphics, spot effects and sounds all add to the highly polished product that you see adorning these pages. Friends, go and buy this now. Or don't ever say you're a gamesplayer again! SNAFU.

ORIGIN THE OR Micro Machines SCALE ALE MINIA IATURES he first Micro Machines game caused a stir as it proved the theory that gameplay is more important than graphics. Micro Machines 2 improved on every aspect of the first game, being proclaimed by many as the best Mega Drive game ever. The '96 version added a track editor and new vehicles, while Military adds weapons to every vehicle, as well as new multiplayer battle modes! Is it possible that this is the best Micro Machines yet? *MILITARY * O NEW DANGER ** * ROUND ONE! FIGHT! * SaujanWDIW *MILITARY There are plenty of cool features to watch out for in MMM, including some clever special effects. For example, the firework display area is set at night but lights up whenever rockets are launched into the air! Check out some of these obstacles: There are loads of play modes to choose from in MMM, including the usual tournament races, time trials, and multi-player modes. As well as these, there is a new battle mode where all the players fight to be last vehicle remaining in a small arena. In multi-player mode this is great fun, shooting and bashing into each other, while in one player mode you need to last a certain amount of time before clearing the ring.

GOT A NEW MOTAH? REVIEWER * As always, there's a fine selection of vehicles to race, with a few brand new for Military. Snow Bikes slide their way around the icy garden; Land Skimmers whizz around the firework display site; and the Warriors fight in the toy room. Micromachines * MILITARY* RACE POSITIONS I've always been a big fan of the Micro Machines games, especially MM2. While Military uses the same basic game engine, there's something lacking about the graphics, making them look a bit rough compared to the original games. But the control of the vehicles is as good as it ever was, with excellent movement, inertia and speed making for simple but near-perfect handling. Having weapons on all the vehicles makes multi-player games a lot of fun, but occasionally becomes annoying when you get shot off the track by someone a lap behind you! The main point is that Micro Machines 2 is the best Micro driving game, MM'96 is worth getting for the track editor, and MMM is worth getting for the multi-player modes. If you can get them all. Otherwise stick with MM2. Excellent though Military is, its predecessors are still better. The buses chug about the garden. Watch out for the fireworks! KE PIL * READY! AIM! FIRE! ten ia CUCI Here's what the The Warriors Warriors look like. doing battle! **8V LOMAS The \"Military\" part of this version of Micro Machines means that EVERY vehicle is armed with a weapon, not just the tanks as before. Most have a simple gun on the front, but the speedboats drop mines instead! The guns aren't as deadly as in previous games, as they just cause the victim to spin on the spot, losing a bit of time and direction rather than exploding and losing about two very valuable seconds. BATING RATING HUU A brilliant addition to the Micro Machines series, but not one which sets new standards, unlike the first two Micro games. 88 "

Not sure how soon I thought we would have to wait before seeing graphics this realistic on a home system, but getting them so soon is pretty shocking. That water is real you'll swear it is so! Looking ahead, there's every chance the effects in Wave Race will remain a talking point, long after Mario Kart and F-Zero have blown us away further. The reflective water surface is a wonder to see, especially in the nighttime setting of Castle City where the neons shine onto and from beneath of the satin waters. Even beneath the waves there is amazing detail: Initially the dolphins playing in the sea is considered fine attention to detail, then you notice the tiniest of fishes dancing about down there too! In the final course Southern Island the sandy shore is seen to slope away into darkness. It's almost too incredible! Three gameplay options: Championship, Time Attack, and Score Attack, makes it difficult to know where to begin the quest for expertise. Could this be too good to be true? Well, after our extensive play testing of the game at CVG we have hit on the conclusion that each gameplay option is slightly stunted in the Championship, all the circuits remain exactly the same, apart from the obstacles placed to make the going more or less difficult. Though it's refreshing to attack them all in reverse after completing the game on the Expert difficulty, it's hard to ignore the fact that these are the exact same places you visited in the earliest races. The stunts in Score Attack are cool, but there are only so many permutations before this one player game loses its big draw too. The two-player game is definitely fun but it's not a championship race, so loses the unpredictability of the classic Mario Kart. Petty reasons for finding fault. Still that's how it is. I love this stunning game. But it isn't flawless.

SWIV 3D is quite different from any of the previous versions, playing more as a search and destroy game more than just plain old shooting. The graphics are surprisingly fast and smooth with some excellent special effects (a massive ripple flowing through the level, for example), though the vanishing point is a little close at times. There's always something to do, something to shoot, and the controls work fairly well, it's just that it doesn't do anything that you haven't seen before.

"HIGH EVE! Computer Video games PUZZLE GAME un TETRIS ATTACK GAME BOY OUT NOV BY NINTENDO CPR 1-2 PLAYERS (LINK) perfect game for the Super NES becomes THE perfect game for Nintendo's portable. This is yet another genius puzzle game, in this case using the premise of blocks marked by five different motifs in various shades of monotone. The idea is to match three or more of these blocks, so that they disappear. Once you're confident, and the skill comes, there are advanced techniques such as chain reactions and combinations which score big points. All five options from the Super NES original are here, ranging from Endless, which doesn't stop until you lose, to the classic Puzzle where players must clear the screen within a set number of moves. As a one-player game this is a brilliant companion. When two players go head to head it's phenomenal.

PLATFORM 6009 DONKEY KONG LAND 2 GALEESY OUT NOV BY NINTENDO 1-2 PLAYERS (LINK) ssentially the same game as Donkey Kong Country 2 on the Super NES except the cool interaction between the two characters is gone. As a consequence some of the puzzles have had to be adjusted, and others are removed altogether. Regardless Donkey Kong Land 2 is a very clever platform game and is a worthwhile progression over the original. Each course is expertly designed to always have players on the look out for something' whether it's a bonus barrel, or another Kremcoin to access the secret world. All the animal helpers have made it over too, there's even a mouse cart section which is completely new. Donkey Kong Land 2 is arguably the best platform game on Nintendo's handheld. The only problem is you're being shortchanged if you already own DKC 2 on the Super NES.

ROBO COMBAT (5) (9) ROBO PIT Plution OUT NOV BY ALTRON The basic idea here is a cross between Namco's Cyber Sled, and Sega's Virtual On, adapted to an attractive 'toy'! robot scenario. Before entering the combat arena, players may choose to custom build their robot, selecting chassis type, style of arms (incorporating weaponry), and colour. You can even give it a name. From here players either go head to head, presented as a horizontally split screen, or against the CPU which is presented full screen. Where it gets interesting is the idea that the victor gets to steal the defeated robots arm/ weapon. This way, especially in the one-player situation, your fighter gets more and more powerful until the final confrontation. A cool idea. Of course Robo Pit's biggest problem is that Virtual On is many times its superior. And it's nowhere near as slick as Cyber Sled. PAUL DAVIES .

It's still a plan view, one screen situation, only now all the characters are polygons. The new presentation allows for Tempest 2000 style 'psychedelic techniques, zooming in and around the action for dramatic effect. Unlike the awesome Tempest remix, Williams haven't added anything extra in the way of bonus stages and such. Control remains eight-way directional fire, handled by the top four buttons, and eight-way directional movement for the main character. Enemies are many, and therefore just a faceless mass to wade through making this a kind of meditation exercise as much as anything else. Fans of the original Robotron all go crazy for it.

He brought with him a specially designed version of his pride and joy an arranged edition of NIGHTS by Sonic Team which he hopes will reward every Saturn owner across the globe. Incredibly he wants to give this away FREE! Before revealing how to obtain your gratis copy of the year's most original piece of software, we should explain more of what it's about.

Well, here at CVG, we appreciate wholeheartedly his intentions. NIGHTS isn't the kind of game you get the measure of in the space of five or ten minutes. As anyone who already owns and loves the game will tell you, getting the most from NIGHTS involves practice and, above all, long. term experience. Only way you're going to get much of that is by owning the game in some form or another.

And with Christmas NIGHTS, the flavour is even more delicious! With this special version of NIGHTS comes an all-new, festive story. It's Christmas, and Claris is shopping for presents with Elliot. So is everyone else! Making their way to the centre of Twin Seeds, they notice how the town's clock tower resembles a Christmas tree. Only thing is, it's missing a star.

FORMAT: SNES, MEGA DRIVE BY: ACCLAIM STYLE FIGHTING  Due NOW (USA), NOVEMBER (UK)  While the title of the game may be Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, this has more in common with Mortal Kombat Trilogy. As well as having all of the characters, Rain and Noob Saibot are playable on top of Ultimate's three hidden fighters, and even Brutalities have been added! As you'd expect, the graphics aren't as hot as the 32-bit versions with quite a bit of background detail and fighter animation lost, but it plays as well as you could hope. Both versions have recently been released  in the USA and we'll be reviewing them next issue.

We'll keep you posted. the awesome Quake for one-player fun! And you don't just play the levels through in order you can choose which way to go through the game, returning to old levels whenever you feel like it, using artifacts to find hidden sections. The PlayStation version promises to be almost identical, maybe even bettering the Saturn's excellent graphics, keeping the ingenious level design and control the same, while the PC version looks even better! While you may think that Final Doom is state-of-the-art for your PS, you should really be looking forward to this. We certainly are. FORMAT: PC CD-ROM BY: ROCKET SCIENCE STYLE: RACING COMBAT DUE NOVEMBER  Riding custom-built, super-fast rockets the Rocket Jockeys present a completely original line in 'futuristic' racing. These crazy craft are so fast . yet aerodynamically appaling that : directing them is very tricky. In order to take a sharp turn in any direction, jockeys fire out cables which attach to poles inside the arena. The closer they are to the pole at the time, the quicker the turn. Given this weirdo control system (which is quite easy to manage) there are three events to attempt: Rocket Ball, similar to polo; Rocket War, in which jockeys use their cables to trip and injure opponents; and Rocket Racing, which is just flat out speeding. There's a network option for the PC. A PlayStation version is due not long after. We think this could be very cool. WAR GODS EXHUMED  Jockeys use their cables to  form clotheslines, which knock competitors from their saddle. Cables are also used to drag rivals, cowboy-style, behind the rocket! STREET FIGHTER ZERO 2 NEW GAMES FORMAT: SNES BY: CAPCOM STYLE FIGHTING DUE NOVEMBER (JAPAN) It came as quite a surprise to find out that Street Fighter Zero 2 was coming to Super NES, but it came as even more of a shock when we played it! Obviously a lot of animation is cut and the sprites are smaller, every feature from the arcade game's been included All 18 characters, all the moves, the custom and super combos, and most of the background detail (including Nash's hovering Harrier Jet). The early version we played was slightly slow, but speed settings are being incorporated into the final game. And one thing it's got over the Saturn and PlayStation versions is that there's no loading time, being on cartridge! Street Fighter Zero 2 is . out in Japan soon, and we hope to be reviewing it next issue. Exhumed on the PC looks particularly nice, mainly thanks to the high resolution mode. Also, mouse control is a lot better than with joypads. 'C "

With WaveRace finally splashing onto Nintendo 64, we decided to find out if it's as realistic as it looks. Nothing to do with Tom, Jaime and Phil going on holiday to Tenerife at all! GOON SHOW STUNT SPECTACULAR! 1 Phil had to shave the fur from his body. so he could masquarade as a human here. etskiing. Surely one of the ultimate high-speed sporting thrills. For a coward. After all, it's like bombing a motorcycle across rough terrain without the fear of splattering yourself on the ground. At least, that's what we reckoned, or we wouldn't have got on the things. For the equivalent of twenty-five quid, we got the chance to race around for 20 minutes. Expensive stuff, but worth every penny. Three floating buoys, set out as a massive half-mile triangle, identified the course. All we had to do was race around the outside of them for about 10 laps and not go the wrong way. Rules which were immediately broken when Tom drove straight through the middle of the triangle (accidently, of THE NAME'S SMITH, course), and JAME SMITIL How 'BOUT YOU GET spun his jetbike OUT OF THEM WET round in little THINGS. circles (not accidently). And what's it like? Pretty much like bombing a motorcycle across rough terrain without the fear of of splattering yourself on the ground. You can power the machine along at continuous top-speed, even around the bends. In fact, extra power is essential to corner tightly a bizarre technique that Waverace 64 replicates well. Waverace's superb pounding waves however, don't capture quite how pounding they are in reality. Riding over a big wave or, better still, smashing headlong into one, really shakes your bones. And you can't see a thing with all the spray hitting your face! As for performing thrilling stunts We did manage to stand on the seat and ride one-handed!

The cabinet even uses an identical full-size jetbike! And, WANA with N64 Waverace, of course, you can jetski from the comfort of your armchair!

"and The Computer and Video Games FREE Pull-out Guide December 1996 computer Video games FREEPLAY Issue 8 READERS MOST WANTED CHART  stop press. *** CONSOLE EEE BARGAIN EXPLOSIONLU More of your pathetic little dreams... TOYS 'R' US are doing a PlayStation pack with Worms, Doom, True Pinball and Zero Divide for .99 A Saturn, extra pad, Sega Rally, Wipeout and Virtua Fighter is . COMET's smaller pack only includes two games, however one of them is the awesome Tekken 2, packed in his Christmas promises to be the big one for console sales, and clearly the big chain stores are keen to capitalise on it with the help of super-value bundle packs. We thought they'd be of interest to you, especialy if you're on the look out for a console this Christmas. So here are the main retailer packs, as reported last month in industry newspaper, Computer Trade Weekly. DIXONS are selling the PlayStation with a memory card, extra controller and four games (Olympic Games, Worms, Alien Trilogy and Thunderhawk 2). All for .95. They also have a Saturn pack with VF2, Sega Rally, Olympic Soccer, Alien Trilogy, the Arcade Racer steering wheel and a second joypad, for .95. These come with  of discount vouchers and six-months interest-free credit. BEATTIES have a PlayStation deal with six games included Ridge Racer, Tekken, Worms, Thunderhawk 2. Theme Park and Rayman, for .99. Saturn with the brilliant Worldwide Soccer for . Sony are also doing one-game-packed-in deals Tekken, Extreme Sports, Wipeout etc for . Meanwhile HMV are including Alien Trilogy with Saturns, and Track and Field with PlayStations, for only .99. As far as industry opinion goes, these deals are a good thing, being considered far preferable to dropping console prices more. Providing, that is, the deals aren't so good, they prevent buyers from getting more games. What's our opinion? Well, if the games included in the deals appeal to you, they're certainly good value. However, we don't think Olympic Games, Worms and True Pinball are the best games you'd want to spend your money on. In fact, saving your money and going for the smaller packs (HMV's PlayStation with Track and Field, for example) seems more sound, leaving you money to get another game you really want. Still, the choice is out there. 1 NINTENDO 64 2 STREET FIGHTER 3 ARCADE 3 VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 SATURN 4 QUAKE SAT/PS 5 RESIDENT EVIL 2 6 MORTAL KOMBAT 4 ARCADE 7 TEKKEN 3 PS 8 MARIO 64 N64 9 MARIO 642 N64 10 MARVEL SUPERHEROES Other, more interesting, demands included NIGHTS 2, Any footy game for N64, Bug 2 (grief), Sega to do for Saturn what Sony do for PS (whatever that means), SegaWorld bankruptcy lyikes!), CVG issue 181 (prrp) and a driving game using Model 3. Keep sending them in. Remember, if you don't, we crap on your letters and throw 'em at the wall. Contents with Ridge Racer, for .97 BLOCKBUSTER are offering a PlayStation with carrycase and Mortal Kombat 3 for . Most of these are PlayStation bundles. However Sega have released their own Christmas deal, packing a US GET SEGA NETLINK! BY THE WAY... On the 31st of October, Sega's NetLink add-on for the Saturn was released in America. And Sega reckon it'll draw in 100, 000 sales before the end of the year. Priced at $200, this system allows Saturn users to browse the Net using Sega's 32-bit console. However, Sega have bigger plans for the system. Currently, they're working on head-to-head and multiplayer systems to be incorporated into future games. The first to accomodate it is Sega Rally Championship, a NetLink-enhanced version of which, is to be released in the first quarter of 1997. Other software houses currently said to be working on NetLink projects, include Capcom and GT Interactive the publishers of Quake! People renting the NetLink are currently being offered three days free Internet use through the concentric group. Those who want to buy a Saturn with NetLink will be able to get a full package including browser software, keyboard and Sega Rally for $499. hart Track an organisation that calculates sales figures of consoles, based on the results from all the big retailers have just released UK figures of both major systems' sales.

"WWW FLATEY WALL vide comput Vide gaine VDEDICAMNG Dave Kebello Retro **Cabinto ou ello... it's the MicroGoblin here, and as you can see I've been scouring through ancient issues of CVG to find you another collection of crusty old videogame classics. D: of 3D wake. As with all David Braben games (see ELITE last issue) VIRUS can be played on two levels. 1. Fly around blasting the cacka out of anything that moves. 2. The strategic approach where you knock out the seeders and bombers first (they spread the deadly virus) and then destroy the other ships later on to complete an attack wave, not forgetting the usual Braben secret aliens and legendary sea monster! VIRUS is a truly underrated game and appeared on the ST and AMIGA machines, though fans will want to track down the original and a title called ZARCH that appeared first on the Acorn Archimedes. Based in Ashby de la Zouch ULTIMATE PLAY THE GAME was the creation of two brothers Chris and Tim Stamper, who along with a couple of software engineers achieved a string of Speccy masterpieces between 1983-86. JETPAC and PSST, their first two games, were crammed into just 16k and also came out on the Sinclair Interface II. Then came COOKIE, TRANS AM and the awesome LUNAR JETMAN Ultimate fans still talk about the mysterious hidden trailer that is supposed to appear in the game's later levels... but it doesn't I'm afraid! After the BE superlative ATIC ATAC came SABRE WULF, UNDERWURLDE and then KNIGHT LORE and ALIEN 8, which introduced an entirely new 3D concept in gaming and animation HI.5CR 5010000 $000120 TELEGRAM called Filmation (though strictly speaking Quicksilva got there first GUNFRIGHT: Still awesome! with 3D ANT ATTACK). I certainly SABRE WULF: Cool jungle animals. remember going bananas when I saw it running in my local Fun B OBUR Fayre computer shop and played it MI L ITI for hours. Of course this was back in the days when computer shops were nice and gladly loaded up games for us kids to have a butchers at before we handed over our .95. Then came NIGHTSHADE and GUNFRIGHT that expanded the 3D routines into a scrolling environment followed by the non-scrolling PENTEGRAM that marked Tim and Chris's last Spectrum games before creating RARE (DONKEY KONG COUNTRY etc...) though the inferior CYBERUN, BUBBLER and MARTIANOIDZ were released under the ULTIMATE label. Commodore 64 owners were also treated to the less impressive INHOTEP, BLACKWYCHE, DRAGONSKULLE and OUTLAWS that never quite retained that old ULTIMATE magic. I for one miss the Sabreman's adventures and could think of nothing better than one of those lovely Ultimate ads to appear in CVG announcing his latest exploits on these new fangled 33-bit mainframe consoles! DIG DUG 2 by Namco is a long forgotten treasure (again just gagging to be resurrected) and sends you off to a cluster of islands inhabited only by fire-breathing penguins and ball-like things. Each island is pock-marked with a number of holes, some of which are already joined with brown lines. Your job is to run around avoiding the penguins etc... and, using your piledriver, join the holes together. As the holes are joined together, big chunks of the island fall into the sea along with any nasties that happened to be patrolling that area. As the island gets smaller it gets more difficult to trap the enemys so a quick blast from your trusty pump is used to see them off! An awe19 29 1 31 1 2 3 some game that will no doubt be DIG DUG 24 desper appearing on the NAMCO CLASSICS ately want this PCB! label in the near future. 40 = 0 PECTRAL INVADERS was the first ever commercially produced game for the Sinclair Spectrum, SPACE WARP was the first on the BBC and VIC MEN for the VIC 20. These groundbreaking games were the creation of David Lawson who would eventually go on to set up the computer games label IMAGINE The Name Of The Game. When the Spectrum first appeared, all the software houses were racing to get the first game on sale and David was Bug Byte's (the people behind MANIC MINER) main hope in this race. After thirteen failed production models he managed to write SPECTRAL INVADERS (a SPACE INVADERS clone) from a pre printers copy of the Spectrum users manual and luckily it turned out to be a pretty decent blast. David's talent for arcade rip offs was to pay off again for Bug Byte when he wrote VIC MEN, for the recently released Commodore machine. Unfortunately the game was withdrawn in the face of a threat of legal action by ATARI (Noooooooh, not NAMCO)--the holders of the PACMAN copyright. I find this quite unbelievable as the majority of early home computer games were blatant arcade copies. David Lawson: sitting VIRUS is a flinking awesome lightning fast in Paul's bedroom! shoot 'em up that takes place over a beautiful 3D patchwork landscape which undulates below as you pilot your heavily armed hovercraft across its surface. Your mission to defend the planet against waves of attacking alien space ships, that are intent on polluting the landscape by spraying it with a deadly red virus. Flight control is via the mouse and its not very easy to begin with because its based on the principle of a 'central mouse position'. The direction and distance you move the mouse away from this position VIRUS/ZARCH has aged well and determines the 'compass direction' is definitely worth hunting down. the craft will face, and its angle of dip to the ground... waffle... drone... yeh well anyway as you press the mouse button a massive burst of thrusting matter spurts out of the back of the craft and is left hanging in space like a sort 0 ...

"puter EO TES PLAYSTATION MOVES LIST TRILNAY his attack list is as complete as we've got at the time of going to press. There are a few moves still missing, but we thought you'd like as many as possible to get you started. Also, all of the moves from Mortal Kombat 3 on PS and Ultimate MK3 on the Saturn are listed too, but you'll need to experiment to find which have been added for MKT. If you want an upto-date FAQ, the best one available on the internet by far is done by WorknMan and SubZero, available from http//www.atw.fullfeed.com/-subzero/psxmkt.faq CHARACTER MOVES KEY Up BK DO TOC 111 LP Down Forwards Backwards High Punch Low Punch High Kick Low Kick Block Run Press the buttons in sequence TTTT Press the buttons at the same time A new move to MK Trilogy LK FATALITIES The distance in brackets before each Fatality tells you exactly how far away from your opponent to stand for the move to work. ANIMALITIES You can only do Animalities after doing a Mercy on someone, then beating them again. BRUTALITIES At the \"Finish Him/Her!\" message, move close to your opponent and press the sequence of hits (usually 10 or 11) quickly. If you keep the pace up, the screen will darken and the computer will do another 20-odd hits to finish them off! FRIENDSHIPS AND BABALITIES You can now block during the last round and still be able to perform Friendships and Babalities. Just stand anywhere on-screen (unless indicated otherwise) and key in the commands. MERCY To give mercy, hold R and press D, D, then release R when outside jump distance. The fight must have gone to three rounds for it to work. PIT FATALITIES You can do the Pit Fatality when close to your opponent on any of these backgrounds: Scorpion's Lair Shao Kahn's Tower The Subway The Pit III The Dead Pool (hold D on both controllers afterwards for a funny voice) The Kombat Tomb The Pit 1 (just do an uppercut for a pit finish) RANDOM SELECT Simply hold Start and press Up while highlighting the start characters.

"computer video games * CVG INTERVIEW * Think Street Fighter', and you think 'Capcom'. Well it's time to think again, because Arika are a new branch of Capcom who, as you'll discover, are especially qualified to lead this series in a crucial new direction. o coincide with the recent JAMMA arcade show in Japan, CVG's Japan correspondent arranged an interview with the team behind Street Fighter EX. Mr Ichiro Mihara, Vice President of Arika, spoke to our correspondent from their head office in Tokyo. general, he's in charge of development. After that, Junichi Ono is working on the planning also. It's felt that he was the founder of the Darkstalkers and Night Warriors series as he was its main planner. Having these two, the originators of the SF2 and the Darkstalkers and Night Warriors series, we shouldn't have any problems \"planning-wise. They're the best planners in this field. Fundamentally, we've gathered an excellent staff of software creators for this development. ARIKA INTERVIEW CVG In the beginning we were calling it Street Fighter 3D.

For the foreign versions we aren't sure \"Although its presentation is in 3D, the fighting method is still the same as the 2D Street Fighter used up to now.\" what it's going to be called. However, for the moment it's basically Street Fighter EX (SF EX). CVG What were your first thoughts when you began work on Street Fighter EX ? CVG When did the development of Street Fighter EX start? 117 IM In outline, the start of develop ment was this year. Around January we began the research and from around March we started full scale development in earnest. CVG Can you please tell us a little about the Street Fighter EX team? IM The main planner who's supervising everybody is Akira Nishitani, the creator of Street Fighter 2. In FREEPLAY IM We decided that the game would use some kind of 3D experience. For the expression of this 3D effect, we're using 3D graphics for its visual appearance but the content of the game hasn't really been changed from the 2D animated fighting version. With regards to the 3D, the 3D effect makes the fight interesting but with the way you fight in the tra ditional Street Fighter, just because it becomes 3D doesPescu A preliminary design of Guile, as planned for the original Street Fighter 2 created by Akira Nishitani.

"computer video games CVG Compared to other games the speed of Street Fighter is very fast. How are you overcoming the problem of convert ing this to 3D? just keep on using the same one method. In general ARIKA has an original way of thinking and although we haven't given it a name yet, we've developed an original interaction system. In general, all the hits are represented in 3D but the collisions are handled in a 2D way, like the Street Fighter series method used up to now. It's a little newer way of taking hits. Very early on in development we were thinking what we should do about this. Then, we had a sudden flash of inspiration, \"Hey, if we do it like this it might just work!\". Then just like that it became our system. IM This is a similar problem. At the moment we're all doing as much as possible but we'll probably be battling with this right up to the very end. We're devoting ourselves to trying again and again, fine-tuning SF EX to get it perfect. We want to get it as good as possible in order to satisfy all the users. concept. At the time we returned we thought why not create a new sure killing technique that was more in tune with this kind of character? And while we were at it we created some other new fighting techniques as well. On top of that, we looked at other techniques and improved or modified them also. We'd like to think that the users will try to play with the new techniques and say \"Hey! This is smart!\", ¬´This one's the best!\" preferring the new ones over the old ones. We've modified the techniques for this reason. awfully square looking.\" Visually speaking, if you look at a photo in a magazine or even just watch a video of it, it's said that the impression of SF EX isn't very good. However, if they have a go and play it, there's a complete change. \"Brilliant!\" \"It's really good!\". From talking to those operators that I know I've got the impression that they're all really looking forward to it. Certainly, looking at it and playing it are completely different. We're saying please play it. If you do, you'll see what SF EX really is like. tihti Dugeot CVG Is it just the characters that can interact?

"computer video games is very long. If the adjustment is less than half-done, even if the main game system is finished, it's not really complete at all. IM Yes, some of the writers are incredibly detailed in their reports on SF EX. Their questions can sometimes be really specific, such as the finer details of certain character's chained combinations. But really, it's far too soon for that. At only around 20% complete we'd like people to write about SF EX in little be no incentive to do the best you can. That would be equally bad. Really, we're not under that much pressure. We're just working hard to create a game that everyone can enjoy playing. seeing how the remaining 80% turns out. Anything could happen! In reality, a large proportion of the game's framework is pretty much complete at the moment. From here on, in order to make it more interesting, we'll be refining the system and including new techniques etc. This is the 80%. Therefore, to presuppose that a 20% SF EX is similar to a car's construction doesn't hold true. CVG Didn't you think that at around 20% complete it was a little too early to unveil SF EX to the general public? IM The usual way to think about development at 20%, for example, is in the case of let's say a car that has no body, just an engine, wheels and a steering wheel. For sure, it can be moved but it couldn't be driven on the road. There's not even a roof, it's dangerous. A 20% state is generally thought of as being at the very lowest level. But, a level of 20% as considered by us is only the minimum necessary level for it to be played by the users. In this way everyone can be interested in Q. For a completely new game, the users probably wouldn't be bothered by certain minor aspects of any particular character. However, for Street Fighter 2 every user has their own image of how that character should look in 3D. Is this a problem? \"A large proportion of the game's framework is pretty much complete at the moment. From here on, in order to make it more interesting, we'll be refining the system and including new techniques etc.\" CVG Are you planning to make announcements on the SF EX status on a regular basis? more general terms. IM For a while we're going to keep ourselves out of sight. We've made this announcement now but we're going to hide for the next month or so and concentrate on develop ment. The next thing for us will be the location test. After that, in around a month we'll be able to talk about the responses it. CVG In Japan Street Fighter 2 is very popular. Does the team feel under any pressure because of this? IM Yes, but not because it's related to SF2. Whatever game we create we want it to be successful. For any new company the pressure not to fail in it's first venture is there but it's not because it has anything to do with SF2. On the other hand if there wasn't any pressure there'd CVG The Japanese press often like to write frequent reports about games don't they? IM All the development staff here think exactly the same. Everyone likes SF2 so that's why they're doing it. Creating it themselves they understand the feeling of \"Ah! That's different!\". Therefore if they can somehow satisfy themselves, they should be able to win the approval of the users also. That's a safe method of doing it. As you'd expect with this development there are probably several areas where we haven't got much of a choice in what we can do. For those areas, as far as possible, we'll just leave them aside. In regard to SF2 the staff also have their own prejudices just like the users. We may be development staff but as SF2 players, even now, we still go down to the arcades to play. Those areas which concern the users are the same areas which we are also concerned about. The meaning of which is please trust us. * ARIKA INTERVIEW 55 FREEPLAY #17   Capcom.  Arika 12 "

I'm saying that until the very end there's always the chance that another Street Fighter character may appear as a hidden character or maybe we'll create another original character. We haven't considered at all yet but, maybe in a week or 10 days time, there's certainly the possibility that we may want to include another character. However, for the present there are eight characters, four original and four Street Fighter. Certainly, Ryu, Ken and Chun Li are pretty much IM Fundamentally, Street Fighter 2 is a one-on-one fighting game.
