"Y SAGA Z DVG BIGH 1385486 LEVEL CORE B087888 HIGH SCORE 8816488 HIGH 1385486 LEVEL Level One starts you off on a nice 'n' easy, flat, rocky terrain where you can see the nasties edging slowly towards you from afar -allowing plenty of time to swing your sword out and waste them before they can get too close. This does not last for long though, as you soon find you have to climb up ropes, swing across caverns and hop from ledge to ledge if you are to get the fireball sword, hidden somewhere in this level. Things get harder in the forests of Level Two where you are likely to make your first encounter with some of the nastier nasties. Prominent amongst these is the winged in man who attacks when you are attempting to cross a river by hopping from raft to raft as the water bobs up and down. As with all the levels there is a second stage set in the palace of Karg which must be completed before the next level loads. Yes, it is multi load, but there is no other way this huge arcade adventure could be converted. Disk versions will load the various levels automatically. If you get to Level Three you will have noticed the similarity of the levels in terms of layout. This is entirely consistent with the original coin-op but, none the less, introduces an element of repetitiveness that spoils Rastan slightly. Level Four is where you start to wonder if you are ever going to complete the game. The nasties are ganging up and attacking in waves. Larger, tougher, baddies come at youlike the Gigas and Chimeras. The second part of Level Five offers a welcome change in background graphics with caverns rather than castle ramparts. Stalagmites 'n' tites stab the air and ground and you also have to lop off the head of a giant dragon at the end of this level. Killing this mother is tough enough, but nothing by comparison with the multiheaded monster that awaits you on Level Six. Gargoyles and fire-breathing dragons will try to thwart you in meeting Karg head-on in his multi-headed dragon guise. You will need all of the combat skills that you have mastered in previous levels if you are to win this one, and read the congratulatory message at the end of the game. John Megan's interpretation of Rastan is a competent rendition, incorporating most of the games' map. The real problem with the conversion is that the graphics just fail to impress in the way they stunned in the arcades. As it is, it's just another good coin-op conversion and the game genuinely deserves better. SCORE 8815388 HIGH 1385488 LEVEL  GRAPHICS SOUND  VALUE PLAYABILITY "

Simple, eh? Up to four people can play. The winner of a two player game is the person who manages to get four of his counters onto his colour pattern on the board. Each player starts with six counters and takes it in turn to place one piece at a time onto an unoccupied square on the board. A move is made either by moving a player's own counter to an adjacent square or by moving one of the spiral wheels clockwise or anti-clockwise. A player on their turn may move their counters and/or turn the wheel in any combination or direction up to the total number of moves allowed. A player is not allowed to place a counter on an already occupied square, nor to \"jump over occupied squares. The rules for three or four players are much the same. You can see the complexities that are already beginning to build from a simple idea. All that's left to say is play the game. And don't forget to check out the packaging. It's probably the most lavish we've seen for a reasonably priced game. There is also a book on the market which, apparently, includes all the spiral patterns that can be made on the board game.

Originally programmed in Russia on the IBM, this wonderful arcade puzzler is being converted to most major 8 bit and 16 bit formats in the next couple of months. As with many of the best games, the idea behind Tetris is beautifully simple. A variety of shapes appear at the top of the rectangular play area, and begin dropping to the bottom. All you have to do, is guide the shapes down so that they fit together, jigsaw-like, leaving as few gaps as possible. Whenever a horizontal line is completely filled by shapes, it disappears, leaving just those lines with gaps. If you allow the build-up of shapes to reach the top of the play area, the game is over does the rate at which the The advantages of fitting the shapes drop down the screen. pieces together efficiently are Sooner or later you will start to twofold.

Thus it is possible for players, effectively playing with different handicaps, to compare their performances. Tetris is nicely rounded off with an atmospheric 25 minute sound track which fits the mood of the game perfectly. Although the game itself cannot boast amazing graphics or digitised sound effects, neither are needed and indeed would only serve as a distraction from what is a brilliant, and totally addictive game. In fact, the boss of Broderbund, a leading US software house, has gone on record publicly as saying that turning down Tetris was the single biggest mistake of his commercial life... enough said!

Somehow it just fails to come alive. The shark has lost its bite. However, if you've never played the coin-op, you won't know what you're missing Now it's own up time. I've never been the greatest Spectrum fan. The games have always suffered when compared to those on the Commodore 64. But I found Flying Shark much more playable on the Speccie than the 64.

" MACHINE: SPECTRUM SUPPLIER: BEYOND PRICE: .95 REVIEWER: PAUL CVG Legend has it that Mike Singleton had written/was writing a game called Dark Sceptre and it was REALLY SOMETHING. At one stage screen shots even appeared of the game and then nothing. For months and months nothing was heard. Had we imagined it? Was it all a dream? Did anybody really care anymore? And then at PCW back in September there was Mike demonstrating the game. Eventually a review copy was forthcoming. It was even scheduled for release in November but, because of C+VG's deadlines, I don't know if the game actually made it into the shelves. So just in case you ever get a Watch THRALL 5th Day executioner. Strikes fear into others. FOOL: A talker, not as foolish as his name suggests. SAVAGE: Wild man of the woods-tough and resilient. THANE TUNED 'S DAY plan 5th Day chance to buy the game, this is what you get. This is a strategy! adventure game very much in the style of what you would expect from the man who invented the brilliant Lords of Midnight and Doomdark's Revenge. The graphics are stunning for the Spectrum. The characters and there are apparently 64 of them are huge. The setting is the Isles of the Western Sea. Power has been lost by the Lord of the Isles to the Northmen and the lands are now under the evil influence of the Dark Sceptre. You control a group of good guys, each with their own powers, who must gain superiority over the baddies. Meanwhile there are lots of other characters floating about who are neither good or bad. Part of the game involves trying to get the undecided onto your side. The game is controlled by joystick-selected commands (or keys) and you give members of your teams instructions to carry out. Having done this, you sit back and watch what happens, following progress on a map. The idea is to find and Destroy the Dark Sceptre, which is hidden among the 4,000 locations in the game. There are a huge number of commands and instructions available to you. For example, you can follow, protect, stalk, harass, avoid, find, challenge, threaten. There are eight different types of warrior you encounter in the game, each with his own powers, strengths and weaknesses. THANE: The commander. Without a Thane, the members of your company will be more likely to desert. MYSTIC: Mystics usually possess magical powers. HERALD: A messenger and a fighter. ASSASSIN: A hunter and a killer: REAPER: The THRALL: An underling, a prawn. Being simple characters, thralls do not have complex personalities. There are lots of them, though. During the game, there are five control options that you can select using up/down on the joystick to highlight the option. The fire button confirms your choice. By using left and right you can change the warrior that you have currently selected. Watch: This option allows you to watch a fight. If you hear the sound of clashing metal, then one of your warriors is engaged in battle. Press fire on this option to WATCH the fight. Scan: This allows you to see a full map of the island, which appears in the viewing window. The positions of each of your warriors are marked in yellow on the map. The white square indicates the position of the warrior that you have currently selected. Check: This option allows you to check the personality of the warrior you are currently watching and the last orders he was given. A summary of his personality appears in the viewing window. Plan: This option allows you to plan your orders for the warrior that you are currently watching. A question and answer session happens in the viewing window until your orders are complete. If you select the GO TO command then the map will appear in the viewing window. You must move the cursor to the place that you want to go to you may only select junctions) and press fire.

The mission is to render the base inactive by attacking it. Destroy weapon and take a ruby back to its temple. Venom has been very, very naughty, and stolen the fabulous ruby from the sacred Crown of Fire, which lies at the base of a dormant volcano deep in the jungle. They intend to use the ruby within a high-powered laser and cause large amounts of damage to several populated areas. What you have to do is destroy the weapon (that is, of course, after you've removed the ruby!) and return it to its rightful owners. The program uses a multiload function, and all three missions are loaded in this way. Each Mask agent is selected from the keyboard. This makes control of the current vehicle extremely difficult you have to reach across the keyboard while trying to defend yourself from oncoming traffic often finishing with your vehicle being either blasted out of the sky, or sunk in a lake.

You've just made your first million from writing a hit game and now you're going to celebrate in style-splashing out on a hugely expensive car. The car salesman, sensing you're a man of means, offers to let you take out any of the cars in the showroom for a test drive. But which to choose. No problem, you'll take them all out with Test Drive. Programmed by Accolade and distributed in the UK by Electronic Arts, it's the latest in 16-bit driving and puts you behind the wheel of five of the world's flashest cars, and gives you the chance to put them through their paces on the open road Before going out for a drive, you can review the performance statistics of each car. The detailed information shown here includes engine lay-out and type, BHP, torque, breaking distances, transmission, compression ratio, displacement, and tyres (both front and rear). The view is from the driver's seat from where you can see the accurately reproduced dash board of your chosen car. Above the windscreen is your rear view mirror, useful for clocking cops before they clock you. If you drive through a radar trap, your radar detector will begin to flash out its warning. When it stops flashing you know you've been clocked. Of course, you can always try and out-run the cops, but don't let them pass you unless you want a ticket. The road, you have chosen for your test drive, winds its way up the side of a mountain. Steer too far to the right and you'll hit the mountain wall, but to the left is a sheer drop down to the valley below, so the idea is to avoid any expensive little accidents by staying firmly on the road Because this is a public highway, you'll meet other drivers, some in cars, others driving vans or lorries. If you're really pushing the car to the maximum, they'll be plenty of vehicles to overtake while, at the same time, avoiding oncoming traffic. To keep you on the straight and narrow, there are plenty of road signs. Some show the speed limit for that particular stretch of road, others show the shape of the road ahead, announces the beginning or end of a third lane for slowcoaches, or informs you that a gas station lies just around the corner. Gas stations give you a breather and a chance to fill up with petrol. You will also get a report, often laced with heavy sarcasm, as to your progress so far. The report includes the time taken to complete the last stage (from the previous gas station) and your average speed. ORE Test Drive is the amount of time it takes to get from one part of the program to another, the continual disk access being a consequence, no doubt, of the graphic richness of the piece.

It turned out that the stones had various uses, some of them military, that gave them immense value. Sadly, while celebrating his good fortune, If it hadn't been for the scrap of blue paper left on your doorstep by uncle Arthur, you wouldn't be hunting for gems on an undistinguished planet called Tanglewood, hidden away in a dusty, forgotten corner of the galaxy. Apparently, Arthur had bought the mining rights to Tanglewood for next to nothing, a price that accurately mirrored the total lack of mineable minerals to be found there... or so it appeared. Anyway, just as Arthur was about to file Tanglewood under dead loss', one of his mining mobiles rescued a native who, in return for his life, revealed that some of the pretty, but otherwise unremarkable TANGLEWOOD From MICRODEAL Arthur was rather too looselipped about his new found knowledge, and news soon filtered back to the company that had originally sold him Tanglewood's mining rights. The next thing he knew, Arthur's mining mobiles were being hounded by the company's own disrupter mobiles; his mining rights documents have been stolen, and the company were claiming that they had never sold the rights to him in the first place, and were bringing a case against him to have him thrown off the planet. It was at this point that Arthur, knowing your prowess in the field of computers, wrote you the note, asking for your help. You have ten days to find elp. You have ten days to find the documents, stolen from your uncle Arthur. Tanglewood is a huge arcade adventure in which you can control a number of mobiles over (and inside) the planet. Each mobile was originally programmed to do certain tasks. Two problems here; firstly, the original programs were full of bugs, and secondly much of the data has become corrupted and is now useless. Mobiles are, to say the least, frustrating to controll As if this wasn't enough you will also have to enlist the help of the native T'nglians who are a friendly, though highly ritualistic species. In fact, it turns out that every kind of interaction with the T'nglians is governed by a rigid set of rules. The graphics of the planet's surface have a quality all of their own, a kind of Tanglewoodian feel you might say. The graphics inside the mine are equally impressive, giving you a first person view of proceedings as you wander through the tunnels. It is difficult to categorise Tanglewood, which in itself is not a bad thing. The game, including movement, is entirely mouse controlled, the only text being in the form of information and reports. Without spending a great deal of time on this one, it would be difficult, and indeed unfair, to give a final verdict on the overall quality of the game as an adventure; the problem being that it seems to be rather vast. If the solution sheets, supplied with the evaluation copy, are anything to go by, Tanglewood should keep problem solvers busy for weeks. S ni h  GRAPHICS SOUND  VALUE PLAYABILITY C+VG HIT!

By manipulating the rotating mirrors, and using the various walls, transporters, and lenses, you must first destroy all the bombs on the screen, before being able to reach the receiver. When the last bomb bites the dust, a section of all, or some other blockage disappears, opening up a clear path along which the beam can now travel to the receiver. Whenever the beam is reflected directly back into the laser, the system starts to CELEK overload, giving you precious 95000 few seconds to avoid disaster, by deflecting the beam elsewhere.

" loriciels \"A thousand centuries ago the human adventure began\". At that time, survival depended on hunting, finding sources of water, medicinal or nutritional plants, and making arms from flint. Your tribe is sick and hungry. Each day, some of your companions die in terrible pain, and the drought is spreading and yellowing the pastures which used to be green. Big game has disappeared and food is becoming more and more scarce. The law of the survival of the fittest replaces the ancestral rights in violent combats between neighbouring tribes and particularly with the blood-thirsty mad hyenas. The number of hunters diminishes every day, and many youngsters have to leave prematurely for the hunt. In order to win, you have to become a valiant hunter and set off to conquer new lands where terrible trials are awaiting. Can YOU survive? A completely hew generation adventure game.

The film and the game open where Skeletor has imprisoned the sorceress and is absorbing her power. HeMan and friends arrive but fail to rescue her. He-Man, Teela and ManAt-Arms retreat inside the hovel of Gwildor, who possesses a cosmic key-a Picture this: A giant of a man, with flowing blond hair, and more muscles on his little finger than most mortals have in their entire puny bodies. Who is he? He He-Man, the world's most powerful man, famous toy, star of the Masters of the Universe film and Gremlin Graphics' game.

Whoever manages to gain the key to time will eventually triumph and rightly claim the title Master of the Universe. And it is the struggle for the key to time which once again brings those age old enemies He-Man and the evil Skeletor into conflict. That struggle between good and evil will be erupting across the silver screen after Christmas when the Masters of the Universe EEBE 90034330 movie, starring mega hunk Dolph Lundgren -an awesome 6ft bins and 240lbs -as He-Man, goes on general release. And now you can take part in that struggle with Gremlin Graphics' Masters of the Universe game based on the film. The planet Eternia, familiar to all those who have seen the Masters of the Universe cartoon series, has been devastated by war. Skelator, that skull-faced incarnation of evil, and his equally awful henchwoman Evil-Lyn, are plotting to destroy the sorceress of Greyskulle Castle and rob her power.

"THE UNIVERSE # C+VG REVIEWS small cylindrical device that can magically transport them anywhere in the universe. Gwildor punches out a tonal code that will allow the group to exit the palace, but a stray bolt of power alters the location. The group disappears through a dimensional door. Suddenly they are on the planet Earth, in a little Californian Town named Colby. And that is really where the game begins. On the way through time to Earth the key is lost and separated into eight musical chords. These have been scattered around the various playing areas which you, playing the part of He-Man, must find before the ultimate confrontation with Skeletor back on Eternia. The game starts in the street with a shoot 'em up where, if you score enough points, you'll collect your first chord. This involves a lot of wandering about and being shot at. It struck me as a little aimless. Having received a message from Teela that your services are required elsewhere, the scene zooms over to a scrap yard where you do battle with two of Skeletor's top henchmen, Blade and Karg. If you win, you're another chord better off. With two chords under your belt, and having. received another SOS, you find yourself on your way to Charlie's Electronic Store where, if you're clever, you'll collect another chord on the way and still have enough energy for a good shoot out when you get there! This time the action is sky high as you race to the top of a ladder and then onto your 'space disc' for the shoot out. This is make or break: Will you claim victory or be outnumbered by Skeletor's troops? If you're taken prisoner, you'll be held captive at the infamous Castle of Greyskulle. If you haven't collected eight chords, Greyskulle has defeated you and his evil power will reign supreme. If you have eight, you have the right to challenge Skeletor. Masters, for me lacks immediate playability to maintain interest. But if you're a fan of the cartoons or the film, you'll probably enjoy the game. It's interesting that the previous Masters of the Universe game by US Gold has now been rereleased on the Americana label at a budget price. That's quite good as well.

"ANOTHER ONE TO E This is it! Another arm-aching. palm-sweating, fingercracking, wrist-wrecking. cramp-creating, musclemangling. joint-jumping joystick round up. And in general we've got a great crop of Value for Money joysticks out at the moment. Right, first joysticks up for the heavy-handed C+VG zip and zap test are from Dynamics. should be, sturdy, well-built, fully microswitched, highly responsive and extremely reliable. The 5000 was the prototype for the Pro Extra and as its counterpart, is of the same design, but is red and black in colour. It is fully microswitched apart from the fire buttons, and has the same performance qualities and characteristics as the Pro Extra and there is also a clear version too. Another joystick which has just come to my attention, which looks identical to the Pro 5000, is actually a Taiwanese import and is constructed in such a way it can only be described as cheap! It can easily be recognised by looking at the rear of the joystick, there you will seen the words Micro Pro. As well as this, when moving the stick, it gives a stiff and rugged feel. This joystick should be avoided at all costs! Price: .95 (Standard model)/ .95 (Clear model). possible to sway it easily, in au eight directions. To go with the auto-fire switch, is an auto-fire speed controller, which can speed up or slow down the pulse rate of the auto-fire mechanism. The fire buttons are just that little bit dodgy. When using them in a rapid motion, they often become stuck, if pressed at an angle. The only way round this is, of course, to press them carefully. Overall, the Micro Handler is a must for all dedicated gamesters and is worthy of adding to your joystick collection. Price: .95. COMPETITION PRU EXTRA EUROMAX PROFESSIONAL The Comp Pro extra has been designed around the same specifications as the original Comp Pro 5000 joystick, except that it's translucent and incorporates an auto-fire and slow motion option. There are also a pair of micro switch fine buttons which give a greatly increased position. Handling the joystick is easy and simple. It fits neatly between both hands, but may take some time until you become accustomed, and eventually comfortable with it. To toggle between auto-fire, normal and slow motion, there is a small switch, which is located at the rear of the joystick base. It can be operated quickly and easily during gameplay. The Competition Pro Standard is still the best, and now that it includes both auto-fire and slow motion, it's a sure winner! Price: .95. COMPETIT The Euromax Pro is probably the nearest thing, when it comes to quality and design, to the Competition Pro 5000. Design of the joystick is identical, apart from a few embosssed decorative and structured extras. The fire buttons are square, instead of round and is yellow and black in colour. Joystick manoeuvrability is just great! Smooth, quick and incredibly simple. The fire Euromax Pro-smooth EUROMAX MICRO HANDLER The Micro Handler is, I can only describe as, as an all purpose joystick, due to the fact, that it consists of a variety of joystick gadgets which include two paddles, an autofire switch, a couple of fire buttons and of course the joystick handle itself. All of these are contained within a sturdy rectangular metal box, with four suction cups at it's base. It is easily positioned neatly and comfortably upon the lap, or can be placed on a table top and held steady, via the Suction cups. The joystick handle is a real beaut, with only one finger, it is buttons give superb response and all microswitches give a loud noticable click, which I feel is very important, as it gives a much better reaction from your ear to your finger. There are two versions of the same joystick, one of these has an auto-fire option and the other one, you've guessed it doesn't. The Professional has definitely got to be one of the best joysticks on the market, let's hope it stays that way! Price: .95/.95 (Autofire) PRO 5000 This was the joystick that started it all. Yep, that's right! The Pro 5000 has been the forefather of what all joysticks "


"CHECK OUT, BRAINS! YO Joysticks, as everybody knows, are seriously crucial to playing computer games. C+VG's lan \"Brains\" Machin and Tony Takoushi look at new joysticks for the Sega and Nintendo Mean machines. EUROMAX PRO ACE MK RACE EUROMAX ELTE Both the Pro Ace and Micro Ace look exactly the same. The only difference is that the Pro ace is leaf switch operated and the Micro Ace uses microswitches. Both look like mini pyramids and have a wide fire button at the front. The Micro Ace gives a relatively good feel and is quite accurate. The Pro Ace, because it uses leaf switches, requires excessive movements to create any response at all. Euromax Elite-good value The price for the Pro Ace seems fair, although having to pay .95 for the Micro Ace, I'd rather save a quid and buy the Elite instead! Price: .95 (Pro-Ace)/.95 (Micro-Ace) The Elite is quite a neat little joystick, and is one of the joysticks in Euromax's cheaper range and is worth every penny. It uses long lasting microswitches and sits quite well between both hands. The Elite would suit people with small hands and at .95 should be within the financial reach of the average game player. It is red and black in colour and the fire button is positioned to the front of the Joystick. The response quality MAGNUM from the Elite is not really up to the Professional's standard, but The Magnum is the ideal it's acceptable. As you may joystick for younger gamesters already know, C+VG has its and can easily be held steady own joystick with our neat little by small hands. It looks rather Vogo embossed on it. like a gun, except that there is Well, our joystick is really no barrel.

"ANOTHER ONE TO CHECK OUT, BRAINS! whole host of games, ranging from arcade adventures to super fast shoot'em ups. Mastertronic have now reduced the price of their magnum to compete against the Speed Kings price cuts. Price: .50. SEGA AZED NINTENDO If you are the proud owner of either a Nintendo or a Sega console you will probably have felt quite a bit of frus tration on using the control ler pads that come with the units, writes Tony Takoushi. This isn't to say they are no good, on some games they are ideal but GEN ERALLY they leave a lot to be desired. I went hunting around to see if there are any alternative joysticks that are compatible with the Speed King Nintendo consoles. I found that Sega have released a new joystick (to be reviewed when I am sent one!) as well as a special trackball controller, I have yet to hear of Nintendo doing the same. Other companies have seen the gap and have stepped in. Wico is well known for its arcade and home computer KONIX SPEEDKING The Speedking comes in three versions for computers and games consoles The Speedking is probably the only joystick which has been designed, solely to fit perfectly into the hand, that is, into a big hand. It's design and size suggests that it can be held in the palm of a large hand. Therefore it is ideal for an adult, and may be found awkward for a child. The stick is easily manoeuvrable, responds well and can handle a considerable amount of frequent pounding. It uses microswitches as does the fire button, which is situated to the right hand side of the grip. There are also two other versions of the Speedking for the Sega and Nintendo, each has all the features of the original Speedking, but include the necessary connections and triggers to make them compatible. At .99. plus the game Thing Bounces Back, the Speedking is even more value for money! Price .99/.99 (Autofire).

"What do a Scottish Earl, a budget software company and extremely fast cars have in common? Computers, that's what. Johnny Dumfries is one of the best young British racing drivers around, and lately he's been seen in the company of Code Masters and their Grand Prix Simulator game currently sitting pretty at the top of the software charts. But there's more to computers and motor-racing than playing games. C+VG went to find out what. TARTAN where he could relax for a while consequences for drivers who he could call up info about how ignore the computers advice on TV much fuel he was using and even -and it must be really how fast he should go to make the embarrassing having to push your fuel last until his next pit stop or car over the finish line! until the chequered flag. Most cars also transmit information to their pit crew once \"Playing Grand Prix Simulator requires accuracy and finesse, says Johnny Dumfries, \"just like driving a real race car.\" And he should know. Johnny's racing career spans 100cc karts, Formula Ford single seaters, up to a Formula One Lotus and the frighteningly powerful Jaguar sports cars. He got involved with Code Masters when the Darling Brothers approached him to endorse their Grand Prix Simulator product. Johnny liked the people and the game and decided that the deal was for him. Johnny is well aware of computers but not because they add to his sponsorship deals. Microprocessors play an increasingly important part in modem racing cars. They control the engine management system, look after the suspension and can even tell you if you're got a flat tyre. The Jaguar Johnny drove last season had special sensors fitted which relayed tyre temperatures back to the cockpit. Johnny could use this to check tyre wear and watch out for slow punctures. If one tyre starting getting very hot all of a sudden there was a high probability of a flat, so he could head for the pits and change the offending bit of rubber. This information is crucial in long distance races and could be the difference between winning and coming nowhere. At Le Mans last year Johnny drove the 24-hour race in a Mercedes with a complex computer controlled engine management system which allowed him access to all kinds of information about the performance of his car. As he belted along the long Mulsanne straight-the only part of the track skin Per Snel Longhi Silk C Silk Cut hin Plus JAGUAR KENALE HOR Castroi SILK CUT Castrol Silkigut a lap as they speed past the pits a microwave pulse from a computer in the pits triggers the on board microprocessor to cough up all its data. That way the engineers and designers can keep an eye on their cars performance during a race. Johnny has also driven an active suspension Corvette in the States. Active suspension means that each of the comer of the car responds independently to the road surface it encounters making the ride much smoother. But all "


"-TERROR relinn this has to be controlled by a chip to make the machine driveable! This technology, already used by the Lotus and Williams Formula One teams will soon be seen on normal road cars. This year Johnny will be driving full time for the Jaguar endurance racing team. Despite his past Grand Prix experience none of the top Formula One teams offered him a drive which is their loss because Mr Dumfries is destined to be a World Champ. But the Darling Dumfries is all set to continue with potential new projects coming continuing their tie-up this year. JOHNNY DUMFRIES FACT FILE contract since 1968.

"ADVENTURE And it came to pass that the Fiend descended from the Folly to move among us ordinary mortals and go in search of adventure. Or rather adventure games. Was he pleased with the state of play? Read on to find out in the latest missive from Folly. The doings of feeble mortals are usually beneath the notice and contempt of The Fiend, my megabrain being involved in thinking thoughts way beyond their comprehension or wit. Only occasionally do the squawkings of you adventurers reach sufficient volume to disturb my meditations in the deep caves beneath the Folly. THIS is one such occasion. It seems there is incredible controversy raging over the relative merits of Infocom games versus Magnetic Scrolls. So The Fiend has roused himself to investigate, and to settle the argument once and for all. For when The Fiend has spoken, so it is, and all discussion ceases. So I loaded up the ST (yes, of course I have got one!) and polished off Stationfall and The Pawn. And then a hush fell over the countryside, to await my verdict. The tension was tangible. Which way would The Fiend lean, and who would bear the brunt of his terrible wrath? Which is the better game? Answering that question is akin to deciding whether an apple is better than a banana. It depends upon your individual taste, and what you feel like at the time, for both are equally worthy fruits personally prefer bananas. Stationfall proves once and for all The Fiend's previous statements that graphics are not needed to make a good adventure. Playing this game was like living a book, or perhaps living in a radio play. And even the unfeeling Fiend, who has spread fear and misery among so many, was near to tears at the end, as was forced to terminate that friendship. The Pawn shows just what can be done with graphics, which are stunning. But strip these away, and is the game a problems to illustrate my case, Well, that's settled that, once and for all. And so to the parsers. Which is better? Neither! For both are more than adequate for the job they have to do, and the fact that with one you can put an object in a pouch on a stump is totally irrelevant, a waste of time, and useless. Would you buy a formula one racing car to go to the shops? Do you actually use multiple inputs? Or, like me, is the bulk of FIEND your typing still verb/noun? The parser question should be of interest only to those who are turned on by the workings of machine code routines. For games players, this is a fruitless exercise. I would point a large, hairy and accusing finger at BOTH parsers for being needlessly pedantic. If I have to type in 'examine' in full once more, shall scream! Don't you parser people realise that the word is used more than any other in any adventure? Are you all completely stupid or something? Surely it is not beyond your wit to use 'X' to speed up play considerably? It may prove of some interest, and come as no surprise, that The Fiend actually succeeded in removing the chastity belt from the princess. What else would you expect of your favourite groper and public nuisance? How I did it I will not tell. But you would not expect me to, good adventure or just a Theck as like?! Hat was firmly would you? vehicle for pretty pictures? plonked back on craggy I will sign off, feeble mortals, Well, it just about works, but dome. with a big hello in the general with a little extra thought it I should have been direction of that verbalist could have been magnificent. suspicious when reading the David Picking of Upminster. If I was about to take my hat off box, for any game that claims he would care to set foot on to it when I finally discovered to be complex and subtle Folly Hill on the night of the the flying platform now! should be looked at askance, next full moon, the Fiend will could rescue the princess for these are merely synonyms show him several tricks of through the window, and for complicated and obtuse!! taxidermy that will make his complete ALL the tasks.

The main entrance to the station is south, behind you. A taxi driver calls out, \"Where to Sgurre? MACHINE: ATARI ST  SUPPLIER: DOMARK  PRICE: .95 REVIEWER: KEITH CAMPBELL Based on Jeffrey Archer's first best-seller, this adventure game can best be described as a computerised novel. Game and book are closely linked, so it is advisable to read the book (included) to benefit fully from playing the game. The player is guided through the plot, and presented with many difficult puzzles which require some lateral thinking to solve. Once an action is taken, there's no turning back! You play Stephen Bradley, a professor at Magdalen College, Oxford, who has been swindled out of $250,000 by Harvey Metcalfe, life-long king of shady deals. Starting off in your college room, you must compile a dossier of information on Harvey. A telephone allows you to contact your stockbrokers, who helpfully inform you that you are not the only victim of Harvey's swindling there are three other suckers. So your task is to band together to steal the money back-total of $1,000,000. Not a penny more, not a penny less. First you must meet these people. There's Robin Oakley, doctor Jean Pierre Lamanns, art dealer-and James Viscount Brigsley, unmarried actor with a mention in Who's Who. The game differs from usual adventures in that you don't have to search through followed by a name, and you are taken to him. For example, if you wish to meet Robin Oakley, you first book an appointment at his surgery, type in EXAMINE ROBIN, and you find yourself in his waiting room. There, as in other locations, it is necessary to think carefully about how to extract the maximum information, which involves talking to the right people at the right time. This sets the scene. Next you mut persuade the victims to band together, and finally you must co-ordinate them as they help each other with the stings. I played the Atari ST version, the first one available, and there will be differences between this and other versions. The BBC B/ Master will have text only, whilst the others will have text and graphics, with speech added in certain locations. The vocabulary is a bit limited for the ST but due to the nature of the game, this becomes only a small niggling point as the puzzles start to take over and compensate for this. This is a tricky game requiring careful thought and planning. If you read the book whilst playing the game, then you will find it a lot more enioyable. Due to the nature of the plot, the game is aimed at the more experienced adventure! strategy player, or those people with a lot of mental agility character.

"Comix SWAN ad boy makes good ... For a maverick writer/artist who refuses to toe the big-company line, Howard Chaykin sure has got a lot of product out at the moment: * The Shadow-a book I mentioned last month in C+VG, which collects Chaykin's four-issue rejuvenation of the classic pulp hero (Titan Books). * Blackhawk-another classic character rejuvenated. At least, I think it is; I haven't managed to get hold of a copy yet. Why do these things never come out on schedule? (DC Comics, approx. .10 per issue.) * American Flagg graphic novel \"Southern Comfort\" three issues of the regular comic-book gathered into one large book. The story dates from early on in the American Flagg saga 1984, to be precise when Chaykin was still providing full story and art rather than just plots and covers as he does now. This volume provides an excellent demonstration of all that's goodand all that's controversial about Chaykin: sex, about .95: quite a lot for three issues of violence, humour, satire ... It's all a comic which probably cost less than a wrapped up in the tale of Reuben Flagg, pound each when they came out. On the a soft-porn actor turned lawman in an o ther hand, the book is at least available, utterly corrupt (so what's new?) post which the comics probably aren't, so to meltdown Chicago sometime in the that extent it's well worth having a look 2030s. Chaykin and his team give us a at. breathtaking, if depressing glimpse of the Time graphic novels: \"The future all urban decay, semi-efficient Epiphany\" and \"The Satisfaction of technology and consumerism taken to Black Mariah\" I'm going to have absurdly logical lengths. It shares the trouble adequately describing these. Are mood of though doesn't copy) Blade they set in the future? In some weird Runner and Judge Dredd. jazz-obsessed parallel universe? I'm not I mentioned Chaykin's team: foremost sure, but I'm in favour of it. among them at this time were his wife, This is Chaykin's most controversial colourist Leslie Zahler, and letterer Ken (ie, rudest strictly for so-called \"mature Bruzenak. Chaykin and Bruzenak must readers\") work so far. The script is have worked extra-closely together here; they've come up with the most seamless combination of art and lettering I've ever seen in a comic-book and between them they create a fast-moving, sometimes confusing and always convincing vision. At least, that's what I thought when I read the original comics. This new deluxe book format has certain disadvantages, however. First is the colouring: it doesn't appear to have been upgraded in the reprint, which admittedly wouldn't be a problem if the paper had stayed the same, too. But what looked exciting and innovative on standard bog-paper just looks garish in this glossy reprint. I expect better for the price which is my second complaint. The book sells for simultaneously bitter and joyously humorous, and the artwork is Chaykin's stylish tour de force, beautifully enhanced by the rich colouring of Steve Oliff. (First Comics, about .50 each). So, who is Chaykin and what's he been up to these past 15 years? He first appeared as a protégé of Neal Adams, to whom his style owed quite a bit. He took over from Adams in mid-issue as artist on Marvel's War of the Worlds, and from there went on to create and draw numerous short-lived heroes for just about every comic company around. After a few years he began to seem aimless and entirely lacking in a sense of what would sell. But during this time he also took part in other people's projects as a way of paying the rent, perhaps? These included some ambitious full-colour painted comic albums (the jargon has evolved: today we say \"graphic novels\"). Here the man's other artistic influences began to shine through the golden age\" American magazine illustrators of the 20s and 30s, and comic artist Alex Toth. My favourite from this period is Chaykin's adaptation of Alfred Bester's \"The Stars my Destination\" (part one and if anybody's ever seen part two I'd be glad to hear about it), but the real clue to his career is his collaboration with Michael Moorcock, \"The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell\". Moorcock, of course, is known foramong other things-his \"Eternal Champion\" cycle. And with that in mind, it's easy to see what Chaykin was up to throughout the '70s whether he was conscious of it or not. He was taking his own eternal champion with him from comic to comic, publisher to publisher. Finally, we can see why there are such nagging similarities between DC's Ironwolf, Marvel's Monark Starstalker and Dominic Fortune, Atlas's Scorpion and Star* Reach's Cody Starbuck and Gideon Faust. To say nothing of Chavkin's work on Solomon Kane and Star Wars. I reckon Chaykin must have realised what he was doing sometime in the early *80s hence the self-consciously wisecracking, deliberately provocative tone of his work since. yoming soon from the makers of 2000AD... Now that 2000AD and the other ex-IPC comics are owned by Robert Maxwell, things should really start to get interesting. For instance, the 2000AD team has announced plans for a new series of comic-books to appear simultaneously in Britain and the US. Some will star established 2000AD characters; others will be specially created. They seem to mean business they intend to attract back top British artists such as Dave Gibbons and Brian Bolland, who now work exclusively for DC and others in the States. And to do so, they say, they're prepared to matchor better the royalties and creators rights available in the US. PHILIP MORTON 114 "


"O FANTASY Role Playing The response to our Fantasy Role Playing supplement in our December issue was so overwhelming we've decided to make it a regular C+VG feature. This issue fantasy expert, Wayne, casts his eye over the best in role playing games and models. STAR WARS ROLE PLAYING GAME PUBLISHER: WEST END GAMES PRICE: .95 RATING: 75% Dwarves, let's have a fight amongst ourselves! Yes, this is what Chaos Marauders is all about, internal feuding between Orcish tribes, for no other reason than to fight and display tribal banners. You play the organiser of a tribe, whose aim is to get three battle lines of troops together faster than any other tribe leader. This makes the other Orcs look stupid and incompetent, plus it shows off the strength of your tribe. Sounds simple doesn't it, but have you ever tried to get Orcs organised before! This game is for two to four players and you try to set the battlelines on the playsheets that are provided. The playsheets are divided up horizontally into three lines of sixteen boxes, and are superimposed on a tremendous piece of atmospheric artwork. The game is very simple to play. You take turn drawing various cards until your turn ends, which can be for any number of different reasons, from possessing too many of the same cards, to attacking another player. The cards are divided up into five colour coded types all of which have different advantages and in some cases disadvantages!). The cards have excellent artwork and are very attractive, not to say humorous. Overall, this game is fast, entertaining and very easy to play. The only criticism I have is that the playsheets are quite flimsy and get fairly tatty after a couple of uses. Also I would have liked the cards to have been made bigger, so that the uses of certain cards could be entered on the bottom, to stop continual reference to the rulebooks. However, there is a wealth of detail in this game and it has obviously been well thought out. So well thought out in fact, that I would predict we will shortly be seeing a series of Chaos Marauders expansions kits on the market! also a good introduction to role playing in general. Would you believe that the \"Star Wars\" phenomenon is ten years old? (Yes. Ed). Since 1977 we have had the films, T-shirts, toys, videos, TV spin-offs, knickers, chocolate bars, and comics.

XYBOTS 1000 Xybots from Atari looks at first sight, incredibly complicated and it's one of those intriguing games where it's best to watch someone playing for a few minutes before shoving lots of cash into the machine. Xybots are robots and range widely in shape, aggressiveness, size and colour. Patrolling tortuous maze of corridors, split by fine partitions, these metal monsters will zap anyone attempting to thread a path through the labyrinth. And this is where you come in, because, whether you like it or not, you're stuck in the maze and the only way to get out is via an exit at the far end. Xybots could have been boring, but some nice features have been added which turns this into an addictive game requiring some skill to beat it. The game is played on a split screen, the bottom holf of which is divided to provide his playing areas, one for you and a partner and though you can play singly, it's more fun with two. The top half of the screen is divided into three with two status boxes for each player and in the middle a map of the current maze. The perspective when looking down a corridor is fantastic. Using the joystick you can change the viewpoint of the maze to the four compass points, each time viewing the area from a new direction. And, of course, that way Pusat SPBU "

"REVIEWS Tony Takoushi checlus out the latest Nintendo smashes, reports on all the hot news and takes a look at your letters. All that and he still finds time to update your high scores. Take it away, Tony. Kelly McGillis fans or even Tom Cruise fans (Hey, we're not sexist!) this is your chance to play the game of the film that made them famous on your Nintendo when Top Gun hits the shops next year at around the twenty five pound mark. As usual l approached a licensed conversion with a little of the cashing-in-on-agood-film-lets-make-a-lot-of-money out of a game cynicism. Somebody out there is determined to turn me into an optimist. Top Gun is a top rate game, no doubt about it, it was written by Konami and will swamp you with its presentation and action packed format. It follows the plot of the film loosely with you at the controls of an F-14 fighter taking on the enemy in air-to-air/air-to-sea and GUMSHOE Gumshoe is an arcade adventure for the Nintendo Light Gun with you taking the role of Stephenson (Doesn't sound v. tough) and trying to get the missus back, but the evil King Dom (who is this man?) is holding her to ransom and wants you to deliver five diamonds as ransom. You play against a smooth scrolling backdrop and must move constantly. Your Macclad here moves 1 by shooting just below his feet to make him jump onto platforms where he wastes the nasties. There are absolutely zillions of sections to work through with many different and challenging obstacles. There are low (and high) flying bottles, boulders, sneaky pits, cars, grasshoppers, flying fish and platforms to negotiate. I could not put this game away! It is ridiculous, the play is simple but VERY CHALLENGING. There are four sections to work through (work being the word) and you can restart at the section you last went out of. Graphics, sound and presentation are slick and you will be missing out on a real GEM (sorry!). An absolute must for light gunners. Graphics Sound  Playability Overall 1950 MEAN MACHINES breakers are played at six games all and there's even a little cup sequence at the end for the winner. This is a good bog standard version of Tennis. Graphics  Sound  Playability Overall TENNIS Tennis What do I say about Tennis (other than I am a real nut for the stuff when it comes to playing the sport!), other than that, it IS TENNIS! The graphics are solid and convey the sense of play well. You can serve, lob (one of my faves) and smash on forehand or backhand quite easily. One of the biggest problems for many sport sims is the lack of response in the joystick, not so with this one. The match is the best of three sets, you can choose from five difficulty levels and select singles or doubles options. Tieair-to ground combat. On starting the game you are presented with a really yummy hi-res piccy of your fighter bursting into life on the deck of a carrier, you then have to choose from three different missiles to arm the plane; Hound, Wolf or Tiger. Each missile has its own characteristics and each has a different quantity (Wolf has 20, Tiger has 10 so sharpen your tactical wit). A map and a message tell you about the mission. There are four of them though level one is purely to get the feel of your fighter with the odd dogfight along the way, level two has you destroying a carrier out at sea (the enemy being destroyers, killer cruisers, shifty subs and planes), level three is a ground defences job (on this level you have to take out the enemy fortress while avoiding or destroying guided missiles and low altitude attack helicopters). The screen has a cockpit at the bottom showing altitude, speed, fuel, damage guage (from enemy fire), missiles left to fire, artificial horizon and a radar. The radar is absolutely vital as it shows the enemy planes coming at you and the angle to expect attack. The radar also doubles up to show you when a fighter is on your tail (the only way to shake him off is to OUTFLY HIM). Initially very simple graphics on the cockpit display BUT do not be deceived the airplanes, ships, tanks, missiles, THE LOT are all superbly drawn and silky smooth. The sound and music fit in perfectly and the gameplay is deep, satisfying and pure arcade gold. "


"WRECKING CREW LETTERS This is a game involving two of my favourite game characters Mario and Luigi. You have to destroy walls that are staggered around the screen and linked by platforms and disposable ladders. On entering a level the screen scrolls up and down showing the play area and where the enemies and walls are. You can climb up or down ladders to get to platforms and some walls take 1, 2 or 3 knocks to destroy (you progress on destroying all the walls). There is help and hinderance, help comes from strategically placed bombs which destroy all ladders and weakens walls on a level, and doors to mislead the nasties which you can open around the screen, drums and pillars are useful for trapping the enemy but watch out for fireballs, the foreman (this guy is a real pain in the...) he follows you around and pushes you just when you DO NOT look behind twenty or so doors characters balloons. to find a coin that is hidden, the There are platforms placed foreman is knocking down the around the screen which you doors trying to beat you to it, can use to drop down on the so you have to move some! enemy to pop their balloons There is a two player option, and then kick them once more a design mode (so you set up to destroy them.

Graphics  Sound  Playability Overall 180 0000 MARIO FOUND THE CO There still seems to be a fair bit of debate as to which system to buy. There really isn't a clear cut answer to this, both systems are superb. At the moment Sega has a better games catalogue than Nintendo in the UK, worldwide the Nintendo has a far greater software base than the Sega. But in the UK at present there is a shortage of Sega carts (even I have a hard time getting them from Mastertronic!) so it really boils down to what you want and how quickly you want it. There have been some tasty tips this month too, Scott Lea tells me that when you get ten lives in Super Mario Bros you get a 10,000 point bonus and a little crown appears. Scott has also topped two million on SMB. Is this the UK record? Tim Wilson of W. York has sent in some tips for Rocky. He says when fighting Apollo keep punching him in the head and try to get him on the ropes, and when fighting Lang forget about the head and concentrate on his stomach. He is also a Quartet fan (my kinda person) and suggests that on round six get the key and return to the surface (via the warp) you will then find yourself on the last screen where the big alien is. To kill him you must destroy him piece by piece starting at the bottom and working your way up. Special thanks go to Peter Russell of Maida Vale, you write long letters but they are interestingl There are too many points to answer here but it's good to see a dedicated Nintendo man, incidentally, the Sega has a 280 processor, 64K of RAM, 128K of ROM, 128K video RAM, 64 colours, screen resolution of 256x192 (in 16 colours), 256 sprites (each sprite being 8x8 pixels in size), three voice and four octave sound chip and can handle cards of 64K and cartridges of 128K and 256K Keep those letters coming. I really do enjoy reading them and I will try to get as many answered as possible (honest!). BALLOON FLIGHT but very cute fish that leaps up and grabs you if you fly too low over a lake that appears on certain screens. There are one or two player options (two player can be team or competition play) and an 'l-can-do-it-if-1-keep-cool bonus round where you have to capture balloons that travel up the screen out of your tubes across the bottom of the screen. There is a really GROO-VY Balloon Trip option where you float from right to left across scrolling screens trying to prick every balloon in sight while avoiding the lightning bolts. The graphics are nothing special and the sound is merely adequate. Nevertheless, the game delivers in its FEEL. Overall this is a great game for those of you with that urge to surge and a little bit of finesse on the joystick. Graphics  Sound Playability Overall Balloon Fight owes a debt to possibly the looniest game ever dreamt up Joust by Williams which featured lancecarrying knights who floated around screen on ostriches attempting to prick nasties with th their poles. For Balloon Fight read Joust Mk2. You control a cutie little character with two balloons on his back (more than a touch of his back (more than a touch of Pooyan) and have to flap your way around the screen trying to puncture other jolly nasty need it.

CASTLE With the coming of the new 16-bit machines we have been spoilt with the large memories they have. Increasingly they are being used for digitised sound effects and digitised pictures. Great, no problem, new technology, new challenges, new presentation Tenjoy great sound. If used effectively AND appropriately, the sound really adds to a game. But just recently a lot of games use them all over the place and they end up giving me a headache instead of making me throb with pleasure. To illustrate the point just look at Barbarian on the Amiga, the title sequence and the grunts and groans in the game are THE best combinations I have encountered to date. They work with the game they do not try to swamp it. Road Wars from Mastertronic also demonstrates that digitised piccys can work to enhance a game and not just be a gimmick. They actively contribute to the -feel of the theme and play of the game because they were designed for the game and not the other way around. At the moment I feel all that lovely, lovely memory is regarded as a novelty and it is a question of 'what can we fit in it.\" All you ST and Amiga owners will have thrilled (as I have) to the boom booms in many of the games, but aren't you getting tired of it again and again? Software houses step back and take an objective look at your products. Enhance the game, don't swamp it... "
