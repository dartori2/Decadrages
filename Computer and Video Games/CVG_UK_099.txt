"EWS MIN EMLYN NEWS DARIUS DUNCE Teeny mistakelet in last month's review of Darius+. The Amiga version retails at .99, and not the .99 stated. Apologies to The Edge. No apologies to Paul Glancey, who made the mistake and has since been hung up in the Ed's garden to feed the blue tits. It's not every day that you get to meet a big star of the software reviewing world like Paul Rand. Recently it was the turn of this lucky young lad, who said his name was Emlyn. As you can see from the picture, cheeky Mr Rand likes nothing better than to entertain his fans, and even managed a cheery smile for the camera as he and Emlyn quaffed at The Hog's Grunt Inn, Cricklewood. After a few jars, the conversation turned to software and, his tongue loosened by the vino, Emlyn revealed that he had actually starred in a computer game himself! Not only that, he said he was soon to appear in another one! Emlyn is licensing his (rather unusual) name to Audiogenic for their latest product, also pictured here. It's a general knowledge trivia quiz game similar to those \"Give Us A Break\"/\"Suit Pursuit\" machines found in public houses across the land, but with a bit of board gaming thrown in for laffs. The game is out on all formats at the end of January, and goes under the name of Emlyn Hughes Arcade Quiz... Hang on... Emlyn Hughes! Didn't he used to be famous...? Blimey... In which century did the Renaissance begin? WHERE'S MORE THE KONIX? DOMARK BONDAGE Where indeed? After numerous telephone enquiries from inquisitive punters we decided to find out what had happened to the Konix Multisystem, which was supposed to be in the shops in time for Christmas. A spokesperson for Konix was only able to tell us that the machine with the original specifications would be on sale for , some time during the first quarter of 1990. \"It was an ambitious project,\" said a Konix spokesman, \"and with ambitious projects complications tend to crop up and hence the delay.\" Oh dear. Our spies in the industry tell us that Domark have bought up the license for another James Bond movie, but unfortunately, because Cubby Broccoli isn't bringing out a new film for a couple of years, they've plumped for 007's outing of several years back, The Spy Who Loved Me. The game is currently in the story boarding stages, but you can expect to be skiing off cliffs and racing about in a missilefiring Lotus Esprit around next July or August "

"GECAY one of the greatest horiU zontally scrolling shoot 'em ups of all time is R-Type. Its combination of stunning graphics, amaz ing weaponry and great gameplay has yet to be equalled. Until now. R-Type II is here. Once again you take control of the R-9 fighter, and once again it's the evil Bydo Empire who you're up against. But this time the enemy is bigger, tougher and more vile than ever. So collect those power-ups, beam up your weaponry and prepare to fight for your right to party. The graphics are fantastic, with revolting, pulsating aliens that really DO look alien, huge motherships with all sorts of horrible squelchy bits, tentacles and dangly things to blast into oblivion, and some really nice effects such as on level two where the action takes place under water. The sound is also atmospheric and really enhances the action R-Type ll is a brilliant blast and is every bit as good as the original.

"EVIEW AMIGA AMIGA TIIIIIIIIIZ   A Borf lets rip with the infanto ray! Yike! A purple path creature! BY ENTERTAINMENT INTERNATIONAL/READYSOFT mini-revolution occurred in the arcades during the early 80's when a chap called Don Bluth and coin-op giants Atari developed the Dragon's Lair coin-op, an awesome graphic extravaganza which used video-disk technology to give the player the impression that he was interacting with a cartoon show. It was very popular, and even though the technology was unreliable, Don Bluth developed a second laser game, Space Ace. By last year, computer technology had advanced enough to allow Dragon's Lair to be converted to the Amiga. Now Space Ace is here. The first game was set in the mythical Dark Ages and starred a blonde, squarejawed hunk of a guy by the name of Dirk Daring. Space Ace, as you'll have guessed, takes place many years into LALAR 74 "

Ace, the hero, and his girlfriend Kimberly are off to crush the tyrannical alien Borf and his gang of weird hench-things, when the big. blue baddie himself appears whisks Kimberly off in his spaceship and blasts laser bolts at Ace.

JULIAN RIGNALL C+VG BY NINTENDO W hen six evil and dastardV V ly villains are all planning to take over the Earth, who're you gonna call? Not the Ghostbusters, that's for sure Mega Man is the guy you dial. He's the hardest hard man in the entire Universe... The six baddies are Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Elecman, Bombman and Fireman, and each lives deep in his own extremely wellguarded scrolling platform world. And it's into these which Mega Man must travel alone, armed only with a gun. Each World has a theme pertaining to the character who lives there Iceman, for example, is found in a cold world of slippery platforms and freezing baddies, while Bombman lurks in a world of walking bombs and guns! All the worlds are infested with baddies who attempt to wear away Mega Man's energy bar, and if it's depleted three times, the game ends. And this happens quite a lot, because Mega Man is one tough game much harder than the Mario games, for example. There are simply loads of horrible hidden traps, tons of very aggressive creatures and, at the end of each level, the big baddie himself. But although the game is very hard, it's also very addictive, and you come back to it time and time again for \"just another go\" it's kept me up until the early hours for quite a few nights running!

Shield of Protection, Potion of Levitation (handy for reaching parts other potions cannot reach) and Boots of Lava Walk necessary for Level Three. Wizards and Warriors is a very simple platform game with some neat extras bolted on. Just when you think you can't get any further or you're stuck in a tight corner, you find the solution and you're off again.

"NINTENDO MEANS MACHINES LIFE FORCE BY KONAMI Life Force, better known in Britain as Salamander, is a brilliant one or simultaneous two-player shoot 'em up which features three horizontally and three vertically scrolling levels. Waves of enemy ships head toward you from the out set, and each time a squadron is eliminated, a power pod is deposited which, if picked up, adds to the player's arsenal. Items on offer include lasers, missiles, A He's heavily \"armed\" (1) speed-ups and drone craft, and they're all needed when you're up against the likes of cosmic stalactites and stalagmites, volcanoes with lava arcing through space and alien growths which swing like pendulums, threatening to crush little old you into a pancake. And of course there's plenty of very nasty end of level baddies to keep you on your toes.. Life Force is a brilliant conversion of the Salamander coin-op, with loads of things on-screen almost all the time, and no drop in speed. The blasting action is on a par with the original, almost to the point of attempting to ram a couple of ten pees into your machine when you die. Shoot 'em up fans shouldn't miss it.

If so, Cobra Triangle is the game for you. It's a multidirectionally scrolling 3D forced perspective game with 25 different levels, varying from racing sections and target shoots to defusing mines and rescuing swimmers from being towed away by enemy-ships! First up is a twisting river down which you must race. There are other boats on the water, which can be blasted out of the way, and also power-up pods which can be picked up to give extra speed, missiles, faster shots, shield or turbos. Finish that and there's a bonus stretch of the river to negotiate: jump over ramps to collect suspended add-ons and mystery extras before the timer runs out. Next is mine defusing. where four mines, guarded by an enemy boat have to be dragged to a detonation area and exploded within a time limit. Fail and you lose a life. Then there's defending swimmers in the middle of a lake from marauding enemy boats. The boats attempt to tow the swimmers away them away: blast them before they reach the side of the lake and tow the swimmers back to the middle and they're alright let the enemy reach the bank and that swimmer is lost. Finally there are two very tough races upstream dodging logs and whirlpools, only to find yourself transported to the lair of a sea monster, which must be destroyed by repeated blasting and there's still twenty more levels to gol Cobra Triangle was programmed by Rare, better known to computer game players as the legendary Ultimate Play the Gamel And like their old games, this is utterly superb.
