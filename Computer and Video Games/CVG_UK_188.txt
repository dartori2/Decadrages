It also made some very loyal fans feel pretty unappreciated. Less than two months after launch, a system sheds  off its original price. In the case of N64, this can be seen as almost half the price! What have you done to deserve this? Well, Nintendo obviously though the UK deserved more of a chance to buy into the N64 fan base. Looking on the bright side, the cheaper the cost, the more likely it is that more people will sort themselves out with a machine. In the long run this means more great games at cheaper CONTRIBUTORS: DAVE KELSALL, YAS HUNTER, CARL WHITE, JASON FRENCH THANKS TO: ELECTROCOIN, ELECTRONICS BOUTIQUE (OXFORD BRANCH), PAUL WILLIAMS SPECIAL THANKS TO: ALL AT HMV LEVEL ONE, OZ BROWNE US CORRESPONDENT: MATT TAYLOR JAPAN CORRESPONDENT: WARREN HARROD prices. Sega dropped from  to , though it took almost a year (June 95 April 96) to get there. One month later Saturn dropped to , to match Sony who had launched at  the previous September. It's a long story, but one you'll find most people have already forgotten. Games manufacturers are unlikely to change their wicked' ways, for as long as there is competition. The question you've always got to ask is how badly do you want to keep ahead. It's now July 1997. You may still want to wait. That being the case, definitely wait until after E3...

Jaime owns some pretty cool SF collectibles, though Game Boy Tetris is his favourite game ever. Jaime's other favourites include Mario World, and New Zealand Story. He never shuts up about New Zealand Story. Though Paul wound up doing a school talk on Pac-Man (!), he is probably more of an all-round fan of Capcom than anything else. More recently he has become a fan of the VF series, but is pretty crap with the best characters! Paul shares Tom's love of all Treasure games. NIGHTS too. Above all Tom is a big fan of the 'real' Sonic series, which doesn't include Spinball or Chaotix but sort of includes NIGHTS. He designed some pretty cool Sonic T-Shirts for Sega too. On a slightly more connoisseur level, Tom appreciates almost everything Treasure have made. Most Namco stuff rates highly with him too.

"computer video games NEWS OF A CVG VERDICT ON THE CURRENT CONSOLE PRICES SATURN [ SATURN FOR UNDER !] SATURN SEGA SATURN s CVG went to press, news was leaked that Sega were planning an incredible price drop for the Saturn, putting it at  from Monday 26th May! If this information proves true, you should be able to already buy Saturns from any retailer at under a hundred pounds, with no game included. The plan also includes a  Saturn deal, with any single Saturn game (pre-Manx TT) packed in. This makes Saturn the cheapest 32-bit+ console on the market! A console price war has been raging furiously between Saturn and PlayStation for over a year now. However, the UK release of the N64 on March 1st put a extra spin on events. With its launch price of , Sony strategically cut the pric of the PlayStation from  to  on the same day. A move that caused the PS to sell out! In response, THE (Nintendo's UK distributor) dropped the price of At , the Saturn is at what we'd say is its lowest price (for a long while anyway). And if you've got the money, it is a solid purchase. There are truly brilliant titles available only for Saturn (Fighters Megamix, NIGHTS, Night Warriors are just a few), and the promise of VF3, Last Bronx, Saturn Sonic and Panzer Dragoon RPG guarantee that Sega Japan's in-house developers are still producing the goods. But the truth is, third party developers don't want to invest in it. We love Saturn, but find it hard to recommend to people wanting a machine with a healthy future. NINTENDO 64 IM PlayStation SEGA'S AMAZING RESPONSE TO NINTENDO 64 PRICE DROP! PLAYSTATION SATURN PRICE SLASHED TO UNDER  100 THE FASTEST, MOST POWERFUL GAMES CONSOLE ON EARTH  can be seen as a direct response to the N64 price-slash! Of course, with this issue going to press before the actual event, there's the possibility of this move not Nintendo 64 to  on May 1st only two months after its release! A move that outraged customers that had contributed to the first shipment of N64s selling out. However, it had its desired effect, pushing sales of N64 above those of PlayStation for two weeks! In the same amount of time, Sega have dropped the price of the Saturn from  to , with two games Sega Rally and Worldwide Soccer packed-in. This, as a response to Sony's  PS. Following the price drop of N64 to , Sega Europe's Marketing Director Andy Mee (who has since left), remarked to Computer Trade Weekly,\" It's a panic reaction by Nintendo because sales of N64 have been disappointing all across Europe.\" However, the Saturn drop to It's  and selling like hot cakes. With third party developers behind it, the range is software is incredible. And in among the mediocre games, there are some truly exceptional ones. Sony are confident that PlayStation will be a mainstream gaming machine into the next century and it looks that way too. If you want to be part of secure gaming market, PlayStation is clearly the best bet right now. TENDO 64 OUTSELLS TATION FOR TWO WEEKS! happening on the expected date. What we will say though, is that it has been planned and if not on the 26th May, then perhaps at the E3...

We'll have a proper feature on the game in buying players, and even playing the games! The thing next month's issue. It's early days still, and public reaction is good. From people's reactions in shops, its clear that Nintendo 64 is technically the best and at  it's now very accessible. However, the games are still around  and there aren't that many great ones yet. Although we don't expect the price to drop again soon, we'd advise the more uncertain purchasers to wait and see how things unfold. The possibility of a yet cheaper N64 and more excellent software is surely an even more tempting purchase. "

When she was a baby she was deserted among some American Indian ruins. Michelle rescued her and lovingly brought her up as if she was one of her own family. Julia loved both Michelle and her tribe and inherited Michelle's martial arts in order to protect her beloved homeland. In the spring of Julia's 18th birthday, a rumour reached her that it was the God of Fighting who was responsible for all of the sudden disappearances of famous martial artists across the world. This God of Fighting is the being that appears in the legends of her tribe. The people in her tribe began to be afraid that Michelle's pendant, (the key to the sacred treasure of the American Indians) which Heihachi once tried to get his hands on in the past, has something to do with this incident. Because of the growing apprehension spreading through the tribe, Michelle went to Japan to question Heihachi. She wanted to learn why he had tried to find the sacred treasure, because she expects that she'll be able to uncover the origin of the power of the God of Fighting. However, Michelle, who left the tribe only to \"ask a few questions\", never returned. Julia suspects that Heihachi has done something to Michelle, and has decided to follow her.

"computer video games PLEASE SEND YOUR LETTERS TO: CVG MAIL BAG COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 37-39 MILLHARBOUR, THE ISLE OF DOGS, LONDON E14 9TZ MAIL BAG WE ARE SORRY BUT WE CANNOT REPLY PERSONALLY TO ANY LETTERS WE RECEIVE. SO NO STAMPED ADDRESSED ENVELOPES PLEASE. E-MAIL: MAILBAG.CVG@ECM.EMAP.COM nd the argument for who owns PILOT WINGS VERSUS FINAL FANTASY (3) the best system continues! To Dear CVG, be honest, we really aren't interested but it's obviously a big issue to many readers, so the battle is allowed to continue here in Mail Bag (sigh). Why not use your chance to feature in CVG as a fan of GAMES?! Oh, and anything else you think is fun (but not too rude). One crucial question from us: got yourself a Tamagotchi yet? Or would you rather die?! I want to say that I do think Final Fantasy VII does look incredibly smart indeed, and I believe anything you say about it, but, you said that Mario 64 was the best game of all time. Will FFVII be better? Okay FFVII is the best RPG ever with a great movie-like presentation. But pre-rendered backgrounds with a few polygons stuck in? We've seen that on the Super NES, surely they couldn't beat the ground-breakingly new rewritten concept of what a video game should be like graphics of Mario 64? Isn't FFVII just the best RPG ever with a fantastic story and great 32-bit graphics and nothing more? I don't think it's as ground breaking as Mario 64. Secondly, you also said that the graphics on Pilot Wings 64 were far better than anything you've seen on a PlayStation and Saturn. Does this mean that they beat the graphics in FFVII? And lastly, if Nintendo do to Zelda what they did to Mario or better, will Zelda 64 blow the pants off FFVII? Oh yes one more thing, because Enix moved Dragon Quest to the PS because the PS had more users, do you think they will move it back to the 64DD since the N64 has nearly the same amount of users as the PS and still shooting up at an alarming rate? James Kenny, Dublin HIP TO THE HYPE NOW WE KNOW WHY YOU CRY has lots of moves which are pointless and all the moves in Soul Blade are used in a specific purpose. Play it as much as I do and then you'll see that this game definitely deserves a High Five. PS If Ed Lomas is as good as you lot are making him out to be, I would love to trash him at Soul Blade. Would there be any way for me to play him. PPS How old would I have to be before I can work on your mag? PPPS Keep up the good work! Mustapha Abbas, Clayhall, Essex Dear CVG First off I must say that CVG is an excellent mag but there are some points that I must complain about your preview sections. For people who buy imports, the previews are very misleading. You say that a game is going to be a hit or is gonna be a good game and the game is hyped. For the people who buy imports and can't be bothered to wait for the review because it takes so long in your mag that they buy the game and a few issues later you say the game is crap. Also what takes you so long to review games. What ever happened to the review of Rage Racer? The game came out in Japan in December and you still haven't reviewed it. You have to consider people who buy imports you know. Another example is Resident Evil. I remember it took you about six issues before you finally reviewed it and I know it doesn't take six months to complete Resident Evil. One final point. In issue #186 you gave Soul Blade a Four. I bought the game in January and me and my brothers still play the game. You say that the game won't last long but that's only if you play it by yourself, and who does? Not enough moves you say. Okay, so there may not be as many moves as Tekken 2. But Tekken 2 CVG: We NEVER hype a game which we expect to be poor quality. We recognise 'crap' immediately. The only time we can remember a game not living up to our high expectations was Mario Kart 64 which we anticipated to be flawless. Mario Kart 64 was rewarded four out of five. Imperfect, but hardly 'crap'. We usually review the biggest games on import, with only few exceptions. In the case of Rage Racer Namco specifically requested that we wait until the UK version. The amount of pages we dedicated to Rage Racer, and Soul Blade should give you some indication of how much we love playing them! Speaking of playing the games, Soul Blade has been played, and enjoyed, by most of the CVG team. Plus Ed dedicated a lot of time at home to find everything there is to know. Soul Blade deserves four out of five, which is usually the highest recommendation we feel confident to award any game without fear of negative come back. You appear not to have considered that there may be better games around, in this case Fighters Megamix on Saturn. Until Mustapha Abbas has spent as long as we have playing this AM2 classic, we suggest that he keeps his accusa tions to himself. PS Ed is considering. PPS Ed started doing Freelance work at the age of 16. CVG: We said that Final Fantasy VII is currently the world's most astounding video game, not the most original. Though FFVII is not so revolutionary as Mario 64, it is a monumental achievement. The finer details shall be explained closer to the game's UK launch. Briefly, the way Squaresoft knit together all kinds of visual techniques is astonishing. The gameplay is also brilliant. As for the graphics in Pilot Wings 64, and comparing them to FFVII... perhaps the word 'better' is confusing. Technically superior is easier to explain, as there is still no detailed 3D environment to equal the quality of detail in PW 64. The producers Paradigm are 'the boys' when it comes to real-time 3D. In FFVII the visuals are more likely to floor the average consumer. Zelda 64 is a different category of RPG to FFVII. It isn't realistic to compare the two. And, finally, there's no way Enix will suddenly switch DQ VII back to N64 just because of 64DD (excuse the abbreviation frenzy!). TENGER SE Should Soul Blade have been awarded a High Five N LONG ULONG 1491 2 LONG Saturn owners be happy! You have Fighters Megamix the best 3D fighting game around! O  Namco "


"SNK AIN'T HAD THEIR DAY! WARNING! WARNING! CRINGE ALERT! computer video games Dear CVG, I am a loyal and happy Sega Saturn owner, who does n't give a fiddlers f*** about how many polygons or what have you the PlayStation can handle. I want quality and entertainment, which is exactly what my Saturn provides. However, instead of another boring letter with a list of reasons why Saturn is better, I have written a song to be sung to Michael Jackson 'Black or White'. Dear CVG, Is it just me or has everybody forgotten Neo Geo players. I have owned and played most consoles over many years, my pride and joy is the Neo Geo CD. I have been reading your magazine since the 1980's and I am very disappointed that you no longer cover any Neo Geo games. What happened to the reviews of King of Fighters 96, Metal Slug, and the brilliant Samurai Showdown 4. And please don't let Samurai Showdown RPG pass by. When SNK finally release their 64-bit hardware people will all of a sudden start to give SNK the credit they so rightly deserve. Kenneth Dempster, Belfast This is the Neo Geo version of Samurai Shodown IV. \"I couldn't wait to play my new Saturn game, I've already got loads, but no two are the same, Now I believe in miracles, and a miracle could ease Sega's plight, Please print my message even though it's not fun, I wanna say Sega aren't second to none 'Cause they know about IF IT PLAYS LIKE quality, and it's A TOTAL DOG, WHO true they always deliver it WANTS TO KNOW?\" right So if you're thinking about buyin' a console then the Saturn should be in your sights.\" CVG: Currently SNK stuff is more exciting when it appears on the Saturn and PlayStation few people are too thrilled with the original machine. And is 64-bit really the magic number? We're not so sure anymore. But a new piece of kit from SNK will be exciting. A Saturn version is possible. THE FORCE IS STRONG IN THIS ONE It may not be very good, but my song just wants to say that graphics don't mean anything to the true gamer because, in the words of Kevin Robson (issue #182)... Martin Flanagan. D'OHI * NOW WE KNOW WHY YOU CRY me? 3:08.4 5801316:03 CVG: Your \"true gamers\" love great graphics Dear CVG, as much as anyone else, Martin. Which is Thank you. Thank you.

Paul Green, Broadstairs (00 CVG: Our private little worry is this: apart from a few exceptions, the bland nature of most new releases isn't likely to trigger enough excitement for a new breed of consoles. Everyone who owned an 8-bit machine longed for 16-bit power. Same with 16-bit and 32-bit. This isn't the case any more. We're pretty much sequelled out already. The level of originality doesn't match up to the step up in technology. Hardly any new heroes, and some that exist have been ruined. Still, let's wait and see. Not like us to be pessimistic at all. (By the way, does anybody out there agree?) Ed: Weirdo. 13 "


"computer video games MAN WITHOUT A CLUE TOP 2019.00 29884 STAR LETTER BREAKING THE HABIT Dear CVG, Namco Museum? Why? Sure these were and are great classic games, but .99 for just six of them. These games are very basic and if you can really store so much information on one CD then Namco could fit all their retro games on one CD and still only charge . In my opinion these titles should be given away on magazines. Don't get me wrong, I love my PS and most of the games are mind-blowing. But I saw in your magazine the other day Sega's new retro games package featuring Afterburner, Space Harrier, and Outrun. This just p****s all over Namco. All I need to smarten up their act and give us some value for money. Brett, son of Chicken Hawk, Eastleigh Space Harrier by Sega (years ago). A classic game for many. TCP 3060300 SOLEG S83520 CVG: Sacrilege! Give away Pac-Land?! Give away Ordyne?! If you hadn't already admitted it, we would have suspected you of being a Son of a Chicken Hawk all along!!! New argument everyone: Which are better, old Sega games or old Namco games? LIME 36 SCORE 1208060 L 32 START HOUSE Dear CVG, I am growing very concerned with the current state of your magazine, and have been for some time now. For one example, the April issue was nothing more than an advert for, clearly your preferred machine, the PlayStation. You really must contain yourselves if you are producing a multiformat magazine with a high reputation such as CVG. Reputation is something that you are losing and damaging for CVG, eg You are constantly being accused of biased reviews, your new rating system has received a hostile reception, and some reviews are littered with gross exaggerations and contradictions. You must keep a balance. I recall a few months back an over anxious Saturn owner suggested you give a Saturn demo disk away. You quite rightly responded that it would be unlogical for a multi-format magazine to give away a product for any one machine. A few months on and we get a PlayStation video shoved down our throats, probably due to your fears of its sales falling due to N64's arrival. Had the video consisted of all the formats you cover, such actions would have been understandable. It would even have been forgivable if it was solely an N64 video purely because of the excitement surrounding the world's first 64-bit console. But PlayStation? Come on, the machine's around three years old now! Your love for the PS is so great that you probably are not aware of your actions. Personally I care little for these 32-bitters as have a nice new imported N64, but I cannot tolerate a biased nature in CVG, the magazine for games and games players. Anyway before I sold both my PS and Saturn due to the boring lack of originality in games, I will say that as far as visuals in the 32 bitter depth Panzer Dragoon Zwei remains king. Only N64 is far superior, that really is the way forward. Please do not be offended by my letter, I am genuinely concerned with the quality of CVG. I don't want to stop purchasing it, and I admire your courage of introducing a new rating system. I hope you can all take a little criticism if you can't then | overestimated you. Eubasaben.S.O.Jessop, London I55, Go STAGE 6 You're looking at state-of-theart graphics circa 1986! STACE SE Basic, yes. But easy, oh no-oo! Finishing first was never easy. BUT YOU SAID THEN YOU SAID.. NOW WE KNOW WHY YOU CRY * fall into this category are Desert Strike, Return Fire, Blast Corps, and Body Harvest. Sure you get set missions, but that's also another point of why they belong in a category altogether. Please tell me what you think of this suggestion. Matt Simpson, Milton Keynes Dear CVG, There are a few things I would like to tell you about your magazine, and computer games in general. Please would you try your best to answer my questions and consider the points I have to make. 1. In issue #178 Paul Davies rated Pilot Wings 64 5/5. But in issue #184 Paul Davies rated Pilot Wings 64 4/5. Why is this? 2. Another point about PW64 is that it was rated 4/5 with a comment of \"could be too disjointed for some players\". Yet Turok got 5/5 with a comment of, \"3D action game which everyone will love.\" You may find this hard to believe but not everyone loves these Doom-style games. Although in this case I believe Turok is an excellent game, but I would still prefer PW64. You should leave comments like \"if you were a fan of the original PW you can add an extra notch to that mark\", or, Â«If you liked Quake, you'll love this.\" I feel the end comment should be made depending on what type of game it is. 3. Have you noticed the new type of game category out. I'll call it \"Destroy\". Games that Paul: As Tom is always telling me, it's a sign of intelligence if you change your mind. So / gave it a try. Now I can recite the 24.34 times table backwards. 2. You're even less likely to appreciate everything about PW64 if you loved the original. CVG: Destroy is a good word. Who knows, Matt, we might introduce it. G0/11 02:00 o CVG: The Sony video was a paid-for advertisement. Usually companies use pages inside the magazine to sell their products, in the case of the video Sony needed a stronger tactic. You were right about the fears generated by N64, but they were Sony's fears not ours. Their video. Their hype. Inside the magazine we are always careful not to side with any one system, though this does not, and should not, prevent us from shouting about exciting prospects. Could it be that Eubasaben Jessop is regretting the sale of his Saturn and PlayStation? A few of us here couldn't survive without the existing library of games for those \"32-bitters\". Currently the N64 is limited to a very small selection. It appears you consider yourself above it all now that you have a 64-bit machine, but you're missing out BIG TIME on the thrills offered by Fighters Megamix and Rage Racer. Of course you'll be determined to consider PlayStation and Saturn as has beens. Far from it! Sure we can take criticism. Blundering, inaccurate, accusations such as yours are less likely to be taken seriously. Good letter though. So, thanks. 5831131 $592100 14 "

"computer video games AXO 100% TENDO 64 SHOOT 'EM UP BY NINTENDO OX SNES PREDECESSOR AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 128MB CART COMPLETE OUT NOW 1-4 PLAYERS  RELEASED BY NINTENDO TEL IMPORTER NINTENDO 64 If you're not yet excited by Starfox, you should be. The Nintendo 64 is hotting up, and they don't get much hotter than the return of Fox McCloud! M that fact. The Cho it just was FOX DEMULS ario Kart 64 was a bit of disappointment, there's no hiding that fact. The classic playability, the multi-player frenzy... it just wasn't the same. Which probably explains why the excitement levels surrounding Starfox 64 waned a little in the CVG office. Now it's arrived, we've all played it and we've all come to the same conclusion: this is what Nintendo should have done with Mario Kart! The same and yet different. Once you start to play, you get the same feeling that sprung from the first game as you cruise through Corneria. The ship's handling, the obstacles and the gameplay all have resemblances to the original, and yet offer enough variation to make it feel like a completely new game. And when you reach some of the bosses, you begin to realise just how impressive the N64, and more importantly Starfox are. Only a few more months to wait, and it's all yours... WHY IT'S BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL... FOX MCCLOUD ARRIVES ON NINTENDO 6411! Starfox had its limitations. There was the restriction of flying straight into the levels along a set route, despite the various secret paths like the fruit machine. We can now look back in hindsight and admit it was a little limited. The N64 version is a completely new ball game. It still keeps the same forward flying stages, but manages to mix in a couple of other variants to give it the depth it needed. For a start you can jump into the Landmaster tank. The All-Range mode is also new, giving you complete freedom once inside the stage (usually a boss level) as long as you stay inside the parameters. The four player mode gives it increased lastability, to keep you playing even when the one player mode is complete. The submarine stage also presents another new control method, with the immensely slow but action-packed under water levels. All in all, Starfox 64 represents a huge and mightily impressive leap in progress. 0800 0000 THE LANDMASTER FLASH Most of these enemies release rings once killed. The Landmaster is the latest weapon the Starfox team employ in their battles with Andross and it is utilised on at least two of the stages Macbeth and Titania. The tank has the same basic weapons as the Arwing, with laser shots that can be charged up into homing bolts and megabombs. And it can fly, if only tempo-rarily. Pressing the right shoulder button or Z will still give you sharper turns in that direction, but a double tap will send the tank somersaulting in that direction for an immediate dodge. Press R and Z together and the tank will take off for about four seconds worth of airtime. 0000 COMING SOON FOX COMPLETELY NEW GAMEPLAY STYLE! DIS The biggest asset the Landmaster has in terms of gameplay is that it's so far removed from piloting the Arwings. For a start it's a much slower moving vehicle, so you need to be constantly aware of what is going on around you because it takes more time to dodge enemy fire. And as well as keeping an eye out for what is happening in the sky, you also need to be on the look out for mines and ground based baddies, otherwise you end up being blown about all over the screen! 18 Nintendo "

When you pilot the sub the first thing you will notice is that it doesn't carry megabombs. They have been replaced by homing torpedo bolts, of which you have an infinite supply. When the target appears on-screen, it indicates that you have locked onto something and all you do is fire. Unfortunately, you can only have one on-screen at any time. The aquatic vehicle is similar to the Landmaster in that it has slow handling, but couple that with the near zero visibility of the stage, and you need all of your skill to pass through. Knowing when to use the homing weapons is vital, because firing one far into the distance limits use of others.

You are then thrust into an arena with the other three players and all you have to do is hunt each other down and kill them. The flips and the rolls become especially useful here because you have to shake people from your tail or be fried. The options can be customised, but generally you play the first to three kills. If a player finishes themselves off by crashing into a building, whoever was last to get a hit on the kamikaze pilot scores a win. But the fun doesn't end there.

The idea of Doom in the Star Wars Universe had to be one of the most desired gaming concepts. The result, with its excellent Dark Trooper plot, provided all the thrills a Star Wars fan could have asked for. Nearly.

"computer Video games THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM IN HERE FOR ME, MRS VADER AND LITTLE DARTH JRI ROM A TECHNOLOGICAL TERRORI RETURN OF THE JEDII Jedi Knight uses a new game engine, far in advance of the original, featuring texture-mapped polygonated characters in a similar fashion to Quake. One factor that sets Dark Forces 2 apart though, is the option to switch to a third person perspective, like Tomb Raider. This obviously adds a lot to the polygon count, and may cause some problems in multiplayer mode, as you witness all your character's intricate animations. However, it should prove useful too, as you get full 360 degree vision during epic lightsaber battles! With all this talk of Jedis, it may be hard to believe you play the same character you did in the first game young rebel mercenary Kyle Katarn. While he was more of a blaster-brandishing Han Solo-type then, Dark Forces 2 changes his destiny dramatically as he's taught the ways of the Jedi by Master Rhan. The plot, as revealed through 45 minutes of cinematic cut-scenes, reveals that he must stop seven dark jedi from unleashing powers locked away in a jedi burial ground. DF2 adds a stronger RPG flavour too, as you build up Kyle's experience through training, and also have to decide whether to lead him down the path of good or bad. This strong character involvement also affects another vital part of Dark Forces 2... LEARN THE WAYS OF THE JEDI IN DARK FORCES 2! THE MULTIPLAYER GAME! The new third-person view in Jedi Knight. Like Tomb Raider! \"The multiplayer features in Jedi knight are exactly what Dark Forces fans demanded the most in a sequel.\" said co-Project leader Justin Chin. This factor, sorely missing from the original, comes to Jedi Knight in a unique way. Allowing eight players to link-up, you can actually play your own trained-up Jedi. This adds all kinds of possibilities to deathmatches that even Quakeworld doesn't offer! Imagine battling your young, inexperienced good Jedi against a dark Jedi master. With team options too, you can even have epic good-versus-evil battles! Many familiar characters And this is Greedo. Or at least appear. Here's Bosk from Empire. a similar looking Rodean.

They lock on to targets! While Xevious may be 3D, thus giving it a huge graphical leap over its predecessors, Namco decided to retain the look of the original. So whereas most 3D games use texture maps to give objects a more realistic look. Namco have done the opposite, deciding texture maps detracted from the appeal of the original. Xevious has a history of not being state-of-the art. Instead it has built a reputation as a solid addictive blaster. There are still nice ideas in this 3D environment, such as falling objects and a sweeping, panning virtual camera. However, might the modern gamer have preferred a better looking game? da SOLVALU? IRANU . The only line of defence between the planet you're protecting, and the marauding Xevious horde, is your trusty ship. The Solvalu. Or three of them if you're going to get picky. During the mission, power-ups can be obtained by locating crystal towers. The towers contain three different colours of crystal red, green and blue. Destroy the tower and the crystal is freed. The different coloured crystals have varying effect on your weapons systems. Blue fires the same missiles as the standard craft. But the payload is multiplied by four, with missiles being spread in an arc. Green fires a single Experimenting with powerful laser beam, and the different weapons best of all red which has is required for the a similar effect to the enemies. Some are Emperor's lightning bolts better suited to in Return of the Jedi. The specific bosses. lightning bolts have the unique ability to lock-on to their targets. XEVIOUS MUSEUM VOLUME ONE COMING SOON Namco in their on-going act of generosity (putting additional PlayStation-only features in their arcade conversions) have included more than the single game here. There are three other Xevious games from yesteryear on the CD. Starting from the original Xevious, add the sequel Super Xevious. Plus from 1995, Xevious Arrangement. While this trio of games may look remarkably similar they are different. All contain the same graphics, but feature an increasingly tougher challenge. Learn the different waves and patterns of attacking craft, to become the true Xevious master. TE FL MISCHIEVIOUS XEVIOUS As in most shooters the Solvalu can fire both missiles and bombs. Xevious 3D is out now in Japan. We still haven't heard of an official release here yet, but being a Namco title makes it kinda inevitable. In the meantime, keep watching, the skies! 30 "

"computer Video 85% games BRED PLATFORM PLATFORM BY ODDWORLD INHABITANTS  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD COMPLETE TM SEPT RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS PlayStation  RELEASED BY GT INTERACTIVE TEL 0171 258 3791 PlayStation A strange name, strange characters, and what looks like a plain old platform game. But Abe's Oddysee is a lot more than that. ou play as Abe, an insignificant alien working non-stop in a mine controlled by disgusting masters the sligs. It is your task to get Abe out of the mine alive and away home, taking as many of his friends with him as possible. The game has an excellent movie-like feel, starting with a fantastic rendered introduction sequence and continuing all the way through the adventure. While you may have trouble understanding what's so great about Abe's Oddysee, believe us that it's going to be one of the best original games of the year. DDVSD rii ALERT A MUDOKON, SAY ! INTRODUCING... THE ODDWORLD INHABITANTS BRILLIANT PLATFORM PUZZLE ACTION! HELLO! HELLO! FOLLOW ME! OKAY! PRRP! HUHUH! If you've having trouble working out what games have previously been made by Oddworld Inhabitants, the creators of Abe's Oddysee, it's because it's their first game. Members of the team have been responsible for such computer graphics attractions as the Back To The Future ride at Universal Studios, and they've approached video games from an unusual angle. For example, one of the partners in the company who hadn't played video games much before commented that it didn't make sense to her that when Abe went off the right of the screen he appeared immediately on the left side for the next section, so there are ODD WORLD now movie-style sweeping cuts between WHIRITINTS scenes! Oddworld Inhabitants are also intending to make the game adjust itself depending on how you play, as well as using lots of other interesting techniques to draw you into Abe's world. Abe's powers let him create magical portals through which the other workers can escape! SUPREMELY LOVELY GRAPHICS! One big thing that sets Abe's Oddysee apart from other platform adventure games is that you can talk in real-time to other characters. By holding and pressing certain buttons, Abe can come out with set phrases to which the creatures in his area will react. As well as standard phrases like \"Hello\" and Â«Follow me\", Abe can laugh, snarl, whistle codes and even do a bottom burp! Also, when Abe possesses another character, he can use eight of their own phrases as well! It's hard to explain how well this feature works, but believe us it's excellent. The characters in Abe's Oddysee are not only completely original and brilliant to look at, but they also move incredibly smoothly. The whole look of the game is similar to Delphine's Another World and Flashback, though the backgrounds are beautifully rendered in 3D. There are also part where the rendered backdrops play as full-motion video, moving the game view into and around the scenery much like the most impressive sections in Final Fantasy VII! POSSESSION IS NINE TENTHS OF THE LAW NOOS ONIWOD Abe's looking a bit worried. 1997: AN ABE ODDYSEE Using his psychic powers, Abe can possess other characters! At your command, Abe goes into deep meditation, causing magic energy to appear around him, then move to the nearest available target. More often than not this skill is used to take control of an enemy character and gain access to areas where you'd normally be blown away for entering. While playing as a different character. you can use all of their skills and vocabulary, then once you've finished, with them... make them explode! There are also times when Abe's powers can be used to read hidden messages or to move small items. While Abe's Oddysee may seem almost complete, it's not due for release for a few months more. All of the levels are in place, but Oddworld Inhabitants are still adding finer details which could make Abe one of the best games of the year! Riding on this two-legged creature is excellent fun and lets Abe jump further!  "

A time when playability was all that mattered. Now BallBlazer is dusted down and given the PlayStation make over o more wars. That's how the sport started. A diversion to replace the bloodshed. One fortnight each year, species send their best rotofoilers to compete for the Interstellar BallBlazer Championship. Like most takes on future sports, BallBlazer is the most popular sport in the galaxy. It has simple rules, is fast, aggressive and action-packed. Your task is to win twelve matches against increasingly difficult opponents. Take on the champion BallBlazer Xarta, and be crowned Master Blazer. Be warned, you need real skill to become the champion. BLRR DOLCI CHFLMF1DN 5 YOUR ROTOFOIL SIR The Rotofoil is the craft you need to play the game. All different, with varying abilities and a default power-up. There are eight different foils to choose from. Each comes with the owner of the craft. Take on the persona you like best and you're ready to go Ball Blazin'.

Because you're going to need that trick defending situations like this. BallBlazer achieved instant classic status when it debuted at the beginning of 1986. Receiving such comments from our peers as 'the best sports game yet' and 'THE one-on-one sports simulation'. Back then the game had the same simple premise and similar rules. The arena was a simple checkerboard 55 squares long and 21 wide, with two goals at either end. Rotofoils did not benefit from power-ups or an upgrade shop. However, each of the eight computer opponents had increased Al, as you progressed through the levels to become Master Blazer. Scoring was similar to basketball. A shot from way out would earn you three points, in front of goal only one. The really huge difference between the original and update is, the game is always viewed as a split-screen. Even in one player mode. Tactically important, as you can always see the other guy. Released back when LucasArts were still called LucasFilm. The game arrived at almost the same time as two other greats by LucasFilm Koronis Rift and The Eidolon! A trio of releases to firmly cement their commitment to games.

"2 IN THE ARENAN IN THE ARENA computer video games ORGASMATRON MATMOS PLASMORB ES The Plasmorb is a ball of magma. When in possession of the orb, your Rotofoil is drained of energy. Skilled players will learn the trick of dribbling the orb. Launching it in front of your craft, then using a turbo to regain possession. When not in possession of the orb, an on-screen radar will indicate its position for you. The X button is used to perform a Roto-Snap, a manoeuvre that was present in the original. RotoSnapping always places your Rotofoil in the direction of the orb. Very handy, but again energy draining. PlayStation In this stadium you need lots of power. Ramps play an important role here. 0 REPLAY sono 85803 A huge tube which can get confusing. Power-ups are in hard-to-reach places T.ESE IS TE RULES THE BALLS RETURN IN A BLAZE OF GLORY 154.7 BallBlazer is a relatively simple game. Taking aspects of some of the more popular modern sports. Equal parts football and hockey. Set in huge arenas, with two goals usually at either end. Two combatants enter the arena in their customised rotofoils. The ball or Plasmorb as it's officially called, is launched into neutral territory. Then whoever scores the most goals in the allotted four minutes wins. Alternatively the first player to score five wins the round. Each match being a best of three series. LOOK OUTIG 5 POWER-UPSIC New to the sport of BallBlazer are power-ups that appear through-out the contest. Look out for special zones in each arena. There are eight different power-ups varying from land mines to homing missiles and cloaking devices. Some more useful than others. Also worth collecting are the credit crystals, each worth 100 credits. These come in very handy at the upgrade shop at the end of each match. 2470-6 14 Power-ups randomly appear, so pay attention.

Killing becomes your business as you aim to be accepted by The Mob! ROM 743 Cue ake no mistake, Grand Theft Auto is morally offensive. Before you get carried away playing the game, you have to get by the fact that GTA carries an 18 certificate. Why? Well, first thing to know about GTA is that the only way to score, and get through the game, is through the senseless slaughter of innocent civilians and officers of the Law. There's also opportunity to practice some 'professional' vandalism along the way. Your ultimate goal is to become accepted by The Mob, raising your status from small-time criminal to notorious hood.

And they are huge. Liberty City, San Andreas, and Vice City, are near-as-damn-it New York, San Francisco, and Miami respectively.

"HOW TO QUALIFY computer video games You need to set the fastest possible lap time on the LAKESIDE GATE circuit. The Challenge takes place under the Time Attack rules, mean ing that you don't have to worry about other cars. Just you, the road, and an audience of people who don't believe you can do it! CHALLENGE TIPS 1 This is the course you'll be racing. A lot of sharp corners, and tight chicanes. We've been playing Rage Racer since before Christmas '96. so we know the game well. Here are some useful tips for Lakeside Gate, assuming that the car used for preliminary rounds will be the basic Gnade. W CHALLENGE TIP NO.1 M CHALLENGE TIP NO.2 CHALLENGE TIP NO.3 CHALLENGE TIP NO.4 A CHALLENGE TIP NO.5 This first left-hander should be taken as soon as the car's nose is in line with the barrier. Don't use the brake. Only a tiny adjustment is necessary to make it through this chicane. Don't over steer, and don't use the brake. In faster cars you need to power-slide onto this bridge. In the basic Gnade you can make it full power. NO BRAKES. The ONLY place brakes are required in the whole circuit. Take the outside line and brake till you clear the barrier. It's tempting alright, we know. But, for the last time, don't use your brakes here. The final sbend is taken full speed.

Start here on the road to becoming a gaming god by revising this schedule! This month's events and software releases at a glance. June July. NINTENDO he calm before the storm. That's probably the best way to describe this month's release schedule. Even though the amount of games hitting the shelves is down, the quality is very much on the up! Dark Forces 2, Resident Evil and Dungeon Keeper arrive for PC, Grand Theft Auto for both Saturn and PlayStation, Syndicate Wars for the PS and King of the Fighters for Saturn! Doom 64 sneaks in the back door as well. Whatever format you've got, there are some awesome titles looming over the next four weeks. We hope Nintendo choose E3 to show 64DD games. Marvel Super Heroes! How much longer can we wait?! * WIN! WIN! WIN! * SYNDICATE WARS 19-21st June Atlanta, America. THE biggest games event of the year. If you're a games company and you want to get your product seen, this is where you take it. Anybody who's anybody will be here, along with some of the biggest games ever! Expect to see more info on Project Sonic, Saturn VF3, Time Crisis and 64 DD to name just a few. Needless to say, we'll have a huge report on the whole show in the next issue of CVG. SO2 Another simple one this. CVG has it's own Lottery Syndicate, which we do every month and all we want you to do is guess what you think our numbers are. Whoever gets the most numbers right wins the game. Unfortunately we cannot share any of the winnings if we happen to win between now and the closing date, because we'll be in the Bahamas sunning ourselves and getting Ed to fan us down with giant palm tree leaves. Send to: MY LUCKY NUMBERS Is Sonic kicking the bucket here, or your ass? Sega promise we'll find out at E3. Time Crisis is becoming more popular each time we say so. Which is pretty often.

So what we want you to do is send in a photo of your ugly mates. Even yourself if you happen to be a bit of a minger.

Which is why we plumped for something a little out of the ordinary as the winner. Laydeez and blokes, we present the Swords in the Head thingy. Basically, the bearer of this awesome weapon has the ability to store three swords in the top of their head. The first is a normal weapon, the second is a laser sword, and the third is a blade with a button on it to change it into anything! Cool. Congratulations go to Zabe Ashig from Scotland.

Mario Kart 64 is finally given a review! BUT KOLART. TM hew, we finally made up our minds in time for the PAL release. What should have been the easiest game to review ever, has instead become one of the hardest. That's how fond we are for the original, one of the greatest games of all time! So treasured was it in our memories, that we couldn't admit that Mario Kart 64 wasn't what we had hoped for through those wilderness years. We had to take our time, inspect every millimetre of each course, study each driver. Perfect power slides and shortcuts. Still we hadn't come to a final decision. Until now. THE GREAT ESCAPE NVION End Luigipaip Yos! The first skill you really need to master is the power slide. For not only does it allow you to cut corners, but when done well, can be turned into a mini turbo speed burst! The trick is to slide and waggle. It's not rude, just read on. As you enter a turn, pressing the shoulder button to slide in the direction you're steering. While still holding the shoulder, steer in the opposite direction, and quickly back. Smoke starts to turn yellow from your exhaust. Steer away and back again, and the smoke will turn orange, release the shoulder button and you benefit from a 10 km/h speed burst. Once you've mastered the technique, the 150cc class becomes a breeze, well nearly! V DC 8/8 PETER IT'S THE NEW STYLE REVIEW All of the original power-ups from Super Mario Kart are in MK64, but being shortcuts and gaining a lead. Also maxed in quantity is the Banana, now a sequel, that list has gotten just a little bit bigger. New are triple also available as a bunch. There is another speed boost in the form of the weapons. Red and Green Koopa Shells are now available as bunches of Golden Mushroom, which you can use repeatedly for a limited time. Best three. These can be used to protect your kart like a shield, or hurled as of the lot is the Spiky Blue Shell. This will home in on the lead kart, even missiles. Also in three are Power Mushrooms, very handy for performing if fired from eighth place, taking out anything that gets in its way!

Fans of the original could be in for a tough time, with the amount of changes Nintendo have brought to the update. For starters, all the cups are selectable to play from the start. No more having to win gold cups to get to the Special Cup! Nearly gone are the dash zones, only a handful remain, and these are only positioned to perform huge jumps. Gone are Donkey Kong Junior and Koopa Troopa, they are replaced by the evil Wario and DK's dad. Gone are the '?' blocks in the road. Mario Kart 64 makes the blocks 3D. However these new blocks regenerate after being used. No more scrambling around for the last power-up. On the subject of power-ups, their benefits are now available to all. The computer opponents no longer have their trademark weapons. Instead they battle with the same power-ups. Boo them! TIME 020-65 IM SICK TO DEATH OF BANANAS. I WANTS PINEAPPLESI COMMENT AD 2nd O IT'S ALL BECOMING CLEAR NOW I've had no difficulty deciding whether Mario Kart 64 lives up to my expectations. It doesn't. Super Mario Kart is one of the all-time greats, but Nintendo have disregarded what made that work. The previously perfect go-kart handling has been replaced by a imprecise new method. The range of decent tracks is overshadowed by uninspired ones, and the graphics seem more sparse than impressive. These changes are reflected in the gameplay, now more power-up oriented than skill-based, leaving battle mode as the best multiplayer mode. Opinion in our office is divided though, and mine sits firmly on the 'nice game but+ wouldn't buy-it' side. TOM GUISE As reported in our April issue, hidden shortcuts are vital for shaving seconds off your lap times. Most require jumping in the right places, sometimes with a Power Mushroom. The best thing to do when scouting for shortcuts is to study the course maps in the instruction manual. Then ask yourself, \"why is there a crab out in the middle of nowhere on Koopa Troopa Beach?\" Because it's a shortcut, that's why! 3/3 TIME 04' 54\" 23 LAP 2/3 TIME 02'40\"53 Four player battles ahoy! You can't complain about that! DO 3E TIME O REVIEWER Ath We've finally found a shortcut in Rainbow Road, and it's a real leap of faith! At the start just before the huge drop in the track, steer left and quickly jump, almost exactly when the track starts dipping. If successful you should land on another section of track, cutting a third off the course! TINE 02'36\" 30 & LAP 3/3 TIME 03Â°1906 AP 3/3 TM 09Â°2806 8th If you're a fan of the original Mario Kart, you're going to find yourself either loving or loathing this sequel. Some may find themselves perched on a fence, between the two camps. If you've never played the original then forget all our criticisms, you'll no doubt love this game. For such a big release I expected more. Sure, everything you could have hoped for has been included. But the result is still far from perfect. What went wrong? The finished game is just lacking the things that make all Mario games really great. Personally I would have liked more battle stages. Two of the four on offer are virtually redundant, and the original's were excellent. More drivers a 96 meg cart should've been enough to keep Koopa Troopa in the game. As for power mushrooms, they might as well have been left out of the game, because they don't work against the computer. There are many more criticisms, too anal to list here. Yet having said all this, I still really like Mario Kart 64. As a single player game, it is both annoying and disappointing. But as a multiplayer game it's absolutely superb. Isn't that weird? Alex. 4WITALA 2nd On the Royal Raceway (previously Peach Circuit) when trying the jump across the lake, you don't actually have to hit the track on the other side, it's just too far! Instead aim for the inside of the mountain and hit the grass. You'll fall into the water and be placed onto the track near the start line! TIME OD'05\" 26 LAP 1/3 TIME 00 REVIEW n 1 st RATING It is possible to perform a series of jumps at the start of Wario Stadium, that will enable you to perform lap times of less than 10 seconds! Use the first bump on the straight and aim left, then jump back to the other side just before the start line. Big sequels can mean big disappointment. Not what we expected, but still retains enough of the original's charm. Multiplayer is where the real magic hides. @ 61 "


"computer video games OU. THE CVG ALL-INVITATION TEAM CHALLENGE MLAD. NINTENDO 64  Another good multiplayer game, means another excuse for a team challenge. Now if we can only find those missing joypads! PAUL TOM JAIME EDDIE ALEX STEVE PHIL THE MUSHROOM CUP OOO GROUP 1 RACE 1 LUIGI RACEWAY Long straights and easy corners make this the easiest circuit in the game, what a perfect place to start. The first battle is on the character select screen, everyone wants a lightweight driver. Ed wants to be Yoshi, but Alex doesn't budge, in the end there's only one choice for Ed to take. He has to be the Princess. Perfect. Phil is content with Toad and Steve settles for Wario. The race starts and straight away sunlight bursts through the windows. \"I can't see a lots of swearing) thing. It's (lots more swearing) me off\" shouts Phil. Steve bursts into the lead, and has Jaime who is watching the action from afar say \"Who's Wario\"? Ed is trundling around in last place, much to the amusement of others, and then starts repeating \"Daawwsuunn\" in a homage to the last challenge. Steve wins comfortably, with the battle for second close, and Ed a looong way behind! Steve 9 Phil 6 . Alex 3 Ed 1 Fourth place for Steve, but he does win! 41fic he strange cries of Â«MexicoÂ» that emanate from the games room, attract us like drones under some Pied Piper like spell. While one-player Mario Kart might not be the favourite office game, four player Versus Races and Battles are very popular. With dedicated players finding more shortcuts and tactics each time they play, the competition is definitely heating up. The Hive Brain may have taken leave from the subscriptions page, but it can still demand a champion when it wants to and we're not foolish enough to argue. So place your bets, summon the heroes and let the challenge commence. GROUP 1 RACE 2 MOO MOO FARM Uneven muddy roads lowers the top speed here, and just like the Donut Plains from Super Mario Kart, moles can block the way. Phil and Alex get rocket starts, Alex hits a mole and Ed catches up. \"I was thrashing everyone until they got power-ups\" cries Ed, quickly falling out of favour with the game. \"The balance of power keeps swaying\" says Alex boringly\" | know how fickle the power-ups can be\". \"Look at me leading\" claims Phil although he's actually in second place, as Ed finishes first to the sound of one hand clapping. Ed 9 Phil 6 Alex 3 Steve 1 GROUP 1 RACE 3 KOOPA TROOPA BEACH Named after the huge rock that can be seen at the starting line, there's lots of jumps and shortcuts. Plus crabs, sand and water it is a beach after all! Everyone trundles to a slow start. \"Mmm loads of power starts\" says Ed ironically. Steve takes a shortcut and starts calling the others \"Mutts\". Alex gives chase and proceeds to take the shortcut on each lap \"It's not cheating!\" Ed. who's in third. thanks the computer for giving Phil a lightning bolt. But like the Murphys, he's not bitter. Phil overtakes and manages to fire a shell behind as he passes Ed, adding insult to injury. Ed moans, Phil laughs. Meanwhile Alex has already finished. Having remained silent all the race, he's pulled off a commanding victory. He makes sure everyone realises he finished more than ten seconds before the others. Alex-9 Ed 6 Steve 3 Phil 1 THE KOOPA TROOPAS! Phil in deep water again. GROUP 1 RACE 4 KALIMARI DESERT * * * * REVIEW To keep the proceedings diplomatic, all the names were scribbled down, thrown in a hat and drawn. Group One saw Ed, Phil (we still love him), Steve and Alex thrown together. This was going to be a very close contest. Group Two and Jaime, Oz, Paul and Tom would be locked in combat. Though it was already easy to see who would emerge victorious from the group. Each group had four races, the top two of each group going into a Battle mode final. No runners-up play off, just nice and simple. A rather bland course with a Wild West theme. Complete with steam locomotive that crosses the track twice. Everybody gets a rocket start, with Phil edging out in front. Jaime then dives onto Ed's joypad to pause the game, so he can reset the grabber. Phil, put off by the pause, mutters \"I'm getting wound up by this (mild swearing, rhymes with hit)\". Oz walks past and asks \"Can I play now?\" \"NO!\" The game is unpaused and Ed moves into the lead. \"From first to fourth, it's a lottery\" sighs Alex, then adds \"Hey, I'm king of the sound bite.\" Wario gets a lightning bolt, Ed is squashed and squeals \"Now I'm last,\" Jaime interrupts and says \"It's only a game\" (but you should see his behaviour later). After much hysteria we're treated to a very close finish. Phil 9 Alex 6 Ed 3 Steve 1 Nice try, Ed Lamlok! FINAL SCORES FOR GROUP ONE: PHIL PHIL22 22 ALEX.. 21 STEVE. ED .. 19 DET ART 62 "

EEEEFFI I'VE BEEN SHOT UP THE ARSE 900 THE FLOWER CUP OOO computer Video games Video GROUP 2 RACE 1 TOADS TURNPIKE NINTENDO 64 Set around a busy road, complete with trucks and cars, drivers have to be careful not to hit the extra traffic. \"What's Toads Turnpike?\" asks Tom, \"oh no, not that one!\" Jaime shoots off to an early lead, with Paul a close second. \"I'm just so good at games\" boasts Jaime. Further back and Oz and Tom are battling for third place. \"I've been shot up the arse\" shouts Oz, \"Efff\"! \"It's too fast for this screen\" says Tom, in another homage to the last challenge. Jaime hits a truck, and Paul and Tom scoot past., only for Tom to hit a truck. Jaime bursts through the pack to regain first place at the post. \"Oh surprise surprise, I won\" he cruelly brags. Jaime 9 Paul 6 OZ 3 Tom 1 GROUP 2 RACE 2 FRAPPE SNOWLAND SAME POSITION N PHOTO. SAME EXPRESSION AS LAST CHALLENGE JAME YOU'RE THE BEST Slippery icy roads, with snowmen that can block your path. The course is completed with a giant ice sculpture of Mario. Oz and Tom have trouble adapting to the ice. They both wheel spin at the start of the race. Jaime gets an early lead \"I'll play the first lap blindfolded\" he says grinning. Paul is right behind him the whole race. Tom asks \"Where is Wario, I can hear his laugh?\" even though nobody is playing as Wario! Clearly Tom is in a confused state, both he and Oz have huge trouble staying on the track. Paul manages to sneak past Jaime on the last lap, and pips him at the finish. Oz and Tom are too busy laughing to pay serious attention, Tom falls off the bridge on the last lap, allowing Oz a third place victory. It's like watching two separate races in this group! Paul 9 Jaime 6 Oz 3 Tom 1 Tom and Oz (top) show how not to play! GROUP 2 RACE 3_CHOCO MOUNTAIN Falling rocks, and some bumpy ground can be a problem through the mountain. The first group of power-ups give Tom a lightning bolt. \"Which bellpepper did that\" shouts Oz. Jaime starts talking to himself \"Oh, you're brilliant Jaime!\" He has a large lead. Tom keeps falling off the cliff edge, and is then lapped by Jaime. \"It's brilliant \" says Paul \"It's rubbish\" replies Tom. Sunlight breaks through the window and Oz cries, \"there's sunlight in my eye\". Tom says that sounds like a song and starts singing \"There's sunlight in my eye, you might need somebody.\" Oz is then squashed by a boulder. \"Efff\"! Jaime racks up an easy win, Paul again a close second. Hours later and the third place battle heats up. With Tom and Oz wheel to wheel, Tom inches ahead to take the points. Jaime 9 Paul 6 Tom 3 Oz 1 2 Another Tom/Oz mess. GROUP 2 RACE 4 MARIO RACEWAY The game designers' favourite Time Trial course. Full of complex corners and hairpin curves. Jaime and Paul speed off, thinking about taking their favourite shortcuts. Jaime gets three mushrooms and moves further in front. \"Is this going to be another exciting third-fourth place finish?\" asks Tom. Oz is confused \"Is there a map?\" He's then lapped by Jaime. \"This is a disgrace to the name Luigi\" says Tom. \"It's brilliant\" says Paul. Then \"I don't believe it\" as he's hit by Tom's red shell. Jaime chalks up a comfortable victory. \"I'm disappointed finished second on one of the races\" he boasts once the game has finished. Oz is a gibbering wreck and is heard muttering \"awesome graphical capabilities\" over and over. Jaime 9 Paul 6 Tom 3 Oz 1 BioN 1 A civilised finalÃ©! FINAL SCORES FOR GROUP TWO JAIME...3 33 TOM. .. OO FINALS ODO DOUBLE DECK PAUL ATTLE 21 OZ............... BATTLE 8 TAM THE CHAMPION! The final is played in battle mode. Rather than a race it gives the players the chance to show off their tactical skills. Double Deck is a square-shaped arena, four levels high. Ramps join the levels. It's very similar to a multi-storey car park. Atthe character select screen certain tactics are changed, with Paul and Phil selecting heavier drivers. Phil chooses Donkey Kong and Paul Wario. Alex sticks with Yoshi and Jaime Toad. \"I'm gonna drive around until you all kill yourselves\" says Jaime at the start of the battle. Everybody zooms off in different directions, in order to find power-ups. First blood goes to Paul as he hits Jaime with a red shell. Phil shouts \"I need some stuff!\" He scours the levels for valuable weapons. Alex has trouble finding a power-up of choice. \"I keep getting fake blocks\" he says, then rounds the corner, and hits a fake block. Phil then manages to shoot himself when his green shell rebounds off a wall. He then starts a kamikaze run on Jaime, who protects himself with a circle of bananas. Phil crashes into Jaime, they both hit the bananas! Jaime loses his last balloon. \"Revenge\" shouts Jaime, who is transformed into a bomb car. Alex stumbles upon their path and is hit by Jaime. \"I can't believe you took me out.\" he snaps. Alex as a bomb car makes it his responsibility to destroy Phil. The end happens fast! Paul comes out of hiding, and confronts Phil, who charges .Paul fires off a red shell and scores a direct hit. Phil then realises he was attacking without any weapons, duh! That's it, Paul wins with all three balloons intact! So we eventually found our winner. The fact that he didn't lose a balloon is kinda infuriating. You ve got to remember, given more rounds, more battles. this result could have been completely different. Heck, even Tom might have made the final! Congratulations to Paul, he whipped us all good. Until the next Team Challenge, he gets to wear the crown. Phil really is a dark horse, who knows what might have happened if he hadn't been banned from the MMV3 challenge final. And Alex walks away with another third. If there'd BRD been a camera around, and PAUL had his alien friends been PHIL ALEX with him, he probably would have tried a lot harder. REVIEW S7 "

So why dontcha show us what ya got. Go for ya piece, gringo! CAFALTA t's claimed that this year the videogame industry will make even more money than Hollywood! Not so hard to believe when you look at its current status worldwide. With the likes of Final Fantasy VII, Quake and StarFox 64 blowing peoples minds, games are clearly more epic, action-packed and visually gobsmacking than mere movies. And the variety of tastes is just as broad, catering for fans of kung-fu, cop shoot-outs, sc-fi, horror, dinosaurs, fast cars and just plain old excitement! Of course, there's one movie genre that's been sorely neglected in games. And who better to sort it out than a company born from the creation of one of the greatest movies ever! LucasArts bring us Outlaws, their effort to make the Wild West the next frontier of gaming! glo REWARD! ROLLIN' ROLLIN' ROLLIN!! DINOPAN Before we even touch on how Outlaws plays, we thought you might like to get into the spirit of classic Wild West movies. LucasArts gear you up perfectly for this, with some stunning opening credits for the game. Finding out who the animator, musician etc are has never been so interesting, as the game starts with an excellent homage to the Sergio LeonÃ© spaghetti westerns. Backed by whip cracking music to match that of A Fist Full Of Dollars, or The Good The Bad and The Ugly, we're treated to classically-styled text that spins like wagon wheels or swings like saloon doors, as a silhouetted cowboy rides across the screen. It's such a perfect title sequence, that by the time it's finished you're totally up for being Clint Eastwood! Right between the eyes! Yeh, old Pistol-Jaw Jackson never misses with his six-shooter chin! .. DOOM COUNTY! .. For their Outlaws concept, LucasArts have taken Doom (or more specifically the Dark Forces engine) and added a Wild West theme to it. Not a bad idea at all when you consider Westerns are famed for shoot-out situations. Substitute dark fortresses for hick shanty towns, and monsters for moustachioued gringos and you've got yourself a gunfight, pardner! The weapons too, match the theme. Starting with your basic Colt .45 six-shooter, you can pick up a rifle, shotgun (doubled-barrelled also available), and eventually a gatling gun. Only used when stationary, but it cuts down them varmits like nothing else! You might not get the And great animation. full effect here, but imagine Here the titles swing open awesome banderos music. like a set of saloon doors! AH DONT GIVE A SPIT WHATCHA THINK! I AIN'T NEVER NO RELATION OF ANY ED MORKMUNCHI REVIEW CORNER NEON You can fire off quick reels of pistol shots, but you have to reload! im 0 KIDS The rifle can have a sniper scope fitted to it. Heheh, see you in hell, gringo! The double-barrel shotgun has a wide spread, but you need to reload every go! It's not all guns! You get knives and dynamite too! Light it up, blondie! 64 "


"computer video games 11 WAKEFIELD THE BIG COUNTRY! DRYGOODS ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WESTIE Rather than just giving you a dozen identical Wild West towns (population: 18), you get to face-off in locations that add atmosphere to the vengeful Marshall plot. Sure, you start off in the ghost town of Dry Gulch, but the story soon puts you on a train, out in the wilds and into a country mansion. All the levels are amazingly large, and like most games of this sort you need to find keys or activate switches to progress. As for how many baddies you face, that depends on the difficulty setting. You can choose from Good, Bad and Ugly! DEADWARPE ROM 66 All westerns start with a classic scene. Be it the daring rescue of a bandito from an imminent hanging, or a masked raid on a bank. Outlaws follows suit with another Wild West favourite. Ex-marshall James Anderson has settled down to simple farm life with his family. However, a corrupt railroad developer, seeking to build through their property, kills Anderson's wife and kidnaps his daughter while he's away. So, he must once more strap on his pistol as he seeks revenge. You get to see all this and other story sequences in the kind of brilliant cartoon pieces that LucasArts are famous for. DICTEE VISKESTIS PRIN Goddarn scum-suckers lurking in the Dry Gulch lawhouse. Out in the rocky badlands during the twilight hours. ERRES More bandits on the daily baggage train. Gun 'em down! THOSE DAYS ARE BEHIND ME, SON Straight to the action! After a lovely family scene, strangers ride into the homestead. To prove Anderson used to be a Marshall, there's an option to play some of his historical missions that earned him the reputation of top lawman in El Chelo County. These are much more gun-fight oriented levels than the exploratory missions of the main game, and much tougher on the reflexes! Starting in your Sheriff's Pick your quarry and office you select a Wanted Poster, bring 'em in, deputy. then enter that stakeout situation. As you progress, so you fill up your jail cells and get promoted. So are you gonna bring in Buckshot Bill? Bloody Mary? Dynamite Dick? Or for the biggest booty, that filthy Union deserter Sergeant Bloodeye Tim! REVIEWER Noo! The Marshall returns to find his wife slaughtered! There's some neat homages to George Lucas. Look what you find at the end of a tarantula-filled tunnel! \"You filthy critters. I'll search the ends the Earth!\" I love LeonÃ©'s spaghetti westerns, so I've been looking forward to this game a lot. After the cracking intro, and with the Ennio Morricone-style tunes still trumpeting away, I was expecting a treat. Certainly the first levels start off well, as you sneak between the likes of the Funeral Directors and Saloon, shooting varmits through windows, or bursting through doors. However, the novelty soon fades, as the game becomes a poor man's Exhumed. The locations are good (towns, trains, even an old mill), but why do you have to find hidden doors, activate switches, find vital objects? The pace and atmosphere is lost, as you wander around with the map continually on, seeing the same dead enemies for the twelfth time. And some of the puzzles are so genuinely frustrating! If LucasArts wanted variety, they should have put classic Western stuff in-burning hayrolls, escaping under a stampede of horses, being holed-in by the cavalry. And without satisfying that Western fix, it makes me wonder why you'd choose this game over the likes of Duke Nukem or Quake. TOM GUISE Digging out his old sixshooter from the cupboard! REVIEW RESERZI T ETISKEN These scenes really are full-on ducking behind scenery shoot-outs. GATHER A POSSE BATING RATING HUU Yeehah! Cue whipcracking and men bellowing as he rides off into the sunset! It's almost not worth mentioning that this game has the now-customary multiplayer mode. Of course, the appeal here is that you have classic Wild West showdowns against your friends. So who really can draw the fastest? Good spaghetti western style, but out-dated graphics and a surprising lack of LucasArts innovation, makes this just a reasonable first-person adventure. 65 "

") PINBALL WIZARD RHINO-STINE COWBOY! computer video games It's fair to say that jumping from platform to platform can get more than a little dull. So why not console yourself in the fact that you can change into four different animals, for a little bit of variation. The frog appears to give you the extra jumping power you need to complete Fungus Grotto. The Rhino is yours on Branky Wastes and the Kelver Turtle on Canopy Village. The fourth and final animal is the fire breathing dragon, and he can be found on Dragoon Skyfort. This guy is the most important as you cannot reach the upper sections of the stage, and subsequently complete the level. As well as giving you an extra life for every three hundred you collect, the bonuses during the level will also give you the chance to access the bonus stages. At the end of each LEVEL 1 COMPLETE one you're given a percentage rating TREASURE 99% depending on the amount of treasure you've collected.

If locating the treasure is your main aim, then finding the secret parts to all of the stages is vital to your progress. There are quite a few ways in which extra bonuses can be revealed. Finding the keys is the first, and most obvious one. If the benefits of collecting a key isn't instantly obvious, track back or move forward a few screens and you may find some new items. Another way is to kill a group of enemies and they often reveal hidden power ups. Keep a sly eye out for hovering baddies in the sky, because they can often be used as pathways to bounce across to an otherwise unreachable ledge. Pandemowlya The dinosaur wakes up and makes chase if you get too close to him. REVIEWER The camera angles shift to give you the best possible view. Boot up Pandemonium, ignore the flashy intro and you get to an awesome looking game. The graphics and level detail are very good, but once you actually begin playing, you feel as though the 3D bits become redundant. Because you don't actually have the freedom to walk where you like, it boils down to being just another left to right platformer. Having said that, I did find this quite fun to play. There are a lot of hidden extras and bonus levels to find, keeping the interest levels high. Plus there is a small incentive to go back and try to locate as much of the treasure as possible. Even though some of the sections can be tough to beat, with the password system you find yourself whizzing through and completing the levels in no time. STEVE PES PSRS REVIEW 0900 RATING RATING While is may look impressive, at the end of the day all you do is run from left to right. It is still quite entertaining to play though.

The commen tary is also beefed up, but why do all commentators have to say \"With authority\"? For real realism maybe SCEE could add the coach, benches and photographers at the baselines for Total '98! EK KN NBA  Spectacular scoring. Though no camera angle allows you to see the players faces! Icon passing makes your plays more accurate. No more moaning that you didn't want to pass to #11! REVIEWER CRASH THE BOARDS KIDDI BEK Icon passing has been added to the controls, which gives you more precise passing. Now you don't need to pass four times just to get the ball to the right player. Strategies are also improved, using the shoulder buttons, which can change your formation in game. Additionally, the choice of double teaming and crashing the boards can be set up during an interval. A very strange inclusion is Arcade Mode. Which basically means no rules, the court boundaries aren't even recognised! This can lead to some very strange dunks indeed. I find Total NBA '97 a step back from its  incarnation. Sure the graphics have been improved on what were already great. Though it's the gameplay that really needed the tweaking. New moves have been added, but it's the players that let the game down. When the action is in the D, things go very static, with few players making runs of any kind. The dunks are too repetitive, with not enough variation in style. The game does have an impressive amount of stats, plus awards at the end of a season, or playoff. Though no hype or build-up to the playoffs themselves! In The Zone 2 is still the basketball game for me. It might not look the best, but the presentation and playability make it the winner. ALEX HUTTALA REVIEW TAM DR LOVE 4NBA Like most sports games on the block, Total '97 includes a create player option. Essential for filling in the gaps, left by the few players who aren't contractually represented by the NBA. When creating a player, there are 17 different attributes that need to be considered. Ranging from dunking to defensive awareness, all are key factors. With a limited amount of life juice though, you can't just put every bar up to max. Only through trial and error will you be able to create the real Michael Jordan. RATING Retains the award of best-looking basketball game on the PlayStation, but not the best overall. Well polished, but even for basketball, repetitive. 68 "

CALLING THE LEGIONS OF DARKNESS A NEW HOME AWAITS YOUI Dungeon Keeper isn't primarily a wargame. As the programming team realised when they took it back into development in December '95, the focus lies in the creation of a working eco-system. A living environment where all manner of monster races live side-by-side. Keeping them well-fed, busy, happy and safe (from each other), THAT is the game. After all, what is a master without minions? So when you open the doors to your dungeon, let's see just some of the beasties that comes slithering in... N SPIDERS AND FLIES M WARLOCKS A A classic example of the fragile dungeon eco-system. Attracted to you dungeon early on, these creatures despise each other and will fight. As such you need to slap 'em apart and keep them in different lairs!

Very scary when an enemy casts their view over your dungeon, as you see the warping effect and hear the sound! Awesomely powerful creatures to lure into your labyrinth.

This is possible in single-player too, but is far more fun with real players, as each opponent can hear the screams. And you can prolong the suffering as long as you want! The programmers have mentioned working on an on line specific version now. We hope this means a Quakeworld format of servers, allowing other to players to enter as heroes.

Its appeal lies in its sheer flexibility. You feel like you can do anything, and that anything can happen! Creating the whole dungeon eco-system is a fascinating experience. While it might look complicated here, it really isn't. The creature, Al is so advanced, they do everything themselves when provided for. And watching each one doing its own thing, really makes you appreciate the game logic. Of course, this is a game about being 'The Master' and that's what it does perfectly. Slapping the beasties into action, dragging them about, punishing them. It's total ego-satisfaction. And actually going into the dungeon and roaming around, just rounds off the 100% convincing sensation that this is a living world you're watching. Some people have knocked the graphics, saying they're too blocky. But these are casual observers who don't realise the scale of it. Tons of creatures, each animating individually, in a full 3D light, sourced environment, with irregular cavernstyle walls. Wait until you see the glint of your spells on the water, the light-sensitive shadows, the glow of the lava on the walls.

Now take out zombies, lots of guns and virtually all the action. Say hello to Overblood. OVERBLOOD. hen this first arrived in the offices many moons ago, via an importer from Japan, it looked like a fairly promising game. The only trouble was, we couldn't read any of the text and as a result all the potential atmosphere was lost. Now we have the English text version in our grasps, we can finally pass judgment. You awake from a cryogenic sleep without any clue as to who you are. The base you are in is completely deserted and you are free to wander around at your leisure. You not only have to discover who you are, but also what caused the base to become such a ghost area. All very intriguing stuff, but when all there is to do is wander about solving fairly easy puzzles, is it really important? No, is the quick and honest answer to that. It's really cold in here! The body's bad with more? BIRD'S EYE VIEW PIPO DOWN A BIT PLEASE! OVER BLOOD If the Resident Evilstyle viewpoint with multiple cameras that change depending on where you walk isn't your thing, then there are a couple of other angles to choose from. The second bears a more than a small resemblance to the standard Broken Helix playing slant, with only the top half of the Raz in shot. The other is a first-person perspective, where you look through Raz's eyes at whatever is directly in front of you. The only accomplice you come across in the early stages of the game is Pipo. When you first find him, he is nothing more than a crumpled heap of metal. But by locating his artificial intelligence chip and replacing it inside the droid, he becomes active again and chooses to follow you around. Unsurprisingly, Pipo is more than just a tag-along, because you have the ability to switch between him and the main character. Not only is Pipo able to reach the smaller passages, but he can also interface with various computer terminals around the research facility. This in turn opens various doors and gives you vital pieces of equipment. (LASER KNIFE) FOUND REVIEWER TAKE LEAVE This Laser Knife lets you cut through metal should you feel the need to. EVERYBODY GET DOWNI The first things you notice when you play Overblood is how similar it is to the likes of Resident Evil and Broken Helix. Not a bad thing you might think, but at least in those you had action straight from the word go. In this, the closest you get to action in the first hour of play is a zombie falling out of a lift. Wow. Sure there are loads of puzzles to solve, but when you are constantly walking from room to room, with nothing to do, this becomes so boring to the point of being pointless. Another thing that shouts out laziness is the animation. Raz runs like he needs to have dump all the time. Why? I know that you do get to fight people later on in the game, but because it takes so long to get to them, I couldn't be bothered to try and find out. Yawn, time for bed methinks. STEVE HEY Controlling Raz (for that is the name of the human character in Overblood) is an easy affair. Those familiar with Resident Evil, which should be about everyone, will pick this up very easily. No matter which direction you're facing, up always makes you walk forward, and vice versa for down. Left and right simply moves you around on the spot. Holding circle makes Raz run or push objects, and X selects objects for use once you picked them up. Triangle causes you to crouch down which gives another plane of exploring to you, as you cannot search low places standing up. Additional to that, Pipo can only hunt through certain mechanical areas, whereas some keycards and passes can only be used by Raz. Make sure you experiment with both characters if you get stuck, by hitting R1 to switch between them. REVIEW Push this statue, crouch down and then search. This should give you the Anti Gravity chip you need to progress. | RATING RATING While the strategy element of this game is very well put together, that dramatic lack of action contributes to its downfall. It's just too boring. 74 "

But finally Sega are bringing it out over here, complete with the Dual ROM system to keep the conversion arcade-perfect.

Without the cartridge, there's no way that all of the graphical detail of the Neo-Geo original could be loaded at once, and means that the Saturn version is virtually identical without costing the ridiculous amount of money that the Neo-Geo version does.

Just as you are attacked by your opponent, block the move and instantly do a special attack to break out of your block and hit instantly! It takes practice but can be very useful once mastered. The King of Fighters games have a following which can only be described as \"intense\". In many of the top arcades there are gangs of fans who play the games non-stop and firmly believe that they are the best available anywhere. For those who've not already bought KOF 95 (and 96) on import from Japan, this is their dream game. The graphics aren't brilliant, with some rather poor animation and feeble backgrounds (exactly the same as the arcade version) and the sound isn't too great either. The music's good, but the speech and sound effects are just plain funny. But it's not the graphics of KOF which make it so popular it's the fact that there are so many characters to learn, each with loads of special moves, combos and varying styles to learn. Unlike the Street Fighter or even Mortal Kombat games, it's very difficult to get into KOF 95 straight away. In fact, chances are you'll hate it the first time you play but take some time to learn a few characters and you'll realise what's so good about it. When playing against someone else who knows what they're doing, it's excellent fun. Highly recommended to fighting game fans, but not worth the hassle for casual gamers.

It's time to dust off the Uzir there's a body count that needs rising. SPIDICATE & THE CORPORATE WARS he world in Syndicate Wars is not sane. Normal civilians have computer controlled chips embedded into their brains and these chips are in turn run by one organisation the Eurocorps Syndicate. For 95 years they have been ordering the humans, while constantly researching and upgrading these chips. A group of ten of the best scientists in the world were assigned to study the hardware, but even Eurocorps could not have imagined the progress they made. As a result of their work, nine of the ten professors turned insane and broke away from the Syndicate to form their own cult, the Church of New Epoch. The Church sent a virus into Eurocorp's main system, and chips malfunctioned at a frightening rate. The Epoch were gaining in strength. The Tenth member of the team, Ko-Paull Vissick escaped all clutches. He opposes not only the Church, but also the Syndicate and so began his own movement known as The Unguided. They too are willing to fight for total control. Cataclysm is approaching, and you're about to hit it head on... 41011 IVJICULIS THE CORPORATE WARS The most effective way to find the lightning gun is to kill one of the Church members carry. ing it and pick it up once they are dead. DOT TO DOT PSYCHOTROPIC INFLU-WHAT? The dark and dimly lit streets in Syndicate Wars often look all too similar as you stroll about taking out pedestrians at will. The map you have will help to counter this. Not only does it show all roads and buildings, but also anything that moves in the level. Each coloured dot represents a potential target, and also shows those who are innocent. Red dots are Eurocorps agents, the Church appear as white. Grey are simple citizens, yellow are those civilians you've persuaded, and the coppers are indicated in blue. The flashing red dots are your targets for that particular stage.

REVIEW THE CHURCH OF THE NEW EPOCH These guys aren't your common or garden priests. The scientists who broke away from C3 (Cybernetic Cognition Conference), or The Nine as they are known, started the Church of the New Epoch. They made the humans break free from the control of the chips and turn against the Syndicate. They want a free colony in which they are the rulers, and they intend to obtain it by destroying Eurocorp and the Earth, before starting a new community on the moon. God help anybody who happens to get in their way. 78 "


"SWEET TALKER I'M A SECRET LEMONADE DRINKER... computer video games SECRET LEMONADE THE EUROCORP SYNDICATE CRYOVAT Eurocorp's domination is under threat. The Church is causing problems and the bosses behind the Syndicate want them stopped. At no expense. Your aim is to simply regain control of Earth. They want this not only to restore their idea of peace, but also because they aren't making enough money when disturbances keep disrupting their plans. The only way to do this is to wipe out the Church completely. 294 Top PlayStation Even though killing people is the primary aim for you, sometimes a little more discrepancy is required. Which is where the art of communication and the advances in technology collide. The Persuadertron (Eurocorp) and the Indoctrinator (Church) are the two valuable items in question. By equipping these and walking up to certain not-so-hostile people walking around the level, the chips in their brains are recoded. They then follow you until the successful end of the mission or until someone else kills them. Sometimes enemy agents can be talked around like this into joining your team, but make sure they won't shoot at you first! HOVER CARS, SPACESHIPS AND AUTOMOBILES? Boco The persuader is activated and collars two people nearby. Why take the long hike around to the far-flung reaches of a level, when you have access to a whole host of cars and trucks to steal and get into.

THE CORPORATE WARS SPIDICATE 1 Now two extras tag along! REVIEWER MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND At the end of the day, money is the most important thing in Syndicate Wars. Without it, you cannot purchase new weapons, armour or other upgrades once your research team has studied them. So what's the easiest way to get money? There are two methods for this. The first is the easiest of the two. At the start of the game, buy Miniguns for all your troops, then sell the standard Uzis. You should get around two grand a time for these. Then as you kill various troops around the levels, simply pick up their Uzis and sell them at the end of the stage! The second requires a little more effort. You have to locate the banks that are on certain stages. Then you have to rob them! The banks are identified by flags outside them bearing a dollar symbol. Once you've located the building, blow it into the middle of next week. The only remains left intact are indestructible currency cases, that give you the money if you pick them up and take them back to HQ once the level is completed. Syndicate on the Megadrive was one of the games I truly played all the way through, wanting to find out everything, I could. Now Wars is here, I can com fortably say that my interest for the original has returned. The is something immensely satisfying about strolling, around a city, mowing down civilians for no apparent reason. Sick as it sounds, it's still funny to see them collapse in a heap. Add to that a multitude of new weapons, and the fact you can play as the Church and you have a deeply rewarding game. However, it won't appeal to all. Despite the programmers attempting to appeal to a wider audience by making it more of an 'arcade' game, there are some key elements from it's PC brother misse ing. For a start the research is done automatically, and there is no main map screen. Small details yes, but integral parts of Syndicate Wars. It takes a while to get used to the controls, but there is a deeply rewarding game here, and one that should be sampled. But you need a mouse to get the most from this. STEVE PES TER! REVIEW THE CHOICE OF TWO: RATING The beauty of Syndicate Wars is that you have the chance to experience the game as both sides of the story. Deciding who is good and evil is up to you but both clans want the same thing...victory. WAIT ILLI CUMB UP YOUR PLUGHOLEI Syndicate Wars mixes a lot of action with a splattering of strategy, to finish up with a very playable and involving game.

"computer video games SHOOT 'EM UP BY TAITO  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY SONY TEL 0171 447 1600 AUGUST RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS PlayStation PlayStation It is the year 2219. The Earth is threatened with imminent destruction. Are you great enough to save us?  e've yet to see a truly brilliant scrolling shoot 'em up for the PlayStation. Surely a crime by the software houses against the machines owners. All this is about to change though, with a spot-on arcade conversion of Taito's Raystorm. A game so great that Sony themselves are publishing it through Europe. It may have been a rare canopy in British arcades, but we predict it'll be very common in a lot of homes this summer. Look at the pictures, read the text, and if you're a fan of shoot 'em ups, start getting excited! RAYTIRM. TM FAYTIM NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS! The enemies of Raystorm are polygon-generated. Essential for creating the illusion of depth which plays an important part of the game. The Earth missions see you fighting a mix of land, sea and air-based foe. Ranging from tanks, submarines and some huge Gundam-style robots. When the battle moves into space the enemy fire power becomes a lot more impressive, with higher numbers of craft on screen. You'll need to keep your wits about you to succeed. 00014000 TO START 00333600 PUSH 2P OVOG RI COIN 3300 WANT SOME OF THIS? REVIEW The enemy hordes attack from different heights. While your R-Gray is armed with both missiles and bombs, you still need to lock-on to all your targets. The adjustment of your targeting system takes no more than a split-second. But because of this, the decision of who to target next becomes vital. An important tactic is to target craft that won't attack imme. diately. Learning the set patterns that the enemy attack soon sees you wiping out the opposition without too much fire being aimed at you. 80 "


"computer video games BUT WAT THERE S MORE... MOBLE FORTRESS. BAH, ONCE IVE SAVED ENOUGH. I'M GONNA BUY ME A HOTRODI In addition to the arcade game, Taito have also included an extra mode. The game remains relatively the same as the original. Maps are added which show the locations of the battles between the missions. When you get to the stages themselves, the challenge becomes harder. This is because there are extra enemies making an appearance on each level! PlayStation W ALG 1 Bosses have additional protection in the extra mode. Look the first level is set over Britain and France. 7720 STO START CARTH 3rd HEET lub BIG BOSS MAN The bosses of each level, are obviously the biggest characters of each stage. Each require different tactics. Sometimes it is better to shoot engines, or gun turrets on the boss, before you progress to batter the main craft. Other times there are bystanders to the fracas who join in the fight. Here it is difficult to go straight for the boss, as you've got to take out the little fellas first. Whatever you do, make sure you have some heavy-duty fire power, before encountering the big guys. PUSH WILAVE REVIEWER PUSHP IN THE END IT TUOK ONE MAN I haven't enjoyed a shoot 'em up like this for a long time. Raystorm is a very polished game, looking gorgeous and playing even better. Unlike some blasters it offers quite a challenge too completing the game with a single ship is nigh on impossible. The programmers have also been clever enough not to allow too many continues (often the bane of a decent shooter). In essence this is pure 2D style. While the graphics may be 3D, they trick you into a greater sense of depth. If you haven't got a shoot 'em up for the PlayStation yet, get this. It doesn't get any better. Great graphics, slick presentation and one heck of a playable game. ALEX 4WITALA The R-Gray is the craft chosen by the powers that be, to save the Earth from the menace. And you've got to pilot it. There are actually two different Gray craft to choose from. R-Gray 1 is aimed at the beginner. Capable of locking-on up to eight targets. The missiles the ship uses are laser bolts. With increased power the bolts fire to a wider range. Gray-2 is for the advanced player. Capable of locking-on to sixteen targets, the weapons are much more powerful than RG1. However they take a longer time to recharge. The missiles are fired as a single beam, and are faster than with its sister ship. REVIEW RATING RATING 9447 The best shoot 'em up on the PlayStation by far. If you want some simple pleasures and a tough challenge, check it out. @ "

Virtua Fighter 2. Tobal 2 however, is a massive improvement, adding far more than just two new characters. The excellent control system makes creating original combos relatively easy, and the physics of the fighters is just right so as to make the floating combos fair.

Running in the PlayStation's high-resolution mode at 60 frames per second, the fighters are smooth and incredibly detailed with no slowdown whatsoever. And we've not even mentioned the excellent Quest Mode and masses of secret playable fighters yet!

After the original came out on the SNES in 1992, complete with Super FX chip, Fox McCloud and company established themselves as household names. With a history like that, Nintendo have done the right thing by keeping all of the classic elements that made the original so good. In other words, they didn't do a Mario Kart. As well as the Arwing, the programmers have added the Landmaster tank and the Submarine to give the game some much needed variation. Your ships have also benefited from the upgrade by gaining two new moves, a 360Â° and a 180Â° flip. The levels are bright and varied and there are an absolute ton of secrets to find.

The twelve characters (eight immediately selectable, four hidden bosses) range from mutant gladiators to a cool dude with bladed chains, and each one made from a pre-rendered 3D model. The game itself is similar in many ways to Killer Instinct, with the standard sixbutton control and chain combos, as well as using a super! power bar for special attacks.

Bedlam 2 adds more enemies and improves on just about every other part of the first game, meaning that it'll be warmly received by those who enjoyed the first game. There are some pretty annoying things the supply of enemies goes on for ever, meaning that you're constantly blowing creatures away, and the RATT often moves at such a speed that it's difficult to control carefully.

"MAD MONSTER PARTY! computer Video games House Of The Dead plays with your nerves like no other arcade game! Every text-book horror film stunt is pulled. When you shoot at the zombies, bits splatter off them. You can even shoot a hole clean through their chests, or take off their faces, and they still keep coming for you! Others drop from the ceiling above, leap from sewer streams, or smash out of cryogenic pods. And if they're not going for you, they lumber, arms outstretched, at screaming scientists as you desperately blast at them. Plus, adding to their undead legion are mutated monkeys, frogs, bats and even bloated maggots that you disturb from their feasting... on the flesh of the dead! Clockwise from top damsel in distress Sophie, the spider boss, the CVG team and the mysterious G. GUN DAMNED! The coin-op uses the same gun as the Virtua Cop games. Surely a good sign for Saturn conversion. However, the nature of this game's shooting action is somewhat different. Although you still fire six bullets and reload offscreen, the shots are much more splattery. And rather than firing sparingly accurate shots, you find yourself pumping a full clip into a monster, reloading, and pumping yet more! You don't get any other types of weapon either, adding to the despera tion of some of the game's hairier situations! Finally, the coin-op has a built-in gore switch. Go to the arcades and you'll find some machines featuring red blood and meat, whereas others feature green fodder. We actually find the green more chilling, as it looks more like flesheating disease!

However, these aren't just token breaks in the routine as they were in Virtua Cop 2, they're integral parts of House Of Dead's gameplay. Actions you perform throughout the game dictate where you go, and knowing what they are allows you to choose your route. For example, near the start a zombie is about to throw a scientist off a bridge. Save the scientist and he points you to go through the mansion's front door. Otherwise you head through the somewhat nastier sewage tunnels! Other times, you have to look for trapdoors, strange bookshelves, even electronic switches.

The column on the right has buttons which light up only for a split-second, showing the exact timing of more powerful attacks which will normally cause your fighter to do an impressive sparkling move if you get the timing perfect!

A big new feature added since Tobal No. 1 is that every fighter now has a projectile attack. It's very easy to do just tap away and square, then tap and hold away again. All the time that the direction is held, your character powers up their fireball while their energy bar at the top of the screen decreases.

The L buttons are used to jump, while the R buttons block. The triangle button performs a high attack, the square button does a mid-level attack, and the cross button does a low attack.

The view then switches to one behind your character, as you wander around the corridors searching for enemies and eventually the way to the next floor.

OIPOOT TORIO SRITE SHOES VERSION M2 are Sega's R&D department fighting game experts â they're the team responsible for Virtua Fighter and Fighting Vipers. But AM3, creators of Sega Rally, surprised everyone last year by releasing an excellent 3D fighting game of their own in the arcades. Last Bronx is set in Tokyo, where the gang leaders of the city are fighting it out to decide who becomes the overall leader when they unite, thus avoiding any more gang conflicts. A strange storyline, but when has a plot ever been important to a fighting game? RO NAGI ISME THE CONTINUE? 1 TRITO FESTO AM3'S LAST BRONX CHEER! The fights in Last Bronx take place in a selection of urban arenas set up in some strange places. Each one has a small wall around the edge which confines the action and means that ring-out victories aren't possible. These small walls can be used when fighting, as the characters can jump onto them and off again to get a bit of extra height, or to surprise their opponent! CAST BRONX 0042 NAGI The arcade version of Last Bronx has eight playable fighters, as well as a final boss who can be accessed with a cheat code. Each character has their own weapon which suits their style of fighting the enormous Zaimoku has a massive mallet, little Tommy has a stick almost as big as himself, combat gear-wearing Yoko uses tonfas, Joe uses Nunchukas, street fighter Kurosawa uses a plank of wood, Nagi fights with twin sais, cheerleader Lisa has two extendible metal poles, and Yusaku uses a large three-part metal weapon. An excellent cheat in the arcade version changes everyone's weapons into wacky household objects (Zaimoku's mallet becomes a giant fish, for example) and it'll no doubt be included in the final Saturn version.
