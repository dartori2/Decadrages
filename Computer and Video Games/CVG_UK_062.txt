"THE REVIEWS GREAT ESCAPE A flag pole indicates the escapee's morale. The higher the flag, the better he is. The colour of the flag changes depending on whether the POW is in a particular restricted area. If it's red, watch out. If the guards or commandant catch you, it's 24 hours of solitary confinement. Objects found are displayed at the bottom often screen together with a medal score table, and alarm bell. One of the easiest ways to move round the camp is to find a German uniform. If you wear this the guards will not challenge you. Only the commandant will see through the disguise. Thanks to a secret map supplied by Ocean I've managed to track down a few vital items. But I'm still trapped. It could be that I'll only escape with outside help. Any offers? The Great Escape a camp caper for tough guys. Hardship, degredation, cruetly. We've just got to get out of this place. The year is 1942, the setting a Prisoner of War camp in the grounds of a castle in Germany. Colditz in everything but name. The aim is to escape.

To look at Uchi Mata is like many other martial arts games. However, it's the most difficult I've ever played. But it does appear to be very realistic. There's no huge leaps into the air or seemingly impossible kicks. It's also one of the most tiring games I've played. My hands ached with frantic, and sometimes panic-stricken joystick movements. If you want realism, try Uchi Mata. I got a little fed up with being the perpetual fall guy. What can you say about a judo game with a name which sounds like a violent sneeze? It's frustratingly hard to get to grips with, that's what. There was no way I could become a 10th Dan at Uchi Mata. I was more like a Desperate Dan as I wrestled manically with the joystick to master a Tomoe-Nage (sacrifical stomach throw, to you lot), followed by a rather neat De Ashi Barai (an advancing ankle sweep).

You must get five camels through to continue to the next level Now then, there are really two levels in this one. First you fight with the Sultan's bodyguards who are aided by giant birds, called Rocs. Rocs are tough and take three shots to kill, whereas Guards are a sinch. The Sultan, worried that one man has defeated his entire army, uses all his magic to transform himself into a fire-breathing dragon. To destroy this, one must shoot it 15 times!! Should you do this, a  GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY Remember Sinbad, star of book, stage and screen? Of course you do. Well now the monster-slaying hero is taking on the wonderful world of computers. In his latest adventure, Sinbad is kidnapped and thrown in the dungeon of Sultan Salabim's fortress. All his treasures are stolen and hidden around the castle. Sinbad, as you can imagine, is a little confused and angry. After all, who likes being tied up and thrown in a dungeon? Anyway, Sinbad has broken free of his bonds and is now searching for away out of the dungeon. To escape he must find two keys and open the doors at the end of the maze. This is not an easy task. I lost many a man on this stage, so don't expect to do it first time. The dungeon is also the home of some nasty creatures which most be avoided at all costs, as they will deck you without a second thought. When you get out of the first level, you have to fight the Sultan's guards. They are a blood thirsty lot who are only too keen to cut you into small pieces. The leader of the guards is stronger than the rest. It takes four hits to kill him, while others only need one. Sinbad can also take four hits. But help is on hand in the form of magic lamps, which give bonus points and restore his strength.

CRYSTAL CASTLES Under the auspices of US Gold, Crystal Castles has finally emerged into the light of day on the Beeb and Commodore 64 micros. And about time, too. I haven't played such a satisfying game of grab-the-loot-and-run for a long time. Crystal Castles has been described as 3D Pacman, and that just about sums it up. You play a character, apparently called Bentley, whose main aim in life is to get rich fast. And since Bentley lives in a world of weird and wonderful castles whose corridors are strewn with gems, he has every chance of doing so. All he has to do is scamper round the castle's walkways, leap on to moving platforms, run in and out of doorways and so on to gather all the available goodies. But, inevitably, there's a snag, and that snag takes various forms. Hostile bouncing blue balls, for instance, or mobile man-eating trees, not to mention the dreaded worms. And if Bentley takes too long clearing a screen, a savage bush I think it's a bush appears on the screen to add to his problems. Considering the sheer speed of this game the graphics aren't bad at all, and the sound, for Each screen has a title but on all the screens you have to collect the gems scattered around the pathways of the various Crystal Castles. Like the BBC game, the nasties take the shape of blue balls, trees, swarms of bees and green worm thingies. There's another nice touch in this version are the secret warps which transport you in between levels. When you reach certain screens a message appears telling you where the warps are. For example, when you reach level seven you get a message which reads: \"Jump at left back corner of first screen\". If you do this you get 140,000 bonus points and get transported to level three. The graphics aren't badjust a bit fiddly for my tastes, just like the Atari original in fact. U.S. Gold say they are releasing this game as a \"limited edition\". We're not quite sure quite what this means. It couldn't be a marketing ploy, could it? Anyway, if you were a fan of the coin-op then this game is for you. Crystal Castles is a faithful copy of the arcade original. Completely playable and totally addictive. 09 BBC & GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY "

Bombscare is one of the best I've seen for a long time. It's a race against time on the planet Neptune where an enemy has planted a big bomb in the space station. Only Arnold, the cute bomb disposal droid, can stop the base being destroyed. You're in control of Arnold and must guide him through the many detailed 3D rooms in search of the correct tools to help defuse the bomb. Each room is inhabited by energy draining creatures left behind by the enemy. Arnold can avoid or zap them -but his supply of ammo is limited. Objects he discovers can come in useful. He can find things that give him extra lives, transport him from place to place, act as SMART bombsblasting all the creatures in a room-or protect him from harm. Things that look like shields are protection devices, bomb shaped objects blast the creatures, an odd pyramid thingy acts as a transport back to the \"bomb\" room, while a square shaped doodah with a wiggly line across it will transport Arnold to the exit when activated. Many other objects can be found, but I've yet to work out their functions. Arnold can carry up to five objects which are selected and activated via the keyboard Joystick controls are used to move the droid around and fire at things. A small window on the right hand side of the screen displays the object currently in use. You really have to work out what does which simply by activating the object you've picked up and watching what happens on screen or on your status readouts. Some objects help keep Arnold going by replacing lost energy and zapping power. There are teleports dotted around the space station which you access by running into them. A small window opens in the middle of the screen requesting a password as in Starquake. If you don't know the password you're stuck! And quite where you find them I'm not sure yet. You'll need to hang onto the objects which get you back to the \"bomb\" room and the exit in order to make a quick getaway. Even if you don't succeed in defusing the bomb you can get Arnold out of the space station before the big bang by making a dash for the exit. This gives you a 1,000 point bonus but not a lot of satisfaction! If you don't kill the bomb you see a nice end-game sequence in which the plant is blown into a billion bits! It's amazing to think that a couple of years ago a game like this would have cost around , would probably have come from Ultimate and have been described as a major leap forward in games technology. Here we have a game that costs just a quarter of the price, has great graphics, good sound, is immensely playable and only costs .99.

What has he done? Only converted the classic space zapper Uridium on to the Spectrum that's all. Andrew Braybrook's original on the 64 has spawned a billion imitators on many different machines. But there's nothing quite like original and this Spectrum version is destined to become an instant classic The basic idea remains the same-you zip among the mobile defence forces of an alien fleet of ship extremely quickly.

"REVIEWS as if they wanted to show how big the game really is... Both Spectrum and Amstrad versions have good looking and stylish graphics. The Amstrad must be one of the best looking games around for this machine. Great use of colour and very pleasing screen design. The alien beings you encounter like the Maggie head are jokey creatures, well animated The only thing missing from both versions is sound. No tunes and minimal round effects. But this is a minor grip. Overall N.E.X.O.R. is a polished and playable game. Ironic isn't it when everyone was playing Knight Lore clones Design Design were turning out unfashionable super-fast shoot'em ups like Dark Star. Now that everyone is plahing super-fast shoot-'em-up, Design Design has produced a 3D Filmation game. Funny old world...

Queues formed at the Commodore as everybody demanded first go just as when the original Fist punched its way into our hearts. But then there was silence when we started playing. The crowd grew uneasy and the boos began. This wasn't what we were expecting. The Way of the Exploding Fist grabbed you by the throat and made you play. There was no way you could walk away without having just one more go.Fist Il just isn't that accessible. Many people gave up quite quickly. But, having said that, they all returned to give it another go and usually ended up involved in a prolonged playing stint. The Way of the Exploding Fist was more or less a straightforward punch up game. Points for pleasure. This time you have a mission. The fighter must search out and destroy an evil warlord who lurks in a volcano fortress. But before this he must find a number of mystical scrolls, known as Trigrams, and return them to their temple. These scrolls there are eight of themwill give the fighter extra powers with which to face the deadly showdown. The play ranges against a variety of backdropsswamps, mountains, underground caves, forests and temples. There are various enemies to take on and punch and kick into oblivion peasant soldiers, warrior guards, ninjas, shoguns, assassins and mud warriors-plus snakes, dogs when you've scored so many points. Land on the master runway and you'll get a further bonus for destroying the dreadnought totally. Graphics capture all the feel of the 64 original solid and metallic looking.

Now it's out on the Spectrum and is CULT just as good. If you want to brush up your Gauntlet skills before the real thing turns up in time for Christmas then this is the game for you. It's a one or two player arcade adventure in which Storm the Warrior and Agravain Undead the magician go on a rescue mission. The evil Una Cum has captured Storm's missus and as there's no one at home to wash his barbarian furs our hero wants her back.

Although player two obviously has to use the keys and you have to wait for your mate to catch up before moving onto the next room. The program is extremely well presented-with a useful set of on screen instructions which set the scene for the game and tell you what's what in the game. This was missing from the Amstrad version. The graphics are chunky but acceptable. The whole game has a nice feel to it. It's also horribly addictive and very playable. If you can't wait for Gauntlet to appear-and who can? it's well worth shelling out a couple of quid to get in a bit of monster molesting with Storm and Agravain.

"S MACHINE: SPECTRUM  SUPPLIER: FIREBIRD PRICE: .99 REVIEWER: TIM OLLI & LISA after has been collected. Humph will tell you what to find to put in the cauldron on screen one in his little speech bubble. If Olli manages to collect an ingredient he gets a big kiss from Lisa shown in a nicely animated interlude screen. There's a time limit for each task and if you eventually run out of time and lives another neat animated screen comes up which shows Sir Humphrey's ghostly form approaching Olli and battering him with a broom! Ollie has to explore the entire castle inside and out for the things he has to get---but he must always bring them back to the cauldron room where Lisa is stirring the brew. Game play is basic platforms and ladders jumping over nasties but the nice graphics Hoots Mon! There's a ghost loose about this hoose! Could this be the world's first Scottish game? Who knows--but it's certainly a budget game that thinks it's full-price. Olli & Lisa set out to help Sir Humphrey, resident ghost in the Shilmore Castle somewhere in the Highlands. This ancient pile is threatened with being shipped stone by stone to the US of A by mega millionaire Eugene Portcullis. Sir Humph isn't too keen on the idea and enlists Olli and Lisa's help in getting together the ingredients which will make him invisible and therefore more scary. Those Americans have seen so many monster movies with amazingly horrible special effects that they wouldn't be scared by an ordinary old ghost like Humph or so he reckons. So he sets old Olli the task of collecting the ingredients for his invisibility brew which are hidden around the castle and protected by the other little gremlins and nasties which inhabit the old pile. Lisa gets to stay by the cauldron and stir the mixture. There are eight ingredients to collect-and you can only move onto a new screen once the particular ingredient you're and humorous little touches make this a really terrific game to play. Olli and Lisa and old Sir Humphrey are such nice characters I reckon we could be seeing a few sequels to this brilliant budget game. If not why not?! Olli & Lisa is an entertaining and very attractive game. Great value for money and instantly playable. One of the best budget games for ages.

"C+VG MADUENTURE NEWS ADVENTURE MAIL Bury. Once again we had a busy week on the Adventure Helpline stand at the PCW Show. Joining me were Paul Coppins, Adrian Bott and Daniel Gilbert, and it was nice to meet so many readers, many of whose names were familiar through the Helpline mail. Of course, there was no escaping the annual visit of The Fiend. His latest missive, arriving too late for last issue, describes how he moved within shot as I was about to take a photo of the stand, just so as to get in the picture! But I changed position to get a clear view. He claims to have been within three feet of Daniel, Adrian, and myself, looking a picture of pure innocence, as I opened the traditional gift. Daniel and Adrian were open-mouthed as they read the legend on the package they had thought The Fiend was a figment of my imagination, dreamed up to enliven the column. Oh that he were! What terror he inflicts on us in the Penthouse. We live under the perpetual threat of demonic deeds, by an anonymous tormentor. Is there no adventurer in Faringdon, who can unmask this Fiend, and reveal his true identity? If you live in the area, watch your Spectrum-owning neighbours closely.

"For more to go REVIEWS/2 THE PAWN Supplier: Rainbird/Magnetic Scrolls Machine: Commodore 64 Price: .95 (disk) It's rarely that we run a second review of any adventure, but the Pawn has made such an impact, that it's worth having a closer look at it in its C64 format, newly released. Considering Pawn started off life in text on the QL, then progressed with graphics to the Atari ST and Amiga, it is amazing how closely to the 16-bit versions this first 8-bit Pawn compares. The graphics perform in the same 'roller blind fashion. On entry to a new location, the picture automatically slides down from the top, covering up the screenful of text already there. Move elsewhere, and up it goes, revealing the text. Manual control of the picture, with no mouse available, is achieved through the Commodore's function keys, each depression of which moves it up or down by two lines of text. The graphics are as near a copy of the originals as it is possible to get on the Commodore, and certainly better than anything I've seen in a C64 adventure before. But they do lack some of the fine detail and range of colour, present on the Amiga and Atari versions. There is an optional cameo, a miniaturised version of the main picture, which slides in diagonally from the top right hand corner of the screen. This feature, too, is controlled by a function key, and the cameo is displayed on second and subsequent visits to a given location. This gives a much quicker response, and a quick glance serves to illustrate the player's whereabouts without the necessity of having to wade through a lot of text. An unusual feature of the package is that not only is it copyable, but the purchaser is where you find yourself wearing a strongly recommended to make a wristband that you cannot remove. backup copy at the outset there's To get it off, and thus complete the even a copy utility included on one game. involves you in a series of of the disks, that will do the job. highly interlocked puzzles, laced The Atari ST version is the only with mischievous sense of humour. one to have copy protection, and At the start, the problems are because of this, it is a slightly reasonably gentle, but the going different game.

There is no alternative but for you to make for the plant, and carry out the repairs yourself.

The building is deserted, and you head for the lift to make your getaway. But the power has failed, the lift is useless, and to make matters worse, there is a fire raging in the stairway. What you do next, and how successful you are, depends very much on whether you hit upon the correct phrases.

This is the division's first adventure game, and the designers have gone all out. You play either a male or female character, and all the screen figures are richly detailed and resemble their film counterparts. David Bowie, who plays the Goblin King, is there in all his fiendish graphic glory. A joystick controls your character in the graphic window occupying the upper part of the screen. There is no text line for you to type on though. Instead there are two wheels at the bottom of the screen which can be rotated to form actions and commands that effect changes in the game. \"We got tired of traditional parsers MO and Rust honour of film maker George Lucas, but by him. Not to be a movie set, or testing ground for special effects but to provide a haven for creativity and creation. A think tank where Lucasfilm personnel can meet, meditate and design the latest and the greatest which the public has come to expect. One of the projects to emanate from within these walls is the movie Labyrinth. It differs from previous Lucasfilm ventures in that it is a collaboration with Jim Henson. Henson, the mastermind behind Kermit the Frog, is also no stranger to around to bother her anymore. Much to her horror and amazement, Jareth, the Goblin King, appears to honour this wish! Sarah is now forced to enter a strange and mysterious world in order to rescue her brother. The film works without violence though there is plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat. It's only natural that Lucasfilm's game division would jump at the chance to turn this into a game. The designers decided that there should be a maze. A challenging adventure that takes its root from the film, but doesn't "


"lyrinth which can be psyched out,\" notes Fox. \"The player spends too much time figuring out all the combinations the computer can respond to, and so in effect gets bored by learning too much.\" Fox jokingly refers to the wheels as his «slot-machine\" parser. What is important,\" he adds, \"is that different combinations become available depending upon where the player is. There's still freedom of choice, but we've eliminated the dead end or 'insoluble situation.\" Labyrinth operates in real time, but fortunately there is a pause feature pretty necessary as few will have the endurance to handle the 13-14 hours needed in one session. Another difference from the traditional adventure game is that maps become useless, as this unknown world is fantasy and so operates outside of the laws of physics. While there are arcade elements to deal with this is one time when strategy really counts. Other innovations exist as well. The landscape scrolls in two directions, both vertically as well as horizontally. A three-quarters perspective also enhances viewing. As has become sort of expected from Lucasfilm games, characters are large and possess a fluid cartoon-like animation. There is also perspective changes of the characters as they move towards and away from foreground objects. \"In the Eidolon,\" explains Fox, \"we created some interesting shapes that moved around really fast. But their size. The animation was done on a special stayed constant. Here, it's like real life software system developed by Kellner, where a figure diminishes in size as it and it went through various moves further away. incarnations; from ACE to LACE to \"Charles Kellner worked out the code GRACE (Graphic Animation Cell that enables the figures to change size Editor), depending upon their position on The program allows images to be screen.

In a move that would no doubt endear them to Henson, puppets were viewed and analysed in order to improve the character's appearance. Ken Macline (a noted fantasy artist who did the Eidolon cover) also worked on the images. Meanwhile the backgrounds were being created by Matt St. Louis, who had designed and executed the Koronis Rift Cytech robot. As might be expected, this is a large game which requires both sides of the disk in order to execute. Fox admits that a lot of what happens in the game comes from special personalities who helped to mould the fantasy world. Who are the mysterious people? Stay tuned to find out! "

"throh nickel computing time and so make everything move quicker and more efficiently.\" Kellner is quick to point out the other members of the team who made significant contributions. \"Kevin Furry developed a sprite matrix technique for use on the Commodore 64. Now there can be many times the number of sprites than normally allowed, and this means there can be more characters in a given scene. The sprites can also be much larger, up to one-quarter of the screen size. \"Kevin may be one of the youngest members of the team,\" notes Kellner, \"but his expertise is an invaluable addition to the team.\" They didn't call it quits there though. Scrolling is another area that needs an intelligent approach if it's to simulate a filmic experience. Not only does the scrolling in Labyrinth occur in both directions (horizontal vertical), but there's a micro programmed cameraman who watches the characters to decide when to scroll most effectively, As in a film, there is a bit of a lead before the character and compensation when more than one characteris walking. Additionally, this doesn't just happen every time the character reaches some point on screen. The micro-cameraman monitors the action and scrolls when it is both consistent and logical. Technology without content won't wash though. A game needs more than gee-whiz graphics to work. It has to be entertaining and compelling. Aiding that process was Douglas Adams, creator of the Hitch Hiker's Guide books. \"I remember my first meeting with Douglas very well,\" says Kellner. \"It was at his flat in Islington. We were talking for awhile, and then he reached over and handed me a towel. Well, what else could I do but give him the shirt off my back?\" Adams has been asked to help form puzzles to use in the game, as well as influence the overall mood. \"Working with him was certainly an unusual experience,\" notes Kellner. \"I mean, this guy has incredible ideas. One of the great things is that he won't take no for an answer and so neither did we, at least as much as was possible within the reality of computers.\" It takes a small crowbar to pry examples of Adams' humour in the game out of Kellner. Consider this one. The packaging and product information for Labyrinth is to be spectacular-with huge letters and banners declaring how amazing the graphics are and what an experience you are about to undertake. Boot up the disk and watch in unbearable anticipation as a title screen comes up, followed by a text line asking you to type in your name. T hat's about as graphically exciting as an old shoe you expect any moment to see an advert for clue sheets from Infocom! Of course, the game starts a few moments later. Now you're walking around a town, meandering aimlessly until you notice a movie house marquis. Yep, that's right it's showing Labyrinth. So you buy a ticket, go inside, get a large popcorn and find a seat to watch the film. Moments later, you are compelled to enter THROUGH the silver screen and into the adventure. \"Some of Douglas' ideas just couldn't bedone,\" laments Kellner. \"A great one is that you run across an editing room, filled with a viewer and bins of film. You look through them to find scenes from your past adventures in the game that you can re-edit. That would have been a lot of fun. Kellner feels that one of Adams strongest contributions is the \"Ah-ha, now I get it\" principle. The puzzles and conundrums that must be solved aren't always obvious. You have to expect the unexpected, which keeps the game fresh and interesting. Kellner has definite ideas about the future. \"We're still devoted to our original goal, creating interactive movies,\" he says. \"This means that we need better machines that can create more complex images with denser resolution. And we certainly want to add sound. In a very real way, we stand at the same threshold of cartoon technology as Disney did in the early 1930's, just before sound entered the picture.\" Kellner agrees that the new 68000 machines, like the Amiga and Atari ST, are very good. \"But,\" he notes, \"we still need more. New designs, new features that can give us the visual impact of a laserdisk, with the mammoth storage capacity of compact disks and the interactivity of a microcomputer.\" So then, what does the future hold at the Lucasfilm Games Division2\"Just about anything.\" quips Kellner. He might not be telling, but we know how to expect amazing graphics, bizarre worlds, and situations peopled by complex characters that are very much alive. Author's bio: Marshal M.

"KARATE LISTING Karate BBC B by James Samways Big kicks are in store for you if you program Karate by reader James Samways, of Cheshire It's Oriental thrash and bash action in best Way of the Exploding Fist style. The idea is to progress through different colour belts until you reach the exalted black belt status. Both fighters can jump, kick, and somersault. It's a two-player game so make sure you don't start a real fight with your opponent. Both characters have been nicely programmed by James, and the game play is addictive. It's even got a merry oriental tune as well. Full instructions are included in the game. 6OMODES 70belt 1%=1:belt 2%=i:ki 1%=0:ki 2%-O: PROCreverse: PROCinit: PROCSC reen: PROCnextbelt (0) BOSOUND 1,2,1,6 8SIF 2%<>1234567 PROCinst 9OPROCstart 100IFINKEY (-82) AND E%= THEN PROCkicki 110IFINKEY (-73) AND R%=0 THEN PROCkick2 120IFINKEY (66) AND E%-OTHEN PROChikicki 130IFINKEY (-89) AND R%=0 THEN PROChikick2 140IFINKEY (-67) AND E% 0 THEN PROCsweep 1 150IFINKEY (-105) AND R%=0 THEN PROCsweep 2 160IFINKEY (-2) AND EX=0 THEN P ROCsom 1 170IFINKEY (-74) AND R%=OTHEN PROCsom2 1801FiNKEY-54) THEN FX210,0 190IFINKEY{-17) THEN #FX210,1 200IFINKEY-68) THEN PROCfreez 240IFE%=2 THEN PROChikicki 250IFR\"=2 THEN PROChikick2 260IFE%=3 THEN PROCsweep 1 270IFR%=3 THEN PROCsweep2 280IFE%=4 THEN PROCsom1 290 IFR%=4 THEN PROCsom2 300GOTO100 31ODEFPROCCaller:A%=224.CALL! 00: ENDPROC 320DEFPROCdelay (de1%):FORty=1 TOde1%: NEXTty%: ENDPROC 330DEFPROCkicki:B%=1:E%=1: COLO UR3: ON 1% GOTO 340,370,390 340PROCkickcharsi:PRINTTAB (X%, 20); blank: IFX%+2=N% THEN GOTO 3 70 350X%=X%+1 360PRINTTAB (X%, 20); man$:1%=2: E NDPROC 370PROCkickchars2:PRINTTAB (X%, 20); man$: 1%=3: IFX%+2=N% THEN PRO Ccheck 380ENDPROC 390PROCkickchars1:PRINTTAB (X%, 20); man$: PROCstance:PRINTTAB (X%, 20); man$: 1%=1:B%=0: E%=0: ENDPROC 400DEFPROCkick 2:C%=1:R%=1: COLO UR1 :ONJ% GOTO 410,440,460 41 OPROCkickchars1: PROCcaller:P RINTTAB (N%, 20);blank$: IFN%-2X% THEN GOTO 430 420N%=N%-1 43OPRINTTAB (N%, 20); man24: J%2: ENDPROC 44OPROCkickchars2: PROCcaller :P RINTTAB (N%, 20); man 2$: J%=3: IFN%-2 =X% THEN PROCcheck 450ENDPROC 460PROCkickcharsi: PROCcaller:P RINTTAB (N7, 20); man2$: PROCstance: PROCcaller:PRINTTAB (N%, 20); man2$ : J%=1:C%=O: R%=O: ENDPROC 470DEFPROChikicki:B%=2: E%=2: CO LOURS: ONIX GOTO 480,490,510 4BOPROChikickcharsi: PRINTTAB (X %, 20);blank$: PRINTTAB (X%,19); man $:1%2: ENDPROC 490PROChikickchars2: PRINTTAB (X %, 19); man$:I%=3: IFX%+2=N% THEN P ROCcheck 500ENDPROC 510PROChikickchars1: PRINTTAB (X %, 19);blank$: PRINTTAB (X%, 20); man $: PROCstance:PRINTTAB (X%, 20); man $:B%+0:E%=0: 1%-1: ENDPROC 520DEFPROChikick2:C%=2: R%=2: CO 210IFINKEY (-38) THEN PROCinst 220IFE%=1 THEN PROCkicki 230IFR%=1 THEN PROCkick2 continued "

"_+. This is tomorrow calling ... the shape games to come. Are you out of touch with what's new in fun software? It's obvious you need to read Street Seen, C+VG's games preview pages. Every month we will be bringing you the cream of the crop of new games which will be heading your way in the weeks to come. And you can be sure we will be streets ahead of our rivals. Remember, the future starts here! Here it is. Space Harrier from Elite! They said it couldn't be done — but I'm afraid all the doom and gloom merchants will have to eat their words. Both Spectrum and C64 are very fast, very playable and a treat for the fans of the arcade version. The Spectrum version is just about finished. The Amstrad version is will on the way and so is the 64 game. It won't disappoint those of you who have been waiting with bated breath for Elite's biggest arcade conversion to date. Watch out for our Space Harrier special next issue. In the meantime marvel at the screen shots supplied by Elite boss Steve Wilcox. The Spectrum screen is as you'll see it in the final version. The 64, complete with solid 3D graphics, needs a few more tweaks before it is ready. But even in the semicomplete form we saw here at C+VG Commodore Harrier looks impressive. Will it tip the scales in Elite's favour as the battle for the Christmas charts starts in earnest during the coming weeks? Only time will tell. THE PALE BONES OF PREUTOUS TRAVELLERS Se ORBS:12 SCHO000003 Z: 2500 SELECT This here's Timeslip, just one of the titles on English Software's Atari Smash Hits Vol. 6, the latest in the ever growing line of value for money compilations from the Atari specialists. Timeslip is an improved and enhanced version of a title that first saw the light of day on the C16. Other titles on the com pilation are Elecktraglide, Drelbs and Fort Apocalypse Atari Smash Hits 6 is out now and will cost .95 on tape or .95 on disk. SCHOOL And now here's a Storm warning. The game that has been wowing Amstrad and Spectrum owners will be heading for the 64 very shortly thanks to Mastertronic. It's a sort of poor barbarians Gauntlet for two players. Nice graphics, addictive gameplay and a great cheap way to tune up your sword arm before the real thing appears. OFROZEN Boy \"Your the disease, I'm the cure.\" Yes it's time for Stallone to tangle with Ocean again this time in the shape of Cobra. The fact that the film was universally panned by the critics has not stopped Ocean from turning it into a game. The film isn't exactly strong on plot. It's just a series of fights, chases and killings lots of killings. The game, which will apparently follow the film plot, will be a shoot 'em up platform game. Cobra, the toughest of tough cops, must protect a murder witness from the baddies who are out to make sure she becomes a corpse. In the film Cobra uses pistols, gre. nades and a particularly mean laser gun. All these will feature in the game. Cobra should be out in time for Christmas on the Spectrum (.95), Commodore and Amstrad (.95). Meanwhile Ocean's other games based on film titles are Top Gun, which will combine arcade action with elements of a flight simulator, Highlander and Short Circuit, a sci-fi film which should be screened sometime in the New Year. ON you've ever wanted to get lost in a computer game then Explorer could be the one for you. It's coming out on the Electric Dreams label and has been created by the busy Ram Jam Corporation, who claim that the game has four billion locations. That may or may not be true but one thing is for sure--you Do get a whole planet to caxplore. The idea behind the game is that your ship has dropped out of space and crashed on a strange Jungle world. on the way down bits fall off your ship and are scattered across the planet. Your Job armed only with a Jetpack and a lasrer pistol is to find the bits and put your ship back together again and escape. There are some odd, hostile inhabitants too. The graphics are unlike anything you've ever seen on the Spectrum-reallyThey end a real atmosphere to the game which should be out now on the Spectrum at .99. Amstrad and 64 tape and disk versions are coming soon at .99/.499. 122 "


"Dare you face the Assault Machine! from Nexus It blends strategy with shoot-em-up action. Once the inhabitants of planet Targon were stellar vikings. They pillaged across the galaxy. provoked a devastating war and were finally imprisoned on their own world. Now, many centuries later, disturbing reports have reached Imperial Space Command. Targon has been taken over by a fanatical organisation known as the Infiltrators. They are rumoured to be building a massive Weapon system The game opens with Peacekeeper in geostationary orbit above the Targon sea. First you create and target your search droids.

Graphics and gameplay are brilliant on the Amstrad version C+VG spy saw during a visit to Elite Towers and other machine versions are on the way before Christmas. Ikari Warriors is a pretty straightforward Commando clone but you get to drive about in tanks, swim through rivers and generally have a fun time. Elite are also working on Commando 86, a two player multi-directional scrolling follow up to the original mega-hit. It looks a bit like Gauntlet 's clothing and is being developed for the 64, Spectrum and Amstrad. Also on the way from Bombjack 2, and Airwolf 2. Airwolf is based on the coin-op smash Nemesis. 00 01 01 Academy just nglish h Hits ever e for am the slip is inced first n the comScanner Unit Compass/Adf Unit NO JUMP/Door Unit Infra-Red Unit None mone 005 006 000 Delay BONDS .. ned High LES LLLL main Drive Power RUX Power . ..

By completing a special secret trick a player is allowed to enter the Secret Room (the other players in the game are temporarily suspended from play). If he completes the task he is given, the player is rewarded with a large bonus score as well as permanent potions and food. All of the original Gauntlet opponents remain with the addition of many new creatures. Among the newest adversaries is the Dragon. The fire-breathing dragon is found guarding the exit to the maze and requires several direct hits to overcome. By slaying the Dragon players are rewarded with a permanent potion and and a bag of treasure. At the start of the next maze there will be a hint on how to find the Secret Room Players will find several new potions to collect as well as all of the original potions.

Then there's Firebird's Druid-out now on the 64 with other versions to follow. Another two player game this features all the elements of the arcade original. Closest to the original is Dandy from Electric Dreams. Programmed by the Ram Jam Corporation this game was licenced from the programmer of the Atari original. Only Druid has similar scrolling similar to the arcade version. Storm and Dandy simply flip from screen to screen. Of the three Dandy will probably give Gauntlet a run for its money in the chart battle this Christmas. But so far we've only seen the Spectrum version. Up at US Gold they've got the Amstrad, 64 Atari 8bit and ST versions on line.

Unfortunately the computer version will only be for two players. Ironic, as the original Atari computers had four joystick ports! But it will have the speech. Better than Solo Flight or Kennedy Approach There's no doubt that the computer version is going to be every bit as playable as the original. TIPS FROM THE PROGRAMMERS Bill Allen, Sounds man: \"The speech is far beyond anything you've heard on a game. Not even Solo Flight or Kennedy Approach come anywhere near it.\" They're short, they're sweet and so are these tips! But the four Guantleteers reckon they are all you need to start enjoying their game. Shoot the monster generators as soon as possible  Work as a team  Look carefully at any food you find. All that looks tasty...  Collect special potions Remember what your mother told you and don't shoot the food! More points are to be had from hand to hand combat Use potions to kill Death Plan ahead WHAT THE PROGRAMMERS SAY: Bob Armour: \"We've already done the game's 163 different levels and added a few of our own. These are the 'Swine' levels. I first read about Gauntlet in C+VG. I went over to Warwick University because they had one there. After that I was hooked. "

"* noso Pong, the very first arcade game, makes its return in the form of Arkanoid. Clare Edgeley also gives the lowdown on the game to avoid Spellunker II O ARKANOID MIGLIE COMET Toto jumping on me n with Woop any dreams you ye ey Koy Ang. Remember Pong? All monochrome graphics, a couple of blocks for bats and a wildly bouncing ball. Well, Taito has decided to resurrect this ancient theme in Arkanoid, and you'll probably be as surprised as was when you hear that it is in fact a very playable and addictive game. The basics of bouncing a ball round a screen and moving your brick along to catch it on the rebound are the same. What are different are the colourful graphics, lots of bricks to knock out and the addition of extra features to make life easier...or harder, depending on how good you are. Arkanoid is simple, and perhaps that's what makes it such fun. You dough on the sausage very control a VAUS craft which slides back and forth at the bottom of the the bounce at any point to hit useful. It means you can restar screen in a Space Invaders manner. Above the VAUS crafta is particular bricks more accurately. Further levels are reached when fancy name for a sausage like platform) are stacks of coloured you've cleared the screen of bricks and demolished the wall. There are bricks arranged as a wall. The ides masses of screens to follow, each is simple enough just bounce the ball, hit the bricks to make them harder than the last. And it's at this disappear and catch the odd one stage that the nasties are introduced. They take a variety of which topples down for bonus features. shapes but have one thing in It's harder than it sounds. For common they fall slowly from one thing, the ball is likely to the top of the screen and are rebound off stray corners and deadly if touched. However, take bounce uncontrollably round the heart, if you're lucky the ball might bounce into them and destroy screen. When that happens it's them before they get to you. AS really hard using the controls to catch it on the rebound. But there's the wall blocks their passage but they fall from the top of the screen more. Some bricks don't disappear, they fall towards you once you've made a hole they'll and if you manage to catch them meander down, sometimes rising, but in the end reaching the bottom. you might be given one of seven extras: the ball might slow down Another thing you'll notice as or it might not rebound when you you travel through the game is that catch it but land like a lump of the walls get lower, causing the ball to rebound more quickly. And, of course, if as often happens, you 20040 don't catch the ball, you're dead. The VAUS craft explodes and you lose one of your there lives. The controls are different, too. Instead of a joystick there's a knob which you turn left and right to control the VAUS craft. It's very sensitive and needs only a slight nudge to set the fat sausage sliding, out of range of the ball, across the screen. Arkanoid is a lovely game. Fast, colourful, simple and addictive.! found it very difficult perhaps that's just my natural clumsinessand the only way I was able to see more of the game was through the continue play facility. A great little game which, after all, is just another brick in the wall!\" HALLEY playing area, there's a strip down the right hand side which maps out the comet's progress towards the planet and how well you're doing to halt it. Halley's Comet has come and Halting it means blowing it out of gone and won't be returning for at the skies, no easy task when there least 70 years or so. But it has left are zillions of other things to something in its wake which keeps_annihilate too. The most dangerous it in mind, for a few months longer are the meteors which swarm at least down, Gyron style, making it a Taito, jumping on the idea of a tricky job to destroy them in one promising game, has come up with swoop. If they hif you, you can say Halley's Comet, and though it's goodbye to any dreams you may about eight months old now, it's still hold of coming out of this suicide lurking in the back of arcodes sol mission alive, and if they hit the thought I'd take a look. planet you're supposed to be The idea of basing a game protecting they'll cause untold around Halley's Comet was a damage. You just can't win. The good one, surrounded as it was by idea is to hae a fast triggeringer so much publicity, but how to make and a working joystick. The former it into an exciting and playable I have, the latter behaved like a game? I know, let's make it a space slug and I can only hope my shoot'em up and the penalty for ternble score was due to this failure is the planet colliding with defect! your planet. Macabre. But that's There are several ways of losing what it's all about. in Halley's Comet. When all your You've got the idea? Good, well battle ships are lost; when the let's go out and save the world.

"O  om LO o oo OO is. I suppose it's to help you prepare for the worst, and get more money ready to continue playing, or it might galvanise you into shooting more accurately. But meteors aren't the only things to watch out for. Stationary space stations abound, and though they look insignificant, fly over one and you'll find it's solid. Booom! Another ship destroyed. The best thing is to try and avoid them or blow them out of space. And then there are stray comets not Halley's I don't think which shoot down with a marvellous burning blue tail. These must be stopped it's quite easy if you're ready for them. You've just got to be quick. But the best feature of all are the satellite ships you can collect to increase your fire power by eight or ten times. You'll notice them, and probably ignore them at first, as nothing to worry about. Just little space ships doing nothing which soon disappear. But if you fly over them they ll attach themselves to your tail in a V' formation, and if you have enough of them, nothing will get past you. It's normaly at this stage that a huge comet will burst from the top of the screen and knock a massive hole in your defences. There are also objects which Taito call ship-shaped bombs. didn't find any, but if you press the emergency escape button they act as smart bombs, destroying everything on the screen and giving you a welcome breather. Not for long though, because you'll notice that Halley's Comet is about to collide, something you'd forgotton about in all the excitement, and that the planet is past praying for. When it does go up it's spectacular. The screen pans down to show the rim of the planet and shockwaves of orange working upwards in waves Bye, bye planet. I don't know why I let this one slip past me, should have looked at it months ago when Halley's Comet was making it's brief but spectacular appearance, but more likely I was star gazing at the time. Still, if you haven't played it yet, it's well worth a bash. Not the best shoot'em up in the world, but certainly not the worst either. Though I'm not sure about the idea of colliding comets.

"Maintain COMPUTER + VIDEO GAMES 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE LONDON, EC1R 3AU  I am just writing to say why the hell don't people want arguments in the letters page? I mean, what are letter pages for? I like a good laugh when I read your magazine (no it's not a pun) so when I turn to the letters page I always look for people arguing, but, what do see? People crawling and creeping saying don't do this or don't do that. So come on print THIS and we will see if anyone writes up and disagrees. Also I would like to say that the Airwolf pokes printed a year or so back for the C64 don't work. So let's see you print them right and print some old ones for people like me who have not been reading your mag for long. David Williams Stoke on Trent Yeah! I'm not hot tempered but I do like a good blazing row! Let's have more arguments! And who sent those Airwolf pokes in! You'll be feeling my hot breath on your neck if we find out... I am writing in reply to the so called General from Holland in the October issue of your great magazine. He said: \"Are the sound facilites of the Atari ST as good as the highest arcade standard?\" No, of course they are not. But who said they were? Tony Takoushi certainly didn't. In the article refered to, Tony only said that about Millipede which just so happens to be a slightly dated arcade game. The ST is the best value for money on the market at this moment. You should be able to judge a new computer by the amount of support it gets from the software houses. Now compare what is available for the ST with the few items that are available for the Amiga. Which do you think is the best? Can you also tell me when the cinemaware programs will be available over here on the ST. Simon Jervis Nottingham You know we can't take sides here Simon! And I hope we're not going to get into one of those boring my-computer-isbetter-than-your-computer arguments. They make me fume! As for the Cinemaware stuff, many of our readers were as amazed as us at the quality of the pictures we printed. No news on a release date here but you could try contacting Mindscape direct at 3444 Dundee Road, Northbrook, Illinois 60062, USA. o I am writing to thank you for putting the competition to win a day out at the golf open in your magazine. As you may have guessed I was the winner! My wife and I had a brilliant day out. We were treated like VIP's the complete day, by the airport staff, (we flew on the shuttle to Glasgow) by the staff at Ariolasoft and the other people who shared their stand and who got us VIP seats at the 18th hole. The staff of Ariolasoft were so friendly and made us feel at home they did everything to make our day fantastic. Thank you everybody and especially Amanda at Ariolasoft. Paul & Jacky Greenough Manchester Your letter brought a warm glow the everyone here at C+VG-and not just because I accidentally set fire to it in the waste paper basket. . I have been reading your mailbag and wrote this letter to see if you could help me. My sister bought her 10-year-old son an Atari computer but, it is an old one and he has only got one cartridge -the one he got with it and we do not seem to be able to get him any more. Can you help us as he is going mad. P. Richardson Liverpool What you don't say is if the Atari is in fact a proper computer or the old VCS dedicated video game machine. But your best bet is to contact Atari direct on 0753 33344. I read your magazine with interest but I dread looking at the pictures! The text presentation is the best in any magazine I have seen, but the pictures and review selection annoy me and many of my friends. When you magazine is put together all the good screen shots are replaced by shots from Speccy's and Amstrads, machines that suffer from B.G.T. C.O.S.S.

I was horrified on our poor Speccy/Amstrad pals to read such a biased and self but surely they would opinionated piece on bullfighting appreciate colour photo's with no and absolutely nothing on the sprite clashes, although I do think quality of the game itself. I always many programmers are getting thought that a review of a game their act together over multi was about the quality of graphics: coloured games for the Spectrum sound; value; playability. i.e. Lightforce.
