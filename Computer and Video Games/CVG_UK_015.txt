Forty-eight pages of games for all the popular computers, tightly packed into one super free supplement to ensure that the Christmas micro is put to good use. Of course we won't be cutting down the usual high quality content of the magazine, we've just been working specially hard, looking out and testing extra programs for the Book of Games and we hope you think that it's been worthwhile.

Be sure and get your free Book of Games. Newsagents have been warned to expect the rush from Saturday January 15. THE SEVENTH EMPIRE GOES TO WAR The Seventh Empire will be at war as from the February issue of Computer & Video Games and we want you to get involved in the conflict. A rulebook is on the way to all of you who have so far entered this unique play-by-mail game but the rules are also briefly outlined for the curious on pages 16 and 17 of this issue. If you haven't yet sent in your entry form then please fill in the form below straight away and despatch it to us. Because of the strange deadlines imposed upon us by Christmas holidays, only those forms which reach us by December 21st will be entered for the first round of the game in our February issue. Any entries which arrive later will be included in the March issue game of Seventh Empire. The Seventh Empire is a unique game/competition which will only cost you the price of a stamp each month. Specially designed for C&VG by Mike Singleton, the inventor of Britain's top computer-moderated-game, Starloard, it can be played by up to 10,000 readers. There will be a winner each month and an overall winner over the entire run of the game. The winner of our first turn in February will win a Colour Genie home computer. Every player will control one of the galaxy's many tribes with seven space fleets to despatch around the star system. He will hire his fleets out as mercenaries to take part in the conflicts between rival empires, choose plum planets rich in resources to raid, commit acts of piracy on rival fleets or trade his way up to a high score by careful watching of the galactic fortunes and commodities. The game is moderated by a Commodore Pet computer at our end but there is no luck in the play, only skill, foresight and sheer animal cunning. Each month a new galactic map will be published in C&VG to show ship numbers at each star system and help you work out your tribe's profits. We will also publish battle reports which may have changed the face of the galactic map. A diplomatic diagram which will show how the empires have reacted to wars and raiding ships, which empires are currently at peace and which have declared war. Information on where the imperial ships are travelling to and a Gateway chart which will show which of the 600 or so routes were hit by pirates. From this information you will be able to piece together your score for the turn. At our end the computer will come up with a top 10 high scorers for that issue. Scores will vary from several thousand points amassed to minus figures for those who traded badly.

"A TEXAN! PROBLEMS Dear Sir, A big thank-you Computer and Video Games for a program for my TI 99/4a. I am now buying your magazine not just skimming through it at a bookstall! I am certain many T.I. owners, there are a lot of us out here, will be doing likewise. Will you be inviting programs suitable for the TI 99/4 or 99/4a? Stay on the Texas bandwagon. Bernard Bailey, Althorne, Essex Editor's reply: We are always interested in new and original programs Bernard. How about sending us some of your ideas. spend in the purchasing an Atari 400 or a BBC micro is money well spent. Below, are some facts that are incorrect or omitted from the Spectrum brochure. I own an Atari 400, and I have used a BBC, and they are amazing machines. Their graphics resolution is far superior to the Spectrums, and the comparison of the BBC and Atari's four sound channel to the Spectrum's channel (all one of them), is absolutely ridiculous. The brochure claims that the Atari computer can only present five colours on the screen at once. This is not true. Three of Atari's fourteen graphics mode support 16 colours or luminances on a 15360 point array, without the intervention of the Atari's second micro, ANTIC Using ANTIC, it is possible to have all 128 colour have to be purchased to bring the basic machine up to the standard of most computers. I'm sure that the cost of adding colour graphics, sound channels, A to D, Hi-res graphics and a neat case to house the arrangement, to any of Sinclair's computers would easily outprice the  that the Atari 400 costs, not to mention the amount of processor time available from a single micro that has to look after all of this. M. D. Caballero, Ramsgate Kent. Dear Sir, I have a TRS-80 16K level 2 and have made quite a few good programs which I want to send in to your magazine, However, I have no printer and since most of them want the program printed out I have a problem. So is there anyone out there who could print out the program for me? lan Bailey, Streatham, London. MICROVADER SINCLAIR SOLUTIONS MAGAZINE MOANS Dear Sir, I read with interest your article on the TI 99/4a home computer, but the reference to the 99'er magazine at the conclusion of the article was of particular interest and inaccurate. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you and your readers that MPI of Cambridge Road, Barking are no longer supplying 99'er magazines and would urge them not to part with any money. MPI said that they were returning my subscription. That was in August and I'm still waiting!! I would like to add that luminance combinations on a since February I received 61440 array. ANTIC also only two 99 er magazines offers fine scrolling windows, from MPI which in my book player missile graphics, is absolutely terrible service. display list interrupts etc. M. K.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPET COULD YOU BE A WINNER? To turn your games program into a household name you need to be four kinds of expert. You'll need to be an expert programmer and inventive designer in the first place. Then there's the question of the manufacturing expertise necessary to ensure the quality of the tapes will give the best possible load for your prospective purchasers. Marketing expertise will help put the best package around the tape and make sure that the program gets maximum exposure in the right media. Advertisements must be de signed for real impact and a knowledge of which specialist press to place them in, would be handy. And how about distributing the cassettes once the purchaser's appetite has been whetted. Getting them into the computer dealer shops, setting up a mail-order system Never realised how much work these software houses have to put in eh? Well that's the promise we are tethering to our new Games Program of the Year Competition. Starting in our December issue we are carefully sifting through your games listings, looking out for that program we consider to be something special. And come next November we will take the writer of the best games program we receive and hawk both him and his program around. We will take him to a top software house and get their advice on tidying she program up, securing it against software pirates, giving it that final professional polish. We'll have a top audio company brought in, to bring out the copies of your tape in prime condition ready for loading. The next stage in the program hype will be to have a marketing puter magazines aimed at giving it maximum exposure over the whole marketplace. We'll have the cassette distributed, set up a mail order system to deal with its sale. And at the end of the month, having fully emersed our winner in the tricks of the trade and given his cassette the sort of treatment even top software houses would struggle to equal C&VGs top programmer will be able to sit back over Christmas and wait for the money to come rolling in.

Dastardly bands of do-badders, always plundering, more evil than Long John Silver and Captain Hook combined. The universe is plagued by an overdose of bad guys. Berserkers, intent on blowing my world to smithereens and sending vast hordes of rampaging robots to terrify my peace-loving people. Empire Builders, fiendish, powerhungry magnates on perpetual egotrips. They remind me of the American Presidents on Earth, years ago... But, I digress. There are some half-way decent chaps about. Mer chants, for example. Hyperspace hypermarketeers, these are relatively harmless. Mind you, like all salesmen, once they get their foot in the door... The Apostles are pretty bearable too, although, when I arrive home after a gruelling voyage, to find my people in the grip of religious mania, it becomes very wearing.

Tim has won for himself a set of five ZX81 Psion cassette games and a Sinclair printer. He has also earned the chance of a trip down to London to look around Psion's software house and see their game design team in action and talk about Buggy with them. Charles Davis of Psion, who was part of the judges panel who checked over the entries for the competition explained the strengths demonstrated by Buggy. \"We felt Buggy deserved to win because Tim had considered the practicalities of putting his game onto a computer, in some detail. \"He clearly appreciated what could and could not be done and went further and suggested details of the application. He has developed the makings of an amusing and exciting game. The presentation is excellent and Buggy certainly has a realistic potential.\" The Buggy in the title, moves over a scrolling landscape which includes a series of water jumps. The track is produced randomly at the right-hand side of the screen and by changing gear and speed the car manoeuvres over the terrain, picking up speed for the water jumps. Although the idea sounds similar to one of the current arcade games, its way of coping with the jump problems is quite original and Tim has gone into some depth working out the best way to approach the problems involved in the game. Buggy sounds a fascinating game, and if anyone out there would like to try and use Tim's many diagrams, flow-chart and extensive thoughts on the game, to turn it into a working program, please send a stamped addressed envelope into us and we will dispatch a copy of Buggy rules to you. Four runners-up in the competition will also receive the five Psion ZX8l cassettes as a prize. The runners-up are: Maggot Mania by Paul Dobson; Hang Glider by Bernard Isherwood; Tightrope Walker by D.M. Harris; and Strategic Command by Ben Bryant. PUZZLING SOLUTIONS We thought we'd catch a few of you out with our sneaky Mastermind Competition in November but you were up to the challenge. The vast majority of entrants spotted that Puzzle C had been altered to make it possible. First three out of the hat with all four answers correct were: George Stout, The Walk, Potters Bar, Herts; Ivor Davies, Bryn Road, Brynaman, Dyfed, and Robert Funai, Craig Court, Girvan, Ayrshire. Congratulations and Invicta Electronic Masterminds are on the way. If you can shoot down the invaders in Space Attack on this month's Puzzling pages, you could win a Computer Games' hand-held space invader game. We want your entries in by January 14th at the latest and the first three with the lowest possible solutions will receive the prizes. Full details on page 72. Right, for those of you who complained that they read the November issue's Puzzling answers before they got a chance to try the puzzle... read no further! At least until you have glanced at our Gaudy Monster and Omnidose brain-teasers. If you're still with us I assume you have already looked at pages 72 and 73. Here is a sample solution for Gaudy Monster which scores 516 points, let us know if you have a better score. And left are the dominoes, successfully pieced together from Mr Wheel's diagram.

The display screen used with our computers is composed of 192 horizontal lines, each containing 320 dots. Delivering colour and luminosity instructions to each dot for a second requires 3.7 million cycles...a lot of work for the normal 6502 processor. That's why the Atari computer has equipped its 6502 with its own electronic assistant. It's called ANTIC, and it handles all the display work, leaving the 6502 free to handle the rest. What this means to you is uncompromisingly spectacular display capabilities without loss of computer power needed to carry out the demands of your program. That's a quality you just don't find in ordinary home computers. And it's one of the reasons some computer experts say that Atari computers are so far ahead of their time. There's more...which is what you'd expect from Atari Language. The Atari Home Computer uses several programming languages to give the user maximum control of its extraordinary capabilities. PILOT, Microsoft BASIC and Atari BASIC are understood and spoken by the Atari computer. You'll also find our Assembler Editor cartridge indispensable for machine language programming Sound. An Atari computer has foursound generators, or voices, activated by a separate microchip. This leaves the principal microprocessor chips free to perform other tasks. And you can take full advantage of this capability which is designed for easy programming Change. Atari Home Computers have been designed to make change and expansion easy. The Atari computer has a modular operating system that can be easily replaced as new technology develops. If you need it, memory expansion requires no more than inserting additional RAM modules. And the Atari ROM cartridge system also makes it easy to change languages. In short, your Atari computer won't become obsolete by future developments...because it already incorporates the future.

"FILES GOING BY THE BOOK ... work on computer chess in progress at present. The Kaissa program which won the world championship in 1974 has not been developed much since. Although some of the conference papers are far from simple for the uninitiated to understand, Advances in Computer Chess, 3 and the two earlier volumes, published by Edinburgh University Press, are the best available works for the serious student of the topic. The next conference is due in 1984. Will computers have reached master level by then? To conclude, here is a game played on the evening of the conference between Danny Kopec a U.S. Master and former Scottish champion -and BCP, a good example of a well-developed and relatively strong program. Danny Kopec was playing BCP and an early version of BELLE 30 times slower than the current onesimultaneously As well as a hobby and a game, computer chess has long served as a vehicle for serious research in computer science, especially the branch known as artificial intelligence which is largely concerned with the methods by which people solve problems requiring complex reasoning. There has even been a series of academic conferences on the subject and the papers from the most recent one are soon to appear in book form under the title Advances in Computer Chess, 3 to be published by Pergamon Press and edited, as before, by Michael Clarke, a researcher at Queen Mary College, London. The conference itself was held last Easter at Imperial College, London and attracted delegates from nine countries as well as speakers from no fewer than seven. The first two conference talks were by Ivan Bratko, a Yugoslavian, and Don Beal from Queen Mary College who have been independently investigating the question \"why are valuations of positions based on deep analysis more reliable than \"static\" ones made without any analysis?\" This seems obvious (and if it were not so, most chess playing programs are carrying out a vast amount of calculation for nothing), but it is tantalisingly difficult to answer precisely. At last, an explanation (or, at least, a partial one) has been found and is given in the book. Other theoretical papers at the conference dealt with different aspects of searching trees of variations, forms of automatic learning, long-range positional planning, measuring the \"information\" contained in a chess position, and psychological experiments on both people and machines. Two of the most interesting papers at the conference were presented by Ken Thomson, of Bell Laboratories, and Mikhail Botvinnik who was making a rare visit to Britain from the USSR. I have described Ken Thompson's invention BELLE in previous articles. It (or she?) is a special-purpose machine built solely for play. ing chess, and won the third world Computer Chess Championship held at Linz two years ago with a score of 4/5. The development speed of BELLE is as impressive as its subsequent results. The initial design was in February 1980 at which point its components (1,700 chips) were ordered. BELLE's first move was made in July 1980 and only two months later it won the world championship! The machine generates a candidate move in just over one two-millionth of a second and can examine 160,000 positions per second. The opening \"book\" comprises 300,000 positions (compared with an estimated 200,000 positions in each volume of the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. The entire book is scanned in one and a half seconds. BELLE's official rating is now around 2150, but improving its performance further is prohibitively difficult. It is remarkable that the philosophy behind BELLE (fast and extensive searching of variations) is the exact opposite to that adopted by Mikhail Botvinnik, who as well as being a computer chess researcher for many years was three times world (human) champion. His conference talk (see panel) on \"Decision making and computers\" stressed the important of examining only a small number of positions at each turn preferably only one and to restrict the analysis for each move to approximately 50-60 â€” well chosen -positions in all. Only by this means, in Botvinnik's view, can master play be achieved. Botvinnik's program \"Pioneer\" has been a long time in development but may well be a major advance when it appears. Sadly it seems that there is virtually no other USSR BCP (White) versus D. Kopec (Black) 1. P-K4, P-K3; 2. P-Q4, P-QB4; The \"Franco-Sicilian\" defence.

"OLOMOO CURSE OF THE BY DAVID HEALEY Somewhere in the Mountains of the Moon there lies an ancient Aztec temple.

"GALAXIANS) BY CRAIG FISHER From out of the deepest recesses of space comes a convoy of aliens bent on destruction your destruction! Can you halt their determined advance? This is a version of arcade Galaxians, complete with those nasty swooping craft which dive down at you from the skies. To make scoring harder in this version you can only shoot these diving aliens â€” and not the ones in the convoy. Key 'l' moves your laser base left, key '3' right. Use 'O' to fire. The high score so far, claimed by the author, is 4100. Can you do better?

"Here's a really explosive board game. You'll have to be really careful not to start off a chain reaction which will literally wipe you out! It's a two player game based on a board game called Explosion â€” difficult to play on a board but tailor made for the TRS-80. You are presented with a 6x6 grid and each player in turn introduces one of his counters either onto an empty square or a square occupied by one or more of his own counters. However, each square has a point at which critical mass is reached and fission occurs. Corner squares explode when two counters are on them, side squares explode when containing three counters, central squares go up when four counters occupy their space. When an explosion occurs the counters on the exploding square are distributed across the board. Any enemy counters on the latter square are captured and become counters belonging to the mover. Should receiving squares attain critical mass further explosions will result. Any player having no counters left at the end of his opponent's move is the loser. The game has some interesting sound effects which can be enjoyed via the cassette port.

"LUDO Quick thinking, an eye for the main chance and a grasp of tactics are what you need to beat the computer at this adaptation of the famous board game Ludo. It may seen simple at first but your Sharp will prove a tough opponent in this battle of wits. If you fancy a more even battle why not take on a friend the program allows for two players to take part. All the normal rules of the board game apply here and the computer will not allow you to cheat! There's a nice graphic dice to control all the moves and you simply use the \"Space' key to get it rolling. Remember if you manage to land on an opponent's counter represented on the Sharp board by graphic characters â€” it sends him right back where he started from a very satisfying move! For those who can't remember the childhood tactics of the game, it's all a question of deciding which piece to push along in front. I tend towards a one-out, allout strategy but will let you develop your own tactics to get your four counters home fastest. You will need to get an exact move to finish on, so there's a little luck involved at the death but you'll just have to trust your Sharp not to cheat on its dice throws. It's during games like this that you really notice those Shift-y keys the Sharp has!!!

"For your Tandy TRS-80 and Video Genie DRACULA ISLAND We've capitulated! So many people have asked for a Kansas quality Adventure, that finally, here it is. This has all the ingredients of the traditional adventure plus an involved plot, which will take a great deal of solving. The aim is to get rid of Dracula, but of course you have to find him, and at the same time have the correct objects at the correct time all the way throughout, otherwise you will not get very far. There are countless locations, objects and happenings, with the game operated in the normal way with either single key entries for the regular used words and the program operated with two separate words throughout. The programmer says it will take on average three weeks to solve! But unlike normal adventures, this one can be saved to tape, thus allowing you to load the saved data, and so resume at the same place and time and with the same objects as you previously left the game. Needless to say, as our very first adventure, it's a good one. It's machine language of course! .50 We are offering TEN good TRS-80 Video Genie programs in our annual January sale ask for details.

"VLING heroes 151P BY TREVOR TRURAN Example of bounce CAN YOU STEM THE ALIEN TIDE? # # # 5 6 7 5 4 6 Enter each new value here If all the arcade aliens were joined tentacle to antenna the line would stretch very nearly from Hazelbury Plunknett to furthest Wollumboolawonga. The link can be completed provided you and your trusty laser can give the deep fried treatment to these, the latest misguided monsters who have crossed the Cosmos in the belief that Earth is their new paradise. The puzzle can be solved by hand and brain right here on the page (may we recommend a piece of thin paper laid on top, so that several attempts can be carried out?) or a program can be written which will achieve the task in the most efficient manner. To begin: place your gun on any of the firing positions A to F and loose off a shot. This, as in all future firings, will have two effects: One alien lying on that vertical line will be destroyed and that firing position will have its value (shown by the number) reduced by one. Enter the new value in the grid below the firing range and prepare to move. After each shot you must move your gun the distance in squares equal to its current value. You can move to right or left but must proceed in one direction unless the value of the square would take you beyond the firing range. In this case you \"bounce\" back from the end square, as our sample picture shows. At the end of your move you must fire the laser and reduce the value of that square by 1 even though there may be no aliens to shoot at. You must be sure never to land on a square and reduce its value to zero as you will then be stuck and the rest of the gang will land with consequences dire to the future of the human race. True success will only come if you can complete the task in the lowest possible number of moves. Remember this is no easy entanglement with a bunch of alien E.T. wets, but the future of this very Earth is at stake. Realising the gravity of the situation, the editor of this magazine feels prompted to reward three space-war heroes who find the correct solution. Try a few rough attempts first to work out how the aliens move. Send your lowest solution to: Space Attack Competition Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8, Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JB, before January 12. The first three out of the hat will win hand-held space invader machines.

Words, to be valid fodder for our toothsome fiend, must be of three letters or more and must be bold type entries in Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary, Revised Edition. Words must not overlap along the line and must be separated by a bar. A word once used must not be repeated on any subsequent line. Each line scores the total of all the letter values which appear in it. The letter values are shown above the top line. So keeping \"Y\" in is worth extra points. A bonus can be scored for each word which is of five or more letters and is equal to the length of the word; a five-letter word gains five extra points and so on. When you have entered the score for each line add on the sum of your bonuses to give the final grand total the greater that is, the more peaceful the leviathan.

"BRIDGE BY ALAN HIRON DEALING WITH THE DOUBLEDUMMY POSER Perhaps your bridge memories don't go back as far as mine but in the late 1930's Ely Culbertson sponsored AutoBridge. In other words, bridge for one player. The idea was neat and simple you slipped one of a number of master charts into a flat container with a number of metal hatches on the top. you opened your thirteen hatches and saw your hand. You decided on a bid, you opened another hatch to see if you had made the right bid. If you hadn't, you read the manual to see where you had gone wrong and made the right bid instead. Then you opened your left hand opponent's first bidding hatch, found out what he had done, looked at your partner's bid and then your right hand opponent's bid. Now your next decision right, carry on; wrong, correct and so on. Then the play started after you had reached the approved contract. You opened the first card hatch on your left and saw the opening lead, inspected dummy â€” thirteen more hatches to open. You carried on, logically enough, by deciding on your play to each trick before opening the appropriate hatch to see if you were right or wrong. I suppose it might have been thought of as the Charles Babbage contribution to computerised bridge. Now back to the 1980's. After the personal computer that plays bridge, came a logical step. If you have your own machine then for a relatively small sum you can buy a plug-in addition to your store ROM, of course that contains the raw material of a large number of hands, rather exciting colour graphics, sensible bidding for the hands and sensible play. The plug-in board â€” produced by Intelligent Software for Tandy or compatible machines â€” doesn't play bridge it just sees if you can, for it knows the hands and has been preprogrammed to cope with whatever you try. The release date is December 1. More details when I have had a chance to play with the package more thoroughly. In my last article I talked about the possibilities of running an exhaustive search to tackle the play in the sort of bridge problem where you can see all four hands the socalled â€” or rather misnamed â€” double-dummy problem. As I had suggested, if the problem involves only five or six cards per player, then absolutely all the legitimate sequences of play can be inspected. As soon as you advance to larger numbers of cards (like thirteen per player?) then the computation becomes too massive for present day machines, even huge main-frames let alone a personal machine. And I am looking on the bright side! The sort of problem that comes along in real life involves you â€” as declarer â€” seeing only dummy. If asked how best to play the hand, an exhaustive search would involve creating and testing all possible ways of distributing the opponents' twenty-six cards between them! It all sounds impossible complex, but there are simplifying routes to be considered. Suppose the computer is set a problem involving all 52 cards but where the target is to make all thirteen tricks. It would be completely lunatic to explore all of the avenues of play which started with the declarer managing to lose the first trick. It is the old story â€” if you want to look at all the possibilities the programming is easy it just takes a few centuries to run. How infuriating to have a power failure in 2342 AD when one of your descendants was nearly there! But perhaps it wouldn't worry you too much! But a more sophisticated program, taking many times longer to write, should reduce the size of the calculation by several indeed many, orders of magnitude. Try this very simple example â€” a double squeeze in a three-card ending: S A 3 HK D none C none SKJ S Q 10 HA none D none DA C none n S 2 H none DK CA With South on lead and clubs as trumps it is easy for the human play the Ace of Clubs. If West discards HA you are home and dry. So West parts with SJ, dummy with the new useless HK and now East is squeezed. Here it was relatively easy to look at all the possibilities as they were as few. But as South required all the tricks, it would be time-wasting to examine all the sequences of play starting with a low spade from both South and North. You see the point? Far more programming but less computation You can try to be too sophisticated. You remember the story of the chess computer that made a silly looking move, watched by and sneered at by many top-ranking human players? Only later analysis proved that the machine was right in the sense that any alternative would have lost more quickly. Who knows? Maybe exhaustive searches will still produce hitherto unknown and exciting plays on the bridge scene. Watch this space. Computer and Video Games hopes to bring you them first!

"MACHINE CODE 6502 REGISTERS ACCUMULTOR INDEX REGISTER LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE ... INDEX REGISTER PROGRAM COUNTER STACK POINTER PROCESSOR STATUS REG CARRY 1 -TRUE ZERO -RESULT ZERO IRO DISABLE 1-DISABLE DECIMAL MODE TRUE BRK COMMAND OVERFLOW Figure 1 NEGATIVE 1-NEG from last month that a memory location is selected by 16 address lines and can be specified by a 16-bit binary number (equivalent to a hexadecimal number from 0 to FFFF or a decimal number from 0 to 65535) and each memory location contains eight-bits of data (equivalent to a hexadecimal number from 0 to FF or a decimal number from 0 to 255) Because the assembly languages are so different we will look at the processors individually. We have already looked at some background material on binary numbers and the structure of a computer system. Although there will be more of this background material later on, this month we will be dealing with microprocessors and some, simple assembly language instructions. To understand assembly language we need to look inside the microprocessor. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the internal registers (memory locations and working storage) of the 6502, 6809, and Z80 processors. Some registers hold an eight-bit binary number and others a 16-bit binary number, and all instructions use or operate on the contents of at least one register. There are many differences between the three processors in the number, names and uses of the registers, but there are similarities among the main registers. The Program Counter, PC, keeps track of the address of the instruction currently being executed, and is updated automatically every time an instruction is executed. The Stack Pointer (S in the 6502 and 6809, SP in the 280) is used to keep track of subroutine calls and returns. Although these registers are very important in the operation of the processor, they can be ignored in elementary programming. The most important registers to the programmer are the accumulator, A (or two very similar accumulators A and B in the 6809) and the flags (called P for Processor Status Register in the 6502 CC for Condition Code Register in the 6809, and F for Flags in the 280). The accumulator is used for performing arithmetic and logical operations, and although some of these operations can be carried out in other registers there are some operations which can only be carried out in an accumulator. The flags record information about a binary number or about the result of a calculation, and are used in binary arithmetic and in conditional jumps (the equivalent of IF... THEN GOTO... IN Basic). The other registers differ greatly between the three processors, and will be introduced slowly throughout this series The first instructions we are going to look at move data between the registers and the memory. You will remember BY TED BALL THE 6502 AND MNEMONICS ... The 6502 uses the mnemonics LDA, LDX, LDY (LD being an abbreviation for load) in instructions that fetch data from memory into the registers A, X, Y, and STA, STX, STY (ST being an abbreviation for STore) in instructions that fetch data from the registers into memory. As well as the opcode mnemonic we need an operand to indicate the memory location involved. The 6502 has several addressing modes, which are methods of specifying the memory location or register involved in an instruction, and we will begin by looking at two of these addressing modes, immediate and absolute. In immediate addressing the actual data is included in the instruction, and a hash sign, #, is placed in front of the data to show that it is immediate data. Thus, we may write: LDA #22 LDA #$16 LDX #$10 LDY #$10 The assembly language allows us to use several different notations for writ ing numbers. Two of these are shown in the examples above; decimal numbers, which are written in the ordinary way with no distinguishing marks, and hexadecimal, which are distinguished by being preceded by the dollar sign, $. Thus 22 and $16 represent the same number Note that, because the registers A, X and Y contain eight-bits the operand in an immediate mode instruction must be an eight-bit number (0 to FF hex, or 0 to 255 decimal). The result of these instructions is to replace whatever was in the register by the value specified in the instruction Obviously, we cannot use immediate addressing with the store instructions STA, STX, STY, because there is nothing to tell us where to store the number. In absolute addressing we specify a memory location. The load instructions the contents of the memory location into a register, and the store instructions put the contents of the register into the memory location. The instruction LDA $1000 takes the eight-bits from memory location 1000 hex and puts them into the accumulator, while STX $1000 takes the eight-bits from register X and puts them into memory location 1000 hex. Note that we need four hex digits to specify an address. There are also instructions to move data between the registers: TAX (Transfer contents of A to X). TXA (Transfer contents of X to A), TAY (Transfer contents of A to Y), and TYA (transfer contents of A to Y). In all these instructions only the destination (register or memory location) is changed; the source data remains the same. Thus, LDA $1000 leaves the contents of memory location $1000 unchanged, STX $1000 leaves the contents of the X register unchanged, and TYA leaves the contents of the Y register unchanged. 78 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"MACHINE ICODE GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE 6809 The 6809 assembly language is very similar to the 6502 assembly language. We write decimal numbers in the usual way with no distinguishing mark, and precede hexadecimal numbers with a dollar sign. We have the opcode mnemonics LDA, LDB, LDD, LDU, LDS, LDX, and LDY to load data from memory into the processor registers, and STA, STB, STD, STU, STS, STX and STY to store data from the processor registers into memory. The mnemonic must be followed by an operand to specify the memory location to be used. Like the 6502, the 6809 has a number of addressing modes which allow the memory location or register involved in an instruction to be specified. The simplest addressing modes are immediate addressing where the data is contained in the instruction, and extended addressing, where the memory location to be used is contained in the instruction Examples of immediate mode instructions are LDA #22 LBD #$16 LDD #$1234 LDX #$1000 The hash sign is used to indicate immediate addressing; decimal numbers are written with no distinguishing sign, and hexadecimal numbers are preceded by the $ sign. Thus LDA #22 means \"load the decimal number 22 into accumulator A\", LDB #$16 means \"load the hexadecimal number 16 into accumulator B\", and LDX #$1000 means \"load the hexadecimal number 1000 into register X\". The two accumulators, A and B, each contain eight-bits, so the operand must be an eight-bit binary number (equivalent from 0 to 255). The 16-bit accumulator D is actually the two eight-bit accumulators combined, with A being the high order part and B being the low order part; the instruction LDD $1234 thus means \"load the hexadecimal number 12 into accumulator A and load the hexadecimal number 34 into accumulator B\". The operand in a LDD instruction must always be a 16-bit number, and if we were to write LDD 1, the result of this instruction would be to put 0 in A and 1 in B. The registers U, S, X, Y, are 16 bits long and take a 16 bit immediate operand Some extended mode instructions are: LDA $1000 LDD $1000 LDY $1000 LDA $1000 takes the eight-bits from memory location 1000 hex and loads them into accumulator A. A 16-bit load instruction cannot, of course, take 16bits from an eight-bit memory location, so it uses two consecutive eight-bit memory locations. Thus LDY $1000 loads the Y register with the contents of memory locations $1000 and $10001, the contents of location $1000 becoming the high order part of Y and the contents of $1001 becoming the low order part of Y. Similarly, LDD $1000 loads the contents of location $1000 into A and the contents of $1001 into B. The store instructions in extended mode work in the opposite direction from the corresponding load instructions. Thus, STA $1000 puts the eight-bits from accumulator A into memory location $1000, STD $1000 puts the eight-bits from A into memory location $1000 and the eight bits from B into memory location $1001, and STU $1000 puts the 16bits from U into memory locations $1000 and $1001. We cannot use immediate addressing with store instructions, as this is meaningless. As well as the load and store instructions, which move data between registers and memory we have the TFR and EXG instructions which move data between registers. The operand with these instructions has the form rl, r2 where rl and r2 may be any two registers of the same length. Thus we can write TFR A, B which transfers the contents of A to B leaving 6809 REGISTERS X Index Register Y-Index Register Pointer Registers U-User Stack Pointer SHardware Stack Pointer PC Program Counter Accumulators Direct Page Register INC Cc Condition Code Register Carry Overflow Negative IRQ Mask Half Carry -FIRQ Mask Figure 2 -Entire Flag COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 79 "

"MACHINE ICODE A unchanged, or TFR X, Y which transfers the contents of X to Y leaving X unchanged, but we cannot have TFR A, X because A is an eight-bit register and X is a 16 bit register. Similarly, we can write EXG A, B which exchanges the contents of A and B, or EXG U, Y which exchanges the contents of U and Y, but not EXG A, U. hexadecimal number must be followed by the letter H. Thus, LD A, 10 loads the decimal number 10 into register A, and LD H, 15H loads the hexadecimal number 15 into register H. We can load an eight-bit number (0 to FF hex or 0 to 255 decimal) into any of the registers A, B, C, D, E, H, L, in this way. We can also treat the register pairs BC, DE, HL as if each pair was a single 16-bit register, and write, for example, LD BC, 1000H.

Note that a decimal number 1000H and 12H in memory location is written in the normal way, while a | 1001H, the instruction LD BC, (1000H) puts 34H in C and 12H in B, but the register pair BC will be treated as if it contained 1234H. We can store data from registers into memory by instructions of the form LD (1000H), A or LD (1000H), BC. LD (1000H), A puts the eight-bit number from A into memory location 1000H, and LD (1000H), BC puts the 16-bit number from register pair BC into memory locations 1000H and 1001H, with the 8 bits from C going into location 1000H and the eight-bits from B going into location 1001H. There is also a group of instructions of the form LD register 1, register 2 which move data between eight-bit registers; for example LD A, C moves the contents of C into A. However, we cannot move data from one register pair into another register pair in a single instruction; if we wish to copy the data from BC into DE we must use two instructions, LD D, B and E, C. A very important form of the LD instruction uses a register pair as a pointer to a memory location. For example, if HL contains 1000H (10H in H and OOH in L) the instruction LD A, (HL) puts the contents of memory location 1000H into the accumulator A, and the instruction LD (HL), A puts the contents of A into memory location 1000H.

"potential to produce a different reply for every location, and then some more, giving additional clues about hidden features, such as a secret exit, whilst LOOK HOLE may produce a reply like \"I see a bottle of rum\". It may be arranged for the bottle to then be displayed as a normal visible object. The outcome of the game will be affected, since it might be that without the rum a pirate will not be so helpful, and this might eventually be crucial to the game. The program code to achieve these multiple replies can be relatively short: 4500 IF K2 > 30 THEN 4800 : REM SUBSCRIPT IN RANGE FOR 4510 4510 IF P(K2) <> 50 AND P(K2) <> LN THEN LET Q1$ = \"I DON'T SEE IT HERE\" : GOTO 100 4520 ON K2 GOTO 4530,4190, 4540,4190,4550 . . etc. 4530 LET Q1$ = \"IT SAYS: BEWARE THE SLEEPING DRAGON\": GOTO 1000 4540 LET Q1$ = \"THERE ARE 2 LEVERS RED & GREEN\" : GOTO 100 4550 ...etc 3999 REM ***** LOOK (EXAMINE) PLOT OF THE GAME OF THE BOOK An adventure game is very similar to a story in that it must have a theme. The extent to which the game differs from a book is the degree of interaction with the plot. This can vary from the player having no choice but to guess or deduce the correct commands, to allowing multiple choices of action at every turn. In other words, the plot may branch endlessly. In a book, the outcome is fixed. In real life there is an infinite choice of actions, each with vastly differing results. An adventure game falls between these two extremes. Perhaps this explains the popularity of Adventure, it is fiction in which the reader participates and affects the outcome. Depending on the player's actions he can change the storyline to a certain extent. A verb is the key to an action. We can look at all the different circumstances in which the verb may be uttered, and vary the outcome accordingly. The greater the number of different circumstances which can change the effect of using a particular verb the nearer the game will be to real life. Of course, on a micro this will have a definite limit, but with cunning we can disguise that limit to a certain extent. Let us take as an example the word LOOK, often synonymous with EXAMINE in an adventure. LOOK AROUND has the Note the use of the existing default line to avoid writing it twice. Line 4500 checks that K2 isn't greater than the highest permissible subscript set by the DIMension of the array P. You can thus see that the limit to the different response to LOOK are set only by the computer memory available and the author's imagination! 4000 IF K2 <> (code for AROUND) THEN 4500 4010 ON PN GOTO 4100,4110, 4120,4190... etc. 4100 LET Q1$ = \"THERE'S A BOAT ON THE HORIZON\" : GOTO 100 4110 LET Q1$ = \"I SEE A SECRET PASSAGE\" : GOTO 100 4120. ...etc. 4190 LET Q1$ = \"I SEE NOTHING SPECIAL\" : GOTO 100 This last line is the reply dreaded by all Scott Adams fans, and is the default line where no specific reply is required. LOOK (object) implies EXAMINE and requires a different approach. First we must check whether the object is in the player's current inventory, or if it is visible in the player's current location. Assuming there are 30 objects in the game, then: BEWARE THE RIGELIAN HOUND Strange Odyssey is yet another of Scott Adams' offerings, and has a science fiction theme. The hardy adventurer finds himself in a broken down spaceship somewhere on the surface of the moon. A good space traveller will of course know what precautions to take and how to use low gravity to advantage. A good adventurer will need similar insight! Armed with a phaser it is quite likely that the explorer will come to an allen room and discover the way to travel to stange worlds. He might visit, for example, an intergalactic zoo and become the prey of a Rigelian dia-ice hound not a beast to endear itself to any but the most devoted of dog-lovers! Or he might get trapped in a methane snow storm and run out of oxygen. The object is to collect treasures of ancient alien civilisations and store them where? Ah-ha! Can you get there? Can you mend your crippled ship? And can you climb slime trees? This game, as might be expected from Scott, is not easy, but it is fun. It simulates many features from science fiction books and movies if you are a science fiction fan you should find your way around easily enough! Strange Odyssey is written in machine code, and versions are available for the TRS-80, Video Genie, Apple, Sorcerer and Atari computers. Thanks to Mr. Harding of Molimerx for the review copy.

"arpath is set in a Wild West scenario. A group of troopers are making their way through Indian country to relieve a beleaguered garrison. They win if their flag is carried successfully to the gates. The Indians, on the other hand, are intent on removing the garrison from their territory. They win by capturing either the garrison's headquarters or the flag. Whilst the troopers have the greater firepower, this is matched by the increased mobility of the Indians so that the game is fairly evenly balanced. It is a relatively simple wargame. The rules, by modern wargame standards, are not complex but despite this it can produce interesting situations. This is your chance to change history and be remembered as the hero that saved Fort Cheraqick! Or perhaps you would prefer to be known as the Indian Chief that saved the West and kept his tribe out of the reservations. In this series of articles I am going to explain some of the techniques used to develop my wargames using Warpath as a typical example. Although it was written for the TRS-80 Level II, it is intended to provide sufficient detail to enable it to be modified for any computer. As we progress we will introduce the rules of play and list further routines until we have a complete wargame. As well as taking part in an interesting project, it is hoped you will find the ideas helpful in your own programming. First, an explanation is necessary. Warpath contains 174 lines in multiples of 10 (i.e. from 10 to 1740). To avoid any subsequent confusion, every line will be printed exactly as it appears in the program. This will mean that occasionally lines will include references to subroutines which, if they are not relevant to the current article, are not listed. To ensure that the program runs properly without them, I have simply WARPATH More than just a wargame. Ron Potkin's series develops into a thrilling wild west conflict but also teaches some advanced programming techniques. added a RETURN at the appropriate line with the remark, \"STUB\". See lines 860 and 950 for examples. These will eventually be filled out and completed. For those of you who are unfamiliar with wargames, let me first describe the hex. Most games are played on a board divided into squares so that pieces may move in four or, or if you include diagonals, eight directions. But squares are a problem in wargames because a piece moving diagonally will, in fact, move further than a piece moving, say, North or West. This difficulty has been overcome by dividing a map into regular hexagons, or \"hex\" for short (see figure 1). Whilst the number of possible directions is reduced to six, you will see that all distances are equal. I have adopted the hex as standard in all my wargames with the exception of Turret and Track, which uses squares. We are going to start by describing Bigscreen and Window. These are the basic elements of the program and were designed so that several wargames could be devised (Kreigspiel II and Up Periscope! use the same module). Instead of an area of 120 hex which fills the video screen, the map is held in a separate part of memory and only the relevant section appears on the screen. This large map is called Bigscreen and contains 31 rows of 128 print locations. The video is regarded as a Window looking over a portion of the map. Bigscreen is an array of 3968 bytes and can hold a map of 496 hex (see figure 2). The numbers represent the first print position for the pieces. Figure 3 shows the layout of the Window. It starts at the print location 132 and consists of 11 rows of 56 bytes leaving room for messages and the map co-ordinates. It displays at any time an exact image of a portion of the map. You should examine both arrays carefully and, in particular, note the way that the hex are laid out. We will discuss them in more detail later when we look at the movement of pieces. In a program of this nature many of the routines are concerned with searching the hex. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 89 "

"Right now we have to try and relate the Bigscreen positions to the Window If a piece is at location ML on Bigscreen, how do we decide what part of the map should appear in the Window? In the wargame, it is desirable that the current piece being moved be in the centre of the Window so that it can \"see\" in all directions An algorithm is needed which, given ML the location on the Bigscreen, will calculate: N7 the address of the top-left corner of the selected rectangle, and SP the position at which the piece will appear on the screen. Unless the piece is near the edge of the map, SP will be 476. The following routine will perform these calculations: Z=128:R=MLAND127:Q=INT(ML/128) IFR<28THENSP=132+R:N7=OELSEIFR >92THENSP=60+R:N7=72ELSESP=156: N7=R-24 IFQ<6THENSP=SP+64Q:RETURNELSE SP=SP+320 IFQ>24THENSP-SP+64*(Q-25):N7 =N7+2560:RETURNELSENZ-N7+Z* (0-5);RETURN Looks complicated, doesn't it? Try it. Type the lines in, INPUT various values for ML and PRINT out the values SP and 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 24 25 26 2 29 29 30 31 3 252 S N7. Most of the routine is spent checking to see if the piece is near the edge. Once we have made the calculation, the correct part of the map is transferred to the Window and after we have carried out the player's move, the updated image is transferred back to the map. It is, of course, very important that we do not disturb ML during this process. Unfortunately, transferring the map to the Window or copying the Window back to the map is very slow in Basic and so we must use machine language to perform these functions. Never used this before? Well, don't worry, I am going to make it as straightforward as I can so that you can't go wrong. Strings are used in the program to save memory. Compared with DATA statements and other methods of using machine language in Basic programs, strings are very efficient in terms of convenience, time and space. In general, an 80% saving is realistic you can see this by comparing the length of lines 3000 to 3021 with the length of lines 1540 to 1560 which will eventually contain the DATA. However, strings do have disadvantages: the lines containing them cannot be edited or listed and neither 34 nor zero should be used since these have special meanings to the Basic editor. In the Basic listing that follows we shall use DATA to create a string of machine language and then delete it from the program. For those of you that want to understand the machine language contained in the DATA, a section of the coding which performs the algorithm above is shown in figure 4. You can see that the second column matches the DATA statements. The program contains a loader which converts the code held in DATA statements to strings and a driver to demonstrate the Bigscreen routine. It is important to fill X$(1) with exactly 232 characters, X$(2) with 33 and X$(3) with 57. You will find that the editor will refuse to accept line 1540 in one shot (the limit is 240 characters including the line number), so type as much as you can and then enter the EDIT mode and press X. You will be able to add the additional characters at the end. Finally, make sure you save the program When you run it, there will be a pause while the strings are created. The program will stop if it discovers errors in the DATA lines. X$(3) is used to clear the Bigscreen by loading each byte with 128. Do not use the space (or 32) if you intend using graphics since you cannot manipulate the pixels. X$(1) is used to get the appropriate rectangle, a character is printed in the Window and then X$(1) is used again to put it back. Finally, the Bigscreen with its contents and co-ordinates is scrolled across the Window. Press ENTER to stop the scrolling. All lines up to 1740 which are multiples of 10 are extracts from the wargame. Eventually, all other lines can be deleted but we will keep them until all the strings are complete.

"are a few notes on some of the lines in the program: Line 10 Why do I perform this GOTO 760? I have learnt that it is a good idea to put my subroutines near the beginning of the program. There are two reasons for this. The interpreter searches for line numbers from the beginning of the program and so it is marginally faster. I experimented with this in a program on the ZX81 and found that I could save several seconds by moving a subroutine from line 9000 to line 20. It saves space. GOSUB50000 costs bytes but GOSUB50 only costs 3. You will discover that I am a bytemiser and will try anything if I can save a few bytes as a result. You can see therefore that by jumping to line 760, I leave room for subroutines. Line 190 POKES U and U+1 with the value of P which must be between 0 and 32767. POKE is a marvellous instruction to try out on a friend, but wait until he has typed out a long program without a single SAVE! Line 390 O is the GET/PUT flag. If O=1 copy BIGSCREEN O=0 copy WINDOW to BIGSCREEN. Don't forget that although USR will accept only one argument up to 32767, you can use compound arguments. In this case, I want to pass the variables ML and O. Since ML ranges from O to 3968 in steps of 8, I am able to use Bit O as the GET/PUT flag. Line 440 Obtain the address of the string in X$(V). If your computer has VARPTR then rejoice! It's missing on the ZX81 which makes using machine language somewhat cumbersome. Line 760 â€” Sets MEMORY SIZE. You must use CLEAR before and after GOSUB 190. This method avoids having to remember the size each time the program is run. Many types of Basic already have this built in. Line 1110 The machine language routines often call other routines. This would involve POKING new addresses each time the program is run and could cause problems with 34 and zero. Instead, a fixed jump table is used (see variable RU) and its address coded into the routines. Once you understand the principles, experiment with the routine. Remember that ML must always be an even number otherwise it will upset the GET/PUT flag. Next month I shall continue with the Internal Board and the Piece Table which looks at the make-up of the cavalry garrison and indian tribe.

"Praphics IN-BETWEEN THE LINES To produce graphics that move, a technique known as \"in-betweening\" can be used to automatically give the stages in an animated sequence. As its name suggests, when given starting and finishing pictures, the technique will provide all the frames in between, and in the correct order. This method has been used in one form or another to help automate the production of cartoon films.  Computers have been adopted to relieve artists of the routine tasks of creating the in-between frames for many sequences. To begin with a simple example, the frame that is half way between a square and a tall thin rectangle can be constructed as shown in figure 1. The dashed lines show the paths from the points on the first frame to the corresponding points on the last frame. The frame that is half way between the first and the last is virtually half way along these paths. be joined up in order to draw the picture in two arrays. We shall store the column and row positions respectively for the first picture in the arrays XF and YF, and for the last picture in the arrays XL and YL. The following program will then draw the first frame, an in-between frame half way between the first and last frames, and then the last frame. It assumes that the frames are each drawn by joining 25 points, but this number can be changed throughout to any other. 10 DIM XF(25), YF(25),XL(25), YL(25) 20 REM ENTER COLUMN AND ROW POSITIONS 30 REM FOR FIRST AND LAST FRAMES 100 REM DRAW FIRST FRAME 110 MOVE XF(1),YF(1) 120 FOR J=2 TO 25 130 DRAW XFC),YFU) 140 NEXT 200 REM DRAW IN-BETWEEN FRAME 210 MOVE (XF(1)+XL(1) 2,(YF(1)=YL(1))/2 220 FOR J=2 TO 25 230 DRAW (XF(I)+XLCD)) /2,(YFC)+YL)/2 240 NEXT 400 REM DRAW LAST FRAME 410 MOVE XL(1), YL(1) 420 FOR J=2 TO 25 430 DRAW XL()), YL() 440 NEXT J Fig 2 The program can be developed further to draw any number of frames in between the first and the last. The program is written so that the user can enter the number of in-between frames that is required. The program is obtained by replacing all the lines with line numbers in the two-hundreds in the previous program with the following segment. 200 REM DRAW ANY NUMBER OF IN-BETWEEN FRAMES 210 INPUT \"NUMBER OF INBETWEEN FRAMES\".NF 220 FOR I=1 TO NF 230 X=(XF(1)*(NF +1-1)+XL(1)*I) (NF+1) 240 Y=(YF(1)*(NF+1-1)+YL(1)*I) (NF+1) 250 MOVE XY 260 FOR J=2 TO 25 270 X=(XFC)*(NF+1-1)+XL()*I) (NF+1) 280 Y=(YF()*(NF+1-1)+YL())*I) (NF+1) 290 DRAW X,Y 300 NEXT] 310 NEXT I IN BETWEEN LAST FRAME Fig 1 The in-between frame in this example has the shape that we would expect. It has been produced entirely by geometric means, and any number of in-between frames could have been generated in essentially the same way. It only remains to develop a program to carry out the same process. In writing the program, we must first decide how a picture is to be stored, since we must provide the initial and final pictures. We can do this by storing the column and row positions of every point that has to The sequence shown in figure 2 was produced with this program. In order to generate realistic sequences, the initial and final frames should not be too dissimilar. However, when very different frames are used for the first and last ones, some very interesting, and sometimes artistic, results can be obtained. BY GARRY MARSHALL "

In it you play the part of a helicopter pilot on a mission to rescue hostages trapped inside enemy barracks deep inside hostile territory. The game has obvious associations with the Iranian hostage affair with the helicopters crashing in the desert, and the hostages running helplessly towards the helicopter, with enemy tanks in hot pursuit. No mention is made of the affair of course in the interest of good taste, but whatever Choplifters associations it is undoubtedly an impressive game. The graphics are superb.

Pulling it down makes him duck and pushing it up makes him unleash his best uppercut Pressing the trigger button allows him to jab. The computer boxer Rocky is a mean and hard hitter. You will have to be on your toes to avoid the knockout. Indeed it takes a good fighter to last more than one round with him. If you do get knocked down the count starts and if you are still on the canvas at ten then you have lost and you are asked for a rematch. If you manage to avoid a knockout and go through the three, two minute rounds then the winner is the player with the most points.

How its German programmers managed to get it to play as well as it does on just the basic Vic-20 and an 8K memory expansion is beyond me. It has nought-to-nine levels of play which take you from a one second to four hours response time but my own favourite was level 2 which responded in five seconds on average. There is a good book opening understanding built into this program and it followed a Sicilian Defence through to the sixth move before attempting the unusual. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Boss was that it never seemed to stop trying in a game and even when I had given games up as draws it still attempted to gain something positive from the positions. Boss' display is the best of the three and it accepts four key move entries. It also runs independent chess clocks on both players and offers the additional challenge of trying to beat it while only taking five seconds per move. On the minus side: it is difficult to spot the moves as the pieces don't flash, there are some terse instructions and it displays the mate and stalemate comments in German. Also it took me three loads the first time to get it into a Vic. It costs .99 from Reading-based Audiogenic. Getting started 6 Value 9 Playability 8 Bug-Byte's advantage is on the price side but it has also done away with the overused notion of chess levels. It also offers a menu enabling you to change how far the computer looks ahead, list out the moves made, set up chosen positions or save the current position, The tape loaded first time everytime but you need a full extra 16K's worth of memory to play it. The Bug-Byte's display was the least impressive with the King and Queen symbols initially confusing. the program gets around the need for levels by letting the player input a three figure number from 0 to 9.99. The number before the decimal point is the moves it looks ahead, the number after refers to the number of moves the computer will consider at each play Playing the Sicilian Defence this program also went out of book\" after two moves From Liverpool-based Bug-Byte at .

Well we looked up three ways of turning the Vic-20 into a chess opponent. Let's start with Commodore's offering, Sargon II, which comes at .70 in cartridge form and has the advantage of not needing any additional memory. The board display is easily distinguished and it does offer the most comprehensive set of instructions for use. Chess is the sort of familiar game which you need a lot of instruction on and the Sargon Il package does give a very complete rundown on its six levels. Sargon II has a good response time and also plays a very fair opening without ever suggesting it had any book theory crammed into its memory. Contrary to chess players who feel that a machine should be judged on the number of different levels it boasts, six is quite enough and probably more than most chess players will find a use for It is hard to fault this well-presented cartridge except on price which does not compare favourably with its two rivals, but remember that both of these will need additional memory to play. It is available from all good Commodore dealers.

It is considerably more difficult than those earlier games, where you had really only two controls to worry about. Asteroids added hyperspace, thrust, rotate left, rotate right and fire. The game places you in control of space ship being bombarded by a shower of meteorites that come at you relentlessly from the four corners of the screen. Using your controls you must spin your ship around to shoot the asteroids. You can also dodge in front or behind the rocks using the thrust button. If things get a little too hot and a collision seems certain the hyperspace button will make you momentarily disappear and then replace you at random on the screen. But this could prove as dangerASTEROIDS keyboard overlay which, although it seems just like a gimmick, is actually quite useful in Asteroids-type games where you have up to five controls to concentrate on My main criticism of Meteor Storm is that the thrust button has inertia, causing you to drift helplessly towards an asteroid, frantically rotating and thrusting Sinclair's official software writers, Psion, entered the field with Planetoids.

This was not as good a version of the game as the others played. An admirable attempt had been made to simulate the rock-like texture of the asteroids but this did not work.

The object of the game is to pilot your spaceship through underground caverns while avoiding numerous obstacles that are placed in your flight path. The first obstacles to be overcome are surface to air missiles and the occasional floating mine. On your way through this part of the cavern you can pick up more ammunition and fuel. In the second part of the cavern you may have to deal with a whole series of floating mines. Once through this part you come across a series of airlocks. The only way to get past these is to shoot the middle out of them and manoeuvre your craft through the resulting hole. AIRSTRIKE Just to make things a little more exciting you may also come across the occasional fighter trying to shoot you down. Each level has a different colour and your craft carries less ammunition due to the higher gravity. This really is a most impressive game and the English Software Company are to be congratulated Airstrike is available from Gemini Electronics of Manchester at .95.
