He always wanted to be Han Solo, but we reckon he's more like C-3PO always waving his arms about and blathering on. He kind of treats everyone like R2-D2 like they're the one who's stupid. But, just like R2-D2, we all know secrets that Tom doesn't. When he asks us for them we just beep and whistle, heh-heh.

"THE MARKETING JUGGERNAUT BEHIND FFVII computer video games Final Fantasy VII was always guaranteed to be a huge hit. The short demo included with Japanese Tobal No. 1 in September last year, helped push the game straight to the number one slot. But that was just the tip of a massive marketing campaign for FFVII. In the lead up to the game's release, lengthy TV ads were continuously aired and all manner of toys appeared. Novelty egg dispensers in department stores contained FFVII pin badges and super-detailed action figures became available.

R Juan Montes, General Manager of Software Development at SCEE, has written a personal letter of congratulations to Konami Europe. Apparently he, along with the entire software evaluation team have been playing International Superstar Soccer Pro nonstop since it arrived for testing. Mr Montes enthused that ISS Pro is \"the best soccer title ever published on our platform. SCEE would like to congratulate Konami on doing such an excellent job.\" No wonder we gave it a High Five. (Review, page 73). Bandai's Apple-based console, the Pippin Atmark, is set to be released in Europe around April. The CD-ROM based hardware, which uses the same easy-to-operate menu-driven interface as Macintosh, is to be released here by Katz Media. Bandai will handle the release of their own titles themselves. Katz consider the machine's primary appeal to be its built-in multime dia and Internet facilities, allowing it to be used for a variety of on-line applications. Together with its ability to be easily connected to a television, they also consider it to be a far cheaper and easier option for potential Internet users, than buying a PC. Although the Pippin wasn't a massive seller in Japan, Bandai still profited from its reasonable sales, and say they're committed to making it a worldwide success.

NINTENDO 64 Titles that have been named are Mario Paint, Mario RPG 2, Pocket Monsters (the Game Boy version single-handled revived Nintendo's handheld in Japan and has sold well over a million copies), Sim City, and Mario 64! Yep, it seems the N64's flagship game is to be upgraded for DD. Rumour has it Shigeru Miyamoto has always been keen to release a new version of the game, after the US version had many of its minor bugs removed. Selectable characters are also suggested (Luigi, Kinopio perhaps), each with their own special advantages. Although, seeing as the original game would have been fine-tuned specifically for Mario himself, the levels may have to be adjusted too. On the Zelda front, Nintendo have said that they are definitely looking into a cartridge version. It's unknown whether they would release it simultaneously with a DD version, or even before it.

A new game release from Acclaim for the Nintendo 64 reveals the answer: Turok the Dinosaur Hunter boasts the kind of advanced graphics which blur the distinction between fantasy and reality. The time for positive action is now. Men armed with automatic weapons are slaying dinosaurs in cold blood. Worse, an entire species is dying out through our ignorance. Horned males; lactating mothers; defenceless juveniles. All gunned down because people continue to believe a myth. Fact: the Torosaurus is not a bloodthirsty monster. This gentle plant-grazer is triggered into violence only when protecting its young. Which begs the question: how powerful is the imagery which feeds the propaganda? THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK 2 The dinosaurs are back! The new toy line, looks very similar to the original 1993 range, with the only character returning for the sequel being lan Malcolm. All characters come dressed in strange day-glo coloured military fatigues. At least this time the dino toys look better.

Anything at all of interest to your fellow readers of CVG? Well why not do the 'write' thing and get your name on the pages of CVG. This isn't just 15 minutes of fame it's potentially 15 years! But only if you're a collector. Look we're kind of stuck for an intro here this month! We just want your letters! The world wants to read your letters! What are you waiting for?! MAIL BAG, ......................... Computer and Video Games, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London, EC1R 3AU... CVG regrets that we cannot enter into personal correspondence with our readers. Not even if we fancy them loads. SOMETHING LIGHT TO START YE OLDE FAITHFUL 'N'? CVG Dear CVG, After reading and enjoying issue #183 I looked at the index and was surprised to see only three games for the PC CD-ROM. This is pretty poor compared to 18 for the PlayStation. There are a lot of PC owners who would like to see more games in the preview and review sections. Also can you tell me which game to get on PC out of Soviet Strike, Die Hard Trilogy, or Tomb Raider on pure playability? Amit Thakor, Gloucester Dear CVG, I have got a problem on which machine to buy for the summer. I am a Nintendo fan so I don't want to miss the N64. On the other hand the PlayStation looks great with forthcoming games like Final Fantasy VII. However this is also an economical problem. The PS here in Malta costs around m160 (around ) which is extremely high. The N64 (a Japanese version) is m450 ()!!! Chances are that if the N64 will be bought by me from your country. Which console do you think is best for me a four year Nintendo fan? Matthew Aozzopendi, Malta CVG: As the multi-format market develops, CVG will adapt to meet the needs of as many people as possible. It's quite a tricky process but we're aiming to manage it better than most. Of the games you mentioned we reckon Tomb Raider is the best and Soviet Strike has been canned, so we hear. development teams, is now quite different to how it was five years ago. Mr Shigeru Miyamoto has moved into more of a producing role rather than director. Mr Gunpei Yokoi, who originated the excellent Metroid series of games, is no longer with Nintendo. On top of that, Nintendo don't have the exclusive support of key developers such as Konami, Namco, Capcom, Enix, or Square. These companies are all very much in favour of PlayStation meaning N64 may never benefit from the must-have mentality which surrounded Super Contra, Street Fighter II, and of course — the massively popular Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games. However NOTHING has come close to Super Mario 64. The quality of visuals in Pilot Wings 64 is far beyond anything on Saturn and PlayStation. A new Zelda game has the potential to blow everything else out of the water, and Star Fox is similarly priceless. Depends what you mean when you call yourself a Nintendo fan Matthew. CVG: This question gets harder to answer with every passing month. If you were to look at the way the American market has taken to N64, you would assume it's business as usual for Nintendo. Fans over there are more than satisfied. But as you may know from reading our reports from Japan recently, you could be forgiven for assuming PlayStation has taken the place of Super Famicom in popularity. Also of a worrying nature is how Nintendo's corporate set-up, which filters down to the key USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES STREET FIGHTER AS HE LIVES AND BREATHS during an early Street Fighter tournament (set before Street Fighter 1), during the fight Go Hibiki took Sagat's eye as an act of revenge Sagat killed Go Hibiki. Sagat later wet on to defeat the then present Street Fighter champion and took his place as champion. Dan has entered the Street Fighter tournament to show the world the fighting style his father developed (Saikyo-Ryu) and to become good enough to challenge Sagat and to take revenge for his father's death at his hands. Guy was trained by Zekuu who trained him in the art of Bushin a style of Ninjitsu. Zekuu appears in Guy's ending at the end of Street Fighter Zero/ Alpha 2. Sagat is a master of Tiger Stance Muay Thai kick boxing and was Adon's teacher, Adon developed a style that suited his smaller, faster attributes rather than Sagat's larger, stronger yet slower body, which he called Jaguar Stance. Sagat was scarred across his chest by Ryu's Dragon Punch (known as the Sheng Long Dragon Punch), a reminder of his over confidence and under estimating of an opponent. In Ken's Street Fighter Zero Alpha 2 birthday party background there are a number of Capcom characters from other games acting as guests. These are (from right to left) Felicia from Vampire Hunter in the swimming pool, Lynn Kurosawa from Alien Versus Predator climbing out of the swimming pool, Strider carrying the teddy bear (which he throws when a super move connects), Captain Commando holding a present, Eliza Ken's girlfriend (his wife at the end of Street Fighter 2) and then there's Morrigan from Vampire Hunter wearing a very short dress. I hope I have helped clear up a few character background relationship questions that you may have not known, and do hope you print my letter. Andrew Dixon, Teignmouth Dear CVG As a huge Street Fighter and Capcom fan I would like to clear up some of the Street Fighter background questions which you have either been unable to answer or ones that you have answered incorrectly. Ryu and Ken were trained by Gouken in the art of Shotokan Karate. Ryu translates as Dragon, and Ken translates as fist. Gouki (Akuma) is Gouken's younger brother, both were trained by Goutetsu. Gouki translates as Strong Ogre and Gouken translates as strong fist. Both Gouken and Goutetsu appear in Gouki's Street Fighter Zero Alpha ending along with Vega/ Bison. Gouki allowed himself to become possessed by an ancient demon to enable him to become the ultimate Warrior, to prove his power he challenged both his brother Gouken and his teacher Goutetsu and killed them both. This is why Ryu challenges Gouki as Gouki mod-boss challenger in Street Fighter Zero/ Alpha 2, to take revenge for his master's death. Ken Masters speaks of a man who he must challenge and defeat (who is not Ryu) to Eliza at the end of Street Fighter Zero/ Alpha, this is Gouki. Gouki was not trained by Gen but calls him Master Gen as a sign of respect, any true martial art student has respect for a master of a martial art even if they are not that student's teacher. Dan's father was called Go Hibiki and appeared with Dan in one piece of artwork which is included in the Saturn illustration option in Street Fighter Zero) Alpha 2. Go Hibiki trained with Gouken for a short time, later developing a style of his own which he named Saikyo-Ryu which he trained to his son Dan. Go Hibiki was challenged by Sagat SUT CVG: Alright, smart ass! 12 CAPCOM "


"computer video games SOAP BOX PART ONE: BUMS BORN OF A BUM DEAL so-called dodgy chip. A dodgy chip would cost around -40 to be installed. So I don't think paying  would be too steep, as you've got a guarantee and peace of mind. 3. PAL is crap! I've seen around %70 of each PAL game next to an NTSC game and something definitely needs sorting out at Sony. Take Tekken II for example. The NTSC version is amazing! The PAL version is just slower and less dazzling. I've just bought Soul Edge and Rage Racer. I'm just glad I can get hold of NTSC versions because I can't imagine the state of the PAL versions that Europe will be palmed off with. These two games are unbelievable. The PAL versions won't be! 4. Last but not least, instructions. No you don't get any with gold discs, but that's half the fun, and a small sacrifice. Anyway, who needs them? When we have excellent mags like yours! I only buy mags for one of your guides through games which buttons do what, what features there are and so on. So mags also make money out of piracy, even though they don't know it. .................................. STAR LETTER SHOULD HOWARD LINCOLN BE SUED? Dear CVG, I wish Nintendo would enlist the help of more UK based software houses to strengthen the N64 line up. With only Rare and DMA (I think) we are not properly represented on Nintendo's next gen console. Despite what the Americans may think we are second to Japan in quality and game design. I know publishers are supposedly shying away from the cart-based system because of cost etc but I believe if you make a good game it will sell regardless of the format. It seems the Japanese have got themselves sorted out. Admittedly most of the 'Triple A' products are from NCL [Nintendo Company Ltd), but Konami's J League Perfect Striker has landed in my US machine and there it has stayed ever since. An excellent piece of software. The N64 does however need games like Resident Evil to try and shake loose its slightly immature image. One last thing, should Howard Lincoln of NOA be sued under the Trade Descriptions act? I'm talking about his super hyped \"Dream Team\". The Dream Team I know is known for its excellence on the basketball court and destroying the opposition while taking the p**s. On the strength of its current software for the N64 (Mortal Kombat, Cruis 'n USA, Shadows of the Empire) shouldn't the American software coalition be renamed the England cricket team? On second thoughts their software isn't that bad. Brian Brown, Birmingham Dear CVG, I'd like to start off by saying I own a PlayStation and by bringing up the subject of, dare I say it... PIRACY! What's wrong with it? GOLD DISCS, BLAGGS, COPIES, what ever you want to call them. Why does every mag (including yours) slag them off? They do have some good points, and Sony, or any other company, could actually make some MOOLAA out of it. 1. Piracy on the PS is rife! Anyone who has the slightest nouse about the PS-world knows that copies are easy to get hold of. It's not just where I live. I know people from London, the North East, and quite a few more places and the only difference is the price ranging from -). Now I know there are a huge number of dodgy dealers around, as your mag has pointed before, but as the Sony marketing points out the PS is aimed at 18-25 year olds. So what? You might ask. Well if a person of this age group can't tell a dodgy dealer when he/ she is buying a 'chip' or a 'CD' then it's time to pack up. Jack it in, whatever. Besides that I bet 1/3-1/2 of PlayStations are bought because of word of mouth and simplicity of getting copies, cheap games. I was the first person that I know who bought a PlayStation and within six months eight of my mates had invested in one. Not because of Sony marketing, but because of the now famous 'chip' and availability of copied games. I'm sure Sony have made a nice little sum out of it, because my mates can't be the only people who have been influenced by this. 2. When Sony banned DATEL from manufacturing their own 'chip' I think they made a big mistake! Why? Well what if Sony gave Datel the go ahead, but demanded a cut of the profits, then at least Sony could make at least a bit more out of Piracy. The other thing is Datel would probably have a 612 month guarantee so most people would opt for a ligit chip instead of the CVG: Imported games, fine. Pirated games, no way! Of course we know about all this dodgy stuff going on. And it sounds like a real 'teacher' sort of thing to say that we're just directly opposed. But piracy hurts the video games market in a major way, the most obvious effect being high software prices. Occasionally code is 'leaked' before it is finalised something most punters aren't aware of. Can't understand why you'd want to line the pocket of some crook for the benefit of owning a half-finished game. Stoopid. Sure, it's cool to own some of the bigger games before they are released in the UK. This isn't seen as much of a problem by anyone. So it's a shame that this whole 'chip' thing has become caught up in the piracy issue not like the early days of the Mega Drive where people got switches fitted to their console to serve a similar purpose. Enthusiasm we like a lot, and you may want to buy more games for less. Just don't let criminals make a mug of you. * USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES SOAP BOX PART TWO: RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE some of the older games reworked to take advantage of new technology. The likes of Spy Vs Spy groundbreaking, timeless concepts would blow people away if they were respectfully brought up to date. Problem is, the major companies won't take risks because they know what sells they know how to make money. And the small independent publishing houses can't afford to take risks. Perhaps when the PC is firmly established as a major alternative to highpower consoles we'll see a more imaginative market take shape. Original software is out there, oh Shady One, it's just not so prolific compared to the 80s.  ENEMY Retro games! I still own a C64 (from around 1984) and have a fair collection of around 500 games. Now we all know technology has moved on a hell of a lot since 1984, graphics-wise, speed-wise, and sound. But remember the not so secret ingredient is gameplay. Look at Bust a Move 2 case closed... nearly. Having still got a C64 and the games to go with it (which I still play) why can't Sony, Acclaim, Gremlin, Ocean, EA, US Gold and the rest of the bunch realise there is some untapped potential in the games on this format. Spy Vs Spy, imagine in glorious 3D. Paradroid, The Sentinel (a very original game) the list is endless. A couple of software houses have already thought into the matter LucasArts' BallBlazer, System 3's The Last Ninja. Can't others get it sorted and revamp some other golden oldies? There's a lot of great ideas in older formats' games and I'm sure the people who missed out on them the first time would love them on the PlayStation, Saturn etc... not to mention people like me. The Shady One, Lancashire CVG: We've played Cruis'n USA Brian we know what you're saying! Unfortunately cartridge based games do present something of a risk for developers. True enough the right game should sell regardless of format but  is a lot of anyone's money, and is a deterrent. Plus, once you get over the loading time difficulties, the advantages of using CD confidently outweigh the advantages of a cart. Look at the way Namco and Square handle their newest CD games for overwhelming evidence. We're loving the best N64 cartridge games as much as anyone else. But N64 looks as though it's gonna need the 'Bulky' Drive to prove its worth beyond doubt. HOWARD LINCOLN OF NOA HOUNDS HELIERS USITTG -HOLDING G2 POWERL HEHP ONLY. CVG: Here's where 'The Shady One' gets vindicated. Of course it would be excellent to see The Last Ninja from System 3. Maybe one day all games will be like this... 13 "


"computer video games TRUTH OR DARE? I'M SO SMUG I SMUG MYSELF TO SLEEP Dear CVG, I present to you a humourous little poem for your delectation, to be sung to the tune of that famous Beatles recording When I'm Sixty-Four. I hope you enjoy. When I get older, losing my hair many years from now, Will I still be playing Zelda and Axelay? Watching my SNES wasting away. Reading how Bulky Drive's been released throughout US stores Will I still be waiting for the official Nintendo 64!? I must point out that this isn't an attack on Nintendo, in fact it is quite the opposite. I love and enjoy the way in which they treat the European market, and find it very humourous indeed when I hear THE Games and NMS telling the public to hang on for an official machine. Haven't the public cottoned on yet? The plain truth is Nintendo don't care too much for Blighty. We're just an afterthought. Why is my tone, therefore, so smug I hear you ask? Well it's because I happened to purchase the best console ever some four months ago. FULL screen. FULL speed. But wait, you haven't heard the best bit. It cost me , and ironic  cheaper than the official machine. But wait, I hear you cry, what about the software? Surely that's where | come unstuck? Well it just just so happens that the games are the same price, you've just got to know where to shop. But hey kids, don't listen to bad old me, hang on and wait for the official machine and Bulky Drive add-on. Sorry, must dash, got to get back to Mario Kart 64 and try to beat that lap record. John Robinson, London NSRETENDOM Dear CVG, We are writing to express our disgust about the so-called wonder machine, the Nintendo 64. There are a few discoveries that we would like to share with you. We first thought that the 'technology' used in the N64 was the same as that which was used in the now defunct Commodore 64 but upon close inspection we have come to the conclusion that it is actually a re-modelled Atari Jaguar. The reasons for this are listed below: 1. Both machines are the same colour, a dreary battleship grey, which has no life to it at all. 2. They are both of the cartridge format and both have the same size cartridges which fit exactly in the same place on each machine. 3. The 'innovative' joypad design of both the N64 and Jaguar both prove pointless and completely unusable. Also, both pads have a ridiculous amount of buttons which are only practical if you are an octopus. 4. The quality of the first batch of 'state of the art' releases are very similar je naff. We'll explain: a) Mario 64 Four colours (sun-set red, spinach green, tear-drop blue, beige). This game has no control, camera angles are useless, not finished, boring, frustrating and once completed you would never go back to. b) Pilot Wings 64 Two colours (green and blue). This game is slow, boring, hard, no actual aim to the game what so ever. In fact the Super Nintendo version was better. And once completed, you would never go back to. c) Wayne Gretsky Hockey One colour (ice-berg white). In this game every character is made of two polygons, computer is too hard, need twenty-three fingers to control properly and once completed you would never go back to. d) Cruis'n USA Seven colours (al shades of red). It should have stayed in the USA. And once completed you will never go back to. e) Killer Instinct Off Yellow Lots of colours (no gameplay). Probably the most boring, hard to play, unrewarding piece of software to ever go on sale in any country. It would be more enjoyable to insert white hot fishing tackle into the end of your didgery doo. And once completed, you never go back to. f) Mario Kart 64 Four colours (red, blue, yellow, green). The one game everyone has been waiting for over six years finally cam to light. The one-player mode is annoyingly hard, you can never gain a lead from any of the computer opponents. You can be in first position from beginning to end but on the finish line someone bushed you from behind and you end up in eight place. The graphics are technically good but look absolute garbage. Three and four player is like watching the Monaco GP from Brazil, the cars are that small. The music in Manic Miner on the Sinclair Spectrum was better than in this game and if we were asked to describe this game in ten words, we would say, naff, sh*t, garbage, annoying, meaningless, pathetically hard waste of time. And once completed, you would never go back to. 5. Both the N64 and the Jaguar are 64-bit. We presume as the bits get higher, the graphics get worse. The N64 obviously stands for the amount of colours the machines can display on screen at any one time. 6. The graphic styles of both machines are very similar. 7. Upon the release of the Jaguar the games were impossible to get hold of. The same is true of the N64 (though some would argue that the first releases on the Jag were actually worth waiting for). 8. Both machines opted for the cartridge format, both machines require extra storage devices in order to hold more information. As a result a machine costing , suddenly costs nearer . 9. The Atari Jaguar died a slow painful death due to naff games and a hyped up reputation that it could not aspire to. The N64 will soon follow suit. Andrew Blumson and Peter Rollinson, London CVG: Nintendo do care a great deal about the UK we just fit into a different part of their strategy for... for World Domination, or something. Don't know why everyone expects us to be shocked when they say they own an imported machine. If you have the right set up at home, can afford some occasional high prices and not cry about it later, good on you. Most people wait for the official stuff because it's less hassle, that's all there is to it. USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES * PC-ING ME OFF made by Video Logic and is quite a bit cheaper than the 3DFX. Although it won't accelerate DOS based programs, it does fully support Microsoft Direct 3D and its own Power SGL games, which is being supported by companies such as Capcom, Virgin, Psygnosis to name but a few. I'm not sure how you don't know about this card, especially with all the support it's getting. thank you for reading this letter and I hope it has told you a bit more about the world of PCs. Allan Petty, Sheperton, Middlesex Dear CVG, I know you're strictly a PC mag, but you're article on the PC in the February issue was a load of rubbish. You may think I'm being harsh but seriously you don't know what you're talking about. I have been into PCs for about 7 years and happen to know a fair bit about them. Your Top Spec. system is a pile of poo. Why bother with a Pentium Pro 180, which only runs faster on 32-bit applications such as Windows NT, when you can buy a P166 or P200 for cheaper? This will give you much better speed in games and other non 32bit programs. Also 16 megabytes of RAM just isn't enough to run Windows 95 and some of the recent games efficiently. With RAM prices constantly dropping you can pick up an extra 16 megabytes for about . Also a 1.2 gigabyte hard drive isn't big enough for every thing unless you want to spend your time deleting, or even the mistake of compressing it, to make room for other programs. 2 gigabytes or maybe even more is much more future proof. Now onto the section on 3D accelerator cards. Although the 3DFX is probably the best card to buy at the moment, it could all change because of a rather good little card called the power VR. This is SU RICH: Ah, I see, little prick with a big attitude eh? Actually you kind of have a point in that the top spec machine is already out of date. A Pentium P200 with MMX is probably the better option now for games. As for your suggestion of more memory and bigger hard disks well... we went for processing power over storage at that particular pricepoint. As I said in the feature, the whole beauty of the PC is its expandability. Why stop at 32 megs? Why not go for 64? Why not get TWO hard drives? Basically, you've got to draw the line somewhere. As for your PowerVR comments. Well, at the time the feature was written, 3DFX was the 3D card of choice, partly because PowerVR wasn't out. And even now 3DFX remains the most powerful card (Quake, F1 and Tomb Raider are unbelievable). Yes we've seen PowerVR, and it is \"a rather good little card\". But not as good as 3DFX. Still, VideoLogic are coming up with something new which may even surpass 3DFX... hope that's told you a bit more about the world of PCs. Now begone. 14 "

If you don't like it you can stick your controller where the sun don't shine, because this game demands further coverage! So the CPU AI is a joke, but we knew Nintendo wouldn't let us down in the multi-player area. We've discovered amazing shortcuts, skill item tactics, and an all-new speed-boost ability.

In Japan, Major A are considered possibly the best soccer game creators around! This is the team that put together Konami's original International Superstar Soccer for the Super Nintendo. And after three years of working solidly on football games, they reckon they know everything there is in making the very best soccer game. In fact, they're confident their longstanding expertise gives them a massive edge over the skill of any rival footy coding team that other games companies may choose to put together. Of course, we don't have to take their word for it, we can just look at their latest game to find out how good they are. And if J-League Perfect Striker the Japanese version of the upcoming International Superstar Soccer 64 is anything to go by, they're every bit as talented as their word! Rau AG MAJOR A FAVO MEB 97 . The animation is incredible. There seem to be different motion variation even for the same move! 3D STICK CONTROL! 0-2 MAJOR A KONAM JE With any Nintendo 64 game, the effect of the analogue stick is always a point of interest. Of course it's used here. In fact, Major A have stressed that concentrating the gameplay around the 3D stick was one of their two main priorities in creating ISS64 (their second priority was perfecting the motion-capturing). The analogue stick singularly sets N64 Superstar Soccer apart from its 16-bit counterpart by offering an incredible degree of control. Players can increase speed steadily from jogging to running, and complete directional freedom allows you to perform realistic dodging, twisting and snaking about!

I'M GETING PINS AND NEEDLESI International Superstar Soccer on Super Nintendo was definitely one of, if not THE, best footy games of its day. In creating a significantly evolved Nintendo 64 sequel, Major A certainly had their job cut out for them. Keeping all the elements that made the original so playable was an obvious move. So much so in fact, that Major A started this project by building on the original game code. However, this is no flimsy rehash of an old game, every aspect of ISS has been vastly improved from the graphics and animation, to the artificial intelligence and playability. With the team now working on the PAL conversion, UK Nintendo 64 owners aren't going to have to wait long for a red-hot soccer game. Scorchio! WOW con tanto Rolf THE MOST AMAZING LOOKING SOCCER GAME!

"computer Video games QUICK REACTION! Cance start Rob ALMOST HUMAN! HINTENDO 64 In their quest to create the ultimate realistic soccer video game, Major A concentrated on the visuals every bit as much as the game play. And motion-capturing played a key part. Whereas most other areas of ISS64 could build upon the Super NES game (for example, the Al or the moves), this was Major A's first polygon game. As such, they had to start from scratch with the motion-capture. To this end, the game's graphics director compiled an 80-page document filled with around 320 different player actions! Following this, a footballer was then recorded performing 270 of these moves, most of which made it into the final game. The result is a game with amazingly realistic motion. Many motion-captured soccer games suffer from delayed response when performing moves, as they switch from one motion stream to another. J-League impressively manages to counter this. Twisting the 3D stick around or pulling off an assortment of kicks, the effect is near enough immediate and visually blends smoothly into your last action. The goalies are semi-automatic. You can take over control anytime. S* WE LOVE SOCCER WELCHE SICER MBRO WELOVE SOCCER 21 1-0 06 THE MOST AMAZING LOOKING SOCCER GAME!

"SUPERSTAR SOUND! 0-0 computer Video games THOSE LITTLE TOUCHES! Beyond merely motion-capturing player actions, Major A have added all kinds of decorative motions that increase ISS64's sense of realism even more. The goalie waves at players to go further out, and walks dejectedly to the back of the net to collect the ball if his team is doing badly. Players gesture at linesman when they're called offside, and the referee even writes warnings down in his book. NINTENDO 64 The Japanese version of the game features a manical commentary by a famous J-League commentator. We can't understand what he's yammering on about (although a 'Lionel Ritchie 1-2' seems very popular). Nonetheless, we know all his phrases fit perfectly with the action, because the game utilises Konami's Response Sound System (RSS) a special audio program that plays phrases from a massive selection stored in memory, to match events in the game. This Konami in-house technology wasn't actually designed by Major A, but is the soundwork of the Konami's baseball coding team. However, all Konami's teams share their programming tools with each other. Currently Konami are preparing the commentary for the UK version of ISS64. We're confident it should be excellent, as our very own Steve Merrett from PlayStation Plus is scripting it! MF 8 0-1 1-1 BRO Callou NEXT MONTH SCORCHIO!

But for the European version we'll make the difficulty much higher. CVG: Did you find with the Nintendo 64 you could do a lot more with the artificial intelligence, beause the processing power is greater than the SNES? MAJOR A: For the speed, the games machine was a hundred times faster than the SNES! So for the artificial intelligence we were very excited to find that out, because we thought at first glance the intelligence of the computer would be like actual football! But the other side was that the display ability of the N64 was not as much as we expected it to be, so we had a little more difficulty on displaying, for instance, 22 characters. Displaying a lot of characters was kind of difficult. CVG: What was your priority when designing the game. Was it speed, graphics, special moves? MAJOR A: We put emphasise on two parts, and one is how the game would look. It was our first time doing motion-capture, and we used the motion-capturing technology so we thought it would make it as realistic as possible. And the second part is the playability which uses the analogue 3D stick.

It does however roll along the floor until it comes into contact with a building, whereupon it executes a Dragon Punch, and destroys the structure. Another alternative is the Jet Pack. With this you destroy buildings by flying high above them, and somersaulting feet first down, crushing everything in it's way. $2327184 DOLLISION IMMINENT 01:21.7 24 "

When you progress to the time attack stages of the game, you get to choose between all of the cars you've collected so far, as some are able to clear the path better than others. NINTENDO BULLDOZER DUMP TRUCK SALOON CAR You can rotate the view in a similar fashion to Mario, if the buildings are obscuring your view. This can destroy most buildings quite quickly.

Whenever you touch one of these, a signal is released which opens up other parts of the map. Now, when you complete a stage, the map screen has a new branch to it. This is a training mission for a new vehicle or suit which, once finished, leads to even more new levels. Look out for these, as there are usually a couple on each stage. 02:25.2 COMMUNICATION POINTS ILLON 10 TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HO. $1683818 $25000 FOLLOW THE RDU ROADI BE CAREFUL WITH THATI The beauty of Blast Corps is that there is so much within each level that, even when they are completed, the chances of you having found everything is remote. One sub task is lighting up all of the RDUS. These small lights switch on when you walk over them and serve much the same purpose as coins from Mario or the rings in Sonic the more you collect the bigger the bonus. As well as the lights located in the open, others are situated under buildings, or around blind corners. Some of the obstacles in Blast Corps are just too big for you to destroy on your own, so you need the help of other objects. Which is where the TNT crates come into their own. The black boxes which are often on the back of trains need to be shunted (preferably by the bulldozer) into the offending buildings to blow them up. The solution to tricky levels often lies with these boxes, so look to take advantage of them first. Also look out for the cubes with a missile icon on them when trundling around on the motorbike, as they give you more bullets. $216500 $1312 THIS IS AN ROU TRIGGERED REMOTELY AS TOL DRIVE BY 00:03. 00:17.2 01311.6 25 "


"omputer Video games ALL ABOARD THE NIGHT TRAINI $1777780 Whereas most of the vehicles give you complete freedom of the stages, the trains and barges have to stay on the tracks or water. The trains are often carrying another car or a TNT crate, but the only way you can get to them is to manoeuvre the train next to a platform further along the track. As for the barges, they often provide a flat path to join up two sides of a canal, so yourself and the reactor can get across. ITENDO 64 81132280 $1432280 RARES BLAST CORPS!

Once you've progressed into the latter stages of the game, a group of levels become available which are purely for use with the Jet Pack the J-Bomb stages! If anything, they look like the jet pack stages from Pilot Wings and guess what?...they even play like them! On the Magma level for instance, you have to fly around the inside of a volcano, landing on some moving platforms in the bottom of the crater to destroy them. Smaller targets need to be settled on too, resulting in you executing some tricky landings. Using the 'dozer here would be pointless because it's too slow. GOING FOR GOLI There are two types of gold medal to aspire to in Blast. The first is awarded for simply clearing away all of the buildings, thus making the path for the reactor to travel through. The second is much trickier to obtain. Basically, you have to find everything within a particular level. This means destroying all the buildings, lighting all of the RDUS, rescuing any CARRICK POINT scientists and finding the communicators. Only then does the rest of the game open up. By saving the reactor on every level, you get the first set of hidden extras.

NINTENDO 31 To access some extra levels later in the game, as well as clearing paths, you need to find the six scientists tucked away in the levels. To reach them you often need to shoot parts of buildings or blow away walls. For instance, one level sees you having to destroy the side of a structure so that it makes a ramp to the roof, whereupon you need to destroy a couple of walls to gain access to the caravan containing the moustached genius.

LET'S BRING THE HOUSE DOWN HAKKA HAKKA HAKKA 111/100 02:19.3 Just for a bit of novelty value, the programmers decided to add a level that looks suspiciously like Namco's Pac-Man. The idea is to simply drive a miniaturised version of the Dumper Truck around and light up all of the RDU's around the circuit. The other coloured dozers are the ghosts. Touch one and the level is over. Easy. Although Blast Corps is still waiting on a British release date, it'll be out in America in a month or so when we'll be covering it in a little more detail.

ROM RELEASED BY UBISOFT TEL: 0181 944 9000 PC ROM Much has been made of MMX and its potential. Ubi Soft's POD is nearing completion and it's the first compatible game for Intel's new age chip. 128 MPUS 00'09 67 Dear 2 hen Quake hit the Internet in Shareware form back in the Summer of last year, the Internet gaming rules were rewritten. The scope surfers had and still do to fiddle, change and tweak the engine by creating their own characters, weapons and even their own levels, means that the game has a virtually infinite lifespan. Now that Intel have jumped up a rung on the ladder of development with their Pentium MMX technology, the possibilities have become almost unthinkable. Ubi Soft have made sure they are first out of the blocks with a title for it. And the fruits of their labour are starting to bloom with a near finished version of POD. Dod SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN JUST FIVE DAYSI MULTIPLAYER MMX OPTIMISED RACER FROM UBI SOFT!

Even on the standard PC version, lens flares and reflections are commonplace. With the MMX chip installed, you can hear other cars approaching behind you. NOOS INIWOJ 2 / 8 1578 THE MMX AND 3DFX FACTOR So what benefits do the MMX and the 3DFX give to a game like POD? Basically, the 3DFX smooths out all of the textures and makes them look far more realistic using similar techniques to those found in N64 games. In the version we saw, the underneath, of the car was reflected onto the track, and walls enclosing the circuit displayed a realtime reflection of the vehicle. With the MMX inside your machine, the most obvious benefit is that Dolby Surround Sound is also possible, dramatically enhancing all the effects and music. Behind the scenes MMX sharpens the CPU artificial intelligence, making rival cars more of a threat, IN a89 It's not just flat, boring tracks! 1 Except this pic. It's... err, flat! 28 "

ALL GRIP AND NO BRAKES With the chance to play against other people via the Internet, some of the other competitors would have an obvious advantage if they had beefed their cars up. So the game doesn't let you create just any kind of super car. Each vehicle has a set of five parameters: airfoil angles, steering. brake curve, skid control, and tyre alignment. These are all linked together as one complete unit. For instance, if you increase your grip, the other settings take a drop. As our picture shows, it's all very well having loads of grip (95 points), but when brakes are only 25 your control will be badly affected. POD EVEN HAS ITS OWN WEB SITEI Because of the scope of POD, Ubi Soft have set up their own website to keep gamers fully up to date with what is going on in POD world. For starters this site allows you to log on and compete against any number of people around the globe. If this isn't good enough, you're also able to partake in competitions and championships, see how good you really are with a worldwide ranking league, play against \"ghosts' of other racers and even customise your own car with a 3D studio.

You bark out orders to the players, tell the manager who to take off and bring on, then tell the opposition how bad they are. Yet you never get to test these full proof theories...that is until the birth of the football management game. Budding Graham Taylor's now have the chance to put their crazy tactics into practice, and sit back to wallow in the glory if it succeeds, or switch the machine off in a tantrum with a few expletives blaming everyone else but yourself if you get the old tin tack.

OOO Another unique feature to Player Manager '97 MANAGER CONTROL PANEL is how you watch your particular team play a game.

The advantage of the longer matches, is that you can see exactly where the team is going wrong, then change it accordingly. Otherwise, you have to wade through all the stats to work out why you let in five goals against Brighton. PREVIOUS O O ONE FOR THE ANORAKSO O A potential big selling point for this version of Player Manager, is the huge player database included. Every player from the teams in all four divisions of the English League, and all the other football associations around the world have their own photograph, stats for the current campaign, previous seasons and a complete background.

Dare you join the fight in Taito's Raystorm.  RAY FARM RAY TIAM TM aito appear to be on a slight return to form at the moment, with two great arcade conversions appearing this month (see Psychic Force page 68). So what if they're not state of the art, they both play really well. Raystorm is an attractive vertically-scrolling blaster set over eight action-packed levels, featuring imaginative use of polygon based enemies, and some very big bosses indeed. The game plays like a cross between Contra and Starblade, where the emphasis is on good, solid blasting fun. As the scrolling shoot 'em up scene has been getting rather stale of late, let's hope Raystorm freshens things up! FLY ME TO THE MOON START IT S THE YEAR 2219 INNIT! 00080100 INSERT COING) THE BEST PLAYSTATION SHOOT 'EM UP YET All the enemies and levels of Raystorm are polygon based, essential for creating the effect of depth that plays such an important part of the game. Enemies don't always attack at the same height, because of this your ship's lock-on lasers need to adjust to the enemies' height. This takes no more than a split-second, but because of this, the planning of who to target next becomes vital. As you would expect Stage One of this mission takes place on Earth, with levels in between taking you all the way to the final showdown on Secilia. 2219. Travels to the stars have been a reality for the past 100 years. Humans continued to move into space until Earth eventually controlled a Federation, consisting of 20 colonies stretching all the way to Orion. To maintain control all the colonies were put under strict marshal law. Mutiny followed. On the planet Secilia renegade colonies established a new Federation, fighting for freedom, they eventually defeated Earth. After transferring all of the planets occupants to the outer-colonies, the Federation announced that it would destroy Earth! The Balkar organisation had foreseen this, developing the RGRAY. A craft based on technology salvaged from the Secilia star system. The R-GRAY is the only craft able to carry out the mission to defeat the Secilia Federation. Guess who has to pilot it? Welcome to Operation Raystorm. 00104300 TO START HANNIBAL PENDRAGON VERCINGETORIX 0004000 START THE FASTEST BUCKET OF JUNK An assortment of bosses found early in the game. Hannibal is a huge interstella destoyer. Pendragon a mobile fortress, and Vercingetorix a mean bomber, which needs hundreds of hits. YOU DONT LOOK LIKE MR BIG COMING SOON TH There are two different R-GRAY space craft to choose from, which are almost identical in appearance. Both feature an attack system, where enemies are 'lockedon' by the targeting system. Each can fire missiles plus a lock-on laser attack, the main difference being the weapons used by each ship, and the effect of power-ups. R-GRAY 1 is aimed at the beginner, with missiles firing wider, and the lock-on attack recharging faster. GRAY 2 is the advanced model, firing missiles in a single line very fast, its laser is more powerful, taking more time to recharge between shots. Every good shoot 'em up has bosses big bad muthas who need some serious blasting, before going 'bye bye'. Raystorm has plenty, with some pretty unusual names too! Here's our rogue's gallery of the best we've encountered so far. CREDIT 000410 PUSH 2P PLAYER SELECT (MANUAL SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN! *T8 PUSA 2P TO START ESPECIAL ATTACK We've received the finished Japanese version of Raystorm, which is such a spot-on conversion of the arcade game that you have to simulate inserting coins to play it! Hopefully an official release will arrive here shortly. Choose manual or auto lock-on firing. R-GRAY 2 packs a powerful fast shot. GRAY-1 can hit more enemies.  32 "

Just 1236 look at the pictures, man!! STAGE 1 21EAVENS e first saw pictures of this beat 'em up when its Japanese developers, Atlus, revealed it at the PlayStation Expo back in November. Highly impressive it looked too, prompting us to want a first-hand look at the game. Then as if by magic, JVC turned up at our doorstep with the game in their hands, asking if we could play it and give them our opinion. Which we readily did and told them it was good! And that was the last we saw of Heaven's Gate... until now! You see, JVC have returned, telling us they are going to publish the game over here. Which gives us a chance to give you a first proper look at it! THE POWER COSMIC! **** WH WHO'STHERE? * STRANGELY FAMILIAR CONTROLS... VIRTUA-STYLE FIGHTING ON PS Supermoves are becoming commonplace in fighting games, and Heaven's Gate has its own brand of them. Every connected hit charges up an energy bar. Once full, you can hit the left shoulder button to activate your fighter's Sol-Power. During this short glowing period, extra lethal moves can be performed. Learning these surekilling techniques is sure to make the game more spectacular! There are eight selectable fighters, ranging from your standard hero (called Jin), sporty girls (Nanase and Verny), to your hulking beefcakes (a tattooed bald guy called A Hau, and a big gorilla!). Plus there's a weird spindly character called Dulffer. They're all really good characters, but best of all though is the final boss, a skull-faced demon known as... GEEZER! Heaven's Gate uses three attack buttons guard, punch and kick. Fans of Virtua Fighter and Fighting Vipers may find this set-up somewhat familiar, seeing as it's exactly the same as AM2's fighting games. Moreover, the moves are structured identically too. There are plenty of PPK style combos, back/ forward/ punch body slams and multiple kicks. To throw, you hit guard and punch together, and you can drop-attack floored opponents by pushing up and punch. In fact, this is the closest you can get to Virtua Fighter on PlayStation... WINNER This idiotic buffoon is A Hau. You should see his dance. Dulffer clings to the ceiling when he wins. Could this be a move? Two Nanases hit their Sol activators. Power Extreme! FOR BEGINNERS AND EXPERTS ALIKE! Following in the footsteps reveal the names (but not of Namco and AM2, Atlus the actions) of secret have included a Training moves! Other fighting Mode for practicing against modes include Survival dummy foes, complete with with only one energy bar for onscreen moves lists. the whole game and Interestingly, these lists Ranking mode. TRAJNING RODE ****** WALLS TOO! ****** In another tip of the hat to AM2, the arenas in Heaven's Gate are surrounded by walls. No ring outs possible! For the most part, these walls aren't visible structures like the fences and concrete slabs of Fighting Vipers. They're transparent forcefields that only splash into appearance when someone collides with them. The enclosures also have high ceilings, although we haven't found any moves that make use of them. SKICA LISY HAT-FLYERECE RAT AS IT 121000 NEW Training Mode is essential for learning top combos! NEXT MONTH... LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL! The surrounding forcefields ripple when a character hits them. Slam a foe into the ceiling and they lose a bit more damage. Our first taste of Heaven's Gate has left is impressed and we certainly want to see more of it. The import version is already out. So expect more coverage before the game's June UK release! 34 "

VINIC Super Bike SuperBike POSITION COURSE MAP 5/8 TIME 29 02:01:30 hen AM3 decided to follow up their arcade-smash Sega Rally, with a motorcycle race game based around the Isle of Man TT, they created one of the most extravagant coin-ops ever. Aside from the awesome Model 2B graphics, the game features an epic cabinet constructed by AM4 (Sega R&D's machine designers). Sitting in front of a projection monitor, the main control mechanism is a near full-size replica of a superbike, which you steer without your feet touching the floor! Using an Active motion System (AMS) you can lean about with weightless ease! Adding to the realism, the machine also shudders over cobbled roads or during collisions. And as a final touch, there's a multi-speaker sound system, with the exhaust housing a separate unit specifically for the roaring spitting engine sound!

LET Castros Castil THE RACE PROPER! The big question about Saturn Manx TT, has to be over how accurate an arcade conversion it is. With the game still under development, it'd be unfair to technically analyse the game too much. Although we can tell you that it doesn't use the Saturn's high-res mode, nor does it run at 60 frames as second. The Arcade Mode has near enough all the coin-op features including the leaning bike-style select screens and the hidden sheep, accessed in the same way! Pesti 00:37:03 The basic Manx TT game takes place over two tracks. The first is a beginner's course called the Laxey Coast which, once mastered, can be driven around near enough at continuous top speed. The second track is a replica of the actual Isle of Man TT course layout. Overlapping parts of the first track, this one is much tougher, featuring twisting chicanes and massive humps, as you ride through villages and tree-lined country paths. As with an nearly all arcade racing games, the aim is firstly to reach to checkpoints to keep your timer going, and secondly to beat eight other riders to come first! WINNICO M.S.B.

The two standard courses are now accompanied by two new varia tions reverse mirror set-ups of the Laxey and TT tracks. The aim now is to race through the four tracks in order, coming first in each. Beat all three and you get the 'superbike'. With this high-powered, super-handling machine you have to beat all-new superbike competitors on the tracks to win... that sheep again! There have been doubts that Manx TT would play well without having a large bike to steer with. With the normal Saturn D-pad, we've yet to make up our minds about that. You see, we've been using the analogue controller. Leaning left and right precisely, this demonstrates how similar the handling is to the coin-op's, with the back-wheel even pushing out on tight corners. Of course, it does lose some of the coin-op effect without the feedback when hitting the kerbs. BEST -:--:-LAPT 0:49:73 COURSE MAP 00:49573 REVERSE AMZ'S MANX-NIFICENT RACING GAME!

With this team busy working on Daytona USA: CCE, the conversion duties for Manx TT were handed to a little-known Australian team called Tantalus.

Look out 32-bit owners, micro mayhem is about to breakout! ORIGIN Micro Machines Micro Machines he Micro Machines phenomenon continues. While SNES and Mega Drive owners have been sampling this series' delights for years, 32-bit players have been left out in the cold. All that's about to change, with the best Micro Machines game yet! Offering more than 40 courses, 32 different vehicles and loads of new features, plus the biggie this time it's in 3D. Micro Machines V3 is about to arrive in style. Let's roll out the red carpet, and welcome the new era! SCALE ATURES * ENTER THE THIRD DIMENSION ALL YOUR FAVOURITE DRIVERS The big new feature of MMV3 is that for the first time, Micro Machines is in 3D. The perspective has changed from the classic birds-eye view, and now the proceedings are seen from a virtual chase camera. Occasionally the view pans around the course and vehicles, which offers dramatic views of the events. All this is more than fancy trimmings on the cake, as the third dimension offers new tactics and opportunities. There are eight drivers you can choose to race as: Spider the Fonzalike who is too cool for words; Chen the Tom Guise-alike; Jade with her slightly punk green hairdo; Bonnie who squeals a lot; Dwayne the surfer dude with a face like Kirk Douglas; Jethro the reggae lovin' driver; Walter the large guy, and Cherry the sassy blonde. Each driver has been motion-captured, modelled and animated. For the first time, the characters have the ability to speak! MICRO MACHINES THE NEXT GENERATION case O 13 1 DE CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY Each character has their own unique sayings. At the start of the race Jethro says \"Let's race 'dem cars\" This is the first thing you see when starting the game the options screen. \"So what? It's just an option screen\", you might say. True, but not many games have an options screen as wonderful as this. Guide your car through the different modes of play by entering garages, or passing checkpoints. As you pass through the gates you're selecting different options. The cutesy graphics include little people waving at your car, and a dog wagging his tail. Options screens don't get any better! ONLY ONE PREVIOUS OWNER * TATRAY Moving the D-pad left and right opens the different garage doors. Once you've selected your garage, just accelerate right on through. MMV3 features 32 different types of vehicles to race in, each with different attributes. Every type of vehicle you can think of is included, from speedy F1 racers to equally fast ice cream | vans! Some of your old favourites have even gone through a revamp tanks can still fire at the opponents, but instead of a straightahead shot the shells are now lobbed. The shells can also bounce off objects scattered around the course. Like in previous incarnations, not all the vehicles are wheel based. Let's race 'dem hovercraft! 0.0 603 Me Shells from the tank can bounce off these glasses to hit the opponents behind you! All the vehicles can jump. When racing speedboats, jumping makes them go faster. 38 "


"INTRODUCING POWER UPS! computer video games de do There are so many exciting new features in MMV3, but probably the most important is the introduction of weapons. Rather than detract from the pure playability of the series, the power-ups add greatly to the fun. They appear as packaged gift boxes which are littered around the course. Simply driving over a box adds the power-up to your vehicle. Force-fields, fireballs. a giant hammer, missiles and even a claw that grabs opponents are on offer.

In fact, if we were to review the game again, it would almost certainly get a High Five rating this time around, as the game improves immensely with more play. Finally, the PlayStation version is taking shape, with slight changes and some new graphical effects to improve the game. It's entirely possible that this could turn out to be the best 3D action game on the PlayStation. Exhumed EXHUMED IT'S BETTER THAN DOOM! RI ARCHITECTURE Players of the Saturn version of Exhumed will be able to tell from the screenshots that some sections of the game are slightly different from their copy. A few levels have new sections to them, and other rooms have been redesigned so that they are almost unrecognisable. There are also some slight changes to the front end, with a different start and a new loading screen! Wow. IGHIS OUT! The lighting effects in Exhumed are excellent, with coloured flares lighting up the walls whenever certain enemies launch attacks, and whenever big explosions go off. They're slightly different to those on the Saturn game, and are a bit more subtle. The outside of the Karnak Sanctuary looks totally different to the Saturn version. GO FOR 1 PADDLE Exhumed lets players swim in some levels, unlike the other \"Doom games\" on consoles so far. In fact, it's got something over Quake in that players can see into the water before jumping in! You can also swim around and look out through the surface to see enemies around you, just like Turok. KARNAK SANCTUARY The new loading screen gives you something to look at, other than just a red bar. The bubble in the corner shows the air in your magical mask running out. When underwater, you can only use your sword to kill the piranhas! "


"IT'S REALS! computer Video games The Exhumed game engine is very similar to the Duke Nukem 3D's, with smooth 3D areas and sprite enemies to keep the speed up. Because everything is true 3D, you get buildings with one level above another (unlike Doom), and have the ability to look up and down. In fact, Exhumed gives players much more neck movement than most other 3D games, as it's possible to look straight up above! PlayStation FIND THE MAGICAL SANDALS OF KUPTET! The thing that makes Exhumed play so differently from Doom is that it isn't just a basic load of levels to play through. You start off by talking to the Pharaoh Ramses, who tells you where you should travel next. You then move around on the map screen to whichever level you need, finding different exits to gain access to other sections of the game. Ramses is always available to give you assistance in finding the six magical artifacts spread around the levels. SANDALS OF EMPTE LTCREASES FUTOPING ABILITY Everything you collect during the game is added to this inventory screen. RAK INDTI Exhumed has an excellent selection of weapons, starting with a sword and standard guns, and ranging through powerful Amun Bombs, eventually ending with some amazing ancient magical weapons and spells. It all sounds great, too! EXHUMED — IT'S BETTER THAN DOOM! Most levels have more than one exit, some of which can only be reached using hidden artifacts. CONSTRUCT A RADIO! As well as the six artifacts which improve your abilities sandals to jump higher, mask to breathe underwater, etc you also need to search around to find the hidden pieces of your radio transmitter and, if you're really up for a challenge, the team dolls! These are possibly the most hidden of all secret items in a video game ever, requiring a very keen eye, all the magical artifacts, excellent control over your character, and lots of patience! Every enemy explodes in a shower of guts, no matter which weapon you use! The explosion in the background was set off by shooting a collection of big skull pots. The transmitter pieces may be wellhidden, but they beep when you get near! You need to find all the pieces of the transmitter to finish the game properly. Explosives are often set up by weak walls, letting you blow your way through to new sections. Just don't stand too close. The Amun Bombs are perfect for finding secret passageways. Just throw a bomb at any textures which look out of place. TRAVEL ON THE CAMEL NEXT MONTH... RAMSES SAYS... At the moment, this PAL version of Exhumed is a bit slower and jerkier than the Saturn PAL game was, but there may still be some optimising to do.

E11 ZETI rying to better one of the most famous games of all time isn't easy. Whenever something like Tenka comes along it is, rightly or wrongly, compared to id's classic. Psygnosis' attempt is the latest in a long line of such games, hoping to gain the same success. First impressions suggest that it looks like a cross between Disruptor and Alien Trilogy. The dark, dingy corridors of Trilogy mixed with graphical and gameplay feel of Interplay's title are what best sums this game up. But both of the latter The alien bug thing titles fell short of matching Doom for hasn't seen you yet. gameplay, so it's here where Psygnosis are hoping they've got it right. INSERT KOLO -CUBE DATA Destroying these generators is vital. If any enemies get this close, panic! I wonder what you have to put in here? I CAN SEE YOU PLAYSTATION DOOM CLONE FROM PSYGNOSIS As well as the Object Detection Light mentioned elsewhere on this page, there is a fair amount of other information displayed on screen. All of it is useful, which means you don't get any unwanted stats cluttering up the screen. 12 The target for locking onto opponents appears in two stages. It's completely green, when an enemy is in range and two red bars appear when locked on. The coloured strips on the left show which keys are currently in your possession. Your gun not only shows the current number of bullets, but the flashing lights indicate the number of clips left before you run out. When you pick up an add-on or attachment for the gun, a small bit clips onto the side. The double shot is equipped at the moment. Shoot the light When the Predator type enemy crouches beams to make a down, move pretty sharpish, because he fires path to the holo cube. a missile which takes off half your energy. THINGS ARE LOOKING UP   Quake was the first corridor game to utilise this effect, and Tenka has followed suit by making the L shoulder buttons alter the view up and down. Whereas Quake was set through multi story levels, and you needed to be able to look over ledges, Tenka is set on one floor which only has small rises and dips. This only really proves useful when you have genetic mutations biting at your feet, and you need to be able to look down to see them though. Looking down into the pit reveals enemies and bonuses... The blue bar indicates the amount of shield energy you have. Once that is down, you can only take a couple more hits before you die. Your Radar is in the centre of this circle which is detects any enemies or objects that are in your immediate vicinity. The second circle shows your health (the red bar) and your heartbeat. When the pulse in the centre flashes quickly, it means Tenka is out of breath, so running isn't as effective. The Object Detection Light is also shown in this circle. 42 ...one of which is this little fella! One quick burst of fire... ...and the coast is clear. Collect the pickups as a reward. "


"BOOM computer video games BOOM: WARNING! MUST EVACUATE! PlayStation Once all of the desired tasks have been completed for a stage all of the keys found, or all enemies killed then the EVAC message flashes on screen which is your key to get the hell out! The door which leads to the end of the level is now open but that doesn't necessarily mean you've done it. There may be four or five more rooms after that, so don't rest yet! By shooting the legs of the aliens, they cannot move anywhere, and run round in circles! GUNNING FOR GLORY Believe it or not, this thing has its back to you, so cap it...NOW! GET ON YOUR KNEES AND BEG! In keeping with traditional corridor games, you only start with a small single shot gun, but the further you progress, the more lavish the weaponry becomes. To keep a tab on what you're carrying, simply hold R1 and the inventory appears at the top of the screen. It shows all guns and grenades, but also items like holo cubes that you can utilise. PLAYSTATION DOOM CLONE FROM PSYGNOSIS Killing certain enemies will unveil items. This guy left behind the red key, which will come in rather handy! Your character isn't only restricted to running about shooting enemies. Certain sections of the game require you to crawl through ventilation shafts in order to reach valuable items. Finding these passageways isn't always easy though as they are covered by grates which need to be shot away. When you do locate one, hitting the circle button causes Tenka to lay down, ready to squeeze through. Speed is severely hampered in this position however, meaning it's a good idea to kill all enemies close by beforehand. THE LITLE RED DOT S A Get past the first couple of levels and the game sets you more tasks to complete than previously. So collecting keys isn't the only thing to do here. Level four sees you having to locate holo cubes and return them to the computer panels that have been sabotaged. But how do you know where to put them? Well, a small red dot to the right of your pulse rate indicator begins to flash when you're holding an item and it needs to be positioned in a certain area. And this dot is called the ODL, or the Object Detection Light. The green box around this monster means he's targeted. Get two red bars as well, and he's locked on. NEXT MONTH TENKA YOU VERY MUCH! RELEASED If you fancy seeing if Tenka can equal or even better Doom, buy CVG next month for a full review. If you don't, buy the mag anyway, but skip those pages when you get it! 43 "

And Zool lets you play as an ninja ant in a Chupa Chups world. Veteran gamers will remember Elite, the old computer game that let you fly around a massive galaxy, trading, pirating or bounty hunting to earn your keep. It was like being the owner of the Millennium Falcon and was brilliant. There's been nothing to match it since (the sequel, Frontier, was too fiddly and buggy). Hardwar from Gremlin however, looks like it may come close. The concept? Elite on a chaotic planet... with much more besides! HOMcJoH LNO3dIM HIIM GASSON) 11/17 SUI NOUS ENINUJ ENTER...THE BJDLOUDS! The game is set on an alien world, in the City of Misplaced Optimism. All sounds a bit dismal, and indeed it is. As a citizen of this planet you have to make a living any way you can. And that's where the Elite similarities come in. You start with a basic ship to traverse the landscape. How you use this craft to make your money is entirely up to you.

There are loads of add-ons to buy extra weapons, scanners, shields and five types of ship to save up for. Earning all these is enough of a game in itself. But if you want, there's a plot too. This takes place through 40 different missions. What order they come in is random, but do them all and you discover the final goal the secret of interplanetary travel. Your chance to escape the gloomy planet. A selection of pictures giving you a feel of the game, from the gloomy atmosphere to the towering city.

"computer Video games THE JOB CENTRE The missions take the form of Blade Runner. You get to meet all jobs, from simple salvage operakinds of dodgy characters mutattions (for little pay) to more crimi ed fallout victims through to gornal activities (big moolah). These geous ladies.

SO ROM DRVO, TIESIEN SHIELD ON STRUCTE GAPIASES SARS se We wanted to show you some of the characters, but those bits aren't in the game yet. So here's a docking picture. YOU ARE NOT ALONE! CANT PLEASE ETERYOTIE! The biggest distinction between Elite and Hardwar, is that the latter requires a lot more dealing with people. In fact, playing different factions off against each other is a primary part of the game. There are three different 'groups' in Hardwar the police and two gangs. Using a system called Favour Banks, you have to wheel and deal with the different groups. Say one gang asks you to assassinate a member of another gang accepting the mission gains you 'favour points' with one group, but you lose points from your account with the other. And should you ask that now-unfriendly gang for help, they'll tell you where to go! Likewise, if you commit a crime and get caught, the police threaten to prosecute you unless you pay a bribe. Essential in any new PC release is a networking feature. Hardwar lets up to 16-players enter a realtime universe, battling against each other. Gremlin assure us that up to ten ships can appear on screen at any one time without any slowdown. A good thing too since, although the screenshots don't show it, the city is teeming with other craft.Expect plenty of multiplayer dogfights! I HARDWar. IT'S ELITE CROSSED WITH WIPEOUT! COMING SOON COOL WORDS AND PICTURES! Following the success of WipEout, Gremlin have also employed the Designers Republic to do the artwork and in-game logos for them. Also, a contract is about to be signed with Warp records. LFO are said to be doing a new track specially for the game, as well as sound effects. Ten other tracks from the likes of Autechre and Black Dog are also set to be included. What's more, while playing you can tune into an in-game radio station called Hardwarp, which plays these tunes inbetween giving hints and tips for missions! Oooh, it looks like his letting of a little shot there. Obviously some kind of fracas. No Designers Republic logos on the in-game screens. Not yet anyway! NEXT MONTH... TIME TO GET HARD! Hardwar has been a long time in development, but its clearly got a lot to offer. Excellent graphics, cool presentation, wicked tunes, and most of all, in-depth gameplay mean we could potentially be looking at one of this year's gaming highlights! It's clear the city has been heavily based on the architecture of Blade Runner. Look at that! 45 "

You're like a soldier of fortune, and not content with sticking to the original missions, there's more fun to be had namely destroying everything in sight! Buildings crumble, forests are engulfed in flames and villages are pillaged. Sounds charming doesn't it? Remember this isn't called Mass Destruction for nothing! BRING 'EM ALLON DOOR DESTRUCTIONIST MASSIVE !!! The main objective of each level is to destroy the enemy forces. Each stage contains several main missions, as well as hidden bonus targets. What is not totally apparent to begin with is the scoring system. Later you learn there are massive points to be scored for completing the tasks in differing order. Plus the variety of ways to destroy the enemy also affects the points. Fast completion of certain tasks adds extra bonus points. Essentially Mass Destruction is a Score attack game! This increases the strategy level immensely, as well as adding to the longevity. If you're going to get serious about this job, you'll be needing an instrument to aid you in the destruction.

"computer video games DESTROYING BUILDINGS Songs with the Save the clock tower? NO WAY! yu 10000303 EEE SATURN What you really want to know about is destroying the buildings, right? By far the most appealing part of the game. Rather than a novelty, making rubble is an integral part of the game. As mentioned before, successful demolition adds greatly to your score. The crumbled ruins also contain vital power-ups and weapon bonuses. Remember, the bigger the building the bigger the explosion! OSOD 2329 Cons234 0137 One of our favourite levels, because it really shows off the fiery explosions! WANT SOME OF THIS?!! 10000303 VOCE 0120 That's one big radar. Shouldn't be a problem hitting it then! When it comes to weapons, you're like a mobile munitions factory, decked out in all manor of goodies. Be careful with the consumption of these arms, as they are by no means infinite. Of course more stocks can be located, hidden around the levels. Rather than just stick to standard shells which you would normally associate with tanks, there's a variety of weapons to play with. At the top of the most-useful list has to be the heat-seeking missiles, big, powerful and very useful for getting rid of the larger opponents quickly. Mortars are effective when fired into enclosed spaces. Fire them over fortress walls to cause real damage! The Vortex is a powerful explosion, with your tank at the epicentre of the hurricane, engulfing everything in the near vicinity. Winning the award for most gratuitous, is the flame-thrower. Use it against the ground-troops. You'll never look at a barbecue in quite the same way! DECO DESTRUCTIONIST MASSIVE !!! Wow. Look at the flames reflected in the river. Neato! Ground troops can be run over or chargrilled. Tasty! 050010 YEAH MAAAN! AS SOON AS PAINT ME TANK JAH COLOUR. The Vortex engulfs anything stupid enough to get too close. See that garage, it's not gonna be there in a second! CVG bids farewell to Priory Court. Sniff.... I HATE THOSE GUYS! Enemy units are much as you'd expect. Ground troops, tanks, jeeps, helicopters and gun emplacements. All have different armour ratings and behave in different ways. All mobile units contain troops. When the vehicle is destroyed, the enemy crawl out. Sometimes amidst the explosions, these stray troopers can cause some problems. The Al for your foe is quite high, standard foot soldiers search for abandoned vehicles, becoming a bigger threat. Also you can be attacked in flanks and waves rather than by single opponents.

"computer Video games 120 YEARS OF STAR WARS 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS NIVE) Come March 21st, the CVG boys are going to be reliving their youth, joining the new-born devotees as Star Wars: The Special Edition hits the cinemas. To celebrate this renaissance we're paying tribute to the greatest sci-fi story ever told, and over the next few pages, investigating its legacy to video games. 52 "


"computer Video games n some parallel universe, George Lucas never made Star Wars, and they're still playing video games based on Noughts and Crosses. You might never have stopped to consider this, but just imagine what it would have meant for gamers if Star Wars had never appeared. When the first movie in the series was released in late 1977 its blend of mythical story-telling, thrilling space battles and dazzling special effects single-handedly revived the world's interest in science fiction, a genre which had become high-brow and preachy since the glory days of the 1950s. The cinemas were suddenly full of Star Wars imitations and with the public gagging for more laser action it was the perfect time for Taito to release their new Space Invaders coinops. The machines sprang up all over the globe and it was this one game that effectively jump-started the whole video games business. From then on, flying spaceships and blasting aliens became the staple diet for gamers worldwide. SHOOTING STAR WARS Producing a generation of laser-junkies probEventually 20th Century Fox bosses, who ably wasn't foremost on George Lucas' had been impressed by American Graffiti, mind when he started work on Star Wars gave Lucas the go-ahead to make the movie early in 1975. Having achieved only cult and coughed up $11.5 million to pay for it. success with two of his previous movies, THX-1138 and American Graffiti, it seems unlikely that he had any inkling of the eventual impact of Star Wars at the time. His original plan was for a modern remake of the old Flash Gordon serials that he had enjoyed as a boy, but when he discovered that the licence-holders wanted more money and more artistic control than he was willing to hand over, he decided to create his own space adventure. Armed with a script entitled The Legend of the Starkiller Chapter One: The Star Wars, he began touting his idea around the major Hollywood studios Together again: Mark Hamill, Carrie only to be repeatedly turned down. Fisher and Harrison Ford.  1997 LUCASFILM LTD A NEW HOPE * THE SPECIAL EDITIONS O Some of the updated scenes from Star Wars: The Special Edition: computer-generated Dewbacks, a bigger Mos Eisley, the restored Jabba scene and an awesome Death Star battle. 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS Though the script underwent several rewrites, Lucas held on to the concept of an epic saga, which he originally called The Legend of the Whills, to be told in three trilogies. The first movie would actually be the kick-off episode of the second trilogy hence its full title, Star Wars Part IV: A New Hope with parts five and six to follow. By the time Return of the Jedi was released in 1983, the Star Wars marketing machine was in full production, keeping fans satisfied with an endless array of comic books, novels and toys. But it looked like plans for any further movies had been shelved. Instead, Lucas had become sidetracked by his massively successful production company, Lucasfilm, and he moved back behind the camera only occasionally, helping his friend Steven Spielberg with the Indiana Jones trilogy, as well as putting his name to less successful pieces such as Willow, Return to Oz, Labyrinth and the lamentable Howard the Duck. II A few years ago, though, the rumour began to spread that the next Star Wars trilogy was finally going into production, with the very first episode, The Clone Wars, set to appear in 1997. Of course, this has turned out not to be the case (filming on the next movie is due to start later this year for a release in 1999) but to keep the interest going Lucas has produced new versions of the original three movies which are being released back to back during March and April. Many of the scenes cut from the final prints of the movies have been restored in the new editions. The Star Wars Special Edition, for example, includes a scene which takes place in the Mos Eisley docking bay, where Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt discuss Solo's debt to Jabba. This scene was filmed for the original release of the movie, only back then Jabba was a slobbish human dressed in furs and sporting an Irish accent. Now, thanks to digital editing and computer graphic techniques, the original footage of Harrison Ford has been incorporated into a reworked scene in which Han discusses his problem with the same sluglike gangster seen in Return of the Jedi while bounty hunter Boba Fett looks on. Lucasfilms' special effects division, Industrial Light and Magic, have worked hard on many of the new scenes, replacing many of the model and matte shots from the original movies with state-of-the-art computer-generated imagery. Expect breath-taking battle scenes and whole new flight sequences in all three films! With the whole Star Wars craze again reaching fever pitch, the success of the Special Editions is assured. When the first of the new movies was released in the USA on January 31st it grossed $36 million in box office takings over the first weekend. You can see what all the excitement's about for yourself when they're released in the UK on March 21 (Star Wars), April 11 (Empire Strikes Back) and April 25 (Return of the Jedi). We'll be there on opening night and we'd advise you to be there too! FEATURE Out with the old (top) and in with the new (bottom). Can you spot the difference? 53 "


"Computer video games STAR WARS: THE VIDEO GAMES LEGACY Plenty of action movies have spawned the game-of-the-film, but since 1982 the world's enthusiasm for the Star Wars cinemas in 1977 it started a \" movies has resulted in over 30 different Star Wars games appearing in arcades, on home computers and consoles! hen Star Wars first appeared in cinemas in 1977 it started a craze for merchandising the like of which had never been seen before. Pretty soon the shelves were packed with Star Wars toys, lunchboxes, posters, books and Princess Leia shampoo. There were all kinds of things available in some kind of Star Wars form... Except video games, that is. Even though Star Wars probably opened the door for alien-blasting arcade games when it was released in 1977, it was five years later before the first game of the movie appeared. With Star Wars games... ... The Force... ... Can be with YOU! A LONG TIME AGO... STAR WARS ARCADE BRINGING THE MAGIC HOME 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS THE VIDEO GAMES LEGACY In 1982 the American toy manufacturer Parker Brothers released two Star Wars cartridges for the Atari 2600 VCS console. The first was The Empire Strikes Back, a sideways-scrolling shoot-'em-up which pitted a lone snowspeeder pilot against an advancing battalion of Imperial Walkers. It was a simple game but entertaining which was more than could be said for Star Wars: Jedi Arena. This game showed a bird's-eye-view of two Jedi Knights, facing off against each other with their light sabres. It was hard to control and lacked the Star Wars atmosphere of the Empire Strikes Back game so it wasn't a major hit. The Atari games reappeared three years later as home computer conversions. Domark had bought the licence to all three games and released a trio of competent conversions, first on the new 16-bit Atari ST and Commodore Amiga, and later on the old Sinclair Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC machines. Atari's Star Wars coin-op, released in September 1983, was a 3-D shoot-'em-up based on the Death Star battle. First players would fight squadrons of TIE Fighters (including Darth Vader's!), then skim the surface of the Death Star, blasting turbo-laser turrets before heading down the famous trench. In March of 1984 Atari released an upgrade pack that turned Star Wars machines into Empire Strikes Back machines. This gave the player the chance to blast AT-ATs and Probe Droids on Hoth, then dogfight TIE Fighters and dodge asteroids in space. STER By 1988, George Lucas' LucasFilm had set up its own games software division, but they were steering clear of creating Star Wars games. The nearest they came was in 1991, with Night Shift, a puzzle game (programmed by a British team, The Assembly Line), in which you played a character who worked in a Star Wars toy factory! The Spectacular Centralen Game EMPIRE Determined to get some more mileage out of their license Parker released two more Star Wars VCS games to coincide with the release of the latest movie, Return of the Jedi. Death Star Battle was a ridiculous reenactment of the effects-laden climax to ROTJ. The player controlled the Millennium Falcon as it first dodged or blasted waves of TIE Fighters, then had to blast through a deflector shield to destroy the Death Star. The other cartridge was a simplified conversion of Atari's new Star Wars coin-op. Unfortunately for both games, they were released shortly before the whole VCS market collapsed and never made it to a European release. Parker had also planned a VCS game based on The Ewok Adventure, a TV movie that appeared in 1984, but although a prototype cartridge was produced the finished game never saw the light of day. Perhaps that's just as well. By the summer Atari had completed the trilogy with a Return of the Jedi coin-op. This was a disappointment, though, probably because Atari used an isometric perspective instead of 3-D vector graphics to portray its three scenes the speeder bike chase, the battle on Endor and the Millennium Falcon's flight into the Death Star. Christmas of 1991 saw the release of the first NEW, REAL Star Wars game, on the Nintendo Entertainment System. JVC's NES Star Wars was an action-packed blend of platform game and shoot-'em-up which followed the plot of the first movie and featured all of the characters. Not surprisingly, it was followed by The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, similar games which made good use of their movie roots. All three games also appeared on the new Super NES, complete with spectacularly upgraded graphics, 3-D blasting levels and belting musical scores. Perhaps Sega were learning from Atari's mistakes when they picked up the Star Wars coinop licence over ten years later. The game they produced was a 3-D vector graphics game that could almost be regarded as an evolution of the original Atari Star Wars game concept. Jedi Arena, Death Star Battle and Star Wars Arcade on the Atari VCS. Hot stuff in their day, but nowadays... Oogh! The original and best. Atari's Star Wars coin-op, circa 1983 54 "

Like X-Wing it was followed by a set of proved so popular that shortly after the game mission disks, Defender of the Empire, which was released LucasArts brought out two extra expanded the plot and added extra ships to mission disks, the second of which added the fly, including the practically unstoppable TIE B-Wing fighter to the Rebel fleet. Defender (never seen in the movies). LucasArts' fantastic X-Wing set new standards for space combat simulations... Unlike the first game, RA II placed real actors among the computer-generated scenes. ... And the awesome TIE Fighter pushed the standard even higher. Expect the soon-to-be-released X-Wing vs TIE Fighter to be even better! Oh my! By this time players were growing weary of full-motion video CD-ROM titles, though. Doom was the public's favourite but while other companies were knocking out inadequate clones LucasArts set a new technical standard with the awesome Dark Forces. This had a more advanced 3-D graphics engine than Doom's and used familiar characters and scenery to create an entirely immersive Star Wars combat experience. 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS THE VIDEO GAMES LEGACY Exciting though these games were, LucasArts' 1993 release, Rebel Assault, was an even more interesting release. It was a 3-D shoot-'em-up made notable because it was one of the first games to use the new CDROM format. Though it wasn't a great game, Rebel Assault's digitised graphics and variety of missions were a spectacular demonstration of the power of CD-ROM, and many PC owners spent + on a CD-ROM upgrade PILOTS ON SCORE 010420 for their machines on the strength of this one game.

Now for a follow-up, how about 'Quake+Star Wars'? Nice. laster rifles, thermal detonators, stormtroopers, dianogas, mouse robots, guest appearances by Boba Fett and Jabba the Hutt... The LucasArts team who put Dark Forces together didn't miss a trick when it came to making the ultimate 3D shoot-'em-up set in the Star Wars galaxy. But no matter how good you make something people always want it to be better. \"Where's the multiplayer mode?\" they cried. «Why can't I have a light sabre to play with? I want chocolate ice cream!» Well, if you were a member of that disgruntled rabble you can just shut your yap right now because the Dark Forces II designers have given in to two of your demands. Network play and light sabres are both included in their sequel, along with a host of other new features. However you still have to buy your own ice cream. JEDI KNIGHT: DARK FORCES II LOOK AT THE SIZE (AND SHAPE) OF THAT THING! 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS JEDI KNIGHT: DARK FORCES II LucasArts have moved away from the '2.5D graphic style of Dark Forces, with its polygon scenery and sprite objects, and have made Dark Forces Il a fully threedimensional game. The multi-level mazes that make up the game are all constructed from light-source-shaded, texture-mapped vector graphics and as in Quake, all the creatures that inhabit Dark Forces II are made up of texture-mapped 3D models. Authentic though the first game looked, Dark Forces II promises to capture even more of the atmosphere of the movies! QUITE A MERCENARY A scout walker looms over Katarn as he explores a hangar bay. Notice the smooth lightsourced shading on the walls. THE WEAPON OF A JEDI Dark Forces ll sees the return of soldier of fortune Kyle Katarn. After successfully destroying the Empire's Dark Trooper program he has discovered that he is strong with The Force and has begun to learn how to use it. During the course of his training Katarn becomes aware of a plot by seven Dark Jedi to find a hidden Jedi burial ground and decides to intervene before they can use its power to conquer the galaxy. Now a novice Jedi Knight himself, Katarn must search the galaxy for the seven Dark Jedi and destroy them using the mystical powers that he is still struggling to master. A starcruiser docked at a space station. Could that be Dash Rendar's Corellian freighter sitting on the landing pad at the bottom right? The weapons line-up hasn't changed drastically since the original game. Kyle starts off with his trusty, scabby Bryar pistol, and can work his way up to Stormtrooper rifles and the Imperial repeater (the rapid-fire Dark Trooper weapon he picked up in the previous game). There are also thermal detonators and IM mines, as well as a new turret gun. The other new weapon of course, is the light sabre. It seems this was included to satisfy popular demand, though the usefulness of such a short-range weapon when you're surrounded by blaster-toting aliens remains to be seen. As Kyle practises his Jedi powers during the course of the game, the strength of The Force grows within him. By collecting experience points he can focus on learning skills such as the abilities to leap great distances, to heal himself, to see through walls and to retrieve distant objects. As his power grows, though, Kyle is tempted by the dark side of The Force and should you choose to turn him towards evil the course of the game is altered dramatically. $ JOIN US OR DIE! The same starcruiser hovers over Imperial City on Coruscant. Another cool cut-scene. FEATURE The lack of a network game was one of the few flaws in the original Dark Forces. LucasArts are rectifying that ommission in Dark Forces Il by incorporating three different multiplayer game modes. Two-player games are supported over serial connections, such as a null-modem cable or direct modem link, while an IPX network option can handle up to eight players simultaneously. An Internet-powered game also seems likely but LucasArts haven't confirmed that yet. Once connected you can take part in three different game variations. Total Combat is a simple free-for-all, while Team Combat lets you join forces with other players for pitched battles. Territory Combat is similar but has a 'Capture the Flag' theme, so you have to work with your team to seize control of the opposition's base. Kyle's quest takes him to all sorts of exotic locations around the galaxy. The scene-setting is done in cut-scenes like this one that shows an ancient temple. Katarn is still flying 'The Mouldy Crow', though it looks a bit better than it used to, thanks to SVGA graphics.. 56 "

Now you really ARE the master! Of Good AND/OR Evil! 0 MASSING THE FLEET STARI REBELLION Rebellion's galaxy is comprised of between 100 and 200 planetary systems (depending on how long you want the game to be) and your opponent's forces could be occupying any number of them. Because you need raw materials to build your fleet, it's important to form allegiances with as many different planets as possible, using either force or diplomacy. Diplomacy is more tricky, but force may only work in the short-term, eventually causing resentment that leads to defection. Rebel forces are approaching Coruscant time to call in a few more Star Destroyers. f you were around to see the first screenings of Star Wars nearly 20 years ago, chances are you'll be knocking on a bit. No doubt the idea of dashing around the galaxy in a starfighter, blasting enemy ships into phosphorescing dust all seems a bit too energetic these days. There's no shame in it. Even old Obi-Wan admitted that he was getting too old for that kind of thing. So, for the more senior, serious-minded SW fan, LucasArts are putting together a strategy game called Star Wars: Rebellion, which pits the gargantuan might of the Imperial fleet against the under-resourced Alliance forces and lets you command whichever side you like! Having acquired some resources you allocate them to projects such as building Star Destroyers or training pilots. At certain points during the game you can develop new and more powerful technology which costs more but could prove crucial in the struggle that lies ahead. When you're satisfied with the size of your force you can start deploying ships, troops and agents around the galaxy in the hunt for your enemies. 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS JEDI KNIGHT: DARK FORCES II Q 33 SOME DAMN FOOL CRUSADE The KDV v 150 is a planet based on Canon used to free ships which are bombarding the planet on which the KDY IS deployed.

A hardware encyclopedia lets you read up on all the defensive technology available. In terms of Star Wars chronology, Rebellion takes place between the first two movies, just after the destruction of the first Death Star and just prior to the establishment of the Rebel Alliance base on Hoth. While the Alliance is relishing its victory and using it to recruit new races and systems to the cause, the Emperor is regrouping his forces, determined to make the Rebels pay for this latest outrage as soon as he finds them. The Empire has the legs on the Alliance in terms of sheer might, but the Rebels can move quickly. launching hit-and-fade strikes from secret bases all over the galaxy. RED FIVE, STANDING BY * A BATTLE LONG COMING IS JOINED... When one of your units arrives in the same system as an enemy ship, battle is automatically joined. The action switches to a 3-D realtime battle sequence in which you take control of the ships under your command. Sounds quite thrilling, but don't go expecting a mini version of X-Wing. This bit's more about issuing movement orders to squadrons and capital ships and assigning specific targets to your pilots and their wingmen. Your overall objectives in Rebellion depend on which side you're playing as. If you're in command of the Alliance your mission is to capture the Emperor, Darth Vader and overthrow the Imperial throne situated in Imperial City on the planet Coruscant.

LucasArts are considering implementing an Internetbased network game, but there are command and no firm plans Conquer in space? It's as yet. an awesome prospect.

X-Wing vs TIE Fighter uses a similar mission-based game structure as its predecessors, with campaigns being fought over the course of a series of battles. There will be 50 new missions, a varied assortment of convoy escort, reconnaissance, space dogfights and full-scale assaults which will be split into Imperial and Rebel campaigns. During the course of these missions you're given the controls of nine distinctly different starfighters. If you've chosen to play on the side of the Alliance you get to fly the A-Wing, B-Wing, X-Wing and Y-Wing. while Imperial pilots get the TIE fighter, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber and TIE Advanced. There may also be some TIE Defenders in the game too, but as they outclass just about anything the Rebels have and would give the Empire a huge advantage in network games, the designers may well have left them out.

MARCHING INTO THE DETENTION LEVEL Much of Shadows of the Empire is played like a 3D Doom-style game, with Dash exploring huge enemy bases and the interiors of starships, leaping around platforms, jetpacking over vast gorges, and of course, blasting any foes that cross his path. These bits have the usual simple door-opening puzzles, so watch out for hidden levers and buttons that help you progress, and keep an eye open for extra ammo. You'll need it when you have to go head-to-head against a bunch of angry Wampa ice creatures or an Imperial scout walker! The 3D environment in the exploration sections is impressive, but the action really takes off when you take the controls in one of SOTE's ship combat stages. The first is a superb recreation of the Battle of Hoth from The Empire Strikes Back, in which you get to fly a Rebel snowspeeder against an advancing army of Imperial Probe Droids, Scout Walkers and AT-ATs, blasting them to bits or lassooing the legs of the AT-ATs until they tumble to the ground. When Dash lands on the planet Tatooine he has to chase after a gang of criminals astride a Swoop (a kind of speeder bike), smashing them from their own mounts as he speeds through the streets of Mos Eisley Spaceport, then on into the famous Beggar's Canyon. Health Laser 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE An AT-ST guards the exit from Echo base on Hoth. Shoot it in the head! Most impressive of all though, are the space battles. These place you either in the cockpit or the gun turret of Rendar's ship, The Outrider, and you have to blast your way past squadrons of TIE Fighters, TIE Bombers and other enemy ships. The game saves the most impressive battle to the end, though a full-on space station assault reminiscent of the attack on the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi, only this time you're right there in the thick of it! 84% Health SEL Dash jet-packs it over the gorges of Gall Spaceport. 100% 35 Health 70 Laser Riding a runaway train through a junkyard on Ord Mantell.

After getting his fingers burned with that first Death Star, he's got his scientists working on a new weapon, an almost unstoppable droid soldier called the Dark Trooper with which he intends to wipe out the Rebels once and for all. Little does he know that the Alliance has already got wind of the Dark Trooper project and has hired Kyle Katarn, an Empire-loathing mercenary, to help them discover its secrets and eventually destroy it! FORCES WARS. FORCES OF DARKNESS As well as having to deal with all sorts of Imperial operatives, Katarn is confronted by several other adversaries that Star Wars fans might recognise. DOOM MEETS STAR WARS... 20 YEARS OF STAR WARS DARK FORCES ... That's the most appropriate description for Dark Forces. It's a combination of shoot-'em-up action, exploration, and puzzle-solving set in 14 huge, three-dimensional levels. The big difference is that the game is set in the Star Wars universe, so the enemies you come across are all familiar characters, and the levels are all done out to look like the cantinas, hangars, starships and Imperial bases you see in the movies. The designers have even made Dark Forces sound like the movies, with authentic sound effects and even remixes of the original film music on the soundtrack. How can any Star Wars fan resist?

"SET BLASTERS ON FULL! computer video games BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED GOGGLE Katarn starts the game armed only with his fists and his crappy Bryar pistol, but it's not long before he acquires a collection of more advanced weapons, including various exotic guns and some neatly-packed explosives. Some of the ten different weapons can be used in two ways by holding down the weapon modifier button. For example, the thermal detonators are normally set to explode on impact, but they can also be put on a three-second fuse so you can bounce one around a corner and eliminate enemies before they spot you! PlayStation As well as his weapons, Kyle can pick up all sorts of other equipment as he progresses. A headlight lets you see in dimly-lit tunnels, but the stealth-conscious will prefer to use a pair of infra-red goggles which don't alert enemies to Katarn's presence use these sparingly, though, as the batteries eventually run out. If you're raiding an Imperial manufacturing facility remember to put your gas mask on in case of noxious fumes, and in slippery conditions look out for a pair of spiked cleats that stop you from slipping into bottomless ice chasms. LESED Use your headlight and these stormtroopers will spot you straight away. But use the goggles and they won't know what's hit them! GOGGLES OM BED 083 2008 REVIEWER USHEBE. REEBLE. If you've ever wanted to shoot Stormtroopers and those other Imperial guys in their gobs, this is undoubtedly the game for you. Once you've seen games like Quake and Turok these old «2.5D\" corridor games often look old-fashioned, but even though it's effectively two years old Dark Forces can still cut it with the best of them. It's a more sophisticated game than Doom, and for several reasons. For one thing it has a wide variety of proper missions, containing genuinely ingenious puzzles that go beyond the usual pushevery-button-in-sight stuff. The levels are designed in such a way that they're completely believable as Imperial detention centres or alien starships some of the scenery is straight out of the movies, and the designers have put in loads of those Death Star-style bottomless cav, erns that look awesome when you're trying to edge along the top of them. Also, the seemingly simple addition of a jumping control provides Dark Forces with a 3-D platform game element that works really well, providing plenty of seat-of-the-pants thrills when you're trying to leap between massive pistons in a trash compactor. Though there's no gore, the blasting action is easily as exciting as Doom's fans of the films will definitely get off on using Star Wars weapons against Star Wars baddies and the three different Dark Troopers provide the same sort of brown-trousers terror as Doom's Cyberdemons. It's hard to imagine a bet ter combination of Doom and Star Wars, and if you're a fan of either you simply must have this game!

HAN ay back in 1976, George Lucas struck a lucrative deal with 20th Century Fox. In exchange for the worldwide rights to his movie, Lucas would have total control of the film's merchandising. Years later it's easy to see who won on this deal. Back then, no-one could have expected the success merchandising was practically unheard of.

You can turn people into pigs as well! PlayStation irst there was Doom, then Raven games used the engine to create the medieval version Heretic. Before long a greatly improved sequel arrived, Hexen, which added elements of Role Playing Games to the shooting action. You need to help Baratus, Daedolon and Parias defeat the second serpent rider, Korax, and his evil disciples in order to save the world of Hexen! HUBBA HUBBA! Like Exhumed, Hexen doesn't work just like Doom in terms of level structure. After finishing the first level, you reach the first main \"hub\" area which becomes the middle section of the first part of the game. After clearing out the hub itself. you can open the door to the next level, and after completing that, you return to the hub once more. Also, some levels are linked directly by the \"Ethereal Travel\" teleporters which warp you around the game. All of this means that there's a lot more variety to the game, as you can travel backwards to restock whenever you want. A The Mage can launch frost shards at enemies to freeze them solid. After a while they explode! I 744 GREETINGS WORLIL, ARE YOU READY TO DIE?\" CHOOSE YOUR HERO! There are three player character classes from which to choose in Hexen, each with different weapons, attributes, and varying uses for items. You'll probably need to try each one out before you know which suits your style of play best, otherwise just pick whichever one takes your fancy. This is another feature which makes Hexen feel very different to Doom. BE A As you enter the first hub, this evil face appears in the wall to give you a warning! A Parias the Cleric starts with just this spiked mace. Bash the baddies on the head with it! BARATUS THE WARRIOR choose class: The fastest and most powerful character, Baratus is excellent in battle. However, his first two weapons can only be used at close range, and he has almost no use for some of the magical artifacts. faber Speed NOR naGic mnoge Strength Previous menu. Baratus is rubbish at magic. 100 12 REVIEW This teleport will move you either to another level, or back to one of the hubs. Timon's Axe is one of Baratus's better weapons. It even glows with blue energy! To conserve mana, use your bare fists on the enemies. 66 A The rendered intro tells the story of Hexen. "


"DAEDOLON THE I BEHONE. FOTO SWINE! games Daedolon isn't very quick, and can't take much damage, but he's excellent at long range. His starting weapon is a magic wand which fires blue shots at enemies, and he can cast some excellent magic at higher levels. The coolest magic item in Heretic was the Morph Ovum which transformed all the enemies into chickens. In Hexen, there's a new version of this called the Porkelator. which transforms the enemies into Squealing pigs! You then get the chance to gun them all down in one go or, for a bit of sick fun, use your fists! SATU CALL UPON THE DARK SERVANT! IM PlayStation One of the most prized magical items is the small Maulotaur icon. When used, it grows into a full-sized Maulotaur who then becomes your Dark Servant! He'll follow you around for about 30 seconds, attacking any enemies nearby. Unfortunately, he has a pretty bad aim, so stay well out of the way or you could be smashed to pieces! A Ring dat bell, funky boy! This is one of Daedolon's standard weapons! Wow! choose class: speed GOR magic Strength A Ugh. Lots of blood here. Good at magic tricks, but a real wimp overall. ADaedolon's Sapphire Wand is really feeble. A Smashing the stained glass windows often reveals hidden health power-ups. PARIAS THE CLERIC REVIEWER Parias is a balance between the other two characters, with average speed and power, as well as a decent selection of weapons. This combination makes him probably the best character choice for beginners. A Nasty flying enemies. BRING A BOTTLE Dotted around the levels are small green flechettes, which can be collected and used whenever you want. Each character uses the flechettes differently — the Warrior throws them like hand grenades, the Mage uses them as bombs, while the Cleric makes them burst, leaving a cloud of deadly poison gas for anything which gets too close. While PC Heretic was basically Doom with a few enhancements, Hexen really adds a lot to the basic Doom game. Being able to collect and use spells and items, as well as having different character classes turns it into a real adventure, and the way that the levels are structured so that you can move around the entire game at will is excellent. The level design is brilliant too, with some impressive buildings, clever traps, and a good selection of secret areas to find. As far as conversions from the PC go, Saturn Hexen is one of the better ones, while the PlayStation version is considerably slower and jerkier, and the movement and control is different to that of the PC and Saturn versions. Therefore, Saturn owners should consider Hexen for a long-lasting, enjoyable adventure, while those of you with PlayStations avoid it, and get one of the machine's many better games of this style instead. ED LOMAS A Just wave and you can set enemies on fire! choose class: A Throw those bottles! speed strength precious metu RATING Parias is pretty good in every skill area. The Wraithverge is Parias's best weapon. SEATM SATURN A decent conversion of a great 3D action game. It's only bettered on the Saturn by the amazing Exhumed. Thankfully, it's a hundred times better than Doom was. REVIEW RATING SATURNAK OR PLAYSTATIONOK? By comparing the Saturn and PlayStation versions of Doom, you might expect PlayStation Hexen to be a hundred times better than the Saturn version. But you'd be wrong! While, both games look basically the same in screenshots, when it comes to playing them, you'll notice that the PS version is quite a bit slower and it also moves more jerkily than on the Saturn. Also, the character movement isn't as close to the PC original as the Saturn game for some reason. PlayStation A bad conversion of a great 3D action game. Far too jerky and slow to be much fun, this will just get on everyone's nerves until they switch it off.  "

"PSYCHIC ATTACKS Video games NOWHERE TO RUN TO BABY CUBED ARENA LITO All the characters use psychic power to engage in combat with their opponents. All the fighters have a long range projectile as a standard attack, with five psychic power attacks to cause some real damage. There are only two attack buttons heavy and light., with two other buttons used to control guard and dash. Psychic power attacks are inputted by VF and SF style commands single or double taps toward or away followed by a heavy or light attack. Although the characters are 3D the fights play in a 2D fashion. The fighters can move through 360 degrees, but on a single plane. For this reason, Psychic Force feels very reminiscent of Street Fighter. TM Some psychic attacks require several stages to set-up, such as Emilio's Seeker Rays... PlayStation 82 JUSH START SONIA The Psyber Warriors fight inside a cubed arena. Formed by psychic energy, the invisible walls entrap the fighters. All characters have their own stages, the locations are still visible through the walls of the arena (the Kekkai). Just like Fighting Vipers forcing your opponent against a wall causes extra damage. Because these characters float there is no jumping in to begin combos. Whichever way the player pushes on the D-pad is the direction the characters move within the 3D space. Don't worry, when in the Kekkai the characters always remain upright so you don't have to worry about landing on your face!

This may not be the most advanced fighter in terms of graphics, moves and even gameplay but it is enjoyable. The game isn't even too much of a challenge, and the concept and style is even dated. I don't know why I still like it but I do. I like it loads! Perhaps the simplicity is so appealing? Maybe. Eventually it's the playability, This game may take a step backward and away from current fighters perhaps taking the genre up another path. Who knows, that could be a good thing!

From the highs of Die Hard Trilogy, to the lows of ...(insert the name of any hit/big budget action film from the past ten years here). The City of Lost Children is also based on a hit film, being French most of you probably haven't seen it. Those who did were treated to a wickedly inventive dark fairy tale. Being the tale of the young Miette, an orphan who discovers the secrets of the city. The game follows the plot of the film very closely which is not surprising considering that lots of the films crew were involved with the making of the game. So could this be the best ever movie to game conversion? Just read on... PHWOOOAR GORGEOUS The graphics in City of Lost Children are some of the best we've seen in an adventure game. The locations are stunningly realised, rendered, and light-sourced. All characters are motion-captured, with the movement of Miette being especially convincing. All of the graphics are high resolution. Add digitised sound from the films and the result is incredibly faithful to the original film.

Being a point-and-click adventure most of the game revolves around Miette finding objects, then using them in the right place. Most of the puzzles are relatively logical.

Miette's movement is slow-mak ing most tasks rather tedious. While most objects found have to be used precisely in the right location, no room for error. The biggest flaw is the incredibly short playing time. This is the shortest adventure game I've ever seen. Even more annoying is that it ends just as the game is getting interesting. Then remembered the game comes on one CD, and with these graphics there had to be a catch. To really experience the City of Lost Children, go buy the movie instead!

Hence the reason for their old SNES classic Deluxe to have popped up on the release schedule. The reason it became so popular was not due to flash graphics or commentary, but because once you picked it up to play, it didn't go back down again until all the skin from your fingertips had been worn off and bones were poking through.

The keeper will come out to claim the ball from your feet, so hold the dash button and hit shoot and you'll fire the ball into the back of the net, away from his grasp. Edam anyone?

IN AT THE DEEP END 0 9039 CORNER KOOR NOMENO, NO. 12 ENGLAND 1-1 JAPAN KAMING 8:02 ENGLAND'S I can understand why Konami have chosen to release this, but I can't fathom why they would want to release the far superior Pro only two weeks after this one. OK, I'm not exactly a closet SNES lover which is why my affection lies with the 3D tricks from Pro, but if you do still have a yearning for ISS, you'll love this as its a straight conversion. But that also means that the graphics only look SNES worthy, and the animation remains virtually identical too. The commentary is good for a while, but soon becomes rather dull. So take my advice. Skip the rest of this page and move onto ISS Pro. Now that's a proper football game. STEVE PES If you fancy taking on an impossible job, similar to that of Stuart Pearce at Nottingham Forest, or Frank Clark at Man City, then head straight for the scenario option. You have the choice of 12 preset games, where you take over a team that is is in need of a last minute goal, or equaliser. The teams are already set for you, and the time remaining and the whereabouts of the ball are also indicated before unbelievabo 19. ENGLAND con GOAL REVIEW you begin. All you have to do is stick one in the old Onion Bag, and save your team mates! Sung SCORCHIO! Commentary in football games is now something, you expect just as much as there being 22 players kicking a small leather ball about. Deluxe heads for the novelty value in this respect, with William Toffington-Smythe Esq. providing the dulcet tones. Put it this way, Barry Davies and John Motson won't use phrases like \"Scorchio!\" RATING RATING 000 If you want some sort of reminder of how things used to be, back in the days of SNES VS Megadrive, this ISS may please you. Realists should plump for Pro instead. 72 "

REVIEWER The players in some football games obviously have superglue on their feet, because no matter which direction they go in, the ball never goes out of their control.

It looks like a footy game should. Nothing too fancy, and yet enough to fool you into thinking you're there. And coupled with the Al players make intelligent runs off the ball for you it gives a good feel of realism. But it also has that same addictive qualities that Deluxe had, enough play modes to prevent boredom and a perfectly pitched difficulty setting it starts easy but gets considerably harder.

CHA DIABLO lizzard Entertainment have already shown they know their Orc from their elbow in the Warcraft games, but whereas they were mainly strategyled titles Diablo takes more of a questing tack, as in role-playing board games. It starts off with you selecting a character then guiding them into a dungeon full of increasingly malevolent creatures. You're sent on various mini-quests during the game, slaying a cursed king, finding magical armour and so on, but your ultimate goal in Diablo is to confront the Dark One himself! Traditional stuff, obviously, but Blizzard have spritzed up the standard RPG action with some superb presentation and plenty of surprises including an Internet-driven multiplayer game! SIE GEOTECA FOORUM CLOSED DOOR ANON How handy! You can overlay the automap on the main display. CATACOMBS OF THE DAMNED! WARRIORS OF THE WASTELAND! DIABLO Diablo is set in the sleepy village of Tristram which consists of a few houses, a blacksmith's forge, an inn... and a desecrated cathedral whose catacombs lead straight to Hell! Beneath the foundations of the cathedral there is a vast, multi-levelled labyrinth of halls and dungeons each of which is overrun by the servants of Satan in their many diabolical forms. Your main concern is simply finding the exit that leads from one level down to the next, but many of the stages also hide some kind of secret treasure, a weapon perhaps, or a clue to your next quest... or one of Diablo's lieutenants who will strip the flesh from your bones as soon as look at you! Usually fantasy role-playing board games give you legions of different charactertypes to play as, but Blizzard have simplified things for Diablo, cutting the choice down to the three obvious variations. Each has their own skills and weaknesses which have a strong affect on the tactics you have to use during the game. As you make progress, the characters gain experience and when they reach a certain level you get five points which you can use to boost certain skills which may be lacking. It's a standard D&D detail which features in most Action RPGs no matter which format they take.

In Diablo, each time you hack down a demon or open a chest there's a chance that you'll be rewarded with a purse of gold or, better yet, some useful item to add to your inventory or to trade in Tristram. Weapons and armour are always welcome for warriors or rogues, and sorcerers like nothing better than a spell scroll or book. Best of all, though, are the unique items that combine the work of armourer and magician Weapons or armour that are blessed with a mystical power. In battle these can boost your skills, making a hit more likely, or a blow more devastating, and if you ever feel the need you can sell them in the village at a massive profit.

DIAB Welcome to battle.net Head 2 (25) No doubt the real D&D anoraks will despair at any references to Diablo being a traditional RPG because, in many respects it's just a simple battle game. There isn't much brainwork or strategy required beyond deciding which weapon to use for a particular foe. The quest elements are quite basic really, and the fact that the levels are always randomly generated the first time you enter them has limited the scope for placing genuine puzzles in the labyrinth. Having said all that, the action-packed combat and the endless desire to reach the next level, build my character and stock up on more fantastic weapons have all proved strong enough to hold my attention and keep me coming back for more. What really sets the game off, though, are the superb torch-lit 3D graphics, which, combined with the eery soundtracks, provide the perfect sinister-dungeon atmosphere. I enjoyed this almost as much as C&C: Red Alert, and if you played that one to death over Christmas I'd recommend you try Diablo next. PAUL GLACES Jongeel CORN 20 Viecode to B i tte Flywhol y ot?

"computer Video games 3D ADVENTURE BY SHINY  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED STORAGE 1 CD RELEASED BY INTERPLAY TEL: 01628 487758 1 PLAYERS APRIL RELEASE ROM ROM Slip into your skintight coil suit, strap your chaingun to your face, and enter MDK! DK. What can it really mean? A quick glimpse at the game would confirm the common theory of Murder Death Kill, with a strange character in a dark world, armed with loads of different weapons. Then you'll notice that you can create one foot-tall mushroom clouds, call upon a dog in a spaceship, and chase screaming boxes around the level. Just forget what it means, and play it. SAVE THE WORLD! MDK doesn't give you as long as you want to complete each level, as there's always a massive minecrawler tearing through a major city as you play. In the bottom-right corner of the screen, around your energy unit, is a green bar which indicates how many innocent people have been killed by the minecrawler. Take too long and the entire city is wiped out! After a few attempts at a level, you can learn exactly how to do it in the time allowed. MASTER DA KONTROLS! The start of the first level works as a simple training ground, letting the player get used to some of the skills needed regularly during MDK. For example, in the sniper training bit, you need to pick off enemies on the top of a distant building by shooting the small targets out of their hands! You also learn to use some of the power-ups, like the hand grenade. There goes Laguna Beach! OH NUTS! Zoom in as close as possible and shoot the targets from the hands of the aliens. You must time it just as they raise the target to their face! THE ALL-IMPORTANT WEAPON! Part of Kurt's strange 'coil suit' is his weapon. While he normally has it on one of his hands, it can also be connected to his mask to create the sniper helmet. W.Newsulash A huge City Minecrawier is neadeastraight for the Sunal village 1 Inneneid, England Attaching the weapon to Kurt's mask, the view switches to a first-person perspective, letting players see everything from Kurt's position. It's then possible to zoom the view for miles across the playing area, closing in on an exact part of an enemy who doesn't even know you're looking at them! In this mode, Kurt fires single, more powerful shots which can take an enemy's head off with just one accurate hit! Also, the collision detection means that it's even possible to shoot their arms or legs! ARM-MOUNTED CHAINGUN. REVIEW With the weapon attached to Kurt's arm, it works as a rapid-fire chaingun. You have unlimited standard shots, but can collect the Super Chaingun which increases the weapon's power immensely for up to 300 shots. SNIPER HELMELLA In sniper mode you can zoom in on the eyeball of an enemy miles away who doesn't even know you're around, then shoot his head clean off! 76 "


"computer video games ROM THE PROS AND CONS OF HANG-GLIDING Kurt's futuristic suit has some very interesting features, not least of which is his parachute. By jumping and holding the button down, Kurt will release strands of ribbon which work as a parachute. While gliding, Kurt can use his chain gun and all other power-ups. NOW ENTERING EARTH S ATMOSPHERE! Gliding is a skill you need to master early on in the game. Later, you need to float from updraft to updraft, like Pilotwings. At the start of every level, Kurt must freefall down to the new location. In these sections, a green radar beam is fired to pinpoint his location, then launch homing missiles at him. You need to dodge both the radar and missiles while trying to collect the power-ups attached to their own little ribbon chutes. These stages don't last too long, and are just introductions which determine how much health and which power-ups you start the main level with. Here you need to lob sniper mortars into a building through the chimneys! These black boxes look out for you, then roll off to alert other enemies to your presence! The freefall sections look particularly good because of the true 3D Kurt model, rather than the sprite version used in the main game. OW! ME FOOT! STREAM THY LAST STREAM At the end of each level, the stage breaks away and Kurt must freefall through the streams to his debriefing. These are much like the regular freefall stages, only there are no dangers to worry about. You just need to avoid the sides of the tube to make it to the end, or until you are pulled out by Max the dog. One of the coolest features of MDK is the way that the enemies react to different events, rather than standing around waiting to be shot. For a start, they don't instantly die whenever they're shot anywhere on their body you can shoot an enemy's arms off, or even shoot them in the foot so that they limp around. Also, the enemies are supposed to work together, so when one bad guy gets injured, those around him come to help! And they'll often hide behind objects, then peep their head around the corner to see where you are just line up a sniper bullet and take their heads off! An injured enemy just staggers around looking for help. Shoot his friends! The collision detection is so accurate that you can shoot the arms off an enemy from the other side of the level! REVIEW 77 "


"computer video games WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! To break up the game even more, there are some sections where kurt slides down long tunnels as though he's riding a water flume! By leaning forwards or backwards, it's possible to control his speed as you try to collect the long line of health power-ups on the way down. ROM If you want to finish the level in time, ignore the health and bomb your way down! A selection of lovely screenshots showing off the variation throughout MDK. UP UP AND AWAY! You don't need to play all of MDK on foot, as there are some sections which break the game up a bit. For example, there are small control pillars in some areas which, when shot, call a big drop ship to land nearby. By jumping inside, Kurt can fly around the level, dropping an unlimited supply of bombs on the enemies and buildings below! It's a very useful thing to do, as the bombs can be used to take out things which would give you real problems from the ground. From the air you get to take out enemies hiding in bunkers, as well as blowing the roof off this big building! Whoa-ho-hoh! SURFING MDK! Near the start of level 4, getting rid of one of the larger robots means that Kurt can climb onto a spare hoverboard, then smash through a wall on it! There follows a chase down a long slope, while gunners and alien boarders attempt to get rid of Kurt! REVIEW 78 "


"WORLD S MOST INTERESTING BOMB computer video games This one's particularly interesting-drop it and run away, then trigger it whenever you want. It does big damage and can be used from any distance, unless you leave it too long. HAND GRENADE The hand grenade's pretty simple throw it at something, and it explodes! Can hurt Kurt. ROM MORTAR The mortars are used in sniper mode, and bounce around like grenades. You often need to lob them through small gaps in walls or windows. SNIPER GRENADE The sniper grenades work like standard sniper shots, only they explode when they come into contact with anything. HAMMER This giant hammer repeatedly bashes the floor to create a massive earthquake which does big damage to everything nearby. You don't come across this one often, but it's VERY useful. COLLECT MORE AMAZING POWERS! One thing missing from the preview versions of MDK we played were the power-ups. Not only are they very useful, but they also add a good touch of humour to the game. BONES AIR STRIKE With the Bones Airstrike loaded into the sniper helmet, select a target and fire. You will then call the friendly dog to fly in over your head and drop loads of bombs on your target! At this point you need to run across a giant shooting range, avoiding the alien lasers aimed at the cardboard humans! Climb on a giant gun and fire yourself through the window! REVIEWER WORLD S SMALLEST NUCLEAR EXPLOSION DECOY Normally used for unlocking doors, this really is a small explosion! When thrown it rumbles, then produces a 1-foot tall mushroom cloud, complete with shockwave! You often need to search around for them. Kurt throws an inflatable drawing of himself which then trundles around the level, fooling the stupid enemies. It also makes a brilliant squeaking noise as it rolls around! I like this a lot. MDK may not be the most \"free\" game ever, but it's got so many clever ideas in it that it can't fail to impress. Every room is a brilliant set-piece completely different from the last, and the unique style of the graphics gives the game an excellent feel. The sniper helmet is a fantastic idea, and really shows off the quality of the game engine, as the graphics stay perfectly sharp from any distance. The music is also brilliant, with a movie-like orchestral score and some wacky choices of music for the bosses (wait 'til you hear the final boss music!). The puzzles are never so tough as to leave you stuck, and the action is balanced so that each time you play, you can get a bit further. There's not been a PC game with so much style, character, humour, and entertainment in it for a long time. CV LAMAS d el CEDEK SUPER CHAINGUN. HEALTH REVIEW RATING Health appears in the form of different pieces of food apples for 10%, chickens for 50% plus there's a super health power-up. This can increase your energy to 150%, but whenever you go to pick it up, it screams and runs away! Keep chasing until you get it! Completely weird, very original, and totally stylish. A top-class game which entertains from start to finish. The super chaingun is one of the best power-ups to find. It gives you 300 mega-powerful shots which take out most enemies far quicker than the standard gun will. Worth hunting down. "

The most interesting of these is a cheat that lets you play one of the Jet Rider tracks! Mr Slam's JCB picks up opponents and bashes them into the ground repeatedly! Axel just stands between two tyres, using rocket launchers on his shoulders! Enemies SHADOW Strangely enough, this is one of the most popular games in America at the moment. Without being too offensive, it's possible to see why, as this is exactly what we've come to expect from American developers \"rockin\" music, wacky characters, explosions, and mindless destruction. While it's fun for a while, like the first game it isn't going to last very long at all, even in multi-player mode. The graphics aren't great, but work well enough most of the time, and the sounds are okay. There are some excellent touches being able to blow the top off the Eiffel Tower, for a start but the handling of the vehicles means that you spend ages flying through the air with no control over where you're going! It's certainly fun every now and then, but when you're having to fork out over  for a game, you're likely to want something which is going to last you a bit longer than this. Your best bet is to hire it out whenever you feel like a go. 1 LOMAS On the secret Jet Rider track, the cars drive on the water! It's too small to be much fun. Lives: 0 REVIEW Fall off one of the buildings on the New York stage and you'll see a secret code written in the lights. Use it to play as Sweet Tooth!

With Sega, Namco and Nintendo all challenging each other to become king of the waves. Sony of America enter this heavyweight bout with their latest offering, the strange hybrid racer Jet Rider. Rather than opt for a jet-ski simulation, Jet Rider includes a slight twist with the introduction of the hover bike. You still race across the waters, but you can race over more solid ground too. Gentlemen start your hover/jet/bike/ski thingies! 0:29.8 TREE HOUSE OF HORROR The Jet Rider courses are some of the most difficult we've seen. Covering ocean, swamp, mountain and ice. A particularly lethal aspect of these circuits are the really tight corners. Luckily you have a special tool on your bike to tackle these the magnetic grapple!

ACCELERATION bikes with the faster acceleration, don't always have the quickest top speed. MASS With weight on your side, you have more chance to unseat the opponents. A lighter bike, and you're usually the victim. Finally LIFT the strength of the suspension field which supports the bike. Vital for getting 'big air' off jumps. To gain top speed, you need to stick to the ground. JetRider 0:00.9 Frum REVIEWER INTO THE MUD SCUM-QUEENI There are loads of different race styles included in Jet Rider. Ranging from the single race to the full season. Better is the custom circuit option, which allows you to change the rules for each race. Here you can juggle between rally and elimination modes. Even better is the split-screen two player option, where it's one-on-one battles ahoy. A cheat on completion of the game, also allows you to race in two player mode against the other eighteen riders too. I'm going to jump right in and say Jet Rider is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. Not that I didn't try. The problem is the obstacles which tarnish the courses. One or two might be alright, but hundreds of obstacles just ruins the fun. It's almost impossible to have a race in this game-take a turn wrong and your left at the back of the pack! There's too much to learn too soon, with the earlier courses being much harder than some of the later tracks. Stupid. The best racers have excellent learning curves, Jet Rider doesn't. What could have been good was to divide the races between jet-ski, motorbike, etc. Instead merging all these vehicles together is a bit of a mess.

POSITION OSPREY GLACIER REVIEWER POSITION 1055 PASS THE SICK BAG If you're driving off road, chances are you'll probably fall down some sort of cavern than even a Monster Truck could not get out of. So the programmers have added a very handy rescue team who come and fish you out. Pressing triangle calls the helicopter which basically winches trucks back onto the track. It wastes time, but at least you return to the right path! Credit to Psygnosis for trying something a little different, but at the end of the day, it didn't do much for me. The graphics look nice enough, but the *pop-up' for some stages is pretty bad, somewhat spoiling things. The collision detection on some of the stationary objects is quite dodgy too. Having said that, it has quite a distinctive feel to it, and I dare say that it's how I would imagine a real Monster Truck to handle like. Monster Trucks isn't a bad game, but having played so many better driving titles on the PlayStation Wipeout for instance I'd go for one of those instead. STEVE HED POSITION TINE 0218 REVIEW By simply cutting off this small corner, you can go from being fifth or sixth and shoot straight up to first. Computer opponents never follow you or take these short cuts, so make use of them as often as possible. 0106 5000 RATING RATING Certainly the best example of a big truck scramble so far. But with better racers already available, this comes as a disappointment by comparison. 82 "

Now that's a different story... 0 he one place where Duke Nukem 3D is definitely superior is in singleplayer mode. For some reason, Quake's levels had lost a bit of the edge and imagination which Doom's levels had, while Duke 3D had some of the most varied, clever and entertaining levels ever seen. Now, ex-members of the Duke Nukem 3D team have taken it upon themselves to create an id Software-backed collection of Quake levels, and have come up with something really special! QUAKE MISSION PACK THE BEST GAME ENGINE EVER! As well as writing completely new levels, new textures, and other new features, bits of main coding have been changed slightly to improve the already amazing Quake game engine. For example, the first door you come across opens downwards towards you something never seen in the regular Quake levels. Pick up the laser cannon, then climb on the ledge behind. It'll take you around the level on a monorail hang. ing from the track above! Never seen that before! f Little improvements to the game engine mean that extra touches such as this working 3D clock on the wall are now possible! Use the zoom mode to take a closer look at it!

Scourge of Armagon has some new monsters for you use your equally-new weaponry on. While these are all-new characters, they fit in to the overall Quake style brilliantly and don't look out of place at all. GREMLIN CENTROID Normally, add-on packs for games are a waste of time. They're either just a few ideas which the programmers bashed out quickly to make a bit of cash, or they're cobbled together from home-made bits and pieces put on the internet. Recently, however, we've been proven wrong with the fantastic Plutonium Pack for Duke Nukem 3D and now Quake Mission Pack 1. It's immediately clear that these levels are professionally designed, with all manner of ingenious ways to expand on the fantastic Quake game engine. In fact, these levels are far better in one-player mode than the original Quake levels themselves. The continuity means that all of the new textures, designs and features fit into Quake perfectly, and add lots to one of the greatest games of all-time. This add-on pack truly is essential for all owners of Quake, and seeing as every PC owner must have the game already, this becomes essential for ALL PC owners. Absolutely fantastic!

"computer video games \"POLYGON CHARACTERS INCREASE THE DRAMA Polygon characters allow for involving cinematic techniques in FFVII. This is most effective in the battle scenes where the viewpoint zooms in and out, in front of and behind the characters involved. This kind of drama also enhances the atmosphere where a concept of size and/or space is necessary. It allows for intimacy or claustrophobia, as much as it enables a sense of awe at a distant view of a giant structure — while still being able to control the hero.

"computer Video games SQUARE ON LOVE TRIANGLES AND VICIOUS CIRCLES As we mentioned earlier, Square's RPGs, particularly Final Fantasy, are renowned for their storytelling. This happens through the thoughts and actions of the characters on screen, just like in a real movie. Only difference being you read the dialogue, instead of listening to voices. Unlike most action games, indeed unlike most other RPGs, FFVII doesn't always focus on the lead character. Though Cloud Strife is the main hero, it is just as important to know his friends. Personalities are crucial to the development of the plot. With approximately 50 hours of gameplay to work through, Square needed to be masterful in this area! And they were even better.

YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS GAME: FINAL FANTASYIT Hundreds of characters affect the course of FFVII. The majority yield a snippet of useful info if spoken to. A select few, however, fall under the player's control as key roles. It's unpredictable who most of these are, which keeps life exciting. For example Aerith appears as an unobtrusive Flower Seller very early on, with little to say for herself. You almost forget her. Once Cloud plummets through the roof of a Church, it's a different story as Aerith comes to his rescue. They talk. Learn they share a common enemy. Aerith happens to be an adopted orphan with a mysterious past... you have to find out more. Everyone has their story.

In fact Sephiroth was once Cloud's superior, and revered as the greatest soldier in the force.

SHIN-RA RED XVII introduced rather disrespectfully as 'the sample' one of many we are soon to find out Red XVIII is incredibly intelligent, and terribly vicious. He (or she, no one is sure) is the result of laboratory tests conducted by Shin-Ra. As you might expect Red's weapons are sharp claws and sharper teeth! THE SITUATION SO FAR Once again Square choose a powerful ecology versus technology theme the forces of nature overcoming man's selfishness. Midgar is a huge industrial town, governed by a greedy organisation, the Shin-Ra Electric Power Company. The conglomerate has been draining the planet of its natural life force for profit. That life force is called Makon, extracted using Makon furnaces. There is a world beyond Midgar where Makon flows freely and does not harm the planet. Only Midgar is where Shin-Ra can make money. The population are treated as though they were prisoners, few knowing the world outside exists. Unsurprisingly, a rebel force, Avalanche, is formed. One of their first targets is a Makon furnace they aim to bring it down, blow it up. Among the group assigned to the mission is Cloud Strife, an ex Shin-Ra soldier. Using Avalanche as his scape goat, the Shin-Ra president decides it's payback time... All the President's men. These are the guys Avalanche run into time and time again as the struggle continues. President Shin-Ra has his son, Rufaus, as his righthand man. But the characters responsible for most of the dirty work are collec tively known as The Turks Tsong, LLyna, Reno, and Lewde. AERITH GAINSBOROUGH NEW GAMES Aerith is 22, and gorgeous by all accounts. A love interest for Cloud, perhaps. Well before anything like that happens Aerith is first revealed selling flowers in Midgar to raise money for her foster mother in the slums.

CLOSE THE DISTANCE BROADEN THE EXPERIENCE OU SHOULD KNOW THIS GAME: Taking a refreshing stroll is all very well, but travel is a long process once key places are located on opposite ends of the world map. So Square introduce some amazing alternative, forms of transportation. Cutest of all are the Chocobo birds, which are ridden at speed across the land. Most impressive of all is the airship Highwind, piloted by an important, character name of Cid Highwind, which takes you anywhere you need to go in no time at all. Bit coolest of all by far is Cloud Strife's Hardy Daytona motorcycle!!! YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS GAME: FINAL FANTASY W GONNA RIDE THAT HOG CLOUD STRIFE As the Avalanche party takes flight from the ShinRa building, after finding the President dead, they are pursued by Shin-Ra soldiers. To make a speedy get away the whole team grabs hold of the nearest vehicle and burns rubber. At only 21 years of age, Cloud has seen a lot of action as a Shin-Ra soldier. And because some of what he saw was so appalling, Cloud is now a committed member of the Avalanche rebel group. His main weapon is a sword, tall as his body, though he is capable of strong magic too. BARRETT WALLACE As the leader of Avalanche, Barrett is theoretically Cloud's boss. In any case it would seem silly to argue with a man this size, who has a chain gun where his right forearm should be! Barrett is a 35 year-old father of a cute little girl, Marin. Barrett lost his wife along time ago, we guess to Shin-Ra. Cloud fights to keep the Shin-Ra riders from attacking his friends in the funny-looking blue van, hitting out with his sword. By the way this is all happening real time. This sequence is so exhilarating it could warrant its own game! NEW GAMES Tlvestat. 33, 1 Cool CG sequence that supports the chase. We all want bikes like Cloud! 1 Energy bars indicate the health of Cloud's Avalanche friends. 1 The chase ends here. And so as you can see does Midgar! 91 "


"computer video games CROWNING GLORY ALL HAIL THE NEW FIGHTING SYSTEM Here's where Final Fantasy VII separates the men from the boys those of us who live for the challenge of a fierce fight, from players who like watching a pretty picture. Presenting the Final Fantasy VII battle system!!! For those of you who don't know, the largest proportion of RPG credibility is judged on its battle system. Meaning Square's designers had to devise the greatest thing, seeing as it was going to become the latest thing out there. We believe they succeeded. Incredibly, though we go into some detail here there is much, much more to learn. But we'll leave the finer points for another time. Just marvel at the effects. 305 550F 1702 5177  READY FOR THE ATTACK Battles may occur at any time when the hero party is in hostile territory. Only the villages are entirely safe, where dense population keeps monsters at bay. Attacks are sud, den, and usually out of the blue the enemy is invisible until it is upon you. Only Shin-Ra's guards are visible, or bosses. This means players must keep the party in good condition at all times in preparation. CHOOSE WISELY AND CHOOSE FAST! So the battle begins, with both sides ready to strike. But to do so they have to wait until they have recovered enough stamina to make a move. This waiting period is indicated by a Time bar, whose speed of recovery is governed by the experience level of the character, or any number of effects caused by enemy magic. Square call this method of combat the Active Time Battle (ATB). DRUP 4123 NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS GAME: 50F Lot 318 318 298 323 41/ With the Time Bar full, players choose from a list of possible tactics. From top to bottom these are Fight, Magic, Item, and Change (switch formation). 398 638 653 653 103 POWER EXTREME Now this is really cool. Each time a character suffers a hit, some energy is added to the Limit Gauge which sits next to the Time gauge. Once the Limit gauge is full, the Fight command is replaced by the word Limit. If selected a powerful Limit Break move is performed, which is personalised to each character. These are all awesome to behold, as they are initiated by a bright, magical aura. TOAS NEW GAMES Aerith heals the whole party with her Limit Break. It's often better to reserve this until absolutely necessary her other magic attacks are helpful in the meantime. 401_04811 510 5483 f Tifa's Limit Break takes Barrett's Heavy Shot the form of a one-armed emerges as a single, bandit tumbler.

"LIVING IN A MATERIA WORLD COMING FROM ALL SIDES computer Video games The enemy is liable to attack from any direction. Usually the odds are pretty even, and the battle starts with both sides facing each other. Chance plays an important role too, however... 537 ! There are some people who believe precious stones and minerals to have spiritual properties. In the world of Final Fantasy VII such a belief is taken for granted by all, and used to full effect. Every garment, and every weapon/ tool has at least one hole reserved for a precious stone called Materia. These gems, of which there are five varieties, impart magical properties when attached. Once you become familiar with the individual properties of Materia, it's possible to combine their effects on certain weapons.

Basically there are some scenes which Sony America are uncomfortable with which they claim may be removed if the game is to be made available to all ages. We've signed the petition to prevent this already and think you should too. The scenes in question are quite innocent and very important. Expect regular updates from CVG.

ARMOR oom is one of the most famous games in the known Universe. The PC version was the most amazing thing seen at the time, and it has gone on to appear on almost every other format since. Therefore, it's not surprising in the least that the enhanced Doom 64 was made. Using a brand new graphics engine, redesigned weapons and enemies, plus all-new levels and an extra gun, this is bound to send all Doom fans into Berserk mode. DOOM 64 WELCOME TO THE MACHINE Shooting the barrels causes a powerful explosion. INTRODUCING... DOOM 64! LEVEL All of the levels in Doom 64 are completely new, and all use a game engine which is slightly enhanced over the original's. For example, there, are now lots more enormous machines which bash sections of floor, there are conveyor belts, and there are some very cleverly designed traps which would never be possible in the original, versions of Doom. The 40+ levels aren't broken up into separate episodes, but are still in similar styles to the three old episodes -space bases, castles, and Hell itself! The levels get more and more demented and overrun with Hell-spawn as you play through the game! The short introduction sequence to Doom 64 is excellent. Rather than use the usual FMV intros normally found on CD-based consoles, this shows real-time action of loads of bad guys battling with heroes around some big buildings. As the view zooms out slowly, the buildings turn out to be a giant Doom logo! The new map rotates in real-time as you play. MIND CONTROL In Turok, the 3D stick moves the main character's head around, but in Doom it controls how fast you move forwards and backwards. Rather than having the usual run button, you now just push the stick slightly forward to walk very slowly, or all the way to run quickly. The C buttons and cross-key can be configured to whatever suits you best. 1 You really appreciate the quality of the level design when in big rooms like this. NEW GAMES 1 You can still tell it's Doom! 94 This is what Doom is all about! Death! "

While the Pain Elemental has been included (it wasn't in the other console versions), some enemies are currently missing the Chaingun Guy, Arch-Vile and Revenant.

Nocturn is the sequel to Castlevania IV on the Super Nintendo. The long gestation period between the titles shows. New improved graphics and characters remain faithful, while improving on the original by miles. The game even starts slightly before where the original ended. In this rerun of events Simon Belmont defeats Dracula but is bitten in the process, setting the scene for this new game where you play Alucard the son of Dracula. There is still a rival vampire to be defeated, who resides in a huge castle that is to be explored. Nocturn still adheres to classic platforming style, only now there is also an RPG element where you can store weapons, potions and food all accessed through an inventory/option menu.

Question is, why did the boffs plant them in the first place? Can you find out? Can you sur vive? The truth is in here! This may be another 3D corridor shooter, but at least from the start things feel different. Events are non-linear, with multiple paths to take during the game. There are fellow marines to interact with as well as those crazy scientists. All CPU characters have their own objectives, which you'll have to plan around because their actions will either aide or hinder you. Area 51 is very technologically based you'll  have to manipulate robots and tamper with security cameras to view other levels, and eavesdrop on other characters.

PRRR... ope now springs eternal at the McLaren camp.

Now it has finally been completed, providing McLaren with a great excuse to spend lots of money on a lavish party. A NIGHT OF STARS AND CARS. AND CVG! West THE MEN BEHIND THE WHEEL... THE BIG BASI McLaren have also decided to stick with David Coulthard and Mika Hakkinen as their drivers for this year, showing that they aren't prone to backstabbing like another F1 team. And how would you expect a racing driver of this calibre to prepare for upcoming season. Regular running and jogging? Well yes some of that. Nipping off to the gym every now and again? Yep, some of . that too. But did you know that he also learnt how to ride a camel? David Coulthard, one of the top ten Formula One drivers in the world, trains by learning how to ride a camel. Cool. The date: Thursday 13th February. The time: 1900 hours. The place: Alexandra Palace. The reason: McLaren launch their new F1 car. Usually, the standard of events we manage to blag our way into wouldn't warrant a single column, but this was on a slightly grander scale shall we say. It was thanks to our chums at Eidos that we managed to get in. Because they have secured the F1 licence this season and are currently developing a title for the PC to be released later this year called Power F1, they got us a couple of tickets. They also had a stand there and a lovely Tomb Raider girlie walking around, pouting at the punters. The evening started with Jamiroquai performing a few of his best known tunes (Space Cowboy, Virtual Insanity) before moving on to the presentation of the car. Starlight Express did a bit of Rollerskating, Steve 'Grandstand Ryder chatted about the car as it emerged in through flashing lights and dry ice. The drivers came on a did their bit. And then the real reason why everybody turned up. The Spice Girls. FEATURE Don't believe a word anybody said. 90% of the audience was male. That means that 90% of the conversations taking place during the Spices' set were along the lines of \"I think she looks the nicest.\" They came, shouted \"Girl Power\" a bit, did a few karate kicks and stopped. Then they told the two drivers to \"Get 'em off,\" referring to their racing uniforms and finished for the night. Not bad for half an hours work. Oh, and they each walked away with a brand new convertible Mercedes as well. Then Jamiroquai returned, and everybody left to go to the bar. And that's where recollection of the evening stopped.

Our version of Final Fantasy // is missing several items, locations, and abilities. The game was made easier, and 'offensive' items such as a 'stripping' dancer (she was really wearing a bathing suit), and a humorous dirty magazine were removed because of Americans' \"greater sensibilities.\" The greatest games ever made, altered because someone thought Americans couldn't handle the \"shock\". I believe Americans can handle the \"shock\" of Final Fantasy vil's world. Midgar is not a pretty place. It is an ugly desolate slum.

Sony Computer Entertainment America, who are working closely with Square on the English text version. has yet to make any decision on the matter of censorhip, and have stated they are keen to keep the integrity of the work intact. However, with such a massive title, the prospect of limiting the game to a teen rating in the US must be an important factor.

Following the recent announcement of Sega and Bandai's merger, Bandai's president who will also be president of the new SegaBandai made a shocking statement in the February 6th edition of Japanese newspaper 'Mainichi Shinbun' about major policy changes within the new company's structure. He stated they had \"obtained a license to bring Virtua Fighter to the PlayStation. And if Nintendo gives the okay, we'll put it on N64 aswell.\" This news has naturally caused all kind of gossip among the worldwide gaming press and on the internet. However, following the statement, a Sega spokesman said there are no plans to port any of the VF series or any Saturn-exclusive titles to PlayStation. It seems this example was used to demonstrate that previous PlayStation games could now come to Saturn, and vice versa. The possibility is there, but there are no plans.

Anyway, look out for more ATARI CLASSICS news coming soon, including details of PART 2 which is reported to include the likes of PAPERBOY, GAUNTLET, HARD DRIVIN, MARBLE MADNESS, ROADBLASTERS and MILLEPEDE. think you'll agree that this would make an essential purchase and the most awesome retro compilation yet! Ooooh... and while I'm on the subject of new old games, SEGA of Japan are putting together a brilliant compilation on Saturn from their vast back catalogue of arcade hits, including the likes of FLICKY, the awesome UP 'N' DOWN and maybe FANTASY ZONE if we're lucky! News on a British release as soon as I get it. UP 'N' DOWN. Awwwwesome!!! pend all your free time buying up other peoples old tat? Pay extortionate prices for ancient games worth around 10p? Obsessively collect the new Star Wars figures, paying bucketloads of cash for a lump of plastic you'll never take out of the box? You've just entered the \"GOBLIN ZONE». HUNCHBACK was a massive hit for Ocean software on the C64 and Speccy back in 1984 and was programmed by the 17-year old. Christian Urghart who churned out a lot of decent arcade conversions for the Manchester-based company. HUNCHBACK IL Versions of the This multi-screen game casts the genre appeared on most 8-bits. player in the chivalrous role of the hero who's task it was to rescue the fair Esmerelda. Controls are basic left, right and jump as you leap and swing across the increasingly difficult ramparts avoiding the constant barrage of arrows and spear wielding natives. Ocean went on to milk the license for every penny it was worth, with games including the equally popular HUNCHBACK 2 (not an arcade conversion) and the bizzare HUNCHBACK AT THE OLYMPICS. BBC B owners can enjoy a bit of bellringing action with HUNCHBACK from Superior Software, who rank up there with Acornsoft as the kings of arcade game rip-offs. Vic 20 owners have to settle with QUASIMODO by Hitech games. Oh, and by the way, HUNCHBACK was also the first Spectrum game ever advertised on TV. W ell, it only seems like yesterday but I suppose that R-TYPE by VV IREM is 'cabin fodder' nowadays. This game blew me away when I first saw it in my local arcade, not because it was anything startlingly new but because what it did, it did incredibly well. Firstly the graphics are beautifully detailed, boasting some awesome boss creatures. Remember the putrefying sea anenome thing with a huge seaworm swimming in and out of its many orifices or the enormous starship at the end of level three that required you to slowly travel around the ship destroying its many weapons one by one? The only way to deal with these coralhorrors is to acquire a load of powerups, which is where R-TYPE excels again. The first is an indestructible globe that survives onscreen as long as you do. It will glide along beside you, or if you move either end of your Sporo ship up to it, it attaches itself and boosts your fire power. Each subse R-TYPE, Shoot em up classic. quent weapon is then specifically designed to make wiping out particular enemies easier if used and deployed correctly. Awesome stuff! The only really decent conversion that I know of is for the PC ENGINE, that came as part one and two on the little credit card style HUcard thingies, though the speccy version is worth checking out for a laugh! The evil Goblin has taken over the world and has stolen all the World's trea sures and hidden them in a giant cave, guarded by an army of weird and wonderful creatures. No, I'm not referring to my enormous games horde at CVG towers, but the excellent THING ON A SPRING by Gremlin Graphics. The game is a classic left/right/jump screen to screen affair which involves bouncing your thing around the caverns to ultimately return all the World's treasures. Along the way, you're also required to pick up various objects such as escalator reversers and oil to keep you from rusting up. A point of note is the wonderfully cheesy tune courtesy of the legendary Rob Hubbard, and the typically wacky C64-style graphics. From the same stable comes BOUNDER an extremely addictive game in which you bounce a tennis ball along a deadly course suspended in midair until you reach THING ON A SPRING. Funny music. the goal. You start the course with BOUNDER. Addictive but hard. three balls, but can gain more by bouncing on the mystery spaces. Beware, as some are instant death in the guise of deadly darts, crows, etc... You'll also have to make full use of the special jump squares that propel your ball over large chasms or the 'scary' flying sticks. Once the course is clear you move onto a bonus screen where you have a set number of bounces to jump onto mystery squares to LE 1 SCOREED 8088130 increase your score. BOUNDER was a great original concept and extremely frustrating with a massive 'one more go' factor. Mind you lets not forget the free game of METATABOLIS on side B of the C64 version... Actually we may as well, it was bull-dung! Computer Wahoooo! Another reason to dust off my PlayStation comes in the shape of ATARI ARCADE CLASSICS by GT Interactive. Comprising of BATTLEZONE, TEMPEST, ASTEROIDS, CENTIPEDE, SUPER BREAKOUT and MISSILE COMMAND, this is another essential line-up of old classics. I can always remember where I first played a game you know, and ASTEROIDS brought back memories of hanging out in the 'Golden Goose' arcade in Llandudno. I especially recall all the hard kids who would 'ask' to play my last credit or 'help me with the nudges on my all-time favourite fruity. ADDERS AND LADDERS and demand a few tokens for the privilege. Ah... happy days! suppose! The same gang would then march off for a bit of freeplay fun, courtesy of the old 'customised electric lighter spark flicked into the coin slot trick' on the secluded old copy of ROBOT, or perhaps a they'd 'win' a pound or two by repeatedly ramming a length of wire down the coin-slot of the more decrepit Retro DOWNLOAD FREE GAMES NOW!

"computer video games FREEPLAY FAN he idea of FreePlay Fan is for you to tell everyone else what YOU love most about YOUR favourite game or company, not to insult other readers and say how rubbish their machines are. From now on, please just send us positive messages saying how much you enjoy video games, rather than listing everything you hate about them. We print every letter in full, exactly as they were sent to us, unless they're marked otherwise. Dear FreePlay Fan, Saturn Great! PlayStation Excellent! Ninty 64 Fantastic! M2 Hoo-flippingray! I just don't care! What am I talking about? I am of course referring to the huge amount of console slagging between different console fans. What is the point in all this bickering? Do you not feel shallow? I am sick of people noting the wonderful qualities of their respective consoles and cheesy whinging about the inferior aspects of other peoples' consoles. I myself own a PS yet I have never slagged off any Saturners or Ninty 64 followers or whoever else about their purchases. I am pleased with my console and do not even begin to regret buying it. I do like some of the software on the other consoles but I have more good games on the PS than I could possibly afford so I am happy. Saturn owners are quick to boast about their console's 2D capabilities but I just ignore them because if I had wanted good 2D games then I would have bought a Saturn but I do not and although this means I will miss out on AM 1, 2, and 3 arcade conversions which is a great shame I am still over joyed about the software on my PS. Finally, I would just like to ask why everyone goes on about how much better than the PS and Sat the Ninty 64 is? It should be a lot bloody better it is coming out 18 months after the PS and Sat, if it wasn't I would be badly disappointed in Nintendo! Please stop all this shallow arguing, if you were not so fascinated in other peoples consoles, you would have more time to enjoy your own. Yours truly, David Keddie, Auchtermuchty PlayStation what I am saying is PlayStation owners are people who don't know nothing about video games. You go on about the Saturns 3D trying to say it's crap look at Panzar Dragoon and Virtua Cop 2 the 3D is brilliant. The PlayStation has Wipeout 2097 and Rigde Racer but the Saturn has the even better Daytona CCE and Sega Rally and F1 and Wipeout could end up on Saturn because there Psygnosis. The Saturn has the best of all kinds of games VF2 and Fighting Vipers beat Tekken series and Soul Edge. Fighters Megamix and VF3 is going to blow these away. The best puzzel Baku Baku. VC1 and 2. Sonic 3D is coming to Saturn. All the best games are on or coming on Saturn. Tell me on thing if the PlayStation is so grate why can't it handle X-Men, Marvel Superherose and X-Men verses Street Fighter. I read that they might use a 3D accleorator chip inside a cartridge for VF3 and games like it which would boost the Saturn 3D capabilities above the PlayStation even the N64 but your to scard of PlayStation owners to meantion anything like that. You won't print this because you don't like the truth. Jon Taylor. PS. Give us more news on KOF96. FREEPLAY FAN Tomb Raider is far superior to the PSX punishment: being that stupid, living version?

People got taken in by N64 inspired diatribe against all hype and beacuse of the hype and things non-Nintendo: deary, deary me. because the machine had Sony There's just no point in even trying to written on it people who don't know answer it. I think Kevin has enough nothing about video games brought a Dear FreePlay, computer What the hell is going on?! Video The majority of letters games printed in issue 182 of CVG were negative and it was supposed to be Christmas. My God, PlayStation this, Saturn that, N64's a failure. And Tolouse Montage's letter!! Hello! CVG is multiformat, they're not biased, they highlight differences between the same games on Saturn and PlayStation so people who own both machines can make an informed choice as to which version is best for them. If this annoys you so much why do you buy the mag, just f**k off and buy Sega Saturn Magazine, okay!! And as for everyone else stop being so negative. I could easily make a great big list of gob smackingly brilliant games released during 1996 across all three major formats. I think everyone who is \"into\" games should own a Saturn, PlayStation (both in the shops now in case you hadn't noticed) and a Nintendo 64 from the 1st of March. All three are essential pieces of gaming kit and anyone who says otherwise can f**k off. Now that that's all cleared up can get back to Tomb Raider. Sorry I had to use some strong language but last month's letters were so annoying (yes all of them) that it was necessary. Be happy everyone, Sweeney Boy, Derry. Dear C&VG, computer What is Monsieur Video games Montage whittering on about? Since C&VG declined to comment, I will. The point of the review is for the reviewer to tell it like they see it, you don't have to agree with them, but don't be a petulant moron when you don't (I personally prefer Tekken to Fighting Vipers so can't see why FV (cool as it is) got a High Five when the almighty Tekken 2 only got a four, but that's the way they saw it and made the call. Do I rant about it?). The issue is not whether the Saturn has more complex architecture than PSX, but that the implementation of the architecture in the PSX version was marginally better in the case of Tomb Raider (its routine libraries are better suited to that style of game, sorry Tolouse but that's the way it is. If you want to 'blame' somebody then blame Sega's Hardware designers for making Saturn a pig to develop for). From the sounds of your letter, you're a hardened PSX hater, so how on Earth can you say that the Saturn FREEPLAY "

"computer Video games THE BASIC GUIDE TO MASTER SWORDSMANSHIP ew from the master gamesmiths at Namco is the 3D slash'em up, Soul Blade (or Soul Edge). Combining some of the hottest action seen on the Sony machine with the most beautiful light-sourcing, this game is definitely worthy of a CVG guide. SECRET CHARACTERS! Being a Namco game, Soul Edge is brimming with secret characters. Making them selectable is awkward, but worth it! Remember, these characters can't be used in the Edge Master mode. SIEGFRIED! SOUL EDGE so IMPACI BOCKING bezwa, Impact blocking allows you to block without taking weapon damage and can come in very handy when your sword's about to go. And for added bonus, you can counter attack for a huge damage enemy punishment. But the timing for impact blocking is slightly different against each fighter so bear that in mind. INSERT COIN STAGE 10350 STAGE 1 SEING ARKA TAKO SEINGANA Siegfried! is the evil version of Siegfried (from his 'normal' ending) and as long as you attain all seven of Siegfried's special weapons in the Edge Masters mode, Siegfriedl will be ready for you to control! He can be found off the edge of the select screen. STAGE 1921 PUSH 2P START SIEGFRIED Soul Edge will be yours after 20 hours has been clocked up on your timer (the clock is on the top left hand corner of the record screen.). STARE I S OG. SOULEDGE LLONG VOLDO You usually have to enter the guard impact command earlier with a vertical attack and later with a horizontal attack. SoulDUE PLAYER'S GUIDE en DODAING menee Dodging can be the key to unlocking an opponent's defenses if they are blocking everything that you can throw at them. Just side-step the attack and slice up his blind side! 1 Siegfried! has all the moves of the normal Siegfried but he causes slightly more damage and wears evil armour! 1 Soul Edge is a powered up version of Captain Cervantes and has all manner of trickery up his evil sleeves! TAO SOPHITIA! SOPHITIA!! As soon as you successfully dodge, make your opponent pay promptly! ................................ To make Sophitia! a member of your Soul Edge roster, gain all Sophitia's Edge Master mode weaponry and she's yours to choose. She is next to Siegfried! just off the screen. If Sophitial wasn't enough for you, you're sure to like the swimming costume edition Sophitia. Sophitia!! is the same as the other two versions in terms of moves, but for you Sophitia fans out there, she's a must-have addition to your roster! kes RINGOTS A great way of turning a losing battle into a solid win is to finish your enemy off with a ring out. Either use a floating combo or a knockdown blow near the edge of the ring for a quick instant victory. 1414 SOPHITIAN HWANG SOEHITTA HWANG PUSEI SER Following an uppercut with a fast combination is a sure way of achieving a ring out. 1 Skimpier outfit but sadly no new moves for Sophitia fans. Still, it's a good bonus! 1 For Sophitia!!, collect all 70 weapons in Master mode! FREEPLAY CRITICAL EDGE vai, Being able to do the Critical Edge instantly and constantly is a must if you're to be a Soul Edge master! The Critical Edge can decide the outcome of the fight quite easily, but to hit your opponent with it can be quite difficult. The key is to committing the extender of your chosen character to memory and then trying to predict your opponent's movements. For example, if they have a tendency to rush forward and attack at the opening of the round, its best to dash back twice and Critical Edge immediately guaranteed to hit! But don't do it too often though or you'll get caught out. 10 "


"computer video games KEY H This is a beginner's guide to Soul Edge so be prepared to experiment after you've committed all these attacks to your memory. Remember, being able to do the moves during practice is nothing if you can't do it in a fight, okay? Horizontal attack Vertical attack Kick Guard < < FLOATING UPPERCUT DOWNWARD STAB LITTLE JUMPING SLASH MITSURUGI HEISHIRO USEFUL ATTACK HX2 V DOWN+V DOWNWARD STAB LITTLE JUMPING SLASH LONG RANGE Mitsurugi is the \"average' fighter of Soul Edge, but has the potential to blossom into the most lethal fighter in the game. With a good range and a useful repertoire of moves. Mitsurugi is a solid character for both beginners and masters alike. AWAY+H OR TOWARDS+V SHORT RANGE DOWN TOWARDS+H OR DOWN+K, V FLOATING PERIOR UPPERCUT H X3 STOMP LITTLE JUMPING SLASH USEFUL ATTACK LI LONG HX2 DOWN+H STOMP LITTLE JUMPING SLASH LONG RANGE Specialising in close quarter combat is the nunchuka master Li Long. Make your opponent take the first move and when there's a gap in his defenses, dash in and punish him with a variety of multi-hit nunchuka attaks. PLAYER'S GUIDE AWAY+H OR TOWARD X2+V FLOATING UPPERCUT UPPERCUT STOMP JUMPING LITTLE SLASH USEFUL ATTACK SEUNG MINA TOWARDS+H X2 DOWN+K SHORT RANGE The Korean fighter is more than just a pretty face she's a great long range fighter with a move for every situation possible. But most of her powerful moves tend to have a long delay before striking, so beware against the quicker characters. FREEPLAY TOWARDS+H Hou 11 "


"computer video games FLOATING UPPERCUT TOWARDS X2+V ROCK USEFUL ATTACK TOWARDS+H X3 Another long range fighter is Rock and though his battle axe is rather slow, the victim suffers a huge energy drain once it strikes. Patience is the game for the Rock beginner wait until there's an opening and strike! LONG RANGE DOWN BACKWARDS+H FLOATING UPPERCUT DEMON ELBOW TOWARDS X2+V VOLDO USEFUL DEMON ELBOW DOWN TOWARDS+H One of the stranger looking characters in the game is Voldo, but once his Demon Elbow is mastered, Voldo becomes one of the stronger fighters in the game. Competent at all ranges, the Italian Retainer is a good choice for the intermediate player. LONG RANGE DOWN+H+V DEMON ELBOW SHORT RANGE DEMON ELBOW SuulZHE PLAYER'S GUIDE FLOATING UPPERCUT H X3 (OR KX3) DOWN TOWARDS+K USEFUL DOWN+K DOWN TOWARDS+K Lightning fast combos and close quarter combat is what you have to master with the Kunoichi, Taki. Though she has little in terms of long range attacks, she has multi-height combinations that she can employ once in close. A very good choice for the competent player to move on to. LONG RANGE TOWARDS X2 +V OR H+K SHORT RANGE TOWARDS + H VX5 FLOATING UPPERCUT HX2 DOWN TOWARDS+V LITTLE JUMPING SLASH SOPHITIA USEFUL FREEPLAY DOWN TOWARDS+ VX5 (AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE V AFTER THE H IS TO USE A THROW.) Voted the players' choice in Japan, Sophitia has what it takes be up there with the big boys and you should have no problem in dispatching Cervantes/Soul Edge with her. With a little practice, this Greek flower blossoms into a killing machine! LONG RANGE AWAY+V SHORT RANGE UP TOWARDS+K K,H OR V 12 "


"computer VIDEO games FLOATING UPPERCUT X2 NUT STOMP LITTLE JUMPING SLASH SIEGFRIED USEFUL KNACKER SMASHER (VX3) NUT STOMP LITTLE JUMPING SLASH LONG RANGE Though he may look young in appearance, don't underestimate this German fighter's skill. He is primarily a long distance fighter, but he has short range moves a plenty, and can be a very good choice for both novices and masters alike. TOWARDS+V SHORT RANGE KNACKER SMASHER OR AWAY+V HV FLOATING UPPERCUT HX3 STOMP LITTLE JUMPING SLASH HWANG USEFUL VX2 H DOWN+H STOMP Basically a tarted-up Mitsurugi, Hwang can be used in exactly the same way but has a slight advantage as he tends to have a quicker recovery time. He also has his own set of special moves and these can be used to your advantage when fighting a Mitsurugi player. LONG RANGE SOUL DHE AWAY TOWARDS KOR AWAY +H SHORT RANGE DOWN+K FLOATING UPPERCUT HX3 DOWN TOWARDS+H+V PLAYER'S GUIDE CERVANTES USEFUL DOWN TOWARDS+H+V The human half of the game's boss has the moves to go with his position. His moves may look deceptively slow, but be warned, he recovers very quickly and only the faster characters like Li Long and Taki have a chance of countering. LONG RANGE OR AWAYX2 +V ORTOWARDS +H SHORT RANGE ALTERNATIVE ENDINGS * TAKI Hold down G+H+towards when her kitchen knife snaps, for the good ending * HWANG For Hwang's alternative finish, press G+H when the borders disappear (after he picks up the Soul Edge). * VOLDO Voldo is an odd one as his ending doesn't really change that much. If you want to see it, press all the buttons as well as the directional key when the borders disappear. Each originally selectable character has an alternative ending and these can be accessed by using the codes for each character below! * SOPHITIA Press G+H while she's walking in the woods and you get to see her other ending! * SEUNG MINA Continuously tap G+H when the movie bars are lifted to see her other ending. FREEPLAY * ROCK When the borders during his ending lift, tap G+H+towards for his second ending. * LI LONG After he falls to the ground during his ending, tap G+H like a rabid monkey to get his good ending. * MITSURUGI To access Miturugi's ending, you must kill Tanegashima by side-stepping the first bullet and then running like mad towards him and then slash him when he is in range. * SEIGFREID Hold down G+H after he picks up the Soul Edge. * CERVANTES Hold down G+H+towards during his ending. 13 "
