"NADIIN INTERTON INTERFACE Dear Sir I own an Interton VC4000 video games console marketed in the UK by Hanimex Ltd. Could you please inform me whether it is, or will be, possible to in some way connect (via an interface or other means), the console handsets to the Sinclair ZX Spectrum which I have just purchased. Gary Wilson, Colchester, Essex. Editor's reply: Most of the joystick interfaces sold are sticks with two potentiometers inside. If the Interton sticks are this type, then its just a matter of making sure that the wires go to the correct pins. Details should be provided with each interface. record and film had adopted the same attitude as Atari, I very much doubt if there would have been any Bros. Warner to own Atari in the first place. Atari v Imagic. Atari must be daft if they think we can't tell the difference between Demon Attack and Phoenix. If there is any similarity then it's probably because they can't fit arcade Phoenix into the Atari's memory. What's more, I'm getting sick and tired of Atari chucking writs at everybody. If they don't cut it out, I'm not going to buy any more of their products. Intellivision cartridges are cheaper anyway. So there. Interesting bit of news that. Just one thing. Didn't I write and tell you about them six or seven months ago? Deke Roberts, Temple Cowley, Oxford. Editor's reply: But we had to wait until they were about to come out Deke! Still, thanks for your views. Dear Sir, I am writing to you concerning the letter you published in your May edition from Iain Reddick of Kirkaldy, Fife, about C Tech's Krazy Kong. I would just like to say that I totally agree with him. I also believe that the advert is meant to be misleading. Sometimes I find it impossible to load the 48K version, but when I do I never seem to be able to reach the final stage as every time I complete a stage I lose a life and, I assume, return to the beginning. Could this be a bug? The game is very very fast and definitely unplayable. I too waited for over a month for my copy to arrive and have also decided to return it to C Tech with a letter of complaint. M. Yates, Ilkeston, Derbyshire. Spectrum is about - which seems very fair, but nearly all Atari cassette games are nearer or over the  mark which I am sure many other Atari 400/800 owners think is extravagant. One of the reasons I bought the Atari computer was for its graphic capabilities and I now find that I can't afford games at these prices. Have you or any other Atari 400/800 owners any views on the matter? I think the Atari computers have been out long enough for games prices to be lowered considerably. Eddie Mitchell, London, NW9. Editor's reply: Thanks for your comments Eddie. I agree that Atari software is not so superior to other micros that it justifies these large prices. Perhaps other Atari owners will give us their views. ATTACK ON ATARI!

OVERPRICED CARTRIDGES Dear Sir, I am an owner of a ZX Spectrum and find that the sound or lack of it irritates me more than anything else. But now I have discovered a way of amplifying the sound through the cassette recorder. The sound coming from the computer is still present but additional sound comes from the cassette recorder. To amplify the sound through the cassette recorder, the Spectrum's ear plug should be plugged into its socket on the machine. The other earplug should be plugged into the MIC socket of the cassette recorder. The cassette recorder is then set to play and, then PAUSED via a pause button on the cassette recorder. The sound output from the cassette recorder can now be controlled using the volume control. This ability to increase the Spectrum sound improves all games where sound plays a prominent part and at times can even improve scores. Sarbjit Gidda, Spondon, Derby. Dear Sir, I am writing to complain through you to some of the large Atari 400/800 software producers. I have had my computer for about nine months and have only been able to purchase two games cartridges due to the really high prices that are charged for these items.

Computer & Video Games is sponsoring the Golden Joysticks Awards which we hope will become the Oscars of our games industry. This is your chance to nominate a company which has given you good service or earn due recognition for a game which has provided hours of enjoyment. We feel our industry is crying out for quality games to be rewarded and hope it will give our software houses something to aim for when they feel they have come up with a winning idea. In America the Arkies Awards tend to go to US software companies and we felt it was time that the best of British was given the chance to prove itself. A C&VG Golden Joystick will be awarded in five categories and announced during the Brainwave consumer electronics exhibition in November. The five Joysticks will be awarded as follows: Best Arcade-style Game goes to the cassette or cartridge which proves itself the most addictive and thrilling game in 1983. Best Strategy Game is the title bestowed on the finest cassette or cartridge to test the mind rather than the trigger-finger. The Best Original Game Idea is an award close to the heart of anyone who has written as many Pacman reviews and news stories as I have. I hope the award inspires companies to introduce new ideas. Software House of the Year goes to the company which has won itself the Please accept the following nominations for the Golden Joystick Awards. best reputation for service, quality game and entertaining adverts. And finally the Game of the Year. the most coveted Golden Joystick awarded to the game which most impresses the judges. Initially we are leaving the judging up to you and want you to tell us your nominations in any or all of the categories. Don't feel you have to fill in a category where you have not seen anything worthy. For the title Software House of the Year, we will check out your suggestions with the dealers and also set some devious tests on the service side for the main contenders. And while the other Joysticks can only be won by British-based companies, we are leaving this category open to overseas distributors. We want your nominations in as quickly as possible. So please cut out the form below, fill in those categories where you feel strongly that a company deserves an award and send it off to: The Golden Joystick Awards, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JB. SPACE, THE LATE FINAL CROSSWORD! High scores abounded on the Delta Rocket to Venus as the crew whittled away at the headline of the last newspaper they saw on Earth. Since Trevor Truran launched the flight and the competition in our May issue, pictures of the ACME Spaghetti rocket filled with words reduced from the headline \"Major Venus Flight\" have been soaring into the office. Top scorer was Mrs J Dixon of Glebe Road, Wickford in Essex with 1,260. Close on her heels was Gavin Copeland of Ceder Road, Ayre with 1,200 and K Austin of Meades Lane, Chesham Bucks with 1,180. To these three we are sending a Milton Bradley board game. We are undertaking to provide games cassettes for your home computer if you can beat Trevor Truran's devious dice problem on page 96 of this issue.

"TION COMPETITION COMPETITION CO THE ELECTRONS ON FOR BUG-BYTE into the C&VG offices by July 16th. An added bonuse, if any of the top 20 entries are considered good enough by Bug-Byte, is that they will produce and market the game, paying royalties to the authors. As runners-up prizes, five entrants will be offered two software cassettes from the Bug-Byte range of BBC, Spectrum, ZX81, Oric and Vic games. See the panel below for details of how to enter and the competition rules. If you'd seen as many space invaders come and go as our Bugs have, you too would be longing for a new kind of game. They've been haunted by the ghosts of long dead Pacmen until they were sick of power pills; swooped on by untold Galaxians and Scrambled more craft against mountainsides than they care to remember. At a recent meeting of the League of Blasted Bugs, it was unanimously decided to get right to the heart of the problem of original computer games ideas by asking Computer & Video Games readers to write in and tell us about the games they would like to see on their computers. Give your ideal game a title and that all-important theme. Explain how the game would run, the objectives and where the skill comes in. And who better than Bug-Byte, one of Britain's best established computer games companies to act as patrons for this foray into unexplored gaming territory.

"ATARI VCS OWNERS INCREASE THE PL AYING POWER OF YOUR ATARI 2600 vcs BY UP TO 50 TIMES THE NEXT DIMENSION IN VIDEO GAMES Supercharger WHAT IS THE SUPERCHARGER? The Supercharger plugs directly into the cartridge slot of your Atari VCS to increase its game game playing power. With special digital electronics, it multiplies the VCS RAM memory by 49 times, from 128 to 6272 bytes. The Supercharger is unique, in that it can STARVATH that have been recorded on standard audio cassette tapes. These are easier and less expensive to develop and market than plug-in cartridges and cost considerably less! The Supercharger is supplied with a standard cable and jack plug which will plug into the earphone socket of any domestic cassette tape recorder. Supercharger lets you play games with high resolution graphics, faster action, and far more complexity. With the extra memory provided by the Supercharger you will now be able to play superior games which could not normally run on an unadapted Atari VCS because of its memory limitations. MULTI LOAD GAMES For added complexity and depth Cassette tape allows Starpath to offer unique Multi Load games. Games like Dragonstomper and Escape from the Mindmaster include several loads' on one cassette. When you have finished the first part of a game, you can then Toad another program giving a different screen or type of game play, thus continuing the game in several distinct parts. This feature is particularly useful in adventure type games. Multi Load games offer complexity and depth that no conventional ROM cartridge game can currently compete with FREE CASSETTE .

For further details, complete and return the coupon below. PHASER PATROL (FREE! Phaser Patrol is a single load game which is FREE with the Supercharger unit. A space game, it has two screens, one featuring the intergalactic battlefield, (below left), and the other showing a Sector Map (below right). The game begins when the devious 'Dracons' launch a surprise attack and you belong to the force which must prevent them from reaching earth. The sector map enables you to warp-hop from one sector to another and it also tells you in what areas the Dracon ships are, so you will need to refer to it before you go into battle. As well as telling you the location of the Dracons, the map shows you where your starbases are, these can bail you out if you get into any trouble. When you have decided on the sector of Dracons to attack, you can go on to the second screen, the battlefield. On this screen you have a view of the vast galaxy ahead and a control panel to keep you informed of your position. A one player game, Phaser Patrol is a Buer Pural highly detailed action packed cassette.

As well as having nine difficulty levels and two speeds, Communist Mutants from Space (it's full title), has got several features which make it an exciting game cassette providing a variety of options.

Price: 14.30+VAT=.45 FIREBALL You are a juggler, and able to juggle anything from china plates to daggers! Your task in this Single Load game is to smash wall after wall of blocks as you juggle with red hot FIREBALLS! When the ball comes down from the top of your screen, catch it, and then release it back at the wall of blocks. You can score up to a million points! And, if you get to proficient at one pattern of blocks, there are another four to choose from! Up to 4 players can take part in this game and up to 6 fireballs can appear on the screen at once. Be sure you don't get burned! Price:14.30+VAT=.45 KILLER SATELLITES You are the only test pilot of the one rocket ship that can protect the earth from an alien attack of molten metal. The invasion has started, have you the courage and skill to save mankind? A Single Load game, Killer Satellites is for 1 player featuring 2 difficulty settings as well as a 'rapid fire' mode. Other features include: a fuel level indicator; a laser overheat monitor which indicates the temperature of your gun; a global radar scanner and an energy barrier, which can be used to protect you from some of the alien projectiles .... but not all of them! Price: 14.30+VAT=.45 83420 DILE SUU OCDE MISSON SUICIDE MISSION Your mission in this game is to shrink down, smaller than a speck of dust, to do battle with a deadly killer virus deep within a human body. Equipped with a microscopic submarine, head for an infection, perilously close to the heart, and towards a fight where you are heavily outnumbered. This is arterial warfare at it's finest. Fire at one of the many germs, and it divides into two. Fire again and the numbers increase once more. A 1 or 2 player game featuring protective shields and two different shooting styles, Suicide Mission has three difficulty options. Price: .30+VAT=.45 DRAGONSTOMPER Dragonstomper is one of Starpath's Multi-Load cassettes. An adventure game, you've been swept through a time tunnel, right back to the age of warlocks and wizardry. Your mission is to find the Amulet of the Druids. There are clues, but not all easy ones. There are peaceful lakes and forests as well as deadly perils and lurking somewhere is a very vengeful dragon. There are many rewards along the way, but few will reach the final goal. The MULTI LOAD feature gives you THREE seperate game segments, for longer, more challenging game play. Price:.91+VAT=.45 ESCAPE/MINDMASTER A Multi-Load cassette, your task in this game is to escape from the alien Mindmaster's laboratory, where he has held you as a specimen for study. To win your freedom, you must pass through six 3-D mazes, with each of them being more complex than the last. The first 5 mazes have problems to solve and some surprise intelligence tests. The sixth maze is something special! As this game is too complex to load into your Atari at one time, it loads in FOUR different sections, a feature of the extra play power of the Starpath MULTI LOAD cassettes.

"THE RUSSIAN GRANDMASTER but understand almost nothing about them. As an example of what Pioneer can a know about it. In world history, it will perhaps fall not far short in importance of the discovery of fire.\" Botvinnik's book, Computers, Chess and Long-range Planning, also appeared in 1968. It is a very complex mathematical representation of chess introducing a number of ideas such as a \"generalised exchange between different kinds of advantage (such as material and space), the attacking path of a piece, the intangible value of an attack, and the position estimate of a chess position (which indicates when a positional sacrifice may be advantageous). Although the original Russian title of this work meant literally \"An Algorithm for Chess\", the text is far more of a blueprint for a lifetime's study than an algorithm. 20 todos The most celebrated participant in the computer chess field is undoubtedly the Russian grandmaster Mikhail Botvinnik. Botvinnik was world champion from 1948 to 1963 with two one-year breaks, when he lost the championship first to Smyslov and then to Tal, only to win back the title in a return match a year later each time. Botvinnik was born in 1911 in the Ukraine and until his retirement a few years ago was a noted electrical engineer as well as a chess grandmaster. He attained the status of Soviet master as long ago as 1927 and first won the championship of the Soviet Union in 1931. He became well-known in the West with his joint first place at the Nottingham tournament in 1936. Botvinnik's career provides a bridge between the almost mythical days of Capablanca and Alekhine, 50 years ago and the computerised chess of today. NW A CAPTURED SKILL THE PIONEER Since his retirement from active play 10 years ago, Botvinnik has concentrated increasingly on the latter, preparing his program which is known as Pioneer. However, his interest goes back much further to a time when he was still a leading active player. As far back as 1968, Botvinnik gave a lecture in the Russian town of Vladimir in which he described a chess master in terms which have a strong computing flavour. \"A master in his play has two functions. First of all he functions as a calculating and solving mechanism because he has to consider the possible moves and analyse variations ... A second function is also very important one's ability to program oneself, to perfect one's individual program ... to modify it in a constant research for improvement and perfection. One can consider a player who gives due attention to this aspect as guiding himself by a definite program or algorithm.\" Botvinnik saw the development of an \"artificial intellect\" an electronic machine capable of playing chess -as a major problem. If it could be achieved, he said: \"I foresee an unprecedented period of popularity for the game. When an electronic machine has started playing chess and played it successfully this will be such a momentous event that every schoolboy will want to In April two years ago Botvinnik came to London to speak at the Advances in Computer Chess conference at Imperial College. (The next conference is scheduled for April 1984). In his lecture, Botvinnik stressed the need for a program to examine only a small number of positions at each turn (preferably only one) and to restrict the analysis for each move to approximately 50-60 well chosen positions in all, if master play were ever to be achieved. Thus the emphasis should be on selecting the positions to examine and evaluating them properly exactly the opposite approach to BELLE. Many experts believe that if Botvinnik's method of representing the master's positional and evaluative skill could be captured in a program, this would be a major step forward for computer chess. Sadly, after many years of development, Botvinnik's Pioneer has still not appeared except in experimental form, and it must be doubtful now that it ever will. Perhaps grandmaster chess is too complex a problem for the current state of the chess programmers' art certainly much more tangible success has been achieved by programs like BELLE which search huge trees of variations a b c d e f g h achieve with a complex position, Figure 1 shows a famous position which Botvinnik (white) reached against Capablanca at the Rotterdam tournament of 1938. White to move can now choose between two strong-looking options 1.NR5ch and 1.B-R3. Botvinnik's analysis at the time looked at 28 positions in total, with an average branching factor (number of moves considered in each position) of 1.13. Pioneer's analysis of the position looks at 40 positions with a branching factor of 1.05 and find the variation: 1. B-R3, QxB; (If 1. ...Q-K1; 2. Q-B7ch is strong) 2. N-R5ch, PxN; 3. Q-N5ch, K-R1; 4. QxNch, K-N1; 5. P-K7, Q-B8ch; 6. K-B2, Q-Q7ch; 7. KN3, Q-K6ch; 8. K-R4, and now White wins in all variations, e.g. 8... Q-K8ch; 9. KxP, Q-K7ch; 10. K-R4, Q-Kich; 11. K-R3, Q-Koch; 12. P-N3. It is easy to believe that BELLE would also have found this variation, but it might have needed to examine tens of thousands of positions to do so! If you want to know more about Botvinnik's method, his 1981 conference paper is published in Advances in Computer Chess 3, edited by MRB Clarke (Pergamon Press, 1982) -but beware, it is far from easy reading!

"DONKEY KONG JNR im nu met het ongeveer prettig To be hones we PA WA 0,0 12.6. 14, 1, ON 0 0 Surprising how heroes suddenly become villains in the arcade world. Take Mario for example. There he was in Donkey Kong playing the gallant knight in a boiler suit racing to save the fair maiden from the clutches of our favourite giant gorilla. But here in the sequel to that memorable battle of wits Mario has become the villain. He has caged poor old Kong and refuses to let him go. So little Kong Junior sets out to rescue his dad. Donkey Kong Junior has to climb vines to reach the cage and rescue his Hlustrious father. But there are nasty jungle crea. tures called Snappers which dash around attempting to knock little Kong off. kong can jump over the Snappers as long as he is facing them. Then there is the nasty bird which will also attempt to prevent Kong completing his mission. On the second third and fourth levels fruits appear. Kong can leap at these and send them plummeting to the jungle floor if they hit a bird or a Snapper then 100 points will be added to your score. The number of Snappers increases each time Donkey Kong Junior manages to rescue his dad. To climb a vine you must position Kong Junior right beneath it, and move it. You cannot leap on to a vine. Control keys are: \"5\"=left, \"X\"=right, \"6\"=down, \"7\" =up, \"V\" or \"N\"=jump.

The object is to shoot down as many targets within one minute as you can. Each target is worth 100 points â and if you shoot down all nine you'll be rewarded with a 500 point bonus and another crack at the game. However, each time you win an extra go the time limit gets shorter. The targets are represented by the numbers 1-9. They appear at random among a \"battlefield\" of blocks. If you hit a block with a blast from your laser gun instead of a target number you will lose 10 points â and valuable time.

"You'll have to get the point quickly if you want to survive the deadly alien spikes! The aim of the game is to defend the top layer of a 20 level grid from these nasty spikes which will zap you with electricity should they reach your laser base. The spikes radiate from the centre of the screen and gradually move towards you â rising through the many levels. You move about on the top level ready to blast the spikes using a joystick controller. When you are directly above a spike fire! Points are scored for each spike shot â more points are awarded for a rapid destruction of a spike. Once shot they fall back to the centre to start rising up at you once more. As the game progresses the spikes get faster and more numerous and are worth more points. Beware â sometimes a spike will rise up in the middle of the screen where you will not be able to see it So you will have to keep alert.

And for you, the commander of the city defence systems this forecast means a busy time ahead. To fend off the meteor showers you are armed with missiles and a defence shield which covers the city area. Only one missile can be launched at each meteor, and they are programmed to explode near the falling lumps of rock â a direct hit may not destroy a meteor. You may use your defence shield for periods of just 10 seconds at a time which gives you a chance to stop the destruction of your city should a meteor slip past your missiles.

"Whether it is one program in a year or one a month, they know that when they buy from THE MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE CLUB they are buying the best programs at the best prices. BOUGHT ANY INTERESTING CASSETTE BOXES LATELY LARGE SAVINGS ON TOP SOFTWARE All programs are, at least, 10% cheaper than normal and, each month, the best of the most recent software is made available to members at 20% less than normal. Postage and packing is free on orders of two or more programs for delivery within the UK; ordering and payment are simple, and quality is guaranteed. FREE NEWSLETTER The Microcomputer Software Club exists to help home micro users to buy good programs not pretty boxes. Advertisements and clever packaging can make the worst programs appear tremendous. It is not until you have 'gambled' your money that you discover how good they really are. Some are only slightly different to others you may already own; many are not as good as you would be entitled to expect; and others are just a complete waste of money. Of course, there are some excellent programs around, and many more appear each month. Many thousands of home micro users now find out about them easily, safely and regularly. In addition, they are able to buy them at really low prices. They are all members of the Microcomputer Software Club. Our latest Newsletter offers programs from most leading suppliers and from a few that, perhaps, you do not yet know. A program has to be good, very good, before it is recommended to members. It also has to be reliable and, even before the members' discount, it has to be good value for money. Subject coverage includes adventure, arcade, education, strategy games, household applications, family games, business, utilities and programming aids. CLUB EXPANDS TO INCLUDE COMMODORE 64 AND ORIC USERS FREE MEMBERSHIP Membership of the Microcomputer Software Club would save you money and trouble. Each month we thoroughly test and evaluate the many programs issued by the growing number of producers including IJK, Bug-Byte, A & F, Campbell, C-Tech, Imagine, Lothlorien, DJK, Salamander, Bridge, and the smaller companies that you may find it difficult to keep track of. If a program is good, and it has got to be very good, it is recommended to our members in the next issue of the Newsletter. Two excellent new machines have just been added to our coverage the Commodore 64 and the Oric. Software for these machines will be in our next Newsletter. Remember, membership is completely free of charge and you are under no obligation to buy anything from the Club unless you really want to. If you use a ZX81 (16k), Spectrum (16k or 48k), BBC (A or B), Dragon 32, Vic (expanded or unexpanded), Commodore 64 or Oric, you should join THE CLUB. NO OBLIGATION Members are not obliged to buy a fixed number of programs from The Club. They buy what they want when they want.

"BY S. MURDIE 1 RAGON Can you get Willie Worm into the safety of his hole before hissing Sid Snake catches him and invites him to join him for lunch. Willie is on the menu! Willie has to get back to his hole using a series of ladders but slippery Sid can do without these and pursues the weary worm at a frighteningly fast speed. In dire emergencies Willie can call on his amazing ability to teleport out of harms way. But the number of times he can use this talent is limited so they must be used with care. Can you keep the snake from the worm's door? Or is Willie doomed? Full instructions are included in the program. So worm your way out of this one if you can!

"BY G. BECK 4RAGON Remember City Bomb the game that featured in a very early issue of Computer and Video Games? Well it's back bigger and better and for the Dragon 32. You control a plane steadily losing height above a skyscraper city. The only way you will be able to land safely is to clear a landing strip by bombing the buildings flat! If you manage to land safely the city is rebuilt with taller buildings presenting you with a tougher challenge. It's a very addictive version of this classic game, making good use of sound and colour graphics. Full instructions are included in the program.

BARRINGTON IN 1K GOLF 32 This is a variation on the usual golf programs in that you don't have to battle your way around an entire course before you get to chip the ball into the hole! You'll find yourself on the green ready to play your final stroke. The green is presented on screen and the position of the ball in relation to the hole is shown. You have to guess the distance and type it in. If you miss the green is represented and you get another chance. If you are successful another green is drawn up. The number of the green you are playing and a running total of your score are displayed on the screen. Simple but nearly as frustrating as the real thing.                  :    DOPOAQQOOOOOOWWOOD 00 00 00 00 00 OUTON 1 REM \"GOLF\" 1 LET HOPI PI 11 LET SERIEP TOND 121 +16 (RND *121 +16 40 PRINT AT 21,0; \" 50 NEXT J FOR JEZ+2 TO 31 PRINT AT 21.

"BY K. WARDLE RUNS ON A BBC MOLLL A IN 16K The alien space craft swoops low over the planet. The captain is looking for a dropping zone for the passengers of his craft a bunch of happy aliens on a day trip who didn't realise that when the tour company said they would be dropped off somewhere they'd be dropped, off on parachutes! Still you have to make the best of things and here come the daytrippers leaping out into the great unknown. The good news is that there's someone to meet them when they land -with a net to help break the fall ... Your job is to help catch the little chaps as they drop down toward the pianet. You are armed with a nei and are allowed just 12 misses before the space-trippers start worrying. The ship will gradually get lower as time goes on So you'll have less time to catch the falling aliens. You can vary the speed of the ship, the rate of descent of the ship, and the speed the aliens whizdown toward you as you get better at the ame. ne controls are simple; up=F1, down-F3, left-CRSRup/down, right=CRS left/righ.. 10 *TV255 20 *KEY1 | MG. 70:M 30 MODE7 40 VDU23: 8202:0:0:0: 50 DIM T%C5) 60 PROCT 70 PROCS 80 REPEAT 90 REPEAT 100 PROCM 110 PROCW 120 PROCY 130 PROCM 140 PROCN 150 PROCZ 160 F=F%+1 170 UNTILG%=0 OR F2=0% 180 IF G%<=0 THEN 250 199 F%=0 OD 210 "

"Attack Of The Short of ideas for games? Then why not try to pick the brains of science fiction authors.

Some mathematical problems are deceptively simple. The famous fourcolour problem was to prove that any map you draw can be coloured, using no more than four colours, so that no two adjacent countries on the map are coloured the same. Sounds simple.

"needed 1500 hours of computer time! But why a camel? I'm coming to that! Another simple-seeming puzzle is known as the travelling salesman problem: you can vary it from country to country but it's usually put like this. A salesman wants to tour the USA by the shortest route which visits the capital city of every state. What route should he take? This one tends to surprise people by erupting into much bigger numbers than expected, and you find that computers would require endless years to examine all the possible routes. (My calculator says 3x1064 routes for 50 cities. Work that out assuming the computer considers one a second, or one a nanosecond.) However, you always knew you were brighter than a computer, and this is where the camels come in. When you key in this simple game program, camels start appearing about the screen, and by use of the arrow keys you steer a rather disgusting caterpillar-like ship into collisions which wipe out the galactic camels one by one. If your lightning brain is up to it, you should be able to pick efficient camel-destroying routes which waste minimum time. For every second you waste allows more camels to appear from the sinister depths of the hyperspatial deserts. Naturally, as this is a cruel universe we live in, it doesn't stay that easy. From time to time, Galactic Pest Control checks up on you to make sure a Spectrum, but when I poked the keys it felt just like squashing small dead sea creatures, and I fled screaming.) It doesn't have to be treated as a perfect and polished program, and can be tinkered with as much as you like. A few examples: Prefer boring old space invaders to my fresh, exciting, vibrant camels? Then alter the graphics in line 40 â say to CHR$(166) + CHR$(167)+CHR$(132).  Want the camels to appear less frequently to begin with? Give KC in line 110 to a bigger value. Want Galactic Pest Control to check up more often, or less? The 0.03 in line 370 is the probability that wiping out any given camel will trigger a Galatic Pest Control scan. Want to alter the permitted Number Of Camels Left On screen? The current figure allowed is the 12 in line 2060. Do the camels eventually start coming too ridiculously fast for you? The 10 in line 2080 is the minimum number of game cycles between camel appearances, and you can easily substitute a bigger number. (A game cycle is the time taken for the \"ship\" to move one unit.) Want to rewrite the game so totally and brilliantly that my own puny efforts will be shown up for the empty, worthless stuff that they are? OK, but you're on your own! A version of this travelling salesman\" problem appears quite irrelevantly â in connection with star travel in Robert Heinlein's latest effort Friday. The book is however rather low on camels. Why camels? I thought you'd never ask. Because, er, because no, I'm sorry. Another of the things you learn from science fiction is that There Are Riddles Of The Universe Which Mankind Can Never Hope To Solve. Interstellar travel and galactic camels are among these.

"The Blooding AEILRIC BLOODAXE Have you ever bought a program that failed to live up to its promises? Worse still a computer which defied the advertisement copy and refused to reveal its secrets...even refused to turn up for four months. Computer people are traditionally slow to complain, they expect to be kept waiting and they've been reared on promises and launch dates that turned into \"early production difficulties\" and distribution problems\". But the C&VG postbag is gradually swelling with complaints from readers and the feeling is that while most computer manufacturers are now making an effort not to mislead prospective purchasers, some software houses are still not living up to their promises. Sooner or later the wheat will be sorted from the chaff but to speed that day along, C&VG is going to come down hard on cassettes and cartridges which are not up to standard. But we need your help. If you have bought anything from the computer industry which has really made you angry then put your thoughts on paper. The column is titled \"Great Software Disasters\" but you can write in about computers (as Keith Ollett has done this month) peripherals, computer books, or anything which has angered you. For further details on how to make your views felt read the panel below. It may sound as though Great Software Disasters is going to be the most destructive page so far unleashed on the computer industry. But my hope is that it will be welcomed by: those software houses who are striving to keep quality high. Those who have confessed to me in quiet corners that they do release the odd bad game because they know some un scrupulous rival would make a fortune from it if they turned it away. Those manufacturers who believe bad software or peripherals reflect on their computer And those of you who have suffered. Aeilric Bloodaxe is a delightful way to start off this column, because it tempers some hard-hitting criticism with humour and the feeling that Keith is going to end up very close to Aeilric in the end. Oric too deserve credit for their positive response to the piece and the help they have since offered Keith. OR LEARNING TO LIVE WITH AN ORIC who are Waiting for Oric. The sleepless nights, the phone engaged for days on end, the bedwetting, the eternal promise of delivery next week, the damnable \"Fur Elise\" everytime the Oric switchboard put me on Hold. Friends jeered at me in the street, \"Has Eric arrived yet?\" I lost my appetite, stopped shaving, wore the same tie two days in a row, my work was suffering. On February 19th, Eric arrived. The time since then has not been dull. Because of the placid and predictable nature of the Oric Extended Basic (v 1.0), Eric was soon changed to Aeilric Boodaxe, somehow the name seems more appropriate. It is my firm opinion that those who produce user manuals without indexes should be smothered at birth, or at least debarred from the company of honest and trusting folk. Compassion for the less privileged forbids me from offering an opinion on those who punctuate manuals with infantile and unhelpful cartoons. Two sheets of errata accompanied the manuals. The machine itself is a sturdy thing, not unpleasing to the eye, which makes it both useful and decorative. The keyboard has an unique feel (tactile feedback) and is optionally noisy; sadly, some keys are marred by a tendency to remain depressed. From cold start or power on or whatever, you eventually get a little message that tells you that you have ORIC EXTENDED BASIC V1.0 and there are 47870 BYTES FREE: if you enter PRINT FRE(O), you get 39421, which I am assured is the amount of memory available in bytes; but if you enter GRAB followed by PRINT FRE(0) you still only get 46588 bytes free and I thought this was supposed to be a 48K machine (which, according to my abacus, is 49152 bytes). Someone has been misled. It is a sad comment on Life or Death or something, that the April issues of some computer magazines are still carrying advertisements which promise 16 colours on a 16K machine delivered in 28 days and while I'm at it, is it honest to describe 240 x 200 pixels as high resolution? Oric Basic is an idiosyncratic little dialect, related on the distaff side to Microsoft. In some respects it is a lazy and sensuous thing, it does not insist on LET for variables, or arrays of less than 10 to be DIMmed, and will quite happily accept PRINTing without semicolons. You may have read that PLOT replaces PRINT AT but this is not so. Ernest Peabrain was a ZX81, he lasted about four months, changed his name to Beanbrain when he was expanded to 4K and is on permanent sabbatical leave giving novices Hands On ExperiIf you have a genuine grievance about any computer industry product write in to Great Software Disasters, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, Herbal Hill London EC1R 5JB.

Hers is the keyboard I know best, for all its clatter. At the last count, I had about six Basic dialects and three Forth. Jezebel has everything I want from a computer except a decent keyboard, colour and three channel sound. I admit I was beguiled by the Oric ads, the teaser articles in the computer press merely heated my ardour. Be still my dancing pulse! So, in late October, I ordered one. Well, the royalties Jezebel had earnt me would pay for it In calmer moments, I mused on the long and honourable pedigree of Tangerine, no new hot shot outfit this, sound expertise thought, sound financial backing, I thought. By now, your ears will have been filled with the woeful tales of those Illustration by Jon Davis 116 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"GREAT SOFTWARE DISASTERS programming tool is a large piece of paper and a pencil with a rubber on the end of it. It will be interesting to see the promised BBC-type Basic, will it be a true Structured Basic or just a less hastily produced Microsoft type perhaps with WHILE WEND. There are a number of reserved words buried in the Basic but not mentioned in the manual, one begins JO and an INVERSE lurks in there somewhere. The omission of VERIFY is almost criminal, given Aeilric's unreliability when saving programs even at 300 baud (super safe), and the lack of file writing reading commands will surely place immense restrictions on its applications. I am frankly disappointed in the Oric. Its Basic seems a hastily produced thing, as is the manual. The advertising and brochures have been misleading and at times dishonest. The telesales staff have had to spend months covering for this ill-conceived product by promising delivery soon. I could not in honesty recommend this machine to a beginner and an experienced user would be better advised to buy a more thoughtfully produced and supported product, even if he or she would have to buy a decent keyboard, or save up for something further up market. CRI DE COEUR: Is there a manufacturer of popular home computers capable of honest publicity and realistic delivery dates? PLOT is a viper of a command which will creep into your tent if you let it. It is not easy to predict in which of the eight colours it will print a string, unless it is numeric, then it will be any colour you like (as long as you like green). The STR$ command is a joy and a delight. Get it to produce a string from an integer between 1 and 9 and it will produce a string two characters long! The first character being the deceitful CHR$(2) and the second your precious number, even if you prune off the deceitful CHR$, you will still turn green when you PLOT. Could a mere BEEB boast such sophistication? Getting Aeilric to produce all eight colours of foreground and background AND use double height and flashing characters is a challenge to the intellect perhaps equalled only to playing Towers of Hanoi while blindfolded and wearing boxing gloves. Incidentally, the Oric does not boast the full Teletext Alphamosaic character set. WARNING: Teethmarks on the casing may invalidate the guarantee. The SOUND, MUSIC and PLAY commands offer great scope for investigation. The Sound chapter of the manual is one of the more Byzantine chapters, omitting to give any examples of the SOUND command. Although there are three music channels spanning a magnificent six octaves it is not easy to get each music channel to do something different to the other two. Well, actually you can get it to do this once or twice, but you might be better employed with the screen display or playing Towers of Hanoi than attempting a three part arrangement of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring. Which is a pity, as I was looking forward to it. The on-board loudspeaker was very loud and turned the screen into porridge whenever it ZAPped or PINGed, sadly it turned dumb after three days, but it still blasts away through the Hi-Fi and I can control the volume on that. There is a current fashion for neat pot Basic (i.e. Structured Basic) as opposed to shambler Basic (what I write). There is a whole chapter devoted to this in the manual. Somehow I feel they would have been better employed compiling an index. Structure is fine if you have a BEEB or an MZ-80K with Hudson MegaBasic, but if your line length is restricted to around 80 characters you will be hardpushed to produce a sizeable program which is truly structured and running efficiently. I still maintain that the most useful Dear Mr Ollett I'm glad to say that things have changed since you wrote your piece about Aeilric no delivery problems and the manual is improved too (not least by the addition of an index). Oric have asked us to suggest that the best way of dealing with the problems you are experiencing is to make an appointment to see sales director Peter Harding. Now that they have closed down the mail order operation, you'll find it is child's play getting through to them. Just in case you need reminding the number is Ascot 27686 or 27575. If anyone else has Oric problems, please send the machines back to Oric (if purchased from them) for servicing (PO Box 162 Cambridge CB4 1PH) obviously this only applies to mail order customers. Anyone with a fault on an Oric bought in a shop should sent it or take it back to where it was purchased with the request that it is tested by that company's experts and, if necessary, returned to Oric via them. Our thanks for cheering up post-opening time, Mr Ollett we do hope you come to love and enjoy Aeilric Bloodaxe. Judith Patten. On behalf of Oric. "

"DEFENDER ELIMINATED: Attacker scores more than 5. ATTACKER ELIMINATED: Defender scores more than 5. DEFENDER RETREATS: Attacker scores 4 or 5, defender scores less. ATTACKER RETREATS: Defender scores 4 or 5, attacker scores less. BOTH MISS: Any other scores. OUTCOMES RULES OF COMBAT Prior to combat, the attacker and defender are awarded points. 1. They are allocated points as described in Part 2, including points for being adjacent to the General. 2. Pieces behind a boulder are awarded an extra point at the three hex range. 3. Pieces close to a boulder which is not exactly between the attacker and defender may or may not receive an extra point. 4. Garrison walls are similar to boulders and provide the same cover. COMBAT TABLE To determine the outcome, the computer selects a number from one to six for the attacker and for the defender if he is returning the fire. If he is not returning the fire, the defender is given one point. To these scores are added the points awarded above. The outcome is shown in the table. A-RET:The attacker is forced to retreat 1 hex away from the direction of the defender. The directions in which the attacker may move are shown at the bottom of the screen. If none is available, the attacker is eliminated automatically. If the combat was at 1 hex range, the defender will flicker \"ADVÂ». If \"Y\" is pressed, he may move into the hex vacated by the attacker. The following rules apply with regard to the Flag: 1) If the attacker occupies the Flag hex, he must retreat without the Flag. 2) The defender may advance into the empty Flag hex. This must be a winning condition since only an In| dian may advance into the Flag hex. 3) The General or a Trooper may retreat into the Flag hex; Indians may not 4) The man occupying the Flag hex may advance with the Flag.

"that is, looking for the silly errors that clobber the whole of memory and secondly, ensuring that the logic is correct. It helped a great deal to write the code in Basic first and then translate it. Note that the attacker is given subscript 1 and the defender subscript 0. First, Y is set to 1 and all attacker information is saved. A similar set is then prepared for the defender i.e.: Having decided whether the deHE Happy Hunting Grounds or Boot Hill get ready to receive casualties when the computer goes into its combat routine. In the final article in this Warpath series, we look at how the computer analyses a battle. Last month I left you halfway through the combat sequence and slightly up in the air. Prior to that, you had always been able to type in the code and at least be able to check it by running the program. Last month this was not possible. The search routine is called in line 1230 and it may be wise to omit the statement K9=USR(O), while you test the rest of the program. When writing the routine I had to set up very elaborate routines to debug it. Normally, these consist of first, getting the code under control Attacker KB(1) KS(1) KT(1) G(1) KV(1) KQ(1) Defender KB(0) KS(0) KT(0) GO) KV(0) KQ(1) IBOARD location Video location Character type Character Memory location \"Man in Flag hex\" flag. The figure below describes the lines within the Combat sequences. Follow this through with the coding. Lines 1320 to 1500, however, require more explanation. Once an attack has been determined, a table is set up (see lines 180 and 50). fender will (or can) return fire, the combat points are calculated (See line 280), N(Y) accumulates the points. RANGE (in Basic) is used to test whether a trooper is next to the General for an extra point. Note also how Y is used to calculate who gets the benefit of cover. Ron Potkin takes to the Warpath for the last time and deals with the rules of combat (left) and the final piece of programming. If you have had any problems with the series please write in. Figure 1 740 : Clear attack flags. Obtain location of each piece in turn. Gosub] COMBAT. 1230/40 COMBAT : Display WINDOW. Put Index in SK, SP into SS and BL in SB and call X$(16) RANGE. if there are no attackers, return for next piece. Calculate K7 â number of defenders at 1 hex range. If zero and man is a tomahawk, attack is not possible return. 1250/80 LETTER : Print letters against defenders, but make sure tomahawks only fight at one hex. 1290 AUTO : If there is only one attack at 1 hex (variable L2) combat is automatic so prompting is not necessary. Goto TEST. 1300/1310 WHO : Flicker for decision and check input. 1320 TEST : Test input some more and set up table. 1330 REPLY : If defender has already fired or he is a tomahawk being attacked at greater than 1 hex range, he cannot reply. If distance is 1 hex, others must reply. 1340/50 RTN : Prompt for return of fire. If he returns, determine his defence points and set attack flag in PTABLE so that he cannot reply again. 1360 : Calculate attacker's points. 1370 ODDS : Calculate result using C4 the ODDS table. 1380 : Remove letters from screen. 1390 : Whatever will be will be. 1400 : Update BIGSCREEN and return to line 740. 1410 A-ELM 1430 A-RET 1440 MISS 1450 D-RET 1460 D-ELM 1480 BOTH eliminated. 1500 ADVANCE: If 1 hex range, winner may advance. Finally, line 300 prints the points on the screen and adds to N(Y) a random number from 1 to 6. We can now calculate the result using the ODDS table, C4, and print it on the screen using the routine at 1700. The elimination in lines 1410, 1460 and 1480 are handled by subroutine 170. Retreats are carried out by line 1510. These are again controlled by Y=0 or Y=1. This is the seventh and last in the Warpath series. When you have entered this month's code, you will have a working game up and running, ready for you to take over either the cavalry or the indians and lead them to victory against your computer. You will also have a complete set of rules and hopefully a full knowledge and understanding of the workings of this program. Warpath has been in such detail so you can convert it to your own machine and you can take elements of the listing and use them in your own wargames. It has been fun writing this series and I hope you have enjoyed following it. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 121 "


"MACHINE CODE CALL PO, address (call if Parity Odd, je., if P/O flag clear) CALL PE, address (call if Parity Even, i.e., if P/O flag set) CALL P, address (call if Positive, i.e., if S flag clear) CALL M, address (call if Minus, i.e., if S flag set) When you use the conditional CALL instructions the subroutine will be executed only if the relevant condition is satisfied, otherwise the processor will skip to the next instruction after the CALL instruction. The 280 also has a similar set of return instructions: RET RET NZ RET Z RET NC RET C RET PO RET PE RET P RET M CALLING ALL THOSE GOSUBS! Planning a series of GOSUBs which call one another up is usually one of the first lessons and early thrills of Basic programming. But how does a machine code program find its way through the GOSUBs and RETURNs which still make up a large chunk of every program? Last month I looked at the idea of using the subroutines built into the computer's ROM. This article will tackle assembly language instructions associated with subroutines and the mechanism used by the microprocessor to keep track of subroutine calls and returns. The instructions for subroutine calls and returns in machine code work similarly to Basic but the call is to a memory address instead of to a line number Executing a subroutine call makes the microprocessor continue execution with the instruction at the address specified in the call instruction, and a return instruction makes the microprocessor go back to the instruction following the subroutine call. The 6502 has only one subroutine call instruction, JSR, which can be used only with absolute addressing, and a corresponding return instruction, RTS. The 6809 has three subroutine call instructions; BSR and LBSR, which are used with relative addressing and take one-byte and two-byte offsets respectively; and JSR, which can be used with extended, direct page, and all indexed addressing modes. The return instruction is RTS, but there is also another way to perform a return, which we will look at later. The 280 subroutine call instructions all use absolute addressing. The instructions available are: CALL address (call unconditionally) CALL NZ, address (call if NonZero, i.e., if Z flag set) CALL Z, address (call if Zero, i.e., if Z flag set) CALL NC, address (call if No Carry, ie, if C flag clear) CALL C, address (call if Carry, i.e., if C flag set) BY TED BALL STACKING IN STRUCTURE In order to be able to get back to the right instruction after executing a subroutine the microprocessor has to save the return address somewhere. The 6502, 6809 and 280 all use the same principle for saving the address, but the details differ. The method for saving return addresses uses a data structure called a stack, in which new items are always put onto the end of the stack and stored in the order they were put, or pushed, onto the stack, and items taken, or pulled, from the stack come in the reverse order to which they were pushed. This allows subroutine calls inside subroutines to work properly, with a return always going back to the instruction following the last subroutine call executed. The terminology for a stack can be confusing; the last item pushed onto a stack is called the top of stack, but the three microprocessors add to the stack downwards in memory, so the top of stack\" is actually at the lowest address. When a subroutine call is executed the microprocessor stores the return address in the two bytes at the address referenced by the Stack Pointer register (SP in the 6502 and 280 and S in the 6809), and decreases the Stack Pointer by two. A return instruction does the opposite, increasing the stack pointer by two and putting the two-byte return address into the Program Counter. The three microprocessors also have some instructions that may be regarded as special types of subroutine calls. The 6502 instruction BRK (Break) saves the return address and the status register on the stack, and jumps to the address stored in addresses $FFFE and $FFFF. The 6809 has three \"Software Interrupt\" instructions, SWI, SWI2 and SWI3, that save the return address and all the processor registers except Stack Pointer S on the S stack and then jump to an address stored in high memory. SWI jumps to the address stored in $FFFA and $FFFB, SW12 jumps to the address stored in $FFF4 and $FFF5, and SW13 jumps to the address stored in $FFF2 and $FFF3. The 280 has the \"Restart\" instructions RST O, RST 8, RST 10H, RST 18H, RST 20H, RST 28H, RST 30H, RST 38H, which are equivalent to CALL O, CALL 8, etc., but use only one byte instead of the three bytes for a CALL instruction. On ROM based computers the addresses used by these instructions will be in the ROM and will have been set up by the manufacturers. To use the instructions you will have to find out how they have been set up, either from the manual or from books and magazine articles on specific computers. As well as the stack being used automatically to keep track of subroutines there are instructions that allow you to push the processor registers onto the stack and pull from the stack into the processor registers. The 6502 has PHA, which pushes the accumulator onto the stack, PLA which pulls the top of stack into the accumulator, PHP which pushes the status register P onto the stack, and PLP which pulls the top of stack into the status register. The 6809 has two Stack Pointer registers, the hardware Stack Pointer S which is used for subroutines and interrupts, and the User Stack Pointer U. The push and pull instructions are PULS, PULU, PSHS, and PSHU, and the mnemonic must "


"MACHINE ICODE registers and the 280 does not have any 16-bit compare instructions. The routines can be made much simpler by marking the end of each message with an \"O\" instead of providing the length of the message. With these changes the \"print a message\" routines, where the message may be of any length, become: 6502 Calling sequence: MESSHI = MESSGE/256 MESSLO = MESSGE-256*MESSHI LDA MESSLO STA MESSAD LDA MESSHI STA MESSAD+1 JSR PRMESS BNE DONE JSR OUTCH BRA PRMESS DONE RTS There is another point that was skimmed over last month. We assumed that the routine OUTCH, which prints the character whose code is in the accumulator will not change the contents of registers. This is true in many computers, but not in all. However, we can ensure that none of the registers are changed by saving the registers on the stack before calling the ROM routine and restoring them afterwards. If we call the ROM routine that prints the accumulator PRINTA we can write OUTCH routines that preserve the registers as follows: 6502 OUTCH PHP STA TEMP PLA TXA TAY PHA PLA TYA TAX PHA LDA TEMP LDA TEMP PLP JSR PRINTA RTS be followed by a list of the registers to be pushed or pulled. Any combination of registers except the stack pointer for the stack being used may be pushed or pulled in one instruction. For example, we can have PSHS A PULS CC,PC PSHU PC,Y,X,DP PULU A,B,Y The order the registers are pushed onto the stack is PC, U or S, Y, X, DP, B, A, CC, and they are pulled in the reverse order. Although the assembly language allows you to list the registers in a push or pull instruction in any order the actual push or pull order is always the same. Note that including PC in the operand of a PULS instruction to pull a subroutine return address into the program counter does exactly the same as a RTS instruction, and this programming trick is often used to save putting in the RTS instruction. The 280 push and pull instructions all work with two bytes at a time. The instructions are PUSH BC. PUSH DE, PUSH HL, PUSH AF, PUSH IX, PUSH IY, POP BC, POP DE, POP HL, POP AF, POP IX, POP IY. When you are using subroutines and push and pull instructions you have to be careful to balance the number of bytes pushed and pulled between the execution of a subroutine call and the execution of the return. For example, if you begin a subroutine by pushing two bytes onto the stack and pull four bytes off the stack before the return, the extra two bytes will be the return address and when the return instruction is executed the processor will jump to whatever address happened to be in the two top bytes of the stack before the last subroutine call. We can now go back to last month's \"print a message\" routines. These routines were not written to be used as subroutines, so if you wanted to print several messages in a program you would have to repeat the whole code every time. As well as changing the routines so they can be used as subroutines there are other improvements. The 6502 and 280 routines last month were rather complicated as the 6502 does not have any 16-bit \"Print message\" subroutine: PRMESS LDY O NEXTCH BEQ DONE JSR OUTCH INC MESSAD BNE NEXTCH INC MESSAD+1 JMP NEXCH DONE RTS 280 Calling sequence: LD HL, MESSGE CALL PRMESS Z80 \"Print message\" subroutine PRMESS LD A, (HL) RET Z CALL OUTCH OUTCH PUSH AF POP IY PUSH BC POP IX PUSH DE POP HL PUSH HL POP DE PUSH IX POP BC PUSH IY POP AF CALL PRINTA RET 6809 OUTCH PSHU Y,X,DP,D,A,CC JSR PRINTA PULU CC, A,D,DP,X,Y RTS Note that we do not need to save S as the ROM routine must leave S unchanged after a subroutine call and return, and that we can put D in the push/pull list instead of A and B. INC HL JR PRMESS 6809 Calling sequence LDX MSSGE JSR PRMESS \"Print message\" subroutine PRMESS LDA ,X+ Before call instruction After call instruction High addresses Stack pointer Stack pointer = previous stack pointer 2 Two byte return address Low addresses "

STOCKINGS CLOTH ELEPHANT BELT MURDER PRINT BELL they SEPH FINGERS BIRD LIBBON Ett FEATHER ROC utrum UN EATHER ROOWY ngucamareraine SPIRIT Summer is now recognised medically as the most dangerous season for us members of the new species, fanaticus computicus. It is the time when those mere mortals we live alongside feel the urge to remove a large quantity of their outer clothing and leap about shouting \"thirty-fifteen\", \"Howzat Umpire\" and \"Mowed the lawn three times today!\" A strong urge comes upon us that we should also be doing something energetic and that the entire population is becoming fit around us. But take heed ... it can be fatal to kick the chair back and join in. A violent bout of croquet can ruin that typing finger. So here is a gentler way to move a few muscles, stimulate the brain, and so aid digestion. Copy our diagram, making the squares large enough to accommodate whatever size die your Monopoly set is supplied with. Place the cube in the top left square so that the 1 is on top and the 2 is facing you. In all standard dice the 3 will now be on the right. (Note: dice other than standard are not allowed!) A move is to roll the die by a quarter turn into an adjacent square, across or up or down â spinning diagonally over a corner is forbidden. After the move fill in the line you have just crossed with a pen. 711 ANYTHING TO DECLARE? These two passengers certainly have! Among the rather weird collection of items in each suitcase there are two which definitely do not belong with the rest. Can you deduce which pairs should be removed for inspection by the Customs Officer? Perhaps, too, you can state how these four contraband items are related to each other. QUICK WEIGH IN MATRON A 000/ OO OOO AA AA A D / Quite early into a recent hospital visit I was surprised by a request to hop on the scales and be weighed. I had duly hopped before I had even begun my mumbled reason for being there â a desperate attempt to unload about a tonne of unwanted Re****'s D****t into the ENT waiting area. And that explanation was cut short by a fearsome matron who burned me to a crisp with her acid enquiry as to whether always weighed myself with an overcoat on. It was some hours later that I realised what I should have done dismounted, carefully taken my coat off, folded it over one arm and stepped back onto the scales again! As it was I discarded the tonne and fled, taking some small consolation in sending, anonymously of course, this picture. If I have read her correctly it will take her some time to work out just how many TRIANGLES are needed to make the third pair of scales balance. Which should delay the processing of my sample for a week.

"LFC DeN MARGARET True As you proceed on this rolling tour of the board you will gradually complete the sides of the squares. When you draw a line which finishes a square put a number in itthat number being the value showing on top of the die at the time. The square just completed will either be the one the die is in or an adjacent square â occasionally you can complete two squares in one move; in which case enter the top die number into each square. There is only one restriction on movement: if possible you must roll so that a new line is drawn â you may only roll over a previously drawn line if there is no other choice. The exercise ends when you have completed every square and your effort can be measured by the sum of the scores in the 12 squares. + TWO ZERO THREE THREE THREE ELEVEN III 11111 III/ 111111 Ome H INNOIT TITTITUTENTICITATIITUMINUTITUITO METRIC RULE2 OK U TELEKTUKIO NLERIN A MANGLED MATHS MESS -+ ---+---When Paul Tutherwon gained his hatrick of detentions in one week (awarded for his believed frivolous calling out of \"mangle\" when asked to name one kind of angle) it was decided to make the punishment as ingenious as his classroom answers.

But, since there are ten letters being used and our counting system has ten digits, 0 to 9, he was asked to replace each letter by a digit and convert the diagram into a calid addition sum.

"CELLS 2.By SAD IN MY SPACE SUI MUCH MISERY IN SCOTT'S FUN HOUSE Rescue at Rigel appealed to me as a title, so I sent off for it, looking forward to an exciting sci-fi Adventure. When the game arrived I waited with eager anticipation for the cassette to load, entranced by the illustration of a scantily clad lady manacled to an alien machine, being menaced by an overgrown ant. Just behind the ant, blaster in hand, was Sudden Smith, our hero, clad in a space suit. That would be me, I thought. In the box with the cassette was a 32 page booklet. A quick perusal soon revealed that here was something very similar to Hellfire Warrior, (see C&VG, April '82), a Dunjonquest game. A list of single letter commands was given, and a background story describing the objective â explore a hollow asteroid base orbiting Rigel, and rescue human prisoners by pressing \"T\" to teleport them to a waiting space ship. How exciting! V sou In play the rooms were drawn on the screen in slow motion, and movement across the rooms, by hitting keys 1 \"thru\" 9 plus L and R, had all the urgency of a slug on the attack. To the right of the graphic display, if that it could be called, being entirely symbolic, were the usual fatigue and wounds statistics, with a couple of new ones indicating power in the power pack, and blaster bolts left. The aliens, although looking like crosses, were actually a race called Tollahs the superior ones being High Tollahs. Probably an American attempt at satire. If so, it left me cold, as did the rest of the game. If you like Dunjonquest games, fine, but don't, like me, expect anything different in this game. I got the distinct impression that the intricate background story in the book was written around an existing formula to give it a new lease of life. Rescue at Rigel, costing over , runs on cassette on a 32 K Atari or 16 K TRS-80, and on disk on 48K Apple, 32K Atari, or 32 K TRS-80. From Computer Magic. OK â I might as well admit it I'm beaten!

Readers have been writing to me desperate for help â and I have deliberately delayed answering in the hope ! might find the solution. But now I feel it is time to come clean ... I can't solve this mystery. In Fun House, the first problem is to get inside, a devious ploy typical of Scott. The clues are all there, and so with a selfcongratulatory pat on the back I entered the house. After being chucked out a couple of times by a bouncer, found how to stay inside. Round I went pressing buttons and pulling levers â all in search of the missing plans!

"YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THE PADDED CELL It is comforting when stuck in an Adventure to know you're not alone! Many readers write in desperation for help. The interesting point is that their problems are fairly similar and tend to revolve around a small number of Adventures. Perhaps these are the games intriguing enough to worry about! On this page help with these sticking points is often at hand! I would like to help my mystery correspondent, recognisable by his distinctive notepaper, who writes variously as Bilbo from Bag End, and Desperate Adventurer from A Padded Cell! Turn the page upside down Bilbo, to discover how to cross the river. And please reveal your true identity next time! Many thanks to Geoff Phillips of London NW9, who has enabled me to re-exist in Philosopher's Quest. For all those readers dying to know it's really quite simple just think like a philosopher! Geoff also mentions that he feels five seconds is a more realistic response time for an Adventure, since one cannot physically travel from room to room instantaneously. True, the first time around this is acceptable the player is busy thinking ahead. But what about the poor devil trying from scratch for the 99th time, who knows his way into the middle of the game like his twice times table and hasn't saved a suitable version? Any views, Adventurers? How often do you save your game at the crucial moment? Troubled readers requesting help this month include two Bedlam players. Richard Jones can't get past a guard dog and Simon Clarke wants to know how to get the green key from the electro-shock room. G. Keen from Down Under, has designs on the demise of a gargoyle in Tandy's Raaka-Tu. Can any readers, through me, help these troubled explorers to reach their goal? And perhaps when you are similarly stuck one day, someone else will provide the clues to help you move on to the next room. strange pair of spectacles. But what about the second bolt? And how do you get your fortune told? Alistair Miller of Richmond can answer the first question, but is still stuck, and complains that the hint sheet doesn't help either! This is borne out by Simon Clarke from Harpenden, who is not quite so far into Fun House yet. He strongly recommends not bothering with hint sheets whose usefulness he describes with a four-asterisk word. Another Fun House sufferer is the Rev. Dave Byrne of Kings Norton, trapped at the bottom of a tank without even a mermaid to coiffure! So we're all stuck at different places â and apparently all face insoluble problems. Surely if we're each capable of ocercoming some of the difficulties which others thought impossible, it is within each of our capabilities to reach the end? Just a matter of perseverance! Back to the keyboard, Adventurers! And if I have any luck I'll let you know! Fun House runs on TRS-80, Video Genie, Atari, Vic-20, Apple and Sorceror, and is certainly one of Scott's most addictively aggravating Adventures! Buy it if you want a real challenge. If you are struggling with an adventure and feel that you will never find a way around the problem, then my own small talents plus the might of C&VG's dedicated adventure players may provide the answer. Write in to: Keith Campbell Adventure Helpline, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5JB. If I don't know the answer then I can alsways throw it open to the readers. Please don't pick up a pen at the first sign of a problem. You will only get a full sense of achievement from a completed adventure if you have solved every problem yourself. So before you write in, give yourself a chance to solve the problem or find another way around it. If you can't succeed and half the adventure is never played because you cannot find a way round one particular problem then is the time to write to the Adventure Helpline. SOME TIPS ON MY HINTS A few months ago I wrote some coded tips, and a decode program. A number of readers had trouble with this. I should have mentioned that the  was the printer's way of depicting a hash, or sharp sign. Some machines didn't have all the features used and a CLEAR 1000 statement was needed for a Tandy.

In this way a computer can be programmed to see by running a program to extract the edges from a picture of a real-life scene and then running a program to determine the meaning of the line drawing formed by the edges. In a very general way, this is what happens in the brain and eye when we see things. It also helps to explain why we can recognise cartoons and characatures so easily. They are composed of lines, so that edges are presented directly. Consequently the brain does not need to perform its usual first stage of extracting edges, but can start its work at a higher level than it can with an ordinary picture. 0 ON ~ 10 10 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 133 "

JETPAC Building your rocket and fuelling it is the idea of the latest game from Ultimate. The tape loaded successfully first time and while the game was loading an impressive title screen was displayed. The game starts with a rocket ship in three parts. This has to be assembled by picking up each of the pieces in order and dropping them onto the base segment which is already in position at the bottom of the screen. Once the rocket assembly is complete, you will need to get six fuel pods on board by picking them up as they appear randomly on the screen and dropping them into the craft. When fuelled, you can board the ship yourself and blast off to the next planet where a similar task faces you. If all this sounds too easy, then you probably haven't heard about the thousands of aliens who inhabit each planet and are, \"in desperate need of blowing up\". You are equipped with a laser weapon with which to do this and also a jet-powered transport system strapped to your back, hence the title. If you are hit by an alien then you lose one of your four lives. On the first screen the aliens are not too difficult to avoid but on subsequent planets they become more intelligent and are able to track you with ever increasing accuracy. Jetpac is very playable, addictive and original arcade type game. The graphics 65.50 .... .75 Escape from Orion is the first Donkey Kong style game to come under the scrutiny of our BBC reviewers. As the first software house to attempt such a complicated arcade to home conversion Hopesoft are to be congratulated for their pluck. That is where the congratulations have to end. The game fails on a number of counts. Although it gives you four screens of graduated toughness they are not interactive. When you have completed screen one you do not automatically go on to screen number two, but must go back to the menu and select the next stage. Effectively it's like playing four separate games. The next gripe is either as a result of a bug or bad design.

It is supplied with a 16-page booklet, which sets the scene for the game and provides instructions.

This is most frustrating as when you get to the bottom of certain screens you are trapped through no lack of skill on your part. This problem is eliminated to some extent on the third screen which has two lifts connecting the floors. Graphics-wise Escape from Orion is adequate though not impressive. Your little man arrives in his space craft and must then run down the ladders collecting the spanners which are dotted around the four levels of play. Every so often a green cat-like alien appears at the side of the screen and flings an object at you. These are easy to dodge and they don't track you down the ladders as do the barrels in the arcade game. To dodge objects press the space bar to make your little man hop over the obstacles. You also make him jump up to collect the various items which he will need to make good his escape. I played the game with the keyboard but it would be better with a joystick. This could quite easily have been a good game if one or two things mentioned had been sorted out. As it stands we cannot recommend it.

Well, I've played minefield games before, but this one for the Dragon 32 has a novel approach. It is slickly presented on screen, easily played with speed using the cursor arrows, and has surprises, bonuses and a few gimmicks thrown in.. Each level is slightly different, but the basic theme is for the player to cross from bottom to top of the screen, being warned at each position how many mines are adjacent to him. One false step and BOOM!! The first two levels show the players previous paths, and so he can move along them with absolute safety. Things get more difficult as the game progresses. A nice feature is that at the end of each level, the mines are shown, and the player is treated to a selectable speed action replay of his movements.

Fine, but who am I? I'm sorry, I can't answer that. Graphics are reasonably good. The game uses the window picture system at the top of the screen with the text flashing up beneath. Tolkien-esque, with large expanses of land, shrub-like trees and sparse vegetation â the illustrations enable you to easily lose yourself in the mythical land of Blackpoole. I liked this game, even if my novice's lack of adventures know-how stopped me getting very far into it. The important thing is that the game captured my imagination sufficiently to keep me coming back for more. Blade of Blackpoole runs on Atari 800 with 48K. It is available on disc from Calisto of Birmingham, at .95. Getting started Value Playability Blade of Blackpoole is one of those adventure games. You know the sort I mean. After travelling a couple of moves North, South, East, or West you come up against something that you just can't shift, get past, kill, cajole or bribe. In the Blade these objects come in the shape of an ugly man-eating plant, a boat man-eating plant a boat which cannot be rowed, sailed, or paddled, a landslide which you cannot climb, tunnel under, or walk around, and a patch of quicksand which is determined not to let you cross. That's as far as I got. Heaven knows what lies beyond. So why can't you sail the boat? I'm sorry I can't answer that. All right then, so why can't I climb the landslide. I'm sorry, I can't answer that. That's about as much advice as this reviewer can offer on penetrating Blackpoole so I may as well tell you about the plot and the graphics. Anyway, even if I knew secrets, I wouldn't tell you. Plot is strong. You are searching for the magical sword of Myraglym. Rumour and legend talk of a secret chamber near Blackpoole in which the sword is said to lie. Discovering the blade is only half the battle.

There are four levels of difficulty which varied the speed at which the beams descended. I found that only the easiest level gave the player much chance. This was because the defence sight consisted of a flashing square which seemed to be invisible more often than seen. The joystick required only very slight movement to control the defence sights, and overshoot was far too easy when the sight was invisible. This made playing very much a matter of guesswork. An interesting game, but the weakness in control spoiled it. The game is available from Shard Software of Brentwood, Essex at .95.

FUN AND GAMES Bamby software We are looking for Contractual Programmers If you enjoyed Scramble then you'll love Parsec from Texas Instruments for the TI 99/4a computer. It's an all action scrolling game on a solid state cartridge with 16 skill levels which should satisfy even the most demanding Scramble ace. And it talks to you! You control the Parsec patrol ship and are confronted by a series of nasty aliens â all of which want to do you harm in the worse possible way. You blast away at the aliens as they Swoop pastand some of them have the audacity to actually shoot back at you! There are six types of aliens, ranging from the relatively harmless Swoopers to the really hateful Bynites, with a few Saucers thrown in along the way for good measure. Once you have wiped out all waves of the alien ships no easy task this â then you must face the dangers of an asteroid belt. You must blast a path through with your overworked laser cannon. Oh yes, a nice touch is the overload factor on your laser weapon. Should you think you can fire away with gay abandon then you've got a nasty shock coming. The cannon can overheat and destroy your craft as certainly as any alien missile. Then there's that synthesised voice which warns you of attacking ships or when your fuel is running low. The warning often comes in handy during the more difficult levels of the game â especially when your joystick hand starts to seize-up on the rather uncomfortable Texas joysticks. However the game will work without the speech box. Talking about refuelling. This is done by guiding your ship through a refuelling tunnel on the planet's surface. Second level play is similar to the first except that alien ships have to be hit twice to be destroyed. Also in level two the Bynite ships become invisible when hit once â but continue to fire at you until you succeed in hitting them again. The voice box comes in useful here too â it tells you when a laser blast has hit the target! Things get faster and more furious as you progress through the different levels making Parsec a challenging space shoot out.

Cap'n Ahab A compendium of ten simple games for the Dragon 32 including noughts and crosses, and, would you believe computer controlled musical chairs! My first reaction to this tape was that the games were rubbish â Noughts and Crosses was a piece of cake to beat, Anagram too complicated to control with a time limit, and Snap was basically a sequence of numbers which required the space bar to be pressed if two of the same number appeared consecutively. The matches were so few that I nearly fell asleep. However, the rest of the tape had Pin the Tail on the Donkey, which required a blindfolded player to operate the joystick, guided by the pitch of a sound. Musical Chairs controlled the cassette player, into which a music tape had to be inserted. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that here was an excellent collection of party games for younger children aged 5 to 9. As some of the games seemed fairly simple, not requiring the full memory available in the Dragon, I felt it was a pity that a number of games were not merged into fewer separate programs, to be called up from a menu entry. This would have avoided frustration whilst the favourite game was found on the tape, or while each was separately loaded. From Shard Software of Brentwood, Essex, at .75.

Texas owners who struggled with Pompeii and Ski-ing will testify to the problems they faced in reading the listings on a far from suitable background. We're full of good intentions but occasionally we get caught out and then the letters from you ever-alert readers flood in to tell us. What you needed, we decided was a reader on the inside. Someone who could watch over us and make sure that we didn't transgress. As of next month Robert Schifreen takes up that post. Robert has been a reader since day one and is not going to be slow to take us to task when things go wrong. Robert has sifted through our July programs with a magnifying glass, double-checking our reviewers' comments, and has pronounced them free from bugs Snag Junior was caught sneaking in one and quickly chased out! But, from experience we know that the Bugs will be doing their utmost to get back in and to this end we are giving Robert a regular page. Our August issue starts the Bug Hunter column. Robert will be in residence each month, giving tips on the games, telling you where we fouled up. Help is only a letter away if you are having difficulties with a program. And should you have a strong idea for some machine advice you would like us to print, then write to Robert and he'll do his best to find out himself or commission an article from an expert. Now you readers have got a man on the inside, you should really be able to keep us on our toes. Make good use of Bug Hunter and read his first column next issue. Laser disc technology has found its way into the arcades with Astron Belt from Sega. If you are not familiar with the ideas behind laser disc games, it involves using real film on a laser disc and a computer which switches to the part of the film which corresponds with the player's actions. So if he has just shot an alien fighter craft, the piece of film showing the craft exploding is flashed onto the screen. The arcade industry is predicting that laser disc games are likely to pave the way into the future. But costs have still got to be brought down and teething problems sorted out. Next month we check out Astron Belt in Arcade Action and find out what you can expect for your 40p. As grand prizes go we've got one which is five times grander than most We are running a summer programming competition with ,000 up for the first prize.

The first prize will be presented at the November Brainwave consumer electronics exhibition. The competition is free to enter and open to anyone. All the details plus that all-important entry form can be found in next month's C&VG so, if you think you've got a winning game in you, make sure you get hold of an early copy.

"HOME COMPUTERS AQUARIUS ATARI 400/800 Co tunes.ariable volumer The disp AQUARIUS: The brand new Aquarius Personal Computer is part of Mattel Electronics latest developments in advanced technology and offers full FREED ECUADCODES home computing facilities, as well as BUDGE CCEES extensive game play, using a very EESEEEESEE wide range of plug in cartridges. Since Aquarius is a Mattel Electronics product, it benefits by the company's wide experience of producing high technology equipment, as well as their game programming expertise which is evident from the advanced games which have been produced for the Intellivision. Aquarius costs  and comes with microsoft basic built in. It is so simple to use that you'll be writing your first programs within minutes of taking the machine out of its box. You can even record the programs on your own cassette recorder at home, so you can use them again at a later date. Most available domestic tape recorders are compatible with the Aquarius. A POWERFUL MACHINE: For all its simplicity, it is also very sophisticated. It has a Z80A processor and 8K of built in ROM as well as 4K of RAM, which is user expandable to 52K. It has a display of 40 x 24 characters, and a graphic resolution of 320x192 with a total character set of 256 (including the complete ASCII set with upper and lower case letters, numbers and additional graphic symbols). The keyboard has 49 full stroke moving keys, unlike some of the cheaper machines which have membrane keyboards. The size of the machine (excluding any of the additional peripherals), is 13\"x6\"x2\". PERIPHERALS: It is very easy to increase the capabilities of your Aquarius as all the peripherals plug straight into one another. You can add a Printer, a Modem, a Data Recorder, Mini Expander and other items. All of the peripherals are very easy to install and what is more, they're easy to use. But the best news of all is, they're easy to afford. CPM OPERATING CAPABILITY: The Aquarius is capable of being expanded to 52K RAM and later in 1983 a disk drive will be available for it, with the commercial CPM business operating system. This will allow you access to one of the largest software libraries in the world, with literally hundreds of programs available for you to use. CARTRIDGES: Various sophisticated programs will be launched on plug in cartridges such as a Visicalc type spreadsheet and a word processor. In addition there will be dozens of games and utilities and alternative languages such as Logo, which combined with the built in microsoft basic gives an unbeatable combination of high quality programming ability. MATTEL AQUARIUS .70 + VAT =  NEW LOW PRICES ATARI 400/800: With the Atari Personal Computers, you can play the ultimate in T.V. games, teach yourself new subjects ATARI 400 or skills, balance budgets, and even write your own computer programs in Basic.

The display graphics are of amazing quality, having a detailed resolution of 320 x 192, comprising 24 lines of 40 characters. Atari personal computers have a standard 10K ROM operating system. In addition the standard Atari 400 () comes with 16K of RAM, and the expanded version with 48K (). The Atari 800 () comes with 48K as standard. Both the 400 and 800 are now supplied with a FREE  Basic Programming Kit, which includes the Basic Programming Cartridge, as well as a 120 page Basic Reference Manual and the 184 page Self Teaching Manual by Bill Carris called 'Inside Atari Basic', so you can begin programming straight away, without buying any 'extras\".

The excellent graphics are well implemented with arcade titles such as Zaxxon, Lady Bug, Gorf, Wizard of Wor, Carnival, Mouse Trap and the lovable Smurfs. The console comes supplied with a three screen arcade quality version of DONKEY KONG. Parker and other companies have also announced ranges of cartridges for Colecovision, to further enhance the wide range of quality titles available for this new television games machine. COLECO THE CONSOLE: The CBS Colecovision video games system has advanced technology which produces superlative graphics resolution and excellent sound effects. The styling of the console and hand controllers has been carefully researched; the console is designed to complement modern hi-tech equipment, and has clear features for easy operation. The hand controllers allow fingertip control via the 8 direction joystick, and feature 2 independent fire buttons. The push button keyboard is used for game selection and for game control with some cartridges. The hand controllers are detachable and are connected to six feet of telephone coil cable, storing neatly away in the console when not in use. ATARI EXPANSION MODULE: The Atari converter module allows Atari VCS software cartridges to be played on the Colecovision console, allowing owners the freedom to purchase from the extensive range of Atari compatible cartridges. It also means that existing Atari owners can buy the CBS Colecovision games system without discarding their software library. Silica Shop offer part exchange facilities if you wish to upgrade. TURBO EXPANSION MODULE: The Turbo Driver Expansion Module allows you to 's on your T.V. screen. The module con steering wheel, dashboard and accelerator pedal. One hand controller is mounted on the dashboard to provide a gear change unit. The module comes complete with a Turbo Driver cartridge, the first of several cartridges to make use of the module, which provides all the action of sitting in the driving seat. This facility is unique to CBS Colecovision. HOME COMPUTER EXPANSION MODULE: The Home Computer Module scheduled for late 1983, allows conversion of the games unit into a sophisticated Home Computer. This flexibility of design is an important feature of the CBS Colecovision System. COLECOVISION .82 +VAT =  THE SYSTEM: Vectrex is a totally unique Home Arcade System, which has been exclusively designed and engineered to duplicate real arcade game play. Complete with its own monitor display, Vectrex won't cause any arguments over the use of the family's television because it has its own built in screen. THE SCREEN: Vectrex does not use ordinary display techniques, instead it uses vector scanning to control the images on the screen. With this scanning method, the gun only updates the area of the screen that has changed, whereas a normal T.V. re-transmits the ENTIRE screen 50 times a minute. It is this that gives Vectrex its speed, and means that very little computer power is required for screen control, and the results provide very fast responding and clear images. These 'Vector Graphics' are used in several arcade games such as Asteroids and Battlezone, to give you incredibly high resolution and quality. Vectrex brings all of this from the arcade right into your living room. The Vectrex screen is capable of displaying 80 columns by 40 lines, which is significant to the extensive developments planned for the system, EXCITING SOUNDS AND ELECTRONICS: Vectrex has an advanced microprocessor with more speed and power and exciting effects than many home video games systems. REAL ARCADE CONTROLS: Vectrex has a unique control panel, similar to those used in many real arcade games, with 4 concave action buttons and a full 360Â° self centering joystick. This control panel has a 4 foot detachable cord for maximum player freedom. REAL ARCADE GRAPHICS: Vectrex has its own 9 inch vertical screen and unlike a conventional T.V. screen, uses advanced display technology to achieve brilliant, high resolution imagery and superb game play never before possible. The Vectrex display provides special effects too, such as 3-D rotation and zooming in and out, which a regular T.V. cannot match. Using a black and white monitor, each Vectrex game comes supplied with its own coloured plastic screen overlay to add to the excitement of game play. The range of Vectrex cartridges (.95 each), gives a good selection of arcade games such as Berzerk, Scramble, Rip-Off and Bomber Attack. Vectrex comes complete with a fast paced Minestorm' game built into memory. VECTREX: Vectrex has an advanced state-of-the-art microprocessor with more speed than other T.V. games.
