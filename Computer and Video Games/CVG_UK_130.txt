"EDITOR TIM BOONE I once went for a job as a boilermaker, but I didn't know what a boiler was or how to make one.

DEPUTY EDITOR PAUL RAND When I was sixteen our mam made me go for a job as a chicken plucker at some plucking factory near our house. I got all the way there but couldn't pluck up the courage to go in the plucking place. Instead I hid for an hour and a half, then went home and said I was a sad plucker and everyone believed me. I only told them the truth two months ago... ART EDITOR JON BILLINGTON I once worked for this weirdo charity outfit full of hippies and right-on people and worked with this bloke making a pamphlet called The Evils Of Sugar. The thing was, this bloke smoked fifty a day which really IS bad for you so I gave him a pamphlet on that and he never spoke to me again. STAFF WRITER PAUL ANGLIN I once had this job collecting glasses in this club full of old Welshmen and the boss insisted that I had to work on my birthday.

"Welcome to another incredible issue of the greatest games mag in the world! There's so much stuff jam packed inside this issue I've only got space enough to say enjoy yourselves, don't buy crap mags, accept no imitations and if you see Marcus Hughes from Minehead tell him to stuff his rally bike sideways up his bum. See you next month! GIVE US A LAUGH AND WIN A PRIZE! WHAT, A PROMOTION! OK, time to update you on a few staff changes at CVG Towers. First of all, Paul Rand is promoted to Deputy Editor of CVG and GO! You all know Randy by now, so the Easington Elvis needs no introduction from me. However, we do have a new face to tell you about. He's Canvey Islander Paul Anglin, who at 16 years old becomes the youngest Staff Writer in the history of the magazine! So how did the spawny little get pull that one off, eh? Basically, we've taken him on because he's the only other person in Britain who can stand Rand twelve hours a day. But seriously folks, little Paul's a gamesplaying demon with snappy trainers and quick wits, so he lands the greatest school leaver's job in the world! Want to get your name in CVG and stand the chance of winning some free software for your machine? Well, send us summat and we might just send you something brilliant back! We got the idea when an anonymous CVG hero who forgot to include his name and address sent us loads of little items to give us a laugh. Among the package was half a ruler, a little model Batwing and tons of other skill stuff! Anyway, we reckoned it was the tops, so we're starting a brand new competition. Send us something to raise a laugh (make sure it's legal, decent and doesn't go rotten!) and we'll dish out free software to the best of the lot! It doesn't have to cost anything at all because it's the thought that counts, so fire off those little prezzies to: GOODIES GALORE, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. By the way, to the skill lad who gave us the idea: send us your name and address together with a list of some of the other stuff you sent (so's we know you're genuine) and we'll send you a free game for your machine! GO YOSHI GO! INCREDIBLE! Remember we told you about the Holostar 2000 back in April? Well that's nothing compared to its follow-up, the Holosad 2001! Giddyup Yoshi's the name of the first game for the machine, in which you get to ride the back of your dinosaur pal, just like Mario! And if that's not enough, Paul reports that manufacturers IQ-O are already working on the Holosad's second game, Dodgem Davey. Here's an early screenshot and just look at the speed blurr on that! Incidentally, whoever can come up with the best caption will win a free game for their machine... "

"WHOOPS WHAT A WHOOPSIE! NEWS Call us useless morons without any brains but we missed the usual thanks boxes off a few of the Reviews last issue. So apologies to all concerned, and if you were wondering who supplied the goodies and where you can get them, here's the info you need: Our FINAL FIGHT GUY and STREETFIGHTER 2 on the Super Nintendo were supplied by Adanced Console Entertainment and the Electronic Gaming Club. For more information call them on 071 783 0480. MAGIC SWORD and KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE on the Super Nintendo were supplied by Console Concepts. For more details call 0782 712759. STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! Just as CVG is winging its way off to the printers, Axelay and Hook for the Super Nintendo drop in through the door! Do we fret? Do we worry? No, we just despatch Paul Anglin to rugby tackle the courier on his way down the stairs and drag him back so's we can get this in. Axelay, from Konami, is quite possibly the best shoot 'em up you're going to see this year on any machine. Check out these awesome screenshots if you don't believe us! The game features utterly incredible graphics with gameplay to match, and the backgrounds are simply awe inspiring with Mode 7 used to full effect for smooth 3D background scrolling which puts coin-ops to shame! We'll be giving the game the full works in the very next issue of CVG so keep 'em here and all will be revealed! First impressions of Hook on the SNES are also very good. One of the best features of the game is the music a smattering of lively, orchestral ditties which spur you further into the game. Peter (you know, Pan) starts the game with a flashy sword which, after collecting the relevant item, can unleash bolts of energy! This can be handy to tackle tricky baddies from afar, because they might otherwise drain you of strength and you only get two energy units to begin with. Most of the baddies can be destroyed with one swift smack but others, like the rolling fat bloke who tumbles down the hill toward Peter, take two or more. Watch out for the archers who fire arrows into the air, or the bloke who shakes up a hornets nest and sends them swarming after you! Hook may not be the most original platform game in the world, but it is well done. Our copy came courtesy of those fine folk at Console Concepts, so call 'em for more info on 0782 712759. FLASHBACK FLASHES IN DEDA Coming soon from US Gold to an Amiga and PC near you is Flashback, latest game from Delphine the people behind topper titles Operation Stealth, Cruise for a Corpse and Another World. Taking the part of Conrad B Hart, research scientist to the stars, you find yourself crash landed on a bizarre jungle planet surrounded by hostile creatures and remembering very little of how you got there... As you can see from these screenshots, the graphics are looking absolutely top stuff, and we're promised gameplay to match. Delphine are also well proud of their animation system, and although you can't see it from these piccies the movement is so lifelike you may well swear you were watching a movie! More news on this one the second it drops in! GVG 010 "

"CVG SPAWN CENTRAL! NEWS THE EAGLE IS ANDING SOON! Not too long ago we ran a competition with Tekmagic to send one lucky reader to the European Football Championships in Sweden! Spawny boyo William Shields of East Grinstead was whisked off to see the tussle between England and France you know, the one which we should have won but didn't. Still, William had a lot of fun, especially when he came down to the CVG offices to spend an afternoon and didn't mind one bit when he got his ass kicked on our Streetfighter 2 arcade machine! If that's not enough. Tekmagic threw in an armful of Sega consoles and games because that's the kind of guys they are! Here's a piccy of Wills looking as happy as a sandboy at the match, together with his winning compo entry. What a star! Look out for more CVG compos soon next time it could be YOU! PAC-MANIA Everyone wants to make a console game these days! The latest software house to jump onto the ever-growing bandwagon is Microprose, who are putting the finishing touches to Super Nintendo and NES versions of their top-selling flight sim F15 Strike Eagle 2! Chosen because the game was the easiest sim to convert to consoles, thanks to the limited amount of keypresses needed in the original home computer version, F15 is looking a bit of a treat on the Nintendo machines and no mistake. In fact, the SNES game could turn out to be even better than the original, with those custom chips being pushed to the limits in a dazzling spectacle of graphics and sound! We're getting our hands on smart pre-production copies of both these titles in the near future, so watch out for the full CVG treatment very soon! \"S TECH-MACAU TANKS A LOT! We get loads of videos sent to us at CVG, and one of the cleanest we've received lately is Dominion Tank Police, the latest animated extravaganza from Japan! It's all to do with the world becoming a much more violent place and the normal police being replaced by the Tank Police coppers in massive battle tanks! As you might expect from a 15 certificate Japanese cartoon, Dominion Tank Police features guns galore and even a couple of women in various states of undress! Parts One and Two come on one cassette, with parts Three and Four, surprisingly enough, being supplied on another! Each tape costs .99, with the last two episodes becoming available on September 7th. SEGA'S LITTLE GENIE-US There's just no stopping the Game Genie! It's enjoying great success on the NES, even though Nintendo aren't desperately happy about its existence, and there's soon to be a version available for the Megadrive! Galoob, the company producing the game cracking device, are including a codebook in the package containing over a hundred different cheats for a variety of games, giving the user infinite lives and loads of other stuff! This well useful piece of kit will be released for the Megadrive in October, with a price tag of .95. And look out too for a Game Boy Genie, which we'll be covering in a future issue of GO!

"GUY SPY GOODIES! NEWS Now this looks like a bit of a laugh and no mistake! Guy Spy is the Dragon's Lairish offering from Readysoft on your Amiga and PC, and as you can see from these screenshots the game looks well 'ard! Playing the part of the world's greatest counter-espionage agent you have to destroy the dreaded Doomsday Machine in this cartoon romp featuring 1500 frames of animation and 6 megabytes of graphics on six disks! With any luck the game should be out by the time you read this, priced at .99 on Amiga, a fiver extra on PC. BLUNDERS DOWN UNDER It's true! The Holostar 2000 wasn't an April Fool at all according to one sad Aussie mag, that is. Antipodean reader Leigh Price spotted the 'Scoop Exclusive piece in a copy of Megazone magazine, in which they drooled over its custom polygons and got into a right old state over those 64 bits! Quite what they were thinking when they went on about how this new technology had been used by US Defence pilots is beyond us the Holostar 2000 is actually an upside-down Atari VCS with bits of plastic stuck to it! Of course, if those Down Under dizzies want to buy our Holostar, just send a cheque for  made payable to Cretinous Australians Should Hang (CASH for short)... VIRTUAL REALITY AT HOME! SECOND'S OUT ROUND TWO! Well, you may have missed your chance to be the First Samurai when Fat 'Un Bob went under, literally, but Vivid Image have been beavering away on the sequel to one of the best beaters ever! Yes indeedy, First Samurai on the Amiga was a fine old laugh which suffered badly when Maxwell went down with the ship. As a result not many of you got the chance to buy it, which was a right old shame.cos it was dead good. Anyway, as you can see from these shots, the sequel's already well underway and looking well wicked! Best improvement from the original is the option for two players, so two Second Samurai's can kick butt at the same time! From our sneaky peak we can tell you that the graphics are totally spiff and the game's already moving well. More news when we have it! After years of speculation about virtual reality becoming an everyday part of life, there now comes news of the HOLOSTAR 2000 anit, which will transform your lounge room into cyberspace. Although still in pre-production form, the Holostar is the first of the new generation of 64-Bit machines, featuring custom polygon generation and state of the art infra-red and ultra-sonic sensory equipment. It will also have the revolutionary Holospec System with fibre optic scanning, which has been used by US Defence Force pilots in esting jet fighter prototypes. The unit comes with LCD glasses and sensor equipment, which looks a lot like a mouse. The Holostar 2000 will be released in Britain in August for a surprisingly cheap  (around $500). It will hopefully make it's way Down Under in SAD CENTRAL 1. CVG BOY IN BOMB SCARE SHOCKER! OK, so a lot of things have been said about Jon Billington's sad VW Polo, but nobody's ever mistaken it for a bomb before well, until the police, fire brigade and bomb squad did! Sirens flashing, they rushed round to posh old Muswell Hill and broke into his car thinking our man was an international terrorist! Apparently somebody had spotted Jon and Mean Machines' very own Gary Harrod climbing out of the wreck, decided they were shady characters and phoned the cops! \"It was ridiculous,\" says Jon. \"They actually tried to tell me off for parking my car where ! live. The policewoman said she hoped 1 thought they weren't being petty and stupid about it all. I just looked at her...\" 2. SAD RAND'S CLIMBING CAR Right prepare yourselves for some serious sadness. It all started when Probe boss and top roistering boyo Fergus McGovern sent Paul Rand a birthday present from Japan a car which climbs walls. \"Codswallop!\" cried the CVG boys. \"You can't have a car that climbs walls!\" Well, Rand decided to prove it and spent most of the day lovingly constructing his little toy car. When it didn't work (sad) he managed to rope in a few poor unfortunates to attach sticky tape to the wells (saad) and tried in vain to run the car up the wall (saaad). Then he realised he hadn't read the instructions properly, got the car working and pranced around CVG Towers showing it off to all and sundry. We think this is probably the saddest sight we've ever seen, but if you can find a picture of yourself doing something even sadder then send it off to I'M SAD I AM at the usual address and we'll award the game of your choice to the best of the lot...

"NEWS R! And while we're on the subject of console flight-sim hilarity, you need to know about Electronic Arts' forthcoming conversion of their mega-selling PC game LHX Attack Chopper! The player gets to control either an AH-64A Apache Gunship or the futuristic LHX 'copter of the title across a variety of scenarios, with missions ranging from blowing up enemy outposts to rescuing POWs from concentration camps!

"BU 4 PAGE REVIEW AMIGA PLATFORM BY HUDSON SOFT TBA THROS PC OR BC? OR BONK? The biggest change between PC Kid on the Engine and the forthcoming Amiga version is in the name the computer game is to be called BC Kid. Not the most massive alteration in the world, but think yourselves lucky; in the States, where the PC Engine is known as the Turbografx 16, PC Kid isn't called PC Kid at all he's called Bonk! Just imagine trying to explain that one to your parents while they're rifling through your games pile! CHILLI SAUCE WITH THAT PLEASE Drehistoric children and lost girlfriends might not sound the ideal combination for a fast-paced romp in the Mario and Sonic mould, but that didn't stop Hudson Soft from achieving massive success with PC Kid on the PC Engine! One of the best games of its genre ever to hit a console, home computer owners were more than slightly peeved at the prospect of not ever being able to step into the animal-skins of the Kid on their machine. But all that is set to change for, due to massive public demand, PC Kid is making his longawaited debut on the Amiga! As always, CVG went and grabbed an Exclusive look at what is set to be one of the biggest hits this Christmas read on and find out all about what's in store! There's nothing the Kid likes better than to munch on a nice, hot kebab and when he does, all kinds of things happen! Eating kebabs causes kid to go all funny and dark, allowing him to head-butt the floor and freeze all the nasties for a limited amount of time. And, when he swallows a mega kebab, Kid goes absolutely wild, making him invincible for a short while! bo ana YE CVG 022 "


"REVIEWS CHROMAGNON KID IN KIDNAP CAPER! Basically, you play the role of the Kid a half-pint homo-erectus whose girlfriend has been kidnapped by the bad dinosaurs. Of course, the young 'un's got to go and rescue her; so pull on your loin-cloth and shout Ooga! Booga!' across five enormous stages of platform action, set both on land and in the sea and even in the stomach of a gigantic Diplodocus! Eee, the things those prehistoric types used to get up to, eh? BC Kid? That sounds a little familiar. And indeed it should. This is an Amiga version of the classic PC Engine platform romp PC Kid, which took the Engine world by storm when it was released about two years ago. The main reason for its astounding success was the strong comedy element. The thought of guiding a slap-headed caveboy along prehistoric landscapes and nutting dinosaurs to oblivion is a real rib tickler. But PC Kid's merits aren't just down to the laughs. Graphically the game is brilliant, with real cartoony looks and fast smooth scrolling backed up by some top sound effects and a host of prehistoric tunes. The gameplay is fast and extremely addictive, and this is a game you won't crack in a hurry. But of course the question everyone is asking is how does it compare to the PC Engine version? The answer is: they're exactly the same! So now Amiga owners everywhere can enjoy some top class console gaming action, and this is brill. As the Yanks say: \"Keep on Bonking!\" PAUL ANGLIN CVG 023 "


"DE 4 PAGE REVIEWE HROPI NDZ 3370 PC Kid was a game that I played absolutely to death on the PC Engine even with the plethora of amazing games that are around for the little NEC wonder, it still managed to grab the title of Best Engine Game Ever in the CVG office when it arrived. So imagine my delight when we got a perfectly converted Amiga version through the post! By golly, I jumped with delight at the superbly cute characters, hopped with joy at the massive levels, and nearly burst a gut with pleasure at the hordes of enemies that were there to contend with! This is such a brilliant game that if you pass it by you deserve to be eaten by one of the monsters in BC Kid's world! Graphically gorgeous, with masses of colour, and the kind of simple yet demanding gameplay that has made this style of game one of the most popular, coupled with the inanely cute Kid, make BC Kid a massive success. Don't think buy! PAUL RAND kin seous, uc Kids by On MORE FAMOUS THAN THE BRAT OFF HOME ALONE Over in the Land Of The Rising Sun, PC Kid is big business. He's on mags! He's on mugs! He's on towels! He's on trowels! Well, perhaps not, but he most certainly is on a hefty pile of products! Kid merchandise sells like sushi in Japan, as becomes the third biggest video game star over there, just behind Mario and Sonic. And soon, everyone will know his name over here too! Of course, we've known all about the Kid for yonks, 'cos we're great, we are. ALOVER LOAD! cVG 024 "


"003 NUT THEM NASTIES In BC Kid's world, the emphasis is on cute. Jolly little bird things with half egg-shells on their heads, milling around the levels; happy dinosaurs which kid can climb inside and find secret places; comical capers of all sorts, from climbing up vines by your teeth (!) to giving all those baddies a Glasgow kiss. RE The pair of PC Kid games on the engine must rank as two of the greatest console laughs of all time and incredibly the Amiga version is just as good! Here's a game specifically written for a particular console and converted perfectly onto home computer! The people behind the game are Hudsonsoft, the same software house which turned in the Engine originals, and absolutely nothing is missing! The first thing to strike you about BC Kid are the awesomely hilarious graphics, which even manage to beat Sonic and Mario for sheer appeal. Then there's the sound fabulous jolly tunes to spur you on through the game. But most important of all there's the gameplay, perfectly ported from the Engine version and a complete winner. The urge to discover what the next level looks like just won't let up until you've finished the game, and even then you'll still be going back for more! PC Kids I and II are two of my alltime fave console games, and this Amiga version IS PC Kid. So stop shuffling about and buy the game just as soon as you possibly can! TIM BOONE STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES SAD HAIRCUTS AHOY! One of the best aspects of BC Kid is the variety of end-level monsters. Except they're not at all monstrous they're quite sickeningly cute! Take the first guardian, for instance he's a big dinosaur with an egg-shell on his head (they don't half go in for eggy hats in this game!) who, after you've beaten him by head-butting the shell until it breaks, reveals himself to be nice and jolly with a rather sad haircut! There's a host of other such 'nasties' too, including a half-girl, half-bird thing and a large triceratops at least, that's what it looks like!

"EUG REVIEW GVG NES PLATFORM BY ACTIVISION .99 BEBODDODODNO CROOKS FEET PSTL It's Christmas Day and the staff of the Nakatomi Corporation are having their party. Little do they know that a gang of robbers are in the process of ripping off the $640,000,000 worth of security bonds that are stored in the highsecurity safe. Well, they don't know until the gang, led by Hans Gruber, breaks into their shin-dig on the thirtieth floor and holds them hostage. But what Hans and his cronies fail to realise is that hiding out somewhere in the building is John McLain police officer and husband of one of the party guests. He's not altogether enamoured at the prospect of his missus' incarceration and decides to try and shut down Gruber's operation by shooting all of them. Well, what would you do? Not really very tidy here is it? LOCKS OCTED One lock down, 39 crooks to go and oyur feet are looking good. GET EQUIPPED McLain begins the game with no shoes and a policeissue revolver. When he kills the baddies, they may or may not drop some equipment that will prove valuable during the game. Such items as sub-machine guns, ammo and radios all contribute to helping John complete his mission and get rid of Gruber. ELEVATOR ACTION The Nakatomi building is big. And with feet like McLain's, he doesn't want to be tramping up and down stairs all the time. So it's a good job the lift's in good, working order, to carry our crackshot copper between rs. But be careful gang members might be hiding the lift, waiting to pick you off. Or they may be just tside the elevator, guns at the ready to fill you full of es when the doors slide open! FINDING YOUR FEET It's taken a long time to come, but Die Hard has finally been converted to the NES and it's a bit of a hoot! Slightly reminiscent of Gauntlet, what with the top-down view and the fact that you've got to run around and kill lots of baddies, but the similarity ends there. Strategy is an all-important factor in Die Hard make sure you get hold of a radio early on in the game so that you can follow the movements of the baddies and avoiding landing on the same floor as one of the mega-criminals! The game follows the storyline of the film almost to a tee lots of stills from the movie, crawling through air vents and being found out and shot at by the terrorists even having your feet ripped to shreds by broken glass, hampering your progress! It may not have the best graphics ever, but Die Hard certainly scores plenty in the gameplay stakes! There are two energy bars to keep an eye on in Die Hard. The first is the normal energy meter which is depleted whenever you get shot. The second, and more unusual is the Foot-o-meter! You see, John McLain hasn't got any shoes on and, with all those bullets whizzing around, there's a lot of broken glass on the floor. Whenever he steps on these shards. the Foot-o-meter goes down, but luckily there are first-aid kits hidden in rooms which John can use to soothe his torn-up tootsies. It was my idea for Johnny boy to get the first aid box. GVG 026 PAUL RAND "


"REVIEW EVE HE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEXT HALF-HOUR A Winner! This isn't just a battle against the baddies it's a race against time! In half an hour, the gang will have broken the security code to the safe where the bonds are stashed and, if they get away with the loot, the game is lost. So there you have it thirty lousy minutes to blast all the members of the gang, get the girl and get out of there. Easy. MOVIE MAYHEM As you may or may not have guessed, Die Hard is based upon the film of the same name which starred Bruce Willis as hard LA cop John McLain. It cost a fortune to make, mainly because of Brucie's large salary and the fact that the special effects men went and created lots of expensive explosions. The sequel, called Die Hard 2 Die Harder, hit the screensa couple of years ago and again cost a bomb, because that time the FX boys detonated a AB Boeing 747 jet plane! I first saw this quite a while ago, and at first glance it looks completely crap until you pick up the pad and play! There's a really excellent game here, completely hidden by bog-standard graphics and samey sound. Basically, this is the game of the film and it follows the plot very closely indeed. You can almost feel the tension as you bomb around the building and there's plenty to do with some wicked weapons to pick up. There are some really neat touches too. You'll cack your pants when you hear the elevator ting because that means it's gun central and a shoot-outs on the way! All in all this has to rank one of the best film tie-ins yet, with the quality of the gameplay shining through the dull presentation to lift Die Hard right up there with the best of them. If you're a fan of the film you're going to have kittens, and if you're not you'll still have a well decent laugh! Recommended.

"SCRODOOT500 O PALISE! GVE REVIEW CVG MASTER SYSTEM SMART WEAPONRY WONDERS PLATFORM BY SEGA .99 Manners maketh man, they say. But Please and Thank You aren't much cop when there's a bloody great enemy stood in front of you. Let's face it: some smart killing gear's going to come in very handy. And in Ninja Gaiden there's a stack of weapons to find and use. Shurikens and Super Shurikens are the most widely available, while the FourWay Whirlwinds, predictably enough, fire off small whirlwinds in four directions. Fireballs are heat-seeking and home in on onscreen enemies, and Dragonfire not only makes you invincible for a short while, it destroys anybody who comes into contact with it. Make sure you have enough combat points when you use any of the weapons though they're a bit of a drain. There's nowt so useful as having an ancient band of ninja warriors on hand to look after your country. That's the situation Japan's been in for centuries, guarded by the Dragon Ninja clan under the leadership of Ryu Hayabusa. Mind you, they can't be that good. While old Ryu is out and about, a gang of hoodlums has been in and massacred the entire Dragon Ninja posse! Not only that, the ancient scroll of Bushido has been stolen and this is no ordinary scroll because its owner can control the world! The fate of the Earth is in the hands of Ryu and you control him in an eight-level beat 'em up in which you've got to kill lots of baddies, collect lots of items and, ultimately, retrieve that scroll. All in a day's work for a top ninja bloke like yourself. Or not... SAW HOW YA TOOK CORE OF THE SUMO TOD BAD HE DIED BEFORE YOU COULD FIND OUT ANYTHING USEFUL. RIGHT BOYS! NINJA GAIDEN IT'S THE GREAT JAPANESE WHISTLE-STOP TOUR! There's no use hanging about the Dragon Ninja village DECISIONS waiting for the baddies to return. Ryu's going to have DECISIONS to go look for them! Starting in the Forest, young Hayabusa travels to Tokyo before moving on to the quaint little town of Osaka, for more killing and mayhem. Then it's off to Mount Fuji as a stop-off point between dodgy-sounding Castle Of Darkness. Inside, traverse the underground caves full of molten lava, kick in the Guardians of the Castle, grab the Sacred Scroll of Bushido and do in the Shogun of Darkness. Nay bother! NOTHING LIKE A BIT OF PERSUASION, EH? M ANY ITEMS \"There's been something of a shortage of good beat 'em ups on the Master System, so it's good to see a b cart of the quality of Ninja Gaiden cropping up out of nowhere. It's nothing very special graphically, although it has to be said that the sprites are of above average quality, even if they do verge on the titchy side. The eight levels you'll negotiate are quite tough, with a goodly amount of enemies to smack about, and loads of great items and weapons to pick up and use. An annoying factor of Ninja Gaiden is the continue option why oh why do games producers put infinite continues in their products? Nobody wants to finish the game at the first sitting and at thirty quid a throw, Sega shouldn't expect them to. It hasn't got a whacking great name behind it, but Ninja Gaiden should hold its own quite admirably in the cut and thrust of the Master System world! GVG 030 PAUL RAND MEAN LIGHT WORK Ryu can pick up a whole host of items for extra points skills! Big B's give either 5,000 or 10,000 points, depending on whether you grab the blue or red one, while the Combat Point counters (both of which look like Jap symbols) add extra to your weapons totals. Grab the Heal icon to regain hit points and, for a whopping great score, jump onto the Time Bonus when it appears!

"GUE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TUPELLES SUPER NINTENDO GET READY  KICK SHELL, DUDES! BEAT \"EM UP SHELLSHOCK! THAT'S ONE FLAT TURTLE! TURTLES IN THE BY KONAMI .99 DON 031 NO CONVERSIONS? \"he New York crime rate is getting ridiculous these days. mean, car thefts and break-ins are one thing, but stealing the Statue of Liberty in broad daylight, in front of a television audience of millions, is quite another. Surely no ordinary criminal would dare try that? But wait this is no ordinary bad guy! This is Shredder, the arch enemy of those heroes-in-a-halfshell, the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. After witnessing these terrible events, our amphibian friends have decided that it's time to teach Shredder and his cronies a lesson. When Konami announced that they were producing a Super Nintendo version of Turtles In Time, the CVG boys were less than impressed. 'Oh no, not a conversion of the terminally sad and tragically low quality coin-op of the same name?' was the resounding howl, but how wrong we were! This is, in fact, a version that Konami have written themselves. Thank goodness for that! TEENAGE MUTANT DON 128 PRAES STOMP GUEL Yes, it's those Ninja/Hero Turtle boys again, fighting for truth, justice and pepperoni pizza, and I thought these guys had burned out. This is not a conversion of the very poor and not at all exciting Turtles in Time coin-op; it's Konami's own version and doesn't it look grand? Turtles 4 has been given a real cartoony look, and it's very impressive. The sound has also been given the treatment, featuring some really great effects, not least a smattering of superb speech. Sounds good so far? Unfortunately, the whole game trips up on gameplay. Although Turtles in Time is enjoyable enough, it is very easy and will not take you long to finish. Normal mode is a breeze and Hard mode is little more of a challenge. A real shame, because if it hadn't have been for this little niggle, Turtles 4 could have been a smash.As it stands, it joins the already bulging ranks of the could've beens. Do you suffer from the 'Oi, you've nicked my power-up' blues? Yes, two-player mode can be a cruel world, can't it? Turtles in Time, however, gives you the chance to do what you've always wanted to kick seven bells out of your mate! Unlike in a lot of games where this is possible in the actual game, Turtles In Time locks yourself and another Turtle in mortal combat in a separate sub-game!

"BODU PRESS STAR TA OR HUG BAXTER BAXTER STOCKWELL ISN'T LOOKING VERY HEALTHY! MODE 7 AHOY! THERE GOES A FLYING FOOT HURRAH! ELITE FEET The Foot Clan is one thing sorting out the bosses at the end of each level is quite another. Standing in your way is a prehistoric Turtlesaurus, an alligator that zips around at the speed of light, the two mutants Beebop and Rocksteady and, of course, the dreaded ShredM Turtles? Finished? Not if Konami have anything to do with it! Pity they've come up with a rather tawdry product in Turtles 4 Turtles In Time. Give them their dues, it's not a straight conversion of the diabolical arcade game, but it does have its bad points. Certainly not in the presentation though Turtles In Time looks absolutely brilliant, with big, colourful sprites and backdrops and the Super Nintendo's graphics chip producing some fine effects, most notably when the Foot go flying toward the screen! Sound is ace too, with lots of thumping soundtracks and spot effects and even speech although the cry of 'Cowabunga!' at the end of each stage is a tad twee. No, the problem here is the difficulty setting or rather lack of it. Even on the hardest level Turtles 4 is ridiculously simple and if you don't make it to the end after a few hours play there must be something seriously wrong with you. Turtles In Time should be called Turtles In No Time 'cos that's how long it'll take to complete. PAUL RAND HERO TURTLES 4 SPECIALE STRATEGY SKILL One instantly noticeable thing about Turtles 4 are the incredibly cartoonlike graphics, which really capture the feel of the Turtles perfectly. And, being a Super Nintendo game, it's awash with incredible effects the most visually stunning of which being when you throw the baddies out of the screen!

"REVIEW AVE ma SUPER NINTENDO PLATFORM FLYING IN YOUR SHIP AND WHAT DO YOU COME ACROSS? A SAD VOLCANO, THAT'S WHAT CHO BY KONAMI .00 WEIRD OR WHAT? Most people would expect a shoot 'em up to be full to bursting with rock hard spaceships in Parodius, nothing could be further from the truth! Vent your anger on an assortment of outrageous enemies, including fluffy yellow chicks, flashing police car lights and even smiley-faced volcanoes that spit out bits of candy-floss! W hat can you do when eleven of your most favourite sectors of the galaxy have been captured and overrun by weird things? Do you call the Old Bill and demand immediate action? Do you hold up all the traffic and generally make a fool of yourself? Or maybe just sit around, feeling sorry for yourself and talking about the good old days? No of course you don't you jump into your death-dealin' starcruiser, put on some thumping rock tracks and take no prisoners. I don't care how cute they are; they're not going to get away with this! PARO 21000 W 72900 SHIPS GALORE! At the start of the game you're given the option to choose from five differ ent spacecraft. ranging from the standard Nemesis ship to a flying Octopus! Each of these ships has a different sequence of power-ups, and all have their various strengths and weaknesses some are really good in some situations, while others are about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. I absolutely loved Parodius on the P.C Engine; the idea of blasting a nice tabby out of the sky really appealed to me. So when I got to grips with this Super Nintendo version, I had very high expectations. Thankfully my demands have been more than met what little room there was for graphical improvements has been more than filled, and the cuteness rating has been jacked right up for maximum effect. The sounds are really great giving a terrific atmosphere, but the addictive gameplay really makes Parodius stand head and shoulders above the crowd. Okay, so it's nothing original, but it is one of the cutest games I have ever been subjected to, and try as you might, you just cannot put it down. And with ten basic levels not to mention the Omake level which can be selected on the title screen there's little chance of doing that for a good while. You can keep your R-Types and other oh-so-serious blasts, 'cos for me, Parodius is the bizz. SPREND BUBBLE WOT? NO CONVERTS! The arcade version of Parodius went down a storm, so it might come as something of a surprise to discover that, up until now, the only other ver sion of the game was on the PC Engine. Mind you, after the job that's been done putting the game on the Super Nintendo, we wouldn't be sur prised to see Parodius cropping up on sacks of other formats! GVG 036 PAUL ANGLIN "

Fans of the Nemesis/Gradius series of games will instantly warm to Parodius because of its similarity to those great blasts, and newcomers will leap at the chance of a blast simply because it is so weird! Honestly, flying around in a turbo-charged octopus, taking pot shots and cat/balloon combinations?! A challenging feast of fun and firepower, with enough levels and difficulty setting to test the hardest hardman, all combine to make Parodius one of the best shoot 'em ups you can find. PAUL RAND GRAB THE SWEETIES, LITTLE BIRDY! u BIRDS AND CATS AND BIRDS AGAIN! No shoot 'em up would be complete without a goodly supply of end-level baddies, and Parodius is no exception. Don't expect alien terrors or enormous star destroyers though you'll be taking on such guardians as a parrot with an Achilles belly button and a foxy lady with long but lethal legs. Also out to stop your progress to that next level, is a big bird decked out in Stars and Stripes, a cute kitten on a balloon and an inflatable spiky fish! STRATEGY SKILL 0600 72900 ACTION REFLEXES ONLY IN FUN Remember Nemesis? Well, to say Parodius owes a little to that games, is like saying that there's slight congestion on the French Motorways at the moment. Without that classic shoot 'em up, Parodius would no doubt never have existed. It gets it's name, from the fact that it is a parody of Nemesis hence the name Parodius with similar power-ups and level maps but altogether wackier graphics!

"YOB'S MALBAG best, BLOOOAAAARRGHHH! Welcome to another hot and hilarious slice of the greatest Mailbag in the world, courtesy of yours truly the one and only YOB! Reckon you're hard enough to tackle my wit and wisdom? Fire your rubbish away to YOB'S LAFF RIOT MAILBAG, CVG, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. There's  for the best of the lot, and bog all for the rest! Hedley YOB: 1. So who's writing this page now that Frank's no longer with CVG? Doh! The fact is, you're so stupid you fail to appreciate the blindingly obvious that YOB's letter page is written by none other than YOB. Double Doh! 2. If you haven't got the bottle to ask her yourself she won't be interested. 3. One and the same. 4. No, but I do recall you need a good kicking. FAITH BROWN TOPS SELINA SCOTT Dear YOB, Or should I say «Dear Frank\"? Why? I hear you cry because have been doing some detective work for a while and have revealed the true identity of the greatest criminal of all time! For all these years now, the great and glorious YOB has been writing in the style of Frank O'Connor yes, that sad lad from the CVG crew. Last month my theory was proved correct when YOB entitled one of his letters \"Quick say hamburger!\" Only four months ago Frank admitted that as being his favourite saying! 1. Are you really Frank. 2. Will you ask Sadie out for me? 3. Are you the same YOB as in Mean Machines? 4. Do you remember the hundred quid I lent you last week? Hedley \"Detective\" Thorne Abingdon (Do not print the below text!) Dear CVG lads could you please print the above letter in YOB's Mailbag? Keep up the good work. GO! is an absolute treat! All the Dear YOB, AGGHHHH! I hate Marti Caine, have you seen her latest program? Have you? Huh. I can't believe how crap it is. Joker In The Pack hey? More like lots of middle aged cretins trying to redeem themselves from their sad and boring lives, and what better way to do it than to go on national television and make a complete ass of yourself. The only type of person this would appeal to is someone who spends their weekends at garden centres and crap like that, and dim farmhands who say things like \"ooar that there program is a reet larf.\" Let's face it, when you start laughing at the jokes these guys dish out you're better off dead. The people on this program should be subjected to some form of physical torture, considering the mental torture that they dish out. Having said that though this would make an excellent licence for a video game. You have to mow down the contestants Operation Wolf Style, whilst they fire crap jokes at you and Marti takes the role of the end of level guardian. PAUL KELLY Cleveland YOB: OK, I feel a bit of a laugh coming on: what's the worst programme on telly and why? Write in and tell me! We'll award Yob's stinking sock to the worst of the lot and I'll give away a little sack of software to the best letter of the lot. Fire those laffs off to: SMELLY ON THE TELLY, YOB'S MAILBAG, etc etc. PRINCESS DI Dear YOB, I think that CVG is the dopest, flyest British games mag in the world no kidding. I love the humour, the previews and the reviews and of course I like YOB's killer insults. Canadian game mags don't have the guts to insult their readers and their humour isn't that great, so that's why I switched to British game magazines or should I say CVG. Here are a few quick questions: 1. Is the Atari Lynx worth the money? A simple yes or no will do. 2. Does Blood Money for the Amiga have any sort of cheats like skipping levels or infinite lives. It has to. What is it? 3. Was the Holostar 2000 really an April Fools prank. 4. Who does your hair? Thanks for answering my questions. STEVE SABO Surrey Canada PS I hope you slip on a banana peel and split your hollow head into two equal parts. YOB: 1. Six months ago I'd have said no, because there just wasn't enough software for the machine. But suddenly Atari have got their act together and are releasing more of titles for the machine so the simple answer you need is...maybe. 2. Oh dear. 3. Oh dear. 4. The CVG gardener usually has a go with his shears once he's finished with the vegetables. Trouble is, their haircuts "


"KIM BASSINGER No use to you and me. A waste of time and space, A totally useless place. Sorry about that Akis, But Yob likes taking the mickey. Dear YOB, I have a friend who, whilst scratching inside his ear, hooked his finger and got it caught around his optic nerve. Then, trying to remove his finger, he pulled so hard that his eyeball was ripped from his socket and nestled just inside his ear. This gave him a whole new view of the world and, liking the experience, he promptly did the same to the other eye. He became quite ecstatic because now, not only can he give sideways glances without moving his head, if he doesn't like what he hears he just closes his eyes. We've got him locked in the cupboard at the moment. Please send  so that we can get him some professional help. Yours in all seriousness STEVE CHALLIS Milton Keynes YOB: Dear Steve's friend, Feeling a little bored and lonely in your padded cell? Never fear, Yob is here. I'm sending you a Do It Yourself bazooka kit hidden inside a birthday cake. The instruction manual's a bit of a bummer, but you should have plenty of time on your hands. Do be aware that the explosives contained in the shells are very volatile, so handle with care. Anyway, one you've constructed the device I'd suggest pointing it at the door and waiting for Steve to arrive. When he does, flick off the safety catch, take aim and fire while shouting: \"Bullseye, sucker no hundred quid for you!\" PS Let me have the kit back when you're finished. the Megadrive? 2. If so, when will it be released? 3. I have heard rumours that a WWF game is being released by Sega. Is this true? 4. If so, when will it hit the shops? GARY ROONEY Glasgow PS How about sending me that hundred quid. PPS Please could you insult my friend Stephen McGowan who thinks you're a boiled egg. YOB: 1. Yup. 2. It's planned for January next year. 3. Yup. 4. It's also planned for January next year. PS After priceless info like that? PPS He's the chicken's ass it came from. mm O e ya MICHELLE PFEIFFER Dear YOB, Twenty thousand cans of Cola. Pepsi Cola? ALEX POLLARD Brighton, Sussex YOB: A prat by any other name just isn't the same. ANDRE AGASSIS GIRLFRIEND Dear YOB, I just decided to write to you to express my feelings on a matter which probably concerns most of your sane readers. This Sega vs Nintendo thing is getting a bit bloody tedious and because of the sad people who write to your letters page (not all though) is spilling over onto your magazine through no fault of your own people new to the console world are becoming turned off. Owners on both side have been fighting it out for too long. These people either made the wrong decision in the first place or are just plain jealous of other people and their machines. I say just be contented with the machine you've got and look at the good points of it (however few they may be). For those people who suffer severe paranoia for their machines and think that Mean Machines have got it in for their machines then I say if the game is said to be crap by the four reviews in your mag then it is crap. Also I wish people would write their real name on their letters instead of hiding behind false ones like \"Grunthos the terminally flatulent\" and please highlight the star letter so that people can see what to read and take seriously and highlight the prats so that people can take the pee out of them severely. BRENDAN GILMORE N Ireland PS Some things just have to be said you know. YOB: And some people need to be dragged through a mangle and hung out to dry with a big dunces cap on their heads and sign saying IDIOT attached to their Tshirt. Nobody's forcing you to listen to their views, especially if you're going to whitter on about it endlessly and bore the bits off all of us. Next... JOANNA LUMLEY Dear YOB, I've been buying CVG for three years now and I first started in Australia. Recently I moved to a Greek island called Cyprus and I missed one issue of CVG because I thought it wasn't available over here. I was wrong. My point is, if such a small island gets copies of CVG that really proves that CVG is the best. By the way I don't care if you criticise me, just print my letter please. Here's also a poem I wrote: CVG is the best, Forget about all the rest. It's so heavy I need a Chevy To toe it home To write this poem. It doesn't take ages To flick through the pages But where I stop It's at this spot: YOB'S MAILBAG! AKIS THOMAS Nicosia, Cyprus. YOB: What's this pile of pus? An island called Cyprus.

"SUZANNE MIZZI CLAUDIA SCHIFFER Dear YOB, Lynxs are brill and anyone who says otherwise are totally sad, including you OK? Because Game Gears are 8-bit (sad or what?) Game Boys well they're so sad they're probably about 1-bit expect. EDWARD ASHWORTH Oakwood, Derbyshire. YOB: Sorry, did I miss something or are you actually A DE CARTOON JULIA SOMMERVILLE Oh dear YOB, First I would like to say that your section of CVG is the best, and it's the first thing I read when I buy this fab mag. Well anyway, I've got three questions for you to answer: 1. How long does it take for Megadrive to load (start) a game? 2. When Amiga is 16-bit, has more memory, more graphics and better sound than the Megadrive, how come Megadrive games look much faster, smoother and bigger than Amiga games? 3. Why does button C on the Megadrive joypad work as space bar on Turrican I and II on Amiga, when only b button is supposed to work. LEON NASH (Real name JAE HO) Yokogawa Electric Corporation PS Can you please send me a picture of you signed? If not, a hundred pounds will do. 1. How long will it be before you develop intelligent life? 2. How come you managed to get some spit on your stamp with a question like that? 3. Is this letter some sort of fluke? Did an infinite number of monkeys sit down with an infinite number of typewriters and come up with this? Answers on a postcard please... Dear YOB, Referring to an article in your last mailbag, are normal computers (with keys) going to die out like the Spectrum? This question crosses my mind because it has happened in the USA. In the USA several problems are happening with computers these are the ease with which games are copied (this will lead to ruin for games companies) loading times and the need to swap disks, the unversatility AO of systems and the regular faults with them. I am not a computer hater or someone who gets off on a console out of its plastic bag and I know that they have benefits eg spreadsheets, databases, word processors etc but when people strive for a more advanced system and software companies look for the most money to be made what do you think will last? IAN ROGERS, Stockport PS Referring to your mailbag it could do with a few more professional touches, like the rest of your magazine eg decent cartoons and titles which have a little class. YOB: I looked through this and tried to decide whether there was actually anything here worth commenting on. Sadly there wasn't, because it's the most boring pukepile of a letter in this month's Mailbag and I just had to print it to put you lot through the same torture I suffered. You don't like it? Tough. MICHEALA STRACHAN Dear YOB, I am thinking of buying a Super Nintendo but I'm totally confused about which version to get. Looking through the ads in your mag only makes matters worse, with USA Super Nintendos, Japanese Famicoms and UK scart and pal systems for sale. Which if any will play both UK and imported games? Which would you recommend and would I still need a convertor if I buy a scart system? Please help. D MILLS Merseyside YOB: Get youself an official UK Super Nintendo. The box contains everything you need (two joypads, scart connector etc etc) and is fantastic value for money. If you can't hang on for official UK games and want to play imports, get yourself the relevant adaptor from a grey importer they cost about thirty quid and play away. Easy, eh? ANNE DIAMOND PAT OFF EASTENDERS Dear YOB, I am a 14 year old boy and I live in Norway. I buy CVG every month because it's the computer magazine that's not so expensive than all the others. I think .75 is quite enough for the CVG and GO! are quite good to but not as good as the CVG. But why aren't there any disks on the front cover as on the CU Amiga format? Something else I have got some problems: 1. I don't dare to order from England from computer magazines. But I want me the game callet Afterburner to the computer Amiga 500 plus that I'm crying myself to bed at night, because I don't no where in Norway I can by the game, so couldn't you send me the game or at leest tell me where in Norway! could buy it from. Couldn't you send it to me free please YOB? 2. How can I make a menu to get games in out from an hard drive? 3. Why are you always a punch on every pichure you are on in the CVG. Could you never be dressed like a gentleman you could were a smooching for example. I hope you unterstand my English, because I'm not always following the English lesson at school. A little poetry: Phantom Trowery BILLY,AWT, Dear YOB, You have been subjected for termination and have only a while to live so answer these questions quick. 1. What is the best home computer Atari ST, Amiga or PC? 2. Will Populous be coming out on the Game Gear? 3. How do you get past the third end of level baddie on Gremlins 2? Why do you swear at people using words like cr**? If you have answered these questions I thank you but I have a gang of tough 14 year olds who would like to kick your butt because you are a pathetic little wimp who thinks he is a YOB, so which would you prefer, termination or the 14 year old treatment? OAVIO, ZACHO ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ALAN Sim Hollywood PS Why do all these people demand money off you in horrible ways? Oh and by the way Tim, Howley, Billy, Ant, David, Alan, Simon and Ziche would like a hundred quid each. Don't mess with them! PPS You have stupid laugh. How do I know? Wouldn't you like to know? (from Howley the hard man) YOB: 1. For sims and mega adventures, PC. For arcade games and new innovative titles, Amiga. For nothing at all, ST. 2. Very unlikely. 3. With difficulty. PS I don't need to bother. They talk enough crap on their own. PPS Ho Ho Ho. "

The phantom Strong, brave Clever, never he stops... STOP! My last word: please help me to get Afterburner to my A500 plus YOB. BAIRD OLAR OLSEN, Norway. YOB: 1. Why can't you use English mail order companies? As long as you choose a good one your money's as safe as houses. As for me giving you a copy, you'd have to be a Norwegian to think I'd do something as stupid as that. 2. First of all you get a hard drive. Then you pick up the manual which comes with the machine.

ANDREW BLACKWELL West Sussex YOB: Of course NOT! Dear YOB, Recently my grey haired old mum flipped over to Singapore on a cut price sex and sauna holiday. Good for the arteries she reckons! On one shopping trip she brought me a cart for my Gameboy called Game 24 x 1. On it are 24 games including Mario, Elevator Action, Tetris, Pipe Dream, Spiderman, Loderunner, Dr Mario, Space Invaders etc. For this brilliant package my dear old mum paid the pricely sum of $A20. I paid $A50 for that piece of crap Castlevania and all games RICK DEMPSEY XRAY are between $A20 & $230. ICANOTHER AUSTRALIAN $A50 is about one days pay after tax here and is a lot of money. CDs only cost $A25 and they're coated with gold! How about a bit more concern for the long term development of the industry by the marketers and distributors and a lot less greed! Have you guys ever considered a mail order service via your magazine and you could cut the price significantly? Your magazine is brilliant, really. I've been collecting them religiously since 1985 when I brought a 464 and a copy of Manic Miner. Mario on the Gameboy is my favourite game of all followed by Knight Lore on the Amiga and R-Type on the Sega. Your magazine goes from strength to strength and I'm constantly amazed at the sheer depth of the mag. I do miss Update that's not correct. I'd really like to see a far more dedicated Update section. Up until two years ago CVG provided an excellent chronicle of the development of computer technology as it always has, devolved directly into games technology. Please be honest with your criticisms as these games are far too expensive to waste on a dog. I was really peeved that you gave Castlevania a recommendation. Manic Miner plays more smoothly and is far more enjoyable than that crap. I'll go further and say that if I had to choose between Castlevania, Donkey Kong and Manic Miner, Castlevania I wouldn't even take it if it was free. In fact looking at the excellent packaging of Castlevania I'd say that the box would be 99.999999% of the value of the game! I didn't like Choplifter Il either. Thanks again for a terrific mag. I hope you're all multi millionaires 'cos you certainly deserve it! More power to CVG! RICK DEMPSEY Western Australia. YOB: Has it possibly crossed your rather undersized mind that different people like different games? Just because one title doesn't do the business for you doesn't necessarily mean it's crap. Take Castlevania, for example. Some people think it's one of the greatest games they've ever played while personally I can take it or leave it. The CVG boys are careful that each review game is looked at by at least one person so that individual likes and dislikes don't dominate the review and you can be sure that if it gets a good overall, it's a good game. We're also careful to warn people if we don't think it's going to be their cup of tea, but most people have a brain larger than a cherry and can decide for themselves whether they're going to like a game before they buy t. If you're so stupid that you can't understand simple logic like that I suggest you put in for a frontal lobotomy at the earliest possible opportunity because all it can do is a bit of good. KATHY LLOYD Dear YOB, Congrats on the brill new CVG. It's great! Right, that's enough sucking up from me. I have a few questions that you in all your worldly wisdom could help me with. 1. Will Streetfighter II ever appear on the Amiga? 2. If so, when? 3. Will Commodore ever bring out a multi button system to cope with such games? 5. (What happened to 4? YOB) What are your top 5 Amiga games? Well that's it from me keep up the good work. JOE HAYES Australia YOB: 1. Yes. 2. Christmas, hopefully. 3. Nope, but if the game's good enough somebody else might. 4. What DID happen to 4? 5. Formula 1, BC Kid, Kick Off 2, Sensisoccer, Lotus 3, Stunt Car Racer. VICKI MICHELLE Dear YOB, I'm not going to be a stupid mug and ask you for money or nuffin like that 'cos I 'aint like that. I've just got a few questions: 1. You said that Streetfighter II would be released on the Megadrive, please explain. 2. When will Smash TV be released on the Megadrive. 3. Will all you stupid bozos who keep saying that the Megadrive is crap... My Megadrive is better than your Famicom.... Lynxs are better than gameboys etc etc please shut up and enjoy the machine you've got. 4. Can I have some more info on the SF2 film. CHRIS BEAUMONT Suffolk YOB: 1. I've got some sad news on this one. When I wrote that SF2 was coming later negotiations were under way between top software houses. These have now hit a bit of a hitch and the project is looking uncertain. As soon as I hear more I'll let you know. 2. It's planned for November, but may slip back a couple of HEATHER LOCKLEAR Dear YOB, I would like to start off by saying! love your mag and I turn to listen to your insults the second I purchase your mag, but enough of the boot licking, I would like to ask you some questions: 1. Is there going to be a 32-bit Sega machine coming out in a couple of years called the Gigadrive? 2. If so is it going to be a cartridge or CD machine? 3) Are scart machines usually better than pal ones? "

"VEGA*SPAIN DISCIPLINE: UNKNOWN DATE OF BIRTH: 2/8/62 WEIGHT: 180lbs HEIGHT: 6'2\" BLOOD TYPE: VICTORY CRIES: «HANDSOME FIGHTERS NEVER LOSE BATTLES\" \"THANK YOU FOR A GORGEOUS TIME\" SPECIAL MOVES ROLLING CRYSTAL FLASH: With typical speed, Vega rolls towards his opponent and, with his knife claw out, delivers a terrible thrusting attack. Jump backwards and kick him in the face on the way out. IZNA DROP: Vega climbs the surrounding wire fence and jumps off the top with both arms fully outstretched, ready to inflict maximum damage. Difficult to defend against, but a well-timed uppercut can work wonders. A former matador, Vega decided that he was getting too good at keeping the bulls at bay so he set about challenging the greatest fighters in the world to try and hone his skills further. His main attack point is his sheer speed and agility. He loves to hold back on opponents and hurl himthem, sometimes clinging to the wire mesh which protects the spectactors from the action. PLUS POINTS + Very fast + Uses deadly 12\" long\" finger blades\" MINUS POINTS Very vain, hence the face mask Thinks he's still in the bullring. BISON THAILAND DISCIPLINE: SHADOW DATE OF BIRTH: 24/9/57 WEIGHT: 220lbs HEIGHT: 6'5\" BLOOD TYPE: \"O\" VICTORY CRIES: \"GET LOST, YOU CANNOT COMPARE WITH MY POWERS\". SPECIAL MOVES PSYCHO CRUSHER: Without a doubt the most flamboyant move in the whole game. Bison calls upon the energy of the Shadow masters and forms an aura around his body as he flies headfirst toward his opponent. Impossible to block, the only way to avoid this is to jump it. FLYING HEAD PRESS: Launching himself into the air, Bison comes down on his opposition's head and attacks with a flying butt. Can be very costly but if you see it early enough it's pretty easy to block. DOUBLE KNEE JERK: Bison's fiercest move. A Flying knee to the stomach followed by a knee to the head. Very energy consuming and its sheer speed means that it's difficult to defend against. PLUS POINTS + Posseses one of the most powerful special moves + Wery fast + Some moves are impossible to block. From an early age, Bison has trained in the mystical skills of The Shadow, but not much is known of this age-old and violent art. All of Bison's Sensais were massacred in an attempt to destroy the art, but he has entered the tourment to show its strength and superiority to the world. Bisor's advantg r xtreme speed and narrow mindedness. Expect: no forgiveness for mistakes MINUS POINTS Medium strength. STREETFIGHTER II 007 "

"Bucu CVG STREETFIGHTER FAVES FUSE TIM BOONE: Chun Li's the tops because she's fast as lightning and to see the look on people faces as a GIRL leaps about and kicks the crap out of them is a right old laugh! PAUL RAND: Ryu's fab because he's got great special moves and if he was a bit taller, had strawberry blonde hair and didn't wear that karate outfit all the time he'd look a dead ringer for me... PAUL ANGLIN: Guille's the greatest because he's a rock hard boyo and gets to fly F165 when he isn't kicking heads. Also, he ponces about with his hair all the time just like me... JON BILLINGTON: Zangief's top man because he grunts a lot and doesn't mess his pants when he's in on a good scrap. He's a miserable old get who doesn't take any crap and that's why he's fab. JAZ RIGNALL: Blanka's top boy because his special moves are the business. He's also got far too much hair and the ability to switch off his brain whenever he wants, just like me on a motorbike... GOING GOING GONE TO A SAD MAN! Bus Here's a true story. You probably won't believe the sadness involved, but it's true anyway. When Streetfighter 2 first came out, one dealer decided to AUCTION his last copy of the game from the first batch. The bidding started at a hundred quid. Did he hear a hundred? Course he did. A hundred and ten? A hand went up. One hundred and twenty? Another hand. One twenty five? And another. One hundred and thirty. The hands still go up. One hundred and thirty Five? They're still up there. ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS was what he got for the cart, and some sad sucker actually paid it because he couldn't wait ONE WEEK for new stocks to come in. Told you you wouldn't believe it, but it's perfectly true. Let's face it: for that much money you'd expect Chun Li to take you out on a top date AND pay for the best cinema tickets in the house... BLOODY AND BRILL Rumours swept the console world that console were going to tone down the blood in the US and UK versions of Streetfighter 2, but it's Still there in the US version and all the signs are that it won't change for the official UK version too. Thank Zangief for that! TREETFIGHTER 010 "


"YANKS A BUNDLE. If you can't wait for the Official UK version of Streetfighter 2, make sure you buy the American version of the game. For a start, the instruction manual is in English and it's one of the best there is. Second, all the in-game text is in English and it's a bit of a bummer when jap words come up at the end! Third, you can still use the game with your jap adaptor. Fourth, and best of all, it's cheaper! Some grey importers are charging around  for the game a damned sight better than the hundred quid the Jap cart first came in at! Yowser! SUUUU PADY CHUN LI E. FIONDA LANGTEE CHAMPION CHEATS AHOY! Here's the megacheat which allows you to set up fights involving the same characters just like the Championship Edition of the arcade game! If you don't know this one already you must be a bit of a sad case, but we won't hold it against you and here's the stuff you need to know: Switch on the machine and the second the Capcom jingle starts press DOWN, RIGHT, UP LEFT then Y, B, X and A. You have to do this while the Capcom logo is still on the screen and you'll know when you've got it right because you'll hear a little jingle and the options screen will turn blue. Now you and a pal can choose the same character and scrap away with no chance of the losing saddo blaming his charcater for his lack of hardness. Hurrah! CENSORSHIP CENTRAL Experts like us will notice that there are one or two differences between the Jap and American versions of the game, mostly on the backgrounds. On Ken's stage on the Jap cart, the bloke furthest right on the boat is involved in some seriously suspect five-finger activity, but it's CHANGED in the American version to make it look like he's playing with his belly button! What he actually looks like is a bloke with his arm stuck on the wrong way round, and it's so funny to watch it can even put you off your game! 011 STREETFIGHTER "


"WIN ASNES AND STREETFIGHTER 21 WE'RE GIVING ANAY FIVE GAMES! o there you have it, the greatest console game EVER gets the CVG treatment as only we know how. Still dazzled by its sheer brilliance? So are we. And the best news is this: you're still only halfway through the bloody mag! How Do we do it, eh? How do we cram so much stuff into the world's greatest games mag and STILL manage to top ourselves time after time? Well, we've done it again because here's your chance to WIN a copy of the game, courtesy of us! That's right, we've got EI.V.E. spanking new copies of the games and we're just going to give them away to the lucky people who can describe the best posssible scrap between two of the characters! Best of all, we'll even throw in a brand new SUPER NINTENDO for the best entry of the lot!! Just let your imaginiation run riot, pick any two characters and tell us what happens as they FIGHT! Remember though, nobody gets seriously duffed up in the game, so don't make it stupidly violent. What we want is a good old time reading about those megascraps, and you can even use diagrams if you want. So get on those thinking caps and fire off those entries to: MY TROUSERS ARE EXPLODING BECAUSE WANT STREETFIGHTER 2! COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. Closing date for the compo is September 14, so stop muckin' abaat and get on the case NOW! willer C CAPCOM 1991 10000 All the usual CVG rules apply which means anyone can enter as often as they like provided they're nothing to do with EMAP, especially not Paul Rand's little brother because he's already had a go on Tim's copy which Randy blagged for the weekend and he's a bit of a spawny get really. The Editor's decision is Final, although we throw a good old strop if we don't agree and sometimes he gives in but not often and there's no way on earth we're going to take phone calls from bad losers or sad whingers like Morris Reid and his brother lan who live near Leicester and win this month's Super Sadness Award for wasting our time and having identical haircuts, both of which are completely crap. Streetighter 2 is the greatest console game of all time and you if you haven't played it you don't know what you're missing. Why on Earth are you still reading this? Get scribbling! GVG 012 "

If the standard slacks, disciplinary action of the highest order will be taken and I don't just mean boring old whips and chains. I'm talking about thumbscrews, episodes of East Enders and, worst of all, a spot on Stars in Their Eyes. So make sure those scores are good and get them in to your Mistress with the most.

"BUG REVIEW GVG SUPER NINTENDO PLATFORM BY MASIYA .00 RILICE LERSIA N atch-making is getting a little out of hand these days. I mean, blind dates are one thing but kidnapping a princess and forcing her to marry you is quite another. And the noble Prince of Persia is a bit peeved at the situation. Luckily the Grand Vizier Jaffar has given the prince one last chance to save his fair maiden. If he can make it through twenty of the toughest mazes in the land and survive the onslaught of baddies then the girl will be his. But will the Jaffar keep his word? Will you keep your head? There's only one way to find out; step into the dark maze and show these guys whose tops when it comes to trouble. WHO ARE TRAP ATTACK Not only do you have to unravel the maze and try to avoid everything! There are all sorts of baddies to that moves, also figure out a way contend with in Prince of Persia, to foil the many traps which Jafranging from weak guards to nasty far's henchmen have placed knights that can be found lurking around the dungeons. The stanthroughout various levels. Other dard obstacle is the floor that falls nasties that you'll have to deal with away but these pose no real probinclude women guards, fat guards lems if you're nimble on your feet. and the real awkward skeletons. Some of the trickier traps include a There are three different types of massive Prince-Slicer, scores of these bony boys: the first is dusted blazing fires, a huge weight Simply after one hit, the second takes a aching to pound you into the few whacks to dispose of and the ground and a energy fields that third just won't lie down and die! cause instant death. 90 MINUTES LEFT Although you can't really stick Prince of Persia in the strategy/RPG category, it's far more involved than your average platform game. Some of the levels really tax your mind and will have you thinking for ages. The first things to knock you for six are the absolutely brilliant graphics! While there's nothing totally stunning in the backdrops, the character sprites are beautifully drawn and very well animated, using the same videodigitising techniques used in other versions of the game. Sound-wise, Prince of Persia scores top marks, with extremely moody tunes that echo around the caverns, and some great spot effects. But the gameplay is where this game really comes into it's own. Even the first level is of considerable size and, by the time you've reached level nine, the word 'exploration' takes on a whole new meaning! As well as being just about the largest game I've ever seen, Prince of Persia is also one of the most addictive you just can't put it down. CVG 070 PAUL ANGLIN 1111111 HE | 88 MINUTES LEFT "


"AB cool, Baby, Cool?? moo DRINK HEARTILY, PRINCE ITS A FINE POTION THAT'LL MAKE Y STRONG 109 MINUTES LEFT SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND Not everything is as it seems in the Grand Vizier's domain. Check all of the walls and ceilings, for some of them are false and hide secret rooms full to the brim with potions galore and, if you're an unlucky sort of fel. V low, mega-mean baddies! I've played Prince Of Persia on every machine it's ever been released on, and it's fair to say that this Super Nintendo version tops the lot! The basic style of gameplay has been retained, but the programmers have gone mad with restyled levels and an extra eight stages to battle through! The prince himself has undergone a slight transformation too; he's now a much more detailed sprite than before. Loads of great new enemies are in there to take on my current favourite is the many-armed bloke who bounces about trying to send you to your maker while skulls fall from the sky! And just when you think there's nothing more, the instantly addictive gameplay and superbly defined graphics of Prince Of Persia are rounded off very nicely thank you by some of the moodiest music ever to blast forth from the Super Nintendo sound chip. Very tough but very enjoyable, Prince of Persia is going to rocket to the top of everyone's list of top platform romps! PAUL RAND POTS OF POTIONS DOING THE ROUNDS With all these elements after your blood, conveniently-placed potions can be very useful, but watch out there are some less than helpful potions lying around. As well as the usual energy giving and draining drinks to be found there are vials which, if swallowed, turn the entire screen upside down. Another enables the prince to float down from a platform rather than fall and, for any depressed souls out there trying to throw a seven, an instant death potion is also available. If you've never heard of Prince of Persia until now, where on earth have you been? This game is one of the most converted titles ever, having made appearances on Amiga, ST, PC, Spectrum and even SAM Coupe computers! Console versions have surfaced recently on the Master System, Game Boy and Game Gear, and there's even talk of a live-action Mega-CD version not too far away!

"LUL REVIEW BATTLEFANK SUPER NINTENDO COMBAT SIM WE'RE ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW BY ABSOLUTE .00 The desert is a big place, but with the help of your long range radar screen you can see exactly what's going on at a glance. This display shows you everything that is in the vicinity, from enemy tanks and mine fields to Allied bases and Scud missile launchers not bad considering they couldn't be spotted in the real conflict! There's no need to keep flicking between the action screen and the map, either; you can control your tank from this screen and guide it towards the enemy. Make sure you switch back to the cockpit view before you get to the baddies though, or else you'll be a sitting duck to even the lowliest grunt. BOMB THE BASE OR NOT Summer's here, the temperature's rising and it's certainly not the weather to be driving around the Persian Gulf in an M1A1 Super tank. But that's what you must do. The war in the air has been raging for some time now and after an age of waiting the time has come to launch a ground offensive. So pull on your shooting boots, button up your khakis, open up the sunroof and let's get moving! Super Battle Tank casts you as a member of the Allied forces in the land attack on Saddam's forces. Your mission to trundle through the ten different levels destroying any enemy forces you encounter and return home to be the main feature on the News At Ten. PAUSE Just because you're stuck in the middle of a big war with enemy forces taking pot shots at you at every opportunity, doesn't mean that everything out in the desert is unfriendly. Now and then the Stars and Stripes of the good ol' US of A will appear on the map this is an Allied Base, stuffed full of goodies galore. Stop off for extra weapons, fuel, a quick repair job and, you never know, perhaps a Big Mac and fries. MB007 num THANKS... to Console Concepts (0782 712759 ) for the review cartridge. BiG DEAL! PAUSE PAUSE ROMERO selgus When Super Battle Tank first hit the office everyone went absolutely crazy about it, which surprised me because my first impressions were that this looked not very good. But I gave everyone else the benefit of the doubt and sat down for a blast. And guess what? I still didn't think it was very good. For a game that should have been an action-packed extravaganza of thrills, spills and kills, there isn't an awful lot to do or see. It may just be me, but I don't consider blowing up the odd tank or Scud launcher after trudging through an otherwise extremely bland desert particularly fun. There is the odd good pointsprites are of a reasonably high quality and there's a nice flash effect when your cannons rattle into an enemy vehicle at night but that's not nearly enough to warrant forking out forty quid plus for this poor cart. TANKED UP Your M1A1 would be a bit naff if it relied just on it's menacing looks, so to back it up it's packed with state-of-the-art antitank weaponry. This little baby is equipped with everything from a standard 120 mm cannon to M728 Armour-piercing shells. Trouble is, you have only a limited amount of armaments, so don't rush out firing them off left. right and centre you can't exactly shove a bayonet down your gun turret when you run out of missiles!

"EIVE REVIEW MEGADRIVE BLACK AND DECKERS OF DOOM! EEEEAAAAAUURGH!!......... YUK! BEAT EM UP BY SEGA .00 BY SEGAREN It's not just the end-level bosses that'll have you reaching for the sick bag there are some just as disgusting beings lurking within the levels as well! You'll be wiping out such nasties as crazed zombies, lynched babies, flying psychotic fish and horror of horrors possessed garden tools! THANKS.. to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the review cartridge. POSSESSED POSSESSIONS emonic Possession. That's not a thing that you tend to come across too often in everyday life is it? Not unless you're an unfortunate American teenager by the name of Rick. The root of Rick's evil is a possessed ice-hockey mask which, when worn, fills Rick with the desire to rip the head off anything that crosses his shadow. Rick eventually manages to free himself of the power of the mask, only to find that he must don it again in order to save his girl! She's has been kidnapped by foul beings from the darkest reaches of Hell and, loving feller that he really is, our Ricks off to rescue her from the forces of The Dark Side. In order to tip the balance a little more in his favour, Rick has number of weapons at his disposal. These include a modest iron bar, which spreads the walking gungeballs all over the wall, a twelve-bore shotgun that makes shot work of the nasties and a high power chainsaw which leaves the creepies all cut up! SPLATTERHOUSE II himselfventuall'osses, ITEN LIFE SPOOKY, EH! LIFE ITEN WHO'S A PRETTY BOY THEN? Most games feature pretty terrifying end-of-level baddies, but you've never seen anything like these boys before! We're talking blob monsters with exploding guts, frightening faces with eyeballs that pop out of their sockets and a skinless creature of the dead that transforms into a spider! With beasties like these doing the rounds, there's only one thing to do send them hurtling back to their demonic dwellings. If there's one thing to make you sit up and take notice, it's a large slice of guts and gore. And Splatterhouse Il has them both with a vengeance. The bodycount in this game is massive, and the amount of ways to kill those baddies is equally large; punch them, kick them, smash them over the head with a bone, even blow them away with a shotgun! Splatterhouse Il's sprites are very impressive, which goes some way to make up for some of the bland backdrops there's even a few which are completely bare! Action is high on the agenda, with enemies approaching almost non-stop and other obstacles to avoid, although after a time you may find a spot of repetition creeping in. But this isn't a role playing game or strategy adventure, this is mindless death and destruction that'll have you either gnashing your teeth in a bloodcrazed frenzy or cowering behind the sofa, depending on what sort of a disposition you possess!

"GVG NES NES OPEN PLATFORM woumanant Gold  Nintendo  Pantendo ao BY NINTENDO .99 One particularly impressive feature of NES Open is the putting green unlike most golf games where you just see the little ball plop into the hole or not, depending on how good you are NES Open gives you a close-up, threedimensional view of the cup (that's what golfers call the hole) which looks tops when the ball is sunk, or rather less so when you are. ed up with killing aliens? Bored rigid by seeking out the sacred crystals of Ra? Sick to the back teeth of rescuing the princess from whoever has decided to kidnap her this week? Then look no further than NES Open! Death and mutilation is put to one side in favour of a relaxing round of golf, aided and abetted by the one and only Mario! Eighteen-hole fun and hilarity awaits aspiring Faldos and wannabe Woosnams, with a variety of options and courses designed to single out the golfing greats from the putting prannies. Some may say that golf is a good walk spoilt, but NES Open lets you play a round without even having to leave your chair. JES OPEN TOURNAMENT GOLF 131 5 mph DIST 91 No, Nintendo aren't afraid of sticking Mario into totally unconnected product! Our moustachioed matey pops up a number of times during NES Open. He takes the shots, under your control of course, and he also picks the ball up and waltzes off to the next hole once you've put it in the cup. And, depending on whether you sank the ball under, on or over par, you'll hear a different tune resonate around the course with Mazza showing an appropriate expression on his face! That's gone in the rough. Not very good are you? 254 Hey that green's not at all green! That's a Jong drive can it make the green? NES Open is a highly playable, extremely attractive title which just oozes quality. The fact that Mario is the star doesn't hurt at all, but it's not that which makes this game so good. Graphics are HAIR big, bold and RAISING colourful, and the 3D effect on the green is fantastic although not, I might point out, when your ball is teetering on the edge of the cup but it won't go in. Why can't TVs have motion detectors so that you can shake the screen and make the ball fall in? Gameplay is easy to learn but very hard to master you'll start off with a really crappy score, but perseverance is the key and after a while, you're handicap will come whizzing down! It's basically because NES Open is the best golf game available for the NES and with the golf season still in full swing, it! couldn't have come at a better time! A damn sight more fun than having to suck up to horrid Old Boys Network types down at the local club just for a crack at the Krazy Putt kiddy course! GVG 076 PAUL RAND There are a number of important factors to take into consideration when readying yourself for a crack at the ball. First, and perhaps the most important of them all, is club selection. After all, there's no point in picking up a 240yard driver when your trying to delicately place the ball on a green that's only 150 feet away! Next up is wind: it can get very blowy out there on the course, which will influence the direction in which you hit the ball. And speaking of direction, give that a quick check before you tee-off it can be very infuriating, after meticulously planning what should be a match winning iron-shot, to watch it sail into a clump of large trees because you didn't notice which way the ball was going to head off!

"U HOTSHOTS TEL : EEEEF 1992. bens ea by ELECTRONIC ARTS O MEGADRIVE MEYVEZ 2. GIAL! ig news for EA Hockey fans gagging on the sequel to one of the greatest Megadrive sports games ever. NHLPA '93 is here! Well, actually it's NOT the sequel to EA Hockey, but a bloody good game in its own right! In case you're very silly and don't know any better, EA are top men when it comes t putting together a sports game. Now they're putting the finishing touches to NHLPA '93 and if you don't know what that stands for, it's the National Hockey League Player's Association. NHLPA '93 isn't so much a sequel to EA Hockey, more of a revamped version of the original. It plays exactly the same, but there are loads of extra features crammed in and the inclusion of real ice hockey stars such as Wayne Gretzky, and actual team colours. Gameplay is similar to the first game, with features like the sin-bin, where players are put for a vari ety of offences, and a great action-replay mode that lets you fast-forward and rewind through the action! Electronic Arts stress that NHLPA '93 isn't a game for owners of the original EA Hockey, and that it's out there for the benefit of newcomers to the Megadrive scene. We've played it and it's great check it out if you haven't got the first cart! HED CHIT NYE TDS NYR NYB 1 NYR TWISTED FLIPPERS ELECTRONIC ARTS MEGADRIVE t might sound like the name of a rather loud heavy metal band, but Twisted Flipper is a fab-looking pinball sim from those busy beavers at Electronic Arts! Only the second such game to appear on the Megadrive, it's got some pretty hot competition in the form of the ridiculously excellent Devil Crash but already things are looking good! So what's Twisted Flipper got? Secret bonuses, multi-level tables and megabonuses are just a taste of what is in store for lucky players when EA put this one out on the streets. Having had an early blast of Twisted Flipper, the only minus point we noticed was that the movement of the ball wasn't always entirely convicing. Still, EA tell us they're going to fix that, as well as shovel in a horde of extra-special features! Sounds good to us don't miss the CVG Review, coming your way soon! Bar cvG 086 "

"BUS HOTSHOTS F117A STEALTH FIGHTER F15 III Task Force 1942 OPCOMICROPROSE NES PC umme mummy! Microprose have been busy beavers of late and no mistake! Now they're planning to launch an avalanche of goodies onto the games world, including conversions onto console of some of the greatest home computer games of all time! You've probably already read about most of them in the News section, but here are a few at Preview stage to drool over right here! First up comes Stealth Fighter on the NES, a conversion of the outrageously good Amiga, PC and ST blast. As you can see, the game is looking well tasty and from the sneaky peak we've had it's moving darned fast for an 8-bit machine! Obviously the console version is a scaled down version of the original, but Microprose are confident that they've left all the best bits in! Keep those eyeballs right here for the full Review treatment soon! Next up comes F15 III on the PC follow-up to the brill follow-up of one of the fabbest home computer games ever! This time round Microprose are promising smoother graphics and loads of extra features some of 'em so secret even the CVG boys haven't been told! First thing that's going to grab you are the graphics, and fabbo they certainly are, and from what we've seen the game looks set to match the standard! And if that's not enough, PC fans can also look ahead to Task Force 1942 on the PC, the first in a new series of war sims featuring the Microprose touch. What with tons of explosions, burning and sinking ships, night combat, falres, torpedos and other stuff this looks like something a bit special. As you see, the graphics look totally ace and the game will feature some serious, er, depth. All these goodies are planned for roughly autumn time, and rest assured we'll be bringing you all the Reviews first as usual!

"LG HOTSHOTS TRIJDLERS ARMOUR-GEDDON IS NOW PAUSED. okus and Pokus are constantly causing trouble but this is severe, even for them! Divinus, their magical master, told them to clean out the storeroom in the hope of keeping them out of mischief for a day or two. As they toddled down the steps Divinus yelled at them 'And don't touch anything!' But the mischievous lads could not resist the temptation to open a box of Troddlers and before you could say 'Oops!', the Troddlers leaped out and dived into the transporter. Low quality plot it may be, but the game itself could fare somewhat better. A similar concept to Lemmings but sporting quite different gameplay, Troddlers is a puzzler that could well cut the mustard when it's released in October... MU DOO NE L TE HAM 2008 999999 QLOLO ARMOU PSYGNOSIS AMIGA DOO0 7 MAS ot content with selling squillions of copies of their 3D epic Armour-Geddon, Psygnosis have gone and written a sequel as as you can see from these screenshots it's looking pretty flippin' good! The original cast you as a futuristic soldier behind the wheel (or yoke, or anything else for that matter) of some really serious deathmobiles in a host of different landscapes, dishing out death and devastation to all and sundry. The only real problem with the original was that it was a touch slow and the gameplay could be accused of being a tad repetitive. But we're promised no such hiccups in the follow-up, which is due to appear in October. Apparently the game sticks very much to the original format but adds better graphics, improved sound and much deeper gameplay. Should be a corker if they manage to pull it off it's certainly looking good so far. Watch this space for more info the very second it arrives! E 1211 TEAM 17 AMIGA leam 17 have been a bit on the quiet side of late. No, the lads from Yorkshire haven't been out roistering away all the hard-earned they collected from sales of Alien Breed (a special version of which is being released on budget soon!) and the good-looking but bloody hard Project X they've been hammering away at their latest creation, Assassin! The evil dictator is hiding away from his less-than-happy subjects, deep within his underground lair. Not being the most pleasant boyo to grace high office, the people are searching for a hero to go deep into his lair and, well, assassinate him. And wouldn't you know it you've been volunteered for the task! Don't worry! too much, though: you're super fit and highly athletic as well as highly suicidal. Graphic excellence is the order of the day in Assassin, with the animation of the main character alone consisting of over a hundred frames! If this can manage to follow in the footsteps of their two previous fine efforts, Team 17 are onto a real winner here. Review coming soon miss it and you'll be a sad case. GVG 090 "

"BU HOTSHOTS AVG ames Pond is back! The secret agent star of Robocod returns in a multilevel extraveganza which ties in very nicely with the current sports fever! Aquabatics is the name, and the plot revolves around James having to get fit for his next big mission (not at all a hint for a further Pond adventure stay tuned to CVG for further info!). You see, James likes to keep fit to keep in shape only lately, that shape's been a sack of spuds so it's out onto the track for a series of wacky piscine events! Millenium, the lads who wowed the world with the two previous James Pond games, are once again the team behind Aquabatics, published by EA. We've already had a right good play of an early version of the game and it's looking a right top treat! Stay glued to these pages for the full Review soon, and in the meantime just drool over these goodies! TRAINING AT STROCORRO LEBR FISHY, FISHY Feed The Fish will have you tearing your hair out with frustration! James is stood on a bridge, at either end of which is a vending machine full of sweeties. The object of the game is to fill your pockets with chews, bubblies and the like, then feed them to the fishes underneath the bridge. It's a madcap race to keep those fishies happy if you don't, you fail! AQJZATIONES TOME 00:00 Rommt.mmm.mt TIME ALLROOS OBCO ti m.iii.mimininta. 0 190 19 ASS-KICKING PENGUINS OF DOOM! Not for James the sad, racing around the track stuff that humans do! Our aquatic agent gets up to all sorts of way-out things and, although there are a couple of running events, they've been created with tongues very firmly embed ded in cheeks. Just try standing around after the starting gun's been fired . a big penguin comes along and kicks you up the ass! 00: OS: DG cvG 092 "


"EVE BATICS ELECTRONIC ARTS MEGADRIVE O THISH GO ON FLIP A Ever flipped a clam before? No, we didn't think so. But now you can! Pond has to use the clams to pop the balloons at the top of the screen, by nudging them with his flipper then, when they're high in the air, catching them in a bowl then launching them at the balloons. Clear the lot, and mind you don't stand on the black clams they cause you to lose all the critters you've collected! JAMES AND HIS BOUNCING Another event has James trying not to wake up a herd of sleeping seals. Not to difficult you may think, and you'd be right except for the annoying get who keeps throwing beach-balls at the poor creatures. Old Pondy's got to head the balls off the screen if a seal gets whacked twice, he wakes up and runs away! SPONGE BOUNCING 0100 9cOQB DO 1971 well Bouncing about on sponges in a castle may not immediately appeal to you, but in aquabatics it's a right good giggle. A bit like the Hot-Dogging event on Ski Sunday, James must bounce high up in the air before performing a variety of twists and turns. You're judged on each one you attempt, and the object is to perform a certain amount of each move to win the event! Communities TI GVG 093 "
