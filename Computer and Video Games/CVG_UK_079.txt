The chap getting to play the escapee gets to slash vaguely at his captors, and collect gold and other less identifiable items when they collapse as skeletons at his feet. playing this, the whole thing was just too frustrating.

I say suitably. as this is really a sword over your head, since your reserves drop at an alarming rate. Really, you have to eat something every two minutes or less, which gets to be a real pain quite rapidly. What this also tends to mean is that the game is biased towards the pursuers, enough to make the whole thing a bit of a farce. I can't pretend I spent very long "

"clear over to the other side of the screen. This is pretty important, because if you are forced off the side of the screen you will fall to your death. You can practice fighting in two player mode, though as far as I can see this only gives you one level to play on. In one player mode, the subsequent levels are loaded from tape. Whilst the backgrounds are very nice, and there are some good sound effects and flashes and bangs, the characters aren't particularly well designed or animated. For a start, both look the same except for the colour of yours in a clinch. The animations don't have enough frames to make them smooth, so, for instance, if you try a high kick you suddenly find yourself moving straight from a standing start into a flying leap. It's this sort of lack of thoroughness which keeps Shanghai Karate firmly in the realms of \"OK budget game\" rather than \"right little cracker GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY "

"ancient derivation. Revenge of Doh is exactly what you'd expect from a follow-up: it's tougher, has more gimmicks, and is bigger. But basically it's more of the same old formula; move your bat from left to right along the bottom of the screen, bouncing the ball into rows of bricks until you have cleared each psychedelic screen. This time the weapon capsules which drop from the shattered bricks come two or three at a time, rather than singly. They also feature a wider range of enhancements to your bat. Apart from expanded size, lasers, glue, and slow ball, there are some nifty new ones; a nasty bat reducer, a doubler which gives you two bats at a time, and a ball multiplier which seems to fill the screen with wildly bouncing spheres. My favourite new weapon is the ghost bat\", a sort of shadow following you along the screen. More useful "

Other functions include energy points where you can refuel, teleports each of which has its own identity code, and an energy-draining \"smart bomb which will clear the screen of all guardians. If this all sounds terribly familiar, you'll get the idea that Herobotix doesn't do much to make the adrenalin flow. It would be different if the action took place at a breakneck pace, but it's all rather relaxing and more likely to make you want to put your feet up and take a nap. Not much incentive to buy unless you are the sort who enjoys slogging through a complex game merely for the pleasure of finishing it, and doesn't expect too much excitement along the way.

Less irritating are the blocks which reappear a few seconds after you zap them. Another gimmick is that while there are 66 screens to play, you can choose to some extent which you encounter. Once each screen is cleared, you can exit either to the right or the left, so if you fail to cope with any screens you can avoid them on subsequent plays. Inevitably, though, you'll end up fighting the alien on the last level, where there are no capsules to help you. "

Sherlock's task is to find the jewels before 9 o'clock on Monday, for the Coronation festivities. Today is Friday, June 17th, 1887, according to your copy of the Thames. The only clue left behind by the thief is a sheet of paper on which has been written a number of verses. Not missing a trick, Holmes is certain that the thief knows the way that he thinks, and has deliberately laid a trail for him to follow. He therfore suggests that you, Watson, should decide what to do, in order to fool the thief. It is not long past 5am as you step out into Baker Street, the thick London fog swirling around you, and the great detectivefollowing. After reading the cryptic verses carefully, a quick look at the map of London supplied with the package, gives you a few ideas, and it seems wherever you are headed you have a fair walk ahead so perhaps a cab...?

"through this sentence this far, highly recommended. Nice introduction by Neil Gaiman, too. (Titan Books, .50) The return of Luther Arkwright for real, this time...\"Is the world finally ready for Luther Arkwright?\" I asked, rather foolishly last October. The world may have been, but this time Arkwright himself wasn't ready. The promised volume two of Bryan Talbot's Adventures of Luther Arkwright didn't materialise. In fact, the delay in publication has probably helped drum up a larger readership for the new book, as meanwhile four issues of the beautifully packaged comic book serialising the first volume have appeared. And now that book two is with us, I have to say it's been worth the wait. Inside the bizarre and beautiful cover you'll find the now obligatory introduction by Alan Moore, exquisitely detailed rendering (the world's first pebble-dashed comic book?), the most intense death/rebirth sequence I've seen (and at my age adornment to any bookshelf, etc, etc. Nor is Giraud's technique in question. But I'm no longer convinced, as was when the first two books in this six-volume edition appeared, that now is the time for Moebius to take the world by storm. And why? I suppose it all comes down to this: in his ideals, in the childlike innocence of some of his characters, and in the sheer... er ... cosmicity of his stories, he comes across as no more than a glorified and sometimes self-glorified old hippy, and as anyone with an ounce of cool will tell you, the next hippy revival isn't due until 1990 at the earliest. I'm being churlish, of course. Moebius is a fine addition to the series, containing as it does the further adventures of Stel and Atan from volume one, and especially now that Titan in the UK are co-publishing with Epic in the US. This arrangement brings down the price of a copy by about a pound, to .95. In any case, if you've bought the other four, this one is "

"What makes the wait worthwhile is that not only has the comic-reading public caught up with him, but so has his own technique.

(Valkyrie Press, .95) More on Moebius...

All blows will do at least one point of damage though, regardless of what type of armour your character wears, as this represents the brusing damage a character receives in combat.

A first level character starts with no armour, but if it progresses and manages to earn enough money to buy some, there are a few things the intrepid adventurer should bare in mind!! First of all, the first three classes of armour (ACI to AC3) are not actually worn by the character, it is just assumed that you do so. However, armour that is Ac4 and above, HAS TO BE WORN!!

If you're quick enough you can blast'em to bits. If not, Well.. you'll soon learn to spped up your reactions. The ultimate idea is to power up the five generators per level and progress through to the next one. There are nine levels in all. The trouble is that besides the problems of the aliend attacks, the generators run down at slightly different rates and to succeed you have to work out the best sequence to visit them. The sequence becomes more complete the further you progress into the game. There is also a time limit in which you must complete the task. You can move left or rifht on each level and will eventually complete a loop. The graphics are almost surreal in colour and the Insectoid and his Runner are really neat. If I'm honest, the "

I found this extremely hard to do because turning him in tight comers and guiding him upstairs is very tricky. Before the Panther gets anywhere near a mansion, he must go to the Butler's Agency. They will ask him if he has a top hat fit for the job and if he doesn't he'll be dispatched to the shop to buy one. This part of the game is decidedly tedious. It would have been better if you could just start off in the mansion and get straight on with the business of nicking all the valuables. It is particularly annoying to have to go through this rigmarole every time the old codger bumps into something. To avoid this happening the Panther does have a number of items at his disposal that he can use to guide his boss.
