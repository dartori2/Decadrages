"CONTENTS COMPUTER No 1 November 1981 & VIDEO Try to think of something more exciting than a computer. What did you come up with: A trip up the Amazon, scoring a goal for England, landing on Mars or, maybe, beating the bank at Monte Carlo? A computer will give you the chance to do any of these in your own living room. And if you came up with some more illicit excitement, then perhaps you should be put in touch with a businessman I met who sends his programs out in plain brown wrappers! Surprised? Then COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES is the magazine to tell you just what you're missing out on. If you have already discovered computers you will know that their only limitation is the programmer's imagination COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES is out to push your imagination to its limits. This magazine is putting the accent firmly on the \"games\" side. We are not commenting on computers as hardware, but as a means to an endand that end is entertainment. This is the age of the microchip and if you are not making the most of it. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES aims to show you how.

"INNOVATIVE TRS-80 SOFTWARE FROM THE PROFESSIONALS SHUTTLE This program is a highly accurate computer simulation of the flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia from the initial countdown through the launch period, the launch itself and into a stable orbit. The craft may be manoeuvred within the orbit and then dropped out to finally fly through the atmosphere to a safe touchdown. The attraction of this simulation is its authenticity. So far as is possible, it follows the actual parameters of the first Columbia flight with only one or two minor exceptions. The shuttie, of course, starts its flight pointed vertically into the sky and carries a huge fuel tank to provide the fuel for its three main engines in addition to the solid fuel rockets which provide the major thrust to lift it off the ground. Two minutes into the flight the rockets are jettisoned, having burned all their fuel. The count-down for take off starts at T-20 seconds. At T-10 seconds the shuttle motors start firing, but the shuttle remains tethered until T=0. When the shuttle blasts off, the pilot must guide the craft into its orbit by controlling its attitude and track. A number of guidance controls are supplied, together, of course, with control of the shuttle motors' thrust. The simulation may be started at one of three points in time: either at take off, at a point where the Columbia is in a stable orbit round the earth, or finally, prior to landing. Measurements of speed, fuel and so on may be selected for either Metric or Imperial measurements. All of the physical forces which acted upon the actual flight are taken into account. One departure from fact has been included in that the two solid fuel rockets have had their thrusts increased from 26 to 36 million Newtons so as to give the pilot an increased latitude for error. In other words to make the take off easier. A fascinating program, the more so because it follows fact so closely.

"}n TRS-80 SOFTWARE FROM THE PROFESSIONALS NOW 2 & 3 ARE OUT AS WELLII } MYSTERIOUSIEN 1967 We are pleased to be able to announce the commencement of a new series of Adventure games. The series named 'Mysterious Adventures' is written in machine language by B. Howarth, an English author. The first episode is entitled \"'The Golden Baton\". The scenario is that you have been sent by the ruler of your own land to a strange province with the mission of discovering the whereabouts of the legendary Golden Baton of Ferrenuil, King of the Ancient Elf Kingdom. The baton mysteriously disappeared several years ago and whilst others have ventured to the land in an attempt to discover it, none have returned to tell their tale! The program follows what has become the normal structure for Adventure programs. Like the original main frame Adventure, directions can be designated by just the first letter of the compass point and commands may be optionally entered with just the first three letters of the appropriate word. As usual provision is made for saving the game at any stage and such standard commands as Help. Inventory, Score and Quit are all available. Experienced adventurers will inevitably draw comparisons between this series and that of Scott Adams, so we will leave it to them to make their judgements! The only comment that we will make at this time is that we find it quite invigorating to play an Adventure game by a different author as obviously they construct their stories slightly differently. Mysterious Adventure 1, 'The Golden Baton\" is available on cassette for TRS-80 or Video Genie machines of 16K or more and on disk for 32K up machines. It occupies a full 16K. The tape versions save their game to tape and the disk to disk. Tape version ...........75 Disk version ...........00 Both prices plus VAT and 75p P. & P.

"signal it recognises so you do not have to hurry if you have a long enough program on the tape. If you are able to load a program but find it corrupted try turning the volume level down as this may be distorting the signal. Also check the state of the batteries, if you are using them, or. preferably, use a mains adaptor if you can. TAPING THAT SINCLAIR PROBLEM INFURIATING KIT CLANGER Dear Sir, Sinclair claims that the ZX81 will accept a tape input from any cassette recorder with either a 4 ohm or 8 ohm output. This may be true but for some reason I have found it impossible to reload my own programs once they have been recorded. Why is this? Puzzled, London N7. Our resident expert replies: Most portable tape machines these days have two sets of inputs and outputs. One set will be a 5-pin DIN standard socket. This may be used to record from the ZX8l but cannot be used to reload. The other set will be a pair of 3.5 millimetre jack sockets. One will be for the microphone and marked \"MIC\" and the other will, hopefully, be the 4 ohm or 8 ohm output. This should be used to load programs. To begin with I had trouble loading programs into the computer once I had recorded them. For some reason I was using the same side of the jack-to-jack plug lead supplied for reloading. Only when I swapped them over to the other lead did I realise that one side was an open circuit, so check both before throwing your THIS is a page of opportunity.

If you are interested please drop a line to: the editor, Computer & Video Games, EMAP, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JD. Well you didn't have much chance to write to us before this first issue so we put together some letters of our own, by asking the North London Computer Club for two of the problems they have been faced with and then providing answers to them. It was all a bit too easy so we hope you'll test us some more in the future. cassette machine out of the window! Sinclair suggest that if you cannot get the program to enter you should vary the volume level until the ZX81 accepts the signal. Once you have pressed LOAD and RETURN the computer will wait forever or until it gets a Dear Sir, One of the most infuriating mistakes I have seen with kit building is incorrect component insertion. Not only are components in the wrong places but they are also put in the wrong way round. While excuses can be made for components with unrecognisable markings e.g. capacitors, diodes or transistors, they cannot be made for chips especially when boards are marked with the layout. Angry North London. Our kit correspondent replies: I too have found a problem with chip identification recently which has made me look again at the subject. Most good kits or self-assembly boards are supplied with a good diagram indicating the correct position of each chip. Some, however, do not and just specify the end or corner with the \"dot\" that corresponds to pin 1. This, in some cases, is not enough. Most chips are configured as shown below. This shows a cutout, A, a recessed hole, B, and the \"dot\", C. Pin l is clearly indicated by the \"dot\", C. In figure 2. however, C is omitted and the recessed hole, B, could be mistaken for the \"dot\".   roc FIG.1 FIG.2 The safest method I have found is to combine A and C to indicate the top of the chip and depend on either if the other is missing. Pin 1 is then always to the left if the chip is pin down on the table and the cutout, A, and/or the \"dot\", C, are away from you. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 17 "


"COMPETITION WIN A TAITO SPACE INVADERS OF YOUR OWN LOOKING FOR A GOOD HOME! Imagine having a Taito space invaders machine of your very own. It could be the centrepiece of your living room or plugged into your bedroom. That is the marvellous prize which Taito has kindly put up for the winners of the Know your Creatures Competition. The arcade game industry recognises space invaders as a oneoff success and it is convinced there will never be another game like it. The way it caught people's imaginations make it a classic of its kind. A success that no amount of new machines will ever repeat. If you win this prize you will have more than just an enthralling game in your living room but a slice of the world's leisure history. Do you remember that first game of space invaders? It was probably back in 1979 when Britain first went space invaders crazy. I can recall struggling with the tactics of this bizarre game in a South London pub. Without any idea of whether it HAVE YOU KILLED ONE OF THESE? Do you know a space invader from a galaxian? Or can you tell an Asteroid spacecraft from a Phoenix one? If so then you could find yourself owning a Taito space invaders machine. Anyone who knows his pub and arcade game machine characters will be in with a chance of showing off a space invaders table to visiting friends. If you can put a name to the three creatures shown below then you will be well on your way to having that prize in your living room. All you have to do is write beside each picture below what machine that particular creature features in. For example if you KNOW YOUR CREATURES/1 think the first creature comes from a Puckman or Mazeman machine, then write either word beside him we will know what you mean. Then answer the question below in not more than 25 words and cut out this section of the magazine but do not post it yet. Hang on to it! For in our December and January issues there will be another three graphics characters and then another three. When you think you have all nine then send the three sections back to us. This gives you time to hunt around your local arcade if there is a creature you are not sure of and make certain of the right answer. The first correct answer picked out of the hat will have that space invaders table. was worth shooting the flying saucers that soared across the top of the screen or whether I should go for the space invaders on the edge, or that bottom row. I was wiped out long before the first wall even looked like being cleared. Feeling certain I could improve on my meagre score I was already reaching for that next 10p before I noticed that a good number of coins had already accumulated on top of the machine and that half the pub was lined up behind me waiting to have a go. It is a measure of just how addictive space invaders is that I scoured the pubs for another machine for weeks. My dream then was to have a space invaders machine of my very own, so that I didn't have to wait for a free machine in pubs or keep travelling up to the bar for my change. Now for one lucky reader, Taito the name behind the original space invaders craze will make that dream come true. With such an opportunity, you could soon be rivalling the top scores of the video game world champions.

"FOR TO 3 THE LATEST, AND INDEED THE GREATEST M OF THE KANSAS ARCADE SERIES ARCADE SCRAMBLE TANDY TRS 80, VIDEO GENIE 1 Don't waste your time playing the simple starts to the Big Five games get straight into the heavy action with this brand-new multi-action, home grown 'Arcade game. Yes, it's the famous one of the Arcades, and the first time it's ever been achieved on a computer, Not that easy though, for without warning suddenly there's a squadron of enemy fighters heading straight at you hell bent on your destruction. Then comes the ack-ack flung at you from the ground batteries to add to your difficulties, and there's the cluster of blimps to make things even more difficult. But the real nasties are the rockets, which the enemy blast at you, without warning, from the ground installations Even if you manage to out-shoot, out-fight, out-manoeuvre that little lot, you still have the mountains to negotiate which is a problem with the fighters streaming through the only available space. But with this really unbelievable game, you have no less than six different controls at your fingertips, being able to move your bomber forward, backward, up and down, whilst at the same time both firing your guns at the enemy and bombing the installations. And not only do you have infinite control over the bomber, but the ground and enemy installations continuously unfold below, with valleys and mountains actually moving across the screen, giving an hitherto undreamed of realism. The installations include rocket launch pads, ack-ack batteries, forts, munition dumps and fuel dumps. You do your damnedest to destroy these as they unfold below, so building up your score. The famed Mike Chalk who created Arcade Invaders and U-Boat Strike, has teamed up with Chris Smyth to create this fantastic machine language Arcade game. There is so much happening it really is unbelievable with sound adding to the realism of this ultra-fast moving game. .50 Programs are for the Tandy TRS 80 and Video Genie.

The Turk's secret survived intact from 1769 to 1834. Twenty years later the ingenious creation was destroyed by fire, its final resting place being the Chinese Museum in Philadelphia. The story of the Turk is told in fascinating detail in The Great Chess Automaton by Charles Michael Carroll. OF ALL the innumerable games appearing on computers, large and small, Chess is one of the few which has a genuine existence in the same form outside the computer environment. The history of the ancient game covers many hundreds of years and, indeed, among the first books ever printed in English — by Caxton was one on Chess. The success of computers in making in-roads into the complex field of intellectual endeavour has been remarkable, with the best programs now performing at a level to which few regular club or county-level players could ever aspire and beginning to cause problems even for experienced masters. Exactly what has been achieved, and what has not, will be one of the perennial topics of this series. In each issue I hope to include a combination of historical and background material, together with up-to-date reports on tournaments particularly microcomputer tournaments — and product reports. The idea of a chess-playing machine has a long history, pre-dating that of the electronic computer by many years. An automatic chess player built in 1769 by the Hungarian, WolfThe second world microcomputer championship was held in West Germany in September, under the auspices of both the International Computer Chess Association (ICCA) and the International Chess Federation (FIDE).

The automaton chess-player was built in wood in the form of the upper portion of the torso of a man, approximately life-size and dressed in the clothing of a Turk, complete with turban and cloak. The figure was seated at a chest on which a chess-board was placed. Before each game the doors of the chest were opened to reveal a complex collection of gears, pulleys and levers. During the game the opponent's moves were made on the board in the usual way, with the Turk's moves being played by itself with its left hand. Needless to say, Von Kempelen's Turk was no more than an elaborate hoax, with a man hidden inside the chest, detecting the opponent's moves by means of magnets and working the Turk's arm by means of a pantograph, while being confined to a small area lit by a candle. Even knowing of the hoax, the Turk remains an extremely impressive invention. Not only did the public demonstration appear to show that the whole of 21. NXN, R-K2; 33. R-QN1, P-B3; 22.

As an incentive to the ambitious chess programmer, the Fredkin Foundation of Cambridge, Massachusetts has recently established a prize of $100,000 for the first computer program to beat the world human champion in a match. Although the goal still seems well out of reach, the improvements made in the last few years are most impressive. The purpose-built chess machine Belle — much larger than Sensory Voice Challenger but probably still just qualifying as a microcomputer won the world computer chess championship convincingly in Linz last year against computers of all sizes and has since attained a performance rating around 2,300 on the U.S. Chess Federation scale, a very high master rating. * a b c d e f g h Position after Black's 29th move COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 27 "

"OTHELLO By Tom Napier LET us start by clearing-up the terminology. Reversi is better known these days as Othello but that is a recent name for a game the programming of Othello in Reversi for at least 100 years. I hope to give some guidelines to the tactics of the game and then show how a relatively simple-minded Basic program can play a reasonable game. I believe that it is possible to write an unbeatable Othello program but that would require a larger computer than most readers are likely to have available and it would have to be written in Assembler language to be fast enough to suit a human's idea of reasonable thinking time. If one rates games by the ratio of the subtlety of their strategy to the simplicity of their rules, Othello rates very high indeed. Unlike most games which evolve slowly from move to move, the position of an Othello game can change dramatically with a single move. Indeed, a good computer program can beat even expert human opponents regularly, simply by being better-equipped to keep track of a succession of complex board positions. A beginner, and a very simple computer program, might play by always looking for the move which turns over the most opposing pieces. That strategy will lose to any player with a little experience because the Othello player soon learns that what matters in the early stages of the game is not how many pieces one has but where they are situated. It is not until the last dozen or so moves that sheer numbers of pieces are important. What matters is how useful a piece is as a back-stop to help the capture of other pieces and how vulnerable it is to being captured. That means that the board corners are very important, for a corner piece can never be captured. Positions on the edge of the board are also useful, since they can be captured only by other edge moves. A great deal Reversi, now popular under the trade name Othello, is a two player game, played on an eight by eight square board with 64 double sided counters, let's suppose them to be black and white. Each player places a piece in turn with his own colour uppermost. The first four pieces are played on any of the four centre squares of the board but thereafter a piece can only be placed next to an opponent's piece so as to create a line of one or more adjacent opposing pieces between the piece just played and one of one's own. The intervening opposing pieces are then turned over to exhibit one's own colour. If more than one line of pieces meet these conditions at a single move then all the 'trapped' pieces are turned over. If at any stage a player cannot make a legal move he passes and his opponent makes the next move. If neither can make a legal move, for example, when the board is full, the game is over and the winner is the player with the most pieces of his colour visible on the board. electronic player but a reasonable game can be played by adopting some fairly simple tactics. These tactics can be translated into estimating a desirability figure for each square on the board — much the same as the points system in chess. The idea is then to move to achieve the highest sum of desirables of all the captured squares. In essence, that is a one-move, look-ahead strategy. A more sophisticated program would look ahead for many more moves. The figure shows the position at an early stage of a typical game. White has played first and it is White's turn to play. He has a choice of nine legal moves, indicated by the numbered squares. Of those, 1 and 9 would capture one black piece; 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 would capture two; 8 would capture three; and 6 would not only capture three black pieces but would also establish White on a previously-unoccupied side. Unfortunately, to play on 6 would be a fatal error, since Black could move immediately into the bottom left corner by capturing the three white pieces in the bottom row. That would establish him in a very advantageous position. Thus White's only safe move is in square 9, since that avoids the threat to his pieces on the bottom row. If this threat had not been present the move at 6 would have been the best choice, whereas a move at 1, though on an edge square, would have been rather pointless since the piece placed at I would be re-captured immediately. ABCDEFGH 4 50 00 OU AWNof the strategy of Othello consists of forcing your opponent into a position where he is obliged to move adjacent to an edge or a corner and so allowing you to establish a piece in one of those strategic locations. The correct positioning of pieces along an edge so as to minimise an opponent's gains requires considerable thought on the part of either a human or  Next month this page will deal with the problems of programming a microcomputer to play that increasingly popular game of Go. The January issue will feature Bridge. Tom Napier will be back to give you further insights into the programming of Othello in our February issue. "

"Can you find the passage which will beat the computer and give your pieces victory? A colourful boardgame comes to life on the screen. Rainbow Passage runs on a VIC-20. By Ivor Stones RAINBOW PASSAGE Rainbow Passage is a first class example of how a board game can be brought to life on a computer screen. A simple strategy game, Rainbow Passage makes good use of the Commodore VIC-20's colour graphics facilities and the addition of appropriate sound effects give a dimension which cardboard games cannot match Your objective is simply to get one of the diamond-shaped pieces at the bottom of the screen to the top of the board before the computer can move one of his tokens to the bottom Taking alternate turns, you and the computer each move one of your four tokens forwards, either to the square directly in front or the one diagonally left or right. You go first and indicate which piece you wish to move. Then the computer asks which of the three possible squares you wish to move onto. The only rule you have to follow is that the colour of the square you move onto must be the same as one of the colours directly in front of a computer piece. These simple rules are the foundation on which you will build a cunning colour strategy. Ideally you should select a route to the other side of the board which will always put the same colour directly in front of you, taking care first to position your other three tokens so that they are behind the same colour. Should the idea of the computer beating you prove unbearable, fear not because the understanding VIC will let you cheat a little. But don't expect it to go unnoticed. Watch out when opposing pieces get too close to one another as the rules allow pieces to be taken although it is not always good tactics. Also be warned that if you move a piece onto a square already occupied by one of your pieces, you will be penalised 42 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

By Paul Jay A swarm of locusts has nothing on the Nibblers. And trying to keep the little devils in check can be a fulltime occupation as they try to eat their way through a dam protecting the town lying next to it. From a bomber plane, patrolling the skies above the town, your task is to blast the Nibblers as they swoop over the town to bite chunks out of the dam with their iron-like jaws. The dam is located on the left hand side of the screen and players can choose their own thickness but be warned, Nibblers make short work of thin dams.

"Let the computer become your lifeline to fate through the mysteries of the Tarot Tarot runs on a Tandy TRS-80 in 16K. By Frank Rowlett SECRETS OF LI FORCE ROI DE BITON. Something about the mysterious Tarot appeals to even the most sceptical of us. It is one of the ancient arts mankind turned to when superstition held more sway than it does now. And with its elaborate decorations and air of mysticism, the Tarot pack was always predes tined to find favour again in the 20th Century. Whether the secrets of the Tarot can transfer sucein in the cessfully to that fortune teller of our age, the computer, we'll leave you to judge. It is also up to you whether you use the intriguing program as a party piece or give it some deeper significance. The Tarot pack is the forerunner of modern-day playing cards. There are 78 cards in all, divided into 22 major arcana, or trump-cards, and 56 minor arcana cards, with four suits of 14: cups, coins, swords and wands (or sceptres). As in a modern pack, there are 10 numbered cards in each suit but there are four face cards: youth, horseman, queen and king (in some packs the knave and horse Sor natur resent that er man, th that the random forces.

"A Fast finger on the bomb-bay doors is needed to blast your way through the city to a safe landing. City Bomb runs in 2K on a Sinclair ZX80 or ZX81. By Stephen Adams CITYT "


"BOMB This is the game for those people who think only of themselves. Flying above a city full of people you find yourself running out of fuel and not a landing strip in sight. Hmmmm! No parachutes either! There's only one thing for it you'll have to blow away the entire city to make a landing strip for yourself. If you attempt to land before the city has been cleared then you will crash. The program produces a city from lines 11 down to 19 across on the screen. Should you wish to make it harder for yourself alter the first \"11\" in line number 60 to a greater number and the second to a smaller number. The program was written for an 8K ROM ZX80. To convert to a ZX81, remove lines 170 and 520 to improve the picture.

"PET HI-RES! If you're a PET owner then there must have been a few occasions when you wished that it had the graphics capabilities of the APPLE. Of course there has been a high-resolution board around for some time — but only now can you buy one for under . The HR-40 HIGH RESOLUTION GRAPHICS BOARD offers maximum possible resolution (320 by 200), but costs just  plus VAT, half the price of the competition! Because the HR-40 board was designed and manufactured in Britain we've been able to keep the price down without restricting its capabilities. And if you're really hard-up and a dab hand at soldering you might prefer to wait for the kit version (due later this year) which will cost  plus VAT without software The assembled board is supplied with 8k of RAM and utility software in EPROM, SO that PET's own RAM is entirely available to the user. Though the graphics RAM uses addresses normally represented by the ROM sockets UD3 and UD4, these sockets are duplicated on the HR-40 board and are software selectable. The board may be installed WITHOUT SOLDERING OR TRACK-CUTTING! At present the board will fit a standard PET or CBM computer with the nine inch screen, but we hope to have a version for twelve inch models very soon. Write or telephone for more details and up-to-date information. SUPER GLOOPER First in our new range of ARCADE style games for the PET, SUPER GLOOPER will have you on the edge of your seat. Your task is to clear the screen of little dots scattered in a maze, but WATCH OUT FOR THE GLOOPER EATERS, they're liable to escape from their pen and come after you. You've got to be very nimble with the eaters on your trail. Best bet is to make for one of the four corners where (unless you've been there before) you will find a much larger dot which refreshes the parts that other dots cannot reach! Now you've got the glooper eaters on the run — catch one and you'll earn a bonus, but you must be quick, because any moment they'll recover from their shock and come after YOU! METEORITES An all-action game in the style of INVADERS. Your mission — to defend seven moon bases against a shower of meteorites by blasting them out of the sky. If you survive the first wave there are five more to face, and then well you'll find out! The graphics are really superb — just watch the way that the ground shakes when a meteorite crashes into the lunar surface. SUPERSOFT arcade games are written in machine code for speed and run on all 40 column PETs with BASIC 2, 3 or 4. At just  plus VAT, they're really good value and you won't find a more exhilarating game at any price! We've more great games on the way — including some for the 8032 and VIC-20!

The computer can switch lanes as well and it will be trying to guess which one you will be in as the two of you cross over each circuit. Your safest tactic is to wait until the computer has already committed itself before switching to that crucial lane but don't leave it too late! COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 61 "


"A traditional favourite given a nice touch with good graphics and music. Can you save the victim from the noose? Musical Hangman runs on a Sharp MZ-NOK. By Stephen Davidson That old perennial word guessing game Hangman is given a new lease of life on the Sharp MZ-80K by 13-yearold Stephen Davidson of Aberdeen Using graphics and the Sharp's musical capabilities, Stephen has produced a simple program that will help while away the evening hours and will challenge and amuse your friends.

"never played Hangman, it is a test of your vocabulary and knowledge of word structure. You are presented with a series of empty spaces, which represent a word the computer has committed to memory. The computer then invites you to guess one letter which might be included in the word. If the letter is there somewhere then it appears in the correct place on the screen. If it does not feature in this word then the first struts of a gallows are drawn on the screen and the poor devil who is about to be hung appeals for aid. Another letter and you should have some clues about the word's construction. For example: a \"G\" as the penultimate letter suggests the \"H\" would be a good guess for that final place. If you guess the word before the victim is hung you notch up a victory. If not then you have his death on your conscience. Stephen's victim makes very passionate appeals for your aid. One helpful hint is that \"E\" followed by \"T\" are the most common letters in the English alphabet. 460 PRINT\" !!99392999\"; : FORX=1T08: PRINTTAB(18); \":NEXT: RETURN 470 POKE53554+K, ASC(A$)-64: AT=1: SUB=SUB+1: IFSUBELEN(R$) THENSU=11 480 MC$(20-SUB)=A$: RETURN 499 H$=\" 33333 423333 093333 V 322343 1 BSSE 533 Hs=H+\".33333333333333333 3 E3 \":LI=\" BEEZZZZZZZZ\" 510 TAB$=\"SEEEEEEEEE 520 SN$=\"2E333333 22-/3233243 2 1933333333333 530 SN$=SN$+\" II C II NN\" 540 HI$=\"H999999999999EEEEEEEE 193 192 / 1 OH NO!\" 550 HJ$=\"H29999999999EEEEEEEEE 93 93 9 3 32 33 560 HK$=\"H2299999999999999EEEEEEEEE/ 103 193 BEEEE 13 33 33 \" 570 HL $=\"HUC2999999999999EEEEEEEEEE 333 33 33 E 33 32 333 \": RETURN 580 PRINT\"CH\"; 590 PRINT 3 600 PRINTS 610 PRINT 620 PRINT\" =Hongman= 630 PRINTE 640 PRINTEF Help!

"GAME OF THE YEAR A MAGAZINE cassette of the game so that we, or one of our review team, can try it out and give us a rundown on just how good it is. Each month we will be picking out a couple of programs and giving a run down on how they were put together. What the variables are doing and how the programmer has overcome certain problems with an idea that other readers could adopt to their machines. So if you could also enclose with your listing, a brief rundown of how to play the game: whether it can be played by one, two or more people. A brief synopsis of what the PROGRAM YOUR WAY TO PARIS Only with your help can we continue to make Computer & Video Games a worthwhile purchase. Our continued existence as a magazine depends on you, the readers, deluging us with games program listings which you have invented for your own microcomputer. We are willing to pay  for each games listing we publish and for those listings we are particularly keen on there is a further financial incentive. We will professionally market the best games that appear in our magazine through high street chain stores and if your game proves a winner it could mean a flood of royalties coming your way. Those are just the start of the temptations we are offering you to become a Computer & Video Games contributor. Please check your programs carefully before you send them into us. I know the temptation is to look at our creations through gold-tinted spectacles, but, just before you run it off on the printer, check to see that if the biggest moron going tried to play the game (I may well do so when it gets to the office) he could do so without crashing it. Another please now: Please do not send us programs that you have copied from professional tapes or spotted in other publica tions, these may be spotted by our eagle eyes or they may slip through and cause untold problems. We will look more favourably on games which show an original touch and have a new approach to solving the inevitable problems which crop up in mid-game conception. I'm sure you know the sort of thing: that bomb which, when fired, wipes out all that carefully puttogether background along with the target; the space invader deserter who decides to disappear off the screen and roam around in limbo rather than returning to the fray. If possible could you include a You could be in a position to treat a friend to a weekend in Paris complete with spending money next year. That is the prize for the best games program listing sent in to us in the first 12 months of this magazine's life. Paris may not be the games capital of the world but it does have its attractions and, when you are spending our money, I'm sure it will be all too easy to turn what could have been \"just another weekend\", into the weekend of a lifetime. Come next October a panel of judges will sit down to play all the best games that have been sent into us. They will take into account the originality of the game, the use of the facilities that particular computer had to offer, playability, programming prowess and presentation. After some soul searching and, doubtless, few arguments, the winner will be announced in our November 1982 issue. So if you send in a games listing try and keep a friend in mind. The competition is operito everyone barring myself and the judges whose word will be final. There is also the prestige of having your name and it suitably photogenic, your picture spread all over the magazine as a top game writer. Who knows where that could leady game is about will also be of benefit. And finally we would like to have a list of what the variables or certain subroutines are doing; which part of the program makes the trees grow; or how you shot all the deserting space invaders and made them fall on the poor defender instead. Computer & Video Games is an opportunity for the nameless thousands who have been alone with a microcomputer for too long. So whether you have writ ten a massive adventure in 48K for your Apple, or a 1K bat and ball program for the Singlais ZX81, we are waiting to hear from you. I'm sure there must be plenty of easier ways to earn g tenner but are there any as rewarding? ,117 il COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 65 "


"together by the computer to make an infinite number of words. WIRED FOR SOUND HAS anyone played Space Invaders with the sound turned off? The game immediately loses an enormous amount of its appeal. Even the familiar \"Plonk\", \"Plonk\", of the ball bouncing backwards and forwards goes a long way to stop a game of video tennis becoming a total bore immediately it is turned on. The reason for this is not hard to explain, a fourth exciting dimension, sound, has been added to these games which we find both stimulating and satisfying. Equally exciting is listening to a favourite piece of music being played in four-part harmony by your own computer, especially if you entered it yourself straight from a manuscript. This page will deal exclusively with this fourth dimension. I intend to describe practical circuits which will enable you to add simple sound to your own programs, make good use of any inbuilt sound facilities, con trol external sound sources and also take advantage of the excellent commercial music programs which are becoming available. I will also mention any good books or articles on the subject which I come across. Of necessity, several of these packages will be dedicated to one make of computer but I will try and keep as wide a spectrum as possible. BY DAVID ANNAL Several micros are now being made which have sound generating circuits built in. Some of these are quite sophisticated and can generate complicated sounds and music. Others are intended only as warning bleeps to signify \"end of line\" or \"error\". If no direct facilities are provided, it is still possible to generate even quite complicated noises and output them to a small amplifier via one of the ports. Indeed, even a direct connection may be unnecessary, sound from the computer being picked up by a small radio placed nearby! Computers work at high frequencies and some of this energy is radiated. How a computer can actually make sounds itself is something which I will discuss in future articles. Here I will just say that signals can be produced which come out of one wire \"endways\", in a serial form. Alternatively, signals can come out \"sideways\", or in parallel form, using eight wires all at once. These eight wires correspond to the eight bits of the computer data output port. If this form of output is used, some kind of external circuit will be required to change the eight digital signals into a varying voltage which can be fed to the amplifier a digital/analogue (D/A) converter but this is a subject for the future. Anyone near the International Pet User Group stand when the Pet pantologist Jim Butterfield was there, would have heard a new program which he brought over from Canada (not yet available commercially). Full fourpart music was demonstrated together with attack, sustain and decay, all computer controlled. In addition the word \"Commodore\" could be \"sung\" to a scale played on the keyboard. I wonder when we'll hear the first opera written and performed by computer.... any suggestions for a title? THE SPOKEN WORDS A computer can control all kinds of external sound generators. It can cause a siren to sound or a starting-gun to fire. It can easily be made to modify sounds already being generated by some other electronic device, e.g. change its volume, add vibrato or change pitch. Some electronic organs and synthesisers, now being marketed have facilities built in which allow them to be directly interfaced to a computer. There is also a new generation of dedicated sound making chips such as the AY-3-8910 which have been expressly designed to 66 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES be controlled by computer. These chips contain several generating circuits which produce both musical tones and noise. In-built registers on the chip are filled with control instructions by the computer which can then forget about sound and perform some other task, leaving the sound chip to get on with making noise. Sounds from three-part music to terrifying explosions can be produced. Exciting new forms of this type of circuit are now appearing on the scene, they are the speech synthesisers. Individual words or phrases can be stored permanently in memory chips (R.O.M.s) mounted on an external speech board. The words are \"spoken\" under control of the computer and whole sentences can be constructed. Another, more versatile, method is to have only phonetic parts of speech avail able which can then be strung "

"BY ALEX GATES What it boils down to is that the game can only successfully be played by trial and error, frustrating though it may be. A noteworthy tip in case you foolishly set foot in the labyrinths of underground mazes is to leave behind some of the least valuable clobber you are carrying. By leaving a marker behind you'll save a lot of time aimlessly walking through corridors and tunnels which look exactly alike. If you leave a pointer, say some food (which always attracts the malicious dwarfs), or PLAYING Adventure on a mainframe computer is a tough nut to crack, taking months and months to solve. But that doesn't stop people sneaking into the computer room after dark to tackle it. Most large makes of computers can run a variety of games but Adventure is the most popular and best suited. It is much more of a test than a micro based game because of the massive storage capacity mainframes have, extending the vocabulary into the thousands. Many more details of scenery are available than on a micro and there are far more places to get lost in more treasure to find, more dangerspots and hazards to overcome. The principle of the game is the same as any adventure game. You have to find a certain number of treasure pieces which are dotted about an area littered with dangerous objects and evil beings. Not only do you have to find the treasure but there is also a points system clocking up your score. You get 10 points for finding a piece of treasure, 10 points for getting it safely back to the store room, one point for each room you manage to enter but you lose 10 points if a piece of treasure is stolen by pirates, dwarfs or trolls, who are all out to trick or trap you. Usually the top score is about the 350 mark: obviously you must try not to give away any points while you're on the treasure trail. When you get down to a serious game of Adventure, it is best to keep a record of where you have been in map form. The sooner you find out the boundaries of the area in which the treasure is hidden, the sooner you can positively start looking for it by gathering information and clues. Be brave and try going in every direction possible and in to every building (whether it's a safe looking barn, an evil smelling dungeon or a mysterious mist shrouded tower). obtain some treasure but you are lacking a vital item. An obvious example is the bird chirping happily in the sky. You know you need it for something but forgot to pick up the cage to catch the flighty creature in at the previous step. Before, during and after you experience a close encounter of the kind you would rather not have, with trolls, dwarfs, wizards and elves, you are bound to have the opportunity of picking up a variety of objects. Some of these are worth having, the lamp. money and weapons are good bets for a kick off, but some are just put there to lead you astray. It's up to you to decide which you are going to need. And unfortunately it's only your good judgement and luck which will reveal the three or four magic words which are vital for finding the treasure. Often you just stumble against them, and sometimes you're given a clue in the form of a riddle which you have to puzzle out. = There are going to be times when you will want to beat up the computer yet the only way to vent your anger and frustration is to swear at the machine. It only makes you feel even worse. It will either answer you back with whatever expletive you used, or it will chastise you with: \"tut, tut. Mind your language, please\". At the end of the game, either when you have found all the booty or been killed or committed suicide (yes, even that's possible if you can't take the strain), the print out will give you an assessment of how well you fared, along with your points score. It's just as well there are no hard and fast rules to stick to. If there were it would be far too easy and the fun would be taken out of it. And once you have been whisked away by a crowd of laughing elves into the sunset having found all the treasure there is little left to hold your attention. TERRY ROGERS your water bottle or a couple of coins providing your lamp isn't going dim in which case you will need them to put in the vending machine for new batteries), you can quickly establish a map of the maze and get yourself out safely. Console yourself with the knowledge that the computer is not always as tight-lipped as you may at first think. For instance it gives away some clues, subtle as they are, but your knowledge of classic fairy tales comes in handy. To find any piece of treasure you have to follow each step in the correct sequence. You'll be hitting your head against a wall if you get to a stage when you know you should be able to use the tantalizingly near object to COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 73 "


"By TED BALL PRACTICAL PRACTICAL PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING BY TED BALL the TV but on some machines the programmer must insert his own routine to ensure a true random start for the RND function. A games program will usually begin by printing instructions and waiting for a response from the player before starting the game. This is a convenient point to insert the randomising, and a simple way to do it is: While it is not difficult to learn enough Basic in a short time to ba able to write short, simple programs, the language was not intended to be used for large, complicated programs. In fact, it was designed before modern structured programming techniques had been formulated. As most of us are stuck with Basic on our home computers we have little choice but to write our large programs in this language. My aim in this series is to present algorithms and programming methods which make it easier to write programs which work properly. Where routines are given in Basic they will be written with a minimal subset which should be easy to understand but is not intended to follow the syntax 100 PRINT \"PRESS ANY KEY WHEN READY\" 110 GET AS 120 LET X = RND 130 IF AS = \"\" THEN 110 required for any specific machine. All questions, seemingly unsolvable programming problems, and suggestions for topics to be covered will be welcomed. This series is intended to help you program efficiently and the content of future articles will be governed largely by the comments and ideas received. When the program continues the next value used from the random number sequence will depend on how long the player waited before pressing a key. That, however, is not very satisfactory for two reasons; first Basic is rather slow and normal variations in the speed of pressing a key may produce only three or four starting points; and second someone sitting with his finger on a key while the instructions are being printed will defeat the object of the routine. The second objection can be overcome in Basic, by adding an extra test at the beginning of the routine, but to ensure a wide range of starting values for RND quence appears every time the machine is switched on it is often necessary genuinely to randomise the starting value. Some Basics make a provision for this -for example, RAND on the ZX-81 and RNDE-TI) on the PET which initialise the random number seed from the number of frames displayed on A WILD CARD Figure 1 enter procedure 1 WHILE condition condition procedure 2 SEQUENCE THEN procedure ELSE procedure Most games programs use random numbers, so it is important to know something about how random number functions work, what their limitations are, and how to use them efficiently. The RND function in Basic gives pseudo-random numbers, calculated by a procedure which is designed to produce a sequence with no easily-detectable relationship between successive numbers, and with the numbers spread evenly over their range. The method used on the ZX-81 and described in the manual is typical of the pseudo-random number generators used in microcomputers. The ZX-81 keeps a number between 1 and 65535 as a seed for the random number and a random number is produced by first calculating a new value for the seed as 75* (seed + 1)-1 (taking the remainder after division by 65537 if the result exceeds 65536) and then returning the new seed divided by 65536 to give a number between 0 and 1. Those pseudo-random numbers are good enough for most purposes but as the same se74 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES enter DO procedure procedure IF THEN ELSE DO WHILE enter test value UNTIL condition procedure 11 procedure 2 procedure DO... UNTIL exit CASE OF proc 1. procn "


"made after the DO procedure instead of before. a machine code subroutine is advisable. Another problem arises with random numbers when you need all the numbers to be different. Shuffling a deck of cards can be regarded as a problem of this kind, requiring a routine to generate a list containing the numbers 1 to 52 in random order. When only a few numbers are needed it is simple enough to test each number as it is generated and discard those which have already been used. With a longer list required this procedure can take a long time and, even worse, with a bad random number generator it may not terminate. A simple way to perform a shuffle is first to fill an array with the numbers in order and then work through the array exchanging each element with a randomly-chosen element. A simple routine to do this is: 10 DIM A(52) 100 FOR I = 1 TO 52 110 LET A(I) = 1 120 NEXT I 130 FOR I = I to 52 140 LET R = 1 + 52*INT(RND) 150 LET X = A(I) 160 LET A(I) = A(R) 170 LET A(R) = X 180 NEXT I flow goes straight on from top to bottom and never jumps about the way Basic programs do when GOTO is used indiscriminately. There are many reasons why structured programming is impossible in Basic but programming in Basic can be made easier by using structured methods as much as possible. Although most of the fundamental control structures are not available in Basic it is possible to obtain the same effect using the language. SEQUENCE is no problem, as it is just a matter of one block of statements following another, and CASE corresponds to the Basic statement ON variable GOSUB line no, line no ... DO... WHILE ... and DO... UNTIL can be implemented in Basic with IF ... Then ... and GOTO. The example shows DO ... WHILE ...; DO... UNTIL ... is similar, but the test should be 99 REM WHILE 100 IF condition THEN 120 110 GOTO 200 119 REM DO ROUTINE STARTS HERE 120... 189 REM DO ROUTINE ENDS HERE 190 GOTO 100 199 REM START OF NEXT BLOCK 200... A few microcomputer Basics including TRS-80 Level IIallow IF ... THEN ... ELSE ..., but where it is not available it can be implemented by using ON variable GOSUB line no, line no. The variable must first be set to a value of 1 or 2 depending on the result of the IF test. The straightforward way to do this is: 100 IF condition THEN 130 109 REM ELSE 110 LET X = 2 120 GOTO 140 129 REM THEN 130 LET X = 1 140 ON X GOSUB line no, line no STAY IN CONTROL Another method is to use the feature of some Basics which allows the truth value of a conditional expression to be assigned to a variable, for example: 100 LET X = (A<B) or 100 LET X = (A=B) The numerical values used to represent \"true\" and \"false\" vary from machine to machine, the most common being 1 and 0 or O and 1. If true is represented by -1 and false by 0 we can get IF ... THEN ... ELSE by: Structured programming is a method of program design which, used properly, produces programs which are reliable, easy to maintain, and easy to read. A fundamental principle of structured programming is that a program should be constructed from modules with a single entry point and a single exit point. Any program can be written by refining the modules successively to include more and more detail using only three control structures: SEQUENCE, IF ... THEN ... ELSE ..., and DO ... WHILE ... Two additional control structures, DO... UNTIL and CASE, are useful in practice but are not theoretically necessary. Flowcharts for these control structures are not available in Figure one. An important property of structured programs is that program 100 LET X = condition 110 ON X+2 GOSUB line no, line no Before you use this method you should, of course, check that your Basic allows assignment of truth values and find out what values are used. 5 % for "

"BY KEITH CAMBELL ture consisting of about 30 locations and a similar number of objects can be loaded into 16K of RAM. ADVENTURE is arguably the most popular game so far adopted by the computing fraternity. It tempts the data processing professional to give up his lunch hour to search for hidden treasure in the mainframe and is also finding its way onto many a home and even business microcomputer. It is a game which generates fervent enthusiasts. I was staying overnight at Brighton on a business trip and, to pass the evening, walked along the seafront, finding myself eventually in a little back street pub. Armed with a pint, I found the only spare seat next to a young man and started a conversation, during which it emerged that I wrote for a computer magazine. \"I know nothing about computers\", said my companion, a microbiologist, \"but I suppose you have one of those Pet things\". Whereupon, a fellow sitting on a nearby bar stool interrupted. \"Are you in computing? I am half of a software firm writing commercial software for Pets.\" \"I'm a Tandy man myself,\" I told him, feeling that was almost like a declaration of war. A lengthy discussion followed on the relative difficulties of programming the Z 80 against the 6502. Neil, our biologist, yawned and sipped his tequila. Until the conversation turned inevitably to Adventure. \"Isn't that a computer version of Dungeons and Dragons?\" he asked, suddenly awake again. From that moment, the only lull in the conversation before closing time was when a round was bought. Three enthusiasts could not be stopped. Adventure did originate from Dungeons and Dragons. It has appeared on many mainframe computers around the world. The original was written in Fortran and required 64K storage plus disc back-up. In this age of the micro, a fairly complex AdvenScott Adams scarcely exaggerates when he proclaims in the instructions appended to the Adventure series, that the player is able to experience an adventure without leaving his chair. For the Adventure formula is a game suited ideally to computers. A good Adventure can be totally absorbing and the danger of making a false move can become very real, as can the excitement of discovering a new exit or chamber. So, for the uninitiated, what is Adventure? The game consists usually of a logical network of locations which must be explored or traversed. The locations can contain objects, creatures/monsters, and/or treasures, which may be carried and manipulated in sometimes obscure ways to achieve the objective of the game. That objective may be to collect treasures, to carry out some specific act like prevent a time-bomb from detonating or to escape the network unharmed. That is achieved by entering instructions in plain language, usually a verb followed by a noun — e.g., go north, take keys, kill dragon. In some games, movement is achieved by means of arrow keys. An Adventure is always words but sometimes may be augmented to a greater or lesser extent with graphics. The player unless he cheats by listing the program has no way of knowing how many locations or objects exist but can plot a logical geo-schematic map of the network to aid him in his travels. Most Adventures are written in source code, rendering them more difficult to analyse by listing, or disassembling, than to solve. Machine-code games, as well as having the advantage of space economy, have an apparently instantaneous response adding to the dramatic effect of surprise. If your machine-code Adventure is baffling you and you want to cheat, try breaking, re-setting or quitting the game — without turning off -and then enter this from command mode: FOR I = (start address of user RAM) TO (end address of user RAM): PRINT CHR$ PEEK (I):: NEXT That will not give you an instant solution, but all the displayable characters will scroll up the screen, giving you a few good clues! The most difficult part of writing an Adventure is to establish the theme and the plot. It is really like writing fiction, as it is necessary to have some theme which will hang everything together, while absorbing the player. When you have hit on a theme, ask yourself if it has been done before. Once you have established your theme and plot, roughly draw the map of the network and place your objects. Think through your plot in some detail, making sure you have an in-built impossibility e.g. you cannot get the axe until after you have chopped down the tree. Then think around some of the programming difficulties. I will start giving you tips on them next month. Doe COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"TOYSELECTRONIC TOYS ELECTRONIC TOYSELECTRONIC TOYS ELECTRONIC TO ARMAS THE LOGIC OF COMPUTERISED MASTERMIND DIG FOR VICTORY LIGHTS, ACTION CUE SIMON'S BIG BROTHER The musical memory game Simon, has a big brother out this Christmas. Super Simon is a deluxe version of the Simon game which made such a big impact in the shops last year. This one has five different games to play and up to eight people can join in. Super Simon is square shaped, unlike its predecessor and has selectors for the game variations, the number of players and the skill level. Press the large coloured keys to follow the sequence Super Simon's memory throws out and see how long it is before you get the sequence wrong. Or a more difficult game is to try and follow Super Simon at the same time as its colours light up and it blares out its musical tones. For more than one person Super Simon can cleverly pick a person to follow his sequence by selecting one of the four colours, red, yellow, green or blue, assigned to each person. One of its special features, which the original does not have, is an arbitration key. If controversy develops about the result of a game, at the touch of a button, Super Simon will indicate the winner by flashing the right coloured key. . Super Simon is built to last in robust plastic panels to withstand heavy hands. You should easily be able to find the game in most toy shops and department stores. It costs anything between -. Apart from the original of this game there is also a baby brother: hand-held Pocket Simon which sells for -. Simon itself now costs - and is still the most popular of the trio. Toy manufacturers are still cashing in on the space invaders band wagon. The hand-held Earth Invaders toy is no exception. It first came out at the beginning of this year as a follow-up to Computer Games' successful hand-held version of space invad. ers, called Galaxy Invaders. Flying saucer shaped and made in blue and white plastic with a large display screen, the game has a microchip inside to program in different difficulty levels. The aim in Earth Invaders is to defend your general from invading aliens which move around a grid of squares. There are six squares which are safe ground. If you are caught in a square when an alien moves in, you are dead. Your only defence is complicated and relies on quick thinking and concentration as well as dexterity. You have to dig holes in the squares around you and wait for an alien to land in one. When he does the red aliens can only be killed by pressing both the 'bury' button and the correct directional button. But you must do it as soon as the alien lands in the hole or he will escape and destroy you. You get points for each alien you successfully destroy and bonus points for each phase of the game you complete. Earth Invaders costs .95 and is battery operated. The popular logical-deduction peg game of Mastermind was always an ideal candidate for computerisation Mastermind suffered from needing two people to play but being deadly dull for the one that set the problem, who could only tap his fingers while his partner thought through the numerous permutations needed to come up with the right answer. Invicta's Supersonic Electronic Mastermind turns it into an absorbing one-player game with the computer taking over the part of the problem setter and no distracting table-tapping either! The game comes in a handheld format and resembles a calculator with a liquid crystal display and a small keyboard on which to enter your guesses. It is compact enough to make a good travelling companion and comes complete with a plastic cover to hold your scorecards and a biro. Skill levels mean you can set problems to fit your brain's powers of deduction at any given time. From just three numbers for those early morning sessions to a full six when you feel ready for a bigger challenge. On the right-hand side of the L.C.D. are two columns which tell you, firstly, how many of your guesses were correct and how many were correct and in the right place. When you feel you have hit upon a sequence which will further your knowledge of the hidden number, hit the \"try\" key and the machine checks your effort against the code and returns its two clues. You make a note on your scorepad, try a bit of deducing and then have another go. The machine keeps a check of how many tries and how long it took you to work out the answer. Supersonic Mastermind is battery powered by two HP7s (not supplied) but also runs off the mains and costs .95. 78 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

" FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BENEFITS AND PITFALLS IF YOU are thinking of acquiring a home computer, the easiest decision you will have to make is whether or not to buy it in kit form. Kits, as an idea, are a great advantage to hobbyists as they offer a greater range in what is usually a small budget. The reasons for choosing one computer over the others are dealt with in another section. Here, I will be dealing with the problems of kit building including special tips on certain machines as they crop up. Some kits have pitfalls for the unwary. and I will hopefully cover them before anyone gets caught! There will also be notes on faultfinding and repair for those who have already been caught. Undoubtedly you will benefit from building your own kit. Not only will you be better prepared for larger projects, but also you will learn a good deal about the system and how it works. You must, however, be prepared to spend a lot of time in constructing the kit, and perhaps even longer in getting it to work. Someone who has done little or no construction work before can expect to spend 4-5 hours on even the simplest of kits. Remember that the components, not the kits, are guaranteed by the makers, so you will have to pay them to put it right if it is your fault. However, if you stick to the instructions, take care over soldering and select the correct components, you should have no trouble. Once you have decided on a kit, the next step is to get the necessary tools if you do not already have them. They really fall into two categories essentials and extras. The essentials are soldering iron, solder and cutters. The extras, which you will need if you are to get a professional and reliable finish, are pliers, a form of desolderer, either a small solder sucker or solder wick and a steady pair of hands. The soldering iron should be mains-operated, unless you can afford a temperature controlled one, with a small bit for light work. It should be rated at around 20 watts, and definitely no more than 30 watts, as this will tend to destroy components through overheating. The solder should be of a fine multicore flux type of 22 gauge preferably. This type does away with pots of flux. The cutters are needed to trim the ends of the soldered-in components. They should be side cutting and quite light to get a smooth finish on the underside of the board. The pliers will be needed to bend components to fit into the board. This can be done with small fingers, but is often unreliable and causes stress in the components. The desolderer is useful when too much solder has been put on a joint. The solder sucker does what its name suggests, and the wick is a woven copper strip which, when heated and pressed on to the joint by the iron, draws the solder off. Very useful for beginners. If you are going to be any good at construction, you will need a steady pair of hands. Funnily enough, women and children make the best solderers! Do not give up, though, if you are in neither category! With all the good kits you will find comprehensive instructions for assembly. If you don't, ask. Most of them tell you to read them first. Do so! Even if you are an expert at construction, the order in which you assemble the components may be important. So long as you read and follow the instructions, you should have no trouble with identification and assembly. If you are not used to soldering, this will be the point at which you will fall down. Most kits advise you to build up the components on the board in layers, so that when all of one lot say, resistors are in, you can turn it over and place it flat on your working top. This allows you two free hands to solder with and ensures that all components are flat on the board. Transistors, however, should be raised as much as a quarterof-an-inch off the board and soldered with care as they are easily destroyed through overheating. This also goes for the other components, although these are not so critical. There is no hard and fast rule about soldering. If in trouble, seek advice. Do not continue if you feel unsure. It will cost you dearly in time and money if you make too many mistakes. Have fun while you are building your kit, as it may not last. Once you have finished it, everyone else will want to have a go.

"BY GARY MARSHALL drawing position to a specified position. In terms of drawing on paper with a pen, these commands are equivalent to moving the pen above the paper, leaving no trace, to position it. And moving it while in contact with the paper so that it draws a line as it moves. The MOVE and DRAW commands allow the programmer to work in terms of screen positions, which is more natural than manipulating memory locations. COLUMN 1 2 C 39 40 the top row is 32768 + C-1 while, generally, the address of the location corresponding to the screen position in row Rand column C is 32768 + 40*(R 1) + C-1 The Basic instruction which enables displays to be produced using memory-mapping is the \"Poke\" instruction. On a Pet, the instruction POKE 32768, 42 causes the number 42 to be stored in location 32768, so that automatically the character whose code is 42 (an asterisk) appears at the top left corner of the screen. In this way the tools required to produce a display on a memory-mapped screen are the memory-mapping formula given above and a table of the codes for the available graphic symbols. The screen size and the area of memory mapped to the screen vary for different machines but with a knowledge of the appropriate values for a particular machine, the formula given for the Pet can be amended A space invader can be plotted near the centre of the Pet's screen using the following instructions: P-33268 POKE P-1, 255: POKE P, 247: POKEp+1, 127 POKE P +39, 255: POKE P+40, 249: POKE P+41, 127 ROW + + 39 40 41 42 THE interest and compulsion of most computer and video games lies in the appeal of their graphics. There are basically three ways to present the state or results of a games program: with numbers, with words or graphically. While numerical computation is undoubtedly necessary during the course of any reasonably complex game, to present the results numerically is bound to become rather dull sooner or later. To present them in words is better, but books are better for reading from than video screens. A picture is worth a thousand words, and graphics are much more informative and natural than the other alternatives. Most microcomputers, including the Commodore Pet, Sharp MZ-BOK, Tandy TRS 80 and Sinclair ZX80 and ZX81 have a set of graphics keys on their keyboards. With these keys a pictorial display can be typed out in the same way as a paragraph of text. To make it easy to produce a graphic display from a program, these microcomputers also have what is called a memory-mapped screen. The idea of a memory-mapped screen is that each character position on the screen (that is, each position in which a letter, number or graphic character can be placed) is mapped to a location in a specially reserved part of the memory. By placing a number in a location in this area of memory, the appropriate character automatically appears in the corresponding screen position. So producing a graphic display is reduced to a memory management exercise. Some machines, including the Apple and Acorn Atom, provide explicit drawing commands. The fundamental ones are \"MOVE\" and \"DRAW\". The former permits a drawing position to be established, while the latter causes a line to be drawn from the current 79 80 921 922 959 960 961 962 9991000 The way in which screen positions are mapped to memory locations for the Pet is illustrated in Figure 1. The Pet screen has 25 rows, each with 40 column positions, so that a character may be placed in any of 1,000 positions on the screen. These screen positions are mapped on to the memory locations starting from the one with address 32768. As shown in the figure, they are mapped by rows. To place a character on the screen in a position whose row and column are given, we need to work out the address of the corresponding memory location. A little thought should confirm that if the position at the top left of the screen in row l and column 1) corresponds to location 32768, then the address of the location corresponding to the screen position in column C of Figure 2 is a line drawing of an invader. Whatever you think of the likeness, it demonstrates that a drawing of one can be made by joining a set of points by straight lines. By varying the positions of the points, or adding more points, it is possible to obtain a more convincing, or even a more aesthetically pleasing, version. "


"BASIC MORE BASIC  TUTORIAL By MOIRA NORRIE APPLET you have reached this stage you will be able to type in a Basic program WHAT IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM? A VERY SIMPLE PROGRAM You do not need to be able to program to make good use of a home computer but if you can feed instructions to your machine it will be that much more rewarding. In this series we are going to teach you how to program in Basic, the simplest and most widely used computer language available. There is a myth built up around computers that only a mathematical genius can understand them. But even 10-12 year olds with no particular skill with figures are among the keenest home programmers these days. Anyone can learn Basic, you do not need any previous computing experience or even have your own computer although that would obviously make it more interesting. If you already have a microcomputer and have learnt how to use its version of Basic you have a head start on the beginners but do not turn the page just yet. Each microcomputer has its own Basic quirks and different functions which make it incompatible with others of its kind. This series will help you understand some of the functions printed in a different machine's program listing. In short it will help you get the most out of this magazine. At the end of this series, you will not only be able to write your own computer programs, but also understand other people's programs. We will encourage you to convert these other programs to run on your machine. How to write games programs will be introduced early on but remember that you can write programs for anything: from keeping a check on your bank balance to storing names and addresses for your Christmas card list. To get a computer to do something for us, we must give it a list of instructions. This list of instructions is called a 'computer program'. In order that the computer may understand our instructions, we must write them in a language that the computer will understand. Unfortunately, English is too complex a language for it to understand, therefore we use a specially devised computer language. The computer language we will use is called Basic --this stands for Beginner's Allpurpose Symbolic Instruction Code. There are slight variations in the versions of Basic available on different computers. I will describe the standard version and, when necessary, point out the differences for a number of computers. We will start with a very simple program which consists of only two instructions -one per line. 10 PRINT 2+3 20 END Each line of a Basic program begins with a line number the \"10\" and \"20\" above. These line numbers determine the order in which the instructions will be obeyed. The computer starts with the instruction with the smallest line number and finishes with the instruction with the largest line number. You may type in your instructions in any order; the computer will automatically sort them according to the line numbers. It is not necessary that the line numbers go in steps of 10 as I have done above. However, it is fairly common programming practise as it allows for later instructions to be inserted. Try typing the above program into your computer. Remember to press the key marked \"Return\" (or \"Newline\") at the end of each line typed into the computer. If you make a mistake when typing a line, your keyboard will have a key marked \"Delete\" or \"Rubout\" which can be used to erase the last character; typing the key repeatedly will cause it to work back along the line erasing one character each time the key is pressed GETTING STARTED First you will have to switch on your computer. Some computers will automatically be ready for you to converse with them in Basic, but with others you may have to go through some preliminaries such as loading something from a cassette tape that will allow the computer to understand Basic. Often computers will give the response \"READY\" so that you know that you are in Basic. Once 86 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"On the Sinclair computers, you do not have to type in the letters individually as there are keys which, when pressed at the appropriate point, will type the whole of the special \"keywords\" such as \"PRINT\". With some of the microcomputer systems, the \"END\" instruction should be omitted. These include the Sinclair and the Atari. Once you have typed in your Basic program, you can then tell the computer to obey the list of instructions you do this by typing the command \"RUN\" and then \"Return\" again. The above program tells it to calculate 2+3 and then print the answer. You should therefore find that the number \"5\" is printed The computer will then print the response \"READY\" to let you know that it is ready for you to give it another command. If you again type the command \"RUN\". then it will again perform the list of instructions. You could type the command \"LIST\" in which case it will list your program this is useful in checking what your program looks like at any stage. Alternatively, you could now \"edit\" your program. line. Thus, if I wanted to change the previous program so that it multiplied 2 by 3 instead of adding, I would type 10 PRINT 2*3 The old version of line 10 would be replaced with the new version of line 10. To insert a new line, you type the new line and the line number will determine where it is inserted in the program. If I now typed 15 PRINT 2+3 I would have a program which printed the product of 2 and 3 By using these operations we can perform a whole range of arithmetic calculations. E.g. 4.2-3**2/6 3+2*5 In the first of the above examples, there is a \"real\" number — one that contains a decimal point. In some versions of Basic only integer numbers are allowed those that do not contain a decimal point. There will always be a limit on the size of numbers that your computer can cope with In the second example, the computer is faced with a choice \"will it do the addition or multiplication first?\". If it does the addition first, then it will get \"3+2\" which is 5, and then multiply that by \"5\" to get a final answer of 25. However, if it does the multiplication first, it will get \"2*5\" which is 10, and then add \"3\" to get an answer of 13. Clearly, a specified order must EDITING YOUR PROGRAM be laid down for such a situation so that computers will always arrive at the same answer. followed by the sum of 2 and 3. To delete a line of your program, type the line number then press the \"Return\" key. Some computer systems provide you with a cursor that can be moved about the display screen so that you can actually indicate individual characters that you want to change. This would save you re-typing the entire line. NEXT ISSUE Often you will want to change your program in some way then you say that you are \"editing\" your program. It may be that your program does not do what you wanted, in which case there is an error in the program this is often referred to as a \"bug\". You will hear people say that they are \"debugging\" their program, meaning that they are trying to get rid of their program errors. On the other hand, your program may be correct but you want to amend it in some way. In either case, you will have to edit your program. Editing Basic programs is very simple. There are three types of change you might want to make. You might want to change a line, add a new line or delete one of the current lines. To change a line, you simply type in the new version of the SIMPLE CALCULATIONS If you are familiar with a calculator, you will realise that anything we have done so far could be achieved by a simple calculator. Next month, I will cover some of the features of Basic that make use of the fact that a computer is more powerful than a simple calculator. These will include the use of \"variables\" to make your programs more general, and \"loops\" so that you can repeat calculations for different values without hav. ing to re-RUN your program. Note that an \"*\" is used in the above example to indicate multiplication. The remaining arithmetic operations are: subtraction represented by \"_\", division represented by \"/\" and exponentiation represented either by \"**\" or by\" \". Exponentiation means calculating powers of numbers e.g. 3**2 is equivalent to 32. NEXT ISSUE COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 87 "
