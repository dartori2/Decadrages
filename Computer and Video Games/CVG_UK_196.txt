Where possible, we have acknowledged the copyright holder. Contact us if we haven't credited your copyright We will always correct any oversight. People become good at computer games with lots of practice, lots of quarters, and by watching for patterns. All electronic games follow patterns. For example, when a game monster or spaceship moves around the screen in the same way every time, it is following a pattern. Computer games have patterns because the game is really a list of orders flashing through the computer's brain. There is a limited number of orders, so eventually the computer goes back to some old orders, and the game repeats itself. Knowing when a game repeats itself is the secret to winning. If you know when an enemy spaceship or monster is comi ng your way, you lie low. Then you zap it when it comes around the bend. Computer-game experts are those people who know a game inside and out. They have mastered all the patterns, and they use their knowledge to pile up millions of points. (Extract from 'The Star Wars Q&A Book About Computers') em ges "

"computer Video games NEWS O SEGA'S MASTERPLAN FOR 1998 TO DOMINATE THE PC MARKET! SEGA CONFIRM NEW 7 L MACHINE IS COMING! BILL GATES CONFIRMS MICROSOFT INVOLVEMENT ith their new console barely scraping onto this year's release schedule, and the Saturn seemingly lost against the competition, Sega need a big plan for 1998, and they've got one-to make PC software their primary concern! SEGAPC SEGA'S NEW CONSOLE + THEIR 1998 STRATEGY SEGA PC Over the course of this year, Sega are set to concentrate their energies towards producing games specifically for PC. Initially this means ega have finally announced they are working on a new console simultaneous releases on PC and Saturn, before leading set for release in Japan by the end of this year. And Microsoft with the PC releases, and then, by the end of this year, are definitely on-board for the project! releasing PC only games. Sega have always been driven more by software than The new machine still has no name, and the UK/US releases are only hardware development. Both in the arcades and on their provisionally pencilled in for Spring next year. However, during Sega of Japan's consoles, Sega's games have become recognised as annual New Year party, Microsoft supremo, Bill Gates, appeared via satelitte some of the best there are. And in Spring '96 they entered link-up to join Sega Chairman, Isao Ookawa in stating that Sega has joined the PC market by releasing Windows 95 versions of 16-bit hands with Microsoft in the development of our next console system.\" titles like Ecco the Dolphin, Sonic CD and Night Trap. This This would back talk that Microsoft are working on the machine's operating was followed by conversions of some of their early Saturn system, as well as a compatible arcade OS. Together with the machine's Power titles like Panzer Dragoon, Virtua Cop and Virtua Fighter. VR processing system, this also supports Sega's reference to the machine as a The latter proving to be the best fighting game on the PC. \"high-spec PC in a boxÂ». Indeed, if rumours are correct, converting a PC game to Sega now believe they have tapped into two distinct PC the new machine takes only a month, and converting an Arcade Model 3 game markets. With 'family' titles like Sonic, they've got parents takes only three months! -who maybe used to own the Mega Drive buying games Other information about the machine suggests it will be launched with Virtua Fighter 3, and games for their kids. Whereas arcade conversions like Last Bronx using three popular 16-bit Sega characters. Sonic the Hedgehog is a cert, we know Ecco the and Sega Rally appeal to the 17-35 year olds. Sega intend Dolphin is one, and our third guess is Shinobi. The machine will also have four joypad ports and be on exploiting both these areas. network-compatible, for internet gaming. Something Microsoft's OS will certainly play a big part in. Most notably, they want to consolidate their image as the Sega are calling this the most important hardware launch in their history, and with the richest man No.1 arcade-to-PC brand. Even meeting criticisms of arcade in the World on their side, things are suddenly looking very promising indeed. conversions being too short and simple, by expanding them with new features. Thanks to Sega's PC success in 127 CHALLENGER SCORE 200 0151 the US and Europe, the Japanese development teams are TIME 0:24 now more than willing to add extra levels and elements to RINGS 31 PC versions. An example of this is House Of The Dead. Sega hope to release the Saturn and PC versions at the same time. However, the PC version will be enhanced with more levels. Sega Rally is also set for a PC re-release in April, with all-new weather conditions, tuning up features, strategy elements and even a story mode. Later this year, we'll see PC-unique versions of Worldwide Soccer, the Sonic games, and more. By the end of 1998, It's intended to establish Sega PC as a brand in its own right. To this extent Sega are planning a totally original PC title. Being developed by an external team, Sega will have full control over the final prooduct and the marketing of it. At the moment, the game HOUSE OF THE DEAD HOUSE OF THE DEAD is being kept secret. From what we know though, it will make use of multiplayer internet play, and feature a lot of strategy-based and cultural elements. It sounds to us, to be a Command & Conquer style game. How Sega's PC plans tie-in with the upcoming release of the new machine is unclear. But Sega have stated that the PC division is totally detached from the console side, and it's a certainty the new machine will be given priority over all other projects.

Both are cleverly written and illustrated by Masashi Tanaka. So far Namco, who created the game, haven't detailed how Gon's character will play. Judging from Gon's antics in the stories we expect him to head-butt and bite for victory. Also Namco have used their artisitic license to allow Gon to breath fire. Tekken 3 will be released in Japan in March, America in April, and is expected around September in the UK. Meanwhile if you're interest ed in reading Gon, hunt down the book published by Mandarin Paperbacks, ISBN 0 7493 9685 7.

Prove to be the highest scorer by the time the week is up, and you'll walk away with a mega PlayStation package which includes a PlayStation, plus games, plus Capital Radio CafÃ© vouchers, and a subscription to CVG and PlayStation Plus. CVG will be there to ask embarrassing questions and take photos. So if you want to get into the only games magazine that matters, get your lazy ass down to Capital Radio CafÃ© over half-term! London, plus PlayStation, plus great food. Gotta be worth it. Bushido Blade and (top) Cool Boarders 2. Beat them and win CVG subscriptions. It has to be done! [ FROM TEKKEN TO TER CAPITAL RADIO HOLD GAME COMPOS! The next generation of Transformers is coming soon to British television, in a spectacular computer-generated action series. To coincide with this PlayStation and PC will be getting the Beast Wars game. Beast Wars originally aired in Japan in 1996 to great success, which continued onto the US last year. Transformers originally transformed from cool vehicles into giant robots the leader Optimus Prime was an articulated truck! This time around the Transformers are wild animals, including a gorilla and a T-Rex -leader Optimus Primal! Together with good guys, the Maximals, Primal fights to destroy the Predacons. But that's only for the TV series. In the game you get to control both the Maximals and Predacons as they unite to defend the planet against invading aliens called Skriix. Kids' stuff for sure, but we love it! Here's hoping that the game's state-ofthe-art CG too (!). Namco recently unveiled a new attraction at their Namja Town amusement centre, Tokyo. It's called 'Mononoke Bangaichi' a ghost town, in other words. You're given a black (plastic) kitten called Nanchichi to carry with you, and on this all the data from the quiz driven adventure is stored. Brave the dark (no groping!), and face Emperor Kappa for the final test. At the end you get a print out saying how you fared. Succeed and you find Nanchichi. Namja Town is kind of like 'Disney World'. It has no arcade machines, or any other kind of Namco merchandise you might expect (Tekken keyrings for example) and the entire look is based around traditional, old-fashioned Japanese villages. If you like the idea of Namja Town, write and let us know. We'll pass on the letters to Namco for you.

BRAIN MELTING POT SCARY READER NO #198643 LEWOO HIIM NIM NIM NIM 5. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to ask you about Melting Pot. Are all the games printed in Melting Pot going to be available in shops to the public? If so when? Also, I find it hard to believe that you can make these games from the little information that you receive from the person who sent in their idea. I mean, you say to keep our letters under 300 words and send in a picture. Is it you that makes the game and then what happens if thousands buy it? Would I receive the money or you? Some of the games you print sound useless and you also give it a bad mark. Will these be available to us as well? Peter Callan, Sligo, Ireland. world (I still regularly watch the movie) I was delighted that the new Beast Wars toys were featured in a recent issue. I have owned my Megatron toy (surely the coolest ever. I wish was five again!) for two months now having picked one up in Germany under the title \"Ani-Mutants'. And having seen the fantastic animated series in America last summer, must question Hasbro why, oh why, oh WHY are these toys not available in this country? Both the TV series and the toy range are exceedingly popular in America and Japan, so why not here as well? The toys, although complicated, would be best sellers and the TV series has to be the classiest TV programme ever, Far better than this Power Rangers crap. So then, a plea from a disillusioned, slightly sad person. Hasbro give us Beast Wars (or Beast Masters, but not Beasties the Canadian name) NOW! Simon Pulman, Bucks. Dear CVG. I have just finished reading issue #194 of your great magazine and after looking at you lot I saw these strange things... Tony Cormack: A disturbed person that looks an awful lot like Stephen Hendry. Jaime Smith: A messy eater with the same IQ as a glass of water. Alex Huhtala: A happy chap that is obviously a big fan of Elvis Presley you can tell because in issue #193 he has sideburns longer than Robbie Williams when he had his. Steve Key: Steve looks a bit funny in the head and also seems that he has ginger hair. Ed Lomas: A weirdo with a weird sneer. Probably bought up by a frog or something. Tom Guise and Paul Davies: Two fine young men. There is nothing wrong with them. Steven Armstrong, Scotland. CVG: Unsurprisingly, the sender of this letter forgot to include his age. Hmmm, wonder why? CVG: The whole idea behind Melting Pot is that we get you, the readers, to make up the games you would love to play. They are nothing more than ideas. We tried to get the senior members of the team to comment on this, but unfortunately they had just cashed a big fat royalty cheque and were sunning it up in Barbados. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T WANT CVG: Let us clear one thing now. Paul has been possessed by the Spirit of the Mad Gamer and Tom is, well, anything but a fine young man. Please do not be fooled. People cross the street when they see these two coming. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL QUALITY NOT QUANTITY Dear CVG, To that pranny Henry Harker. The reason why the Spice Girls game is appearing on the PlayStation is because that machine is owned by sad saps who get easily taken in by hype, marketing and rushed cash in jobs. Plus, the PlayStation is owned by a vast amount of people who are casual gamers who don't know what games are really about. Which is exactly the type of people the Spice Girls game is aimed at. Strange eh? Daniel Factor, London. Dear CVG, One day I found myself walking into a newsagent and I bought issue #193 of CVG. It's a cool magazine except for the fact that you always have heaps of articles on the PlayStation. I don't like it. No, I don't. I like N64s. Yes. For example you put Bomberman 64 at the back of the mag. And in the buyers guide you had PS first, Saturn second and the mighty N64 third. Surely this is a mistake. Dear CVG, Why can't most games be as good quality as Resident Evil 2 and Goldeneye? After playing RE2 (the demo) I can't believe it's running on the same machine that has games such as Agent Armstrong, Shadowmaster, 2Xtreme, Iron 'n' Blood, Jet Moto and hundreds of other crap games. There are so many titles which are made without any imagination or thought but simply to make money and cash in on the PlayStation's popularity! I also think that some credit should be given to Nintendo for trying something different with the Rumble Pak, Virtual Pet Game, pocket camera and printer, and Diddy Kong Racing, which is far better than Touring Cars, Rage Racer or any other over-rated boring race CVG: You are right to say the PlayStation is owned by a vast amount of 'casual' gamers, but to say that they have no idea about what games are about is untrue. You wait until the Spice Girls game comes out. It won't be groundbreaking in any way, but it'll certainly attract younger people to the PlayStation, thus increasing the user No, hang (cough) on (splutter). I'm d...y...i...n...ggggg! From (a now dead) Richard Brightwell, Sevenoaks. 14 CVG: The buyers guide was in no particular order, it just happened to be written that way. And "


"computer video READERS STRIDES $5 games STAR LEHER YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG SONY Dear CVG, I would like to complain about issue 194. The picture on the front was horrible, disgusting and I was almost sick looking at it. I'm not normally scared of things like that, but bloody hell, I was cacking my crackers. But I hear that the first one was pretty gory, so keep it up lads. I.M. Stilaweener, Leytonstone, London. Dear Sir Madam, I would realy oprasate it if you would send me a book of the 2001 cheats for .50 or if you would kindly give it for nothing, I would be great-full and some information on what you do yours sincerely Keith mcDonald. Please would you Be a friend for my sake. Keith McDonald, Dublin, Ireland. Jo Dear CVG, One thing I've noticed about Sony is the way they support/advertise their PlayStation, and more importantly how this promotional push is all centred around the graphics, advanced technology and third party support. And the thing I can't really understand is why? With games like FFVII. Tomb Raider 2 and Time Crisis rolling out, why are they not making more of an effort to tell us about the main thing that counts. I've played each of these and, yes, I'll admit the graphics are good (excellent in in FFVII and TR2) but I found the gameplay to be absolutely brill. Nintendo and Sega have always put across the fact that their titles always have the best gameplay, especially in Sega's case. But with a minority of the PS games beyond 'mint'. I think Sony better have a rethink of their (yes, already working) marketing scheme. With more emphasis on the playability than graphics and sound though. Oh and the fact that simply because it's a Sony product we should love it. Kyle Walker-Booth, Oldham. CVG: We can't give you 2001 cheats Keith, but we can give you this one: On Altered Beast, if you want to select any monster on any round, hold Down-Left and press A, B, C, Start at the title screen. If you would kindly send the cheque for .50 to the usual address, we would be very grateful. CVG: So, you want Sony to stop their current marketing strategy which has made the PlayStation the best selling 'toy' over Christmas and start again? We wonder if they will take note of this. Dear CVG, Whose feet were on the Time Crisis letter in issue 194, as I think they should get a wash. Mark Baker, Prescot, Merseyside. CVG: Tom's. game. DMA deserve credit also for GTA which is very playable despite its poor graphics. Name and address lost, Sorry! Dear CVG, My friend Anthony Gordon thinks CVG is crap (the little b*****d). I have tried everything to convince him from showing him all the nice piccies to getting him in a headlock, jumping up and down, and saying I won't stop until he says it's brilliant. He bought the July issue and said it was b*****ks. So I bought the August Issue and decided to subscribe. What could I do to convince him it is the best mag ever? Craig Smith, Malvern CVG: This was a very good letter, but when we came to finish typing it up this morning, the cleaners had thrown it away! Whoever sent it in, sorry! But, the points made are good ones. The amount of quality games on Saturn is high, but they have virtually no third party developers. PlayStation probably has the same amount of quality games, but also has stacks of average and crap ones. CVG: If he doesn't like what he sees by now, then don't waste your time. Just kill him instead. ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY OJO human and fight genetic mutations with eyes growing from their shoulders in Tomb Raider? No. And anyway, Tomb Raider got a High Five too. FFVIII: THE COMEDY YEARS Dear CVG, In issue #194, CVG gave you a chance to win awesome gaming gear worth !' I. Mark Ojo entered the competition and sent off for a Nintendo 64, a Sega Saturn and the Erazer Light guns. My Mum and Dad say that the chances of winning are one in a million. Is that true? So could you tell me the chances of winning please. Mark Ojo, South London. Dear CVG I am desperate to get one of my comedy FFVII stories in your magazine. I have put all of them with this letter, so pick one you think is the best. Final Fantasy VII and 3/4 Cloud woke up in his flat in Midgar (I know, even for saving the world you don't get paid), and today was the day that he and Vincent went to get a job. Walking down the street they met Barret. \"What's happening fools?\" he shouted. \"We're trying to get a job and we're looking for help so why don't you join?\" asked Cloud. \"Well tonight we're going on the pull and the job office is down the road, so let's go!\" Edward Zitron, London WIN WIN WIN WITH COMET CAME DONE LETTERS CVG: Your chances of winning are better than one in a million, because we don't get a million entries for our compos (it's usually about 900,000). X-CUSE ME CVG Dear CVG, Why is it that I found out about new X-Men games, X-Men: Ravages of Apocalypse (a Quake total conversion) and X-Men: Ashes of Apocalypse (stand-alone game based on the Age of Apocalypse) in comic books and not your fine magazine. Julian X-boy' Onyali, London. CVG: And that is where we stop this letter. As you can see, it is plainly unfunny and not worth the time. And there were another four of these. Please, help us. ON THE WHEELS OF STEEL CVG: We also read about those two games in an X-Men comic, but due to the huge amount of import stuff we could cover, we have to be selective and pick only the titles that are impressive. If and when these games come out in the UK, we'll start talking about them. Dear CVG I have had a PlayStation given to me for Christmas and I'm thinking about buying a steering wheel for it. I have three car games already for it and I plan to buy more such as Toca Touring Car and Gran Turismo when it comes out. Please could you advise me which would be the best to suit my needs, which games are compatible with each steering wheel and if all car games work with the wheel? Tom Parkin, Harrogate, North Yorkshire. SHE JUMPS! SHE SHOOTS! Dear CVG, I am 11 years old and me and my Dad (Paul) are video game maniacs. We own a Saturn, PlayStation, PC, Nintendo, CDi and Mega Drive. Last year Resident Evil got a High Five and Tomb Raider got four. Luscious Lara can jump, run and shoot at the same time. Please tell me if RE2 can do these things. Swines!! Sam Sheppard, Cardiff CVG: The best wheel to buy is Logic 3 Top Gear Steering Wheel. It works on any format and because it is both analogue and digital it will work on any driving game. It even has a mock leather trim around it! The downside it that it is expensive at .99, but is easily the best on the market.

"computer video games UDBUDO NINTENDO 64 ACTION GAME BY NINTENDO  PRICE .99  SUPER NES PREQUEL AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE CARTRIDGE INC. BACKUP RELEASED BY THE GAMES TEL 01703 653 377 APRIL RELEASE 1 PLAYER HINTENDO 64 Anyone with a funky mind and super-sleuth skills will love this. Yoshi's Story is a totally fun-time, inventive adventure. YOSHI'S STORY HAND MADE WORLD nce 3D is not an option in a platform game, the only way to go is with new gags and greater detail. In Yoshi's Story both those elements are represented brilliantly. Nintendo wrote the book on cool platform games, and PlayStation just cannot look this good â not in this style, not in a million years. Of course Nintendo exists mainly for kids. Most PlayStation users prefer slick driving games, and steer clear of childish guff like Yoshi. But it used to be that all video games appealed with fun ideas video GAMES, remember? Well, in case you've forgotten how to think like a kid you know, getting what you want by being cheeky here's a game that'll bring it all back! ............................. Yoshi's Story looks amazing, no doubt about it. The visuals boast some of the most vivid detail we've seen in this style of game, and everything moves super slick (60 frames-per-second animation, those of you who appreciate it in technical terms). Nintendo's artists have created the whole look of the game as a Hand Made World. As well as being a convenient way of explaining away the 2D nature of the game, this allows for a totally unique style. The fascinating variation between levels from rubber-inflatable river banks to cardboard trees keeps your attention ultra keen at all times. SUPER MARIO WORLD ON N64. WE HOPE Patchwork trees and a denim sky. There's even a Nintendo tab on the pocket! It looks like a model. Things aren't always what they seem in Yoshi's Story. GOO GOO GA GA 23 Wood is carved and painted to look like a night sky, complete with cut-out crescent moons and stars. Old pieces of newspaper, and old boxes, are joined to create the stained walls of this cavern. You need circus training to get the highest score! Once again N64 proves that it not only can produce games which look fantastic, but have magical sound too. All through the game, at any moment, the Yoshis' voice reactions to their surroundings. If you listen carefully Yoshis give you clues to secrets, or tell you whether something is good or bad to eat. Yoshis make noises to tell you they're happy (healthy), growl at enemies, groan if they have to move something heavy, or hum a tune while standing still. This constant babble makes you feel goofily attached to the little fellers. It's really painful when you mess up and lose one of them! This Yoshi is really happy here, clasping his hands and looking up into the sky-hearts filling his eyes (eeuch!). When a Yoshi spots an enemy, he growls like a lap dog. This is pretty funny really since all Yoshis are soft! If a Yoshi smells something suspicious he stops to exclaim, \"Huhn?!\". Keep searching! You're getting close! 16 "


"LOOKING FOR CLUES computer video games So we've established that Yoshi's Story is a game you'll really appreciate looking at and listening too. Big deal! But we're not wasting your time here not at all. Peering hard at the Hand Made World and making sense of everything you hear is your key to finding everything there is to find. Nintendo's approach to platform games is always to give players 20% obvious stuff, 80% hidden like, almost invisible. In this respect Nintendo have revitalised the formula which helped make the entire Super Mario Bros series so amazing. NINTENDO 64 HELP US FIND EVERY SECRET IN THE GAME, OR WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING YOU ALONG FOR THE RIDE. OKAYI OPERATION DINO DUDES Some pipes are entrances to secret parts of the book. This is a tradition carried over from the Super Mario Bros series. 64-bit Yoshi is the first ever 2D 'platform hero' to use analogue control. This means eight-way directional control as with most platform games, only in this case it's pressure sensitive. Instead of tapping the direction to edge the Yoshis along a tricky ledge, just use less pressure on the stick. One of the Yoshis' main gags is to throw eggs at the enemy, or objects. Using the 3D stick you can target much more easily, and accurately. Yes, it is a bit tricky at first but you soon get to see the benefits. SUPER MARIO WORLD ON N64 WE HOPE All fruit makes a miserable Yoshi happy again. So does the Smiley Flower. Bite its head off to feel the zeal. If you want the real challenge the idea is to collect melons only. Melons are Yoshi's favourite, but they're hard to find. * 74* Slurping up enemies causes a Yoshi to drop an egg from its ass! You can get a maximum of six hanging back there. Enemies that are the same colour as your Yoshi are tastier. They replace three petals instead of one from the. Use the Warp Bros to save time. There are four of these in each stage, but they need to be woken up first. You get to choose a Lucky Fruit for Yoshi at the beginning of the game. A Yoshi's Lucky Fruit makes him even happier. 'Hip Drop' the ground next to a 'Heiho'! This causes them to change colour. Do this until you get a tasty one! Use the cross-hair to target eggs. You can get more than one thing if you're feeling pretty clever. If you're not Tom Guise. VIEW INTENDO Eggs explode like fireworks, Yoshis gain extra distance damaging anything in range.

"computer Video games TOTAL COMMAND IS IN DEMAND 000 This picture book world has only six chapters, each of which has four areas. That's 24 'worlds' in all. Super Mario World on the Super NES has 96 (okay, 97 if you own an Action Replay!). Every Nintendo platform game since Super Mario World has been judged Too Short by comparison. But whereas the secrets in Super Mario World are more stages, the goal of Yoshi's Story is to make the Yoshis as happy as possible happiness being judged in racks of bonus points. NINTENDO 64 Move fast before these platforms disappear. There's no time limit in Yoshi's Story. So you can spend as long as you like exploring. The trick is to look for clues in everything. Most of the best stuff in Yoshi's Story is completely invisible at first. Most areas of the book remain closed until Special Hearts are found. There are three Special Hearts hidden in each course sometimes you can hear them ringing as they rock in their hiding place. Cough... SUPER MARIO WORLD ON N64--. WE HOPE Choose from six different coloured Yoshis at the start of each course. Some are more suitable than others for the type of area. By the way, CVG knows of at least two more varieties of Yoshi.

The countdown to the UK release of Capcom's most awaited game has begun. And we're following it all the way. Nothing has prepared you for this game. PIHL2 WHAT DO YOU WANT? BLOOD! verybody knew that Capcom were going to make a sequel to Resident Evil. It was just a question of when. They got well over half way through what is now known as 'Resident Evil 1.5 when it was completely scrapped and started again. What you have been seeing over the last couple of months in CVG is R.P.D. almost the end result. And believe us, it's going to be a monster title in every sense of the word. Those that are really desperate for it will be pleased to know that it's available on import NOW! The TV advert, which was directed by George 'Night of the Living Dead Romero is also complete, and may well be shown over here too. The Resident Evil horror bandwagon is picking up pace, and CVG is standing right in it's path! ES BLOOD THIRST-DAY IS ALMOST UPON US! And we want it now!!! To say that Resident Evil 2 has more blood than the first game is a slight understatement! The game is oozing with it! Decapitating zombies with the shotgun now sends more chunks of brain and skull flying in all directions, while blasting the enemies close up can rip the torso off completely, leaving the legs walking towards you! Then the top half uses its arms to try and get hold of your ankles! But by far the funniest quirk we found was this. When a zombie grabs hold and starts eating your neck, you can push them away by whacking the buttons and D-pad. If they have a good enough grip however, an arm will stay holding on to your body, while they hit the deck! Awesome. STARTER FOR TEN 1 Check this out! If a Zombie gets a good 1 That ocean of blood is the result of four grip on your body, when you push them shotgun head shots. Sod cleaning that up. away the arm stays on your body! Hahaha! NOOS ININO) A few more things have become apparent since our last little outing into the Raccoon City Police Department. For a start, the screenshots you see accompanying this very box are taken from the jawdropping intro. It tells the story of how Leon came to be in Raccoon City and how he meets Claire, who is being hounded by zombies in the local diner. An interesting development is that the game is going to be on two disks. The second being the disk solely for Claire. On this you get a different introduction, which shows her arriving in Raccoon City and her chance meeting with Leon. The game differs a lot more for Claire even the guy in the weapon shop at the beginning has a crossbow instead of a shotgun, and will feature more plot changes, effectively giving you two games for the price of one! Try to get the dogs in a group, so you can shotgun them all together and save valuable ammunition. RACCOON CU 20 "


"computer video games RPD PlayStation The Resident Evil Wonderbra campaign wasn't as successful as they hoped. The first part of the game that will make you jump is here. Except we've ruined it now. SAY HELLO TOWY BIGGER FRIENDS! Once you've gained a better weapon than the handgun, it doesn't mean you should disown it. Because no sooner have you grabbed the shotgun, than you come across this lovely set of handgun parts. This adds a shoulder \"rest' that Leon uses for a better aim, and also makes the gun fire three rounds automatically, if you hold the button for slightly longer than usual. You can switch the rapid fire off, but it is really satisfying to see zombies being showered, sprayed and peppered with bullets. This sort of picture needs no explaining! It is possible to mince up to six zombies heads at once, but the most we managed was four. The three unlucky sods in this pic got well and truly wasted. Just look at all those giblets! Awesome!

It means a small key in your possession. Use it on the you can fire off three rounds at a time and desk and collect your well deserved prize... have the ultimate handgun weapon. AND ACTION! The good news is that most of the cut scenes have been added since the last version we saw. We can guess that by keeping the characters rendered instead of human actors, they not only lose all the really cheesy look about them but mean that gore factor can remain high as the people aren't real. Occasional sequences crop up when a particularly new enemy appears, like the ceiling beast pictured to the right. The trail of gob looks very tasty. Saliva action with the ceiling beast.

The police dog kennel is thriving with mutated dogs, many of them running loose outside (don't stray too close to the cages) and the sewers hold the giant spiders. A word of warning. These spiders don't run directly at you, they crawl on the ceiling out of you view and drop down on top of you, or gob acid at your head! PlayStation Zombies even lurk behind doors.

Those that have read all of our RE2 coverage will know her as the woman whose name is a password in the first game. She is in town to locate her boyfriend John, who worked for Umbrella in Chicago before going missing six months ago. From the clues thrown out in the game, Umbrella have been experimenting on some of their employees and it looks as though John could well turn out to be the hideous mutation on this months cover. Ada is also looking for the reporter Ben Burtolucci, who knows a hell of a lot about what's going on in this station. He's here for a Scoop, and found out a little more than he bargained for. The first human character you come across in the game, is a fellow police officer. Unfortunately, he's bitten the bullet so to speak and has been munched on by a zombie. While he hasn't changed yet, the next time you meet him he's not only topped one of his fellow police officers, but morphs in front of your very eyes! Watch him slowly turn a pale blue, then purple and his eyes glaze over as the virus kicks in. Awesome! The spiders will work as a team to attack you. 1 The police car park is the location where you meet Ada for the first time. The story unfolds...

Go for it Goemon! t's funny what some Japanese games lose in translation. Sometimes dialogue and scenes are cut. Characters are renamed Dave or Keith. And why? For the benefit of the overseas markets, who don't like to buy anything that looks too foreign. With Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, Konami is taking the chance that quality adventure gameplay and 3D graphics will win over the masses who would otherwise be put off by the overall Japanese-ness of the game. It's a story of alien visitors stirring things up in ancient Japan, and the story is told with Japanese-style scenery, monsters, houses, flowers, people, and heroes called Ebisu maru, Yae and Sasuke. The only things being changed for our benefit are the text and speech. We can hardly wait!

This time the duo are joined by two new characters, Yae, a female secret agent Ninja, and Sasuke, a mechanical Ninja. As far as abilities go, all four heroes are basically the same, but they use different weapons, and acquire different objects and magical powers during the course of the game. Also, there are occasions when non-player characters are willing to give information and items to one character, but not the others. At the start of the game you can switch between Goemon and Ebisu maru at will. After you've defeated the first boss Yae joins the party, and you 'acquire' the deactivated Sasuke shortly afterwards. The only way to power him up and get him on the team is by finding two batteries later in the game. *<1 21+ Ts 87 Information is essential to your quest and the only way to get it is by talking to everyone you meet.

To this end, all the characters are armed with their own particular weapons. Goemon has his head-knockin' pipe, as well as the ability to fling the golden medals he collects, while Ebisu maru packs his saw-hammer. Yae comes equipped with a Katana sword and Sasuke is equipped with Ninja knives and bombs. As the game progresses the heroes acquire new weapons and abilities which are essential in especially tricky situations. Goemon gets a hook shot that smacks distant foes and can drag him across unjumpable gaps, while his medal-throwing ability becomes a flame shot. Meanwhile, Yae gets a bazooka and Sasuke ends up with throwing knives that freeze enemies and chill fiery ground.

"computer video games FEATS OF SORCERY NINTENDO 64 Collect eight sweets and Ebisu Maru wins the power of shrinkage. One of the other differences between the four heroes is the magical powers they gain during the quest. The people you meet challenge one of the heroes to a subgame and if you complete it within a time limit the power is yours. The first magic subgame you come across sees Ebisu maru shrunk down and placed in a chest. The idea is to collect eight sweets before the time runs out, a task that's complicated by the baddies loose in the chest and the bloke who occasionally opens it, shakes it about and drops bombs on you. If you get hit three times you have to start again, but if you manage it Ebisu maru can magically shrink himself to get through tiny openings. The other characters play different games to get different powers: Goemon has to throw boxes at mole creatures to acquire super-strength magic: Yae has to climb a waterfall to get a mermaid spell that lets her swim anywhere; Sasuke has to climb a column to earn the power of flight.

At certain points in the game, Goemon blows a magic horn to call the giant war robot, Impact, then he climbs aboard to take the controls. The appearance of Impact usually means there's a major boss in the area somewhere, but before you can take him on you have to guide Impact through the 'High Speed Impact Bomber' stage. Powered by his rocket skates, Impact speeds through a scrolling valley full of buildings protected by cannons and flying defences, and he has to trash the lot. You have to steer him through the stage, smashing buildings and aircraft with his mighty pipe, shooting giant nasal medals at the cannons, and jumping over the chasms and bridges that threaten to trip him up. Shooting the cannons provides more medals and destroying everything else fills Impact's oil tanks. These act as his stamina reserve during the forthcoming boss assault, so if you go easy on those townsfolk and their pagodas you won't stand a chance in the next stage. Unfortunate, but true.

With skill and a bit of puzzle-solving savvy you should be able to find a way into the boss' inner lair, but to complete the level the boss has to be destroyed. The bosses measure up to the usual Konami standard, ie. imaginative, and very tricky until you work out their patterns and weak spots. Sometimes teamwork is required, as the only way to beat a boss is to start with one character and finish him with another. In the Impact battle game you get a Goemon'seye-view of the action from the cockpit in Impact's head. Ahead of you is the enemy boss who attacks with rockets, death parasols, magic, fists, the lot. Impact has a few moves of his own, but mastering them takes timing and a bit of fighting-game-style control skill. When the enemy gets close you can block or punch with Impact's left and right fists, and even string together simple punch combos. If he's at a distance you can fire nasal medals. These are just the basic moves though. With a bit of skill you can launch a hook shot pipe to drag him towards you, then pound him with the robotic version of E Honda's Hundred Hand Slap.

It came out in Japan just before Christmas and has done brilliantly already, but it's not due over here in the UK for a while. Instead of simply translating the text, Sony are taking their time making a game that UK gamers can't resist improving the graphics, speeding the action up, adding new cars and even adding a soundtrack by some of the hottest bands around.

Now cut everyone up! You can't roll the cars right over, but a nasty crash can knock them into the air. First things first Gran Turismo has some of the most incredible graphics ever seen in a console game. The car models are all extremely detailed and sharp, but it's the reflection effect that makes them look so great. Lights reflect off shiny cars, moving around the contours perfectly to give an extra sense of realism. The reflections aren't genuinely of the scenery outside the car, but they're so well done it's often hard to tell. BUT. BUT... HOW? GT is the first game to use Sony's new \"Performance Analyser\", a clever piece of equipment which tests games and works out exactly how much each part of the PlayStation is being used. This lets developers work out where they can improve their games to get the very most out of the PlayStation, and it shows with Gran Turismo. From now on, almost every PlayStation game will be developed with the Performance Analyser for maximum effect, \"enabling PlayStation developers to create the Third Generation of games,\" as Sony say. The Performance Analyser has also brought up a few surprises. Apparently the conversion of Tekken 2 only uses about 30% or 40% of the PlayStation's potential... COMING SOON Â« A LONG TIME AGO, IN A GARAGE FAR FAR AWAY & The introduction sequence for Gran Turismo lets you know straight away around. The rendered car models aren't the most detailed we've ever that this is a stylish game.

Perhaps that's true, but not entirely so. Sonic Team are clearly still coding for the Saturn and if that ain't a top team, then we don't know what is! And they're not just working the hours either their latest project, the futuristic firefighting epic Burning Rangers, promises to be an innovative and action-packed masterpiece. However, with all the new features they're constantly adding, we only pray they make their April 23rd (UK) release date! 0527 16 NX8 AR TORCHED AND REBUILT BURNING RANGERS: THE FUSE HAS BEEN LIT! THE SMOKE CLEAR A game in which you play hi-tech firemen, jetpacking around collapsing skyscrapers and spaceships, looking for civilians. When playing last month's version of the game, the excitement of putting out the flames with our CO2 cannons and leaping away from flash fires was enough. But Sonic Team obviously weren't satisfied, as they've redesigned much of the early levels, with new areas, bridges, extra structures, even giant slabs of collapsed concrete roof. The sensation of being inside a rapidly-disintegrating building is greater than ever, and the levels are now better graded too. Last month we mentioned there's going to be a two-player mode and bonus game included. The latest version of the game sheds slightly more light on the situation. From what we've seen, the Versus mode will be similar to Virtual On, allowing two fire-fighters to battle each other in a set of training arenas. As for the Bonus game, this looks to be some form of side-scrolling shoot 'em up! Could be that these will be interspersed throughout the game, as the Rangers race to the scene of the fire. 04 12 Crystal hr CON Nodico 32% NC* Dom Hanging on for dear life.

"%07 COMPLETE SHOOTING GAME computer video games  ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD BY TANTALUS SECA SATURN APRIL RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS RELEASED BY SEGA TEL 0181 995 3399 SATURN Sega's unholy work continues apace. The Saturn experiment known as House Of The Dead has reached its second phase. And the results are... fascinating! ast month we revealed early develop ment work on the Saturn version of Sega's smash-hit arcade shooting game. Now, in the span of thirty days, the project has progressed far quicker than expected. More monsters, more levels, more playability the work of outside development team, Tantalus, has finally begun to show what they're capable of. And the result could be a very close conversion of the coin-op. See for yourselves! Please LEGION OF THE DAMNED In the last version, only basic zombies were in the game. And some creatures the monkey zombies for example were replaced with shadowy versions of the dogs. Now the monkeys are in there, the chainsawsporting bearded zombies, the giant hammer-wielders, bats and giant maggots. The first boss now looks more complete too, with pipes dangling out of his body (compare these pictures to last month's). It's finally clear how impressive any conversion of HotD is on the Saturn, as these are more than just hollow 3D figures. They have internal graphics too, which are revealed when you blow chunks off them. HOUSE OF THE DEAD DEAD GOOD! The zombie of Gary Bushell is now in the Saturn conversion. Looking good! Zombie monkeys? What did you think they were? Gibbons? Now on Saturn! THE SECOND STAGE The first level is nearly complete. The second stage is also playable. With all the routes already in there, you can now journey into the underground passage, through the kitchen, dining room and laboratory. All the sound effects are also present, with your character exclaiming \"there's no way across!\" when you fail to raise the bridge in the lab. Although some of the textures look rougher, it's all starting to look and move very much like the arcade original. How it plays though, is still a bit vague the gun can't be properly aligned. The first boss Chariot. His textures have been improved. COMING SOON Without his armour, he now has his meaty pipes. Korking! WHAT'S STILL TO BE DONE? DEAD ON TARGET! We've yet to see much of the third level. It still in a very basic form with untextured polygons. Also, there's still some scenery items to be added to the previous levels, such as the furniture or the barrels that contain the bonuses. At the moment, if you go in the kitchen there are just numbers floating around on the cooker to represent the pots and pans. The second boss too, only appears as a set of balls and numbers indicating his contact zones. The crackling intermissions screens and cut scenes have yet to be properly included too. Saturn House Of The Dead is set for a UK release on the 9th April and our confidence in the conversion has increased after seeing this latest development. All will be revealed in the review next month. SHOOT OUTSIDE OS THE SCHEEN 35 "

COMPLETE TM SEGA SATURN APR RELEASE 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY SEGA TEL 0181 995 3399 BATURN Joo It seems like a competition to see who makes the biggest game. Two discs for Resident Evil 2, three for Final Fantasy VII and now Panzer! Where will it end? PANZER DRAGOON SAGA IOUR DISCS! That's one huge game no matter what system you're playing on. Team Andromeda looked to have excelled themselves yet again with this, their newest Panzer game. Even though we can't fully appreciate the mechanics of the game until we get an English text version, it's still shaping up nicely. The main criticisms people had with the previous games is that they were too easy. This looks to have quashed that trend. 115/ 10 11 12 OBS The variation on the fortress boss from the previous two games. The whirlpool effect here is nothing short of amazing! Swoon. THE MAMMOTH PANZER RPG NEARS COMPLETION IT'S GOT THE LOOK One thing we must mention is how visually impressive this game is. Since the last update, the whole look is much more solid, in particular the stages where Azel travels through villages on foot. These settlements are vast in size and are also lit according to the time of the day. The variation of the landscapes is another chance to see the effort that has gone into this game. The finalÃ© to disc one sees you overlooking a settlement on an ocean, and the effect you get cannot fail to impress even the toughest cynics. Chaos reigns in the more intense battles. Beserker barrage! BIG BOSS MEN NOOS ININO) Though the emphasis on the game has switched to the RPG angle, this doesn't mean that Team Andromeda have lost the ultra cool boss characters. The huge airborne mothership bosses that appeared in one form or another in previous Panzer games are back for a third time, as well as cavern-filling mutations and underground armoured sand-beasts. We're looking forward to the ride! PANZ PEOPLE As you read this, a finished copy is currently being put through its paces here in the CVG Armoured Core Battlebase. We'll be bringing the full review next month, so tune in then. This is one of the new Dragoons found deep into your adventure. "

Happy days indeed! 18th 20th February Makuhari Messe, Tokyo You may have to wait a couple of issues for the extensive report on this show, but believe us when we say it'll be awesome! Marvel vs Capcom is sure to be one of the biggest games of the year if the shots we've seen already are anything to go by.

This will have some of the hottest games of the year on display, including Tekken 3 and (hopefully) Metal Gear Solid.

Entries marked IT AIN'T 'ALF HOT MUM will be opened. Anything else won't. GRAND THEFT AUTO PANZER DRAGOON SAGA NAGANO WINTER OLYMPICS CHECKPOINT We had loads of entries for this compo, to come up with a name for the gang leader of your town. There were some pretty crap answers like Mad Slasher and Rock Hard Bill, which went straight into the bin, but there were better. Posh Slice got a small grin from Steve, Ed liked the Wackaday aka The Pink Hammer attempt, but in the end there can only be one winner. And that was Stephen Murison from Aberdeen. He came up with Isle of Dogs Dogs. And it made us laugh so he wins. Well done sir. Misunderstanding of the month goes to the majority of the people who got the angle for this competition wrong. Basically, when we said design the ultimate dragoon ride, we meant that you should design the ultimate dragoon that Azel could ride on. The best entry we got was from Daniel Nemenyi for Edgware in Middlesex. His Dragoon not only had an area completely for Coca Cola and a heated swimming pool, but also Burning Ranger boots! Cool. Konami's N64 sports title adds another chilly feel to the last competition prize this month. It's the official licence of the games that are in progress as we speak (providing you bought this before the 22nd of February) and frankly the British are pretty poor when it comes to the medal count. In fact, the only 'decent' thing we've seen in recent years is Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards. All you have to do, is make a five line limerick telling us how bad he was.

We had goalies with ten arms, refs with no eyes or ears so you can practically kill people without being punished. We liked Simon Mills entry the best though for his mock newspaper sports page that he sent in. In this he says that through DNA cloning, people can have a whole team of Ronaldos or six Gazzas. And the West Somerset Farmers Association announced that farmer Reg Livingstone had signed for Farmer Giles' Dairy Farm from the Keynston Mill Fruit Farm for the bargain price of ,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Is it possible for them to be kings of both RPGs and fighting games at once? BUSHIDO BLADE ou'd think that someone would have used the excellent technology we have for video games these days to make a realistic fighting game, but so far it's not happened. Combat games have been getting more and more over-the-top in the last few years, and simulations have been pretty much overlooked. Bushido Blade is Squaresoft's attempt at making a realistic swordfighting simulation if you get hit in the next with a sword, you fall over and die as you probably would in real life. It's a brave thing to try, but does it work? Select Weapol TASTE COLD STEEL, SCOUNDREL * 1.5 kg In Bushido Blade each of the characters has practically the same set of moves as the last. Instead, your choice of fighter affects your speed, size, dexterity and handling of the various weapons. Once you've decided who you Katana want to play as you must pick a weapon out of the eight available. Each weapon gives your fighter a different k 92.0cm selection of moves, and has its own weight and size ratings which affect your character accordingly. As you'd This helpful young lady hands expect, a weak fighter won't be very good with the heavy you your selected weapon. Don't sledgehammer, and so on. Choose well, warrior. forget to say thank you. SLEDGEHAMMER Total Length: 83.5cm Weight: 4.5kg NODACHI Total Length: 119cm Blade Length: 93.2cm Width/Curvature: 3.9cm Weight: 1.9kg As it's the heaviest weapon in the game, none of the fighters are very quick with it. The sledgehammer is so powerful that one hit is often all it takes to win a fight just make sure you get your timing just right or you're in trouble. BUSHIDO BLADE The NoDachi is very long and light, but isn't as easy to use as other weapons. It has powerful attacks and is a good defensive weapon but takes time to master, especially with weaker and smaller fighters. BROADSWORD Total Length: 85cm Blade Length: 65cm Blade Width: 8.5cm Weight: 4.1kg NAGINATA Total Length: 181cm Blade Length: 45cm Weight: 2.2kg A big, heavy weapon which is slow to attack but has the advantage of being double-sided. This gives you the opportunity for some quick dashing attacks, though you will be left open to counterattacks. A very useful long range weapon, the Naginata lets you stab people without having to put yourself at risk. Although it's also good for defence, if you let an enemy get close you're in trouble. LONG SWORD SABER Total Length: 79cm Blade Length: 64cm Blade Width: 5.2cm Weight: 1.4kg Total Length: 72cm Blade Length: 60cm Weight: 1.2kg While it's called the \"Long Sword\" it's not actually the longest sword in the game. It's very light, meaning that it's quick to use but you need to get close to be able to hit your opponent. Although it's a lot shorter, the Saber is best used in a similar way to the Rapier quick dashing attacks with hasty retreats. You need to be confident with the tiny Saber and just lunge at opponents all the time. RAPIER REVIEW  Total Length: 75cm Blade Length: 63cm Weight: 0.9kg Total Length: 92cm Blade Length: 69.3cm Width/Curvature: 2.1cm Weight: 1.5kg The Rapier is the quickest weapon in Bushido Blade and is best used with fast characters. This speedy combination means you can dash in close, hit a few times then duck away again. The nearest thing to a \"standard\" weapon in Bushido Blade. The Katana is good at pretty much everything, though it works best when used for quick dashing combos and long range attacks. 46 "


"computer GET ORF MY LAND! VIRTUAL REALITY MODE | video games Bushido Blade's battles are set on a massive island which has twelve main arenas all around it. Each one is completely different from the last with different weather effects (such as wind which blows small fighters) and scenery to hide behind. These areas are all much bigger than the usual rings you get in other fighting games, so it's possible to run around at will. If you're in trouble, run away from your opponent! and get on higher ground or hide behind a tree! The most impressive thing is that in some modes it's possible to run from one arena to the other by climbing walls and finding passage ways! Most of the island is linked together like this, giving you free access to the whole thing. Another unique feature of Bushido Blade is the POV (Point Of View) Mode. Your character's controls remain the same as usual, but you watch the action from inside their head. These battles are often more exciting than usual ones because it's possible to creep up on your enemy from behind, plus you really feel like your in the action. A little polygon model of your fighter is shown in the top right corner of the screen so that you can see exactly what you're doing. It shows your current stance as well as letting you know when you're having trouble moving because of injury. PlayStation Your character in the top right corner looks like they're injured. UL A swipe straight across the chest sends your opponent flying backwards. HERE'S MUD IN YER EYE! It's dishonourable to attack a fighter who is climbing to another level. Who cares? Stab him! Roplay Bushido Blade's standard controls are fairly unusual. The four main buttons let you attack high, medium or low or parry an attack (your fighter defensively swipes to knock weapons away), while the two R shoulder buttons let you change stance. Each weapon has three different stances, letting you get into more offensive positions for faster attacks but less defence, if that's what you want. Holding the L1 button and pressing the d-pad lets you run wherever you want. As well as your weapon attacks, there are a few little tricks you can pull off while fighting. Each character has a selection of defensive dodges and rolls, and it's even possible to grab a handful of dirt or sand and throw it into an opponent's face to buy yourself a bit of time! POV Mode shows off the character detail. BUSHIDO BLADE CVG OPINION Select Character 1 This caged courtyard leads to the wooden bridge below, then onto the rest of the island. HTK 1111 Roplas Bushido Blade is a great concept -a tactical swordfighting simulation with the freedom to fight anywhere around a massive island but it's such an ambitious idea that unfortunately it doesn't work too well. By far the biggest downer is the way that the game is so slow. The Japanese version was always very slow, but the PAL conversion slows it down even more, making the whole thing very sluggish to play. You never really feel that you're controlling your character, rather that you're typing commands for him to follow if he feels like it. Once you get to grips with the controls and get into a close fight it can get very exciting, and finishing an opponent with a perfectly-timed parry and counterattack is really satisfying. Unfortunately, most people won't want to spend the time it takes to get into Bushido Blade. Also, the one-player mode can be annoying, especially as a dishonourable victory doesn't count (stabbing people in the back or side, for example) but the computer will normally do it to you without a second thought. Grr. Bushido Blade is a brilliant idea, but the game itself isn't as great as we'd hoped. .6D LOMAS Try running away from an opponent so that they follow, then turn and attack suddenly. LEVEL 1 0 KILLS Hold Forward and tap R2 twice to chuck a (very big) handful of dirt. REVIEW (RATING BATING 100 ou try to kilaa? Very hard to get into, and the poor UK conversion means it's extremely slow. With a lot of effort you'll find a great game in there. Slash Mode sees you fighting off 100 training dummies one by one.

Apparently, while we were saving up for a new cable subscription, the World Wrestling Federation broke up as the various stars defected to other organisations and new wrestlers moved in. Now, with the competition in the leagues at fever pitch, THQ are releasing a grapple-sim that pits the top stars from two of those leagues against each other in a realistic facsimile of sweaty combat.

SPRE 09:16 20 Even Hulk's bald patch has made it into the game. RING-A-DING-DONG! It seems like only yesterday when we were all going crazy for WWF and stars like Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker, but since 1991 the face of American Pro Wrestling has changed dramatically. For example, after years as the favourite of the WWF crowds, Hulk Hogan defected to the at the time less popular World Championship Wrestling tournament. Then, shortly after WCW attained prime status, Hogan moved on again, adopting the more sinister persona of Hollywood Hogan and joining New World Order. NWO has acquired the reputation of being on the darker side of Pro Wrestling, with fighters who have little regard for fair play. As the title suggests, this game features 20 stars of WCW and NWO. All the wrestlers in the game are closely modelled on their real-life counterparts, from their signature moves down to their costumes and hairstyles, and you can pit them against colleagues from their own group or indulge in some Good vs Evil cross-league competition. As well as including the NWO and WCW stars, THQ have created 17 more wrestlers who belong to two fictional wrestling leagues. Apparently, the DOA (Dead or Alive) Wrestling boys are all ex-pit fighters and deathmatch brawlers, while the members of the Independent Union Wrestling league are a lawless bunch who fight no-holds-barred! battle that lets you set things up however you like one-on-one, tag or four-player, every-man-forhimself Battle Royal matches, all of which can feature any of the wrestlers from any league.

The League and Tournament options are similar to each other. Up to eight players can fight each other one-on-one, and with 16 people you can have a massive tag-team tournament. The League Challenge recreates real-life title tournaments, namely the WCW's Starcades and the NWO's Souled Out championships, as well as the DOA Final Blast battles and Independent Union's IUGP.

That event is the Winter Olympics, this year set on their home soil in Nagano. On a recent visit to Japan, Paul got caught up in the Olympic frenzy that is sweeping the nation, and started desperately seeking souvenirs. By the time you read this the games will be in full swing, and anything with the name Nagano on it will sell by the bucket-load. Which is why the pseudosequel to Track & Field doesn't feature the number two as part of the title, instead it's Nagano Winter Olympics '98. WELCOME TO NAGANO '98 NAGANO WINTER OLYMPICS '98 The PlayStation version of the game features thirteen events. Divided between alpine skiing, skating, bobsleigh, ski-jump and a few minor sports to make up the numbers. NALANO TART THE HILLS ARE ALIVE 2origiA SPEEDY GONZALES ON ICE! EDP The next four events are probably the closest you'll get to the button-bashing antics of Track & Field. Speed Skating and Short Track events are fast and furious. Speed Skating is a constant test of your finger prowess. Using the square and circle buttons to build up speed, combined with the triangle and cross to take corners. The 500m course is a relative breeze, but you'll have to seriously pass the pain barrier to complete the 1500m event. Short Track is the same in theory to Speed Skating, but here there are four competitors on the course, and no restrictions about sticking to your lane. As soon as the start gun fires, everyone tries to hog the inside lane. You also have to keep an eye on your skater's stamina, bar. To win you need well-timed bursts of speed, and know when to take it easy. Races take place over 500 and 1000m. A good tactic we've learnt is to get into first place, and physically block your opponents. There are three different variations on alpine skiing. The Downhill, Super G and Giant Slalom. Downhill is the longest of the three, where you must successfully pass gates or you'll be disqualified. Super G is a mixture of speed and technique. While the Giant Slalom is a tough test of skill, as there are many gates to pass in a shorter course. The Giant Slalom must be completed twice before you receive a score. While these three events have a greater sense of speed than the N64 version, the look is still very basic. You must also learn each course by trial and error. The slightest error results in a drastic loss of speed. DR LOVE 33.49% Skiing is a fast, exciting sport. Here it's slow, boring, and a oneway ticket to slumberland.

LOVE RUS 1:05. 21 DISQUALIFICATION No winter sports game would be complete without the next two events â the bobsleigh and luge. The idea is simple, get to the bottom of the course without killing yourself in the process. The fastest time wins. To build up speed, it's more buttonbashing at the very top of the course. Once you're in the bobsleigh, or past a certain mark in the luge, it's you versus the twisting course. Successful steering, plus gaining speed on the bends are the skills to employ here. Hit the sides and your speed can be drastically slashed. It's alright to lose, but don't crap in the snow. * TWO BADFELLAS * QUALIFY 170.00 CR202.22 hHRAE difficult .475 COLLEY Snowboard Giant Slalom and Freestyle Aerials are two relatively new Olympic events. The Snowboard Giant Slalom is the same as the Alpine Skiing event, except here you're on guess what? This event is a bit of a disaster in this game, however it's so slow, the only real challenge is to stay awake while playing it. Freestyle Aerials sees you attempting gravity defying, jumps and tricks before landing your skier safely. This event relies on memorising long sequences of different button combinations.

Here Ski Jumping is a frustrating challenge, with the wind being a real pain in the butt. The problem here is the wind is constantly changing in speed and direction, in a completely unrealistic fashion. You must judge the wind and select when your jumper starts their attempt. However by the time you've reached the bottom of the jump, the wind has completely changed again, throwing the jumper off-course. Curling is bowls on ice, where two teams slide four stones each at a target. The closest stone to the centre of the target at the end wins. It's a simple game, and quite good fun, though the N64 version had slightly better controls. Another Nagano game and another disappointment. While The PlayStation version of the game improves on some of the problems we had with the N64 game, it throws up a new set at the same time. Like the N64 game, all the skiing events are pointless, too slow and graphically basic. There are numerous games around that are far better, like Cool Boarders 2 for example. Ski Jumping is a major headache, the bobsleigh and luge slightly better, but not especially challenging. FreeStyle Aerials contain as much fun as remembering a long telephone number and then dialling it really quickly because that's all you're essentially doing. The few events that save the game from a date with a sledgehammer are: Curling, which again is the joker in the pack, and all the skating events. Only here will you find the true essence of Track & Field. If Konami truly want to repeat their Track & Field success again, they'll have to try a lot harder than this. Their first step should be to look at this month's Melting Pot, with a brilliant suggestion of a game they must make.

Who you gonna call? Sega? Hmm, have they got a surprise for you! total WINTER HEAT thlete Kings is a game that made a bit of a splash a couple of years ago, released in the arcades and on the Saturn. At the time it was rated as a poor man's version of Track & Field. Yes it had nice graphics, but the Konami game had a little bit more to it, more variety and better events. Sega however, have gotten used to playing the underdog, and have decided to slug it out one more time. Konami may have won round one, but with Nagano being pretty poor on both the PlayStation and N64, Sega are about to sneak in the back door and show them how it's done. The tour 09 SPEED SKIING THAW THE FROZEN HEAT! This is the first, and fastest event in the game. The skiing equivalent of the 100 metres. All you have to do is press the action button as fast as you can to get down the slope in the shortest possible time. There's no turning involved, as the course is a straight line, and all downhill. Like Athlete Kings before it, Winter Heat revolves around simple controls and pretty graphics. The theme this time is, of course, the Winter Olympics. There are eight tough competitors, waiting to prove who's best. With events ranging from skiing, to... er skiing. No, only joking, Winter Heat features a good variety of events, and we'll tell you all about them now. WINTER HEAT MO6455 7,0626 VA0623 SLALOM More downhill skiing, but a much shorter course. Only someone's gone and put some stupid poles in the way. The controls are again very simple here, with no directions involved. It's just a matter of some perfect timing. Hitting poles slows you down and can upset the rhythm needed to break the records. DOWNHILL Quite a give away in the name of this event. It's skiing with the aim to get down the hill in as short a time as possible. Now you get to use the direction buttons as well! there are sharp turns and even jumps to negotiate, and the whole thing moves incredibly fast. 222.95 amn vor unos SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATING MORESTEFE 23.24s A great event, racing against three other players around an oval circuit. There's no stamina bar to worry about, just press the buttons as fast as you can, and use the D-pad to go around the course. Be careful you don't get boxed in by the other skaters. There's four laps, so you'll need to pace yourself. LLGRALADE -45.835 29.023 1.165 OK, so you're staring at someone's butt. This is still exciting though. The skiing! 6720 SURE 412.589 * IMP REVIEW THE SKI JUMPING The control method used here makes it similar to the high jump in any athletics game you could think of. The basic aim is to travel as far as you can through the air and land successfully. Launching yourself off a huge ramp and selecting the right angle of jump. The controls are brilliantly simple, all you have to do is hammer away at the action button, then press B to set an angle, then B again to land. 44.93 72.39m Those tender curves, the long vertical drops, hug the bends and keep close to the ground. 39.50m . 1 Only 40 metres short of the world record, oh well.

"MORE CHILLS FOR YOUR BUTT computer video games BOBSLEIGH This is a two-man bobsleigh, only the second person is made up of weird hoops. At the start both men push the Sleigh as fast as they can, then jump in. The rest of the event involves steering them safely to the bottom. Which is easier said than done, because the track is incredibly narrow, full of sharp turns and it all moves incredibly fast. The coin-op of Winter Heat only features eight events, but those wanting to play it on the Saturn will be pleased to hear of three new events added to the game. These extras aren't a last minute thought either, because these are three of the best events in the game! H  ME DEFEL SKELETON The craziest event in the game is just like a luge, except here you're going down the course on your front. The controls are the same as the bobsleigh, with the addition of the B button for when the athlete falls off their tray. SLALOM SNOWBOARD This is a longer course than the ski slalom, with the gates placed further apart. A mixture of downhill and slalom, with a fast course, colourful graphics, and even a button to jump! It's all getting a bit much by this stage. 195 FREN BAD =9266 X ACTITEET 10.3 SOS 28.70s speed SERE The action's very fast. Remember not to blink. SPEED SKATING Just like the short track skating, except here there are two competitors, and you don't have to steer. You do have to be careful when you go around corners however. Attempt to enter a bend too fast and the skater loses their footing on the ice. WITANG AERIAL SKI An incredibly dangerous sport, and one that involves the most frantic button-bashing in Winter Heat. First you must select a trick, with the different tricks requiring different amounts of power to perform them. By pressing the action button, you have to build up that power, but you've only got a short time to do it. Don't worry, it plays harder than it sounds!

CROSS-COUNTRY Set across a mountain course, this involves four competitors skiing around a twisty course that goes up as well as down. What is important in this event is to jostle for position, and more importantly to keep your eye on the stamina bar at the bottom of the screen. Reach the up side of the mountain with it empty and you've got problems. CVG OPINION KELLERE SELECT A CHARACTER 1:55.04 Making no attempt to hide its arcade heritage, Winter Heat is a button-bashing experience that is hard to put down. Using basic controls, but a lot of sweat, the result is an extremely satisfying game. Of course the lovely hi-res graphics help, but so does the speed something that was sadly lacking in Konami's game. This may not offer much over the long term, but you're getting a well-made game that's great fun with your friends. There's a better variety of events than in Konami's Olympics game, and not one of them is poorly executed.

Now we've finally got our hands on the European version, and have we got a surprise for you. In those few months we've cracked the game apart and busted the high scores. So more than just review the game, we'll show you a couple of neat secrets and tips too. OO BODDELE NOW FOR TWO PLAYERS If you've played the original Cool Boarders, you'll already know what a great game it was. The sequel is three times the size. With lots of new features to whet your appetite. The main criticism aimed at the original was the lack of a two-player mode. The first good news, is the CB2 features two player races, plus races against seven computer opponents over nine new courses. The Freestyle mode of the original also returns, so if you like taking to the slopes alone, there's an option for you to play. The graphics have also been slightly improved over the original. They still remain pretty simple, but there is a lot more variety. SEE OLOL LOO 20 TENT TOET STTI 3\" 760 YOUR CHANCE TO SHOW OFF aptent There's a few other new modes of play to make this game worthy of your investment. The control system has been changed from the original. It is more complicated, but you'll soon get used to the difference. Now incorporating the shoulder buttons, lots of new tricks become accessible. The first place you'll want to try these out on is the Halfpipe. This is a long bowl shaped course, with the idea just to perform as many tricks as you can in a time limit. Judges then award you marks. Following a similar theme is the Board Park section. Here is a course full of bumps, jumps and objects to pull tricks on. An indicator at the bottom of the screen shows you how cool you're doing. KING OF THE TRICKS VEC The final two areas of play involve pulling tricks while jumping. The first Big Air Contest, has you whisked to nine different locations where a massive ramp awaits you. On each ramp you have two attempts to do the most awe-inspiring trick possible, with the combined marks making up your final score. With a mini league operating as you move from ramp to ramp. The last new event is the Big Air Master. This is a ranking mode, where you must make your way down a never-ending series of ramps. At each jump you must perform a designated trick. Perform the trick successfully, and more seconds are added to the ever decreasing timer. Foul up enough and you'll soon be out of time. To do well here you need to pull off as many tricks as possible. Not only is this a tough challenge, but it's also an excellent way of learning all of the moves in the game. COOL Both courses allow you to show-off like shown. REVIEW The 1'27\"440 COOL LINCOOL 13 ALLEY-OOP MCSE 720 Shifty 54 "


"THE SECRET STUFF computer VIDEO games WARNING! Stop reading if you think you're a Cool Boarders expert, and want to find all the secret stuff for yourself. Like the original there are secrets galore in Cool Boarders 2, including more riders, more boards and another course. There are even different routes on the original nine courses, that are all pretty easy to find. The only problem we have about telling you how to get them is that the European version of the game is quite different to the Japanese one. This is because certain things that worked in the Japanese game, are changed slightly in the PAL version. Anyway we'll share with you what we've found so far. If we find any more we'll put them in the tips section of a future issue. Now Loading... MUTE GRUB PlayStation TO PLAY AS Boss TO PLAY AS SNOWMAN TURT Finish the Tour Competition mirror mode in first place, and the man is yours. Unfortunately Boss is not selectable in the Tour Competition mode. He does have excellent handling and is fast though. So you should be able to break lots of records with him in all the other modes of the game. It says Snowman on the screen, but this is clearly a Snowlady. The easiest way to get this character, who is incredibly fast but handles like a brick, is to get the record in all events of the Freestyle mode.

Hadoooooken! Sonic Boom! Spinning Bird Kick! Psycho Crushaah! Own all these exciting phrases and more in Street Fighter Collection! PlayStation 11 PLAYIR SELECT 21 he Street Fighter games are some of the most important ever made. They redefined what fighting games are all about, and helped the Super Nintendo get into thousands of British homes. Capcom's updates and remixed versions have got slightly out of hand recently, but this compilation includes of three of the best games in the series. It's the first time that Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo has been available on a console (other than the surprisingly good 3DO version which nobody bought because nobody had the machine) and the first time that the rare improved version of Alpha 2 has been seen outside of Japan. This is one retro pack you don't want to miss out on. PAI COLLECTION SUPER STREET FIGHTER 2: THE NEW CHALLENGERS SUPER STREET FIGHTER 2 TURBO Super Street Fighter 2 was released in the arcades to a mixed response. The graphics were improved with more detail and animation, plus four new characters were included. All the existing fighters were upgraded and given new costumes, plus there was even an eight machine link-up tournament version! Also, Super Street Fighter 2 was the first game in the series to include a combo counter and bonus points such as First Attacks and Reversals. The major downer was that it was a lot slower than the previous game, Street Fighter 2 Turbo. This was an upgrade of Super SF2 which balanced out the fighters, added new moves, new costumes, loads more speed, and made the computer characters far harder than before. The Super Combo gauge was added, giving fighters new Super Combo attacks and more strategic battles. It was also the first game to include the mysterious Akuma a demon who is supposedly responsible for the death of Ryu and Ken's master. Since then, he's appeared in Just about every single Capcom fighting game on every machine. SUVES TIGE To control Akuma (the standard version with only single air fireballs) you can use the stupidly long and fiddly arcade cheat or the simple new console one. Just highlight Ryu and press the L and R shoulder buttons on the Saturn, or L1 and R1 on the PlayStation. He has a dragon punch, fireball, air fireball, hurricane kick and a teleport which is performed with a dragon punch motion and all three punches or kicks.

"STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2 GOLD computer video games This is an upgrade of the fantastic Street Fighter Alpha 2, and was only ever released in Japanese arcades (with the name Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha). It's basically the same as the original SFA2, only with a few slight adjustments to gameplay and the addition of a few \"original\" versions of characters. While they look the same as the regular versions, they have all the attributes and moves they had when they first appeared. One excellent bonus for those who buy Street Fighter Collection is that Cammy is hidden in the game! PlayStation 5393 A new option in Street Fighter Collection means that you can fight with infinite Super Combo power. Sakura has new loads of new costumes and this interesting new jumping attack. THE RETURN OF CAMMY! GOURT MODE GOLKI CVG OPINION Cammy has been included in the console versions of SFA2 Gold, and can be accessed without too much trouble. Capcom have used the graphics from X-Men vs Street Fighter, but have toned her down so that she fits in with the other characters nicely. To access her you must play in Arcade Mode as either the standard or classic version of M Bison and complete the game. You can continue as much as you want, but you must get a score high enough to get you first place on the score table. When you enter your initials, put in \"CAM\". Now, when in Vs Mode or Training Mode, highlight M Bison and press Start three times to make Cammy appear. She has all her standard Super Street Fighter 2 moves plus a new Super Combo. 2HIT Wow! Street Fighter Collection! Every Street Fighter game ever in one! Great! Just three? Oh. After the initial disappointment of not getting the full Street Fighter collection, I started to wonder about the choice of games why no standard Street Fighter 2? Why no original Street Fighter? It's a shame, but Akuma Mode has you battling this is still an excellent package. The against Super Akuma over and over conversions of the games are great, but again. This is extremely hard. it's clear that the animation has been cut quite considerably, as with most other Capcom arcade-to-console games. From playing both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, it seems that the Saturn game 76ANT LEVEL has slightly more animation but that the SUPER Julbord PlayStation version doesn't slow down as Glowych much (it's annoying that 32-bit consoles still struggle at times with things like this) and has slightly better sound effects. But still, the differences aren't that massive. Being able to play the Super Street Fighter 2 games is only going to appeal to fans, but Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is Guy has a new move and even a probably the ultimate console Street \"Firecracker\" style Super Combo Fighter around at the moment. If you've attack. not got into it before, do yourself a DRNKING VODKA favour and make the effort. A great PUTS HAR ON YOUR package, but the choice of games CHEST. AND ON YOUR could have been better. Sy JAMAS SHINS. AH HA HAAAAAA! COMME This great new Super Combo sees Cammy saluting while M Bison performs his Psycho Crusher!

REPLAY e've been saying it for over a year along with the rest of the gaming world, but the Nintendo 64 doesn't have any great fighting games. In fact, it hardly has a single good fighting game. Thankfully, rather than copying existing fighting games like most companies have so far, Genki have tried to do something different. Fighters Destiny uses a points system similar to judo, and has full 3D arenas which players can move about at will. It's certainly got a lot of potential is this to be the first quality Nintendo 64 fighting game? Fighters Destiny has an interesting scoring system to replace the usual \"best of three rounds\" system. The default setting requires you to score eight points against your opponent by performing certain moves on them. When points are scored, a replay shows the winning move and the fighters restart. The point-scoring moves are as follows: RYUJT KNOCKDOWN STAGE! COLISEUM MCL ABDUL THROWDOWN: 2 POINTS A successful throw on another fighter gains you two points. Throws are easy to escape so must be done by surprise if they are to be successful.

"TEST YOUR MIGHT Computer video games As well as the modes we've come to expect from fighting games Oneplayer, Versus and Practice Fighters Destiny also has its own Master Mode. Before you start fighting you get a circle of character boxes marked with either the Master's head or a Joker face. You need to stop the pointer to choose your opponent. NINTENDO STER CHALLENGE 171212 THE MASTER Do battle against your Master in a standard either-point fight and defeat him to be rewarded with a new move.

PIERRE STAGE 3 23.217 MASTER THE JOKER KNOCK DOWN! POINTS WONE W UPPER, LOWER, IT'S ALL IN THE MIND wa Fighters Destiny has its own unique control system which is very easy to learn. Pressing the Upper and Lower Attack buttons at the same time makes you throw, or escape from a throw if necessary. The default button settings are as follows. Mwezi Pick a Joker fight by accident and you're in trouble. He's extremely fast, has powerful moves and will almost certainly destroy you straight away. The worst part is that if you lose to the Joker you lose all of the moves you've so far learned from -the Master.

GOPINION STUNNING GAMEPLAY LEON STACE4 13.576 MEILING The power bar that each character has at the top of the screen doesn't necessarily indicate their health. When you're hit the bar decreases as usual, but you're not knocked out when it runs out. Instead you'll become stunned and won't be able to attack or defend. It's still possible to move around the 2 arena slowly and even jump to avoid certain attacks. If you can stay standing until you regain consciousness the bar at the top of the screen refills most of the way. Fighters Destiny annoys me. It's not because it's a bad game it's more because it's so completely unstylish. I really don't care one bit about a ninja called Ninja or a man called Bob, and the browny-grey dull graphics make it hard to get excited about the game. The fighting action itself is pleasantly different with an interesting new scoring system that can cause some exciting fights. The controls are very easy to pick up, but there's a big difference between the standard and special moves. Basic punches and kicks are simple, but to perform a decent combo or special move it takes too long to get the button sequence out. Also, flowing combos are a lot harder to do than games like Tekken 2 or Virtua Fighter 2. The different approach to the fights will make Fighters Destiny appeal to combat fans for a while at least. Although it's not surprising with the current feeble competition, Fighters Destiny is the best 3D fighting game on the Nintendo 64. 7 SURVIVAL STAGE TIME E13\"57 If you get stunned, stay clear of your opponent for a while until you're fully recovered.

"computer video games 19:41 PERIODI ICE HOCKEY SIM BY GREMLIN  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  PC VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD  RELEASED BY GREMLIN TEL 0114 275 3423 TM APR RELEASE 1-4 PLAYERS PlayStation NAGANO PlayStation Gremlin's lucrative Actua series continues with their first tentative steps into the rink to slap shot Actua Ice Hockey into view. actua ICE HOCKEY merican sports are becoming more and more popular in the UK. Basketball still rules supreme as the number one stateside sport in this country, but ice hockey games are always big sellers. EA Hockey on the Mega Drive was undoubtedly the game that changed that. Now, six years down the line since its release, very few hockey games have even come close to that. Gremlin, one of the leading sports game programmers in this country, are having their say. It's the official Ice Hockey game of the Nagano Winter Olympics, so it has all the national teams and rosters. It also uses the True 3 engine that is being used in Actua Tennis and that has been used in Actua Soccer 2. It has some good foundations, but does the rest of the game build on it? Stick to the 'nads! As you charge the .................................. snapshot, you're vulnerable to barges! When the puck gets near the boards, you can bet someone will end up on their ass! CLOSER THAN CLOSE ICE HOCKEY actua Utilising the same engine as Actua Soccer 2 has its benefits, especially when it comes to the camera angles and the main playing view. The default option is a behind-the-goal' camera, that zooms in and out depending on the location of the puck. The angle starts at around 45Â° and lowers as you skate towards the far end of the rink. Move towards the camera, and it pans back! and up giving a completely top-down view once the action is at the opposite end. It works well as a camera, but the slightly jerky nature of its movement can provide problems while playing. The puck can often be difficult to locate like this and you could find yourself skating in circles. ww NW OVERHEAD GOAL LINE Are you blind ref? GET OUT OF THE WAY! m 18 23 COULDN'T SCORE IN ESSEX YOU CAN SHOVE THAT PUCK REVIEW Thankfully, slotting the puck into the back of the net isn't as difficult as the more recent ice hockey games. The goalies are quite intelligent but are still hindered by players obscuring views, and this is the most likely way you'll have of scoring. Shooting through a crowd of players gives the keeper virtually no chance of getting to the shots in time. Another good technique is to cut across the face of the goalie, and as he starts to follow you across the goal, tap shoot and aim in the direction you just came from. Actua Ice Hockey's press release said, and we quote, \"it will provide the most realistic commentary and atmosphere ever heard!\" This is a fair enough statement if it's backed up with the relevant commentary, but considering it's ICE hockey, it's very annoying when every other moment the commentator says \"he takes the puck up the ice.\" in a terrible accent that makes it sound more like ass than ice. We'll leave the rest for you to work out. 60 "


"computer Video games 1340 ONE TIME IN HEAVEN 11 PERIODI 0.59 The key to any decent sports title is the quickness and reaction speed of the opponents. And also as important is the ability to perform one-timers and slapshots at the touch of a button. Thankfully, the one-timers work very well in Actua. To put them to best use is simple. Skate towards the edge of goal so that you'll just miss the keeper and post. Once you are near the net, flick the puck back to a teammate who should be racing alongside you. Then tap the shoot button before he gains control of it, and a snap shot will hurtle towards goal. The success rate of these is usually quite high, so try to use them whenever possible. GANO PlayStation Fast breaks can work to your advantage, but as the above screenshot shows, the defence are quick to protect their goal. PLAYITAHANSAMI 17 45 PERIOD 1 WAGANO VAGANO The replays in Actua Ice Hockey are a little puzzling to say the least. Considering how we were spoilt for choice in Soccer and that this is the same engine, Hockey seems a little below par. The idea is still OK, in that you go to the in-game options and turn on the replays and, once a goal is scored, the replay appears in the giant scoreboard at the top of the arena. But you don't get any other choice than that. One other handy feature is that you can speed up all of the intermission sections (between goals, and face offs) by holding down the R2 shoulder button. Nothing major, but a neat quirk anyway. actua The first time shot rattles towards the goal, and a certain score. All you need is a bit of space and these will work almost every time. AENOOH 5101 CVG OPINION Gremlin were promising big things with Actua Ice Hockey and, with some aspects, they succeed. But on others they don't seem to come up to scratch. The game is really easy to pick up, the controls aren't fiddly, and there aren't any ultra complicated manoeuvres you need to pull off. It's a case of just play and have some fun. However, I felt more than a little annoyed that a game engine as good as Soccer 2 can leave a whiff of unfinished air as this does. Maybe I'm being harsh, but it was still a little jerky and often confusing to see where the puck is. One other small, but important thing is it never feels as though your players carry any weight. People either bump off you, or you fall in a mess if you touch them. The shoulder barges and checking don't give off the same satisfactory grunt either. Actua Ice Hockey is a fun, but ultimately lacking game that shows that Gremlin have the potential to make lots of excellent sports games, but haven't quite tapped it yet. STEVE PES REVIEW) The guy on the floor has been decapitated. Ha ha. RATING YOU WAIT. ML HAVE ALL OF THEM DAMN ICE WARRIORS AND DANI BEHR EATING OUT OF MY HOOVESI HA, YOU CAN SHOVE YOUR CREDITS ICE MASTER A well-paced and entertaining game, but doesn't do justice to the Soccer 2 engine.

"computer video games SHOOT 'EM UP BY ASC GAMES  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY ASC GAMES TEL 0171 343 3375 TM PlayStation OUT NOW 1 PLAYER PlayStation Not a game based on that song by U2, this is a bullet fest starring a guy with a big gun for an arm. AL DO MO ohn Cain woke up this morning with a strange itching on his left arm. He goes to scratch it, and instead of relieving the itch, he is shocked to hear a metallic clang. Looking down, and in a moment of horror, he realises all is not well. Where once a flesh and bone arm used to be, there is now a metallic monstrosity. Clearly this has an unexpected effect on John. Instead of trying to find out how this happened. He goes into a berserker rage, and just starts killing everybody. Then again, everybody else might have something to do with it. 0 N E DON'T MAKE ME MAD So the scene is set for John to go on a killing spree. In a game very similar to the classic Contra series. it's one man against heavy odds, with all kinds of enemies out to stop you. John has got a trick up his sleeve, namely that big metallic arm, which is also a handy gun. Clearly whoever was tampering with John's arm has had a go at his brain too, for the angrier Cain gets, the more powerful his weapon becomes. This rage meter is built up with how well you are doing. The quicker you dispose of enemies the angrier you become. This means the faster you get through levels, the easier it becomes. RO ONE KABOOM!!! That's gotta hurt. Luckily John is wearing asbestos pants, so that explosion won't hurt him at all. CVG OPINION SHOOT FIRST THINK LATER The game is incredibly fast with huge colourful explosions. All the fancy effects are produced real-time, even the loading times are short. There is a large variety of different weapons to use, and you're going to need them. The enemy chase you with helicopters and spaceships, or block your path by destroying platforms and pinning you back with gun emplacements and sniper fire. But hey, you're John Cain remember? This is what a shoot 'em up is all about. Fast, colourful and an awesome test of reflexes. The first thing that will grab most people's attention are the graphics. Drab levels, but once things start exploding (and lots do) the whole place lights up like it's Bonfire Night. There are some interesting features like the rage meter, that gives One some originality. It's a pity though that this feature does make the game a little easier, especially if you're hyped up for it. The game finishes all too soon as well, lending support to the fact that one is full of arcade style thrills it has an arcade shelf life too. However if you like shoot 'em ups and have felt starved of a good one recently, One could be the game for you. It's well worth having a go, if you're hard enough! Alex HATALAAM Watch where you're shooting boy! You won't like me when I'm angry. Prepare to be grilled. BLOOD IS ALL AROUND REVIEW There are five levels to blast your way through before John finds out the truth. Using a floating camera, the action is viewed in 3D with sidescrolling action and into-the-screen sections. With the enemies attacking from all sides and heights, the action of One certainly keeps you on your toes. There are also objects to interact with, like riding on top of a monorail while battling an end of level boss. Or travelling down a zip line under heavy fire from enemies. There is also a strong platform element the opening level sees John escape from a huge explosion, with the walkway he's using crumbling beneath his feet. A later level set on rooftops has tricky jumps, as you escape enemy fire. RATING RATING Arcade style thrills, which won't last you too long. If you like shoot 'em ups though, you could do a lot worse than this. 62 GrrrrRRRRRRR, now I'm loco! "

"computer video games NINTENDO 64 RESCUE 1:4 3D PUZZLE GAME BY H20 ENTERTAINMENT 3 840 320 1:4 .  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 128MB CART  RELEASED BY THE GAMES TEL 01703 653377 FEB RELEASE 1-4 PLAYERS NINTENDO 64 Tetris on the N64. Obviously the programmers felt obliged to try something different and Tetrisphere is what they came up with. TETRISPHERE 1 700 233 730 WE CAN SET UP SOME PUZZLES TO SOLVE WHILE WE XIDE 5000 ith Zelda and F-Zero X in the works, Nintendo decide to keep your craving for awesome games by releasing Tetrisphere. Right. But, don't let that stop you reading this review, because Tetrisphere has surprised even us. We weren't quite sure what to expect from this, but having played the finished version we were pleasantly surprised. The idea remains much the same as Tetris, in that you get different shape blocks and have to rid the screen of them, but you can only match blocks of the same shape. It may sound confusing, but hopefully this review should explain a little more. 193))))) THERE'S MORE! THERE'S MORE HERE'S WHAT YOU DO The good thing about Tetrisphere is that there are loads of different styles of gameplay. Once you've entered your name, you can choose from five variants. Rescue involves you breaking your way into the centre of the core to free a trapped friend of yours. Hide and Seek sets you various tasks to complete like drilling through specific areas to unveil a picture. In puzzle you have to rid the screen of all blocks using only the designated amount of moves and drops. And the other two are standard options. All of these options are varied enough to make it good. TETRISPHERE 10 700 3 ))))))) Go into the practice mode first. You'll see a shadow of a shape that you can move around the globe. You have to find one matching object of the same dimensions and drop it on top using the A button. If you get a question mark block appear along the side (where it tells you what is coming next) a dot will appear on screen. This can then be placed over any colour or shape. To see if a piece is suitable move the dot over the top and hold B. If it turns white, to indicate a block can be placed here then drop it down using A. Otherwise continue moving it until it does. That, basically is what you do. ORILL. (1:2 175 CORE CORE One yellow block destroyed and three others connected followed suit. Chains are important for success. CVA OPINION I was pleasantly surprised by this. I had expected yet another \"well the Americans liked it\" N64 game, but I'm pleased to say that it was far better than that. It has all the classic puzzle ele, ments that keep you playing for hours. It took a while to actually work out what to do (mainly because I neglected to read the instruction manual) but it doesn't sound as complicated as you may think. It also gets really tough, to the point of wanting to throw it through the window, but that for me is the sign of a decent puzzle game. STEVE PES VS RESCUE 1:4 15 300 3400 SX CORE REVIEW 18 700 RATING RATING TY\" It looks simple, but proves that just because it's on N64, it doesn't mean you need flash graphics. It plays well and that's all that matters. A magic block can be dropped on any shape. * "


"SHOT 3 PN 182 YES * computer video games GOLF SIM MENU BY GREMLIN  PRICE .99  PLAYSTATION VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY GREMLIN TEL 0114 275 3423 ROM OUT NOW 1-8 PLAYERS ROM More Actua action, this time the PC gets a 3D accelerated version of the excell series. Plus fours at the ready. nt golf LIGHT ROUGH 3W NORMAL MAYER 1 actua) ost of the Gremlin sports titles appear on PlayStation before PC, however as Actua Soccer 2 proved, the extra time span makes all the difference as the latter version was easily the better of the two. And, to the great joy of all keyboard bashing gamesplayers, the same applies here. To prove this, Gremlin have included the courses from the original PS game which never made it to the PC, giving you eight in total. Could this be the ultimate golf sim? 19 TDS PAR 4 INS WIENU SCHWING!     GORA The most novel feature in this game is the Actua Swing. This is a completely new way of playing PC golf games, and one that will provide hours of fun and tournament. Basically, instead of the standard 'three button swing' where you stop a power meter for both strength and accuracy, you use the mouse instead. Pulling the mouse back starts the backswing and pushing forwards follows through. For tee shots you set the sensitivity to maximum, so that shots always go full power. The closer you get to the green, the lower the sensitivity should be. If you move the mouse left and right as you swing, the ball will draw and fade as well. It takes a lot of skill to get it to work properly, but is very handy for people who require something different from a golf game. actua GOLF12 404 YDS PAR 4 SHOT IN A2 YOS MENU CVG OPINION As well as having the eight courses, AG2 has a clubhouse full of other options. You can have all of the variations of game such as Skins and Matchplay, and choose the two difficulty settings, amateur and professional. Players can also have handicaps to aid or hinder when playing in tournaments. And of course, who could forget the 'Voice of Golf' Peter Alliss and his BBC counterpart Alex Hay, who provide the commentary and little quips as you play. Actua Golf 2 on the PlayStation was very good. The PC version is even better. The emergence of the Actua Swing gives a new twist to the way these games are played, and even though it takes a hell of a lot of time to get used to, it does give that added feel of realism. There are loads of courses to play through, and with all the different modes of play and multiplayer options it will keep you occupied for a very long time to come. The thing that made it for me though, was the awesome 3Dfx graphics. Rivers and ponds give off amazing reflections and even the trees sway depending on the wind speed. It's a very polished golf game. STEVE HEY UGHT ROUGH W NORMAL GOUDA As you can see, even the non-accelerated version looks amazing. The water isn't as good though. REVIEW P7100 PM SHOT If you find your self with a shot like this, it's a fair bet that trouble and multiple bogeys are just around the corner. RATING The colour of the direction bar changes depending on your aim. Golf sims don't get much better than this. Superb visuals and loads of different gameplay styles make this a definite winner.

"computer Video games GAME BOY POCKET Nintendo SAMLE BOW Told you last month how Game Boy was due for a come back. At Space World '97 Nintendo drove the message home in no uncertain terms. ............................................................... GAME BOY OX alf the floor at Space World '97 was dedicated to Game Boy, most of which belonged to the latest version of Pocket Monster. However there was a surprising collection of games from big publishers who had originally abandoned the format. Developers aren't just playing safe with games, there's new Game Boy hardware expected in 1998 almost ten years since Game Boy first launched in Japan! If you're wondering how such a basic system can hold its own against the might of the current giants of TV-Game entertainment, just absorb the games and gadgets featured on these pages. SELECT START POCKET CAMERA POCKET PRINTER IT'S GAME BOY POCKET MANIA! 1998 Nintends To make the most of what you've created with Pocket Camera, here's Pocket Printer! It's monochrome only (well, what do you expect!), though it can manage three different tones. The coolest thing about Pocket Printer is that it prints out stickers, or 'seals'. So Gocket Camera next time you're sending a letter to someone, Birthday card or whatever, you can stick a picture of you on the envelope. Of course it's funnier if you get Pocket Printer someone to pose for you, after which you dab on a mustache, a curly wig, big ears, and write \"I'm a steenking peeeg'. Then print it out. Oh, what dirty tricks we have planned when Pocket Printer arrives. THE, don't let us down now. This thing doesn't have to do anything to be cool it looks so cool to begin with. So the fact Pocket Camera has so many brilliant uses means it's guaranteed success! Pocket Camera slots into the PocketCamera cartridge port on Game Boy to create a basic form of digital camera with some fun differences: Just like dedicated digital cameras, Pocket Camera can store many images for access later. A digital photo album. The fun starts once you begin messing around with these images in one or more of the seven 'play' modes. First of all you can trade pictures with your mates by using a Game Boy link cable. If what you have stored isn't amusing enough, you can enter the Paint mode, where you get to draw anything you like onto the image mustaches, glasses, hair... whatever (!). In Paint mode there's also a library of GAME BOY stamps to decorate with. Yes, you can share the same space as Pocket Monsters if you like (just about everybody at Space World was making this request!). You can story-board your own movie, using still photos and captions. Or else generate a bizarre cartoon using the animation option. The very good news about Pocket Camera is that THE Stop people in the street are hoping to bring it over to the UK. Expect it in time for and capture their faces! Summer. Demand it if you have to! GAME BOY Space 00000 155 ELFI ODK LE... DILLE 93BO999999 LOSS TEMPO.

"SUPER GAME BOY 2 computer video games Super Game Boy, is the Super NES adapter which allows you to play Game Boy titles on the telly. It has enjoyed some success in the UK, and certainly makes it easier to play graphically complex titles such as the Donkey Kong Land series. Super Game Boy 2 adds the one vital missing ingredient to the standard Game Boy's success the ability to link up with another player! Now, for Tetris and Tennis, this is an option you can be convinced is easy to sacrifice. Pocket Monster is another matter. It's likely that Super Game Boy 2 will sell millions when it's released in January 1998. So far THE Games have no plans to release Super Game Boy 2 in the UK. But they may be persuaded! GAME BOY 'SOFT' REVIVAL POR Here's a selection of games that we know are being shipped to the UK over the next few months. We'll be covering these as they arrive, GAME BOY as we wait for Pocket Monster! 3394DOOMOOOO OOO 1375 | 1:21:2:21:11 132.15 11:13 221111!!!!!!! K22111111!! 1 WARIO LAND 2 199812392 5,800 POCKET BOMBERMAN Supera GAME BOYZ 2-10-7-LT-T2 Here's what Super Game Boy 2 looks like.  PLATFORM  BY NINTENDO  1 PLAYER The first Warioland is a cool platform game. Warioland 2 is another cool platform game! Wario stomps around a few cute worlds in search of stuff that will make him rich beyond belief. He's granted super powers from hats that he finds. New to Wario is the humourous way he reacts to attacks from enemies he might blow up to become incredibly fat, or wobble around like he's drunk (a particular favourite of Wario's this!). Just to keep things fair, Wario is able to inflict similar problems onto his enemy. Brill! Not so new, but still a great feature, is that there are multiple endings to the game. In the original these depended on how much money Wario had collected during his adventure. Wonder what the stakes are this time?  PLATFORM  BY HUDSON SOFT  1 PLAYER Bomberman's first side-scrolling platform game. Hudson Soft have produced some great GB platformers in their time, starring a character called BC Kid (aka Bonk!). Though Pocket BM looks simple, it should present some cute challenges. In addition to the normal game, there's a puzzle-based Jump' variation. MOBILE GAME SYSTEM Transmit information to your PC from your Game Boy. Using Infra Red, the Game Boy transmits and receives information from a PC via a link up cartridge. All games for this system are downloaded from the Hudson homepage. No release date or price has been set. All this technology needs is a killer app', and business men across the globe could be toting Game Boys like revolvers as they travel to work each day. IT'S GAME BOY POCKET MANIA! la o AMES BOND 007 L2:36 2 5 giai AMES BOND Dan DRAGON QUEST MONSTERS GANBARE GOEMON  SHOOTING ACTION .BY NINTENDO  1 PLAYER GoldenEye N64 it isn't it isn't developed by Rare, and it's a generic Bond license. We haven't played the game yet, but it looks to be an action game with puzzle UL elements. Exotic locations (for Game Boy!) and lots of shooting action guaranteed.  RPG  BY ENIX  1 PLAYER What could be bigger than Pocket Monster? Answer: Dragon Quest Monsters. This is part of the most popular series of RPGs in Japan. Much bigger than Final Fantasy. This GB installment mimics the style of Super NES (Super Famicom) versions, compacting a neat quest and cool battle tactics into the GB.  ACTION ADVENTURE  BY KONAMI  1 PLAYER Konami revisit the old Super NES style Goemon adventures in monochrome, including partners he's collected in the last three episodes. The GB version is divided into two main sections platform action, and RPG/adventure. Numerous mini-games break up the routine. Goemon improves his status by stealing from the rich, then blowing all the cash on loads of food, and wicked clothes! But he's not all bad, as this routine enables him to clobber various evil spirits which torment the villagers of Japan. And very imaginative these evil spirits are, in terms of basic GB graphic design. FEATURE MONSTER IN YOUR POCKET * One Game Boy 007 looks basic, but allows you to be Bond on the move. Game Boy deserves more recognition, espe. cially in the light of a possible UK Pocket Monster launch toward the end of the year. It's fun to be playing Game Boy again join the outdoor party! 69 "

For some reason, American gamers can't get enough of Cruis'n USA's unique combination of terrible jerky graphics, appalling car handling, boring straight tracks, repetitive action and atrocious honky-tonk rock soundtrack that could be done on the cheapest Casio keyboard available. But Cruis 'n USA isn't all bad it has the rare ability to reduce people to tears of laughter within minutes. Simply start the game up and hear the title music (\"Cruisin.... USA, yeah!\") and you'll start sniggering. Battle through to the desert stage and you'll find the most hilariously bad game tunes of ALL TIME!

It's a first person role playing title, and you have to create and build a character to defeat Mehrunes Dagon, an enemy first seen in the original ES game. You have complete freedom to make your character by choosing race, sex and even amount of facial hair. Then you are placed in the game. You must wander around vast dungeons, fighting enemy dwarves and imps, finding and solving puzzles to give you clues to the whereabouts of Dagon. It all sounds very basic, and first impressions indicate that it is. But, once you progress and the character finds new weapons and magic, Battlespire really starts to open out.

Then you get put on the ice and have to basically bash the crap out of each other and score some goals. The same tricks can be found in this game as in Jam, in that scoring consecutive goals makes you on fire, and the net catches fire (ha ha, comedy). And you have a turbo button for power shots, and blatant foul moves which are used to rid the opponents of the puck. It's still good fun to play, but I feel that the NBA Jam type of game has had its day, and there are many more Ice Hockey Games about that can do the job a lot better than this.

But, lo and behold the sponsorship appears in the finished version, and I can't help but wonder why they bothered. It's another travesty of a football game and the only resemblance it has to our national sport is that there are 22 men and a ball on the pitch. This ranks alongside the worst football games I've played (like FIFA '98 on Saturn, and 4-4-2) simply because there is no realism in it at all. The players move too slowly, and the instantaneous passes and flicks you need to keep a game of this nature flowing, are nonexistent.

The additions seem minimal, but as a whole this is by far the best Hockey game this month. It's much more realistic than Actua, has lots more moves and tricks to pull off and generally feels more like a Hockey game. It's not as initially fast as Actua, but once the controls have been mastered, you get a continuous paced and enjoyable game.

Offering a more realistic approach to the sport than most rival boardin' games, it features more realistic tricks as opposed to the crazy 2000 degrees spins you find in Cool Boarders. There's a nice variety of courses, with a trick ramp and a halfpipe, in addition to which you get a whole mountain to board down, which is split into tracks. Like Cool Boarders there are sections where you get marked for tricks, and they are performed in a similar way. Combinations of the shoulder and directional buttons can pull off a large variety of stunts. The only problem with the game though is the sluggish controls. To get good, you have to really work at it, but the rewards are there. It does nothing to prove it's a CB2 beater however.

FIRST PERSON SHOOTER 49 SHADOW MASTER PlayStation OUT NOW BY PSYGNOSIS 1 PLAYER fter the OK Tunnel B1, we were a bit dubious as to whether this sort of game could work on the PlayStation. But, if anyone could restore our faith, it would be Psygnosis. And while Shadow Master doesn't break any great boundaries, it still proves to be a good fun blasting game. The basic premise is simple: just blow everything up. With 16 levels split through seven worlds it gives you a lot of other robots and humanoid creatures to gun down. Boss characters also impress, as most of them take up a whole screen without much indication of slow down. The graphics are very impressive however, as you would expect from the Liverpool lads, and even appear to have a slight WipEout 2097 feel to them. Overall, I was very surprised by this as I was expecting an average shooter. It turned out to be much more fun than that though.

Yusha (released as Heavens Gate in Japan) proves that when it comes to fighting games, developers will still churn out the same old stuff with a few more characters. The arenas have ceilings and walls, so there are no ring outs. Also, combos are virtually nonexistent, or least air juggles are because your opponent has hit the floor before you get time to throw a second punch in. It has the awesome power move (called a SOL move) that is charged by repeatedly hitting your opponent, giving you the chance to do loads of damage in one hit. And that's about it. You'll have to forgive the negative tone, but when games like this come along, there is little point in sounding excited, because it's impossible.

It's not to be confused with the PlayStation game Symphony of the Night, although there are similarities. If you've played that game then this is like playing a 10% finished version. With a handful of enemies and weapons, and the action spread across five levels, this is Castlevania by numbers. Super simplified, and rather sparse. Our hero has her trusty whip, and can collect hearts by whipping candles. Crystals can also be found which increase the power of your weapon, even adding projectiles. Unfortunately, even by Game Boy standards this is basic. Some of the first GB titles were better than this in terms of graphics and collision detection.

Then came Marvel vs Street Fighter, which was practically the same only with a few new characters and more impressive moves. And now we've got Marvel vs Capcom. Half of the world's gamers shake their heads and moan while the other half run around shouting excitedly like lunatics! If 2DFIGHTING GAME BY CAPCOM you come under the first category wake up!

PUENOM NEW HERO E SPIDERSTANG NEW JEROM COMEN 0x3 LINE GETUS A NICE PAIR Marvel vs Capcom is the third \"versus\" game that Capcom have done, and works on the same principles. You select two characters from the selection of 16 and can switch between them at any time during the fight by pressing the Hard Punch and Hard Kick buttons together. The usual team-up Super Combos and Counters are in there, but there are a few new features... LEVEL LEVEL Notice that Venom says \"Come n' get us!\". That's because it's a combination of both Eddie Brock and the living suit! Excellent! MARVEL VS CAPCOM: CLASH OF SUPER HEROES PLUS! 20 LITTLE HELPERS! FIGHTERS OF YOUNG AND OLD The major addition is that you now choose a third character from a separate group of 20 who acts as your \"helper\". Rolling the pad from Back to Down and pressing the Hard Punch and Hard Kick buttons calls your special partner onto the screen where they perform a special attack. A small icon under your energy bar shows how many times you can use your helper, starting with seven. Here's the full list of helper characters and where they're from: Unknown Soldier (Forgotten World), Tia (Capcom's mascot), Anita (Vampire Hunter), Lou (Chariot), Michelle Heart (Wings of Ales), Sir Arthur (Ghouls N Ghosts), Saki (Nigiirochou no Kiseki), SELECT Ton-Fu (Strider), Devilot (Cyberbots), Psylocke SPEOTAL SPECIAL (X-Men), Iceman (XPARTNERS PARTNER Men), Cyclops (X-Men), Thor (Marvel Comics), QEDO Storm (X-Men), Jubilee (X-Men), Juggernaut (XGGGG | CARO Noen Men), Rogue (X-Men), Colossus (X-Men). ODON Magneto (X-Men), and THORS CENAN US Agent (Marvel Comics). The fifteen main selectable characters are mostly from previous Capcom games, but there are few who've been created especially for Marvel vs Capcom. Everyone has a load of special moves as well as more Super Combos than usual normally four each. The old favourites who have returned are Chun-Li (with a few new kicks), Ryu (now able to turn into Akuma and Ken during a fight!) Zangief (with a team-up Double Final Atomic Buster!), Morrigan from Darkstalkers (she can call on Lilith for a Super Combo), Spider-Man (with new web-based Super Combos), Jin (a pilot from Cyberbots who uses his robot, Blodia, in some attacks), Captain America (with powered-up original moves), Hulk (can bash stalagtites from the top of the screen), Gambit (still boring), and Wolverine (for people who just like banging buttons randomly). And here are the new characters, taken from various Capcom games and Marvel Comics: Captain Commando (uses his original platform game moves, and gets help from other commandos!), Megaman (uses his arm cannon, and can turn into a giant robot), Strider (uses his sword and speedy ninja abilities), Venom (with loads of weird blobby costumemorphing moves), and War Machine (basically the same as Iron Man from Marvel Super Heroes). REDO CHUN OUR HEROES! Look at all the little special partner faces! ARCADE NEW HERO NEW HERO NEW HERO EVENT DERY MARVEL VS CAPCOM VS THE WORLD! At the moment, Marvel vs Capcom is on test in selected arcades around the country but should be on general release any day now.

"computer Video games -GAMES SHOOT ?EM UP SHOOT 'EM UP 100% COMPLETE BY SQUARESOFT BY SOVARESOFT  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE ND OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD TM OUT NOW (JAP) 1 PLAYER PlayStation RELEASED BY SQUARESOFT TEL: IMPORTERS PlayStation puu The horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up is back! The coolest gaming formula of yesteryear has been reinvented for the next millennium by the makers of Final Fantasy VIA FINNON CAN ames aren't what they used to be. Or so we're told. Gone are the days when they looked simple, but kept players hooked with razor-sharp addictive gameplay. Now we get incredible graphics, but the gameplay just doesn't have that simplistic brilliance. Now if someone could combine the two... That someone it seems, is the collective force known as Squaresoft. Having already recreated the role-playing genre to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds, with Final Fantasy VII, they've now turned their all-seeing eye to another hugely-popular, but unevolved, classic game type. Einhnder is Squaresoft's demonstration of what a PlayStation shoot 'em up should be like. Suddenly games are thrillingly hardcore again!! 51PER WHAT IS THIS EINHANDER? EINHNDER SQUARE'S NEW SHOOT 'EM UP! German for one-hander, that's the name of your cool ship. So called because it has an appendage that looks like a single arm. This manipulator' is the key to the game. There are three types of Einhnder ship, and each uses this arm differently. Finding the one best suited to your style is a major part of the game. ORIGINAL FLAVOUR *HAMEPLAY! . ... * EINHNDER TYPE1 * * EINHNDER TYPE 2 * To look at, Einhnder is clearly a PlayStation game check out some of the incredible 3D scenery and enemies on these pages. However, Squaresoft have been savvy enough to keep all the ingredients that once made shoot 'em ups the king of games. In this order they are: awesome weapons, terrifying bosses, everinventive levels and, most important, a cool ship to pilot. Can carry two 'gunpod special weapons, one above and one below. These can be swapped around by the manipulator. The disadvantage is, once their ammo has run out, you're left with a piddly pop gun. Has only one external gunpod carrier, but two more inside! The manipulator can rapidly switch between these three special weapons, and swing it above and below the ship. x 12222222222 167000 92222222222222 NEW GAMES EINHNDER TYPE 3 One gunpod carrier similar to Type 2, but none inside. To make up for this, it features a more powerful twin-shot standard gun. A surprisingly effective combination. x 2222222 SLAVON X3122222222 Because Einhnder is all polygon-generated, the camera is continuously swinging around to give the most dramatic angles. 78 "


"TOP GUNS! computer video games Each lock-on weapon in Einhnder has been brilliantly devised, with some really coming into their own on certain ship types. Once you've used them, they can be selected as standard in following games. There's an excellent range, here's a taster of just a few. VULCAN & CANNON Chaingun and shotgun respectively. The most likely weapons you'll want to use. PlayStation . 1241430 LOAN THE Even the mid-level bosses are monsterous creations. Chasing this scuttling machine through narrow tunnels is a terrifying experience. WASP This missile stack is powerful and versatile. On top, the rockets home in. Below, and they streak forward. NO.1 BADASSES! Some of the biggest baddest shoot 'em up bosses ever, and this time in 3D. Squaresoft understand the old school formula of superb attack patterns these mechanoids transform numerous times, throwing everything at you! BLADE It's a lightsaber! Best suited to ship types 2 and 3, which can swirl it around. EINHNDER SQUARE'S NEW SHOOT 'EM UP! 515230 The first end-of-level boss is effectively a giant grasping claw on a pair of robot legs. 516220 Boss One has plenty of other tricks up its single sleeve though like this rectal laser beam! 9700 SCORE ATTACK! 0011 2HIT x 16 222222 16848.200 160910 Hitting these neon signs is the only way to keep up your multiplier along this stretch. ANNIEN INWCH ULCAN 15B VILCHINA The second level boss is a gargantuan dreadnaught. Can you withstand flames, laser-spit and a chain-cannon all on one screen? The essence of the old shoot 'em up has always been gaining massive highscores. Einhnder takes this concept to the limit with a score multiplier system to rival those seen in Virtua Cop and NIGHTS. At the bottom of the screen is a multiplier bar. Only by continuously hitting enemy ships can this keep charging up to the likes of X16. You can even score combos by taking out multiple craft with one shot. The extent to which Square have thought this score system out is staggering. In some areas, when there's seemingly no danger, you have to find other means to maintain your multiplier. NEW GAMES WE WANT ONE-HANDED FUN! Just released in Japan, Einhnder is one of the most exhilarating games we've experienced in a loo-ong time, but it's yet to be signed up for UK release! Sony are considering it, and we're egging them along. When it happens, expect much more coverage! C C The third level boss rides about on tank tracks, firing out a laser yo-yo. The screen tilts around with its weight. Dead ships dropping out of this carrier. Hit them though, everything in this game counts! 79 "

One of the games of 1997 saw a pretty major battle between third party developers to secure the rights for the PC version, and it's no real surprise that the incredibly deep pockets at Eidos came up trumps.

It has some of the best Japanimation seen, at least in a video game. Plot details are a little scarce at the moment, but it definitely doesn't follow the film. You control a Fuchikona robot (it's a spider) and have to travels through various environments basically blasting everything in sight.

Your robot has the ability to walk on walls and SCORL 000S 200 ceilings to get at enemies for instance, when you're being attacked by helicopters you have to climb onto the side of a building and shoot upwards from there.

The main emphasis behind this game is to give Dune fans the opportunity to go head to head against each other, and that's what they've done.

The control method is something which stood out on our brief test, and even though you use every button, they were set out in an intelligent way. The robots' movements are also realistic.

"computer games video DOCK 'NROCKI In the beginning there was Tamagotchi. Now the next stage has arrived. And this time they've learned how fight. Laydeeeeeeeeeeessss aaaand Gennnnntlemennnnnnnn. We bring you... Digimon! his is the new age. Gone are the days of meaningless childhoods. Watching the weight is a thing of the past. These are ultimate fighting machines, trained to perfection by you for battles to the death. The newest toy from the folks at Bandai is now available in this country, and we've got 'em. The idea behind them is a simple one, but again it proves immensely addictive. For the first two stages of life, the Digimon plays much the same as Tamagotchi in that you have to feed and clean up its mess, but instead of playing games, the Digimon needs training. You have a shadow boxing match with the creature, and the object is for you to try and block his shots. Once they have grown twice, and reached the rookie stage, battling can begin in earnest. LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLEI Bandai decided on something a little different with regards to the launch party and hired an amateur boxing club as the venue. It's here that the first Digimon fights ever to be seen in Britain were staged in the most underground and secret circumstances. Special bouts were set up between newspapers, magazines (not us though) and TV stations. But, in order to get the true feel of the battle, we've had the EMAP Images Digimon tournament and this is what happened... CONTESTANTS NAME MAG DIGIMON NAME Ed Lomas Shaun White Tim Street Mike Newson Robert McBride Steve Key Tom Guise Jason Simmons Tony Cormack Alex Huhtala Jaime Smith Alex Fanning CVG Nintendo mag Nintendo mag Play Plus Facilities Man CVG CVG Nintendo mag CVG CVG CVG Nintendo mag Piranha Bubbles Booger Heave Tucker F Dribble #2453 Bret Little Dude Hefer Brick Haggler 1. JUDGMENT NIGHT Ed and Tony both got byes. Tom's turd chucker was caned by Robert, Shaun and his under developed pet were mashed by Steve and Mike sailed past Jason. Ed's first bout turned out to be his last as he was mauled by Tim, who followed that by getting a bye to the final. Steve beat Mike, then the over confident Robert, to cruise into the final. Tim, who had only had two fights, was feeling confident. Steve, who had three wins on the spin was feeling the pace. So who won the best of the three bouts tournament? PRE-MATCH WARM UP THE GRAND FINALE FEATURE SO THEN HE THREW SOME CACK AT ME, YEH? SO I THREW SOME OF MINE ATHIM. BAM BAMI The start of the championships were plagued by problems. Jaime turned off the sound, forgot it was in his pocket and it died. So he gave it to Tony who hatched a new one, but was two days behind everyone else. Jaime is now being tracked by the RSPCA for neglect and cruelty. Alex Huhtala 'forgot' his, so he was disqualified. It turned out that there were two main types of Digimon competing. Greymon was the most common, and he is a standard dino who spits fire. The other is Numemon, who is the most stupid of all Digimon and also throws turds at its opponent. So, we'll hand you over for the ultimate battle. Dribble the Greymon versus Booger the turd chucker. Magazine pride was at stake, and amid jeers from the Nintendo mag crew of a fix, Steve romped home with a two-nil victory. Dribble earns his place as EMAP's King of the Digimon. A legend in his own right. computer video games DIGIMON 82 "
