Coming to terms with them and enjoying them is part of coming to terms with the twentieth century. A few years ago, a computer would have filled a fair-sized room.

FOR BUSINESS, OR PLEASURE, VIC can keep your diary up to date. Teach you mathematics. Play an enormous range of video games. Even play a piece of music to soothe your worried brow.

"MORE LETTERS on Page 7 GLOSSARY PUT TO GOOD USE If you have a CAPACITOR for generosity you might PRINT this and send me some  — or even a microcomputer! D. J. Sparke, Ravensthorpe, Peterborough. THE INVADERS Dear Sir, First of all, I would just like to say what a superb first issue the Computer & Video Games was; as a beginner, I look forward to buying the magazine regularly. Dear Sir Being an Atari owner, I bought your magazine and was quite amazed at the possible applications computers can be put to. I now day-dream of owning one of my own so have entered this tongue-in-cheek attempt, not knowing the slightest thing about Basic, but having digested the software glossary: PUZZLE SOLUTION RUNS ON 4 CUPS OF COFFEE + PACKET OF CIGARETTES GOTO quiet room when family have gone to bed INPUT Ist cup of coffee and cigarette CURSOR hundred times when random juggling fails to solve puzzle INPUT further cup of coffee + cigarette RAM head against wall for spilling coffee on puzzle VARIABLE success only 3 sides matching POKE-cat for mixing up cards thinking I wanted to play with him OUTPUT -cat into garden PEEK at next-door-neighbour getting undressed with curtains open RUN indoors pretty quick when spotted by husband DE-BUG caused by much head scratching after further unsuccessful attempts DISC perhaps soothing music might help LOOPY if I don't solve it soon INPUT more coffee + cigarettes LANGUAGE getting pretty blue now RESISTOR temptation to give This trick is best appreciated being done and will help build up your score. Also, some people don't realise that you can become proficient in obtaining 300 points from the \"mystery\" space ship. First of all, fire 22 lasers, wait, and shoot the mystery saucer with the 23rd shot. From then on, shoot the mystery ship with the 15th shot. Doing it this way will enable you to obtain a high score quickly. (I frequently score 3390 points on the first sheet!) Another tip, don't shoot the invaders in the middle first but get the ends first, that way the invaders won't come down so quickly. Ian Clark, Dalton, Huddersfield, Yorkshire. Editor's reply: Thanks for the tips Ian, some, I'm sure, many space invaders' players know already. others may prove a real eyeopener. Now a question for you, do you know how to get a Rainbow on Space Invaders Part II? DISCIPLINE SNAG JNR. Anyone who is addicted to \"Space Invaders\" will tell you that when the little green \"meanies\" get a little too low for comfort it can be quite a struggle to clear them off the screen when you only have one laser base left. Well, here is a tip which will amaze onlookers and make things a great deal easier. If there are only 10 to 15 \"invaders\" left but are extremely low (not so low as to allow you to pass underneath without risk of losing a base) and your laser base is to the left of them and the \"invaders\" are going right, try firing at the second and third bases. Doing this will mean you get a \"deflection\" i.e. the \"invaders\" on the second row up will be shot thus killing some of them without you being near them. (Amazing eh?). Dear Sir, Firstly let me congratulate you on an original and interesting magazine. But there is an error in line 200 of Keith Campbell's Adventure column (December issue). Please discipline Snag nr. before you write any more programs as he may well become another Screaming Foul-up. Simon Balfre, Kingston-upon-Thames. Keith Campbell replies: A typographical error did creep into the second column in line 200. It should have read: 200 IF MID$ (E$(LN).1.1) = R$ THEN LN = VAL (MID$(D$(LN).1.1)):GOTO 160 Another point on last month's column. I used READ and DATA to set up arrays — sorry Sinclair owners! You will have to directly assign the array e.g. LET L$(0) = \"COTTAGE\". COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 5 in (H)ARRAY! I've done it INPUT 4th cup of coffee + last cigarette It's the honest TRUTH-VALUE as well. I'm not STRINGing you along, it's a GRAPHIC account of what happened. I'd thought I'd GO-SUBmit this to your EDITor by putting it in the post box FORTRANsit to you. "


"PET SOFTWARE DIATRON ATTACK TRS-80, APPLE SOFTWARE The Diatrons are a mean bunch of aliens. They have no use for what they are stealing from you (your diamonds), but nevertheless, their guiding principle is to 'steal first' and ask questions later. This offends your moral standards so much that you have no hesitation in using your terrible spikes. See them beam down and squawk. Sharpen up your reflexes and beat back the waves of descending Diatrons. 16K (New Rom) .95 Are you fed up with games where you just shoot a few invaders or depend on your reactions, then try a whole new world of computer fantasy, a world in which Sorcery and Monsters holds sway, try: SORCERER OF SIVA A real-time GRAPHIC adventure Sorcerer of Siva is a game where you enter a different world where Amulets, rings, necklaces, sceptres andoh yes, a pair of old boots await you in the magical mines of Siva. Enter the dark stillness of the mine, armed with just a dagger and relying on your magical abilities. But beware of the wandering soulless creatures that dwell in the magical mine, guarding every treasure and trap door. Use your magical powers to slay the bloodthirsty banshee, put an end to the deadly demon, or the goblin waiting to waylay you. Walk through walls and sealed entrances, cast a spell to heal your wounds, regain your strength or hurl bolts of lightning A wizard you are, yes, but watch out for the evil Sorcerer who is waiting to cast his favourite spell forgetfulnessto deprive you of your most valuable magic. But all is not lost you may regain a spell or two, or perhaps even one new to you if you can discover the wondrous touchstones, stone saturated with powers to restore your magical abilities. Be warned too, that not all treasures you might find are true. In experience lies wisdom. Sub Commander This is not an Arcade type game but it is a real time graphics simulation of the commander of a World War Il sub. Your mission as commander is to seek out and destroy enemy shipping, both warship and merchantmen. The merchantmen are not always sitting ducks as Q ships are also encountered but radar, periscopes, hydrophone etc. with a good visual display enable you to hunt effectively. Don't forget to contact your supply ship as running out of fuel or ammunition is rather embarrassing to a commander in line for the IRON CROSS.

"TO FIT 2K OR NOT TO FIT 2K If you have a comment or idea for Computer & Video Games we would like to hear from you. Please drop us a line at: Computer & Video Games, EMAP, Durrant House, 8, Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JB. long program the external RAM pack becomes a little loose. This leads to spurious signals reaching the ZX81 which causes the system to crash. One way of fixing the fault, literally, is to attack the pack with super-glue. This however, is rather drastic unless you intend never to move the unit. The more temporary measure is to support the pack with a thin book or whatever while you are programming. If, however, this does not cure the problem do not hesitate to return the pack to Sinclair, who in the past have repaired items which do not look like ZX8ls at all. ALIENS Dear Sir, Recently, I read about the Sinclair ZX81 kit, and I found out that it was possible to fit a 4816 2K X 8 RAM in 28-pin pack in the RAM location instead of the normal IK. What I would like to know is where to get this 2K RAM from and how much it would cost? I have also heard a rumour that it is possible to fit a 5K RAM instead at a cost of .95. Is it true? If so could you give me more details and what effect would it have in conjunction with the 16K RAM pack, i.e. what final K would it have? V. Napolitano, Slough, Berks. Our expert replies: You are correct in assuming that the ZX81 can take a 2K RAM in place of the two 2114s or the one 4118 used now as the 1K memory. The 4816, 2K by 8 RAM is available through Pronto Electronics Systems, 446-478 Cranbrook Road, Gants Hill, Ilford, Essex. The chip is made by Mostek, MK 4816. The one-off price is about , which is excessive! As to your other enquiry, there are several versions of expandable memory which will slot onto the back connector of the ZX81 in place of the Sinclair 16K RAM pack. These vary from 3K up to 64K at a cost of  to  respectively. This makes the 16K RAM pack look rather expensive. The maximum amount of usable memory would seem to be 64K although it appears that there is a 128K expansion board available using a paging system. was due to a broken leg on the transformer LT winding. 2) The basic (no pun) unit crashed after a couple of hours' use Due I believe, to excessive heating of the Voltage Regulator it appeared that heat was affecting the 8K ROM? Having fitted a larger area of heat sink this problem seems to be eliminated. 3) During periods of programming the machine, with the 16K RAM attached, the whole \"caboodle\" crashes. To this, at the moment, I have found no simple answer. So, the area of my concern at this time is to find an answer to the 16K problem. It is not easy for me to return the pack to Sinclair as I have delved into the workings. To help cure picture jitter of graphics I have fitted 0.1 Fd capacitors to the remaining memory chips. This modification has \"cured\" that problem. However, in the course of trying to solve problem three, I have broken the wire ribbon connecting the two boards together. I've replaced this with a different ribbon altogether and so, probably invalidated the warranty. So, perhaps your resident expert, or other readers could provide an answer to what appears to be a nationwide dilemma. R. L. J. Winson, Mortimer, Reading Berks. Our expert replies: I have come across the problems you' have suffered many times and, with some success, have managed to sort them out. The problem of the system crashing has been one which has plagued many and the only explanation I have been able to find is that through entering a Dear Sir, I am an avid 14-year-old computer addict. In my school we have a Research Machine 380Z which I use frequently. In the last issure of Computer & Video Games you published an Invaders program for the Nascom 2. After making the necessary language changes from Nasbasic, I ran the program but unfortunately it crashed. So please would you kindly either print an invaders program for the 380Z or let me know where to obtain one. Ronald Lewis Aldrington Road Streatham London SW10 Editor's reply: You can find a source from which to obtain an invaders program by scanning the adverts from suppliers of software for the RM 380Z, Ronald. I'm not so sure that this is the best use to which a school micro can be put: I hope that you wouldn't prevent anyone from using the machine for school work, or even to develop their own programs, by playing space invaders! The problem of translating a program from one dialect of Basic to another, is such a common one that a book has been written to help people to do it. The Basic handbook by David A Lien (Compusoft Publishing, 1978) lists the corresponding features of many Basic dialects, including several of those implemented on micros.

"TIONCOMPETITIONCOMP CHAMP MUST PASS THE STEVE DAVIS TEST TAKE ON THE ARCADE WORLD The search is on to find the roughest, toughest, fastest, deadliest, alien assassin around. If you are blasting more space-invaders, galaxians or asteroids than anyone in your pub or arcade, this is your last chance to tell the world about your talent. Whatever your favourite machine, send us in your best score and you could be on your way to the finals of the Best Arcade Player in the World Competition. In conjunction with Taito Electronics we are trying to find the best galaxian-blaster, puckman muncher, asteroid annihilator or invader halter going and give him the acclaim he is due. The competition is very easy to enter, simply fill in the machine you wish to enter on and take the form down to your local pub or arcade. Put the best score you can on the machine, ask the pub or arcade owner to sign it and send it off to us. Should you find yourself producing a disappointing score simply try again. The highest scores on the 10 Current world snooker champion, Steve Davis, has two loves. His first love is naturally enough the game of snooker which has brought him fame, riches and allowed him to indulge his second love — space invaders. Steve is a keen player of arcade games and is often pictured relaxing between games in a snooker championship, by having a quick 20p's worth on whichever game the organisers of the event have been good enough to install close-by. But on 26 January, Steve has been good enough to take time off from a Snooker tournament to take part in our Best Arcade Player in the World Competition. Steve will be along to watch the finalists in action — and maybe pick up a few tips on the featured games and also take on the winner at the mystery final game which will be one not so far seen in the arcades of Britain. Our guess is that Steve will have his work cut out but look forward to seeing him in action on the 26th. most popular machines will appear in our Arcade Action section to give the rest of the arcade world something to aim And the three top scorers on the three most popular machines we hear from by 7 January will be invited to take part in our Grand Arcade Game Final. Are you a top arcade player I would like to enter the Best Arcade Player in the World Competition. The machine I play on is: .. The finals will be taking place on Tuesday 26 January. Tickets will also be sent to the best runners-up to come along and enjoy the evening. EMAP will pay all the expenses of the nine finalists to and from the event and, in the case of the younger finalists, the expenses of a parent as well. Taito Electronics have agreed to supply the three machines which prove most popular, for our finalists to do their early battles on and they will produce a fourth mystery machine for the three winners of each section to contest the Grand Final on. This will be a game new to the U.K. market. And it is on this machine that our Best Arcade Player in the World will immediately have to justify his or her title by taking on snooker champion and space invader enthusiast, Steve Davis. Steve has quite a reputation as an arcade-gamester so it promises to be quite a tense tussle. If you haven't already entered, make sure you don't miss out on your opportunity to take on the best in the arcade world and fill in the card and return it to us.

"THE FOUR OCTAGONS PUZZLE SOLUTION The programmed solutions to our first issue Four Octagons puzzle have been flooding in. Some 300 had been received by the time this page had to be put to press. (And it was one of the first to go!) We have all been very surprised and impressed — by the standard of entry and the amount of work many of you have gone to. The first program arrived on our desk within two days of the first issue appearing in the newsagents and subsequent solutions have come in with some marvellous pieces of presentation. From the hand written, to those that arrived complete with listing, tape and photographs of the display, all packaged in a neat file, they will all be tried and tested by our judges. In the meantime here is a chance to see how puzzle setter James Dalgety of Pentangle, went about producing a program to solve the puzzle. It runs on a Pet but the program has been written, as far as is possible, using general Basic language. IT IS often far easier to solve a \"mechanical\" puzzle than it is to either prove that the solution is unique or specify all the solutions. However at Pentangle, where we specialise in manufacturing difficult puzzles, it is frequently necessary that we do both. The first job is to analyse the puzzle: there are four octagons each of which can contribute one of two faces to any solution. Each face consists of eight pairs of symbols. I decided to split these into two groups of four pairs of symbols, so I could easily adapt the program for use on squares in the future. The octagons have to be placed on a two by two grid, but as the puzzle is only to match the edges there is no need to consider rotations of the overall solution thus one card can always be placed on one of the four locations and the remaining three cards permutated on the three remaining locations. For every permutation of card locations each card must be (a) | rotated and (b) turned over to test each of its 16 edges for a match against its two neighbouring cards. The total of 393,216 tests makes it necessary that the program is as fast as possible, but publication of the program makes it desirable to have graphics or a pretty picture. I wrote the program for a 3032 Pet, but being frequently frustrated by coming across programs in magazines full of PEEKs and POKEs for machines other than Pets, I assume other readers get equally annoyed. So I ruled that I must not use PEEKS or POKEs in my program. This slowed it down and involved some rather untidy programmed cursor movements but hopefully made it more portable. Lines 360-390 hold the data. Each symbol has been converted to a number from 1 to 7. (I started with card No. 1 numbering it clockwise and end up with four sets of alternate edges taken from the front and back of each card.) Lines 110-130 define the vari16 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"ables in the order of the frequency with which they will be used. This is done to save machine time searching the variables. Subroutine 710-850 is the explanatory preamble followed by an option in line 860-870 for users with a printer. (P$ and F are solely related to the print option which gives hardcopy of only solutions, not pretty pictures.) Subroutine 880-1130 provides the pretty picture. To save time it seemed sensible to overprint this with the current status as required rather than print it all each time. This, in fact, led to the necessity of subsequently using programmed cursor movements for the overprinting, but these were still quicker than printing the whole picture and also made it possible to get hardcopy of the essential data only on the Pet printer. On the screen option the program waits before displaying a solution before continuing whereas on the printer option, it continues automatically. To save time the current test is only shown on the screen when \"G\" is pressed. Line 150 directs to the subroutines 400-450 and counts the positions 1-6. Subroutines 400-450 read the data into arrays A$, B$, C$, and D$ each containing the four sets of mutually exclusive symbols used in any one test. The six subroutines represent the six possible locations of the cards. Because numbers are being used for the symbols the cards have been renamed A, B, C, D, instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, to avoid confusion. The position is recorded in AR$. Line 160 starts the loops which in line 170 select each of the four sets of edges that are to be used. Line 180 starts the loops which rotate each of the sets of edges four times. Line 190 skips out to display the current test if requested. Lines 200-270 test for a match of edges and if a no match is found skip further matches and go to line 290 count the tests in N and rotate the cards in lines 300 and 310 and so on. If all edges do match line 280 directs to the solution display and print subroutines. Lines 460-480 either prints the solution or waits 'til asked to display it, using the same subroutine as the current test display. Lines 490-700 are used to overprint the current test or solution onto the pretty picture. Edge symbols are shown in the octogons. The inner letters show the location of each card. The outer numbers show which set of edges is being tested (0 and 1 being on the front and 2 and 3 the reverse). The number of solutions and tests so far are shown together with the average time per test (this increases dramatically the more you look!). On being confronted with the task of writing a program to solve the Four Octagons puzzle; my first thought had been \"How easy!\", my second was \"How difficult\" and by the time I had finished I was convinced that I had set about the whole project in the most difficult possible way. I have subsequently had a brilliant idea but as I won't be allowed to win the prize I will keep it secret unless of course I am adequately bribed! I look forward with great interest to seeing how other readers tackle the puzzle on different machines.

"By Max Bramer In last month's article I gave examples of two appalling blunders made by the program named Albatross in last year's first world microcomputer championship. This month am returning to the topic of errors: major and minor, straightforward and subItle. At first glance, it might seem surprising that a computer a supremely logical device could ever make errors in a non-chance game such as chess. However, this is far from true. A (BLACK) B (BLACK) (WHITE) C (BLACK) (WHITE) D (BLACK) tit LOOKING at computer errors reinforces a sense of human superiority. In the chess field it is also of value to those developing their own programs. It is certainly not unknown for a program to lose by attempting to make an illegal move, such as a Pawn's initial \"double\" move when the intervening square is not empty! A particularly bad case of an illegal move occurred in the first European Computer Chess Championship which was played in Amsterdam in August 1976. In the second round, Orwell reached position (A) against Tell. Orwell (White), to move, next advanced the Queen's Bishop Pawn to the eighth rank and obviously has a trivial win. Unfortunately Orwell neglected to make any pronouncement about the promotion, i.e. whether the Pawn should be changed to a Queen or some other piece. Strictly, the arbiter David Levy (an international chess master) should now have forfeited White on the grounds that it could not play a legal game. Orwell went on to win. The sequel does, in fact, support Levy's ruling. It is clear that Orwell did not regard the offending Pawns as promoted to Queens and perhaps more surprisingly, Tell obviously did not either! Since 1970, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM has sponsored an annual United an annual United States (later North American) championship. In the first of the series, played in New York in 1970, the following game was played between Tony Marsland's program (White) and J. Biit (a program written by U.S. master Hans Berliner the name stood for Just Because It Is There). 1. P-QB4, N-KB3; 2. P-Q4, P-K3; 3. Q-Q3? (developing the Queen much too early), N-B3; 4. N-KB3; P-Q4; 5. N-K5? (unnecessarily moving the same piece twice at an early stage, and losing a Black was able to claim a draw. More difficult to avoid is (C) Kaissa v. Chaos, first computer championship, Stockholm, 1974. Here Black should probably castle queen-side, with good chances. However, the program gave high value to positions where the King was surrounded by its own men \"for safety\". In this case, this objective led Black to fatally weaken his position by 1.... K-Q2? a misapplication of a perfectly reasonable rule after which Black may well be lost. The last example (D) is a famous one, which could only have been played by computer. For seven moves, White has a mate in one, but is in no hurry to play it. A mate in two is almost as good, and so the checkmating move is continually postponed. Black meanwhile manages to advance a Pawn, promote it and eventually even wins the game. Played at the second U.S. championship: Coko III (White) v Genie (Black). White can, of course, checkmate by Q-N2 and the same comment applies for the next six moves. However, the game continued: 1.K-B1, P-KB4; 2. K-B2, P-B5; 3. K-B1, P-N5; 4. K-B2, P-B6; 5. K-BI, PXP; 6. K-B2, PXR =Q: Inexplicably. White now makes a more serious blunder. The remainder of the game is horrible. 7. K-B1?? QXBch; 8. K-Q2, QXPch; 9. K-BI, Q-N8ch; 10. K-B2, QXP(R7)ch; 11. K-BI, Q-R8ch; 12. K-B2. Q-QN8ch; 13. K-Q2, P-N6; 14. Q-B4ch, Q-N6; 15. QXQch, KXO: White is now lost, but should at least play K-K2 to stop Black's Pawn. 16. P-K4?, KXP; 17. P-KS, P-N7; 18. Resigns. Is it better to \"maintain\" a threat or to execute it immediately? There is no simple answer; it depends entirely on the position. I shall return to this problem next month when I consider the so-called \"horizon effect\". MET (WHITE) (WHITE) (6. ...QXP wins a Pawn at once); 7. B-Q2, BXBch; 8. KXB? (the worst move, losing a piece for no reason), NXN; 9. Q-B5? (again, the worst move, losing the Queen), N-K5ch; 10. Resigns! After 10.... NXQ all White's developed pieces would have developed pieces would have been captured. The explanation of this weird game is probably a programming bug which caused the program to prefer positions where it was as far behind in material as possible! Position (B) was reached a year later at the second U.S. championship in Chicago. C.C.C.P. (White) has completely outplayed David (Black) and has a simple win, but it had not been taught to avoid repetition. 1.R-Nlch, K-R4; 2. R-B5ch, K-R3; 3. R-B6ch, K-R4; 4. R-B5ch, K-R3; 5.

FOR SO LONG, A BRIDGE TOO FAR The social side of Bridge has encouraged a vast following but not the computerisation which chess players have craved. In Britain, far more people play bridge, even if only occasionally, than play football or cricket and it is even more popular in the U.S. I first played around with a computer to play bridge in 1959, but it was a massive water-cooled Mercury and results were long and slow in coming. In the 60s the problems of getting a machine to play a full game seemed intractable but computers were developed as a short cut to cope with the scoring problems involved in big simultaneous pairs events, played at perhaps 200 centres and where all players tackled the same 24 hands. It involved some complications in those early days which I will repeat to | To prevent people losing their nice show how lucky we are to have mic magnetic recording pencils and using rocomputers around today. any stray pen that came to hand, the I played in the very first on-line score-cards were conventional punch scored tournament in Ostend in 1964. cards but with ready made perforaAn IBM machine, special score cards tions around any digit that might need and magnetic pencils were used. to be punched.

Although you carry programs for almost every type of competition, you missed the T:1. 99/4, now selling faster than T.I. can import it. Sales will shoot up when the modified 99/4a get in watch for it. To rectify your omission I enclose a sample program written in T.I. extended Basic. This makes use of Sprites, smoothly moving characters, to imitate the Sega game Monaco G.P. BASIC by Stephen Shaw Lines 340-360 initiate the four opponent cars, 3705 initiates your car. Your car is stationary, as are the others, at this stage. The core of the program is 390-520. CALL COINC, dotted around, discovers if two sprites are overlapping at that exact instant. If they are, you go to the crash routine from line 900. 470 increments the timer & distance. 490 causes the opponents cars to 490 weave from side to side at specifically timed intervals. 500 makes them move. 440 moves your car left & right if arrow keys are pressed movement continues until 420 is reached again: internal timing is such as to naturally stop car just on road on left and on hard shoulder on right. To cheat, crash your way to the right hand side of the screen and stay there! 910 stops all motion while crash calculations take place. 930 invokes penalty. 932/933 will bring game to end after 15 crashes of 200 time units but note this section is only reached after a crash! 935 and 936 restore original conditions re:opponent car movement. 940-960 put opponents back in place.

"BY STAN OCKERS RUNS ON AN ATARI IN 8K * CHANGING HEAL Anyone who had a heart would not have invented this puzzle game. Simple to play yet challenging to work-out, Changing Hearts is an unusual problem which is well suited to the computer. The object of the game is to change a pattern of dark hearts surrounding a light coloured one to a pattern of light hearts, surrounding a dark one. As you select individual hearts, different groups of hearts will be complemented depending on your choice. Selecting a corner will change four hearts in a square including that corner. Choosing a heart at the middle of an edge will reverse all hearts along that edge. Finally, if the central heart is chosenall hearts in a cross will be switched. The first challenge is simply to solve this puzzle without losing any hair. A higher challenge is to solve it in the fewest moves possible. Supposedly, this number is eleven. If at any time you wish to return to the starting position, press the letter \"I\", (initialise). This will cost you a turn, however. You can save yourself a lot of typing from omitting the instructions (lines 1000-1110), and deleting line 60. Of interest to programmers' will be the extensive use of strings to hold integer numbers (0-255). There are a number of good reasons for doing this. First, a single character in a string requires much less memory than a number (two bytes compared to seven). The numbers can be retrieved easily using Atari's string splitting convention (see line 900). String comparison is also useful for comparing entire groups of numbers at once. Notice how easy it is to check for a win or less in lines 250 and 260. The numbers are entered into strings as control graphics. Many lines in \"Changing Hearts\" contain special control characters which DO NOT show up in this listing. To enter these special characters, hold the control key down while typing the upper case letters and the commas below: Line 30: P$ should contain HCJCLCHEJELEHGJGLG Line 40: G$ contains ABDE, ABC, BCEF, ADG,, BDEFHCFI, DEGH, GHI, EFHI, Lines 410-440 contain graphics in their PRINT statement as follows: Line 410: QRWRWRE Line 420: ARSRSRD Line 430: ARSRSRD Line 440: ZRXRXRC In lines 1000 and 1010, there should be two control commas (heart characters) in each line PRINT statement. The first one after the open parenthesis character, and one before the closing parenthesis character, and one before the closing parenthesis. The first heart in line 1000, and the second one in line 1010, should also be typed in reverse video, as should the word \"light\" in lines 220 and 1010. PROGRAM EXPLANATION Lines 10-40: The keyboard is opened for input to get keys without requiring a RETURN. Various strings are initialised. See the instruction for special comments concerning P$ and G$. Lines 50-60: Title The hearts blink in and out because of the POKEs which change from upper-case to lower-case graphics mode and back (POKEs into 756). Lines 170-180: Initialise game The board is printed along with the initial heart configuration. Line 190-270: Main loop of game Gets player selection, checks for legal move, flashes appropriate group and complements hearts in that group. checks for winning or losing situations and repeats. CHR$(125) clears the text area. Lines 300-310: Advises of a losing condition. Lines 350-380: Acknowledges a win, small demonstration, asks if repeat wanted. The POKEs into 708 are another way to change colours (colour register 0). The POKEs into 656 and 657 align the cursor in the text area (row and column). The POKE into 76 clears the last key byte. Lines 400-450: Subroutine to print the board. The SETCOLOR 4.2,8 is necessary so the background hearts in graphics mode 2 don't show because they are the same colour as the background. The SETCOLOR 3,4,10 makes the light hearts especially light so they show up well on a black and white TV. CHR$(124) creates the vertical lines, completing squares. The POKE into 752 blanks the cursor. Lines 500-550: Subroutine to put hearts on the board. Flag F controls the configuration printed as described under variables. Lines 600-620: Subroutine which flashes hearts in a group determined by the number selected, N. The subroutine then complements these hearts. Lines 700-730: Delay subroutine used during instructions and in winning and losing routines. Delay determined by point where entered. Lines 750-770: Keyboard input subroutines which prompts and waits for any key to be pressed. Lines 800-850: A subroutine which operates on a group of positions determined by the number N. Hearts may be printed, erased or complemented depending on the flag F. Line 900: Subroutine to retrieve screen positions from string P$. Line 1000-1110: Instructions 34 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"special Educational from Computing We can all help if we care enough... Many people regard computers as some form of man-made monster, heralding the advent of an era where machines are the masters of men The emergence of microcomputers in the mid-seventies has helped to overcome this misguided view of how computers will affect our lives. Each month, Educational Computing shows the tremendous advances being made in the enhancement of computers, particularly micros, as teaching aids. In this annual issue, Learning to cope computers in special education, we look at the marvellous achievements of many very dedicated people working with disabled and mentally-handicapped children. Tremendous progress is being made in this area, brought about by a mixture of ingenuity, flexibility and determination on behalf of the manufacturers of specially-adapted products, writers of applications software, nurses and teachers putting ideas into practice and the children themselves. In our annual, we look at the latest developments in special education. You can read about the many fascinating applications of microelectronics in this field, what the people involved think and what the future holds in store. Most important of all, you can find if you can help — even in a small way.

"RUNS ON AN APPLE II TREASURE HUNT **Treasure\" is the word on the lips of the good people of Marpletownship, Rumours abound that the Marple Caves abound with treasures 20 of them and  all as close to priceless as only an adventure game can make them. Of course, there's a catch, for the rumours also cater for a dragon, a band of pirates without a scruple between them, elves, bats, magicians, invisible dogs and other even wierder beings. On top of this, whisper the talkative townfolk, the caves themselves are in poor condition, there are deep pits into which many have fallen and died. And in some places the roof leaves a lot to be desired. Can anyone be brave and foolish enough to wander unarmed into these caves in search of a sprinkling of rubies, pearls, gold coins, diamonds, emeralds, a silver bell, a gold watch, a golden harp, a magic wand and other riches? Yes! In fact, they'll be queuing up to roam around down there and you won't be able to talk them out of there until they have grabbed all 20 treasures. The first one to escape being eaten by a dragon, enchanted by a magician, or robbed by a pirate and who can find his way back to the cave entrance with all the treasures will find the good people of Marpletownship only too keen to offer him their goods (at a reasonable price, of course) and talk long and hard about many worthwhile investments. Lance Micklus has invented an enjoyable adventure (translated for the Apple by Murray Summers) which has a good line in throwaway humour. Key it in and try your hand at the best get-rich-quick campaign since daily paper bingo. BY MURRAY SUMMERS 110 und TERRY ROGERS Whene su u "

"RUNS ON A 40 COLUMN PET IN 8K i PRAGON DRUGGIN BY PAUL JAY Never in the history of Necromancy had there been such a task. Defeating a fiery dragon with nothing more than a hoary old spell for turning snow into sleeping tablets. When the fearsome and foul dragon, who we shall refer to henceforth as \"Horace\", came down from the mountains, the villagers feared the worse. Rightly as it turned out. For Horace immediately set to, devouring maidens, breathing fire, smoke and halitosis, putting up mortgage rates and generally behaving in the sort of way that would give football supporters a good name. All this action occurs off-screen and I did not program any of it into the game ... be thankful for small mercies! Horace's anti-social behaviour is a problem which cannot be tolerated, so the local wizard was called for and appraised of the situation and the need for urgent action. Wizards have often appeared in adventure-type games but none ever had to work under the same restrictions as our hero, Butch. All through wizard school, Butch would misbehave, preferring to smoke behind the apothecary labs than learn his frog-turning tables. So Butch left wizard school with only a C.S.E. pass in Magic Sleeping Pill from Snow transmuting generally considered a soft subject. Butch can only manage five pills anyway. They appear in the sky at the top of the screen and fall rapidly to the ground. You can direct them into Horace's mouth by pressing \"space\". Three is enough to put even a dragon to sleep. If less than three pills enter Horace's mouth, he will respond by burning Butch's head off a violent game perhaps, but then life's like that sometimes. 50 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"RUNS ON A TRS-80 ENTR BY ROBERT HALL Entrapment is a deceptively simple strategy game which can be seen as a struggle for living space. One of the best two-player games around, it requires fast reflexes, good control and the ability to think on the move and outwit your opponent. Skill determines the outcome, yet it can be played and enjoyed by a four-year-old, the controls are that easy to master and the game's objectives so obvious. The aim is to move a growing life-line into free space on the screen. That is space not takenup by your own \"tail\", your opponent's \"tail\" or the boundaries of the screen. As the screen gradually fills, so certain areas of it are cut off from one or both players. The winner is the player who can cut his opponent off with the least space to play with. And then just avoid mistakes until his opponent runs out of room and is forced to hit an existing line. Take care not to reverse direction, as this is judged as running back into your own \"tail\".

"ture Will you dare the deathmaze? EVERY adventure needs a few idiots (sorry, heroes) brave enough to test its terrors. So the computer must be able to decide the player's responses to given situations. Following the arrays which we set up in the last issue, we will now make our adventure program recognise and act on the player's response. Let us assume that this will be in the form of a verb followed by a noun. We will assign Ri$ to this and say it is \"TAKE KNIFE\": 300 FOR I = 1 TO LEN (R1$): REM set up scan of R1$ 310 IF MID$(R1$.1, 1) = \"\" THEN 340 : REM find position of space 320 NEXT : REM space not found 330 PRINT \"REPLY USING TWO WORDS\" : STOP : REM temp. error message 340 LET R2$ = LEFTs(R1$,I-1) : LET R3$ = RIGHTS(R1$.LEN(R1$) -1) We now have R2 = TAKE and R3$ = KNIFE, and must check to see if they are valid words and if so, find their numerical identities All that we need do is to uniquely identify each word and can achieve this by using (say) the first three letters of each word, to establish strings like: LET WI$ = \"DROTAKKILTUR ...\" : REM drop take kill turn LET W2$ = \"KNIFISCOWAXE.. .\" : REM knife fish cow axe we can identify our words so: 350 LET R4$ = LEFTs(R2$.3): LET R5$ = LEFTs(R3$,3) 360 LET C$ = W1$ : LET CC$ = R4$ : GOSUB 2000 Line 350 standardises the variable names for entry into: 2000 FOR I = I TO LEN(C$) 2010 IF MID$(C$.1,3) = CC$ THEN RETURN : REM found it 2020 NEXT : REM not found -try again 2030 LET I = 0 : RETURN : REM not there set I to zero On return from this subroutine if I = 0 the word is not valid and we can continue: 370 IF I = 0 THEN PRINT \"I CAN'T\"; R2$: \"SOMETHING\" : STOP take the contents by typing the appropriate instruction.

The pyramids have triangular bases (e.g. one on top, three on the next layer, six on the next and so on). It is noted that the number of layers in both the smallest and largest pyramids together is twice the number of layers in the other pyramid. Using all of these balls it is possible to construct three pyramids with square bases, so that each pyramid has a different number of layers and is also different from the number of Two bottles of champagne are up for grabs on this page every month.

"GRIPE OF THE MONTH foam to turn the board over onto. This allows for components of different depths to be soldered in at the same time. When it comes to chip holders I am bound to complain, not only about the kit builders but also to the suppliers. So many times have I seen holders raised off the board, if not at both ends, then at least one. This leads to increased stress and strain on the pins and, with the great number of times kit builders heavy hands get to them, eventual fracture. Besides this, it is often the case that holders are supplied which are not, in my view, suitable for the usual punishment. solder in all the components before the holders as they are all very close together and can be very fiddly. Tangerine have made the commendable decision to supply most of their expandable system in cost-saving kit versions as well as pre-assembled. If the other boards are of the same high standard as the Microtan 65 there should be no problems. Make sure, though, that you have made all the links on this board as directed. I forgot and it took me a while to figure out why I could not get it going. illet GRIPE of the month goes to all those makers who do not supply transistor pads with their kits. This would do away with all those blown transistors I have come across -especially in the ZX81 owing to excess heat when soldering. Although I have been critical of the ZX81 in the past I do have some good news for those of you with problems. It appears that Sinclair are prepared to repair free of charge, machines which have been opened or even tampered with, so long as this was not the reason for the fault. They also have a very good spare parts department which I have already made use of. I made the mistake of packing the ZX81 with the power supply, which indented and ruined the keyboard. Oh well, you live and learn. Now for a little kit building advice. Although, in some kits, the components come preformed ready for insertion you should always have a pair of pointednose pliers handy, if only to stop finger burns. Where there is a need to bend up components it should be done with the pliers between the component and the bend If you are not quite accurate at first and the component does not fit correctly, do not force it in. Try again by first squashing the bend flat. Do not attempt this too many times as the lead will eventually weaken and break. A drop of solder on the bend, once the component is in place will do as a bodge if this happens. Remember that the lead is only held onto the component by the moulding. Any undue force may break this contact which would leave you with an invisible open circuit. A helpful tip when \"building up\" the components in layers on the board is to use a piece of sticky tape to hold them in. The other way is to use a piece of BY KEITH MOTT Generally these are of the open, Molex type which are quite suitable for flow-solder, productionline assembly but not for kits. I prefer to see the totally encapsulated versions which seem to stand up better to the rigours of kit building. OPEN UP A TANGERINE Tangerine have a very good service department which accepts problems over the telephone and is very helpful. There is also a Tangerine User Group which aims to help the beginner, as well as the advanced owner, with his or her new machine. If a company is prepared to offer its products in kit form then it should also be prepared to answer problems from the public. Most do, but it may pay in the long run to find out the ones who do not and keep away from them. On the other hand, there may — as in the case of Tangerine be a user group to which you can turn, if in difficulty. One kit that uses this type of open socket extensively is the Tangerine Microtan 65. The board, however, is so well laid out that each one should go in with no trouble at all.

"CHRISTMAS I KORCHNOI GIVES HIS CHESS VOTE 8083 ESCAPE THE RAVENOUS GHOULS The world's No. 2 chess master, Viktor Korchnoi has put his name to an electronic chess game which is on show for the first time at the Earls Court Toy Trade Fair. The player who reached the final of the World Chess Tournament on the last two occasions has endorsed one of the newest chess games around. The game, the Westrak CC3, is a sophisticated electronic chess game which has several improvements on the first version of this series. There are now 25 standard random opening moves, you can alter your strategy of play or rectify mistakes by making use of a special facility, which allows you to have up to three full moves backwards and three full moves forward. The response time of the machine's moves have been cut. Giving a response, on skill level one, straight away, on level two, in 16 seconds, and up to 28 minutes on the top level. During the game the L.E.D.s light up to reveal the computer's thinking on its next move. You have an advantage over the computer because you can step in and stop the game at any time by using the halt key. One of the nicest things about the Westrak CC3 is its price. It will cost between the  and  markvery competitive. moves backwards and three to TOY TRENDS The British toy industry is quickly off the mark after Christmas, planning its new year at the toy and hobby fairs of January These shows are aimed at the trade and give manufacturers a chance to enlist distributor and retailer support for the toys and games which children will be clamouring for next Christmas. The computerised and electronic toys field is a competitive one and cloaked in secrecy but COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES is unwrapping a few of the toys early to show you what's in store. The hand-held games will continue to be popular in 1982, mirroring the best arcade games and a lot of emphasis is being placed on small electronic games which can be used to keep children amused while travelling. Following the cinema trend, the games industry is indulging in fantasy themes and these will start to take over from the present rash of space games. Chess and sophisticated logic games will be aimed at the adult gamesters and the computerised chess field promises to become especially competitive. Some of the toys mentioned below will be available in stores from January but in many cases, stocks will not reach the shops until the middle of the year at least. Our preview of the toy fair will give you an idea of how the toy and games industry is approaching the coming year and what to look out for when the time comes to fill the Christmas 1982 stocking AN ALIEN IN Keep those ghouls at bay when they chase you through a difficult maze, eager to devour you at the first chance. Dart off down the tunnels of a complex maze, eating up the dots covering the path as you go. PacMan 2 is a new hand-held toy on show for the first time at Earls Court British Toy and Hobby Fair. Billed as a \"third generation\" electronic toy it is one of the first hand-held versions of the popular arcade game Puckman. Pac Man 2 is rectangular in shape with an oblong L.C.D. screen on the uppermost face of the toy. It's for either one or two players, the controls for each being at the two ends of the screen. The player controls the eater usually referred to as the pacman or munchman by using the four directional keys so that you can move him up, down or to the left and right. You have to keep concentrating to spot the whereabouts of the ghosts and make sure you don't get your pacman locked in a dead-end section of the maze, or surrounded inescapably by his pursuers. In the four corners of the screen are four energy posts which enable the pacman to eat his pursuers and score bonus points. An added feature of Pac Man 2 which sticks as truly as possible to the arcade version, are the two tunnels on each side of the maze. Pac Man 2 is made by Entex but distributed by Leicestershire based A.A. Hales. It will be in the shops later in the year selling for about  but could be as much as  depending on the shop manager's discretion. The heavens are filled with fastflying alien creatures and enemy saucers raining relentlessly down on your home base in the Galaxy 10,000 hand-held electronic game. Your task is to leap to the defence of your people. Specially selected for the job it is up to you to shoot down the race against you. With a swift deftness of hand you must move the firing base across the L.C.D. screen to avoid the laser shots from the attacking force. Due out in the shops in the next couple of months Galaxy 10,000 carries a price tag of E28.95. U.K. distributors Computer Games claims that this new toy will give hours of compelling entertainment, justifying the price. 72 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"By TED BALL PRACTICAL PRACTICAL PRACTICAL ET PROGRAMMING BY TED BALL GET TO KNOW YOUR BUGS BUGS WITH WRONG ANSWERS There is a limit to how much anyone can enjoy tracking down the programming errors that inhabit newly keyed-in creations. It is possible to write programs that run correctly the first time, but except for the shortest and simplest programs there are nearly always some errors. Locating and correcting errors can be a time consuming process and is best approached systematically. Copying and typing errors are easy to make, and much time and trouble can be saved by carefully checking the program listing on the screen (or hard copy if you have a printer) against the source from which it was copied. Many copying errors will produce an error message when the program is run, but this is not an infallible means of finding all such errors. A large and complex program may include sections which are rarely executed and typing mistakes in these sections may not show up until the program has been in use for some time. There are some common errors in copying that quite often do not lead to the system producing an error message but cause the program to give the wrong answers. These errors include the omission of a line, or a statement in a multi-statement line, and mistakes in copying variable names. Confusion between the numerals 0, 1, 2 and the letters O, I, Z is particularly common, and sometimes occurs in books and magazines when a program has been typeset instead of reproduced photographically from a printout. A simple example is LET X = BI + AI instead of LET X = Bl + Al. Basic will find nothing wrong with this, but the program will not give the right answer. Another type of error which produces the wrong answers without giving an error message is due to misunderstanding the way your system evaluates complex expressions. For example, how are: LET X = A/B*C LET Y = A/B/C LET Z = A*B**C evaluated? If you are not sure how the computer will treat an expression you can write a short program to test it. However, it is safer to insert brackets, although they may be unnecessary, or to break up the expression into a series of simpler expressions, to ensure that it is evaluated in the way you intended. This is particularly advisable if the program is to be used by other people or transferred to a different machine. may not be immediately obvious; the error message will give the line number where program execution stopped but the ultimate cause of the error may be in a completely different part of the program If you have execution errors or wrong answers it is best to review the whole program, paying particular attention to the initialisation of variables and the destination of GOTO statements. Most versions of Basic initialise variables and array elements to zero, and it is possible for a section of a program to work correctly the first time around but give the wrong answer later on. For example: 1000 FOR I = 1 TON 1010 LET S = S + A(I) 1020 NEXT I 1030 RETURN If the program has not previously used the variable S this subroutine will return with S equal to the sum of A(1) to A(N) but afterwards it will start with the value left in S and add on to this. You should also look for the converse of this type of error, where initialisation is performed correctly at the beginning but is repeated at a later stage when it is not required. You also need to be careful with the condition in IF... THEN... statements. It is usually straightforward to decide whether to have; IF A <B rather than IF A <= B, but in more complicated cases, where A and B are expressions, or where there is a sequence of IF ... THEN ... statements it can be difficult to get it right. Any complicated tests should be worked out carefully when designing the program and if the resulting code does not work properly it is usually quicker to start again. EXECUTING BUGS Errors which cause program execution to stop, include function arguments and array indices out of bounds (e.g. attempting to divide by zero, or access the 101st element of an array which has been dimensioned to 100). Execution errors may be due to mistakes of the kind discussed above, but more often they are caused by errors in the program logic, particularly where the programmer has neglected to allow for special cases. The cause of this type of error A BUG IN YOUR ARITHMETIC The accuracy of the arithmetic performed by Basic is a frequent source of bugs and it is difficult to find why a program is going wrong unless you know the reason for the inaccuracy. Although numbers are entered in 74 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"decimal, Basic converts them to binary for internal storage and calculation and converts back from binary to decimal to print out the answers. Very few decimal fractions can be converted exactly to a binary fraction and two binary fractions which, in the computer's internal representation, differ by a very small amount, may print out as exactly the same decimal number. If your program is going wrong on the statement IF A = 0 THEN... you may find that when you insert the statement PRINT \"A = \": A immediately before this test that the machine gives A = 0. However, if you ask the machine to print A*(10**10) you will probably get a non-zero answer. These errors in conversion between binary and decimal can produce some very odd results. For example, on the ZX81 the command PRINT .25 gives the answer 0, while PRINT * .25 gives 1.1641532E-10. The ZX81 calculates by division and gets the answer exactly right, but when converting .25 into binary the result comes out 1/2**33 short of the exact answer, and by some peculiarity in the subtraction routine, does not give consistent results. There is usually no problem with integer calculations, but with decimal calculations you cannot rely on the computer producing exactly the same answer you would get by doing it with pencil and paper. You should allow for small errors by testing for two numbers being sufficiently close, rather than testing for equality. For example, instead of IF A=B THEN... you should put something like IF ABS(A-B) 1B5 THEN... Decimal/binary conversion errors can also cause problems in FOR... NEXT loops with a fractional step. The two following programs demonstrate what can happen: 10 LET X = 0 20 FOR I = 0 TO 10 STEP 0.01 30 PRINT I, X 40 LET X = X + 1 50 NEXT I 10 LET X = 0 20 FOR I = 0 TO 100 STEP 0.1 30 PRINT, I, X 40 LET X = X + 1 50 NEXT I I tested these on two different machines and found that in the first case the last values printed were 9.99013, 999, and 9.9900002, 999, while in the second case the last values printed were 99.9991 1000 and 99.99996, 1000. The reason the loop body is performed a different number of times in the two cases lies in the way Basic executes the NEXT statement. When NEXT I is encountered Basic adds the step to I to get the new value of I and compares this to the upper limit. If the new value of I is less than or equal to the upper limit the loop body is performed again; Basic will not exit the loop until the new value of I is greater than the upper limit. When conversion or rounding errors make the value of I a little greater than it should be, Basic may exit the loop prematurely. A useful method for tracing bugs is to insert extra PRINT statements into the program, to give the values of variables at points where you suspect the program is going wrong. In many cases this will show immediately why the program is going wrong. Where the bug is particularly obscure you may have to use this method to trace the operation of the entire program. There are debugging packages available for some microcomputers, for example the Pet Toolkit, which can be very useful for debugging large programs. The routines available include TRACE, which displays the line number currently being executed, and DUMP, which prints out the values of selected variables every time they are used. FLUSH THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM System bugs often receive little publicity. There is an arithmetic bug in the ZX81 which results in SQR (.25) being printed as 1.3591409 (although SQR (1/4) comes out correctly). I have seen this mentioned in only three magazines, one of them being a specialist ZX80/81 publication. If you have a ZX8l with this bug you can obtain a corrected ROM by writing to Sinclair Research. Another recently discovered bug occurs in many versions of Microsoft Basic, resulting in the incorrect handling of string assignments of the form LET AS = A + BS + CS when there is very little free memory avail able.

"SPRM IN THE sleazy streets of Lost Vagueness the traveller is subjected to the worst in vice and filth in the form of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. The nearest thing to wizardry in this adventure game is a magic mushroom which sends your vision haywire and turns your brain into a psychedelic haze of pretty colours. Softporn Adventure is delightfully seamy in theme throughout but humorously entertaining too. The purpose of the game is to find and seduce three women. It was like a dream. I awoke to find myself in the year 2000 A.D. in a wicked world in which the skies had turned green from plutonium pollution. I opted to go on holiday in a notorious gambling town where the only things people are interested in are drink, women and money. This is only a game though and you don't get \"hands-on\" experience yourself. You operate a puppet which becomes your eyes and ears. With $1,000 in my pocket I set off on my quest for debauchery, but $1,000 is not a lot when you want to fling it round on drinks, gambling and sex. In a dimly-lit, ill-furnished bar, I came across my first barrier to \"sex-cess\". A closed curtain was in the way and only after guessing the password could I walk through the curtain to discover what fruits lay behind. Tamely I tried classic words like \"abracadabra\". When that got me nowhere I ventured on to more imaginative words like \"sex\", \"booze\", \"women\", \"perversion\" (I won't ruin it by telling you what the password actually was). After exhausting a list as long as my arm, frustration had set in and I needed to feel a shot of whisky coursing through my veins. But $100 a go... oh it's a sign of the times. I took a break to gather my thoughts, and then started investigating the area. So far the only human I had crossed paths with was the degenerate barman, never mind a lady of easy virtue. The whisky had gone straight to my bladder so I took a trip to the bathroom. Filth lay there too. The toilet hadn't been flushed for months. The computer was riah it stank. On the walls were scrawled feet of seedy graffiti, like: \"Computer freaks peek before they poke\". The key to the game is the amount of money you have on you. It's vital for bribing people (like the pimp in the bar's backroom who wants $2,000 before you can go upstairs to investigate further), entry to the disco (a perfect place to pick up a girl). buying drinks and betting in the casino. If you run out of money, the chances are that you will come unstuck and be unable to proceed. The way to build up your cash supply is to try your hand in the casino. You can either play on the slot machines or at blackjack but the bets are fixed at $100 a throw so it's too easy to whittle away your cash. Very easy for me anyway that's where I made my first mistake. I lost all my $1,000 on blackjack but being an optimist I carried on playing. Luck was on my side, or so I thought at first, and I found a passcard which got me into the disco. Girls galore were milling around daubed in \"Californian sun tans\" and little else. Gambling is thirsty work so I focused on the bar this is an expensive joint, $100 for a bottle of wine. At last I'd found a girl, and after a quick boogie with a blonde on the dance floor I moved in and kissed her. The computer bleeped loudly and up on the screen flashed \"Oh, don't do that, it gets me excited.\" She rebuffed my amorous advances but not to be deterred, I stumbled back into the casino and into the hotel lobby where a voluptuous blonde sat invitingly behind the desk. No luck with her either, she was too busy working despite the place being devoid of people. I blundered into a garden where I found a tasty looking mushroom, so feeling a bit peckish I ate it, I've heard that mushrooms have magic powers but this one beamed me into another place still penniless. There are three alternatives if you run out of money. Go to Hell and the game ends. Be teleported back to life unharmed. Stay and try again in the game, though without any money it is pointless. The aims and format of the game are reminiscent of most adventures but the frustrations perhaps a little more intense. There is no graphical picture on the screen, just written descriptions of what confronts the player. There is a nice line in cheeky replies to unlikely. or sometimes, downright unsocial requests. On kissing a girl it issued a series of frantic bleeps and stars filled the screen if a seduction had taken place it would probably have exploded! But obviously my sex counted against me and I found no women willing to respond to my charms. I was disappointed not to successfully seduce any women, mainly because I was intrigued (and still am) to find out just how the computer would react. If any of you know the truth I am waiting eagerly to hear it. UK suppliers of Softporn are runs on a 48K Apple and costs .95 far cheaper than a real night in \"Sin City\". BY ELSPETH JOINER "

"BY DAVID ANNAL WHEN you are offered a \"microchip orchestra\" or an \"instant musician\" for  it is easy to shrug off the claims as pure advertising jargon. In the first of a series of occasional reviews on sound equip ment, books and software pack ages, I am investigating these claims, made by the manufacturers of the VL-Tone minisynthesiser. What do you get for your money? I had better admit that I have spent quite some time playing with and on Casio's VL-Tone and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. The instrument is a monophonic synthesiser, playing one note at a time but incorporating in the package a simple rhythm generator which, if required, will accompany the tune with a suitable beat generated on \"bongos\" and \"brushes\". There are 10 different rhythms available, varying from a simple march to a complicated bossanova. The whole instrument measures 11din 3in X lin and includes a speaker and internal batteries. An external power pack is available for running the unit from the mains. The battogether but space is sacrificed for compactness, and compact it is! The keyboard covers a range of more than two octaves and an octave switch is provided which lowers or raises the pitch of the keyboard by an additional octave. A \"voice\" switch causes the sound produced to mimic one of five in-built instrumental types. These are: piano, violin, flute, guitar and fantasy. The actual sounds made are far from the possibilities of a full-blown synthesiser but they are sufficiently life-like to deserve their titles -just! The fantasy sound has a pleasant \"ring\" to it, together with vibrato and a long decay after the key has been released. Each note on the keyboard is numbered and, when played, this note number is shown on the L.C.D. display. Controls are provided to adjust the overall vol ume and also the balance between the percussion effect and the chosen voice. So it is possible to play a tune on a small keyboard instrument which sounds almost like the real thing and which can be accompanied by an appropriate percussion rhythm. Inside the VL-Tone there is a memory which can remember up to 100 notes. If the function from a sheet of music or copies them from one of the easy entry tunes listed in the music book which accompanies the instrument. Having entered the complete piece, the music which has been stored is then played back using the one-key play facility. Each time this key is pressed, the next note of the remembered tune is produced. It can now be played to sound right by ear and it will be re-remembered in its new form! The rhythm section can be used to keep you in time but will not be remembered as well. The whole tune can now be played through by one press on the \"auto play\" button. Another excellent facility is provided on the VL-Tone, the ability to set up your own individual \"voice\". This remarkable instrument can be programmed to remember your @wn unique envelope pattern. Millions of combinations are possible! The parameters which can be controlled are: wave type, attack time, decay time, sustain level, sustain time, release time, vibrato and tremulo. The setting combination of those you like, should be noted down before erasing them. The instrument will remember the last programmed envelope and this will be stored at power off. Will it do anything else? Well it will tune to a concert pitch for playing with other instruments, it has an output jack which enables it to be connected to an external amplifier, such as that described last month (or an even more powerful one), it can play your programmed tune four times in a row if requested, it comes complete with a comprehensive tune book and it also contains its own in-built demonstration tune, called \"German Folk Song\". Oh, and I almost forgot, you can use the VL-Tone as an eightfigure L.C.D. calculator to perform all the usual arithmetic, including square roots and percentages with the use of up to four constants and a full memory recall facility! 5 36 teries last for quite a long time, however, and an auto shut down is provided which conserves them by turning the instrument off if it is left for more than six minutes without being asked to do something The \"keys\" are, in reality, small black or white buttons, as appropriate, but they operate very easily and precisely and fast trills are possible. An experienced musician might find that they are too close switch is set to record and a tune is played, this tune will be stored in memory and can be recalled at will. The voice used, and the tempo of playback, can be varied. Percussion can be used, if required and the notes entered need not be in \"rhythm\" or of the correct duration — they can be altered afterwards. This means that an inexperienced musician can enter notes in his own time as he works out what they are "


"CAN YOU SAVE MIDDLE EARTH BY RESCUING FRODO FROM SHELOB'S LAIR...? LORD OF THE RINGS DO NOT CONFUSE WITH THE NON-GRAPHIC ADVENTURES! Lord of the Rings is an entirely new type of game, combining a little of the principle of the 'Adventure' type of game, using words as spells, etc; a little of the 'Quest' principle of moving around the 'rooms'; plus actual ing the various levels, walls, doors, nasties and yourself, Frodo. The appeal of the game is that it combines skill and chance, so that though developing strategies are important, there is no guarantee that having learnt a strategy it will work twice! The game is an adaption of Tolkien's book 'The Lord of the Rings', spell words actually being taken from the book as are the characters. Tolkien enthusiasts will not need convincing of the necessity of saving Middle Earth by escaping from Shelob's Lair; those without this background knowledge will have to play a few games before they become addicted! In your quest to cast the ring into the Crack of Doom to destroy its evil power you will travel a long and dangerous road. The Lair is on many levels, so you must find the stairs, and beware of the clever nasties, monsters and dwarves which can detect you from a distance and rush for your gold, which you need to bribe. There are secret tunnels, monster's tombs and the like. During your travels you can meet Shelob herself, a Fiery Balrog, Lord of the Nazgul, a Hideous Hill-Troll Chief, a Numakil from the Far Harrad, Hissing Gollum, a Howling Warg, a Barrow-Wight and all those characters of spell words. The game, though easy to actually play is complicated in itself with many and varied happenings along the way. But its advantage is that all the time you can see and manipulate yourself in eight different directions. Peter and Margaret Hutt have developed and produced a most absorbing, and certainly addictive, game... .50 Programs are for the Tandy TRS 80 and Video Genie. All prices are VAT paid and postage free.

"GO FOR YOUR MISSILE LAUNCHER Shooting a space invader out of the sky is not the simple task it might seem. Having shown how to draw the alien horrors and make them move, SOME inventive use of graphics should provide you with a suitably stylish missile launcher at the bottom of your space invaders' screen but now you will need something to fire at the \"meanies. A missile can be launched by pressing any key if the GET statement is used. The movement of the missile across the screen is generated by using a simple loop. The length of the delay determines the speed at which the missile moves. A Basic program, written for the Pet, to fire a missile up the screen in the way described is: 10 PRINT \"CLS 20 POKE 33747,81: POKE 33707,93 30 Q = 33667 40 GET CS: IF CS=\"\" THEN 40 50 FOR I = 1 TO 23 60 POKE Q. 46 70 FOR J = 1 TO 20: NEXT 80 POKE Q. 32 90 Q = Q 40 100 NEXT I 110 GOTO 30 in my first two columns, it is now time to finish them off and so complete the fundamentals of the space invader game. While most of the arcade space invader games contain the same 6502 microprocessor as the Pet, Apple and other microcomputers, their programs are written in machine code, rather than Basic, for reasons of speed. However, the methods contained in the programs are the same whatever language they are written in, and by presenting programs in Basic the methods can be understood relatively easily. The program fragments presented show in turn, how to fire and display a missile, how to detect whether the missile has hit a target and how to combine these to fire at a moving target. The methods and ideas behind the programs can be modified and adapted for much more sophisticated programs. BY GARRY MARSHALL There is plenty of scope for producing imaginative explosion effects. A slight modification to the previous loop gives the basis of a program for shooting missiles at a moving target. The loop is: PLOT MISSILE MOVE TARGET The way to see if the missile has hit a target is to look ahead of the missile to see if anything is in the way. On the video screen, it is reasonable to assume that if the next missile position contains anything other than a space then the missile has hit a target and an explosion should occur! The previous loop can be modified to give this: PLOT MISSILE BLANK OUT MISSILE CALCULATE NEXT POSITION ANYTHING NO THERE? DELAY A program for this is: 10 POKE 33747, 81 : POKE 33707, 93 20 Q = 33667 40 GET CS: IF CS = \"\" THEN 40 50 FOR I = 1 TO 23 60 POKE Q, 46 70 FOR J = 1 TO 20: NEXT 80 POKE Q, 32 90 Q = Q 40 100 IF PEEK (Q) < > 32 THEN 200 110 NEXT I 120 GOTO 20 200 POKE Q. 160 210 POKEQ 40, 160 : POKEQ + 1, 160 220 POKEQ + 40, 160 : POKEQ 1, 160 230 POKEQ 40, 124: POKEQ + 1, 108 240 POKEQ + 40, 123 : POKEQ 1, 126 250 GOTO 210 This program gives the explosion effect generated by lines 200 to 250 if the missile hits any non-space character left on the screen when the program is run. YES BLANK OUT MISSILE CALCULATE NEXT POSITION ANYTHING NO THERE? CREATE EXPLOSION The previous program can be modified to realise this. An instruction to clear the screen should be added to the beginning. At line 30 a call to a subroutine to plot the target should be included, and line 70 replaced by a call to a subroutine that moves the target. YES CREATE EXPLOSION "


"DOWN IN BASIC LOVIT BY MOIRA NORRIE THE ART OF PRINTING PATTERNS REMEMBER TO INCLUDE COMMENTS Last month, I left you this program: 10 FOR I = 1 TO 2 20 FOR J = 1 TO 4 30 PRINT \"XXXX XXXX\" 40 NEXT J 50 FOR K = 1 TO 4 60 PRINT\" XXXX XXXX\" 70 NEXT K 80 NEXT I 90 END If you were able to RUN this program, you would have had the following pattern printed. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX There are two techniques that can be used to make programs easier to read and, therefore, easier to understand. These are:the use of comments in your programs, and indenting chosen lines of your program. To illustrate these techniques, I will rewrite a previous program. 10 REM PROGRAM TO SUM 5 PAIRS OF NUMBERS 20 REM FOR I = 1 TO 5 REM INPUT A PAIR OF NUMBERS INPUT A,B REM PRINT THE SUM OF THE PAIR PRINT A+B 80 NEXT I 90 END Comments can be inserted by the use of REM statements. \"REM\" indicates to the computer that the rest of the line is comment. By including extra spaces, lines can be indented to improve the lay-out of a program. In particular, this can be used to clearly show the beginning and end of a loop. Unfortunately, although it is good programming practice to use these techniques, they are often omitted in programs for microcomputers. The amount of space for storing programs is often very small and therefore comments are omitted to keep the size of a program to a minimum. However, unless the size of a program is critical, you should include comments as they are helpful to the programmer and others who will use the program XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 8 38 388 THE KEY TO GOOD GRAPHICS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To make it easier for you to understand how the pattern is produced, I could describe the program as follows: repeat 2 times repeat 4 times print first line of pattern end repeat repeat 4 times print second line of pattern end repeat end repeat You can see how all sorts of patterns could be developed by printing the appropriate strings of characters blanks and non-blanks — within loops. By extending the above program, you could print a representa tion of a chessboard. With careful planning (and a good imagination), you can use this simple technique to \"draw\" anything from a spaceship to a personal portrait. With an ordinary keyboard (similar to a typewriter keyboard), the quality of the pictures you can produce will be very limited. For this reason, many of the microcomputers have keyboards with special \"graphic keys\". These keys produce characters such as: The use of these special characters will allow the programmer to selectively \"shade\" areas of the screen. As a result, the quality and range of pictures 84 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"2009 FORI:1 that can be printed will be much greater You now have sufficient knowledge of Basic to enable you to write programs to produce these pictures it is simply a matter of experimenting with combinations of these graphic characters until you achieve the desired result! Some microcomputer keyboards also have keys for the characters: assumed to be a step-size of 1. In the above example, \"X\" will take the values 2, 4, 6, 8, ... 20 and the loop will be repeated 10 times. It is also possible to have a negative step-size. Clearly, this means that the initial value of the variable must be greater than the final value. 30 FOR Y = 5 TO 1 STEP-1 NEXT I CALCULATION 5 This is obviously useful for writing programs to play card games. SOME MORE ABOUT LOOPS In this way, \"T\" will take the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, in that order, and it is therefore a count of the number of times round the loop. My reason for explaining in detail the operation of the FOR and NEXT statements is that I now want to introduce loops of the form 40 For X = 2 TO 20 STEP 2 I have looked at programs with loops created by a matching pair of statements of the form: 40 FOR I = 1 TO 5 60 NEXT Y In this case, \"Y\" will take the values 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1, in that order. These types of FOR statement are useful when you are required to repeat a calculation for a pre-determined set of values. The FOR and NEXT statements can be used in this way to actually generate the required set of values. For example assume you want to print a table of squares of all even numbers in the range 2-20. I have already given an example of a FOR statement that will generate the required set of even numbers. The complete program would be: 10 REM PROGRAM TO PRINT TABLE OF SQUARES 20 REM OF EVEN NUMBERS IN THE RANGE 2-20 30 REM FOR X = 2 TO 20 STEP 2 50 PRINT X, X*X NEXT X 70 END 80 NEXT I The effect of this pair of statements is to cause the set of statements \"bracketed\" by them to be repeated five times. The variable \"I\" acts as a count variable. Initially, \"I\" is given the value 1. Each time the instruction \"NEXT I\" is reached, the value of \"T\" is increased by 1 and the loop is repeated. This process continues until the new value of \"T\" would exceed the upper limit of 5. At this point, the computer stops looping and proceeds with the program. 70 NEXT X The format of the NEXT statement remains the same, but there are two important changes to the FOR statement. Firstly, the initial value of the variable is a value other than 1 in this case the initial value will be 2. Secondly, a \"step-size\" of 2 has been specified. Each time the instruction \"NEXT X\" is reached, the value of \"X\" will be increased by 2. In general, if no \"step-size\" is specified in the FOR statement, then it is 40 60 NEXT ISSUE GIVE US A CHANCE Most games involve an element of chance. In order that you may write programs to play games, you must have some way of introducing the concept of chance, or luck, in your program. Next month, I will show you how this can be done using the Basic function \"RND\". I will also introduce the \"IF statement. This statement can be used to select alternative sections of your program depending upon, for example the data typed in when the program is RUN. NEXT ISSUE \"MPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 85 "
