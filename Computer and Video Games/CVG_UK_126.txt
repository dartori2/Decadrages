The yellow-haired peril has won a trip round the world courtesy of Krusty Cereal Products and has the chance to earn his fame and fortune with a live appearance on the Itchy and Scratchy show. Itchy and Scratchy are Bart's heroes and this is a chance he can't afford to lose. Unfortunately Mr Burns, the boss of the local nuclear power plant, has other ideas. He and his assistant Smithers, have arranged to have Bart's journey interrupted by members of the Burns clan around the globe. These include an abominable snowman version, a Chinese kung Fu master version and of course, Mr Burns himself! The action is mostly platform based, but there's a fair bit of puzzle soving thrown in. Best of all though, is the incredible skateboard sequence where you get the chance to ride down a hill at breakneck pace avoiding obstacles! The game is due out in a few months courtesy of Acclaim, so rest assurd we'll bring you more news the second it arrives! CHEESE LAVOUR WHAT THE OCTA HELL IS THIS?

For a start, it will have a new version of the Workbench operating system, but more importantly, a built in TV modulator no more stupid boxes sticking out of your Amiga! As far as appearance goes, the new machine will be a lot smaller and more compact and rumour has it that the numerical keypad on the right of the machine will be removed and the machine trimmed and smartened up, with a hard drive version expected to be launched soon after.

"REVIEW SUPER NES BY ACCLAIM  It's the gameshow to end them all. Forget Leslie Crowther and The Price Is Right, this is big time. The biggest social class in the world is the TV addict mindless vegetables with an insatiable desire for game shows, couch potatoes with an increasing lust for ever more extreme television. Violence is the name of the game and the masses just love it. In the ratings war that ensues, TV companies come up with ever more shocking themes for their shows. When the biggest TV corporation throws caution to the wind and comes up with Smash TV, the war is over and the audience is won. Smash TV is a smash. The TV show sees either one or two competitors in a fight for their lives, with cash and goodie prizes for the victorious. All the losers get is dead. And forgotten. odg39080 DEE75450 OCSOCSProbably the shoot 'em up of the Nineties, Smash TV caused real waves when it turned up in the arcades. Smart graphics, great sound and oodles of violence brought the Robotron legend to a whole new generation. This conversion was eagerly awaited and there as tension in the air when we plugged in the cart and discovered it was near enough arcade perfect! The game relies on one thing speed and this version has more of that than most people can cope with! The sheer number of baddies on screen will have you filling your pants with mortal | dread as they head towards you, guns | blazing. Gameplay is really simple, but it works a treat: just blast everything and | stay alive! Graphically the game is excellent: nice backdrops, brilliant animation and colourful sprites all round while the end of level baddies are huge and very impressive. Music is racy and driving, but the sound deserves some sort of medal. Sampled explosions shake your monitor and there's speech ahov as the game show host alves his commentary. Along with Mario and Super Ghouls and Ghosts, this is an essential purchase for Super Nintendo owners. FRANK O'CONNOR LOVELY, MARVELLOUS, SMASHIN'.. Smash TV is nothing like the game shows we know and loathe. Oh no. There's no throwing darts, no general knowledge and no word puzzles. This is death and violence from start to finish. Armed initially with machine guns, the contestants are thrown into a maze of arenas and the game show host throws every I 0000 chine guns and electrified robots are just a few of the psychotic killers that await our heroes. All they have to do is shoot the baddies and live as long as they can. Cash prizes, holidays, cars and smart luggage sets can be won provided the boys can survive long enough to enjoy them. Help comes along every now and then in the form of extra weapons which hot up the carnage for a short period of time. If you get far enough, you'll meet some of the show's larger celebrities and could even find yourself in the Smash TV hall of fame. In the words of (the commentator himself: \"Good luck...you'll need it!\" SONGSvar 020 020 "


"REVIEW USE444 KEEP OUT OF THE BLACK Remember, the mines are just as dangerous as the big guy! As with all good game shows, the object of Smash TV is sheer, unadulterated greed. Every now and then a big pile of money appears or it could be travel vouchers, or luggage, or even a car. Your score rises with every object you collect, but good players will soon realise that this stuff is even more valuable at the end of a section. All your stuff gets totted up by the computer after the defeat of a boss and you receive a massive bonus. If you're skill and groovy enough to reach the end of the game though, you get a bonus for every single item collected! Scores amassed in this fashion can get quite unfeasThis map lets you know where points are! ibly huge, and it's a laugh to watch your score pile up while your sad mate's cash pile is left way behind! DOODOO Smash TV was an arcade blast and a half, and I never really expected the home console versions to come up to the mark but Acclaim have done themselves proud and turned in a conversion which almost tops the coin-op for sheer speed and excitement! All the best features of everyone's favourite pocket change guzzler have been faithfully captured, right down to crystal clear sampled speech, grunts, groans and yells! The sheer number of sprites the Super Nintendo manages to cram on screen is truly awesome and sometimes you don't ever think the onslaught is going to end! There's a real sense of urgency about the game you'll find yourself hanging on until the bitter end when your boy gives up with a groan and finally sinkys into the dust as the commentator burbles on. The NES version was the best game of its type on that machine, and Acclaim have done it again on the Super Nintendo to provide the most awesome home arcade blaster yet seen. If you own a Super Nintendo and you like your action fast and furious, you'd have to be a dribbling loony to pass up Smash TV. Buy this cart and tell all your jealous mates you've got the arcade machine in your bedroom, because that's basically what this is. Buy it! TIM BOONE A MILLION WAYS TO WIN! The first thing you'll notice when you're playing Smash TV is the sheer number of sprites on screen at once. Surely the Super Nintendo should slow down when there are a lot of sprites on screen. Well, it does if you're a lazy programmer and you use the hardware alone. Not here though! The Super Nintendo is supposedly dead slow and as far as clock speed goes, but the main processor does all it's maths in hardware to make up and clever coding such as that used in this game makes Super Nintendo sprites zoom about like nobody's business. Smash TV is superfast and features squillions of sprites on screen at once it's a fine feat which bodes well for the future of Super Nintendo gaming as a whole. Kill that fat bloke, he's more than just a pretty face you know! LISTEN TO TONY.. The extra weapons in Smash TV are not only useful, they're essential. They appear in the arena from time to time, but you only have a few seconds to pick them up before they vanish. The goodies on offer include spreading machine gun fire, gre. nades, rockets, swirling razor blades and a very rare bombswhich only appear on screens with end of level baddies present. The bosses will not even wince when faced with ordinary machine gun fire and you can only destroy them with a special OH DEAR, LADS... weapon. Speed ups and shields can also be found and make life a bit easier for the Smash TV contestant, but at the end of The best thing about Super Ninthe day it's instincts and reactions that really count! tendo Smash TV is the brilliant control method. The SNES conDE7270 Aargh! Totally fried! trol pad has four fire buttons and these are used as a second direction pad. You simply press the top button to fire up, the bottom to fire down and so on. Obviously you use combinations of these buttons to fire diagonally. It seems a bit weird at first, but once you get the hang of it control of the characters becomes a dream. This mimics the control method of the coin-op perfectly and arcade fans will flip when they try it! LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU WOULD 'A WON... The plot of Smash TV sounds a by armed killers. The movie of bit familiar, and so it should. The course was totally different and it idea of a violent futuristic games was directed by Paul Michael how has been around since the Glasier out of Starsky and classic seventies movie Roller Hutch and a lot of the CVG boys ball. The theme was taken to the thought it was crap. The most noextreme a little more recently in torious of the future game show the Arnie smash hit, the Run themes was the movie Death ning Man, which in turn was Race 2000, which featured a car based very loosely on a Stephen race in which you score points by King book about a man who's knocking down pedestrians, sent into a city and hunted down which is not very wise.

"SH TO Smas on the other tainly pect contr but it one both move Tryin brain pays shoo forty RIKEY! Not only does the world's greatest games mag scoop the mega-hot Smash TV for an Exclusive Review, but here we go with a CVG special on the history of this fabby coin-op. FRANK O'CONNOR's itching to tell you all about it, so here he One of Gary Ward's spiffy cover roughs! is... MOW'EM DOWN The history of Smash TV is a long and colourful one. Williams started the whole thing with a coin-op called Robotron 2084, a game which wreaked havoc in the arcades. Apart from the clas sic Defender which, incidentally, was written by the same bloke! it was the only game that was really, really difficult. The control method was also a novelty two joysticks side by side, one for moving the character and one for firing in any of eight di rections. The screen basically filled up with hazards and baddies and the object of the exercise was to save humanoid hostages you simply walked over them and gained bonus points! Robotron featured apparently intelligent baddies who followed you around or even tried to cut you off. In fact they were as thick as mince, but that didn't really matter. The game was tricky on the first level, but once you reached level ten, things just got stupidly difficult DDE 20 AN OCEAN OF CONVERSIONS 6099 AMIGA NES NES Ocean hit the spot early in the last year with their rollocking conversions on the 8 and 16-bit micros, all programmed by Probe. The 8-bit versions, surprisingly, are better in many ways than their 16-bit cousins. The control system again became an issue, with twin joysticks being an option on all versions. The graphics on the ST and Amiga versions were a bit ropey, but good programming saved the day and Ocean did a fine job across all formats. Best ofthe bunch? The Amstrad and Spectrum versions, curiously enough, which stretched their host machines to their limits! Basically, this means just about anyone can enjoy blowing everything to bits, which is just as well really... 10003040 AMIGA NES AMIGA "


"PREVIEW BLOODY HELL! Not only does CVG grab the Super Nintendo Exclusive and tell you all about the game, we've gone and scooped everyone yet again to tell you all about the sequel to the arcade game and it's not even out yet! SHOOT 'EM TO BITS Smash TV is currently available on the Nintedo NES and it's another corking conversion, certainly as good as you could expect from an 8-bit machine. The control method is a little kooky, but it seems to work quite well. In one player mode, you can use both joypads, obviously one for movement and one for firing. Trying to figure it out causes brain leakage at first, but practice pays off and it's among the best shooters on the NES and worth forty quid of anyone's money. BNN fter The War DE 1999, Reporters Swarmed Into The War Zone HOTA DOTCOD) TOTALLY AWESOME! Total Carnage is the name of the follow-up to the phenomenally successful Smash TV, and it should be blasting its way into an arcade near you pretty flippin' soon! As you can see from these scrummy screenshots, the game is looking totally amazing, and seems to have taken all the best bits from the firt game and improved on them! Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem are your main men. They don't just sit about and twiddle their thumbs and drink exotic tea when the going gets tough. Oh no. They saddle up with some serious hardware, get going and kick ass on a grand scale! BLOWEM AWAY The game produced a whole new breed of arcade gamer, something akin to the movie \"Tommy\". They couldn't possibly see what was going on in the frenzied baddie infested screen, but they still survived and kept on racking up points. The extreme violence involved often made their eyes glaze over and they would drool and slobber as they played. Jeff Minter, the famous hairy person was such a big fan of Robotron that he did his own version and gave it away for next to nowt on the Public Domain market. Being Jeff Minter though, the sprites were all replaced with things like Llamas and cans of cola. Then along came Smash TV in the arcades and what a hit that was. Using the technology pioneered in the amazing Narc coin-op, it was a blatant rip off of Robotron. That was all right though, because Williams did both machines so nobody cared. ALL SORTS OF ACTION! Frow what we've seen, Total Carnage features an amazing goodie bag of features and bonuses to try before you die. These include maps, secret codes, special warps and serious firepower alongside the usual mayhem we've come to know and love from the boys behind Smash TV. Just like Robotron and Smash TV, Total Carnage will be a two-joystick game one for movement and one for firing direction. There's also the infamous Smart Bomb for that tidal wave of destruction from which there's no escapel Total Carnage looks to be a treat and a half and no mistake. Rest assured we'll be giving the arcade machine the full overhaul just the second we can! "

"REVIEW ...to (0787 view MEGADRIVE .99 BY DATA EAST Take two crude dudes named Biff I and Spike, genetically engineered warriors from a devastated city. Find yourself some trouble and send 'em into action, because that's what you built them for after all! It's New York in the year 2020 and an accident with some plutonium has completely levelled the city. The problem is that amidst the rubble and devastation, a twisted, evil scientist has been buildTWO CREDE DUDES ing an army of mutants and robots, all armed to the teeth and very angry. Fortunately Biff and Spike are the two hardest dudes in the post holocaust world. Their methods are a little unsavoury (hence the \"Crude\" nickname) but they get the job done. Their mission is to utterly destroy the army of fiends and take on the professor himself. Best of all though, they get paid for doing it! Get busting, crudes! A Oil Put me down, dude! You'd better watch out or I'll get my dad on you... The original arcade game never really took the arcade world by storm, but it was a good laugh nonetheless. The Megadrive conversion is a much more enjoyable game. The graphics look as if they have been taken straight from the coin-op and are quite unfeasibly colourful for a Megadrive title. The sprites are among the best that the Sega machine has seen, with superb animation and hilarious baddies. The backgrounds scroll by in supersmooth paralTax, adding a real sense of devastation to the proceedings. The music sets new standards, with brilliant guitar soundtracks and sampled screams throughout. Gameplay is a real treat. It's very simple at first, but you soon learn all sorts of tricks and tactics as far as baddie bashing is concerned. Playing by yourself is challenging and addictive, but things go into overdrive in two-player mode. The end of level baddies are imaginative and well designed and playing at any difficulty level higher than easy is a real challenge. Even once you've completed this game, you'll be plugging it in and coming back for more. This cart breathes new life into an otherwise staid genre. Get crude, dude! FRANK O'CONNOR RUDE DUDES One of the neat and hilarious features of Two Crude Dudes, is their ability to pick each other up. Walk up to your team-mate, press the A button and you'll lift him clean above your head! Simply wait until some baddies arrive at the scene and then hurl him at them. Using a pal in this fashion doesn't actually hurt him but it knocks hell out of the enemy! This feature is especially useful when confronting the end of level baddies. It can get really annoying though, when you keep getting thrown about instead of getting your share of the action. Put me down, dude! CHEWED DUDES If you fancy a bit of horizontally scrolling beat 'em up action, then there are a host of titles to choose from. Super Shinobi was the first and arguably the best beat 'em up on the Megadrive and is still widely available. A big emphasis on platforms and puzzles in that one. Strider is a visually spectacular game of a similar ilk, but again, the emphasis is on platform action. Straightforward Kung Fu action can be found in Last Battle, but frankly it's not much good. Alternatively, you could opt for the technically brilliant but rather slow Budokan. There are tons of others, but you probably know about them already! In fact, we'll put up a free Megadrive game to anyone who can send us the longest list! 028 Thanks to Paul Kennedy from Acock's Green, Birmingham, for the skill pixi "


"REVIEW THANKS... ...to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the review cartridge. SHREWD DUDES If you're the sort of person who likes throwing an almighty strop and chucking stuff about to get attention then this is the game for you! You can pick up almost everything in the game except the backgrounds rocks, bins, lamp posts, rubble and almost every single bad guy! There's even a point in the game where you're attacked by tanks and yes, you can pick them up too. A Watch out it's Mr Whippy! By some. miracle | missed out on the Two Crude Dudes coin-op, which is a pity because if it's anything like this think I'd have been a tad impressed by its funpacked beat 'em up action! I may not have been too overawed by the graphics, mind you these Megadrive sprites are a bit on the square side and don't animate all that fluidly. Still, the idea of smashing up the vending machine to nick the cans of drink is well done, especially the Batman-like \"Whack!\" and \"Thwock\" flashes which appear with each hit. Lots of baddies to smash to a pulp and tons of weapons to pick up like concrete blocks, lamp-posts and even old cars all adds to the fun. Sound is above average, but after being treated to the sonic feast of Streets of Rage was quite frankly left wanting. This isn't the best beat 'em up on the Megadrive Streets Of Rage still holds that accolade and probably will for quite a while but if you've got that and are looking for a thumping new challenge then Two Crude Dudes should see you alright for a while. while. PAUL RAND A Crikey those shoes! Throwing a tank is not only impressive, it's also very effective, destroying almost anything in its path. What a hoot! Getting anywhere in the game is virtually impossible without learning how to throw and it takes quite a bit of practice but it's worth it to chuck your weight about or somebody else's as the case may be. That's the way to do it! Fancy some power? Grab a couple of cans! Dear me, what a sad travesty of a dude... WIEM FOOD DUDES Along the hazard-strewn path you'll get quite a lot of stuffing kicked out of you. This would be a very big problem if it wasn't for the handy Coke machines lying around in the rubble. When you come across one and give it the kicking it so richly deserves, out pops a can of cola! Slugging this back tops up your energy levels and you can drink as much of the stuff as you like. Of course, in two-player mode the competition for the cans is intense. Throwing your pal around as he's about to reach full energy is a laff riot. The cola machines also turn up at the end of every level, giving you a chance to beef up your energy levels even more. Hurrah! LEWD DUDES The evil dudes who attack you during the course of the game come in various guises, none more hilarious than the evil Santa clone! This guy was working in a department store when the holocaust happened and as a result he turned blue and got very nasty. He attacks furiously but he's very small and quite easy to beat. His mates are just as silly including psycho cabbies, armadillos and a Terminator clone. This guy attacks in the guise of a human, but a good kicking soon reveals him to be a cyborg who will pull off his own head and throw it at you. Pretty stupid, huh? BANE A Watch out or you might get burned... CRUDE DUDES Two Crude Dudes might sound like a pretty stupid name for a game but it's not half as stupid as the original arcade game, which was called Crude busters. We all know what a crud is, but what's a crude exactly and how do you bust one? Would you really want to if you knew how? Does any body really care?

"REVIEW NES $39.99 BY OCEAN W hat do you think the best kind of V video game hero is? Is it a rockhard mercenary with a bionic arm? Is it an intrepid xenophobic space explorer? Is it a crack F16 pilot? Not according to Taito, who reckon a fluffy yellow Kiwi is hardest of 'em all! New Zealand Story tells the tale of a little gang of Kiwi who get kidnapped by an evil walrus. Fortunately, our hero escapes and decides to rescue his comrades. In his favour, he has an unlimited supply of arrows, great jumping skills and limited flying abilIties. Not so much in his favour is the fact that he's a small yellow ball of fluff. The odds are stacked against you, the challenge is vast and you're only a little feller after all. Oh well, it's off to the heart of New Zealand for a spot of platform-related action! NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS... New Zealand Story was the product of a Japanese Taito programmer who went to New Zealand for his hols and game back with the game! Playing through you'll see all the tourist spots he visited, 'cos he put them all inl Those crazy dudes! N ANZA HIDDEN BONUS SCREENS AHOY! There are lots of ways to make progress in New Zealand Story, but none faster than the secret warp zones! These are totally invisible and the only way to detect them is to shoot them. When your missiles mysteriously vanish, keep firing at this invisible doorway enough times and a flaming spiral will appear. Simply walk into it and hey presto you're several screens further for ward! These doorways are dotted around the landscape and some are harder to find than others. By using these, it's possible to get to the end of the game without much effort, but you have to be a bit of a genius to find them all. The arcade version of New Zealand Story was a bit of an oddity. The graphics were unspectacular and the gameplay was nothing new. What separated it from the rest of the crowd was something Talto are famous for. That elusive something, that spark of playability that keeps you coming back for more. The NES version, to Ocean's credit, is spot on perfect. All the screens are there, all the levels and all the hidden stuff. The simple graphics have been reproduced faithfully and the music is an upbeat remix of the arcade theme. Playability is there in buc. ketloads and the game itself is huge. Niggles are few and far between, but one complaint is the appalling sprite flicker when too much is going on. Sometimes the poor Kiwi completely disappears and off you trot to your death! The best thing about New Zealand Story (as with the Mario games) is the sheer number of things to discover finding weapons, vehicles and hidden levels has you playing into the wee small hours. NES owners have the best platform games of all time in the Mario series, but buying this pretty damn good arcade conversion won't do you any harm at all! FRANK O'CONNOR KIWIKHZ Jump on the yellow space-hopper and fly away! FLY BOY! Kiwi's can fly but only just. They flap their wings a lot, sort of take off, flap their wings a bit more and hope to stay up. Fortunately, New Zealand is packed full of weird and wonderful flying machines. These include airships of various descriptions, a spaceship, a friendly goose and weird floating space hoppers. They all handle differently and some are more fragile than others. Collecting a joystick icon helps ease the dodgy momentum on some of the craft and makes those tight turns easier NES GRAPHICS 90 SOUNDS PLAYABIL LASTABIL OVERALL 88 030 "

"REVIEW CONTRA SUPER NES BY KONAMI  TH | ance and Bill Gryzor are the hardLest duo in the Universe. They like guns really big guns. They like bombs too. And knives and grenades and flame throwers. Lance and Bill are total psychos, which is why the US Government has sent them on a suicidal mission, Aliens have invaded and virtually destroyed the Earth and it's up to our unhinged heroes to invade the enemy fortress and kill the evil alien emperor. This HI SCORE 0076205 122642 2  oooooo Yuk! It's ugllier than a toasted turd, so fry it! 1 SCORE On a secr the to turn both loon scre you you top000000 RUN! DF At ty you'l TAGE isn't quite as easy as it sounds the only way to reach this fortress is to battle through hordes and hordes of twisted alien space fiends, all armed to the teeth and all hungry for blood. Thankfully Lance and Bill are equipped with some quite stupidly powerful weapons and they're awesomely strong to boot. A stroke of luck, that cos you don't want some weedy wimpo trying to stomp alien heads, do you? IT'S THOSE GRYZOR GEEZERS! Contra Spirit is a sequel of sorts to the arcade games Gryzor and Super Contra. The platform action of Gryzor has been tweaked, giving the game more than a hint of Strider, and the top-down sections from Super Contra have been enhanced using the scaling and rotation abilities to spectacular effect. There are all the usual shooty features, like extra weapons, shields and smart bombs. There's also a feast of guns available and you can carry two at once, switching between them as and when you wish! COR! WHAT A As you run around the various levels wasting baddies and causBEEFY WEAPON ing all sorts of mischief, weapons pods will be flying about. Shoot x02 them and they drop an extra wea pon on your head. These include four-way spread fire, flamethrower, homing missiles and rockets. The saddest weapon of the lot though, is the laser gun, which is about as much use as a one-legged man in a botty kicking contest. You can switch between weapons, but die and you lose the one you were using. Boo! RICE drive can first arme Whi des legi vels hov tho The abi ene dar Super Contra was one of my favourite arcaders and this is a brilliant sequel. It borrows elements from the previous games in the series and turns them into something very special. Platform action is the biggest ingredient-looking like a cross between Strider and Midnight Resistance the game gives you 360 degree control of your gun as well as some incredibly athletic climbing powers. Graphically this game is excellent-most Super Nintendo games look impressive, but this is usually down to good use of special effects. This time round the sprites and back. grounds are beautifully designed and quite awesome to see and the use of scaling and rotation in Contra isn't just a gimmick, it's an intrinsic part of the gameplay. The top-down sections are a frantic race against time and add a fair bit of tension to the proceedings, but the music really makes this something special with a combination of orchestral pieces and driving rock music thrown in! Sampled screams and beefy explosions all enhance the atmosphere and it's a case of turning the volume up, the autofire on and your brain off. The best game of its type on the Fammy so far. TWO PLAYER ACTION The grooviest thing about Contra Spirit is the top-notch two player action. You can both run about at the same time, blowing away baddies and helping each other out. The top-down section takes place in a split screen, so you can explore the terrain independently. Sadly though, on the vertically scrolling sections if you're too slow you get killed. People with dubious friends might find their mate deliberately bumping them off. This just serves to improve the gameplay and gives this title that competitive edge. Mind you, it's harder in one player mode! FRANK O'CONNOR 038 Thanks to Chris Wolfenden from Manchester for these skill pix! "


"REVIEW A Shoot the big red thing! Try not to get lost! THE WHIRLING DERVISH On almost every level you can access a fairly secret power. Press the left and right pads at the top of the joypad simultaneously and you turn into a spinning ball of death! You pull out both guns at once and spin round like a loony, killing almost everything on screen, and the best part is that you can do it as many times as you like even on the top-down levels! Unbelievable! Just when you think you've seen all the Super Nintendo can do, along come Konami with another gobtastically brilliant game which blows everything else away! Big, bold and beautiful sprites are just the tip of T the iceberg on a game so red hot it'll probably melt your joypad as you battle wave after wave of alien scumbags through smooth scrolling screens of disaster! Best of all, the action's accompanied by some real rock aand roll soundtracks which spur you on through thick and thin! Take on the evil empire yourself and it's a riot and a half, but join forces with a pal and Contra Spirit just can't be matched! The game may boast'six levels, but it's actually two games in one because of the vastly different styles of play you'll find. The top down sections can be well confusing at first, but once you've mastered them they're a riot! More than just a game, this is an all-singing, all-dancing, all-murder and mayhem experience you've just GOT to have and if I was one of Nintendo's rivals I'd poop my pants if I saw this. Contra Spirit is exactly the sort of game console freaks have been waiting for and this cart more than de livers. Grab this one a bit quick and remember to thank CVG for telling you all about DRIVING FORCE At two intervals in the game you'll be given the chance to drive a couple of vehicles.

Are you matchmaking for your girlfriend again? -1.39% WHAT'S IN A NAME? Dear YOB. Why don't you change the name of the magazine to Console and Video Games? Also, can you tell me why the mag has turned its attention to Consoles? Please pass this short but informative message on to the Editor as this used to be good mag. Steve Majchrzakowski, Blackley, Manchester YOB: Why don't you pull your head out of the sand and start looking at the world around you. More and more people are buying consoles these days and many of them are people who would never have bought a computer. Does that stop them being computer games players? Of course not! No matter which machine it's on, if it's a hot computer or video game, CVG will be there to tell you about it first. That's what the mag has done for 10 years and that's what we'll do for another ten. I don't know if you ever had any sense, but I'm not holding out much hope now... CDTV'S THE ONE FOR ME! Dear YOB I have got a few things to say to Megadrive owners. Firstly, why are they drooling over the Mega CD? Sega have blatantly copied Commodore's CDTV. It's much better than the Mega CD. Secondly, why do Megadrive owners keep saying that the Megadrive is better than the Amiga? They are two different things you brain-dead geeks! JAMIE RUTHERFORD, Norwich, Norfolk YOB: If you check the history of CDs, you'll find that NEC made the first games related CD drive for the PC Engine. Now, I wonder who copied who? Next time you want to have a go at someone, get your facts straight so you don't look a complete pranny. Also, the Megadrive and the Amiga may be different machines but does that mean people can't compare them? What's wrong with saying a Porsche is better than an Anglia or Bernard Manning plops on Bob Monkhouse or a prostate operation is more fun that you? zu 252 253 31OSTOGO GIMME GIMME GIMME! Dear YOB. I think your section is totally rad and it's the first bit I turn to when get CVG. Just one little question though: can I have a hundred quid? STUART TURNBULL, Chandler's Ford, Hampshire YOB: Sure! Just send me another letter containing the words I AM STUPID STU AND I'M THICK IAM as many times as you can. In fact, any. body else can enter too. and I'll put up a sackful of software for whoever can say you're stupid the most times in one letter. Can't say fairer than that, eh? SCRAPE  A DOWN UNDER DOH! Dear YOB I have been buying your magazine for about two years now and I would just like to say that it is the best. Tons of reviews, lots of laughs. My real reason for writ ing is to say what a disappointment Sonic the Hedgehog is. It's got wonderful graphics and sound but it's just too darned easy! I completed it on my second attempt. Everybody knows how important lastability is in a game but Sega seem to have forgotten this. I also think that you get too hard a time for being mean and nasty, because after all, that is your job! CHRIS ROYAL Brisbane, Australia YOB: I have been getting letters 1 DECLARE THIS from Australia for ages now and I would just like to say that it is COUNTRY COMPLE) crap. It's such a sad country they TELY CRAP! had to hide it on the other side of the world and Columbus mistook the whole sad island for a floating turd. If any down under dunces can come up with gags of similar quality, fire them my way and there's the Aussie equivalent of a hundred quid for the winner! MORE AUSSIE ANTICS Dear YOB, I have got a Nintendo and a Gameboy. On Nintendo I have Cobra Triangle, Gun Smoke, Wrestle Mania, Kid Icarus and lots more. On Gameboy I have Tetris, Super Mario, Skate or Die and a couple more. I really enjoy CVG but us kids down under want to enter some of your competitions too. I mean, you guys have to think your magazine doesn't just sell in London it comes to Australia too. Here are some questions for you: 1. Can you get some competitions where we can send in? 2. Can you rig up something to get CVG here quicker? 3. Please publish this letter all the others must have got lost in the mail. 4. Try to include more Gameboy and Nintendo. Thanks YOB. C. LAYTON Victoria, Australia. 1. You ought to know by now that CVG often holds compos open so that sad overseas types can get their entries in too. We're even thinking about a compo specifically for Aussies only. Whaddya think? Drop me a line with your views. 2. I've had a word with Mr Dropping and his carrier pigeons are on a dose of steroids as I write. 3. They didn't get lost, I just threw them away. 4. What's GO! full of then? Doh! CHE PAGE 42 "


"ISO PORTUGAL? WHERE'S THAT THEN? I JUST GET HYSTERICAL Dear YOB, I am writing to compliment you on your ever so funny YOB's Mailbag. Last night I was reading the latest issue of CVG and I must admit I was absolutely creased. My mother was hammering on the wall of my bedroom and yelling at me to shut up. Anyway, my friend and I (Wally) often dispute the dominance of the NES over the Master System. Could you please confirm the argument and send me ? G. TULIP Hebburn, Tyne and Wear.

By the way, Mrs Tulip, how about hammering on his head next time the lad might get some sense that way.

I've got some good games as well, such as The Revenge of Shinobi, Streets of Rage, Madden's 92 and EA Hockey. So what's the problem? Well, without a joypad, these games are very difficult. My pal came up about a month ago and spilled Cola on it. I've looked everywhere for a joypad, but can't find one. Please, please could you send me one seeing as you're So cool.

Um, that's what I thought... Laura Salmon, Fareham, Hants. YOB: Just what I always thought: girls really are as thick as mince. You've must have a brain the size of a stickleback if you think I'm going to be scared by anything a wimpy girlie's got to say, especially when she lives in Fareham and buys crap Kylie records instead of computer games... YOB: Oh dear, oh dear. What a stupid little Stuart you are. So your mate spilled his Coke on your joypad, eh? Why didn't you accidentally throw your fist into his gob, unintentionally smack him round the head and completely by accident knock six bells out of him until he coughed up for a new one? That's quite mistakenly what I'll do the next time you write a chin-spinner like this and try to blag a second joypad out of me... w FAREHAM WIMMINS COMMITEE SOME SERIOUS ANSWERS I'VE GOT A QUESTION Dear YOB, Just a couple of questions to keep your brain in order. I would be grateful if you answered. 1. Will Kick Off come out on the Lynx? 2. I have seen John Madden for the Amiga in the magazines, but when will it be in the shops? 3. When will Microprose Grand Prix be out on the PC? 4. When will NFL footie be out on the Lynx? Gavin Thomas, Oakham, Leics YOB: 1. Anything's possible, but nothing definite as yet. 2. It should be out now. 3. Very soon. 4. Right PITIFUL POVERTY Dear YOB, Ever since I bought a brand new Amiga 500 Plus I have been borrowing games from my mates with older Amigas. The problem is that none of these seem to work on my Amiga. What can I do to remedy this? Mohsin Choudhry, Sheffield YOB: In their infinite wisdom, Commodore brought out a machine which was incompatible with certain games. They say these game are the ones that \"break the rules\" which, incidentally, just happen to be the best games as well. The sad fact is you're up the creek without a paddle. MY STUPID PAL Dear YOB, I have got a Mega CD and a Jap Megadrive, but my pal who has an official Megadrive cannot get it to work properly. Why is this? Annie Lennox, Eurythmics. YOB: The fact is that Jap and official UK machines run at different speeds, which is why your mates combination won't work. He'll just have to wait until the official release later this year. Until then, just give him a sad Phil Collins CD and tell him it's Heavy Nova. He won't know the difference... now. "

"22 REVIEW REVIEW NANUHE SPORTSTER TSTE RACE DRIVIN' AMIGA BY DOMARK .99 WE EZTE BUELT DE! Dista DOO HEAD TO HEAD ANTICS If you're dead clever and have oodies of cash you can get hold of a thing called a Null Modem, which allows you to link two machines and race head to head provided you've both got machines and a copy of the game. You can race in any car and on any track you please and the only drawback is that the modem itself is a tad expensive, Still, if youve got more money than sense you'll have a ball. It's big, it's red and it's admired by I just about everyone. No it isn't the Labour Party, it's a Ferrari Testarossa and you get to drive it in Race Drivin'. This sequel to the original Atari coin-op has been doing the rounds in the arcades for quite a while now. This conversion from Domark has turned up in the nick of time and features quite a few improvements over the first arcade game as well as the home conversions. The game sees you in command of an assortment of vehicles and the car you drive depends on which of three tracks you choose all are different, requiring specific skills and talents to complete a lap. The cars perform differently too: some are built for comfort, others for speed. Whichever style you opt for, put your foot down and prepare to race! The first Hard Drivin' game was more of a novelty than anything else and as an arcade conversion it ranked very highly. This sequel is very similar, and to its credit there's a lot more variety. The main problem with all versions of Hard Drivin' is the lack of a decent control method. You simply can't hope to recreate the arcade machine's steering wheel and three pedals on a mouse or joystick. The clutch system is a bit disappointing too you simply brake and then change gear. The tracks are fun though and the choice of cars makes things that bit more interesting. One major plus point in Race Drivin' is the two player option. The chance to link two machines for head-to-head racing is excellent, and it's a bit sad that next to no-one will get to play it! Unfortunately, for one player things can get very tedious very quickly. The graphics aren't too bad, but I've seen better vector routines, and sound is very basic apart from the brilliant guitar riff on the intro screen. An ambitious game which is well presented and well designed but ultimately disappointing. FRANK O'CONNOR O CO THREE CAR PILE-UP As in the arcade game, the Amiga version of Race Drivin' gives you a choice of three cars. These come in both automatic and manual gearshift combinations, so there are really six to choose from. The cars all perform differently and experienced players will try to complete all the tracks with all the cars. They are: The Speedster: built for sheer top speed and acceleration, but handling suffers as a result The Roadster: a real toughie, with brilliant handling and cornering, almost certainly the best choice for stunt tracks. The Sportster: a good all rounder. You won't go far wrong on any track with this baby FREAKY PHANTOM FUN In Race Drivin' your big opponent is time. Unless you're really good, of course, in which case you can take on the Phantom Photon. This bloke's a bit good, and just keeps getting better and better. In fact, if you beat him in a race he ghosts your better effort in the next round so you have to keep getting better and better! Racing against yourself is a bit weird, but great fun! THE TRACKS OF MY TEARS  81 There are four tracks in Race Drivin', including the original two from the first game. The extra two are as follows: Super Stunt: a massive and complex course, featuring a moun tain climb, a corkscrew and the extremely perilous broken loop. Autocross: a course for real hard drivers and a test of speed and cornering prowess. This track separates the men from the boys. The original two tracks from the arcade are a Speed Track and a rather groovy Stunt Track, not quite as tricky as the new ones but fun all the same. PLATALIE LASTIL OVERALL 75 "


"REVIEW PC ENGINE  BY KONAMI It's time to blast some more alien scum out of the universe. They're terrorising poor little planets all over the solar system, and it's your job to sort them out and kick some ass. Armed with a mere machine gun you need to jump into your mega space ship and put it into hyper drive to reach the mutating scumoids far, far away in the hope of finding some decent weapons and earning some respect for you shooting abilities. Some of you lot may have already seen coin-ops, which was released in 1986. Since then it's been converted quite a bit, earning an all-round reputation as a cool blast. Now the game has emerged on the PC Engine, and it's one of the strongest of the lot! Get to it and blow some space blobs away! AMANDER GUARDIANS A GO-GO PICKEM UP PAL The follow-up to the excellent Nemesis, Salamander is packed full of fab power-ups. Initially you're equipped with a pathetic machine gun, which can easily be powered up by shooting an entire attack wave of aliens, revealing an extra weapon. Take your pick: SPEED UPS Feeling a bit sluggish? Is life just getting you down? Pick up a few of these little darlin's for super speed thrills 'n' spills! LASERS red hot wonders which blow away anything in their path; HOMING MISSILES alien scumbags have been seen to turn green and poop themselves when one of these little babies gets on their tail; I just don't believe it! The PC Engine has flippin well done it again, with another arcade perfect conversion to add to its massive catalogue! Basically this is virtually the coin-op machine squeezes into a little box, and all the features we've come to expect are there. Super smooth scrolling is the first thing you notice, then it's the gorgeous graphics faithfully reproduced from the arcade daddy. Gameplay has got to be where the game scores highest, though it can be one tough mutha of a beastie and some of the end of level baddies remain awesome after all this time! I must have pumped a fortune into Nemesis in the arcades, and a small mint into Salamander. Now I don't have to spend a penny (oo-er!) because Salamander on the engine is just the tops! Buy it and discover a total arcade experience in the comfort of your own home! Is there anybody still out there who doesn't realise what an incredible machine the PC Engine is and it only costs about eighty quid! Qujite simply this is another Engine classic and another must-have! TIM BOONE In true shoot 'em up style, there are numerous massive quardians at the end of each stage. On the first stage you have to pit your wits against a huge brain that's equipped with two pincer shooting arms. Once you've defeated this meanie it's onto the meteorite storm. Make your way through the meteorites and you'll end up in the company of a vicious twirling electrical fan (well, sort of!). Circle around this, trying to shoot the centre which will eventually result in its death. The best way to defeat all guardians is by powering up your ship to the maximum before you confront the big meanie, it you're only equipped with a puny gun you'll be there forever. and you'll probably die of boredom before he finishes you off!

"OSONing THE HEDGEHOG e's small, he's spiky, he's blue and cor blimry The's brill! He's Sonic The Hedgehog and he's taking over the world! It seems like the whole planet's gone Sonic bonkers over Sega's spiky blue superhero. He's on Megadrive, Master System and Game Gear and soon you'll be able to buy Sonic hand-held LCD games for more hedgehogrelated laffs! So what does the galaxy's greatest games mag do about it? Simple. By popular request we print the first complete guide to Sonic with eveything you need to know about the game and some brand new piccies of the lad himself. Is this the business or what? "


"THE SUPER SONIC STORY For sad shufflers who don't already know, Sonic's a hedgehog with a mission. Whichever machine he's on. Sonic's task is the same: to free his furry friends from the diabolical clutches of the evil Dr Robotnik. This seriously bad lad has captured all of Sonic's pals and encased them in biomechanoid armour programmed to terrorise the world! To free his pals, Sonic has to race through a series of zones each consisting of huge scrolling areas packed with hazards and puzzles and all sorts of other things very bad for hedgehogs. But fear not because our hero can fight back in a number of ways he can jump on his foes or curl into a ball and leap onto any enemy, skewering them on his spines! By collecting the magic rings which lie scattered around, Sonic is further protected contact with an enemy is neutralised by the rings, but all the rings in Sonic's possession are dropped. Any rings remaining at the end of the level are exchanged for bonus points and if Sonic collects a certain number he'll be transported to the bonus level! At the end of each zone, our sky-blue spiky-top is confronted by the doctor himself, armed with various weapons and intent on turning Sonic into hedgehog pie. Are you a hard enough hedgehog to survive? BONUS HEDGEHOG LAFFS! Whichever version he's playing in, if Sonic manages to collect enough rings before reaching the end of an area he's whisked off to a seriously strange bonus round. On the Meagdrive it's a amazing rotating maze filled with rings and emeralds, while the Master System and Game Gear versions put our hero in an incredible bouncing room full of goodies! Both of them are a sight to behold as the lad swirls and bounces all over the place and lots of people reckon the Master System bonus round is better than its Megadrive counterpart! THE SONIC GAME GUIDE Here it is the most difinitive list yet published of all the tips, cheats and hints to help you get the most from the game. Note that there have been quite a few versions of the game on Megadrive, and therefore you might find that some of the cheats don't work with your copy. Oh well, that's the way the cookie crumbles... First up, the Level Select cheat that everybody should know. On the intro screen press UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT. A tinkle will tell you you're on the right lines. Then press A, B, C and START together to access the Levels Menu and play what ever part of the game you like! SUPER SECRET STAGES 1 On the intro screen press these combinations to select secret stages: 1. UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A, C, B, C, A, START 2. A, C, B, C, A, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A, C, B, C, A, START 3. UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A, C, B, C, A, A, C, B, C, A, START Instead of a score there should be some code. By pressing B Sonic should change into a ring, press B to make him turn into another sprite and press C to make your chosen sprite permanent, giving you infinite lives! While cheat mode is on press pause, press B to see action in slow motion and C to get frame by frame animation, but be careful because it can crash. If you reset the game try getting it again by pressing A and START and holding them down for a few seconds. Select Green Hill Zone act 1, which will bring up a different screen every time. SONG TIGER "


"JOLLY JEWEL JAPERY Access the stage select screen (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and A, B, C and START together). Now, select the special stage and collect the jewel. When the words CHAOS EMERALDS appear, press RESET and enter the special stage again. Collect the jewel and reset when the words appear. Do this six times in all and start the game you will find that you possess all six jewels needed to complete the game! BEATING THE BAD BOY! Here's a level-by-level guide to beating the evil Doctor Robotnik. It's crucial info and could help you complete the Megadrive version without cheating! GREEN HILL ZONE: As Sonic uns past the lampost he will arsve at a screen on which are two Toating ledges. Jump onto the right one first and wait for Dr Robook to appear. As he comes toward Sonic, jump up and butt him three or four times. Robotnik will then release a huge ball and chain which will start to swing to the right. Jump over the ball and Sonic will probably bash the doctor's craft again. Then jump onto the left hand ledge and, when the ball starts to come Sonic's way, eap over it, hitting the craft. Keep doing this until Robotnik is defeated. MARBLE ZONE: There are two rock mounds on the end screen jump onto the right one and wait for Robotnik to appear. Bang him as he comes from the right. He will fly to the left and release a firebomb. Wait for him to return to the right and then bash him again and jump over to the left ledge as the final fire spark falls off the mound and into the lava. He then releases another firebomb on the right ledge before flying over to the left, at which point bang him again. Continue to do this to despatch him easily SPRING YARD ZONE: As he crosses the moving steps, Sonic will en counter Dr Robnotik. This time, a large spike protrudes from the base of his flying machine. Move to the left of the screen the Doc will follow and try to impale Sonic on the spike. Move a little to the right, so as not get pierced, and jump up to bash him a couple of times. Try to keep the edges of the screen and lure him into destroying the blocks at the side. Using this method, Sonic will destroy the craft and progress to the next zone. LABYRINTH ZONE: Once Sonic reaches Robotnik, bash him and follow him up the rocky ledges. Try to be quick in following otherwise the water will catch up (and it's a well-known fact that hedgehogs HATE water!). Also, be careful of the spikes, traps and fire-breathing heads on the wall, as if Sonic is hit he will fall a long way down! Robotnik cannot STARLIGHT ZONE: As Sonic be destroyed on this level, but if he is kept up with he will go away comes to the end of this zone he will come face-to-face with three after a while. pinball bumpers, such as those found throughout the game. Wait F for Dr Robotnik to arrive and start dropping spiked balls from his ship. When he drops one quickly jump to the other side of the bumper, so that it rebounds back and hits him. Ensure Sonic doesn't get hit by any of the balls, and remember that when a ball is left alone it explodes. Keep on knockap ? ing the balls back onto the Doctor to complete this zone with ease! THE FINAL ZONE: Robotnik appears from metal and glass tubes protruding from the floor and ceiling. Sonic must bang eight times the tube in which he appears. Watch out for two tubes popping up together, as he will be crushed. Once Sonic hits or misses a tube, a set of electric balls attempt to fry the blue megastar. They start at the top of the screen and slowly descend. Find the widest gap between the balls and, when they fall, jump upwards so as not to hit them. Keep doing this to complete the game and see Sonic rush to join his pals! "


"HOGGING THE LIMELIGHT! With a superstar like Sonic tucked safely under their belts, Sega are planning big things with the little blue hero. He's already made a guest appearance in the arcade game Rad Mobile, and there are plans for more in the future, but everyone's waiting for Sonic 2. The sequel will definitely be available in December on Megadrive (other versions to follow) just in time to gran Christmas Number One. The exact format the game will 628089 take is still a closely guarded sePERS cret, but we understand that the basic style of the game will re. main unchanged. There are also heavy rumours of a Mega CD version of the game, which will be absolutely enormous and feature some role-playing elements to RUA WARNA keep people at it for months. Many people complained that the original Sonic was a little too easy, and you can bet your bottom dollar that Sega have listRASHERS ened to the criticism and will make the sequel a bit of a tough nut to crack!

"SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND IT LECHUCK'S REVENGE AMAZING! Loads of you have sent in solutions to this amazing Lucasfilm adventure but the most detailed of the lot comes from Dermot Smurfit of Windlesham, Surrey. His complete guide is so, um, complete that he's won himself  worth of games and we're printing the solution across the next few issues! Remember this solution will probably hold good for conversions of the game to other machines, so keep it safe! Are we good to you or what? PART ONE. THE LARGO EMBARGO: Our hero, Guybrush, is stuck on Scabb Island and it's up to you to get him off. To begin with, pick up the stick on the beach before entering Tickwoood. One violent assault later and you're left penniless. Leave the town and visit the Swamp. Climb into the coffin and paddle over to the Voodoo Lady's skull shack. Once inside, grab the string from the skulls to the left and walk right to get briefed by the Voodoo Lady on how to do away with Largo. You've got to get a few ingredients for a voodoo doll of Largo . some hair, some body fluid, some clothes belonging to Largo and a piece of dead flesh from a member of his family! Once you have been given the shopping list, slink back over to Tickwood and give the sign a rattle to get the shovel. Pay Wally the Cartographer a visit and wait until he puts his monocle down, then pinch it. Grab a piece of paper before exiting, but don't dawdle as Wally's pathetic simperings will soon turn you to a blubbering mass in front of your computer! Now toddle off to the Bloody Lip Bar, but enter via the windows at the back of the ship. You'll now be in the kitchen. Grab a knife from the table and scarper through the window. Move one ship along to the hotel and cut the rope holding the lizard with the knife. Once the receptionist has chased after it, you can enter Largo's room and take his wig. One ingredient down, three to go. Don't hang around as Largo will soon make an appearance if you do. Leave the ship, grab bing a handful of Cheese Squigglies from the bowl as you go, and head for the Laundry ship right at the back of the town. There'll be a rat scurrying around here. Put the Cheese Squigglies in the box and tie the string to the stick you found on the beach. Use this to prop open the box. Pull the string when the rat is munching on the Squigglies to trap it. Open it again and you'll be able to pick up the ral and put it in your pocket. Before you leave, remember to take the bucket hanging from the beam on the left (when questioned by the pirates, just ask them whether it's theirs and they'll let you take it). "


"PIRATES SPIT NiCome on, lets Pay another visit to the Bloody Lip Bar entering via the conventional enmange this time around. Hang und until Largo embraces you in his putrid presence.

Return to Tickwood and go to the Bloody Lip's kitchen. PART TWO FOUR MAP PIECES: Before you look at the map you will find yourself on Dread's ship. Pick up the empty bag of Parrot Chow next to the door. Once you've done this, go back inside the ship and select Phatt Island on the map. Once there, you'll be captured by a Burly Guard and eventually wind up in the clink. To get out, have a look under the mattress in your cell. Now use the stick which you find there to get an appendage from the talkative neighbour in the cell. Use the leg bone to get the key to the cell from the dog. On your way out, pinch the two envelopes on the shelf. Open them both to get your possess. ions back, not to mention Mr Gorilla's, too! Saunter over to the library and open the top of the model lighthouse. Inside is a lens which you need to grab, so get it quick Here, put the rat in the cooking pot.

Great Shipwrecks (under DISASTERS) and any one other book. Now go to the first alley on the wharf. When the lucky guy leaves, follow him to the next alley down. Once he's left, use the panel on the door. Now for the complicated part: keep on guessing the answer until you get one right. As soon as he tells you you're correct, save the game. If you don't get the next question right, just keep on reloading until you do. Repeat the process until you have answered three questions correctly and he'll tell you the winning number on the wheel of fortune in the first alley. Go back there and place your bel.

"REVIEW et PC ENGINE BY KOMUNI  THE BELLS, THE BELLS! The extra weapons in this game are very peculiar indeed. Clouds with little smiley faces float around the sky and if you shoot them a bell will fall out. Collecting a golden bell will endow you with a big pile of points, but blasting them is a much better idea. The bell will bounce up the screen and if you're lucky it'll change colour. Different coloured bells do different things, but most give you some kind of power up. You can get ghost ships that work like multiples, shields and various kinds of laser. There is a down side to all this though, because the bells turn black if you shoot them often enough and collecting one of these is very bad news. Also known as Twin Bee, Bells and A Whistles tells the story of a young boy and his pet helicopter and crab combination. Confused? Yup, it's a Japanese game and it's as weird as anything they've come up with before. Bells and Whistles is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up where even the baddies are lovely! This poor young lad loses his helicopter/crab combination when it sets out to res. cue a kidnapped princess from the clutches of a mighty thingy. The reason for the rather odd name of Bells and Whistles soon becomes apparent. The fact is, the skies are full of bells! Little puffy white clouds conceal these bells and when shot, drop them in your path. Collecting these as you fly up the vertically scrolling screen will endow you with strange and magical powers. You'll need 'em too, because the landscape is seething with frenzied cute things who make you squeak when they grab your beak. Kill 'em all...or de trying. A Crkey It's those fire doom! Hurrah! More ridiculously funny shoot 'em ups from Konami! Those boys in Japan have been taking advantage of the sudden resurgence in popularity of the PC Engine and released spot on conversions of all their best coin-ops. This is testament to that and it's a brilliant version of the Bells and Whistles coin op. The use of humour in video games has often been a bit crap in the past, but Japanese games seldom miss the mark when it comes to belly laffs. The graphics are as with most Konami games, spectacular brilliant colours, hilarious sprites and smooth scrolling parallax make this a visual feast. The music is silly and annoying, but the sampled screams of pain and delight are a right old laugh. The gameplay is awesome: on easy level it's a bit sad and pathetic, but crank it up to hard and you have an incredible challenge. With two players the game takes on a whole new light, with fierce competition for bonus goodies and extra weapons. To put it bluntly, only minor graphical differences separate this from the coin op. Another essential PC Engine title from the masters of the art. Go get it! TWIN TWIN BEES As with all good shoot 'em ups, Bells and Whistles has a two player mode. Both players get to fly around the screen at the same time, blasting and competing for points. Playing in two player mode effectively doubles your firepower and as a result the game gets much easier. Best of all though is the heated argument when you snatch your mate's extra weapons just as he's about to collect them. When you both have a full complement of weapons, the screen becomes a mess of bullets and laser fire. You also have a beam up option (like in R-Type) which unleashes a massive burst of flame!

"REVIEW Pick those up for weapons and points! ONS DE MEGADRIVE  BY   KHIR Run for it dude! Now this guy is bior 59292WDT 8 In a parallel Universe, technology Ihas advanced in quite a different direction. Computers and plastic are unheard of, although machinery is more sophisticated than our own. The result is a dark world of wood and steel in which massive airships and huge biplanes dominate the skies and air pollution is thick and poisonous, the result of thoughtless mining and manufacturing. The government has only one purpose: to keep the people from rebellion. One man has risen above all this. A lone, nameless warrior sick of the evil and repression in this dark world and seeking freedom for him and his family. He has built his own aircraft and armed it to the teeth and alone must face the might of the faceless rulers of his planet. With nobody to help him, he takes to the skies in a battle to end all battles. Brace yourself, take your pilot's seat and man the guns. The war against the Steel Empire is about to begin... ACOV Amou) Yes! Another horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up on the Megadrive! There are more than enough to choose from, with the likes of Thunderforce and Hellfire out there, but this game gives the genre a whole new slant. It's all down to the impressive and highly original graphics the use of antiquated Sci-fi ideas works brilliantly and the detail and attention which has been paid to the backdrops and sprites is amazing some of the end of level nasties are truly gobsmacking. Huge craft drift around the screen loosing off hundreds of bullets and cranking menacIngly as they approach and the backgrounds show a ruined and polluted city in perfect detail. The use of the two aircraft gives the game more than a little variety and the urge to see the next level is intense. The sound is, to be honest, a little disappointing. It's atmospheric enough but just not very interesting. Gameplay is excellent lots to do, lots to see and lots to shoot. The extra weapons are not too inspiring but you'll need to collect them anyway. This is the first decent Megadrive shooter for ages and it's one that blast fans can't do without! FRANK O'CONNOR SV THE BIGGEST BADDIES IN THE UNIVERSE One notable feature about Steel Empire, is the sheer size of the baddies. Even the mid level critters are blimmin' huge while the end of level baddies are a sight to be seen and they'll have you filling your pants with bed-wetting horror as they approach. One level features a massive flying warship which looks more than a bit similar to the third level of R-Type. This particular nasty takes about a million shots to destroy as you weave in and out of its various nooks and crannies. The most horrible baddies are the ones that run on tracks, as you have to get very close to destroy them, risking life and limb in the process! AIRSHIP OR AIRPLANE? One of the unique features of Steel Empire is the choice of craft. You can choose to control either a large and unwieldy airship or a smart and fast biplane. Each craft has different weapons and handling abilities: AIRSHIP-a tad sluggish, presenting a large and easy target for the enemy. To compensate for this, it powers up quickly and has quite a beety selection of weapons. 350 E = Make them eat les 0 2 BIPLANE fast and sleek, but not very powerful and a ship for real flyboys. You can switch ships as you please between levels, but you'll probably find a favourite and stick to it. no 062 "


"REVIEVE Uh oh! What's this then? PUNJAK Now that's a big gunl Here's quite a novel twist on the horizontal shooter format, and a pretty darned good game to boot! Steel Empire is actually quite original as far as shoot 'em ups go, and most of that's down to the Flash Gordon Meets Jules Verne olde worlde graphics which really make this cart stand out from the crowd. Somebody has spent a lot of time getting the look of this game just right, and I have to say I've never seen anything quite like it! Gameplay is very much what you'd expect fly along and shoot whatever you come across but you can't really complain when the backdrop's as novel as this! The only thing that turned me off was the sound It's an ambitious attempt to add atmosphere which doesn't really come off. That aside, Steel Empire is one of those games you'll probably love, especially if you're looking for something a bit different! TIM BOONE Away FASTER THAN AEROBLASTER Arcade fans might remember coin-op called Aeroblaster twas a fairly run of the mill horizontal shooter, but had -PAUSS are nice feature that made it stand out. At certain points in the game, the scrolling tripled in speed and you shot through a series of tunnels at a breakneck pace! This feature has been borrowed and used to good effect in Steel Empire. the tunnel sequence scrolls from right to left, the opposite diraction from what we're used to it's all very disorientating but a real hoot when you get used to it! PICK IT UP! Yes folks! A shoot 'em up with extra weapons! It's never been done before! Seriously though, to get anywhere in this game, you'll need to pick up floating icons that shot baddies some imes drop. You start off with a machine gun and bombs, both of which can be fired either backwards or forwards. You can boost the machine gun in stages, until it finally becomes a massive wave of destructive bullets. Bombs too can be souped up, becoming more numerous, more powerful and larger in size. These are essential for destroying some end of level baddies. 9 89 und The big blue atrship of doop Cannon lodder hylng tugboat from Eht You're spaced WHO'S JULES VERNE? Jules Verne was a top French author who came up with amazing science fiction concepts like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Journey To The Centre Of The Earth, From Earth To The Moon and lots more besides. What all these books have in common with Steel Empire is the bizarre concept of what the future would be like. All the graphics are reminiscent of ancient illustrasons that accompanied Verne's books. It gives the game a very peculiar atmosphere and it works a treat. Who says we don't each you anything? MEGADRIVE GRAPHICS 90 SOUNDS 84 PLAYABILITY 89 LASTABILITY OVERALL 90 063 "

"INCREDIBLE! Our amazing competition to give laway Arnie's T2 T-shirt really got you lot going over the last couple of months, so much so that we had to keep the compo open for an extra Tour weeks!

"REVIEW NEO GEO BY SNK  The Earth is ruined. Constant exposure to pollution and nuclear contamination has wrecked the planet completely. Children are born with two heads, five legs and other, more horrible aberrations. Only people in Yeovil fail to notice the difference. A crazed scientist has deliberately increased the level of radiation on the planet in an attempt to breed a race of super mutants and Earth needs a hero or two to save the planet from this menace. Who can they turn to? Who's hard enough to take on the challenge and survive? Enter Ken and Baz, both shop assistants in a Manchester Tesco's when the catastrophe happened. They decide there and then in the vegetable section to save the world and destroy the evil scientist bloke once and for all and without pausing to stick the price label on another can of baked beans, off they go to kick some behind... BLIMEY! THAT'S ORIGINAL! No it's not. Mutation Nation is virtually the same as almost every Neo Geo beat 'em up so far! Yup, if it's Final Fight style games you're after, you won't go far wrong with a Neo. There are some excellent scrolling beat 'em ups available, including Burning Fight, 8 Man and the superb Sengoku. Some of the older games are a bit cheaper now and you can pick up the likes of Magician Lord and Ghost Pilots for almost reasonable prices. If you fancy a one on one beater then try King of the Monsters or Fatal Fury both excellent. The Neo Geo has more than its fair share of this type of game and you're really spoiled for choice when it comes to scrolling beat 'em ups. This one features nothing new in the way of gameplay, but it does take a novel approach to graphical style. All the characters in the game, disgusting mutants the lot of them, are brilliantly animated mutants and graphics as a whole are quite outstanding, even by the mighty Neo Geo's standards. Music is a little disappointing, but the sound effects are groovy. One fault with a great deal of Neo games is the lack of attention to character animation, but all that's changed here even the most unimportant sprites are fluid and lifelike. Gameplay is as good as you would expect from this kind of title, with basic punching and kicking the order of the day. The problem is that there are similar and better games on the Neo Geo and you'd probably be better off choosing something else. All in all, a solid and impressive release which is utterly lacking in imagination or originality, FRANK O'CONNOR MUTANT MALARKEY Play Mutation Nation and you'll quickly discover another variation on the age-old theme of Smart Bombing. This time though, the smart bombs are mystical mutant psychic powers! To use these, you collect tokens marked A, B, C or D as they appear at various intervals around the landscape and let one off (pardon) by holding down the kick button while an energy bar rises to its peak. When it reaches the top, release the button and one of four bomb types goes off: BOMB A: Your own body becomes the bomb bursting into flames and splitting apart. BOMB B: A flaming fireball which blasts the baddies to kingdom comel BOMB C: A lightning strike which builds up when you throw yourself to the ground. BOMB D: This one's a big secret and very spectacular. We won't spoil it by telling you what it is! NO BOMBS: If you don't have a token and try any of the above, your energy bar will be quickly depleted and you fire off a series of superfast kicks! A Two player ass-kicking action! MAD MANIAC MORONS The Mutant Scientist is a total loony the sort of bloke who votes SDP and teaches media studies for a living. To reach him you'll have to defeat his most twisted creations on five different levels but be prepared for a big surprise when you finally meet him face to face!

"REVIEW ORLE&E MASTER SYSTEM  BY SEGA Asterix is hard. Well hard. In case you don't know, he's this small blond bloke who singlehandedly defended France against the Romans. At short notice he was the best the French could come up with, and seeing as the Romans were a load of old women anyway because this is complete fiction he actually did quite well. This near invincible comic hero appeared in countless cartoon strips, available in just about every language on Earth, and the game is basically an Asterix comic with platforms on. You take control of the top two characters from the comics, Asterix and big fat wobbly Obelix. Asterix can perform all sorts of feats punching baddies and leaping chasms. Obelix can eat quite a lot and would probably be dead handy if you got challenged to pizza eating competition. Sadly though, you get attacked by vicious Romans and dangerous animals without a single Cheese and Tomato special in sight, so poor little Asterix had better get his skates on and save everyone! Isteri Asterix was always a fave of mine and this brings back lots of memories. The characters of Asterix and Obelix have been brought brilliantly to life in a real cartoon treat. The game is more than a little similar to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The graphics are superb. The animation of the main characters and the baddie sprites is amazing and the feel of the comic books has been transported perfectly to the Master System. Music is a bit crappy, but the sound effects are decent enough. Playability is there in oodles, with the two player mode being a real treat. One complaint about Asterix is that it's a bit too easy the levels themselves are fairly tough, but there aren't that many of them and the end of level bosses are fairly soft. For platform fans and followers of the Asterix books, this is unmissable. A groovy variation on the Mickey Mouse theme and a darn good looking game, this gets the thumbs up as a Master System treat to enjoy. FRANK O'CONNOR w wie MAU "

The potion endows anyone who drinks it with incredible fighting abilities and superhuman strength, which can come in a bit handy if you're a weak little shambler without any muscles at all. Asterix on the Master System? Naah. That can't be any good. How wrong I was. The first thing that hits you about this cart is the graohical style completely faithful to the comic books. They're so cool they really draw you into the game, which generally plays well apart from the odd screen glitch here and there. The game itself owes an awful lot to Mickey and Donald, but that's not a bad thing at all! There's an awful lot to see in the game, but but you do tend to see it a tad too soon because the difficulty level could have been increased for older players. That aside, this is one of the best recent releases I've seen for the Master System and if you enjoyed the Disney games you'll certainly get your money's worth from this, especially if you're not exactly the greatest player in the world. Fans of the annoying little Gaul will have a whale of a time! TIM BOONE Smack those Roman scum! 000UXU 391 LIDO GET Obelix gives the wall Glasgow kiss! Kerblamm! A potion explodes in the drink. You'll have to use them more carefully than that! Strange things are afoot at the camp! UNDERWATER ANTICS Asterix is not only a little hard bloke, he's also a champion swimmer. There are several underwater levels throughout the game where you get the chance to carry out some scuba related malarkey! The swimming technique is exactly the same as in the Mario games, where you press the jump button to gain speed and height. There are plenty of aquatic baddies to deal with under the water and even more points to be gained. Getting out of the water is the hard part though, 'cos the control method goes a bit haywire when you try to jump onto dry land. COOMOO BR. Kill the submerged Roman but don't waste the potion! SHORTY AND FATTY The two player mode in Asterix is a bit novel. One player controls Asterix and the other player controls Obelix, the big fat one. If one player gets killed, the other starts from the beginning of the level. If a player dies before he completes a level, the other dude has to take over and try to finish it. It all gets very confusing and you're never quite sure who's turn is next. In one player mode, you can choose either Asterix or Obelix at the start of a new level. Both have roughly the same abilities, although Asterix is a tad faster. Well, he would be, wouldn't he... MASTER SYSTEM 92 GREAT CARTOON HEROICS The Frenchies have only turned out two famous cartoon characters, Tintin and Asterix, but video games have been using cartoon heroes for ages. GRAPHICS Mickey Mouse and Spiderman are both available on the SOUNDS Master System and are both PLAYABILITY excellent portrayals of the characters. Batman fans can try out caped crusader antics on every machine except the Master System.

"PIEW DARK SEED PRE ** COD TUTO * 0 0 3105 med DARKSEED MIRAGE Now here's something a bit special! Fans of the Alien movies will Ispot these screenshots straight off as the work of H.R. Giger the artist who designed all those 'orible Alien thingies! Now he's been used as art consultant in one of the first releases from brand new software house Mirage, set to unleash Darkseed on an unsuspecting world very soon! As you can see from these shots the game looks absolutely stunning, featuring graphics so fab we almost fell of our chairs when we first saw 'em! In the game, a sort of animated art adventure, you play a sci-fi writer who buys a mysterious house and gets plagued by all sorts of weird and wonderful nightmares! The game features a fully digitised main character who moves in and out of the scenery in perspective together withy reflective metallic sprites and a \"three-way\" control system to come as close to virtual reality (or unreality!) as possible. Due for release soon on PC, with an Amiga conversion to follow later, this looks like one to watch out for. More news as soon as! VERSION PC AMIGA DATE TBA TBA PRICE  39.99   "

Well now you can, thanks to the boys at Ballistic all set to unleash Super Off Road onto the Megadrive!

We've seen a pre-production version of the cart and already it's looking the business. Up to two players will be able to race head to head around the eight tracks against computer controlled opponents As with the coin-op, a crucial factor of the game is earning cash to buy up goodies for your truck as you battle for first place and the chance for a hug from the beauty in the bathing suit!

"CD HUMANS MIRAGE The world's most gullible and bewildered inhabitants are not, as some people would have you believe, Lemmings. Nope, it turns out that dafter still are Humans. These daft little monkey descendants have finally reached the stone age and they're the main subject of the first game from new software house Mirage! The game is more than a bit like Psygnosis classic Lemmings you have to guide the hapless humans accross a hazard-filled landscape using their existing abilities to help them and these talents can be improved by \"inventing things. You'll have to invent fire which can be used to destroy obstacles S as well as warding off unruly dinosaurs and you'll find that the Humans have lots of different climbing abilities including ropes and ladders. Inventing the wheel can be handy you can roll it, ride it or just look at it if you like. Like Lemmings, the object of the game is to rescue as many characters from each level as possible you'll probably lose more than you save, but you can meet other Humans and make them join your group. Humans is looking very much like one to watch out for, and it's due to come out on just about every machine known to man! Watch this space for more details!

"PRE C 1991 SNK CORP Revolving SNK If you haven't played R-Type you can count yourself as a bit of a Ishambles who doesn't get out much. We forgive you though and we think that you should check out Last Resort from SNK. A blatant RType rip-off, this should be in arcades and Neo Geo importers by the time you read this. Last Resort tells the tale of a world invaded by twisted alien space-crustaceans. As a last resort (hence the title), Earth launches its secret weapon. The last resort is a pair of starfighters, top secret and very dangerous. The fighters are capable of recycling exploded enemy aircraft and turning them to good use. The ion collectors at the front of each ship turn the raw material into incredible weapons which include multiples, homing missiles and best of all, ripple lasers! This is the first real shooter that SNK have produced since ASO 2 and so it should cause a fair bit of interest. R-Type fans should love this and CVG will be the first there with a full review...watch the skies! VERSION DATE PRICE NEO GEO TBA  TBA uo The unit is equipped by choosing either the laser, homing or anti ground misske. The unit can be set in the rotational mode and can be moved in the revolving mode. Use \"B\" button to operate. Save the power by pressing \"A\" button continuously and the unit will be fired. The blue unit is reflected off the land and the red unit is moved along the land for a certain period. "

"PR CORPORATION VIRGIN This is the future. Advances in Robotics and computer technology have led to the Robot becoming a household item and one company has a monopoly on domestic and industrial Robots UCC. This massive corporate giant sells robots for everything from cleaning the bathroom to playing tennis. One area of robotics that has proved highly profitable is that of military hardware. Human lives are to valuable to expend in military conflict and droids are the soldiers of the future. UCC has a reputation for being reliable and friendly, but behind this seemingly pleasant facade lies a web of deceit and horror. Genetic engineering has long since been outlawed, mutations and deformities became far too common and the risk of super-viruses was too much. However, in your capacity as a top secret agent you've discovered that UCC has been messing around in the lab and their genetic research programme has doubled in size and intensity. It seems that UCC have discovered a way to combine organic elements with robotic parts to create il legal and dangerous cyborgs. Go get one and reveal UCC's deceit to the world in Virgin's Megadrive conversion of the Amiga classic! alks 5832 TUL OL OO TOT VERSION MEGADRIVE 00.00 iBCDEFGH  DATE TBA pamage EQUIPMENT PRICE   90000 EMEN Tame: SOLHER "


"face of your character. A polygon face rotates incredibly smoothly as a panel containing your at tributes is displayed. The vectors look very impressive indeed and almost identical to the Amiga orig. inal, the only difference being the absence of striplights on the ceiling! ties and different items are required for different characters. You can only carry a limited amount of equipment and this of course de pends on your strength and stamina. Humans, for example, will need to carry medical kits and glucose drinks to keep them fit, while androids need only replacement microchips for repairs. THE TEAM.. This is definitely a solo mission, but you can choose your favourite character from a list of six. There are two androids, two men and two women. Each character has their own attributes and you'll have to decide which hero is best suited to the task of invading the UCC complex. You have various characteristics for each of the members, which include strength, stamina, intelligence and mechanical skills, Medical abilities and combat skills are also very important. Choosing a different player can affect the game completely making it different each time you play * Of ness. You carry a central battery around which feeds all the equipment. When power starts to run low, you'll have to look around for a power point. You simply plug in your cable and wait around until you're fully recharged. This is a good way to charge up the power hungry gun and you can also access security terminals at these points. Use your security card to access otherwise restricted areas. VECTOR RELATED MIRTH The graphics, unusually for a Megadrive are mostly vector drawn. This gives an impressive illusion of reality and adds real atmosphere to the proceedings. The main baddies are all sprites which scale (through clever animation) as they approach you. One really impressive graphic is the animation used to portray the The weapons at your disposal are very impressive indeed and include stun grenades, explosives and the standard machine gun. Other equipment includes jet packs gas masks and intra red visors. Human players can buy bionic limbs to increase their performance. Smart ind ORGANIC NASTIES The UCC building is packed full of nasty surprises, not least of which are the cyborg monsters. These weird combinations of animal and robot can pop up at any time and have to be dispatched quickly. There are lots of variations on this theme, but easily the scariest of them all, is the Ripper This evil green monster has been so badly designed that its brain has rolted and as a result it's totally psychotic. Nothing short of a nuclear explosion will stop this critter so you'd better be careful... KITTING THEM OUT Once you've chosen a character you'll have to equip him, her or it. The list of equipment is extensive POWER UP!
