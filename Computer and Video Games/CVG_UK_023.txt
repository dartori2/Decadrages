"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETE WIN ,000 IN IF YOU WANT OUR GRAND TO GET AHEAD! PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE! You've always thought that your programming skills could earn you a lot of money. Come on, don't be modest, you know you have! All you need is a bit of luck and a really exciting program and an entry form for Computer and Video Games' ,000 Computer Program Competition... The prize money is on offer from Calisto Software of Birmingham, who want to uncover Britain's brightest programming talents. Calisto are keen to expand the number of home computers they can offer software for, and encourage home-grown talent instead of simply shipping games in from the States. The experts reckon it takes three months to write a good games program so that's just what you've got. Your program must be at the Calisto office not later than October 16th. If you are going to polish up one of your previous efforts, then why not send it quickly and get started on another program. You can enter as many programs as you like as long as each comes with an entry form cut from the magazine and there will be another form in our October issue. There's a chance for everyone to be a winner in this competition as Calisto will be giving out software contracts to the designers of games they want to market. So even if you don't end up ,000 richer straight away, you could still find the royalties rolling in if you become part of Calisto's team of software writers. And that may turn out to be worth even more than ,000 for you. You can enter on any popular microcomputer. All cassettes will be tested by Calisto's team of judges. If your offering is picked as the winner, you'll be presented with a cheque for ,000 at the Brainwave '83, a new home computer show in the NEC Birmingham in the first week of November. To enter, simply fill in the form below and attach it to a cassette of the game. Make sure you fill in all the details about yourself and your game on the form. If the game instructions are not included on the cassette itself, then add them on a separate piece of paper but please ensure that your name and address are included on every part of your entry. The winner will be the reader who comes up with the best commercial program and Calisto will take it on and market it on a royalties basis. The judging time is limited so get your entry in as quickly as possible but be sure that your program is properly polished first, to give yourself a good chance of coming away ,000 richer. Entries should be sent to: ,000 Program, Calisto Software, 119 John Bright Street, Birmingham Bl IBE. And remember the deadline is October 16th, so get cracking! Alan Outter should be unrecognisable at the next fancy dress party he goes to because he'll be dressed as Aughra from the Dark Crystal film. A hot hairy head has been packaged up and sent on its way to Alan of Cleveland Road, West Ealing, London along with a marvellous coffee table book featuring artist Brian Frood's designs for the film's fantastic characters, an LP of the soundtrack and a T-shirt. In our May issue we asked you to send a program (or a screen picture) of one of the characters from the fantasy film, The Dark Crystal The competition was judged by Bruce McNally the creative director of Henson Associates, makers of the Dark Crystal and also famous for the careers of Miss Piggy and Kermit in the Muppets. Bruce was so impressed with the high standard of entry, that he persuaded Henson Associates to look out four more of Brian Frood's books and these will be going to the four runners-ups. But head and shoulders above the rest was Alan's head and shoulders picture of Dark Crystal hero Jed the Gelfling holding a torch. It was produced through a mammoth series of data statements which must have taken him days to key into the micro. We'll be reproducing the listing (for anybody brave enough to try it) in The Computer & Video Games Yearbook 1983. The runners-up were: Robert Kerr Snoulton of Hurstdene Road, Bournemouth on the 48K Spectrum; R. Everett of Bleak Hey Road, Peel Hall, Wythenshawe on the Dragon 32; David Eaton of 57 Dawlish Road, Selly Oak, Birmingham on the Atari and Tancred Wells, Elfindale Road, Herne Hill, London SE24 on the Vic-20.

Julian, pictured above with Taitel's brand new Gyruss machine used for the grand final, defeated 18 other video-wizards to claim the title. You can read all about our new champion and how he trained for the title on the next page. These pictures show just some of the action from the championship finals held at Xenon, the top London nightclub. If you didn't make it to the finals this year never fear just keep practising on your favourite machine and who knows, next year you may be stepping into Julian's shoes. Meanwhile let's hear it for our Arcade Champ! 1983 ARCADE GAMES CHAMPIONSHIPS GAMES CHAMPION "


"Eighteen arcade aces gathered at a plush London night spot last month to battle it out for the coveted title of Computer and Video Games Arcade Games Champion of 1983. Worthy winner was 18-year-old Julian Rignall of Tregaron in Dyfed. Julian clocked an amazing 73,100 points on Gyruss a brand new machine to take the title. Gyruss was officially launched at the championships and had hitherto not been seen or played by the finalists. After a briefing from Taitel's Paul Moriarty the six finalists had just 10 minutes each to achieve their highest possible score on the new machine. This ten minute ruling was in line with the preliminary heats which were played on six machines ‚Äî Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Junior, Mr Do, Robotron, Amidar, and Defender. The lucky winner took back a coffee table style Galaga arcade game with him to Wales courtesy of co-sponsors Taitel. There were also prizes for the runners up in the shape of five super new hand-held versions of Donkey Kong Junior courtesy of Computer Games Limited, the people behind the game and watch craze. Radio Luxembourg DJ Tony Prince was on hand to unveil the new machine and Radio One's Dave Lee Travis came along later to present the prizes to the winners and commemorative certificate to all the finalists. The venue was Xenon in Piccadillyone of London's most fashionable night spots and a favourite haunt of tennis stars last month during Wimbledon. All expenses were paid by C&VG and some of the finalists also appeared on BBC TV's Breakfast Time. This year's Computer and Video Games Arcade champ is 18-year-old Julian Rignall from Llangeitho in Dyfed. But before you Welsh readers start jumping up and down and singing Land of My fathers I have to tell you that Julian is actually English. He moved with his family to Wales seven years ago from Stevenage in Hertfordshire. Since making the move, Julian become fluent in Welsh since Dyfed is one of the few remaining totally Welsh speaking areas of the country. He lives in the heart of the countryside with his parents and brother Jonathon. The surrounding hills make it virtually impossible to pick up television broadcasts so Julian spends a lot of his spare time playing video games. Even this takes a bit of effort in Llangeitho a trip of twenty miles to the Royal Pier at Aberystwyth. Trips to the pier are not just games afternoons for Julian MEET THE CHAMPION as he meets his friends here as well. An average day at the pier consists of a couple of hours on the Defender machine just to get warmed up then a stroll and possibly a coffee at a friends house and then back to the pier. \"I'm always the last to leave they always wait for me to finish off. At the moment I'm trying to learn Donkey Kong Junior, but it's always Defender I come back to. I never seem to get bored with that. It's totally random and no matter how good your are at it there's always something you didn't expect. I have a sort of respect for the aliens!\" Sometimes Julian's Mum pops in to the pier from her antique stall in the market. \"She's a Pac-Man freak and not a bad player.\" Julian's little brother Jonathon sometimes acompanies him to the pier. \"He's into gambling he's so lucky. I am trying to coach him on Defender.\" Julian is currently studying for A levels at school and wants to be a graphic designer. \"I'd like to design the cabinets for video games machines and perhaps even the games themselves.\" The quiet life in Llangeitho is going to be little less tranquil in the near future when Julian takes delivery of his prize from Taitel. Final comment from Julian. \"I'm going to enter the championships again next year and I expect to turn in a pretty unbeatable score on Galaga.\" Julian the champ with Dave Lee Travis The six finalists in the 1983 championships ranged in age from fourteen to twenty. Youngest of the super six was Donkey Kong specialist Mark Neale, 14, from Bournemouth in Dorset. Mark managed an ape-crunching 569,400 points at Boscombe Pier to qualify for the championships. He's been playing video games for three years but also enjoys cycling, astronomy and map reading. Mark was one of the entrants interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast Time show on the morning of the competition. His ambition in life is to become a top cyclist and win the Milk Race. Also from the south coast was Daniel Curant, 20, a civil servant from Southampton. Daniel came through from the Donkey Kong Junior heats. His other hobbies include a wide variety of sports but especially ten pin bowling. His qualifying 107,200 on Donkey Kong Junior was achieved at the Maybush pub. The Bamber Gascoigne of the top six was Kevin Wetherell, a student at Bristol University where he is reading for a BA in Social History. Kevin is from Purley in Surrey and also enjoys playing golf and reading science fiction. His 409,900 qualifying score on Mr. Do was scored at the Students Union bar in Bristol. The highest score we received this year was scored by 15 year old David Ross who clocked an incredible 11 million on Robotron at an arcade in Shanklin, Isle of Wight. David's ambition is to write a game for C&VG and one day design the world's best game. The man with the high score on Amidar is another university student. James Thomas, 18, from Fishguard, in Dyfed clocked up 421,790 at Bennet's Tavern in his home town. Currently studying geology at Leicester, James intends to go into the computing business when he leaves university. Photographs: Linda Freeman COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 25 "

Hopper ($9.95) is a game on cassette which can be played with either keyboard or joysticks. Hop the frog across the busy motorway trying to avoid four lanes of fast-moving traffic. To get across the river to the frog's lair you must leap on to the logs and turtles' backs. but beware of the diving turtles, the crocodile and the snake.

"ed verture u chochu In days of old when knights were bold they just loved to have a battle. And when a fire-breathing Dragon wasn't available the next best thing was to go and lay siege to your next-door neighbours' castle for a few weeks Taking along your loyal retainers and trusty rockcatapult you'd trudge off and pitch camp outside the castle and wait for the poor chap inside to give-up or start eating rats. You don't have to sit around for months, braving all the elements. Your siege will last just 30 seconds! And if you fail to win the castle within that time it's back to Dragon hunting. You'll see a castle with defenders appearing on the battlements and at windows. You are armed with your trusty catapult and have to fire at the defenders in a bid to wipe them all out. If you manage to knock out all the defenders within the 30 second time limit then the castle is conquered. You have to be quick on the draw as the defenders move about rapidly. The number of defenders is governed by the difficul ty level you chose at the start of each game. You aim the catapult by moving the sight with keys Q, W, E, A, D, Z, X and C. The weapon is fired using the S key. o 1530 NEXTL 1540 PRINT\" 1550 FORAS=1T010: MUSIC\"CO\": NEXTAS 1570 S=S+1:IFSND-1 THEN1610 1580 IFS > 1 THENM$ SPLATTER !!! 1590 PRINT\"HYOU'VE ELIMINATED\";S:M$ 1600 GOTO1310 1610 Z=54021 1620 FORYT=1T04 MEN\" 1630 POKEZ+YT, O 1640 MUSIC\"BOCOBOCO\" 1650 NEXTYT 1660 Z=2-40: FORO=1T0400: NEXTO 1670 IFZ 53901 THEN1620 1700 GOTO2030 1709 REM ** THE CASTLE * * 1710 PRINT\" 1720 PRINT\" 1730 PRINT 1740 PRINT 1750 PRINT\" 1760 PRINT\" 1770 PRINT\" NEDER 1780 PRINT\" 1790 PRINT\" 1800 PRINT\" 1810 PRINT!! 1820 PRINT 1830 PRINT\" 1840 PRINT 1850 PRINT\" THIRURILE...... 1860 PRINT\" 1870 PRINT\" .. 1880 PRINT\" HIIHHHHH 1890 PRINT\" 1900 PRINT\" 1910 PRINT\" ( YYYYXODUS 1920 RETURN 1925 REM DATA FOR MAN'S POSITION 1930 DATAS3333, 53335, 53337,53350 1940 DATAS3352, 53354,53518, 53554 1950 DATAS3550, 53501,53533, 53621 1960 DATAS3701,53699,53703, 53705 1970 DATA53707,53814.53818,53829 1980 DATAS3833 WITHIN 2030 PRINT YOU MANAGED TO KILL\";S: M$: 2035 TEMPO3: FORO=1 T02 2040 MUSIC \"CODOEOFOGOAOBOCODOEOFOGOAOBO\" 2050 NEXTO 2060 PRINT\"99932E * DO YOU WANT TO PLAY AGAIN ** 2070 GETVU$: IFVU$=\"\"THEN2070 2080 IFVU$=\"N\" THENEND 2085 RUN 2008 PRINT\" I'M SORRY, BUT YOU RAN OUT OF TI 2100 FOROL=1 TO2000: NEXTOL 2110 GOTO2035 30 SECONDS Illustration: Terry Rogers COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 49 "

"STARA \"Captain, we are picking up enemy ships on the starboard scanner. They are in battle formation and heading this way!\" How would you cope with becoming captain of the Starship Enterprise? Would you be able to boldly go in search of nasty Klingons and blast them beyond the final frontier? The Klingon menace has finally invaded the Dragon and to cope with the alien attack the micro has summoned, Captain James T. Kirk and his crew. They have to travel the Dragon sector of the galaxy destroying Klingons wherever they find them. You have access to all the Enterprise controls. Warp drive is there to power you on your quest as are the photon torpedoes and phasers ready to deal death and destruction to the alien hoardes. Just in case the Klingons have the nerve to fire back at you your ship is protected by energy shields. Should you run low on energy you can stock up at a friendly starbase. There are three levels of difficulty, from beginner to expert, and comprehensive instructions are printed in the program. BY PAUL JACKSON AND JON HUNT 10 ***STAR TREK BY P.

What are you going to do? Look for the exit as quickly as possible that's what! Your ZX81 will create a devious 3D maze and challenge you to escape before time runs out. You can also create your own mazes or change existing ones. Each maze is stored in binary as a combination of 144 Os and 1s. 1 signifies a wall and 0 a passage. When programming a new maze it is best to plan it out on a 12 by 12 grid first.

"HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN A MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURE RECENTLY? If so, it is quite probable that you are presently suffering from TIS, more commonly known as Total Involvement Syndrome. TIS manifests itself in a number of ways, one of the most dramatic symptoms being a victim's complete inability to feg at ease in the world of reality. Other symptoms include insomnia, a desparate need to play a Mysterious Adventure, an an overwhelming sense of acute enjoyment. Experts believe that TIS is usually contracted as a result of prolonged exposure to Mysterious Adventures, this is commonly caused by owning any of the following Home Computers:48K SPECTRUM, BBC MODEL A OR B, TRS80, COLOUR GENIE, ATARI 400/800, COMMODORE 64, DRAGON 32, 16K ZX81, LYNX etc. When questioned about this epidemic, a representative of DIGITAL FANTASIA, a company who are actively involved in research and development work on Mysterious Adventures said, \"There is probably no cure for TIS other than mains failure, faulty RAM chips etc. which can be at best only a Temporary solution\". \"In the absence of a more permanent cure, I would advise TIS sufferers to submit to the Syndrome and obtain Mysterious Adventures from any sources available to them\". \"TIS is highly contagious and in view of the current Worldwide Epidemic, I would say enjoy it while you can, resistance is futile\". If you have a BBC Computer or a 48K SPECTRUM, you can obtain Mysterious Adventures direct from DIGITAL FANTASIA in any of the following dosages. 1) THE GOLDEN BATON 2) THE TIME MACHINE 5) ESCAPE FROM PULSAR 7 8) THE WIZARD AKYRZ 3) ARROW OF DEATH (PART 1) 6) CIRCUS 9) PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA 4 ARROW OF DEAT 7) FEASIBILITY EXPERIMENT 10) TEN LITTLE INDIANS Each Dose costs .95 including V.A.T. and Postage.

Venture through a rocky tunnel, brave the deadly minefield in space, fight off alien invaders and find your way to your ultimate goal the rainbow passage. This is a game with five different challenges which gets more difficult as you move towards your final objective. The first challenge is a rocky tunnel deep within the heart of a lost asteroid. Steer your ship through the many twists and turns of the tunnel avoiding the walls and outcrops of rocks. Once through the tunnel you'll find yourself in a space minefield. Dodge the blasts as the mines explode around you! Then comes the hyperspace sector. Steer through a tunnel and use your hyperspace control to avoid obstacles. Then come the invaders! Dodge them and you'll be ready to encounter the rainbow passage. There are nine skill levels to play with 1 being the easiest. Are you brave enough to take up the challenge of VicQuest?

"BY G. DUNNET RUNS ON AN ATOM IN 2K Crawling from the dark recesses of the gamesters mind comes The Bug. Horrible isn't it! No, don't call in the local pest officer -he wouldn't be able to cope with this particular creature. Only you can stop it sneaking away under the skirting board. The segmented alien crawls across a screen filled with obstacles. Using your laser base you must attempt to destroy the invading insect before it reaches you. Points are scored by whittling away the segments of the bug before finally performing the coup de grace on the head. The bug moves faster each time you destroy a segment. You score 50 points for each segment and 250 when the head is destroyed. Your score is displayed at the top of the screen, along with how many lives you have left. If you find the sound gets irritating it can be removed by omitting Link VV1 in line 2040. Control keys are: '1' to move left, '2' to move right, space bar to fire.

"MACHINE CODE SLA cGA RL/RLA SRA GETTING OUT OF A SPIN! We are going to look at a group of instructions that, like the logical instructions featured in the last article, operate directly on bits. These are Shift and Rotate instructions that move the bits in a byte one place to the left or right, and the operation of the various instructions available on the 6502, 6809 and 280 are shown in the diagrams Before going on to look at what you can use these instructions for we will take a closer look at the instructions on the individual processors. EC RLC/RLCA SRL RR/RRAA RLD MEMORY RRC/ RRCA RRD FC MEMORY the sign and zero flags are set according to the results of the operation. INITIALS TO REMEMBER 6502 There are four shift and rotate mnemonics, ASL (Arithmetic Shift Left), LSR (Logical Shift Right, ROR (ROtate Right), ROL ROtate Left), which can all be used in five addressing modes, Accumulator, Absolute, Zero page, Absolute indexed by X, and Zero page indexed by X The assembly language source forms are: ASL A ASL address; 16 bit address ASL address; 8 bit zero page address ASL address, X; 16 bit address ASL address, X, 8 bit zero page address and similarly for the other three mnemonics. In the accumulator addressing mode (which can only be used with these four mnemonics) it is the accumulator that is shifted or rotated, in the other addressing modes the memory location indicated by the operand is shifted or rotated. Note that the pairs ASL and LSR, and ROR and ROL work identically except for the direction of movement, and that the bit that is moved out of the byte goes into the carry flag. The result of the operation, replaces the original operand, in the accumulator or memory according to the addressing mode. As well as the carry flag being set by the bit that is moved out of the operand the sign and zero flags are set according to the result of the operation. 6809 The rotate and shift instructions on the 6809 are very similar to those of the 6502, and the ASL, LSR, ROL and ROR BY TED BALL instructions do exactly the same as the corresponding mnemonics on the 6502 LSL (locical Shift Left) is just a different name for ASL and both mnemonics give the same object code. The other 6809 instructions, ASR (Arithmetic Shift Right), is similar to LSR, but leaves bit seven (the most significant bit) of the operand unchanged. ASL LSL, ASR, LSR, ROL and ROR can be used with direct, extended, and all indexed and indirect addressing modes. The operation is performed on the contents of the memory location indicated by the operand and the result is written back into the same memory location. For shift and rotate operations on the accumulators A an B we have the inherent mode mnemonics ASLA, ASLB, LSLA, LSLB, ASRA, ASRB, LSRA, LSRB, ROLA, ROLB, ROR, RORB. As well as the carry flag being set by the bit that is moved out of the operand, CHANGE OF ADDRESS... Z80 The shift and rotate mnemonics can be used with the following addressing modes: RR register; register is one of A, B, C, D, E, H, L RR (HL) RR (IX + d); d is an eight bit displacement RR (IY + d); d is and eight bit displacement. and similarly for RRC, RL, RLC, SLA, SRA, SRL Note that RR and RL perform a nine bit rotation (the eight bits of the operand plus the carry flag) while RRC and RLC 106 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"IMACHINE ICODE perform an eight bit rotation on the operand and copy the original bit o (RRC) or bit seven (RLC) into the carry flag. As well as the carry flag, RR, RRC, RL, RLC, SLA, SRA and SRL set the sign, zero and parity/overflow flags according to the result of the operation. These shift and rotate instructions, as well as the logical instructions we looked at last month, treat the P/O flag as a parity flag. The value of the P/O flag is calculated from the number of ls or Os in the eight bit result of the operation: if there is an ls or Os the P/O flag becomes 1 and if there is an even number of ls or Os the P/O flag becomes The number of ls and the number of Os in a byte must both be odd or both be even because there is a total of eight bits. The main use for parity is in data communications, where parity can be used to check whether a character or a block of data has been transmitted correctly For example, there are 128 ASCII characters so we need seven bits to represent an ASCII character. If we are transmitting eight bit bytes the extra bit can be calculated so that every byte has, say, even parity, and then if a byte with odd parity was received we would know that there had been an error in transmission. A single parity bit only allows us to detect a one bit error, but with more parity bits and a more complicated method of encoding the signals it is possible to detect errors of two or more bits and even to correct some errors. The instructions RL register, RLC reg. ister, RR register, RRC register, include RL A, RLC A, RR A, RRC A (note the spaces). But there separate instructions RLA, RLCA RRA, RRCA (no spaces). Although the two forms have the same effect on the accumulator and the carry flag there are two differences. The most important difference is in the effect on the flags. RL A, etc (with space) effect the carry, sign, zero and parity/overflow flags, but RLA, etc (without space) affect only the carry flag and leave the other flags unchanged. The other difference is in the object code for the instructions. The object code for RL A, etc. is two bytes, while the object code for RLA, etc is only one byte, taking up less space and executing faster. Another point to notice is that although most of the shift and rotate instructions come in corresponding left and right pairs, there is no SLL instruction corresponding to the SRL instruction. SLL was designed into the 280 but is not documented because it did not work correctly in all cases. Some assemblers for small microcomputers will accept SLL and other undocumented instructions but it is not wise to use them. Although these un documented instructions may appear to work there is no guarantee that they will work properly with all operands or on all 280 microprocessors. The two instructions RLD (Rotate Left Digit) and RRD (Rotate Right Digit) rotate by four places at once, between the least significant four bits of the accumulator and the memory location whose address is in the HL register pair. In the diagram for RLD, p, q, r and s each represent four bits, and after the RLD instruction was executed A would contain pr and the memory location would contain sq. One use of the shift and rotate instructions is for multiplication and division The simplest case is multiplication or division of small unsigned numbers by a power of two which just requires shifting left for multiplication or shifting right for division. A single arithmetic shift left multiplies a byte by two, arithmetic shift left twice multiplies by four, etc, and similarly arithmetic shift right divides by two, arithmetic shift right twice divides by four, etc. It is a little more complicated if you are dealing with signed binary numbers or numbers that take up more than one byte, but these cases are still fairly simple. In general, multiplication requires a combination of shifts and additions, while division requires a combination of shifts and subtractions, ASL ca ASL/LSL co + ASR LSR EC LSR ROL SEC ROL ROR C ROR 9 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 107 "


"STASTEROIDS ‚Äî SPECTRUM Congratulations to Grant Wastle of Dunfirmline for being the first to earn  from the Bug Hunter for his tip about Stasteroids for the Spectrum which appeared in our April issue. To convert the game for use with Kempston joysticks the following alterations need to be made Line 1030 Remove I=INKEY$ and everything after it on that line, then add 1035 LET I$ INKEYS:LET D=D+ (1$=\"4\" OR I$=\"6\" OR I$= \"5\" AND D<21) -($=\"8\" OR I$=\"0\" OR I$=\"9\" AND D>1) bers scrolling up the screen. Now press a key for a second and the numbers will change. The number shown is the code for the key being pressed, so use this routine to find four convenient keys to use in the game, and their code numbers. Then you can add these keys to the game by substituting the numbers in lines 102, 104, 105 and 107. These four lines are respectively up, left, right and down. For example, Z is code 33, so to use Z to move left, change line 104 to IF X= ... Note that the X at the start of the line does not change. HUNTER METEOR ‚Äî /4a Meteor for the T199/4a in July puzzled a few people in the area around line 2970. The line is confusing because of the way it was split for printing. The end of line 2970 continues, in case you haven't already spotted it, on the next line which looks as though it's line 2980 but isn't! Write to me at Bug Hunter, Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5JB. DRAUGHTS ‚Äî ATARI Our offering to Atari owners in June was a Draughts program, which caused some tearing of hair, especially when it came to line 109. The telephones buzzed with the sound of \"I can't get line 109 to fit in\". I've dug out the original tape and it loaded perfectly into our Atari 800. I'll write to Mr Solanki to ask him the secret but in the mean time the best way round the problem is to put the first five characters from line 109 on to the end of the numbers in 108, which will work. SUBSTRIKE ‚Äî T199/4a A crisp fiver is on its way across the Channel to Belgium, to Roger Kokken for his suggestion on adding a high score feature to June's Substrike program for the T199/4a. The program should be altered as follows 840 AFTER \"score\"; score... add:: DISPLAY at (1, 19): \"HISCORE\": HISCORE and then insert these lines... 1031 IF SCORE>HISCORE THEN 1032 ELSE 1033 1032 HISCORE=SCORE 1033 DISPLAY AT (1,19): \"HISCORE\": HISCORE Type in the first program and save it on a cassette. When saved, do not rewind the tape. Turn off the machine to clear the program from memory. Turn the machine back on and type in the second program. Save this on the tape straight after the first program. Turn the machine on and off again. To play the game, load in the first program and leave the tape recorder running. The first program will do its job and will then load the second program in straight after, overwriting the first program in the process. You will usually find that the first program ends in a LOAD statement for this purpose. GROW WORM ATARI Going back a couple of issues, there may still be problems with Grow Worm for the Atari 400/800 from May. Line 4 is a screen clear character and can be replaced with 4 PRINT CHR$(125). The bracket in line 30 is the same character and can be substituted with PRINT #6; CHR$(125). KRAZY KONG SPECTRUM J. Burton of Cleveleys, Lancs, claims his  with a correction to Krazy Kong in July's issue, for the Spectrum. If you walk over a plug from right to left, he says, then you fall down the hole because the plug is removed before you move on one space. To remedy this, the following lines should be added 90 IF ATTR (A+1,B) = 110 THEN PRINT AT A+1,B: INK 7\" \"LET P = P+1: LET SC = SC 100 LET B = B-1 Then change line 92 to the same as 90 but replace B-B-1 with B=B+1. TIPS FOR THE ORIC This month's tip comes from the Tangerine Users Group. To remove the CAPS from the top right hand corner of the screen, simply type POKE 48035,0 and it will disappear. This works by putting a black INK character in position 1 before the \"C\" of CAPS. GHOST TRAPVIC 20 Ghost Trap, for the Vic, used Z and X to move left and right, although the instructions from the author said to use the cursor keys. If confusion still reigns over the program then clear the machine and enter the following routine. 10PRINT PEEK(197): GOTO 10 Run this program and you'll see numSPLITTING THE VIC The practice of splitting Vic-20 programs into two parts to enable them to run in 3.5k still causes problems. The basic (sorry!) idea is that when user defined graphics or machine code is set up using data statements, the data lines are used only once to alter the memory. Once they have done their job, they may be erased, leaving the graphics safely in memory out of the way of the main program. This is why some Vic games are split; one program is used to set up the graphics, and can then be erased. This then leaves a full 3.5k for the main program to use. To enter such a program is simple If you want to speak to me about Bug Hunter or you have a query about a listing in C&VG, then dial 01-278 3881 and ask for me, but please keep calls between 9.30 and 5.30 otherwise I'll never get home in time for Coronation Street (now there's an idea for a game!). Alterations to programs are best done through the post; scribbling reams of Basic listings from the 'phone is prone to error to say the least. Remember that tips and hints pub lished in Bug Hunter will each earn  but you must be prepared to accept feedback from myself and from readers if it doesn't do exactly what it's supposed to BY ROBERT SCHIFREEN 108 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"COMPUTATION At the particular combination of Grange Hill and Dotheboys Hall where Ivan Potts keeps tenuous control of the blackboard it is his custom to gain respite at the end of term by setting a calculating task well beyond the mental capacities of his charges. As they flounder through a morass of tedious computations he makes the major decision which will govern their future just how nasty a crack he can put on each report without infringing the laws of libel. This term's problem is easily stated: The digits 1 to 9 are to be used twice each to form six 3-digit numbers. Each number then scores points equal to the sum of all its factors from 2 to 99 inclusive. A prime number scores 200 points. Thus 126 would score 2+3+6+7+9+14+18+21+42+63 185 points. To find the arrangement of digits which will produce the six numbers scoring the highest possible aggregate of points was a task, Potts believed, BY TREVOR TRURAN guaranteed to ensure classroom quiet for a couple of months! But he had not reckoned with Anthony Stubbs who, in a spare lunchtime, knocked up a computer program to do the tedious work and then sold copies of the answer to his classmates for 10p. Can you put your own machine to work and also save yourself 10p as well as stand a chance to win a prize by working out which six numbers should be chosen and how many points they score? We are offering the revolutionary Kodak Disc 4000 camera to the first three readers out of the hat with the correct answer. Entries should be with us by September 16th. Mark your envelopes Computation Puzzle. The camera is fully automatic and has a built in flash and an electric motor which advances the disc film after every shot The outfit comes complete with two Kodacolour disc films, metal snake chain wrist strap and instruction booklet. 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 NUMBER 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 SCORE SPITTING SMOKING SHIRKING SHOUTING TRIPLE CUT TOTAL Taking six children on a summer picnic is asking for trouble even when you have made sure that the cake is decorated with twelve strawberries and six iced stars. Young X-ray vision eyes will burn into your hand as you try to make sure all six pieces are of identical size and contain two strawberries and one iced star each. the number of E's and third, the number of I's. Thus one across uses four of the letters in that line, one E and one I. The direction of one letter is given to you and, with a little thought, the direction of many of the others can be worked out. Can you find all fourteen words and the obvious connecting theme? Po WORDWISE Fourteen words, all related by an extremely common theme, have been reduced to their constituent letters. Each line, across and down, contains, amongst others, letters which will form a word. Each letter is used once only, either in the across word or the down word but not both. When a line contains the same letter more than once there is no ambiguity as to which to use the word in that line either uses all occurrences of the letter or none of them. You may have noticed that the grid contains no vowels which could be a drawback to finding the words. However, we can tell you that the only vowels required are E's and I's. The number at the end of each line tells you first, the number of consonants, second, 310 The demand from Little Einstein that you achieve this in just three straight cuts is probably the final straw to break a saint's patience (though your suggestion that he make a daisy chain and hang it on the hors of that lovely cow in the next field must be viewed with Conce).

Patiently he waited for them to return. At last they all filed into the room and he motioned the company to sit down. They did, except for Lord Ealaudie who continued to lie on the library floor supporting a dagger of Birmingham design in his ample paunch \"The diagram please, Watson,\" said Holmes. \"Here you are, Holmes. As you requested, I've placed each person where they were before the murder was committed,\" said Dr Watson. \"Ah yes,\" mused Holmes. \"It is apparent that you all then moved to a different place and either through fear of mistakenly implicating either yourself or someone you hold dear, you refuse to disclose your position when the murder occurred.\" \"However, at least one truthful fact has been elicited from each of you ‚Äî the number of doors you passed through to get to your destination. Add those by the name of each person on the chart, Watson.\" \"Already done, Holmes,\" replied his trusted companion. \"Because of the extreme weather certain doors were propped open and others kept closed to keep a refreshing draught flowing around the house,\" Holmes went on. \"You have all stated that you took the route which required you to pass through the fewest number of doors and that no one opened a closed door.\" The company nodded, again with the exception of His Lordship. \"According to Mrs Nutting, the housekeeper, who had just returned from the village and was on the drive when the crime was committed, Ferris, the gardener was not in the Smoking Room and that it was not a member of the house who was in the Study. On opening the front door she observed that the Hall was empty. \"We can, I believe, accept the veracity of the visiting Parson Snows, who states that he did not go outside when he changed rooms. The only other visitor, Farmer Nure, prefers not to be able to recall where he went.\" Holmes pursed his lips for a moment then drew forth a sovereign. He tossed it to Watson. \"There you are, my good fellow. A wager that you cannot identify the person who went into the Library and inserted the iron into His Lordship!\" Watson, as ever, failed to win, but you gentle reader can work out just who done it. Can't you? THE DOOR TO DOOR POSER It was some months before the local children would visit the house where Lord Ealaudie had seen, and felt, the point. And when they did venture in, finding it exactly the same as on the day of the crime, it was only to run in and out through the open doors. Later, following a surfeit of watching a television programme which advised them to turn it off and do something interesting, it was suggested that they try to find a way to go through every open doorway exactly once. Try as they might, it seemed impossible (which it is). Someone will have to pluck up the nerve to open one of those closed doors. Which door should be opened and where must they then start and end their run? ajeadsaxeys kq shejd jo sap ay u buuin330 SPJOM IIV :3W3HI ax!I SOAIM MI Mays 146u waw ayl NMOD \"?!

"AL GADVENURSMinihub UPSIDE DOWN BY THE CHANDELIER! Never quite at ease with Hobbit, too impatient for the prompt in Pimania, at last I have found a Spectrum Adventure to rank with Philospher's Quest and Lords of Karma to name but two. I talk of Dungeon Adventure for the 48k Spectrum from Level 9 Computing of High Wycombe. A small booklet describes the background to the scenario of the Demon Lord of Minas Tirith, and what brought you to find yourself on a mudbank by a large empty packing case. There are many mysterious routes to explore. One route took me to a lightning storm on a steep hill, where I was challenged to a dice game by the Rakshasa. Some you win ‚Äî some you lose! At one stage I was attracted by a lone girl sitting on an island, and after some difficulty managed to reach her. I also came across a strange cubic machine with a rather too obvious button, in a store room. A treasure for rescuing the waif? Sudden death by pressing the button? I wondered, tried, and am not going to tell you! Expect the unexpected in Dungeon Adventure! Overall, the game is logical, but some commands have totally unexpected results! Try anything outrageously irrelevant if the obvious gets you nowhere! For the Adventurer who gets stuck, part of the package includes a stamped addressed envelope entitling the purchaser to one free clue. A nice touch this, as is the warning not to use your clue up too soon, lest you solve the problem in the meantime and then get stuck on something more difficult! So, readers, use your free clue up before you turn to the last resort ‚Äî yours truly! My mailbag is already full to bursting point ‚Äî and I need time for Adventuring too! And if you do write to Adventure Helpline, do let me in on your first question and answer! It will be interesting to see if most Dungeon players get stuck in the same place! I found Dungeon exceedingly well planned and written, with a fast response. There are well over 200 locations, and the descriptions are both lengthy and interesting. The objects number about 100. It could therefore take some months to explore the whole network, giving many hours of enjoyment in the process. I could only fault this game on one point. Where, oh where, did that cursor go?! ENTER THE UNKNOWN The Dragon is a computer for which the range of software available is not immense. There is a temptation, therefore, for the Adventure enthusiast with a Dragon computer to eagerly buy any Adventure game that he comes across. If you are such, then it is only fair to warn you not to bother with Forbidden City from Apex Trading of Brighton. The game is set on a planet with a Forbidden City, in which, the intro reads, there may be hidden treasure. You start in a location described as \"OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE TO THE CITY FACING THE LOCKED GATE\". So let's start playing: TAKE INVENTORY A key LOOK AROUNDI don't understand the noun ENTER GATE I don't understand the verb GO CITYI don't understand the noun OPEN GATE I don't understand the noun UNLOCK GATE I don't understand the verb INSERT KEY Rather suddenly:Location: In a corridor HELP Look and examine things EXAMINE CORRIDORI don't understand the noun And so on-until in desperation you take one of the exit routes, described in abbreviated form as N, S,W, E etc, but not recognised as such. Many of these lead to death by means such as deep pits and wall crushing chambers, which just happen, for no apparent reason, to be there. With no warning or reason given, one's powers of deduction could not be used to solve problems to detect any potential trouble. There were no problems (except in trying to fathom out if any of the words used in the game were recognised by the game) it was all a question of blundering through by brute force and ignorance. An incredibly boring \"game\", just like the few other Apex (non-Adventure) games that I have seen. Don't confuse this Forbidden City with the talking disc-based TRS-80 Adventure of the same name, which has been around longer than Apex. A REM statement in the listing proclaims copyright.

"ADVENTURE HELPLINE The Adventurer's cry for HELP with Scott Adams games continues to dominate the postbag. Does this mean they are more difficult or more popular? I suspect that it means they are more intriguing-too addictive to be able to put away and forget. The problems posed beg a solution, not letting the player rest until the truth is known! There has recently been a small but containable outbreak of Mission Impossibilities. Personally I found Mission Impossible a bit of a stop-start game, and perhaps the least appealing of the series.

He passes on some clues for you but is still keeping some to himself! All you need, says Neil, is some common sense to correctly interpret both the clues and the song.

If I can't help, there's a great bunch of readers out there who between them seem to have a solution to everything except Pimania???! PLAYING WITH BILL'S PET Some time ago I had a letter from Bill Stanton, of St. Alban's who had been having great fun with the Captain 80 Book of Basic Adventures. This book, which I reviewed in February, lists about 18 Adventures for the TRS-80, originally published in cassette form. Bill has a Pet, and was moved to translate these listings, being starved of Adventure due to the limited number of games available for his machine. That is where the fun began! The Pet, in common with a number of other micros, doesn't have an ELSE statement, and the TRS-80 does. Adventure programs, for every input from the player, have to check so many conditions, each with a different result, that the programmer with an ELSE statement at his fingertips will tend to use it to the full. Bill's problem was deducing the way in which multiple ELSE's operate, and then re-arranging the logic without using the word. He wrote to suggest that a short explanation might be useful to those not blessed with an ELSE, and he came up with the following line to use as an example: 50 IF LEFT$(TR3) = \"ABC\" THEN IF 0$(1) > \"1\" OR 0$(2) <> \"2\" THEN 1000 ELGE 100 ELSE 700 Let us have a look at what this means. The logic in this line can more easily be seen by re-arranging it as follows: IF (condition 1) THEN IF (condition 2) THEN (action 1) ELSE (action 2) ELSE (action 3) We can now see that: If condition 1 is satisfied then condition 2 is checked. If condition 2 is satisfied, then action 1 takes place, if condition 2 is not satisfied, action 2 takes place. If condition 1 is not satisfied, then action 3 takes place. Let us now see if we can rewrite line 50 without the use of ELSE. This will mean using additional lines. Assuming that there are no existing lines between 50 and 60 we get: 50 IF LEFTS(TR$ 3) = \"ABC\" THEN 54 52 GOTO 700 54 IF 0$(1) <> OR 0$(2) <> \"\" THEN 1000 56 GOTO 100 which provides the same logic. To arrive at the \"no ELSE\" version requires a careful analysis of the logic of the original code, so that the way it operates is completely understood The translation needs some care in planning the numbers of the additional lines. If there are insufficient spare numbers between adjacent lines in the original program, it may prove necessary to move the translation down to the end of the program, and access it with a GOTO. Bill's other hobby is collecting locks. Having unlocked the secret of ELSE'S, he is now happily searching for keys to the locks in the Adventure games he has painstakingly built up for himself! And no doubt if he can't find them, the knowledge built up through his two hobbies will enable him to expertly pick them as a last resort! COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 115 "


"GRAPHICS By Garry Marshall EXTEND THE POWERS OF YOUR TEXAS The Texas Instruments T199/4 has its own version of Basic, called TI Basic, with which it is supplied. This version of the language is quite simple, even rather primitive in some respects. Coupled with the fact that the T199/4 contains a 16-bit microprocessor, this makes it even more surprising that programs written in TI Basic run quite slowly. However, there is another version of the language available for the machine. This is TI Extended Basic and it comes in cartridge form. It extends and considerably improves on some aspects of the other version by providing over 40 new or extended features. These include supplying or enhancing features for general programming, for example, with a PRINT AT statement and a much mor general IF-THEN-ELSE statement. They also include many commands for Sprite graphics, and a few commands for generating speech using the speech module that can be attached to the computer. Naturally, it is the Sprite graphics that is of interest to us, and one of its great attractions is that considerable numbers of Sprites can be moved over the screen at great speeds. When this is done one begins to feel for almost the first time that the power of the 16-bit microprocessor is being harnessed. The commands supplied for Sprite graphics by TI Extended Basic are listed in the table below. Given this repertoire of commands, it is at first a little baffling to know how to use them to best effect, and to visualise what kinds of effects can be achieved with their use. If we think in terms of programming a Space Invader game, we can begin to see the uses for them. With CHAR we could design the shapes for the Invaders. Then SPRITE the movements in the plane of the screen The PATTERN command would come into its own in programming a Pacman game, where it could be used to create the munching effect by changing the shape of the Pacman. Clearly the commands are ideal for programming games of these kinds. They can also be used, however, to create very realistic animation sequences with ease. Because the movement of a Sprite is maintained automatically, changing its shape while it is moving allows effects such as a man running or a bird flying or a footballer kicking a ball to be created with a minimum of effort. Notice that for a footballer kicking a ball we should need several shapes to assign to the Sprite for the footballer to make him run and kick, and one for the football. COINC would be used to detect when the ball was kicked, and then the Sprite for the ball would be set in motion using MOTION The following short program shows how a Sprite can be defined, magnified, set in motion across the screen, and have its shape changed as it moves.

"GREAT SOFTWARE DISASTERS Krazy Kong has been driving some of our readers madder than that giant gorilla. This games tape, for the Spectrum, produced by C TECH of Hyde, Cheshire, has already come in for severe criticism on our Mailbag pages and we have received other letters, reprinted here, detailing our readers problems with the game. So we decided to contact C TECH and talk about the gorilla gripes you have brought to our attention. Read on to discover more ... I waited over a month for delivery of C TECH's Krazy Kong, which I then found totally unplayable. The advert is designed to mislead. It takes a long time to load and there are only two different screens. The advert said there were three. I also received C TECH's Gorfian Invaders, but it would not work. 1 ran through the cassette and got bits and pieces of other games. Fraser McIntosh, Netherlee, Glasgow. was shocked. The game I got I am writing about the C TECH Krazy Kong. When my copy finally arrived after a month of waiting was either terribly bug ridden (which I doubt) or the advert is designed to mislead. The game is so fast that it is unplayable but only the 48K version has scoring. I was very disappointed and I am going to send it back. lain Reddick, Kirkcaldy, Shirley Fenton, sales director for C TECH, sounded surprised when we confronted her with the complaints. \"It's our very best seller,\" she said. \"I think it's a case of 'you can't please all the people all the time.\" She added she was not aware that the company had received any complaints about Krazy Kong, but added that anyone who had problems with the game could exchange it. \"We always exchange tapes,\" she said. \"People should just get in contact with us.\" \"All I can say is that it is our best seller. Do you think if we'd had a lot of complaints we'd still be selling it? Some people just don't like video style games. People either love Krazy Kong or hate Fife. I am writing concerning the C TECH Krazy Kong for the Spectrum which I bought a few months ago. I found the game very disappointing and the advert very misleading. The advert said \"super hi-res machine code\". When I received the game I thought it would have smooth non-flicker animation not just a jumpy compiled Basic program. The game is unplayable as it is too fast. The \"Mario\" figure flickers even when you are standing still. If there are three screens they are impossible to get to as the blobs 1 think they are meant to be barrels fly through \"Mario\" until your 10 lives are up and a feeble bleep occurs. The only way to load the game I found was to break into the loader program by turning the computer off and on again and then typing LOAD \"KK16\" and it then takes ages to load. I have sent my cassette back complaining about the game but have not received a reply for over two months. The more people who voice their anger about this game the quicker it will be taken off the market. Edmund Scott, Cliftonwood, Bristol. it.\" I am writing to you concerning the letter you published in your May edition from lain Reddick of Kirkcaldy, Fife, about C TECH's Krazy Kong. So our advice to people who have suffered at the hands of this Kong is to contact C TECH and take them up on Shirley's offer of an exchange tape. We asked one of our games reviewers, Robert Schifreen, to give us his opinion of Krazy Kong. \"When you start loading the program it stops and asks you to put the machine into capitals mode before continuing loading. An experienced Spectrum programmer would know the location of the POKE which would do this automatically \"As for the game itself, the graphics are unrealistic, and nothing like the arcade game which the title would suggest it is based on. The man has no moving parts and the \"barrels\" are unconvincing. On playability I can't comment as I couldn't get the man to jump despite obeying the instructions.\" Final word from Shirley Fenton: \"If you print any letters you will never get any advertising from us again.\" I would just like to say that I totally agree with him. I also believe that the advert is meant to be misleading. Sometimes I find it impossible to load the 48K version, but when I do I never seem to be able to reach the final stage as every time I complete a stage I lose a life and, I assume, return to the beginning. Could this be a bug? The game is very very fast and definitely unplayable. I too waited for over a month for my copy to arrive and have also decided to return it to C TECH with a letter of complaint.

Five laps of the track will test the slickest of computer drivers to the full 3D Grand Prix shows the view through the windscreen as the track is eaten up by your slick machine. Full controls are featured, including accelerator, brakes, and six gears. A lap counter shows you how many times you have been around the track and the number of laps left. Displays also include a rev counter and a fuel gauge. Weather conditions will affect your lap speed just as in a real race and you receive two reports on the elements every five laps. Other cars in the race are passing you and you them so you will have to steer carefully to stay in the game. Keys O and P control your direction, and L enables you to brake. Graphics are reasonably good for the ZX81 especially as this program has to simulate depth as the track and cars disappear into the distance. There are numerous other obstacles and eventualities such as spinning off at a bend or crashing into the car in front of you Control of the gears is the key to success in 3D Grand Prix and it will take you some time to learn how to work your way up through them gradually, to derive maximum benefit. 3D Grand Prix is the latest game for the ZX81 from Artic Computing of Hull. It is in the shops now at .95 for the 16k machine. Driving games are rarely attempted on home computers. Unfortunate this, as they can be extremely entertaining. Full marks to Artic for having a go on such a limited machine and for making such a good job of it as well.  Getting started Graphics  Value  Playability Talking Android Attack is a great idea unfortunately it just doesn't come quite come off. A sythesised voice could add so much to the playability of any game but in this case the androids could do with some elocution lessons. The idea is identical to that old favourite Berserk except that you have the added task of recovering treasure from each of the rooms you visit while avoiding the robotic nasties that lurk within. The androids are determined not to let you get at the treasure and are armed well enough to stop you dead in your tracks. Microdeal claim that the best feature in their game is the talking. However could get no sense out of this synthesised voice, despite offering such a challenge to the entire office. The idea behind this game is to steer your robot through the rooms while avoiding the deadly walls and also the roaming androids. You are equipped with a laser gun which can fire in eight directions depending on which way you happen to be travelling, Movement is controlled with a Dragon joystick. It takes the robot almost 15 seconds to travel from one side of the screen to the other. This puts him at no real disadvantage, though, as the pursuing androids are no faster. The graphics in the game are barely average. The robot moves his legs when he walks but in my opinion this gimmick should have been sacrificed in the interest of speed. The rooms themselves are made of crude graphics blocks and the exits are far too wide. Not one of the better Dragon games this, I'm afraid, and really not worth the .00 price tag. However, if you want to see for yourself then it's available from Microdeal of Cornwall.

RESCUE THOSE STRANDED SCIENTISTS.. CHOPPER RESCUE software 7 WOODFALL, ASTLEY PARK, CHORLEY, LANCS. Software writers from three continents have just launched rival games based on the arcade hit Dig Dug. Game America is the official version and comes from the Atari stable. As with the majority of Atari arcade conversions Dig Dug is a reasonably authentic copy You are the little character Dig Dug who tunnels his way through the soil in a bid to unearth and kill the monsters. When all the fire-breathing monsters have been eliminated a new screen is started To add interest you can also collect bonus points by gobbling the fruits which appear at random. This is a simple and absorbing game which will doubtless sell well on the strength of its arcade pedigree. Slightly more original though still based on the underground tunnelling idea of Dig Dug is Anteater from Romox. You are an ant and your task is to bring four eggs safely back to your nest without being sniffed out and eaten by the Anteater. You are armed with four delayed action bombs which you can use to wipe out an Anteater which is in hot pursuit. Using the bombs is the most enjoyable part of Anteater though you only have four of them so use them sparingly. When you have cleared one screen the next screen presents two anteaters, then three and all the time the game is getting faster and faster. Anteater is manufactured in the Phillipines for Romox of California. Like Dig-Dug it is in cartridge format costing around . The best of the bunch is our very own home grown Diamonds from the English Software House. This takes the digging concept of the game a stage further and introduces several other characters to improve the game play. You have to collect diamonds that are buried in the earth. Trying to prevent you from collecting the jewels are fireflies which chase you with great speed, there is also Brian the Blob, Simon the Snake, the Eyes, and the Demon. Philip the filler also comes into the game in the later stages filling in the tunnels you have already dug don't let him catch you! Diamonds scores over the other two games in that greater strategy and planning are required to clear each screen.

Five scientists are buried below a pile of radioactive waste and you have to guide your helicopter towards them, blasting and bombing to create a network of tunnels. Through these you fly to bring the scientists out and back to safety on the helipad. So far this might sound easy once you've learnt how to use the keys to control your helicopter but the whole operation is made excruiatingly difficult by an enemy bomber dropping more waste to fill in the tunnels and devastating bombs which scythe through the whole lot; and all the time your fuel supply is rapidly running out! The graphics on this program are effective while not exceptional the routine for the disintegration of the helicopter takes up too much time but it's not really a game that is dependant on pretty colours. The major playing drawback is that it requires five-fingered control on the keyboard version, but this can be overcome with practise and does not apply to the joystick version. It is an addictive example of a good old fast-playing test of skill you can wreck your three helicopters very quickly indeed and the next game SPECIAL OFFER for ATARI 400/800 OWNERS Hire your first 2 games free from our extensive range of software.

A.W.G.B.S. 11 Park Road, Stretford, Manchester PENGUINS MAKE LIFE PERILOUS!! MANIC MINER promise a prize to the first such person Timing is the key to success. Once you have mastered a screen, you will usually have little difficulty in clearing it every time. Some levels, though, take a long time to solve especially as you have to start at screen one each time your three lives run out. One of the qualities which make a game a winner is whether you'll keep coming back for more. Manic Miner scores well here, as it will take some time to complete. When the impressive title frame comes up, you are told to press a key to start. If you don't, the game will cycle through all 20 screens giving you a short preview of each. Impressive graphics and good sound, Bug Byte have produced a challenging game with long-lasting appeal. Manic Miner runs on a 48k Spectrum and is well worth the .95 charged by this Liverpool software house. Getting Started Graphics Playability Value SHELL WARS UNDER THE OCEANS SEALORD The ghostly voice of the Sealord reverberated through the deep: \"So you have sunk my Shell Fighters, my Smart Mines will finish you off.\" And they did! In Sealord, one of the latest offerings from Liverpool-based Bug-Byte, you find yourself in control of a submarine when you stumble into the Sealord's underwater empire. Immediately you are under attack from one of many waves of the Sealord's henchmen Your submarine is controlled by two keys which rotate the sub anti-clockwise and clockwise. When the key is released the sub travels in the direction it is facing. I found it almost impossible to manoeuvre the sub with any degree of accuracy and found the haphazard way of moving very frustrating. Graphically the best part of the game is when you get zapped by an alien. The rocks on the seabed, which resemble blue and white rectangles, flash in a gratifying way as the explosion rocks the screen A bonus to the game is a 3-D effect to the rocks enabling you to disappear when you sail behind them. The aliens can also do the same and can catch you unawares. Sealord, one of the latest offerings from Liverpool-based Bug-Byte, runs on the BBC Model B at .50.

From perilous penguins to ferocious phones, this Bug-Byte game is filled with the most unlikely villains trying to thwart your progress through to the next cavern. Miner Willy must explore the underground caverns and collect the keys which open the door to the next cavern. Miner 2049'er, which runs on an Atari, is considered a big game with its 12 screens. Manic Miner has 20 and each is a game in itself. The designer of this game has come up with some highly original scenarios; my personal favourites include Attack of the Mutant Telephones and also the man-eating toilets. The bank scene is very clever, but don't get caught by the bouncing cheque! Although the game is not written for use with any particular joystick it should run on those which allow the interface to be programmed to use certain keys. I found the movement keys quite easy to master and have so far managed to reach level four.

Just two gripes it's difficult to stick to the ground and shoot up everything as it appears out of the left of the screen as you can in the arcade version this is due to the slow speed of fire and awkward shape of the ship.

Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Galaxians ‚Äî every games player worth his joystick will want a decent version of these titles in his collection. One of these classic games is Scramble the famous scrolling arcade game that still holds on to prime positions in pubs and arcades although its cabinet may now be pretty battered. Not surprising then that among the first wave of games for the new Commodore 64 should be a version of Scramble. Terminals Super Scramble sticks fairly closely to the arcade version. For those of you who have never seen Scramble-where have you been! here's a brief rundown on the game. You begin scrolling over mountainous terrain bombing fuel dumps and ground to air missiles. As you advance further the missiles are fired at you leaving the ground with a most realistic swishing sound. There are also blue helicopters on the ground that you can pick off for extra points. Terminal have managed to produce very smooth scrolling graphics. The ground unfolds gently and evenly. The second and third waves are not quite so close to the arcade game but this does not detract from the quality of the game. There are no spiralling yellow aliens or red fire balls. Despite this there are plenty of obstacles and hazards to be overcome. You'll read all about them later in this review! A careful eye on the fuel gauge is vital in this game and you can't afford to miss a single fuel dump. An audible signal would have been an improvement to show when the fuel supply is running down. Fuel is very important as you move further into the Scramble system. You'll need to be a skilled pilot to get HOW WE JUDGE THE GAMES The four marks on our Reviews pages are all out of a possible 10. Getting started refers not only to how easily it loads but the way the instructions are given and how quickly a newcomer can understand the game. Graphics gives marks for realism and use of the machine's capabilities to give a pleasing effect. Playability is the all-impojtant question of game balance, how long it will hold your attention and how addictive it is. Value takes into account the packaging, presentation and how much a player will get value for money out of the tape. We owe an apology to Sinclair and Psion for printing the wrong price by their Scrabble cassette in the August Reviews section. Scrabble costs .95 not .95 as we stated. This was a type-setting error and the reviewer was aware of the correct price and his comments about it and his value mark still hold true.

This will allow you access to one of the largest software libraries in the world, with literally hundreds of programs available for you to use. CARTRIDGES: Various sophisticated programs will be launched on plug in cartridges such as a Visicalc type spreadsheet and a word processor.

The styling of the console and hand controllers has been carefully researched; the console is designed to complement modern hi-tech equipment, and has clear features for easy operation. The hand controllers allow fingertip control via the 8 direction joystick, and feature 2 independent fire buttons. The push button keyboard is used for game selection and for game control with some cartridges. The hand controllers are detachable and are connected to six feet of telephone coil cable, storing neatly away in the console when not in use.

Complete with its own monitor display. Vectrex won't cause any arguments over the use of the family's television because it has its own built in screen THE SCREEN: Vectrex does not use ordinary display techniques, instead it uses vector scanning to control the images on the screen. With this scanning method, the gun only updates the area of the screen that has changed whereas a normal T.V. retransmits the ENTIRE screen 50 times a minute. It is this that gives Vectrex its speed, and means that very little computer power is required for screen control and the results provide very fast responding and clear images. These \"Vector Graphics are used in several arcade games such as Asteroids and Battlezone, to give you incredibly high resolution and quality. Vectrex brings all of this from the arcade right into your living room. The Vectrex screen is capable of displaying 80 columns by 40 lines, which is significant to the extensive developments planned for the system EXCITING SOUNDS AND ELECTRONICS: Vectrex has an advanced microprocessor with more speed and power and exciting effects than many home video games systems REAL ARCADE CONTROLS: Vectrex has a unique control panel, similar to those used in many real arcade games, with 4 concave action buttons and a full 360 self centering joystick. This control panel has a 4 foot detachable cord for maximum player freedom REAL ARCADE GRAPHICS: Vectrex has its own 9 inch vertical screen and unlike a conventional T.V. screen, uses advanced display technology to achieve brilliant, high resolution imagery and superb game play never before possible. The Vectrex display provides special effects too, such as 3-D rotation and zooming in and out, which a regular T.V. cannot match. Using a black and white monitor, each Vectrex game comes supplied with its own coloured plastic screen overlay to add to the excitement of game play. The range of Vectrex cartridges (E19.95 each), gives a good selection of arcade games such as Berzerk, Scramble, Rip-Off and Bomber Attack. Vectrex comes complete with a fast paced \"Minestorm' game built into memory VECTREX: Vectrex has an advanced state-of-the-art microprocessor with more speed than other T.V. games.
