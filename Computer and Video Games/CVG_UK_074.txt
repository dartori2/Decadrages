The character you play, Pogo, works for Destructo Inc. a demolition company given the job of demolishing the towers. And guess what? You've got the job. So the game opens as you emerge from a Mk7 Minisub at the foot of the first tower the Tower of Eyes. This character reminds me in some ways of that other Hewson creation Gribbly from Gribbly's Day out. Remember him? Anyway, you have to climb the tower in the set time limit.

"BEADHEST SAPNAIR PREPARE FORSIE. SEEEEE   * Captain America situated in the Mojave desert, disarm the missile and destroy the deadly virus. The missile is known to be sited on the lowest deck of the Doom Tube, which is sunk deep beneath the surface of the desert. Each deck contains several rooms or Quadrants, which emit a high level of psionic energy. This psionic energy is the only form of energy which is capable of penetrating Captain America's shield, although recent modifications to the shield have given it a certain amount of tolerance. The further down the tube you go, the higher the level of psionic energy is present, so caution must be maintained throughout the journey downward. Your shield is one of two prime defensive weapons that you have in your possession, the other is Cybo Grenades. The shield is virtually indestructible and is able to slice through the air when thrown. The Cybo Grenades have been designed to destroy electronic circuits and are only effective at close range. To travel to each deck an elevator has to be used. Once on the last deck, you must discover which room the missile and virus are kept, once found they must be destroyed.

The game is extremely hard to complete, and will require a lot of trial and error practice to actually get off the first region. Getting to the second region is a feat in itself. Through the Trap Door is a game where you must like arcade adventures to really appreciate it. The multitude of problems and puzzles are extremely taxing.

Big ships, nice animation but it lacks the sort of urgency that a classic zapper needs to keep you coming back for more. It's a scrolling shoot'em up in the Defender/Salamander style but falls short of the classiness of those two games.

It promises great things to come but, for me, it lacks that vital, almost indefinable ingredient which makes a good game. To be honest, I can't quite put my finger on the reason for it, but it fails to satisfy. The plot is weak. The Earth is under threat (yes, again) from a peril from deepest space. Nothing new and original about that, is there? It's the same as a hundred other games. 10 it goes as follows: grey-extra life; green-extra energy brown-extra points; pink-extra time; blue-saps energy; blacksmart bomb. Eventually the grid will begin to break up and you must find the portal to gain entry to the next level. In all there are eight levels to penetrate. Of course there are various \"anti-bodies\" zipping in and out of the grid which must be destroyed before they destroy you. The game does look nice though, with its colourful grids, 360 degree scrolling action, and the sound is nice. It's just that. well, I didn't get a great deal of fun out of it. But Joe Booth obviously has a lot of good ideas whizzing REVIEWS around his brain. We look forward to his next one. out of the grid which is very impressive. What you have to do is locate and destroy energy cells on the grid and collect the crystals of energy which are released. TO get these you must duck and dive under the grid.

VALUE Flight Trainer  MACHINES: CBM 64/IBM TANDY SUPPLIER: ELECTRONIC ARTS PRICE .95 disc VERSION TESTED: CBM 64 REVIEWER: STEVE Often when somebody famous endorses a computer game, the game isn't very good. The legendary Brigadier-General Charles Yeager, US Air Force first man to break the sound barrier, is an exception, and so is this game. It is demanding and difficult, and you won't master it in a week, but like flying it's well worth the effort. This is a flight simulator, not a combat simulator or wargame (we are promised those later). The only things you really need to think about are the joystick and throttle. But anyone trying to fly like an arcade game soon learns differently the controls are very sensitive and very realistically tuned. Part of the program actually teaches you the basic manoeuvres of flying in a Cessna trainer, first with the 'instructor' in control, then with you coping solo. The core of the program is a Flight Test simulator which allows you to test fly any one of fourteen different aircraft, ranging from World War One ABOUT fighters to modern powerhouses capable of over three times the speed of sound. You are not told how they perform, it is your job to find out and record it. Particular fun are three fictional aircraft, all similar-looking modern jets with very different ways of behaving in the air. The program works in real time in a 'world' that has three different airports and a number of aircraft 'obstacle courses'. These can also be used for aircraft racing at below 100 feet in one case and for formation flying stunts. These are not to be attempted until you've really worked out how to fly. Some of the options offered seem unecessary, like the ability to look through the aircraft's floor or tail, or move outside it in flight to see yourself from a chase plane or a satellite, or employ an eight-times zoom to look at an object. Altogether this is the best, the most realistic, and the most comprehensive flight simulator that I've seen on the market. GRAPHICS REALISM PLAYABILITY VALUE sono "

"STARTREK Captain's Log. Stardate 16.12.87. C+VG's John Gilbertt, who boldly goes where many people can't be bothered to go, reports on Star Trek The New Generation now being filmed in Hollywood. What will the final frontiers of space be like without Captain Kirk, Mr Spock, Bones and Scotty?   Four successful movies, a non-stop deluge of fan mail and the continued popularity of science fiction prompted Paramount Pictures to reincarnate Star Trek, the television series. It's taken ten years for the moguls to reach their decision and, because the original cast has grown older and technology has overtaken fiction, they have set the new series amongst The Next Generation of Star Fleet officers and crew. More than 75 years have passed since the original USS Enterprise was launched for its five year mission of exploration. Captain Kirk, Scotty and even Mr Spock are dead, the Federation has inaugurated seven consecutive versions of the legendary Enterprise, and the implements of exploration and warfare have changed. But, the Federation has not found the edges of the universe, despite Kirk's early efforts, and continues the search for new life forms. minerals and phenomena. The Enterprise still has that job and the way in which its new captain and crew go about it is the central strand of the new series. the 'States, started Pre-flight Check discussions with the new Gene Roddenberry, creator Paramount regime about of Star Trek and now in his another series. Preliminary mid-sixties, is the man behind details were finalised in late The Next Generation. He was 1986 and Roddenberry was Paramount's obvious choice given a free creative hand as Executive Producer but as Executive Producer but and a budget of was initially sceptical about approximately a million the project. dollars for each episode. The company has in the past treated him shabbily. Crew Cut Roddenberry sold Paramount A fresh, fairly young, the complete package, production team was put scripts, crew and rights, in together but Roddenberry order to get the company to wanted some continuity with take the series and push it for the old series so he brought prime viewing time slot in two older-times advisors. Paramount was not David Gerrold was convinced that the show responsible for the famous would work and, during its first Trouble With Tribbles episode two seasons, Gene was and, more recently, wrote the constantly at war with original short story for the film television executives and Enemy Mine. Bob Justin, eventually resigned as original Associate Producer producer when he'd had of Star Trek, was also brought enough. in to balance Gerrold's He returned to Star Trek as writer's eye with expertise of Executive Consultant when film making. the series hit the big screen Both joined a brainand, when Wrath of Khan was storming team who's job it! doing the cinema circuit in was to come up with not only story ideas but also a new future reality. According to Roddenberry the creation process was made worse because they had to move the futuristic technology of Star Trek forward nearly one century rather than looking forward from the reality of the 1980s. The original sets have been updated, rather than redesigned, to keep continuity with the old series. The bridge of the Enterprise with its Captain's chair and surrounding control stations and panels do not look a great deal different from those you'll have seen in the movies. . The crew's costumes have gravitated towards boiler suits, the living quarters are much more outlandishbecause of the increase of strange creatures on the staff and the production team has been able to buy different looking corridors, rather than having to use the same one to race or walk down every time, in an effort to make the ship look larger. The special effects, from spaceship propulsion to phaser fire will be at the forefront of movie technology. Roddenberry has hired California-based Industrial Light and Magic, an outfit created by Steven Spielberg to produce the effects on Poltergeist and other movies including the Star Wars pre-quel, Clone Wars, which is about to start filming at Pinewood.

"How to play PLANET OF DOOM C+VG's Role-playing Game NTERGEIFICIRC DOSSIER Hotel They said it couldn't be done! The C+VG team transformed into miniature figures and stuck in a plastic bag on the front cover! Please rescue them before they suffocate! Then save them from certain death on the planet of doom by playing our exclusive fantasy role-playing board game, created by none other than Marshal M. Rosenthal! Marshal transported the C+VG's into the 31st Century by digitising them using a neat bit of hi-tech machinery at his New York headquarters. He also made up the rules, designed the board and took all the pictures. Pretty good for a miniature figure you'll agree! Read the rules and play the game. Meanwhile, the boffins at IDEAS Central are hurriedly attempting to find a way to deminiaturise the C+VG team in time for the next ish. But meanwhile your mini-figures of Lesley, Tim, Paul, Craig and Marshal M. come complete with heavy-duty weaponry, designer space-wear and various silly hats ready for you to play around on the Planet of Doom! Just like having the whole team always available to use and abuse. Go to it! TERCAFICTIC DOSSIER DOSSIER RGAI NOTIC Here's the lowdown and it isn't good! Being a criminal in the 34th century is no better than any other time. There are good days and bad days. Good days mean getting away with a planetful of plunder. A bad day means getting caught. Which is just what's happened. But even that's not so bad! You've got a chance for a quick parole. All you have to do is zip down to a good for nothing planet out in the sticks and pick up this special ore that the Federation of Mining Planets want to take a look at. What's the catch? Well, seems that the place is radioactive, overgrown with mutated jungle creatures, and is definitely not the vacation spot of the Galaxy. Plus there's one other slight catch to the whole affair. Four other slobs have been offered the same chance for parole. The first to get the ore and blast off wins freedom. Everybody else gets to stay! DOSSIER TERGARCTIC --00000000000000000000000 RULES Place your figure on the corresponding picture of the character. Use a dice to take turns as you move counterclockwise on the squares. The object is to be the first person to recover the ore and blast off in the spaceship. To do this you must: First land ON the shielded box square. Then land ON the ORE square (if no box, then no ORE). Finally land ON the spaceship. If you should land on a square occupied by another character, you can force him/her to: Take the next turn going backwards. Exchange places with anyone else on the board. A Safety Zone protects whoever is on it from any harm. No one can do ANYTHING to a person while he/she is on a Safety Zone. NTERGEI ACTIC DOSSIER M . FK YOUR FREE FIGURES! Just a few words about the figures which come FREE with this issue of C+VG. There are FIVE figures to complete the Planet Doom set. You get two different figures with each issue. Why not swap them with your friends to get the exact team YOU want? If you want to play the game with more than two people you can always use coloured counters or simply cut out the dossiers to opposite and use them to represent your character. Please write and tell us what you think about this board game idea. Would you like to see more games like this? How about getting more figures to play with? We're waiting for. your letters and phone calls ... "

This is the afterlife. Alan Rudolph is clever enough to give but they do have a ghoulish glee as IN HEAVEN (PG). Heaven is a place where anything the whole confection a rich centre, to they tell of a wooden Indian which Made in Heaven: can come true and that includes balance out the airiness of its icing, the comes to life, an unspeakable thing in a \"What's a girl like you falling in love, which Mike promptly result is exquisite witty, funny and lake and a hitchhiker who just won't doing in a mag like this?\" does with Annie (Kelly McGillis), a clever. take no as an answer. beautiful soul who has never been sent But most of all it's daringly Actually, the 18 seems unfair to earth.

Creep in if you want some lightweight laughs in the jugular vein! This month's other comedy offering is produced by Aaron Spelling of Dynasty fame, written and directed by Jerry Belson, a veteran of US sitcoms, and features Sally Field, who started her career as TV teenager Gidget. With credits like that your reaction may well be to SURRENDER! SURRENDER's a smart-ass comedy about love, money and divorce in LA. It also stars Michael Caine, looking somewhat out of place as a muchdivorced best-selling author who breaks his vow of celibacy when he meets Miss Field, but decides to keep his riches a secret to test her. The pace is roller coaster hectic and it's all silly stuff, packed with one liners, a few of which are very funny, the others raising a smile or just falling flat. Whether you surrender to its Surrender: No Michael, I won't let you make more outlandish plot will depend on your than two films a day tolerance to American television comedy. At the other extreme there's BLISS (18), a very odd Australian allegory about a happily middle-class man who dies for four minutes after a heart attack, then discovers that life can never be the same again.

This is truly weird, unlike any of Hollywood's attempts at wackiness. But it rambles too much for its own good, and individual parts tend to be better than the whole.

"WARDNER worry about is the width of the track which alternates between multi-laned and single lane. Top Speed from Taito is a five Bill-boards now line the route, stage driving game with slick and and, with rocky cliffs tightly to one sensitive handling and a game side of the road, there's no place to perspective exactly like that of Out make a mistake. Normally in these Run. What's more, like Out Run it games you can use the brakes to comes packaged as a huge sit in good effect, but in Top Speed, to driving machine as well as your stamp on the brake to slow down normal upright. The upright version tends to stop you dead which is great fun and initially reviewed doesn't help your time. the game on this format. However, if you get the chance, go for the monster version which moves left, right, backwards and forwards. A whole lot of fun. Peering over the dashboard as you cresta hill at top speed is nerve racking it's anybody's guess as to what's over the brow of the hill Platforms, ladders, moving elevators and ropes, monster bashing and gold collecting ‚Äî all the ingredients are here for a notously enjoyable arcade game. Wardner is cute, addicitive and immensely playable. While taking astroll in a magical forest, Wardner the evil Guardian swoops down from her castle eyrie and turns your girlfriend into a crystal ball. This is promptly spirited away by a dragon, leaving you seething with rage and determined to put all to rights, Playing o knight in shining armour means fighting your way through the magical forest, blasting baddies, avoiding traps and sneeking into the castle lo do your rescue bit. The game starts off in the forest. On the ground level ore swamps in which lurk sundry nasties. Climb up the trees and there you'll find chests glinting with gold, witches, warlocks and other baddies. Use your flamethrower to hit the baddies and jumping to the platforms, collect the gold you'll need this later on in the level. Even this early on in the game, the going can be tricky. Shooting the witches, who are hidden behind leafy branches, can be a problem, especially as they shoot back and dodging a ball of fire while perched precariously on a branch isn't easy. You'll often have to jump and then fire to get the baddies. This saves you climbing to their height and into trouble. When the attackers are killed, golden crystals are left behind. Make sure you pick these up as they add extra fire balls to your flame thrower. On starting the game, the flame thrower only spits out one ball of fire, but as you go further into it, you'll soon be able to shoot out a barrage of fire which will sizzle your opponents. At the end of the level, a shop comes into sight where you can use the gold you've found to buy extra weapons such as a solar sword or magical cloak. The prices all vary, and if you haven't got the money you'll be turned away empty handed, further levels have been brilliantly designed, and the timing element is perhaps one of the most important parts of this great little game. On top of that, the areas you have to negotiate must have been designed by a particularly tortured mind. Traps are sprung the forest becomes deeper, more nasties appear and you'll certainly need those more powerful weapons, Magic cloaks are in short supply and are found rarely, Birds can be used at times to carry you across difficult terrains, like flowing rivers of burning lava However to hitch a ride on a bird you must be in the right spot and be ready to jump for its talons at the right time. If you're really lucky, the bird will carry you through a whole screen to the shop of the far end. Flying dragons appear at regular intervals and these have to be defeated to continue the game. Hit them a number of times and they'll eventually dissolve into a ball of flame. While doing this, however, be ready to jump or duck their fire which can be uncomfortably accurate, There's no way Wardner could be termed an original game as bits have been borrowed from 50 many others of this type, Ghosts 'n Goblins and the like. Still, only the best features have been used and I'd recommend you to try this one out for yourself Racing games have been done to death, but manufacturers keep belting out new ones. It would be unfair to compare Top Speed with classics like Wec Le Mans and Out Run as these are dedicated games built and designed round sit-in cabinets, Top Speed is in an upright cabinet and for its kind, it must rank amongst the top os a realistic racing game with great graphics and smooth handling. It's also addictive and offers quite a challenge. 209470 The idea in Top Speed is to get through all five stages in the shortest possible time. The tracks are tortuous and wind all over the place with many circular diversions which add extra miles and time to the course. At the end of each level, study the track for the next stage and work out the shortest route. It's the only way you'll make it in the time allowed. The first stage is fairly straightforward, no diversions, no loops, and the track itself is a multi-lane highway. Using your Nitro-switch on the straight, you can turbo charge your car and zoom forward at a much greater speed for a short while. Use this feature sporingly though, it only works three times on every stage. The second stage is a little more tricky. Although the track splits, the length of each section of road is the same.

"VEWS are all too easy to fall into. The only problem with reviewing Golf on the Nintendo is that I have played Leaderboard on the Commodorel Of course that is the definitive version, but you can still while away the odd hour on this offering. It plays well and is challenging enough even for the hardened golfers among you. SOCCER: This is a real gem of a simulation. Most team sport simulations tend to be a bit dodgy when it comes to controlling players, but not this little beauty! There are plenty of options to choose from, length of the match, skill level, two player option and team colours. Control is nice and tight when you have mastered the art of passing and switching control to another player. This will take around a couple of minutes. Gameplay is nice and smooth with some bone crunching tackles if you should feel the urge. All the elements from the sport are there with throw-ins, goal kicks, corner kicks, penalty shoot outs and offsides. At halftime you get a zippy display of girls in ra-ra skirts doing their dance routines before the teams trundle back out to start the second half. This is a very polished game with good graphics and tunes. Above all it is playable and FUN. Go for it!

Simple concept, simple play, simple(ish) graphics and sound yet! was hooked. Clu Clu is a cross between the arcade golden oldies Ladybird and Pacman. It also boasts some novel gameplay and design elements. You control a girl called Bubbles, who looks like a fish to me, and you have to discover all the gold bars hidden over 20 screens. Each screen has to be solved within a time limit and while zapping/ramming the standard issue nasties which roam at will over each maze. To expose the gold you have to guide Bubbles around a maze and get her to look around various pillars scattered about. As she goes through pillar posts she exposes any gold hidden between them.
