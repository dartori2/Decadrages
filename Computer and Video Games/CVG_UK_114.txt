"ED-FIRST firtual Reality, eh? It's a right game. Well, it is now that W Industries have launched their Virtuality machine, coming soon to an arcade near you. I must say, the high price makes me slightly sceptical of it's success, but I'd like to think it will change the world of computer games simply because it really is the next logical step. The quality of computer graphics has improved vastly over the years, making games seem more and more realistic. But while they're displayed on a two-dimensional screen they'll never be able to completely convince the player that he's flying a fighter-bomber or wandering through a labyrinth slicing up zombies. If Virtual Reality technology is developed to the same degree, then we really should be experiencing games totally (sights, sounds, feelings, and perhaps even smells!) by the end of the century And after that? Well, who knows? Cartridges that connect directly to the player's brain, so that the imagination is the screen on which the graphics are displayed? Think about it... And while you're thinking about it, prepare yourself for next month's amazing free gift, a set of glow-in-thedark stickers, which could lead to you winning one of four Super Famicoms in upcoming issues of CVG and Mean Machines! Don't miss it! PAUL GLANCEY ASSOCIATE EDITOR Paul Glancey tests a prototype version of the Virtual Reality machine.

"CVG NEWS REPORT IS THIS Dateline: 22 March 1991. The place: Wembley Conference Centre, London. The occasion: the world launch of the Virtuality 1000 SD system a new accomplishment in \"virtual reality\" aimed at the leisure market as the future of computer-based entertainment. Robert Swan was there really... simply because the vast computer power needed to produce an exciting games environment was way too expensive to be commercially viable. W Industries, based in Leicester, have spent the last decade designing and perfecting what they claim to be the ultimate in sensory experiences the Virtuality 1000 SD Virtual Reality entertainment system. Their system, prided at ,000, is aimed at the arcade market, and that price puts it between a top-of-the-range cockpit aroade machine, such as a Galaxy Force (which costs between ,000 and ,000), and the new R360 (priced at over ,000). W Industries hope to replace the limited and shallow\" coin-ops of today with simulations of all manner of vehicles ranging from the Harrier jump jet to interstellar fightercraft WHAT IS ALL THIS VIRTUAL REALITY STUFF ANYWAY? Virtual Reality is a topic which has received growing coverage in the computer press over the past months. It's a term used to describe a system which provides a full and realistic 3D view of a computer-generated world, in which you can move and interact. Virtual Reality has already been applied to some commercial applications (notably architectural design). But until now, no-one has tried to sell systems for entertainment purposes WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HAT? The system itself is comprised of three units. The display is contained in the Visette, an ergonomically designed visor that rests on the head. Providing the images are two high-resolution LCD colour displays which sit over the player's eyes to provide a stereoscopic 3D effect. Inside the Visette there is sensing circuitry which can detect the exact angle of the player's head so if he looks up, the screens display whatever is above him in the virtual world! Stereo speakers in the helmet provide full surround-sound effect, and there's even a hidden microphone so players can interact with each other in multi-player games. The Visette fits practically any size of head thanks to a nifty locking system (so if you wear glasses, you don't have to take them off to use it), and there's even a \"panic button\" if you can handle the heat, the lock springs open, enabling you to remove the unit quickly. The Visette is also extremely robust it's been dropped from a height of two metres, and it still worked! THE GAMES Two games were on disI play with the Virtuality VTOL, a flight combat simu lation based on the Harrier jump jet, and Battlesphere, a space sim with the player at the controls of a deadly starfighter. Both games are stunning in their design and conception, and you do really get a feeling of \"being there\" the speed of the update is quite astonishing for a system of this nature. W Industries are currently developing two more Virtuality games, one of which is provisionally titled Future Forest. The other is a game based on the Cresta Run, the famous deadly bobsleigh course expect highspeed thrills aplenty in that one! "


"RTUALITY TM THE ARCADE OF THE FUTURE? IN THE COCKPIT The main section of the Virtuality unit is the massive grey cockpit, in which the player sits and this contains the brains, of the system, the powerful Expality computer (which in turn contains a CD-ROM drive), and the Animette graphics soit ware, which not only generates the impressive 3D images, but controls the visual display from the computer through to the visor There are two joysticks situated on the arms\" of the cock pit, both of which have trigger and thumb fire buttons THE VERDICT The Virtuality is certainly a remarkable achievement in the field of entertainment technology and is undoubtedly the most exciting development in arcade machinery since Space Invaders. But will it take off? The sleek, grey techno-cockpit and the Star Wars-style Visette make the Virtuality an impressive machine to behold, so it's bound to attract arcade players (and probably plenty of other curious passer's-by) like a magnet. The only real problem with the system is the price for your average arcade owner, ,000 is a hell of a lot of dough to cough up for a single unit; and to connect 20 machines together would cost a whacking ,000! At that price, players can expect to pay up to .00 per credit so W Industries will have to produce games of very high quality indeed to keep the punters interested. But, if you wander into one of the larger arcades and are lucky enough to clap eyes on it I recommend without reservation that you at least sample the Virtuality experience you certainly won't be disappointed. THE FUTURE As with all computer systems, as soon as it's invented other companies will start a race to provide better and cheaper systems. And this will certainly be the case with Arcade Virtual Reality. Sega and Sony are already working on Virtual Reality systems for use as leisure machines, and no doubt other manufacturers are ready to enter the market! Players beware a new revolution has begun. 009 "

"CVG NEWS CASTLE MZ LOF ILLUSIONS STARRING MICKEY MOUSE Taking the Mickey? Virgin's cut price Megadrive hits the streets! 16-BIT FOR DRIVE SEA IZO    The Walt Disney Company US.GOLD US GOLD HIT PARADE MEGADRIVE MEGACUT! Should you walk into a local branch of Dixons, you should discover that Sega have sensationally slashed the price of their Megadrive down to a token .99 and you even get a free copy of the brilliant Mickey Mouse (sure beats the whiffy Altered Beast any day!) into the bargain! Other shops should be receiving cut-price consoles soon, and the chances are that they will bundled at the same price with the repellent Italia '90 football game. Our advice is that if you're contemplating a Megadrive purchase, you should make all haste to Dixons and get that Mickey Mouse pack as soon as possible. WINE CAFFIER FIGHTER SMS M T WEEK BER TIME 135 HIT 3 Birmingham-based US Gold have announced the latest Sega coin-op titles to be converted onto all the popular 8-bit and 16-bit systems. First off will be Alien Storm the massively enjoyable follow-up to the gruesome Alien Syndrome. This will be followed by the spectacular G-LOC the graphical tour-de-force Sega produced as a sequel to Afterburner. Alien Storm is best described as a kind of Golden Axe with shoot 'em up elements. The basic gameplay involves the horizontally-scrolling antics of three characters out to wipe out an entire alien storm! Alien Storm also features a brill bonus high-speed running section and there's even a 3D Op Wolf-style action thrown in for good measure. If Tiertex convert this well then it'll go down extremely well here at CVG. G-Loc is a graphically awesome coin-op. Combining Sega's acclaimed sprite-based 3D technology and a liberal smattering of polygons to boot, it's certainly a real coin-op experience (especially in the amazing R360 coin-op cabinet). The basic gameplay simply involved piloting your F14 Tomcat behind enemy lines shooting down enough targets with your Vulcan cannon and missiles. US Gold have enlisted crack programming bods, Creative Materials to convert the game onto all the popular formats. Their conversions of Sega's Line of Fire were graphically superb, so hopefully this conversion should be equally impressive. G-Loc should be ready for an Autumn release. SOUNDING OFF! ChatterBox Off the cuff digital sampling with the new Chatterbox! Here's a pic of the latest piece of wrist-based technology straight from the USA! The ChatterBox, as it's called, combines yer average watch-technology with a kind of mini-sampler, which can record and playback any sound you may utter into the mounted microphone. Sounds pretty good, eh? Unfortunately, what this picture doesn't show is the size of the thing! Roughly 80mm x 40mm, it's a bit on the big side unless you've got wrists the size of Arnold Schwarzenegger's. What we don't know is just how much sound the ChatterBox can record. It uses memory chips, not tape, so the length (and quality) of your samples is consequently rather limited. "

"COIN-OP GOLD US Gold are returning to the compilation field with Coin-op Hits 2 incorporating four major coin-op licenses and one original game. The package is made up of Ghouls 'n' Ghosts (decent conversion of the Capcom smash), Vigilante (okay Irem beat 'em up). Dynasty Wars (average Capcom conversion). Ninja Spirit (pretty good Irem beat'em up) and finally, Hammerfist (Vivid Images great arcade adventure).

Enid Blyton's amazing Famous Five book \"The Famous Five on a Treasure Island\" look set to be immortalised in a new adventure courtesy of Enigma Variations. The game promises to have an intelligent parser, with plot, text and pictures highly similar to the Blyton books. The game is already available on the Sam Coupe, and Amiga, ST, Spectrum, C64 and Amstrad versions should all be available by April with a PC version expected in May. Boy oh boy! We can't wait! SEGA TERMINATED In the Autumn, Sega Master System owners should be able to play a game based on the fab Schwarzenegger movie, The Terminator. Unfortunately, Virgin (the game's producers) only have the rights to produce the game on cartridge, so it appears likely that the only other console it could conceivably appear on is the Sega Megadrive. The Terminator will be followed up by more carts from Virgin, although they remain tight-lipped about specific titles at the moment. It seems likely that they may well be conversions from some of Virgin's home computer titles as well as original games. Compare these pictures. Could our own Richard Leadbetter have been the Inspiration for The Famous Five's Dick? CUT-PRICE BOND Domark are dusting down some of their old big-name classics and re-releasing. them at the mega-low price of .99.

Judge for yourself by casting your eyes over the Spectrum screenshots shown. Playing a nice wizard, it's your job to destroy the nasty Grand Sorcerer's laboratory and all of his associated magical scrolls and phials. Infogrames promise \"lots of animation, unlimited humour and a crowd of characters to meet\". There's also all the prospective excitement of two-player action.

"REVIEW SUPER FAMICOM .00 BY ENIX PAUSE The gods were feeling pretty pleased with themselves. After all, during the course of a thousand millennia they'd managed to persuade the inhabitants of the entire planet to worship them and now they ruled supreme. Unfortunately, a minor god was mucking about one day when he accidentally pointed his divine retribution finger at one of the major oceans. Needless to say, such careless behavior resulted in a major catastrophe as the earth opened up and a new island was created. This island was a bit too big for the gods to ignore, so they decided after a few centuries that it should be populated, but being such a large island, it had to be divided into six separate areas. Populating each area and making it prosper was the ideal opportunity to train up a novice god and as the player of this game, you adopt that daunting mantle. This might sound like a simple task especially for an god but unfortunately, you are not the only divine presence on the island. The Forces of Darkness arrived several decades ago and already some of their foul minions roam the fair and pleasant lands. A speeding celestial arrow (courtesy of the infinite supply you keep in your divine quiver) is your form of attack against these demonic minions. But destroying their satanic lairs isn't so easy... ISLAND OBSERVATIONS This cloud castle is your base of operations. Fly it to the part of the island you want to look at, and press the button to zoom in or out. A prosperous settlement. The view comes at no extra charge. HI Bidigt POPULATION EXPLOSION! At the beginning of each area you are graced with only two followers. Your mission as a god is first to level out the land. Then, when the hour glass at the top of the screen empties away your followers spill out of the temple and populate the land you have leveled. However, the amount of people that leave the temple is dependent on a number of factors. How large your settlement is affects their reproductive antics, along with how happy they are. The happiness of your popu10 lace is very important in this game... EU "


"REVIEW GIFTS TO THE GODS PAUSE A happy population is very useful in your quest for god-like megalomania, because then they work their little socks off for you and come up with a variety of items that both asfound and amaze. Included in the goodie hit parade are wheat, bread, bridges and if you're especially lucky, a form of mighty magic but more of that later! SCORE NA PAUSE! NA One of many terrifying guardians! The first arcade level. PADSE! PALISE: RICH SEZ... ARCADE ACTION! Before you can start to colonise each land, our angelic hero has to take out the demonic base that has been established. After that the populating antics begin. The round ends when your people inexplicably get rather annoyed. The cause can be tracked down to another enemy base that the devilish hounds have created. You can ignore this and move on to the next level, but that's not very nice (or indeed very god-like) is it? I'm ashamed to say that I h ven't added Actraiser to my Super Famicom collection yet, but I fully intend to. Offering some of the superb graphics and unbelievable sonics ever, the arcade sections in this game easily make it worth the money alone. Add in a Sim City/Populous game of a similar quality (and some spinetinglingly awesome medieval tunes to match the settlement-building) and you've got a totally unbeatable combination. It's the arcade sections that are going to be winning the awards, I think and there's even a hidden (though it's not hidden very well!) option that enables you to play the arcade sections and forget about the strategy bits altogether! With a massive six levels to conquer there's loads of action to keep you going for a long while and it's one of those games you'll play even after it's been completed it's that good! The Super Famicom excels again with a game that shouldn't be missed. Mind you, a lot of the game is in Japanese and to my knowledge, so check you're getting English Instructions before you hand over the cash. RICHARD LEADBETTER "

The old saying goes \"gobsmacking audiovisuals do not a good game make\", but Actraiser mixes absolutely stunning graphics and sound with a game so addictive, you'll want to play it again and again. A special mention must go to the stunning movle-score-like incidental tracks which really do get the old adrenalin pumpinal As Rich has said, the similarities of this to Populous and Sim City are somewhat obvious, but that's no bad thing by any means the addition of some absolutely awesome arcade sequences only go to enhance the game further. Be warned, however this sucker is tough, and will take a heck of a lot of practice to complete, but even so, Actralser is a brilliant title that Super Famicom owners will go absolutely nuts over.

Each act gets progressively tougher until the final confrontation with the Prince of Darkness himself! DOCTOR ACTRAISER'S MUSICAL PHARMACY As well as possessing some of the greatest graphics ever, Actraiser also takes the accolade of having some of the grooviest music ever incorporated into a console (or computer) game. There's a multitude of trumpets, drums and even a string quartet put to good use in the vast amount of tunes that this Owww! game has in store for you.

Did you know that Dear YOB, If people who sell pirate games are criminals then what are the people who make and sell originals? They sell a disk in a big box full of useless pictures and stuff and charge twenty-five pounds for it. Tell me how much it would cost for an orig. inal to be made. My guess is about 3, that's a profit of around 22. If this isn't criminal, what is? If you buy a pirate game and don't like it you have only wasted a few pounds, whereas if you buy the original and don't like it you have wasted over twenty quid. I think a lot more original games would be sold if the totally idiotic price tag was cut. I don't see why a disk should cost nearly double the price of a tape and I don't see why they expect people to buy originals instead of paying an eighth of the price and getting a pirate. Thomas Sharkey, Glasgow YOB: I've had to listen to some Rea-brained numbskulls in my time, but this takes the chocolate HobNobs. Answer me this simple question, poo-forsense; if everybody bought pirate games and no-one bought originals, who would make the originals that are being pirated? I'll tell you who no-one. So there'd be no games at all. And that's why your argument is dead before it even comes to life. RHYME TIME NEMPLOYED So0THEN HA HA THAT MAKEIA CHAN A JOB I CAN CHORTLE! THAT. HONEST UN 025 I CAN...

"PC GEZ CHOC SHAKE-UP Dear YOB, You will be pleased to know that I have stopped gibbering and regained my sanity. My psycho-monk mates have ceased their mad, maniacal, moo-ha-haling rituals and succumbed to the fatal plague of \"Towno\" which is sweeping the teenage part of the nation. Anyway, some questions. 1. My Amstrad PC (640K) has got a dead-slow 8086 chip, processor, CPU, thingy in it but how many MHz is it? 2. How much would a fast CPU, processor thingy (286, 386) cost? 3.

Lots of it, it seemed to me. Around the same time (1988) I found that all the classic video games which had loved so dearly in my early teens were disappearing. There were no more Asteroids or Battlezones with which to mis-spend my youth. No more Stargates, Robotrons or Sinistars to blast out sound from the corner of the arcade. My passion was ending, so I thought. But one day on the way to Lewisham I saw a fairground in South-East London and promptly parked the car. In it I saw an Atari Asteroids, one of the most original, playable games ever made. It was just before my father's birthday and so with a little negotiation, I bought the machine for one hundred pounds and gave it to my father as a house present. It has now been in the house for three years and has been partnered by other classic video games including Stargate, Defender, Star Wars, Missile Command, Tempest etc. I am now heavily involved in maintenance, repair, buying and selling of old machines. I have gathered thousands of pages of literature on all early video games and hundreds of hard-to-find parts for machines from Space Invaders to Return of the Jedi. I feel very strongly that those in the amusement industry have almost no concern for the wiping out of these popular games, and in fact only make matters worse by smashing machine as soon as they get old. I now feel that because games of this age are few and far between, something should be done to keep machine from the golden age of video games alive and well for a long time to come. Therefore I have decided to set up an organisation to cater to the needs of anyone who has an old machine in their house or garage. It will provide on-site repairs, technical info, information on where to get spare parts and any game secrets that exist for the game. If anyone is interested in joining or helping out with a friendly, helpful organisation they should write to me at this address.

"The strange odour in the air indicated the presence of the CVG challengers. Enter the deformed presence of Richard Leadbetter (smug in the knowledge that he owned a Famicom and the non-CVG journos didn't-bah!) and the equally ludicrous newly-mohicaned Julian Rignall (another Super Famicom owner not that this was going to help him). THE GAMES selected two games for my tournament. First off, Super I Mario World probably the best platform game in the world. If the contest was to be a fair one, then surely the vomit-inducing Rignall must be thoroughly trounced on his own fa vourite game (and I was looking forward to that, believe me...). Secondly, I chose (for my own personal reasons) the extreme violence of Final Fight the latest and greatest beat 'em up. When the cart had first arrived, I had witnessed (with much amusement) the complete ineptitude of the CVG staff on this game, and I awaited the encore with mounting pleasure. Ha! REVIEWERS CHALLENGE In my quest to find the ultimate games player (and destroy the grotesque egos of the repellent CVG reviewers into the bargain), I turned my attentions to the ultimate games machine the Super Famicom. Surely the superior games offered by this hi-tech system could annihilate any vestige of gamesplaying ability offered by the miserable CVG crew. I gathered the participants of my challenge together. Victory was certain! GAME ONE: SUPER MARIO WORLD The shambling mess of Richard Leadbetter's massively flicked hair reached the Famicom first he arrived a few seconds later. To try and even things up, I decided that because of all the points cheats known to this imbecile (and the Rignall creature too), the winner of the round would be the person who could complete as many rounds as possible in ten minutes. Repellent Rich (even the flies keep away from him) started his game, and whizzed through the first five levels with easein less than six minutes arrrgghh! However, seconds later a loud fart from flatulent reviewer Rob Swan put him off and Witham's top phone-box sex fiend lost two lives in close succession, and as a consequence only completed six levels before his time was up! A pathetic showing with only a miserable 138,270 points to show for it. I was beginning to enjoy THE CHALLENGERS In order to cause maximum humiliation to the mentally reI tarded CVG reviewers, I drew from the experience of computer journos far and wide (you readers will have your chance next month). First of all, Sinclair User's Steve Keen. Many was the time I saw him playing truant from his rubber-keyed Spectrum, gaining vital gameplay experience on the Famicom, Amiga and Megadrive. Next up, Paul Rand. Surely an ex-CVG reviewer could annihilate the present bunch of incompetents. MEAN MACHINES' Matt Regan was my third participant and the less said about him the better. this... Next up was Steve, who only now revealed to me that he'd never played the game before! Doh! I watched with growing contempt as Steve lost five lives at 15 second intervals. His "


"complete lack of joystick skills amazed even me, and after ten minutes the flaccid fool had only completed two screens and scored a drooping 13,240 points. Things didn't improve that much when Matt Regan first reached the Super Famicom. He lost his first life in a recordbreaking nine seconds! Stunned into silence by the boy blunder's bumbling incompetence I awaited his next move. Rich, meanwhile, wasted no time by feeding Matt his own form of verbal intimidation. A vicious kick from my special stomping boots reduced the limp one to a wobbling mess. Matt eventually leveled with retarded Richard with six completed rounds to his credit. But his score was two thousand points higher meaning that Matt took the lead. Hal Rignall arrived next; the stranged-locked one oozing his own inimitiable brand of confidence. To my immense annoyance he completed round one in 48 seconds! This speed con tinued way past the first end-of-world castle. Indeed, he had smashed Matt's record by the seven-and-a-half minute stage and went on to complete eight rounds complete and score a gargantuan score of 168,640. So-called Paul \"Randy\" Rand tried in vain to catch up with Rignall, but unfortunately his performance was not quite good enough and came second with 154,760. Small consolation, know, but the next round would sort out the men from the pigeon droppings. GAME ONE: SADIE'S SUMMARY mmm. Jazza didn't suffer the humiliation I had planned for him, but I didn't care it's a well-known fact he's crap at Final Fight. If Paul could beat him, then victory would be his. Shame about Steve I had high hopes for him. The crestfallen, hunched form of Richard Leadbetter made my day coming fourth out of five participants is a completely miserable showing whatever way you look at it! I was looking forward to making his humiliation complete in the next round. Mario madness Rignall may have walked it, but at least that Leadbetter thing took a stuffing! the face robbed him of his next life whilst a limp-wristed, pink leotard-wearing character took the next! Eventually the endof-level boss in round two destroyed his last efforts leaving him with a flaccid 340,140! Blubber-boy Regan arrived next, bemoaning the fact that he was \"crap\" and \"had hardly played it\". A quick prod from my electrified cattle prod spurred him into action. Damnd, the first end-of-level boss, managed to extract two lives from the flabby MEAN MACHINES man I was beginning to despair Could anyone catch up with Rich's score? I hoped so for his sake... Obviously the drooling, stunted form of Mr Regan wasn't quite good enough. He finished his credit with a gibbe. ring 321,090. He just didn't rise to the occassion, which probably explains his disappointing performance. I didn't have much hope for Steve, especially when the smug Richard arrived to teach him how to play the game! The less said about his incompetent performance the better. Still, to his credit the 331,711 score did beat Matt's dull perfor mance. The inane leer in Richard's hideous features still fresh in my mind, I banished Steve back to the Sinclair User office, never to be seen again. Could Randy save the day? If he could pummel Richard's score then the championship would be his. Unfortunately, it turned out that he'd never played the game before, either! Using my techniques for kicking someone's head in, Paul managed to achieve a creditable 346,260! This made him take second place again completely annihilating both Julian and Richard's claim to the championship! Chuckle, chuckle, chuckle. The amount of people I'd want to beat with a lead pipe is no-one's guess-especially that Regan cretin... GAME TWO: SADIE'S SUMMARY Another CVG reviewer wins the round. Arrgghhh! Not to worry though, I'd gain my revenge one day... one day... A nice showing from Paul, though. Coming second in as many rounds isn't bad for someone who'd never even clapped eyes on a Super Famicom before. Steve and Matt's complete in competence disgusted me. I would have to sort them out later. GAME TWO: FINAL FIGHT like Final Fight. I like it a lot mainly because one of the Icharacters you mercilessly thrash to oblivion looks a lot like Robert \"Crippy Swan, and I also admire two of the game's characters, Poison and Roxette for their formidable fighting skills. Their double-legged stilletto kick to the groin is one must learn... Once again, the odious Dick Bedwetter took the seat first He seemed to have recovered from the shame of his thrashing on Super Mario and oozed a particularly slimy form of confidence. I don't want to dwell on this. He finished his credit with a massive 888,030! Rignall took the seat next and I anticipated a swift (but very painful) demise to his mindless antics. I wasn't to be dis appointed. He lost several lives during the course of his game and at one stage even set himself on fire! A knife in Hmm, if only Rignall was in there instead wishful thinking, suppose... SADIE'S SCOREBOARD ROUND ONE ROUND TWO TOTAL SUPER MARIO FINAL FIGHT SCORE JULIAN 16 PAUL RICHARD MATT STEVE THE FINAL STANDINGS Dah! There's nothing worse than a score draw! Thankfully, DRignall didn't win outright only the good all-round skill of Paul Rand got in his way. I considered staging a sudden death play-off between the two players (with the emphasis on the \"sudden death\" if Randy cocked it up), but thought against it. I could wait another month for another challenge, and this time I would be victorious! SADIE "

"REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY MIRRORSOFT ast forward to the future. Conventional sports of all description have been replaced by one single game. One game that combines the energy, excitement, skill, expertise and all-out violence of true sport. This game is Speedball. The action is displayed on an vertically scrolling playfield with a goal at either end. Two teams assemble for the game and the aim is simplicity itself. Each end of the pitch has a goal tucked into the metallic walls and the two teams must score goals past the oppos. ing 'keeper. But in order to spice the game up and encourage the competitive spirit, the game's organisers have come up with a number of extras to spice up the midfield action... SPEEDBALL SKILLS Each player has the ability to barge other players about. But then, Speedball is a very violent game and all this barging malarkey is used to gain possession of the ball. Holding down the fire button for different amounts of time also dictates how high the player throws the ball. Simple passes require only a short stab of the button, whilst long throws require a longer press. What are you waiting for? BRIBE STAMT TIMET RICH SEZ... * ****** *** EXTRA SKILL REDUCE STAMINA E HHHHHHHHH H HHH BH Speedball isn't bad at all. Best played in two-player mode it offers fast and furious action the like of which isn't seen too often on the Master System. All the fun of strutting over to the opposing 'keeper, cuffing him around the chops and then scoring is here for the taking! The graphics aren't bad at all with a suitably \"hard\" metallic pitch (and matching sprites), though the effect is weakened slightly by the jerky scrolling. However the sound is barely average. The tunes are a tad on the tedious side and the effects don't really catch the atmosphere of a high-thrill, excitement-laden game at all. Our colleagues at MEAN MACHINES thought it was a bit simple in one-player mode when they reviewed it, and Mirrorsoft have listened to their their criticisms and strengthened up the opposing teams. Have a look by all means. RICHARD LEADBETTER CHOOSE YOUR TEAM There are three Speedball teams to choose from before the violent action begins proper. Each team has different stats which affect the players' performance in the game. Our advice is to go for the mysterious masked Darth Vader-alike in the centre. His team has a full 100 points more power than the others and more power is a welcome advantage in Speedball stats ahoy! C219 COSERTA HEIGHT WUNNEN NOUVO TOUKOHO 034 Q "


"IREVIEW TWO-PLAYER BALLS Speedball is best appreciated in two-player mode. Unfortunately, the game isn't reliant on pure skill because there's a special advantage in using joypad one! This means you get to choose the best team and you also head up the pitchfar more advantageous for potential goal scorers! They're even at half-time... UPDATE Speedball is available now on the ST and Amiga under Mirrorsoft's Mirror Image label for a paltry .99! There's also a C64 version out on the imageworks label which isn't bad at all. The game's sequel has also been released on the ST and Amiga (which recently received a massive 95% and 97% respectively)! PAUL SEZ... A The warp tunnel in all its glory! Sorry, but I didn't go for Speedball at all. The first impression created by the Amiga-like opening screens had my hopes raised, but the sprites in the game are pretty disappointing and aren't particularly well animated either. The actual gameplay didn't really grab me either just because it's so simplistic. There are hardly any tactics required apart from charging towards the opposition's goal, bashing the players out of the way and even that isn't as much fun as you'd expect, because the fighting players seem to get stuck together and the unclear graphics make the fight for the ball even more confused. At least on the Master System Speedball has originality on its side, but there are several more interesting Sega games coming onto the shelves at the moment, so if I was a Sega owner (which I am, actually), I'd go for Impossible Mission or Gauntlet rather than Speedball. Ardent sports fans may feel differently, but I don't think this will convert others. PAUL GLANCEY MONEY, MONEY, MONEY! Tokene litter the Speedball pitch and these can be used at the end of each game to buy extra tima, exdra stamina or extra power. More money buys more antaky options, like the opportunity to decrease your opponent's skills, or bribe the referee into cancelling all their goals! Xats moy!

"ZREVIEW I NINTENDO .95 V A quick scout and BY ACTIVISION Bad Gravity is a peculiar bloke. Travelling around the cosmos n armed only with a particularly lethal hairstyle, his mission in life is simple. For every planet that he visits in his intergalactic travels, he finds numbers. But these aren't boring numbers (Rad can prob ably come up with plenty of these without the need for cosmic travel in fact they're very important as these numbers are the beaming down co-ordinates for neighbouring planets. Unfortunate ly, these numbers are jealously guarded by the planet's inhabitants and being a very private lot, they don't fancy a visit from Rad much at all. When Rad beams down to a planet the view changes to a multidirectional scrolling platform playing area. Here the aim is simple, Using the amazing equipment on offer to co-ordinate collecting superheroes he blasts away the marauding aliens ever on the lookout for the elusive co-ordinates After these have been safely stashed in his ship's computer, Rad beams back to his interstellar steed and sets off for a new world where more daring adventures await... The Adventures of V Chill UPDATE It doesn't look as if Rad Gravity will be touching down on any other system apart from the NES. RAD GRAVITY TOOLKIT Rad starts the game with only two items to his credit. First off is his communications unit. When Rad is a bit low on energy, the communications unit beams him back to his trusty ship where he is revived with more energy. Rad also keeps his death-o-matic zapstick ever at the ready, so any repellent alien slime can be clobbered back into oblivion. As Rad progresses through the game, he finds plenty of extra equipment to add to his collection. This includes a zapgun (which is just the ticket for long-range alien blasting) and a new spacesuit!

The viewer also has a handy (and friendly) habit of keeping Rad informed of various events and handing out information when it's needed. \"hill out man! STAR SYSTEM SKILLS There are over ten worlds to discover before Rad believes he's got enough numbers in his collection. These worlds are spread over three star systems. Rad starts off his zany adventures in Cyberia, where a huge downpour of alien robots seek to ensure Rad's quick demise. At the beginning of the game, three star systems are found on Rad's map (Cyberia, Volcania, and Effluvia). Unfortunately, where Rad can actually beam down to is dictated by the co-ordinates he's collected and he only starts the game with one number! HP121 RICH SEZ... A A new world awaits... Muza NES owners are spoilt for choice when it comes to platform games. I mean, the Mario and MegaMan series just happen to be some of the best platform games in existence! It was with this in mind that I approached Rad Gravity. On the plus side, the game does have some of the most attractive sprites I've seen in a Nintendo gameespecially the huge Rad sprite when he's swanning about his space cruiser (what, you mean he's not there? ED). The backdrops are a tad bland, especially when compared to the huge variety of alien sprites. As far as gameplay goes, the emphasis is far more on action than puzzles as opposed to the Mario and Mega Man series, so if you found those classics a bit too taxing, you'd do well to have a look at what's on offer here.

The problem is, if Marty doesn't travel back to the Wild West, the good doctor will end up with a bullet in the back, courtesy of Buford Tannen, the desperado great-grandad of Marty's nemesis, Biff! Having made it back to 1885 (and wrecking the DeLorean's fuel line in the process), Marty now has to find Doc, who is madly in love with Clara Clayton, a schoolmistress from the past!

Ride 'em, Doc! A LEVEL ONE HORSEY HI-JINKS! The first level sees Doc giving chase to Claras runaway buckboard, which is heading straight for a ravine. No easy task, as the trail ahead is lit. tered with obstacles, which if hit, knock Doc off his horse delaying him from rescuing Clara. Other objects which 089900 have fallen from the buck. board can be picked up for bonus points. To make things even more complicated.

Starting off from the moving train's last carriage, Marty has to make his way to the front of the train, collecting seven special combustion logs, whilst avoiding more of Tannen's men, the train engineers, mailhooks, water towers and signals. Look out-duck! SAL ROB SEZ... I'm a big fan of the movies, but found the conversions of Back to the Future 2 little more than awful. So, keeping this in mind, I expected the worst from BTTF 3. But Probe (the team behind such hits as SCI and Turbo OutRun) have produced a tie-in which not only follows the film (to a reasonable extent) but is entertaining to play, too. The in-game graphics on both versions are very nice indeed, with some nicely animated sprites, but the intermission screens on the Amiga are a bit duff digitised pictures would have looked a lot better. The sound is okay, with some decent effects and background music, but the title track is a little weak. The only major quibble 1 have with BTTF 3 is the level of difficulty you have to work like crazy just to get off the first level, so novice gamers beware.

"REVIEW Can the DeLorean reach 88mph? BACK TO THE PLOT The original Back to the Future saw Marty McFly (Michael J Fox), catapulted back to the year 1955, courtesy of the won derfully eccentric Doctor Emmett Brown (played brilliantly by Taxi star Christopher Lloyd) and his plutonium-powered DeLorean time machine. Once back in 1955, all hell breaks loose, as the time machine runs out of juice, McFly's mum to be falls head over heels in love with her future son, and Marty has to match his rather mismatched future parents before he and his future family cease to exist. If you haven't seen it yet, this is highly recommended family entertainment at its funniest, and for only .99, a definite must buy RICH SEZ... BACK TO THE PLOT 2 Back to the Future ll continued the story, with McFly, his girl friend Jennifer and the Doc flying into the year 2015, where Marty has to ensure his son and daughter (both played by Fox) stay out of trouble but in the process, he inadvertently gives his arch-enemy Biff the chance to change history com pletely with the help of a sports almanac! So, in turn, Doc and Marly have to travel both to a nightmare 1985, and from there to 1955 in order to recapture and destroy the almanac to try to return 1985 to normal. Although more than a touch confusing in places (due to the leaps back and forward in time). Back to the Future Il is still a highly entertaining film, and well worth watching. I found Back to the Future 3 to be a reasonable game, desperately attempting to recreate the film. It succeeds quite well and has its own rather bizarre sense of humour. Fail in your attempts as Doc Brown to rescue Clara Clayton and an intermission screen shows her falling off the cliff with the caption \"I wish I was Mary Poppins!\". For every failed rescue attempt a new caption comes up including the inevitable \"Oh no! Not again!\". Marty even steps in and offers to help the incompetent Doc after about your fifth gol The humour is extended to all the graphics throughout the game and they serve the purpose admirably. The sound consists of decent effects (though Marty's gun sounds more like Dirty Harry's .44 magnum!) and tepid tunes. BTTF3 is a nice attempt at capturing the humour and atmosphere of the movie, but none of the sub-games have the depth to keep the player hooked for very long.

"REVIEW AMIGA BY CORE DESIGN .99 huck Rock is a tad annoyed. As this game's intro sequence reveals, the eponymous Mr Rock was enjoying a quiet afternoon sitting around naked in his cave while outside his wife hung out the washing (Chuck's only got one set of clothes, see). Could anything possibly spoil this scene of domestic bliss? Enter the twisted genius of the evil Gary Gritter. He was just enjoying a nice country walk in Stone Age England when he came across Chuck's cave and caught sight of this shapely wife. Overcome with Neanderthal lust he decided to snatch away the poor maiden and hide her at the end of five levels' worth of eight-way scrolling platform scenes. Pausing only to pick up a fig leaf to cover his embarrassment, Chuck sets out on a rescue mission... FLINTSTONE UPDATE FUMPIN' Chuck Rock is coming to an ST near you soon for the FISTICUFFS princely sum of .99. Ex In his pursuit for truth and juspect this version to be much tice, Chuck has a number of the same as the Amiga weapons that he can use game. Core also tell us that against his foes. First of all, they hope to convert Chuck by swinging his voluminous Rock onto the Megadrive, belly in the direction of any and they expect to have the enemy sprites he can game ready by December. bounce them to oblivion. Whilst jumping he can also deliver a lethal ninja kick to any who cross his path. ROC BOULDER DASH! Two different sizes of boulders litter the platform landscape and Chuck can pick these up and crush his prehistoric foes by throwing the rock straight on top of them. Rocks also double up as platforms which Chuck can climb for extra height. Carrying boulders over his head also protects Chuck's head from any nasty creatures that might decide to drop things on his head. A Molesting monsters. PAUL SEZ... A Chuck lobs a rock into the swamp. Although Core seem to be just knocking out platform game after platform game, find it hard to condemn them for this latest one, because it is probably their best so far, and is certainly miles better than Torvak. However, like Torvak, there isn't really that much to the gameplay just walk along, belly-butt the dinos, and collect the bonuses. But most of the enjoyment stems from the great cartoon graphics and the silly sound ef fects believe me, this has the potential to be made into a whole TV cartoon series. If Chuck had a few extra weapons or there was some break from scrolly platfor ming this would have scored a bit higher, but it's still a pretty entertaining game which is well worth trying out. PAUL GLANCEY "


"IREVIEW Climbing cliffs for fun and profit! Chuck's got some very irritating crabs. 20982ese RICH SEZ... TRANSPORTS OF DELIGHT Sometimes the path to the end of the level is blocked, so Chuck has to find an alternative means of transport. Some rocks give Chuck extra bounce when jumped upon just the ticket when there's a platform high above that needs to be reached. Chuck can also make use of some of the more docile dinosaurs to give him a hand when it comes to crossing some of the more tortuous parts of the Stone Age landscape. Chuck Rock is an immediately playable game. The gameplay is smooth, fast and furious with loads going on. Visually, it's equally superb. The game runs at 50 frames a second (that's just as smooth as any coin-op) and there's some excellent parallax scrolling. The graphical definition is also nothing short of outstanding. Each of the characters has a genuinely comic aspect to them and Chuck himself is great a mean, strutting bar barian with a massive beer belly. The sound too is top-hole. Watch out for the great music and excellent effects (Chuck speaks fluent caveman language) and Core appear to have sampled the hideous Captain Caveman TV show (remember that?) for some of the effects. Playability-wise, Chuck Rock is great with loads of levels to keep you occupied. Unfortunately, the action does tend to get a tad repetitive as the rock-throwing antics do not change that much between each level. Take a look by all means you won't be disappointed. RICHARD A Chuck gets a shock... ROCKY TERRAIN There are five sub-levels to each main level that makes a grand total of 25 scenes to traverse before Chuck can rescue his lusty wench. Chuck finds himself negotiating dangerous jungles and caves on his travels, and there's even a huge lake to swim through. One level even takes our hero into the guts of a colossal dinosaur where he takes out the enemy from within! The end of each level also presents Chuck with a large problem there's a huge dinosaur-like guardian present that Chuck must bombard with rocks before he progresses on to the next level!

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY SEGA After earning megabucks at the box office and in yellow mackintoshed merchandising, Warren Beatty's version of The World's Greatest Detective makes it to Megadrive. Like most heroic crimebusters, Dick Tracy is constantly on the hunt for all sorts of twisted criminals, and this time he's got a doozy of a case on his hands. The city's entire criminal element have taken to the streets, and quite simply, Dick has to eliminate them and track down their bosses as soon as possible. Naturally, the local criminals want to make sure the top copper gets his, but Dick is armed with his trusty tommy gun, revolver and powerful fists, and though the bad guys pile on from all sides, he can usually put them out of action with ease, clearing the way for him to sort out their bosses, and bring peace and justice back to the streets of the city. THANKS! Thanks to PC Engine Supplies (0782 712759) for loaning us the cartridge for this review. By the time you read this Dick Tracy should have been released officially by Sega for .99. PIEASY DICK MEETS BIG BOY Being the game of the film, this pits Dick against the same roque's gallery of villains Itchy, Flat Top. Lips Manlis, The Brow, Pruneface and Big Boy Caprice. However, in the past Dick has been confronted by all sorts of oddball crooks, in cluding Heels Beales and Slinky, but he's always been able to rely on the help of his pal Sam, his adopted son, Junior, his long-suffering girlfriend. Tess Trueheart and let's not for get the mysterious Vitamin Flintheart... A Dick rapidly shoots at the felons... MEANWHILE, AT THE POLICE TARGET RANGE. Whenever Dick collars a crook, he returns to his HQ to practise his marksmanship. Three targets spring up, some of which bear the likenesses of his enemies while others are pictures of innocent citizens. Of course, Dick has to gun down the gangsters, and leave the good guys intact. A good score is rewarded with a big point bonus and extra credits! A Dick readies himself to dive into the masses. 052 "


"REVIEW TO THE DICKMOBILE! Dick hasn't worked all these years to have to walk to the scene of a crime! When a criminal needs catching fast, he jumps on the running board of the nearest police car and tells the driver to put his foot down. Unfortunately, the bad guys are also automobile-equipped and they're right on Dick's tail. He has to gun them out of their cars before they can put bullet holes in that nice yellow coat of his. He also keeps his service revolver ready for any gangsters who try to sneak up behind him! The criminals are out to get Dick. The white mark shows where Dick's shooting Dick faces up to Why. PAUL SEZ... Megadrive Dick Tracy looked similar to the rather duff Master System version which we reviewed in Issue 112, so I wasn't expecting hours of thrills when I plugged this cart in. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This is a novel and highly enjoyable shoot/beat 'em up, whose gameplay reminds me a little of Shinobi. If it was just a case of walking left and right, gunning down gangsters as they walked onto the screen it would have been really dull, but the addition of the car chase sequences and having to keep the gangsters across the street at bay with the tommy gun provide the variety which makes Dick Tracy such fun. The graphics throughout are excellent; the gangsters constantly struggle to reload their guns, the Dick graphic in the shooting range looks just like Warren Beatty and you can riddle nearly all the scenery with bullet holes (destroying Lips Manlis' bar is great fun!) The music is a little weak, but the sound effects are excellent (I love the sound of breaking glass!). The game has three skill levels but I found it pretty tough even on the easiest setting with maximum credits, so leave it set to normal and you Megadrive Hards should enjoy playing with this Dick for a fair few hours. PAUL GLANCEY A Itchy blasts away at our hero! DT YAGA26 053 "


"REVIEW Sese UPDATE A similar (though not so good) version of Dick Tracy is available for the Sega Master System, and Titus have recently released some disappointing Tracy games on the home computers. Itchy buys it again! HHHHH WIN THE HISTORY OF DICK! Paul was down the MegaStore the other day and what should he see but this video which allegedly revealed the true story of Dick Tracy! How could anyone resist buying it? Answers on a... aha, no, that's not the competition. How. ever, this is. Paul has had the tape prised from his grasp because we thought that there might be a Tracy-loving, VHS video-owning reader out there who would like the video but who can't afford a tenner. If you think you are that person, write the name of the character Madonna plays in the 1990 movie on the back of a postcard and send it to the usual address marked \"I'M A REAL DICK-HEAD\". First card out of the mailsack on May 1st gets the vid. Cons crumble before Dick's fire. THE TRACY FILE Sunday, October 4th, 1941that was the day Dick Tracy started his very first case, in the comic pages of the Detroit Mirror. It was a time when gangsters like John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson ruled the streets of America with the aid of paid-off police officers, and it was this that gave cartoonist Chester Gould the inspiration for his super cop an unstoppable detective who stood for justice and terrorised criminals everywhere. Gould originally planned to call his hero \"Plain Clothes Tracy\", but Captain Joe Patterson, one of the editors at the powerful Tribune newspaper syndicate asked to have it changed to \"Dick\", the street name for a detective. The daily adventures of Dick Tracy were an instant hit, and it wasn't long before a cereal company sponsored a Dick Tracy radio show. During World War II. Dick was promoted from police detective to government agent, and his serialised adventures drew the crowds at Saturday morning matinees in cinemas across America. In 1945, Dick made his feature film debut fighting against Splitface in Dick Tracy, Detective, and other movies followed, pitting him against Cueball, The Claw and Gruesome. When TV became more popular in the 50s, a series of 39 Dick Tracy TV shows were produced. At the time, television wasn't subject to censorship and the shows were surprisingly violent, packed as they were with gun battles. RICH SEZ... I had the incredible misfortune to see the movie last summer and savoured all the enjoyment of a sore bottom because of it. Still, visually the film was a real feast and this strength has been successfully translated onto the Megadrive. The Dick Tracy sprite is particularly good and superbly animated. The sound comprises of some very tedious music, but the effects at least show some thought (the tommy gun sound is very satisfying, especially when you blast away some of Big Boy's automobiles!). Violence fiends are going to have a field day when they get their mitts on Tracy's tommy gun, and there's plenty of pistol-packing, fumpin' fisticuffs throw in for good measure! Okay, so Dick Tracy is over-priced (forty notes for an official release?) but if you liked the movie (oh come on!) or enjoyed the comics, or just fancy a good time on your Megadrive, take a good look at this.

When the heart is moving up the screen you can select levels just by pushing up or down on the joypad. MIDNIGHT RESISTANCE David Martin is a bit of an old sly boots. He's sent in an infinite lives cheat for Ocean's arcade conversion which requires the frustrated player to type the magic word SIAMESE into the high score table. The border should flash white, and you can now start the game with bill-yurns of soldiers at your disposal. Also, David says that owners of the tape version can advance, to the next level by ignoring the prompt to wind back the tape, to 0000 at the end of the game. Instead just press play, and the next section loads in. This is what the start of the first level looks like. Jump onto the bit marked 1, then from there jump to 2. Follow the direction of the arrow, right to the edge of the screen (don't fall down), then wait for a cloud to appear and jump onto it. You should see part of a bridge. Jump onto it and collect the figure to receive your extra goodies! 19 061 "

"AMSTRAD AAA More cheapo gear raises its ugly head this month in the Amstrad annals of computer entertainment. To add insult to injury, they're all re-releases not a single original release there at alll Richard Leadbetter scoops up the latest releases and heads for the CVG games room... 640 360 L.M L.M DRILLER HIT SQUAD .99 When the first Freescape game was released, the world and his uncle were extremely impressed by the combination of a real 3D environment and puzzling elements. The Amstrad version was the best 8-bit version with relatively fast 3D graphics and plenty to keep you at the computer. Depositing gas rigs has never been so much fun, so buy this game as soon as is humanly possible. OVERALL 92% INE HUSIKUSIEN STAGE E 9:59 STAGE ...NEWS FLASH... ...Infogrames have released 8bit versions of their ageing 16bit strategy game, North and South. North and South originally started out life as a comic book and the cartoon style graphics have made it into the 8bit conversion. Hopefully the groovy tunes will be there too. We'll let you know as soon we receive our review copy... ES S EASE PASSING SHOT ENCORE .99 Take to the digital Tennis courts with this new Encore re-release, previously available under the auspices of Imageworks. This game is a conversion of an obscure Sega coin-op which never really hit it big. and looking at the conversion, that's not surprising. This game is visually unexciting and the gameplay's about as inviting as a two-week holiday at the local abbatoir. Even if you're a Tennis fanatic who can't get enough of hitting balls, avoid this average effort. OVERALL 59% ... The prices of Amstrad's leisure computers have dropped. The GX-4000 console now retails at .99 that's a saving of .00. The Plus range of computers has also come down in price. However, the cheapest you can buy a 464 Plus for is still a wad-annihilating .99 and that's only with a grotty monochrome monitor... CONTINENTAL CIRCUS MASTERTRONIC PLUS .99 Teque's conversion of the Taito coin-op wasn't bad at all when it was first released many moons ago, and this situation hasn't changed now that the game has been released on budget. The road racing excitement might seem a tad dated, but otherwise there's plenty to keep you occupied as you travel the world participating in each race. Try it out if you're into this sort of thing. OVERALL 79% THE REAL GHOST BUSTERS HIT SQUAD .99 Here's something weird, and it don't look good. Featuring a bizarre set of colour schemes, the Real Ghostbusters is an inferior Commando-type game that shouldn't really be purchased at all. The best thing that can be said about it is that it's quite nippy, but the scrolling's jerky and the gameplay repetitive and the game soon annoys. OVERALL 59% ...Gremlin have announced their intention to release Switchblade on the Amstrad in cassette form. The cartridge game, though a little spartan in its colour schemes, had joypad-busting playability and the word is that the cassette versions (though graphically inferior) are actually faster than the cartridge game! Is it true? Stay with CVG for the definitive review... 068 "


"AMIGA BYTESIZEH Plenty of interest to keep you Amiga owners occupied this month, including a brace of new budget games. Corl Richard Leadbetter and Paul Glancey give you the low-down. CONTINENTAL CIRCUS 16 BLITZ PLUS .99 Burn up the speedways in your super-woofer Formula One beast. Continental Circus looks and plays quite similarly to the Taito coinop, but it's rather easy and the concept itself isn't far removed from the days of Pole Position. Formula One addicts should have a look. OVERALL 78% GEM' X KAIKO .99 A Jappo-Germanic puzzle game in which you have to change the colours in a pattern of gems on the left of the screen until it matches the layout on the right. Very easy to pick up, and there are lots of nice attract screens, but it's not going to replace Tetris. OVERALL 75% BATTLE STORM TITUS .99 Boasting 50 frames a second screen update, Battle Storm is at first sight a good, smooth, shoot 'em up. What lets it down are the dowdy colour schemes and the unspectacular power-ups and enemy sprites. Also, don't play it in easy mode, or you'll finish it in one go (as blasting klutz Paul did). OVERALL 75% ...NEWS FLASH... HILL STREET BLUES KRISALIS .99 Based on the long-running American cop show with a conscience, this icon-driven strategy game is set in a scrolling cityscape and your objective is to use the Hill Street officers to effectively deal with any 'situations'. A good use of the licence (where's the music though?) but the gameplay is a bit too complicated to be totally engaging OVERALL 74% ...We still wait with bated breath for the Amiga version of Midwinter 2: Flames of Freedom. Apparently the game was being developed alongside the ST version we reviewed last month. Hopefully next month the situafion will have changed, but until then... 08:53 ESCAPE FROM COLDITZ! DIGITAL MAGIC SOFTWARE .99 The title explains it all really. Strut the isometrically-scrolling corridors of Colditz attempting to find a way out, avoiding the evil Nazi guards on the way. The repetitive nature of the game makes it quite tedious after a while long before you've escaped from the infamous prison. OVERALL 63% ...Lucasfilm's The Secret of Monkey Island is just about ready for release. From what we've seen of the Amiga version it promises to be exactly like the brilliant PC game, with all the excellent graphics and laugh-a-minute japes included. Expect a review in Bytesize next month... ...Mirrorsoft's budget release schedule is bulging, with plenty of new games about to appear on the shelves at the very amiable price of .99. The next batch of releases promises to include the likes of Lords of the Rising Sun and the original Falcon both of them great games and a steal at the price... JUDGE DREDD VIRGIN GAMES .99 We didn't think much of Virgin's interpretation of Judge Dredd when we reviewed it on the ST, and unfortunately, the Amiga game is much the same. The platform game we have here isn't Dredd-ful, it's just remarkably average on all counts. A waste of the licence (again). SKI OR DIE ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 Five snowballing events are yours for the taking in this Amiga version of the fab PC game. Ranging from the innertube thrash to the downhill blitz, all of the events have smart graphics and Rob Hubbard sound. A weird and wonderful sports game which shouldn't be missed.

"CBM 64 BYTESIZEH CBM 64 Plenty of action in the C64 scene this month with loads of pretty decent games to keep you C64 gamers occupied. The big release this month must be System 3's Premier Collection, but more of that later. Richard Leadbetter takes the reviewer's hot seat armed only with his asbestos trousers. GREAT GURIANOS ENCORE .99 Great Gurianos has never been released before on its own (thank God) but unfortunately, Encore have exhumed this awful game and given it a new lease of life. They shouldn't have bothered. Tedious and unexciting gameplay combine with the awful graphics to make this a game that should be avoided at all cost. Its one redeeming feature is the pleasing music, but this alone doesn't justify the price tag. OVERALL 44% ...NEWS FLASH... CONTINENTAL CIRCUS MASTERTRONIC+ .99 Continental Circus is another tempting opportunity to became a Formula One driving fiend. Based on Taito's massive \"real\" 3D coin-op, this obviously doesn't have the same graphical quality of the coin-op (the 3D effect and the sprites are a bit ropey), but it's still surprisingly playable. If you're on the lookout for a cheapy road racer you could do a lot worse. OVERALL 76% DIPLOMACY PASSING SHOT LEISURE GENIUS .99 ENCORE .99 \"The game of international inSega's virtually unknown tennis trigue' reaches the C64 courtecoin-op (it never reached British sy of Leisure Genius. The board shores!) was never really that game is something of a cult (Di much cop at all. The mixture of plomacy players have been top-down and 3D arcade action known to marry (and divorce!) doesn't seem to work very well, because of the game!) with and the range of shots is pretty loads of backstabbing and cun limited. I wouldn't buy this if I ning required to take over the were you. world. This interpretation is very OVERALL 59% well-presented, though apart from the computer players, it's no real progression from the board game. THE SYSTEM 3 OVERALL 70% PREMIER COLLECTION SYSTEM 3 .99 Sixteen quid buys you one of the best compilations I've ever laid eyes on for the C64. Last Ninja 1 and 2 have been included in the package and this alone yields hours of gameplaying satisfaction (if you haven't played them before). Flimbo's Quest is a fun scrolling platform game and Dominator is a pretty uninspiring shoot 'em up. This leaves Myth and International Karate both of which are excellent games that deserve to be in your collection. For sixteen quid (twenty on disk), this is great value for money. Buy, buy, buy! OVERALL 95% ...Word has it that the future of Commodore games on cassette is very doubtful. In a rather bizarre move, Commodore are continuing to ship the best-selling C64 but without the addition of either a datacorder or a disk drive! Commodore still want the C64 to be seen as a cartridge-based machine (even after the disappointment of the C64GS console), so future owners will have to buy either a C2N datacorder or a disk drive to access the vast library of C64 games. Perhaps this indicates that Commodore are putting their weight behind further C64 cartridge-only products like System 3's Last Ninja CLUEDO MASTER DETECTIVE LEISURE GENIUS .99 As Sherlock Holmes would say: \"The game is afoot!\". Mr Boddy (a dead cert for a corpse if ever there were one) of Boddy Manor has met with a grave and horrific death and as an expert Cluedo player, it's your job to sort out the mess and find the killer. Just like Diplomacy, this game is well-presented and faithful to the board game, so Cluedo fans'll probably flip for this. OVERALL 70% ...If you're after one of the best road racers available for the C64, then look out for Gremlin's Lotus Turbo Esprit Challenge. It looks like being the best thing since Pitstop 2, featuring the same brand of splitscreen two-player antics. Apparently, it ranks as the speediest road racer yet seen on the C64 certainly worthy of the Lotus name! As soon as we're handed a finished copy, we'll review it here in Bytesize... "


"BYTESIZE GAME BOY There's a veritable avalanche of goodle Gameboy gear out at the moment, both official and unofficial releases! Pausing only to retrieve his Gameboy from the murky depths of hls Puma sports bag, Richard Leadbetter takes a gander at the latest releases. ROBOCOP OCEAN AMERICA .99 Featuring the same brand of horizontally scrolling death and sublevel puzzle games, Robocop is graphically and sonically average. The gameplay itself is also a bit on the frustrating side, and many Robo-deaths occur before you even conquer the first level! If you can put up with that, this isn't a bad offering. OVERALL 72% KWIRK NINTENDO .99 Kwirk is a very strange puzzle game that revolves around the antics of a man who wanders around rooms pushing revolving doors around to find a route to the exit. But pushing one door might close off another part of your route, so plenty of brain-power is the prescrip tion for success. Puzzle freaks will undoubtedly get a good kick out of it. OVERALL 88% ...NEWS FLASH... REVENGE OF THE 'GATOR NINTENDO .99 There's a distinct lack of decent Gameboy pinball games, but Revenge of the Gator turns out to be one of the best games of its type ever! There're loads of hidden bonuses and ball movements so realistic, you'll be trying to tip the Gameboy about to tilt the table! Another essential buy for self-respecting Gameboy owners. OVERALL 93% CONTRA KONAMI .00 Better known as Gryzor to hardened UK arcadesters, this conversion ranks as one of the best Gameboy carts in existence!

CHASE HQ TAITO .99 Oo-er! Someone's definitely made a cardinal cock-up when it came to converting Taito's car chase coin-op onto the Gameboy. We're talking hideous 3D graphics, wobbling sounds and almost non-existent playability. Ignore the big name and leave this cart well alone. OVERALL 31% BALLOON KID NINTENDO .99 This bizarre release stars a girl who flies around the horizontally scrolling screens with the aid of a clutch of balloons! Watch out for the evil sprites and spikes, desperate to pop your balloons! Strangely addictive, Balloon Kid is quite enjoyable but the repetitive action makes it a short-lived game. OVERALL 68% ...Out now is Mindscape's conversion of Paperboy, priced at .99. From what we've seen of the game, the graphics look "

"BYTESIZE SEGA Plenty of Sega products on offer this month, ranging from pretty good to pretty abysmal. There's plenty of heavy duty licensed names as well, including Strider, Dynamite Duke and Ghouls 'n' Ghosts. Trying to sort out the wheat from the chaff, Richard Leadbetter takes a trip Into Sega-land. GOLDEN AXE WARRIOR SEGA .99 All this has in common with the superb Sega beat 'em up is the title! Golden Axe Warrior is in fact a sprawling medieval RPG with little or no excitement on offer. The one redeeming feature is the size of the game (and the battery back-up), but in all other departments it's severely lacking. A big disappointment for Golden Axe fans. OVERALL 42% GHOULS 'N' GHOSTS SEGA .99 Another arcade conversion, Ghouls 'n' Ghosts casts you as Sir Arthur whose job is simply to traverse the multi-directionally scrolling playfield, using a choice of magic and weapons to deal with the un dead. The graphics and sound are very close to the coin-op and the playability isn't bad either with only a few minor glitches in the collision detection throwing a spanner in the works. OVERALL 81% ...NEWS FLASH... CYBER SHINOBI SEGA .99 It's Joe Mushashi versus the evil Cyber Zeed in this 21st Century version of Shinobi. This is actually inferior to its prequel and though the graphics might look fine in a static state, they move jerkily. What's worse is that Cyber Shinobi is seriously lacking in challenge I completed it on my second attempt, so Shinobi fans should stick with the original. ...Out and about soon on the Master System is Joe Montana's Football another American Football game for the Master System. This is a conversion of the Megadrive game that's available now on import (which has been overshadowed slightly by the superlative John Madden Football) and we should have a copy available for review next month... OVERALL 46% ...Just in case last month's Sega Moonwalker news piece didn't make it obvious, we'd better point out that you only get the Moonwalker game and video when you buy a Master System or Megadrive, and you can't buy the pack separately... Lidooz MAGIG. HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BOXING SEGA .99 This boxing game (converted from the coin-op of the same name) suffers from the fact that the excitement is short-lived. With two players you only have one fight together, and in one player mode there are only five boxers to confront. The action is a tad repetitive after a while as well. Not a complete disaster, but a little thought could have made it a lot better. OVERALL 69% DYNAMITE DUKE SEGA .99 Contending with Op Wolf for the title of top Sega Mow 'em Down is this conversion which is remarkably similar to the coin-op. The graphics and sonics are both polished and the game. play, though limited, is very entertaining with there plenty of power-ups spicing up the action. The only problem is that the game is too easy to complete and you may even do it on your first go, so if possible try before you buy. OVERALL 78% ...Mirrorsoft are set to release Xenon 2 on the Master System! According to people who've seen the game in action, it's looking a tad on the good side with some incredible visuals! Mirrorsoft have also got games like Back to the Future 2 lined up for release. Apparently this game follows a similar theme to the average computer games released last year. "


"SPECTRUM BYTESIZEH Yet more budget re-release malarkey makes up the Speccy scene this month, and there's not really that much worthy of note, apart from HiTec's latest cartoon tie-in. Armed with a fistful of new games, Richard Leadbetter puts on his technicolour reviewing hat and comes back with these reports. PASSING SHOT ENCORE .99 Time to stride on down to the tennis court and whack some yellow balls about in this Speccy adaptation of the unknown Sega coin-op. Switching between top-down and 3D views, this isn't an awful Tennis game, but aspiring Edbergs should look elsewhere. Come to think of it, Psion's antique Match Point offered superior playability so look around for that instead. OVERALL 68% SCOOBY AND SCRAPPY DOO HITEC .99 Take control of Scrappy Doo in search of Scooby and the wimpy Shaggy in this horizontally scrolling platform romp. There are four pretty large levels to conquer and the game itself is good, solid entertainment. The graphics (though monochromatic) capture the knockabout atmosphere of the cartoon and there is a nice variation in the backgrounds and sprites. The gameplay, although simple, is very en tertaining. One for Speccy fans to keep their eyes peeled for. OVERALL 88% ...NEWS FLASH... GREAT GURIANOS ENCORE .99 \"Previously unreleased on its own!\" reveals the packaging and once loaded in you can see why. The sprites are hideously animated with obscene colour schemes, and the sword-slashing playability is non-existent due to dodgy response and tedious gameplay. The coin-op featured banal gameplay and this conversion captures that aspect perfectly. Save your dosh for something different. OVERALL ...Gremlin's awesome scrolling Super Sprint-esque effort, Super Cars has finally been released on the Spectrum. Of course, the graphics aren't quite as brilliant as the Amiga, but they're still pretty good and all the road racing action has been packed in. Keep your eyes peeled for this one... CONTINENTAL CIRCUS MASTERTRONIC PLUS .99 Ready yourself for plenty of high-speed thrills, spills 'n' automobiles in this re-release of the Sales Curve's version of the 3D Taito coin op. Obviously, the 'real' 3D and the superb graphics are missing. but this game is still pretty playable and ranks as one of the better road racers that we've seen of late. Check it out. OVERALL 80% yen my 39% ...More Gremlin news comes in the form of Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge! This cracking game received 94% in these hallowed pages when the Amiga version was first reviewed. We've had a good look at the Speccy version and although all of the features of the 16-bit game have been retained, the game does play a little on the slow side... BA FIRE 001800 ...Old hat on the 16-bit machines but brand new on the Spectrum is North and South, Infogrames strategy game based on a French comic. From what we've seen, the game looks remarkably similar to the Amiga game and even the sound is close too! If you're into this sort of thing then this is a must... 1+1 021 SI "


"MEGADRIVE This month's Megadrive Bytesize has a distinctly American sporty feel to it, as Robert Swan found out, but as per usual, a shoot 'em up manages to work its way in... PAUSE JOE MONTANA FOOTBALL SEGA .00 I'm no big fan of American football (good ol' soccer's more my thing). but I know enough to realise that Joe Montana is nowhere near as thrilling or entertaining as the superlative John Madden. So, if gridiron is your bag, go for that instead. OVERALL 77% FinaG SUPER REAL VOLLEYBALL SEGA .00 Unfortunately, this conversion of the US beach-sport isn't nearly as fab as it could have been. The graphics are rather poor flat, horizontally-scrolling court and the animation isn't particularly eye-catching. Sound is ok, but it hardly stretches the Megadrive's capabilities and yes, I'm afraid to say, gameplay is basic and ultimately dull. It may appeal to die-hard volleyball freaks is there any such person? OVERALL 52% ...NEWS FLASH... ULTIMATE TIGER TRECO .00 Having enjoyed the quite addictive PC Engine version of this vertical scroller, I was rather disappointed to find that the Megadrive version falls down drastically, both in audio-visual and playability aspects. In the end, it's just another blast', and not a very good one at that. OVERALL 66% SUPER LEAGUE BASEBALL SEGA .00 All the fun of a silly American pastime, the basis of which they pinched off us British anyway, in the form of this lovely Megadrive release. Featuring everything you'd expect to find in a Baseball sim, such as throwing balls, hitting balls, etc, Super League has a much more arcadey feel to it than most other games of this type, and for that it comes up trumps. OVERALL 86% ... Coming soon to a Megadrive near you: Pit Fighter, courtesy of Tengen, Fantasia, based upon the awesome Disney movie starring Mickey Mouse, The Amazing Spider-Man, and a conversion of the cracking Sega coin-op, Alien Storm... PAUSE ...An update on the eagerlyawaited CD-ROM unit for the Megadrive all would-be megamemory fanatics are going to have to wait until the end of the year (at least) before the hardware even sees the light of daythen you'll have to wait even longer for the games...

"SPSC REVIEW .99 AMIGA BY OCEAN All hell's breaking loose down in the junglel One minute, every thing's normal, the next, an evil witch has spirited away the lovely Miho, and turned her beefcake boyfriend Toke into an ape! So, rather than monkey about, or go bananas, Toki is out to find his girl, and regain his manhood. This entails leaping around numerous platform-strewn levels, climbing vines, spitting deadly monkey phlegm at myriad nasties, and, gibbon halt a chance (yurrgh), picking up the power-ups and bonuses that lie scattered about. Also in the offing is an American Football-style helmet, with which you can nut (monkey nut-geddit? No? Oh, never mind...) any creepy-crawly stupid enough to get too close for comfort! Plenty of monkey business (and awful captions) PARLEZ VOUS OCEAN? Ocean France are certainly no newcomers to the coin-op conversion scene their past credits include Operation Wolf, the 16 bit versions of Plotting, and the excellent Pang. Cur rently in production is a conversion of Taito's cracking Snow Bros for the full lowdown, check out the exclusive preview on page 106! TEHN-HPE ES ROB SEZ... Toki faces up to the first and o Hevel boss Toki was a fun coin-op to play, but suffered from a severe difficulty problem. the whole thing was dead tough, and overly frustrating to say the least. The Amiga conversion is stunning in its audio-visual aspects, but unfortunately suffers from a similar problem. The graphics are little short of coin-op perfect, and the folly. boppy jungle-style track is a treat to the ears. But after about half an hour of play, you just want to sling the Joystick through the nearest window! All credit to Ocean France for a spot-on conversion, it's simply that the ar cade original is too frustrating to be entertaining for any great length of time. More experienced arcadesters may well enjoy Tokl, but your average joystick Jockey will be pulling their hair out by the roots before long. ROBERT SWAN 078 "


"I REVIEW S250 RICH SEZ... Toki uses the Amiga's superior colour palette to the max. You get a great 32 colour picture here with some excellent shading on all of the sprites and brill parallax on the backdrops. The sound is similarly cool, with get-up-and-boogie toons and adequate effects. So, technically speaking, Toki is a great conversion in that it emulates the coin-op pretty well. Unfortunately, as Rob said, the coin-op was annoyingly difficult in places. It's a game of learning, not skill. Just as you think that you're doing well something'll drop on you without warning and you're dead. That's a shame really as it's only this aspect that makes the game unappealing. Credit where credit's due for making such a technically excellent game, but I don't think you'll get twenty-five quids' worth of entertainment for this one. RICHARD LEADBETTER Mivel guardians threaten our hero! Nolt, Cur-now iew RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE Get that token, Tokil Toki gets meant p to ma mlead HARPES ting miga nits but ma The Toki's not exactly defenceless, but there are times when his firepower just isn't enough. To aid our hapless hero in his quest, power-ups have been dotted around, which bestow the following abilities: POWER-UP Increases the size and speed of Toki's fireballs. SPIN BLAST The shots from this spin out in front, a la RType. SPREAD Two way shot, which dishes out a great deal of damage. FLAME THROWER Equivalent to drinking half a gallon of paraffin, and setting light to it! HELMET Allows Toki to headbutt any nasties that venture too close, but only for a short period of time. ally, after the ean arany may I be UPDATE Toki should be swinging onto the ST (.99), GX-4000 cart (.99). C64 cart (.99) and Spectrum (.99). How the other versions bear up will be revealed in future Bytesize sections hopefully, the level of difficulty will be a heck of a lot easier!

"REVIEW .99 BY RENEGADE et us hearken back to the days of old, when the Gods themselves built a gigantic city steeped in legend a city filled with great temples, hidden labyrinths, and treasures beyond mortal man's wildest dreams. But soon the Gods became bored with their paradise, and abandoned it to the forces of evil it became a city of fear, a fortress of darkness filled with traps and evil creatures, and the lair of four powerful demons. The Gods, in their rashness, laid down a challenge: Any man may earn, through skill and courage, a single favour of the gods if he will face the fear of the ancient city and slay the four great guardians who have stolen our citadel from us. One man, mighty of build and skilled in the ways of war, has taken the Gods up on their promise. His one request should he succeed in his quest, is that he should be allowed to stand amongst the Gods as an equal. Horrified with their mistake, but unable to go back on their word, the Gods can only watch and hope that the lone warrior's battle ends in failure... TESTET Danger ahoy! WEAPONS OF WAR A The first evil guardian... ZDRZE The first weapon the warrior finds is a meagre dagger but as you get further into the citadel, more powerful weapons can either be found or bought (more on that later), with which the warrior can increase his fighting potential: SHURIKENS: Stronger than daggers, these weapons don't travel through platforms, but do a heck of a lot of damage to any denizen of the underworld that's foolish enough to get in the way! FIREBALLS: A powerful weapon, Fireballs can be used at the same time as conventional weapons such as the dagger or shurikens. AXE: A really hefty weapon, this not only continues on through creatures, but flies through platforms as well any nasties out of range from shurikens or daggers will be obliterated by this! SPEAR: Similar to the Axe, the Spear flies through both creatures and platforms, but does much more damage. 222 082 "


"REVIEW POTIONS OF The key to the next POWER world! Like weapons, potions can be either found or purchased along the way to aid the warrior's struggle: HEALTH: These come in two types; the small hearts restore half of your life energy, whereas the larger varlety take it up to maximum. DISTRACT: This causes all creatures to avoid you like the plague either that or you're wearing the wrong aftershave. ATTRACT: The reverse of the above this causes all creatures to attack you on sight!

GODS is definite proof of this the sheer size of the city is enough to have any would-be hero foaming at the mouth! The graphics are brilliantly designed and animated, and packed to the brim with colour and detail the guardians have to be seen to be believed! The sound is also tops, with a cracking title track from Nation 12, and the spot effects enhance the overall atmosphere greatly. The puzzles and traps which have to be overcome have been designed in such a manner that players have a decent shot at completing the game not just getting a little way into it before getting bogged down! Overall, a cracker of a game, and one that carries on the Bitmap's tradition of excellent product. Go forth and grab this now, or the Gods will not be too happy! ROBERT SWAN 200020293 ID "

A Scooping up the bonuses LE 140 Yeah, I agree with Rob. Gods is a bit on the tasty side. For the ST (and the Amiga come to think of it), the graphics are exquisite (though our hero walks a mite strangely) and the sound is fantastic. But nice graphics and sound don't add up to much on their own without a decent game to spice up the proceedings, so it's nice to see Gods delivering the goods. The mixture of platform puzzling and arcade action combines to make a game that is very satisfying to play. Special note must go to the powerup weaponry available during the game it's just great, and the range of Icons means you can choose your own favourite type of fire (accompanied by great sound effects here as well, I might add). Twenty five quid is a fat pile o' cash for a game, but Gods offers instant action and lastability too and is well worth every penny. Please have a look at this, It's one of the best 16-bit games I've played of late and a great debut for Renegade. RICHARD LEADBETTER Here's ths shop, and there's the shopkeeper below! WHO'S GOING TO THE SHOP? Money can be collected from around the city in the form of crystals and diamonds. Most of these are collected from the various monsters wandering about, but secret rooms can be located, and these are usually filled with all sorts of goodies.

"29 REVIEW AMIGA .99 .99 BY US GOLD/SSI EYE OF THE All is not well in the city of Waterdeep. It's true, its citizens have suffered a turbulent past, what with the Troll Wars and the power struggle between the Guilds, but just when they had begun to enjoy peaceful prosperity, the shadow of a few evil fias appeared on the horizon. What and where this evil is, is a question that baffles the ruling Lords Magister, and so they have sent out a plea for heroes who can seek out the source of the problem and eradicate it. And so it is that a party of four adventurers are commissioned to search the sewer system beneath Waterdeep. But every step of their journey is being watched by the malevolent force under the city, and it doesn't intend to let them live for much longer... We commission you to find the nature of this evil, and destroy it if you are able Meet Jon the elf. The quest awaits Character Generation JON ELF MALE MAGE 3993 BICH CHA 18 DELAKO CHARACTER BUILDING Before the game begins, you have the option of starting the quest with a ready-made party of four adventurers, or creating your own. To do this, you first select the race each character belongs to these are the usual Advanced Dungeons and Dragons races Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Half-Elves, Halflings and Humans), and this affects the classification you can then select for them. For instance, Dwarves are not magical beings, and so cannot become Mages, but they make good fighters. Other typical AD+D character attributes are then set by the roll of simulated dice. You can reroll as often as you like, but if you would rather, you can fix the character's strength, dexterity, intelligence and so on, manually. That done, it only remains to provide that character with a name and a face and he or she is ready to join the group. Oops! Paul's taken the poison! Give call to the heroes of the land, and let us choose our champions. A LEGK Fantasy Role-la 086 "


"REVIEW 2525 A sticky situation... # BEHOLDER 22 OF 22 28 OF 28 21 OF 21 27 OF 27 TAGHOR 45 OF 45 GAME ANOTHER DUNGEON MASTER LOOKALIKE? Anyone who has ever played FTL's classic Dungeon Master will find it very easy to accustom themselves with the workings of Eye of the Beholder. The whole environment is displayed in a 3D view, which updates as you take the party through the sewer. Similarly, all the creatures lurking in the corridors are displayed with large animated sprites which make monstrous noises as they attack. Eye of the Beholder's control system is also similar to Dungeon Master's insofar as you can use a mouse to click on an object from the 3D display and place it in any of the charPAUL SEZ... I'm not much of an RPG lover all that business with calculating hit points and taking turns is a real atmosphere-killer, I think. But Dungeon Master was different: It was fast, you saw the fireballs whizzing at you, the monsters leapt out in front of you and screamed, and the puzzles were really clever too. So it became my alltime favourite game, and I've always been very wary of any lookalike that tried to steal its crown. There've been some good attempts, definitely, but until now, none has really matched the original for ingenuity, quality and atmosphere. Eye of the Beholder is the game that has changed that. Certain aspects of this game aren't quite as good as Dungeon Master (I preferred DM's concoct-yourown-spell system and the constant problem of running out of light was novel), but there are other aspects which are better, namely the ability to interact more fully with the sewer's denizens and recruit new adventurers, and the fact that the equipment screen and the 3D window can both be visible simultaneously. The only thing Dungeon Master had that this doesn't have was originality, but I'm prepared to let that pass if you will. Now FTL, beat this... please!

Likewise, doors, secret buttons and interesting features are opened, activated or examined by placing the pointer over them and clicking. The spell system is the main area where this game differs from DM. Instead of having to piece together spells from runes, a mage or cleric can memorise or pray for any which are within his capabilities while he rests. He will then have a \"stockof spells to use while exploring. ZANE Death lurks at every corner. ROB SEZ... TOD UPHILL 22 OF 2 TAGHOR I'm not what you'd call the greatest fan of this style of game a good flight sim or a decent blast is more my thing but Dungeon Master was definitely a title I could return to time and time again (the addictive nature and playability were enough to keep me hooked for weekends on end). Now Eye of the Beholder has arrived, and, as Paul says, there are certain factors here that improve upon the famed classic (the character interaction is absolutely excellent), but there are also a few niggling facets that leave a little to be desired, namely the delay whilst being attacked this pause more often that not results in your taking a great deal of damage! The graphics and sound, however, are nothing short of stunning, and the sheer playability of EOB is enough to have the greenest adventurer frothing at the mouth. If RPGs are the thing to get your pulse racing, Eye of the Beholder will blow your mind. Grab it at the first opportunity, but be prepared to spend a l-0-0-0-0-n-g time playing!

SPELL TO GET WELL JOIN THE PARTY One of the other differences between Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master is the fact that the size of the party is limited to six, not four. Although you start with four charac ters, others often appear, offering their services later in the game. It's also worth collecting any bones you see along the route, as an accomplished cleric can usually resurrect them into a grateful adventurert il you have a full party then come across a more capable character, it's possible to drop one of the current members to let the stronger adventurer join Also, the characters can be moved around within the forma tion, so that the stronger ones travel at the front to bear the brunt of any frontal attacks (although monsters can attack from any side!). Three classifications of character have mystical powers which can be used to aid the quest Clerics (and their associates, the Paladins) can call on the powers of the gods to heal and protect themselves and their friends. They can also use their power to injure their enemies, but Mages are more capable combatants, and even novices can project dangerous balls of energy at their enemies. As well as using their stock of memorised spells, Mages and Clerics can make use of any magic scrolls they find dur ing the journey, providing an instant spell whenever its needed 088 "


"REVIEW PSS Hole in the ground ahoy! GETTING EQUIPPED Each character starts the game armed and armoured pretty simply, and it is up to you to bolster their equipment as you progress. Plate mail armour affords greater protection than leather. Elves can make very good use of a bow and ar rows, and Mages and Clerics can usually put potions and magic rings to good use. Clicking on a character's face summons his equipment screen which displays the objects he has collected on his journey so far. The backpack on the left of the screen can hold 14 items, and the other boxes indicate where an object will be carried. There is a quiver for arrows, and a belt pouch which holds three objects (particularly useful for carrying daggers or darts, as the character automatically re arms from the pouch as soon as a weapon has been thrown) 29 OF 291 TAGHOR 21 OF 21 A character confrontation... Hmmm.... interesting! TAGHOR RICH -10 OF 45 -10 OF 33 25 OF 25 21 OF 21 THAT HELP YOU. HOWEVER, IF YOU HLO BE TREING LEAVE UPDATE RIDDLE-ME-REE! The sewers under Waterdeep are not all they appear, and even the three-level map provided with the game does not reveal many of their secrets. The creatures that wander the galleries have planted many traps to ensure their privacy. A locked door can be a frustrating obstruction, but not once you ve found the key picked the lock or used brute force to shove it open. Also, watch out for disguised wall switches which open and close pits, or operate teleports and elevator rooms. Some walls are simply illusions, so it's worth looking out for markings which could be Dwarvish runes or sale pa sage, as they may lead to treasure rooms... or perhaps something not so welcome! Alas, there are no plans to convert Eye of the Beholder to any other formats not even ST! COMBAT MAN On the main screen each character has two boxes by his name. The top one shows what is in the \"primary hand\", this is the item which will be used as a weapon in any attack, so it's usually the best place to carry a sword or mace. The \"secondary hand\" is a good place to carry a shield Should a monster manage to strike one of the party, that member loses some of his health points. If his health rating goes below zero he is rendered unconscious, and cannot fight again until he has rested and been healed. If the rating reaches -10 then that character dies and plays no further part in the game unless resurrected. Watch out for poisonous monsters which strike down your heroes with venom which continually saps their strength until they die or they're cured (and that can only be done by a fourth-level Cleric). 93 GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABIL LASTABIL GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 94 LASTABILITY 95 OVERALL 96 OVERALL 95 089 "

"REVIEW .99 .99 The latest fashions from Paris. PROSHOP MEGADRIVE  BY ELECTRONIC ARTS DGA Tour Golf is a simulation of that most frustrating of pastimes, involving whacking a small rubber-coated sphere over a certain distance using clubs with either metal or wooden heads. The aim of the game is to get the ball into a cup embedded in a lawn using as few shots as possible. The less shots the hole takes, the more points you score. The player who took the fewest shots to finish the game (be it over nine or eighteen holes) wins simple, yes? PGA Tour Golf can have up to four players participating at once over four different courses, and there's even a battery-backed RAM option to save your tournaments to continue at a later date. Right, everyone ready now? Fore! (Cue thwack of ball closely followed by sound of breaking glass...) PGA TOUR GOLF WIND STRENGTH: It's quite a blustery day! This 17 mph breeze could send your 16 yard pitch onto the green a few feet off to the right. 15 mph Hole *3 162 yards Par 3 DISTANCE POTENTIAL: At full whack, this club can take the ball 26 yards. Get a quick look at your only enemy: the course! THE OVERSWING AREA: Let the stroke bar rove this far left and you get extra stroke power. BUT! Unless you hit the ball dead straight it's liable to zip off at a wild angle, so use with care! The first hole. Spot the incompetent HOME, HOME ON THE RANGE C at Sawgrass PGA Tour Golf has two practice ranges to help novice stance: 159 yards players perfect their stroke the driving range for teeingoff, and the putting green for those short-range taps. Driv. Hole 1 388 yards ing off using a 1 Wood at full power may result in the ball veering off erratically to one side simply try aiming for the other side of the range, and watch the ball fly back on screen! Par 4 Distance is yer Club: iron 092 TPC at Sawgrass Distance: 154 uords "


"REVIEW A MATTER OF COURSE Hole #2 511 yards Par 5 PGA Tour Golf has a grand total of four different courses, each with their own tricks and traps. The first is the standard course, to give new players a chance to get used to the game, but the other three are a bit more difficult to get to grips with. The Tournament Players Club (or TPC) at Sawgrass in Florida is where the main tournament takes place, and is renowned for its difficult 17th hole. The PGA West Stadium Course at La Quinta consists of thin fairways and massive bunkers, making play that bit more difficult, whereas the TPC at Avenel is the most difficult of all, with multilevel greens and driving cross-winds. TPC at Sawgrass Distance: 507 yards UPDATE PGA Tour Golf is already out and about for the PC (.99), and is remarkably similar to the versions reviewed here. No other versions are planned for the moment, but if anything crops up, you'll be the first to know. SEWY WHO? The Professional Golfer's Association Championships are amongst the biggest golf tournaments of the year, with some players managing to grab in excess of well over a million (count 'em) dollars in winner's prizes! Here's a list of the winners of the PGA Tournament from 1980 to 1989: YEAR WINNER 1980 Jack Nicklaus 1981 Larry Nelson 1982 Ray Floyd 1983 Hal Sutton 1984 Lee Trevino 1985 Hubert Green 1986 Bob Tway 1987 Larry Nelson 1988 Jeff Sluman 1989 Payne Stewart Hole #1 PM Stroke 5 E Distance: 42 uds. Club:P Wedge THE INFO BOX: Which hole is this? What par is it? How many strokes have you had? Is that over, under or on par? How far from the cup are you? And which club are you holding? The info box holds all this information. ROB SEZ... THE STROKE BAR: Once you've set the shot up, hit the button to start your backswing and watch the stroke bar expand leftward. Press the button again and it stops. Stop it on 50% in this case and the ball will be whacked with enough power to take it about 13 yards. THE ACCURACY POINT: Accuracy is all down to timing. Stop the moving bar on this line and the ball is hit straight towards the aiming cross-hair. But stop it on the left of the accuracy point and the ball is hooked left, and stopping it on the right slices it to the right! Although golf isn't one of my favourite sports, I have a great deal of admiration for players of the game the amount of skill involved would have most people pulling their hair out in minutes! Golf games are a popular enough subject (heck, there've been enough of them), but few are either accurate or playable enough to grab the attention for long. PGA Tour Golf is not only an accurate and playable golf game, but it has to rank as one of the best simulations of any sport. In practically every respect, PGA is excellent the game itself is very addictive indeed, with some excellent graphics and sound, and the number of options will have any golf freak foaming at the mouth!

Close-up Hole #2 Per Stroke? + Distance:3t Club: Putter THE PGA TOUR A BRIEF HISTORY The first developments of the PGA Tour began back in the 1920s, and were held on the West Coast of America, Texas and Florida. By the middle of the decade, the Tour was offer ing a whacking $77.000 in total purses! By the Thirties, des pite the Depression, golf tournaments were attracting large, crowds, with such names as Paul Runyan (the leading money winner of 1934's tournament) taking a total of $6.767 (it's interesting to note that 1989's top money win ners. Tom Kite and Payne Stewart, each earned well in ex cess of a million dollars!) After World War II, the Tour grew in size, and as the poten tial television audience increased in the late Fifties and early Sixties, so did the amount of interest in the game, Thanks to advertising revenues, the prize purses were grow ing at an enormous rate, and between 1974 and 1990. PGA Tour assets have leapt from $730,000 to an incredible $80 million! RICH SEZ... PGA Tour Golf was one of the finest golf games ever when it was first released on the PC, and it's nice to see that Electronic Arts have both the Amiga and Megadrive versions ready for almost simultaneous release. It's even more of a pleasure to find that both games are of an extremely high quality. Indeed, I might venture to say that PGA Tour Golf is the best golfing game you can get for either the Megadrive or the Amiga, encompassing just about every aspect of golf imaginable (and you don't even have to dress up in silly clothes and hang out with Tarby). The vast amount of options, coupled with the brill graphics and saucy sonics (Rob Hubbard strikes AGAIN)! make for a complete all-rounder in the quality stakes. Each hole is exceptionally challenging and there's a great sense of competition evoked should you go for the multiplay game. PGA Tour Golf is starting to have the same effect as John Madden Football did in the office at the moment (people tend to \"disappear\" for a quick round) and weighs in as one of the best sports games available on the Megadrive take a look!

"REVIEW PC ENGINE .00 BY HUMAN It's time to grab those balls and make a right old racquet (eh?). with Final Match Tennis for the PC Engine. Viewed in pseudo-3D, either one, two, three or four players (via a multi-tap) can participate in an exhibition match or compete in a world tournament, in either one or three sets. Novice players (that's anyone in the British squad to the rest of US) can practice swinging the old catgut against a number of computer-controlled opponents, including a training machine which blasts balls towards you like there's no tomorrow! If things get a little hairy, two players can team up against the computer, and give it a taste of its own medicine! You can play either on a grass, clay or hard court, each affectThe score says it all (sort of). ing the ball's trajectory in their own fashion. Apart from that, the usual rules of tennis apply. Some four-player action! FINALT Practise your backhand with the training machine. JAZ SEZ... Computer tennis might not sound like fun, but in this case you'd be a bit mad not to get straight into the action! Its superlative playability gives instant addiction from the word go. The control method is superb; Incredibly easy to get to grips with, but with huge scope to develop some killer shots. It's also very competitive, with one to four-player action (two-player mode is best, though)! The computer opponents are good, and there's a wealth of different game options to add plenty of lasting appeal. Final Match Tennis is a truly stunning game, and ranks alongside Kick Off II and John Madden's Football as an example of one the finest computer sports simulations available on any machine. JULIAN RIGNALL TENNIS TOMFOOLERY The highlight of the tennis season is obviously Wimbledon large crowds, centre courts, scandalous prices for strawberries and cream, the ticket touts and the like.

"IREVIEW SES2 Choose the type of court here, That court sure is big! COURT SURFACE HARD GRASS CLAY MATCH RICH SEZ... YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS, MAN! Final Match Tennis is one of the more realistic tennis games about, with a wide variety of moves, lobs and smashes. Not only do the players race around the court at a great rate of knots, but if the ball's just about out of reach, the player will dive to one side in an attempt to knock the ball back up in the air! I reckon that Final Match Tennis ranks as the best PC Engine games I've seen since the classic Bomber Man. It's one of those games where your skill dictates the action rather than the other way around. Although the controls are remarkably simple, control of the ball is actually a real sod to successfully master. But after a while, the controls become second nature and you'll be diving around the court for all your worth, with a digital manoeuvrability that would amaze Messrs Lendl and Edberg. The ball action is the most realistic I've ever seen in a tennis game too even the ricochets off the net seem stunningly realistic. I agree with Rob in the sense that lastability is perhaps questionable, but the playability of this tennis game is unrivaled on any other system. The game must be good, as members of the editorial and ad teams crowd the games room at lunchtime for a go!

"ARC RECRUIT BEGINNER LEVEL VETERAN RDURACED +5000 POINTS SOLEVA USE TRACKBALL TO SELECT BATTLEFIELD tuttaa 02 After seeing his trillionth new Japanese shoot 'em up down the arcades, Julian Rignall was getting a bit cheesed off... until he started playing Atari's Ramparts, and then nothing else would do! JAZ SEZ Atari's three-player Ramparts is a brilliant new coin-op although you wouldn't think so when you first see it. The game is set in the 17th century and is based around an enemy invasion of your coast by seabound forces. So it's all cannons and Armada-like fleets of attacking boats instead of the usual lasers and spaceships. At the start of a one-player game, you choose a castle to defend, a wall is built around it by the computer and you place your two canons inside. Then the enemy boats sail into the action, firing their cannons at your walls. What you've got to do is destroy the ships using a trackball-controlled crosshair sight to aim your own guns. It's pretty tricky, since the canon shots take a while to reach their target, so you've got to plan ahead. Once the attack is over you have a limited period of time in which to rebuild your castle walls using a variety of Tetris-like shapes which you can rotate and slot together to enclose your castle. If your castle isn't completely walled in at the end of the time period, it's Game Over. Succeed, and you get extra cannons with which to repel the next onslaught. The idea of cannon-based action mightn't sound like the recipe for an actionpacked game, and Ramparts looks and sounds pretty rubbish. However, in practice Ramparts is tense and challenging, requiring razor-sharp reflexes and forward planning to survive. On later levels there are massive fleets of ships to destroy, and if they reach your coast, they spew out little tanks (although what they're doing in the 17th century is a mystery to me) which make wall-building very difficult! It all gets incredibly frantic especially when you're trying to complete a wall and the timer has virtually run out! thoroughly enjoyed playing the game it's really different, and is a breath of fresh air after months and months of dull space shoot 'em ups and boring beat 'em ups. JULIAN RIGNALL 102 "


"ADE THREE-PLAYER DESTRUCTION The two or three-player mode is a very different game to playing solo. Here, each player must destroy the other castle using their cannons. During the rebuilding sequence, the player who fails to rebuild his wall loses! OB OB b ees PARTS USE BUILD, BUILD, BUILD A BIG FAT CASTLE If you're a good player, during the building period you should not only be able to wall in your own castle, but also enclose a couple of the other ones dolled around the land scape.

"HPREVIEW SNOW BROS SNOW BROS OCEAN What's the difference between snowmen and snowVV women? Snowballs! Okay, okay, crap puns aside, that wet white substance that seems to give British Rail so much bother is the subject of this, Ocean's latest in a long line of cutesy coin-op conversions. Taken from the totally brilliant but surprisingly little-known Toaplan coinop, Snow Bros puts you in the shoes of a cutesy snowman, whose task in life is to travel through 50 platform levels, Bubble Bobble style. As you'd expect, myriad nas. ties are out to put the heat on, so to speak, but our subzero hero has the ability to blast'em with his snowgun. 000 eee 14 wy www END-OF-LEVEL ICINESS! ven if you get so far, making it through to the next series of levels is no easy matter a massive guardian blocks your way, and the only way to get past him is to blast him into little pieces! These whacked-out monsters include a slimy blue head that shoots out bolts of energy, and a zany giant lizard with a yellow mohican! the effect of which turns any nasty into a giant snowball, which can be smashed into a wall for points! We've had a look at a pre-production version (programmed by Ocean France, previously responsible for the superlative conversions of Pang), and to be totally frank, we reckon this could be this year's Rainbow Islands it's looking that good, with graphics and sound practically identical to the coin-op! How everything hangs together in the final version will be revealed in the full review in next month's CVG don't miss it! 106 "

There can't be any gameplayer out there who doesn't know what playing Gauntlet involves racing around all manner of mazes, blasting evil monsters whilst collecting keys, potions and food and avoiding all sorts of devious traps. Gauntlet II was more of the same, but with more monsters (including the IT monster and a very large, fire-breathing dragon) and even more devilish traps. Now Gauntlet III is here, and things are more than a little different... Now everything is seen from a forced perspective viewpoint, and involves not four heroes, but eight! Now EK SI6MX3 DOC 2 PRESS 200000 000 CONTINUE CREDITS Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard and Questor the Elf are joined by four brave new adventurers; Petras the Rockman, Neptune the Merman, Dracolis the Lizard and Blizzard the Iceman! Set in the mystical world of Capra, two of the eight heroes must battle through eight kingdoms, blasting and collecting as they go, clearing all eight lands of the demonic forces that dwell within before going on to face the Demon King himself (00-er)! The first two Gauntlet games (especially the topper Gauntlet II) were not only excellent in the graphics and sound departments, but were also immensely playable, especially the 16 bit versions.

"PREVIEW ARMOUR-GEDDON PSYGNOSIS oming soon to an Amiga near you is Armour-Geddon; a futuristic 3D extravaganza which puts you at the controls of six different types of vehicle, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and types of firepower and equipment. Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to collect five sections of an ancient neutron bomb, in order to destroy an orbiting laser satellite. This isn't as straightforward as it sounds, as all manner of ground and air based adversaries are out to put a stop to your bomb-collecting buffoonery with lethal force! It certainly looks rather flash, and the ray-traced intro at the start of the game is even more stunning than the usual Psygnosis three-minute wonders! The only question left to answer is: will the rest of the game match up to the intro, or will it be another case of \"nice graphics, shame about the gameplay\"?

Power-ups and additional weapons are there for the taking, but out to stop you are some of the biggest and deadliest end-of-level guardians ever conceived!

"so EDDIE BD No ugly wart-nose is gonna make a monkey out of me! But that's just what that witch has done one minute I'm the mighty Toki and the next I'm having breakfast delousing my armpits, I can't walk a step without tripping over my knuckles and, oh, there's an overhanging vine time to swing out sister! But my broken heart is going ape. My beloved Miho (I can't wait to share a banana with her) has been kidnapped and somehow I've got to regain my manhood until then I'm just swingin' in the rain!
