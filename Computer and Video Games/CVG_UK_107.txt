Well, it just so happens that the weally witty chat show host is going to be just one of the star guests that'll be appearing at the European Computer Entertainment Show at the Earl's Court Exhibition Centre on the 15th and 16th of September none of this Adam Faith or Tessa Sanderson rubbish here! But that's not all. In what promises to be THE show of the decade, you'll be able to \"rub shoulders\" with the likes of Esther unless you know better Rantzen, KISS FM, BBC Newsround, Frank \"HP\" Bruno and even Radio 1 who are going to be taping a show there!

Teams from Japan, France, Italy and of course, the United Kingdom will be present in what promises to be the greatest challenge since King Kong vs Godzilla! But we're not alone. Our mates from The One will be hosting a live \"Work in Progress' in conjunction with the boys from Bullfrog, where you'll be able to see the humble beginnings of their latest classic Powermonger.

Hurrah! As well as the console, DIS will be bringing out 50 of the latest and greatest Engine titles (including PC Kid, Gunhed and Klax), the CD ROM player, AV booster, super joystick and five player adaptors. All will have English packaging and instructions, and DIS are offering a telephone help-line service for anyone who has problems with their machine. The only fly in the ointment is that all these new goodies won't be compatible with the imported Japanese gear. At time of writing. prices have yet to be fixed, but DIS expect to have the machine on sale in High Street shops from October, priced at between  and , with software selling for  upwards. "


"INDY NEWS All you Amiga-owning race freaks had better get yourselves strapped in, because Electronic Arts are bringing the Indianapolis 500 your way. This corking 3D racer had jaws dropping all over the place when released on the PC, and the Amiga version is now hav. ing its final pit checks before being given the chequered flag. We had a look at an unfinished version, and believe us, it's one red-hot bit o' stuff. Featuring multiple camera viewpoints, three levels of racing, pitstops and the opportunity for plenty of multiple pileups (yeah, this is what we want!) Indianapolis 500 will be burning up the roads in October for the sum of .99 ART FOR ART'S SAKE Quite a lot of ST artists (our Rob in ST version also features an extended cluded) have been grumbling for some palette for STE users, 9 different drawtime about not having a version of Elecing modes, complex animation (999 tronic Arts' excellent Deluxe Paint for animation buffers, each capable of their machine.

PEEDWAY INDY CAM INDY CAM LUCASFILM INDY FOLLOW UP Although arcade action may be more our scene here at C+VG, we love to have our brains teased now and again and Lucasfilm's Indy Adventure fitted the bill quite nicely! That being the case, we were more than interested in some of their new games that US Gold have licensed. The Secret of Monkey Island looks like just the ticket for adventuring types. Featuring a superior mousedriven interface, the general objective involves living out the life of a swashbuckling hero type, searching for the lost secret of Monkey Island and generally picking up a whole stash of treasure on the way. Lucasfilm are also promising \"lethal one-liners\" and \"hilarious repartee\" sounds like a riot, dunnit? Look out also for the follow-up to Their Finest Hour The Battle of Britain because in Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe you can get your hands on all manner of experimental German planes. Both games will be taking PC owners by storm very soon, and other 16 bit versions seem a certainty. "


"BOOOM! MY WHEELS ARE ON FIRE! Those jolly japers at Domark are gettrum tapes for a relatively piddling ting ready to unleash two compilations .99.

Remember Strider, US Gold's conversion of the Capcom coin-op? Well, at this moment, Tiertex (who did the original) are currently working on their own sequel, imaginatively titled Strider II. Thing is, Capcom were so impressed with the storyboards for the computer game, they decided to use them for the arcade machine! Strider Il will be out in November for the Amiga, ST, PC, C64, Spectrum and Amstrad, with the coin-op appearing in an arcade near you sometime closer to Christmas "

"AND NOW... THE C64 CONSOLE After much speculation, Commodore have finally leapt onto the console bandwagon, and have finally announced the imminent release of their first games system. Based on the C64, the C64GS will come with a joystick and a fun-packed, four-game cartridge featuring Klax, Fiendish Freddy's Big Top o'Fun, Flimbo's Quest and the ultra-crumbly International Soccer, all for .99 The selling potential of yet another 8-bit console, especially a comparitive. ly low-tech one, is, we think, uncertain, especially with Megadrives and PC Engines becoming so widely available, but we'll be interested to see how this and Amstrad's GX-4000 (featured last ish) fare. You can see what the console looks like from the picture, but we have it on good authority that the machine shown is actually made of wait for itbalsa wood. Maybe Commodore are branching into new areas? Or could they be barking up the wrong tree? Leaf it out... CABINET CRAZINESS Making a Spectrum look like an arcade machine is no mean feat these days, but Spectresoft's new Pro-Arcade Cabinet just about manages it. Your computer, be it Amiga, Spectrum, or console can be placed on a slide-away shelf within the cabinet and connected up to its arcade-quality joysticks for that ultimate coin-op look and feel. If you don't want to plug in your computer, there's also a JAMMA-compatible version, which allows you to plug in and play JAMMA (a sort of coinop standard) arcade boards! Phew! Prices range from .95 to .95, but for more info, Spectresoft can be reached on 0831 469 293. If that's not good enough for you, Advanced Modular Joysticks can build you a cabinet that will plug into any computer or arcade board (not just JAMMA-compatible ones). The AMJ Arcade Console has a variety of interfaces, incorporates two joystick ports (equivalent to four joysticks and 6 fire buttons!), supports dedicated arcade controllers (trackballs, paddles and even steering wheels) and can also be connected via a SCART lead up to your computer or consoler Flippin 'eck! Just think, you could be playing Megadrive Super Monaco GP with the real controls! Prices vary because each unit is custom-made, according to what kinds of interfaces and controllers you want, but a basic unit with a JAMMA interface, JAMMA power supply and control panel costs .99. Now we've got you screaming and dribbing and reaching for your wallets, AMJ can be reached on 0202 694970 (and tell them we sent you). ADIOS ACTIVISION? CONTRIVER'S GOT A LOT OF BALLS Just as this issue of C+VG closed, we heard some rather nasty news about industry giant, Activision, responsible for the likes of Power Drift, Galaxy Force and Altered Beast. It seems that the American parent company has been making significant losses over the past year, so they decided to cut back the UK operation to save money. Though some new product will be developed in Britain, it will be restricted to games with a \"global appeal\". The good news is that the tide of events will in no way endanger an Activision/Hewson distribution deal which will still see Activision distributing Paradroid '90, Nebulus 2 and Rubicon. Also, some of Activision's major licensed wares (namely Atomic Robokid and Dragon Breed) will still be appearing on the shelves. However, doubt still lingers over two potential blockbusters R-Type 2 and Stephen Hendry's Snooker (programmed by International Karate coder, Archer Maclean). We've had a sneak preview of the latter and have to say that it'd be a damn shame if this awesome 3D simulation never sees the light of day. Trackballs, that is. Y'know, those things which resemble upside-down mice. Well, these Contriver people have announced the imminent release of its snazzy new Contrack controller, initially for the PC, with ST and Amiga models available at any time now, for a total of .95. Now that may sound like a rather hefty wad of wonga, but when you consider that this little beast has a button lock, a ball lock (oof!) for transportation purposes, and is guaranteed for 1000 miles of continuous use, then it certainly seems like ruddy good value for money. If you're interested in laying your hands on one of these, Contriver can be reached at 0280 822803 delag 12 "

"EVIEW IIIIIIIIII BY OCEAN Dubbles! Who'd ever D thought that they could be such a pain, eh? Well, they are in this game, so the only thing to do is go out and burst 'em! And so the scene is set for Pang, a conversion of the recent and totally hilarious Mitchell coin-op. You (and a friend, if you're playing in dual-player mode) are cast in the role of globetrotting bubble-busters, and, armed with a harpoon gun, you must blast the bubbles before they bounce into you. Sounds like a piece of cake, yes? Well, you can forget that for a start, because once one bubble is hit, it splits into two smaller bubbles, each of which splits again, and again! When certain bubbles are hit, however, they drop powerups like ray guns and dynamite, which bursts every bubble on screen at once, as well as shields and timers, which stop the bubbles dead in their tracks, giving you time to blow 'em away. Once you've cleared a screen, it's on to the next in a different part of the world, with more obstacles, monsters and, yes, even more bubbles! FORWARD RE C+VG UPDATE Pang will be bubbling up on the ST any day now, and should be just as good as the Amiga version, save for a few colour and sound differences. No news of any 8 bit versions as yet, but if any. thing comes up, you'll be the first to know. TIME: AMIGA .99 This is one of the C+VG team's favourite coinops, and to say we were over the moon to hear of Ocean laying their hands on the license is something of an understatement. Now Pang is here, I can safely say without fear of error or contradiction that this isn't just a conversion this is the coin-op! Both the graphics and sound match the arcade machine pixel for pixel, with bright, crisp, colourful sprites and exquisitely drawn backdrops. The whizzy, poppy sound effects are spot on too, and the title music (which sounds like a remix of Puff the Magic Dragon) sets the mood perfectly. These combine with the horribly addictive gameplay to make Pang a really brilliant game. Grab it at the first opportunity, and prepare to stay up till the wee small hours.

"Find out its limits. Look in the mirror. NAIAR ATARI SM124 "


"The TOS 1.6 (operating system) has an enhanced file selector with drive-change buttons, improved desktop with file move, MS-DOS compatible disk formatting, and better application installation and auto-booting facilities. As you'd expect, there's a huge range of peripherals including hard disks, floppy disks, laser printers, colour monitors and even Megafile 44, Atari's unique 44-megabyte removable hard disk. As well as all this hardware, there are hundreds of software programmes for the 1040 STE we're even throwing in the ST-Series Productivity and Leisure bundles free. The Productivity bundle features a database, spreadsheet, word processor and business graphics package, and there's S.T.A.C., FirST BASIC, Hyperpaint and Prince in the Leisure bundle. ST SERIES Introducing the powerful new Atari 1040 STE. With such an awesome machine, we're convinced the only limits you'll come across are your own. Based on the incredibly successful 1040 STEM, the 1040 STE itself goes beyond the limits of its predecessor. The 'E', by the way, stands for 'Enhanced'. But once you've discovered its amazing array of features, you may consider 'Enhanced' to be the understatement of the decade. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the 1040 STE is its graphics. Its palette contains over 4000 colours (all right, 4096 to be exact). To ensure precise and realistic images, the STE features 'hardware scrolling', enabling smooth scrolling in any direction and split-screen effects. And, with the SM124 monitor, you'll get razor sharp black-out-of-white text that's as clear as the type on this page. To complete the picture, it is able to 'phase-lock' its video output to an external video source, permitting direct linking to a Genlocking device. The 1040 won't just have your eyes swivelling in their sockets. Your eardrums will also take a pounding from the 8-bit PCM stereo sound. The new PCM (Pulse Coded Modulation) sound system's two chips allow the 1040 STE to replay high-quality sampled sounds, in stereo, without burdening the CPU. Or, for even more of an earblasting, just add a couple of RCA output jacks and power the sounds through your own stereo. Of course we mustn't forget memory. One megabyte of RAM comes as standard. If that's not enough, the 1040 STE provides four SIMM sockets. Simply plug in some SIMM (Single Inline Memory Module) boards and boost the RAM up to four megabytes. To help you handle all this technology, we've added even more: a Blitter chip, capable of shifting data at high speeds independent of the CPU, and a new version of TOS. If you're itching to get your hands on the controls, there are two 15-pin analogue controller ports (which accept paddles, lightguns and light-pens) and a 9 pin mouse port and joystick port. With adaptors, up to six people can use the 1040 at one time. Just in case it's too much for one person to handle. At .99 it certainly won't be too much for one person to afford. The ideal computer at the ideal price, you may think. We think so, too. But there remains only one potential problem: not whether you'll make impossible demands of the 1040, but whether the 1040 will make impossible demands of you. Please send me further details of the 1040 STE and other Atari products. NAME: ADDRESS: -------POSTCODE Please send to Atari Corp (UK) Ltd. Atari House, Railway Terrace, Slough, Berkshire. SL2 5BZ.

Orcs wielding clubs, knives and longbows stand in his way, accompanied by flies, wasps, and poisonous plants.

Apart from chopping things up, collecting the treasure that's lying about is also a good way to boost your score. Of more practical use are the swords, maces, warI must admit to being highly sceptical of a game, I mean, it's been done so many times before (Rastan, Rastan II, Legendary Axe, Barbarian II etc.), I was wondering if anything new could be done on the subject. Unfortunately not, it seems. Torvak is an outand-out Rastan-style game, with big meathead travelling around myriad levels hacking monsters. No points for originality, then, so how does the game measure up otherwise? Well, the sprites and backdrops are beautifully detailed, and there are lots of lovely monsters and end of level demons that explode in a spray of blood when killed (very tasteful). The sound is switchable between grunts, groans and swishes, or very nice tunes, but these do get a little repetitive after a while. That's something that could also be said of the gameplay, because although slashing and bashing nasties is fun, it does begin to drag after a while. If you're after Rastan for the Amiga, you could do a lot worse than this, but twenty five notes is a lorra dosh for a game of this ilk, even if you do get a set of lead figures in the box.

Don't get me wrong, in most respects Corporation is absolutely astounding, particularly graphically, because it has lots of lovely monsters, droids and humans to be blown away, and the 3D movement is nice and smooth. Where the game falls down is with the pernickety control method. Movement is achieved by clicking on a square \"compass\", and you have to click right on the centre to stop. Trying to move quickly in the heat of battle is really difficult, and Corporation would have benefited more from a Dungeon Master-type directional arrow system. The use of sound is appropriately sparse, apart from a brilliant movie-like intro. Overall, a good game, and one for the insomniacs amongst you, but with a better control method, Corporation could have been something even more special.

Once the king's chancellor, Dianos used his insidious powers to turn man against man, brother against brother, until all were slain, even the King. dead by his own captain's sword Then one fateful day, a stranger appeared. Short of stature but stout of heart, a bounty hunter by trade, the newcomer was hired to venture forth to the castle, and to seek and slay Dianos for his crimes. One man, a captain of the royal guard, spoke in hushed tones, of demons and monsters foul which had taken in with the necromancer, and would do their utmost to aid their master. Sure of a goodly reward, "


"EVIEW ZIMIZ C+VG IIIIIIIIIII ST .99 POTLON the hunter made his plans, and that night, set out in a small boat towards the castle, to search out this demon Dianos, and destroy him once and for all. You, controlling this reckless warrior, must journey through a 3D forced-perspective environment, collecting items and artifacts that may be used in your quest. Running and jumping are the basis of your movement, but a mystical icon panel is at hand to tell you of your whereabouts, and what is available to you. Be warned, however, for traps are a-plenty, and your energy is limited. Wise actions will be rewarded with progress, but act foolishly. and all will be lost. The Bitmaps are back, and how! This 3D isometric adventure (vaguely reminiscent of Ultimate's Knight Lore) is a real departure from their previous blasts, but believe me, this is probably their best product to date! Control of the dwarf is simple enough, and when it comes to picking up and utilising the myriad objects scattered around the castle, the icon system works surprisingly well, and is quick and easy to use. The graphics are nothing short of brilliant, and the sheer attention to detail (especially with some of the brickwork and monsters) is stunning. Some of the puzzles are quite easy, but others demand a brain-bending amount of lateral thought, though nothing so complex as to drive you away. Containing five levels, each with a massive 70 rooms, the game has a heck of a lot there to keep you going, so it's a game to be played over a considerable amount of time. If you're yearning for the bygone days of Ultimate-style action, look no further. Cadaver is well-deserving of a place in everybody's software collection. ROBERT SWAN GRAPHICS 96% SOUND 90% VALUE 93% PLAYABILITY 94% OVERALL 95% UPDATE Cadaver will be appearing on the Amiga during September, for .99, and, apart from slight colour and sound differences, it should be identical to the ST version.

For example, the super ball may look like a toy but throw it against a wall and it bounces back and forth knocking seven bells out of anything that tries to walk past it! The object handling is fine, and the ability to change the robots'abilities by buying new body parts is a great idea, especially as there is such a wide variety of bits (including some really meaty weapons) available. The monsters are brilliantly conceived and brilliantly drawn too, ranging from innocuous Postman Patlookalikes to enormous ED-209 clones which pack a frightening amount of firepower. As if that wasn't enough to keep you awake all night, the game generates 5900 missions so you definitely won't finish it in a weekend!

The visuals may capture a smidgen of the comic's menacing atmosphere, but the jerky animation completely destroys the effect. The sampled sound effects are short and unconvincing (sometimes just a garbled noise issues forth from the Amiga) and the music sounds more like a C64!

"EVIEW MITIMIZ MAD PROFESSOR MARIARTI BY KRYSALIS VIIIIIII .95 Close down the labs or the straitjacket awaits! GO TO THE DOOR OF YOUR CHOICE. JUMP AT THE MIDDLE ENTER Use your faithful Zapstick. Profl Drofessor Mariarti's got a problem. Everyone thinks he's a screaming loon, and should be locked up. Even the Lord Mayor agrees, and has sent the Prof a letter, stating that if all of his insane machines are not turned off within one week, he'll be put in a straitjacket and carted off to the nearest nuthouse. What this entails is getting the Prof around five massive laboratories, (labeled chemical research, space rocket development, computer science, biological observations and -ooh-weeee-oohThe Mystery Lab) collecting sundry items and using them in the correct locations to shut down all the rogue equipment. The more lively items of lab equipment attempt to stop you in your tracks, but they can be stunned or destroyed with just a few shots from the Prof's zapstick. Collect tokens along the way and you can buy more powerful weapons from the tool lockers scattered about the labs. If the Prof's successful in shutting down all of his equipment, he'll be free to live a life of peace in a country cottage with roses around the door. If not, well, it's 20 years in a padded cell with a striped view and lots of tranquilizing injections in the rump. As far as platform games go, this ranks as one of the prettiest around, and definitely ranks as one of the most frustrating! The graphics are really bright and colourful, with some excellent animation, and the sound is an amusing mixture of squeaks, boings and pings. As far as the gameplay goes, however, Mad Professor Mariarti is reminiscent of Terramex, Thunderbirds, and about almost every other platform game that Teque (the programming arm of Krysalis) have done in the past although it has to be said that this is the best of their bunch. The sheer scale of the game is enormous and the basic mechanics work well, but the connections between the items and the puzzles are pretty obscure, so be prepared to spend a lot of time trekking about, experimenting with different objects in different locations. If you like this kind of game you'll undoubtedly enjoy Marlarti to the max, but those of you more used to blasting than brainwork might well find you've ripped most of the hair off the cat before it's complete!

"ENTER FIRST INTO BATTLE. LAST TO LEAVE ATARI ST CBM AMIGA IBM PC & COMPATIBLES | Set in the near future, as an alternative reality, BATTLE COMMAND is an arcade/strategy game in which the player controls a single \"MAULER\" Assault Tank in one of 16 scenarios (missions) in the ultra war, fought between two dominant races in the NEW WORLD. The latest phase of the North/South war has been going on for over 10 years with a stalemate eventually developing a standoff between armies massed over a long dug-in battlefront. Such are the defensive capabilities of each side, full scale attacks are suicidal, so any offensive moves are by necessity, small \"behind the lines\" actions performed by elite troops in specially designed vehicles. The Mauler is the latest such machine capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by fast stealth choppers and armed with the most advanced weaponry the Northern scientists can devise, ocean Ocean Software Limited 6 Central Street Manchester M25NS Telephone: 061 832 6633 Telex: 669977 OCEANS G Fax: 061 834 0650 "

"ARC HAMMERING HARRY I rem's first cute game since Legend of Hero Tonma casts you as Hammering Harry, a malletwielding hero who must traverse six horizontally scrolling backgrounds bonking everything that gets in his way (00-er). There are plenty of enemies to bash, and each level has a huge guardian to destroy pretty usual for this type of game, but it's so nicely executed, you can't help but thoroughly enjoy the action. The graphics are truly excellent (although the version we played had a slightly wonky monitor, hence the weird background colours on the screenshots), and there are plenty of strange sprites and some superb touches. The music is also great really wacky tunes and effects which really adding to the already humorous atmosphere. Hammering Harry is a very entertaining coin-op that's both addictive and fun.

The sound fits the bill adequately with plenty of tunes but there isn't that much in the way of sound effects. As for the gameplay... Well, where's it gone? Events like pole Vaulting and gymnastics seem more down to luck than anything else. What skill is required in events such as the diving won't keep you at the Sega for long.
