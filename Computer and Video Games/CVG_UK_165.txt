Well here's your chance to find out if they've gone on to better things or are languishing in the games gutter. Just pop your query off to us marked WHERE ARE THEY NOW? at the usual address. This month: ALEX KIDD Aah. the 16-bit games boom. Like Hollywood's heyday this was an era which used up and spat out stars like so many incontinence pants in an old folks home. But no story is sadder than that of ex-Sega mascot Alex Kidd, the man used to launch both the Master System and Mega Drive with his peculiar brand of jug-eared juvenile charm. As happens with many child stars, the onset of puberty was the end of Alex's career and he was swiftly replaced with the sleeker Sonic the Hedgehog. Alex himself takes up the story. \"Having great big jug ears and a bowlhead haircut as well as acne and a quavery breaking voice I just didn't fit in with the sleeker 16-bit, crowd like Bubsy and Cool Spot. Once the money ran out I didn't know what to do games were my life. So in the end I turned to crime smuggling illegal Game Boys into Segaland inside my mammoth lobes. One day Sonic the Hedghog found out. Not con tent with ruining my career, he immediately grassed me up. I was banned from appear ing in cartridge games for life.\" Let this be a lesson to you readers don't be a pretend games character. "

Avoid confrontation by eating as many pies and cakes as possible during work hours before nobbing off to the footie early. Which is your usual trick. Lucky sauce: brown. Nin on time Eco the console Nintendo's pledge not to launch Ultra 64 until they have enough quality games to support the machine, a move commended by consumer watchdogs. Indeed, so pleased are Nintendo with this favourable reaction that they've postponed the UK street date until September 27, 2061 a move applauded by pundits. gary A month of excellent weather, of the laughs and whoops of playful children, of the beautiful bounty of nature, lies ahead. So your best bet is to stay in bed. Otherwise you may find yourself in an uncharacteristically cheerful mood which could stall your pointless and inhumane experiments on live animals Lucky slang: word up, homie The environment-conscious 3DO company have taken a step towards ecofriendliness. «Traditional plastic consoles use billions of gallons of oil and other non-renewable pollutant materials to produce,\" said a 3DO spokesperson. \"Instead, we're going to house the M2 chip set in a giant Brazillian rainforest mahogany tree to cut down on ozone and that.\" Atari have since claimed Jaguar 2 will be mounted on highquality balsa wood. rad Participation in a charity slow bicycle race will cause you to be late for work this month. Well, that'll be your excuse anyway.

Still, it could be worse. Lucky sharp thing: pin. Life eh, readers? Can't live with it, can't live without it. Well, that's strictly true. You can't live without it, fair enough, but you basically have to live with it, like it or not. Bearing this in mind, we thought we'd extend a helping hand to those of you with worries, so we recruited our old pal Nice Guy Mike to run his very own problems column on this very page. If you've got something bothering you, pop it in a letter (as long as it isn't catching) and post it to NICE MIKE at our usual address.

Also remind yourself to slap innocent children. Before cooking them Lucky currency: groat You What? Mortal Kombat 3 has recently been voted the goriest thing in the world.

"NEWS CVG SUPERFLY BIG SKY TROOPER | BIGSKY mission: DEADLY SKIES Now here's a novelty JVC are apply ing now-familiar beat-'em-up ideas to an entirely different genre altogether. Deadly Skies is the name of their new flight simulator which pits the player one-on-one against a single other fighter. Each of the characters (and their plane) has their own special moves, such as cloaking devices and horizontal spins and the like, plus backgrounds, cityscapes and jungles. Available in America this autumn, versions of Deadly Skies are planned for Saturn, 3D0 and PC CD-ROM. Rest assured that we're keeping a close eye on this one. The SNES has a good selection of isometric RPG things, and JVC are scheduled to bump up the total by one. Big Sky Trooper is the name of the game, and it stars you as a cute-looking little robot on a quest to save the universe from the evil Slug Lord. That's about all we know about it as yet, but the graphics (as you can see look quite pleasant, and we'll be sure to tell you more about it closer to the autumn) release date JVC's new flight simulator is a flight sim with vive la difference the various craft and pilots all have special moves, adopting an almost Street Fighter approach!

A polygonmungous pugilism pageant, Center Ring promises to provide Virtua esque camera angles, loads of replays and, obviously, a huge element of hard core violence. Looks brutal and we'll have a review for you in a few months. Anyone who rang the Williams number we ran in last month's issue will probably have been greeted by an irate programmer that's because we accidentally printed the direct line to William's development department. We'd like to apologise profusely to everyone especially Williams who had to change their direct line number. Oops. The person responsible for the mistake has now been beheaded.

GAME AHOY CROW 2 THEME PARK CROW 2 ON SATURN The Crow that was an ace film, wasn't it? And wouldn't it just have made the best video game in the history of the world? Well, sadly it didn't, but fret not for Acclaim, those perennial masters of the licence, have just snapped up the rights to the sequel The Crow: City of Angels. The game is being developed alongside the movie, sharing staff in fact, thanks to an agreement with prolific producer Edward R Pressman. Whilst it's unclear as vet what form the game will take. Next Gen formats are likely to include plenty of digitised footage of Vincent Perez, the man filling the formidable boots of the sadly departed Brandon Lee. Frankly, we can't contain our excitement over this one, and if it's handled right this could be one of the hottest titles you'll ever see. And, on a Pressman tip, Acclaim have also started work on an interactive version of The Mutant Chronicles. Pressman's forthcoming \"futuristic action thriller\". Nice one. Much as the idea of a real theme park on Saturn is an appealing idea, as you might have guessed, this is the console and not the huge ringed planet which resides just the other side of Jupiter. From October, Saturn owners will be able to control their very own theme park making all those command decisions like cleaning up vomit from pathways and mopping up the wee in the blocked toilets, courtesy of Electronic Arts. As light relief and all round graphic jollity, the Saturn version will contain the animated ride sequences that featured in the PC CD-ROM version and allowed players to view their creations in full life-like rainy-day-in-Blackpool splendour.

"NEWS NEWS CVG FLUFFED NICE ONE, ENCOUNTER SORTED Since Gametek's release of David Braben's supposed space epic. Frontier: First Encounters, the company has been flooded with complaints from disgruntled astronauts. After patch disks were sent out because of a sound card problem, further bugs were reported via irate buyers on the internet. A great many PC users have complained of constant crashing and gameplay flaws since purchasing, the product and subsequently First Encounters was with drawn by Virgin Megastore's in many of its branches for a few days, while Gametek put the problems right. In Gametek's defence another patch disk has been issued which they assure us rectifies any further prob lems. Anyone with any problems pertaining to Frontier: First Encounters should contact Gametek on 01753 553445. Calling all druggy sons-of-Satan rave types you may be interested to hear that the video visuals that will be used on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury have been produced with no other piece of kit than the critically beleaguered Mega-CD. And even better the program used to create these visuals will soon be available for your home machine (providing it's a MegaCD, obviously), under the name of Flux. Linked to the audio output of the machine Flux creates visual images which react to the music currently playing. You can play about with the images all you like, and even splice video footage in, controlling the animation with your trusty joypad. We won't be able to review this properly, because it's not a game as such, but we'll be sure to tell you if it's any cop or not when we get a copy in.

Sadly it was delayed quite severely, and is nearly ready for review. They've also got Wing Nuts, a World War 1 dog. fighting simulator, under their showbizstyle hats.

It's the bit when the traffic pulls up at a red light then, in your rear-view mirror some stupid pleb in his tatty old Orion 1.6L (red) drifts right into your bumper at 30mph. This event is usually preceded by the recipient turning round and uttering 'Doreen, that bastard's going right up my backside'. But that's what makes driving fun. It's the little unpredictable danger element and that special attraction that crappy old Fords have for shiny new motors that make it all worthwhile. It's what Ridge Racer lacks, but it's what Destruction Derby's all about. Destruction Derby is pure action. The aim's to take first place and takeout the other drivers by cutting them up, ramming them, forcing pile-ups and being the worst kind of nightmare driver imaginable.

"PREVIEW CVG CRUMPLE ZONES 220.12. 03/12 Laboss PSYCHO, Like Daytona, your car pics up plenty of damage during the course of a race, but it's really taken to the extreme here. Your car has eight hit locations dotted around its exterior which steadily crumple up as you take hits. Naturally, having large chunks knocked out of your motor affects its performance, so stoving in the bonnet will slow you down, while hits to the side play havoc with your steering. The best thing about all this smashing and crashing, though, is the graphical effects on the car. Rather then just jump to a frame which shows bits of your car mashed in, it goes through several stages, depending on how hard your car was hit. Above all, it looks flipping fantastic, even if a knackered-up car is harder to drive and there's smoke pouring out of the bonnet. 20/12 309 Rare Points face Pants WL20 no. 2.024/12 DELLOC 20/20 252 Race Paints 16 400. tone. 02/12 REF Voto 08/20 311 18 "

Back on terra firma, all the tracks feature plenty of tunnels and forks in the road. When the track splits there's usually one route which is shorter and slightly easier to negotiate, while the other is loaded with bonuses such as turbos, shields and missiles. 2 3 OYS0.6 23 2 3 OS:00.0 Oh. bs:00.0 00:18.

No, the sun hasn't gone to our heads, it's simply in the fluid way the game plays. As well as the normal steering, the top buttons on the joypad activate your skimmer's left and right airbrakes, which let it slide around tricky corners. That, coupled with the speed of the game and being able to do the other vehicles over with missiles combines to produce a gaming experience which isn't far off the Nintendo classic, But it's in no way a step backwards. One look at the graphics will tell you that this is a true next generation product and something which would have been impossible to produce as recently as 12 months ago.

"PREVIEW CVG PREVIEW SEGA SATURN SHIN SLEGAN SHINOBI DEN ASS NOBI PRANCING NINJAS One of the many highlights of this game is the superb cliched ninja film bits. Just imagine any of the American Ninja movies crossed with Power Rangers and you've probably got a good idea what this sequences look like. You'll spend more time laughing at them than you will playing the game. Maybe. A Sega system without Shinobi is like a tortoise without a shell flat, squishy and prone to sunburn. Then again, maybe it isn't. PLAYER BOSS SHIN SHINOBI DEN he need for a Shinobi game in Europe is stirring up a bit of a debate at Sega at the moment. Traditionally, before people got into the habit of playing ring-grabbing hedgehogs, there used to be the far more sober routine or slicing ninjas in half with a big sword and it all went down rather well. But things date, technology moves on and a once heroic ninja becomes the digitial equivalent of steam trains, propeller engines and Texan chewy bars. So there's some relectance in certain quarters of Sega to bring one of their most popular characters back, especially in a game which isn't 3D, doesn't blind you with special effects and has some very 2D platform action. At least that's the view of some people. After playing this game we've reached a different conclusion. Shin Shinobi Den is fun. It's also cliched to the extreme with the worst B-grade movie footage of ninjas ninjering each other interspersed with the action. It's fantastic. As for the game itsell, apart from a few nice graphical effects, it doesn't really carry the next-gen air that people expect from 32-bit systems.

Remix is essentially the same as the original Virtua Fighter, AM2 have left the excellent gameplay of the first game untouched. What they have done is substantially upgrade the graphics to the point where the characters can almost be mistaken for their VF2 counterparts.

"FEATURE CMMU SOON Bug NHL AllStar Hockey Sega International Soccer We were pretty sceptical about this game, which was partly to do with having played Clockwork Knight. But now we've had the chance to give it a proper play test we can tell you that this is actually very, very good indeed. The general 3D-ness has been put to excellent use and accounts for some superb gameplay innovations rather than just being there as a gimmick. One of the many things the Saturn is truly brilliant at is putting loads of superb 3D excellence into standard sprite graphics. This is the best example of this so far, even if it is a dodgy American sport. Still, EA have had plenty of success with their hockey titles, and this could do the same thing for Sega on the Saturn. SEW Previously hiding under the monicker Victory Goal, the European version of this game will retain the same graphics and gameplay although the J-league teams will be replaced by international squads.

INTERSHOW Victory Goal RESS SIARI BURTON LIST ALASTERS Sega Japan are still putting the finishing touches to this incredible game. Although they claim that there aren't as many polygons in the Saturn version as there are in the coin-op, we couldn't tell the difference. Sega also reckon they'll be releasing a light gun to go with it, but judging by past performance (ie the Menacer and that scuddy phaser-thing for the Master System) you'll be lucky if you get any more games to use it with Press Start Button As pinball games go, this is actually a pretty decent one.

"REVIEW CVG REVIEW NBA Shaking the room, and Sega's, should we say, intermediate machine, is the 32-bit version, of Acclaim's tournament edition, of their quite formidable basketball game. NBAS hatever American cop series you watch, nay whatever American programme, period, you can always bet that the two male leads will at some point in the series go and shoot some hoops. The thing is, though, you never saw Regan and Carter having a quick go of rebound did you? Or Sgt Cryer just nipping round the back of the station with a footie for a quick game of three-and-in either come to think of it. Well, all those Yankie TV stars don't have to go outside for a bit of two-on-two, now they can switch on their SNES, Mega Drive, or if they wanted to be really cool their MD 32Xes. Yes, the 32X is the latest machine for the bonkers, frenetic running from one side of the court to another, trying-to-set-yourself-alight game that goes by the name of NBA Jam Tournament Edition. Now regular viewers will be aware of the differences between this and the common-or-garden NBA Jam (ie practice option, substituting players, hot spots), but the diffs' between this and the Mega Drive version are not vast or Limmediately obvious. Apart from one thing. Yes heads. The heads are huge, as these screenshots prove, and once you get used to the fact that all the players look like out-of-proportion mutants the game is as enjoyable as it's ever been. MEGA DRIVE 32X. SPORTS. RELIGHT MY PLAYER Every now and again handy gameplay hints flash up, and if you score three baskets on the trot you become on fire and quite unstoppable. ACCLAIM .99. OUT NOW... ONE/TWO PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SNES/MEGA DRIVE VERSIONS AVAILABLE It's a lot less bother if you can hover. "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG COACHING TIPS SCORES CLER G ERT BUY OF THE PESSING THE TUO STEAL DOTTO VERDICT MEGA DRIVE 32X As we've printed before in this mighty tome (well magazine actually) we do rather like NBA Tournament Edition, not so much so that we bought the company but enough to give the 32X version a fair crack of the whip. And is it bigger, better et cetera? Well the heads are bigger certainly, the court seems bigger, and with the full scaling graphics it does make the game look slightly different. On the whole though, you've got more or less the same game, right down to your boomshaka-whatever, so that old adage, rings true here, and that is if you've the 16-bit version stick with that, but the 32x version is a decent enough game too, but nowt special. GARY LORD ADDERSon TURBO S6. WHC ONE WUTS NBA JAM TE NBA JAM GRAPHICS 90 SECOND OPINION. MEGA DRIVE 32X The 32X version of NBA should really be called the MBH edition, that's Mutated Big Heads cos if you look at the shots on this page them blokes have got absolutely huge noggins. Perhaps there's a chip in the 32x which swells the heads of sprites on purpose 'cos aside from this rather strange addition, the full scaling effect and some sampled American commentary, there's little else different from other versions. If you've got a 32X and no other version of NBA Jam then it's worth rubbing your notes together and buying it, but if you've already played it to death on your Mega Drive then it's not really gonna juice you up to the desired level. SIMON CLAYS As competent as the 16 bit versions but with bigger heads. ORLANDO CLEVELANDSTURTER ANIMATION 73 The full scale effects add to that feeling of realism. Well, -ish. It's the 4th Quarter, and you're playing catch up, MUSIC. Nothing really to speak of, it's mostly commentary etc. SOUND EFFECTS.. 87 THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT THE FULL SCALING EFFECT Now what makes the 32X so much more grown up than its little Mega Drive bruv is that it's capable of fancy little effects such as this full scaling effect. What d'ya mean? Well take a lookie at these two shots and you'll see that when the player moves into the foreground he gets bigger, and when he runs into the background he gets smaller. That's technology for you. Boomshaka-bleedinlaka, if you please. Some top noises. GAMEPLAY 76 Really has to be played in two-player mode for full effect. PRICE VALUE Only worth buying if you haven't got the original 16 bitter. 93:9 OVERALL \"NBA JAM TE on the 32-bit Mega Drive is not significantly different to the 16-bit version, but it retains all the fun and gameplay of the latter.\" Dunk some baskets and then go down the pub for a few Lucozade Sports. 43 "


"CVG REVIEW REVIEW greatest nine  BASEBALL SATURN. SPORTS. Oh no, it's another confusing American sport we don't know the rules for. SEGA ,00 ALL SQUARE AT THE NINTH There's an awful lot of interesting stuff in Greatest Nine. Too much, in fact, for a feeble one-page Earth review to contain, so we'll just breeze through the best bits. Firstly, there are tons of options, which allow you to play oneor two-player games, and there's also an eight-player tournament option for whiling away long hours trapped in subterranean ice caverns. There are different stadiums (four) and you can choose between day and night-time games. The best thing, though, has to be the commentary. You're given a choice of six commentators, whose frenzied Japanese is a constant source of amusement as you try to work out what the hell 'Thunder yen' means when the commentator starts screaming. S6. WHC ONU WUTS OUT NOW NBA JAM TE VICTORY GOAL ONE/TWO PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. GRAPHICS Large player sprites and nice backgrounds. The players move well in close-up, but are dodgy at range. ever trust a country that has rounders as its national sport. Especially if it's some sissy version of rounders where everyone has to wear big padded gloves and helmets in case they get hurt. What kind of a culture does that suggest to you, eh? A culture of whimpering nancies with a bad maternal dependancy complex, terrible chart music, a strange obssession with teeth and a passion for psychotherapy, that's what. Mind you, this baseball lark is actually quite a laugh. If you imagine the helmets are, in fact, just funny bowl-head haircuts and the large mitts are radioactively mutated hands or bunches of lunchtime bananas you could actually find yourself starting to enjoy it. Well, perhaps not in real life, where you're supposed to wave prannocky little pennants around and eat suspect hot-dogs, but at least this Saturn conversion of the game might bring some joy. If only we knew what a seventh-innings stretch is. MUSIC Hardly any, and what there is Isn't great. UMO SOUND EFFECTS..95 3 32-1*R AV.000 SBO Well managed baseball effects and brilllant speech GAMEPLAY. Just some of the wonderful sampled speech treats in store for you... Easy to get into and addictive, but fairly simple In essence. 80 Changed VALUE.. The simplicity means single-player appeal Is limited. Time for a new kit. Argh! Little people! Guess what's happened? No, it's a wereworlf. Get the pitchforks. VERDICT OVERALL A brilliant twoplayer game and the most appealing conversion of the sport so far, but not quite an essential purchase. Stats you can Ignore! SATURN Most baseball titles are famous for their love of stats, most of which your average Blightian can't comprehend, but not this one. This one is a fullon arcade-a-go-go screaming-mad-commentary baseball conversion from Hell, and I think it's pretty great. The atmosphere really makes it, with the replays, the crowd noises and the offtheir-nuts commentators. Greatest Nine, with its hordes of options and easy-to-pick-up playness is smart to the extreme as a two-player game. RAD LOOK Aforics FO You can hit them with the ball, you know. Where's the ball, eh? "

"IMPORT REVIEW VERDICT SATURN . 1000 tahun (SCORES Technically. Gran Chaser is probably better than Daytona. The graphics are sharper, the clipping isn't as intrusive and the imagination which has gone into the course design is admirable. Gameplay.wise, though, it's a different story. The pace and tortuous track layouts are initially exciting, but there's not much else going on. This means after you've been through the game a couple of times you start to get bored, and the unrealistic handling of your floating thing means it isn't a game you'll want to perfect your technique on. Not even the split-screen two-player mode keeps your interest held. Not a bad effort, but Gran Chaser doesn't have sufficient lasting appeal to justify the cash. And it's got a daft title. RAD SHIELD SEORE ET POUR $780 ULL SPEED 29 wa USO BNNOINHO RIDGE RACER GRAN RACER GRAPHICS ...900 Varied and welldrawn courses, but bland cars. ANIMATION 73 There's not a lot of it, but there aren't any clipping problems. (MUSIC Alright, but not in the same league as Ridge Racer. SOUND EFFECTS. 80 HAVE IT IN AVOCADO Cars are personal things. Some people like knackered up old vans, and some people like Volvos. There's no accounting for taste. Except in Gran Chaser, where there's all sorts of accounting for taste. The player is free to modify the engine, steering and brakes of their skimmer as they see fit. Being on a Top Gear tip, we decided to roadtest three makes of floaty thing.

OVERALL \"Some innovative touches, but doesn't have the playability and graphical appeal of Daytona. Close but no cigar I'm afraid.\" ROVER ENGINE: NEUTRAL STEERING: NEUTRAL BRAKES: NEUTRAL Average in every respect, this is a personality-free floating racing thing. It handles a bit like a 22 sledge, fairly slidey but predictable in its behaviour. Plus its per formance isn't really affected too much by the type of track you're currently racing upon. LAND ROVER ENGINE: POWER STEERING: LIGHT BRAKES: STRONG Good for the more undulating courses, this doesn't lose speed on steep hills and pretty much ignores bumps and hillocks. Good for barging other skimmers out of the way, but not very exciting. Plus it's not particularly great shakes in the speed department. XR31 TURBO NUTTER FURRY-DICE-JOB ENGINE: SPEED STEERING: HEAVY BRAKES: LIGHT A quirky floater which bounces all over the place at the slightest touch and has a tendency to oversteer, but is faster than you'd ever believe.

He might be a hula-dancer befriending, indigenouspeoples irritating, moremoney-than-he-can-spend movie star, but you know that at the end of the day, when it comes to choice of pants, he's got, his finger firmly in the light-blue 99p-forthree down the market easy-access pie. Now I think it's pretty impressive that a man who wears baggy nylon briefs can muster $180 million to finance a mim which pundits are describing as 'Mad Max in the water' (well that's what Petrea reckons, anyway), and I also think it's inspiring that he can overcome such an undergarment taste handicap. But, and I must say that this is a rather substantial but, I can't help thinking that he could have put that sort of money to slightly better use. Like feeding the poor, or giving it all to me to squander on eating and drinking. But hey, you can't have everything, and at least I don't feel compelled to wear the kind of shreddies your dad would balk at. But I might just try on a pair to get into the spirit of things for this conversion of the as-yet-unreleased filmaciousness. The plot has you playing a heroic sailor-type in a post-apocalyptic world entirely covered in water (hence the name, strangely). Far from being a surfer's paradise of endless waves, or scuba central, this new Earth is a haven for eyepatch-adorned pirates by the score. Your job, as main hero saviour sort is to smash the cartels of robbers and cut-throats using your swashbuckling Errol Flynn-with-a-cobb-on skills. And just how does one officiate this?

A large part of the game is spent captaining your sailboat around the dangerinfested waters, searching for various little communities of peace-loving citizens. The action is viewed from a vaguely isometric perspective, giving you a decent view of a large amount of sea at once.

"CVG REVIEW REVIEW I once ran into a nutter at a bus stop who claimed to see the Batsignal when he was drunk. Please don't let this happen to your kids. Please. IS IT A BIRD? NO, IT'S A MAMMAL \"You'll believe a man can fly\" that's how they advertised the first Superman movie all those years ago, and they were completely right. Well I believed it, I was only about six at the time. And, thanks to Batman & Robin, you'll now believe a bat can fly. Well yes alright, we know they do already, but you get the message. What we mean is Batman flies around a bit in this game. First in his patent Batglider in a succession of top-down shoot-'em-up sections and later using a jetpack for some side-on view shooting fun. Sadly this bat isn't fitted with radar, so you never know what's coming next. MEGA DRIVE an you imagine what it must have been like to go to school with Bruce Wayne? Every time there was a scrap in the playground he'd leap in, coat draped over his head by the hood, and break it up (thus spoiling the only entertainment you're likely to get at playtime). Copy someone's homework and that's it handwriting samples run through the Fisher Price Batletcomputer, a comprehensive cross-check of homework results through the last five years to turn up any matching crimes, and you end the day tied to a handy lamp-post outside the headmaster's office. Perhaps they had to send him to a special school for budding vigilantes, where all the use less subjects like metalwork and geography are dropped in favour of ninja martial arts classes and swinging from rooftops. Although, on second thoughts, you'd need metalwork and textiles to build your utility belt gadgets and sew your spandex costume. And I wonder if they had any class es in dramatic dialogue \"No Dobson, say it like this: \"The only game you'll be playing from now on is Hunt the Soap in the prison showers, creep', how many times must I tell you?\" or escaping from death-traps? No, that's just silly It must be a post-grad degree PLATFORM SEGA .99 OUT NOW TWO PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE JOKER'S HARD TIMES Olf there's one piece of bat-gadgetry Batman is famous for, it's the Batmobile. Sadly, that doesn't feature at all in this game, but the second most famous bit of kit the Batarang is in full effect. In fact, it's the combat staple of the title. There are four different versions of the Batarang, determined by the last power-up you picked up, and up to three may be fired at once (depending on how many shot icons you've grabbed). Plus, if Batman can refrain from firing for a couple of seconds, he'll unleash a Mega-Batarang which slices through rows of regular enemies and inflicts massive damage on hardier foes. Just keep an eye on the Batarang power meter in the topleft of the screen to see when your weapon is fully charged. Holy suspended sucrose shootery! Holy horror in a hat! Batman! 52 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG DICK VERDICT. MEGA DRIVE At first, I thought Batman & Robin was a pretty smart title. The graphics are nice, it's incredibly challenging and it feels not unlike a Treasure title. But after I'd played through a few levels of Batman I soon realised a little problem. Despite the variety you'd think shoot-'em-up sections and so on might offer, the game hardly changes throughout. It's the same routine over and over again, and after a while it starts to get a bit boring. That doesn't mean that this is terrible by any means, but there are much beter examples of the genre already available (most of them on discount).

As top industrial activist on the scene, it's your job to holler 'Everybody out!', negotitate wage rises, extra holidays and shorter working weeks until finally reaching a series of compromises which leave you worse off than you were before when The Management threaten to draft in Korean slaves for 3p an hour. But what will you do whilst you're not working? Well, Time Warner seem to think you'll have a few games on football, for that is the main focus of Striker '95. Actually, given that the last game with the Striker title was also a football game, it's likely we might have our story wrong. But Striker isn't just any football, game, it's one of the most critically applauded examples of the genre.

Much as it would be great to replicate this in a cricket sim Nintendo have, rather surprisingly, elected not to. Instead they've opted for the linseed-smelling world of the international game and its stars, well kind of because Nintendo have decided on the 'made-up' names option for their cricket sim. An interesting little extra touch that's been built in is the appeal button. Rather than automatically shouting 'Howzat' for an LBW appeal you have to decide whether your team should appeal on not. Admittedly it's hardly a breakthrough in game science, but it's an interesting little diversion. TWO PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED.. NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. Super International 54 "

Finish your over first. COME BACK I SAID. Right, that's it, you're fired. MEGA DRIVE Cricket sims are never easy to produce. Odds on if the strokeplay's right, then the bowling will all go to cock and the fielding, well forget it. D&O's entry into cricket sims gets it mostly right with nicely defined sprites bowling and playing shots that actually resemble something like cricket. On the downside the fielding can get a little confus ing at times as does the screen when play zooms out.

"A REVIEW CVG REVIEW PC CD-ROM BEAT-EM-UP PHILIPS EUNCONFIRMED OUT JULY DIFFICULT. FLOPPY VERSION PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE After ruling the technical roost for years, the PCS finally has to fight back against upstart consoles... hose readers with strange, freak sponge memories like that bloke on Record Breakers who could tell you what day any particular date past or future falls on may remember when we last showcased FX Fighter. It was on the cover of issue 157, represented by a rather alarming-looking woman holding a giant cheese puff. Well we're sorry to report that the finished game does not in fact contain any kind of savoury snackage. Neither cheese puffs nor Twiglets nor e'en porky scratching. It's what you'd have to call a nibbles-free zone (unless you count a couple of the characters feasting upon the live bodies of their opponents). So sorry if any of our beer-gut owning readership feel cheated. But don't weep, for the finished version of the game features more than mere bar snacks can provide. Like texture mapping (although if you eat enough Twiglets you're very likely to 'texture map' the floor), and special moves and aliens. And, of course, there's the de rigeur 3D one-on-one beat-'em-up fun we're seeing so much of lately. The difference is that this example of the genre is on PC, breaking the console monopoly on swish arcadey games. Next thing you know the PlayStation'll be swamped by lengthy war game scenario things with crap graphics and no sound, or Spectrum emulators. A quick morning aerobics sesh with ALIEN GUNS-BORG Like all games of this type, FX Fighter gives you a choice of wildly differing characters, each with their own personal attributes. And just so's you can get a feel for the cast here's a run-down of the four most interesting ones. "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG MAGNON A rock-beast of the first order, Magnon is made entirely of crusty lava. As you might expect from this sort of character Magnon is very strong but not particularly agile. His Lava Breath and Bearhug moves are the most impressive. SHEBA A kind of cat-woman feline claws-ahoy character. Her animation is absolutely superb, as are her contortionistic kicks and throws. And she's named after some cat food, which on the good or bad list is without a doubt on the bad one. VENAM If you like Praying Mantises Venam's your man (or rather your insect). Able to spit poison (unlike real Manti), bite the faces/nethers of his foes, and makes clicky insect speech noises when he wins, which in the insect world translates as 'I won.' CYBEN 30 with a name like that, it's a good job he's a robot, or he'd get a lot of stick from his mates. His flying Blastoff Throw and electric Cyben Shock close-to moves cause rucks of damage on his sometimes unwitting opponents, well maybe not that unwitting. * 4 ** TERET What goes up must come down, and usually on your head. PARTY OF EIGHT If you've got loads of mates, well, you're reading the wrong magazine for starters, but anyway if you've got loads of mates, you may be interested in FX Fighter's fab tournament mode. This allows up to eight lucky participants (ha ha that said pants) to face off against each other. Simply pick your character(s), enter your name and the computer does the rest. Apart from the actual fighting. It does, however, work out all the final rankings and placements, so you'll quickly establish a social pecking order. SCORES GRAPHICS .95 LZS SOUND CYBEN GAMEPLAY... S VALUE OVERALL............. VERDICT PC CD-ROM In the grand scheme of things, FX Fighter isn't the best game of its type on the market. But you can't really expect to get Virtua Fighter 2 on a PC anyway, Pentium or not. FX Fighter is, however, a pretty splendid game with an impressive collection of special moves and combos. The only real problem is that the amount of button-bashing required seems disproportional to the actual combat displayed on-screen (and can lead to some sore fingers). If you're just after a straight beat-'em-up, I'd probably rate Street Fighter over this, but if it's atmosphere and general excitement you're after, check out FX Fighter.

In fact, he's got four types of magic at his disposal -Earth, Water, Air and Fire, each element is powered-up by various magical tokens spread around the game. Various combinations of elements are used to create up to 15 different spells one for every occassion, from fighting to flighting.

Let's face it, inquisitive lone adventurers the staple diet of RPGs set themselves up for some real trouble. Take Barry Light, for example. He's one of those unproven swordsman fate has selected, to become a legendary hero, just because he happened to stumble across a hidden catacomb while poking around in an eerie graveyard. Now for most people, this is where the warning bells start a-ringing and you get the flock out there, never to return. But not Barry, oh no. He's in there like a jackrabbit, sword at the ready. And what does he find in there? Why, a horde on evil monsters and a series of impassable death traps laid by an equally evil sorceror. Now even if you'd been stupid enough to go down in the first place, that is definitely the point at which vou run screaming back to the local army barracks and have a squad of armoured-up warriors steam in and do the dirty work for you. But not Barry. Oh no, Well Baz, don't come crying to us when you have all your limbs severed and organs splayed by the doyens of Beelzebub. And thus begins Light Crusader, the latest title from the revered Treasure stable. Something of a departure from their usual mix of distinctive graphics and Trenzied gameplay, this is an isometric view RPG with the emphasis very much on puzzles. Although you'll still need a steady joypad, hand if you want to complete the bleeder, it's your brain that takes most of the strain.

I've yet to see a simulation that features a corrupt keeper that takes backhanders to swing the game. Or a title that boasts a management mode that allows you a bung as part of your transfer deal. No siree, residents of Gametown don't use drugs to enhance their performance and they don't cheat (well-ish). In the noblest spirit of the game Player Manager 2 features none of those naughty elements above, although you can bet that there's some cheats somewhere. Being a footy management sim it goes without saying that you can do practically anything concerned with the greatest of sports, but PM2's greatest asset is that it allows you to play an updated version of Kick Off 2 (that old classic). It's a neat combination, stats and tactics for the pure sim freaks and some joystick wobbling for those who like a little more than just numbers.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE SPORTS SEGA .99 Pete may have been knocked out in the first round of the French Open, but in the Mega Drive world he's top thanks to the Codies... FOUR PLAYERS THE VERSIONS PLANNED EESHUIS AVAILABLE W Pete Sampras BATTERS SAMPRAS ennis is a cooler than it used to be, back in the days when it was all Ginny Wade with her posh voice and Jimmy Connors with that naff haircut. Now we have the model-like Sabatini and Seles, Agassi looking like he's about to go surfing rather than serving and all those trendy luminous racquets. Not forgetting Pete of course, Wimbledon Common champ and certainly the best player down our rec'. If you play as Mr Sampras in the Codies' latest addition to their sports game portfolio it doesn't guarantee that you'll win every tournament, though. Pete Sampras '96, like the Codies' earlier Brian Lara goes for the realism factor big time with plenty of the rights sounds and effects that really simulate the sport well. The first Sampras game was an excellent game, but the '96 version has the players throwing tantrums (and their racquets) and each player's stats truly reflects the way that they'll play so Sampras is a good server, whereas Potter hasn't won a tournament yet (he's British). The sound is realistic with the crowd, shots and the umpire's speech being top notch. The action replays are the most fun when you're in the multiplayer mode (it's a J-Cart of course): teasing your opponents with those cannie drop shots, or the top spin that you inflicted on the ball with that nifty aftertouch. Oh and in true Blur spirit there's Boys 'n' Girls, playing together in true equal Nineties style. SEEDED SEEDED SEEDED GRAPHICS VERDICT... MEGA DRIVE Sampras '96 is a tidy update of what was already a good multiplayer tennis game, and the sound effects, player tantrums and anims all add to the feel and authenticity of the game. The players react and play to their world ranking and reputations, and the game has more options than Cindy Crawford in a singles bar. The only drawback is the perspective which makes it difficult to judge certain shots, especially when you're at the far end. Once you master the control system however, you'll find an armoury of shots and not a drastically different game to the original and fine sports sim nonetheless. GARY LORD EFFECTS 85 GAMEPLAY....

And wear pants. The sort of ape you'll find scaring explorers Michael Crichton's blatant DK rip-off Kong-o. In fact, if it was up to Donkey Kong, there wouldn't be any explorers in the first place, because he'd have ripped off all the secreted jungle treasures himsell, and spent the money on bananas. Mind you, it's not like Donkey Kong, or his diminutive sidekick, Diddy Kong, need the cash anyway. After years in the gaming wilderness they surprised everyone with a triumphant fully-rendered comeback in the form of Super NES Donkey Kong Country. And now the lucky skunks are set to repeat this performance in a scaled-down (though no less technic cally-accomplished, it would appear) Game Boy version, entitled Donkey Kong Land. Like its predecessor DK Land is a platform escapade with digitised-effect 3D-style graphics which aren't really 3D (a bit like chocolate-flavour coating on cheap biscuits). But one thing it does promise to have is skipfuls of playability. Find out if this is true in our reiew next month, apefans! DONKEY KONG & MARIO The parallels between the respective careers of performing duos Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel and Donkey Kong and Mario are uncanny. DK and Mario both started their working lives in the same feature Donkey Kong, with Kong (obviously) taking the starring role. Donk's position as the hard man of games continued through a couple of sequels, but then the home consoles arrived, and Mario, in his first leading role, outshined his former pal. Relationships between the pair soured for a number of years as Mario's ascent to superstardom continued while the Donkster languished in obscurity. That was until the amazing Mario Kart, which reunited the formidable pair and introduced DK to a whole new audience. And now the career paths would appear to have reversed, as Donkey Kong Country took the Christmas sales charts by storm, while all Mario can manage is the occassional bit-part in a puzzle game (see Plcross review, this issue).

"PREVIEW PC CD-ROM, 300, AMIGA, MACINTOSH. STRATEGY... GAMETEK A cursed Earth where gradually we all go bald. .99. OUT SEPTEMBER TWO PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED............. NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE.. 960 6800 aldies is basically a god game. A god game about bald blokes. So, does this mean that the all-knowing, allavenging omni-present supreme being is follically challenged? Suppose it makes a certain degree of sense, after all we're talking about the oldest thing in the universe, it stands to reason that hair-loss would be inevitable. But would our Lord go for a graft or the more obvious syrup? Can't be much fun fighting Satan in a ginger wig, can it? Baldies, as the subtlety of the game's name suggests, will be about an indigenous race of slap heads who it'll be your job to guide through their chrome-domed lives. The basic aim of the game is to dominate the comedy world of Baldy using different types of slappy-chappies to perform tasks in the same manner as games like Populous and Settlers. And unfortunately for the hairier inhabitants of the world, their demise is a judge of your success and subsequent progression to pastures new. Being on a comedy tip, Baldies features some fairly bizarre levels, they'll vary from your bog-standard Egyptian level through to a mad mushroom world. Using the standard icon-based control interface you'll be able to command your hairless heroes to your heart's desire in a bid to dominate the hundred or so lands that exist in Baldies. The system works by simply picking up the relevant Baldy and dropping him in your designated area and setting him to work. As you'll probably have guessed from what we've been rabbiting on about, Baldies has a heavy strategy angle. You'll have to combine expansion with invention in your bid for dome-ination, utilising your scientists for the invention of weapons like an exploding cow (believe it or not it's one of the comedy weapons involved). while your builders maintain housing for your ever increasing popu lation these bald folk are worse than rabbits, well they could hardly be hares (groan). The artificial intelligence aspect of Baldies will mean that both you and your enemies get smarter as you progress deeper into the game. Your little follicle-free-fellas get better at their job as you develop, as does their overall technological level. Just to dispell total comparison to the god games, Baldies keeps its scalp shining firmly towards stupidity. For example, you'll be able to subversively sneak your Baldies in trees so that they can surprise advancing enemies and they'll be able to perform other unlikely bald-headed chores like flying or walk on water. Oh yeah there's also supposed to be some snowball yielding enemies to plunder as well. What with a four-player networked game and a two-player modem option and a whole load of cut-scene animations, Baldies! should be the revolution wiggies and bone heads have been wishing for since the first bald bloke shyly shuffled into the knitting shop to purchase a woollen wig.

Those are two games who's success is guaranteed, but Primal's the dark dino lurking on their horizon... ZARD Primal Rage is one of those coin-ops, like Tekken and Killer Instinct, which on the surface seemed nothing more than one big gimmick with almost zero gameplay. Then, once a few moves have been gleaned from the scabby bit of plastic on top of the machine, it turns out to be one of the best bits of hardware sitting in the arcade. Since then Primal Rage's success has only been temporarily stunted by the arrival of games such as MK3, but it won't matter in the very near future as Time Warner line up this potential monster hit to break on almost every format new and old. And the Amiga. With Nintendo producing an almost arcade-perfect version of Killer Instinct for the SNES (see last issue) expectations have got to be high as to the quality of the home versions of Primal now that it's been proved possible to produce almost arcade-perfect versions of modern coin-ops within the realms of 16-bit HOW THE GAME WAS DONE Unlike Killer Instinct, where the characters are all modelled on a SGI workstation, or Mortal 3 where it's a few martial arts actors in strange costumes, Primal Rage's creation is more akin to Morph if you can remember that far back. Unlike Morph, the dinosaurs aren't models made out of a bit of cheap plasticine with thumb prints in, but highly detailed, fully posable creations costing thousands of pounds.

VIDEO Street Fighter Déjà Vu Warriors' Dreams Beat-'em-up |  per play Capcom 1-2 Players LOOF Do we need another version of Street Fighter? It's been reincarnated in more forms than Michael Jackson's face and now it's here in what is considered to be its ultimate form, or so Capcom claim. Mind you, if its early popularity in the 'test arcades' is any gauge, then it's going to be absolutely massive. When we were on site there were at least a dozen eager beavers hanging around each test machine. Street Fighter Alpha features the original 10 champions that Capcom brought to us all those years back but in a totally new way. Admittedly, it's still uses 2D technology to display the game (how long Capcom will persist with this now outdated look is anyone's guess. but I'd put my money on SF Alpha being one of their last 2D ventures) but all the sprites have been overhauled. The face lift has given all your fave characters like Ken and Ryu a complete over haul and a lick of paint, well they've been redrawn, feature more colour and have been generally sharpened up. It's the same story with the backdrops that you fight in front of. They all feature even more bits of background animation that go on around your contests. For example, the New Orleans level features a jazz band playing behind you as you clash with one of the other nine household names. In terms of real differences to the play, Capcom have introduced a pretty innovative idea to help the novice. Basically when you go through the selection Food for thought At first glance Baku Baku looks like it's come from the same dominion as Kirby's Avalanche and Puyo Puyo, but as you play the game you'll see it has a rather strange and different twist. The object of this intriguing game is to place the same food types together (bananas, bones, bamboo shoots and carrots) and put the right animal next to them. For example, joining bananas together and then placing a monkey block next to them will make a head expand to devour the food. There are four animals that re are four animals that accompany each food type: these are a dog, a monkey, a rabbit and, last and in least supply, a panda. As the different food or animals drop down you must place them in order as you would in Kirby's Avalanche using the button to change the blocks to a horizontal or vertical position. If for any reason you fail to connect animal with food type, then the blocks build and rise up the screen as in Tetris.

Zone Hunter challenges you to take on the role of a 21st century urban warrior in a lethal world of virtual assassins and strange alien beings. Utilising Virtuality's latest 2000SU technology your virtual self must walk around the city exploring alien-infested sewers and gloomy alleyways in search of three power-up pods. As you discover the pods, your weapons and skills are upgraded and your health revitalised. But most importantly of all, your survival chances are improved. Zone Hunter is a step closer to the feeling of total immersion that Virtuality aspire to and the graphical look features much more detail than previous attempts. It plays like a kind of virtual Doom except that it's much tougher because it takes time to acclimatise to controlling yourself inside the hidden world of a headset. Ultimately, this is going to cost cash, but the pay back will come when your understanding of the environment and the control met hod begins to improve.

Shoot-'em-up  per play Atari 11-2 Player have taken the basic premise of Battlezone and shoved it hard into the Nineties. The idea's pretty straight forward, you drive a tank of your choice around a texture-mapped arena taking on CPU tanks and a human opponent (if there's someone sitting in the other booth). Your tank is controlled in the same fashion as it was in Battlezone using a combination of two joysticks to manoeuvre you around the gladiatorial arena. The play areas themselves are a texture-mapped combination of barren wastelands, rocky outcrops and debris with the odd power-up icon popped in for good measure. T-Mek isn't that special when you put it up against titles like Cyber Commando which is currently wowing arcadesters the world over. However, its saving grace is the two-player link-up which allows you to blow your friends into tiny pieces. After all, that's what friends are for.

But, before entering the ring you must decide upon armour types, chassis design and the all-important pilot which gives your automaton the human factor. This game should be dubbed Armoured Warriors 2 because it features the same mechanised stars, but instead of being a shoot-'em-up feast Capcom have changed the concept into a full-on hard core beat-'em-up. Cyberbots features large, well animated sprites and well drawn backdrops with each battle taking place in a ruined city that has been taken over by one of the menacing robots. Each machine has the nor mal quota of moves and specials and most are pretty simple to pick up, so it's an ideal beginner's coin-op.

"CVG LETTERS in the THE JAG'S ACE IT'S US Hello readers, it's the collective brain of CVG speaking here. Now, as you may have noticed, the last three or four letters pages have been almost exclusively Jaguar orientated. Now while we wouldn't normally mind this is after all your forum most of the letters we're receiving are straight Jag vs Saturn/Jag vs 3D0 slaggin'-type missives. There's something of an absence of reasoning or actual debate, in favour of 'Darryl Still's got a knob on his head' or 'Trip Hawkins has got a fat arse' lyricisms. Next month we're not going to print any of this tosh. If you've got a point to make, go ahead, but if you're just having a whinge save it for your mates, because we don't want to know (and we're sure most of our readers don't either). Also, we'd quite like to see a few more subjects broached on these pages. There's a lot of hardware-centred letters coming in, but what about software? Do you reckon the Next Gen consoles will revolutionise, gameplay, or just make it more expensive? What, apart from games, would you like to see companies do with all this new technology? Does anyone think it's time for a standardised format? Or is competition healthy for the industry? Or what? Come on, there's more to life than the Jaguar (unless you're a Jaguar owner), so mark your envelope I PROMISE THIS LETTER IS INTERESTING and send it to the address below. Sorry for going on a bit, but it's our magazine and we can do what we want. I am writing in reply to the letter sent in by Anthony Stevens and the Ex-Atari Fan from issue 163 (June). OK, there still aren't many decent games avaialble for the Jaguar, but believe me there are some good ones out there AVP, Doom, Tempest 2000, Checkered Flag, Iron Soldier, an excellent Wolfenstein 3D and the classics Sensi Soccer, Syndicate, Theme Park and Cannon Fodder. There are some tremendous games on their way to the Jaguar too, Ultra Vortex, Fight for Life, AVP2, Super Burnout, Magic Carpet just to name a few. No 3D0 game has music anywhere near that in Tempest 2000, with the Jag CD and VR helmet on the way the prospects for the Jaguar are looking up. The only problems with Atari are that the word marketing doesn't mean a thing to them, also nobody wants old games on a 64-BIT wonder machine (what was the point of Raiden, Dino Dudes, Dragon, Soccer Kid and Flashback?). There are no two-player games that can better Deathmatch linked on Jag Doom. Just before I go, 'Ex-Atari Fan' how much did you pay for your 3DO...? , that's all! Craig Daly, Grangetown, Cardiff CVG: We're not particularly sure about some of the software you've mentioned there, but you're sort of right in your sentiments. We reckon the Jag would have done a lot better if Atari had got a decent PR house in at the start (as well as getting out some ace games).

Which should I go for? Simon Fletcher, Sittingbourne, Kent. DEAR CVG, Which Next Generation console should I get? See, first there is the PSX: it looks and sounds good but Sony are new to the market; the 3DO looked good and EA backed it quite well, but software support ain't too hot. Then there is the Jag, but I don't trust Atari after owning a Lynx and ST, they produce good machines but don't promote them well enough. The Neo Geo looks OK but it only has CVG: Wait for the official releases and choose the machine with the games that most suit your tastes is the simplest way to choose a new console. 78 "


"LETTERS Cc bag DON'T BUY IMPORTS DEAR CVG I am writing to you to warn your readers about imports. Don't buy them. I purchased a Jap Famicom about three to four years ago and I have had nothing but problems with it. It turns out that not all SCART TVs give a full picture as I first thought; first of all it has to accept some sort of signal and even if it does that you are not guaranteed to be able to adjust the colour. Not only that but after the SNES was officially released I found that shops that previously stocked import titles now only stocked UK titles with only a few second-hand import titles. And to top it all, titles like MK2 which got a simultaneous worldwide release date were impossible to get hold of, which meant I had to buy another adaptor which would play MK2. As much as I want a PlayStation I know I would be wiser to wait for the official release, because it would be cheaper, easier to repair, there will always be new UK games in the shops and if Sony decided to release an add-on I'd know I'd eventually be able to get hold of it (have you ever seen a Japanese Super Game Boy or 32X?). Andrew Spiretos, Leeds CVG: Wise words, there. It's not the fault of the shops, who simply go where the money is (which is what they're in business for), but software support for import machines does tend to tail off after the official release of a machine. And they're a right pain to get repaired ask Rad, who blew up our first Saturn). I QUITE AGREE The problem with free speech is that assholes get it as well. Yes, the PSX has more polygon power than the Jag, and so does the Saturn probably. But the PSX is bugged isn't it? Yes, it is. And it DOES slow down doesn't it? Er, yes. And, erm, it's two 'best' games, Ridge Racer and Tekken are bugged aren't they? Well, yes. And programmers have written to 'techie' mags slagging it off, eh? Yup. The problem here is one upmanship, Sega and Sony are trying to out-polygon each other while Atari have gone for a powerful allround machine (so when Rayman comes out on the Jag and PSX and the mags say they are the same, sue them readers, because as far as I know the Jag version has 65,000 colours, and the PSX can only handle 32000). Best resolution Jag. Most sound channels Jag. Most colours on screen Jag. so much for technical inadequacy'! Don't give me any crap about original games, either. And saying the 32X/3DO are technically better than or even equal to a Jag shows stunning stupidity (and points out the 32X/3DO owners). Mark Johnston, Livingstone, W Lothian. WHAT A GOOD IDEA DEAR CVG. I agree with Simon Cooper's idea of a PC CD-ROM console for gameplaying. I thought of this idea long ago and it has always amazed me why no companies have ever decided to produce one because: 1 The technology is already there so no development costs. 2 There is already a huge selection of brill games. 3 The format has proved itself to be more powerful than most of its competitors and is continually being improved. 4 The only reasons that the PC CD-ROM format has not outsold other games formats are that A It always comes attached to a lot of expensive PC parts such as a hard disk which up the price drastically, and B PCs are very difficult to use, but a console format would simplify using it incredibly. 5 The PC CD-ROM has a huge amount of users and therefore a very secure future. 6 Finally, it would also make the perfect home multimedia system, with CDs such as Encarta and an FMV card available. With reasons this good I can't understand why nobody has decided to put this fab idea into use. Many people want PCs as games machines because of their sheer power, and yet many cannot afford to pay over ,000 for one. I think PC companies are missing out on large profits by not realising this, and many of us are missing out on a brill games machine. No name supplied CVG: Having played Ridge Racer and Tekken extensively, we've never noticed any major slow-down, so you're wrong there. And I'm afraid we're going to give you some 'crap' about original games the Saturn and PlayStation, while not swamped in classics, have exhibited more of a thrust towards innovation than the Jaguar has so far. CVG: The trouble is you'd still need a keyboard, FMV card and the same weird backwards-compatible architecture which scuppers the PC on cost in order to run all the software. It's a nice idea, but impractical. NO IT ISN'T DEAR CVG, In response to Noel Wallace's letter in issue 164, I'll tell you why the Jaguar hasn't been advertised as the world's first 64-bit machine it's because it isn't 64. bit. It has 32-bit graphics and 32-bit sound. If you did what Atari have done then the SNES would be 24-bit and the Mega Drive 20-bit. However the Jag doesn't even stand a chance against the Next Generation machines such as the real 64-bit (or 128 if you add it all together) the Nintendo Ultra 64. Another point is the awful coverage of the NU4 in magazines. CVG has done moderately well but seems to get all the worst possible rumours. At first CVG said it would ever come out in Britain. Only a couple of issues ago CVG said it may cost . Still you've got your act together and now you can print the whole truth the Ultra 64 will wipe the floor clean. Roll on April '96 and good luck to the PSX and Saturn, they'll need it. Thanks for your time and keep up the excellent work Matthew Andrews, Southbourne, Hants CVG: Yeah, yeah if it ever comes out.

"TIPS CVG TIPS SEGA SALE HELP! Dear CVG. 1. I've got a Mega Drive and I want to flog it, is this wise? And if it is, could you tell me what I should spend the cash on? I should make around . CVG: Blimey, is your Mega Drive gold plated or something? Even with tons of software you'll be lucky to get this much moolah since the Mega Drive is at that point in its life where it is about as desirable as a backside full of bum plums. Still, if you do get  for it then a wise investment would be a UK PlayStation come September. The Saturn would make a good alternative, especially if you like Daytona USA. It might also be a good idea to keep an eye on the M2, it looks interesting... 2. I also have a 25Mhz 386SX PC which I'm selling as it's a bit feeble. Would it be wise to sell the games I've got and spend the cash on some 65000 newer software? CVG: Depends on your software and how much you like it really. If you've got a collection of classics then it might be a wise idea to hang on to them. Otherwise go ahead and flog them. PC software fetches a decent price second hand. 3. Is there going to be another Street Fighter game? CVG: Yeah, we reviewed the new arcade The Movie game last ish and there's also a Street Fighter Zero which takes place before the original Streetfighter and includes younger versions of popular characters. The graphic style will be more cartoony like the excellent Darkstalkers series of games. Ali Houston, Glasgow SONY SO FAR Dear CVG.

Want to join the happy clan? Then fire off your missives to the address elsewhere on this page and we'll be right on the case... 1. How much do you think the PlayStation will, retail at? CVG: Around - 2. The Saturn has an optional steering wheel for the likes of Daytona USA. Do you think Sony will release a similar device for use on Ridge Racer and other racing games? CVG: Yes, there's one in development. 3. Are Namco releasing Ridge Racer 2 on PlayStation? CVG: Yes. 4. Which is the more powerful machine out of the PlayStation and Saturn? CVG: They each have their own strengths and weaknesses but overall the PlayStation is arguably the more powerful machine. 5.At the moment I have an Amiga and a Mega Drive. Do you think I should sell them to get a PlayStation, is it really that good? CVG: Yes and yes. 6. Do you think games accessories such as joypads will be cheaper or dearer on the PlayStation and Saturn compared to SNES and Mega Drive? CVG: Probably more expensive. 7. How come nobody is developing games for the Lynx any more? CVG: Because despite being an ace machine it was overpriced and badly marketed and consequently a spectacular flop. Lloyd Read, Essex. 1. Will the earthquake in Kobe involve the gaming industry and if a big one comes below Tokyo in a couple of years will the industry collapse? CVG: No, don't worry, the games industry is built from very strong foundations and should survive any future earthquakes. We reckon the Kobe earthquake was just an excuse for nasty hardware people to push up the price of RAM chips. 2. When is Rebel Assault on the CD-i coming out? CVG: When it's finished. 3. Has Nintendo forgotten Mario and Zelda? CVG: Have a look on page 60. 4. When will SF3 come out I know that there is a digitised version and a legends version coming out. They may have an improvement but they are not the SF3 game you and, my are waiting for? CVG: Blimey, you're not my old English teacher are you? 5. I have a SNES and at present don't own any version of Street Fighter. I want the best so which version do you suggest I get? CVG: Well, it has to be the most recent version and at present that's Super Street Fighter 2. 6. Could Ridge Racer come out on Ultra 64 or is it a PlayStation only game? CVG: Namco are very chummy with Sony but rumour has it that Ridge Racer is on its way to the Saturn and if that's the case then there's no reason why it shouldn't hit the Ultra 64 too. Of course it may be considered too old by then. 7. Will the Ultra 64 be able to produce games better looking than on a Pentium PC? CVG: Yes. 8. I own Doom 2 but can't get past level 2 as I'm a beginner. What is the level select? CVG: Oh come on, why spoil the fun? Try a bit of practice and everything will be perfect.

"ups CVG TIPS MK3 FRST ON JAG? Dear CVG 1. Is MK3 really coming out on Jaguar first because I've heard otherwise? CVG: It was originally slated to debut on Jag but Sony usurped Atari and now MK3 will be exclusively on PlayStation for six months, After that the Jag and all other versions will be released. 2. How much is the VR helmet going to be for the Jaguar, when will it be released and will you have to buy special games for it or will it play all games? CVG: The helmet is scheduled for an October release, no price as yet. You can play any game on the helmet but it won't enhance them. Other games which take advantage of the helmet are being developed. 3. Will the Jaguar be as powerful as the PlayStation when attached to its CD ROM drive? CVG: No. 4. Are there any decent racing games in development for the Jaguar? CVG: Super Burnout looks promising as does F1 Racer Luke Bennett, W. Midlands. 3DO REALLY? SATURNALIA Dear CVG. I have recently bought myself a US Goldstar 3DO. would be grateful if you could answer the following questions: 1. Is the M2 upgrade and the MPEG video CD unit uni versally compatible? CVG: Yes, it's like the situation with the Mega Drive and Mega-CD. Both units will work on all machines but obviously some will look better than others. 2. Will the UK versions work on US machines? CVG: We doubt it, although it's possible the M2 will be universal. It depends on whether it has video hardware inside that needs to be configured differently for the UK PAL and US NTSC standards. 3. When will M2 be officially released and how do you think it will compare to the PlayStation, Saturn and Ultra 64? CVG: M2 will be released in December. It's arguably the most powerful home console hardware yet released but the danger is that before it has the chance to establish itself it will be superseded by the 'next next generation of hardware just as the current next generation of hardware has eclipsed the original 3DO. 4. Are any software companies interested in the M2 and have any software companies signed up to develop for it? CVG: There's quite a favourable reaction to the M2. but the feeling generally is that 3D0 don't have the marketing mus cle to make the machine the success it should be, especially when up against the likes of Sony, Nintendo and Sega. Only 12 Nintendo-style 'Dream Team' software houses have so far been granted permission to develop for the M2, but other software houses are also expected to join in develop ment at a later date under an 'Alpha Team' monicker. 5. Could you tell me when Doom, Magic Carpet and Primal Rage are coming out for the 3DO? CVG: No concrete dates, but they should all be out around September time. 6. Is Magic Carpet going to be any good as it required a very powerful PC to run decently? CVG: That's more a reflection on the PC's crappy architecture than the game. There's no reason why it shouldn't be a competent conversion. 7. What happened to Sadie, the high score babe? CVG: She's currently living somewhere near Cheam and is helping the Reynolds Girls write new songs. Alex Read, Bucks Dear Help 1. I was wondering whether Virtua Fighter will come with the Saturn when it's released? CVG: See our Sega special in the first half of the mag. 2. Will the Saturn joystick be any good for Virtua Fighter? CVG: If it's anything like the arcade power stick for the Mega Drive then it should be excellent. 3. Which machine do you think has the best joypad: PlayStation or Saturn? CVG: Definitely the PlayStation, it's just a shame the cable's so short. 4. When Alien Trilogy is released for the Saturn is it going to be as boring as Alien vs. Predator? CVG: Mark's seen it and reckons it's the business. 5. When will we see some reviews of Virtua Fighter 2? CVG: We've already reviewed the arcade version, oh loyal reader, and the Saturn version will get the once over as soon as it's finished.

"CVGTAS TIPS Vomit stained paths, yobs, exploding rides, dead punters. It's all in a day's work for yer average Theme Park owner. But life can be made that bit easier thanks to this indispensable guide. Theme RA HD Park One of the core facts to remember is don't go for broke on your first park. Start with a small, well maintained base. This way you won't find yourself suddenly confronted with ten million problems as rides break down all over the place. With a smaller park you can keep in control and deal with individual crises as they happen. MEGA DRIVE AND SNES Also, don't worry about removing rides that aren't placed properly. This way although you lose some cash, your mechanics aren't tied up repairing a ride people aren't going to use any way. THE BASICS The key to running a successful, profitable theme park is to keep all your little visitors happy. But they're buggers to please and even something as piddling as a puddle of vomit will set them off and they'll leave the park in droves. ROUND-A-BOUT The basic equation for big bucks is to have plenty of rides. This way you can charge higher ticket prices and still attract more punters. This leads to much more cash, more research and even more rides. This means you should always keep an eye on their thought bubbles. For instance, if several 'I'm hungry' bubbles crop up in the same area it's a good bet that that's the place for a food stall. Individual thoughts can often be ignored, but when the punters get together it's a sure sign something's wrong. One thing to bear in mind though, rides break down much faster as they age, so any chronically ill dog. knackered rides in your park should be deleted and replaced so your mechanics aren't repairing them every couple of minutes. GONE SHOPPIN' Of all the features you can place in your park, a correctly positioned shop selling the right stuff at the right price will make you the most money and keep people happy at the same time. Best of all, placing a coffee shop selling ultra-high caffeine wicked-brew by the front gate will make your little people whiz around the park right from the start. HOLANCE HONEY OUT BUS PEOPLE a 0 W ZZUOC . TV 2 COST 1995 Litter is a real problem. A dirty park won't attract many customers and you won't win any hygiene awards.

Don't fleece them too much as they're not wholly stupid and won't come back if they feel cheated. A small cost and reasonable prize coupled with a moderate chance of winning provides a more reliable income than a risky high-cost prize, but lower chance, stall. Dodgy stalls can make you a lot of money in a fairly short space of time, but it's not worth taking the risk on each side so that people leaving one attraction will be heading straight for the queue of the next one, or a shop. By doing this the people will zig-zag between the rides and the amount of walk ing they'll have to do will be cut down to a minimum. The only problem with this is that it doesn't leave much room to put in all those decorative little touches, so your park could end up looking bland, which will put people off. The other bonus of stalls is that they entertain people and don't produce litter. Because they're smaller than rides they can be slotted into several small places around the park. Variety is important though, as people won't go to the same kind of stall over and over again. Bear in mind that people are just as impressed with older stalls as they are with high-tech ones. One method of park design worth experimenting with is by making it a one-way system. This way people have no choice but to walk around the park in an orderly manner. This has FEATURES Never underestimate features such as fences, tress and lakes. A featureless park is dead dull and people wandering around it will soon get bored. As well as making it look better on-screen, plenty of features will impress new-comers to the park. Remember that some of these features aren't cheap, so if you're short of cash you're better off investing in a ride. LADY IN RED SIIS IS PIE TINE IN PARIS BIDES BEEN O. BOREDOM PARK LIFE When you're planning your park always keep in mind what the little people will want at any one time and place things accordingly. Put a balloon shop right near the entrance so people part with their cash while they're still happy. This usually puts them in a good mood for the rest of their visit to the theme park unless they get blown up on one of your dodgy rides. HONEY RENA It's also important to keep the amount of leg-work the punters have to go through down to a minimum. One way to do this is to have a straight path with rides coming off either side. Each ride should be butted up against the side of the path with the entrance around the back and the exit leading back on to the path. A short queue should link the path to the entrance. It's worth trying to stagger the rides 83 "


"TIPS CVG TIPS advantages in that you should be able to work out exactly what any person will be wanting at any one time and be ready for it. The downside comes from too many people entering the park. Queues get really busy and people won't be able to try out the rides. Still, if the attractions are strong, and the scenery nice enough, hopefully they'll stay and do another circuit. THINGS TO REMEMBER  Open your park the second you start the game running. This lets one or two customers appear even if the majority stay away.  Slow the game speed right down when you're designing the park. This gives you more time to place the rides and gives you a bit of breathing space when playing the game.  New rides are essential and you should have something going through the research mill. Try to buy new rides as soon as they become available. UNITED KINGDOM COST O . When you place a ride, remember to leave enough space nearby in case you need to move the exit.

There's no point in buying the land before the end of the taxfree period, and even less point if you're planning to move on and build a new park elsewhere. .  If things get bad and your park's unpopular, don't be afraid to sell things at a loss for a short period. Cut prices and the people will come back, at which point you bump the prices up again. Banana OELD  A big, modern park is the most valuable of all, so by placing expensive rides and shops you'll increase its value. This lets you sell it faster for more money.

"TIPS TIPS CVG PEOPLE POWER The number and type of staff you have employed can make or break your park. When you place shops you should employ handymen. When your first ride starts to go wrong, employ a mechanic. Entertainers are handy to keep people happy while your mechanic fixes broken rides. HANDYMEN Employ a handyman the instant that litter starts appearing. keep an eye on them, though, as they tend to get lost in com plicated parks, leaving large areas chocka with rubbish. HANDYDAN TONTHS EMPLOYED TIME WORKING the punters in the mood to part them from their money before they've even entered.   . Always watch the 'bus people' graph line on the finance screen. This will give you an indication of the number of people your park's attracting. If it drops you know you'll have to provide a great incentive for people to come, such as lowering prices or installing new rides MECHANICS Hire a mechanic as soon as your first ride starts breaking down. They're prone to sitting on their arses munching sarnies though, so keep tabs on them. Most of the time a mechanic will reach a nearby ride before it blows up, but if there's more, than one ide in trouble you should direct them to one in the most immediate danger then shut the other one down or employ another mechanic. A single mechanic can usually take care of three to four rides, although this changes as it depends on the quality of the rides and how popular they are.  When times are hard cut down on research. It's one of your biggest outgoings.  There's plenty of fun, non-profit making stuff in the game. For instance, try deleting the entrances to the rubber tubing ride when people are using it and watch them whirl around forever. The same goes for the roller coaster. A slightly more risky tactic when it comes to damaged rides is to slow the speed of a ride right down while your mechanic is fixing another one. After that keep your fingers crossed that it doesn't explode before the mechanic gets to it. If it works, it means that people still have a ride to go to, rather than two busted ones to look at s en ENTERTAINERS Always place your entertainers near queues that have a long wait time. This should keep the people happy while they wait. At least one entertainer should be placed near the park entrance too, so people enter the park in the night frame of mind and, more importantly, leave happy. This way they're more likely to come back with their mates and spend more cash when they're inside. BUZZY BEE 22000 SPODEZ. BOUGE 85 "

KEY He is Law (as opposed to being the law, like Mr Dredd), and although he's an Americano his martial arts expertise stems from the fact that he has Chinese origins, but not that he works in a Chinese restaurant. Law is 179cm tall, 25-years-old and is B blood group. Law is entering the fighting compo 'cos he wants to make his name in the martial arts world and eventually open his own martial arts hall.

"TIPS TIPS CVG Nina Oneof the first Irish contestants in a beat-'em-up surely, and apparently accrued her body building from her father and her akido talents from her mother. Her favourite tipples are milk, tea and whiskey, but not all in the same glass. Her main attributes are her speed and her many fighting techniques. She uses most of the usual punchess and kicks and her speciality is her Three Stage Hunting Combo (after which a kneel kick to a downed opponent gives the ultimate misery): then your opponent's energy goes down by half.

"CVGTV TIPS TEMPEST 2000 Oi Jag owners, look what we've got for you. A whole two pages stuffed full of cheats and tips for some of the top games on your machine. Put your hands together and thank Simon Lucas and Steven Draper from Northamptonshire for putting this lot together... Dagga da, dagga da do do, dagga dah. That's techno for the non-musicians out there and as all Jag owners will testify you don't get much better techno than the fumpin' toons that accompany the blast fest that is Tempest 2000. It's tough going at times though, so here's Simon and Steven with some useful cheats... CRAZY When the game selection menu pops up choose which version of Tempest 2000 you are gong to play as normal. Now, hold down the 1, 4, 7 and * buttons on the numeric keypad and you should hear the 'Excellent!' sample. If everything's groovy then you should find that it's possible to skip levels with ease, simply by putting a grubby finger on the option key and pressing it every time you wish to advance. 7983 JAG TIPS SPECTACULAR DOOM crvene vous Sometimes it's hard being a Jag owner, judging by some of the sorry games gathering dust down at your local games emporium. But hey, loosen that noose, get down off that chair and smile. You've got Doom right? And not just any Doom either, but arguably the best version yet seen on any home machine. Over to S&S for the cheats... Invulnerability: Hold down then press pause. Unpause and your health status face will have become all zombie-like and spooky indicating your invulnerability. All weapons, keys and ammo: Hold down # then press pause to be blessed with an arsenal to make a Middle Easter arms dealer green with envy. Level select: Press buttons 1-9 and then pause for their respective levels. Alternatively... For levels 11-19 press Button A then pause for level 10. For level 20 button B then pause. Buttons A and 1-9 then pause Buttons B and 1-4 then pause for levels 21-24. Level 24 is a secret level and can be found on level 3 as an altemative exit. It's hard to get to without cheating though, and even if you do you'll probably die 'cos it's tougher to tackle than a steroid abusing Rottweiler who's just been dumped by his girlie. Oh, and by the way, don't try and proceed past level 24 unless you're a speccy programmer type as the game will just crash spectacularly. Gore Tippo One: For whizzo fun check out level 23 on nightmare setting and put the invulnerability cheat on. Done that? Good, now walk into the room that is full of Cacodemons (the red things for any non-Doom fiends reading) and stand in the doorway. As they shoot at you, dodge out of the way and watch the Barons of Hell and the Demons pummel the plop out of each other. Top Tippo 2: For a good seeing to right at the start of the game go straight to the left and into the room with four sergeants. Enter both the weapons and invulnerability cheats (you should have selected the Nightmare difficulty setting again ) and kill the two men on the ground and one of the men up the stairs. Go up the stairs keeping the remaining man in the middle of the stairway. Select the BFG 9000 and shoot the bugger at point blank range. The idea is to try and see how far you can make the man fly backwards! With a little practice you should be able to blast him all the way down the stairs! 90 "


"TIPS TIPS CVG ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR BUBSY As Si and Steve say: \"The only reason we included these codes is so that you can finish this pile of festering dung and chuck it in the bin.\" Wise words indeed. Here are the codes: Don't believe what you might have read elsewhere, this is still one of the best Doom-style clones around and a satisfying blast in its own right. Much respek and street-style hand movements from us go out to Steve and Si for this almost unbelievably sexy cheat which somehow manages to make the game even better. Amongst other things this cheat lets you use the smart gun which neither Steve and Si or indeed our good selves here at CVG have managed to find thus far. Anyway enough of the chatter. To access the cheat: LEVEL: 1 1 Start a game. Press pause and switch the cheat on by pressing OPTION and button 6 and then 1+3 together. If you've entered this code correctly then the regular options/save screen should have disappeared. Now enter the marathon second section of this code: OOONOWN 1 1 2 392652 458227 958936 739294 184792 812615 781367 9126712 10 236721 11 673167 12 792323 13 672328 14 782389 15 672345 B, A, 9, A, 9, A, * OPTION 6, #, *, *, OPTION 2, OPTION. If you've done this correctly then the Predator should let rip with one of his scary laughs. Now enter the following codes for these different effects: First of all switch the cheat on by pressing OPTION and 5. Select all weapons by pressing OPTION and 1, 2, 3 or 4. (Marine and Predator only) Select motion tracker by pushing OPTION and 8. Give all weapons a charge of ammo by pressing OPTION and 1-4 simultaneously (this is only necessary once since the ammo bars will replenish themselves each time they reach zero after that). Raise security level by pressing OPTION and 6 and lower it by replacing 6 with a 9. Press OPTION and B and you'll be lowered a level in the base while replacing B with A raises you a level in the base. Don't worry about getting hurt because when your energy bar reaches zero you will not die, unless you've turned the cheat off of course! That is all. JAGUAR HELP! VAL D'ISERE SKIING One of those games you either like or you don't. If you do then try entering this meaty cheat for an extra options screen. Go to the options screen and enter 4,0,8,5,7,4,1,4 and the secret options screen will be yours. We knew that keypad would come in useful one day... If you're the proud (or even not-so-proud) owner of an Atari Jaguar and you have some well useful advice for other Jaguarites then why not write them down and pop them into one of them there envelope type things and send it to: CVG JAG HELP!, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU.

"CVG Gel TIPS 32X AFTERBURNER We would say that James Bray is a bit of a saddie as not only has he gone and got a 32X but also one of the worst games to play on it. The sinner in question is Afterburner but we'll forgive James partly as he sent in this bizarre cheat for the game which goes like this. To enter a test mode press A, C and START on controller 2 when the Sega logo appears at the start of the game. If you've entered the code correctly then you should hear a voice. Now press A, B and C on controller one during the title screen action. Hopefully this will display the original arcade option screen which proves what an accurate conversion this really is.

MEGA-CD EARTHWORM JIM Thought Earthworm Jim was good on cart? Well, of course it is, but Shiny did a sterling job in enhancing it on Mega-CD instead of simply porting it directly across like so many other companies seem happy to do.

So with scant regard for several religious authorities, and running the risk of global devastation at the hands of the undead hordes from the other side, we contacted those who've passed over. But they told us to go away because they where having a nice game of Twister and Dizzy Gillespie was just about to go for a particularly tricky red. After that we gave up trying arcane and unnatural arts, so we asked some fat kid who was rummaging in our skip after the office clear-out to give us a few pointers...
