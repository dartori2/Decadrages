Certain enraged parties claimed the ad hinted at drug abuse. Of course this is all a big mistake, but Sony withdrew the ads anyway. The official response, however, is this: 'The advertising is written in snowboarder parlance and is meant to reflect the adrenaline rush of the sport. This is the language that snowboarders use'. Tony Cormack, our resident skater, vouches the same. SEGA MACHINE FOR NOVEMBER IN JAPAN Japan will have Sega's new 128-bit console in November this year, it is hotly rumoured. The UK, however, will have to wait until September 1999 at the earliest. Nintendo spend $30 million to make sure their biggest games sell in the US! SEGA SPEND $100 MILLION TO LAUNCH NEW MACHINE The main reason for this is obviously due to the time it takes to adapt the system to play on a British format. An additional, but not so hot, reason is that Sega of Japan don't expect that western players will buy the new machine solely on the strength of Virtua Fighter 3. This should be a lesson to all those who rebuked the mighty Fighters Megamix, and other top quality games from AM2 when they appeared on Sega's Saturn. We fully expect games to be first shown sometime in June or July, since we usually see games six months in advance of their being released. It follows that Sega Japan will start publicising the machine around that time. And so the tension begins first shots of the new Sega system's games in five issue's time! NEWS ega of America have announced that they plan to spend $100 million to launch their new console in the US. That's 25 times as much as Sony used to launch PlayStation in the UK, but only three times the amount Nintendo spend to promote their big games in the US. We're hoping Sega won't need to waste any money at all marketing the machine, as it's supposed to be awesome we don't need to be treated like suckers. * "

NINTENDO POCKET L PERIPHS CONFIRMED WINNER elo POCKET PIKACHU Great-looking game. stone DAYTONA 2 HELD BACK Pocket Camera and Pocket Printer could hit the UK in time for summer. Both are for use with Nintendo's Game Boy Pocket, which is still going strong as the only hand-held game console worth owning. With Pocket Camera you can take a photo of someone's face, then mess around with it in a basic art program. There's also a selection of three games: juggling ('Ball'), music mixing, and an old-fashioned shoot 'em up. In the first two cases you can stick your face into the game for a laugh. Pocket Printer allows you to print out whatever it is you've created using Pocket Camera. There's no news as to how out of pocket the new addons will make you, but expect both Pocket Camera and Pocket Printer to cost less than  each. Pocket Monster Virtual Pet, featuring Pikachu the lightning-bolt Pockemon. ega have delayed the arrival of Daytona 2 until later in the year. This is because they want to give Sega Rally 2 a head start. Consequently Daytona 2 was a no show at the world's biggest arcade trade show, the Tokyo AOU. (Report next issue) TPOCKET MONSTER UPDATE [ DUAL SHOCK FOR UK It is now almost certain that the Pocket Monster (Pockemon) animation series will air on British terrestrial TV. According to THE Games, who will handle Pockemon on Game Boy, the cartoon will air sometime in October. This will provide great support for the game which is due to hit in November. Meanwhile in Japan, where the Pockemon craze is growing all the time, Nintendo have just released a Pockemon virtual pet. It's called Pikachu Pet and allows you to concentrate solely on raising the most popular Pockemon in the series. Doubt this will ever happen in the UK, which is probably a relief for most people. Pockemon in general, though, WILL RULE. You'll see. DUAL SHOCK CONTROLLERS + POCKEMON UPDATE Sony are bringing their Dual Shock controllers to the UK in May, to coincide with the release of Gran Turismo. The Dual Shock is a modified version of the vibrating analogue controller which was only available in Japan. It provides various degrees of feedback depending on the situation, similar to how the N64 Rumble Pack works. The tactile response from the new Dual Shock is especially convincing in Sony's race game Gran Turismo, as each car's physics are so different.

"computer Video games NEWS OX LOUISE PRIZES INCREDIBLE NEW MULTI-FORMAT SUIT CONTROLLER! ehold the born-lucky winners of our Louise competition. Or at least we have their names: Alan Jones from Liverpool, and Steven Pettigrew from Airdrie. The fellers both told us that Louise was voted by FHM readers the fourth Sexiest Woman In The World. Since they are quite correct, we're sending them the prize of a shirt signed by Louise. This is only a prototype suit. Vectron say the final one will be made of figure-hugging Lycra. VECTRON powerskipoke Fully-Immersive Joysuit Controller 30 W e've had joysticks, joypads, and now... a joySUIT! Vectron have been developing the PowerSkin 3000XR for more than five years, and have finally revealed a prototype version EXCLUSIVELY to us at CVG! It comes as a whole suit (one size fits all) with sensors all over it. Moving your body in any direction registers in the controller and moves the game on the inside of the high-resolution visor. For example, a fighting game requires YOU to perform the moves you want in the game, and to go faster in a sports simulation you need to run faster on the spot! As well as being an accurate analogue controller, the PowerSkin 3000XR also creates a \"fully-immersive gameplay experience\" by convincing your body that you are IN the game. The headset works in a similar way to standard Virtual Reality visors, with 3D stereo sound to complete ly shut the gamer off from the outside world. Also, the suit has \"glands\" around the inside which can heat up and cool down as the game calls for it, letting the player really FEEL the game! The whole suit rumbles in a driving game, thumps (quite painfully!) when hit in a fighting game and even feels wet if it's raining in the game! Vectron plan to release the PowerSkin 3000XR with a selection of games created especially for it, including Power Swimming 3000XR, Power Bungee 3000XR, Power Wrestling 3000XR, Power Chord 3000XR (a live guitar-playing game!), Power Human Cannonball 3000XR, and Power Battle On The Street 3000XR. Upgrades will be made available to allow you to use your favourite existing games with all the PowerSkin's features. It will be released for PC, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn on the first Wednesday in April for approximately . Full test of the final suit next issue.

Loads of people say that ISS is better but there are many things that FIFA has that ISS doesn't, as are shown below: 1) FIFA has real player names, but ISS doesn't. 2) FIFA has both club and international teams, but ISS only has international. 3) The commentary on FIFA is done by John Motson, Des Lynam and Andy Gray.

"computer video games READ IT AND WEEP COMET STAR LETER I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT ss Dear CVG, I was in my local newsagents when I came across your mag. I was with my girlfriend and she wanted me to buy her a dieting mag. So I did. She's still a lard arse and I've lost  (and that's the only pounds that'll be lost on her), but I did gain a top class mag. Not only do I get the latest on PlayStation, I get the lowdown on other consoles. My subscription is in the post. Paul Jones, Canton, Cardiff. Dear CVG, I'm not sure if this letter will qualify for Mailbag as I'm not bitchin' or moaning about anything and I don't really have any questions. It's just a Thank You to all the guys at CVG for really getting me into gaming. I have owned many machines in the past from my MSX up to my current PlayStation and previously have only really played various platformers and RPG's. The only reason being that I believed driving games to be boring and fighting games shallow. Shoot 'em ups seemed to become too repetitive after R-Type 2. Suddenly, after reading various CVG reviews, previews, guides and tips, I realised what a difference powerslides, advanced combos and perseverance could make to the gaming experience! I had never played a driving game for more than five minutes until I took the plunge and played Rage Racer, likewise WipEout 2097 and Tekken 2. Now I'm eyeing Time Crisis and have picked up a second hand SF2 Turbo for my SNES. B******s to anyone who says a certain genre is crap without have a go, and cheers to CVG for making me spend more cash on games and getting less sleep. Stephen Murison, Aberdeen. Dear CVG, When I found out he jolt pad for the PlayStation wasn't coming out had a great idea of playing Colony Wars with jolt. Firstly, get a mobile phone, put the settings on vibrate and invite a friend over. Attach the mobile to a Sony PlayStation via sellotape. Now play the game and every time you get hit, get your friend to ring the phone and pad will rumble. It may be a delayed reaction, but it's worth it. Naveed Amini, Pudsey, Leeds. Dear CVG, I would like to know who your favourite comedians are? Ashley Trigg, Harlow, Essex. CVG: Sound words indeed. Need we say more? CVG: Paul likes Joe Pasquale, Tom likes Tom O'Connor, Jaime thinks Les Dennis is fantastic, Ed loves Paul Davies (for his jokes that is), Steve goes for the Bobby Davro, Alex has a soft spot for Sooty (it's the only one he can see when he goes to a live show) and Tony doesn't go to see comedians any more since he started heckling at the last venue and didn't actually stop shouting until the next morning. AND FIVE GAMES WIN A CONSOLE Dear CVG, When I saw the results to the Golden Joysticks awards, I had to write about the Best Looking Pages, which was won by Sega Saturn Magazine. Aren't they forgetting Freeplay from your very own CVG? Mark Davies, Deeside, Flintshire. STEVE: As I reviewed both games, I thought it only fair that I reply to this letter. The first three are valid points. And I can understand the frustration for some people at not being able to use their favourite players, but you can rename entire teams in ISS to create your preferred line up. With regard to the camera angles, be honest now. How many do you use regularly? Two, maybe three? All the others are just their for show, and so we can get some decent screenshots. And the last point casts some doubt over the whole letter, as it sounds as though you've never played ISS. You only \"think\" FIFA is better, because you have no idea about ISS 64. You may have some good points, but no leg to stand on if you've never played both. But it seems that Francis is not the only one who feels like this. Anyone else have a comment on FIFA or ISS, please write in. CVG: Always remember: Vote Bog Paper! ending or whatever, in a fit of excitement. SATURDAY SUPERSCORE PS. The X-Men you couldn't identify in your review of X-Men Vs Streetfighter are Dan, Psylocke, Beast, Richtor (in green), Sunspot in Uniform) and Jubilee (I think) in the tank behind Richtor. Rob_Lovatt@senoredd.globalnet.co.uk. CVG: If people don't want us to spoil the games for them, why do we get stacks of calls and letters wanting cheats for games the same day they have come out? We'll be more careful though. Dear CVG, I have a vision! It's called the SuperScore and it can be designed for PlayStation, Saturn or N64 and this is how it works. As you're playing your favourite games, the SuperScore will automatically record your highest scores and best times. You then take your SuperScore to a local computer store (HMV, Comet etc.) and insert the cartridge into a SuperScore Processing Unit. These are networked around the world and your top scores are recorded to a database. You can then check your own scores against all others in the world in a sort of giant league table. Daniel White, London. SPOD BOY WRITES... CVG: Why not send them in to our High Scores instead? THAT'S GONE AND BLOWN IT Dear CVG. I am writing to ask why it is that all computer mags spoil games for their readers? For example the amount of coverage Mario 64 got, everyone knew about the surprises before they got the game. What's the point in striving to get all 120 stars when a magazine has already told you what reward you'll get. I know that you can just skip that section of the magazine but when a big game is coming out it's everywhere and you cannot avoid all of the attention it's getting. All I'm asking is that you tone down your enthusiasm a touch. I like your writing style, it's just when you divulge too much about the plot it's irritating. I recently bought Resident Evil 2 on American import and I am enthralled in it, the preview in your mag did not reveal too much information and I was able to experience the surprises and puzzles for myself. This is what gaming should be like and not just spoiling the Dear CVG, After buying your issue for the first time recently, I am now aware what has kept your mag going through the ages. But it is still far from perfect. Here are my suggestions and gripes: 1) The page of information giving details of your staff and their pictures. Frankly, I don't care who you are or what your favourite games are. I am only interested in your journalism. Do magazines on any other topics give so much detail on their staff? 2) Your style seems a little similar to Official Nintendo Magazine, a magazine I did not enjoy. This may be a result of both EMAP Images influence and Paul Davies' leadership (who, in his opinions in issue 195 seems to possess a notable Nintendo bias). 3) You can be a little bit patronising, telling us what is going to be great before it has even been fully developed or even released. 4) Rating system out of five? Bit simplistic? 5) Don't bother printing readers art. Waste of space. Thanks for listening. CVG is undoubtedly the king of paper based video games mags. Digitiser however, is and always shall be, King. Michael Turpentine, Sussex. LETTERS CVG: Maybe, we could not print our review scores and you have to press 'reveal' to see them. Or maybe, we could just print artwork made from giant pixels. That way you'd feel more at home. And we're usually right about the great games, so sorry about that. Try joining in the excitement for once. PAUL: Correction, Turpentine. I'm one of the only editors in the business who's not biased towards PlayStation. Nintendo deserved the coverage in issue 195. 15 "

Welcome to Raccoon City. update my diary since I came to Raccoon City and my \"dream\" job in the RPD. If I'd have known what was in store, I would never have joined. It turns out that the Chief of Police, Mr Irons, was caught up in something pretty bad. Even though I didn't believe the stories about the S.T.A.R.S team and the mansion in the hills, I now know it's all true. And that Umbrella's experiments were far from finished. My new colleagues have been wiped out, some unfortunately, by me. I've saved the last few humans in the City, but lost a dear friend in the process. All will be revealed once I've escaped, but when that will be is still a mystery... Leon S. Kennedy COP SHOP IN ZOMBIE SCHLOCK HORROR! Ahhh yes those undead-looking folk, and the various mutations they've become. There are some pretty grim sequences depicting the transformation of these enemies, but we won't spoil too many of those for you at this point. Just take a look at the things you'll meet... OOOO ZOMRIES WWW ** MD ** There are five main types of zombie, and you'll encounter subtle variations on them. Like ones that are crawling along the floor, but nothing too major. It may look impressive, but this is the most feeble monster in the game. It attacks you by flapping its wings, causing acidic dust to rise and float about, or bites you! Male Civilian Killing these is simple. It only takes one shotgun or magnum shot and usually four to six handgun bullets before death. Coppers They are practically identical to the Male Civilian, so use the same tactics to kill them. Avoiding them is easy too. ** SPIDERS ** Female Civilian These lovely ladies appear to be slightly weaker than the guys, as three to four handgun shots is enough. For added humour value, the head shot is still tops. Skinned These are nasty sods. Head shots still work, but handguns take double the time to knock 'em down. Trouble is, you meet these when ammo becomes a rarity. Lab Coats Guess where you find these? Again, these are tough so keep some heavy artillery to save you some time once you've found them. The Magnum can take three of them out in one! Much the same as the slightly smaller variations from the first game, but this time they seem to have a lot more intelligence. They'll run up and down the ceilings to get away from your shots and attack from different angles, pinning you into a corner. 16 "


"computer video games IM Playstation TICKERS ** ** DOGS A maximum of two shotgun blasts or five to seven handgun rounds is enough to see these mutts off. Skinned Considering you meet these nasty genetic experiments right at the start of the game, it's no real surprise that they pose big problems to you. With only the handgun at your disposal, they'll take a good ten shots to fell. The boss comes in many different forms, only a few of which are shown here. This will not spoil the game for you, as there are many more goodies to be had once these fellas have been seen off. The further into the game you get, the more mutated, deformed and tougher they become! #1: Long Neck This is one of the weakest boss characters, and should only take seven shots (one box) of the Shotgun to clear the path for you. ** TRIFIDS ** COP SHOP IN ZOMBIE SCHLOCK HORROR! \" 26\" 85 Dark These are even tougher than the skinned variety. Considering a normal Licker takes two Shotgun shots to cripple, these monsters take three shots from the UPGRADED Shotgun! Now that's one tough mutha. Oh, and they usually hunt in groups of three. Watch out for these plants as they gob acid a fair way, so try and attack them from a distance. One to two shotgun blasts is all that's necessary, but watch out for flapping tentacles that rise up and whip you, even if the plants are dead. There are only about eight of these in the whole game. #2: Four Arms Acts in a similar way to Goro from Mortal Kombat should you get too close he will practically pound you and rip you to death. #4: Fire Claw If you have trouble killing this guy, simply avoid him for around two minutes when a Rocket Launcher is given to you for help. 3'23\" 15 *COCKROACHES * ** CROWS ** #3: Claw The clawed guy regularly crops up during the game, injuring you and your party in the process. Takes loads of ammo to kill. #5: Teeth Mutation This nasty set of knashers grows from the chest of the four armed guy! It's not pleasant, and needs at least eight to ten shots to kill. COMING SOON You only meet these briefly, but the sheer number of these vulgar 1 pests means there is no point trying to shoot at them. Just run away as quickly as you can when they start to hatch out and swarm towards you. These come crashing through the windows and try to peck you to death! One shot with any weapon does the trick. Even a knife wound is enough to kill these feathered foes. There is two ways to fend the huge 'Gator. Make him eat the cylinder and explode it with your shotgun or keep on shooting and healing yourself until he runs away. It doesn't matter which you use, but the former is a hell of a lot quicker! "


"computer video FFFFFTOYS FOR THE BOYS (AND GIRLS) VN-AM games Guns, guns, and more guns. That's one of the basic appeals of Resident Evil 2, simply because this game is packed with them. PlayStation RADO WHE HANDGUN The weapon you begin with is standard police issue handgun. Capable of carrying 18 bullets if you're Leon and 13 as Claire. Use this on weak enemies or those already on the ground. SUB MACHINE GUN You find this in the weapon storage room located in the base ment of the Police Station. Once equipped (it takes two inventory slots), hold the trigger and listen to this baby hum! Death to all! GRENADE LAUNCHER Claire's best weapon, and one which has lots of scope. There are three ammo variations: Acid Rounds, Flame Rounds and standard Grenade Rounds. The latter have the widest range. ROCKET LAUNCHER Those familiar with the end of the first game will know exactly what this is for, but everyone else will have to wait until they find it to work it out. Just a little clue though: keep avoiding the final boss for about two minutes... SCHWARZENEGGER BORN FOR THIS COP SHOP IN ZOMBIE SCHLOCK HORROR! SHOTGUN Our favourite weapon in the game has to be the Shotgun. For pure satisfaction of splitting enemies into lots of little pieces, this cannot be beaten. Just wait until you get the attachment as well! FLAMETHROWER Not as essential as in the first game, you only really need to use this on an oil spill to burn a plant which is blocking your way in the corner of a laboratory). Again, this takes two inventory slots. SPARKSHOT An evil looking weapon, and one which fried enemies on the rare occasions that we used it. It knocks enemies to the ground in one to two shots, and kills floored zombies in a single blast. Another twist to the second scenario of both characters is the big guy you see in the pictures with the box. Known only as 'Hunk' at the moment, he is a SWAT character sent from Umbrella to clean up the mess in the city. He's indestructible and follows you around the mansion trying to stop your quest to uncover exactly what's going on. He's an ominous character who doesn't speak, but packs a hefty punch. He holds a significant role further into the game, but that's a secret. For now. MAGNUM Doesn't pack the same kick it did in the first game, but still decapitates zombies in one shot. Even though you won't find it until the latter half of the game, bullets are always in good supply. BOW GUN This is Claire's alternative to the Shotgun, as the guy in the weapon shop carries this at the beginning of the game. It fires three arrows at one time and can hold a maximum of 18. COLT S.A.A. Claire's hidden weapon that, as far as we know, only she can use. It's an old Wild West handgun, which has a tremendous rate of fire and packs a mean punch. It looks the ultimate in cool too! ******* THE DEAL WITH THE DISCS ******* COMING SOON Resident Evil 2 comes on two discs. What you do on one affects the outcome of another. If you play through as Leon, for instance, once you've completed the game you get a saved game for Claire but as her second scenario. In this, the items With a side pack are found in different places I can carry more items. and the story unfolds in a different manner. Likewise, completing Claire's original scenario gives you Leon's 'B' game. There are certain picks ups that cross over between the two games as well. In the locker at the back of the Weapon Storage room is a Side Pack (which adds an extra two spaces to your inventory), and a Sub Machine Gun. When you go to pick one up, you're given a choice. The one you leave stays there for Claire to pick up in the second scenario game. Pick them both up and you'll leave nothing. OUT Do you take both the Sub Machine Gun AND the Side Pack, or leave one so that Claire has it in the second scenario? Hmm? Hunk doesn't follow you through doors as such, but he will smash through solid walls if he feels the need to! 18 "


"* ENHANCE YOUR WEAPON! * *** LEONAND CLAIRE TO WARDROBE! *** computer video games Leon has the advantage of being able to upgrade his three basic weapons during the course of the game. Even though their locations don't immediately reach out and grab you, they're still easy enough to find. To use them, all you have to do is call up your inventory and combine the attachments with the relevant gun. Once that shotgun is beefed up, you're really kicking! The three main pics with this box are all the new costumes for Leon and Claire. Check out the way Leon points his gun now! Yeahhh boyee! PlayStation HANDGUN This shoulder attachment is found in a desk which you need a small key to get into. It offers a small shoulder rest and can fire three quick rounds or be switched back to the single one shot. This didn't really do much for the weapon, to be honest, as we found ourselves switching back to the single shot soon after anyway. It looks nice though. SHOTGUN Yes! This is the Daddy of all weapons! Nothing, and we mean nothing, will make you laugh as much in this game as the first time you use this. It's capable of taking off the head, both arms and a leg of a zombie at close range and sometimes the head of the guy standing behind him! One of the neat secrets in the original Res Evil is that you can change the costumes of the characters. Thing is you have to finish the game first, before you get the special key required. This time you can switch costumes from the very start. We won't reveal how just yet, but have a look at these awesome pictures and you may be able to work it out. Trust us here, this is so cool you won't believe it. Claire not only has a change of costume in the locker, but an old Wild West Colt SAA too (see weapons box for more info). Leon has two changes of outfit. One is a Police baseball style get up and a leather jacket with a skull emblazoned on the back and pair of jeans. To add to these cool outfits, Leon also cocks his gun in a new way. Gone is the two handed grip and in comes a one handed, Boyz in the Hood-esque sideways shot. COP SHOP IN ZOMBIE SCHLOCK HORROR! Will you change your clothes? Yes No Original MAGNUM Despite being called 'Mugnum Attachments' in the American version, this silenced version of the powerful handgun is now a big bad mamma gun. Don't use this with too many zombies around though, as it has an almighty kick back and long reload time, leaving you incredibly vulnerable to attack. Not even the camera is safe! Why maim zombies when you can shoot the screen as well? COMING SOON BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR After much waiting, CVG will be bringing you the extensive review next month. You can probably guess the outcome, but wait until you see some of the stuff we've got to to show you. We have such sights for your eyes! 19 "

The fact that you can manoeuvre in three dimensions and often end up upside down makes this sort of game much trickier to handle than, say, Quake, and in the past these games, excellent though they were, haven't had the same mass appeal. A lot of people are wondering if Forsaken, with it's striking graphic effects and riots-of-laser gameplay, can break the mould and turn this sub-genre into the next big thing. * BIKE-ALIGHT XO FORSAKEN IT'S GONNA LIGHT UP YOUR LIFE! Forsaken is set in the future (no surprises there), after scientific experimentation has laid waste to the Earth, leaving it open to plunder by the galaxy's bounty hunters and scrap merchants. You are one such freebooting scumbag, who has turned up on our abandoned doorstep on the hunt for some free gold, only to find everywhere is crawling with the Imperial Theocracy's robot defenses. Tanks, aircraft, gun turrets they're all determined to keep you from nicking any thing that isn't nailed down. What's worse is that there are other rival bounty hunters roaming around, and they're a tad trickier to deal with than your average dumb-ass robot. Worst of all, though, because the whole planet is condemned, you often find yourself in highly unstable environments. So the trick isn't just to make it out alive. The trick is to make it out alive, before the whole place falls in on your head! > GUNDAMNATION ? Weapons! What do you fancy: Lasers? Chain guns? Charge-up energy cannon? Flame Throwers? Bouncy lasers? Rockets? Mines? Remote drones? You get all those in Forsaken, and more. They're just lying around the place waiting to be picked up, and once you've got them you can increase their power levels by finding the appropriate pick-up. Ooh, baby, the devastation! After a while you can amass quite a collection, but, as in the Descent games, if your bike is destroyed all of your pick-ups are released to float around where you died. If you're quick you can get back and reclaim most of them, but if you're playing a net game the guy who delivered the killing blow has most likely already claimed them. RESTART POSITION ACTIVATED LIGHTSTORM ENTERTAINMENT COMING SOON Though it looks like it's going to be a ripping blaster, what's making Forsaken one of the most talked-about PC games on the Net right now is the awesome 3D graphics. Detailed textures make the environment very convincing and the enemy ships are intricately detailed (between 200 and 800 polygons), but what really sets it off are the spe cial effects. The weapon and explosion effects are what poke you in the eyes when you start playing. They work together with the ambient light to colour the scene, so a rocket's tailfire will illuminate a dark corridor in yellow light as it passes through and glowing lasers light up a room in green. And with so many shots in the air at any one time the overall effect is kaleidoscopic! BULS 35 20 Look out for clusters of floating weapons in a Deathmatch game. They used to be your enemy's! The lighting effects are soo-0-0-0 cool. Some of the ships even have their own headlights! "

ROM PlayStation NINTENDO 64 HIT THE ACCELERATOR Any PC player who hasn't yet shelled out for a 3D card is definitely missing out these days, and Forsaken is one of the best-looking 3D-accelerated PC games we've seen. The PC screenshots on this page were all taken on a machine with an Orchid Righteous 3D installed, but Forsaken provides native support for most popular chipsets, as well as any Direct3D-compatible cards. Already this has become one of those games (like Rage Software's Incoming) that manufacturers use to demonstrate their cards and a right convincing demonstration it is too! M ROCKET-RENDERING SOFTWARE Worried that you don't have a 3D card installed in your PC? Well, keep your pecker up, Johnny, because Probe has perfected a software 3D rendering engine that requires no extra hardware but can provide a display that's nearly as good as that in the hardware-accelerated version, with translucency effects and a nippy frame rate of about 25 fps on a 120MHz Pentium. If you're still not quite up to that spec Probe has put in a copious number of detail-adjusting controls so that you can get things running fast and smooth. Of course, PlayStation owners don't have to worry about any of this because their machine has 3D accleration built in! Ha! Who's laughing now? FORSAKEN IT'S GONNA LIGHT UP YOUR LIFE! GURRA BOLS 1950 Slick alpha channel trickery adds superb coloured lighting effects to solid 3D surroundings. There's even a bit of translucency in there too. Bad DEMONSTRATION'S WHAT YOU NEED sensor We'll be interested to see how well Probe's 3D rendering engine copes with complex high-detail environments full of tanks, ships and bullets. PC players who want to witness the wonder of Forsaken with their own eyes can get hold of a two-level demo from www.acclaim.net. Be warned, though, it's a 14Mb file so it takes a good couple of hours to download, and, unlike the finished game, it only works if you have a 3D accelerator card installed. If you've got the 3D card but no modem, Acclaim is releasing the demo on a CD that you can buy at your local games store for .99. The CD-ROM demo is slightly enhanced over the downloadable file, featuring extra music, sound effects, concept art and movies from the finished game. COMING SOON Oooh. Priddy lights. Never before have you seen such attractive bullets in a video game. Why, they'd be more at home on a nice Christmas tree! CH Only two levels (plus a Deathmatch level), but hey, what do you want for .99? 21 "


"computer video games de PLAYSTATION FORSAKEN ELLS GOLDERS 002 PC ROM The PlayStation demo we saw wasn't as advanced as the PC one. The controls were ropey and the enemies were very easy to defeat. However, as you can see from our pictures, this version did show off the game's spectacular graphics and coloured lighting effects. It also had a more advanced set of levels in it, so we could see how the problem-solving element of the game will work.

BEAMLASER SCATTER cclaim have got Iguana's Middlesborough studio working on the N64 version of Forsaken, which will be slightly different from the other versions. For example, how well you do in the first level actually has an effect on your route through the game. Apparently, if you do well in stage one you're sent through a tougher selection of levels. More important, though, is the inclusion of a split-screen Deathmatch mode, a feature which is fast becoming essential in all N64 blasters.

None of these, however, are platform games until now. IGENTE KLONOA amco, best known in the 90s for their hyper racing games and rave beat 'em ups, have returned to their roots. They've recovered their nack for making great platform games. We're talking cute. We're talking funny. We're talking fluffy animals with attitude fighting the dread forces of evil. Forgive us for getting carried away, but it's been so long. We haven't been able to write about this kind of stuff since the 16-bit days, when almost every game was like Klonoa. Of course the big difference with a PlayStation platform game is that it ought to look much more incredible than any old Mega Drive software. Whether PlayStation can offer platform games with better game-play than 16-bit is another matter. This is where CVG's vast knowledge of the classics comes into full effect. DOOR TO PHANTOMILE SIGHTS TO SAVE PLAYSTATION'S ANSWER TO YOSHI'S STORY This adventure leads Klonoa through the five fantasy lands which exist in the Phantomile world. A save game feature should enable any player to see the final area the Moon Kingdom, Cress with little frustration. This feature also suggests that there are many secrets worth investigating a sign of a good game, especially coming from Namco. We're investigating on your behalf for the review, coming soon. Breezegale The Wind Village Those big ears are used for flapping to steal a few extra inches from a jump. The magic ring sucks the enemy in then inflates it like a balloon. OL10 BOOK Klonoa's hometown, and the starting place for the game. Forlock The Tree Village Captured enemies can be fired off into another enemy, or any other object. Klonoa can also spring board off a captured enemy by jumping on top of it. 10 COMING SOON 42 DE The tree-village introduces the concept of looking into and out of the screen. TEACHING A DOG NEW TRICKS Shell Castle The Kingdom of Jugpot The game is named after its hero, Klonoa. Though Klonoa's looks are based on a cute kind of cat, his abilities mirror those of a US basketball pro. Klonoa depends on his magical ring to perform stunts that are essential to win. All the people from Klonoa's village, Breezegale, can harness the power of the wind to work for them. That's the secret. QUE) Armoured Myus increase the challenge level, but the waterfalls keep you calm. 24 "


"computer video games TM PlayStation Klonoa looks magnificent, and has a character which is brilliant to control. This is the first worthwhile platform game on PlayStation. We think it's better than Pandemonium, more inventive than Crash. SILENCE THE PANDEMONIUM Is Klonoa better than the Pandemonium games? Absolutely! Pandemoniums I and II have cute girls on their side, but Klonoa is far sexier. The world of Phantomile comes to life in a way that makes both Pandemonium games look ill-defined, even dull. Not only does Klonoa look better, but we believe it has superior gameplay. The main character has more interesting abilities, and that appeal is magnified by what is possible once these have been mastered. Crash is cool. This is better. BOSS ENEMIES RAISE THE STAKES 'Boss', or 'Guardian', characters used to be crucial to a game's success. Traditionally the huge Boss or Guardian blocks your way from one location to the nextthey'll try anything to stop you! It's with these guys that game developers really go to town. It's great to be reviewing the latest inventions from one of the world's greatest software houses. PLAYSTATIONS ANSWER TO YOSHI'S STORY This guy is This mutant Rongo-Lango. He penguim boss is tries to break called Pamela. Klonoa's skull, Throw the rider and creates into this dolphin earthquakes monster's face with his claws! to drive it crazy! Za o cao ANOTHER STORY GIVE TO ORA This area is optional, and can only be reached if Klonoa switches the perspective. This issue we review Nintendo's latest platform game, Yoshi's Story. We expect this to have raised the question of how Klonoa compares PlayStation's best shot at matching that ingenious N64 release. For now it's fair to assume that Namco's game will hold its own due to the length of its challenge, as opposed to the localised treasure-hunting approach of Yoshi's Story. In Klonoa the enemies are trickier, and the pitfalls are more frequent. The Boss set-up is a classic example of a linear game doing its best to trip you up; steal a few lives. Yoshi's Story is straightforward. In the end we'll judge Klonoa on how much it invites you to go back and perord fect skills, then how enjoyable Cute versus cute. this is in the long-term. Which is the best? NEAR AND FAR IZZO IZTIROX Take the alternative You need to line-up route here to search Klonoa with this for otherwise unavailNagapoko egg then able treasures. aim toward the screen. COMING SOON Most times you'll find Klonoa only travels from left to right, or vice versa. However there are times when he's required to walk towards or away from you. Doing this forces the entire screen to shift perspective, so that a new route is followed. Being able to face front or back also allows Klonoa to target enemies or objects in those directions. Not all of these situations are forced to take place, so you need to pay attention so as not to miss any opportunities. Coronia and Cress, the last two areas, we'll keep secret. They're too nice to spoil too soon. KILLED BY CUTE While all our hopes have been with Tekken 3 since before Christmas, Klonoa has quietly entered the scene where it may well cause a storm. This gorgeous platform game could be perfect company for blockbusters such as Gran Turismo. Find out whether Klonoa is essential, soon in CVG. 25 "

PlayStation MOTERIM ver since zero gravity racing appeared on the PlayStation, anyIthing with cars felt like driving a tractor in comparison. While we all wait patiently for the realism of Gran Turismo and Sega Rally 2, we could do with another adrenaline boost. Motorhead hopes to bridge that gap. Appearing soon on PlayStation and PC it promises to be the fastest thing around on four wheels. The release schedules may be chock full of every type of vehicle racing imaginable, but after sampling the futuristic thrills that Motorhead provides, we can assure you it's definitely one to watch out for. GUBBCOLA generations ahead NEW SPEED THRILLS HEADING YOUR WAY THE FUTURE IS NOW Welcome to the Transatlantic Speed League. To start the game you're placed in the lowest league with scant few cars to choose from, and only two tracks to race on. Points are awarded for the position you finish in. Place first and you'll receive twelve points, ten for second and so on. Finish the league with enough points to be placed in the top spots and you'll be promoted a league. Here there are two more tracks available and more cars for you to select. In the next league you'll race on the two original tracks, plus the new ones. So subsequent leagues involves racing on more circuits. As computer controlled drivers are also being promoted and relegated along with you, staying around too long in one league becomes increasingly tougher.  Amazing cornering and power sliding a go-go. You'll all be challenging Damon Hill in no time. THESE CARS HANDLE UKE A DREAM Can you feel the excitement from this shot? Probably not, but look how smooth it is. COMING SOON NNNNNNNNNDARSHANES After a few minutes of play it's easy to draw up a few close comparisons with Wipeout. Both are set in the future with the player trying their hardest to progress through increasingly difficult leagues, both are incredibly fast. That's where the comparisons stop, on further play, you'll realise that this game has all the hallmarks of the brilliant Daytona and Sega Rally. Not in terms of graphics, but once behind the wheel, the handling is incredibly similar. Controls are simple but the response is perfection. While the PlayStation already has enough high quality racers to embarrass most other platforms, the likes of Motorhead has never before been enjoyed by dedicated PC owners. After inferior arcade conversions, and lazy ports, this is full of pure arcade-style thrills. 26 Remember to block those pesky tail-gaters. "


"SEGA RALLY 2097 computer video games So how did we draw up this comparison with Sega's best racers. Well the minute you take out the first car available the Adder Mk2, the fact is obvious. Check out the steering, the power sliding and acceleration. The feeling as you throw the car around bends, understeering and braking on hairpins is brilliant. These futuristic cars all have different attributes of handling, acceleration and top speed. Their performances are finely balanced so that each car stands a chance against another from the same league. By the time you work your way up to the powerful Serpent, you will have found a car that suits your style. ROM PlayStation COURSES TO MAKE YOUR WRISTS ACHE The tracks are also well designed, and gain the immediate respect you'll find in the best racers. Within a lap you'll become familiar with each turn and hazard, and by the end of a race you'll want to go back for more. Each new circuit introduces the right amount of increased challenge, and you'll need to improve your skill to do well on each one. There's also a mix of temporary street circuits and purpose built tracks to lend weight to the idea that this is a real futuristic championship your racing in. Set around different countries you'll start in the American desert setting of Red Rock, soon taking in the sites of Greece with the Olympos circuit, and a very European feeling Atlantika. Another tasty treat. Super fast, and polished like a window. We wish this game was real. OLUN NEW SPEED THRILLS HEADING YOUR WAY IT LOOKS BETTER THAN V-RALLY The graphics are as sumptuous as the speed of the game. Each car is made from 300 polygons. On the PC there's the option for 3D cards, but on the PlayStation it's also spectacular running at a smooth 50 frames per second. Both versions allow you to turn off certain graphic options to make the game even faster! The graphical finesse wouldn't mean much without a mean game behind it, and Motorhead is no slouch. The Al of opponents is what the makers are most proud of. Rivals are constantly looking for the right opportunity to overtake, and they don't follow a fixed path. Computer drivers also learn by their mistakes. As you play new tracks and perfect each new circuit you can even load their ghost data, and aim to beat that. Multiplayer is also evident with PlayStation having a two player option. PC owners can compete against seven other human opponents over a LAN network or the internet. Rally style hairpins, sand and palm trees. COMING SOON U 12:53 U: 49: UU START YOUR SOLAR-POWERED ENGINES Do we sound too enthusiastic? Sorry if we do, but Motorhead has taken us a bit by surprise. We'll be bringing you a full review soon, in the meantime we're going back for one more go.  .  This makes a 3D card even more essential. "

Now here's a new challenge are you the greatest dancer? Dance & Rhythm Action TM STAGE 1 lor those that thought PaRappa the Rapper was the beginning and the end of the term Rhythm Action game, think again. Bust A Move is the latest game to be categorised in this strange new genre, and it's seriously different. Similar in idea to PaRappa, but it doesn't feature cute raps. Instead it's a mad dancing contest, with different opponents competing to show each other who's the best. So different is it an idea, that you can't help but stop and give it a go. Indeed, when our copy arrived from Japan Paul ordered everyone to stop working just to prove that theory, and also to dispel the myth that he's got no rhythm and can't dance! MAA DO THE FUNKY PENGUIN THAT'S NEAT, I REALLY LOVE THOSE TIGER FEET THINK I BETTER DANCE NOW The game is structured just like a fighting game. You choose a character, then face off against a series of opponents. Beat all these and then you've got to dance against the bosses, but this makes the action sound too simple. First you've got to learn some rhythm. Each of the different opponents has their own stage and tune for them to dance to. The rhythm of each song is indicated by a flashing green bar placed in the centre of the screen. The flashes correspond to the rhythm of the song, and at the end of the third beat you must input a command for your character to start dancing. Keep it going and you perform Dance Combos! It's these complex moves that make the game more exciting. Once you get a long combo going, you'll get the chance to do a Freeze move, this acts as a final show-off move, that also earns you a little breather for your efforts. The idea of the danceoffs are to impress the judges. While each character is competing against each other the judges are constantly adjusting their scores. This is indicated by the position of the camera. If the dance is tied the camera remains in a central position, when someone's winning the camera will move towards them, sometimes to such an extent that you can't even see the other dancer. At the end of the song whoever's impressed the judges the most wins. Do well and you'll go on to face more dancers. 100 s ! SOBUV Freeze moves impress judges. Pinky likes to hog the camera. Some stages are just bizarre. 8 BEAT STREET, THE KING OF THE BEAT 3 come! COMING SOON HOLD IT NOW ...HIT IT! FREZE The commands are just like you'd find in a fighting game. To start dancing you must press just one button, either a circle or cross. Once your dancer has literally got into the groove of the music, the commands become more complex. The commands then become combinations of direction buttons and always ending with a cross or circle. This cross or circle acts as the final input, and must always be pressed in time with the end of the third beat. Any other command can be pressed before this, but the final command is the most important. Mess up, and your dancer loses the rhythm, then you're back to square one, and you must build the dance up again. If you get the timing right more dancing options become available. With choices of more complex moves. While Bust A Move isn't for every one, those looking for something different, especially club fanatics should seek it out. While this doesn't have an official release yet, if it does get a release here the name is definitely going to change. We'll keep you posted. After a long combo Hamm pulls off a fine freeze move. Once your energy bar is full up, you can humilate your opponents, with special moves. 28 "

BUGGY ith Gran Turismo waiting ominously in the wings, the big question is: do people want this sort of racing game? Obviously, Buggy doesn't pretend to be anything like GT, but when you walk into a shop and see both titles, working out which is more likely to be leaving with you isn't that difficult. Will Gremlin's latest title match up to the promise shown by their other games? On the face of it, Buggy could go either way. GATEWAY TO HEAVEN I WANT MORE THAN THAT MINIATURE RACING HITS THE PLAYSTATION You begin Buggy with only four miniature 'cars' to choose from, but as you progress further into the game and get better as you play, extra vehicles are rewarded. There are a total of sixteen little buggies to race, so you better get good pretty quick if you want to uncover any of the secrets. There are numerous 'alternative' routes to levels too, often dictated by which coloured gate you need to find next. The key to success in Buggy comes in the form of small gates which line the courses you race on. These gates trigger an innovative new system of obtaining power-ups. When a buggy drives through a gate its aerial clips the top and a sequence starts. This sequence is the order in which you are expected to pass through gates to obtain power-ups. In the bottom left of the screen, a series of coloured blocks appear telling you the rest of the sequence, with the final block showing you the end result if all the gates are touched in that order. You can have speed bursts, make your car invincible to cause other cars to spin off and turn into a ghost to enable you to pass through solid objects. COMING SOON AM I BUGGYING YOU? The graphical effects usually accompany your success at passing through the coloured gates. If everything goes according to Gremlin's plan, we should have the finished version of Buggy any day now, so a review will be forthcoming, 30 "

GRAN TURISMO Once again we want to stress the excellence of Gran Turismo's graphics. Just look at them they look almost like Real Life (that thing that interrupts gaming every now and then). The detail on the scenery is excellent and goes off into the distance further than most games do, meaning that things don't pop-up as badly as you'd expect with this much going on. You only need to see the cars in replay mode to see how incredible they are.

"TOTALLY GEAR, MAN! computer video games WITA PlayStation LAE BESAR S BIOCESTOME Slotal Tunis All you budding mechanics will have go mad for Gran Turismo, not just because you get to race expensive cars, but also because you get to fiddle around with their insides. While playing the full-on Gran Turismo Mode you get the chance to buy loads of new parts for your cars maana from the specialist garages. It helps if you know a fair amount about cars, as you'll know exactly what everything does before you buy it otherwise you'll just need to try all the bits out and see what happens. The best thing is that you can upgrade a not-so-good car rather than desperately trying to win enough cash to buy a whole new machine. Once you've upgraded a car to the top level (which makes it loads of times more powerful than usual) you get the chance to buy an all-new body shell. These have extra spoilers and things, as well as cooler paint-jobs and stickers all over them! An upgraded Aston Martin And yes, you can upgrade ANY of the DB7 Volante looks like this! cars in the game like this even all the second-hand ones! On top of that, you can configure just about every little part of your Pride and Joy before a big race to get it spot-on for the upcoming conditions. Most people will feel safer staying well away from the inner workings of their dream machine, instead leaving everything on the original factory settings. Get your 'Vette up to racing standard and it'll look like this! Comite Replay This suped-up Toyota can go round corners at over 350km/h! YOU (DON'T) GOTTA ROLL WITH IT Don't play Gran Turismo expecting to be able to drive an Aston Martin at 100mph into another car and see it shattered into tiny pieces instead you'll merely lose speed and go spinning into a wall, ruining your race chances. This is all due to the very restrictive licensing agreements set up between Sony and the various car manufacturers. As with most games featuring real cars, it's not possible to damage any of the vehicles in Gran Turismo. Neither can you flip or roll the cars. However they can be forced off the ground if you REALLY try hard! You may think that GTs physics would therefore make the cars move unrealistically, as they do in Rage Racer, but that's not true. In fact, the movement of GTs cars is very accurate, especially when seen in the replays. They all have proper suspension which really adds a lot to the realism of the graphics. As the front wheels move around, power slides look particularly good as you slide sideways with full opposite lock! PRE-RACE WARM UPS WITH GRAN TURISMO!

Having made two fairly successful appearances on Nintendo's 16-bit wonder, the team defect to Sony and make one of the few \"old skool RPG's in a long while. Usually, developers won't bother to translate these games from Japanese, which is why we're glad to see companies picking up these titles. And with Alundra sneaking off to Psygnosis, maybe this'll see the end of Japanese-only RPG's. Teepo Atk ONCE UPON A TIME: AP 3 Teepo AP 13 24 HP PASS THE LISTERINE: IT'S BREATH OF FIRE The game begins, rather curiously, in a mining area where two guys have uncovered a creature frozen in ice. After setting the detonators they move away, and the creature is freed. This is where you come in. Taking control of the dragon, you must try and escape from the mine. However, you get caught by the men and locked up in a cage. As they are shipping you to their base, you manage to knock your temporary cage from the carriage and to freedom. As you touch down in Cedar Woods, you somehow transform from a Dragon into a human(!) and are taken to safety by two passers by. You start from their house and the journey has begun.

And as a second bonus, they join your \\t's really simple... Teapo sets the log and party to help you along the way! Steve cuts it....

For instance, if the message 'Reprisal' appears after one of your troops has been hit, they'll hit back with an instant retaliation. 'Critical' means you inflict more than double damage on enemies, 'Influence' appears to be a combination attack with two or more enemies and 'Unmotivate' seemed to make the character uninterested in fighting. Baddies can 'Escape' during a fight to avoid death and by holding L1 when selecting an attack mode, you can charge an opponent and all three attack one after another.

"computer video games 80% COMPLETE PLATFORM GAME BY TRAVELLERS TALES  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY PSYGNOSIS TEL 0151 282 3000 TM PlayStation MAY RELEASE 1 PLAYER layStation PlayStation's first real shot at taking on Mario 64, and winning, with a colourful and cute 3D adventure. e may be small, but he never forgets. Rascal is in deep trouble and it's all because of the evil time overlord Chronon. Rascal was busy creating new tricks on his skateboard, when little green men suddenly showed up. It's all because of his Dad Professor Casper Clockwise, you see he's invented a time machine, and old Chronon's only gone and flicked the switch and thrown the pair of 'em back in time. Now it's up to Rascal to save the day. He grabs his Dad's latest invention, the bubble gun, and high-tails it outta there. The portals of time are about to be busted open. RASCAL WAKKA WAKKA WAKKA GO GET 'EM TIGER BAD BOY, BAD BOY WHAT YOU GONNA DO? Rascal must rescue his father from the evil Chronon by venturing through time. On each level you must help Rascal search for six segments which, when placed together, create a time bubble. This allows Rascal to enter a new level to continue his search. All these levels look amazing rich in colour, with superb lighting effects. Plus the game runs at a super-smooth 50 frames per second. Surely an indication that there's a lot of life left in the PlayStation. Rascal finally meets his match as he goes up against the feared Croc. Who'll win in the battle of the super cute platformers? Our money is on the one in green. We've said before that Rascal is definitely going to give Mario 64 a run for its money in the graphic stakes, and that's no lie. Simply, Rascal looks amazing. While the boy wonder himself may not look too appealing he has some heavyweight talent behind his design. None other than the Jim Henson Creature Workshop were employed to design Rascal, and the main characters in the game. These were the people responsible for Kermit and Miss Piggy from the Muppet Show remember. Levels also load very quickly, though each new room Rascal enters having to be loaded separately. This all happens in a blink of an eye. A MOST EXCELLENT ADVENTURE NOOS INIWOD Very clever them Henson people. Look at that logo on his shirt, it's an egg timer that's comedy. The six levels Rascal explores take in such exotic places as the Wild West, Aztec ruins and Atlantis. The clever part, is that you have to play each of these levels in three different time zones. We're not talking Greenwich Meantime either, we're talking past, present and future. This little jaunt through the sands of time isn't going to be easy! The passage of time has a strange effect on each level, with objects being affected by what is going on around them. For example one level set in a castle is full of soldiers in armour in the past, but in the present the castle has been turned into a museum, and the suits of armour are now on display behind glass. ONE POINT TWENTY ONE GIGAWATTS!!! As Croc has already proved, there's a big enough audience for games of this type on the PlayStation. While Rascal may be aimed at a younger audience in terms of gameplay, in terms of graphical appeal, it looks second to none. He's got his bubble gun at the ready, but first he's gonna choose a door to go through. Excited? 36 "

"computer Video games 3D PLATFORM GAME BY CRYSTAL DYNAMICS 85% COMPLETE  PS AND 3DO VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD RELEASED BY BMG INTERACTIVE TEL 0171 384 7500 TM PlayStation APRIL RELEASE 1 PLAYER PlayStation Everybody's 'favourite Gecko is back. Having read the Mario 64 guidebook, he's trying his hand at a 3D platformer. GEX 2 ow that Mario 64 has amazed everybody, it's fair to say that no other game of that style will have the same knock-me-down-with-a-feather effect. Many of its imitators are using the 3D environment merely as a loose theme rather than it being an integral part of the game. Maybe Gex could be the one to break free from the Mario clone mould. The game follows a similar scenario as the original, in that you leap into various TV worlds and have to locate remotes to get back out. As you can see from the shots, the PS version looks ten times better. Whether it plays as good is another matter. GEX WHO'S BACK? TAILS OF THE UNEXPECTED The camera rotates around to give the best view There are varying amount of remote controls located in each stage. One is the standard red one that lets you escape from the level (you may need more than one of these), the other is a golden controller which you have to do a fair bit of work to get. When you first enter a stage, you have to find 30 pick-ups (carrots, drumsticks, etc). Once that is done, you get an extra life and the collectables change to a second icon. Collect 40 of those, another life is yours and the power ups move onto a third and final item. Collect 50 of those, and you'll be rewarded with the golden 'changer and more levels will open for you. Again, there could be a couple of these to hunt down in the latter and more tougher stages. NOOS NINO GOGGLE BOXES GEX OFF MOI LAND! Locating the small TV sets inside the levels will reward you with other pick ups. The green sets release a small green fly once smashed which, when eaten, gives you one extra paw of energy. The boxes with a chequered flag inside them are a checkpoint so you don't have to restart the level. You can also collect various power up TV's, which turn Gex into a fire lizard who leaves a trail of flames and pinklooking ones which give an extra life. Lovely. With an end of March/beginning of April released pencilled in for Gex 2, the whip-tailed one will be hitting your shops sooner than you think. The CVG jury will be in court next month to pass sentence. Contempt will be punished. The camera icon in the bottom of the screen indicates that you can pan the view around by using the shoulder buttons. It disappears and changes to a cross-like icon when you can't. 38 "

RELEASED BY THE GAMES TEL 01703 653377 NINTENDO 64 Your brain could do with a clear out. It's messed up, unfocused, and losing its shape. Reckon this game could liven it up. USHBS STONY t's time to concentrate hard, and get to the bottom of a major mystery. But, before you do, there's a couple of things to consider. Like, unless you know Nintendo well, you could miss out on the bigger picture. Face value, impressive as it is, isn't the half of it in Yoshi's Story. What you value from a game is also crucial, since there's no 3D driving, shooting, or fighting in Yoshi's Story. This is 2D action all the way. Most of what's so good about Yoshi's Story is a secret. Or it was. WHY THIS ISNTMARIO AND IS IN FACT TOTALLY YOSH SHUS STORY Never heard of Yoshi? It's time you did! This funky, and really famous, character belongs to the Super Mario family tree a long line of totally brilliant platform games. Traditionally a Super Mario-style platform game requires you to guide the hero from one end of a course to the other, left to right, negotiating obstacles and collecting stuff en route to the Goal. You have a time limit too. There are no Goals in Yoshi's Story as such. No time limits either. Instead the idea is to discover the most skilful way to complete a course. You can make this very easy for yourself, or very hard. It's up to you. Before you even start, there's a choice of Story Mode or Trial Mode, of which we'll explain something about for you here. WOBBLE WHILE YOU WORK OG The Rumble Pak works well with Yoshi's Story. Once you're used to the feedback you get from almost any situation, it's almost stranger to play the game without it. A lot of the time the feedback is subtle, with soft vibrations used to describe, say, pushing a box. The contrast makes the heavyduty shake of a Hip-Drop to the ground even more effective. Definitely try Yoshi's Story with the Rumble Pak, as it helps to create the essential involving atmosphere. Ride the propeller platforms and feel the whirring through the controller. REVIEW STORY MODE Complete six stages out of 24 there's a choice of four stages within the six pages of a picture book as you quest to return the Super Peace Tree to Yoshi Island. Eat fruit, find gold coins, destroy enemies. In other words, get fat, get rich, get even! Baby Koopa is the villain. Don't let him make a fool of you! TRIAL MODE Choose any stage from the game and aim to get the highest score make your Yoshi as happy as can be. Yoshis aiming for High Scores can only enter stages in Trial Mode if they've already been completed as part of Story Mode. Otherwise you'd all be cheating and looking at all the best levels first, wouldn't you! Whenever Yoshis Hip-Drop the screen shakes violently. So do your hands! POOOMB! 46 "


"YOSHI FAN computer video games Baby Yoshis do zany things just to get by. They're great to watch. Sometimes better to listen to. Look at this. NINTENDO DOO Collecting melons is tough, as they're well gaurded. Try to knock the band-aid off this weirdo obstacle. Yoshis throw eggs at enemies to score the most points. Sometimes birds replace a Yoshi's eggs! Throw these around too! There are four mid-level bosses. They're all thick. This cloud boss is delicious. So Yoshis just eat him! LOOK AGAN THEN LOOK AGAN Target enemies directly... Finding all the secrets in Yoshi's Story is straightforward work, but you need to know what you're looking for. Here are just some of the clues that require telepathic communication with extra-terrestrials to uncover. Well, almost. NOIS STILISE ...or use the explosion to score a hit. JUST ADD WATER These boxes seem empty, but dump them in the water and a melon appears. So that's where they are! WIZARDS IN A ROW It's tempting to eat these guys, but the trick is to down them with one egg. THAT'S SUSPICIOUS Notice a coin in the middle of nowhere, or a missing piece of fruit? Could be treasure! Jumping up and down on the back of this snake changes direction. WHAT IS IT POCHI? Pochi the dog loses control when he smells hidden stuff. Guaranteed rewards. Yoshis will eat almost anything, but delicious stuff is rare. REVIEW GET OUT! Recognise Lakitu the track steward from Mario Kart 64? You can hijack his cloud and take a ride! MADE FOR EACH OTHER Introduce some boxes to each other, and they vanish to produce two melons. Duck under spikes! 47 "


"computer Video games FRIENDS OF YOSHIS SORTOF SECRET MEGA YOSHIS It's no surprise to find that Yoshis keep some pretty weird company. Nothing is entirely ordinary in this game, which makes each new encounter a surprise. You can try pinching yourself, but this lot are real okay. You're not dreaming. These guys aren't listed in the instruction manual. There's not a hint in the game as to where Black or White Yoshis can be found. Explore, however, and you'll meet up with them fairly soon. These special Yoshis eat almost anything and find it delicious, so present you with the chance of reaching ecstatic scores. INTENDO 64 MR CLOWN Looks like you've discovered a giant Hot Dog! In fact Mr Clown is a balloon-like character, who acts as a platform that can be stretched in all directions. Find the special eggs. They're hidden in tricky areas of the book. TULIP Suck on this and Yoshis are transformed into an egg. In this state they can be catapulted in any direction. Where there's a Tulip, you know there's a secret high in the sky. Whatever you do, don't lose the Yoshi who's towing the secret Yoshi egg! Black, and White Yoshis not only look cool, but they enable you to score, big time. WHITE HEIHO If you lose a Yoshi, make sure to hunt down the White Heiho. Collar him on the Yoshi Select screen and send him away to retrieve your captured buddy. CONSIDER YOURSELF A FRIEND! SUD STORY You can lead a few Yoshis to the end of the game, lose a couple of them along the way (who cares anyway), and defeat Baby Koopa within a couple of hours. That's a terrible prospect for anyone shelling out ! But if you abandon the cause at this stage you're not only letting yourself down by missing the point, you're going to seriously upset the Yoshis. The entire Yoshi's Story set up is geared towards getting a high score, which in the Yoshis' case translates as happiness ratings. We'd like to show you how to make this multi-coloured bunch of baby dinos friends for life! dogo REVIEW CASUAL ACQUAINTENCE You're someone who doesn't want to give Yoshis more of your time than is necessary. Collect any type of fruit. If you discover a Special Heart, great. Maybe pick up some coins too. Don't be fussy over which colour Heiho Yoshis eat. Don't bother jumping on them too tricky. Just get Koopa! 1 MAGIC DRAGON You get to ride two kinds of dragon. The other is a fiery red version which lives in the lava lakes of Koopa's castle. 48 "


"computer Video games NINTENDO It's tense work to keep both Black and White Yoshis until the end. w Black Heihos usually taste foul, but not if you're a black Yoshi. Then they're delicious! CVG OPINION LIKE A BROTHER! Collect only melons! This means sniffing out every last secret, and deciphering all the clues to those beyond a Yoshi's sense of smell. Hip Drop to turn every Heiho into a more delicious colour, and only jump on them or down ones that fly avoid eating them unless you're desperate for eggs. Where there are lots of enemies in one place, explode an egg to down loads at once (the score multiplies). Locate the secret White and Black Yoshis, and take one of them to meet Koopa. LSID STORY First of all Yoshi's Story has some truly special visuals. Likewise wonderful sound effects and music. Much of this is so subtle that you miss the finer details first time around, especially if you're rushing through the game. I got to visit Koopa in much less than half a day. Thing is my curiosity forced me to go further, and when I started to look Yoshi's Story duly opened up to become every bit as special on the inside as I had hoped. Locating every melon and coin raises the challenge 100%, satisfaction levels start to soar. For example Page Two's Super Rail Lift course shifts from easy to extra tricky. So it's enough for very young players to survive each course, defeat the mid-level boss, and upset Koopa at the end. That's the basic story, in which the big guys simply act as interesting full stops. A great player's rewards, however, are recovered from solving a set of 24 ingenious puzzles. If there were more to attempt, this game would have been accepted by all as an All Time Great. Yoshi's Story demands a sense of fun, a bit of cheek, and some daring. You need a stomach for 'Cute' too. If you lack any or all of these qualities maybe you should look elsewhere. Everyone else: JOIN THE PARTY! PAUL DAVIES NICE TO KNOW Start feeding Yoshis the kind of fruit they like best those which are of a similar colour to them. Lucky Fruits, which are chosen at the start of the game, are even better. Since you're trying fairly hard to impress, you should give any melons you find priority. Attempt to collect six of the same fruit in a row to earn some Heart Fruit, and sniff out some secrets. Find all the Special Hearts. Try not to lose any Yoshis, and be careful which one you choose for each stage. REVIEW RATING RATING This game's biggest rewards are reserved for those who stick at it. Though it's a short-lived challenge for players who don't like fuss. "

Vote\" few months after the shockwave, Final Fantasy VII lived up to the hype and proved that a Role Playing Game can be successful outside of Japan. Previously only the strongest RPG's broke free of their country of origin, and when they arrived all that greeted them were a cult band of hardcore. Then Final Fantasy VII showed up, and the rules changed. Perhaps now the RPG assault can begin. The first game to dip its toe into the water is Alundra. Should it do well, Psygnosis promise us there is more to follow-much more. Does Alundra have what it takes to drive such a scene? THE LOST IDOLS THE CANDY COLOURED CLOWN.. Alundra tells the classic story of good versus evil. King Snow has decreed all idol worship must cease. This is a terrible blow for the peaceful people of Inoa. Those that defy this new law are thrown into prison, tortured and killed. Without the idols the people soon lose all artistic inspiration. They also have great trouble sleep ing. Their dreams became haunting nightmares. Without idols, the people find it difficult to pray to their gods. They lose focus, and soon begin to lose faith. To add more misery to the Inoans, strange things start happening around the village. The Inoans' only hope rests with a mysterious tribe known as the Elna. who are said to possess a power which could help. Melzas You makt me laugh, feeble one no one has the power to stop me noul Especially not a miserable human. The Elna have the ability to inhabit peoples subconscious, and travel around their thoughts. Once a person has entered the state of dreaming, an Elna can appear in their dream, and move around freely, becoming an active participant in whatever the person is imagining. By doing this they can even control the outcome. Some say if you were to dream your own death, you would perish in reality. For the Inoans this is no myth, as they will soon suffer dreams of death. Only a true Dreamwalker can save them now.

"05823 FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! computer Video games The battles with the numerous enemy are not turn based, as in Final Fantasy. Instead they are performed like in a platform game, with one simple attack button. The enemy is also visible before they attack, unlike in Final Fantasy, which means you can run past some of the slower creatures. Later in the game Alundra will gain more powerful weapons that can be powered-up before firing. He also learns a little magic based around the four elements. PlayStation 0156 TIME TO GO GARDENING When you are in a village or town you are relatively safe from creatures. Most enemies are encountered travelling around locations, and of course in the various dungeons.

It's terrible... Yay, the end of level boss is history. Now we can go cure some more bad dreams. CVG OPINION IRS Alundra isn't Final Fantasy VII, but that's no bad thing. There are lots of differences, but the main one is a question of scale. Not in terms of game time, 40+ hours, but in diversity and places to travel to. The story and characters aren't as engrossing either, but Alundra is still very good. The puzzles are what really make the game, ranging from obvious, to ones which require the process of elimination, to the bizarre. The difficulty level is also pitched perfectly, with you getting just a bit further each time you play. The story is solid, although not much happens for the first few hours, but like most RPG's you'll soon be completely engrossed until the resolution of the tale. The graphics are simple but effective, possibly bringing a happy tear to nostalgia fans eyes. If you've been bitten by the RPG bug Alundra is certainly worth a look. ALEX HUTALA 0179 @ 01793 REVIEW | RATING RATING V T Water mill Despair Desert Dark Swamp to Tarn's Manor A great RPG, and one to show of the diversity of the genre. It hasn't much in common with Final Fantasy VII, but is a good game in its own right. "

Using state of the art vector graphics, and a novel control system, it was unlike anything else in the arcades at the time. So impressed were the American military that they ordered special editions of the game, so that they could train tank commanders. The concept of the game was simple, set on a desolate planet, it was kill or be killed as enemy tanks scoured the barren landscape searching for you. Since then tank simulations haven't grabbed public attention in the same way as flight simulators. In a bid to inject some new life into the genre Battlezone is back.

The former is a covert organisation that you have been assigned to. The latter is the public face of the space program. Under the NSDF an elite force of engineers and combat personnel will secretly venture into space to gather an alien bio-metal that recently fell to earth amongst a reported meteor shower. The team have been ordered to establish a base on the dark side of the moon in preparation for the expedition.

Use the Sasquatch for a good fair fight. The main role for each army is to defend their scavenger units. These are like huge vacuum cleaners that scour the land for scrap from destroyed vehicles and bio-metal deposits. You must remember your purpose of why you're on these planets in the first place: to reclaim bio-metal. You will be allowed to select and build new units from these deposits, but a fair proportion of bio-metal must be sent back to Earth for the conflict there. AT-STAEECH Houten THUHFOR Deus OOOOOOD The landscapes are large and varied, so you'll need to pick different tanks to benefit on each moon. *RETRIEVE THE ALIEN ARTIFACTS* REVIEW *PATTON IN SPACE* Scientists believe that the bio-metal is debris from a massive alien structure that must have suffered a cataclysmic event. Estimates based on meteor showers place the source object 100 trillion kilometres away when the event happened. The scientists then conclude that bio-metal fragments have passed within the gravitational pull of every other planet in the solar system. Certain planets are more likely to have collected bio-metal debris, due to gravity. Top of the list for candidates is Luna the Earth's moon, with the recent technological leaps made by American scientists provided by the bio-metal, the moon is easily within the NSDF's grasp. Apart from everything being in 3D, the main difference between Battlezone and Command & Conquer. is that you are also in the heart of the battle. Your role is to command your ground forces, but you must also survive enemy encounters along with your troops. You can zoom around each level, and call in your orders, even setting up sentries and cameras in remote positions. Should you take a fatal hit, however, it's game over. 55 "

Certain vehicles can only be built by the larger production vehicles, but nearly everything in the game can be ordered to packup and move, along with your base.

From the opening movie, where the original Battlezone vector graphics are the first thing you see, and then the camera pulls back to reveal that this is your tanks radar. You know you're in for something special. There's just so much going on, that you hardly have time to think. When strategy is an important part of the game, this can make some moments very frantic. Apart from merging 3D and real time strategy game elements, Battlezone isn't doing anything original but it's doing these things very well. The graphics are great, and the enemy Al excellent. Not surprising when you find out that the Interstate *76 and Dark Reign teams also assisted with Battlezone. The main thing to remember, is that you're actually playing a game. Battlezone makes you want to leap forward 20 years to play the game on a machine that can really do the idea justice. Which isn't to say that the game is bad right now far from it, it's just an indication to the total immersion games of the future are bound to offer.

OES AND THERE HE ISN'T! =0 CVG OPINION The game is made with the same engine used for F1 and F1 '97, though you won't find the fancy glowing brake discs in this game. There are some minor differences that players requested since the latest incarnation of the F1 racer. The views are different, with one cockpit view, with the rest being behind the car at various heights. A map is also displayed in the corner of the screen so you can prepare for bends and hairpins well in advance. The cockpit view is considered the preferred choice for experts, as this is the only view, which when selected the map doesn't appear in. Of course Murray Walker's talents aren't involved with this game. Instead famous US commentators Danny Sullivan and Bobby Varsha provide the dual commentary. They're usually pretty scathing about your performance as well. en el cocel For most European players this won't be as immediately appealing a game than F1 '97. but that's just because of our unfamiliarity with the sport. It's obvious that this game has been made to sell to the Americans, it is their sport after all. The dual commentary works better than in F1 \"97, but there's too much repetition, and the map does make learning courses far easier. Of the courses themselves, they're not as famous or memorable as any in the F1 championship. The graphics are also rather weak in places, especially the cockpit view, which looks like it came from a PC racer of five years ago. Overall, this is a competent enough game, but not one to highly recommend in a very heavy field of PlayStation racers. There are a few differences to the F1 game, but overall this is just a quick rehash of that games' engine, and both the F1 games were better than this. Only buy if you're a die-hard racing fan, who is in need of some new courses to test your powers on.

It took on Sony's Total NBA and beat it with fast action, loads of moves, pretty good graphics and a sensible control system. Last year's game was even better, but this year it stinks. It's got terrible presentation with awkward menus, dated graphics and the PAL version is so slow it's like playing underwater. Well, almost. The movement of the characters is poor as well, with loads of players chasing the ball around instead of spreading out, and characters jumping from one animation to the next, looking like they're having a fit. And there are only two trainer squeaks if you're going to have squeaking trainer noises you need more than just two tones of squeak. NBA Pro 98 isn't all that terrible, it's just that there's no reason to play it. Save money and get one of the old NBA In The Zone games nice and cheap instead.

Unfortunately, that appears to be the motto down at Sega Europe's HQ. Panzer Dragoon Saga looks to be the crowning glory. PANZER DRAGOON SAGA ne thing has remained constant durJing the up and down fortunes of the Saturn. The continued quality of the software from Team Andromeda, and more specifically, the Panzer Dragoon series. In terms of visual quality, the Panzer games are unmatched and continually set the pace for others to follow. And it's refreshing to see that they aren't content to rest on their laurels. Instead of just churning out a third game, they have gone back and made an epic title spanning four discs. If this came out on PlayStation, it would fly off the shelves and be hailed as an instant classic. It shows the sign of the times, as this will be lucky to break in the top twenty. But this is awesome. 29/ 440 110/110 HOW LONG HAVE YOU GOT? BATTLE SYSTEM PANZER DRAGOON SAGA Panzer Saga is a huge game. Not only in terms of actual game content the scope you have to customise your dragon, and learn/combine Berserker moves is incredible. What we'll try to do here is give you a brief rundown of the basic mechanics. NECK WEAK 1080/1 080 277/277 - The battle system is the key to success. If you can't kill anything, The there's not much point in playing to green flash be honest. Lets have a look at all shows that of the key elements. one power bar has THREE GAUGE ATTACK charged and The three attack gauges at the you can bottom right of the screen are now attack what the fights are all about. If the enemy. you don't have any energy in So there. those bars, you don't attack. When an enemy is moving around you, the bars charge up but when THE RADAR you begin to reposition yourself The unusual thing about the radar is that the central they stop moving. One bar is all object is the enemy and not yourself. The radar is split that's needed to make an attack, up into four main areas around the enemy, in front of, but the more that are charged, behind and to the left and right. Each of these segments the wider range of possible will have a colour which shows the 'safe' points and high attacks you have available to you. risk areas. If the areas to the left and right of the Edge's gun, the dragons homing creature are black for example, this means that when laser, and item use, all need just your dragon is flying in these areas, it'll one bar. Berserker attacks need only be attacked with the weakest shots. at least two. The green section is a relatively safe area and the enemy is still likely to attack, but HOW TO BEAT YOUR ENEMY the red is a definite no go. Not only are TO THE PUNCH you liable to get the full strength attacks, If yourself and the enemy aren't but also any special moves from the attacking, the chances are that bad guys repertoire. Finally, the bigger you're both 'charging'. If you enemies have a 'weak point'.

Sometimes you as it's known is the best way to have to uncover this weak spot get battles over quickly. before it's exposed. 870/ B70 221/221 STUS BORNA REVIEW 62 "


"computer video games RANKINGS How you perform in battles is detrimental to the speed in which your dragon progresses. You're giving one of five ranks at the end a battle, the quality of which depends on the amount of damage you take according to the standard of the enemy and how many times you reposition yourself. EXCELLENT is the highest ranking, which rewards you with the maximum amount of experience points and more often than not, a bonus item too. GREAT FIGHT is the second best score and gives slightly less Exp points. If you're lucky, an item like Elixer Minor will be your reward too. GOOD FIGHT is nothing more than it says. You hardly ever get rewards in the form of items and the Exp points are average. CLOSE CALL means that not only did you take a fair bit of damage from a weak enemy, but also lost out on a lot of valuable exp points. NARROW ESCAPE is the lowest of the low. You'll be practically dead, can count the Exp on one hand and have to live with the shame. CHANGING THE DRAGOON TILGGENUGE LREAT FIGHT! EXP DYNE DYNE 11EN UBerserk Once you've defeated the first major boss in the game, your dragon will morph into an all new, slightly more powerful version of its former self. Once this happens, you have the chance to customise your beast to whichever standard takes your fancy the most. The classes are the same as the Berserker categories, but with a specific one selected, the dragon becomes more skilled in that area. 17EH GESEN SOOG ENEMY TACTICS The Al on characters is also very impressive. If a craft has a couple of attacks, like one special from the back and one from either side, it'll load up the attack special rear move forcing you to spin to the side where it lets rip with the side attack. If you stay at the rear, you run the risk of being caught by the special attack, which may do less damage, but can leave the dragon stunned or paralysed. NORMAL A normal dragon is average in all attributes, and doesn't excel in any particular field. However, it will learn random Berserker moves from each of the categories so in theory, you could end up with the ultimate beast. SPIRITUAL This dragon will learn the most Berserker techniques, as a huge emphasis is placed on magic. Total Berserker points will increase with a greater speed as well, meaning you can attack more times in a battle. PANZER DRAGOON SAGA The weak spots have been exposed, so shoot the varmits! AGILITY Have a guess what this one is like. The three gauges will refill quicker and the dragon will be quicker at moving away from the enemies strong spots. And the escape spell is a last ditch resort that only this dragon can use. DEFENCE With greater defensive statistics, this dragon will be able to withstand more damage, learn more shield Berserker moves and have more Hit Points. What more could you possibly want than that?  No holds barred. An awesome beast that sacrifices defence for all out gung-ho attack. Has the best short range Berserker moves and an all power laser are par for the course with this big beauty. As you can see from this shot, the graphics and views you get in-flight, are simply incredible. It cannot fail to amaze all onlookers. REVIEW 2684 421 15/16 690/ 990 194/17 439/ 750 190/190 63 "


"computer video games ITEMS BERSERKER ATTACKS SEGA SATURN Throughout the vast worlds in Panzer Dragoon Saga are small pyramid-shaped pods that contain items and powers ups. Simply homing in on one of these pods and firing will cause the pick-up to fly into your goody bag. Most of the time these items are ones that need to be sold in shops, but Elixer Minors and Berserker Minors are vital, as they restore lost HP and BP's. Performing well in a battle will reward you with items (again, most of these are just for selling), and occasionally a gun attachment will head your way. Equip these to increase the power of Edge's laser. These are the magic element of the game, and attacks which really show off the graphical excellence of Panzer. Most Berserker moves need two energy gauges and at least 20 Berserker points to execute them. There are two hidden Berserker classes, one of which is the 'Full-Gauge Class' which 1119 needs all three bars to pull off. These are the Big Daddy attacks. The more levels you increase through the more spells you'll learn, and the class of your dragon also effect the type of spells you have. There are a total of six classes, four of those are earned through experience and the other two are hidden. EXCELLENDE ATTACK CLASS These have a good short range effect, inflicting heavy damage on nearby foes. It will affect all enemies on screen, but the further away they are, the less damage. These are the best dragons for a first choice morphing category. (Dragon is recovering .. The white triangular-pod holds a power up. Lock onto it and fire your laser, and the bonus will come flying back to you. Easy. STATUS DURING FIGHTS If you're unfortunate enough to suffer the full-on attack of an enemy's special move, it's more than likely that the dragon will be injured in the process. The status bar at the bottom of the screen will let you know what sort of condition it's in, with any one of these six categories possible. Using a 'revival' item will cure the effect, but they also disappear once that battle is over. If you can wait that long. SPIRITUAL CLASS Perhaps the best for general carnage, these spells inflict the same amount of hits on every character you're attacking regardless of their location. Oh, and don't expect your dragon to turn green, this was just a nice effect we got after a nasty hit! PANZER DRAGOON SAGA STUN STOP The worst one for the actual This status means that the dragon dragon. While it's stunned, it cannot move at all, but can still cannot fire homing lasers or use use it's weapons. If you're stuck in Berserker attacks, just reposition an enemy's 'power' spot, you can itself. Edge's laser and items can kiss goodbye to your life. be used though.

Cure overall hit points to continuously this one at the last possible drop until cured or death. moment. DEFENCE CLASS These spells are good for dragons that take a bit of a pasting as the bulk of them are of the healing variety. And the good thing is, is that you only need one gauge of your power bar to cast them! That often proves crucial in times of need. 95 1984 SLOW Considering the three gauges are the most important aspect when it comes to attacking, this one should be cured as soon as possible as it slows their refill rate to a crawl. BIND Bind will have you cursing the enemy as it only charges the three gauges up to the first bar! Useless if you want to perform some decent Berserker moves. AGILITY CLASS Agility spells work in a similar way the the Spiritual class in that they effect all the enemies, but are far less powerful. You can also use the spells to escape from strenuous battles while using this class. 15 of your drasen is display & SEPE in the Statis Diselag aret. FULL-GAUGE CLASS and EXTRA CLASS These are the two hidden groups.

Attacks like Heat Breath won't cause you any status damage. REVIEW 75 19 5851155 285 285 The water effects are impressive. You should see them in action. 64 This water beast is one of the toughest enemies you'll meet. You have the choice of leaving settlements in the day or night. "


"NEW AGE TRAVELLER computer video games Once you've conquered a particular land, you can return back to it at any time via the main world map. Leaving a particular settlement will cause you to return to a giant land map, showing all of the major sections you've been in. If you think you've covered everything and yet no new land has appeared to fly though, you should go back to the last land you were in, and talk to all the people again. Many of those tell you where to go, and may even come with you. As you take Gash across the desert, he'll offer advice on any enemies you face, and point you in the right direction should you get lost. SEGA SATURN LART WHO DA DADDY NOW? 2ND OPINION Even on the first disc, the standard of the bosses you meet is pretty amazing. Whether it's chasm-hugging spider beasts, or Sting Ray style floor mutation, all these characters look the epitomy of cool. And this is just the first disc! The weak spot remains the ultimate goal as far as you're concerned with regard to the bosses. Finding this will not only give you something to concentrate on, by also gives you the advantage as the guardian will be striving to get you away from its vulnerable point. Graphically speaking, nothing can touch this game on Saturn even the mighty Panzer Dragoon Zwei falls short compared to the visual majesty this game has. What's even more impressive is the way the graph ical quality increases from one CD to the next. By the time you reach the final disc you're witnessing some of the greatest visual effects seen on any home system. Perhaps the quest and puzzles are too easy, but Panzer games have always been about completing them first and then com pleting them again perfectly... and some of the bonuses once you've done so are astounding. Truly this game is worth buying a Saturn for it's just completely brilliant. RICA HEADBETTER OOHH, THAT LOOKS NICE We cannot mention Panzer without talking about some of the awesome rendered sequences scattered throughout the game. As well as the almost movie length intro at the start, the key plot development sections also have a clip for you to view. We recommend that you watch all of these, as even if you don't care about the plot, they look fantastic. PANZER DRAGOON SAGA 1/48 115/115 CVG OPINION 290 440 110/110 Having written a couple of Coming Soon features on this game, I was finally relieved to just get an English version in the office. Then I could really get into Panzer, and in the time I've been privileged enough to play it, I can say that it's just as good as all the other Panzer games. And then some. The graphics are nothing short of amazing, and still impress even by todays high standards. But it's the way the game plays that makes it another roaring success for Team Andromeda and Sega. The control method has been tweaked almost to perfection and the attacks and enemies all reek of the classic Panzer style that has impressed for so long on the Saturn. I hope Team Andromeda have a development kit for the new Sega machine, because if they still make titles of this quality on the Saturn, the thought of what they could do with even more power at their disposal is frightening. This sequence shows the first time you meet your dragon. He comes to rescue you. LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN Another neat feature of the game, is the ability to look back at every enemy you've killed so far. By pausing the game and selecting the relevant icon, you can view everything that has succumbed under your weight so far. The first group of enemies are billed as mutations, and when you look at them you'll not only get a full range of weight, special attacks and items you'll pick up if your rank is 'excellent', but you also get the actual rank of the battle too! Should you fancy it, you can zoom in and rotate the enemy around as you please.

On the PC! FORMULA 1 sygnosis are responsible for some of the best and most successful PlayStation games ever made. The cream of these have been released on the PC about a year after the original game, though the conversion times are shortening all the while. Formula 1 97 came out on the PlayStation about six months ago, and now we've got the new, enhanced PC version ready for release. Finally a chance to play F1 97 with more than just two players! LOOK! UP IN THE SKY! A BUILDING! POSITION 11/22 Although Formula 1 97 looks almost perfect in still screenshots, there are a few problems when you actually play it. It runs on 3Dfx cards so there are no blocky textures or the like, but it still can judder around occasionally. The most noticeable problem is the pop-up, especially on the Monaco circuit. At one point, a building grows from the top down as you go along one of the straights and really stands out, ruining the effect slightly. Also, the bright colours look a bit garish on 3Dfx, but overall the look of the game is very good. ROAD RAGE We Training Angle ROCG Chapionship FORMULA 1977 The feature of PC Formula 1 97 that will Estoril appeal most to fans of the PlayStation game is the multiplayer mode. You can now get a group of people to play in a single race, each with their own separate machine (just as long as you've got a local network with tons of computers on it...). When you begin a game, players can join in and chat before the race itself starts.

It's got all the features of the PlayStation game, with very different Arcade and Grand Prix modes, all the real courses and racers from last season, and some impressive graphics. The bright colours mean that the game doesn't look as realistic as Ubisoft's Formula 1 Racing Simulation, but it moves quickly and handles well, even when using just the keys. As we mentioned in our PlayStation review, the commentary is great fun for the first few races, then it starts to get a bit annoying, especially Martin Brundle and his repetitive \"You're right there Murray!\" line.

It may not sound like much, but Brahma Force may well surprise you. Ihose of you who have played and liked Gungriffon on the Saturn will take an instant liking to this. It's basically the same formula, in that you control a great hunk of metal and have to shoot things. But it's a lot more involving than that. Power switches need to be found in order to locate the deeper sections of the levels, and with a couple of boosters strapped to your feet, looking both high and low becomes a necessity. Bombing walls is also an option not to be ruled out. You'll get briefings and communications from friends along the way. All this to stop another of those 'Mad Scientists With Virus Outbreak' scenario. BRAHMA FORCE ULI TE000 . IS THAT A GUN IN YOUR POCKET? IN THE INVENTORY BRAHMA FORCE There are two main types of attack you have during the game. There are standard laser shots, of which there are an enormous amount to pick up throughout the levels, and also one of five special attacks. Of course, these are in shorter supply as they do more damage, but are worth making an effort to get. The bomb should be saved, because you'll probably need to blow a wall up with that, but everything else is for use on the enemy. The missile and launcher for bigger enemies if possible. The in-game menu you have is a big advantage. It shows you all of the pick-ups you've collected and tells you their use for the benefit of all those that couldn't be bothered to read the instruction manual. But this is also the place where you can refill your health (called Durability). As soon as your levels reach below half way, you should think about using the power ups, otherwise one rocket from a tougher enemy could send you to robot heaven. Don't try to launch one of your bigger weapons when an enemy is this close. CVG OPINION After the very poor Peak Performance, have to say that I was a little skeptical when it came to JVC's latest release, Brahma Force. While it doesn't push back any boundaries, it's still damn good fun to play and look at. You'd think that the controls for a game of this nature would be really tough and confusing, but this is not the case. In fact, it goes down as a credit to the programmers that all the buttons are in exactly the places you need then to be, so moving the robot is simple. There could have been a few more weapons to satisfy the carnage lovers, but this is a minor gripe. It can be a bit too similar as you get further in, often leaving a feeling of deja-vu which is what ultimately lets this game down. STEVE PAS DOET REVIEW The 'H' shaped object is a weapon pick up. Get the blue droid out of the way first before collecting it. RATING Brahma Force is initially very playable, but slightly too repetitive to be a really good game. What's on offer though, is done well.  "

And yes, it's no good. In fact, it's worse than \"no good\" it's the biggest heap of unspeakables for a very long time. Iznogoud's quest, according to the instruction manual is \"Be Sultan instead of the Sultan!\". In the game it involves jumping on ledges, throwing coins, bombs, and other exciting things at people and animals. It's jerky, badly animated, ugly-looking, boring, sounds rubbish, has awful level design, repetitive enemies, no sense of humour, weapons that all do the same thing, dumb controls, high price tag, and loads more terrible points we can't be bothered to go into. Unfortunately, tat like this is the price we have to pay for the PlayStation's success. Iznogoud is the worst official game there is do the world a favour and destroy every copy you see.

Now the B-man is in a platform spectacular, but everything you know and love about the old games is still included. B-man's new quest is to reach the top of a mountain. There's also a challenge mode, which sees our hero unable to stop jumping. He's enclosed in a narrow stage, and must defeat all the enemies. Due to the size of these levels, things are quite tricky, especially avoiding your own bombs. The Japanese version of the game also has a small Pocket Monster style game, and a mini mailing system which allows you to send messages through your Game Boy. Sadly these two features will probably not be included in the British release. Without these functions, this is still a great portable Bomberman game.

Finally the game being released, but it's easy to see why Capcom weren't happy about it. The biggest problem is that it moves so much slower than the original arcade game, plus most of the animation has been removed. This means that the movement from frame to frame is very noticeable, and the screen judders around when anything interesting happens. Another problem is that X-Men: COTA seems really dated now, especially since Capcom have made four arcade sequels since, one of which (Marvel Super Heroes) is already available on the PlayStation. A casual gamer won't care for X-Men, and arcade fans should either go for Marvel Super Heroes or the Saturn version instead. ED LOMAS DEESS STAD  PRICE .99  ARCADE.

"computer video games ACTION TM PlayStation   MAR RELEASE BY KONAMI 1-4 PLAYERS he idea of Poy Poy is to pick things up and throw them at your opponents. The game really is that simple. The basic rules and controls mean that anyone can play Poy Poy straight away and enjoy it. You just pick up any object in the arena (a rock, crate, missile, or even other player!) then have a choice of throws or a special move which uses power from a bar at the bottom of the screen. Each character has their strengths and weaknesses, and you get a choice of special attack before each round. The game is designed for two or more players, and seems quite pointless when playing against computer characters. With a group of people, Poy Poy is a lot of fun for a limited time. Unfortunately the slow pace and repetitive nature mean that things get a bit dull after a while. A great game to rent.

Anyway, here's Snowboard Kids a poor combination of the two game styles. The races start at the top of a mountain and go downhill, just as you'd expect. But once at the bottom, the racers jump onto a chairlift which takes them back up to the top, ready for the next \"lap\". Also, there are power-ups all the way down the mountain which can be used to speed your racer up or hinder the others, though many of these are pretty useless. The graphics are \"nice\", but the overall game is very average and not worth more than a few hours play. Wait for Snowboarding 1080° instead.

Well, in real life it probably isn't, plus you have that awful disinfectant smell, but in this game saving lives is a barrel of laughs. Theme Hospital plays just like its predecessor Theme Park, but gives you a new challenge, and just a little bit more to do. Once the patients start arriving it's all systems go as you must research new diseases, keep your staff happy, and build new facilities. This may all seem a bit boring, but luckily Theme Hospital has a trick up its sleeve humour, lots of it. This is no real-life simulation, it's fun remember. Patients suffer from bizarre ailments, such as Bloaty Head syndrome, Invisibility, Slack Tongue, and King! Fever where Elvis impersonators flood the wards.

Each level is designed to ensnare R-9 pilots who push their luck too far, and every power-up opportunity is treacherous. Even now the BOSS characters look mean, especially those in R-Type II. Every enemy is super detailed, and require different tactics to defeat. Alongside R-Type I and II, there are files on all the ships, plus there's a demo of the new arcade version which looks a lot like Einhnder, funnily enough.

M vs C has 15 standard characters, and players choose two each to make up a team. As with the rest of Capcom's \"vs\" games you can switch between fighters at any point, as well as teaming them up for super special attacks. Once you've chosen your two fighters you get to pick a Special Partner, almost randomly. A light flickers over the 20 faces at high speed, making it hard to pick your favourite every time. These Special Partners can be used a limited number of times in a fight, and include Sir Arthur from Ghouls N Ghosts, Thor and Jubilee. The graphics are excellent and the new characters fit into the Capcom style beautifully. Venom looks particularly great with its slobbering tongue hanging out all the time. War Machine's a bit of a let down though he's just Iron Man in black and white! There are loads of special moves and combo possibilities, and the final boss, Onslaught, is amazing! By Odin!

"video games KELLY'S HEROESLO Apart from when you're standing at a Zebra Crossing, it's not often you get to stop the London traffic. That is unless you happen to be Kelly Brook. DEATHTRAP Dungeon KELLY BROOK hen we're allowed out of the CVG Battle Base it's usually to go to a rehab clinic or continue our community service. So imagine our great surprise (and hormone overdose) when Deathtrap Dungeon publishers, Eidos, invited us to a photoshoot featuring CVG's favourite babe, Kelly Brook. Those with an eagle eye will recognise Kelly as one of the Fighting Force girls. Her face should also be familiar to those who scour the daily tabloids and mens' lifestyle mags. With a cover appearance on Maxim and a substantial lingerie shoot for Loaded already under her belt, Kelly has also graced the pages of The Sun, Mirror, and Star on regular occasions, and been a guest on the Jack Docherty show. With underwear campaigns for Playtex also sitting in an ever growing portfolio, this is one busy lass. KELLY, YOU DONT HALF GIVE ME A BONE. WHATDO YOU RECKON ED? YOU SHOULD SEE THEVIEW FROM HERE THENI IS THAT THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON OR WHAT7212121 The event takes place at the London Dungeon. When we arrive it becomes immediately apparent what the shoot is about. Dotted around the entrance are a bunch of slimy photographers from the tabloids (not too harsh one of them looks like Tosh from The Bill), and a few Eidos people. We're shuffled into the Dungeon and after much waiting Kelly appears, wearing this outfit. Our chins hit the floor. The shutters whurr and click into action. Soon Kelly is moved outside so there \"is more light for the pictures\", and the builders working next door get an early tea break. Then, as the rubber-necking from the passing traffic escalates to the point of cabbies driving round in circles so as not to miss anything, the shoot is over. Kelly is ushered back to safety from the now substantial crowd of drooling men, and we are left with only our thoughts. That is, until the That's just gratuitous! Fancy photo's arrive in the office! showing game pics as well. Apart from having a lovely woman to look at and a bit of publicity for Deathtrap Dungeon, we wanted to take this opportunity to tell you about Kelly Brook in case you didn't already know of her. Kelly is going to be EVERY WHERE in 1998, and on the evidence of this page, that's no bad thing. 82 "
