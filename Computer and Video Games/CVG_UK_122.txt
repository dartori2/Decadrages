"MEG SPECIAL REPORT WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? We all know that CD (or Compact Disc, to give it it's proper name) is capable of giving music of such high quality it's almost like \"being there.\" But what is CD-ROM? The term stands for Compact Disc Read-Only Memory and it works on a similar basis to ordinary floppy disks, with a couple of important differences. The first is that, unlike floppies, information can only be read from the CD and not written to. The second, most important difference is that a single CD can hold around five hundred times more data than a normal floppy can! What this means is better graphics, more levels and studio quality sound and music making todays games look like Space Invaders in comparison! JOT! HOT! HOT! The phones have been ringing off the hook at the CVG office with calls from would-be MegaCD owners desperate for all the latest on the new machine. What can it do? Does it make the Megadrive better than the Famicom? How much will it cost? When can I get one? The list of questions goes on and on! So without further ado we thought we'd better give you the full lowdown on Sega's wonder machine before all the CVG raprods melt under the heat, so here's PAUL RAND to take the Mega-CD apart and tell you all about it... Standard Megadrive WHAT'S THE CD-ROM? After all the hype and speculation, the Mega-CD is almost upon us. First seen at the Tokyo Toy Show earlier this year, this bulky black box certainly didn't look like the next revolution in console gaming. And anyway, the first attempt at CD-ROMming on consoles the CD unit for the PC Engine was a bit of a lame horse which could do little more than play better quality music and show a snazzy intro. But if what we've heard is anything to go by, the Mega-CD is all set to shape the future of Megadrive gaming well into the Nineties. OFFICIAL UK VERSION RELEASE DATE AUTUMN 1992 CD Extension CPU 12.5MHZ SO HOW FAST IS IT? Sega haven't skimped in the graphics and sound departments either. By adding an extra CPU, running at 12.5MHz, into the structure of the Mega CD, the Megadrive is capable of running 50% fast than normal. What this means in layman's terms is that you Megadrive will be able to handle sprite scaling as seen in coin-op Pitfighter, as well as other amazing graphical effects! Not only that, new chips give the Mega CD true arcade quality synthesised sound. High quality samples can be incorporated into games and, being a CD player, you can lob in that latest music CD when you're not playing Super Sonic The Hedgehog and just lie back and listen! og WHAT DOES IT COST? All this sounds as though it could cost the earth, but in Japan (where the Mega CD is already on sale) it's doing the rounds for the equivalent of around . The official UK version of the machine won't materialise until the Autumn of 1992, with a pricetag somewhere in the region of , but those of you too impatient to wait that long should be able to grab an imported machine at a far-inflated price and no-one yet knows whether grey Mega CD's will be compatible with UK software: you pays your money and you takes your chance! 008 "


"A-CD THE SILVER STAR MEGA-CD VEREICS SIEMEGA-enre WHAT ABOUT THE GAMES? Boasting some outrageously impressive technical specifications, the Mega-CD should be able to reproduce arcadeperfect conversions of some of the dedicated machines currently doing the rounds. There's no reason why top titles like Rad Mobile, G-Loc, Power Drift and any other Sega 3D arcade spectacular shouldn't make it onto the Mega-CD. And when third party publishers start unleashing their wares on the new machine, its software base should explode with perfect arcade conversions aplenty together with original products not seen anywhere else. Imagine sprite-scaled Sonic with almost limitless depth and perfect music 'Cos you can bet your bottom dollar he'll be one of the first Sega super heroes to make his debut on the machine. And how about Streetfighter Il in the comfort of your own home? 12 THE | | CD-ROM. B yx) 01512C NIEWORFIS    WOWA NEGA-CD SC SEUS 4.8888 DOUTGACE P H | | | PE * V = XII UO M EGA-OD be. U staat</ | | | | 20 HCM  HIT 3 *  ( 2 (A-M1 BES 1833 SO WHAT'S THE VERDICT? SEGA'S CD SUPERSTAR If you've ever seen the PC Engine CD-ROM in action, you'll notice that it take ages for each level to load into the machine. That's because the Engine has to clear out the last stage before booting up the next, a process which sometimes takes longer than it would using floppy disks! But clever old Sega have found a way around this waiting time by building six megabits of RAM into the Mega CD, allowing data to be held in the machine while the player is battling away, ready to cross over to the main memory at the speed of light when it's time to do so! As more and more information becomes available, the MegaCD looks better and better, making the Super NES (Famicom) look a tad pale in comparison. However our spies in Japan tell us Nintendo have a few secret projects up their sleeves, one of which should turn the tables on the Mega-CD and put the Famicom slap bang in the centre of the picture yet again. Stay tuned to these very pages for more info the millisecond it comes our way... "

We've had a few goes and this has to be the hottest PC Engine release for ages, it's quite mindblowing.

THE COMPLETE SYSTEM We gave the Amstrad PC5286 all the best features you need for serious business use and great games entertainment. Then we gave it features which were unheard of. As you'd expect, it has state-of-the-art graphics with a 14\" high quality VGA monitor which will display up to 256 colours from a palette of over a quarter of a million Terrific for business applications but all that colour is wasted on games if your sound system comes from the dark ages. So we gave it a sound system that makes it unique. Its fully Ad-Lib' compatible soundcard with its twin external speakers, brings you closer to the action bringing a whole new dimension to the PC. BUILT FOR BUSINESS We gave the PC5286 a massive 1 Mb RAM, 40 Mb hard drive and 1.44 Mb 3.5\" floppy disc drive. If golf isn't your game the Amstrad PC5286 games pack comes with two other great games.

"REVIEW THANKS to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the review cartridge MEGADRIVE .99 BY NAMCOT Vou just can't keep a good terrorist gang I down. Geldra, the fanatical group believed to be destroyed in the original Rolling Thunder mission, is back and this time they mean business! They've been selfishly removing communications satellites from space, thereby crippling the world's telecommunication system. Well, they figured that hijacking a plane wasn't going to get what they wanted, so why not try something a little more spectacular? Time for you to come out of retirement. You thought you'd put all of that shooting criminals with guns lark behind you no such luck. Off you trot on your assignment, with only a stout heart to keep you going (oh yeah, that and a pistol with loads of bullets). Rolling Thunder was no pushover expect an ever harder time now! Khattle gun wondo muodamage PAUSE BOL FIGHT AS A FEMALE The player has the choice to play either the original Rolling Thunder hero or, if he or she so desires, a new female recruit. She's just as hard as her male counterpart and can pack a mean pistol too-she also has impeccable dress sense. as those tight jeans and red blouse demonstrate! Leap down to the next level before that Geldra bloke beats you up! Rolling Thunder is one of my all-time fave arcaders, and this conversion of the fabulous sequel is totally bloody brill From the moment you slap in the cart you know you're in for a treat. The sleek and stylish graphics from the coin-op have been faithfully recreated, together with the colourful backdrops which really make this blast stand out. Music too is dead good: thrilling tunes and great spot effects. Gameplay's what really counts, though, and here RT2 is as near as dammit a replica of the coin-op, with all the addictive brilliance of the arcade classic. As you can see, I love the game and this is a cart I'll probably want to keep forever. Grab yourself a copy and prepare for arcade thrills second to none! TIM BOONE PAUSE M 016 "

There are sub-machine guns to be had, as well as a lethal short-range flame thrower which, when used on baddies, makes a lovely Geldra Fricasee! Rolling Thunder 2 came in sooo late it was doubtful whether we could fit it in. After playing for only a short time, though, we knew there was no way we could miss out on this! It's a totally awesome shoot 'em up, full of excellent graphics and perfect playability. It's also bloody hard too! I've been beavering away all morning and only reached level three and there are ten levels in alll One of the biggest complaints about Megadrive software is that it's too easy to complete. Rolling Thunder 2, however, is one of those rare releases which offer the player a real challenge. I've never seen the coin-op, but, if this conversion is anything to go by, I'll be wending my way down to the local arcade and pleading with the manager to cordon off the RT2 machine and leave me to it for the rest of the day! Beg, borrow (but don't steal 'cos that's bad) the dosh to get Rolling Thunder 2 it's brill! PAUL RAND down with YOU Name-tower! PAUSE ROUNI DON'T GET SHOT, OK? Think you're smart just 'cos you're tooled up and ready to blast those Geldra to oblivion? Don't smile yet, 'cos the enemies are kitted out with guns too and they certainly aren't afraid to use them! A single shot is all it takes to put you out of action, so remember to duck when they fire, otherwise you'll not be doing any more rolling of thunder you'll be shuffling off this mortal coil! 51P2180071 17 TIME HISCORE ROLK1 22400 & TIHE HISCORE MUCHO MISSIONS Your mission is spread across ten massive levels, each packed with Geldra agents.

"REVIEW TEENAGE AMIGA .99 BY IMAGEWORKS ean, mean and back on your screen: they're the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, returning to recreate their staggering success last Christmas with this conversion of the smash coin-op. The heroes in a half-shell Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michealangelo are hot on the trail of the evil Shredder, who has captured ace reporter and Turtle's friend April O'Neill. What takes place is a frantic battle throughout a multitude of scrolling stages, taking on the might of Shredder's personal army, the Foot Clan, as well as his mutant cronies and that Technodrome terror, Krang. After choosing which Turtle to control, the player takes to the streets of New York to hunt out and rescue April, using a variety of ninja skills. It ain't gonna be an easy task, dude, but hey, who ever said a fifteen-year-old mutant amphibian's life was gonna be easy? Cowabunga! MUTANT HERO TURTLES BILLINGTON 9/ SMASH THAT SCENERY! Everything's up for a good kicking in Turtles II even the scenery! Vent your rage upon a parking meter and it breaks, smashing into any enemies in its way. And beating up any passing fire hydrants lets loose a powerful jet of water which cleans up those nasty Foot Clan boys pretty bloody swiftly! Sleto Passi. An The long-awaited conversion of the TMHT coin-op is with us at long lastand it's one hot slice of kickabout action. The programmers haven't taken the path of most arcade converts: Instead of just porting the original's graphics over to computer, they've been completely redrawn from scratch. And believe me, they are impressive, humourous representations of the \"real things\" especially the Turtles themselves, who look at you all wideeyed if you leave them along for too long! The game is quite a bit easier than the coin-op, but that's only because the arcade game was designed simply to eat up all your money. At least this version allows you to play without being killed every other second! The Turtles may not be able to compete with The Simpsons in the plastic figures and T-shirts stakes any longer, but the game is well worth the effort if you want nothing more than a good beat 'em up. PAUL RAND A Give 'em some stick if you want to get ahead! UPDATE You can expect to see the Turtles doing what turtles do on just about every popular machine right about now and Santa's sack is guaranteed to be stuffed full of 'em! "


"REVIEW Filme TURTLES A-PLENTY! As CVG fans will already know, Turtles Il will be smashing its way onto the Nintendo next year. We've already previewed the game and it looks totally fab, so keep those peelers glued to CVG for the full Review just as soon as we can! PLAY AS A PAIR! Although the coin-op featured furious four-player frolics, the computer versions offer only two. Don't worry though, the whole quartet of Leo, Donny, Raf and Mikey are all there to choose from, so you can still select your favourite pizza munching hero! It's thumping turtle action all the way! Uh, ohhere's a bit of bother! Konami's Turtles Il coin-op was one of the greatest machines to grace the arcades in ages, so any conversion which can capture the playability of the original has got to be good. After the rather sad Turtles computer conversions last year I was fearing the worst, but thankfully Imageworks have delivered the goods in fine style! Here's a conversion which does justice to the original, providIng a fine old slash and whack romparama. Graphically the game is excellent: your turtles leap and bound about the screen, dishing out destruction at a fair old lick using a wide variety of moves which are easy to pick up but take a while to master. With so much happening on screen and loads of bad boys to bust up, playability is guaranteed although I'm not too sure about long-term appeal. If you're looking for a faithful Turtles conversion and a decent game in its own right, you won't go far wrong with this. TIM BOONE SEE THE SEQUEL! Available now on video is the sequel to the original TMHT movie, entitled Turtles II The Secret Of The Ooze. This time round the Turtles learn that a cannister of the radioactive gunk which transformed them from ordinary pet turtles has found its way into the hands of the evil Shredder, who plans to create mutants of his own. Se. cret Of The Ooze is even better than the first Turtles film: full of action, with great special effects and a few hilarious gags. It also stars sexy songstress Cathy Dennis and none other than Vanilla Ice, who also created one of the tracks featured in the movie! WICKED WEAPONRY! Not only are these dudes well-versed in the ancient martial art of ninjitsu, thanks to their mentor Splinter, they're also rather handy with their chosen weapons. Raphael swings a mean blade, while the bo is Donatello's preferred armoury. There's never a dull moment when Michaelangelo unleahes his nunchukas, and make sure you hide when Leonardo is around he's one mean mutha with the katana!

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY OCEAN 2N! or blimey! It's got to be one of the hottest games around right now, and we've got it on 16-bit and Nintendol Smash TV will soon be all the rage on Amiga, ST and NES so here we are with a review of both. In the future, when violence and crime run rampant, the masses need to be controlled. How do you keep billions of potential criminals in their homes? Smash TV, that's how! It's the ultimate game show taking violence to the furthest extreme and greed is the name of the game. Alone or together with a friend, compete for cash prizes and gifts, videos, toasters even cars. How do you win these prizes? By murdering thousands of villainous game show assistants. To aid you in this crazed rampage you're equipped with a smart laser gun which can be upgraded as you play. No scrolling, no fancy 3D, no screen rotation just straight blasting. The baddies enter the screen from one of four doorways and there are several different kinds from club wielding thugs to machine-gun toting lunatics. TV in the future is a hell of an experience! N17718 THE ACTION TAKES PLACE IN FRONT OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE AND 15 BRORDCAST LIVE VIA SATELLITE 0015 BONUS RELATED LAFFS As you run around the screen, taking pot-shots at the various baddies, you can earn yourself all kinds of bonus points. There are gold bars strewn around the levels, piles of money to be collected and, best of all, mystery prizes to be picked up. These come wrapped up with a rather nice bow and contain goodies such as VCRs, Toasters (for the special toaster bonus) and sometimes cars. The booty you collect is totalled at the end of each level and this is where those really high scores are earned! 00065040 IDD0601 00298750 0027086 ONE 022 "


"REVIEW 00270061 2 900811 SAD RIP-OFF OF THE YEAR All the smart geezers out there will no doubt realise that Smash TV's interesting plot is a complete rip-off of the Arnie movie, The Running Man. This sad movie had Arnie running around a huge TV studio, trying to win money and bumping off crazed killers for cash and prizes. Sounds more than just a little familiar, eh? Ah, who cares! I loved the original Williams coin-op and looked forward to the conversion with unconcealed glee. How can you go wrong with a concept like this? Well, it's hats off to the boys at Ocean, this game is a little corker. It retains all the features of the original arcade machine, including the double joystick option. With one player, this has to be one of the most frenetic blasts of all time, but with two players, it's quite stupidly enjoyable. The nicest thing about Smash TV is that you don't actually need a brain to play it...just ask Paul Rand. The graphics are fine, with no slow down and the Amiga version retains most of the sampled speech and commentary. Musically, Smash TV is a bit of a dead loss, but who needs tunes when you have this many explosions? All in all, this is a blastfest of incredible proportions. Total carnage...I love it! FRANK O'CONNOR END OF LEVEL ANGST The end of level critters in Smash TV take a hell of a beating. You can shoot them for hours with the piffling little laser you start with and they won't even break sweat. To bump them off, you'll have to get hold of some serious kit. Grenades are nice and scatter as you throw them. Three way fire gives you a nice wide line of fire, but for serious damage, go for the topnotch rocket launcher. 0046040 000701) AMIGA GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILIT LASTABILIT OVERALL 90 "

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY OCEAN It's the phenomenon of the decade. It's mad, it's bad, it's totally rad. It's WWF and it's here at last. Ocean's long awaited license of the massively popular sport has arrived. Monsters of wrestling, like Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior and The British Bulldog are all at your command. The game itself is a fairly straightforward beat em up. Simply choose the character you wish to control and climb into the ring with a very large and dangerous looking bruiser. There are only a few basic moves open to the player, but it's combinations that count. You can punch your opponent or kick him in the goolies, but the only way to beat him is to pin him to the floor. When his energy is low enough, you jump on him and hold him till he gives up! YAT CREDITS 03 SLAMMIN', JAMMIN' AND, ER, RAMMIN'.. Each of the three fighters has a special move. To access this, you grab the opponent and waggle that joystick like crazy to raise a red bar to its maximum. The first player to reach the peak wins the struggle and either slams, throws or throttles the other guy. Hulk Hogan has the best move-piledriving the opponent's head into the canvas with gobsmacking force. Well, after all, what else would you expect from the Hulkster himself... Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior and company at last make it onto the Amiga to cheers from hordes of eager WWF fans and perhaps just a couple of jeers from reviewers like myself who think that more could have been done with license. The representations of the wrestlers are certainly im. pressive big, bold and bright but there should have been more than four to choose from. What about some baddies, like The Undertaker, for instance? A sparse ring doesn't help matters much, but there isn't really a lot you can do with a wrestling ring and at least you can jump over the ropes and hit your opponent with a chair, which is a right good giggle. An annoying tune plays on the title screen, but at least there's some passable grunt 'n' groan effects during the game. What dismayed me most about WWF is the amount of moves. There just aren't enough. Grab the bloke, waggle the joystick to throw him or perform your special move, kick and punch and a couple more and that's about it. No doubt WWF will sell squillions, but don't expecting to be playing much after the Christmas turkey's down to the bones. PAUL RAND CRAZY CORNER CHAOS The corners are no hiding place for weary wrestlers. No bimbos with bottles of lemonade to make you better. Mind you, the corner posts can be very useful. It's possible to climb them and leap onto your enemy, squashing him flat and winding him in the process. This technique is even more brutal when performed on a fallen baddie. Hurrah! 026 "


"REVIEW WRESTLEMANIA What a good old laff this is! WWF is one helluva phenomenon, and luckily Ocean's license does it justice. The two modes of play on offer, Practice and Tournament, are both well handy: in practice mode two players have to knock ten bells out of each other while the tournament mode is a bit special. Here you get to pit your wits and strength against some of the most awesome fighters in the WWF, and that's where the fun really starts! The graphics are fairly smart: nothing spectacular, with a few nice touches here and there. The main sprites are easily recognisable, Hulk Hogan's being particularly cool. Music is good. with a thumping heavy metal intro tune and some smart sound effects. Some might say the gameplay's a bit simplistic, but for my money this is a chuckalicious old laugh and definitely worth a look! FRANK O'CONNOR CREDITS DE GRAPPLE ME GRAPENUTS! If you're the single sad spong who doesn't know what WWF stands for, we might as well tell you. The World Wrestling Federation is not really a sporting body, it's more of an entertainment organisation. WWF matches are only available on Sky TV, but their release on video should make the wrestling hulksters even more popular than they are already and that's saying something! FALLING OUT OF YOUR RING If you get bored with fighting fair inside the ring, jump out and have a go in the aisles. You can pick up a chair and bash your enemy if you're quick enough. You only have twenty seconds of this extra-ring activity, so make it snappy. Anyone left outside the ring after the bell goes gets disqualified. Boo! UPDATE Oooh! WWF should be duckin' and divin' on most 8 and 16-bit computers right about now so everyone can grab a piece of the action. AMIGA GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY LASTABILITY OVERALL 83 "


"NREVIEW FAMICOM $45.00 BY KONAMI imon Belmont, vampire hunter, whipmaster and all round super hero. He's already killed Dracula three times, but the Prince of Darkness just keeps coming back for more. This time the blood-sucking fiend has risen from the grave and returned to his dark and dead mysterious castle. Simon must seek him out and end his neck biting antics once and for all. The game has already seen three incarnations on the NES and one in the arcades (called Haunted Castle). This Famicom version has been long awaited, it was one of the first titles announced for the machine. It's finally here, so what's it like? Well, like the last three versions, it's a scrolling platform beat em up, not unlike Ghouls n' Ghosts. Simon is armed with a whip, which can be used to lash the enemies, or swing across vast chasms. Along the way, he can collect extra weapons and magical potions. The extra weapons can be thrown, so you don't have to get too close for comfort. The weapons include knives, bombs and axes and you can replenish them by collecting hearts. These hearts are hidden inside candles, which also contain other hidden goodies. So, the scene is set for a supernatural romp featuring ghosts, skeletons, vampire bats, killer zombies and all the other fiends you might expect to meet in Sainsbury's of a Saturday afternoon. CASTI o Covaracov Cavana Elle SPINNING SCREEN SURPRISES Quite far into Castlevania, you'll come across some rather groovy effects. The first surprise is the rotating screen of doom. In this bit, you have to use your whip to grab gargoyles heads. When you hang from these ornate statues, the screen begins to rotate in a most alarming fashion. You then let go to land on safe ground when the screen stops turning. A bit further on and things get really weird. It's a bit tricky to explain, but the background starts spinning, while you and the foreground objects remain still. The effect is a bit spooky and makes it really hard to concentrate. This is the nicest use I've seen of the Fammy's special hardware. One to show your pals and no mistake. 28 "


"REVIEW YA avasaya SONOROSLAVOS LEVANIA) VUOVA WOULD YOU LIKE TO SWING ON A SPAR? The whip isn't just used to cream the bad guys with, oh no, it can also be used to swing across gaping holes and bottomless pits. To do this rather neat trick, simple aim the whip at a piece of jutting scenery and keep the button pressed. You can now swing from side to side until you reach safety. Some bits of the various levels are impossible to reach without mastery of this art, so you'd better get practising. COVOA VOR GARLIC Things that make you go hmmm. Castlevania seemed to be just that. We'd all been waiting, pantwetting excitement filled the air as the cart was plugged in. People from all around the building watched as the machine was switched on and then...hmmm. The graphics were nice, the sound was nice and the initial gameplay was well, nice. Nothing outstanding so far. A few levels later and still nothing thrilling. Spookily enough though, after several levels things started hotting up. The graphics improved, the music got creepler and the gameplay improved no end. Later levels feature some absolutely jaw-dropping stuff, like rotating screens and spinning tunnels. End of level baddies just get bigger and scarier and the action gets really Intense. Initial boredom soon turns into bumclenching fun. Phew, what a relief to find that Castlevania is in fact the mega-game we were waiting for. All it takes is a little patience on the completely boring early levels and you're met with rewards aplenty as the game turns into a hot love action extravaganza of zombie whipping larks. Neato. FRANK O'CONNOR "


"REVIEW CASTEVANE POWER AND GLORY As you progress through the game, you might find that your weedy whip just isn't up to it. Fortunately you can power it up. There are three stages of whip power. There's the spacky leather whip, the steel chain whip and the awesome ball and chain whip of doom. Besides these there are throwing weapons to be picked up as well. There's knives, axes, bomb potions and clocks, which freeze time when thrown, stopping the enemy for a short time. YESTERBUUU \"Blimey, this isn't up to much\" was my first thought on plugging in the Castlevania cart-middling graphics, ill-fitting tunes and rather flat gameplay aren't points which make me rush out and buy a game. Then I got a bit further and was pleasantly surprised to find that things got much better. There's an unbelievable rotating tubular effect on level five, for instance, which had me jumping up and down and wanting more. Unfortunately, sonics are as average deeper into the game as they are at the start, which is a pity, but who cares just shout loudly and revel in the whip-cracking action bursting with hidden extras and secret caves just the sort of features which make Famicom owners drool and go silly. Like young Frankie says, so long as you can stand the tedious first couple of levels you'll find there's tons of jolly japes to be had from Castlevania, so pick it up pronto, okay?

A gang of hoodlums have moved in on Capital City, intent on stripping it bare and picking over the bones before moving on to the next unspuspecting town. All would be lost, were it not for the fact that Capital City is the home of three of the hardest blokes ever Duke, Ryu and Billy. They're all rocks, know karate better than Jackie Chan and aren't averse to helping out a city in dire need especially when it's their own!

Being a big bloke on a mission to kill can make your head go a bit funny, so to release some of that pent-up violence there are a number of handy shops dotted around which your fighters can enter and wreck.

Even big-time thickies couldn't fail to recognise that this as a complete rip-off of the alltime great Final Fight!

Thankfully, what Burning Fight also possesses is the same maddening addictive qualities, making this a game to enjoy. There's no Infinite continues supplied here, which is a real boon considering the price you have to pay for the cartridge and, with each level containing enough challenge for the hardest of gamers, this is one beat 'em up you won't finish In a hurry.

As usual, pick your hero from a pack of three and strut your stuft kicking the butt off the bad guys as you stroll the streets looking for trouble. Burning Fight features some great graphics and effects blowing away the bad guys with a six-shooter is so much fun it ought to be banned but it's the playability which really lifts this cart head and shoulders above the rest. With so much to do, so much to see and so many bad guys to kick the crap out of this is a laugh and a half. I can't say this is the best thing I've seen on the Geo (King Of The Monsters still gets that award) but this is one of the best titles you'll find for this incredible console but as usual It's going to cost quite a bit of cash before you can let those fists fly...

"REVIEW VERTER NEO GEO .00 SNK 2_33 GOLD our village has always been a peaceful place to live. No marauding invaders, no wandering monsters, just tranquility and non-violence. That is, until a wicked band of evil forces turned up on your doorstep, intent on trashing the place and causing your people as much grief as possible. A few dices and slices later and the population is halved not very nice to look at but at least the refuse men can get some overtime in. But that's not the point. You can't allow any old group of ugly muthas to just storm in and annihalate your mates. Picking up your sword, it's off into the wide blue yonder to hunt out and destroy the perpetrators of these foul acts. It won't be easy, one man against a legion of terrifying creatures. But hey, life's like that... PLEASE COME 37 GOLD 3740400 107 GOLD PAUSE ECROC Swoj What a rock 'ard cart this is! Crossed Swords is an excellent Neo Geo game, combining marvellous graphics, almost moviequality sound and, the most important factor, a highly addictive challenge. Fans of Dynamite Duke in the arcades will notice that that game uses the same line-drawn effect on your character as in Crossed Swords, so that nothing especially the next enemy attack is left to the imagination. Battling your way through thirteen levels might sound difficult, and it is especially when you find that, unlike previous Neo Geo games which give the player unlimited continues, you're only allowed one extra chance before that dreaded Game Over notice appears and you have to restart from the very beginning! The one small problem with Crossed Swords is the limited number of moves available swinging and thrusting the sword, a couple of magic blasts and two defences may seem a small amount, but get into the action and it's more than adequate. A thoroughly enjoyable hack 'n slash. Don't miss out if you have the cash! PAUL RAND 2. 35 GOLDE MANIC MOVES There's no small amount of monsters to dispose of in Crossed Swords, and not a large amount of moves available to do the job. The player can either swing or thrust with his sword and, if the nasty decides he would like a pop back at you, pushing up or down blocks attacks to the head and body respectively. There's also a super-move pressing the A and B buttons together causes your fighter to enter into superswing mode, flailing your sword about like a maniac and slicing anything in the way! 036 "


"REVIEW PAUSE 19 BEVI GOLD Fast and furious hack 'n slash laffs are the order of (the day with this fabbo cart, which puts you slap bang in the middle of some serious 3D swordplay. Basically, when a 7-foot ugly comes at you with a big club, bad breath and a personality disorder there's only one thing to do: fend off his blows with your shield and hack him to bits with your sword without doing something nasty in your trousers! The gameplay becomes progressively manic as you get further into the game, and It's easy to become lost in the world of big-time fighting. Big bold graphics and some fabulous sound including grunts, groans and the clash of metal against metal all add to the illusion of being there. Initially I found crossed swords an enormous laugh, but after a while its appeal does start to wane so you're definitely best off slamming a few 20 pees into the arcade machine on this one.

"REVIEW NEO GEO  BY SNK legend tells of two brave heroes who banished an evil demon warlord a long time past. Now the bad lad is back, this time bringing vengeance and magic along. Who can save the world this time? Which two heroes are brave enough to rescue us all from the clutches of the twisted supernatural fiend? Ninja Dave and his mate Cowboy Kev, that's who! Yup, the far east meets the wild west in this tale of swords, sorcery and even more swords. Sengoku is a horizontally scrolling beat 'em up which can be played by one or two players. The aim? Stroll along and beat up anything you see! SENGOKU WHO'S YOUR HERO? In Sengoku, both heroes have slightly different abilites and strengths. Ninja Dave is a bit smart at the old one-two kung fu business, while Cowboy Kev much prefers to smack people in the teeth. No messing about here. When things get tricky, both heroes can pick up swords and slash the numerous baddies. Most of the enemy are Japanese historical figures, such as Samurai and Ninja. There are also half naked girlies to beat up so get battling! Another scrolly beat 'em up, but this one's been done with such attention to detail that it really stands out. The graphics throughout are totally gorgeous, with tons of well animated sprites. Backgrounds are slick and brilliantly drawn, giving the game a really weird atmosphere. Musically Sengoku knocks spots off just about everything, especially on level two where you're treated to some authentic Shinto chanting! This game reeks of quality and it's a joy to play. The only question you have to ask is whether you can afford over a hundred quid for one game. If you're a kung-fu fisties fan with oodles of cash you won't go far wrong with this.

Winn MY BIG LITTLE PROBLEM I'M ANGRY, I AM ge Dear YOB, I am 12 years old and my friend and I are both getting a handheld console but we don't know which one to get the Sega Dear YOB, Game Gear or the sexy Lynx 2. That's why we sent you this 'orI don't usually get riled up about things, but I have to get somerible letter, 'cos we knew you would help us with our problem. thing off my chest. I've owned an Amiga for about three years So which one is the best console? Also, why in most shops is and think it's ace. Then the consoles come along and what hapthe Lynx 2 cheaper than the Game Gear? Does this mean that pens? All the big software companies say \"stuff this for a lark, the Game Gear is better or does it mean that Sega are too high let's make cartridges instead of disks and make a ton of money.\" priced? Most people in my school think that because the Game So they all go off and do their Sega and Nintendo games and Gear and Lynx 2 are small they are crap. Do you think they're what happens to the good old Amiga, which incidentally knocks right? spots off most, if not all of these little black boxes? People start STEVEN BURCHETT SMALL ISNT IT talking about its life in terms of months instead of years while I'm Stroud, Glos. forking out more and more money on games which can be, frankly, tripe. IS THAT The software houses just don't have a clue. Not all of them are going to be able to make console games I'd like to see WHY THEY somebody try F19 Stealth Fighter on a Megadrive, for example, CALL ITA Yet the lot of these companies are sitting back doing naff all \"HANDHELD about the situation hoping that Messrs S+N are going to get th making games machines and move on to something else. Well, they're not. In a way I almost feel cheated the software industry is saying: \"Look, you forked out all this cash to keep us in business with computer software, now you have to buy a console to keep playing games while our cash keeps rolling in.\" That's the way things are going, and it's going to have to stop otherwise people like me are going to have to give up our beloved hobby and become fishermen or something. JAMES CARTER Tyne and Wear YOB: Well, there you have it. The sorry side of the software industry, and anyone with any sense just has to agree that YOB: Yep. They're great stinking piles of old jobbies. you make some very good points. One thing which really which is why CVG now has a mega mag devoted entirely to pigs me off right now is the lack of really good new ideas hand-held games. Doh! Honestly, your schoolchums must out there. When was the last time we saw a truly groundbe as thick as trees if they think hand-helds aren't the busi breaking game on home computers? Was Lemmings the ness. Technically the Lynx is better, but there's more soft last one? Anyway, I've decided to make this Star Letter and ware for the Game Gear. The reason the Lynx is cheaper is the  is on it's way. What are you going to do with all that Atari is an anagram of bargain, with some letters added | that lovely cash?

"YOBS I'M THICK, I AM CHRIMBO QUERIES Dear YOB Seeing as you're so fab and groovy, I'd like to ask you some questions: 1. What do you think of the PC Engine? 2. Will Robocop. T2 and Streets of Rage 2 come out on the Megadrive? 3. Can I order Issue One or any of the earlier issues? Thanks SIMON COYLE Co Antrim, N.Ireland YOB: 1. It's the business. 2. No Robo for now. Watch out for Terminator from Virgin. I'd say Streets Of Rage 2 is bound to happen, but no firm plans as yet. 3. Issue One sold out years ago and only big and important people like Tim and Julian are lucky enough to own copies, hidden away in their secret vaults. As for the earlier issues, you can't buy them either because nothing comes before one except zero, which must be the size of your IQ.

Since then, he's started wearing blue dungarees, a bright red cap and he's grown a rather large moustache. Now he's really starting to annoy the family. The reason he bugs my dad is because after all the veggies have grown he runs along the garden, ripping them up and lobbing them at the dog. The plumbing in the house is well and truly knackered if he's not jumping down the loo, his excuse is that he's looking for a warp zone. He's also starting to upset my sister, because whenever he gets the chance he jumps up and down on her pet tortoise. The most embarrassing thing for me has to be whenever we go for a walk in the park together, because as soon as he sees a Fungi he runs up to it shouting \"Don't worry. I'll save you!\" then rips it from the ground and starts hugging it. The thing that annoys my mum, is the fact that she's had to fork out for at least 5 new carpets, cos' bruv keeps throwing fireballs from his hands. The fire brigade come round more than the vicar these days. Anyway. I have to go now, he's spray painted the pet hedgehog blue and started beating it up... ROBERT PARRY Southport, Merseyside Dear YOB I think that CVG is fab and I loved the free hologram on the front of last month's issue. I'm writing because for Christmas I'm thinking of getting a Nintendo Gameboy for my main present. Everybody keeps saying that the games are worth the money and have good graphics, especially \"Mario Swamps.\" would like to know your opinion about it and do you think Nintendo Gameboys are worth the expense? What accessories would you recommend for the Gameboy? HELEN BURCHETT Stroud, Gloucester YOB: Oh dear, oh dear. Some people will do anything for a bit of dosh even dressing up in girlie clothes and pretending to be their own sister. Are you listening, Steven Burchett? Want to know what gave away your cunning ploy? Even girlies with silly names like Helen can't be dumb enough to think there's such a game as Mario Swamps, so it had to be a complete thicko like you.

"ORIGINAL SINS STUPID CUPID Dear YOB, I read with interest your review of Sonic the Hedgehog in the August issue of CVG, particularly the comparison with Super Mario 4 on the Super Famicom. Your review was accurate and considered, but was remiss on the point of originality. When you review games (shoot 'em ups particularly), you quite rightly criticise them for being similar and unoriginal and for not being prepared to expand the genre, as in your review of Fire Mustang in the same issue. But in Sonic's review you failed to point out that its features were quite original and may set a precedent that future games can no longer have square blocks disguised as scenery for platforms and large jumps for difficulty. An opinion on how the two games compared was given and while SMB 4 may be a better game, it certainly isn't very original. Its flat platforms and simple gameplay are derived from previous SMB games and it certainly isn't the first game to feature a ridable fire breathing dragon (eg Golden Axe) or a dual foreground and background playfield (eg the freeway in Revenge Of Shinobi). While some of Sonic's gameplay is derivative (particularly on the Marble Zone), it also features variable slopes and curves, twisting tunnels and 360 degree loops, as well as the rotating bonus level. Why are shoot 'em ups given the acid test on originality and platform games aren't? If the next SMB game is released it will again be derived from the previous SMB games and will you again claim that it's the best platform game? DARREN VAN GEMERT Sydney, Australia YOB: So Sonic is totally original is it? And Mario 4 only has flat platforms, eh? Is everyone in Sydney as stupid as you? There are loads of hills and slopes in Mario 4 and plenty of completely unoriginal bits in Sonic but that doesn't stop it being fab. I think you must be annoyed because there are no Kangaroos or Vegemite sandwich bonuses in Mario 4.1 suppose you'd prefer Sonic the Koala bear, or Super Paul Hogan Brothers. They'd both be dead original, but absolute crap like everything else in Sydney, so go stick an opera house up your bum before I get angry... Dear YOB, I think your magazine smells of old mens knickers. If you had a brain you'd be danger ous, but that's not the point. I am getting right concerned about the lack of girlies in your magazine. It's all pictures of ugly blokes, why can't we have a poster of that girl Yvette. She's really gorgeous. All my friends at school reckon she looks like a model. Every now and then, you could give away Yvette holograms so we can enjoy her unearthly beauty in realistic 3D. The only other sex symbol in CVG is John Billington and even then it's only cos he's got long hair (and lipstick). What do you think? JULIAN MATTHEWS Swindon, Wiltshire YOB: I think you're a stinky Iittle pervert with no more right to walk on God's green Earth than a small and particularly nasty insect. Yvette says she's coming after you with her sausage slicer to castigate you, so you better start singing soprano mate. Mind you, Yvette is a bit of allright, sadly though she's gone off to pastures new on another magazine so you won't be seeing her again. Boo, hoo. SONB LINGTOM MASTER BLASTER Dear YOB. I am writing on behalf of proud Master System owners. Will there be an 8-bit upgrade for the Master System so that it can run Megadrive games? BEN FEE Mitcham, Surrey WHAT A LEMON Dear YOB, I am very unhappy. I recently fed my pet lemon a fish finger and he died, but when the post-mortem came, I found that he'd drowned. May I suggest a word of warning to thousands of fellow lemon owners: don't feed them anything while they're swimming. Please could you send that wonderful 100 quid so that I can give Lemmy a decent burial. By the way, happy Tenth Birthday! Have you seen the new Teradrive? It looks dreamy, know Lemmy would have loved it. JOSH BECK Fulham, London. YOB: I just had to print this it's got to be the crappiest let. ter I've ever seen, which is saying something. PER ADAPTERY telo ohr U THE LIFE OF YOB Dear YOB, Why are you so horrible to readers expressing their views? Was it a bad childhood? Were you a misled teenager? Please, please, please let me hear your life story. Right from when you were a tiny Yobling to your immature adult self. I need a good laff. JONATHON GODDARD Hastings, East Sussex BEN YOB: Nope, but there is talk of a sad spaz adaptor for low quality CVG readers who ask daft questions. This immediately turns any thicky reader into a super-genius, but somehow I think you're beyond all hope. YOB: I was such an ugly baby that when I was born the doctor spanked my mother. I had so many spots and boils that I woke up in the pram one morning and found a blind man reading my face. More next month, if I can be bothered... "

The third and most bizarre is the bubblegum gun. You use this to destroy bricks, barrels or any other obstacle. The fourth and last, is the green plunger. This can be used to shoot flying varmints, these can then be used to catch a ride across otherwise impassable chasms. W hat's white and yellow with a really bad attiV V tude? Donald Duck, that's what. Disney's most fowl (hardy, har, har) tempered creation has just appeared on the Megadrive, hot on the heels of the tragic Fantasia. So far, all the Sega/Disney tie-ins have been scrolling platform games and surprise, surprise, so is this one. The game starts with Donald swooping in from the skies in a plane piloted by his nephews, Huey, Louie, and Dewey. Abandoning their uncle, they soar skywards, leaving him to the mercy of a world filled with cartoon related danger. Donald starts the game with only one weapon, a rubber plunger, like the ones you use to unblock sinks. Not the most devastating weapon ever, but it stops the baddies in their tracks. This plunger can be used in two ways, to throw at the enemy, or if thrown at walls, it sticks and can be used as a kind of trampoline. By jumping and firing, Donald can scale otherwise inaccessible heights. He can collect other weapons, like three-way corn on the cob, or bubble-gum smart bombs, but plungers are neato! Donald can also perform a smart slide of doom, like in Strider (useful for getting under low platforms). So, put on your webbed adventure bootees and seek out the elusive treasure of King Garuzia. TEMIFT Ronald lolololololololo e Donald 00000000 YOU CAN OPEN THIS DOOR IF YOU USE THE HERO KEY.\" EGYPT QUACK ATTACK! Donald is famous for his bad temper and so this game features a temper meter. It's a thin red gauge at the bottom of the screen. To fill this meter, you have to scoff jalapeno peppers. When the meter gets full, Donald has a bit of a frenzy. He puffs and grunts and turns into a whirling ball of fists, feathers and feet. In this state, Donald is totally invincible and can knock over any baddie in his path. Mind you, this power runs out fairly quickly, so be careful how you use it.

"REVIEW IS DONALD A CANNIBAL? Donald has a power meter, which represents how much life force he has left. When it reaches zero, he snuffs it, so to replenish lost energy, you need to collect foodstuffs along the way. One of these foodstuffs is ice cream. Donald loves ice cream and that's all very well. What is suspicious however, is the fact that every now and then, Donald will gorge himself on what looks uncannily like fried chicken...or maybe roast duck! 222222 GREAT geglazen STARRING Donald Ducks 00013501 On first appearance, Quack Shot looked amaz. ing. Smart graphics, brilliant animation and groovy music. We were impressed. Oddly enough though, this first impression soon gave way to sighs of boredom, scuffling feet, chewed fingernails and an irresistible urge to go to the lav. It was just too slow, there wasn't enough going on. Where were the lasers? The bombs? The explosions? Nothing much happens for the first couple of levels, but you then realise that there's a lot more to the game than meets the eye. For a start, you'll find out that there's a real element of adventure, with puzzles to solve and hurdles to overcome. You'll have to deal with other Disney characters on the way, like Goofy (gawrsh!), the nephews, Daisy Duck and worst of all, Big Bad Pete. The treasure hunt leads you right across the globe, from Duckburg USA, to the creepy corners of Transylvania. The graphics and gameplay just get better and better, eventually you'll find yourself completely addicted and all that's required is a bit of perseverance. It turns out that Donald Duck is a top notch bit of Sega related japery. A nice game that needs a lot of patience. FRANK O'CONNOR femper omall Paint's 00000000 SSSSS "


"REVIEW QUACK SHOT QUACK SHOT \"Well this is all very jollylooking\" was my first thought on starting up Quackshot. Graphically the game is beautiful, with a very well-drawn and animated Donald (even though he looks a tad overweight must be too much seed!) and equally impressive non-player sprites and backgrounds. The gameplay also seems quite good too, albeit slightly slow-moving. Spend a while playing and it suddenly dawns on you the Quackshot is still rather sluggish to play. It's rare to see any serious number of baddies on-screen at any one time; in fact, the most difficult part of the proceedings for me wasn't actually to do with the enemies, but jumping from one cable to another in the Duckberg level! This certainly no doubt that this is a very good cartridge and one which I'll be returning to from time to time, but those of you who like their action a little more, well, action-packed, would be well-advised to grab a go of Quackshot before opening that wallet. PAUL RAND QT058001 e GSSSS 0004500 END OF LEVEL ANTICS The end of level baddies in this game, have a rather sinister slant to them. They are difficult to beat, but actually finding them is the hardest part. The Firecat, a dangerous critter indeed, is hidden in a maze of coded doorways. Cracking the code takes ages, but when you do you'll slap yourself for not spotting it earlier. There's also a rather nifty flying fox ride through a bonus filled rooftop landscape.

"REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY SEGA BY SEGA Jumping jeepers! Hot or wot? No sooner have we got our mitts on Megadrive Donald, up he pops on the Master System and we grab that one first as well. What with GO!'s exclusive Game Gear review, we've scooped every single Sega Donald game. Wahoo! THE LUCKY DIME CAPER CAPERE PRESS START BUTTON SUARED2 Donald Duck THE COMPANY U uey, Duey and Louie were so excited: it was their birthday and they were looking forward to some really expensive presents from uncle Scrooge McDuck. So imagine their disappointment when all they received was a dime each. \"Why give us just a dime on our birthday, Uncle?\" quacked Huey, \"After all, we sent off our birthday notes asking for bikes.\" Scrooge sat them down and explained. \"When I was your age, I wanted things like bicycles, trains and toys too. But I received instead a present which was worth more to me than any of those. I was given a single dime, and with that dime I made my fortune.\" The trio were wide-eyed. They took their dimes and stared at them wishfully. Then a crash. A bang. A puff of smoke. From nowhere appeared Magica De Spell. \"T'll have those and the boys,\" she cackled. Taking the dimes, including Scrooge's original coin, she wailed \"With these, I'll soon be the richest person in THE WORLD!\" Another puff of smoke and the room was empty, save for Scrooge and Donald. \"You must rescue the boys, Donald...\" exclaimed Scrooge, \"...and the dimes!\" Without pause for breath, Donald was off in search of his nephews... Donald sorts out the big geezer with frizzy hair! A Donald makes his escape on a turtle's back! THREE DIMES FOR THREE DUCKS Donald's search for Huey, Duey and Louie takes him all over the world. Not only must he find the three boys, spread over three levels, he also needs to hunt out their dimes across a further three stages. After that, it's a case of finding Magica De Spell, knocking her about a bit and retrieving Scrooge McDuck's original lucky coin. All in a day's work for a duck. 054 "


"REVIEW WATER OFF A DUCK'S BACK Ducks can take to water as well as they can potter about on land, and Donald is no exception. If he falls into water the action switches to a swimming section where Don must paddle to the next opening, dodging falling stalactites and duck-ea. ting fish! DUCKY FUZZ The baddies which Donald Duck encounters across the world are many and varied. From dancing mushrooms and floating crabs, to boulder-tossing birds and murderous moles! Most of these critters can be laid to rest simply by jumping on their heads, but some need to be hit with a weapon and others can't be destroyed at all! Eek! It's the attack of the flying piranhas! Strange things are afoot as Donal leaps through the woods DIG UP THOSE DISNEY DELIGHTS This is the first console game to star Donald Duck. Other Disney treats to be had courtesy of Mr Sega are Mickey Mouse Castle Of Illusion which is absolutely brill and stars our Mickey in a world full of danger and large cakes, and Fantasia, again featuring everyone's fave rodent in a looks-good-playsawful representation of the animated feature film, available for a short time on sellthru video First we had Mickey Mouse in Castle Of Illusion, which was a smashing piece of platform japery. Now Sega have graced us with probably the next most popular Disney character after young Michael, and his game is equally brill. The Lucky Dime Caper is platform perfection in a cartridge: chock-full of playability and rounded off with beautiful graphics. Donald himself is the spitting Image of his cartoon self. He waddles about, sways when he's standing still he even starts to stamp his foot and get into a seething rage if he's left to wait for too long! Jolly, tinkly music gets the player dancing in his seat and, even though sound effects are few and far between, they too are quite admirable. The game itself is an absolute treat, difficult but not frustratingly So, with lots of tricky bits like disappearing walkways and the like. I think The Lucky Dime Caper is an excellent game, maybe even better than Castle Of Illusion and that takes some beating. PAUL RAND "


"REVIEW OF COURSE, One of Donald's angry relatives shows up to cause trouble! Hooray! Donald Duck on the Master System is a super-skillfull laff chock-abloc full of the thrills 'n' spills we've come to expect from Sega's Disney licenses. Everybody's favourite little quacker had his work cut out to compete with Castle Of Illusion (but not the oh-so-sad Fantasia) and thankfully Sega have turned in a totally fab cart which really does Disney justice. Bright, bold and colourful graphics are the order of the day here, with jolly tunes and wonderful spot effects to add to the illusion that you're taking part in a cartoon. Donald's a nifty little character too, finely tuned so that controlling him is an absolute joy. And with so much to see and do, the urge to keep exploring will keep you playing until the wee small hours. I loved Donald on the Megadrive and whilst this is a completely different style of game it's a laff all of its own. Buy this if you're looking for Disney delights or just one helluva good game. TIM BOONE DONALD'S FILMIC FROLICS Not only has Donald and his cronies appeared in cartoons a plenty, they've also starred in an animated feature film! Secret Of The Lost Lamp saw the Duck family cavorting around the world in all sorts of magic lamp-related shenanigans. It's an enjoyable cartoon film, great to keep the kids quiet on a Saturday morning and it should be in your local vid store NOW! IME A That wasp packs a mighty sting so run for it!

"REVIEW S880 AMIGA ETBA BY MICROPROSE 11 frank (7) LAST SHOT Shot Hit: Finished: 22 ya rab your clubs, pack your balls and head out onto the course for a few rounds with Microprose Golf. The flight sim surpemos have taken a shot at the gentle game and touched down with a realistic simulation of all the thrills 'n' spills of golfstyle malarkey on 16-bit machines. The game follows the same format as most others, but strives hard to be as realistic as possible. Visit courses in various countries and compete against friends, or against the computer. With loads of options to choose from, both in practice and competition, you can play a tournament against a load of top golfing heroes or play for points against your pal. With tons of holes to conquer, it's going to be quite a while before you've finally beaten this! IN THE DRINK One of the annoying aspects of Microprose Golf is the sheer amount of water on the course. It seems like every couple of yards there's a lake or a river. If you do land in the drink, you get a penalty shot taken away as well as having to retake the shot from the nearest bank. Watch out for bunkers too, landing in sand can be a costly experience... MICROPOS (0) Hole OC TO FLS o al 201 ydis od yich PLAY FOR YOUR SKIN The most fun and most directly competitive aspect of Microprose Golf is playing for \"skins\". Professional golfers have been doing this for years. It's a simple prize, usually cash, waiting at the end of each hole for the golfer with the best score. If the tally is equal, the prize is shared between the players. Prizes in real life \"skins\" have included Ferraris, houses, even a helicopter. Rumour has it that a couple of millionaires once played for Issue One of CVG... After the success of the incredible PGA Tour Golf, you'd think that software companies would just give up on golf games forever. Oh no! Microprose reckon they can at least equal the mighty PGA and they're not far wrong! OK, this game isn't quite as slick or smooth as PGA, but it's got tons of options that PGA never had. The polygon course are well defined and they move smoothly enough with a host of camera viewpoints allowing you to view those smart shots from any angle. Sound is almost completely lacking, though: a standard whoosh and thunk for the swing and a jaunty plonk when you hole the ball. There's certainly a lot of variety and the game takes on a new light with more than one player (you can have up to four). All in all this is a slick rendition of a great theme and even lucky PGA owners would do well to check this out for more golfing greatness. fransk Holts of Tafla Ciutas ca 201 yds wood 200 yds FRANK O'CONNOR frank Hole 91 264) To Flag 93 yos Pitch Wedge 90 yds UPDATE ST owners out there have been swinging away with Microprose Golf for a little while, and PC players are next on the list.

"24JIL REVIEW CARDIAXX LIFE IN THE FAST LANE AMIGA .99 BY ELECTRONIC 200 TWO-WAY SUPER SCROLL Unlike most shoot 'em ups these days which scroll from right to left. Cardiaxx features Defender-style bi-directional scrolling, which allows the player to turn round and blast any sneaky baddies which may be behind you. Smart, eh? orget the Death Star the most destructive weapon in the universe is the Cardiac Beam. Capable of eliminating whole galaxies with a single blast, the beam is the toast of the Cardiaxx Empire. So guess which plonker has volunteered to jump into the cockpit of his piddling little starfighter and go up against the might of the Empire to ultimately defeat this vile scourge and smash their toy to a squillion bits of metal? That's right matey, it's you! Luckily, help is at hand in the shape of an array of computer systems which can plot the precise position of enemy craft and give you an audible warning, not to mention a prototype weapons retrieval system which allows you to pick up the armaments from other ships and bolt them onto your own. It's still a tall order, one man versus a battalion, but think of the free drinks you'll get if you succeed! This guy is tough! Watch out for homing missiles. Three-way blasting action! A A wall of swirling asteroids blocks your path! A No light at the end of the tunnel! The first thing you notice about Cardiaxx is the speed. This is one blindingly fast game, made even more difficult by the fact that you have to travel in both directions to complete each level not an easy task when there are bullets shooting around willy-nilly and you've got one unit of energy left! Cardiaxx's graphics are fairly disappointing: the black backgrounds are a total cop-out, although I suppose they help to keep the speed up. The rest of the backdrops and, indeed, the sprites, aren't the most dynamic ever seen either. Sound is great all-round, from the hypnotic intro ditty and heavy metal in-game track to the robotic speech and gun effects (which are apparently taken from an Uzi 9mm). But it's the game which I love; hard, fast and dangerous, like a good shoot'em up should be. Nancy boys need not apply! SOUNDS TERRIFIC One of the mostopne features of Cardiaxxis e sound. A stunning. Guns Roses-style track plays throughout the game, but what's better is the speech, telling you from which way the enemies are approaching, when bonuses have been received, and all sorts of similar info. A Eat plutonium death space fiend! 80 UPDATE No more versions for you, boyo, 'cos none are in the pipelline. Sorry. GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABLY 84 LASTABILITY 84 OVERALL BE PAUL RAND "

"b d Rock Awwww FOOTBALL CRAZY AMIGA 97% ANCO ST 96% Lucky Amiga and ST owners are in for a footballing feast courtesy of Anco, who have lobbed Kick Off 2 and The Final Whistle data disk together AND thrown Player Manager into the package! Dubbed Football Crazy, you'd have to be nuts to miss out on possibly the best compilation around this Christmas. The best footy game ever, the best footy management game ever and a great add-on disk to make the best even better. Don't ponder buy. THE CAPCOM COLLECTION AMIGA 88% US GOLD ST 86% US Gold brings together seven Capcom coin-op conversions and an original game in one package in the form of the unsurprisingly titled Capcom Collection. Ghouls and Ghosts, LED Storm, Forgotten Worlds and UN Squadron are the best of the bunch, with Last Duel, Dynasty Wars and Striders 1 and 2 bringing up the rear. Arcade addicts should get their fill over the festive season with this package. AC Santa's sack stuffed full of all sorts of RIKEY! With Christmas all around us and software surprises, you lot will want to know what's hot and what's not when it comes to Crimbo compilation packs. PAUL RAND gets all festive, puts on his big black boots and silly white beard and stomps through the lot. Ho Ho Ho! LOTUS ESPRIT CHALLENGE AIR/SEA SUPREMACY AMIGA 92% ST 90% UBI SOFT PC 91% Four best-selling simulations and an above-average shoot 'em up make up Ubi Soft's offering for the Binky Hetherington's amongst you. Gunship, Silent Service, Carrier Command and Firebird's WWII blaster P-47 Thunderbolt appear on all three packages. F15 Strike Eagle also features on the ST and PC compilations, its place in the Amiga box being occupied by Cinema ware's excellent biplane flyer, Wings. A superb package although P47 is totally out of place. 4 WHEEL DRIVE AMIGA 89% GREMLIN ST 89% Gremlin have produced some cracking driving games in their time, four of which have trundled onto the 4 Wheel Drive compilation. Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge and Team Suzuki are undoubtedly the best of the bunch, with the high-quality Combo Racer and above-average Toyota Celica GT Rally making up the second row. A worthy package of exhiliarating racers, 4 Wheel Drive should suit licenceless Mickey's down to a tee. STRIDER "


"TEREDE NINJA COLLECTION OCEAN AMIGA 80% ST 78% Never the sort to miss out on a Christmas money-spinner, Ocean have put together a trio of top martial arts coin-op conversions for budding Bruce Lee's to savour. Shadow War. riors, Dragon Ninja and Double Dragon are the titles, with Shadow Warriors the strongest game in the pack a stunning conversion of the arcade machine. The other two aren't the hottest beat 'em ups in the world, but they'll help while away the hours between Wizard Of Oz and Star Wars... SUPER SEGA US GOLD JAMES AMIGA 80% ST 80% They may not be allowed to bring Sonic The Hedgehog to computer, but at least US Gold can make a bit of Christmas cash by hurling a few of their earlier Sega conversions into a box. Super Sega features top name titles Super Monaco GP, Golden Axe, Crack Down, E-SWAT and Shinobi. All are well worth the effort, apart from E-SWAT and Shinobi which, to be fair, are a bit whiffy. That still leaves a good, solid trio of coin-op conversions to fill the big toe of your Christmas stocking nicely. CHART ATTACK AMIGA 83% GREMLIN ST 83% This is Gremlin's second compilation this Xmas, the featured titles being James Pond, Lotus Esprit Turbo Chall enge (again), Ghouls 'N' Ghosts and Venus The Flytrap. FORGOTTEL Apart from the decidely average Venus The Flytrap. Chart Attack is a sound selection of software, more than able to keep new computer owners happy until the turkey runs out at around Easter time. ENTER THE MONT BLOODSTAINED MOVIE PREMIER AMIGA 50% ELITE ST 49% Elite can usually be relied on to knock out a knock-down games pack at Chrimbo and, true to form, here they are with a quarter of film licenses dubbed Movie Premier. Now showing are the original Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles game, Gremlins 2, Back To The Future 2 and Days Of Thunder. Movie Premier is certainly the most disappointing compilation doing the rounds this December. None of the games available are off staggering quality and BTTF2 and Days Of Thunder are absolute travesties whioch should never have found their way onto computer screens singly, never mind in a pack. If Aunty Flo gets you this for Christmas, make sure she keeps the receipt! "

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY OCEAN BY OCEAN W elcome to Mediabreak-Old Detroit's most V up-to-the-minute news station. Give us two minutes and we'll give you THE WORLD. Hello, I'm Casey Wong, Today's top story: Otomo, the latest addition to the Omni Consumer Products mechanised urban pacification programme, has been unveiled to an eager press. Created to work primarily at street level, Otomo has been de. signed to halt the spread of on-street violence; the unit carries no guns, relying instead on superb martial arts programming. Expect to see OCP's newest weapon down your way soon Meanwhile, as the industrial action by Old Detroit Police Department continues, street crime worsens. Reports of car thefts and terrorism are flooding in, a situation made worse by the breakdown of a number of old-model ED-209 units, each fully armed and running berserk throughout the city. Only a handful police officers are on the job, among them OCP's original law enforcement unit, Robocop. Looks like he'll have his work cut out down there... I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR! Unlike the flat, sideways-scrolling graphics employed in Ocean's conversions of the previous two Robo movies, Robo cop 3 uses polygons to create a complete three-dimensional Simulation of Old Detroit. As well as being able to see the world through Robocop's eyes, a number of different views can be accessed, depending on which of the sub-games is being played. HARNING LON ALTITU STAY OUT OF TROUBLE The action in Robocop 3 consists of five separate arcade sub games. In the first, Robocop must enter a building taken over by terrorists. Then a joyrider must be stopped by ramming the stolen car until it stops. A van full of terrorists must be put out of action in the third game. Complete this section and Ro bocop receives a jet pack and must take to the skies to de stroy rogue tanks and helicopters. The final scene sees Robo, take on Otomo, the ninja robot! Take to the streets for Robo-related thrills 'n' spills Robocop 3 has to be the most original movie tie-in ever. Ocean have been churning out license after license, all using the same scrolling beat or shoot 'em up formula. Robo 3 has come along though and it really breaks the mould. 3D antics, atmospheric music and a whole variety of tasks to complete. The fact that the game can be played as a straightforward arcade blast is great, but you can also play it as a kind of adventure, following the plot of the movie very closely. The best part of all, Is the stalk and shoot section in the skyscraper. Walking around corridors, saving hostages and killing terrorists is great fun. This game is truly superb and has to rank as the best use of a license ever. Amiga owners will be chuffed to bits, but might be interested to know that the game will only run with the supplied \"dongle\" attached. This little bit of computer chippery plugs into the back of the Amiga, allowing Robo to load.Smooth graphics, outstanding music and some outstanding presentation. Brilliant stuff, go buy it! EFFICIENCY 33x FRANK O'CONNOR "


"REVIEW 2 WOBEN ROBOCOP 3 I'd heard all about the revolutionary use of polygons in the new Robocop game, but I wasn't prepared for what hit me when I loaded it up for the first time. This is absolutely unbelievable! Ocean have come up with a product that can truly be called an interactive movie certainly a far cry from their two earlier Robocop games which pale into nothingness when compared to this. Graphically it's incredible; a ridiculous amount of views allows the player to see what's going on from almost any angle and, considering the amount of information onscreen, the frame update is extremely fast (although if you want it even faster, you can turn off the polygons and play with wire-frame versions of the graphics!) Sound and music adds to the atmosphere still further, including the Mediabreak tune taken from the movie! A strong contender for game of the year, Robocop should be right at the top of your list. PAUL RAND SUPERMARI TERMINATIONS YOUR MOVE, CREEP How come there's a Robocop 3 game when there's only been two films? Because the third installment in the Robocop trilogy is yet to be released, that's how. Robocop 3 The Game is reputed to be very close to the plot of the film, but don't expect to see the same amount of killings as there are here, The movie is rumoured to have received a 12 certificate, which means that when it reaches these shores in late Spring of 1992, the violence will have been toned down significantly Zero in on the action in downtown Detroit, where there's no time to muck about! USCRICIES All's quiet in Old Detroit but not for long... AMIGA GRAPHICS 96 SOUNDS PLAYABILITY LASTABILITY 94 OVERALL 94 "

"REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY SEGA BOBBLE BONUSES Bonuses come not only in the form of small cakes, diamonds and pieces of fruit but also large cakes and pieces of fruit! Collect like items without piecking up anything in between and a big bonus item will fall down the screen grab it before it goes! Dub and Bob were just an ordinary pair of Dlads, who enjoyed nothing more than going for a skip through the fields with their girls. Ugly old meany Baron von Blubba, though, got so jealous of the boys that he vowed to spoil their fun and make them cry. This he did by whisking away their girlfriends and turning them into cute dinosaurs. After a swift sob, Bub and Bob de. cided that they had better do something about getting the lasses back. But they had been taken into the very depths of von Blubba's domain. What they found to their glee, however, was that during the change from boys to dinos, they had received the power to blow massive bubbles! Smiles came back to their faces and off they went to defeat that nasty Baron... A Balloon Central or what? Crikey, here's a big 'un! I'M FOREVER BLOWING BUBBLES Bub and Bob's bubble-blowing skills come in handy in a number of ways. The most useful is in destroying Blubba's minions by trapping them inside a bubble and then bursting it with the horns on top of their heads. Another necessary function of the bubbles is to escape from traps too deep to bounce out of, so float to freedom! DIE CDCDCEC Aaaaannngan BUST UP THE BADDIES Whenever a baddy is busted, he turns into an item. Usually its a points bonus in the form of a cake, a diamond or a piece of fruit, but some form letters which, when collected, form the word EXTRA and take the lads to a bonus stage! HelpmaBub these boys mean business! 18636 BOLUDEDUDDE It's surprising that it's taken so long for Bubble Bobble to make it over to the Master System after all, it's not really the most difficult conversion ever. Looking at the screenshots may make you think \"Flip me, that looks quite close to the arcade version.\" You'd be right. It plays much the same too, except in one, very important way. It's much too slow. Slow, slow, slow, slow. A great shame, not to mention a complete mystery. After all, if machines like the Spectrum can handle spritely conversions of this brill game, why not the Sega? Looks like sloppy programming to me. Bubble Bobble is still is an enjoyable game despite that, but only up to the point where you say \"stuff this\" and play something with a bit more zip. PAUL RAND MORE BUB 'N' BOB FUN Bubble Bobble is the first in the Bub and Bob trilogy. The follow-up, Rainbow Islands, has been converted across a wide range of formats while the third in the series, Parasol Stars, is available on the PC Engine and it's great! 82 MASTER SYSTEM GRAPHICS SOUNDS 79 PLAYABILITY LASTABILITY 68 OVERALL 74 UPDATE Bubble Bobble has already found its way onto most machines, so why not go off and brace yourself for some bubbling brilliance?

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY THE SALES CURVE DOUBLE Dilly and Jimmy are rock hard. I mean, they Dare really tough. While other kids are at home watching TV, Billy and Jimmy are down town kickin' ass. In Double Dragon 1 and 2 they were out to save their girlfriend (sharing a girlie is a bit odd if you ask me). She got killed in the second game, but they used magic to revive her. Having a girlie was all very well, but all that kissing and buying flowers took up a lot of valuable ass kickin' time. From now on, Billy and Jimmy are only going to fight for money: love is for sissies. They've been hired this time by a little bloke who looks like Yoda out of Star Wars, who wants them to go to Egypt and recover the lost Rossetta stones. These stones not only have magical powers, but have helped scientists translate those fiddly symbols. After agreeing a price, Billy and Jimmy set off to the local town to catch a plane. As is usual with these two, the local baddies have other ideas and so Billy and Jimmy are going to have to fight all the way to Egypt. ROSETT A Slash those suckers with your swords! morenom OMSON WEAPONS GALORE Unlike the first two games, DD3 features a weapons shop, You can buy a different weapon on each level, as well as a plethora of other goodies. These include extra energy, spe cial trick moves, greater strength and if you have enough money you can buy an extra life. Spend wisely though, because choosing the wrong item could spell disaster! That geezer with the short legs just called you a woman. The double Dragon series has done extremely well for Technos, the company which started it all. The mix of violence and, er, more violence struck a chord with the arcade going punters and it has even spawned a cartoon series in the States. There are a couple of new bits in this one though, including a weapon shop and a rather smart cooperative kung fu move. The action though, is roughly the same as the previous two games. The graphical style has been changed slightly, losing the cartoon feel in favour of a more realistic look. This helps the game loads, there are some neat sprites and rather pretty backgrounds. The animation can be a bit dodgy at times, but the music is really good. As far as playability goes, DD3 is perfectly adequate. Response is quick and definite, a lot better than the previous two games. The problem is really repetition: there are loads of levels but the baddies don't vary too much and the game suffers a little from this. Not bad though and an improvement on DD1 and 2 and that's what sequels should be all about. FRANK O'CONNOR Stand up and watch that fat bloke do a Cossack dance! COINS DOUBLE DRAGON DILEMMA There are two ways to play DD3, you can either help your teammate, or ignore him completely and get all the points. If you want to help your comrade, then it's possible to link arms and per form a rather spectacular spinning, jumping, deadly kick of doom. This will clear all the baddies anywhere near you and gives you some breathing space. It can be really tricky to do, but TRE N ERBROS when it works, it's worth it. A Billy indulges in conversation while Jimmy takes a kicking 094 "


"2 DRAGON REVIEW ES ETTA STONE Crikey! Another Double Dragon game! Storm, the people who brought you the wonderful Rodland, have done themselves reasonably proud with Rosetta Stone. I say reasonably because, although gameplay is as addictive as you'd want and expect a DD game to be, graphics are what can only be described as average. They're drawn well, but animate stiffly and not at all realistically. Sound isn't used to best effect either, for that matter no music during the game and only basic sound effects. Still, it's the game that counts and that's one real tough cookie. Devillishly difficult baddies kick your head in with glee and, even though the multi-loading system is naft, you'll want to stick at the game right to the end. Don't expect the world from Double Dragon III The Rosetta Stone, because that's not what is on offer. Just sit back, load the game as settle yourself down for a good, old-fashioned, fun beat 'em up. PAUL RAND WHATEVER DU WILL HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST BEFORE YOU TOUCH THE STONE HAPPENED TO THE GIRL? DD fans may well remember that the girl they had to save in the first game, was killed in the second. At the end of Double Dragon 2, they managed to revive her with a special magic spell. However, because they both fancied her, they had to fight to decide who would get the girl. Now, what I want to know is this: If Billy beat Jimmy, or vice versa, where is the girlie now? Was there a divorce? Did she run off with the milkUPDATE man? Did she go back to her Expect to see DD3 on just mother? We should be told! about every popular machine, so you too can join the DOUBLE YOUR fun! DRAGONS STOP PRESS! Double Dragon Ill on the NES arrived in the CVG office just too late for us to be able to give it the full review treatment, despite the best efforts of those fine gamesters at Acclaim. However, we can tell you it's looking very good indeed, with fab graphics and cool this looks to be a very challenging conversion. Stay tuned for the full lowdown next ish!

"ARCADE AGTION GAME RESCUE O RUMBS! Our Jaz must be wearing two pairs of Arcade Action boxer Shorts this month, cos here he is with the full lowdown on Steel Talons and a whole shipload of as. sorted coin-op goodies! Take it away Mr J.. According to Atari, Steel Talons represents the ultimate in current game technology and after playing the game I think they're right. A one or simultaneous two-player attack helicopter simulation, this very impressive filled-3D vector graphic machine allows potential pilots to fly Apocalypse Now-style helicopter missions in a variety of different war zones. There are loads of different missions to undertake, all of which basically involve taking out every target highlighted on the radar screen at the bottom of the display. These targets include gun emplacements, tanks, buildings and general military transport, as well as planes and helicopters. The action is frantic, and you have to use all your piloting skills to avoid the constant enemy barrage. The chopper can take some hits, but once damage becomes to severe, it spins out of the sky and hits the deck...and bang goes a credit! 0258 "


"BUTTON TO START STEEL TALONS GUNSHIP SPECIFICATIONS : COMPLEX CONTROLS To a novice, Steel Talons seems a nightmare to control. As well as a joystick, rotor throttle and two independent fire buttons, you've also got two floor pedals which control the tail rotor and let you spin and slew the chopper left and right. Once you master the controls, though, you can perform an amazing array of moves, including loop-the-loops, flying backwards and sideways, hovering and even spinning on the spot! AIR DATA SENSOR BLADE ARTICULATED ROIOR 3380 SHAFT HORSEPOWER INFRARED SUPPRESSOR ONBOARD COMPUTER TWO-PLAYER ACTION As well as tackling missions together, players can opt to battle it out head-to-head. Here the scenery is cleared of all enemy targets, leaving just the two helicopters to fight it out in a dogfight to the death. It's a great way to play the game, with hill-hopping and canyon running ahoy as the players try to out-smart one another. DOPPLER RADAR ALTIMETER TARGEI ACQUISITION RELATIVE ALTITUDE SENSING BORON CARBIDE ARMOR HELLFIRE ALISSLES 30mn CHAIN CANNON LASER SEEKING LONG STAND OFF RANGE COMBAT MISSIONS TRAINING   TALONIS* curOpiliAfter months of playing dull, unoriginal coin-ops, Steel Talons is a real breath of fresh air. Its complex controls and amazing 3D graphics make it feel like a full-blown multi-million pound military helicopter flight simulator, especially when you play the \"real\" flight option which accurately copies the controls and handling of an actual Blackhawk S-67 helicopter! The action is fast and furious and there's plenty to test your chopper handling skills some of the later missions are amazingly tough, especially if you tackle them solo! My fave, though, is the two-player head-to-head option. It's simply superb as both players play cat-and-mouse, using the scenery to launch surprise attacks. Steel Talons is one of the best coin-ops I've played in a long time. Break your piggy bank and head off down the arcades now! JULIAN RIGNALL ins MULTI-PLAY MODES There are two different viewpoints: third person perspective, which gives you an Afterburner-style view of the action and a true first person perspective from the actual cockpit. There are also two modes of play: \"arcade\" and \"real helicopter flight\". Controlling the chopper is easy in \"arcade\" mode, while the \"real\" option offers true chopper handling which is difficult to master but offers experts potential to pull off incredible aerobatic stunts.

"SPIDER: MA the VIDEOGAME ARCADE ACTION L TD Battle Of The Salar System A rather unfortunate name, but a superb, highly original game, Battle Of The Solar System is the second coin-op from Microprose and uses the same graphics technology that appeared in their extremely impressive, but commercially unsuccessful F-15 Strike Eagle. B.O.T.T.S is more mainstream than its predecessor and gives the player the chance to take control of a giant war robot, enter a futuristic war zone and do battle with other similarly massive and horribly be-weaponed robots. The filled-3D graphics are astounding, with fantastic animation on the robots blow off an enemy's leg and watch the machine slowly crash to the floor and explode into thousands of pieces! The game is great fun to play, with six different war zones to test your robot-driving skills later ones are pure mayhem, with mega-powerful warbots blasting you with laser beams, plasma cannons and even nuclear missiles! Brilliant stuff which is highly recommended to fans of Armageddonstyle destruction! Hitting arcades everywhere is Sega's latest coin-op. Spiderman. This 32-bit, simultaneous four-player megamachine lets the players take control of Spiderman, SubMariner, Hawkeye and Black Cat and battle six of Spidey's most fearsome archenemies: Kingpin, Scorpion, Green Goblin, Venom and the Lizard. As you might guess, it's a beat 'em up, but it features incredible graphics with huge, beautifully animated sprites and an impressive zoom in/zoom out effect which changes the size of the characters from scene to scene. Beat 'em ups are ten a penny these days, but with 16 different stages and those amazing graphics, this has enough to keep you pumping in the credits PRESTILING FEDERATION ENERGY WWF Those mega-popular WWF wrestlers are back in the ar. cades again in their second coin-op, which follows on from the 1987 classic, WWF Superstars. It's a multi-player machine which gives the participants the opportunity to take control of and do battle with the most popular of WWF stars. There are loads of moves to master, and the highly enjoyable grappling action should keep WWF fans short of loose change for quite some time! 195 DRAGONS LAIR II Tecmo's Thunder Dragon is yet another vertically scrolling blaster which features I power ups and end-of-level SOL bosses. But although it's Atdz completely devoid of originWe ality, it's quite fun to play, with plenty of death 'n' destruction as you blaze a trail across enemy landscapes. If you're not yet sick of this type of game, give it a whirlit's one of the better up-the220 MI screen blasters to appear ABO this year. ME SPECIAL MILITARY Considering that 8 years have passed since the original Dragon's Lair laser disk arcade machine first appeared, this is a big disappointment. The problem is that apart from the laser disk response time now being virtually instantaneous (rather than having a second or two's blank screen as the laser disk head searches for the relevant piece of action) the gameplay and controls are identical to the original machinel Once again the player guides Dirk the Daring through \"hilarious\" cartoon escapades, and once more the key to success involves pushing the joystick in the right direction at the correct time to move onto the next piece of \"action\". This is fine for people who want to experience a fancy multi-choice pseudo interactive cartoon, but for those who want a true test of skill will find that the novelty of Dirk's cartoon japery and the extremely limited linear action will swiftly wear off...just like it so swiftly did 8 years ago!

"RUNARK TAITO PRE Arcade fans might remember Taito's Growi, a beat 'em up which briefly hit the arcades earlier this year. It's now avail able on the Megadrive under its Japanese title, Runark. The game is a fairly smart beat 'em up with an odd perspective. It looks like Mercs, plays like Final Fight and the plot is straight out of a Greenpeace documentary. You have to rescue wild animals and bits of rainforest from the clutches of heartless de velopers. How do you go about this? Well you don't lobby par liament or chain yourself to railings, nor do you sabotage hunts. No, you wander about the jungle, smacking people in the teeth. There are some outrageous fighting antics in this game, like the baddle who lobs pick-up trucks at you, as well as the obligatory suspender girlies with whips. It's available on import right now and it shouldn't be too long before it's official VIEW MARBLE MADNESS ELECTRONIC ARTS The most original arcade game of the eighties was probably Marble Madness. Atari's masterpiece is available on just about every machine going and it's now on the Megadrive courtesy of Electronic Arts. We've played a sneak preview version and it has to be said that this is probably the best version of the lot. All six levels are there, as well as the secret hidden level. The graphics are perfect and the soundtrack is of the toppest quality. Look out for it at the start of the new year. HISCORE 246500_SCORE 246500 30 END FOR YOU.

"PRE DDD ODD ODOTE DOOF 0 000 VIEW oor NEW ZEALAND STORY TECMAGIK Tecmagik are all set to unveil what might well be the biggest Master System game for ages. New Zealand Story has been out in the arcades for a while now and home versions exist for every machine except the good old Master System. These sneak preview shots give some idea of what it'll look like when it's finished. The screenshots from the early version look dreamy, let's hope that the finished game lives up to its appearance. Tecmagik assure us that the Master System game will have all the playability of its arcade counterpart. It's being programmed by the same top geezer responsible for Master System Populous, so expect great things from it. Look out for it. BLACK CRYPT ELECTRONIC ARTS L ere's a sneak peak at a fabby-looking newie from EA, set for release in February. Black crypt is best described as a Dungeon Master derivative, full of dungeons and danger and, well, everything else you'd expect from a topper EA game. You're cast as the leader of a brave band of adventurous folk on a quest to retrive the mysterious artifacts which hold the secrets of the Guardians, saving all and sundry from the hideous forces of evil into the bargain. With all that malarkey through 12 dungeons ahead of you, it's just as well your every command is simplicity itself-point and click action all the way. As you can see from these screenshots, graphics are looking fab and Dungeon Master/Eye Of The Beholder fans should be shivering with excitement right about new. Initially Dark Crypt will be available on 1 Meg Amigas at .99. More news the very second we have it...
