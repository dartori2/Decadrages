EDITOR TIM L BOONE When I was at school I entered this competition to do a picture of a farmyard animal, and I made a cow out of milk bottle tops which thought was bloody clever. I won third prize and felt well cheated when all I got was this crap certificate with my name spelt wrong. The worst thing was I had to stand next to the winner and his family and they kept going on about how great he was. I just stood there and stared them down. DEPUTY EDITOR FRANK JOHN O'CONNOR When I was 12 I went to this big car launch where they were giving away incredible prizes like holidays and cars if you found these special gold stars hidden around the showroom. I found one stuck on a noticeboard which everyone else had missed, even though they were staring straight at it, and with my heart beating wildly Thanded it in. My prize? Five litres of Castrol GTX motor oil. ART EDITOR JON SODOM BILLINGTON I once designed this really crap T-shirt for some really rubbish charity function. It was the worst thing I've ever done and they put it up as a raffle prize. I bought a ticket 'cos I felt so guilty and sad about the whole thing. Guess what? Nobody else bought a ticket and I ended up winning it. In the end I gave it to my mum to use as a kitchen rag cos that was all it was good for. STAFF WRITER PAUL DAVID RAND I've never won anything in my entire life, although I did come third in the London Karaoke Championships with the rest of the team after dying my hair jet black, wearing this bright blue Elvis suit and shuffling about in enormous boots with huge platform soles. I've never looked sillier in my entire life but all the girls suddenly thought I was fab. I must be doing something wrong... DESIGNER JENNY JAYNE ABROOK I once won this really awful doll's tea set after drawing this rubbish advert for a radio station and they read out my name as well. My entry read: \"The Lion and The Bumblebee have come to tea, Now that you are three, LBC.\" I was only five and my mum had to help out. I think I did the bit at the end and you can blame her for the rest. MANAGING EDITOR JULIAN BULGARIA RIGNALL When I was a kid I won a Wombles waste paper bin for completing this phrase in an apt and original way: \"Whenever you go to Wimpy. You'll find the Wombles there...\" My winning entry was: \"It's always clean and tidy and offers such good fare.\" Actually, entered the competition twice. The second entry was much better, but I didn't win anything for it: \"Whenever you go to Wimpy, You'll find the Wombles there. They like to take their knickers off And throw them in the air.\" ADVERTISING MANAGER: Jim Owens SALES EXEC: Greg Watson PRODUCTION ASSISTANT: Matthew Walker SECRETARY: Joanne Briar MARKETING MANAGER: Marc Swallow MARKETING EXECS: Sarah Ewing and Sarah Hillard PUBLISHING DIRECTOR: Graham Taylor MANAGING DIRECTOR: Terry Pratt SUBSCRIPTION AND BACK ISSUE ENQUIRIES (INCLUDING GO!

"NEWS NA PORTATES AMES! GAMES! GAMES! Imagine every hot console and computer game in the entire world crammed under one roof, and you can play anything you want as long as you like. That's what happens at the CES in Chicago and to get a Golden Ticket you need vast sums of cash, stunning good looks, massive muscles or JAZZA RIGNALL's haircut. Rolled up copies of CVG and Mean Machines tucked under his arm, Jaz playtested zillions of games during this threeday feast of fun. This is what he saw... OCES SPECIAL O MARIO'S MOTORS BACK! INTRODUCING... Mario is soon to return to the Super NES! Not in Super Mario five, and not in a platform game. No Sir! SUPER MARIO KART is the name of the game, and the fair sport of motor racing is what it's all about. It's a split screen racing game similar to F-Zero in which players take on all their favourite go kart-driving Mario characters in an attempt to be the first past the checkered flag. Bowser's in their, as well as Koopa, Luigi, Mushroom, The Princess and, of course, Mario himself. The game is simply brilliant and rest asured we'll have the first Review! You've NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THEM 300' 41'61 2002297 820 000'22\"97 GAME BOY MEGA-CD GAMES ON THE WAY! \"Just what the heck are HUMANS?... and what are they doing in a video game anyhow?\" We know...we've heard it before, they're strange..they're ugly... they're...stupid. But there's more to these HUMANS than meets the eye, for inside each and every one of them is a small but usable brain. Working as a team and discovering new tools is the key to survival in this cruel world of chaos and carnivores. It's an action-filled race against time where you score points by finishing levels with as many of your fellow tribesman intact, (which isn't that easy when it comes down to survival of the fittest). With GameTek's GomeBoy version of HUMANS, the only missing link is you! Nintendo GAMETEK 1997 Gondok Inc. 0,19 Imogies Desinin Surprise announcement of the show is that Sierra are to become the biggest Sega CD game manufacturers. All their best-known adventure games are to appear on CD-ROM, including the infamous Leisure Suit Larry, Police Quest and King's Quest. Sounds interesting! Other CD games coming soon include Terminator from Virgin, Terminator 2: The Arcade Game, WWF Mega Wrestlemania (both from Acclaim), Wonder Dog (a Sonic the Hedgehog type game from JVC), Pitfighter II from Tengen and Batman Returns which uses real video footage from the film! Sega have managed to include quite a lot of full motion video running at about 12 frames per second, equivalent to the quality of a cartoon show. Sounds promising! The official launch of the unit looks a little closer now so expect the machine with around fifteen titles before Christmas. Gametek have the console rights to the Mirage computer game, Humans. From the screenshots you might assume that this game looks quite similar to Psygnosis' classic Lemmings, but we're assured it's remarkably different the aim being to make these Humans work as a team and jointly discover new tools. With these tools, the Humans are able to survive in a cruel world packed with chaos and carnivores! Basically, you must complete each level with your fellow tribesman alive or it's game over. Gametek have Humans ready on the Super NES and Gameboy with the possibility of a Nintendo 8-bit version arriving later on. No release dates for the game on either side of the Atlantic were available, but we'll keep you posted. CVG 01 "

"WOT? NO MASTER SYSTEM? DIN AURI NEWS The CES show was a Master System dead zone. In the US the machine has been declared history and no more software is being released for the machine. Does that mean disaster for the UK? No, not at all. There are plenty of new games scheduled for release in Europe, including Tom and Jerry, Sonic II, Batman Returns, Lemmings, Tazmania, Mickey Mouse ll and Streets of Rage. So don't worry be happy!  CES SPECIAL O THE HOTTE CAMESAROUND AVENGERS ASSEMBLE! Data East announced a conversion of their popular Captain America and the Avengers coin-op for the Megadrive. The game is a Double Dragon-style beat 'em up, with one or two players laying into the minions of the Red Skull in search of justice. Four of the many Avengers are available for service Captain America (embodiment of the American Dream and pretty hard because of it), Hawkeye (ace archer with funny costume), the Vision (a married Android with laser powers) and Ironman (man in a technologically advanced suit made of aforementioned alloy). This 8-meg game is looking pretty good at the moment, with all the features from the coin-op present. We'll give you more details on the game just as soon as we can get them. Danny Sullivand INDY ADEN, ODTAIN A DCEATA y and The AVENGERS and the SONIC 2 IT'S TRUE! An early Sonic 2 rumour confirmed at the show is that he's got a pal with two tails! Yes indeed, hedgehog fans will be pleased to know that Sonic's been joined by a two-tailed fox but it's hard to say how they play together because nobody got close enough to look! Rest assured CVG will bring you more news the moment we have it. The game is due for release at the end of the year on Megadrive and Game Gear, with the Master System version coming a touch earlier. Watch this space! TRADE WEST FOUR INDY RACING A-GO-GO GAME GEAR SHIFTS UP Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat is an 8-bit NES conversion of the not-very-popular coinop. It's being released by Tradewest and in case you've never heard of the game it's basically a Super Sprint variant with power-ups rather akin to the Super Off-Road coin-op. Although the graphics look fairly good in this game, it's playability that counts. We'll be looking at the game in more depth in a later issue. SOUD Loads of games are coming out for Sega's hand-held machine including some big-name games. Aliens 3, Terminator and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves head up the big film licences, Andre Agassi and George Foreman are two sports stars who are endorsing games for the machine and Super Space Invaders, Marble Madness, Paperboy, Double Dragon and Rampart are coin-op conversions you can expect to play soon.

"VIRGIN ON THE EXCELLENT Virgin have two cracking games coming out on Megadrive Mohammed Ali Boxing and Mick and Mack the Global Gladiators. The first is programmed by Park Place, the people behind John Madden's 92 and EA Hockey. As you can expect, it's a stunner, with spinning camera shots and beautifully animated sprites. Mick and Mack is a platform game with a green message, with players taking control of the eponymous heroes and guiding them around the landscape. The graphics, sound and playability are all brilliant. This is definitely one to watch out for!

A really good game at the show was King of the Monsters on Super NES and Megadrive. Converted from one of the best Neo Geo games out, it's your objective to stroll around an eight-way scrolling city, destroying everything in sight as only a hundred ton monster can. Look out for resistance from your victims though, in the form of air attacks and artillery barrages. This game looks remarkably close to the Neo Geo version, even down to the simultaneous two-player mode of the original. Look out for this one, it's going to be a really cool game! Fatal Fury, a Neo Geo Final Fight game, has also been scheduled for conversion and it's looking tasty too! EXCLUSIVE! TERMINTOR 2 AND LOADS MORE TOO! Here's a sneaky peak at some of the white hot titles coming your way soon, courtesy of Acclaim. First up comes TERMINATOR 2 on the Super Nintendo, which is looking a bit of alright as you can see from these shots. Acclaim claim the game (poetry no extra charge) \"will recreate many of the multimillion dollar special effects of the movie.\" Crumbs! T2 will be available in November watch this space for more info! Other top titles coming your way from Acclaim include THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN AND UNCANNY X-MEN: ARCADE'S REVENGE on the SNES, SIMPSONS: BART'S NIGHTMARE on the SNES and GEORGE FOREMAN'S KO BOXING on the NES. Spider-Man already looks like it could be something very special indeed, especially with plans in the pipeline for a movie directed by none other than James (Terminator, T2, Aliens) Cameron! Acclaim have high hopes for Bart's as well. Apparently the game will feature spiffy digitised sound and some well deep gameplay to keep you at it for ages.

"CUE REVIEWS CVC INCREDIBLE! One of the most! popular beat 'em ups ever is about to touch down on the Official UK Super Nintendo and it's going to be one of the biggest games of the year! So what does CVG do about that, eh? Do we fret? Do we worry? No! We grab the Official game for an EXCLUSIVE Review -AND Review the follow-up, Final Fight! Guy, in this gobsmacling CVG Special because we're THAT HARD! PICK IT UP FOR TOTAL VIOLENCE SUPER NINTENDO Apart from using your fists and feet, there are a load of handy weapons just lying around for you to use. Some can be found hidden in crates and barrels, while others are actually carried by the baddies themselves. To get the weapon from them you have to bash their heads in, wait until they drop what they're carrying, then pick it up and use it. The most common weapon is the knife which can be thrust or thrown at the enemy. Swords also appear from time to time and these have a devastating effect and a very long reach. Cody is best with weapons, as Haggar seems to drop them very easily. Mind you, there's never one around when you really need it. BEAT 'EM UP BY CAPCOM .99 Trouble with the locals. .No Queensbury rules here... HEGGER Poor old Cody. His girlfriend's been snaffled away by the evil Mad Gear gang and now he and Haggar the mayor have to go and rescue her. Fortunately, they're both dead hard Cody is a martial artist and Haggar is a reformed streetfighter. The kidnappers want a million dollars ransom money, but beating them to within an inch of their lives is probably the cheapest way of dealing with the problem. Use all your skill and a sprinkling of lethal weapons to make your way through the seedy backstreets and get even! Cody and Haggar...Well hard! ...or here! WESTSIDE ON THE BUSES BOXARED BUURT *Final Fight was one of my favourite coin-ops and Capcom have done a class job with this conversion. The graphics of the original have been faithfully and perfectly transferred to the SNES. The sprites are huge, the backgrounds spectacular and the action is frenetic. Music is a bit twee but the brutal sound effects more than make up for it. The absence of a two player mode and the mysterious absence of Guy let it down a little, but not a lot. Although the action is a bit simple, there's lots of it and it can be very difficult. Infinite continues make things a little easier, but real hard men don't use them. Top stuff and one of the essential beat 'em ups.\" FRANK O'CONNOR Actually there are no buses at all. There is however a thundering tube train on which much of the action takes place. This is the most realistic section of the game as the train is full of drug-crazed psychopaths, just like London Underground on a Friday night. The train thunders along as the passengers get up and have a go at you. It's all very scary and claustrophobic so don't poop your pants. The bad guys are particularly tough on this level, creeping up from behind when you're scrapping with some other bloke, so keep on your guard at all times! Trouble on the tube...but what's that barrel doing there? You'll find plenty of location's for a Rumble! ROURE JE "


"1793833, C Knock out! RESTHRAM For some of cody and haggar's opponents this is thier final fight...of course it's up to yout FINALE 1 loved Final Fight in the arcades, and thankfully this is a top-rate conversion to the Super Nintendo. Capcom have managed to capture the look, feel and spirit of the original and provide one of the best beaters on the SNES although I have to say it doesn't even come close to Streetfighter 2! Huge sprites, great backdrops and fast action gameplay help bring home the arcade feel, and even though the gameplay can become very samey there's an enormous urge to keep going and see what the computer can throw at you next! Right now Nintendo are picking all the best SNES titles for official UK release, and this one ranks right up there with the best of them. If you're looking for a good solid beat 'em up and don't want to pay the ridiculous grey import price for Streetfighter 2 then go for this while you wait for the Big One to come down in price. Great fun! TIM BOONE WHAT, NO GIRLIES? The British cart is exactly the same as the American version, which is different to the Japanese original. What's the difference? Well, those limp-wrists in charge of software in the States reckoned that American kids would be upset at the thought of whacking a girl and so the suspender-clad lovelies from the first game have been removed and replaced with sad punks. What's wrong with these people? What's so bad about smacking a knife-weilding girl in the gob? The broken bottles present in the arcade have also been taken out. Does that mean, it's OK to hit someone with a great big sword but not with a bottle? Very weird!

"AVA EVE REVIEWS SUPER NINTENDO BEAT EM UP BYCAPCOM .00 'rm, your girlfriend's been kidnapped again. Look, I'm sorry, but that's what happened. Guy and Haggar (yup, the mayor with the ham fists) have to track her down and rescue her from the Mad Gear gang. You are Cody but you're not coming along on this one because you've got a bad leg (or something). What, no Cody? Nope. Apparently Capcom didn't have enough memory to put all three characters in the game so they released two versions. The first features Cody and Haggar, while this version has Guy and Haggar. Bizarre! To all intents and purposes though, the games are absolutely identical. Rescue the girl, beat up the baddies and generally destroy everything in your path. HEGGER Oh look, it's a fat boy. Let's kick him in, eh? THROWING A STROP It's all very well you running around punching people in the teeth, but you're going to have to use a bit of strategy if you want to do well. It's possible to throw baddies around the screen, but also quite tricky to do. You walk up real close, grab them, choose a direction, hit the fire button and throw them! If you chuck a baddie at a wall or an object you'll double the damage done to him. Better still, you can throw him at the other fighters, knocking them down in the process! Throwing is far more destructive than punching, but combinations of both work even better. MID LEVEL CHALLENGE Every now and then you'll come across a bonus round. Some contain end of level baddies, others are just there for points. A car (the same kind as in Streetfighter 2) just lies there waiting for you to destroy it and the faster you wreck it the more points you get. At one point you're thrown into a boxing ring with a sword wielding Samurai and you have to fight him! The evil goon comes charging at you and he's almost impossible to avoid. Fortunately there are loads of handy swords just lying about waiting to be picked up. Phew! WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE Az E TIH Although there's the obvious addition of the Guy character (at the expense of Cody) there are a couple of other minor differences. For one thing there seems to be less slowdown than the original. The programmers have tweaked and refined the game and although the changes are minimal, they help the action flow that little bit better. Because this is a Japanese grey import, it hasn't been subject to Nintendo of America's strict moral evalua tion and, as a result, the suspender clad women are still there. There's also a tiny bit more blood and guts when you smack and slice the baddies. Hurrah! BARRELDRE IT \"Wow! What a sense of Deja Vu! It's all so familiar. Final Fight Guy is exactly the same as the first one! Owners of the original Final Fight would have to be drooling fanatics to even consider purchasing this one. I think what it all boils down to which character you prefer. If you like Cody, get the original and if you like Guy, get this. The graphics as before are superb, with brilliant sprites and amazing backdrops. Music is a bit cheesy with a weird mixture of haunting melodies and throbbing rock anthems. The sound effects are brutal and effective and the overall feel is one of awesome violence. That's about all there is to it, one of the best beat 'em ups around but a complete no hoper for anyone who has the origiLook, it's trouble on the tube! THANKS... nal.\" to Advanced Console Entertainment (071 383 0480) for the cart. (0782 712759 ) for the review cartridge. CVG 024 FRANK O'CONNOR "


"CHANTIEI SIMONSIE REVIEW GUE HHHHHHH Who needs a first in the gob when you can throw bad lads over your shoulder and really teach 'em who's King of the Streets? So do it and stop mucking abaat... OOOO 000000 FAMOUS FIGHTERS SODOM 98kg Here are a few famous fighters you may or may not have heard about: KING DAVID: Biblical boyo who got challenged to a scrap with some enormous bruiser called Goliath and took the sucker out with a catapult. Hurrah! SPARTACUS: A well 'ard gladiator who lead a massive slave revolt against the Roman Empire in AD something or other. PETER THE GREAT: Massive Russian Emperor who stood about seven feet tall, could dust anyone and even pulled out people's teeth for fun! BRUCE LEE: Finest exponent of the Martial Arts and a true CVG hero. Rent his films and be blown away by his fighting skills! OLIVER REED: Excellent actor who's off screen exploits and legendary After Dark appearance have earned him cult hero worship in the CVG DAMND 201kg office! ABIGAIL 265kg \"First things first this is NOT the followup to Final Fight. In fact it's not even a follow on. What we're talking here is Final Fight with Guy in it and, um, that's all! The idea is that both games complement each other to form the coin-op, and you buy whichever one suits you best. Well, that's the thoery anyway. Everything you could reasonably want is here, but anyone who's already got the original Final Fight will be sorely disappointed because it's just more of the same. Great graphics, excellent gameplay, good sound, fab game. Trouble is, with the official Final Fight just around the corner there's not going to be that much point buying this.

Guy can perform an incredible spinning kick which takes out baddies on all sides. You activate this by pressing jump and kick at the same time. Haggar too can deal with loads of baddies at once as he whirls around, arms outstretched. The price you pay for all this destruction is energy. Every time you use the special move, your energy bar drops a fraction. When your energy is very low you can no longer use the special moves.

"GUE REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO TRA ET ARCADE Sess BY CAPCOM .00 BOO PAUSE ragons, sorcerers, warriors and barbarians. They've all got one thing in common they always turn up in video games. The world has been taken over by the evil Dragon Emperor or something and it's up to you and a band of brave fighters to save us all. Using techniques ranging from swordsmanship to wizardry, you must seek out the evil warlord and destroy him once and for all. You and your gang are armed to the teeth, but the dark tower where the evil one lives is packed full of danger and pantswetting excitement. This is no trip to Tesco's, this is a battle to the death.. mm 0 m Go on, whack 'em! Magic Sword THE REAL MAGIC SWORD The game is almost identical to its arca de counterpart so if you liked that u'r in for a treat. Graphics are neat and detailed with som e impressive if repetitive backdrops. The game taxes a load of ideas and style from an earlier Capcom game, Black Tiger, but it's fast and playable nonetheless. Music is really outstanding with loads of spooky and atmospheric organ pieces and some really scary tunes. The sound effects are good too, with loads of sampled noise and the odd scream here and there. The game can be a little samey but there's still that urge to see what's on the next level. If you're good, it won't take you too long to finish but beginners will reap a load of fun from this one. A good solid hack 'em up with loads of bells and whistles. CVG 038 FRANK O'CONNOR Starting the game as a lone warrior, you are armed with a sturdy but rather small sword. As is the case with all real men, you want a bigger weapon. Hacking and slashing with the pointy end of your little sword is all very well, but you should start looking for something a bit more dangerous. Killing certain end level baddies rewards you with a bigger sword and the more of them you kill, the bigger your sword gets! Apart from giving you more power and a longer reach, the swords can fire beams of ever more powerful energy, wiping out most on screen menaces. If you are hit, the sword will fly out of your hands and sometimes it falls in an impossible to reach corner of the screen. Bum burps! Lots to see and lots to do. Most excellent graphics...

"REVIEW AVE ook before your leap and make in full effect as wall.. TOWER OF TERROR  There are fifty levels in the tower, so there's quite a lot of hacking and slashing to be done before your reach the final confrontation. You don't have to fight your way through all fifty levels though, because the option screen allows you to start at level thirty. Of course you'd have to be a sad shuffling zomboid to do that and a particularly poor gamesplayer. If you do reach the top and defeat the final baddie, you'll be faced with a very difficult choice. The source of the evil power is a jewel known as the black orb and you must choose to either keep it or destroy it. Smashing it will restore peace and harmony to the world, but keeping it will bestow ultimate power to you, turning you into a bad guy in the process. No contest, eh? Smash the bloody thing... 0° Capcom are the brains behind some truly awesome arcaders, and Magic Sword is no exception. This is an excellent conversion of the coin-op, and everyone who pumped too much silver into the original should be on Cloud Nine right about now. Visually the game is nothing new even though the graphics are excellent but sound is outstanding. There's a real sense of dread running through the game and you have to keep going just to prove you're hard enough to do it even if the background graphics can become incredibly samey after a while. I enjoyed Magic Sword in the arcades and I like it even better now it doesn't slurp my silver. It's not a classic and certainly doesn't rank up ONE there with other Capcom killers like Streetfighter 2, but it is great fun and comes with a solid thumbs up from me! Well worth a good slash. TOP TOP 500000 THE GANG OF NINE Although you start this perilous mission on your own, you have another eight pals to help you on your way. They have been locked up in the castle by the Evil One and when released, they will aid you in your journey. You can only have one helper at a time, but they effectively double your firepower anyway! There's a magician, a sorceress, an Arabian warrior, a ninja, a knight, a gorilla, a lizard and a priest. They all use different weapons and fire them at the same time as you. All of them are about the same strength, but some are faster and some have a wider range. It's up to you which hero you want to use and it really does make a difference! LALE TIM BOONE Beebze CHESTY MORGAN'S BOX OF DELIGHTS STRATEGY SKILL Scattered willy nilly around the towers of the castle are loads and loads of treasure chests.

The chest will spring open and a pillar of fire will spread out from it, generally toasting you and your pal in the process. Even worse, sometimes an opened chest will cause a massive rockfall which is almost impossible to avoid. Some chests are hidden and will only be revealed by a slight flickering near their location.

Yes indeedy, Capcom have pulled out all the stops on this one and manufactured the biggest cartridge in video gaming history. 16 Megs! Most cartridges are about four Meg and bigger games are eight. But 16? It's unheard of! All this memory is used to hold the huge amount of animation required to bring the characters to life. Huge sprites with dozens of moves can be very greedy as far as memory is concerned. To top it all, Capcom have included all but one word of the sampled speech and screams of pain.

Well, the wait is over because it's here: Streetfighter 2 the most eagerly anticipated video game of all time! The plot is simple, but the game is far from that. Ryu, the world's strongest fighter, has entered the Streetfighter tournament hoping to regain his crown. Money and glory don't interest him, he just fights to test himself against the world's best. Ryu is prepared for the fight of his life, but the other contestants have their own reasons for joining the frey. Every one of them has strengths and weaknesses, and the only way to discover everything about this awesome beat 'em up is to play it, and play it and play it!

The list is as follows: 64009 IKO HONDA care TERRI TRE YOU PAYS YOUR MONEY AND TAKES YOUR CHOICE Ryu a karateka with a zen attitude Ken a karateka with silly hair Chun Li a top Kung Fu mistress The only bad news about Streetfighter 2 is the price.

As you're probably well aware, the arcade game has six fire buttons, representing three strengths of kick and punch. On any other machine this might have detracted from the game, but the Super NES control pads are blessed with six buttons -including the Land R pads on the top of the unit. Although this calls for some considerable dexterity on the part of the player, it's perfectly fine once you get used to it. You can swap the buttons around on the option screen and choose the setup that suits you best. Capcom are soon to release a nifty bit of kit called the Competition Stick, which has all six buttons in the perfect layout and a nice responsive stick. If that's not available soon enough, you could always try Halken's J.B. King a very similar unit to the Competition Stick and use that to kick the crap out of the competition. CROUCH, JUMP SOFT/ HARD PUNCH. & DIRECTION. SUPER NINTENDO Cor blimey! It's not often we get so excited about the arrival of a game, but this one had us peeing our pants with sheer nerves! Would it be perfect? Would it be the conversion of the decade? Would it be the best thing since the Big Bang? The answer to all these questions is YES! Streetfighter 2 is the most accurate arcade conversion of all time. No doubt about it. Every single thing that was in the original game has been faithfully translated. The graphics are perfect, some of the best ever in fact. The music is awesome, the sound effects superb and the gameplay matchless. If it wasn't for the price, this would be in the running for the coveted title of sexiest video game ever. If you have a SNES, you must get this, it's as simple as that. This game has more lastability than any other title and you'll be playing this five years from now. As a one player odyssey, this is unbeatable, but with two players this will stop the traffic. Even at ninety quid, this is almost a bargain. With advance orders at 1.5 million, this will almost certainly be one of the best selling games of all time and rightly so. FRANK O'CONNOR SELECT START BLOCKING AND SPECIAL MOVES SOFT/ HARD KICK SUPER SPECIAL MOVES! Each of the fighters is blessed with at least two special moves. Ryu and Ken can perform three. They can loose off a fireball, do a spinning cyclone kick and, if they're clever, the amazing Dragon punch which kills just about anyone. Zangief can do a spinning punch, arms outstretched, while Chun Li has the spectacular spinning bird kick as well as the hundred foot kick. Honda does something similar with a punch and Guile can loose off tremendous Sonic Boom fireballs. The secret moves are all incredibly difficult to perform on the joypads, requiring feats of dexterity far beyond the capabilities of normal human beings. Getting it right is a real thrill and can help you complete the game. A flying kick from Vega knocks Ken to the ground. KO P2 JON SAYS: What a laugh! This cart actually manages to make me even more hot and sweaty than a real scrap. A hoot and a half and no mistake! JENNY SAYS: I don't like fighting, but you just can't resist a scrap like this! Even if you've never played the arcade game, I guarantee you'll go gaga over this! The spinning bird kick catches Ryu unawares...aiee! "

I was also rather chuffed to find the two-player mode that lets you choose both characters and scenarios and the fact that, after a few goes, I found that I was getting gradually better at using the special moves, timing attacks and such.

When the CVG boys ignore the office Streetfighter 2 machine and spend all their time on the SNES with this cart then you know you've got something very special on your hands. The only drawback is the price  for any cart just doesn't cut it with me, and this game would have scored even higher if not for this drawback. Nevertheless it has to be said that this is a Must Have for any SNES owner and you'd have to be a shambling dribbler to miss out! TIM BOONE The new bonus section is a race against time to destroy the towering pile of bricks.

"SNOB'S MAILBAG mu spare minute. All of my friends say ! am thick because I think Spectrums are better than Amigas. Are they right or am I? Just because Amigas have the best graphics and more types of games, does that really make them best? Please will you answer my questions? 1. Do Amigas have better playability than Spectrums? 2. Are the makers of Spectrum bringing out a handheld? 3. What is the best Spectrum game? John Burns Sunderland SNOB: Dear John old chap, 1. I'm sorry to tell you this. 2.

Now unless you've been using Oil Of Ulay twice a day I don't see how this reversing process can be justified. No answer, eh? Just as well I've got a few questions. 1. Are Commodore planning to release a hand-held? 2. Which hand-held has the best speech capabilities? 3. Don't you just feel sorry for all those Amstrad owners out there? (Ho! Ho!) 4.

"BOBBY DAVRO Dear YOB, I am a proud Amiga owner and a friend has asked me for some advice. As I don't know the answer to his question I came to you. What is the difference between a Super Famicom and a Super NES? I do hope you can make a look a complete brainbox in front of my mate. Colin Mackie Aberdeen SNOB: The differences between a Super Famicom and a Super NES are many and varied, so I've consulted YOB's detailed files for the full blueprint and will take you through the changes one by one. First there's the N, which stands for No Brain. Then there's the E, which stands for Entirely Crap. Finally there's S, which stands for Stupidly Moronic And Utterly Useless Cretin Who Ought To Know Better. If your chum thinks you're a complete brainbox his head must be as devoid of intelligent life as Aberdeen generally is.

The thing I don't get about you is the fact that you find Aussie land so saddening. I come from Down Under but have emigrated just to get your mag faster. By the way, quite a large percentage of Brits travel Down Under each year and enjoy it. I've got a Game Gear and am finding it hard to get any good challenging games at all. Please send me a hundred quid to get a bus up to Computer Concepts to get a game and the rest would be for a five-year subscription to your ace mag. Sad Man Forgothisname SNOB: This Australian walks into an English pet shop with a koala bear on his shoulder. \"Where the hell did you get that thing?\" asks the shopkeeper. \"Down Under,\" says the bear. \"There are loads of these fellas there...\" SIMON GROOM Dear YOB, You said you would put up a sackful of software for the person who says I Am Stupid Stu And I'm Thick I Am as many times as possible. Alright I Am Stupid Stu And I Am Thick I Am X 1000,000. I know your answer will be that I am a thick idiot. Just one more thing will Robocod be out on the Game Gear. If yes, when will it be released? James Granger Wells, Somerset PS Your car is totally crap. SNOB: Jim old boy, I'd love to give you the goodies but unfortunately you failed to get the line right because you are a cretinous gob of pigeon spit after all. No, you're not a thick idiot. You're a brain-dead waste of water if you can't even read the mag properly and Robocod on the Game Gear will be released the very day you start making some sense BOB TODD Dear YOB I am ten years old. Your mag is brilliant and I have some questions I hope you can answer. 1. What does the dragon on the last world look like? 2. Have you ever reached the castle? 3. How many miniforts are there on world eight? Answer these questions or I will pay you a visit with my Chinese sword. Goodbye Apple pie. Jorgen G Lavik Haukeland, Norway. SNOB: 1.

Goodbye you waste of life. MASBAR LESLIE CROWTHER Dear YOB 1. When will these games come out on the U.K. SNES Final Fight, UN Squadron, Smash TV, Super Gouls and Ghosts, WWF and Contra Spirits? 2. When will the SNES Super CD be coming out? Will it be any good? Jamie French Barnet, Herts. SNOB: 1. Later. 2. Later. Yes. BILL TREACHER Dear YOB I've got a Sega Master System game (cartridge) up for sale but no one wanted it. It's called F-16 Fighter. I would like to have sold it half price but no-one wanted it. I don't want to sell it too cheaply because I only just got it for Christmas for .99 and I was wondering if you wanted to buy it half price? If so who shall I contact and please would you leave the telephone number? PS How much would you pay for it. PPS I'm Stupid Rob And I'm Thick I Am. Robert Thorpe Braintree, Essex. SNOB: F-16 Fighter! The rarest game of all time! When I read this just couldn't believe my eyes! It's the game I've always wanted and I couldn't get it anywhere! I was willing to pay a thousand pounds for the game and toured Britain trying to find a copy. All to no avail. Then you write in and my prayers are answered. F-16 Fighter! I was all set to offer you a thousand pounds, but then I found about a thousand copies under a dead kipper in the dustbin so now I don't need yours after all. LARRY GRAYSON Dear YOB, You wouldn't let it lie! Andrew Inkson, Bitterne, Southampton. SNOB: YOU wouldn't let it lie! CVG 042 "


"RONALD ALLEN Dear YOB I have a Nintendo and a Megadrive, so I read a couple of sad mags and CVG. In one of the sad Sega mags they had a feature on Sonic V Mario to see who the best games character in the whole world was. They said Sonic was, but Sonic is Sega so they would have been biased. Being as you represent both why don't you do a feature on Sonic and Mario because you won't be biased. Liam Barlow Bishop Aukland County Durham. SNOB: The best games character in the whole world is actually a cross between Mario and Sonic Moronic. He lives in this weird world called County Durham where everyone witters on about tabs, pets, hinnies, haways and other garbage and nobody there amounts to anything. Moronic's job is to generate a bit of excitement and save the day before it all goes horribly wrong and somebody calls him Liam NICHOLAS PARSONS SASHA DISTELL Dear YOB Dear YOB I have read the huge look CVG cover Here I am writing from \"backto cover and have to say that I was ward\" South Africa to very impressed.

In issues of CVG that I have read, you have only said one thing that has been funny, and that was when you said that the aussies are a bunch of saddoes. I'd like to like you to cut down your all too regular use of the word \"sad\" as you have obviously just discovered it and we all think you are an arrogant fool applying it to all who contribute to your mailbox. The word \"sad\" has been being used by people with lives for many many many months, so wise up! Just like to say my piece on the Amiga/Megadrive debate. They are both totally excellent and their owners should be proud to have either. Comparing them is a bit of a waste of time as they are really different machines altogether. In favour of the Amiga, it has many more uses than the Megadrive, but the Megadrive is the top games consoles at the moment and anyone who buys their machines soley for the games mustn't be all there if they invest in an Amiga. I know you'll take some serious mickey out of my letter so go for it. I've made my point. Get a social life. Love and kicks up the bum. Bill S Preston Wellingborough, Northants.

YEEEEAARGE WILLIE RUSHTON Dear YOB, I think you are the saddest person that I have ever heard of. You think you are totally cool just because you insult people. Anyway, please answer my questions: 1. Why are you so sad? 2. Will Super Mario 4 come out on the Amiga? 3. Will you be able to o trade in your old Game Boy for a new colour one? 4. Can I have a T-shirt? Christopher McGuire Harwood, Bolton SNOB: 1. Because you're not here for me to punch your lights out. 2. When hell freezes over. 3. Only if you live in Never Never Land. 4. Why should I? SNOB: Two thousand years ago they erected great pryamids towering into the sky, built vast battleships and sailed the high seas in search of adventure. Befriended at first by the Romans, they ruled the East for centuries before finding themselves cruelly stabbed in the back and fighting to the last in one of the great epic battles in the history of the Earth. Nowadays they can't even string two words together and spend all their time trying to impress people like me. Somewhere, sometime, something obviously went terribly wrong. GARETH HUNT Dear BOY, Seeing as you always slag people off for being illiterate, you could at least set them a good example. As lidly scanned the letters page of your June issue I noticed a spelling mistake that would have put the grammatical abilities of a concussed bee to shame! I have eclosed the incriminating evidence. I am, however, not surprised as your magazine is as full of mistakes as your string vest is full of holes! By the way, I've spelt your name backwards because you're probably dyslexic and will find it easier to understand. Katy James Pocklington, York BONS: eht das gniht tuoba ytak semaj si taht s'ehs hcum oot diputs ot krow tuo taht siht si nettirw sdrawkcab, dna nehw ehs seod yllanif giwt Il'ew lla eb hcum oot ysub gnivah a doog dlo hgual esuaceb! syawla hguoht notgnilkcoP saw eht epiwssa fo eht nretseW dirow dna ol dna dloheb ehs sevorp taht ti si. (AND AGAIN) Dear YOB, I don't suppose you get many letters from young mums (I'm 38) but I think your mag is great. Adam, my son, has it delivered now! It is much more interesting than the women's magazines have you ever read one?! Anyway, Adam is getting a Master System II for his birthday with Alex Kidd included. Please can you tell him which are the best games for him to save for? I've read that Sonic is good, but what about the others? Your knowledgeable advice would be greatly appreciated. I know you are a bit nasty to your correspondents but I bet your mum thinks you're a little angel. I would if you were my boy. Love and kisses Michelle Gibbons Offerton, Stockport YOB: Right, bog off big brother. Go and run the country or something, because I'm answering this question myself. Dear Mrs Orangutang, Who knows, I might just be your boy. Let's face it, your guess is as good as mine. Do you have greasy skin, an ugly face, a chin stubble, hairy legs and a big mouth? You do? MUM!

"HE COMPLEE GUIDE 10 I=1 ; / 'EM UPS FURY GE Devo PAUSE GR AND) COUP || :: ARE YOU HARD ENOUGH DEO GAMES "


"BENELI ZANGIEF THE HISTORY OF BEAT 'EM UPS. Ever since man first climbed down from the trees, he's been smacking people in the teeth. For several thousand years after that there were pub fights and wars all, over the place. Eventually computer technology caught up with weapons technology and took most of the fun out of it all, but after about 1980 computers put all the fun back in. Thanks to the miracle of modern science, even spotty weirdoes with anoraks can kick ass in downtown Shanghai. Video games were made for beat 'em ups. Shoot 'em up fans might dispute this, but let's face it even ripple lasers and homing missiles can't compete with the satisfying smack of a fist in the gob... (0 ) STREETFIGHTER 2 CAPCOM ARCADE/SUPER NES GUILE CRSA The Mother and Father of all fighting games, Streetfighter 2 is virtually faultless. Eight characters to choose from, tons of moves and quite possibly the best graphics in any video game ever. The range of techniques at your disposal is incredible and the strategy this creates is awesome. As a one player game, the challenge is enormous but with two players, this is the only video game that never, ever gets boring...ever. The basic plot is that a tournament is being held to decide who the world's greatest Streetfighter is. Ryu, the last winner has returned to try for the crown but so have many others. The fight has been controlled from the start by the mysterious M Bison. Many of the fighters have a score to settle with Bison but Ryu is only there for the fight. An epic of a game and one that redefines the genre it's part of and sets all the standards for the future. A Zangief's screw pile-driver is the strongest attack in the game, so keep him at arms lenght or suffer the consequences! Destination Thailand to face the might of Vega, the mysterious ruler of Shadolue! Y24 Guile's mid-air attacks leave E.Honda chewing farmac Besides Guile, only Chun li has the ability to throw opponents in the air, so watch out! ovazBRUTAL! HG2 "


"GVG FATAL FURY TERRY BOGARD) An expert OME SNK ARCADE/NEO GEO A Select one of three hero's. This title blatantly plagiarises Streetfighter 2 but with a couple of nice features that just about approach Capcom's classic in terms of playability. The story goes that SNK hired loads of Capcom programmers in an attempt to outdo the Japanese game giants. Fatal Fury is reasonable proof that this strategy might have paid off. Easily the best Neo Geo game available, it's more one on one action. There are two levels on the playfield so you can jump into the background to avoid blows. The other new feature is that two players can fight a computer opponent at the same time, ganging up on him to give him a pasting. The graphics are ace, the sound is fabby and all in all it's a decent stab at copying Streetfighter 2. A Joe lay's one on Tung Fu Rue. Tung is an expert at chinese kick boxing so don't get him ongry... JOE HIGASHI A young champion of kick boxing. A Andy uses one of his many special techniques to finish off Michael Max. A Master of the punch . BERT JUNGLESRUNG EICHTER SEREN REVENGE OF SEGA MEGADRIVE One of the first releases on the Megadrive and to date it's still one of the best! The game is a sort of sequel to the Shinobi coin-op and it takes the theme a whole lot further. Shinobi is Japanese for \"stealin\" which obviously means the art of stealth. Joe Musashi is the Ninja hero of the piece and has to stop some evil dictator or some thing. What this means to the player is that you get to smack loads of baddies in the gob. There are weapons galore to collect and loads of mysterious Ninja magic to use. A superb mixture of platform antics and martial arts. INTERNATIONAL KARATE SYSTEM 3 AMIGA/ST If you've got a 16 bit machine you need this game more than you need a disk drive. The best Karate simulator ever and the sequel to the second best. You control a Karateka as he makes his way through tons of ever harder opponents. If you get bored doing that (and you won't) you can play a two player game against a pal, the computer controls a third fighter just to make life a little more difficult for you. The animation is perfect and there are loads of interesting and amusing features. The addition of the third fighter is excellent and this must surely rank as one of the most playable games ever. A masterpiece and totally unmissable. The Super Shinobi in action against the machines in the Sega dassic. COMPETITIVE! 3 CVG "


"GIG BEAT 'EM UP STREETSUFRAGE SEGA MEGADRIVE Sega sold a lot of Megadrives by releasing this ace Final Fight clone. Again you can chooose from three heroes, although this time one of them is a girl. The graphics are impressive and this has one of the best soundtracks on the Megadrive. The gameplay is simplistic but incredibly addictive and you'll be playing this one long into the night. With two players working as a team you'll save the city in no time at all...unless you want to make things difficult for your pal. PAUSE PAUS legg KARATE CHAMP DATA EAST ARCADE IREM ARCADE/GAMEBOY/NES The game that started it all off. This brilliant twin joystick simulation is a fast and furious Karate game. You and a pal can slog it out or you can go through the various stages of a tournament against ever better fighters. The graphics are sharp and the gameplay is faultless. The addition of bonus rounds, including one where you have to fight a bull, are interesting diversions. A bit old and crusty but a real laugh. This is a bit of video game history and you might have to hunt the arcades to find a machine. This very simplistic looking arcade game was a real biggie when it was launched and had arcade fans waiting hours in line to play it. The object of the game was simple, walk to the end of each level, kick the baddies in and fight the end of level boss. Loads of jumping and kicking and a really addictive title that still holds up well today. NES and Game boy owners don't have to go as far as the arcades to play it because versions of the game are available on both machines. ovas NEVER SURRENDER! CG 4 "


"FINALIGE DVG CAPCOM ARCADE/SUPER NES Damno takes it easy The streets are full of scum and it's your job to clean up the city. Cody, Guy and Haggar are the three hardest dudes in town. Cody's girl has been kidnapped and she also happens to be Haggar's daughter. Guy is just along for the ride. Kick ass as you head into the streets of New York, killing villains and stopping crime. The graphics are slick, the action is fast and this is a bloodfest of epic proportions. Easily the highest bodycount of any beat 'em up and an unmissable treat! FIGHTING Haggar cleans the street's of scum on level one.. A The first bonus stage involves the destruction of a car belonging to one of Mad Gear's Cronies! ...then continues the job down in the subway! DOUBLE DRAGON GOLDEN AVE TECHNOS ARCADE/NES SEGA ARCADE/MEGADRIVE Final Fight got a lot of inspiration from this rather old arcade game. Billy and Johnny Lee are the heroes of the piece and they're out to rescue Billy's girlfriend. There are quite a few moves to discover and loads of traps to avoid as you walk through the horizontally scrolling city. Pick up knives and other weapons as the baddies drop them and kick ass all over town. Nobody messes with the Lee brothers and lives to tell the tale! An ace coin-op and a cracking NES conversion. Not strictly speaking a beat 'em up but worthy of a mention nonetheless, Sega's amazing coin-op has a medieval world of swords and sorcery as its setting. You play the part of a barbarian killer as he storms accross a barren wasteland to take on the mysterious Death Adder. Aiding him in his fight are a little dwarf bloke and a delectable barbarian she-bitch. Lots of kicking, head-butting and hacking as you slice through hordes of undead warriors.

"GIG BEAT 'EM UP WHEN DID IT ALL BEGIN? COMING Despite anything anyone sad will tell you, Data East started the beat 'em up phenomenon when they introduced us to Karate Champ. Considering it was probably the first proper beat 'em up, it was surprisingly complex. The graphics were brilliant for the time, with big sprites and smart animation. The game was for one or two players, each fighter had two joy. sticks(like Smash TV) and you used combinations of movements to perform the most well-known Karate moves. Top stuff and a smash hit in arcades up and down the country GOLDEN AXE 3 Everyone's favourite fantasy hack'n'slash has returned for a third episode. Developed by Sega using their 32bit CPU, Golden Axe 3 has amazing graphics and sound. Add to this, four-player simultaneous action, plus three times as many levels as the original coin-op you had better start saving your pennies! POWER ATHELETE Next up was an Irem coin-op which arrived just in time for the huge arcade boom in the early eighties, and some say it was responsible (along with Pac Man) for that boom. Kung Fu Master was the name of the game and it was, a hoot. You only had a few moves to use but there were literally hundreds of baddies to defeat. The game combined fast pace martial arts with some limited platform antics and it was a staggering success. Konami tried to emulate Karate Champ's appeal with Yie Ar Kung Fu more one-onone action but with attractive cartoony graphics. There were loads of baddies to beat and each used a different fighting technique so real strategy was called for. For the next few years there were loads and loads of scrolling beat'em ups of little or no merit. The beat 'em up had a bit of a dark period with loads of crap and nothing worthwhile. Then, from nowhere came the game that would change all that and start a chain-reaction that still hasn't stopped. Streetfighter. Capcom unveiled this beauty with a custom built machine that featured spring mounted rubber pads instead of fire buttons. The harder you hit the pad, the harder your character punched or kicked on screen. It was a roaring success and Capcom followed it up first with Final Fight and then ultimately with the impossibly brilliant Streetfighter 2. Street, fighter 2 used exactly the same gameplay as the first game but with more moves, more characters and stupendous graphics. To date it's the most succesful arcade machine ever and it's still selling. Home computer games and consoles have cloned and licensed every single game listed above and with varying degrees of success. The best of the bunch included Way of the Exploding Fist, International Karate Plus and now Streetfighter 2 on the Super NES. What's next? Capcom recently unveiled a tweaked version called Streetfighter '92, but rumour has it that Streetfighter 3 is in production and that it's going to blow our butts, AYER ENE \"GUSTAV\" 11 T.MN BAHZAESoff. And where will you read about that first, eh? Where do you think? Right here! CVG 6 "


"U 000076 LVE THE CVG GUIDE TO MARTIAL ARTS TOON, 21:BATTLE ADS In case you want to learn how to do all this stuff for real, here's a guide to real martial arts for top hard men. KARATE: This art was developed in Okinawa when the island's people were banned from using weapons by the Japanese. As a result they got dead hard and the Japanese decided to adopt the art. Lots of scientific punching and kicking with a good dose of zen discipline thrown in. Fairly easy to learn but difficult to master, Karate is good way to keep fit and be dead hard. There are loads of different styles but they're all very similar. KUNG FU: Chinese through and through, most Kung Fu styles rely on low kicking and punching and many tend to use animal movements for inspiration. Tends to avoid blows to the head regarding legs and body as more important targets (as well as naughty bits). Very tricky to learn and more emphasis on technique than physical fitness. Quite good fun but very time consuming. Bruce Lee did it though, so it must be good. GOLDEN FIGHTER AIKIDO: A real cracker this one and it's the art used by Steven Seagal (out of Nico and Marked for Death). Aikido uses throws, locks, kicks and punches and looks spectacular. You can flip a bloke over, break his arm and knock him unconcious just by twisting his wrist (probably) and girls love it. It can be very dangerous if used in the wrong hands and it's dead hard to learn but the results are groovy. Even fat blokes can do Aikido. JUDO: The sad lad of the pack, Judo was invented by the Japanese version of Baden Powell who reckoned that Jujitsu was too violent. He took out all the good bits like stamping and biting and punching and concentrated on the wrestling parts. That said, most judo enthusiasts are dead fit and well hard, so they don't care. 12-meg fighting action courtesy of Culture Brain. Choose one of eight characters and battle against a friend or the computer. From what we've seen Golden Fighter looks ace so keep your eyes glued to CVG for the definitive review soon. FATAL FURY COMBATRIBES SNES owners are in for a treat as a flurry of excellent coin-op combat games are being converted as we speak. These include SNK's Fatal Fury and Combatribes, a fabby Double-Dragon style game from Technos. CONTENTO! KEEP OUT BWAY Dain, I almost lost it was a Loon. O H AHAR 7cVG "

Paul would dearly love to include your hints, cheats, maps and solutions in his weighty column.

Hurrah! CHEAT MODE AMIGA XENON 2 An oldie-but-goodie, Xenon 2 has been played to bits by Amrik Sohal of London E15, and Cor Blimey he's found this great cheat! Pause the game and type RUSSIAN AIR (with spaces). Then unpause and hit N to skip a stage. roads to its end, away from the hub, and destroy the large buildings there (Mineheads or CPU). Fly back to the hub following the road, and take the next road to the left. Repeat the process until 100 per cent is achieved. There are five spokes, but not all of them need to be completed to reach 100 per cent. EPIC Mixed opinions all round for this Ocean 'epic', but Jason O'Keefe and Tim Moggeridge from Dorchester, Dorset seem to have enjoyed playing. They have, after all, completed the game and come up with a most excellent players' guide! MISSION ONE MINEFIELD Shoot the mines by zooming up to them and using your lasers. You need to score 100 per cent while making your way to the planet. If you get through the minefield before making 100 per cent, turn around and shoot some more. One Rexxon ship must also be destroyed. When you get 100 per cent, if it is green, you need to head for the planet. It will then go red, signifying mission complete. MISSION TWO MINING COMPLEXES The main percentage on this mission is given for destroying the MCP's, which are tall, octagonal buildings that turn black when destroyed (make sure you hit the top part as well) there should be three of these. To find them, follow the double road that runs around the complex (not the monorail). Also, shoot low octagonal buildings with white flames above them. If desperate for the odd 1 per cent, fighters can be shot down. MISSION ONE TRACKING STATION Fly towards the purple target dot at top right. This is the generator. Shoot and destroy this first (both parts) and then go back for the Tracking Station the purple dot toward the centre of the map. NB: The generator creates a field around the station to protect it. MISSION THREE \"GLORY This is the first Epic space battle. To complete this you must shoot enough enemy ships to get 100 per cent. These are the ones with downward-pointing wings, blue canopies and orange guidelines. Look for larger ships with necks, as these give a higher percentage when destroyed. Try to get as close as possible. Pressing HELP tends to direct you to larger ships. Try to attack waves of enemies instead of picking out individual ships. To locate them at a distance, look for orange dots (their afterburners). MISSION TWOCPU/SPACEPORTS Fly toward the centre of the map, then find the road system. This is like the spokes of a wheel heading toward the hub. Follow one of the MISSION FOUR MAGMA CANNON Head for the two black dots on the map near the top, then press HELP to get a bearing (approx 210). Follow this heading, at low alti"


"tude, and destroy cannon. Do not mistake steel-looking mountain tops for the gun, and ignore enemy fighters, as time is precious. MEGADRIVE MISSION FIVE GALACTIC STORM This is the next big battle and, again, you must get 100 per cent by shooting lots of enemy spacecraft. Again, go for the big 'uns as time is tight. Follow the same callsign as for the Glory mission. FINAL BLOW Not the finest title ever to grace the Megadrive, but at least Robert Morse of Rochdale, Lancs, has found it in his heart to send a fair-to-middling cheat. On the Game Over screen, press UP then START for an extra credit. RANNA 1993 PAHARE CECCO 03 000140 Detroit Kuid MISSION SIX COMMAND CENTRE The target is almost straight up the map.

Tactics should be the same as those in previous battles. Donald cecce 02 0002501 MISSION EIGHT COMMAND SHIP Fly to the large, purple target that appears on the radar after taking the heading given by pressing HELP. Use PHOTON 1 (self-targeting missiles) to shoot the ION VENT (little yellow box) above the afterburners. When this has been hit, a message will tell you to use the COBALT weapon. Fly away from the mothership to a safe distance before firing the Cobalt. Once you've fired, run like hell. DESERT STRIKE Oh what a lovely game! Gulf War fun and hilarity abounds in this fine EA cart which has been played to death by Adrian Leung of Brentwood, Essex and he's found a useful tip during play, too! Go to Campaign on the main menu and enter the password TQQQLOM. You will start the game with five lives instead of two. Gesce 000550 TIGER HELI Nettleton's top tipster, Ben Wilson, comes to the rescue of all those who seem to lose their lives faster than England lost the European Championships! At the start of the game, press B to select Hard. Hit START two times. You will be asked to press the START button. Instead, keep pressing A until the credits in the bottomright hand corner have increased to 99. GENERAL TIPS 1. Fly low over planet surfaces. 2. Use lasers to destroy small enemy fighters. 3. Get as close as possible to all targets. 4. Use photon torpedoes to shoot large buildings. 5. Use torpedoes if running out of time in the minefield. 6. On mission seven, there is plenty of time to go sightseeing. 7. Don't forget that you can refuel/re-arm by pressing ENTER on the numeric keypad. And if you're such a sad blaster that you can't get anywhere even with these fine tips, then try the following codes to each level, courtesy of someone in Rowlands Gill, Tyne and Wear, who's forgotten to send his name. ber of points. You will find yourself running down a length of rope, at the bottom of which is an extra life and a lethal drop. Collect the life and allow yourself to fall off the edge. You shall then find yourself repeating the process of going up the nests and down the rope, collecting more and more points. Your lives are not affected because of the spare at the end of the rope and, every time you collect all the money bags, you receive 22,000 points and there's an extra life to be had for every 100,000 collected.

"ARCADE TOP RACER Whether you know it as Top Racer, Top Gear or simply the SNES version of Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge, this is a great game. So thinks Roger Wright of West Bromwich, West Midlands, who's found the password to the last level. What is it? Try entering VALHALLA. GEAR 3RD RAD MOBILE It's about time you started sending arcade cheats again! Stuart Cameron from Glasgow, Scotland sets the ball rolling with a handy hint for Rad Mobile! At two points during the game you will find yourself driving along for about ten seconds in-between stages. The timer will stop and nothing will happen until you start the next stage. When this happens, the left-hand side wall will turn brown. Simply drive into the brown wall to skip approximately seven stages. This happens after stage three and another point later into the game. GEAR: N3 GEARE 19TH 00'00 STREETFIGHTER 2 AND '92 CVG's been getting a load of weird and wonderful hints and tips for Streetfighter 2 and Streetfighter '92 in the arcades. Some are ridiculous, but the ones you'll find here have each been confirmed so we're going to print them. First to get them to us was Mark Hankin of Truro in Cornwall. Take it away that man! 1. If you complete the game on one credit without losing or drawing any rounds, you'll get to see pictures of the programmers instead of the characters kicking each other in. Don't know about you, but I know what I prefer... 2. If you complete the game on one credit and score two perfects on Balrog, Vega, Sagat and Bison, then on the next credit you'll be able to select one of them to play. 3. Guile has a secret move which completely protects him against computer controlled opponents Zangief and Vega. To activate the move, first jump at the opponent using a medium power kick. As soon as Guile lands on the ground, push left and heavy kick so that he kicks upside down. As soon as this kick hits the opponent (and it doesn't matter if it was blocked), push right and heavy punch. If you've done it right Guile should now be standing on one leg and the computer's playing will go nuts, without any success. To get out of the move just somersault kick. This tip only seems to work when you're facing right.

"HE H SUPER NINTENDO ILTILL PLATFORM NTENDO KRUSTYS SUPER FUN HOUSE TILL TOO 24098 BY ACCLAIM .99 Good gorsh! Krusty gets lost! FEATURING THE SIMPSONS! 003 SEGA GENESIS LICENSED BY SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD SO PLAY ON THE SEGAGE MEET THE SIMPSONS ey everyone you know me! I'm nKrusty the Clown (out of The Simpsons) and I'm a cynical old comic who rips off the kids with blatant scams and a low quality TV series. Bart Simpson idolises me, but something's gone horribly wrong! Krusty's amazing Fun House, has been overrun by foul smelling purple rats. Naturally I'm furious. I'll pound 'em, fry 'em and Krusterize 'em! The rats must be stopped at any cost and I'll have to build bridges, make steps and lead them to their doom with my patented Krusty The Klown's Krazy Krusterizer! Bart, Homer and the rest of the gang are happy to destroy the rats, but it's down to you to get them to the machine. Flying pigs, aliens and snakes are just a few of the baddies standing in your way, so get Krusting as fast as you can! \"Bart's hero is one of my fave characters and his scheming money making plans have me in stitches. Fortunately though, Acclaim have done him justice with a brilliant mixture of platform action and Lemmings-style puzzles. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a Lemmings rip-off because it's entirely different. Some of the puzzles are real brainteasers with amazingly difficult problems to solve. As far as the platform action is concerned, the Krusty sprite handles just right and he's a dream to control. The music is very similar to the Simpsons TV themes and the amazing sampled speech makes the game a laff riot. The graphics are simple throughout, but the backdrops on later levels are spectacular. All in all this is a top treat for platform addicts and puzzle fans alike. One of the most addictive games on the SNES and worth its weight in Krusty Brand Cereal Products\".\" CVG 062 FRANK O'CONNOR Krusty is a TV character in the fictional world of Bart Simpson. He's Bart's hero and spends his time hosting a kids' TV show with his apprentice, Sideshow Bob. Also featured in Krusty's show are Itchy and Scratchy, who have a cartoon slot where they spend their time throwing bite-size bombs down each other's throat. Krusty, meanwhile, is raking in the cash as he sells Krusty brand products to gullible kids. Bart cares not a jot and wants more than anything to appear on Krusty's show and in Bart Versus the World, he gets to do just that. TIITEIT Bart takes out a hairy fiend! "


"Get those rats now! TOP CVG CRUELTY TO ANIMALS HANDI Here at CVG we recommend that you have a mature attitude and don't really kill rats. The instruction booklet tells you just the same thing. The machines do all manner of terrible things to the rats like bash them on the head, electrocute them and blast them to ashes with a massive laser cannon. This is all very funny but it makes you wonder why Krusty doesn't just lay a few traps or put down some poison. The worst thing that can happen to the rats is that they get trapped and you don't have enough blocks to get them out again. At this point you have to use the Last Resort button, which abandons the level at the cost of one life. CE SA BLOCKOUT! Strewn among the various levels are different kinds of block. The most common are Mario style bonus blocks which, when kicked, reveal all manner of amazing goodies including extra weapons, bonus points and occasionally extra lives! Other blocks can be kicked along the floor to make stepping stones for the rats. The most useful kinds of block however, are the ones you can pick up. You can carry one at a time and drop it anywhere you like. You can use these as steps or even complicated ladders and most screens require them to lead the dreaded rats to the machine. \"Nobody knew quite what Acclaim were hiding up their sleeves when they announced that Krusty's Fun House was on the way, and it's certainly not what anyone expected! This game is a real treat, containing some fiendish puzzles and finely balanced gameplay to keep you superglued to the joypad for hours. Easy to get into and very hard to put down, the sheer variety of the puzzling action will keep you coming back again and a again. People are bound to compare this with Lemmings, but that's unfair because they're actually very different games and any similarity comes from coincidence more than anything. For me, the game's only bummer is its sound the music is so repetitive it can become annoying and sound effects can be very basic at times. That aside, this game is a winner. Krusty's Fun House may be a right old laugh, but it's a seriously good game for puzzling platform fans and ranks right up there with the best of them. Bart fans will freak over this!\" TIM BOONE 373 In the pipe and off to their deaths! TAUERN STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 85 PIPES, SPRINGS AND OTHER THINGS! GRAPHICS % SOUND % 80 GAMEPLAY % 89 VALUE % 89 There are loads of useful gadgets in Krusty's house and you can use these to get the rats closer to the machines. Pipes are the most common, and if a rat walks into one he'll be sucked through a maze of tubes and ejected at the other end. Sometimes this backfires and the rats are trapped, but most of the time they are very helpful. Springs catapult the rats into the air while blowers, well, blow them! Krusty can use all of these to his own advantage and the springs and blowers can help him jump higher and further. Hurrah! OVERALL 87 063 CVG Krusty uses his balls! "

"GVG REVIEW GVG NINTENDO PLATFORM BY STORM .99 79 Steps, steps and erm... more steps. In a land of darkness there lies a Icity of towers. Here, the evil masters of the land of Castelian live. You are a small green blob with a big nose and not exactly the kind of bloke you'd expect to save the world. You can jump about one inch in the air and shoot harmless little globs of phlegm which isn't really too much use against the Legions of Doom. Yup, I'm afraid you're all going to have to use your brain. You'll have to figure out the best route to the top of the castle, using elevators, platforms and stairways to aid you. The rewards for reaching the top of the tower are vast, you might get some bonus points or even a high score. Hurrah! 09 | 1076 drona 1 USE IT, DON'T ABUSE IT The little green bloke has a very nasty challenge ahead of him and it's going to take a lot of wit and cunning to escape from the monsters and reach the top of the tower. You can walk up stairs as long as there's nothing on them because a collision with a baddie is invariably fatal. You can jump onto high platforms and use them as stepping stones, but the timing and coordination required may put you off a bit. Elevators will lift you to useful places (and sometimes dangerous ones) and Between each tower, you get the chance to rack up masses of bonus often end in a doorway.

Bum fluff! BONUS LEVEL BONANZA I remember this game on the C64 and what a treat it was. Revolutionary graphics (literally) and amazing Sound effects combined with an Po original game concept. The good news is that the NES version is almost identical, the bad news is that it hasn't aged well. The game really isn't suited to a console. Console gamers want smooth, fast action with loads to see and do. Castelian leaves no room for error and exploration is completely impossible. You either finish it in one sitting, or not at all. Sudden death happens all the time and once you've learned all the hazards and routes on sa level, it gets dead boring. Walking through a door and dying instantly is not my idea of a challenge. This game may have been an old classic, but nowadays it's just very sad. If you want to be frustrated and annoyed, buy it. Very poor indeed.

"RENEW CVE MEGADRIVE SPORT SIM BY SEGA .99 QARINO CHICAGO 20 IST QUARTER BASKETS OF BALLS SUPREME COURT There are quite a number of other basketball games available on the Megadrive including Arch Rivals from Acclaim, Jordan Vs Bird and Lakers Vs Celtics from EA and a few odd Japanese efforts. So if basketball's the game that does it for you you're a hell of a lot better off than, say, horseshoe throwing enthusiasts who haven't got anything at all. David Robinson is the best on the team., what a guy! Who's David Robinson, eh? One of America's hottest new basketball players, that's who. The only ones we've ever heard of are Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan and that's only because they have training shoes named after them. Sad fact is, we just aren't tall enough. All the big British teams are populated almost entirely with American and Canadian players. Basketball, in case you didn't know, is a non-contact team sport, the object being to drop the ball in a basket at either end of the court. You can't kick the ball, you bounce it instead. There are more fouls and penalties in Basketball than in any other game and as a result there's lots of stopping and starting. So get bouncing! ol* TOMSON 4 GHT:10 22 'S 1ST QUARTER GOTHICAGO 2E OD EVENING TOO MANY RULES Although the object of Basketball is quite simple, the game is almost ruined by loads of seemingly unnecessary interruptions. If you take more than two steps without bouncing the ball, you get booked for travelling and the opposition gets possession of the ball. If you hold onto the ball for more than five seconds without moving, you get booked for the Five Second Penalty and the other side gets possession. If you barge into a player, accidentally or otherwise, you get done for Charging. Guess what, the opposition get possession again. How's about this winning tactic just stand around a lot and wait for the ref to give you the ball... SSN \"The trouble with Basketball is that it's never ever made a good video game, o ever. This is no exception. The game should be fast and smooth but the court area is so small that you have very little time to make decisions. There's no way around it, that's just the way Basketball is. Having said that, Supreme Court is a fairly impressive try at recreating the thud of rubber on wood and the spang of balls on a backboard (ouch). The graphics are neat and detailed with well animated sprites, while sound is limited to a slow but funky tune and the odd sound effect. Supreme Court plays well enough, but the way the screen switches when you reach the centre circle is very annoying. Despite all that, this is one of the better basketball games for the Megadrive but only because the others aren't worth the effort. A nice try, but that's all.\" STRATEGY SKILL GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE OVERALL % 78 % 73 % % 70 ACTION REFLEXE FRANK O'CONNOR "


"FRIENDLY AMIGA SPORT SIM SENSIBLE SOCCER BY RENEGADE .99 LIVERPOOL JUVENTUS TONS OF TEAMS UP FOR THE A BLINDER OF CUPS A BENDER! kay, so England were a load of old tosh in the European Championships, but that won't sour our love of the national game, will it? Renegade and Sensible Software hope not, because they want big things with this! Sensible Soccer has been hailed as the one to knock the all-conquering Kick Off 2 from its lofty position of Best Footy Game Ever. Well now it's time to squash the hype and speculation and concentrate on the facts. Want to play as your favourite if you don't fancy playing in You must all know what Afterteam? No problem Sensible friendly matches all the time, touch is by now. Just in case, Soccer features a bank of one don't get into a tizz there's a we'll tell you anyway. It's a syshundred European club and load of different league and cup tem of bending the ball on-screen national sides, with each team competitions to participate in. by moving the joystick left or made up of real players. In each Club sides can enter for the right at exactly the same time as side are a number of stars, UEFA, Cup Winners and Eurotaking a shot. Kick Off 2 piodetermined by a star next to pean Cups, while international neered the system, and Sensible their name, and it's these lads teams can boot the ball about in Software have paid homage to its who really make a difference to the European Cup, League of success by using it in their game. your chances of success. And, to Nations and Euro Cup. And if Sensisoccer's aftertouch works keep your squad up to date, that's not enough for you, then in the same way as that of Kick there's the option to change the enter the Sensible Cup and tailor Off 2, so fans of Anco's fine title name of every player there is! the entire competition to suit should have absolutely no trouble your requirements rounds, getting to grips with it! Your fave players are at your competitors, type of pitch the disposal! lot. A cross to the right and it's a goal! G LIVERPOOL BRUCE GROOSELAAR 2 HEHOOTER 1189 WRIGHT ATTACK DE PLAY GAME VIEW OF 3 DAVID ELURROUS POS JONES RAPY VENISOR 14 DE MARSH osto IMCHAEL THOMAS 15 RUE FEDETT @ PAY ROUSHTOP: 10 JOHN EARNES HARE WRLTERS STEVE SCHIMNASIAN AN PUSA This really is one awesome football sim, which takes some elements of Kick Off 2 and mixes them with new ideas to create a sensational mix of strategic planning and raw arcade action. The fact that there's more of the pitch on-screen than in Anco's all-time great allows for a more tactical game, with the ability to plan intricate passing moves simply because you can see more players. The control system is far less difficult to learn than Kick Off, making Sensisoccer more appealing to those who pick up the stick and play for the first time. The sheer amount of options included is stunning, and what really impresses me is the fact that the Sensible lads have even managed to slot in the England European Championship squad. The big question is, of course, whether Sensisoccer manages to steal Kick Off 2's crown. No it doesn't, simply because it shouldn't. The two are different games that sit side by side on the computer football throne. Kick Off 2 scores on its breathtaking pace whilst Sensisoccer equalises with its strategic superiority.

"ARCADE ACTION! OUTRAGEOUS! Arcade King Jazza Rignall's got so much coin-op stuff to strut this month you won't believe your eyes! With all these goodies on the go, it's lucky he's got a pocketful of pound coins, a 12-volt battery, set of jump leads and anti-static boxer shorts to stand the excitement! Take it away that man! SPACE PIRATES HAMMING IT UP Anyone who's played Mad Dog McCree will instantly recognise the format of Space Pirates. In fact, they'll also more than likely recognise the \"actors\" many of them have swapped their cowboy boots and six-shooters for space suits and laser rifles to star in this new laser disk shooting game! It's basically exactly the same as Mad Dog McCree and its sequel Who Shot Johnny Rock. But instead of the western and gangster themes the action is set, as the title suggests, in space. The big problem with the game is that the sets and acting are both awful, and it's like watching Blake's Seven with a plastic gun in your hand. The other thing is that the game plays basically the same as the previous two, and the format just isn't as much fun as it was when it first appeared. Something definitely needs to be done to spice up the action, because this most certainly isn't worth  a go! cVG 076 "


"DERCOIER CO2 Irem have been very quiet of late, and certainly haven't captured the brilliance of some of their earlier coin-ops like R-Type, Dragon Breed and Hammerin' Harry. Well, I'm glad to say that things are looking much better with the release of Undercover Cops an everday story of your average future rozzer sent in to the bad side of town to take on a gang of complete psychopaths. As you might have guessed from the less than original storyline is that this is a horizontally scrolling beat 'em up in which one or two players take on the crazed loonies in true Final Fight fashion. Okay, so there are loads of games like this, but where this sparkles is in its action and exceitement. There's loads going on and the marvellous graphics and sound really give this a very distinct character. Definitely the best beat'em up of this type since Final Fight. If you see it, play it. If you don't, don't worry a Super Nintendo version will be released later on next year. You heard it here filrst! SUPER MARIO MARIO'S BALL ACTION! You've played his games, watched his TV programme, eaten his breakfast cereal, worn his underpants (ugh!)...now play his Pinball game! Yes, Mario mania continues unabated as Nintendo get together with Gottlieb and produce the first ever Mario game with balls. It's a pretty neat pin table and features a variety of ramps, drop targets and trick shots plus all the familar Mario tunes and sound effects. If you're a fan of the silverball who's dying to give his flipper fingers a workout, check this out! o coce GVG01 "


"Time 008. JUST TIME D REU 08.207 FRONT ROW PLAYER 1 Human's latest coin-op is a split screen racing game in which you drive a fast Formula One car around a series of race tracks. It's quite good fun, but the graphics aren't exactly brilliant and there are some handling flaws in the car which really shouldn't be there. Up until recently I've always taken playtesting at arcade level for granted, but these days with Megadrive and Super Nintendo games looking as good as, if not better than some arcade games, coin-op manufactuers really need to take a good, long, hard look at what they're doing and make sure that the games they produce are better than the games we can play at home. This one certainly isn't much more exciting than something like Road Rash or FZero... (EROITE RTU MAGROS Banpresto are certainly plumbing the depths of mediocrity this month with the release of Macross, the most yawnsome, bog-standard vertically scrolling shoot 'em up I've played since the last one! The action is dull, the graphics bland, the end-of-level bosses completely and utterly predictable and the extra weapons about as exciting as a wet weekend in Wrexham. Think I'm being harsh? Then play it and see if you don't fall asleep before you get the the second level boss! ON ENTERTAINMENT HUMAN 1992 BIG WEST 1982 BANPRESTO 1992 "

"G HOTSHOTS SPLATTERHOUSE 2 NAMCO MEGADRIVE amco's arcade classic Splatterhouse only ever turned up on the PC Engine. Well, the good news is that the sequel's all set for release on the Megadrive! The game is an incredible gorefest and features decapitated zombies, rotten corpses and murderous embryos and that's just the nice screens. The object of the first game was a bit confused but the intro screen showed you chasing a girl through a forest and it looked like you were trying to kill her. Unfortunately the undead got to her first and you have to fight your way through the dark recesses of a haunted mansion using fists, feet and weapons to kill the agents of evil! This gameplay has been retained and the sequel is basically a remix of the original with new levels and even more disgusting baddies. The graphics, as you can see, are disgusting with horrible monsters in disturbing detail. Just try bashing one of the decomposed cadavers with a stick and watch its guts spill out. Yeurch! Sega are going to release it officially very soon in an attempt to cut down on grey imports. The first game was a real hoot and this looks set to follow in its footsteps. Look out for a complete and full review in the next CVG! 999999999999999999999999999999999999 SCORE PAUSE SCORE PAUSE LIFE ITEM Tyy9s99999999999999999 LLEE ryggsyy999999999933 ITEM STAR CONTROL 2 Orbit: 14.62 0.U. mo: 0.32 atm Temp: 434° C Heather: Class 4 Factonics: Class 4 Nass: 0.17 e...

Just like the original, this sequel is absolutely vastand still includes the well-wicked oneon-one playoffs, beefed up with tons more ships to choose from! This will be pants wetting news to serious gamers who know just how good Star Control is and the rest of you will just have to take our word for it. Accolade say they've got big plans for the sequel boosting just about every area of the game and adding loads of extra challenges. And if this PC sequel is any. thing like as succesful as the first game you can bet, your bottom it'll be converted onto other machines. Hooray!

"FU HOTSHOTS ARCH RIVALS ACCLAIM O MEGADRIVE S gamesters Acclaim are taking a shot at the Megadrive basketball top spot with Arch Rivals, a simplified version of the game which has grown men dribbling all over the court. So what's so special about this one then? Try this there aren't any fouls! That's right, in this conversion of the arcade machine you can be as mean, miserable and downright dastardly as you like and the ref won't blow the whistle because, well, he doesn't exist! The boy in the black and white shirt's been given the night off, so you'll have to play rough to survive! As you can see from these shots, Arch Rivals is looking a bit of a laff. Acclaim say the game's not so much Basketball as Basketbrawl and promise all the thrills of the coin-op. Quite how the game plays without the trackball control of the arcader remains to be seen, so stay with us for the full lowdown pretty darned soon! RIALS DE DAVI PLAVER 1 PLATER 2 NO HARM, NO FOUL!!

"U HOTSHOTS PREMIERE CORE AMIGA O hose busy beavers down at Core have been up to their tricks again and are all set to unleash Premiere on an unsuspecting world. The game features the work of the same graphic artists behind the award-winning Heimdall, so you know it's gonna be good! The game is an eight-way scrolling platform romp set across six levels, featuring of all things a film editor called Clutch Cable who's so hard he can jump, kick and use loads of weapons against all and sundry! Why? Well, some bumhole's stole his film, and our man clutch has got to get it back! As you can see from these shots, the game features cartoon-style graphics and is already looking well wicked. What you can't see is the depth of gameplay and take it from us there's an awful lot to do! The CVG boys are really looking forward to this one, so check out these pages for the first full Review just as soon as we can! 025 BEST NIGEL MANSELL'S GRAND PRIX 0 1 AHEAD OUP GREMLIN AMIGA O EEEEEAAAOOOW! CVG doesn't ponce about in the pits when it comes to grabbing the greatest games and the biggest names so here we are with a gobsmacking first look at what could become one of the biggest numbers of the year Nigel Mansell's Grand Prix. In case you've been hiding in a dark hole and don't know any better, the boy Nige is a bit of a Brit hero right now stuffing everyone out on the track and making quite a name for himself by beating anything that moves. Sheffield gamesters Gremlin Graphics snapped up the Mansell license quite a while ago, and it turned into quite a coup when our Nige started to win everything in sight! As you can see from these scrummy screenshots, the game is already looking well wicked. What you can't see is the speed the game's running at but we have 'cos we're dead hard. With two cars on the track it's blindingly fast, and we've been told there will only be a fractional slowdown when all the other cars are included! Gremlin promise faithful reproductions of all 16 Grand Prix circuits and all the thrills and spills you'd expect. Obviously Mansell's is going to be up against Formula One, but we reckon the games shouldn't be seen as competition at all. Formula One is more of a simulation, while Mansell's is simply pick up and play. This could well be one of the biggest games of the year, so stay welded to this page and we'll bring you more just the moment we can. Keep this frequency clear! cG 092 "


"CVE ENERG ALIEN TE JLA ACCLAIM O MEGADRIVE t the time of going to press, the CVG boys haven't seen the movie yet but the word from America is that it's a bit crap really. Apparently the lack of guns in the movie is a real bummer. What's the point of all those monsters when you can't shove a pump action shotgun in their gobs, yell \"Eat This!\" and blow them to kingdom come? Well, here's the good news there ARE guns in the game! And they're not squirty little air rifles either We're talking serious military hardware here, with plenty of bullets, bombs and other things that go Boom. Looking at these screenshots you might think the game looks very similar to Terminator. Well, you'd be right. Not only does this game look like Terminator, but on the early demo we've seen it plays like it too! That said, there is plenty of action on hand and the game was still in the early stages. But we couldn't resist the temptation to show you how the game was getting on and rest assured we'll be bringing you more news very soon! ENERELE 12 FOOTBALL KID 166 00 OKRISALIS AMIGA 123456 neat thing about the game though, is the football. Football Kid dribbles the ball along and can kick it to pass obstacles or kill baddies. Power-ups can be colrisalis, the blokes who brought us Man United lected endowing the kid with the footballing prowess Europe, John Barnes and Graham Taylor's Soccer of world famous players.
