"UK Ona recent visit to London Bushnell filled his hotel room with his microchip menagerie. Besides the Petster cat, which will move around in response to handclap commands it will even purr to order---there is AG Bear, a teddy which talks back to you with electronic bear talk, and a range of hand puppets which all have electronic voices. There's a duck,gorillo, dolphin, turkey, frog and mosquito. But it is the Petster cats which are the stars of the range. It has 10 programmed commands which are controlled by claps or the voice. The cat will find you, go away, run around, turn left, right, go backwards, meow and purr when stroked. You can even take it for walks on a leash. Bushnell only halfjokingly suggests that his pets will evenutally replace the real thing. After all, he points out, they don't need food, won't make a mess and there's no need to worry about them when you go on holiday The electronic toys are being marketed by Bushnell's new company Axlon, based in Sunnyvale, CalfiforniaAmerica's fabled Silicon Valley. \"At Axlon, we believe that toys aren't just for children so we've designed everything we market to appeal to adults too. \"There's no reason why grown-up people, who are young at heart, can't enjoy sophisticated and loveable toys of their own if they don't have children of their own, or their kids have grown up. \"Our concepts also fall into the 'executive toy' segment of the market.\" says Bushnell. But what next for the pioneer of video games? Has he thought about producing new games? \"When I do something,\" he When I do something, he says, \"I like to do something first. If I returned to the video marketit would be with something revolutionary.\" The Pelster Deluxe costs around .95 and the Petster at .95. AG Bear will set you back .95. lt's cute. It's cuddly. It's a cat. And it also happens to be computerised. Meet the Petsters, the latest in electronic toys from Nolan K Bushnell, the wizard who pioneered the electronic games revolution back in the 1970s with Pong, the TV tennis game. Bushnell, a 42-year-old bearded American, went on to found the Atari empire. In 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Brothers for a cool 28 million dollars. As part of the sale he agreed not to develop any electronic toy or game for seven years. B ut now that seven years is up and Bushnell, widely acknowledged as the man who introduced adults and children alike into the addictive delights of joystick juggling, is back with his high-tech toys. Sales of Bushnell's battery powered furry friends in the US reached 15 million dollars in just six months.

It's fantastic and it's going to be the hottest Amstrad game since Sorcery. It's called Crafton and Xunc and will be released in the UK by PSS-better known for their wargames. Crafton was created by Remi Herbulot whose other claim to fame is Macadam Bumper, the pinball simulation. In fact the punk featured on Bumper's loading screen plays a star part in this extremely colourful and totally addictive arcade adventure. But who are Crafton and Xunc anyway? Crafton is a sort of super secret agent android. Xunc is his sidekickone legged, large headed podocephalus. Crafton wears a silly ski-hat which makes him look a bit like Noddy. Anyway, the basic idea of the adventure is that the world is being threatened by a monster weapon and Crafton has to prevent all that destruction by discovering the control chamber Larxas, the all powerful world ruling computer, and destroy it using a special code. Crafton must discover the code by finding eight scientists within Zarxas complex. The game follows pretty traditional 3D arcade adventure style but with really colourful and exciting graphics. If you've got an Amstrad then as soon as you see this game-get it! Watch out for C+VG's special Crafton and Xunc map and our inside look at more French games. "

But never fear ---Martech is here! With help from Heather Couper, President of the British Astronomical Association but better known as presenter of Channel 4's The Planets series, Martech are planning to take you on a voyage of discovery through our Solar System. The Planets features some stunning graphics based on the pictures beamed back to Earth by Voyager during its progress through space.

"CHIG PREVIEW KODAK EN 100 000 2ND IN stands for Visitors. V stands for TV series. V stands for the latest licenced game from Ocean. You've all seen the glossy adverts appearing in C+VG for several months now. Was the game going to be another Streethawk or Knightrider we asked ourselves? Lots of pretty adverts but no sign of a game? We decided to take a trip down to the south coast seaside town of Brighton to discover if the game of the TV series was really taking shape. We're glad to report that V DOES exist-more to the point it's looking good. Very good. If you've not seen any of the V series-which was launched with three movie length features back in 1984-here's a brief rundown of the plot. There's this bunch of alien Visitors who come to Earth. They start off being quite friendly. All they want is some water for their dehydrated planet, they say. Everything looks pretty cool --us Earthlings are lulled into a false sense of security. After all these aliens look remarkably like refugees from Dallas and Dynasty all glowing tans and whiter and white smiles. But it all goes sour when someone discovers that these aliens are really Lizards cunningly disguised as humanoids with some amazingly lifelike latex masks! And what's worse, they've got a sweet tooth for honey coated human beings for breakfast. The water is just a side issue what they REALLY want is human flesh! ARGHHH! Well, are we going to take this lying down guys? Of course not and a resistance movement is formed to stop the Vistors taking over Earth and turning it into a giant fast food factory.. Meanwhile back at the game-which is being written for the Spectrum, 64 and Amstrad by the Softstone team of programmers under the direction of games designers Tony Knight and Grant Harrison you take on the guise of resistance leader Mike Donnovan. Mike is armed with a high powered laser to deal with the many robot guards which inhabit the V ship. He also has acquired an alien Communi-Puter which enables him to hack into the mothership's computer and pick useful intelligence information. He can also use his Communi-Puter to send false messages to the computer and upset the alien security system within the ship. But this can be dangerous as the computer can then pin-point his position within the ship. Below the main screen are the information/message window which displays messages coming from the ship's computer. You can hack into this and play about with the messages. This is also used as the \"code cracking\"window. Centre screen is a status readout with a clock which uses \"alien\" digits which you have to interpret, a score readout in normal numbers, a lives left indicator plus bar-graph power readouts for you oxygen and laser energy. Alongside these are the Communi-Puter's function keysagain represented by alien creatures. You have to work out what they mean and what they do. The graphics and animation on all three versions of Vare excellent. The Donnovan character owes a bit to Impossible Mission but instead of performing an acrobatic somersault he can do a really nice judo style roll along the ground to outwit the robot enemies. You'll be able to play the game on two levels -either as a straight shoot'em up or as an out an out stragegy game. You can get high scores doing both. But the ultimate challenge will be to destroy the reactor and computer centre in the fastest possible time-escaping safely as well of course. V is a huge game with enough depth to keep you glued to your small screen for months. But you're going to have to wait a bit longer for it. So start saving the .95 you'll need for a copy now. You won't regret it. these icons calls up other options or windows which Sinclude various types of useful information These icons marked out on our screen shot include SEARCH: Permits investigation of alues and objects received from outerspace from atienlife COMPUTER Includes options of: a) Suspended animation and travel to current destination planet farcade section). b) Assistance with detachable Tanding craft for attempted landing on planet surface. arcade section).

You move a cross hair over planet you wish to select as current destination and the name and distance will be displayed on the instrument panel. b) Short range map displays current planetary systems showing satellites/ moons, etc. DATA: Displays in animated form wherever possible, data of current planet. Includes: Gravity -comparison with Earth. Sidereal Period (Earth days). Sidereal Rotation Period (days or hours). Density and radius. O INFORMATION: Text/graphic based information about current planet, to include general descriptions, suitability for life forms survival, etc. The icons are ranged down the right and left hand side of the screen and are accessed using the joystick or keyboard to move a pointer. The centre of the screen is devoted to a main view of the planet you are visiting either from a geostationary orbit, or after you've landed, from ground level. Graphic artist Malcolm Smith used NASA pictures from Voyager to get the surfaces of each planet looking as accurate as possible. Beneath the main screen is an instrument panel which relates to the mothership or landerdepending which craft you are using. Heather Couper commented: This is terrific. I didn't think you'd be able to cram the whole Solar System inside a Spectrum!, The graphics are great the whole idea is just brilliant. And if it makes more people interested in astronomy, well that's greattoo! More than a game, not just a simulation The Planets wil grip your imagination and take you boldly where no computer game has gone before The Planets will be available from March for the Spectrum at .95 with Amstrad , and BBC versions to follow.

Tau Ceti will quite simply blow your minds! A big claim? Well, we don't think so. It's the game that has everything a true games addict could ever want. There's strategy, zapping, fun and excitement all in one package. And if you've got a disc drive you should get hold of Tau Ceti Plus, a mega-mix of the game created by programmer Pete Cooke, with extra added features. Here's what the game is all about. Tau Ceti, one of our G-type stars colonised by Earthlings in the year 2050, has been decimated by a vicious plague called Encke's Syndrome. The few remaining colonists have fled, leaving the robot maintenance systems in operation. When a cure is discovered, the decision is taken to recolonize Tau Ceti. The first expedition, however, finds a malfunctioning defence system, damaged by a huge meteor and is destroyed. You volunteer to go alone in an armed ground skimmer to return the defence system to normal operation. Your task is to search the devasted cities of Tau Ceti and collect the necessary hardware to shut down the massive fusion reactor in Centralis that fueled the planet in order to shut down the malfunctioning defence systems. The defenders come in the shape of flying saucer craft called Huntersof varying you to see where you are and where you can travel to. Each city is connected by a series of \"jump pads\" which enable you to take your Skimmer from city to city. The map shows you these routes. Moving a cursor over the name of the city and hitting the fire button enables you to get a readout of the city's status. You can even ask your computer to FIND you a specific city and tell you all about it if you wish. The RODS commands is a bit like the \"pocket computer\" part of Impossible Mission. You need to find all the rods to be able to knock out the Centralis reactor. This game has some really nice touches. Try landing without slowing down and you bump along the ground! Shoot a guided missile at a retreating Hunter and you'll see it explode on the horizonjust like in Bugs Bunny cartoons when the villian is running away and Bugs chucks a stone which hits him just as you think he's escaped out of the frame! The main difference to the Spectrum original come in the shape of enhanced graphics like opening and shutting airlock doors, improved instrumentation etc and improved sound effects. The game play is just as addictive and we'll repeat our summing up from the original review back in December. If you only buy one game this year make it Tau Ceti.

The murderous mayhem which now monopolises a multitude of minds across the country is becoming slightly tedious. Unfortunately you can have too much of a good thing. However, taken individually each of these game are good fun. In Who Dares Wins II, armed with an automatic rifle and grenades, you must battle through eight battlefields merrily slaughtering everything that moves in an effort to free compatriots held prisoner by the \"forces of oppression.\" And despite qualms over the morality of death and destruction, Who Dares Wins Il is satisfying, addictive and fun to play Amstrad owners could do worse than put Who Dares Wins on their hit list of games to buy C+VG  Graphics Sound Value  Playability SPITFIRE 40 ILIH C+VG Base, Tango, Delta and Zulu The enemy must be tracked, engaged and destroyed.

It's summer 1940 and you play the part of a newly-qualified pilot stationed somewhere in the south east of England. With practice and success in combat missions you can rise through the ranks to reach the rank of Group Captain, gaining medals such as VC, DSO and DFC. There are two main screens to the game-the cockpit controls and view from the cockpit. The controls include all the normal stuff including air speed indicator, fuel guage, compass, engine rev counter, altimeter and artifical horizon. Pressing the Mkey brings up a map of the south east of England and pressing Nexpands the map to show greater detail ie the position of your craft and the enemy. There are three flight modes -practice, combat and combat practice. Practice just allows you to get used to the handling of the Spitfire, develope take off skills and perfect aerobatics. Flight Combat gives the battle experience without the bother of finding the enemy aircraft. While playing the Amstrad version of this mode the destroyed enemy aircraft would sometimes stick to the cockpit like a dead fly. The Combat mode starts off by giving you mission instructionsthe number of enemy aircraft sighted, their distance in miles, bearing from the runway and height.

For those of you who did not read January's C+VG, Enigma begins where Shadowfire left off. You and the rest of the E-Team have captured General Zoff, the well known republican dictator, and have been ordered to escort him to the Emperor's homeworld to face trial. But before being captured, Zoff was still able to declare war on the Empire. Anyway, all goes according to plan until the E-craft is about to cross the Imperial border when ... (the following is far too gruesome for a family mag and has therefore been censored! Ed.) The next thing you remember land we're prepared to print) is waking up next to the twisted remains of the E-craft which, you quickly deduce, must have crashed landed. Almost impossibly a message is still visible on the ever fading computer monitor. It reads,\"... planet identified as Syylk's homeworld. Our location is an underground complex beneath the capital city. Syylk's people, the insectoids, are locked in battle with reptiloid storm troopers loyal to Zoff. Communications scan reveals republican destructor tugs are due off planet at indeterminate time. Their arrival will signal this planet's elimination. My recommended course of action: 1) Locate insectoid leader and convert to ally. 2) Only spaceworthy craft is located in reptiloid area. Find it. 3) General Zoff heading for this spacecraft. Apprehend in the name of the Emperor. 4) Insectoid alarm system will signal approach of destructor tugs and your elimination. The upper half of the screen is your window into the game through which you can see the whole of the underground complex on Syylk's homeworld. The icons in Enigma are divided into discreet sections. Characters in location/ character in play: Here you get a reminder of which team member you're controlling at the moment as well as a graphical list of all the other characters in the same room. Movement icons: One of two ways that members can be intentionally moved about. Also included in this section of the screen are the music on/off toggle and the 'to status screen\" icon. The status screen serves as a pause game function but also gives information as to the health, or otherwise, of your team. Objects in location: Anything that can be picked up will be shown here. Hint if you are unfortunate enough to lose a team member you can still pick up all the objects they were carrying when they were killed Objects carried by character in play: Apart from providing vital information this section is used in conjunction with the command section. Command: These include pick up, drop, activate, reload, defend and hold, hound to death and mindprobe. Objects you may find include Keycards: There are a number of these dotted around the place each of a different colour. Toolkit: This was no doubt dropped by a fleeing insectoid but will prove most useful in Sevrina's hands. Red fish: Although closely related to the herring they are not! Ballistic magazine: This is your basic ammo although you are advised to find an alternative very quickly if you want the enemy to take you at all seriously. The green keycard may help you here! Explosive: Good for party tricks but not easy to use effectively when the heat is on, DON'T forget to drop it once the As you may have guessed you're not going to get far unless you do make a map. Denton have not gone out of their way to make this an easy task. Moving from room to room can be a very disorientating experience as you view may not always be south to north as you would expect. Sometimes rooms are seen from the west wall looking east. The problem with Enigma is that the deeper you delve into it the more shallow it reveals itself to be.

"C+VG APR Software REVIEHS HARDBALL D INALIS Machine: CBM 64 Supplier: US Gold/ Accolade Price: .95 cassette/ .95 disk What's the next best thing to actually being at a Baseball game? You've guessed it playing Accolade's Hardball! This is a truly exciting sports simulation, even if you don't know the first thing about Baseball America's national game. If you watched the highlights of the World Series on TV at New Year you'll know just how exciting the real game can be. And Hardball manages to capture all the thrills of the game. Fortunately C+VG's reviewer was lucky enough to have had the rules explained to him by an American friend and watched a game between the Oakland As and Chicago a year or so ago. So he slapped on his As hat and prepared for battle. But the game is simple enough to get into even if you don't know what's really going on. You can learn all the subtleties as you play-so don't be put off. The game is not unlike cricket -except faster! The basic idea is for one team to score more than their opponents. Each team takes turns batting and fielding. Simple ain't it? Once the game is loaded you can select a variety of game option combinations such as which team you want to playhome or visitor, one or two players etc. The four screens displayed during the game are: the Manager's Decision screen, the pitcher/batter screen, Left Field view, and Right Field view. The game begins with the Manager's Decision screen. It will also appear if a player presses the space bar on the keyboard anytime during the pitcher screen. In this Manager's Screen, pressing the space bar will \"Play Ball\". This screen will display a selected line-up for both teams. The team in the field (defence) has five choices: Player Substitution, Exchange Positions, Outfield, Infield (Normal or Double Play), Intentional Walk The team at bat can choose between Player Substitution or Exchange Positions. Play begins with the pitcher's screen depicting the pitcher, batter, umpire and crowd in the background. Using the joystick, the player representing the pitcher (field team) may select a type of pitch as displayed on the bottom of the screen. The other player, representing the team at bat, may select his offensive strategy by holding the fire button down while moving the joystick to select one or more options. When the ball is hit, the receiving fielder will be identified by flashing. The player may use the joystick to position the fielder (back, left, forward, right) to catch the ball. Once the ball is caught, he is presented choices as to where to throw the ball (2nd, 3rd, home or 1st). These throw-ins are really the only naff thing about this game -on a long throw from the outfield and the ball tends to go into slow motion, wobbling about like a balloon until it finally reaches its target. This is a minor gripe however, The attention to detail is what really makes this game. The way the runners and fielders slide in at the bases just like the real thing. The big, colourful graphics and great animation. The roar of the crowd when you hit a home run. Terrific stuff, even for the unitiated. Multi-load games like these which are essentially disk based -is usually a problem for tape owners. But Hardball is an exception. When you need to reload a section you get a prompt to start the tape and the loading takes no time at all. So don't be put off if you don't have a disk drive. Hardball has strategy, action and extra added addictiveness. So grab your glove, Charlie Brown and head for the pitcher's mound this instant! Graphics Sound C+VG Value HIT!

"9 C+VG APR Solbtware. REVIEHS9 TWISTER SPINDIZZY Machine: Amstrad Supplier: Electric Dreams Price: .95 For some time now C+VG has been going on about Sorcery and Sorcery+ as being the \"state of the art\" for the Amstrad. Well Spindizzy from Electric Games is shaping up to take that title. Comparisons will be made with the arcade hit Marble Madness and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne House's Gyroscope. In Spindizzy you control a spinning top through a vast number of screens. In the preview version supplied to C+VG there were 380. The aim is to collect jewels against the clock. Every jewel collected pushes back the clock. But some appear in the seemingly most inaccessible places that at first it appears almost impossible to reach them. For example, some are situated on the top of pillars or near the top of steep ramps. The jewels can be picked up in what is termed as the \"active box\" and used elsewhere to operate lifts. Controlling the spinning top is an art in itself. It's alright to bash around the larger screens with reckless speed but trying to negotiate narrow \"walkways\"-should it be \"spinways\"-require great skill, good judgement and a very delicate touch. It's all too easy to fall over the edge-which means a time fault. And if you fall too far the top explodes into four pieces. Graphically stunning, the sheer scope of Spindizzy is breathtaking. Add to this absorbing game play, intriguing puzzles, a beat-the-clock element, and you have a brilliant game. Conversions will follow for the Commodore 64 and the Spectrum so those computer owners should start saving their pennies. Graphics Sound C+VG Value HIT!

"1 STARBLAZER First there was Planet Photon, then came the Treasure Trap Castle and Combat Zone. Now enter the latest live action fantasy game STAR BLAZER! C+VG'S man in the U.S.A Marshal M. Rosenthal went boldly where brave men fear to tread to bring you this exclusive peek into the newest sci-fi battlezone. And he took the pictures too... hey suit you up and shove your nose against a door, the metal panels gleaming faintly in the indirect light. You nervously finger the gun, abruptly thrust into your hand a moment earlier, as the door opens before you with a quick \"thump\" of the motors. The corridor ahead twinkles on and off as coloured lights below your feet reflect off the curved ceiling and back down again. A klaxon sounds and you're Off, shoes clanging as you head for the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. Once out, your senses reel as you attempt to accept that you now inhabit a surrealistic world dazling with unreal colours. Even your hands and teeth are glowing! Around you are fellow concripts, all dressed the same. Some wear vests the same colour as yours. But there are too many who don't. You race to and fro, shooting and dodging, feeling your heart pounding. Darting around craters, slipping between stalagmite caverns and maze-like passages, you wonder whether you can survive this test! Peripheral vision warns of converging shadows. Twist! Shoot! Run! You're too good to be stopped, much less caught in ambush... This is life in the weird and deadly world of Star Blazer. Star Blazer is a product of Canadian minds, located near sprawling Toronto. The outside of this latest sci-fi fantasy world is unobtrusive. A huge grey block, nestled among similarly drab buildings in an industrial complex. The sign could easily be misinterpreted as that of a company involved in aerodynamics or perhaps electronics. But there are those who know better. Let's join them and enter a fantasy world of danger and excitement. The equipment seems deceptively simple, although it uses state-of-theart technology. Each player puts on a padded vest which comes in one of the two team colours, orange or black. Attached to the vest is a battery powered numeric counter. This special device is wired to a series of light detecting diodes which are placed around the front and back of the vest. Each player is also given a special \"ray\" gun. This shoots out a beam of infra-red light newer models will also make zapping sounds. The gun runs on a simple 9 volt cell. Players enter from within continued "

"DURELL COMBAT LYNX (Air-to-ground Battle Simulation) Spectrum 48k .95 Commodore 64 .95 Amstrad 464/6128 .95 BBC/Electron COMBAT \"Combat Lynx is both simulation and shoot-em-up games in one. The 3D effect created by using contour line graphics tends to give it a more technical feel so more like a simulation, but on the other hand there are lots of jets and enemy helicopters whizzing around and ground forces shooting at you which gives the game its instant playability appeal. Once you get the hang of coping with everything, it's possible to play a game of high strategy which involves not only arcade skills but those of forward planning. For people who enjoy strategy type games, Combat Lynx should provide hours of fun while for those who prefer something instant and fast choose skill level 4 and hang onto your hats!

An intern ational ring of drug smugglers are about to make a huge delivery of heroin, and must be stopped at all costs. The drugs are stored at a number of houses in the city, and will be taken by cars to an armoured van which will be cruising around the centre. A raid on the van before completion of the delivery would leave some of the drugs in circulation Similarly a raid on any of the houses would alert them to your squad's activities. You must therefore try and pick-off the cars one by one before they make their drop, and then try to stop the van before it escapes The delivery cars will be backed-up by 'hit' squads so watch out!

"ZOID AVOIDER 5 BLUE Welcome to the machines my friends! Zoids are the toughest bunch of metallic monsters this side of the Bug Hunters and right now they are taking the games world by storm! The eternal conflict of Red Zoid versus Blue Zoid has been brought to your computer by The Electric Pencil programming team and Martech. We're proud to present the first look at the line-up of the opposing forces. All you wanted to know about the Zoids, but were afraid to ask! irst let's look at a bit of ancient Zoid history: Millions of light years from earth lies the planet Zoidstar. Its rock and desert surface is scorched and barren. Here strode an ancient race of galactic warlords...the Zoidarians. Here stood the cities where they planned their conquests. Deep within the cities lay the mammoth construction plants that spawned their terrifying war machines... Zoids. Possessed of devastating firepower, Zoids carried the warlords into battle. Nothing could stand against them. Planet after planet fell to their merciless onslaught, till their victory was absolute. Zoidarians turned on one another. Duels to the death satisfied their lust for battle, but this Heroic Combat threatened disaster for them. The Zoidarians bore offspring rarely, their survival depending on their great life expectancy. The escalating death toll of Heroic Combat would inevitably lead to their extinction. So, androids were developed to pilot Zoids into battle. But the Zoidarians were doomed. A devastating meteor storm wiped them out-only the machines survived. The Zoidarians had kept a battleforce of Zoids on standby, in space, Caught in the meteor storm, the battleforce attempted to land on the Blue Moon, a frozen and inhospitable world The androids soon discovered that the icy cold was their worst enemy.

This is easily done with errors. Well, for the minor the command: SAVE \"MCHECK\" CODE inconvenience of typing the short 65000, 150 program shown below. Spectrum From now on, when you've finished owners will be able to automatically typing a listing from the magazine detect all typing errors in future (and saved it to tape, for safety), just listings. load the checksum machine code routine by typing: LOAD\"MCHECK\" CHECKSUMS CODE. Then run the routine using: If you look carefully at the Spectrum RANDOMIZE USR 65000 Basic program in figure one, you'll This will produce a listing of the notice that every line ends with a three program on the screen, including all digit number in the form: <ABC> the checksum numbers.

"checksums are a success, then other micros will be receiving similar treatment, so watch this space! By Marcus Jeffery SPECTRUM HECKSUM digit:'. All the strings should contain characters in the range \"O\"to\"9\" and \"A\" to \"F\" (upper case). Finally, if all the hex strings load correctly, but you've still mistyped a character, then the value of'ck' will be different to 'total', and the computer will give the message 'Error. Recheck Listing'. ASSEMBLY CODE Anybody with an assembler, or simply interested in how the program works, will find the annotated code in figure two useful. If you have an assembler, you may prefer to use this listing rather than type in the Basic Loader program. This will also allow you to move the location of the routine, if you're using locations above 65000 for something else. Studying this listing will show that the checksum is based mainly around the exclusive-OR instruction (XOR). Unfortunately, this on its own will not, for instance, spot differences in chains of similar digits (eg. 'AAAAA' and 'AAAA'). After the first'A' has been XORed with the checksum to this point, further similar characters will not change the value. Consequently, the checksum byte is rotated (using RLCA) after each XOR operation, except the line number and the very last XOR at the end of each line. WHERE TO GO FROM HERE If everything has gone to plan, you should now have access to the machine code routine for the checksum utility (ie. MCHECK). You can try this out immediately on this month's special length Spectrum Listing, which is a multi-character adventure called The Wizard of Tallyron. When you've finished typing the listing, just load the MCHECK routine, then call it to show all the checksum numbers. Eagle-eyed readers may also have spotted that the zero (O) and lowercase L(1) characters have also been changed to make them more readable, so hopefully program typing will be error-free from now on.

TYPING THE LISTINGS When typing in the two listings given below, you can ignore the three-digit numbers (eg. <255>) shown at the end of each line of Basic. These are checksum digits, designed to help you spot any typing errors (see page 47). As usual, we have converted the graphics, so underlined text should be typed in graphics mode (eg. sh3means hold down the SHIFT key and press '3', while in graphics mode). Similarly, underlined text in brackets refers to a graphics command, so(INV VID means go into inverse video mode (ie. CAPS SHIFT+4) PROGRAMMING STEPS Type in the MAIN PROGRAM and save to tape (see above notes). Having done this, you'll need to type in the ARRAY LOADER program. It's probably a good idea to save this to a different tape, though it won't be used in the final program. Now you can run the Array Loader program and, as it prompts you for numbers, type in the numbers shown in ARRAY DATA figure. You should work across the columns when typing these, so the sequence starts 000,000,000, 110, 110,... When you've typed the last number, the computer will prompt: Start tape, then press any key. Position the tape, containing the Main Program, at the end of where the Main Program is stored. Press PLAY and RECORD, then pressa key, and the data will be stored. You're now ready to load and run the main program, which will automatically load the array data. never thought I should live to see Tallyron fall to the Council of Evil. The rumours must be true; the Mace must have been taken. Karl gave a bitter laugh. \"The Mace is merely a legend. You surely don't believe in It?\" You can scoff, young man,\" his father replied. \"But no member of the Council has ever managed to cross our border, not Grokh from the south, nor Krull in the east; not even the Black Knight from the north. Now suddenly we are attacked from all three sides, maybe even to be driven into the sea. And there is talk of this so-called mythical mace being stolen. I believe It exists.\" CHAPTER 2 The Grand Meeting of the Tallyron Wizards was interrupted by a sharp tap on the main doors to the Great Magicians' Hall. \"Who dares to invade the privacy of the Grand Meeting?\" cried the doorkeeper. \"Marc, First yeoman of the King's Personal Bodyguard,\" came the reply. \"The king requests an audience with the Meeting.\" There was a stunned silence, for no sovereign had asked to be admitted to see the wizards for almost three hundred years. The doorkeeper recovered himself sufficiently to give the traditional answer. \"Request denied. No king is recognised by the Grand Meeting.\" Marc responded with the crown's ritual request. \"The true sovereign of Tallyron accepts that the Grand Meeting is outside his rule, but requests a hearing.\" \"The Meeting will hear the sovereign.\" As he spoke, the doorkeeper threw the huge doors back to admit the king and his men, although he failed to bow or otherwise acknowledge his guests. Five hundred years before, the Grand Meeting of wizards had presented the ruling monarch with a ceremonial mace. Named the Mace of Eternal Power. In return the king at the time had agreed that the crown should no longer have any jurisdiction over the wizards. Powlperr, the present king of Tallyron, addressed the Grand Meeting. \"My lords, we assure you that only the gravest possible matter could cause us to intrude on your meeting.\" Powlperr paused and looked around him. He shuffled, a little uncomfortably. \"The situation Tallyron faces is extremely serious. The Mace has CHAPTER ONE The old farmer sat at his window, watching the tattered remnants of a once mighty army retreat north towards the capital city and away from the threatening enemy forces of Grehk. As he gazed, his face emotionless, the door of the room opened behind him and he turned to face the muscular figure of his son, Karl. \"We must leave, father,\" said the young man.\" have spoken to some army officers and they say that all is lost.\" \"Leave?\" The old man stared back at the window. \"Leave our land? Leave all we've worked for? Where would we go?\" \"We can't stay. The forces of the warlord will enslave us, and steal our land anyway. I have friends in the capital who will help us, one of whom is a member of the king's private bodyguard.\" \"Yes, my son. Perhaps you are right. To the capital it is, then.\" The old man slowly rose to his feet. \"I The Wizard of Tallyron is one of the most ambitious listings C-VG has printed.

"been taken from our land.\" There were gasps from the assembled company. Roget, Chairman of the Meeting spoke. \"How is this possible? For only a wizard may touch the Mace.\" ve that an actual member of the Council of Evil stole it personally,\" replied the king. Roget at once realised that this was true. The three enemy lands that surrounded three sides of Tallyron were each ruled by warlords who had had a little magic training. CHAPTER 3 The following morning the Tallyron Wizards were once again interrupted by the king's arrival. Roget had some answers ready. \"Our divinations have shown that the Mace is being held somewhere on The Island of Lost.\" \"Do you know where exactly?\" asked Powlperr. \"No, I'm afraid not,\" replied the wizard. \"Now we know a little about the island. It has no ruler now, and no law outside the towns. Fearful monsters roam free, and the people will not deal with outsiders. We have agreement with magicians' guilds in the towns who may assist us.\" \"You have a plan in mind?\" \"There is a junior acolyte in our Meeting, whose home was on the island, in a village called Tautree. The people will deal with him. As a member of this Grand Meeting, the local magicians guilds will provide him with spells. I therefore propose that you provide a bodyguard of a couple of fighters and we teleport the three of them to Tautree, to begin a quest for the Mace.\" The King's Yeoman, Marc, stepped forward. \"Your majesty,\" he said. \"I am acquainted with this young wizard, and I hae a good trusted friend, newly arrived from the country, a farmer's son, who is a skilled fighter. We would like to go on this quest.\" \"Very well, said the King. \"But remember, you hold the future of Tallyron in your hands. May the power of the mace bring you fortune!\" When everyone had departed Rogon spoke to the chosen young wizard. \"Your party will be teleported without arm or weapons, but we will be able to send you sold gold pieces with which you may equip your party from the local traders. There are Healers in the villages who will restore damage taken in battle, for a price. They may even be able to resurrect your fighters, but if you die, the mission is lost. The local guilds of magicians have their own spells which they will freely give you, as and when you have the experience to use them. That's all I can tell you; the rest is up to you.\" 125 IF USI\" THEN GO SUB 500: VID 186 GO SUB Sene: FOR 0-1 TO 100 NE 1300 IF AX, Y, 3) 3 THEN RETURN XT D.

Susan Bowman was stuck in That's The Spirit, a QL game, albeit an arcady adventure, cowritten by Andy Blazdell. Andy replied with some help for Susan: \"You need to solve the program to get a clue as to how to kill the invisible monster in the church. But you will never get into Frisby's because you can't!\" \"If Susan or any one else requires help with TTS, or just a few clues on how to proceed, then write to me at The Edge, 31 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden and I will endeavour to answer your plaintive pleas!\" adds Andy.

"C+VG ADVENTURE REVIEWS/1 ROBIN OF SHERLOCK complete mystery! Graphics and text are presented on screen at the same time, but something which I found strange is that there is no picture for the first location, or indeed, quite a few locations in the initial stages. While it is certainly acceptable for some l ocations to be pictureless, there should be something more exciting to grab the player's  Supplier: Silversoft/Delta 4  Machine: Spectrum 48k cassette  Price: $7.95 The plot of the latest game from those oddballs who brought you Bored of the Rings features a collection of literary and fantasy figures you all know and love. There's Robin of Sherwood, Sherlock, The Wizard of Oz plus lots of bizarre items linked to the Smurfs and British Telecom. The object initially appears to be to find Dorothy's dog, Toto, from the Oz story and return him to his owner. After a short time though, you find yourself investigating a decidedly shady operation involving the nearby monastery and the Godfather Smurf! The Smurfs are facing a fate almost as awful as being turned into take-aways like the sorrowful local squirrels! As for the exploding Friar, he's a interest at the outset. The narrative is all in the past tense; \"Robin was standing on ...\" and \"This was done\" (after GET, DROP, etc.) It's a little off-putting at first, though after a while it seems a much more logical way to do things, instead of giving the impression of freezing time after every move. \"Robin noticed a lighter\" is more natural than \"You see a lighter.\" Descriptions are quite well written, though at times the \"jokes\" seem to be thrust down your throat in rapid succession. Apart from this, Robin is a very entertaining set of programs, with reasonable graphics and good descriptions.

As you look around the room in shock, you realise that all present have turned into frogs, newts, salamanders, or some other small amphibian. But wait! There is one shadowy figure who even now is slipping quietly out of the room. Like any decent sorceror, I immediately gave chase to the shadowy figure, following him into Belwit Square. No sooner did I approach him, than he disappeared in a cloud of orange smoke. With my friends back at the hall hopping mad at their transformation, everything around me was vague and misty, so I looked in my spell book for a solution to the problem. In a matter of moments I had blown the orange smoke out of existence, and there, on the ground, I found a small white cube. But I had also discovered in the book, a new spell that I had never heard of before, the \"blorple\" spell. Now was the ideal time to try it out. Memorising the long and intricate wording. I cast \"blorple\" at the white cube, and found myself teleported to a strange dark place. This was to be the start of a strange journey, in which I came across, among other things, a serpent so huge that it blocked three of the exits, its body forming a ring with wits tail in its mouth. There was also a strange two-foot long zipper with magical tendencies. Even so, I was unprepared for what it could do. Suffice to say, it made a very unusual sleeping bag. As yet I don't know the meaning of my strange journey. However I have been to some very strange places, and met more than my fair share of unusual creatures. If you like magic adventures with greater than usual depth, or have enjoyed playing Enchanter and Sorceror, then Spellbreaker will not disappoint. It follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, and if you like to exercise your grey matter, it is a must! How, how do I cure an ogre of hay fever?

"ADVENTURE REVIEWS/3 PSYCHEDELIC WARP  Supplier: Silversoft  Machine: Spectrum 48k . Price: To be announced Joe Minniver inhabits the \"near future\". From time to time he feels that something is terribly wrong. He harbours a nagging doubt that the year isn't 1995, but a decade in the past. Being the rugged, square jawed, blue-eyed and all-round adventurous type, Joe decides that instead of going quietly insane, he wants to find out exactly what is going on. And that's where you come in. As soon as you \"Press S to start your day\" an impressive picture of your \"conapt\" (pad/gaff/place/home) appears. I was reminded a little of Alien 8 by the semi-octagonal doorways and metal panelling on the walls. The text is simple, but with graphics like these, you don't need to be told anything except which routes are available. After a while you find yourself in the second location Central Hall. The picture here is even better. Large spiral towers and glass domes extend into the horizon. Very atmospheric. There are a large number of objects around, plus as many tables and chairs, and by the time you have examined a few things the list of items has scrolled off the screen. REDESCRIBE gets them back, but you have to see the picture reconstructed, which isn't all that fast. Finding myself in a talking taxi, I was led to the Palace (great piccy!) but couldn't get inside.

After an amazing graphic sequence, and generally feeling high, I fourd myself in my apartment in 1985. A little exploration revealed that the game now takes place in basically the same locations, though ten years apart. The Central Hall is a plaza, the plus shopping area a deserted supermarket, and so on. A fairly original plot, some inventive touches (SCORE produces \"You're still hoping this is a game, aren't you?') and some very exciting graphics make this a completely enjoyable game. A good buy if you like a game with good graphics.

And as that happens the format and graphics/text mix of adventure games can evolve. I got a glimpse of the shape of adventures to come when I visited the London HO of Rainbird Software where I met Anita Sinclair from Magnetic Scrolls, the design team behind the magic which makes The Pawn so special. When I arrived the Atari ST monitor was showing a graphic display that I first thought was a photograph. It turned out to be 25 all opposite a large bed. the loading screen of the game!

The outpourings of text, together with a fiendish sense of humour, and a devious plot, showed this adventure to be every bit as good as the best of Infocom, the last thing I had expected to see on this assignment! \"Better than Infocom!\" corrected Anita. \"Watch!\" And so saying, we went off to find a tree stump, taking with us a top hat, a pointy hat, two bottles, (one green and one brown) and a key. \"The stump is hollow, yet it is thick enough to sit on, or to place things on,\" explained Anita. She then proceeded to put the top hat IN the stump. and the pointy hat ON the stump, following this with the command: PUT GREEN BOTTLE IN HAT IN STUMP AND BROWN BOTTLE IN HAT ON STUMP.

"DE ACTION C 12000 Racing round a track at suicidal speeds must be a familiar action to most arcade lovers. But have you ever driver in a rally? Grand Prixs are old hat Pole Position and TX-/ are two excellent simulations and there are dozens of others, but Electrocoin's ZX-2000, a race in a Ford rally car, takes some beating. The game is basically the same as other racing simulations with high and low gears, accelerator and brake pedals. but it has one feature the others lack a dashboard with fuel gauge, speedometer and rev counter in working condition. It's surprising how much these three extra features add to the game. To test out my skills as a rally driver I climbed into the cockpit, got myself comfortable and waited for the green light. With gear in low I pushed hard on the accelerator and moved into high geor. Instead of streaking post the other cars, I lost speed and, with dismay, noticed the speedometer needle wavering close on 25mph. There wasn't much point in going on I'd lost the race before I'd even started. Shovelling some more money into the machine I tried again. This time instead of listening to the engine and making a rough quess. I watched my dials. Wher the needle reached 70 changed gear and picked up enough speed to move into high gear, The race was mine so long as I didn't mow down any motorbikes or run off the track. Whenever, you broke or slow down, keep an eye on the speedometer and rev counter, you'll learn through experimentation at what point to change gear. Racing round the countryside is much the same as a Formula track wide roads, lots of traffic all travelling in the same direction with a total disregard for the Highway Code. It doesn't matter what Side you drive on so long as you don't hit anyone or run out of fuel, or blow up Watch your fuel gauge and remember to refuel during the race. There are no garages, but tanks of gas come flying towards you as you speed round drive over them and you'll earn bonus points, and a full tank. They can be quite fricky to runover, but if you miss one don't worry, they Ty post regularly. You would have to be an awful driver to lose through lack of gas, A must for racing fans. START the second stories, others are hiding behind the debris on the sidewalks. Then with horror I realise I'm slowing with fatigue, my ammunition is running out and my bullets don't seem to be travelling as far. What's happening? By mistake I shoot a barrel. Revealed under it is a pair of boots and spurs. With no thought of personal danger I dive towards them and put them on. Moving like the wind I trip over a fallen rifle and bullets. Regaining my balance, I pick them up and find the next time I pull the trigger, my bullets have replenished themselves and travel that extra vital distance, SPLAT! Another body topples to the ground. Gun Smoke is very fast, and os I've said before, packed with action. There's nowhere to hide for a breather, you've just got to plough straight in there and hope your aim is true. As you progress into the game each scene gets more difficult so that you really have to rely on your powers of dodging and aiming. At one point, you'll have to walk round the side of a lake on a narrow pathway. At other times you'll find yourself in wide open areas with nowhere to take cover and thugs shooting from every angle. And, of course, Master Winchester is only the first of a number of baddies to kill each tougher than his predecessor, Your two guns can shoot in a combination of directions depending on which of the three fire buttons you're hitting and how many of them together. Gun Smoke is excellent, fast and pacy. I'd recommend it to all bounty-hunters. GOAL 100 ISO FUEL TURBO "

"+0 COMPUTER + VIDEO GAMES 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE LONDON, EC1R 3AU arcade shirt to replace the one that I've just got dirty by falling over. I mean such a nice, kind, generous and absolutely supafabudiffeous magazine with such really excellent info and useful tips could surely spare a humble groveller a size 38in chest. Tony Bennett, Essex the Spectrum, C64/128, Amstrad and BBC computers. Another game called Yie Ar Kung Fu says it runs on the Amstrad, C64, Spectrum and the BBC, but it does not mention the 128 Editor's reply: All C64 should work on the 128. Sunil Abbi Birmingham. Pacm But it  I have just read your excellent February edition and as usual I was stunned by the games news, reviews and the competitions. However I was not so stunned by your review of Rambo/Commando. You said, and I quote, \"Commando definitely makes Rambo look like Mr Puniverse.\" So the quality of the graphics and sound may not be as good as Commando's but Rambo clearly has more variation. Enough moaning! I am a Commodore 128 owner, and I am quite disappointed with the lack of software for this machine. I am an arcade/adventure/shoot'em up addict and so far I see only business software. I have been a follower of your magazine since May 1985 and I would never miss it. I would also like to ask fellow readers for some help, I am stuck on Rambo. I have rescued the first PO.W., got into the chopper but I can't find the other POWs. Please help. someone. Anthony Kemp, Cleveland  I get two great mags a month-C+VG and Dragon User I am a very happy Dragon owner and have been since 1983. I don't want to start the ball rolling again about the different computers, but there are still some 50,000 Dragon users and we want support. So pull your fingers out and let's have some  Well it looks like it is time for Big Red to go out and slap a few people. Is it the great mag itself that can't spell or is it Miss Walker who cannot spell her own name? If it is our great magazine then it is probably the end of civilization as we know it and C+VG has got an Editorial Assistant who does not read the magazine. If, however, it is Miss Walker who is at fault, then perhaps the world survives but the mag is left with an Editorial Assistant who can't spell Either way, whether it is Lesly (Who Dyes Wins C+VG Jan 86) or Lesley (a letter to me signed by her) Miss Walker does not come out of this in a very favourable light, and as a punishment should be forced to complete Ring of Power (yawn yawn). However because I'm a male chauvinist pig and because Lesley is a pretty little thing, and because I have absolutely no principles, I can be bought off with a meagre T-shirt. Mark Watson Lancaster. Editor's reply: Lesly for that is how she insists on spelling her name is blushing furiously at being called a \"pretty little thing.\" I think you've won her heart, Mark. Her typewriter, however, is programmed to spell her name as Lesley hence the confusion. The typewriter can't be reprogrammed since Big Red sat on it. game. PH Jee Margate.  I have always been a dedicated arcade gamer. I like all arcade machines eg, Pacman Commando, Tempest, etc But if someone offered me chance to play what I think is the greatest arcade game of all time that would have to be Super Don Quixote. That is really the reason why I am writing this letter. One day when I was in my local arcade they had a game, which was like watching a cartoon, that's right, Super Don. Anyway a few friends and myself had first go on this new game. After playing the game six to eight times I was really addicted to that machine and every penny I had went into it, that added up to about  a week. Then one day when I went in ... it was gone! I felt really down-hearted even though I had completed if before anyone else in my town. I looked for that game everywhere, in every arcade shop in Glasgow, Falkirk, Edinburgh etc. The only place I know of is the Funhouse in Blackpool, but that is about 150 miles from Airdrie. If anyone knows where I can find it please could you let me know. I have tried begging with the owner of my local arcade, but to no avail, so this is my last hope. Scott McCully Airdrie.  AC+VG Hit I read! What graphics, it sounds great! My mind is overcome with excitement! Several weeks later, the money saved, I pop down to our local computer shop to purchase the game I wanted, but what do find? A great game in a different box! At one time I had a nice neat row of cassettes in their boxes, but now with Gunfight, Tau Ceti, Alien 8. Three Weeks in Paradise and Arcade Hall of Fame all in different boxes I am having trouble. Most of these oversized boxes contain only the one cassette anyway. They are unnecessary. If a game is good it does not need an ultra large box to prove it. Please, please, please software companies revert back to the standard size cassette boxes. M Chester Cheshire Other computer owners think that the new Kung Fu type games are new but I have been kicking hell out of Ninja's flying rocks and fireballs since 1983. One particular game Ninja Warrior is as playable now as it was way back in '83. In 1984 graphic adventures came along, in 1985 even more graphic adventures and some great arcade games. December 1985 brought us Juxta Position the ultimate graphic adventure from Wintersoft, and also Shocktrooper, an arcade game loosely based on the serial V. Don't get me wrong, I am not knocking any other makes of computer and I am not saying the Dragon's the best but since Webster, a major distributor of software, dropped the Dragon, we have to buy from mail order firms. That's why we need more support. One last thing you Spectrum, C64 owners who are selling your micros to upgrade don't sell them, keep them and buy yourself a Dragon as a second micro. I am also a happy owner of a 48K Spectrum, surprise, surprise, bet you didn't expect that... Oh yes, I bought January's edition please tell John Silverman from Aussie to press M.A.X. keys together then use arrows to select different screen to start on, then press space bar once. Willy will appear, press keys to move Willy to any part of screen he wishes to start from then press space bar again to start game. This can be done many times throughout the  Your magazine has to be the 8-8-8-greatest for 95-hard-earnedpence. I thought though I would write refering to a few little nonsensical bits and pieces. In your January issue, Soh Kan Yung quite rightly wrote in about Saruman not being the last enemy in Lord of the Rings, but, the last book can be called Return of the Ring because Frodo keeps the ring and then returns it. It is called Retum of the King but it can't really be called to call it Return of the Ring C+VG Adventure Line is an excellent idea. I am a secondary adventurer, 385 points in Hewson Consultants Quest Adventure, but, can anyone help with Hulk? Oh, by the way, my International Karate has a bug in it. On the bonus level with the boxes on the table, if you jump too high and not across you get stuck and have to reload. Is this an already known bug or have I just discovered one? Oh well, I've extended this so called little letter a bit sol suppose I'd now better get on my knees and grovel for a T I've been confused about the new Commodore 128 and the Commodore 64. As everywhere I have seen the Commodore 128, it says it is 100 per cent compatible with the Commodore 64. Well that's where I'm stuck. As with your reviews and others in different magazines, for example there's a 64 game in your mag, January issue, called Commando it says it runs on CONTINUED ON PAGE 102 "


"airbag, COMPUTER + VIDEO GAMES 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE LONDON, EC1R 3AU nothing we can really do about it. If a software company advertises a game for a particular computer and then changes its mind, what can we do? I have recently bought the Commodore plus 4 and I must say how disappointed I am with it. The software is quite difficult to find. I get most of mine through mail order only to find that the game also works on the C16 which has a much smaller memory so the games are a bit basic. I am already used to the high standard of the C64, I am already thinking about selling computer magazine!! Sherlock trained minds may know, but I do not! Was it the BUGS seeking revenge for being cut from the magazine? Or was it the plot of the evil newsagent? Seriously, though, please, wonderful, fantastic, marvellous, stupendous editor, after all this grovelling can! Please, PLEASE have a Book of Maps? One last thing, how about some C16 listings? Contrary to popular belief, I and several of my friends do type in listing. Laura Thomson Victoria, Australia Editor's reply: All right, Laura, stop grovelling. The C+VG Book of Maps is on its way to Australia right now. If the plus 4 has a 64K memory then there is no reason why the software shouldn't be greatly improved. More games should be designed for the Plus A Allen Lewisham The other day I got a game called \"Family Quiz\". The packaging was great and you got a free Family Quiz Book. All very well but, it cost .95! When it loads it has a title picture, then it gives you a choice of five subjects. Once you have chosen the subject it asks whether you want 10, 20 or 30 questions. Brilliant!! thought. My dad and I played it. But if you pick the same subject twice, I can almost guarantee two of the questions will be repeats. Utter rubbish thought. The moral of this tale is to ask for a demonstration of the game and not go for good packaging freebies! Scott Smith Lanarkshire I have been buying your magazine for nearly two years and never found fault. But enough is enough. I can't take any more. I just had to write. What, you ask, has made my blood boil? Software companies advertising products that they cannot supply. All right, a few -and I mean a few-give some idea of release dates, but others-hell, I am fed up. I am so fed-up that I have written to the Advertising Standards Authority. I am an Atari computer owner and in the last month I have replied to adverts from your previous issue for software advertised by Beyond and Firebird only to be told that they are not available or are not going to be made at all. Then when I receive my next issue of C +VG the same adverts appear again. US Gold and Activision are just as bad keeping us waiting weeks for new software. The only decent company is English Software who make sure their games are available when advertised. I know the adverts are needed to keep costs down but couldn't you vet them or make the software companies give release dates, because when it comes down to it we buyers keep the companies in business Steve Watts Fareham software company because of the advertisement for Hyper Sports in your December issue. The advert said Hyper Sports was now released on your BBC Micro .95. This was surrounded by Available Now in big lettering. I was very pleased when I saw this because there are no decent sport games out for the Beeb and I was anxious to buy it. I waited for about two weeks and then I went into Birmingham to look and hopefully buy the game. I went to all of the best software places in Birmingham but I could not see it anywhere. When I got home I rang up the Imagine software house and asked if the game had been released. The people at Imagine took ages to answer the phone and when they did answer they told me to hold the line sol waited and when they came back to the phone they said the game wasn't being released for about a month. I waited for about six weeks and I then rang up Imagine again and they said it wasn't being released for another two weeks. I asked them why the game was taking so long to be released and they said it was already out on disk and the cassette version would be ready very soon. Trang them up today which is four weeks since the last time! rang and they said the game wasn't being released on cassette. I was furious when they told me this because they cannot be bothered with BBC games, which is shown when you compare the BBC version of Yie-Ar-Kung-Fu with the versions of other computers which are ten times better. They obviously had hopes of releasing the game on cassette because in the advert in C+VG the price was .95 and the disk version in the shops costs .95. Please will Imagine buck their ideas up towards BBC games and you at C+VG be more careful and check if the adverts are true before you put them in the mag Stephen Lloyd Barton-under-Neadwood Staffs Editor's reply: We appreciate your problem but there's Many thanks for the prompt and efficient way you passed on my letter to David Yammoni, of Australia, whose letter you featured in an earlier issue. The Vectrex may be dead and buried but there are still a lot of us out here who mourn its passing. David has passed on to me an address in America where-but, only if there is a big enough demand-Vectrex owners can buy an Eprom cartridge previously unreleased by Vectrex games If there is anyone interested, please write to me c/o C+VG and I shall pass on the address As a newcomer to computers and adventures I especially like your Adventure section. I am grateful for any help or hints that come my way and I speak as someone who's still marooned on Emerald Isle and lost in the land of the Red Moon -I sometimes wish I hadn't bought either of them, but, every time I play them I get a little farther and, like a glutton for punishment, I keep coming back for more MD Farrell Isle of Wight I am writing to warn readers about a software hiring club! subscribed to called Vic-20 Software Hire. Last September I ordered three games for one week's hire enclosing .40. After three phone calls asking the club to hurry up with my programs, I received one of them eight weeks after ordering lowever, since then I have phoned about five more times asking the club to hurry up with my programs, and more recently to return my money. Finally, two weeks ago, I wrote to the club saying I would write to your magazine if I did not get my money back. Out of interest, the two games this club was unable to send me were sent to me by another club within three days. Stuart Yalden Leicester I rushed into the newsagent and just managed to snatch November's C+VG from the shelves. The last copy! On further examination I found that there was a piece of yellow tape with \"FREE\" printed on it attached to the front cover. Now what could that be for I wondered, as I handed over my savings to the girl behind the counter? But, it was not until I reached home that I discovered the dreadful truth! AAAARGH! The treasured Books of Maps was-dadadadum MISSING!!!!! Who had committed this heinous crime? Who had violated that precious commodity-a GOOD I would like to complain to magazine and the Imagine END "
