Experience the thrills and spills of Space Mountain and all the excitement of the Runaway Train. It's ANOTHER Exclusive Review! EDITOR TIM BOONE My most horrible moment was just last week when I was caught short at Tower Hill and had to wee up against this old stone wall. It was only afterwards that realised what I'd just done I'd widdled against the Tower Of London! I feel really terrible about it and just hope I don't get executed or something.. DEPUTY EDITORPAUL RAND I was at home watching telly one time when there was a knock on the door and five policemen came bursting in. They'd had a tip that my sad flatmate was up to no good, and it was all a big mistake but I was terrified because they wanted to search my bedroom and I haven't tidied it for eight and a half years... ART EDITOR JON BILLINGTON I was locked out of my flat once and ended up spending the whole night in my car with Frank O'Connor, who had no home to go to. It was freezing cold and we sat there all night and all Frank kept jabbering on about was how bloody cold it was and sharing body warmth the way Eskimos do... STAFF WRITER STEVE KEEN I was on holiday and spotted my girlfriend's blonde hair, so I went up and gave her a kiss on the neck. Then I realised it wasn't my girlfriend at all. I went back and told my mates what I'd done, and they told me that the blonde hair actually belonged to a man! To be honest, was glad I was me and not him... STAFF WRITER PAUL ANGLIN I was on this skiing holiday once and wandered into the girls' loo by mistake. When I realised what I'd done I just panicked and hid in one of the cubicles for half an hour. In the end, when I thought no-one was around, I burst out of the door and there was my whole class and the teacher just staring at me... DESIGNER JENNY ABROOK We were outside the back of CVG Towers last week and all the boys kept going on at me to climb into the boot of Jon's car for a laugh, and in the end I gave in. Just as I was clambering in, someone asked what I was doing and I had to shout: \"Hang on, I've just got to get into this boot.\" I still don't know what the point was. SPECIAL (DIS)APPEARANCE: JIM DOUGLAS One day our teacher was being a right old cow, so when she left the room me and my mate wrote loads of really horrible things like \"Mrs King Is a Jobbie\" on the blackboard. She came in, caught us red handed and blew her stack but it was the day before the summer holidays and I didn't care. MANAGING EDITOR JULIAN RIGNALL When I was at school my mates dared me loads of cash to go up to the maths teacher and ask him if whether he actually had a willy. They didn't think I had enough nerve, but I did it and got a terrible caning. Still, I had the last laugh | made about a fiver...

"PLAYTEST SPECIAL! NEWS SONIC SPECIAL REPORT LUND HOT! HOT! HOT! Here's an awesome first look at Sonic 112, courtesy of the greatest games mag in the world! The CVG boys were among a few VIPs invited to Sega HQ to playtest the game, so here's the world's first in-depth and official study of this white hot little Megadrive baby! Remember, this is NOT a Review (the game's not even finished yet) but it does give you a good idea what to expect. Take it away, boys! 1:25 DE SONIC TWO-TAILED TRICKERY! LIIT You probably know this already, but Sonic now has a pal! He's a super cute red fox who goes by the name of Two Tails because, um, he's got two tails! This lad's a bit special, because his talents and speed improve depending whether you're playing the one of two player versions of the game! ONE PLAYER: In one player mode this young scamp follows Sonic wherever he goes, mimicking his exact movements and protecting old strickle back from his enemies whilst collecting extra gold rings! But he's nowhere near as fast as Sonic, and very often gets left behind. When this happens, Sonic rushes of and Tails disappears from view. That's when he decides to take to the skies, and though you can't see it, he's using his tails like helicopter blades to fly back onto the screen! TWO PLAYER: Tails miraculously upgrades his skills to become as fast and powerful as Sonic! He's capable of exactly the same speed and skills as his pal, so two players can race to complete each level and whoever picks the fox can't winge that his character wasn't as good! SUPERSPEED SONIC Sonic can still run as fast as ever with the special shoes, but a new feature has been added for Super Sonic Speed! By holding down the joypad he crouches into an oval shape and smoke starts to seep from under his prickles as a jet engine sound begins to warm up and a quick stab of the button sends our hero firing off in a megaspeedy ball of fury! Sonic himself has also been given a very slight facelift to make him better defined against the backdrops but he still looks the same as ever! CVG 010 "


"BOSTED BONUSES! SCORE TIME 0:32 RINGS Ima New additions to the sequel include more bumper and trampoline combinations than we've ever seen before, which send the characters ricocheting all over the screen at sonic speeds! New enemies include monkeys which throw coconuts onto your head from trees, fish, snakes ad lava monsters as well as secret passages, rooms and an extra special bonus stage lurking VERY deep in the game... LET'S TWIST AGAIN! The graphics in the game have been given a good going over and small features, like the effect shown on Sonic when he picks up a special power-up, have been made more of. The invulnerability icon turns him into a veritable light bulb, and he'll light up objects such as rope bridges when he touches them! Maybe one of the most stunning effects comes in the factory stage, which is littered with cogs, pulleys, pipes and see through tubes as well as a spinning cylindrical drum which looks like a net. When the guys get trapped inside, it twists them around up and over the screen as if they were walking towards you up and around the inside of a tube! It's a gobsmacking effect just wait 'til you see it! FEASONIC E9X3 DOUBLE THE FUN Incredibly, by using new programming techniques, our two heroes can be separated for a simultaneous head to head race across each stage! This is achieved by splitting the play area in two and doubling the resolution on the screen, which means that there's no loss of detail, speed or fun! It's an amazing achievement, and whilst the two screens do look just a tad squashed the system seems to work very well. Incredible! JUURES TIME 0:46 RINGS DINNI 10||||| TIME 2:32 RINGS 31 SONID AND FINALLY.. An awful lot of people thought Sonic 2 was just going to be Sonic 1 all over again. Oh no, matey the gameplay's completely different with the addition of Tails! Animation is brill, and some of the sound effects amazing! As you read this, Sega are still putting the finishing touches to the game, but it does look set to deliver most of the things everyone's looking for! Watch out for more updates and the full CVG Review soon! 011 CVG TTTTT "

LOTUS 3 LOWDOWN! Screaming in just three seconds too late for Review this issue comes the long awaited Lotus 3 from Gremlin! So rather than wait for next month we thought we'd tell you all about it anyway! SELECT A CAR Moore M200 IBM SPEED YB KPM 0-60 5.7 SECONDS A mixture of the previous Lotus titles and a sprinkling of new ideas, Lotus 3 The Ultimate Challenge packs even more high-octane thrills than previous outings. As well as the option to race around circuits (a feature sadly lacking from Lotus 2) the players have the opportunity to blast through checkpoint stages in true Outrun style! Further options are a personal track designer, password skips to any track you like, easy, medium or hard circuits and the usual auto/manual gears. As well as the stylish Elan and the powerhouse Turbo Esprit, forward thinking players can even opt to take the new Lotus Concept Car for a burn around the tracks. While solo play against the clock is a pretty thrilling affair, it's the head-to-head race, with up to four human controlled players (two per Amiga, connected through the Link mode) that really gets the adrenaline pumping. Presentation, graphics and music are flawless, and Lotus 3 offers plenty to keep most racing nuts more than happy but owners of the first two might find the game a tad too samey. Check it out as soon as you can! oo GVG 014 "

Yes indeedy, CVG scoops the galaxy once again for the Exclusive Review of one of the most eagerly awaited sequels EVER! Star Wars on Nintendo was one of the greatest console games of all time, and here's the sequel! Will it be better than the original? Will it have everything you want? Have you just created a rather large puddle on the carpet? No? What's wrong with you! \"JUDGE ME BY MY SIZE, WILL YOU?\" The Empire Strikes Back, although the second in the Star Wars trilogy of movies, is actually number five in the series. Confused? Don't be there are, in actual fact, a trio of Star Wars adventures to come! Mind you, they're all very much in the realms of folklore at the moment. Apparently the three centre on Obi Wan Kenobi and Annakin Skywalker's rise to the status of Jedi Knights, the battle against the Empire in The Clone Wars and the eventual turning of Annakin by the Emperor to become The Dark Lord Of The Sith Darth Vader! The rumour goes that the first of the new trilogy is in production as we speak. If that's true, your socks should be exploding right about now! The Rebels have destroyed the Death Star, but in doing so they have unleashed the wrath of the Empire. Led by Princess Leia, the Rebels retreat to the ice planet Hoth. But Darth Vader, sensing the power of The Force in Luke Skywalker, dispatches thousands of probes into the galaxy in the hope of tracking down the young Jedi trainee and his friends and things start to get hot when one of them lands on Hoth. You become Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back, part two of the Star Wars Trilogy. Using your newfound powers shown to you by Obi Wan Kenobi, battle against the Dark Side in a variety of stages based on scenes from the smash-hit sci-fi epic. Watch your step, Luke and may The Force be with you... always. "


"\" THEN I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL!\" Jedi Knights are hard as iron because they use The Force a mystical power which comes from the energy of the universe. Luke isn't a Jedi Knight yet, but he can find and use some of the powers of The Force, such as the ability to run faster and jump higher than normal, reflect enemy shots or even levitate! What a boy! \"I AM YOUR FATHER\" Luke starts the game with a blaster which he can fire in eight different directions, but if he scours the ice caverns of Hoth he can find a Light Sabre weapon of a Jedi and cut those baddies to shreds! Hunt around a bit more and he'll also discover Force powers that make both the Light Sabre and blaster even more powerful! Nobody can deny that Star Wars was one of the best games to hit the NES for a long time, and although it cost a fortune it was worth it we still play it now! The Empire Strikes back is not as polished as the original, and the massive levels are perhaps a little too big. For their size, there doesn't seem to be an obscene amount of enemies to encounter on occasion but don't let that detract you. The graphics are great, especially on level two where you get to fly around in a snowspeeder and blow scores of enormous AT-AT Walkers to bits although the scrolling on the platform levels can be jerky at times and take a while to catch up with the main character. Gameplay is involving enough, although it must be said that some of the big baddies are ridiculously easy to kill. The Wampas, for instance, can be iced by simply standing in an alcove and blasting away the Wampa just cannot touch you! The Empire Strikes Back is a big game that doesn't contain quite the same amount of substance that its prequel has but it's still a damned good effort, nonetheless. PAUL RAND \" NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS!\" If you've seen the film and you'd be a drooling halfwit if you haven't you'll have a fair idea of how the levels in Empire Strikes Back run. Beginning in the icy wastes of Hoth (including the underground lair of the Wampas), move on to a battle with the massive AT-AT Walkers closing in on the rebel base, then attempt to escape from the base itself before whizzing off to Dagobah for Jedi training with Yoda. A quick jump to Bespin follows where Han, Leia and Co are in danger in Cloud City. Chase after the bounty-hunter Bobba Fett, who's rushing off with the carbon-encased Han Solo, then return to Cloud City and confront evil Darth Vader! Are you tough enough to take it when he lops your hand off or will you just run to daddy and blow it all for the galaxy? "


"THE MPIRE STRIKES BACK How to make a game an absolute hit in one easy lesson leap into bed with the creators of the most succesful sci-fi trilogy ever, making sure they themselves have a knack of turning in fab video games, turn in a brilliant first effort then produce a sequel that's the tops too! That's just what JVC and Lucasfilm have done here. Star Wars on the NES was pretty smart to say the least and Empire Strikes Back is almost as good. I say almost because, it has to be said, there are a few faults with this one. To start with the play area is a little too big, resulting in a little aimless wandering. It's quite a difficult game and will certainly keep you going for quite a while, if only to stare at the great graphics, especially those on the AT-AT stage. Overall, not quite the marvel the original was but a spiffing good game as it is. PAUL ANGLIN \"NO, THERE IS ANOTHER\" If you're after more Star Wars fun and frolics on your NES, then why not try the game of the first film! It's an absolute cracker of a blast, combining platform action and 3D space dogfighting over a number of massive levels, and received a worthy HIT! when CVG reviewed the game a few months ago. And if you've got a home computer, Domark brought out conversions of all three Star Wars coin-ops a couple of years back the Amiga version of the Star Wars arcade game is the best of that bunch, and the best thing is that, if you have a sound sampler, you can take out the sampled speech from the film and put in your own chat!

"I Knock out! \"SEARCH YOUR FEELINGS, LUKE Super Nintendo owners who may be feeling slightly peeved because they haven't got a Star Wars game on their machine, don't fret Super Star Wars is coming for the SNES very soon! It's looking very good indeed and, although it's only in the early stages of production, we're assured that it'll be the tops when it's released in the coming months. \"I LOVE U  Most of the main characters from the movie crop up in The Empire Strikes Back, mostly to give you hints and information on where to go and what to do in various stages of the game, but others, like Bobba Fett and Darth Vader, are ready and waiting to have a fight with you. And Yoda is in the game too; waiting for Luke to turn up on Dagobah to begin the training to become a Jedi Knight! What the hell are the two Paul's banging on about this time? Let's get one thing straight from the start this has to be one of the greatest NES titles EVER and the only game of this type which could possibly top it is the original Star Wars. That game blasted my eyes out of the sockets when first saw it, and now that the sequel's here it's late nights ahoy once again. Sure, the game does have a couple of niggling drawbacks scrolling isn't exactly the smoothest ever and some sections of the game are a damn sight easier than others but so what? This is an 8-bit machine after all! Star Wars set new standards of gameplay and depth on the little Nintendo, and Empire faithfully follows on. It might not have the same impact as the original, but for my money it's a better game. There's nothing annoys me more than people marking down a game because of the capabilities of the machine it's written for. If somebody implemented gameplay of this standard onto an arcade machine with all its bells and whistles people would say it was the greatest game ever. Empire certainly isn't that, but it's one of the greats nonetheless. Highly recommended. \"I KNOW\" TIM BOONE It's not all running about under your own steam in this game from the outset, Luke is given a Taun-Taun to ride about on in the frozen wastes of Hoth and, later on, he can take to the skies in snow-speeders and X-Wing fighters to take on AT-AT walkers, TIE-Fighters and Bobba Fett's ship! Not only those, but during the escape from Echo Base on Hoth, young Skywalker can leap into an unmanned AT-ST Walker and blast the Imperial Stormtroopers to oblivion. But be careful if you leave the Walker, it explodes and there aren't any more to hand STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES GRAPHICS SOUND % % 88 % % % GAMEPLAY VALUE OVERALL 90 "

You'd think that's the Hilton if you were banged up inside the new Solar Prison! Not only do the poor souls incarcerated in this hell-hole put up with basic amenities and appalling sanitary facilities, they also have to deal with huge alien killing machines and you don't go after these lads with your bare hands. Thankfully Xenomorph Exterminators R Us has been called in the form of one Ellen Ripley, a Freighter pilot who's a dab hand at kicking alien ass. Bringing with her a large and varied collection of guns and grenades, not to mention her unquenchable desire for death and destruction, Ripley marches in to take control of fifteen alien-infested zones, rescuing helpless victims as she a goes. Better pack plenty of ammo, Rippers this is gonna be tough. Or not! Well okay, on some levels you do have to rescue certain prisoners first otherwise you'll run out of time, and die, and yes you do need to try and memorise the layout of the levels. And it does help if you know what weapons to use in what situations, but other than that no there's no strategy involved at all just simple, run-around-and-shoot-things fare. .5.0 RENNIES GUNS, GUNS WON'T WORK AND MORE THIS TIME GUNS!

AFEAST OF FILMIC FUN MOSTLY WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE ALIEN LADDERS OF DOOM! Forget the SO-SO movie. Alien 3 The Game carries on where Alien 2 left off in the middle of some mean totalling of monsters! There's no messing around with cattle prods or axes here, just straight in there with some top of the range military hardware and alien-blasting. Although extremely violent, Alien 3 cannot be described as totally mindless. The sheer size and complexity of some of the later levels means that you can't just go rushing in there, guns blazing. Mayhem and violence is the order of the day, with big guns to blast with and some incredibly tough nasties to blast at, ensuring that you won't be wanting for action. The film may not set the world alight, but Alien 3 on the Megadrive is a stunner grab it as soon as you can. The big-screen version of Alien 3 is the sequel to Aliens, which in turn follows on from the original blockbuster, Alien. The first film centred on the crew of the good ship Nostromo and its attempts to rid their craft of a nasty alien stowaway. The follow-up placed much more emphasis on action, packed to the brim with death and destruction not to mention some of the biggest guns ever to grace a movie screen. Part three tries to revert back to the moody feel of the original, but quite frankly the lack of full-scale death (most of the blasting is left until right at the very end of the film) is a let-down for anyone expecting an out-and-out action film.

Well 1 wouldn't totally agree with the sprog, but Acclaim can feel rightly chuffed with themselves over this game. Graphically it's very good, although rather spartan at times. And if you think that this looks similar to Virgin's Terminator license, that's because it was created by the same people! Terminator was accused of being too easy which I don't hold with but you can't say that this time round. With Aliens leaping at you left, right and centre and you fumbling around with the joypad to try and select an appropriate weapon to use, whilst all the time the ridiculously short time limit ticking away, it's a challenge just to escape from the first few stages and there's a dozen more to counted with after that!

"lau H 115551 CVG LIE REVIEW EL MEGADRIVE MAJI PLATFORM GI-ANT! BY GREMLIN .99 The Nth dimension is bloody enormous, so for the ease of exploration it's been broken down into seven stages each, as you may have guessed, with it's own particular pitfalls. The Sweet World is a nightmare of mutated confection. The Music world is all deadly cymbals and flying drumsticks. Tool World pits Zool against drills and hammers, while Fruit World boasts an arsenal of flying pea pods and seed-spitting grapes! Shoot-'em-up World (see box) offers a break from the rest of the action, and Fun Fair World and Toy World are simply too demonic and bizarre to talk about! There's enough variety to keep you in a perpetual state of ant-icipation! TRIUMPH-ANT! This fast and frantic romp through a brace of simply enormous stages is designed to give Amiga owners the same sort of frenzied fun that their console cousins haveenjoyed for so long. Zool himself, a ninja ant in fact, must explore the Nth dimension's varied stages, dodging and blasting hazards he encounters on the way, while scooping as many bonus items as his little ant arms can carry. The Nth dimension is a peculiar place, where things are not always what they seem. Zool must employ all his amazing abilities if he is to survive! The Nth dimension is a strange and dangerous place, with fiendish traps around every corner. Fortunately, Zool's special abilities can see him through even the toughest situation. Zool can summon up a magical double which will follow him around, shooting whenever he shoots and dealing with the bad guys. He also has a huge bell at his disposal on the Music level in which he can hide from his adversaries. Other special skills include the ability to climb VIOL-ANT! Ninja DIMENSION of the Enth Two thirds of the way through the game, Zool is fortunate enough to discover his space ship, a tooled-up deathbringer of a fighter jet. Once strapped into the cockpit, Zool sets out for an entire level's worth of blasting fun. This stage is virtually good enough to warrant release as a stand alone game, and it makes a welcome change from the jumping and clambering antics of the rest of the game. C Knock Out!!! T PAG HD INT The first thing guaranteed to grab you about Zool is the sheer speed and console feel of the game. Our hero ant whizzes around the screen at a well decent lick, and everything's on turbo to make sure you're never standing still. OK, so the game owes an awful lot to the likes of Sonic and Mario, but actually manages to improve some elements to provide a pretty original and well wicked platform laugh! Graphics are big, bold and colourful (I think the Zool sprite is completely ace!) and sound is simple but atmospheric. With squillions of hidden bonuses, a massive challenge and all sorts of bells and whistles, this must rank one of the best Amiga platform games going. The only thing which holds the game back slightly is the repetitive nature of the gameplay, but Zool is one of those games you can easily become completely obsessed with. Nice one Gremlin!

"GVG SUPER NINTENDO PLATFORM BY IREM .00 DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD... TV is a powerful medium but who'd have thought it could suck you into a world of prehistoric monsters? Not Rex and Tops, that's for sure! They were all ready to settle down and watch their fave programme when, in a blinding flash, they were hurled through the telly screen and transported way, way back in time. But, spawny gets that they are, they just happen to come across a pair of friendly dinosaurs who offer to help them get back to their own era. It won't be easy prehistoric Earth is a dangerous place. Now and again, you may come across an area which seems impassible, at which you get very annoyed and start swearing. But stop! That's only because you haven't pressed the R button at the top of your joypad! Hold it in and your character leaps from the back of his dinosaur pal, allowing him (or her Tops is a girl!) to stand on the back of the beastie and jump higher! And as well as that, the humans can fire little energy bolts that freeze the baddies. for a few seconds, giving enough time to leap back onto your monster ap 'em with something a bit more substantial! BONUS STAGE BIG BAD BADDIES Most of the baddies you'll encounter in Dinosaurs are grumpy old cavemen with big beards and a rather nifty throwing arm which they use to good effect by hurling large blocks at Rex and Tops. Other critters to avoid or do way with include baby Pterodactyls, bouncy plants with big teeth and little flying imp things. Either shoot at them or bounce on their heads a la Super Mario the choice is yours! First impressions were \"Oh good, another platform game in the Super Mario Bros mould.' Was IN wrong or was wrong! Dinosaurs is a hellishly addictive if not totally original piece of platform tomfoolery, which actually owes more to the PC Kid games than the Mario series of adventures. Sprites and backdrops are all superb, and the technical capabilities of the Super Nintendo have been used to good effect on later levels, for instance, the rotational effect seen in the likes of Castlevania IV is incorporated into the game, in a stage that has the player trying to keep his feet on a massive wooden wheel! Music is of a very high quality it's both atmospheric and foot-tappingly jolly, and the game is good enough to keep you going back time and time again although the inclusion of both infinite continues AND a password system may cut short your enjoyment. Leave the continues well alone and Dinosaurs will be a long-term fixture in your Super Nintendo cartridge slot. Great fun! cvG 032 PAUL ANGLIN "


"1la Las .00 CVE MACHO MONSTERS Not only are Rex and Tops lucky enough to stumble upon two jolly dinos more than willing to assist them in their search for a way home, they're also surprised to find that these monsters pack quite a punch! Rex's chum, appropriately enough a Tyrannosaurus Rex, smacks the nasties with his fists and swings wildly with his tail, whilst Tops' steed shoots arrows from its mouth! What is it with Nintendo and platform games? The graphics in Dinosaurs have a distinctly cute look about them nice and colourful and they all move about very well. The Super Nintendo's custom chips have been used to good effect, especially on the Wheel of Doom on stages three and four. Sound is definitely one of the game's strong points: the tunes are so catchy and jolly and serve to compliment the action well. Although this doesn't go any way to matching Mario, it's still a pretty smart game, but I wouldn't go as far as Rand. For me it's just all too familiar to be of any great interest. Don't get me wrongDinosaurs is an excellent cart and worthy of your cash, but the lack of original touches means that it's not going to do great things and I don't see it selling squillions. That's a bit of a shame really, because this is one of the better examples of this type of game. PAUL RAND co BONUS BONANZAS At the end of most stages are two doors, one yellow and the other orange. The yellow door takes the player to the next level, but go through the orange one and you'll more often than not end up in one of the many bonus screens! These range from vertically scrolling collect-the-objects dashes to horizontally scrolling, erm, collect-the-objects dashes. Grab as many goodies as you re you reach the end of the screen or fall from a platform, because you'll be instantly whisked back to the main game. STRATEGY SKILL AURS A LITTLE ROAR...

"MEGADRIVE Helpmaboab just look at the size of that sucker! SHOOT 'EM UP SHOOT 'EM UP A Plenty of good old nasties to blast so do it, why doncha? BY TECNOSOFT .00 The aliens are attacking again! Why can't they just stay on their own side of the galaxy and grow potatoes or something? Because it's not as much fun, that's why. So here we go again, and the poor inhabitants of your planet are not exactly cock-a-hoop over another impending assault of their world. So it's time once more to power up the newly-refitted Thunderforce craft and take to the skies! It's going to be alien-smashing on a grand scale, and only the most skillful pilots will survive the onslaught but you've made it through the previous battles, and there's no reason why that little ship shouldn't see you safely through this one. CREATE YOUR TIME TO KILL SOME ALIENS There's no time to hang about and admire the lovely scenery in Thunderforce IV there's alien scum to be blasted into a million pieces, and all the time they'll be trying to do exactly the same thing to you. That's a bit unfair, really while you have only four Thunderforce Fighters at your disposal (more can be picked up along the way if you're lucky), the baddies have armies of craft, ben loaded to the teeth with some of the galaxy's most devastating firepower! But hey are you a man or an Ambroxian Swamp-Thing? Just load up your guns and fire away! This boyo reckons he's a bit hard. Let's teach him a lesson! Well, not really. But you can select the order in which you tackle the stages. And you'll be spoilt for choice as to which one to begin with, as they all look so fab! But you won't have time for rambles in the country or topping up your tan on the sand because those aliens just keep on coming! Make sure you've got your contact lenses in though, because there's a couple of levels in here that use the same swirly backdrop effect as seen in earlier Thunderforce games, and they play havoc with the eyes! WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE? The two previous Thunderforce games were blasters par excellence (a bit of French to fox you there) and this latest from the Tecno Soft stable carries on the brilliance! All the hallmarks of the Thunderforce titles are in here the stupendous graphics with enormous sprites and incredible effects, incredible soundtracks that make your head pulse and your trigger-finger twitch along to the beat. Above all, there's that brilliantly addictive gameplay which forces you to have just one more go, even though you've died horribly twenty times, thirteen seconds into the first stage. This really is a difficult shoot 'em up, but one that you'll persevere with until completion and beyond. Don't delay, buy Thunderforce IV today. You'll be glad you did! If you like the look of Thunderforce IV, why not try Thunderforce II and III? Both games feature stunning graphics and rock hard gameplay which have kept the CVG boys up until the early hours. You'd be a bit foolish to miss out on these both are first class examples of just what a top-notch blaster should be like. What we'd like to know, though, is whatever happened to Thunderforce I?

"HUB E C Knock out! When you need a hand, why not pick up some extra firepower and let fly! POTS O' POWER-UPS Fed up with side wa y s scrolling shoot 'em ups featuring well 'ard aliens, tons of weapons and power-ups galore? You sad, sad case! Thunderforce IV is the latest in a long line of brilliant Megadrive shoot 'em ups, and it's one of the best of the lot. The first thing you'll notice about the game is the sheer speed of the gameplay there's one helluva lot going on and it can be a tad confusing if you've never played any of the Thunderforce games before. Even if you have, it's a tough enough challenge to keep you pounding the pad for aaages! One of the great strengths of the original Thunderforce games was that they set new standards in end-level bosses. Whilst number 4 doesn't exactly do that, there are some seriously wicked beasties just waiting to blast six bells out of you and make some well decent sounds as they do it! I'm going to be playing this one for a long time, and if you've got any sense you'll be doing exactly the same thing so buy it now. BIFF THE BIG BOSSES THANKS... You simply will not beliiieewwe the to Cambridge Consoles extra weaponry you can get your hands (0223 211733 ) on in Thunderforce M! Some of the for the review cartridge. enemies, when shot, release armament pods that slip into the weapons compartment of your craft, giving some truly amazing firepower with which to dust those nasties. There's the Blade. One thing you can always be sure about when it comes to shoot 'em ups is the which emits zig-zag bursts of flaming amind end-level guardian that's doubtless lurking about, waiting to blow you away with energy, Snake mines which prove some stupidly big gun. And Thunderforce IV is no exception. In fact, it seems as lethal on contact with alien spaceships.though there are more big guns than little 'uns! Bosses emerge from the sand Hunter missiles which, as their name, spitting energy balls at you, large robotic monsters guard the end of the levels suggests, go off in search of prey, and firing photon cannons from inside their heads, and that's all before you run into Free Way multi-directional firing misthe outrageously massive starcruiser with its own built-in guardian which detachsiles that your enemies es aren't es nisem aren't es itself from the main ship and attempts to slice you in two with its razor-sharp desperately keen on running into.

"MPUTER AND DEO GA GAMES GUIDE IIIIIIIII "


"U BEAT 'EM UP NER VIL A TOUCHDOWNNNNN! Welcome to the great CVG guide to the greatest games around, where we show our favourite games to the world and show YOU why they're the goodies you've GOT to have! An awful lot of umming and aahing went into this list, and after a good old scrap we decided that our all-time fave games are the ones you see here. Trouble is, we've got so many favourites we can't cram 'em all in here so we'll be printing the second half of these gaming glories next issue! So without further ado, turn over that page and get stuck into the Rolls Royce of gaming. There's nothing quite like it! 1. STREETFIGHTER II SUPER NES Think you're the tops at mindless violence? Think you can take on the best in the world and still stand? Well here's how to find out in the SNES conversion of the superb Streetfighter II. The game took the arcade world by storm and its staggering success was mainly due to the sheer simplicity of the coin-op. There were many doubts whether Capcom could reproduce the game on one cartridge. In the event, they simply squeezed the arcade machine into a 16-meg cart! A graphical masterpiece, the look of the coin-op has been captured perfectly. Sound is also stunning, with great music and brilliant sound effects and speech. Playability? There's oodles of it. Let's face it if you own a SNES and haven't got this game you probably need a doctor's prescription for whatever your ailment is. PS At the moment Streetfighter Il is currently only available on the Super Nintendo, but US Gold are curren verting it onto every single home computer format even the little old Spectrum. The games are due at Christmas, so stay tuned for more info the second it arrives! CR 3 PRESS FIRE 2. FINAL FIGHT SUPER NES Being a Mayor isn't all attending garden fetes and opening new restaurants. If your name's Mike Haggar there's always the chance to kick some Mad Gear ass and get your daughter back! Oh yes, it's girlie grabbing central once again. Haggar and his bestest pal Cody have been called upon to venture deep into Mad Gear land and rescue the lovely Jessica from their evil dutches. Again a top Super Nintendo conversion of the Capcom coin-op, but it does have its differences. There are only two characters, the industrial level has been missed out, there's no two player mode and, well, that's it really. OK, so it may have a level missing but the difficulty setting has been put right up to compensate. If you're into a bit of mindless violence this is the one for you. The Amiga version from US Gold is alright as well! 3. STREETS OF RAGE MEGADRIVE Mr Big is getting too big for his boots these days, so you and two pals have decided to go and sort him out. Trouble is, he owns a multi million drug ring and has access to some of the biggest headcases ever to undertake martial arts! Axl, Blaze and Adam have been recruited to go deep into Mr Big's territory and put a stop to his narcotic antics. However, this won't be as easy as it sounds as old Biggie has deployed all of the nasties in his clutches. It has to be said that Streets of Rage is a little Final Fighty. Mind you, don't think for one moment it's a blatant rip off. Streets of Rage indudes all the feafures we've come to expect from beat'em ups end of level baddies, objects to pick up and even a special weapon to get you out of the tightest spots. Streets of Rage manages something that Final Fight couldn't a two player mode, and there's a real emphasis on teamwork. Great in one player mode and a riot with two people, it may not be the toughest of games but it is one helluva laugh! PS Streets of Rage is currently only available on the Megadrive, but Sega are working on a sequel. More news soon! PGF PAUSE 4. FIRST SAMURAI AMIGA Are you hard enough to take on everything they can throw at you in the far Eastern world of the First Samurai? Can you use your cunning, agility and sword skills to overcome the toughest obstacles and meanest creatures? Course you can 'Cos you're hard, you are! That's the challenge in First Samurai, the great beat'em up which should have done an awful lot better than it has. The game suffered badly when Maxwell went under, and has only recently surfaced on a double pack compilation. But don't let that put you off this really is one of the best hack and slash laffs around, with gorgeous graphics and one helluva lot to do. A must for Amiga-owning hard men! PS Second Samurai is under development right now, and it's looking well wicked. Keep your peepers here for more info soon 5. INTERNATIONAL KARATE+ AMIGA Hurrah! A simple no-nonsence slice of punch and kick non-stop action courtesy of Archer McLean the same bloke who wrote Jimmy White's snooker. The game has been around for agages now, and in some respects it still hasn't been topped. This time round you get to scrap TWO opposing fighter one on each side of you and boy do they get tough! The game features some marvellous graphics and animation, complete with brilliant bonus screens. If you haven't got this you're in for a right old treat, so rush out and grab this little beauty as soon as you can! CVG "


"2999 SHOOT 'EM UPS MEEE100 OOOOO 1. GUNHED PC ENGINE Alien forces have taken over the world and are now running things as they see fit, but we earthlings are not standing for such nonsense. Immediately a lone ship is dispatched (although why they couldn't send loads of them I don't know) to deal with them. Gunhed is a straightforward no nonsence blaster. If it moves, kill it quick. Don't expect things to be easy though. The game grabs you by the throat straight from level one and refuses to let go. Graphics are truly amazing and the speed has to be seen to be believed. Sampled speech is just an example of the quality of the sound on this cart, which is one of the best blasters on any machine. 2. SMASH TV SUPER NES/NES The game show to end 'em all! Forget Running Man and Catchphrase. Instead of competing for petty prizes like holidays you're fighting for the only thing worth keeping your life! The game has a very simple format. One or two people are thrown into the studio, given a rather large gun and told to shoot everything! This is the height of video gaming violence never before have you seen so many baddies on screen at once! As for the sound...it's worth buying the stereo leads just to hear the amazing effects! Smash TV ranks as one of the toughest games you'll ever play, so go for it! PS Smash TV is currently also available on the NES and a Megadrive, Master System and game Gear version is currently being programmed. The NES version is the biz and from what we've seen of the others they're looking pretty good too. 3. SUPER ALESTE SUPER NES It's just not fair is it? Your entire galaxy has been taken over by marauding alien beings from far-flung worlds. And who has to go and straighten out the mess? You! Good job you kept that top-of-the-range flying deathmobile that you just happened to find laying around one fine day, because you're gonna need it. Any SNES owners who have played Gunhed on the PC Engine are in for a treat because this is basically the same game. As far as the obligatory extra weapons are concerned, there are tons. With twelve massive levels this is not a game you're going to beat too soon, but you won't give up until you do! 5. CONTRA SPIRITS SUPER NES It was a peaceful day on third earth until those foul beings from another galaxy moved in and took over again. The US government decides to do the decent thing sit back and ask a couple of Psychos named Bill and Lance Gryzor to march deep into the alien lair. Contra Spirits is the follow up to Contra and Super Contra, also known as Gryzor and Super Gryzor. Basically you're thrown into a platform-based landscape resembling Strider, given a couple of guns and the power to blow away anything you like! Contra Spirits uses every aspect of the SNES to produce an utterly amazing game. Fast furious and absolutely relentless, this will grab your attention from the very second you switch it on! 4. R-TYPE SUPER NES/PC ENGINE The Bydo Empire has seized control of part of the galaxy and wiped out everything in the region. Don't know about you, but we re not going to stand for that sort of nonsense. So jump in your technically advanced R-9 Fighter and take them on at their own game. R-Type set a trend in the world of arcade shoot 'em ups, and still manages to rank as one of the greatest blasters around. The arcader has been perfectly recreated on the Engine and I think it's fair to say that you d be hard pushed to find abetter conversion of anything anywhere! R-Type on the PC Engine actually comes as two carts. The first (R Type 1) containing the first four levels of the coin op and the second (R Type 2) containing the last four levels. You get a password when you finish the first cart so you can carry on on the second cart with the same weapons and score. Hassle? Well not really when the only other way to get the game this good would be fo wheel the coin-op into your bedroom! GVG 049 PAUSE "

"PLATFORM GAMES 3. SUPER SHINOBI MEGADRIVE Joe Mushashi stands alone sole survivor of a bloody massacre at the hands of the Neo Zeed. So sword in hand, off trots Joe in the direction of some violence. Once again this is a top rate conversion of the coin-op. Although Super Shinobi didn't set the arcade world alight in quite the way that the first did, it certainly makes an impression on the Megadrive, standing head and shoulders above the original in every respect. This is one well slick game, with jawdropping backgrounds and well wicked music. It's been around for quite a while now, but still ranks as one of the best beaters going so grab it while you can! DID DID ITD 1. SUPER MARIO 3 Bowser, King of the Koopas, has been up to his old tricks again. Not satisfied with princess-napping the Princess Toadstool twice before, he's gone and done it again. What an absolute cad! So it's up to you (or Luigi) to try and rescue her from the clutches of the evil one once again. Are you up to it? Hope so! Surprisingly enough, Mario 3 keeps the same basic format as the first two games and just piles on the entertainment, with secret rooms and pick-ups galore! This is one of the best games on Nintendo and one of the greatest of all time. Graphics are great but it's the gameplay which really stands out here head and shoulders above just about anything created before or since! Super Mario 3 still ranks CVG's highest rated game ever, so stop faffing about and rush out and buy it NOW! PRUSE? NI-SCORE 206800 SCORE 45200 SELECT THE NINJITSU ! JITSU OF IKAZUCHI 311ml 21DELITOUTTO IDIDUDU TMLXXX Alba Su 2. PC KID 2 PC ENGINE Prehistoric life wasn't all dodging dinosaurs and dragging your cavewoman back to the cave. Oh no! If you're a baldy slap-headed kid with the initials PC there's always the time when your thoughtless girlie goes off and gets herself kidnapped. Guess who's got to rescue her! PC Kid is a great platform romp with a strong comedy element. Think of it a prehistoric slaphead nutting dinosaurs and eating kebabs. Whatever next? The gameplay is very simple but incredibly addictive and enjoyable and the hours tick away as you play on and on. The cute graphics are Japanese through and through, and even the backdrops have been given star treatment. Gameplay is so addictive you won't want to put the pad down, and all in all this is totally bloody brill! 4. : 190 MEGADRIVE) AMIGA Christmas is coming and all is not well. The evil Dr Maybe has hatched a plan to take over the world, manufacturing psychopathic killer toys at his warehouse in the Arctic and unleashing them on the world. Who can help? James Pond, Underwater Agent's your man! Robocod is a platformer which borrows elements from many other games, but its weirdness is definitely the main feature. Graphics are super cutesy and the backdrops brill, while end level baddies are many and varied. The music is also very cute and you'll be tearing your hair out trying to stop the tune repeating in your head. Difficult? Oh yes. With stacks of levels and plenty of baddies to keep you busy it'll be a while before you tire of this. Great fun! 3 801 So TIME 1:31 RING 10 5. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG MEGADRIVE Dr Robotnik has been a naughty chappie. He's gone through seven zones kidnapping all the creatures and turning all the rest against mankind. So in steps Sonic the Hedgehog. Infuriated by what's gone on, he's decided to go and teach the evil Doc error of his ways. This is Sega's answer to Mario, and so much has been written about the game you'd probably drop off into slumberland if we repeated it here. Suffice to say this game's the biz, even if it is a tad easy, and you'd be a sad shambling wreck of a person to pass it up. 'Nuff said? SU U NOSLININ SESH GVG 052 "


"SPORTS GAMES TUBE OUCHDOW 1. KICK OFF 2 AMIGA SUPER KICK OFF MASTER SYSTEM Anco's superlative footy sim get the CVG vote as one of the All Time Greats. It's jam-packed with just about everything you could want from a footy game, and features fast action gameplay which is just out of this world! OK, so the graphics are titchy and the sound a bit poor, but who gives a twopenny about that with gameplay this good? The real beauty of Kick Off 2 is that you can never become too good, and there's always going to be someone out there who's better than you! This game is just the business, and if it's not in your collection you might as well go and hide of the bottom of the garden right NOW! 4. JOHN MADDEN AMERICAN FOOTBALL John madden was once coach of the top American Football team the LA Raiders but everyone has to give it up some time. So rather than retire altogether, EA have decided to get the big guy to put his name to the the best American Football sim around. Graphically this is one of the best looking games on the Megadrive with some amazing sprites and animation. The only other American Football game on the Megadrive was Cyberball but I think it's fair to say that Cyberball wasn't that great but now....well it just flails in comparison really. If you like American Football you'll love this! PS John Madden 2 is the one to go for if you haven't played the original. If you have, be aware the sequel's just more of the same only a little beefed up. SUTVICES Pinot PAUSE 5. EA HOCKEy Well y'all know the rules of ice hockey. Get the puck in the goal and don't get into too many fights! John Madden on the Megadrive was always going to be a tough act to follow, but EA have managed it in style. All the excitement of Ice Hockey has been captured perfectly, and the excellent graphics top everything off. Well worth your sheckels and no mistake! PS EA Hockey 2 is under development, but if you can't wait that long try the rather spiffy NHLPA Hockey, again from EA and coming soon! 3. SUPER TENNIS 2. SENSIBLE SOCCER Right from the outset, Sensi Soccer was billed as the game to remove kick Off 2 from the computer footy sim throne. A formiddable task if ever there was one! With 101 real clubs to chose from including Worldwide and English teams, there's real attention to detail here. Featuring roughly the same view of the action as Kick Off 2 (but more of the pitch and smaller players), Sensi Soccer comes out tops on realism but Kick Off 2 still gets the edge on fast action. The verdict? Sensi soccer is far more of a technical game of football with better options and more realism, but Kick Off 2 is a far faster and more action packed game. You pays your money you takes your choice! PS Anco are working on Kick Off 3 right NOW! Some of the additions to the game are fairly radical to say the least, but it's all Top Secret at the moment so stay on this channel for more news. Tennis is a strange sport really. Not a great many people bother to follow it until the infamous Wimbledon arrives. But if you can't wait that long to have a bash at it then fret not. Super Tennis is a two player sim of this traditional English sport. Play in a tournament or just against a friend on three different kinds of court. Get your kit on and get out there Jon! A staggeringly good game, Super Tennis is a blisteringly fast serve 'n' volley spectacular featuring brilliant gameplay and loads of nice touches. It's brill! GVG 053 "


"GVG BONUS STAGE 1. F15 STRIKE EAGLE 2 PC It's international conflict time again. Some nasty dictator-type has over taken parts of the world and it's up to you to go and sort it out with your top mayhem machine (otherwise known as an F15) and dish iut some serious Sidewinder-related bovver. First released many moons ago, F15 set impossible standards for other flight sims to follow. The superb 3D and the incredible gameplay just put this one head and shoulders above others of the ilk. Many flight sims have come and gone, but few have made the grade in terms in sheer brilliance. 2. DEVIL CRASH MEGADRIVE/PC ENGINE Ever wondered what the devil gets up to in the far reaches of hell? Tearing souls apart, dragging beings to the brink of despair or maybe playing the odd pinball game to relieve the boredom. Devil Crash is a three-screen high pinball sim which is the follow up to Alien Crash. This is actually one of the few pinball sims that utilises the possibilities of console pinball, and you won't be able to put the pad down for weeks. Here's a wicked sim from the gates of hell itself, and comes highly recommended. 'CLOS G23 120 -1S-15 BOOSTEN SE 906 Odas 150 300 172 3. CHUCK YEAGER'S AIR COMBAT PC Chuck Yeager was one of the best US Air Force test pilots to grace the earth, so he's been honoured by being handed his own special flight sim. Chuck Yeagers Air Combat is a sim of that old and noble art of Dogfighting (or air combat manouvering if you like). Take on any number of planes (you get the choice which ones and how many) and listen to the advice old Chuckie hands out. A simple concept but an incredibly polished game and a hoot and a half to boot. What more could you want? CHF 30 AMRI ZOHN 800 DO 5. F22 MEGADRIVE Take to the skies and take on the mightiest fighters the enemy can throw at you in this wicked flight and fight sim from Electronic Arts. All the complicated bits have been thrown out to provide a pick up and play blast second to none. Everything's whizzing about at a fair old lick and there's an awful lot to do on this ace cart that you'll keep coming back to. Take F22 for a spin just as soon as you can! 4. JIMMY WHITE'S SNOOKER AMIGA/ST Chalk up your cue and prepare for some serious snooker action in the best sim of the big balls game yet seen on home computers! Featuring fast moving smooth 3D graphics and all the rules of the game, JW's features just about everything you could want from the green beize. The only drawback is that it does get a bit boring in oneplayer mode, but tackle a mate and you're laughing! PS JW author Archer McClean is putting the finishing touches to 3D pool, using the same system as snooker. Read all about it in the Hotshots section!

"INDIANA (Incredible! As usual, CVG's first with the big solutions and this one is big! Big! BIG! Indy's quest into Atlantis has been thoroughly cracked by both ace game-buster Dermot Smurfit and CVG's very own editor Tim Boone. And because it's so huge, we've had to split this over a couple of months! So load up that game and go, Go, GO! Once you've bumbled your way through the intro sequence, you'll find yourself in your decrepit office/junkroom where Klaus Kerner promptly relieves you of your statue. One heroic scuffle later will see you on your way to New York in some neat threads to warn Sophia of the Nazi Agent. Once in New York you can grab the newspaper off the stand and slink round to the back of the theatre where all the crates lie. You've got to get to the fire escape, as talking to the hulking great doorman is a waste of time, so get pushing with those crates to create a path. Clambering up the fire escape will get you backstage, where you'll come across the crusty old stagehand. Give him the newspaper to get rid of him then push the left lever on the console. Now press the right lever and push the red button. One cringeworthy cut scene later will see you in private audience with Sophia. She'll show off her magnificent necklace, promptly demonstrating the magical properties of the Atlantean metal Orichalcum. IBM/PC BODI Bive Push Full Use Open Close Look at periscope Look at Sun stone moon stone Pick up : Talk to amber fish on : sting Sive Push full Use Open Close Look at Pick up Talk to Talk to Sophia sun stone moon stone whip amber fish on a string You'll now head off with Sophia to Iceland to check out your old dig site. Have a chat with Heimdall in the cave and ask him about Plato's lost dialogue. He'll give you a couple of names to follow up on. Head back to your jeep and zoom on over to Tikal. Plunging into the jungle will present you with several dark paths to take. The top right path will take you out of the jungle to the right but before you leave, give the furry thing a good whipping. The trick here is to chase it into a position where, when you whip at it, it will be scared into taking the path leading to the right. There the snake will attack it, leaving the tree free to use as a suspiciously convenient bridge across the ravine. On the other side you'll meet up with Sophia and Charles Sternhart. While they're getting to know each other, nip outside and pinch the Kerosene lamp from the stall. Re-enter the temple and open the Kerosene lamp. Use it on the tarnished spiral designs and you'll be able to pick them up. Use the designs on the animal head and give the trunk a good pull to reveal the tomb. Sternhart will rush off merrily with the World Stone (but don't panic, you can get it back later), leaving you to pick up the Orichalcum bead he missed. Leave the temple and get back to your jeep off to the right. Fly back to Iceland quickly. Inside the digsite, ignore the Heimdall popsicle and use the Orichalcum bead on the eel head to free the figurine. Grab it and head for the Azores. Mr Costa will tell you to get lost, so ask Sophia to give it a shot. Sure enough he is only too happy to oblige for a rare Atlantaen artifact. As Sophia, ask Indy to take over and offer the eel figurine in return for some CG 062 "


"JUNG JONES And FATE OF the ATLANTIS IBM/PC info. You'll be told the Lost Dialogue is in either the ward or the Pierce collection, which you'll find at the back of Indy's Barnett college. After an amusingly maniacal cut to Germany that is where you will find yourself. Follow Sophia back to your office and take a gander in the ice box. Grab the mayonnaise and go back to the college building. Go down to the basement and grab the dirty rag, picking up the coal from the pile before leaving. Climb the stairs to the first floor and view the school desk. You'll be able to identify a wad of chewing gum under the chair arm. Scrape it up before scrambling up the rope to the next floor. Here, take the arrow head from the back shelf. Now, if you are looking for the Pierce collection, you'll have to do the following use the mayonnaise on the Totem pole and pull it into position under the hole in the ceiling, clamber up it and open the urn on the floor. Rooting around in the ashes will reveal a key Slither back down the Totem pole and push the big crate on the left to one side. This will reveal a dusty old chest. Unlock the chest with the key this will reveal the Pierce collection and Plato's Lost Dialogue. Now, if you have been told to look for the Ward collection you'll have to search for it a floor down on the first floor. Once there, wrap the arrow head in the dirty wrap and use it to pry the screws out of the fallen bookcase. Lifting the case should reveal the Ward collection and the lost dialoque. Before returning to Sophia in your office, go back to the basement and use the gum on the chute to walk up it. Now pick up the wax cat figurine and use the piece of coal on the book hanging from the ceiling. Return to the basement and melt the wax cat in the furnace. This may not accomplish much but it gains Indy IQ points. Take the lost dialogue to Sophia and puruse the information in it very carefully. In every game you play the information contained will be slightly different, especially concerning the way in which you use the three stone disks to open the various gates later on. At this point you will also be able to choose which path you wish to take, either going it alone in a more action-orientated path through the game or joining forces with Sophia and choosing the team path. TEAM PATH From Barnett college go to Algiers. Walking over to chat to the knife thrower will reveal that he needs an assistant. Try persuading Sophia to help the guy, tell her it's perfectly in that colour and you must offer each one to safe. She'll go over and look at him. While the grocer until you find the one he wants, her back is turned push her (literally!) into then he'll give you the squab. Give the squab being the assistant. As a reward you'll get a to the beggar and he'll give you a balloon ride lovely little knife. Now go to the back left to ticket. Take that up the stairs and give it to Omar Al-Jabbar's shop. You need the balloon man. Once in the balloon a quick something to convince Omar that you are slash of your knife will set you on your way. genuinely interested in Atlantis. Something Drifting around the desert takes a little pracwhich you don't have. Pick up the mask on tice to land somewhere just keep circling the wall and ask how much. He'll let you downwards. Drift around and visit the various have it for free. Nomad camps. The nomads will give you Grab the next plane to Monte Carlo, where hints as to where the digsite is so follow the you'll have to find a Mr Trottier. directions until an X appears on the While Sophia goes into the Hotel to tart landscape. Go there to find the dig. herself up for a seance you get to loiter with intent outside. Try talking to the man in the brown suit and grey suit. Ask him about Trottier.

"PIE REVIEW PURPLE RAIN MASTER SYSTEM PLATFORM BRAND The only way in which the Space Mutants can carry out their dastardly deeds and take over the world is to find all the purple obiects they can. So naturally Bart's mission is to hide all the purple objects! He can do this in a number of ways: spray them red with a can of spray paint is one, whilst walking over things like bedsheets to cover them up is another. Clever lad, eh? BY ACCLAIM ETBA an MUTANT MAYHEM! THE HESONS BART SIMPSONS hock horror! There was Bart Simpson happily minding his own business, when all of a sudden the blue dreaded Space Mutants attack the earth! Well, Mr Underachiever himself is not about to sit around and let this happen. Well, not today anyway. So single handedly (no-one else can be bothered) our young anti hero sets off in search of some terrifying alien scumbags! Who will win the terrifying battle of Bart v The Space Mutants. If you're smart, you'll have your money on the aliens... Bart v The Space Mutants has been around for quite a while on just about every format and soon it'll probably be available for every machine known to man! The home computer and console versions are virtually the same, distinguished only by the strengths and weaknesses of the machine the game's running on. Luckily the Master System version holds up very well against the spanky 16-bit competition. Hurrah! SPA EMUTANTS TOOL DRLO SCORE LEPE FARE ALS FAME AND FORTUNE If the Simpsons look new to you then you must be some strange kind of hermit-type person who's only just emerged from his cave. The Simpsons have been around for ages now and they're getting more popular all the time. Unfortunately, the only way you can witness Bart's cartoon-related japery is pay oodles of cash for a satellite dish. Then again, you could always round your mate's house, watch it on his telly and then hog his console for ages. Unfortunately you can only do this once, because he probably won't invite you again... EEEEEEEEEEEEE FIRE as della TXEE Deeweb@@e TAGne To CORE os Bart on the Master System is just about identical to the NES version, which wasn't at all bad and provided a fair few laffs for all and sundry. The graphics on this version are nice and jolly, but don't quite manage to capture the cartoon feel of the series. However the game itself is quite a laugh the combination of platform tomfoolery and strategy elements combine quite well to provide a challenge you'll keep coming back to. The only real drawback is the lack of variety in the game, and the ultra-simplistic graphics don't exactly help here. At the end of the day, Bart v The Space Mutants is a thoroughly respectable Master System cart guaranteed to keep the fans happy, even if it could have been better with more variety and a better overall feel. Try and take a look before parting with your hard-earned. STRATEGY SKILL % GRAPHICS % SOUND 78 GAMEPLAY % VALUE % 77 OVERALL 78 074 PAUL ANGLIN ACTION REFLEXES "


"DISNES LIE REVIEW Questes In The Magic Kingdom *** WHO'S THAT KID? NES PLATFORM The main character of Adventures in the Magic Kingdom isn't Mickey at all. It's not even one of his Disney chums. Oh no, it's some poor kid who got dragged away from his holidaymaking antics to try and find the sacred golden key and all because he thinks Mickey Mouse is great. He's not wrong there! BY CAPCOM .99 THE RIDE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR N ickey and his pals were all getI ting ready for the Big Parade. The cheerleaders were ready, the floats were decorated and the tourists had taken their places. \"Okay Goofy,\" said Mickey. \"Go get the Golden Key.\" \"Er, what key?\" says Goofy in that bigtoothed, grinny sort of way. «You mean the one that's done a bunk and is hidden somewhere in Disney World?\" Mickey thought hard and scratched his ear. \"That's the sucker,\" he said eventually. \"We better get looking. Disney is a large place and we've only got a few minutes left. Let's get to it!\" Well actually, he didn't. I just made all this up, but the key IS missing and they've got to look for it. Look, I didn't write the script I just play the games! You can't go to Disney World and not indulge in the many pleasures of the top rides on the premises. These include the runaway train, racing, Autopia cars through obstacles, diving into the deep black depths of Space Mountain and answering as many questions as you can. Best of all, you don't have to stand in the queues or pay_any cash travel agents! I'VE STARTED SO I'LL FINISH Hope your Disney knowledge is up to scratch because it's going to be tested to the full here. As many people are looking for the Golden key you have to prove that you really are Mickey's friend. Whenever you ask about the key you're asked to answer a question. Get it right and you'll move on through the quest. Get it wrong and slumber in the lulls of sadness forever! 111CKEY \"HEY. GOOFY! ITS TIME FOR THE BIG PARADE 1WHERE'S THE GOLDEN THE CATE? TUR So you've never been to Disney World? Never experilees enced the thrills of one of the greatest places on the planet? Not to worry! Courtesey of Capcom you can now indulge in as many Thunder Mountainrelated japes as you wish. Disney's Adventures in the Magic Kingdom (as well as being a bit of a mouthful) is a bit of a role playing game crossed with a few bits of platform action, plus a bit of trivia topped off with...well everything else really! That's the beauty of this cart it's everything rolled into one and there's stacks of it in there. The little sub games split up all the different action very well and there's always plenty to do. This cart is a right old laugh and well worth the effort for Disney fans everywhere. As the main mouse himself would say: \"Neat!\" STRATEGY SKILL GRAPHICS % 82 SOUND % 72 GAMEPLAY % 89 VALUE % 86 OVERALL 87 CVG 072 PAUL ANGLIN ACTION REFLEXES "

"QUE REVELL SELECT GAME SUPER NINTENDO C PLATFORM PE.EE 2011 Du  BY CAPCOM .00 120407FLAME Illustration by Matt Lyons razy old world, eh? A short and stumpy lad with a bed pan jammed onto his head is trapped in a land infested with bubbles. Armed with a souped-up spear gun, our boy must burst every bubble on the screen to clear a path to the next world and escape. When the bouncing balls are burst they split up, Asteroids fashion, into smaller balls until the screen is covered with minute globules of goo ricocheting all over the place! By dodging the debris and keeping your cool you'll be able to blast the gunge and move on. It's as simple as that! DONT HAVE A COW MANE There are two sides to Super Pangthe arcade game and a special 'Panic' section which provides nonstop bursting action. Just fight your way through as many waves of spheres as possible, blasting the scores of balloons which descend from all sides. Sound easy? Do me a favour! POR (34 uandu 04 MORE ANIMAL ANTICS It's a lonely place out there in Pangland, and most of the time it'll just be you and the blobs for company. However, you're not the only kid on the block because a whole host of small critters bounce about as the mood takes them. Flying tomatoes and insects come on in droves, breaking up the bubbles in their path and showering a deluge of tiny dots onto your head, while small Dragons jump out from the sides to climb around the platforms. These have to be shot and given a good kicking to get rid of them, and who's going to argue with that? 2880 or 063 GRCO 04 .. PASS THAT UZI NOW! .. T31EAR .... . TIME BONUS 100% 55= 5500 . Don't be fooled by the absence of tons of fire spitting technicoloured monsters or gigantic guardian sprites. Super Pang plays better than it thr looks just! There's not much variety here as the backdrops and a few strategically placed platforms are the only parts that change to break the monotony. Having said that, the basic idea of breaking up the blobs with a variety of weapons and pick-ups is surprisingly addictive. The game's four difficulty levels make sure that however nimble you are on the joypad they'll always be a setting that you'll rip your hair out on. Super Pang won't hold your attention for months, but it'll bring you back for the odd game when other carts have long lost their appeal. Anyone who hasn't come across the game before can easily live without it and only those who were absolutely crazy about the coin-op should consider parting with their money. Old news and easily outclassed now. CVG 074 PAUL ANGLIN It's tough at the top, and at the bottom. If you've only got a single shot grappler to burn rubber with, you'll be glad to hear that some of the blocks explode when you hit them and reveal small cubes which can be picked up and provide loads of extras. Just a few of the power-ups are the multi shots, angled shots, fruit for bonuses, grappling hooks and even protective bubbles! .. ..7 3 kg MUMEO 55 HORLO 12 STRATEGY SKILL 45 GRAPHICS % SOUND GAMEPLAY % VALUE VALUE % OVERALL 60 59 ACTION REFLEXES "

"LUG REVIEW NIM NEO GEO BEAT 'EM UP BY SNK/ALPHA /80p/play TWO-PLAYER TREATS VIOR SELLE One of the delights of beat 'em up games is the opportunity to get a friend round, slot in a second stick and indulge in sad-pal bashing for fun and hilarity. World Heroes' twoplayer option certainly scores pick your fighter, get your mate to select his, choose where in the world you want the ass-kicking antics to take place and get those fists-a-flying and feet-a-flailing! The best battlers on Earth are gathering for the ultimate fighting contest the World Heroes Tournament! The rules are simple there aren't any! Just beat up your opponent, knock him out twice in three rounds and move on to the next, more dangerous, combatant. Sound familiar? SNK can't put Streetfighter 2 onto the Neo Geo, so instead they've put their thinking caps on and got Alpha to come up with a fight fest all of their own. Go up against a horde of headkicking heroes from around the globe and, well, kick their heads in! Use various moves to finish them off, including the odd sneaky special attack, and whittle down the opposition's energy before he does the same to you. Got the idea? Now go out and do some damage! DECISIONS Get ready for DECISIONS Streetfighter japes on your Neo or not. World Heroes may look great, but when it comes to the crunch it isn't actually all that hot. Yes, it's packed with fab graphics (although some of the sprites could do with a touch more life) and super sounds, but with a memory capacity totalling 100 megs-plus, that's only to be expected. The problem is there just isn't enough here to keep the attention. Unlike its famous forefather, World Heroes is devoid of any tactics. One of the easiest ways to kill people is by timing your jumps so that you're in the air as your opponent is landing, putting you in a perfect position to let off a kick punch or whatever. Bouts are over all too quickly, and there's the horrible 'feature' of getting stuck in the corner while the enemy kicks bits out of you. It may be big, but World Heroes isn't bold enough to challenge Streetfighter 2. mos FINE AND FULSOME FIGHTERS Like its Capcom counterpart, World Heroes gives the player a lengthy list of battlers to choose from. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses the Bruce Lee character, for example, is a bit of a weed but can perform some lightning fast moves. There's also a girl in there to select, kitted out in full armour and using a whacking great sword to deal with her enemies! FREE PAUL RAND "


"REVE COD DO MIGHTY MOVES BUT NOT LOTS The first thing you'll discover about the moves in World Heroes is that there aren't many. But do not despair, because there's a couple of well-wicked special attacks which, like in Streetfighter 2, are accessed by some nifty joystick control. The only snag is, they're not half as easy to either figure out or perform and once you know what to do, and you'll probably end up getting big lumps knocked out of you as you wrestle with the buttons! SIZE ISN'T Impressed by the size of Streetfighter 2 on the Super Nintendo? You should be it's the first ever 16-meg game to hit the machine. But we all know that the Neo can fit 16-megs into its little toe, which is why SNK have gone and made World Heroes over TEN TIMES the size of its illustrious counterpart! What that means for the gamer in layman's terms is massive sprites, sampled sound and a walloping price tag should you decide to buy it! There have been scores of Streetfighter 2 rip-offs lately, and this promised to be one of the best. The power of the Neo coupled with the violent hilarity of Streetfighter 2? Sounds like the dream ticket. But with the Super Nintendo classic ruling the roost, does World Heroes stand a chance? Not really. Smart graphics and brilliant sounds simply don't make up for the game's lack of depth and, while there are plenty of characters to choose from and fight against, they mostly fail to provide any real challenge. As for the special moves, they're okay but somewhat on the spartan side and they're difficult to pull off. It's a bit sad really, 'cos with all that memory this could have been something really special. As it stands World Heroes won't be giving Capcom sleepless nights. It's definitely worth a few goes in the arcade, especially if you can find a pal to scrap, but that's about all. PAUL ANGLIN Hoe CVG'S HOTTEST HEROES! STRATEGY SKILL TIM BOONE: My fave fighter is Drag. on because he wiggles his hands like a Harry Enfield scouser (caalm down lads!) and goes 'Woooh!' when he wins. Pity about the crap Rand-style deck shoes he wears... PAUL RAND: My fave fighter is Janne, cos she's got a big sword that wipes everyone out including Dragon as Tim Tops At SF2' Boone has learnt to his cost (ha). And she's a bit of a darlin' too... STEVE KEEN: Fuuma is the tops for me because he's got smart long hair, just like me. Except he doesn't tie it back and that's dangerous. Remember kids, your flowing locks could get entangled in machinery or a hard person's size 10s... PAUL ANGLIN: Mine's got to be Rasputin, because he's got big hands and is really funny when he spins round and does people in with his dress-type thing.

"ARCADE Dead Connection Times are hard now that the American Government have banned alcohol in the prohibition. Mafia hoodlums have taken control of the bootleg trade and started selling booze at illegal bars known as Speakeasies. But Police are not standing for this, and in a police-Mafia shootout an innocent woman was killed. Now her family has sworn vengeance, so Tommy guns in hand they trot off in search of death destruction and some serious vengeance... WEAPONS GALORE SPEAKEASY LAD As the unfortunate girlie in question had a rather large family, there are a number of people who've sworn vengeance. Each have different weapons and different coloured trench coats. There are a total of four characters by the name of Philip, Gary, Eddie and James. They all start the game with a different weapon but lose it after a certain amount of time. Boo! Dead Connection is based on a true event in America in the 1920s. The American government made yet another amendment to the American constitution, proclaiming alcohol illegal. All that did was create bigger problems than ever and create one of the most famous gangsters of all time Al Capone! "


"EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE The idea behind Dead Connection is a nice one, and at first sight the game appears a complete blast and a half. Trouble is, the novelty soon wears off when you realise it's not exactly very hard! Someone's obviously decided to be kind to gamesplayers here, and the result is that the game gets pretty boring pretty quickly. Graphics are a bit of a treat, sound's pretty good and there's always a heck of a lot going on but at the end of the day this isn't a game you're going to want to come back to time and time again. Well worth a few goes down at Dr Spanky's Loose Change Emporium, but your interest will quickly start to wane because, for all its good points, there's just not enough long-term challenge here. Pity really, 'cos it is a good laugh! TIM BOONE DEAD CONNECTION NERROZIA HAD ALREADY VANISHED. BUT THE ACCOUNTANT.  E  . DICENT. SAUERLED There are ten levels in Dead Connection, each taking place in a different scenario. The backdrops change from a warehouse to a festive garden party and a street in mid winter to a smart and posh restaurant. All contain tons of baddies which have to be taken care of before you can move on to the next level. DON'T SHOOT ARCADE by TAITO There's a large amount of scenery in Dead Connection, and the point of telling you that is because you can shoot it to release tons of pickup goodies. These include wallets which give you extra points, documents which give you evidence (not much use realiy considering you've shot all of the suspects) and guns that give you, er, guns! 30P PER PLAY STRATEGY SKILL TOMMY'S GUN Each character starts the game off with their own weapon, but that soon runs out and leaves way for a standard pistol. However, other guns are there for the taking and there's a really smart revolver, a well 'ard shotgun, a pretty good pistoltype thing and the famed, not to mention effective, Tommy Gun. Pick 'em up and let rip! ACTION REFLEXES 005270 oszto. 82 GRAPHICS SOUND % % 80 GAMEPLAY % VALUE % 63 OVERALL 69 "

"BIG HOTSHOTS E GODS O SUPER NINTENDO hat do you do when one of the most powerful deities in the cosmos gets together with a few of his divine mates and asks you to go on a quest for him? Well you don't refuse, that's for sure! Gods sent Amiga users ga-ga with its fancy graphics, huge monsters and puzzle-infested gameplay, and now it's set to do the same on the SNES! This conversion has made a few improvements to the overall look and sound of the game with some completely new tunes and in game music plus some extremely attractive parallax scrolling, not found in the original. All the monsters and sprites seem to have been given Air Nikes as they move a lot faster, but apart from that the game-play is exactly the same. O Strut around four different worlds, climbing ladders and jumping off platforms, collect the different power-ups, gems and ancient artifacts and defeat the end of level guardians. What made the computer versions so special was the addition of loads of levers, pulleys, secret passages and blocks that have tons of different combinations, viding different rewards when positioned in the right places. This meant that you'd be playing the game for weeks and still be discovering new treasures and rooms previously unseen. Bit of a laugh, eh? Full Review soon! 414141 GVG 36 "

"ZU HOTSHOTS TERMINATOR STONE THE CROWS! Not only does CVG venture forth and grab the Exclusive Nintendo Preview of Terminator, we've flippin' well snapped up the Super Nintendo version as well! So without further ado, here's everything you need to know about these white hot little numbers. How Do we do it? O (NES) 11 rnie's back! Well, as far as the NES is concerned he's never actually been away, but we'll gloss over that. The first Terminator film is starting to show it's age now, so the game is about to breath new life into the movie. Although the sprites don't look much like their film counter parts, there are plenty of graphic screens depicting the heroes and heroines spread between the game-play sections to spice things up and bring you back into the feel of things. Taking the unenviable role of rock hard bodyguard Kyle Reice, you must complete every stage of several preset missions set over hundreds of platformed scenes. The heat seeking Terminators come in two sizes, but both are as deadly as each other and in order to destroy Sky Net you'll need every piece of hardware you can find. Some of the Terminators are cloned as humans, but you'll soon weed them out because they'll be the ones trying to fricassee your bladder with machine gun fire. Due for release very soon. Watch this space! GU SUPER NINTENDO O eing one of the most eagerly awaited games on the SNES, Terminator has a lot of catching up to do. The Super Nintendo version is loaded with atmosphere and cannon fodder for you to wreak havoc upon. All the sections are linked with actual digitised pics that correspond to the appropriate sections in the film. Some of the Terminators patrol the apocalyptic wilderness in their metallic form and creep out of the shadows to grab you, whilst others appear as humans and need a fare few blasts before their flesh peels of to reveal the shining ectoskeleton underneath. s and jumps through a post nuclear junk yard, roof tops, guts a police station, enters into car chases with the T100 and has his final show down with Arnie in the robotic factory, just as he does in the film. All the usual armaments, including heat seeking missiles and grenades, plus huge end of level monsters are out to grab your attention with punks, gun totting policemen and bikers. The Animated intro sequence is short, but stunning and the finished game should be a massive hit with platform shoot 'em up fans and Arnie lovers alike. Look out for our red hot CVG Review next month. TEATEATEATTER AVG 33 "

Well, the big news for fans is that JW maestro Archer MacLean is back again with 3D pool and it's just as accurate as snooker was! Forget the slightly sad 8-bit 3D pool games (apart from Firebird's, which was ace), because 3D pool already (9) CLE looks like it's in a different league! Basically, 3D pool IS pool on the Amiga, and the only thing missing is the ability to slap down a rather large wad of cash and say \"Bet you don't make that shot, matey!\" Already the game is looking FAST, using the same graphics routines as snooker but tweaked for super smooth ball control. All the little touches are in there too the faces and the flies. Virgin say the game is perfect for people who prefer pool to snooker, but we reckon loads of you are going to want to buy both because this is looking a bit special. Watch out for the full lowdown soon! MEGADRIVE o you want to be a bit of a hard case, eh? Want to rule over everyone and swank about a bit while all your minions have to bow and scrape and say \"Thank You My Lord\" every time you break wind? Well, now you have two choices either become President of the United States (tricky) or play Mega-Lo-Mania on your Megadrive! Yes indeedy, one of the best power sims on the Amiga is set to be unleashed on Megadrive soon, cour tesy of Virgin. Programmers Sensible Software (you know, the people behind SensiSoccer) are putting the finishing touches to the game right about now, and it should be in the shops soon. For sad halfwits who don't know any different. Mega Lo-Mania puts you in charge of a fairly whiffy little band of so-called men who couldn't really fight their way out of a paper bag 'cos they're a bit thick really and haven't worked out how to use weapons yet. It's up to you to make sure that they learn, and quick, because opposing forces are gathering to kick some serious behind! As you progress through the game the weapons at your disposal become more and more sophisticated until ultimately you face your adversaries with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and an itchy trigger finger! The game went down a storm on the Amiga, even if it did suffer when Cap'n Bob took a midnight swim, and as you can see it's looking a right old lati on console! Watch for the full CVG Review soon!
