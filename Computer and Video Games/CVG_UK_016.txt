"Hot-on-the-heels of the Book of Games comes our Book of Reviews in the March issue. Our next issue boasts a free giveaway guide to all kinds of computer games, who supplies them and how they compare. We have sections on adventure games, chess, draughts, othello and backgammon games, arcade maze games, space attack games, novelty games and many more. There's expert advice on how to choose the particular type of game you are interested in, what you should be looking for and what standards to expect. Confessions of a Bug For those of you unfamiliar with particular games, we have devoted a page to explaining the differences between Donkey Kong and Frogger, how to recognise a Galaxian when you see one and how to tell whether a Pacman ghost is edible or not. Each cassette or disc reviewed is marked in our usual three categories, Getting Started, Value and Playability and if it scores three 10s you know our judges have been suitably impressed. It all adds up to the most striking work yet on games software and it's free inside every copy of Computer & Video Games. All you Seventh Empire competitors will need our March issue to check on your new position in the Seventh Empire game. You might have proved to be the best fleet commander in the galaxy and earned vourself a Colour Genie on the way But even if you work out your score to be well behind the leaders, keep your fleets on the move in March there's still plenty of time to catch up. Among our top games for March will be: a version of Donkey Kong featuring Mario the carpenter and an escaped gorilla; Digger will ask you to dig a hole and trap a rampaging alien; there's Skiing, Rockfall and Dr Who Adventure. WHAT'S BUGGIN' YOU? So you think it's easy being a Bug huh? Well you should try sneaking a dodgy listing past the Computer & Video Games testers. The month of January tho', we didn't do too bad. Mal Function managed to pull a whole host of lines out of the ZX81 game Curse of the Aztec Tomb (shown below). On Cave Flight most of you managed to spot the two arrow errors.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPET. Solving our earth invading PIRATE WITH A HEART OF GOLD puzzle It's the turn of space pirate Austin Cambridge to hold forth on our special C&VG computer moderated game of Starweb, which is now drawing to a close. Austin's views on the galaxies of Starweb are reported faithfully by Anthony Shepherd, below. Saving the Earth from the alien hordes was the problem we set you last month and the more spirited defenders amongst you replied swiftly enough to keep our atmosphere free for eons to come. The best solution Trevor Truran could manage was 21 shots to clear the atmosphere, or just two missed shots. His best effort began at F and went on: A, E, B, E, C, C, D, B, F, B, C, C, F, C, A, D, A, C, D, F. We will be publishing the winning names next month. And Trevor's back with another Puzzling column in March. I'm the brighter buccaneer, the Simon Templar of the Space lanes, the man in the white space helmet. I may be a Pirate King but I am a Good Guy. I seek out and eliminate the outposts of my arch enemies, the oppressive Berserkers. One of these, Gzinti, has been a thorn in my flesh with his absurd threats and impudence. Another, a former ally of mine, threatened me recently so I sent the fleets in. I liberate the oppressed prey of Berserkers, set free those under the yoke of Empire Builders like Merchants and Artifact collectors. And what do I take in retur? I do not seek to kill populations or make people work hard on my fleets, all I ask for the liberation of the oppressed is a little piece of the boodle, a few spondulix, some wherewithal, little to ask for my services to lifekind. It must be shown that aggression does not pay, aggressors must be punished, and I am the man capable of such a feat. I am amassing a Task Force. A collection of fleets, this force will be so fast that when in Battle formation it will almost blot out the most powerful of Suns. A force so huge and powerful that Berserker robots will quail at its presence, and Apostles will pray at its coming. This task force will be headed by myself in the flagship, A.C. Freedom-for-All ready to wage terrible war on evil-doers. We will fight them on the Spacelanes, at the planets and near the Black Holes, there will be blood, oil, and tears, but we will never surrender ... There is No Alternative but to stand up and fight. The time for Diplomacy is over, the time for action is here. Fight, we will, for the elimination of Berserkers and lifekind's inexorable right to be free! I am so cool I could fluster a Penguin, and I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Never let it be said that Austin Cambridge did not play the major role in the freedom of the Galaxy. * A GOOD HOME FOR A DRAGON The Sorcerer's Stone has captured a Dragon for its creator. Andy Burras of Lindle Lane, Hutton, Preston in Lancashire, is the worthy winner of the Fantasy Game Competition we set in our November issue. He wins a Dragon 32 microcomputer on which to pursue his thirst for fantasy games. And he is also being invited down by Mitre Wargames, which judged the competition entries, to discuss putting Sorcerer's Stone into operation as a new computer moderated game format to be played commercially. Mark Blundell, of Mitre Wargames was impressed by the high standard of entries and offers his commiserations to the unlucky entrants, but felt that Sorcerer's Stone came closest to a workable computer moderated game format. \"The author had put a lot of thought into how the game could be put onto a computer,\" said Mark. Sorcerer's Stone is a game for 12-15 players, who each takes control of a wizard in a tower. The aim is to capture the Sorcerer's Stones by making use of the wizard's orcish, elven and dwarvish servants and casting spells by using up power points. The game has been well planned out for use on a computer and Mark is confident that he will be able to report on a new fully-fledged British computer-moderated game in the autumn. A Dragon 32 will be winging its way, courtesy of Dragon Data, to Andy in Preston. Apologies if you are still waiting for news of our pinball competition, which was run over August and September. Bally's US Pinball Division have had a tough job sorting through the huge pile of entries we sent Stateside but Bally are announcing the winner next month to coincide with the UK Amusement Trades Exhibition. So keep your fingers crossed. COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETI "

"Peter Linton takes a break from our Prestel page this month as DAVID BABSKY brings you up to date on a brand new and exciting development Micronet 800 Ull THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME Prestel, as you may know by now, was a marvellous idea to send constantly updated information down the phone wire. A small adaptor was plugged into your office phone line, and it turned telephone signals into the right kind of weak electric currents which you could feed into the aerial socket of an ordinary T.V. set. And the buzzes and whistles which came down the Prestel phone wire reconstituted themselves into pictures on your screen — showing stocks and share prices, or railways timetables, or the day's latest newsflashes. Now I'm talking about all this in the past tense, because those particular uses of Prestel are rather fading into history. your telephone system. And it also means there's no chance of any unusual voltages jumping back and forth between your computer and the phone line. The choice of programs seems extremely varied: there'll be educational programs to use in schools and colleges, games programs similar to Pacman and space invaders and then out of the home league there'll also be business programs. Acornsoft have put some of their BBC programs onto Micronet; BugByte, Microdeal and Bridge Software are just some of the firms with ZX81 programs on the system. These programs — and all the others from major distributors — will cost far less on Micronet than they do if you buy them in a shop or by mail-order. There are also hundreds of free games on Micronet, and the chance to win big prizes. THE HOOK THE SYSTEM... Prestel never really caught on with people sitting round the telly at home because static screens of information look rather boring, and there was nothing much on Prestel that you couldn't find out by simply looking in a newspaper which is far cheaper than the - or so which the phone-line adaptors would cost! But now there's a new homeorientated use for the Prestel idea: instead of just sending pages of information to read off your screen — like the BBC's Ceefax, or ITV's Oracle it's possible to send home-computer programs down the wire. And to make it cheaper for everyone to hook up to the service, British Telecom and the publishers of Computer & Video Games, EMAP have got together to provide a .95 phone-to-computer adaptor. their keyboard to get to the Micronet area of Prestel. The first few hundred programs on Micronet 800 will be for the BBC A and B micros, the Apple computers, TRS-80s RML 380/480Z machines, and Commodore Pets. Phone adaptors for these will be available straight away. And they'll be followed shortly afterwards by programs for the Sinclair machines, as Clive is due to make phone-toSpectrum and phone-to-ZX81 adaptors available at the beginning of 83. These adaptors are all (except for the Sinclair versions) what's called \"acoustic modems\" — acoustic means they operate by sound waves. So there's no direct attachment to the phone line; you just put your telephone receiver into the two plastic cups on the adaptor, and your micro and Prestel then talk to each other just like an ordinary human conversation! This acoustic coupling cuts out the need to actually have British Telecom come round and add an extra \"hard-wire\" connection to C&VG has come to a deal with Micronet over games programs and any you send in for whatever micro, we will pass onto the Micronet validation team. So, as well as seeing your program published in C&VG, you'll have a chance of earning royalties from Britain's latest electronic magazine. The whole idea of this programsdown-the-phone-line excitement came about through carefully evaluating what goes into a proper purpose-built Prestel reciever. It has a screen — but so has a home computer. It has an alphanumeric keyboard — and so, too, does every personal computer. Some Prestel sets, only have a numeric keyboard, and these can't be used for sending messages to other users. With a home computer you can type electronic messages to all or any other Micronet users!) Home computers also have inbuilt memory, and cassette or disc recorders for storing information so once a program has come down the line you can keep it for ever! Thus it was just one small logical step from using a home computer to process information, to using it to retrieve or receive that gamesprogram information from a central Prestel or Micronet computer. Incidentally, Micronet are paying a handsome 20% royalty on any programs of yours that they put on the system. Their address is Petersham House, 57a Hatton Garden, London ECIN 8JD. IN THE NET... Programs will be available from January on this new service — which is called Micronet 800. \"Micronet\" because it'll evolve into a network for microcomputers, and \"800\" because that's the number which existing Prestel users tap into 22 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"TAMING THE INVADERS David Langford discovers that there is more than just one way to save planet Earth BETTER REPORT BACK....... NO SIGN OF INTELLIGENT LIFE! GAME FOR A LAUGH Once again those vile space invaders hang in the sky. Once again they throb their evil way downward, and once again it's only your staggering marksmanship which can save Earth from being overrun. Difficult, isn't it, to read these stirring words without suppressing a yawn? But there may be a new twist to the old game yet. Since the days of H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds, the trend in science fiction has been for our heroes not to zap the alien hordes on sight, but to try and establish some kind of communication. For some strange reason games programs have lagged behind, perhaps because shooting space invaders seems more exciting, perhaps because it looks more difficult to program for communication. We can keep the element of threat in a game of communication by remembering all those SF stories in which the tiniest misunderstanding leads to total and terrifying war. In Joe Haldeman's novel The Forever War, it's just a small communication error which causes the thousand year interstellar war between Us and Them. A man in one of James White's stories tries to win the favour of cuddly aliens by kissing babies, but unfortunately the aliens assume that this Earthling carnivore is merely hungry. Rather more subtle is Peace by Ian Watson, where war is provoked only when humans ask the aliens to agree to a peace treaty. The aliens' reasoning is, roughly, \"If these humans are so barbaric and obsessed with war they need a special treaty to prevent them from fighting, it is clear that they are deeply in need of extermination.\" Back to the keyboard. Imagine a program scenario in which an alien fleet advances slowly on you, waiting for intelligent signals but with its patience slowly dwindling, while the only weapon you have is some means of transmitting messages plus, of course, your own gigantic intelligence. This is a highly realistic situation, come to think of it. These are all the weapons most of us have against such loathsome beings from beyond the outer galaxies as the Inland Revenue, the Post Office, Customs & Excise... In the listing as given here, you can bash out signals to the alien horde as fast as you like. Every so often another invader joins the fleet in the skies; eventually they'll overrun you by sheer weight of numbers. But when one of your messages is such that the aliens decide you may be 24 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES intelligent, they pause and retreat a little. If you can manage a whole series of \"intelligent\" signals to the invaders, then each successive signal will normally cause a bigger retreat until at last the sky is clear again — but a mistake may set you back to square one! It's up to you, then, to work against time and deduce what sort of simple messages can persuade the aliens to go away. Beware: there are traps. Because aliens are deeply suspicious of mere repetition you might only be a parrot the same message will not work twice. Obviously you can rewrite the program to change the type of intelligent signal for which it looks. A little study of the listing here will tell you the method used in my prototype program, though it won't help much if you want to cheat: in any case it's more fun to discover these things by playing the game than by analysing the listing. You could easily alter the program to make the key signal a particular computer-generated key word, so the game would become something like Mastermind or Hangman played against time. | Or perhaps the aliens themselves could be made to send signals, to which you have to respond, following alphabetical or mathematical sequences which you must get right? Or, ultimately, the computer could generate an artificial alien 'language in which they talk to you, your job being to decipher enough of it to send peaceful messages back... but perhaps the ideas are now getting a bit ambitious for a mere micro. As usual, the listing is for a TRS-80, level IIbut I'm buying another computer soon! As usual, you're encouraged to adapt the program to whatever other machine you may have there are no particular subtleties. Note that line 60 puts together the graphics for an invader. To make the game run faster, you can reduce the value of TM in line 2030 — beginners may prefer to increase TM and slow the game down. To increase the playing time after which the aliens lose patience and swarm over you — increase the value of K in the same line. So once again the enormous fleet of space invaders darkens the sky. Only you can save the Earth from being overrun. From deep in the armoured command base, you aim your mighty radio antenna and type: \"Hello...\" Cartoon: Terry Rogers. Illustration: Dorian Cross "

"W Fig. 1 wa 1 i 2 LA a b c d e f g h Fig. 2 : 1 10 70 i 191    My 4 Computers are well known to be weak at positional play, the intricate manoeuvring for a small advantage, such as a well-placed Knight. However, they also have problems with tactical play, even with what seems like the simple task of finding forced checkmates in positions where they are known to exist. Look at figure one. This is an example of a \"White to play and mate in two moves\" problem of the kind often found in newspapers and magazines. The first point to note here is that the specification for White to mate in two moves has no practical value. Chess problems are not game positions but artistic compositions on the 64 squares of the chessboard. Solving a chess problem is not a matter of examining every possible sequence, but of identifying the composers' theme in setting the problem. The use of a computerised \"mate in two\" program using exhaustive analysis sadly undercuts the aesthetic experience of problem solution. Simply by considering every possible legal combination of two moves for White and one for Black, the program inevitably reveals the winning move. (The reader is left to discover the solution for figure 1 using either a computer or a human brain, as preferred.) In finding checkmating sequences in positions that arise in practical play, very different methods need to be applied. The longest variation in a checkmating sequence arising from play can easily be 7 or 8 moves (of each side) deep, so analysing every possible combination as a general solving method if completely out of the question. On the positive side, the moves in a checkmating sequence from play are usually fairly obvious ones of a forcing nature, such as checks and captures (or sacrifices of material) whereas those in composed problems are frequently \"quiet\" or unlikely moves, such as a Bishop move one square further away from the scene of battle, which are difficult to perceive even for strong over-the-board players. The MATER program of George Baylor and Herbert Simon which appeared in the mid-sixties was an early pioneering attempt aimed at finding forced checkmates in game positions, given that they are known to exist, of necessity employing \"Artificial Intelligence\" rather than \"brute-force\" means. Figure 2 is a fairly straight-forward example of the positions solved by the first version of the program, MATER 1. a b c d e f g h The major difficulties with any such program are deciding what moves to consider and in what order, and at any point in the analysis deciding what to examine next. Deciding when to stop analysing a line is probably the hardest task of all. A badly written program might spend many hours, days, even longer, looking at variations beginning 1. P-QR3, Q-R7; 2. K-Q2, Q-R8; 3. P-R4, etc., which humans would discount at a glance. MATER's choice of moves to examine is simple but works quite well. At any move for White (assumed to be the winning side), only checks are considered and at every White move preference is given to the check which leaves Black the fewest legal moves in reply. As will be seen below, this may involve abandoning the current line of analysis and starting another. Any White moves which give Black more than four legal replies are automatically discarded. Any remaining choice amonst White moves is resolved by giving priority to double checks, then to checks with no capturing replies. When it is Black's turn to move, all legal moves must be considered, but there is a considerable advantage in looking first at those moves which are the most likely to refute White's attack. For this reason, MATER looks first at Black moves which capture as valuable a White piece as possible. If there is still a choice, King moves get priority. This is how MATER solves the position in figure 2. 1. Generate all White checking moves. 1. Q-B6ch has two legal replies. 1. N-K6ch has 3 and 1. B-B7ch and 1. B-K7ch each have one. 2. Choose. 1. B-K7ch (arbitrarily) from the last two for analysis, on the basis of minimising Black's replies. 3. Generate Black's forced reply 1. ...NxB. 4. Generate all White's checking moves. 2. N-K6ch is the only one and Black has three legal replies. 5. Choose a White move to examine next from those not yet considered. Candidates are 1. Q-B6ch (two replies), 1. N-K6ch (three replies). 1. B-B7ch (one reply) and 2. N-K6ch (three replies). The 'best' one is 1. B-B7ch so the previously played moves (1. B-K7ch, NxB) are retracted and 1. B-B7ch is played instead from the original position. 6. Black's move is again forced, 1... NxB. 7. Generate White's checking moves. 2. N-K6ch (four legal replies) and 2. QB6ch (two replies). 8. Choose a move to consider next, from 1. Q-B6ch (two replies), 1. N-K6ch (three replies), 2. N-K6ch (four replies) and 2. Q-B6ch (two replies). Since 1. Q-B6ch was generated first, it is chosen in preference to 2. Q-B6ch (both with two legal replies). So 1. Q-B6ch is now played in the original position. 9. Black now has a choice of two replies 1. ... NxQ and 1. N-K2. The capture 1.. . NxQ is tried first. 10. Generate White's legal moves, these include 2. B-K7 mate, which has no legal replies at all and is accordingly chosen to look at next. 11. Since 1.... NxQ was unsuccessful, Black's only other legal reply to 1. QB6ch is tried, namely 1.... N-K2. 12. Generates White's legal moves; these include 2. BxNch which has no legal replies and is chosen to consider next. Since it has now been found that neither 1. ... NxQ or 1.... N-K2 avoids checkmate, White's winning first move is established to be 1. Q-B6ch. Although figure 2 is quite a simple position and one that, in isolation, could have been solved by an exhaustive \"mate in two\" program, the same method embellished to consider other forcing moves as well as checks for White can solve many other problems for which an exhaustive search method would be completely inadequate in any reasonable amount of time.

"600 CO2  On DOO  BY R. M. STEVENSON OOO  00 POO 000. RUNS ON A BBC MODEL B IN 32K PS . 2 ncc O \"Fore! Ah, hello old chap. Out for a spot of golf then eh? Wonderful sport, what! Lots of fresh air and exercise. But sometimes you will find yourself stuck in the office for an afternoon. Or the weather will be so absolutely foul you won't be able to even lift a club for days! That's where these computer chappies come in useful. They've got golf off to a tee on the old micro. Jolly good when you can't get down to the links ... oh, excuse me, jolly old ball seems to have got lodged in the branches of that pine tree. Bye for now!\" This program includes all the elements of the real game. Bunkers, greens, and even the dreaded \"rough\". You can tell the computer how many holes you wish to play and it sets up the course for you. It will ask you which direction you wish to make your shot to the green, and how hard you wish to hit the ball. The direction is calculated from 0 to 12 as in the hands of a clock, and strength by inputting a value from 0-100 which will represent the distance the ball travels in yards. If you get into the trees you incur a penalty shot. If you get stuck in the rough you will have to hit your ball four times as hard as normal. If you land in a bunker you'll need to adjust your hitting power up to five times more than normal. Good luck, good hitting, and we'll see you back at the clubhouse! The following alterations are required to run the program on a model A machine. Change line 10 and 110 to read MODE 4. Change line 115 to read COLOUR 1. In lines 120, 121 and 123 remove all the COLOUR statements and the colons immediately following them. Change line 270 to read COLOUR 1. In line 1020 remove the COLOUR O statement and the colon immediately following it. Change the MODE I and COLOUR 2 statements in line 1340 to read MODE 4 and COLOUR 1 respectively. 200 000 2. 000 Por, "

"BY STEPHEN SHAW POMPEII RUNS ON A T.I. 99/4 OR 99/4A IN 16K IN EXTENDED BASIC In the ashes of Pompeii, the ancient Roman city devastated by a volcano. some gaming counters, in the shape of trussed up chickens, were found. There appear to have been 15 counters in a set with Roman numerals I to XV on one side and the other blank. Historians think that they may have been used with a box with 12 compartments. Stephen Shaw has delved back into history for this latest brain-teasing program -based on an adaptation of the ancient Roman game produced by Whittlecraft of Worcester. Rules of the game are included as DATA statements in the program and, says Stephen, should be sufficient for play. Program notes: 430: Checks to see if counter can be used 120: Reruns program in case of serious errors-eg, syntax errors. You 490: If only one counter is to be used checks to see if compartment are advised to insert this line ONLY when the program has can be used proved to be running OK. Otherwise you miss the error 500: Tells computer the compartment has been used and deletes the messages! compartment number from the screen. Arrays RR(n) and ce(n) 140: Warning messages are not displayed the program will contain the screen locations of the compartment number n. continue. BREAK is not totally disabled but can only be used 620-630: Reset counters ONE & TWO as appropriate if they cannot when the machine is waiting for an input. be used. 180: Defines characters 100-102 as the horizontal and vertical lines of 660: Have all faceup counters been used if so TOT-0). the grid and the connecting points (102). 680: Rethrow any counters which have not yet landed number up in 210: VALIDATE will only permit you to enter a Y or N.

"TANKER BY MIKE LEVER A life on the ocean wave can be dangerous. There's always someone lurking around ready to blast your tanker right out of the water! The object of this game is to knock out as many enemy tankers as possible using your anti-tanker gun making sure that the vital supplies your warring opponent needs just don't get through. To give those tanker captains that sinking feeling use keys \"Z\" to move left, «X» for right and \"M\" to fire. EF  EEP .02.0: PRINT AT 8. b . PER 6 S on uses EXT DA PRINT AT DEEP 01.

"\"Computerised scrumping! Whatever will they think of next? In my day we had to get out among the apple trees for a bit of fruity fun. And there was always the gamekeeper to keep an eye out for. If he caught you you'd know all about it! All these computerised chappies have to worry about is dropping apples!\" The game is set outside the tall ivy clad wall of an orchard. You are waiting at the bottom of the wall holding a basket on your head. Your computer \"accomplice\" will throw apples over the wall at random positions. All you have to do is catch as many as you can. When you have caught 15 apples the game stops momentarily and the computer tells you it has found something to help you. A trestle is drawn on the screen and you hop up onto it. The game continues but you have less time to catch the falling apples. The trestle drawing routine is continued each time you collect 15 apples in your basket, moving you progressively further up the screen, giving you less and less time to catch the falling fruit. fruit. Once you have missed 10 apples the game stops and the computer tells you your score-a chance to have another crack at those apples! Variables: Yl: vertical position of basket. Y: vertical position of man. XI: horizontal position of basket and man. APP: number of apples caught. MISS: number of apples missed. Q: limit of fall of apples in FOR/NEXT loop. Z: determines level change (increase by 15 each level). X: random horizontal position of falling apples. L: control flag (equals 1 or 10). The '' character is a clear screen command (ESC. CTRL. CLEAR) and it appears in lines 10, 100, 2155. Type line 2155 exactly as it is for correct screen format. Lines 3050, 3070, 5100, 5130,5140, 5160, 5340 should have the words between quotation marks typed in INVERSE video. Also lines 5010-5070 should have the *'s typed in alternate INVERSE video.

"FRUIT MACHINE or a pocketful of fresh air. There's a one-armed monster which lurks in dark corners so for all of you and it won't cost you a penny! and is always ready to take your money. In return it could grant you vast riches Yes, this is a game for all of you who like feeding those three-reeled bandits As this is a very long program for the unexpanded Vic-20 the instructions included are very brief with extra memory the first job is to type in some extra instructions. When the insert coin sign shows press \"l\" then \"f1\" to run. \"f7\" shows your profit and losses. Now and again your Vic will present you with the chance to \"gamble or collect\" which could double or treble your winnings. Any one or two reels can be \"HELD\" by pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard -\"1, 2 or 3\". In lines 800-865 certain graphic characters appear. These are merely shifted letters which will appear as upper case letters when the program is run. Line 845 graphics are for the word \"UP\", line 847 for \"DOWN\" and line 849 for \"BROKE EVEN\". The two strange characters in lines 800 and 875 are a reversed \"N\" and a reversed \"/\". These are used to change the computer from upper to lower case and vice versa; they can be obtained by the following method. Type the program line as shown but leave a space where this character is to appear and press return. Using the cursor control keys, position the cursor in the space you have left, press CTRL and RVS ON at the same time. Now press the key needed to produce the symbol. In line 800 the key is \"N\". In line 875 it is \"SHIFTED N\". Now press return and continue with the program. The symbol in line 104 is achieved by pressing the \"f7\" key (in quotes). Line 170 is \"f1\" in quotes, the listing was done on a Pet printer which does not have the \"t\" sign, so when you come to a \"/\" (in quotes) just press the \"t\" key. tration: Dorian Cross OOO . 0.00 "

"RUNS ON A DRAGON IN 32K #MISSILE BY A. CHAPMAN THE cities of planet Tanith are peaceful places with some of the most beautiful buildings in any city of the Sol system. But that peace will soon be shattered and the graceful sky towers will soon be burning unless you can halt the deadly rain of missiles heading toward the planet from the depths of space where a hostile power is lurking ... This game for the new Dragon is an adaptation of the video favourite. It's got all the features of the arcade game and should test even the best Missile Commanders. Line the oncoming missiles up in the sights of your anti-missile laser and blast away. Don't let any get through to destroy your planet's cities. Use keys 1, 2 and 3 to fire and keys U-up, H-left, J-right, N-down to move your laser-sight. 10 REMX****MISSILE COMMAND****** O REM***********BY************* 301 REM********R.

"KRAZY KONG BY TIMOTHY BOONE RUNS ON A PET IN 8K Kong. Now there's a name to conjour with. And that's just what we've done. At least one of our readers has, and has come up with a version of the famous arcade game. Tim says his game is a very close copy of the arcade game's fourth screen-the most difficult and popular. If you have not played the arcade version before then you'll need an introduction to our gorilla friend. The basic idea is that Kong has captured the beautiful heroine and taken her to the top of the Empire State Building. Then Jump-Man-So called because of his amazing jumping prowess comes to the rescue. Jump-Man has to rush to the top of the building and save the girl from the gruesome gorilla. This game takes part in the attic section of the building. Jump-Man has to knock out or jumping over them. the roof supports and send kong crashing to his doom. There are eight supports and Jump-Man can knock them out by walking But there is a catch. These supports are each guarded by four moving fireballs which also burn away the top and bottom rungs of Jump-Man's ladders. If you knock out all the plugs you'll get a bonus. You start out with three lives and can lose these in many ways --as you'll find out. If you manage to conquer Kong the program loops and you get another chance to challenge him. Tim says his game is a very close copy of the arcade game's fourth screen-the J = position of Jump-Man; SC = Score including the bonuses (D). LE = level, increased by one every time kong is beaten. C = number of plugs gone. If C = 8then Pet goes into the fall routine. MI 8 = sound variables; B1-4 = positioning of fireballs. B6-8 = the random element of the fireballs; A = peek (151) (to increase speed). Program structure (shown by REMS) 98-250 = fireballs; 300-490 = various screen checking routines; 491-500 = sound. 500-690 = jumping xoutines. better? "

"MACHINE CODE ARITHMETIC AND THE EIGHT-BIT Eight-bit microprocessors have a very limited range of arithmetic instructions, providing only addition and subtraction and, in the 6809, an eight-bit by eight-bit multiplication. Unless you are writing mathematical programs you will rarely need more than simple addition and subtraction. Before we look at the assembly language instructions for addition and subtraction we need to look at the way arithmetic is performed on binary numbers. An addition with decimal numbers, say 26 + 47, is carried out digit by digit: 6 + 7 = 13, which is 3 and carry 1; 1 (the carry) + 2 + 4 = 7, so the answer is 73. We do binary addition in the same way, so the sum 26 + 47 in binary is 00011010 + 00101111, and we calculate the answer as follows: FLYING THE FLAG WITH THE 6502 Bit 0: 0+1=1 Bit 1: 1+1=0, carry 1 Bit 2: 1(carry) +0+1=0, carry 1 Bit 3: 1(carry) +1+1=1, carry 1 Bit 4: 1(carry) +1+0=0, carry 1 Bit 5: (carry) +0+1=0, carry 1 Bit 6: Icarry) +0+0=1 Bit 7: 0+0=0 in the first of the two memory locations). To get the 16-bit answer we first add the low eight-bits of the two numbers and then add the high eight-bits and the carry from the low eight-bits: LDA $1000; Low byte of Ist number into accumulator CLC; Make carry flag O ADC $1002; Add low byte of 2nd number STA $1004; Store low byte of answer LDA $1001; High byte of 2nd number into accumulator ADC $1003; Add carry and high byte of 2nd number STA $1005; Store high byte of answer. HELPING THE 6809 ADD THINGS UP The bits are numbered in the usual fashion, with bit 0 being the rightmost (least significant) bit and bit 7 being the leftmost bit). Thus we find the answer is 01001001, which is, of course, equal to 73 decimal. An eight-bit binary number can represent a decimal number from 0 to 255, but the sum of two numbers, each less than 255, may be more than 255. If we take an example, say 190 + 77, or 10111110 + 01001101 in binary, and work through the addition we find that the eight-bit answer is 00001011. However, in this case we have a carry of 1 from bit 7, and we really need nine-bits for the correct answer 100001011, equal to 267 decimal. If this addition is performed on an eight-bit microprocessor only eight-bits can be retained in the answer but the ninth bit will be stored in the Carry Flag in the Flags register, so after the addition 00011010 + 00101111 the carry flag would be 0, while after the addition 10111110 + 01001101 the carry flag would be l. The carry flag can be used in further processing. We can now look at the assembly language instructions for performing addition. BY TED BALL The opcode mnemonic for the addition instruction on the 6502 is ADC (ADd with Carry), which adds an eight-bit operand, the contents of the accumulator, and the carry flag, leaving the eightbit result in the accumulator and the carry in the carry flag. The carry flag is always included in an addition, and we have two instructions to alter the carry flag; CLC (Clear Carry) makes the carry flag 0 and SEC (SEt Carry) makes the carry flag l. To perform the eight-bit addition from the first example above we could write: LDA #26; Get first number into accumulator CLC; Make carry flag zero ADC #47; Add second number to A, leaving result in A We can use other addressing modes with the ADC instruction, including absolute addressing which we looked at last month, and other addressing modes we have not covered yet. The registers in the 6502 hold eightbits only and to add numbers larger than 255 (more than eight-bits), we have to break the addition down into eight-bit sections. For an example of a 16-bit addition, using absolute addressing, suppose we have two 16 bit numbers, the first in memory locations, 1000 & 1001 hex, the second in memory locations 1002 & 1003 hex, and we want the answer in memory locations 1004 & 1005 hex (the numbers would be stored with the low eight-bits For eight-bit addition we have the opcode mnemonics ADDA and ADCA which use accumulator A, and ADDB and ADCB which use accumulator B. ADDA and ADDB add the eight-bit number specified in the operand to the appropriate accumulator, leaving the answer in that accumulator. ADCA and ADCB add the operand, accumulator and carry flag, leaving the result in the accumulator. All these instructions leave the carry from the addition in the carry flag. To perform the addition in the first example above we can write: LDA #26; Get first number into accumulator ADDA #47; Add second number, leaving answer in A. As in the 6502 we can use other addressing modes with these addition instructions. 78 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"IMACHINE CODE We also have the opcode mnemonic ADDD for 16 bit addition, this operates on the accumulator D which you will remember from last month is really another name for the two eight-bit accumulators A and B together. Thus, to add two 16-bit numbers, the first stored in memory locations 1000 and 1001 hex, the second stored in memory locations 1002 and 1003 hex, with the answer being stored in memory locations 1004 and 1005 hex (the numbers being stored with the high byte first), we would write: LDD $1000; Get first number into D ADDD $1002; Add 2nd number, leaving answer in D STD $1004: Store answer in memory. There is no add with carry instruction for accumulator D. Addition of numbers with more than 16-bits can be performed by breaking down the numbers into eight or 16-bit sections and adding a section at a time, using an ADD instruction for the low eight or 16-bits and an ADC instruction for subsequent eight-bit sections. To add two 16-bit numbers, the first stored in memory locations 1000 hex and 1001 hex, and the second stored in memory locations 1002 hex and 1003 hex, with the answer going into memory locations 1004 and 1005 hex (the numbers being stored with the low byte first), we can write: LD HL,(1000H); First number into HL LD BC.(1002H); Second number into BC ADD HL,BC; Add BC to HL leaving answer in HL LD (1004H),HL; Store answer in memory. To add numbers of more than 16 bits we must break up the addition into eight or 16-bit sections and perform the addition one section at a time, using an ADD instruction for the low eight or 16-bits and an ADC instruction for subsequent eight or 16-bit sections. PAY YOUR MICRO A COMPLEMENT ADDRESSING YOUR Z80 CORRECTLY For eight-bit additions we have the opcode mnemonics ADD and ADC, each of which can be used in three addressing modes. The ADD instructions add the operand to the accumulator A, leaving the result in A, and the ADC instructions add the carry flag and the operand to the accumulator, leaving the result in the accumulator. The instructions are ADD A, data; ADC A, data; ADD A, reg; ADC A, reg; ADD A, (HL); ADC A, (HL). In the first pair the operand is included in the instruction; in the second pair the operand is the contents of one of the registers A,B,C,D,E,H,L; and in the third pair the operand is the contents of the memory location whose address is in the register pair HL. The addition from our first example above can be performed in several ways: LD A,26; Get first number into accumulator ADD A,47; Add second number, leaving answer in A or LD A,26; Get first number into A LD B,47; Get second number into B ADD A,B; Add B to A leaving answer in A etc. We also have the 16-bit addition instructions ADD HL,BC; ADC HL,BC; ADD HL,DE; ADC HL,DE; ADD HL,HL; ADC HL,HL, which add, or add with carry, a register pair to the register pair HL, leaving the answer in HL. So far we have regarded all binary numbers as being positive, eight-bit numbers representing a decimal number from 0 to 255 and 16-bit numbers representing a decimal number from 0 to 65535. There are several ways of representing negative numbers in binary, but the commonest, and the most useful with microprocessors is twos complement notation. To get the twos complement of a binary number we change the Os to ls and the ls to Os and add 1 to the result. For example, to find the twos complement of 10110111 we first change Os to Is and is to Os, giving 01001000, then add 1, giving 01001001. If we add an eight-bit number to its twos complement we always find that the answer is 00000000, with a carry of 1, so the twos complement can be regarded as the negative of the number. Thus we have: -l=twos complement of 00000001= 11111111 -2=twos complement of 00000010= 11111110 The easiest way of performing a binary subtraction by hand is to add the twos complement, so, for example 1-2 becomes 1 + (-2), or 00000001 + 11111110 which gives an eight-bit answer of 11111111. This is the number we get when we work out the twos complement form of -1. In twos complement notation an eight-bit binary number represents a number between -128 decimal (10000000 binary) and +127 decimal (01111111 binary). Note that in the twos complement notation the high order bit of a negative number is 1 and the high order of a positive number is 0. The subtraction instructions in the eight-bit microprocessors treat binary numbers as having the twos complement form, so, for example 10 -5 would give the binary result 00000101 and 5 -10 would give the binary result 11111011. In the addition of binary numbers we that when the binary numbers were regarded as representing positive numbers in the range 0 to 255 the result of an addition could be more than 255, in which case the answer was a number less than 255 but the carry flag was set to 1 by the addition. We have a similar situation with addition and subtraction of twos complement binary numbers. If the result of the decimal calculation with numbers in the range 128 to +127 comes outside that range the eight-bit answer produced by the processor must of course be treated as a number between 128 and +127, but the Overflow Flag (called V in the 6502 and 6809, and O or P/O in the 280) is set to 1. The assembly language instructions for subtraction are similar to the addition instructions, with SUB instead of ADD and SBC instead of ADC, but there are differences between the three processors in the way the carry is handled in the SBC instructions. The 6809 and 280 have eight and 16-bit SUB and SBC instructions which can be used in exactly the same way as the ADD and ADC instructions. The 6502, however, has only SBC instructions, and we need to look at this separately. The SBC instruction performs the calculation Accumulator operand complement of carry so if the carry is 0 we get accumulator operand -1, and if the carry is 1 we get accumulator operand -0. Thus, to perform a straightforward eight-bit subtraction we must set the carry flag to l before performing the subtraction. To subtract 5 from 10 we need to write: LDA 10; Get Ist number into accumulator SEC; Set carry to 1 SBC 5; Get answer in accumulator. We can perform 16-bit (or more) subtraction in a similar way to addition. With subtraction instead of addition our previous example becomes: LDA $1000; Low byte of Ist number into accumulator SEC; Make carry flag 1 SBC $1002: Subtract low byte of 2nd number STA $1004; Store low byte of answer LDA $1001; High byte of Ist number into accumulator SBC $1003; Subtract high byte of 2nd number and carry STA $1005; Store high byte of answer.

"BETWEEN THE LINES. The effect of hidden line removal is shown in the two accompanying illustrations of rockets. One has hidden lines removed and one does not. I hope you will agree that the drawing of the rocket with the hidden lines removed (Fig 2) appears much more solid and realistic than the other. The methods used for removing hidden lines are quite complex and highly mathematical, but for certain special cases they can be made comparatively simple. A technique that helps in producing realistic images of solid objects is the removal of hidden lines from drawings of the object. When describing a solid object, all the lines that are needed to represent its edges must be given because it may be necessary to view it from any angle. A view of it from a specific viewpoint can be generated by using the perspective transformation. However, if the transformation is applied indiscriminately to all the lines of the object, what will be seen is a wire-frame representation of the object with the lines that ought to be obscured from view because they are at the back of the object displayed just as prominently as those at the front which actually are visible. Although the wire-frame type of image does give a good idea of the shape of the object, it does not always convey the impression of solidarity that one might want to achieve. Besides this, it sometimes gives images that are ambiguous in the sense that they make visual sense in more than one way. These problems can all be overcome if the lines that would be hidden from the viewer are removed. Fig 2. The first point to make is that what conceals the part of an object that is hidden from view is a surface in front of it. The surface itself is surrounded by edges, all of which will be lines. So the way to find out which are hidden from view is to determine which surfaces are masked from the observer by others, and then not to draw the lines representing the edges of hidden surfaces. For this reason, a solid object needs to be described not simply in terms of the lines that give its edges, but also in terms of its surface facets. The lines outlining each surface facet must however be given. To give an example, when dealing with a cube all its six surfaces would need to be given (those at the front, back, left, right, top and bottom). Each would be described by the four lines that surround the square surface facets. One fairly simple way to remove the hidden lines is to draw each surface as a filled-in area starting from the back (that is, with the surfaces furthest from the observer), and working forwards. In this way plotting the nearer surfaces will automatically cause them to overlay the ones that are further away, thus removing the parts that ought to be obscured. A second method starts by plotting the points on the object nearest to the observer. It proceeds by examining the points that are further away, but along each line of sight from the observer to the object a region of visibility is maintained by continually updating the upper and lower horizons between which visibility is blocked by the parts already drawn. Naturally the points that are found to be masked from view are not drawn, thereby removing the hidden parts. Only lines outside the marked region are drawn. The only place that I have seen a comparitively simple program based on the last method and written in Basic is in Practical programs for the BBC Computer and Acorn Atom by David Johnson-Davies (Sigma Technical Press, 1982). This gives a program for drawing surfaces with hidden line removal. For purposes of comparison, a program for drawing the surface without removing the hidden parts is also given there.

"REVERSI OPENINGS: PAIR EXCELLENCE Chess has a vast store of opening theory which takes white and black into even middle game positions, built on centuries of study and documentation. Reversi is also building up a wealth of opening theory which consist of a known sequence of moves at the start of a game and continue until one side has a large choice of good replies to choose from. These openings usually involve filling in some, or all of the 16 squares which make up the centre of the Reversi board. By knowing a bit about openings, you instantly increase your chance of winning, and ensure that no-one will brow-beat you into submission early on in the game. Unlike chess openings, Othello is young enough for openings to change according to whims of great players. So in a computer program you cannot hope to keep abreast of top moves. Better to avoid the worst blunders, then add a strong \"random\" factor to the rest, so that at least sometimes it plays brilliantly! Black's first move is forced due to symmetry, so we will choose e3 as in the first diagram. White then has three choices which we have named as follows:the \"Pall\" family marked \"P\" at f5, the \"Jerbal\" at d3, and the Desert at f3. Top players avoid the Jerbal, though I favour it if White is willing to play outside the The champions of the Reversi (or Othello) board study their adopted game just as thoroughly as the chess and bridge masters. And this includes noting down classic games between rival champions and building up an opening theory. Unlike chess where the book of openings is backed up by several centuries of chess publishing, Othello strategy is still a fairly young science and opening theories are not as stable as those in chess. All of which makes teaching your computer to use the best openings in its first six to eight moves, very difficult. centre. So tell the computer to play Desert or Pall most of the time. Let's now see the general algorithms that help you avoid blunders. The first rule is one of my basic \"rules of thumb\" of taking as few pieces as possible, but count the four pieces in the centre as \"halt\" pieces. The second rule is to prefer to complete a \"Pair\". There are four \"Pairs\", each being the two adjacent squares to a centre corner, such as the centre sides at do and c5 marked \"S\". If one square of a Pair is occupied, then the other square is attractive. It often cuts through enemy pieces, which is good play in the middle-game too. The third rule is to mildly dislike a centre corner if its Pair is empty, to hate a centre corner if its Pair is half-occupied, and to love it if the Pair is occupied. Balance this with previous rule of thumb of course! Diagram 2 shows an elegant opening which illustrates the general algorithms well. White plays the Pall at f5, to which Black completes the Pair at e6. White avoids the half-empty Centre comer at f3, so has to play d3. Black completes the Pair at c4. White could then play at the f6 corner, but Black would reply at c3, so instead White plays do. Black has an equal choice of Pairs to complete, selecting f4 c5 being just as good). White takes the cheapest corner, as it is a bit early to play outside the centre. Black again has two equal moves, to complete a Pair at c5, or fill a corner at c3. Black choose c3. White Corner at f3, Black fills Pair at c5, and White completes the shape at c6, as per diagram 2. Black now has only four real choices, as four more are symmetrical, and one gives away a corner. This opening was played by John Parker in the 1981 British Championship to win the final game. Now look at diagram 3. White played the Desert, Black filled the Pair at f4, White had no choice by symmetry, then Black again filled a Pair at e6, White then played at d3 taking three pieces. Why? I don't know. But Maruoka, a world champion from Japan beat many national champions with it. Where would you reply? c4? e2? g4? g5? Confused? Good, because now you know about as much on Othello openings as anyone.

"lights just to see if it would work. Using all three outputs I could get quite a good random flash and flash length with a little logic and some mains relays. The 6840 is a Motorola i.c. designed for the 6800 system, but will work as well with the 6502 or, with a little help, on any eight-bit machine. It needs machine code to run it or an eight-bit output port in basic or an operator who can use machine code from Basic. Not everyone will use the same method so I will demonstrate how it works in machine code and then leave it up to you to put the finishing touches to the program. The same goes for the other peripheral boards which I will design for you. You might even like to submit your own versions of the program for scrutiny. The other i.c. I am interested in developing further is the priority interrupt controller, the 6828. It looks like one of those white MAKING MORE OF YOUR MICRO Is there life after Kit Korner? The answer from this end is a definite yes. It of course depends on whether or not you are interested in developing new ideas for your computer. Certainly the technical requirement will not be any more than for the other kits I have already covered. In fact that should be the least of your worries. You may naturally feel that it is not worth the work involved and decide to buy in a ready built version. In some cases, though, these will not exist, and as I have always said it is far better to build your own as you will learn much faster. Most of the first few designs I have lined up are based around a single i.c. The reason for this is that they are quite easy to adapt for various micros and are simple to put together. Later on as I develop new ideas I cannot say what might happen. We will just have to wait and see. As a result of this new expansion there will be far more circuit diagrams and layouts than there have been in the past. I have always believed that a circuit diagram paints at least a thousand words and is far more informative. Some of the peripheral boards will have some short routines to get you started but the major development will be up to you, as will the use to which you put the board. Many months ago I took a look at a programmable timer chip, the 6840. I had for a long time wanted to have a go with one just to see what I could manage to do with it. I was pleasantly surprised. Many of you may already have used interface i.c.s in machine code and fortunately this acts very much like one. It gives you the facility of defining outputs with a certain time lapse or for repeated outputs at set time intervals. I used the chip first to flash up question, why am I picking 6800 peripheral i.c. projects rather than the more common versions, say 6502 or 280. Certainly there are just as many i.c.s in their sets as any others. The main reason is that I have been working for some time on 6800 systems and hopefully know a little of how they work. Also, 6800 and 6502 peripherals are almost interchangeable. Although Z80s are very common these days for micros they are very flexible in their acceptance of other system i.c.s. This makes the use of 6800 peripherals almost ideal for the job. If you find any others which you think could prove interesting please do not hesitate to let me know. My articles often spring from other people's ideas. Another idea I have been working on has been the development of a dedicated microprocessor system which would be capable of fulfilling many purposes but would take very little to build If you imagine a basic machine and then write down its components you will only come out with a handful. Processor, ROM, RAM, I/O, display and logic circuits. What makes a micro so expensive? Well mostly it is the bits you don't use to the full. By dedicating a micro to a particular use you are not wasting anything. Unfortunately you will not be able to use it for very much else unless you change the ROM in it which luckily is not too difficult. As well as being relatively cheap the whole micro will go on to one small board a little larger than Eurocard size. Ever heard of miniaturisation? However much work is involved in the projects I will of course be showing you the best and hopefully the shortest cuts to getting your prototype to work well. I hope also that you will help by sending me your own hints and ideas so that I can pass them on to other readers. It all helps in the learning process, which is what we are here for. Keith Mott elephants which you don't often see but which you think you could use if you only knew how. I will be looking into some of the more interesting possibilities of interfacing to which this i.c. can be put. Interactive games controller for one. One of the problems with this particular i.c. is that it requires a little more software to drive it, so this may be a case for some more instruction than usual.

In Warpath the conflict is between the cavalry's General plus his troopers and the three types of Indians: those armed with tomahawks, the bowmen and the horsemen. The conflict must be carefully balanced to give both sides an equal chance of victory and this is achieved by different numbers of each piece with various movement and attack/defence advantages. In wargames like chess, there is no problem with preserving a balance in the game as both sides are made of the same pieces in the same position. This leads to chess experts being able to develop rigid opening formations which have been proved and used many times before. Warpath sets out two very different looking sides which will be in a new formation each time you come to play the game. Remember: if you have any difficulty following Warpath on your computer please write in and let us know. By the way, the machine language is written in 280 code. I would like to hear from anyone who successfully implements the program in 6809 or 6502 code. There are no ROM calls.

Any piece occupying the Flag hex will receive an extra movement factor provided that it is in that hex at the start of its move. A trooper who is adjacent to the General receives an additional attack/defence factor. Last month we developed the BIGSCREEN routines for WARPATH; now let's look at the creation of the pieces. The method is similar to the machine language routines but this time we build up graphic characters. Characters can be created using the CHR$ instruction. For example: a man H(1), could be defined as: H(1)=CHR$(158)+CHR$(148)+CHR$ (094) But this takes up 20 bytes of memory. (Count it. Remember that CHR$ only occupies one byte.) Lines 3100 to 3150 contains 98 items of DATA so if we use this method it would probably cost about 650 bytes. If we POKE the data into strings, however, it will require no more than the length of the strings defined in lines 950 to 1080 (excluding 1070), i.e. about 150 bytes — a saving of 500 bytes. It was only by adopting these methods that I was able to fit this game into 16K. Incidently, whilst on the subject of byte-grabbing, let us look at line 1070. This contains C4 which is a table of ODDS with 81 numbers none of which is -greater than 6. I could have defined an 92 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"integer table and put the numbers into that, but this would have required two bytes per number and, in addition, I would have needed more DATA lines and the necessary programming to set the table up. I estimate an extra 200 bytes would have been needed to do this, quite apart from the additional time delay. Accessing the string is done using MID$ and VAL. You should always look for these savings. Full marks if you have seen that I could have made the table smaller by putting 3 numbers in one byte (because 6 to the power of 3 is less than 255, the capacity of one byte). Now back to the pieces. There are several different types: 1 The men are represented by the variables H(1) to H(5). 2 Boulders are held in C3 and the Headquarters piece is held in C5. 3 A major part of the Fort is in GT. 4 D(2) to D(20) are the elimination routines and operate like a filmstrip. I find explosions very difficult to define authentically, so in these sequences I push the man into the ground! The TRS-80 graphics are very simple. The video has 16 rows of 64 blocks and each block contains 6 pixels numbered as fol12 bytes by using the DIM statement. Line 790 asks for a scenario number. All my games have their own random number generator which is seeded with this number. This enables players to replay the same map layout, either because they wish to reverse sides and play under the same conditions or because they discover a particularly interesting set up. The seed, WD, is calculated from the scenario number. When a random number is needed between, say, 1 and 6, R3 is set to 6 and the generator, line 260 is called. The variable, WN, returns the random number and WD is reseeded. Note that W is defined as Double Precision. Once the board has been set up, I use the Basic random number generator to determine the outcome of attacks. We now call the initialising routine at 1100. Lines 1100 to 1160 prepare the machine code routines by setting up the JUMP table (variable RU). Do you find this table confusing? Some of the routines call subroutines just like GOSUB in Basic. For example, the routine in X$(1) calls X$(2). Strings, however, tend to move around in memory during program development and therefore the address of X$(2) will change. TH Lead the cavalry charge or plan the Indian ambush. Part II of Ron Potkin's series which combines advanced programming tips with a listing which builds into a thrilling wargame.

Now add the Basic listing below. This contains a graphic loader. Make sure you type lines 950 to 1080 exactly as they appear. You should also type the change in Line 821.

This jargon term simply means that in terms of quality of graphics, playability, and game development the cartridge is the best that present technology has produced. The game puts you in the cockpit of an Atarian Federation star cruiser chasing the enemy Zylons through space. By pressing a button on the computer keyboard a map of the galaxy is displayed. This shows the position of enemy ships and star-bases in relation to your craft. There are three types of ships to be dealt with. Zylon Fighters are designed for high-speed attacks and can be deadly at close range. Zylon Cruisers have assigned patrol routes within certain sectors and will only attack if provoked. Basestars can only be destroyed at close range. Use extreme caution when attacking a Basestar. As well as enemy ships you will also have to avoid the masses of meteorites that are spinning through space. To aid you in your mission you have a number of sophisticated battle and flight control instruments. Computer Attack Control flashes up gun sights on the screen and enables you to lock on your photon torpedoes, but the Galactic Chart is your most useful aid in your pursuit of the Zylons. This shows you the entire galaxy divided into sectors containing either enemy starships, friendly starbases, or are completely uninhabited. The Hyperwarp enables you to travel at accelerated speed to different sectors and the long range scan shows you the positions of approaching enemy fighters. You can work your way up through the ranks of the star fleet while you play. Some of the ranks will amuse you. Once this has been achieved the real fun can begin as you work your way up through the ranks from rookie to Star Commander. The good thing about the game is that it is pretty tough to win this top rank rating. Star Raiders is available from most good Atari dealers at .95. Not cheap — but an excellent addition to your games library never the less. It runs on an Atari 400 and 800 with version also available for the VCS.

Once marooned on Sorcerers Island your only hope is to find the hidden escape route. Numerous hidden beasties will try to stop you and take your life during your quest for the lost exit. Some are easy to deal with but the dreaded Balrog will show no mercy, You start this adventure with 2,000 life points which decrease as you battle with various monsters to collect the treasures you find along the way. After each move you are a map of the island is available for your perusaland you can also check out the spaces immediately next to your present position. Unfortunately neither show the exit or the monsters. Sorcerers Island is one of two adventure games for the ZX81 from Psion. The other — which also requires 16K to run is Perilous Swamp. This is the easier of the two games. you have to rescue a princess from an evil wizard. There are more monsters and lots of action. I recommend you try Perilous Swamp first I've yet to solve Sorcerers Island. If you like adventure games then this cassette is well worth the price of .95.

BAJA BUGGIES THE ONLY THING THAT CAN GET YOU THE MOST OUT OF YOUR BBC MICRO IS 225erbis This is very much like the VCS game Night Driver. But Gamestar, the new American Atari software company who released this new game have made full use of the superb graphics of the Atari computers. The scene is set in the Californian desert. Sand-dunes lurk at the top of the screen with a golden sunset on the horizon. The object of the game is to win the race. But as you start last there are 80 buggies in front of you! Your speed accelerates automatically and when you press the fire button your brakes go on. You have to slow down or you will lose control. At the bottom of the screen there is a control panel. This shows your speed, your position in the race. There's a radar scan which shows how far you are from the finish line. The radar also shows where the leaders are. If your averege speed is better than the speed already on the scoreboard you get a chance to put your initials up. If you wish to join the Baja Buggies Club you must take a photo of your initials to the manufacturers. In return they will send you a key-ring and membership card. One of the annoying things with the game is that if you crash your buggy too often or go off the road too often your buggy will break-down and the game is over. Graphics wise buggies could be better. The sounds are also pretty poor in comparison with games like Preppie. This 16K game for the Atari 400/800 was good fun to play but overall it was rather disappointing. Baja Buggies is available from Gemini Electronics of Manchester at .95. Getting Started Value Playability UNBELIEVABLY INFORMATIVE AND USEFUL!!!

Lincs. PE21 OJX A stack of Pacman-type games have been cluttering up the C&VG reviews office over the last few weeks. A new maze gobbling game is added to the list of software available for the Spectrum at the rate of about one a week. We tested a batch of the more obvious straight copies of the arcade original. First on the screen was Spookyman from Abbex Software of London. This game got off to a bad start as it did not tell me which keys to move my little man around the maze. A prime consideration in this game! Although the maze looked fairly good the Pacman somehow failed to convince. It just didn't feel like controlling a little chap with a personality of his own. Having just borrowed an Atari 400 with a Pacman cartridge I was used to much better player involvement in the game. If you got caught by one of the ghosts the game paused for an annoyingly long period. There is also an absence of shrinking and gobbling sands and the characteristic gulp, gulp, gulp as you clock 200 then 400 and 800 in the arcade original. Next up was Mazeman from Abersoft of Dyfed. This was the fastest and most lavable of the pile but this too left a little too much to be desired. The game produced no sound effects, bonus fruits or flashing ghosts. All of the games would have been greatly improved by the use of a joystick. Playing Pacman without a joystick is rather like Blackpool without the illuminations. Based on Pacman but with a few twists SPECTRUM PACMEN of its own was Gulpman from Campbell Systems of Essex. This game offered thorough instructions with a comprehensive list of game options. You could choose one of fifteen mazes and vary the speed of your little man and the chasers. Another interesting variation on the basic Pacman theme was a laser-gun with a limited amount of energy with which you could shoot the chasers. On the minus side Gulpman has pretty basic graphics. The Gulpman for example moves around the maze without moving his legs. It would have been more convincing had the program simulated some sort of running motion. Artic Computing of Hull also produce a Pacman-type game called Gobbleman, which I believe is a fairly close copy of the arcade game. I cannot give you my comments on this game however as it steadfastly refused to load on my Spectrum. I was not over impressed with any of these versions. I don't know if it's the software or the machine but frankly Spectrum Pacman is not a patch on its Atari and BBC model B counterparts. But if you really want a Pacman for your Spectrum, Gulpman just pips Mazeman. You might be better advised going for some of the original maze chase games.
