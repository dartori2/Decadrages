Still, how many times have we experienced perfection and shied away from acknowledging it? I'll name five here, no doubt you can think of at least that number again: Super Mario Kart, Tetris, Doom, Tempest 2000, Street Fighter Alpha. Dangerous talk! Nobody will ever create the perfect game, but there have been many perfect achievements in the history of video games. Time will always dictate that improvements are made. We accept that one year's greatest game is likely to be superseded the next. Sometimes giants topple in the space of a month. We're used to it. Point is that until we start recognising the 100% realisation of a given ideal, I'm afraid we have a flawed evaluation system on our hands. You'll notice that Street Fighter Alpha doesn't receive what it deserves this month though it is an exact replica of its arcade parent, plus enhancements. This is because you had no prior warning. From now on though Computer and Video Games is going to wield the system it created with the authority it deserves. Possibly even rethink our process of trustworthy recommendation altogether.

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected the wired-up gaming news section VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 THE FIRST PICTURES! mhis month's news section pretty much speaks for itself: Virtua Fighter 3! Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation! And shock news of yet another Nintendo 64 delay! Can Square's recent switch from Nintendo to Sony be attributed to this? Or does the story run deeper? We give you our view. Finally can you believe it first hands-on experience of id's Quake!!! After months of rumours and speculation, Sega finally made an official announcement at the Japanese AOU arcade show last month, about their biggest title ever. And to coincide with this news, they've given the Japanese press a look at the game. The first definite fact is that VF3 uses the all-new Model 3 coin-op board. According to Yu Suzuki, the head of Sega R&D, this board is capable of generating one million polygons per second. That's three times as many as the Model 2 board. Running at 60 frames a second, this makes for around 16,500 polygons per frame! Amazing as this figure is though, it's seen only as an average performance for the board, not the maximum! On top of this, the board is able to generate texturing and gouraud shading with incredible ease. Most coin-op hardware (even the most powerful like Model 2) are slowed down by these operations, but Yu Suzuki confidently states that Model 3 is completely unaffected, allowing them to produce amazingly detailed full-colour texturing and super-realistic light-sourcing. To get a better idea of what VF3 is going to look like, you need only look at the detail of the Virtua Fighter CG portraits collections. These SGI-generated picture CDs (available only in Japan) depict each fighter in incredible detail. VF3 is said to be at least This Is Dural from as detailed as these, possibly more so. Virtua Fighter 3. SmoothIn fact, Japan's no.1 coin-op publicaedged and reflective! tion, Gamest, having seen the game moving, claim the characters \"look so real they make VF2 A A first look at one of VF3's new characters look like dolls.\" characters. Who So, what's new in the game? Well, as you probably know, there are is she though? two new characters a Japanese female and one described as a 'fatso', who's a wrestler. What their fighting styles are, is still shrouded is secrecy, as is the much-speculated-about plot. However, supposedly it involves the Virtua Cops arresting the fighters. Weird stuff. AND... ridiculously early as it is, Yu Suzuki also made a statement about the possibilities of a Saturn conversion. He said that the performance of the Saturn is improving daily, however games that are possible on home machines aren't made for coin-ops. However, he didn't rule out the likelihood of a Saturn version. Â«I'd go for recreating the essence of the game rather than just the appearance and the graphics.\" "


"NEWS NEWS CVG COOL SONY GETS SQUARE! In what must be the most chilling piece of news in recent history, ace Japanese developer Squaresoft has announced that it is changing its strategy of providing software only for Nintendo.\" Meaning that the company has designs on producing for the PC, but more significantly that the next Final Fantasy is being dedicated to Sony's 32bit PlayStation, not Nintendo 64! Moreover, Squaresoft is ceasing all commitments to the Super Famicom (Super NES) after its fifth 1996 release in May. A spokesperson for Squaresoft, game counsellor Conan E Chamberlain, is quoted as saying, \"the reason for Square's strategic change at this time can be attributed to differences of opinion with Nintendo with regard to future software development, distribution, etc.\" Specifically the delay of Nintendo 64 was mentioned as contributing to the decision. That and the fact that both Saturn and PlayStation already have a goodenough user base in Japan to support Square's products. Simply, \"the nature of the industry has changed\", he said. And added, \"with the rise of the new next-generation systems, we feel we can make more money by supplying software to them instead\". No statement has been issued by any heads of Nintendo just yet, but CVG is immeasurably shocked by this decision. Nobody has been closer to Nintendo than Squaresoft these past years, but silicon cartridge is apparently no use to the company, as you will discover in the Final Fantasy VII story. Though future Nintendo/ Squaresoft projects seem remote, we doubt Enix will be allowed to have the Bulky Drive all to themselves!

Remember how all the magazines have been showing you the awesome Final Fantasy VII on Nintendo 64. Well it isn't destined for Nintendo 64 any longer it's due for PlayStation this Christmas. In fact, judging by this story, you may have difficulty believing it was ever destined for Nintendo's machine at all! The problem isn't hardware, let there be no doubt that N64 is the ultimate piece of kit, it's one of storage. According to a Japanese spokesperson for Squaresoft, \"for the creator to satisfy users with a new type of entertainment, you need lots of ROM. We decided to do PlayStation because it uses CD-ROM.\" Considering FFVII is to be contained on two discs, totalling one gigabyte, 1000 megabytes of information, you begin to undertsand the company's reasoning. Plus the cost is announced as  800 (), whereas the 24-Meg Super Famicom FFVI originally sold for  400 (). This whole situation is one heck of a confidence vote for PlayStation in terms of all round capabilities. Just look at what's in store! real-time polygon world Everything you see is claimed to be generated in real-time. That's all the locations, the inhabitants, main characters everything. Meaning that every scene is generated as a 3D polygon model, which can be viewed from any angle. This is true for converstion, and exploration scenes, as much as it is for battle sequences. The latter are something else! Because all the characters are generated as polygon models, even the largest monsters can shrink to midget size if viewed from afar. Warring parties may be viewed from behind the heroes, from the side, or through the eyes of your enemy. Anything seems possible. On a more ocnventional note, FFVII looks to have retained the Time Gauge 'Active Battle' option from previous games where the faster characters are able to move before slower, stronger ones. arms check The inclusion of modern weapons such as the Gattling Gun belonging to new character Barret, means that party members on the back row may still cause untold damage to the enemy. Also, the new technology at work here means that weapons are seen to change on screen if replacements are selected. In the spritebased adventures a character's appearance always stays the same. Both pics demonstrate the powerful 3D engine that drives FFVII. It is like nothing you have ever seen before!

"NEWS CVG NEWS VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 NURSERY EDITION connected 2535 With VF3 finally emerging and development continuing on the Sonic beat 'em up (the latest addition to the line-up is Knuckles), AM2 have turned their attention to a bizarre hybrid of the two called Virtua Fighter Kids! Obviously the big heads and short arms of the Sonic fighters appealed to the programmers, because that's how this Virtua Fighter 2 spin-off looks too. All the characters from the game are featured, together with all the backdrops, however the style is considerably different. Currently only Jacky and Sarah have been revealed, together with their backdrops and the Bryant versus Chicago stage. As you can see from the pictures though, the graphics are more colourful and gamey than in VF2, and although they look less realistic, they're just as detailed. Particularly amusing are the childish portraits on the character select screen, and this light-hearted look is the main theme of the game. Pick your character and they pull a big cheesy grin. The number of rounds won is indicated by blossoming flowers. Also, the fighters are much more expressive, pulling pained faces when hit. Other new features are obviously derived from AM2's latest combat game Fighting Vipers. When hits connect, a spang mark appears, and certain moves cause a replay to cut in, even during the middle of a round. Similar to when you break armour off your opponents in Fighting Vipers. Whether VF Kids has more simplistic gameplay to match its looks, remains a mystery. Hopefully it'll prove just as indepth as VF2, perhaps with even more techniques. With any luck, we should be able to get hold of a test version and give you more info real soon. 1528 0687 14 PLAYER SELECT  et py!75070   the 1970#8288     Hak ANUS   JACKY BERARBER CONTROL THE SATURN SPACESHIP! 2,000,300,350,500 CUT DOTN ON THE THROTTLE.

Start up the Saturn without the CD in the machine, and go to the CD screen. Insert one of these games, press the play button and play the whole CD through from start to finish nonstop.

Especially those little grey ones that crashed in Roswell and were filmed being cut open. But what's the real story behind it all? Well, you won't find the answers in The Pandora Directive, the latest PC-CD adventure from Access Software, but you will find a gripping plot based around the whole Roswell Incident. The sequel to last year's successful Under A Killing Moon. The Pandora Directive again puts you in the shoes of hard-nosed private-eye, Tex Avery. as he tries to unearth the truth surrounding the UFO crash, whilst being hunted down by corrupt government agents who are desperate to keep some terrible information secret. The game features impressive fully-explorable 3D, environments, cut together with film scenes that unravel the twisting plot. As you'd expect from an, interactive movie the acting is particularly cheesy, but in an entertaining kind of way, and features Barry Corbin (the fat ex-astronaut from Northern Exposure). Tanya Roberts (fancy woman from View To A Kill and Beastmaster) and Kevin McCarthy (you've probably seen him in the Twilight Zone). It also features a re-enactment of the fuzzy home video Alien autopsy scene only     T T the alien is still alive and twitching in this version!

PSX TEKKEN 2MORE PICTURES! SNK SATURN BEAT 'EM UPS TO USE CARTRIDGES! More pictures, there you go. Well, what more do you want? After all, it is the hottest PlayStation game in ages. Maybe ever. So just look at it. Look! And next month, if things go according to plan, we should have a huge in-depth preview for you! Ain As SNK continue Saturn development of their hottest beat 'em ups King Of Fighters '95 and Fatal Fury 3 the latest news is that the games are going to come packaged with special memory cartridges! Supposedly, the games have such vast amounts of character animation and moves, that to get them running at the quality SNK want, both titles are going to have to run with a CD and memory-cart in tandem. A method they've called the Twin Advanced Rom System. It seems that Capcom considered this approach when doing X-Men, but decided the slight drop in animation frames was preferable to the added cost the cartridges would involve. Indeed, when we saw a pre-production version of Saturn Vampire Hunter at Virgin Interactive HQ, it required an extra memory cart to store the uncompressed animation. The final version however, runs with all the data on CD, with no visible problems at all. SNK's commitment to making their games arcade-perfect seems quite clear, and even though these cartridges are going to mean extra cost, there's no doubt these games are going to be something special. With King Of Fighters '95 released at the end of March, expect a more indepth look at the Twin Advanced Rom System next month. WD TIME PALSS STH BOG ! YURI SAKALAU Namco's magnificent efforts are sure to give VF2 a real fight! IMAGO Looks no bigger than a standard memory cart, but just look at what it enables the Saturn to produce!

"NEWS CVG NEWS PLAYSTATION MK3 connected SCONTAINS ALL-NEW AM3 WARM UP 3D \"ULTIMATEÂ» FEATURES! FIGHTING GAME PlayStation owners may have been a bit upset at the fact that Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 isn't coming out as either a stand-alone game or an upgrade, but incredibly, all of the new features are included in the regular release of MK3! To get the secret mode, follow these slightly tricky instructions direct from the U.S.A. SELECT KOMBAT ZONE WINS-02 AM2 may hold the 3D fighting game crown at Sega Research and Development, but they'd better not rest on their laurels, because sister division AM3 have now turned their attention to the subject. Fresh from completing their racing extravaganza, Manx TT Superbike, AM3 have revealed first pictures of their current project The Last Bronx. Again using the upgraded Model 2B arcade board, Bronx looks set to be another urban 3D fighting game, with two characters so far revealed, wielding weaponary. A female uniformed character uses two nightsticks, whereas a gang member male clutches a set of nunchukus. Something that may cause some trouble over here. Little else is known about this game at this early stage, but, as these pictures show, it all looks fairly promising KOMBAT ZONE SOUL CHRMEER 2. In the third round, perform a Mercy. 1. You must be playing a twoplayer game with both players as Smoke (use the cheat to access him) on the Soul Chamber background. 3. After the Mercy has been performed, keep playing and make both players perform the Teleport Punch (F, F, LK) at the same time so that they both appear in front of the mouth portal in the background. EVICE A Hey! this girl looks almost identical to Jane in Fighting Vipers. Have AM3 been cribbing AM2's ideas...? 4. The characters will hit each other and fly into the mouth, causing a big green flare. 5. The game will crash and reset itself. Go through to the title screen and when the cube appears, press Down to reveal the new \"?\". 6. Select this option to get to the new Ultimate Character Select screen. SUPER NES GAMES: BARGAIN OF THE YEAR! The more observant MK3 player will notice that the actual make-up of the screen isn't quite the same as in the arcade. This is most probably because the PlayStation version was finished by about August 1995 and the arcade version wasn't widely available until December, meaning that the PS version was possibly a testing ground. As yet, we haven't found how to access the three Ultimate Kombat Kode characters because we haven't actually found the hidden code screen, but there are four secret characters available right from the beginning: Rain top/left Noob Saibot top/right Classic Smoke bottom/right Pedro bottom/left The news of the Ultra 64 delay in Japan may be something of a disappointment to the eager import purchasers among you, but it's not all bad news on the Nintendo front. THE (Nintendo's distributor in the UK) has boosted interest in the Super NES with some incredible price drops on their top titles. The 'Big Deal' promotion sees a selection of game bundles and budget packs released, with some brilliant titles in the line-up. Super NES Killer Instinct can be picked up for only .99, whereas the awesome classic Super Metroid can now be bought for the meagre sum of .99, as can Kid Klown. Other titles such as Super Punch Out and Illusion of Time are retailing at .99. And Super Mario All Stars and Super Mario World can be picked up as a bundle pack for only .99! And these are the official prices for these games, so if you shop around you may be able to find even lower price deals. As for upcoming Super NES titles, you may be pleased to know that Squaresoft's awesome Super Mario RPG is set for release over here, possibly in July (it may be their last Nintendo title to hit these shores too). You may not be pleased to know, however, that it's going to be called Koopa Kapers. What bucket of slops thought that name up? PEDRO WINS Pedro is undoubtedly the most incredible of these characters, as he hasn't yet been confirmed as being the fourth hidden fighter in the arcade version, unlike the other three. He is obviously based on Stryker, only he wears disgusting clothes, no hat, has a moustache, and doesn't carry a gun or baton. We've so far found a few moves a jumping fire kick, a fireball and one fatality (which uses the same motion as Sub-Zero's Freeze Blow fatality). As an added humourous bonus, when Shao Kahn says \"Pedro Wins\" at the end of a round, he says it in a Mexican accent! 14 "

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected EXCITING VER-COM HEADING! SUMMERTIME SAYS NINTENDO One of the most incredible pieces of new hardware to come out of Hong Kong for a long time is the Ver-Com Divider, an add-on which enables single-player games to be played in two player mode, on two TVs! The unit is available for either Saturn or PlayStation and plugs into the link port on both machines. When booted up, an option screen appears where either split-screen or link modes can be selected. Split-screen lets you play games like Daytona USA or Ridge Racer in multi-player mode on one, TV, with both players having half the screen to themselves. The link option is far more exciting, however, as it enables link-style matches on previously oneplayer games by cleverly letting two copies of the game play together at the same time. We tested the Ver-Com with Ridge Racer, Sega Rally, Road Rash and Virtua, Fighter 2. Naturally, the driving games, worked brilliantly, with RR running exactly as the newer RRR does, but surprisingly VF2 played well too! It's not much different from playing on one TV, but if the **Fighter's Eyes\" cheat turns out to be real, you'll be able to play versus mode, from a first-person perspective! Though it sounds fantastic, UK importers, aren't stocking the Ver-Com as there, have been many reports of it blowing machines by taking code and power from both systems at once. Still, Japanese stores report that the Ver-Com 'has completely sold out, even though the dangers have been well-publicised. The programming of the Ver-Com is slightly dodgy, and the games do crash often, but hopefully these are bugs exclusive to version 1.0 and will be fixed, in newer releases. SIMO VEN:com We all have just that little bit longer to save for our Nintendo 64. Three months more to be exact, as Nintendo Co Ltd have delayed release of N64 until July in Japan, September in the US, and \"Late Fall\" for the UK. That's really all there is to know at the moment, but as you can imagine the rumours are already flying. Most popular among them is that the games specifically Mario aren't up to standard yet. The official line is that the company is strugglling against a chip shortage. We have every faith in Nintendo at CVG, but this doesn't look good for a pre-Christmas UK launch. Still, distributers THE Games are still expecting their stock on time. Fingers crossed, eh! LETS' TRY TOGETHER FUNKY TV GAME ACTION FOR 2 PLAYER?

Ver com Ver:com  Profesion nullam --PC-FXOAIA April sees the Matsushita Electrical Industry (MEI) take full responsibility for 3D0 and M2. So they're going to need quality developers on board. To this end a deal has been struck with Konami, whereby the coin-op giants are planning to develop their next generation of coin-ops using the 64-bit board. Naturally these games, almost certain to be all action titles, will form the initial line up of family' games for M2 in Japan, while MEI concentrate on their 'official' and PC line up. The serious stuff. Latest prices quoted for M2 software fall between  000 and  000 ( to ). Just to give you some idea of how MEI's confidence, the company is projecting a  million profit on software before 1997 is over. With Konami on board, they may well do just that.

"STOP PRESS!! STOP PRESS!! NEWS CVG NEWS connected WEVE PLAYED TQUAKET Saturday 24th February 1996 id software put first playable version of QUAKE the successor to DOOM on the internet. This Deathmatch test version is incredibly early, and is only being used for players to test the Deathmatch mode out, though it will run on just one machine, albeit with no monsters. Last month's small news piece on the game revealed some features that it is hoped will be in the final version, but there's more! For a start, the 3D game engine is the most impressive we've seen yet! Every item is fully three dimentional, and there are levels above one another, sloping floors, wavy underwater sections, massive castles as promised, but everything is also light sourced! The three levels available show off a few of the weapons, like the super shotgun, nail gun and rocket launcher; as well as showing off how incredibly well the game moves! On a Pentium P90 it runs as well as we can imagine banking as you go round corners, and bobbing gently as you run along. This is definitely one of the most amazing-looking games EVER, and already we can tell that it's going to be one of the best games yet seen! The test levels on the internet have got a big license agreement file with them, limiting their use, but as far as we can tell, it's okay to show you the game. And what a game it is! We haven't got much space left in the mag, so just take a look at these pictures and try not to wet your pants! By the way, the reason for there being a tortoise icon in the top left corner is that this is a test version and the message is to let us know that Ed's 486 is a bit too slow. The game's going to be optimised for a 486 before its release. Sorry about the pictures being dark. A The brown sludge below can be swum through, and there are hidden passageway to be discovered down there. The sky above moves around in 3D and your gun is light-sourced! The balcony above can be walked around, and the small hill on the floor could NEVER be done in Doom! The ceilings are some of the most impressive parts of the test levels, the rafters look incredible! Wow! 18 "


"ALIEN TRILOGY... Have you got the stomach for it? SPECIAL SOUVENIR ISSUE! Featuring the exclusive first review of Acclaim's eagerly awaited Alien Trilogy. PLUTION MARCH ISSUE ON SALE FEBRUARY 23RD "


"GREMLIN FEATURE This game received rave reviews when it was released on PlayStation. Which is just fine by us, because we were one of the magazines that gave Loaded a rave review (it scored 92% in CVG 168, factstrels) and quite deservedly so. The game is an awesome shoot 'em up, 'filled to the pancreas with rock-hard action' as I believe we described it. But, is the game going to have the same effect on Saturn owners' pancrei? f you've been into computers games for a long time, you must have heard of Gremlin. This Sheffieldbased software house has been around almost since the industry first began, and were the people that brought us... Zool. And some good games as well. In fact, Gremlin has been at the forefront of PlayStation development with the excellent shoot 'em up Loaded, and, arguably the best soccer game in existence, Actua Soccer. And currently they're converting these very titles to the Saturn. Over the next eight pages we take a look at how these conversions are shaping up, plus we look at their latest PlayStation Gremlin and PC titles. 986 93 105 A Urf, I think my pancreas is going to give! 1236 2236 A Shooting at everything. That just about sums up what Loaded is all about. SHALLOW BURIAL PLOT! If you're a Saturn owner, you've probably never shown the slightest interest in this game before. And now you want to know all about it, eh? Weeell, okay then. The plot behind Loaded is complete madness! Literally! A group of psychopathic inmates have broken free from their padded cells on the toughest prison planet in the galaxy, and have decided to trash the whole place, killing everyone in sight. And that just about sums it up. Taking control of one of these nutters (or two if you're schizophrenic or have a friend at hand), you just run around each of the maze-levels killing everything in sight. Oh, and looking for the exit. Yes, that's the point of the game. It's sort of like Gauntlet really, if Gauntlet allowed you to blow people into small bloody chunks with rocket launchers and flame-throwers. Heh. 980 Currently, Gremlin are still working on the first level. But once this is complete, it's a simple matter to put the rest of the game together. "


"GREMLIN FEATURE HARD-LOOKING! In theory, Loaded might only seem like a 16-bit game. After all, how complex can moving around a maze, shooting things, be? True enough, but what puts Loaded into the Power Hardware-Only Club are its impressive 3D graphics. And herein lies the first problem Gremlin faced converting the game to Saturn. All of Loaded's scenery graphics are made from polygons. First the levels are created as wireframe vector models, with filled textured graphics laid on top. Now, whilst there's no doubt the Saturn can handle highly impressive 3D graphics, the fact remains that its power is balanced between 2D and 3D, unlike the PlayStation which has dedicated 3D hardware. In fact, one of the Saturn's two custom graphics processors is designed specifically to handle multiple scaling and rotating 2D backdrops. Something Loaded has none of. Gremlin admit that had they been able to create the game specifically for Saturn, they would have approached it differently, but as a PS conversion it's been tricky. A That's a bit of light-sourcing going on there, guv'nor. 000 A Looks kinda bloody. 701 81 LIGHT BLOWS One PlayStation feature Loaded impressively showcased, was its lightsourcing. Wherever the players went, the area they were in was illuminated. And that's just the smallest part of it. Any explosions lit up the scenery to magnificent effect. Flamethrowers caused the walls to flare, rockets flashlit the surroundings, and staccato strobbing was the result of machine-gun bursts. Even the main characters' bodies lit up when they unleashed their weaponary. In the pre-production Saturn version we've seen, these effects have been faithfully reproduced, with only the body-lighting missing. But Gremlin promise us this will be in the final version. One trick the Saturn is having a tougher time with is the smoke. The sheer amount of ballistic weaponary in Loaded unleashes a fair deal of fumes. With the PlayStation's transparency effects this was easy to produce. For the Saturn however, a mesh-effect has been used to simulate the effect. It's possible the programmers will change this before the final version, but until then, the questin remains can't anyone do proper transparancy effects on the Saturn? It's obvious why the walls in Loaded have to be 3D, but why couldn't the floors be generated using the Saturn's rotational background chip? It's simple really, on ceratin levels they bend and morph in a 3D-tastic trampoline fashion!! SUMMARY Next month, CVG brings you the full review of Saturn Loaded, which, all things going to plan, should match the PS original's looks, speed and playability near perfectly. Plus, we hope to take a first of many looks at the awesome PlayStation sequel â Reloaded! "


"GREMLIN FEATURE CVG GREMLIN FEATURE Slipstream This game's got a planet surface, with cities! Speed: 398mph Plane racing. It should all be excellent fun! Speed D'OB\"59 A The urban courses are hemmed narrowly by buildings. No this is nothing to do with that obscure Mark Hamill movie. It's actually a year-old PC game that Gremlin are currently converting to Saturn. Don't ponder too hard about the name though, because it's going to be changed for the Saturn version. However, this is more than just an attempt to knock out an old game under a new alias, because Slipstream is undergoing quite a few other changes. When released last year, Slipstream 5000 did fairly well in the PC press. A futuristic racing game, it differed from certain other futuristic racers that followed because its vehicles were... planes! The ten tracks were set over breathtaking locations, from the Grand Canyon and Amazon Rain Forests to cityscapes such as London or Tokyo. And the graphics were suitably impressive. The game also featured ten unique slipstream pilots, each one with their own style of flying machine. And this is where the Saturn version is undergoing its overhaul. Gremlin are actually converting the game for Japanese software house, Naxat (responsible for the, erm, interesting Battle Monsters), and they think the characters aren't suited to their market, looking quite 'Roy Of The Rovers' as they do. No surprise since the originals were done by 2000AD veteran Kev Walker. So instead, Naxat have redesigned the pilots themselves, transforming them into superb Manga-style warriors piloting sleak Battle Of The Planet-esque craft. Gremlin are currently turning this artwork into in-game graphics. With the added injection of Japanese 'cool', it should be interesting to see how this game turns out. DBB-83 Anyone who was around when Elite was first released nearly ten years ago, should remember what an incredible step-up it was from the previous simplisitic computer games in existence. Its huge universe filled with planets to visit and trade with, ships to hunt or escape from, and missions to fulfil created an amazing vision of existing in outer space. Now Gremlin pay tribute to that classic with an equally absorbing PC game. As with Elite, Hardwar puts you in control of spaceship and how long you survive in this ship depends on what you do with it. You need to earn money to build up the craft, so there are jobs to do. Deliveries and salvage work produce small earnings, but the big cash comes from dirtier tasks bounty hunting or piracy for instance. Of course, for this you need big weapons and they cost money. Ah, the circle of life. The big difference between Elite and Hardwar is that the latter is only set on one world Titan. This smaller environment provides a far better opportunity to create a realistic futuristic vision complete with cities. These impressively huge areas can be destroyed (for money sometimes) and left to be rebuilt by the inhabitants. There's also daily cycles, with the sun rising and setting. Important when you consider that your ship is solarpowered. You can even save up, buy a hangar and save up a stock of ships and bounty. What makes the game trickier are other pilots, and being networkable, these other pilots could well be other human players. Hardwar certainly has all the elements to make it a great space simulation, but can it beat 'The Original Space Trading Game'? Expect more info closer to the as-yet unconfirmed release date.

"GREMLIN FEATURE Four wheel drive racing to the extreme. Can we expect a slew of off-road racers now. lar Cears and Cuts Fatal Racing, Gremlin's answer to Ridge Racer and Daytona, proved quite successful on PC, with only Screamer for a rival. But in truth, neither of these PC racers matched the console competition, and with Sega Rally providing added off-road handling, they looked even more basic. Were Gremlin depressed? Nope, they just turned their attention to an off-road racer of their own. This time on PlayStation and Saturn. Gremlin claim that the off-road movement and handling of the cars in Gear And Guts is at least 'on par with that of Sega Rally. A strong boast, but one that seems supported by the play mechanics. Each of the six vehicles has various handling capabilites (traction, acceleration, turning circle, weight, suspension etc) and the car used needs to be one that cope with the surface faced. A tricky choice when you consider the terrain ranges from muddy forest tracks and dry canyon beds, to frozen river surfaces and even lavafilled volcano beds. From what we've seen, the movement of the vehicles especially the separate movement of the wheels is mightily impressive. How it all handles though remains to be seen at this early point in its development. More soon. Realms of the Haunting Last month we took a look at Gremlin's upcoming 3D PC adventure, Normality. Well, before that game is even ready, Gremlin have another PC game in preparation using an advanced version of the same 3D engine. In fact, they even go so far as to claim Realms Of The Haunting has 'the most advanced 3D environment ever!' The game is a bit of a gothic horror, putting you in the role of Adam Randall, a man who visits a vicarage in a remote cornish town where strange deeds are afoot. Deeds that eventually lead you into... the outer realms. Or something. Anyway, just like Normality, Realms is mixture of real-time 3D environments which you can explore fully, and a multitude of FMV cut-scenes that enhance the plot. Set for a May release. there's not much to see on this game. But whether Realms Of The Haunting can justify its 'most advanced 3D environment' boast with id's Quake just around the corner, remains to be seen. THE GATHERING All very mysterious. Ooh. 23 "


"GREMLIN FEATURE Euro'96 TES:T FRIENDLY GAME Having trouble finding our Saturn Actua Soccer coverage? Well, you're looking at it, fool! You see, rather than just getting a straight conversion of the PlayStation and PC original, Saturn owners (and PC owners again) are getting an revamped edition sporting the official license of this year's BIGGEST footballing event Euro '96! TURKEY 40% CROATIA SHOTS SHOTS ON TARGET POSSESION 60% BOOKINGS SENDING OFFS GOALS 2 SCOTLAND Y FOLLAND DONE All-new Euro'96 intermission screens are being designed. The central animated graphics provide you with options. Only the PC version of Euro '96 is actually being coded by Gremlin themselves, with an in-house Sega team handling the Saturn conversion duties. Both versions however, will match the playability of the original Actua Soccer, taken as they are from the same game engine. Euro '96 is more than just Actua Soccer with added window dressing though. The official UEFA license has given the programmers a chance to add a number of new features to the game most notably with the PC version. In fact, Gremlin actually reckon Euro '96 is more of an Actua Soccer 2 than just a different version of the same game! mit ve PEMER MANAGER SO, WHAT'S NEW? Well, according to Gremlin, Euro '96 benefits from an extra four man-years of research and development over its predecessor. How they've managed to cram these years of research into the three months since we reviewed the PC version (CVG 170 readstrels) is beyond us, but this time-distortion process has been put to good use, streamlining the Actua Soccer engine. The original Actua Soccer was particularly impressive due to its motion-captured footballers, actually modelled on the movements of Andy Sinton, Chris Woods and Graham Hyde of Sheffield Wednesday. Actua's players moved amazingly realisticially, even jogging backwards. Impressive as this is, Euro '96 takes the animation quality further still, with nearly twice as many frames of motion capture creating smoother movement. Likewise, the pitch graphics have been improved, so you get proper goal nets (not translucent polygon boxes as before). A Don't worry about the roughness of the pictures (which are all from the Saturn version incidentally). The graphics are currently only 32 colour. They are set to be put up to 256 sooon! 0000 WHAT'S YOUR STYLE? It's a Euro '96-license right? So the most noticeable changes to the game are the inclusion of all the real championship features, obviously. The Championship Mode features the four main groups, each with faithful replicas of the 16 team countries. Dressing the players in the correct squad kit is only a minor part of the improvement though. Enhanced artificial intelligence means the in-game players perform just like their reallife counterparts, with each team adopting the style and tactics used by those actual countries. So you can expect the English to lose to the Dutch all the time. CONTROLS 2A "


"GREMLIN FEATURE yo Day GROUND ZERO BRITAIN! Perhaps the most exciting thing about Euro '96, is that its the first major international football event to be held in Britain since the World Cup of '66 (which is also the last time we won anything). This game captures this element by featuring all eight Euro '96 venues, 3D modelled exactly on the actual stadiums. In Championship Mode, the choice of venues will no doubt match the real-life order they're played in. For exhibition matches though, you free to choose from Villa Park, Anfield, Old Trafford, Elland Road, Hillsborough, City Ground, St Jame's Park and, of course, Wembly. You can even play a floodlit night-time match. A We kind of hope they change that pitch pattern. It looks like a tablecloth. NAG, NAG, NAG. Actua Soccer featured the vocal delights of BBCl's leading footy commentator, Barry Davis. Impressive it was too, with little repetition or badly sturng together sentences. Well, Barry's back for Euro '96 and this time he's brought an extra 8000 words with him. This puts the word count up to a staggering 30,000, making this potentially the largest, most impressive in-game commentary yet. 00.00 A The circle means you're up for a pass. Shame a shot's already been taken. PLAYING WITH WIRE The PC version of Euro '96 has one feature that sets it apart from the Saturn version. Up to 20 players can linkup for a single match, controlling the player of their choice. PC Actua Soccer had this feature, but Euro '96 goes one step further by being the first game to use British Telecom's new Wireplay network gaming system. Set for launch this summer, the Wireplay feature (automatically built into the game) means players from around the country can compete in one massive game or set up their own teams, leagues and championships! So, weekend footballers can just sit at home and grow fat. That's the future, readers. Fat! The European Championships kick off on the 8th June. Actua Soccer: Euro '96 Edition is set for release at the beginning of May. Expect the review soooon! 0000 BLATSER UT FUJI-IN 25 "


"PREVIEW CVG RESIDENT EVIL Terror in the neighbourhood, as Capcom prepare to possess your immortal soul with Resident Evil! Developed by: ........CAPCOM Released by......... VIRGIN Out ...........................JUNE RESIDENT EVIL 90% complete PC version planned No other version available PLAYSTATION eems Capcom have finally decided to halt their domination of the 2D fighting platform genre and head instead for the more subtle and gory action of the gothic horror adventure. To this end, they have created an amazing polygon-based title called Resident Evil, due to land in our laps within the next month! The excitement is building, especially as we recently played an excellent (though incomplete) version of the game, and came away somewhat stunned. Those of you owning the Sony wonder machine or a PC should start getting rather excited right now, because Resident Evil is appearing on both platforms! Those of you unfamiliar with this game should note that it plays a bit like Alone in the Dark, only with better atmosphere, superior graphical extravagance such as more life-like polygon characters and monsters and that all-important factor: GORE! Yep, the ketchup count is set to reach new levels of sickening excellence as you wander around a decaying mansion in search of missing friends, uncovering a terrible secret or two. Those of you who loved Alone in the Dark are going to need a change of pantaloons when viewing this beauty. Conversely, anyone not overly keen with previous 3D wanderthons are likely to change their minds instantly when checking out the utterly astounding features RE has in abundance. We're not giving away too much here. Basically Gill plays the piano... ...and discovers a secret passagem What iles beyond? We're not telling SIDE BY SIDE Once the adventuring begins in earnest, you find yourself in control of either Chris Redfield, or Gill Valentine. Chris has greater physical strength, while Gill can carry more items. However the main differences areas that the game plays differently depending on the character is, essentially meaning that there are two plots to mull over and investigate. Also present are two other non-playing characters; the suspicious and balding Barry, who saves Gill from a crushing death, and Rebecca a charming sort who befriends Chris with some admittedly wooden dialogue. Who else awaits these characters on their quest? Well, how about a few hundred frothing monstrosities all baying for your blood...!!! pel!  Rebecca Chambers offers medical assistance to Chris, but not to Gill. Unless you're playing as Gill, Barry Burton isn't around to clear this room. A Fallen buddies are found in many places. 26 "


"PREVIEW SPECIAL FX AND THE PSX With this lush action taking place, you may expect graphical sacrifices. Not in the slightest. The PlayStation handles the action extremely well, shifting four or five detailed polygon figures around the screen without any slowdown. Camera angles are static, but this isn't a problem when you see how well animated the characters are Besides these angles vary, depending on where you stand in the room, and all of them add an air of dramatic suspense. Capcom have also used a bit of cunning, and disguised the PlayStation's loading times by showing the player a detailed door opening, or staircase at appropriate times. Excellent stuff, as these cut scenes add a little more tension to an already pant-filling experience. A IR:32 A Solve the mystery of the statues in the Armoury to gain a useful accessory. When climbing the main staircase, the scene cuts to this loading screen. MOANING AND GROANING The first main baddie encountered is the zombie. After a particularly gruesome rendered animation, the zombie stops devouring a decaying human and turns his attention to you. Here you can do one of three things: run away down a corridor, worried that your lack of weapons could prove a slight hindrance; stand and fight the zombie with your bowie knife, resulting in our undead assailant dodging your ineffectual stabs and clamping his rotting mouth around your neck, or locate and arm yourself with weaponry. Once you've located a natty piece of ordinance, you may blow away any number of zombies in a variety of disgracefully gory scenes! A Try not to scream too loudly as this huge tentacled beast grabs your character. A Upon happening across this grisly scene, the action switches to a gory cinematic. Blast this spider to bits and hundreds of babies burst from its rotten abdomen. Follow this heart-rending chase sequence from the bottom to the top. 27 "


"PREVIEW DETAIL UPON GORY DETAIL! Apart from the trusty shotgun, there's a huge variety of items and weapons to locate. Fancy a bit of revolver action? Try the six-shooter which blows the legs of giant spiders with little trouble. We also located a flamethrower, but can't describe the subsequent death scenes â they're too disgraceful to mention! On the investigative front, you'll be pleased to know that there are sections of the mansion that require lateral thinking skills, although the puzzles never become tedious. In fact they add even more tension to the game, as Gill Valentine found out... A Aim for the head with a shotgun and you'll hear the good old 'cabbage explosion' sound, and witness a shower of green blood as the head pops and the body topples to the floor. A Zombified Doberman hounds yap and snarl before chomping your neck, and these dogs of doom die in a most realistic manner, complete with howls of pain! Animation is totally convincing. A decaying hallway houses a huge and horrific triffid-like plant. It lashes out with tentacles that send victims flying across the room. A Even the plants are alive in this house of horror, as we found out when a giant tendril darted out and throttled Chris! A Prepare for an encounter with a giant snake that picks you up and eats you whole, leaving only the bloodied stumps of your legs behind. A We leapt with fear as we encountered a spider so large that it filled the entire screen! Don't you just HATE spiders!!! Still more hidden items are found by shunting certain objects around. 28 "


"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG When you encounter the laboratory, you shall know the real meaning of you shall know the real meaning of the word FEAR. When this title arrives, we dare you to play this in a darkened room with the volume at maximum! A That blackened object heading toward the screen used to belong to the zombie. It's his head, and Gill just booted it off! HIGH LOW STANDARD A Thought you might like to see how cool the characters look when taking aim. Plus this gives you some indication of how precise the game plays. Beautiful painting. Not sure of the artist though. Constable? Or that zombie, using blood as his medium! Gill seemed like the best candidate to show off the detail evident on all characters. RECURRING NIGHTMARE What a game this is! Hopefully, our brief run-through has whetted your appetite for some Resident Evil related action. It should have done, as this looks to be the most atmospheric, playable and downright terrifying release of the year. More soon. A We picked these two shots out to demonstrate the fantastic lighting effects encountered throughout the game. 29 "


"CVG anime FEATURE PlayStation ne night warriors SATURN Capcom. Ever heard of them? Haha, just kidding. But seriously, don't think The Night of the Capcom Beat 'Em Up ends on Street Fighter Alpha. With supernatural strength they have returned once more! here is a world that lies beyond the alleyways of the Street Fighters. A dark country that exists beyond the colourful universe of the X-Men. A land filled with the kind of people that haunt the nightmares of Ken and Ryu. The sort of crea tures that Magneto fears lurk in the darkest corner of his cupboard. Monsters that would make Blanka wet his nappy. It is the twilight zone of the Capcom cosmos... where the Darkstalkers live! A Capcom beat 'em up filled with horror chararcters. Of all the titles in the latest wave of Capcom beat 'em ups, this is the one that you'd expect would be the nastiest, the gloomiest, the most unpleasant, the most terrifying of them all. But you'd be wrong! With Darkstalkers, Capcom have turned out their wackiest, most colourful and downright funniest fighting game yet! Darkstalkers was Capcom's first spin-off from the StreetFighter series. Just when people were wondering where Capcom could go after Super StreetFighter 2 Turbo, they took their patent StreetFighter gameplay and turned out a different game with new characters and a new theme. Horror! The differences to Darkstalkers went further than just the visuals, but it was the graphics that stood out as the most significant step-up! The amazing characters and backdrops look more like cels from a Disney cartoon than graphics from a sprite-based beat 'em up. Each character performs so many fantastical moves, blended together with seamless animation. Together with the sheer amount of detail in the backdrops, the on-screen madness is enough to send anyone without the power of second-sight completely mad! And now the original Darkstalkers is coming to the PlayStation with Saturn owners getting the sequel! For sheer mightiness X-Men might rule, and Street Fighter Alpha may well be THE fighting game, but those in the know claim the Darkstalkers games are the best. Perhaps it's time to find out why... THE DARKSTALKERS At first glance, Capcom seem to have missed an opportunity. Where are all the classic horror characters you'd expect in a game like this? Well, they're right in front of you! What might seem likea bizarre collection of weirdos is actually a lineup of horror's finest figureheads. 30 "

So, with a surplus of unsold arcade boards, Capcom decided to update the game and rerelease it. The result was Vampire Hunter: Darkstalkers Revenge! Four extra playable characters and more advanced play mechanics make this the game that true Capcom fight-fans swear by. PLAY AS DARKSTALKER BOSSES PHOBOS, THE ROBOT He's like a junior version of the Sentinel from X-Men, but his moves are near enough as powerful. Rockets, lasers and icebeams make up his projectile attacks, whilst st close-range he can transform into a huge magnet and bodyslam his foes. Pull off a reverse dragonpunch for this laser attack! PYRON, THE ALIEN Imagine setting fire to The Blob and you've got this incredible shape-changing fire-creature. From a flaming wheel attack, to projectile plasma balls and teleportations, this is one of the weirdest fighters you'll ever play. It's like controlling a living lava lamp! A Pyron's ex-special ignites his foes! OS 15: A Pyron's equivalent of the cannonball attack! A Guess who's the winner in this picture. A Phobos rarely stays in humanoid shape. He's the ultimate Transformer! VAMPIRE-HUNTING TECHNIOUES CHAIN PAIN If you've read our mind-boggling Street Fighter Alpha review, you should know all about chain-attacks. Well, Vampire Hunter invented them. What's more it identifies chain attacks seperately from normal combos. Perform one of these fast strings of attacks and 'chain combo' flashes on screen with the number of hits. Punier combos just get a flash recording the number of hits. 32 "


"FEATURE FEATURE CVG TWO NEW DARKSTALKERS HAVE ARISEN! DONOVAN, THE DARK HUNTER LEI-LEI, THE CHINESE GHOST The man the game is named after. Donovan might be hunting down all the Darkstalkers, but he isn't entirely human himself. He can draw demons out of his body a fire one, an electrical one and an ice one and also wields a sword which he can place into the ground and launch at an opponent, providing they don't throw it back at him first! Anyone who's seen the Chinese Ghost Story films that Channel 4 should recognise the undead creature Lei-Lei is. Her powercomes from her sleeves, from which she can draw all manner of projectiles, chains to propel her like a scythe across the screen and even screenhigh blades. She also uses a large gong to repel attacks. DOMOVURE NOVATE Special A Donovan performs his electric spirit attack! Shoving her hands into the ground, Lei-Lei produces these deadly blades! Donor DONOR INDZON A His Ex-Special move generates a genie that crushes his foes with its massive foot! All her weaponary comes out of her sleeves. Even this massive weight that drops spikey balls onto the screen! ESPECIALLY SCARY! Aside from the ridiculously over top Ex-Specials, Vampire Hunter also features 'Especials', special moves that use the Ex-Special energy to super-power them! Together with the Ex-Specials, each character has six Super Moves, so when fully charged they can theoretically unleash each of them in a row! SUPERNATURAL SPECIALS Fans of Capcom's beat 'em ups should be more than aware of Super Specials since the days of Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo. Vampire Hunter however, pushes the concept to the limit with its Ex-Special moves, Alpha might have a threestrength special meter, but VH allows you to store SIX FULL levels of charge, ready to be unleashed! This makes for specatacular battles, simply because VH's Ex-Special moves are guaranteed to be the most ludicrous seen in any fighting game! NEXT MONTH: We review the official version of PlayStation Darkstalkers, with Vampire Hunter to follow the month after. 33 "

Chain Combos allow for swift and effective sequences of moves to score big points. CCs are similar to the set pieces that have always existed, only they're faster and require greater precision. IT TOES DEFENCE Protection is a far more adaptable skill in Alpha, compared to the relatively crude example set by its predecessors. Or successors, depending on which way you look at it. GUARD WHILE AIRBORNE When blocking in the air fighters are protected against most regular attacks, and even some specials projectiles included. Don't expect to fluke your way past a full-on Dragon Punch though, or any perfectly-timed uppercut for that matter. SHOW NO FEAR At times where a challenger's performance is so laughable it just deserves ridicule, players may do just that. Tapping the Select button (PlayStation), or shoulder buttons (Saturn) prompts your fighter into a mocking pose. This is only possible once a round, but the look on your rival's face is priceless. Plus their predictably frenzied reactions often lead to further humiliation in the form of a beautiful counter attack. SPLIT-SECOND GUARD Fighters have freedom of movement when blocking, right up until a split second before contact. Meaning It's possible to walk backwards when the opponent is on the offensive, whether it be with a projectile, jumping attack, or just taunts. PLESS STOR TUMBLE ACROSS THE FLOOR When knocked for six, using a fireball technique allows fighters to roll toward their opponent on landing. Use of this option prevents being bounced into a corner trap. As the move is so fast, launching an attack straight after works as a nasty surprise! 1500PTS BUMPY RIDE Hitting a fighter again when they're as good as down is a technique known as Juggling. We saw it first in SSF2 Turbo, and it has appeared in some form or another in many recent fighting games especially with the 3D mob.

While I don't profess to be anything like an SF master, I've played these games long and hard enough to recognise how clearly the gameplay has improved over the years. Few games match the precision control and artistic finesse which characterises the SF series, and Alpha is without doubt the pinnacle thus far. Before the 32-bit systems, some players used to hand over at least  for a Capcom CPS2 unit containing the latest 'must-have' version of Street Fighter. Seems we're forgetting too soon how it felt to long for an exact arcade conversion job on the 16 bit machines. It never happened.

With a fertile new hunting ground to plunder for, potentially, huge rewards. When their Gex character strolled nonchalantly onto 3DO last year, he had no competition. For all that, he was still pretty cool. Cutting to the chase: PlayStation already has one critically acclaimed platform hero to its name Rayman. That same character is also doing pretty well for the Saturn. Plus, Sega's machine has the excellent Clockwork Knight 2 to its name. Basically this Gex guy is fighting some stiff competition. Fortunate for him that Crystal Dynamics dreamt up some neat tricks of his own. Rather, they ripped 'em all off. But what the heck. Grasshoppers fill Gex with super gecko jumping power. LET'S PLAY TV GAME 80,5236 ,6 Playing Gex is all about switching on as many TVs as possible, without dying. Sort of like the CVG games area on a grander scale. Once a TV is warmed up, Gex is allowed to enter whichever programme it's running to explore for treasure. In all cases the crucial reward is a remote control; the tool for activating still more TVs. The type of encounters Gex expects to face are dictated by whichever Media Dimension he is drawn into Graveyard, Cartoon, Jungle, or Kung Fu.

Faster paced than Rayman, and busier than Clockwork Knight, although not nearly so inventive as either of those two. For a tall sprite, Gex is a surprisingly nippy character to operate. What struck me the most about this platformer is that there are tests of skill appearing almost every second step. Though you might loathe the humour, the last thing this game is guilty of is being boring. While every Gexism is traceable to various points of an experienced player's 16-bit library, this doesn't stop what's on offer from being inanely enjoyable. Gex is a good enough example of a skillfully constructed platformer. The music is cool, and the visuals are -by and large very slick. In the absence of Mega Man, Contra, and Sonic, Gex seems to impress. But both Saturn and PlayStation are capable of supporting much better. PAUL DAVIES May not be the crucial buying choice of the year, but Gex has lots to offer platforming fans, and most total addicts' itchy fingers!

In fact, there are about the same number of Basketball sims as Soccer sims available. Occasionally, however, basketball games manage to create real excitement among UK players (NBA Jam, for example) and Total NBA managed to cause quite a fuss long before its release by being the most impressive game on the free Demo 1 disc.

They can, however, really help to increase the atmosphere of a game, and in Total NBA they do just that. The 3D characters have all been motioncaptured, meaning that they all move very realistically and smoothly, and they perform a wide variety of shots, dunks and falls. The reflections on the court are what give the game a look of real depth, and these are created in a very clever way. Underneath the real court there are transluscent 3D nets, advertising boards and players' lower legs which mimic what is happenening on the court above. These can be seen through the transluscent court floor, giving the impression that they're actually reflections. Clever, eh? HALF TIME SCORE 4 OF 6 O OF O OF O GOALS POINTS HROWS FIELD GOALS 3.

He also says all of the players' names when they score, with certain players causing him to get particularly excited \"Scottteeeeeee!! Pippeeeen!!\", for example. VERDICT PLAYSTATION Total NBA has got what are undoubtedly some of the best graphics yet seen in a sports sim, and the sound's pretty excellent too. And the presentation's brilliant. Of course, the most important part is whether the actual game's any good, and thankfully Total NBA is very good. The controls work well, giving you a good sense of actually controlling the players on the court. The problem comes with it being basketball. I know the fans hate people saying this, but basketball is one of the more repetitive sports around. Run to one end, shoot, run to the other end. shoot, run to the other end, shoot... Total NBA just doesn't add enough to the basic running and shooting, unlike NBA Jam with its flames and powerups, and NBA: In the Zone with its fancy tricks and moves.

"CVG REVIEW REVIEW Another of the PC's top games arrives on the PlayStation and looks set to get shoot 'em up fans excited all over again. PLAYSTATION SHOOT 'EM UP INTERPLAY  OUT MARCH DESCENT DI QUCD SATURN VERSION PLANNED PC VERSION AVAILABLE The idea of Descent, as with most games, sounds really simple on paper. Fly your tiny ship around a load of mine shafts and bases inside moons and asteroids, searching for hostages. Pick up the hostages, locate and destroy the reactor, then get out before the whole place goes up! Unfortunately, the series of complex tunnels is full of service droids gone mad and they're all out to stop you. Fortunately, your ship can hold lasers and missiles, as well as the more powerful mining weapons found around the tunnels. The game was thought of by many as the successor to Doom, to become the ultimate 3D shoot 'em up. It has certainly created a lot of excitement among PC owners, and is still incredibly popular today, even when the PC sequel is almost available. It's not hard to see why. This slightly dull sequence shows how fantastic the lighting really is in Descent. AY' YA GO' A LOIGHT BOY? The PlayStation's fantastic hardware is used again to create a more realisticlooking game than on the PC. Shots from both the enemies and your own ship light up the walls with whatever colour the flare happens to be. For example, if you launch a missile into a pitch black room, the explosion will light everywhere up, letting you see what's hiding. This sequence shows a laser beam flying down a tunnel, lighting the walls on either side as it goes along (Above). SCORE: 24550 200 Eur A Here, red and blue lasers meet to make a nice purple light. Mm. L. LAST A These are the most stupid of all the enemy ships. Nearly as thick as Tom C. MAPS OF DEATH Seeing as all of Descent's levels are complete 3D, the map isn't a basic overhead view. When requested, the wire frame outline of the level appears, and shows all areas already visited. To make it easier to see where everything is, the whole thing can be spun around and zoomed in. It's still flipping complicated though (Left). GOD 44 50 "


"REVIEW CVG (VERDICT PLAYSTATION | SCORES Descent is another of my favourite PC games, and one which I've played a lot. The excellent graphics, sound, atmosphere and natural control really suck a player in. When I say \"natural control\", I mean that the ship's handling is so comprehensive that after a while you can move around anywhere without thinking about it. The graphics are just about identical to the PC version, and run about as smooth as on a good Pentium, but with the added bonus of the amazing lighting effects. The music is also improved, and the sound effects are just as good as before. Most PC-toconsole conversions don't look quite as good as the originals, but Descent looks better and sounds better than ever. The one down side is that even the PlayStation pad with its many buttons doesn't have enough for this game! The most noticeable deficiency is that you can't fly straight up or down without tilting, the nose of the ship. Not a massive problem, I know, but it can still be a bit annoying at times. Overall though, this is an excellent game with a real long-last, ing challenge, and enough of everything for everyone.

There are bound to be many of you who haven't seen Descent running before, and as such, can't imagine how it all moves around. The ship can move in absolutely ANY direction and can rotate on any axis. Because of this, as well as the lack of gravity, there is no \"up\" and no \"down\", meaning that pilots can enter a room any way they want. This can lead to a bit of confusion and it often turns out that the enemies in a room will be a different way up to the pilot. The new rendered intro features your boss showing you what to do.

"CVG REVIEW REVIEW SATURN/ PLAYSTATION STRATEGY BULLFROG MAGIC CARPET .99 OUT MARCH ONE PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS (PLANNED PC VERSION AVAILABLE It's something most of us dream of owning at some point or another â and if you ask Tom Cox it has something to do with birds and bees... THE LITTLE PEOPLE he PC version of Magic Carpet went down a storm at the end of 1994, as it featured one of the most impressive 3D game engines yet seen. Not only that, but the clever blend of the \"God game\" strategy and the action shoot 'em up drew people right into the mystic goings on. It was so popular that after a while, an additional set of levels was released Hidden Worlds an extra 25 realms set in some particularly harsh snowy mountains. These new levels are included in the console versions, meaning there are 75 massive areas to play though! The story is that the world has been shattered into separate realms by one of the many wizards fighting for possession of mana, a powerful substance found in all living things. As the apprentice of one of these wizards, you are forced to ride your magic carpet and restore the world to equilibrium by collecting mana from each of the realms, and by stopping the other wizards from getting their hands on what could make them powerful enough to take over the world! When the world was split into the separate realms, not all of the inhabitants were destroyed. In each area, there are civilians who can be forced to support you. Each household you possess gives you more personal mana to power your spells. The little people aren't just for show, as there are different characters: TOWNIES These guys stay in the village and don't do a lot. The trees aren't just for decoration, shoot them and you'll see that... TRADERS Known to Wander from village to village. BUILDERS Walk outside the village and build more houses. ...the whole forest catches fire, damaging anything silly enough to go near it! OKAY. SO WHAT THE FLAMING HECKS DO I DO NAAH? The main idea of Magic Carpet is to collect the required amount of mana in each realm by possessing any found floating free, or contained in one of the many beasts found in the realm. Seeing as your wizard can't hold much at a time, you can use one of your spells to create a castle to hold your mana collection. Once set up, your castle sends out a hot air balloon to retrieve any possessed mana and return it to your castle for storage. Of course, it isn't always this simple, as there are often opposing wizards trying to do exactly the same thing while attempting to destroy you or your castle. Here's how it plays on World 1: Al Jahan, a simple level. First of all, make a castle and then go off and get some of the free mana. Oo! A snake monster! Hit him a few times to get some more mana! Use some mana to make your castle bigger, then your balloon gets more. Hooray! That's the world restored to equilibrium! On to the next one! 52 "


"REVIEW DABRACADABRARA....ER? BACRABA... DAMN! Seeing as you play as an apprentice wizard, you don't know many spells to begin with â they have to be collected from the red jars found in most realms. The console versions have got a new, quicker-to-use spell bar, which shows all those available. Here they all are. We won't go into too much detail about each of them because they're fairly self-explanitory. HIDDEN WORLDS The best feature of Magic Carpet on the consoles is the massive number of levels. As we've said before, there are the original 50 levels, plus 25 newer Â«Hidden Worlds\". The new set of levels not only look nice as they're covered in snow, but they also contain the new spell the Homing Meteor! We don't want to reveal too much about these new features as it'll ruin the end of the game for you, so here's just a few teaser pictures of what you'll be having nightmares about.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG SCORES TOM COX'S RELATIVES Unlike many games, the enemies in Magic Carpet can't always be avoided because they contain the mana that is needed to complete the level. On the first few levels, they don't cause too many problems, but later on you'll need all your carpet flying skills to stay alive. Here's a selection: THE MAGIC STONES Along the top of the screen are the three Stones of Knowledge the Castle Stone, the Balloon Stone and the Scorcerer's Stone. These show the current strength of each of the objects, as well as how much mana is presently held there. To the right of these are the Spell Stones, which show the two spells currently selected, one for each of the wizard's hands. To the left of the Stones is the All-Seeing Eye, a rotating map showing the immediate area, along with all the monsters, spells, mana, civilians and buildings. Enemy wizards don't show up, but any spells they cast, do an accelerate spell which leaves a trail of dots, for example. BARRELSERIEN WORMS Spit fireballs and die easily. BEES The whole swarm flies straight at you. VULTURES Like the Bees, only not as fast. DESCENT.. MAGIC CARPET DRAGONS Fireball-spitting flying worms. APES Big, slow and armed with massive rocks.

SORCERER'S STONE SPELLS STONE ANIMATION EMU RIDERS Run around firing arrows at you. CRABS The bigger they are, the worse they are. SKELETONS Loads of them march at your castle. The movement is excellent, but the enemies are jerky. MUSIC Excellent oriental tunes. The music reacts to the action. SOUND EFFECTS.. 89 KRAKEN Pop out of the water, hold you still and shoot lightning TROLLS Like small Apes, only they recharge their health. GENIES These guys steal all your mana. Brilliant spell sounds, enemy calls and explosions. GAMEPLAY Instantly accessable, but constantly challenging. VERDICT PLAYSTATION/SATURN VALUE. 75 massive and very hard levels will last for absolutely ages. WYVERN The hardest monster in the world. Can do anything it wants, just about. ENEMY WIZARD Armed with the same sort of spells as you, he steals your mana and attacks your castle. (OVERALL Magic Carpet is very impressive-looking, there's no doubt about that, and the game is a clever combination of strategy and shooting. The area in which the game isn't so impressive is the conversion from the PC original. Though that version only ran at the highest resolution on a super PC, these console versions have got slightly less detail than the regular mode. Also the vanishing point is a little bit nearer than before, and there aren't any reflections on the water. But these minor graphical details don't ruin the game at all. It still plays as well as it did, and the new, faster, spell menu means that the game isn't broken up as often as it used to be. Though there's always something to do in the game, it can get a bit repetitive after a few hours, as searching for and collecting the mana won't hold everyone's attention for ever. I totally recommend this to all shoot 'em up and strategy game fans, and the only decision now is which version to get if you've got both machines. Seeing as they both play exactly the same, I'd say to go for the prettier PlayStation version. An excellent cross breed of a God sim and a 3D shoot 'em up. Though it's a bit repetitive, there's always stuff to do. And it's all fun stuff. ED LOMAS Take out enemy balloons to cause them some real problems. Or, take out the enemy castles and possess all of their mana. 55 "

START COM JOE HIGASHI BLUE-MARY JOE HIGASHI BLUE-MARY RIVERSIDE riginally released by SNK to cash in the original Street Fighter 2 fad, Fatal Fury and its sequels have never been as good as their Capcom opponents, but of late, the SNK produce has got much, much better, with King of Fighters '95 currently ruling as the most technically stunning fighting game around so what's the point releasing yet another one-on-one battler? PIISH START Well, in our view there's always room for another fighting game if it truly offers something better than what's around at the moment and in many ways, Real Bout Fatal Fury (the fifth game in the series to date) delivers in spades. The scenario remains as implausible as ever, as do the names of the Fury fighters: Geese Howard has arisen from the dead (explanation: \"I got better\") to reclaim his position as the gangland boss of Southtown. Armed with the mystical might of the Qin scrolls, along with the most garish, ridiculous fighting trousers in history, nothing stands in his way. Apart from the Bogard brothers Andy and Terry along with their fellow adventurer, kick-boxing specialist Joe Higashi. Organising a new King of Fighters tournament, Geese is determined to root out the Bogard siblings and anybody else who dares stands in his way: so prepare yourself for the most stunning Neo Geo fighting release of the year! MAI SHINANUT ANDY BOGARDE. \"TRUSAT GEESE HOHARD EE5E HOHARD CPFDITS as ANDY BOGARD A NEW LEVEL OF DEPTH Fatal Fury was quite original in that it introduced the concept of leaping \"in\" and \"out\" of the landscape, dodging attacks and countering. This remains the case in Real Bout, although it's possible to do so much more quickly. You can also dodge around an opponent as he attacks and counter. Overall, this all adds another layer of strategy to the fighting action and in this respect, it is superior to the Street Fighter series. GESE MOM AND WHAT'S NEW IN REAL BOUT? In keeping with the innovations Capcom have made with Street Fighter Alpha, SNK have upgraded the play mechanics of Fatal Fury. Real Bout has a chain combo system similar to Alpha (including for the first time, an on-screen \"Rush Hit\" combo counting system), a Guard Cancel attack reversal system along with a far more logical system of throwing an opponent. Also copied from Capcom is the airborne blocking system, although this has been expanded to allow players to change direction in mid-air as well a technique that can confuse human opponents.

Another original touch SNK have made to Real Bout is the addition of a Ring Out system similar in execution to Virtua Fighter series. The extreme ends of each ring are blocked off with destructible scenery. Get your foe into a corner and your attacks on him cause impact on the side of the ring. Hit it hard enough and it crumbles, giving you plenty of scope to push your opponent out of the ring. Should this occur, a humiliation scene takes place, including the odd drowning, electrocution or unscheduled tube train journey! Curiously, the latter happening is the most humbling of all...

NEO GEO The prospect of yet another SNK Fatal Fury game didn't exactly fill my day with the kind of satisfaction and excitement I usually seek from my video games. And indeed, when Real Bout arrived I thought my initial aversion to the title was well justified. However, having actually spent some time with the game I can see why SNK made the effort. With a gargantuan choice of sixteen different characters complete with a bewildering array of special moves and techniques, Real Bout Fatal Fury is an accomplished fighting game that has the most exact ing, precise gameplay mechanics yet seen in a oneon-one combat title. And in this respect, yes, it is by far and away better than Street Fighter Alpha. The only problem with the game is that it lacks the real charac ter seen in Capcom's offerings (although Geese Howard's outsize trousers have an appeal unique in the world of video games) along with the ease of use and overall satisfaction Street Fighter and its ilk pro \"vide. There's a lot to master in Real Bout Fatal Fury and that sort of challenge is what Neo Geo owners seem to crave, but the fact remains that the all-conquering King of Fighters '95 remains superior. Overall, a cracking beat 'em up to tide you over until the inevitable King of Fighters '96 crops up. FVFI CREDITS Technically, nothing can touch Real Bout. But in terms of fun and overall satisfaction, there are better battlers about. WHAT NEXT FOR SNK? Having just about done everything possible with the one-on-one fighting genre, what more could SNK possibly come up with? Well, two new titles in development could take the genre to new heights. First up we have Art of Fighting 3, which takes SNK's beat 'em up know-how and adds motion-captured sprites. Later on in the year, we can expect the latest (and probably) last chapter in the King of Fighters saga. In the meantime, the company are set to make a mint by converting KoF '95 to Saturn and then PlayStation whilst developing Real Bout Fatal Fury for the Sony machine. Saturn owners have to put up with the elderly Fatal Fury 3 and the tragi-comedy that is World Heroes Perfect. RICHARD LEADBETTER 57 "


"CVG REVIEW REVIEW SEGA PC PC CD-ROM Until now the only way to play Sega's homegrown titles, has been to own a Sega console. Now all that's changed. Sega Of America have turned to the rapidly expanding PC CD-ROM market with conversions of their better Mega Drive titles. PROCESSOR VARIOUS TYPES SEGA .99 (EACH) OUT END OF MARCH ONE PLAYER REQUIRES PENTIUM PROCESSOR 60 Mhz, 8 MB MEMORY NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED MEGA DRIVE VERSIONS AVAILABLE COMIX ZONE SEGA PC omix Zone e Mode Options POX Help Comix Zone Game Mode Options POX Help .../ MNOW OF A PERFECT PLACE TO DO IT: VERDICT PC CD-ROM One of the best Mega Drive titles of last year was this original beat 'em up from the Sega Technical Institute. The plot puts you in the role of a comic book artist, humorously named Sketch Turner, who gets sucked into one of his own comic books. And herein lies the original element of the game, as you guide Sketch through the pages of the comic, battling monsters created by his own hand. The game's six levels are made of different panels like comic pages. Beat up all the bad guys in one panel, then swing onto the next one. Certain panels require puzzle-solving to get through them, and there's even a vague plot that unfolds as you work through the game. Comix Zone might be a straight conversion of a Mega Drive game, but it's still impressive. The PC lacks good arcadey scrolling beat 'em ups, and Comix Zone delivers a satisfying Streets of Ragestyle fighting feel. The graphics capture American comic art per fectly, and there's some excellent touches such as the arch villain's hand appearing to draw new enemies. The main downfall of Comix Zone is its length. The levels are only one or two 'pages' long, and they don't take long to crack. On the limited space of a Mega Drive cart, this might be excusable, but PC owners used to lengthy titles may find it all a bit too brief.

"REVIEW CVG ECCO THE DOLPHIN SCGA PC (VERDICT PC CD-ROM 762 During the Mega Drive's heyday at the end of 1992. one title that showed the machine's capabilities was Ecco The Dolphin. When most games were horizontal shoot 'em ups, beat 'em ups and cutesy platformers, one in which you guided a dolphin around the oceans was something of revela tion. More so, because the graphics were so realistic, with super-fluid dolphin movement and luminous underwater effects. Now PC owners have the chance to play this Mega Drive legend. Or more accurately, the Mega-CD version which contains extra SGI-generated cutscenes and ambient music reeled off the CD. The PC-CD version is identical, except you can increase the resolution of the graphics. Guiding Ecco around a series of underwater mazes, you have to solve various puzzles. Find baby dolphins, touch glyphs (ambient hippy crystals, daddio) in the right order, speak to whales with your sonar, etc. Although the game received rave reviews, the truth is, you can either stomach Ecco or you can't (he tastes a bit like chicken). The tranquil, puzzle solving activities either stimulate your new-age gaming brain or drive, you mad. More so if you haven't got a joypad. Performing the delicate manoeuvres with the keyboard is fiddly and with the mouse, totally impossible! And, three years later on a Pentium PC, the graphics aren't too impressive either. TOM GUISE NEXT UP... SONIC CD 5.9% Set for a May release is the long-awaited first Sonic PC title. Possibly the weakest of the Sonic titles, but it's still excellent fun, thanks to its time-travelling shenanigans. Unfortunately though, this is going to be a conversion of the American version of the game. So, gone are the brilliant Japanese Toot-toot-Sonic themes. Ecco at the higher resolution. Allery BE BAKU BAKU The excellent AM3 puzzle game is set for a PC release. Aside from the addictive Tetris-style match-the-animal-to-its-food gameplay, the presentation is also superb. Rendered animal heads munch around the screen, whilst the icons weep when they can't reach their food. WHAT ELSE... PC CD-ROM One delight the Mega-CD brought us was the 'interactive movie'. Sub Dutch-TV standard films, which you keep going by press a joypad button at EXACTLY the right time. There are a few tities that have broken the mould, most notably Double Switch (reviewed on PC this very issue). TomCat Alley was also a successful attempt, if only because it disguised the lack of gameplay by keeping you busy. It's a Top Gun affair, putting you in the role of flying ace, Johnny Dakota, as you take your F-14 into enemy territory, destroying MiGs. Actually, YOU don't take your fighter anywhere. Instead, the game unfolds and when enemy planes appear, you guide the sight over them and shoot. Hit them and the game continues. Miss, and you have to hit the 'evasion-roll icon or be destroyed. Simplistic, but TomCat Alley is still fun. Unlike most FMV games, the lack of instant-death actually makes it feel like a game. Plus, there are certain mission objectives photograph enemy bases, blow up bridges and so on. And the one saving grace of all FMV games the plot is entertaining. Peculiarly. Sega haven't increased the FMV quality for the PC-CD conversion, which is inexcusably grainy. Plus, PC-CD owners are probably used to classier 'interactive movies. Rebel Assault 2, for example. Fun as TomCat Alley is, it doesn't cut it as a PC-CD title. Recently released, are a range of new graphic boards supporting the NVDIA NV-1 chip, which can handle perfect conversions of Saturn titles. The most famous from Diamond Edge, costs around - and comes packaged with Virtua Fighter Remix. Panzer Dragoon is also available. Having played VF Remix, we found it required a P90 to play the game at the right speed and only after the backgrounds had been removed. The Saturn titles used on these boards aren't actually being published by Sega, who say they are conducting 'feasibility studies' into getting their games running without any additional hardware (Virtua Cop with mouse control was mentioned). So, PC owners wanting Saturn titles would be wise to either wait a bit longer or buy a Saturn. A The FMV is as grainy as ever. Still, this does help disguise the model aeroplanes. TOM GUISE 59 "

The Restroom is where to access the options, such as loading or saving games (Big Game Mode only), or check out the Jukebox which is loaded with monster tunes from prominent metal artists Soundgarden, Therapy, Paw, Hammerbox, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. The 3DO version boasts a similar selection. (VERDICT PLAYSTATION How many incarnations is this, and EA still can't get that bloke to run properly! No matter, because Road Rash never set out to be a Linford Christie Sim it's a bikin' game, pure and simple. Or should that read 'mean and dirty'. Plus the entire series has ranked among the most-fun-you-can-have-with-a-console, titles for years now. Let's face it, the Road Rash series isn't famed for state-of-the-art graphical finesse. Those sprites have always been dodgy! But So what. The game has always been a magnet for closet nutters who, though they may tremble at the thought of being towed on a tricycle, pretend to like nothing better than tearing up country lanes on a Super Bike; tonking other road abusers with pieces of wood. I like this game for exactly the same reasons I liked the original MD version: it's trashy but playable as heck. The whole package is so well targeted, I'm sure few who loved the 16-bit series should feel short-changed. Of course it could have looked and sounded better in many respects especially on PlayStation but the game is all there. You may already own Extreme Sports, but Road Rash is still a cool option. wwmumu A Promo videos of the featured artists are 'spliced into the many OTT FMV sequences used between races.

Still, it's a cool game that's way different to anything else unless it's Road rash on 3DO! You're a laser man. Better luck next time! Roughly half way though each race the road forks. The righthand route is accessed from a narrow slip road, meaning it's tricky to pull onto at speed, but there's no reward for getting there. With both roads practically identical in challenge, the choice is usually affected by which is more likely to provide an open road. Basically it's your chance to advance positions with minimal aggro!

NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. ost of the Terminator games released have been, quite frankly, awful. Here's one that isn't. In fact, Terminator: Future Shock isn't even a teeny weeny bit awful it's actually brilliant! Even though it's not really based on the movie, it takes many ideas from it and the result is quite stunning. The game is set in a Skynet-ruled future, where Terminators and other killing machines rule the streets of post-apocalypse Los Angeles, and John Connor's resistance is the only thing standing between humanity and extinction. You've just escaped from a Terminator death camp, and you have to join Connor's intrepid mob and carry out a series of daring missions rescuing people, blowing things up and so on. All in glorious 3D. Beazer! RADIATION SAFE T H ARMOR 2012 484 HEALTH CONTROL FREAK DRIVEN CRAZY PIVOS JOINT FOR VOL ALLOWS B LOOM HOVER OVER RECENT DEAD   W A CONTROL SURFACE On first inspection, Terminator: Future Shock looks a bit like Doom (with Terminators), so you'd expect it to play almost identically. That's where you're wrong. Whereas Doom is a fairly simple affair, played with the keyboard or mouse, Terminator requires at least two different control methods: You can have one hand on the mouse and one on the keys, or substitute the keyboard for a joystick, or a joystick for the mouse. This is because one hand controls your movement running, walking, jumping and so on while the other controls weapon targeting. It's easier to aim and fire weapons using the mouse, while running away from assorted mechanical nasties is easiest with the keys. But you can configure the controls to your liking, so once you've hit on a combination that works for you, it isn't so confusing. Getting the hand of the controls is half the battle, and it's this that makes the game hard to get into at first. Once you've got to grips with it, though, you can concentrate on enjoying the game. And enjoy you will. Some 3D action games Doom or Hexen, for example restrict you to running around and shooting at things. Others, such as Interplay's Descent, put you in charge of a flying vehicle. And GameTek's Quarantine (often described as Doom in a taxi) involve driving. Terminator: Future Shock is varied and flexible enough to enable you to do all three. Bethesda describes the game as a cross between Doom and Descent. On some levels you simply have to run around with a large gun, a collection of Molotov Cocktails and a bad attitude. On a couple of other levels you're given a car to drive, which is brilliant fun. Like Activision's MechWarrior games, you can point your vehicle in one direction and let it get on with it while you look left, right up or down. 56 1925 *HIS EXIT Challenge a Spider to a scrap, and be prepared to move fast! They have eight legs. You have two! Remember the Hunter-Killers from the opening sequence in The Terminator? Well, with a bit of crafty hot-wiring you can fly one of those babies. They pack some pretty mean weapons, but you're going to need them to go up against the other Hunter-Killers! It's easy to lose control of the car while you're trying to aim your guns at a large spider robot that has suddenly materialised off to the right but like the rest of Future Shock's control system, you do get used to it. 62 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG bH SCORES PO COWARDY CUSTARD HEAVY METAL LERINA With Doom players earn big points for killing everything that moves. Don't be so hasty with Future Shock. There's no medals for suicidal heroics a dead resistance fighter is no good to anyone. Each mission has its own goal, and you have to keep sight of that at all times, even if it means tucking your tail between your legs and running away. There are no extra points for wiping out everything else. Whatever the mission objective, is exactly what you are required to do. Nothing more, nothing less. It's kind of hard to get used to after playing games like Doom because your instincts tell you to shoot anything, but Future Shock is a lot more strategic. There are more than enough opportunities to use your vast array of weapons, but it's better to pick off the robots that actually get in your way than to set out with the intention of destroying anything that moves. If you do that, you'll just run out of ammo and end up dying horribly. You have been warned. You'd be wrong if you thought that Terminators were the only nasties you'll come up against. Sure, there's plenty of 'em (a terrifying prospect given the damage one solitary Terminator managed to do in the movie), but there are all sorts of other horrible killing machines besides. The Terminators themselves come in two \"flavours\" â the naked skeleton type, and the human-looking infiltration units. Both are dangerous, but a well-placed grenade or rocket will reduce them to scrap metal. TERMINATOR RAMPAGE FUTURE SHOCK.... DESCENT..... GRAPHICS Then there are robots that, if you blast their heads off, their legs continue to stomp around harmlessly like headless chickens. Similar to these, but a lot nastier, are the spider robots. These long-leggedy beasties are big, bad and utterly lethal. Kill them quickly, or if you can't manage that, run away quickly. ... 89 Dark and moody. Not jaw-dropping, but definitely appropriate. ANIMATION........88 Pretty good. It's hard to cock up a robot animation after all. Hunter-Killers cruise the skies and are a complete pain in the butt. If you're concentrating on the ground-based robots, you might not notice when one of these flying nightmares materialises over your head until the last minute. Some Hunter-Killers shoot at you, but others drop bombs and do an awful lot of damage. One word of warning when dealing with these: if you do manage to hit one, get out of the way fast. Getting hit on the head by a large piece of burning wreckage is definitely not good for your health. MUSIC Good if you've got powerful soundcard and speakers. SOUND EFFECTS. 93 Close to the 'real' thing-scary robot noises and loud gunfire. Finally, there are the drones. These floating sentries don't look as scary as the robots, but they're equally bad news. Some act as mines, drifting on up to you and then exploding in your face. Not nice, granted, but not quite as bad as the ones which alert every machine in the vicinity to your presence so that you suddenly find yourself surrounded by an army of unfriendly metal. Ouch. GAMEPLAY. Controls are hard to master, but ultimately very rewarding. VALUE 92 \" ARMOR HEALTH Bound to keep you entertained for ages. Just brilliant! OVERALL VERDICT. PC CD-ROM When you first see this game, it's easy to write it off as just another Doom clone. Yes, it's a 3D action blaster, but the resemblance stops there. Future Shock is mission-based, and there's so much more variety than in id's classic you can drive cars around, fly Hunter Killers and look up and down. There's far more freedom of movement, but this does come at a price --the controls are extremely tricky to master. Once you get the hang of it, though, you'll be hooked. This is one of the most atmospheric games I've played. The dark, moody graphics, brilliant sound effects and rumbling music add up to quite an experi ence. Unplug the phone, lock yourself in your room and turn out the lights and I guarantee it'll scare the living daylights out of you. Imagine creeping around a derelict building in the dark, opening and door and finding yourself face to face with a Terminator. Not pleasant. Terminator: Future Shock it's tough to get into but once you're there it's unbelievably brilliant. The more you play, the better it gets. Tired old quote, we know, but one that's especially true in this case. ARMOR CAL JONES HEALTH 63 "

Take the 3D premise of id's Doom with its brilliant atmosphere, but replace the Barons of Hell and Beholders with the acid-blooded creatures from the Alien trilogy of films. The idea was first mooted six years back, when Probe took the idea of such a game to Acclaim with the intention of releasing it for the ill-fated Mega-CD system. As time wore on, though, it became apparent that the humble Sega system wouldn't be able to handle such a game, and the idea was put on hold until a system with the hardware to handle such a game emerged. Of course, the PlayStation and the Saturn are such machines, and now Acclaim and Probe duly invite 32-bit owners to don the grimy vest of Ellen Ripley, and enter three, multilevel stages based on the classic films. While the plot takes more than a few liberties Probe have taken the best aspects of the three films and married them beautifully into a smartlooking shoot 'em up. As the player explores rooms coated in the alien secretions, the titular monsters lurch from the ceiling, Facehuggers appear from cracks in the walls, eggs split open, and humans are dormant in the walls playing host to a new wave of aliens. At first sight, it seems to have everything Acclaim promised all those years ago, but let's face it Doom really is the benchmark by which all others are measured. ERITIEDOTTITIE 2011 A No matter which way you view the aliens, they appear as believable 3D representations. This is all due to Acclaim's advanced motion capture technology.

T15 Get 100 Gerade THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS 109 203 Charge 002 Armor 200 One of the puzzles surrounding Trilogy when it was in development was how were Probe going to cram all three films into one game? Obviously, there was bound to be a bit of artistic licence here and there as only Aliens actually offers a scenario worthy of a video game with the first and third films containing one alien apiece, and bugger all weapons. Incredibly, all three films are contained within the game (justifying its title), but the order of the trilogy has been altered. SOO MUTLULUTTET We can't believe it looks this good either! A PlayStation easily handles such effects. 217 DermPuch Grenadie 700 TIME SHARDS An FMV intro shows the player, cast as Ripley, and a load of colonial marines entering the Acheron base which featured so prominently in Aliens. As Bishop looks on, the team are decimated by an alien attack, and only Ripley survives. As such, the player is then left to explore the twelve levels which make up the Acheron base, before making her exit to the events of the next film. Alien 3's prison complex is rather conveniently relocated to elsewhere on Acheron for the next stage where Ripley is assigned to locate the stricken prisoners and again end the alien infestation. All this rather neatly brings us to the final installment, which returns to the events of the first film. Ripley this time enters the ship where Kane and Dallas found the eggs in Alien. The plot reveals that if this 'Bone Ship' is cleared of its contents, the alien menace will finally be over. At least, that is, until the proposed sequel... 990 110 HETTU A If this player had used the scanner properly, he would have seen that blip coming a mile off. Too late now! 65 "


"CVG REVIEW REVIEW 108 930  | | | 0 3 7 AA red display indicates that you're suffering some kind of injury. 200 BONE SHIP BEFORE VIDEO Not avslutte 3301 LEVEL HEADED As expected, Alien Trilogy draws heavily from the three films for its levels. Acheron, for example, is a dimly-lit base with the alien secretions rounding off many of the walls, and dead human colonists also acting as decoration. The aliens also react differently between the three locales, with the slimy walls allowing them to scuttle across the ceiling and conceal themselves, while the brightly-lit prison complex means there are less places to hide, and thus they are more exposed and aggressive. By far the most aesthetically polished stage, though, is the 'Bone Ship.' Probe's graphic artists have recreated the majority of the scenes seen in the film, and at the centre of the huge ship is the huge fossil the Nostromo crew examine in the film. By now, though, a mixture of aliens inhabit the ship and prove incredibly hard to blow away in the restricted spaces. 108 118 PRISON COMPLEX PRISON MORGUE Armor. 200 9 2011 119 TIR !! Lanade 100 Ripley begins her mission armed with a pistol but improved armaments are left scattered around the levels, presumably discarded by dead colonists and previous marine expeditions. Once again, fans of the second film will be in their element here, as Ripley eventually has access to shotguns, flamethrowers, smart guns, and pulse rifles, along with a selection of grenades and seismic charges. The latter prove incredibly GUN-HO effective against the aliens, but are best saved for the slight puzzle element the game offers. Basically, this boils down to locating previously invisible exits by using a grenade to clear away any alien secretions hardly brainstraining stuff! In addition to the said weapons, Ripley can also replenish lost health via a number of medi-kits punctuating the levels, while night lights and auto-mappers also prove useful. 999 HII 708 709 207 Grenada 100 910 TRUST 9101112 BEINT UT LUE A Open fire on the windows, and yell nervously over the sound of the noise!

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG 200 Temuull Grenade 100 MONSTER MASH The all-important aliens follow the precedent set by their on screen cousins and vary dramatically throughout the game. Initially, the aliens are akin to those of the first film, but later on you'll encounter quadruped varieties based on the dog alien of the third film, and a full-grown version of this which is golden in colour. Eggs and Facehuggers also play a huge part in the proceedings, and the later levels contain impregnated colonists. The colonists have been stuck into the walls by the alien warriors and, if approached, a sampled voice pleads with you to \"help.' If you continue to wait, though, they begin to convulse and a Chestburster erupts and begins to attack! Cool. The aliens also have a number of attack patterns, and a number of direct hits are needed to avoid their slashing claws. When an alien is killed, however, its shattered body is left with a puddle of acid seeping into the floor and walking on this reduces Ripley's health, proving the aliens are every bit as dangerous when dead. 999 || MOTTUTTO Total carnage on a scale like you wouldn't believe! 200 106 Cherge Shotgun cartridges Eorge CO2 ift activate Grande 100 Nope, we don't reckon a shotgun is enough to sort this guy out in one go! 910 THENIE 93913 Acid Armour Auto Mapper Battery Pack 9mm Pistol Cartridge Body Armour Boots Energy Burst Energy Tile Keep your blessed feet off that blood! 102 Flamethrower Hypo Kit ID CArd Medi Kit Pistol Flamethrower Cartridge Pulse Rifle Night Vision Goggles SIENNE Shotgun Pulse Rifle Grenade Smart Gun Pulse Rifle Cartridge Shoulder Light Shotgun Cartridge Smart Gun Ammo Smart Gun Grenade 074 102 Tasty!

Surrounded by eggs and freshly-hatched Facehuggers, the Queen is initially attached to a huge egg sac and remains this way if left alone. If, however, a stray bullets misses an egg and hits her, she breaks free of the sac and begins a series of rushing attacks. As befits her size and status, the Queen is incredibly hard to kill and is also deceptively fast considering her size. She also has a longer range with her tail and claw, and is an incredible sight as her extending jaws emerge as she attacks. The best means of attack is to enter her egg chamber and blow away all the eggs, before tackling her ensuring Ripley is armed with a number of grenades before moving in for the kill. After a succession of direct hits and sidestepping the Queen eventually explodes into a pile of mush, and the exit to the next scene and FMV sequence is opened. 103 999 THULE TUTTI Grenade 200 117 Armor 200 1999 TETOR Oh no, is that what I think it is? 7171 GeoO3 Armor 233 9101HET TUNITI She's back there somewhere not that you really want to find out!

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG 119 SCORES TTERIET Er, Hi! Fancy meeting you here. Yes. Funny that. I was just on my way to the shops. Want anything bringing back? No, it's okay I'll pay. A LES BESTLLEL TIITTITTITTEL 105 109 Grerade 100 Chorge CO2 Armor 200 23 DOOM PSX.......... ALIEN TRILOGY.... CRIME CRACKERS 9101 GRAPHICS Full of clever lighting effects and superbly animated sprites. (VERDICT ANIMATION. Motion-capture allows for aliens who move incredibly realistically. TRUE 3D We all hear a lot about motion-capture and its properties, and Alien Trilogy is the first game to feature Acclaim's motion-capturing work. An actor is wired up to mimic the alien moves, and these are transferred to an SGI workstation where an alien body is added to the skeleton his action have created. The benefit of such a system, though, is that Alien Trilogy's monsters are truly threedimensional. If you kill a soldier in Doom they'll fall over and their feet will be facing you. Walk past them, though, and because they are 2D sprites, the feet will still be in your direction! In Trilogy if you try to walk past an alien and turn, you'll see its side or a view from behind as it turns around similarly, when attacking the Queen it's possible to run between her legs to attack her from behind. This 3D also extends to the obstacles and crates within the game, and there are key areas in the game where Ripley can hide in crates and pick off the acidblooded critters from a safe vantage point! 90 (MUSIC A little too upbeat at times, but generally moodily effective. SOUND EFFECTS.. 92 PLAYSTATION Alien Trilogy was always going to be compared to Doom, and in my opinion it out-performs the id game as a single-player title. The missions aren't as fastpaced as those of Doom, but the atmosphere gener ated by the darkened rooms, the smoke effects and the sudden, squealing appearance of an alien or a Facehugger is hard to beat. Despite hordes of aliens appearing in the Alien and Alien 3 sections, Trilogy captures the feel of the three films perfectly. and the different worlds offer much-needed variety to what could have been a very dark game. Some of the levels are instantly recognisable from their celluloid counterparts, with players exploring the steel works of Alien 3 before entering the Jockey chamber containing the huge fossil seen in Alien. Part of the fun of exploration is little touches like these, but it is the blasting action that really sets Alien Trilogy above the rest. Real skill is needed to make your collected weapons last the duration, and the aliens also have intelligence above, that of most sprites with the Queens deserving a special mention. In all, this is the best game to emerge from Acclaim to date, and certainly one of the greatest film licences of all time. Guns and screeches are sampled directly from the film! 210 GAMEPLAY...... Home Grenge 100 Not as fast as Doom, but it requires more precision generally VALUE Quite simply Acclaim's greatest release yet. STEVE MERRIT OVERALL A brilliant homage to a classic trilogy of films. Immensely playable, a true challenge, and one of the first games to mix playability with 32-bit power! 999 THBURNIR A Careful of the acid blood. If you get too close it's likely to burn! (VERDICT PLAYSTATION At last a film license worthy of its namesake! Everything from the chilling, unsettling atmosphere to the smallest graphical detail is faithful to the timeless series of films (well the first two at least). The fear when playing Trilogy is real, which is testament to Probe's genius and hard work with this project. Just as LucasArts succeeded with Dark Forces. Probe deserve high commendation indeed!

With the meter displayed, fighters have a time limit in which to perform any sequence of moves standard, special, or super.

The one you need to get is Konami's ISS Deluxe no question. Irue enough, ISS Deluxe is a masterpiece of 16-bit soccer. But until now it's only been available on the Super NES. So maybe the news of a belated MD version is greeted with mixed feel ings: sure it's good, but it's a little LATE. Well the good news is that ISS on the Mega Drive has everything and more that made the Super NES original such a classic. FOUR-A-SIDE First thing Mega Drive owners need to know is that their version of ISS Deluxe allows eight people to play at once in any number of combinations.

The thing is, we've heard from the programmers of the Saturn version that he's actually just a fake character, made up to get everyone excited. Though that's probably true, we'll still keep our eyes open for him, just in case. Sad, aren't we. HOW CLOSE? From the screenshots you'll be able to tell that it looks pretty much identical to the arcade version, with the characters being the same size as the originals unlike every other home version of the MK series. The game plays at the same speedy pace of the arcade, and all of the moves and features work perfectly. The only slight problem is the usual CD access time. The only place it becomes a problem is when Shang Tsung morphs into a character other than his opponent, though this is improved over any other CD version of an MK game. 77 "

However the original team responsible Sonic choose a totally different approach for their own game. Though not a direct translation of the popular Shining Force series, Wisdom develops the fantasy world of Rune; paying homage to some of the key places and figures that have featured before. But here is where most similarities end... WISDOM 6 X 146 ZELDA ON THE SATURN You wish. In all fairness the Sonic team replicate the style of the Nintendo classics well.

Despite the upsurge of popularity for RPGs in America, Sega still shied away from releasing Shining Wisdom over there. They reckon the market wouldn't support it! So it has taken the initiative of a US-based company Working Designs to ensure America, and in turn the UK, gets to enjoy an English translation of this quality title. The company are also applying their skills to an English version of Sega of Japan's Magic Knight Ray Earth which looks GORGEOUS! All items collected are stored in this inventory screen, and assigned to either the A, B, or C button. Highlight the one you want to equip the relevant button. This is similar to Zelda: Link's Awakening. When solving the mysteries of the dungeons, the answer often relates to the positioning of switches.

ESCO WELL ROUNDED CHARACTERS As with Mystaria, the characters in SW are renders instead of sprites. Immediately the impression is that the visuals are much cleaner, so it's easier on the eye. The downside is that some of the charm of the previous Shining Force games is lost in the process. Broadly speaking, though, the overall effect is better. STORY SO FAR It takes quite a while to start cooking, but SW's plot is compelling in the Shining Force tradition. Here's a preview of what to expect from your first hour or so's play. First point of call is Odegan Castle, where our hero is recognised as the son of Sir Jiles a master swordsman. A strange mist envelopes the entire It's been ! years si area, sending nightmut 10h Day of ifee: strange seeing the entire castle into a deep sleep. Only Junior is left standing.

DOBNE The hero awakes in his Grandparents house same as he has been doing for the past ten years since his parents died. As you've noticed the Princess has been put to sleep for days by the magic of the Dark Eif. Last night's disturbance leaves the King feeling restless. He is worried for the safety of his daughter Princess Satera. The King's fears are realised. Satera is abducted by a slimey character name of Banbo, who's working for the Dark Elf Pazort! Ooookdy, well now let's ask the Lovely Princess to jom us! WISE MOVE? Some hard fought battles later, our hero confronts Pazort in a nearby Temple. The Dark Elf has Satera at his whim. What will become of her...? Gramps asks the youngster to test his mettle by shoulder barging him as hard as he can. And ends up flat on his back! At the time of going to press, Sega Europe are unsure as to whether they shall release Shining Wisdom in the UK. Still, we think the game deserves mucho attention, and plan to present a thorough review next month. Ahh, Welcome, Princess Saterd! We are so glad that you could join us. 79 "

"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG BAD MOJO Developed by:DREW PICTURES Released by: ..........ACCLAIM Out ...APRIL '96 100% complete Saturn and PSX versions planned No other versions available PC CD-ROM Some things you don't want to find in your CD-ROM drawer. Cockroaches being among the worst at least they used to be. f you hate creepy crawlies, you're going to loath this game. Not that Bad Mojo is a poor piece of software, rather it relies solely on a cockroach to tell its tale. Brrr! Still, seeing as we eat cockroaches for breakfast here at Computer and Viseo Games we don't care! Enough moolah to rid himself of his badtempered landlord, and maybe travel the world the usual stuff. Hardly a moral thing to do, but then who could blame him? No doubt you would do the same thing in a similar situation. Well, maybe not after seeing the consequences... A long time ago, Roger's mother handed him a pendant. A charm if you like. Well, absolutely not so charming as it turns out. Sensing Roger's dishonesty, the pendant works a dreadful magic and transforms our hapless anti-hero into a 'roach! In this form Roger is cursed with travelling the long and roach-powder-ridden road to normality, hopefully learning some valuable lessons along the way. The terrifying truth here is that this rat isn't quite dead yet. As Roger discovers much to the disgust of one and all! Bad Mojo is an adventure game, granting players control of a cockroach searching for its true identity. Courtesy of a grim (but cool) cinematic intro, players already know the chilling answer: Happens this roach was once hard-up tenant Roger who stumbled across a fortune, contained in a suitcase, hidden beneath his bed. PEDIGREE ROACH PEST CONTROL As some indication of this game's quality, bear in mind that half the team responsible Drew Pictures produced the game Iron Helix in 1994, before amalgamating with Pulse in September last year. That game won the New Media \"Invision\" award, and the Software Publishing Association award for \"Best Strategy Game of the Year\". Drew Pictures began work on Bad Mojo in 1994, obviously fired-up after their amazing success! Roger's movement is horribly close to how a real creepy crawly behaves, and it's controlled simply by using the cursor keys as directionals. The general aim is to explore the dark depressing world that is Roger's flat, searching for clues poking around, keeping his wits about him. Approaching fellow cellar dwellers sometimes causes Rog' to be overcome by a psychedelic vision, giving clues to the path that lies ahead. In the main, however, progress is made by manipulating the distasteful physical objects that lie all around: cigarette butts, rat traps; rats; bug carcasses. Revolting stuff, basically. As the revolutionary game engine is 2D real-time, this means players can toy with just about anything in some way. INFESTATION Not that much difference between this guy Roger and a cockroach anyway! Near the start of the quest, Roger approaches this group of creeps to gleen some information... Strange, even tedious, though it may seem, Bad Mojo is disturbingly different to any thing you may have experienced before. The sharp, photo realistic visuals portray in too vivid detail the squalor which us humans unwittingly create about ourselves. The result is one big squirm from start to... well about as far as we've got at the momentmeaning the 'play' area is pretty vast too. Acclaim are toying with the idea of bringing Bad Mojo to the Saturn and PlayStation. Maybe that's taking it too far. Meanwhile those of you who own a PC should look forward to reading about Roger the roach's antics in more detail, next month. ...and receives this vision, in which a vacuum cleaner blasts Roger into another area of the flat. 7 81 "

Bizarre Creations and SIE are mightily proud of the system used to bring accurate, renditions of the F1 tracks to the PlayStation. Rather than laboriously handdesigning the polygon courses (as SIE did with Wipeout), the team have created their own track editor which allows them to splice track and scenery together at record speeds, thus ensuring that all 17 official F1 tracks will be ready for inclusion by the time the game launches in Summer. Each track is comprised of around 60,000 to 90,000 textured polygons and look uncannily like the real things. In fact, every major building, land-mark and advertising hoarding is present. The only notable omission is the lack of cigarette advertising on the trackside, but we're sure you could live, without that. A team of five people is responsible for this area of the game, alone, and they're constantly comparing their work with official FIA track stats and video tapes of Formula One races. The result is most impressive indeed. Look folks, it's Monte Carlo in wireframe form. Just wait until the details are laid on top.

Most emphasis is on the power-drift effects and 90 degree hand-brake turns. The Simulation mode takes you through the entire Grand Prix season and offers a radically different game, with simulated G-forces, \"proper\" response from your car, team tactics, and car customisation all playing a major part in your racing performance. This latter option is still very much an arcade game, but includes a lot of the realism you would expect from an officially licensed F1 product. 83 "

Everything to do with this game seems to happen at superspeed, so before it zooms right past us here's a close look at the actual Saturn version! For video game historians (when they exist in the year 3000AD), March 1996 will no doubt be known as 'The Month That PlayStation Games Were Converted Onto Saturn!\". However, as far as big names go, the most important PlayStation-to-Saturn conversion has to be Psygnosis' incredible futuristic racing game AURICOM Wipeout. The game was a sensation when it was first released, taking people's expectations of OIREX 32-bit gaming further than ever previously imagined. In fact, the success of the PlayStation's UK launch could well be attributed to this game alone, seeing as it sold virtually one-for-one with the machine during the PlayStation's FEISAR opening weekend. Of course, six months later, the Saturn version is unlikely to cause quite the same kind of mass hysteria. Nonetheless though, it's still a major title for the machine. Wipeout is still regarded as the PlayStation's best game and its conversion to the Sega machine is a definite boon for Saturn owners. Providing, of course, that the Saturn can deliver the goods.

"LETTERS in the Boy did we get on the wrong side of some people last month! A couple of points in favour of the Saturn, and the entire PlayStation fan base is up in arms, ready to chew our limbs off! Hopefully Paul's response to those 'hurting' readers will help clear the air. Just remember, we're a games mag not a hardware guide. Practically everyone has something cool to shout about this month. Few would argue that the scene has never looked brighter. By the way, we're opening up the letters pages as a forum for all the team. If there's something you want to take up personally with either of us, the writer or designer for that matter, will be happy to reply. Come on then! Write to: IN THE BAG, CVG, EMAP IMAGES, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON, ECIR 3AU Dear CVG. I am writing to tell you how extremely p****d off I am with your magazine. Over the past couple of issues you have gone on about how the Saturn is THE machine to own, and said that people who bought PlayStations were \"fashion-crippled\" and taken in by the hype. I have to completely disagree with you there because, if you remember, before Christmas you couldn't stop raving about the Sony machine, and advised many people to buy one as I did. It was you that was taken in by the hype, but many loyal readers took your advice. Now, just a month after Christmas, you are saying that the Saturn is better, and that people who bought PlayStations bought them because they were fashionable. Thanks a f*****g lot CVG. It doesn't matter to you though. You can be as fickle as you like because all your machines are provided free, so it doesn't hurt your pocket. Me, I spent over  on my PlayStation plus games, and now you're saying that the Saturn's better on the strength of three games. Very good games, but only three nonetheless. I have valued your opinions for over five years now, but when you tell us one thing as solidly as you did, and then change your mind a few months later (over Christmas of all times), you can't help but be more than a bit disillusioned and also extremely annoyed. I just hope that you are wrong about the Saturn, and that I haven't got a piece of useless grey plastic stuck by my tele. You'll probably say I'm jealous or whatever, but I just want an explanation as to why you seem to have jumped onto the Saturn bandwagon so quickly. Maybe it's because of three high-profile games. Maybe you've fallen into the hype trap once again. I did. I believed your hype of the PlayStation, and look where it got me. Anyway, despite what I've said, I still think your magazine is the best (if a little over excitable sometimes) and shall continue to buy it every month. Tim Waterworth, Harrogate SACRILEGE! Dear CVG, I am a great fan of your magazine and have bought it consistently through 1995. You have been a great help in introducing the 'next generation of console to the public with impartiality. However in recent months I believe you have started to show unfair bias toward Sega's wonder machine, the Saturn. You are saying that the Saturn will out sell the PlayStation because of three games. These games being Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop, and Sega Rally. This is a view believe is very short sighted. For a start, from what I have heard, the PlayStation has and may even be the best in their own already out sold the Saturn three to one. areas, but unlike SF2, they are not likely This is also reflected by the HMV all formats to have every video game company want chart (January issue 1996) where six to produce clones of each one. And after PlayStation titles are in the top twenty all these excellent games, what's next? chart, whereas there are no Saturn games There doesn't appear to be many amazin the top twenty. In the same editorial it is ing titles coming to the Saturn (although said that Street Fighter 2 sold the Super there are a few) and most of them are NES, and that the same is likely to happen being converted to PlayStation as well. with the three games you mentioned and However the PlayStation has a ready supthe Saturn. I think this is also untrue. For a ply of forthcoming titles, such as Heart of start, SF2 was a phenomena everybody Darkness, Magic Carpet, Loaded, and so wanted to play it, and more still everyone on. The Saturn can't boast this wanted to own it on some format. SF2 also kind of Software support. I'm not started a new era and inspired many other suggesting what 'next gen' companies to produce clones. After all, we machine people should buy, I am wouldn't have such games as Mortal just stating facts.

"LETTERS 1S 050 machines we have at home are not provided free. Of the 32-Bit systems, Jaime owns a PlayStation. Ed and myself have both. Admittedly skinflint Guise seems to have the switchable office Saturn on permanent loan! Point is we have no reason to favour one above the other. Great games are great games, and them's the breaks I'm afraid. But Sega Rally has, in no small way, boosted sales of the Saturn in the UK. (Paul) PAUSED bag 5TH Dear CVG, I've been reading CVG for some years now, along with thousands of other people, but I have to say that after reading the editorial by Paul Davies in the January edition many of those very same people may be having second thoughts about ever buying another issue again. After making clear his delights at three forthcoming Saturn Games MR EDITOR's exact words were \"I just pity those who couldn't hold their breath longer than September 29th\". You see, I have just spent almost  on a Sony PlayStation, and believe it or not MR EDITOR I was delighted to do so, with or without your pity. Full credit is due to Sega and the Saturn for three superb new games, but your remarks on \"pity\" were disgraceful, and a slap in the face for me and thousands of others who invested in Sony's incredible machine. Definitely not the sort of words I expect to read in CVG, a normally unbiased multi-format magazine. You probably won't publish this but I've said my piece. Martin Christie, Hamilton FATALITY IN PROGRESS Dear CVG, This isn't just a letter from another fan, this is a matter of life or death. When I last red the January issue of your fab' 'zine I was shocked. The blood started pumping through my veins faster than a comet ready to crash on the planet with the strongest gravity in the entire Universe (that's fast) when I read your little article about Saturn Mortal Kombat 3 being the Ultimate version. I've just bought a PlayStation with MK3 and now I'm just praying that you can help me with my question: Are there any plans for converting Ultimate MK3 to the PlayStation? If there are none, please place an article about this injustice and add the address of Williams or Midway or whoever so that all PS owners and any other people who don't agree with this can write them a letter 'cause if they don't I'll die a slow and very painful death. So please, help me. Thanks! CVG: Williams can be contacted at this Fax number: 001 312 267 8435. TM PlayStation IK RLE KMPE NÃK Geachte. Meneer,, Meurouw,, Ik heb onlangs het spec Mortal Kombat 3 aongeschaft. eta wekem oefenen heb ik eem paak codes gevenden bu: kool stof, kooler stf, sound test. Mym roiag is hoe ik op de begeouafplaats kan komenuechlen ps: lou ik aub eem antwooed teug kunnen ktygen met de code a.u.b. CVG: Thanks. And a big hello to everyone on Epsylon from all the staff at CVG! HOME FOR ABUSED CAT OWNERS Dear CVG, Please could you help a very disappointed Jaguar owner? First of all the main thing that drew me to buy the Jag was the advert which is in most games mags, which to me is now nothing more than hyped up false advertising, with no real physical support from Atari. I have had my Jag CD-ROM since mid October 1995. It came with three CDs, but only one playable game Blue Lightning. Once played soon forgotten, the game is just a Lynx game with lots of cosmetics. So from October 1995 to the present day I have not been able to by a CD game. If Atari have any intention to keep up with Sony and Sega, this is not the way. If the PlayStation and Saturn had been out for more than four months with just one game they would not have had the fantastic success they have today. No matter what anyone says, Jag cart games are rare and the CD games just do not exist. Atari promised a handful of CD games before Christmas '95. False! Atari promised good games. False! Most Jag games are simply 16-Bit conversions, and nothing new. There must be a law against this sort of thing. I'm just one Jaguar owner, there must be more people out there who Atari have disappointed. Jag owners are like starved dogs begging for food. When other dog owners, who prefer other brands, are well fed! Atari, please don't forget about the people who fill your pockets. Is the company that started it all now dying a slow and painful death at the expense of others? Please tell me, are Atari deaf, dumb, and blind they're stepping on the past, not going into the future. Dean Bamford, Bramley CVG: We know exactly how you feel, Dean! Unfortunately the future doesn't look like it's getting any better for the Jaguar let alone the CD unit. In its present situation we feel that the Jaguar is just about capable of holding Cult System status, with a few unique prizes. Jaguar owners may find it worthwhile hanging back on investing any more money in the less-than-phat cat until Atari turn things around. CVG: At no time have I or anyone else on the magazine stated that one machine is better than another. My reference to September 29th was aimed largely at the proportion of PlayStation customers who had given up on the Satum too soon, and bought something they believed to be the only credible option at the time  is too much money to chance on hardware perceived as second rate. As we all know by now, the Saturn can, has, and will continue to deliver what Sega originally promised. And only those who own a PlayStation just because it's a PlayStation will continue to dispute the fact the people I attacked for being \"fashion-crippled\". Of course! would hate to believe that anybody who reads CVG on a regular basis is guilty of being so lame, so I am happy to have been called to justice by Tim, Edward, and Martin. To finish I'd like to tell you that none of us here are in quite the lucrative position Tim supposes. The GAME FAN GOES SPARE Dear CVG, I am a proud owner of a 32x plus MegaCD, and I was wondering if you could tell me how much I would get if I sold it. have 21 games, two demos, four pads, 2 tips books, a disc cleaner kit, and a review guide. However, I don't have the boxes but I do have the instructions. Graham Auld, Glasgow. CVG: That's an enormous collection you have going for you Graham, and the list of titles you provided only makes my answer easier. Hang onto it all! You'd be crazy to get rid of it, for all the money you'd lose. If you're desperate to obtain a new system, assuming this is your situation, there are more cost-effective ways of getting results. 97 "
