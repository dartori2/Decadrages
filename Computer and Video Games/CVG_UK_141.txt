"MEET THE CVG CREW: SCHOOL GARTH I went on a dodgy holiday in an apartment in Italy that was rented for four but I went as an unofficial guest'. Unfortunately, one day whilst I was in the shower, the rep came round to \" say hello\". If she caught me there it was deportation for all of us so I had to climb out of the forth storey bathroom window and jump six feet across onto a balcony and then lie down so that she couldn't see me from the car park. Easy eh? Problem was I naked and opposite the balcony was a block of flats with everyone having their lunch. Lucky I'd brought my own lunchbox with me. PAUL Paul never goes on holiday anywhere nice but he was once, in Brighton with Whitta and we got back from a nightclub at 4.00am to the B&B and Paul said he wanted to go to a chip shop. Gary Whitta (who was trying to make the northern one sense), told him not to be a stupid northern get as there, wouldn't be anywhere open. Rand, in his slurred northern lilt told Whitta he'd damn well go on his own then, and turned around with flourish and marched off whilst telling Whitta over his shoulder what a crap mate he was. Unfortunately, as he walked out into the street a lamp post set about him and his crap mate Whitta had to drag his unconscious body to hospital! It's not often that anyone at school gets the chance to talk about computer games (especially as teachers believe computer games turn pupils' brains into semolina!) So imagine how completely gob-smacked the pupils of St Gregory's school in Brixton were when the CVG boys turned up at their school and asked them all about their favourite games. They were so pleased to see us it was almost embarrassing. It was nothing to do with the fact that they got off a particularly nasty looking maths lesson given by a particularly nasty looking maths teacher. Actually, most of the people we talked to actually liked their teachers. They'll like them even more now as we can tell them that it was their mentors that actually helped set up the CVG visit! Anyway, a great time was had by one and all as everyone told us all about themselves and what games they really liked playing and we agreed with them on almost everything they said, (apart from the bit about Garth being a really great guy and a really snazzy dreser), and even swapped some gamesplaying tips. We just about talked about games for ages (well, until the maths period was over anyway and then they threw us out. Here's what games they're all playing... GARY I was at Butlins with a bunch of mates but unfortunately we attracted rather a lot of complaints about noise. At 4 o'clock in the morning 20 guys from Sega came around to my door and started shouting, \"Gary Whitta Whitta Stinker\" and eventually broke open the door and attacked me with wet towels. Unfortunately a Butlins security man had been dis patched to the scene and came in and started having a right go at us about keeping the noise down. We all sat there looking really sorry and apologetic and thought we d cracked it until one bright spark from Sega with half a football on his head said, \"Listen. Don't you like my hat?\" The guy exploded and threw us all out! SNES Jemima Wilson As a 13 year old girl, she collects sequins but don't take her too lightly her keen diet of McDonalds hamburgers has given her edge when she beots the meat at Streetfighter! GAMEBOY Kelly Maggs Tetris is deod popular games with girls and Kelly is no exception. She's olso got a Nintendo console but spends her spare time with her best Boy friend Pretty good she is too! COCCOCO STEVE Steve's NEVER been sad enough to go to Butlins but he once went on tour round Britain for almost a year! I was managing this band mahn.\" says CVG's number one rocker \"and we were all living in the back of a transit van, gigging by night and sunbathing by day. It was babe-tastic man, until one evening when I was in the back of the van moving at high speed and the driver unexpectedly slammed on the brakes. Me and this really beefy bloke called Dozer were, slung forward at high speed to the front of the transit, Unfortunately I landed first closely followed by the 18 stone blubber gullet and half of Mr. Marshal's finest! Could have been worse though, Whitta could have been in the back too! M. BISON 120 LINES SNES Shone Baptista Shane o bit of a SNES king or so he says. He's reckons that his high score is octually real. We think that he's telling the truth. Which is sod 'cos it's o really crop score SNES Stosis Anostosiou Thirteen year-old Stasis says he's really clever and a great footballer. If he was really clever, he'd know better than to put down such a crop high score of SF2! He beat Shane though! ANGLIN Whilst on holiday with his pal, who shall remain nameless, (yeah, I wouldn't want to embarrass Ryan as well Paul). they popped into the room of a few luverrly ladies for a quick chat who were supposed to be tucked up in bed at 10:30pm When a patrol came round to check the girlies were in bed, the two young lads jumped into the cupboard (seriously until they had gone. Two hours later, after several visits from the patrol and several evading jumps into the cupboard, our hapless young fools realised they had been rumbled and had to make a run for it, before they got locked out of their hotel. They waited 'till the coast was clear, and then made a desperate dash out of the door and straight in to the burly body of a rather large teach from the school of said girlies! 400,000 500,000 MEGADRIVE Mairead Concannon Moirheod's thrown away all her sexually stereotypical dolls and installed a Megadrive in her bedroom. Her favourite game is Sonic and she's never tried to dress him up either. SNES Tanya Cameron Long-haired and pretty, Tonyo finds time off her hectic social schedule to sit down for a really good romp with Super Mario every now and then. And boy can she play! He's an adventurous sort our Jon and was on holiday in the Sahara Desert in two jeeps. The two cars stopped at an oasis so that Jon could potter off with a spade and do that thing in the sand that only a man suffering with the \"squits\" can do. Unfortunately, as soon as Jon had dug his hole and exposed his bum to world, a load of wild camels muscled over and started spitting and kicking around him. \"It was ter rible. I couldn't run away because they caught me with my trousers down. By the time I got back to the Jeep I was coered in warm camel flob! Auuurrrrgh! 302,106 300,760 GAME GEAR Damien Burke With two cots romping around and ripping up the furniture, Domien has to play games on the move.

GAMEBOY Lydio Szydlowski Consoles and computer games arent Lydio's favourite postime hurroh!) but she's still plays with her Boy when she's bored. She may not be a top console addict but she's top with us. JULIE We found recently that ex-new girl Julie is not as shy as we first thought! At a recent holiday, she spent a whole week sunbathing on a topless beach. During a quick dip, she espied a girl walking off the beach with her bag. She ran up the beach and chased after her as she disappeared into a crowded shopping precinct but eventually caught her in shop. Imagine her embarrassment when she confronted her and found out that it was an identical bag to her own. Embarrassing eh? Not as embarrassing as suddenly realis ing that you're topless, standing in the middle of a crowded shop and miles from your bra! 45.200 SUPERMARIO 3 COMPLETED "


"NEIST The revival of an 8-bit classic on Super NES... a space-age challenge for chess fans... two new hotshots for SNES near completion... programmable pads for the 90s.... and we introduce the most benevolent superhero in the galaxy... LOHM KNOW HMV-KNOW OAMES IMPOSSIBLE MISSION ON SUPER NES! ALL FORMATS CHART o, you're not dreaming. One of the all-time classic computer games is on its way to the Super Nintendo courtesy of Microprose. The Commodore 64 original from 1984 is still one of the best-loved platform games on any format, and one of the most ground-breaking it was using rotoscoped character animation long before new-fangled games like Flashback were even a twinkle in Delphine's eye. The really good news is that the SNES version entitled Impossible Mission: The 90s Remix is actually two games in one. Not only is there an all-new updated 16-bit version (complete with new characters, powerups, end-of-level baddies, etc), but also a completely authentic not-changed-in-any-way-at-all carbon copy of the 8-bit original, with all the same game maps, graphics and speech! The CVG crew had a quick play of an early preview version this month and it was a real trip down memory lane. Aah, those were the days... Impossible Mission: The 90s Remix is due out on SNES this Christmas. We can't wait! 1 STARWING (Super NES/Nintendo) 2 FLASHBACK (Megadrive/US Gold) 3 GRAHAM GOOCH'S WORLD CLASS CRICKET (Amiga/Audiogenic) 4 CHAMPIONSHIP MANAGER 93 (Amiga/Domark) 5 FLASHBACK (Amiga/US Gold) 6 SUPER KICK OFF (Megadrive/US Gold) 7 SUPER STAR WARS (Super NES/JVC) 8 PREMIER MANAGER (PC/Gremlin) 9 FATAL FURY (Megadrive/Sega) 10 ZOOL (PC/Gremlin) 11 TINY TOONS (Super NES/Konami) 12 ALIEN 3 (Super NES/Acclaim) 13 WAR IN THE GULF (Amigo/Empire) 14 STRIKE COMMANDER (PC/Origin) 15 X-WING (PC/LucasArts) 16 DESERT STRIKE (Amigo/Electronic Arts) 17 PGA TOUR GOLF 2 (Megadrive/Electronic Arts) 18 ARABIAN NIGHTS (Amigo/Krisalis) 19 WAR IN THE GULF (PC/Empire) 20 WWF ROYAL RUMBLE (Super NES/Acclaim) Ah, those were the days. Impossible Mission has been recreated flawlessly on Super NES. The more upmarket 90s remix should, with any luck, retain the original's playability. Let's hope so! GAG SPOT! Every month from now on, we'll be giving over a Whitfa's World slot to the CVG crew's fave jokes of the month. So, without further ado... RANDY: Why wouldn't the crab share his sweets? Because he was shellfish. ANGLIN: There are these two fish in a tank. One says to the other, \"how do you drive this thing?\" WHITTA: Why did the biscuit cry? Because his mother was a wafer so long.(hmm Ed) GARTH: Garth doesn't know any gags, because he's not funny. STEVE: What did one house say to the other? Nothing, houses can't talk, silly. JON: A bloke goes into the doctor's and says \"Doctor Doctor, what can I take for kleptomania?\" (Ho bloody ho Ed) JULIE: What do you do if you see a space man? Jump in it, man. (Oh dear Ed) "


"JEDI KNIGHTS HURRY UP AND READ THIS the thing about big film tie-ins is that they always seem to be action games, don't they? And this gets a bit dull after a while, so Star Wars fans who have been swamped by an avalanche of action-packed licences will be pleased to hear that there's a rather more intellectual adaptation of their favourite movie on the horizon. Star Wars Chess (or, to give it its full name, The Software Toolworks' Star Wars Chess) is... well, it's just that, really. Mindscape has taken its The incredibly exciting Software Toolworks' Star Wars Chess! famous Chessmaster game engine and sent it back to a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. So now, rather than the boring old rooks and pawns, you have Luke Skywalker and his rebel chums battling against Darth Vader and his imperial forces. There are 72 animated battle scenes for when one piece captures another, so expect plenty of light sabre fights and what have you. Out on PC soon. \"My sword!\" Vivid Image's oriental battler is at last ready for its SNES release. an't stop, got to run. Just got time to print a couple of pics of two new SNES games that came into the office just minutes before deadline. First Samurai from Kemco (converted from the Amiga original) is finally finished, while Super Air Diver (or SAD for short) from SunSoft uses a Nintendo accelerator chip (not the Super FX, though) to speed up the Mode 7 aerial arcade action as you fly missions over futuristic cities. We'll be reviewing both next month. Ah, there goes the last train... SAY HELLO TO... CAPTAIN CARTRIDGE long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... there was a planet called Blag-o, a serene and peaceful place where there was no money and everything was free. But Blag-o was destroyed in a freak collision with the sun, and everyone was killed. Everyone, however, except a young child called Free-B, who was hurled into space by the explosion and crash-landed on Earth some years later. Growing up on our little bluegreen planet, Free-B couldn't help but notice how brilliant our video games were, but was apalled at how much they cost. So, using his space-age super powers, Free-B decided to champion the causes of the poor and the needy everywhere. He became Captain Cartridge, and now he's linked up with CVG to bring software joy to the world. The mission of Captain Cartridge is to provide free games to anyone who, through poverty or misfortune, cannot afford to enjoy a bit of software fun like everybody deserves to. So, if you have a particularly sorry tale to tell, send it in to Captain Cartridge and, if it plucks at his heartstrings, he may well sort you out. But remember! Captain Cartridge only helps genuine cases and dislikes nothing more than greedy little boys and girls, so don't go trying it on. Send your begging letters to CAPTAIN CARTRIDGE, Planet CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU, and look out for the Captain's first instalment next issue. Jeez, this is fast! Not the screenshot of course, that's completely still. We mean the game itself, which set off police radar traps for miles around when we booted it up. NB: Any similarity between CVG's Captain Cartridge and Sergeant Software, who used to appear in our sister magazine The One, is entirely coincidental. Honest. LEARN TO PROGRAM ardly a month goes by these days without some company bringing out a \"revolutionary\" new joypad with a list of pointless features as long as your arm. We wouldn't want to let you down this month with our traditional piece of controller news, especially as this latest batch of add-ons is actually quite good. Spectravideo's SN programmable joypad and joystick uses a new \"digital action learning system\" which means you can teach them sequences of moves. So, you can program in all your favourite Street Fighter special moves and execute them at the touch a single button. Smart, eh? With six different memories, 30 pre-programmed moves, battery back-up and all the usual slomo/autofire features, these look like the business. But don't take our word for it just yet we'll be roadtesting them both in a special gizmos feature next month. In the meantime, the Program Pad and Program Stick will be available from September at .99 and .99. "


"NEWS FIT SISTER ly Stallone plays Judge Dredd on big and small screens soon... not one but TWO chances to blag some free software... and all the latest goss from the rough and tumble world of computer and video gaming... alling all you gamesplaying guys!

All you have to do is send in a snap of your lovely sis we don't want any nudey or dirty ones of course, oh no heaven forbid, just something nice and pretty to brighten up our day when we trawl in depressed in the morning.

QUICK NOTES onsidering we only invented the Spot the Shot comp as an easy way to fill up a bit of space, it's been a tremendous success apparently the idea of winning  of software is just too much for you greedy little trouser stains to resist. So we'll just have to keep doing it, we suppose. This month's shot is, as usual, a piccy from one of this month's featured games that's been given a good going-over by the CVG \"firm\" to render it almost unrecognisable. Using your skill and judgement, can you tell us what game it's from? If so, bung your answer in the post to SPOT THE SHOT 3, CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. And remember you've got to be in it to win it! SEGA has admitted that it has developed a 32-bit console known as the Saturn, which is intended to take over from the Megadrive this, presumably is the «Gigadrive\" that everyone's been talking about for yonks. Unfortunately, due to pricing problems, Sega is unlikely to release the new machine until it's possible to sell it cheaply enough, and that could mean a very long wait, maybe until the year after next... ALTHOUGH it still hasn't unveiled it, Atari has finally released details of its new 64-bit superconsole, the Jaguar, to be released next year. According to Atari, the cartridge-based system will have 16 million colors, a RISC processor, 16-bit CDquality stereo sound and a host of other features all for $200 (around )! The first \"MegaCart\" games to be released include Cybermorph, Alien vs Predator and Jaguar Formula One Racing. More news as it comes in... STALLONE IS JUDGE DREDD NKNOH GAMES SNES CHART OU were excited to read about Microprose's all-new version of Impossible Mission on SNES in this month's news, you'll probably get even more moist when we tell you that the company is also planning new versions of some of its old faves, including F-19 Stealth Fighter (Megadrive), Airborne Ranger and Solo Flight 2 (both SNES). Airborne Ranger and Solo Flight are due early next year, with F-19 pencilled in for Summer 94... fter over a year of rumour and speculation, it's finally been confirmed that Sylvester Stallone is to play Judge Dredd in a new multi-million dollar movie and the official games are already in the pipeline! Fresh from his hit with Cliffhanger, the man Stallone will be donning the famous helmet and patrolling the seamy streets of Mega City One in the movie, written by Terminator 2 co-author William Wisher and out here next He is the year. We've heard a law and rumour that Sony has he's coming already picked up the to the big console rights, but it's screen at not confirmed yet. Mind the end of you, we were right about next year. Sensible Soccer... SEGA has finally given way to media pressure and set up an age rating system for its games in America, at least. As of this month, all American Sega-produced carts will carry one of three classifications. There's \"GA\" (for general audiences), \"MA-13\" (for mature audiences) and \"MA-17\" (for adults not appropriate for minors). We'll have to wait and see if the system finds its way over here... 1 STARWING (Nintendo) 2 SUPER STAR WARS (JVC) 3 TINY TOONS (Konami) 4 ALIEN 3 (Acclaim) 5 WWF ROYAL RUMBLE (Acclaim) 6 PUGSLEY'S SCAVENGER HUNT (Ocean) 7 AGURI SUZUKI (Nintendo) 8 JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL 93 (Electronic Arts) 9 WING COMMANDER (Mindscape) 10 MICKEY'S MAGICAL QUEST (Nintendo) DID YOU KNOW there's a real New York plumber called Mario?

"INEUSE A SONGS CCLAIM and James Cameron get in bed together... make your own SONIC chilli dog... and JURASSIC PARK in comic-book form... IT'S A SONIC EXPLOSION ACCLAIM GOES DOWN A STORM! EDGEHUS n one of the biggest licence deals of the year, Acclaim has tied up the video game rights to all of blockbuster director James Cameron's future movies. The deal between Acclaim, who've already had a hit with Terminator 2 on consoles, and Cameron's company Lightstorm Entertainment means that the two companies will work together on the game licences right from the storyboard stage, with the software developers having access to the movie sets during filming. The first film to be covered by the new deal is Cameron's next project True Lies, which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a nuclear weapons expert caught up in a government conspiracy. It's tipped as the big Summer blockbuster for next year, and following that is the official Spiderman movie, which Cameron is also directing. \"After our terrific success with T2, we're thrilled to be back in business with Acclaim,\" says Cameron.

Fans of those tacky old Steve Jackson adventure gamebooks (if you want to fight the skeleton monster men turn to page 43 etc) will be pleased to hear that Sonic has got in on the act with two \"interactive novels\" loosely based on his on-screen adventures.

"SWEET HOME CHICACO ... home, as ever, to the International Summer Consumer Electronics Show or CES for short. Every year the cream of the industry gathers here in June for the biggest video games exhibition in the WORLD to unveil their hottest new games and hardware, and 1993 was no exception. CVG's Gary Whitta was in town for the week to find out what's going to be setting your screens alight in '94 and beyond. This is what he eventually staggered back into the office with... NINTENDO hicago! What a town! Home of blues music, the world's tallest building, Michael Jordan... and the Summer CES, the hottest date in the games industry's calendar and not just because it's in June. If you've ever been to a computer show in the UK and been impressed, think again. In typical American tradition, the CES is bigger. bold. er and badder than any games expo in Britain or anywhere else in the world. Everyone comes out to play in the Summer sun at CES, from the big boys of Nintendo and Sega to the smaller independent companies and developers, each with their latest wares to show off. In fact the CES isn't just about games it's an all-round electronics show, where you can check out everything from the latest widescreen TVs to portable Minidisc sound systems but it's in the games hall that the real action's to be found, not just with new games but also the latest systems, add-ons and all kinds of other fun stuff. Only in America, as they say. So, join me now as we voyage through the electronic jungle of the CES and sort the wheat from the chaff of what was on display... It's a CES tradition that the Mario giants always dominate the show rather than just erecting a regular stand, Nintendo takes up a whole \"area\" that swallows up about a quarter of the entire show. When you hear about the World of Nintendowell, this is about as close as it gets, with every new product on show here. backed up by some stunning special events (like a mega laser show inside a giant dome) to drive the message home. The star of Nintendo's show this year was undoubtedly FX TRAX, the second game to use the amazing Super FX accelarator chip. On show for the first time ever here, it's a 3D racing game that promises to push the SFX even further than its predecessor Starwing. Enhancements have been made to the chip to make it even more powerful, and players will be able to get to grips with it this Christmas. Unfortunately Nintendo were being very secretive about it, and weren't allowing journos to take pictures of the screen as the game's only 40% complete. That didn't stop CVG sneaking back with a few piccies, though. Would you believe that over the last ten years, Nintendo has sold over 100 MILLION Mario games? No, neither would we, but it's true and the company was celebrating in style with the announcement of a whole new range of Mariorelated titles. Later in the year, look out for MARIO AND WARIO, a Lemmings-style puzzle game that pits our hero against his latest adversary. After Wario drops a bucket The chief Goomba from on Mario's head, the Italian plumber has to the Super Mario Bros. stumble through 100 perilous levels, guided movie made a guest by a little angel that you control with the new appearance on Nintendo mouse. Like Mario Paint, the game Nintendo's stand! comes bundled with the mouse and is released in the US this September. It looks "


"SEGA SUPER MARIO If Nintendo's proud of its reputation for having the biggest presence at the CES, it'd better watch out Sega is hot on its tail. This year's show saw the Sonic team's most elaborate stand yet to enter it, you had to pass through the gigantic 20-foot wooden gates from Jurassic Park, where one of the movie's Ford Explorer trucks was also parked. SEGA JURAS PARK (Above) The giant Jurassic Park gates open up to reveal the goodies on show in the Sega village. smart. And if you're a Wario fan and have a Game Boy, you can look forward to WARIO LAND, the third Super Mario game for the Boy, this time casting you as the bad guy it's out here next year. Nintendo weren't giving out cartridges at the show, but if we could have brought any one game back with us, it would undoubtedly be I Most popular game of the show this year? Probably. SUPER MARIO ALLSTARS. \"It's a Mario party and everyone's invited» says Nintendo about a game that's already got everyone in the CVG office drooling with excitement. Basically, Super Mario All-Stars is a \"greatest hits\" compilation of all your favourite Mario games from the NES, upgraded for the Super NES and rolled into one cartridge. After slotting in the cart. choose from the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros 2 or Super Mario Bros 3 the games are the same, but the graphics have been updated to 16-bit standards, so they look and sound great for the FXTrax is already looking like an SFX stunner. 90s. And, as a special bonus, the cart also features Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels, a game that was previously only ever released in the Japan and never available for SNES before. With a battery backup for all the games like the one used in Mario World, this is really hot stuff, and us CVG nostalgia fans can't wait. Fortunately we won't have to wait long, as it's released in the US next month and here before The all-new Mario 3 from SM All-Stars. the end of the year. Yum. (Left) Cor, it's an actual Ford Explorer from the movie! Not the one smashed up by the T-Rex, of course. Nintendo was also using the show as a springboard for a whole host of Super Scope games, including the very pretty YOSHI'S SAFARI, a Mode-7 fest that has you, as Mario, riding on Yoshi's back and taking potshots at the baddies that fly towards you over 12 levels. Don't shoot Yoshi! Scopefans also have BATTLE CLASH II to look forward to, a two-player shoot 'em up with one player using the joypad to play the bad guy. Other big announcements from Nintendo included the long-awaited arrival of LEGEND OF ZELDA on the Game Boy and a totally new, remodelled NES. Scaled down in size and price, the restyled 8-bit control deck is sleeker, sexier and much smaller not much bigger than your average NES cartridge, in fact. The new system will retail for as little at $50 (around ), which should breathe some new life into the old warhorse. Oh, and there's also something called TETRIS 2 coming out for the NES as well. 3-294 PPPPPPP Mario and Wario packaged with a mouse! Don't know what that's all about. G The game, on Megadrive and Mega-CD, was the software centrepiece of the Sega stand it's totally different to Ocean's Nintendo and floppy versions. On Megadrive it's a side-on platform thing where you can choose to play either Alan Grant or a Velociraptor out to escape from the park, while the Mega-CD is more a graphic adventure type thing. Sega was showing off all kinds of new products, but by far the most important of them all was the much-hyped Virtual Reality headset for the Megadrive SEGA VR, being shown to the trade for the first time ever here. Set to retail at under $200 (around ) and featuring 3D sterescopic vision and surround sound, the VR glasses dominated Sega's stand, with a giant video wall and live presentations showing off their capabilities. Due to launch in the US in December, Sega VR comes bundled with a game called Nuclear Rush, in which the player pilots a hovercraft against an army of robots. Three more games Iron Hammer, Matrix Runner and Outlaw Racing will also be released to support the system, with even more titles due in '94. \"Beyond state-of-the-art or hightech, Sega VR is new-tech that makes a quantum leap into the highest level of gaming\" says Sega, and having seen the prototype headset in action, we reckon they could be right. Look out for the UK launch of the system next year. Megadrive Jurassic Park more on page 112. 113 D 1 13 11 Nintendo's NFL Stanley Cup was by far one of the most impressive in-game devs on display, using Mode 7 background graphics to produce some stunning slapshot action. Look out for this one at the end of the year. Sega VR comes in at under $200, and is obviously so amazing to play that it's turned this unfortunate playtester into a plastic mannequin! Or maybe it's just Steve after a big night out. 15 "


"Bounty Hunter one of the first games for Sega's bizarre Activator controller, And talking of mind-blowing, no-one walked away from the demonstration of Sega's new 32-bit graphics technology for the arcades without being amazed. We're talking supercomputer-quality graphics here, running in a demo of a forthcoming Daytona rallycar race game that looks light years ahead of any graphics currently available in the arcades. You have to see it to believe it, but that might not be until next year.. And let's not forget the biggest Sega star of them all, Sonic the Hedgehog. There's no sign of Sonic 3 as yet, but the hero hedgehog IS starring in two new games for Megadrive and Game Gear. On Megadrive there's SONIC SPINBALL, inspired by Sonic 2's Casino world and putting the player through a mix of familiar platform action and arcade pinball fun, while Game Gear owners get SONIC CHAOS which teams up Sonic and Tails once more with two modes of play you can choose a platform game as Sonic, or become Tails and go flying for some aerial action. Both new Sonics are due out later in the year. Do you really think you parents are goint to tolerate this kind of thing in their house? ADVENTURES THEDGEHOG Sega was also proudly displaying another piece of new Megadrive hardware the ACTIVATOR is an octagonal electronic hula-hoop you hook up to your console, place on the floor and stand in the middle of. Armed with sensors around its perimeter, the Activator is controlled by the player's actual kicks, punches and other actions. You look a bit of a wally when using it, though. It's coming bundled with two games called Bounty Hunter and Air Drums, a \"magic\" drumkit that allows you to bash away at thin air to play ear-popping solos. The price? Just $79.99 (around ) and the good news is that the Activator will work with all old Megadrive games as well, and future titles are being designed specifically with the strange add-on in mind. One such game is ETERNAL CHAMPIONS, a one-on-one martial arts title that Sega is hyping as its answer to Street Fighter 11 and with rumours about CapCom's Champion Edition perhaps never appearing, they'll need one. With over 35 combat moves, 11 fighters from throughout history and features like slow-motion replay all packed into a massive 24Mb Eternal Champions all 24Megs of it! cartridge, Eternal Champions is shaping up to be a serious SELL/Mortal Kombat contender. You'll need either a six-button joy ther a six-button joypad or the new Activator to get the best out of it, though. The biggest jaw-droppers on the whole Sega stand, though, were two new driving games. The amazing 3D coin-op VIRTUA RACING is coming to the Megadrive, using Sega's new DSP chip (their equivalent of the Super FX) and it looks AMAZING. The early version on show here was almost identical to the arcade original! It's not due out in the US until Christmas, but if the finished version looks anything like the work-inprogress we saw, it'll blow your mind. ACCLAIM The point that Acclaim were making at this year's CES could be summed up in two words MORTAL KOMBAT. Yes, the game that's (probably) going to be the biggest title of 1993 ruled the roost here, with all formats (including some very impressive Super NES and Game Gear versions) on display, backed up by a 20-ft Mortal Kombat model with smoke coming out of it and a video wall displaying Acclaim's much talked about TV ad for the game. Check it out when it hits TV screens over here this month it's awesome. In fact it's so cool that the pose the teenage stars of the advert adopt (basically holding your fists in the the air and screaming \"Mortal Kombat\" at the top of your voice) has become the latest dance trend in Chicago nightclubs! Trust us, this is going to be big. TIME POSITION LAP 1 TOTAL TIME 0'1146 52 2ND / 4 INBA Jam on Super NES is looking good. At the time of the show, the NBA Basketball playoffs were nearing their end, with the local Chicago Bulls making it to the finals. So it seemed as though everyone had a basketball game to show off but Acclaim scooped the lot with its signing of NBA JAM, the latest Midway coin-op that uses the same graphics techniques as Mortal Kombat (designed by the same team). The signing of this big-name licence was announced for the first time here, but console versions are SPEED 528 m/h BEGINHER Sega's Virtua Racing the Megadrive version is AMAZING! NFL Quarterback Club. Better than Madden? "


"09-887 -T FOIET UP OK courier delivering packages through deadly futuristic cities), along with a trio of original titles such as the 3D space shoot 'em up SHOCKWAVE, the strategic WORLDBUILDERS INC, and TWISTED, a freakish game show simulation. As with most games at CES, you'll see these by Christmas or just after. EA's 2020 Super Baseballl (Megadrive) already well underway, on display and looking very nice indeed. Out in the Fall (that's Autumn to you and me). Continuing the sports theme, Acclaim has also signed up 10 of the NFL's top American Football stars for NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB. hyped as \"better than Madden\", and announced a new series of WWF tie-ins for every format from Game Boy to Mega-CD-look out for KING OF THE RING (NES. Game Boy). STEEL CAGE CHALLENGE (NES. Game Gear). SUPERSTARS 2 (Game Boy) and the big one. RAGE IN THE CAGE on Mega-CD, coming your way soon. Our personal favourite Acclaim tie-in, however, has to be THE ITCHY AND SCRATCHY SHOW. It's the latest in a long line of Simpsons licences, this time centering on the exploits of Bart's favourite cat-and-mouse cartoon team in an ultra-violent spoof of Tom and Jerry. It's still early in development but already looking good, and Game Boy owners get an extra boost with a second game Itchy and Scratchy Teed Off, a miniature golf sim in which Scratchy (the cat) must complete nine holes before Itchy (the mouse) can take away all of his The Itchy and Scratchy Show (Super NES) nine lives. still earpoof of team in It's good to see that, even with all this CD and console stuff in development, EA isn't ignoring the floppy side. Bullfrog's long-awaited SYNDICATE led the way at the show on PC and Amiga, while affiliate label Origin was showing off WING COMMANDER ACADEMY and PRIVATEER on PC. Players get taken through the gruelling paces of the Terran fleet's training program, and can also design their own missions in Academy, while Privateer is a more Elite-style thing with you cast as a mercenary scraping a living off the Human-Kilrathi war. SHADOWCASTER's another one to look out for, promising to take the 3D RPG genre pioneered by Ultima Underworld one step forward. The 3D routine on display at the show was a real stunner, and the finished game should go down a storm with Dungeons & Dragons fans when it's released this Autumn. QUE ELECTRONIC ARTS OVER EA basketball action in Bulls vs Suns. For Chess freaks, Kasaporv's Gambit (PC) The Golden Joystick Software House of the Year had plenty of new stuff on show, with the EA Sports range and a host of games for the new 3DO system leading the way. FREE It was only a matter of time before it happened, but JOHN MADDEN '94 is well and truly on the way. Don't groan just yet though, this is more than just an update of the previous games. The old graphics engine has been torn out and a new one installed to produce a closer, lower-to-the-ground player perspective, giving it a totally different look to the old Madden titles. And, of course, there are loads of new teams, options and an official NFL licence that means you'll be seeing the famous logo everywhere. NHL HOCKEY is also back for '94, this time combining both the major hockey associations (the NHL and NHLPA) for extra teams, tournaments and features. Also included are more realistic fans (ie they get into fights as well as the players) and music digitised from a real hockey arena. SONY Check out all those tasty film props on display! 990A Spooky goings-on in The Haunting. The next big game for '93, though, is EA SPORTS SOCCER. Can the Americans crack the secret of computer football? Maybe; this game uses a unique 3D isometric viewpoint to convey the action, and on the basis of the trial play that CVG had, it feels as good as it looks. Keep your eyes peeled for  more on this one in a future issue. Aside from the sporting titles, EA took the wraps off THE HAUNTING, a 3D arcade adventure in which the player, as an irritable spook, has to scare the human inhabitants out of his house (a bit like in Beetlejuice), MUTANT LEAGUE HOCKEY, the two-player hack 'em up BLADES OF VENGEANCE and 2020 SUPER BASEBALL, converted from the Neo Geo original. All four are on Megadrive and coming at ya after the Summer As one of the major partners in league with the 3DO Company, EA already has a whole line-up of products ready to go for the revolutionary multimedia machine, most of them conversions of old favourites. Games like JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL, PGA TOUR GOLF and ROAD RASH are all nearing completion and looking excellent in the new Road Rash, you play a motorcycle With plenty of bigscreen licences tied up for this Summer and beyond, Sony went for a movie motif at the show, erecting a giant \"NOW PLAYING' sign on its stand to create the cinematic atmosphere. And there was no confusion about what was the company's premier product on display LAST ACTION HERO. Schwarzenegger's Summer blockbuster is previewed exclusively elsewhere in this issue, so we won't go into too much detail here. Better to talk about CLIFFHANGER, another big Summer movie and being brought to all formats by Sony, with the Mega-CD version due to Cliffhanger (Megadrive) arrive first, this Autumn. Sly's mountaintop adventure is looking particularly good on Megadrive, along with Bram Stoker's DRACULA. Sony also announced that it's signed up the No. 1 US TV game show WHEEL OF FORTUNE (a personal appearance by sexy co-host Vanna White almost stopped the show) and the crusty old sci-fi movie JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH. Both are due out at the end of the year. ESPN Baseball (Super NES) Sports fans will be pleased to hear that Sony has also signed up with ESPN, America's top TV sports channel to bring ESPN BASEBALL TONIGHT and ESPN SUNDAY NIGHT NFL to the Megadrive, Mega-CD and Super NES. ESPN anchorman Chris Berman (the American version of Des Lynam) has been drafted in to appear in and provide the commentary for both ESPN Football (Super NES) games, due at Christmas. There was also a special treat at the stand for movie fans memorabilia collected from Sony's various licences was on display, including costumes from Last Action Hero and Dracula, climbing ropes from Cliffhanger and even a section of the Wheel of Fortune itself! Mutant League Hockey (Megadrive) ed Blades of Vengeance (Megadrive) "


"VIRGIN and DeForest Kelley. Also looking good was STONEKEEP, the latest in a long line of 3D RPGs in the Ultima Underworld style. It sounds a treat and looks good, too. Frodo's your main main in Lord of the Rings. Like Sony with Last Action Hero, one game dominated Virgin's presence at the CES Disney's ALADDIN for the Megadrive. At a $250,000 breakfast launch hosted by Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, Virgin announced its signing of the most successful animated movie ever made, which stars Robin Williams as the voice of Disney's Aladdin is a joy to look at. the genie. Both movie and game are due to be launched in the UK at the end of the year, and the sneak previews wowed many a passing punter at the stand the developers have gone to pains to recreate the movie's beautiful animation, and the result looks great. Other big-name titles on show included another Disney licence in the form of THE JUNGLE BOOK (looks v.nice), the Megadrive version of ROBOCOP VS TERMINATOR and the Sylvester Stallone licence DEMOLITION MAN, the company's first game for the 3DO. Richard Branson stopped by for a few minutes to sample some of the games, and since Virgin has the Cool Spot 7-Up licence, gallons of the fizzy stuff was being given out free, which made the stand one of the most popular with sweaty show-goers. No amount of drink could make us interested in THE MODERN BRIDE WEDDING PLANNER on PC, You have to see this stuff to believe it (Megadrive) though. Yawn. Skeletal scares in Stonekeep (PC) Star Trek 2: Judgment Rites (PC) ACCOLADE INTERPLAY There was plenty being shown off here so much so, in fact, that the company had two stands, one for the floppy formats and one for the consoles. The jewel in the crown was CLAY FIGHTER, a comical Street Fighter-style beat 'em up using fighter sprites digitised from claymation models you know, like the ones in the California Raisins ad. Players have to take on a string of baddies, including a fat Opera singer, Elvis and Bad Mr Frosty, a manic snowman. Featuring the largest sprites ever seen in a SNES game (or so Interplay claims), Clay Fighter looks like a dream, but you'll have to wait until Christmas to see how well it plays. Also on show for SNES fans was CLAYMATES which, as the title suggests, also uses digitised clay animation, this time for a platform romp where the player controls a putty blob capable of changing its shape and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, which uses the Nintendo mouse to move your character around Tolkein's scrolling RPG world. PC bods got to feast their eyes on STAR TREK: JUDGMENT RITES, the sequel to the original 25th Anniversary game featuring eight new missions, and an enhanced CDROM version of 25th Anniversary featuring sampled dialogue from William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy A very sporty feel over at Planet Accolade well, the company has just signed up a galaxy of top sporting stars, after all. Top of the list is Brazilian footballing legend PELE, who's lent his name to Accolade's new soccer sim and even made a quick appearance on the Accolade stand to sign autographs. What a guy! The game's not looking bad either, using a similar isometric viewpoint to EA Soccer and featuring 40 European and Latin American clubs, including Pele's invincible 1962 Brazilian World Cup side. Pele apparently helped design the game (hmm), and pops up during play as the coach. Megadrive and Super NES versions will be available for Christmas, Accolade reckons. Yet more hockey action is due in the Autumn courtesy of BRET HULL HOCKEY on the SNES and Megadrive, which uses an impressive-looking \"behind the player\" 3D view, and the company has also signed up the NBA's most valuable player, Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns, to a multi-product deal, so expect plenty of Barkleyendorsed Basketball games to start Accolade's Speed Racer (PC) arriving at the end of the year. There was also plenty of BUBSYrelated activity. Accolade is hyping izo... 02:51...20 its feline superhero hard, and not only unveiled the Megadrive version of the game (basically a carbon copy of the SNES), but also announced that Bubsy is soon to appear in his own TV cartoon special in the US. The Bubsy Bobcat show gets its first airing over Thanksgiving Day weekend, but will it be coming over here? Keep Brett Hull Hockey (Super NES) watching that screen... TIME SPECTRUM HOLOBYTE Spectrum HoloByte's a name that might not be familiar to you if you're not a flight sim fan, but all that's about to change as the company revealed a string of console titles for 93. Top of the pile is the long-awaited STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION licence, due to appear on Super NES, PC, 3DO and, although it wasn't on show, for Virtual Reality. SNES, PC and 3DO versions all looked great, but don't expect them all to be the same type of game each version has been designed to suit the system, so PC and 3DO versions, for example, are a bit more adventurey than the Super NES. You'll have to wait a little longer for those versions, too SNES is due at Christmas, but PC and 3DO won't appear until the new year. "


"Star Trek took up the vast majority of Spectrum HoloByte's time and space, but the company still had time to announce that it's picked up the US console rights to Renegade's The Chaos Engine, which will appear on Megadrive and Super NES under the new name of Soldiers of Fortune. phere. Also showing for the first time were the new SNES and NES versions of THE UNTOUCHABLES movie licence, which is getting on a bit on the original floppy formats, but Ocean obviously thinks there's life in the old dog yet. Look out for this one in Autumn. And, for those willing to make the trek over to Ocean's luxury hotel on East Wacker Drive, the Digital Image Design team were giving sneak previews of their two top PC and Amiga titles for '93, THX and INFERNO, the sort-of sequels to F-29 Retaliator and Epic. Using the latest 3D techniques, both games look like they're shaping up to be something special. And the free dry roasted peanuts were great too. CAPCOM KONAMI STREET FIGHTER II! Yep, that was what it was all about over at Capcom. A 15-foot video wall was at the centre of the action, where both SFII SPECIAL CHAMPION EDITION for the Megadrive and SFII TURBO for Super NES got their first public showing Fancy a Street Fighter set-up like this in your bedroom? Having seen it in action, we can finally confirm that Megadrive SFII looks AMAZING as good as, if not better than, the SNES original; it's certainly faster. The game's impressive performance is all down to the cartridge's memory this is the world's first 24-Mb cart! SFIISCE is due for a stateside release in September, but there's still no word of a UK launch date. As for Turbo (or Hyper Fighting as it's otherwise known), well, there's not much to tell. Yes, you do get to play the bosses like in Champion Edition. Yes, it is faster. Oh, and the characters now have extra special moves, like a Chuni-Li fireball and Dhalsim's new disappearing act. No word on a British release date yet, but import copies should start filtering through from the US and Japan later this Summer But Ryu and Ken didn't dominate things completely. Capcom had a few more tricks up its sleeve for the show, including their version of Disney's ALADDIN (see Virgin), and a new conversion of the world-beating rolegame EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, both on Super NES. The latest Mega Man game (MEGA MAN X) and another Disney licence based around Goofy called GOOF TROOP are also on Who's that playing Clay Fighter? Why, it's Elvis himself! their way. The world's biggest publisher of Nintendo games had bundles of new titles in action here, the biggest being the coming soon conversions of the ultraviolent cop coin-op LETHAL ENFORCERS for Megadrive and Mega-CD. The game is to come packaged with a dedicated photon-firing revolver like the ones in the arcade, so a price has still to be decided. It's out in November. Another real show-stopper was ZOMBIES ATE MY NEIGHBOURS, a comicbook shoot 'em up romp through the world of B-movie horror by LucasArts that Konami has just picked up the rights to. Word of mouth on this one is hot Hot HOT, but the name of the game is likely to be changed for its UK e, so keep your eyes on CVG for details. SUNSET RIDERS, already a hit on Megadrive, is also due on SNES in November. And finally, Konami will be ringing in the new year with TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES TOURNAMENT FIGHTERS for Megadrive, in which the heroes in a half-shell square off in a Street Fighter II-style beat 'em up along with other characters from the once-popular-but-now-quite-naff comic. Looks good. Watch out for it. AND THE REST... OCEAN A relatively quiet show for the marvels from Manchester, although a few new licences and a couple of original lovelies were on display. The biggest name here was DENNIS THE MENACE, a SNES adaptation of the big John Hughes movie for Summer starring Walter Matthau and an annoying little brat who looks like Macaulay Culkin. This Dennis isn't based on the famous Beano strip, however, but the watered-down American cartoon series. From what we know of the game it's a platform type thing due out shortly after the movie, but it's still early in development so there's not much else to know. JURASSIC PARK on Nintendo formats was there, of course, on a separate stand decorated with jungle shrubbery and recorded dinosaur sounds to add atmosThere was so much stuff at CES, it's impossible to cover absolutely everything, but it seems a shame to leave anything out, so here's a quick mention of the best of the rest on show. Taito has revamped one of its classic Syd Mead's CyberRace on PC looks nice, doesn't it? coin-ops and you can expect to see SUPER CHASE HQ on Super NES next year... appearing at Christmas on the Sega Sports label will be GREATEST HEAVYWEIGHTS, a boxing sim featuring digital versions of Muhammad Ali, Rocky Marciano, Jack Dempsey, Evander Holyfield and more... Would you believe it? Namco has brought together two of the most famous games of all time in PAC-ATTACK, which combines elements of PacMan and Tetris to create a surreal puzzle game, while PAC-MAN 2, also on SNES, is an \"interactive cartoon\" with the original arcade game built in... Cyberdreams has now nearly completed work on the futuristic driving sim CYBERRACE, and has announced that DARKSEED 2 will be out next year... Tecmagic is bringing both SYLVESTER AND TWEETY and THE PINK PANTHER to Sega and Nintendo in two new cartoon adventures... WAYNE'S WORLD is on its way to the PC courtesy of Capstone... and the Game Boy version of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION from Absolute Software looks like a winner... TIK TOITE JURASSIC PARK IET AT&T's Edge 16 connects your Megadrive to the world. 19 "


"Toejam and Earl 2 (Megadrive) wowed most CES visitors let's just hope it's better than the first one. ADOBORU 2. FUNNIEST game of the show? The honours have to go to wait until you hear this TERMINATOR 2: CHESS WARS, coming soon on PC. Yes! \"Terminator is back... in a deadly game of Chess!\" blurts the press release, and it was all we could do to stop ourselves laughing. It's like futuristic Battle Chess, with the humans as the white pieces and Skynet's robotic killing machines as black. Whenever a piece takes another, there's a little animation when you see the ousted character being blown away. What next? Predator Backgammon? AMERICAN communications giant AT&T (the US equivalent of British Telecom) was at the show to launch its innovative Megadrive add-on. Called simply EDGE 16, it's a black box that plugs into the top of the console and can have cards inserted into it to save out your game or player status you could build up your favourite John Madden team, save it out to a card and take it round to a mate's house. Electronic Arts, Tengen and MicroProse are among the companies developing Edge-compatible games. (Above) Just for a laugh, Nintendo hired some top GFX artists to draw caricatures of people on Mario Paint. Ho ho! (Below) A couple of scenes from Terminator 2: Chess Wars that no doubt have you dribbling with excitement. Try not to get the page all soggy. Tecmagik's Pink Panther licence features all the original Henry Mancini music, and some top animation besides. Look out for this and Sylvester and Tweety after the Summer A blurry picture we know, but this really does have to be seen to be believed. Sega's new 32-bit coin-op technology is supercomputer-quality, and we can't wait to pump some pennies into it! Better yet, Edge 16 also allows players to plug their Megadrives into the telephone network to play, for the first time ever on console, multi-player online games over the phone. Your gaming pal may live on the other side of the city, but now you can take him on at Street Fighter II without either of you leaving the house! Obviously the system only works with the American phone network and there are, as yet, no plans to bring Edge 16 to the UK, but it's a nice glimpse of the future all the same. SEGA'S new VR headset may have stolen the show, but it wasn't the only Virtual Reality system on display there. You've probably never heard of VictorMaxx before, but you will do soon if their STUNTMASTER helmet takes off. Compatible with Megadrive and Super NES, the Stuntmaster claims to be compatible with all existing Sega and Nintendo software, simply taking the place of your regular TV screen like Sega VR does. IT'S ALWAYS nice to see that the all-time classics are alive and well. Tengen is bringing GAUNTLET 4 to the Megadrive, so called because it's the first game to make use of Sega's 4-player 'TAP' joypad adaptor. 90 new dungeons based on the seminal 80s coin-op have been squeezed into this 8Mb cart for the Warrior, Wizard, Valkyrie and Elf to battle through. No UK release as yet, but expect to see import copies in the shops around September. REMEMBER Activision? The company responsible for some of the classic console games from the dark old days of the Atari VCS is back with Super NES updates of three of its best-known golden oldies. RIVER RAID, KABOOM! and PITFALL HARRY are all lined up for a US release this Winter, with each game getting its fair share of new features as well as the obvious graphics and sound upgrades. The all-new River Raid, subtitled Mission of No Return, features night missions where the player must fly and hit targets using infra-red vision only, for example. Sounds a bit of a hoot to us. Hudson's Virtual Soccer (Super NES) DISNEY'S BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is on its way to the Super NES courtesy of Hudson Soft (SunSoft is doing the Megadrive version), along with conversions of INSPECTOR GADGET, SUPER BOMBERMAN (including a four-player joypad adaptor) and DIG & SPIKE, a beach Volleyball sim. Most exciting title at the stand, though, was VIRTUAL SOCCER, a 3D footy sim put together for Hudson by Probe Software which is looking very smart indeed. We'll be hassling Fergus McGovern, Probe's MD, for a quick butchers soon. MAKE ANY controller into the ultimate weapon! That's what Tyco's POWER PLUG claims to be able to do plug this little baby in between your console (Super NES, Megadrive or NES) and joypad, and you can completely reprogram the controls of any game to suit yourself. It's perfect for games like SFII, where the complex special moves can be programmed in and then executed with a single button press. There's also a 'power steering' mode for more precise control of games like Super MarioKart. The Power Plug goes on sale in the US this Summer at around $40 (around ), but there are no offical plans for a European launch yet. Pick one up on import, why not?

"&&8EFE TIME: JOSH (Top left to right) A selection of top action scenes from the movie and the multi-level Super NES version. in HERO CVG WORLD EXCLUSIVE Dinosaurs might be big box-office at the moment, but there's only one REAL giant in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger's new blockbuster Last Action Hero is coming to cinema and videogame screens from Sony, and it's shaping up to be THE big ticket for Christmas. Gary Whitta goes behind the scenes... DID SOMEONE SAY... ACTION? \"Big mistake...\" So goes Arnold Schwarzenegger's catchphrase as movie tough-guy Jack Slater in Last Action Hero, the Austrian Oak's latest box-office biggie. Even despite Steven Spielberg and those dinosaurs of his, Last Action Hero has been a huge success in the US, where it opened last month, and looks set to do the same when it breaks here on July 30. Never one to miss out on a good thing, Sony Imagesoft is bringing the movie to no less than NINE game formats in time for Christmas. Of course, it helps when the software publisher in question is owned by the same company that produced the film... Die-hard Arnie fans expecting a no-holds barred shoot 'em up in traditional Arnie style might be in for a shock, however. Our Arnold, you see, has ditched his old \"Terminator\" image and has become a more caring, sharing guy for the 90s, mainly because Hollywood research has revealed that 18-rated action movies are on the way out, and old-fashioned family entertainment is coming back. As a result, Last Action Hero isn't quite what you might expect from a typical Arnie romp. It's an action-comedy aimed more at the whole family than hardened adults in which Arnold plays Jack Slater, a tough movie cop who wows audiences with gory films like Jack Slater III and Jack Slater IV. Young cinema-goer Danny Madigan is his number one fan, and the fun starts when Danny is accidentally sucked through the cinema screen and into Slater's make-believe world by a magic movie ticket. TO BE OR NOT TO BE After teaming up with Slater, Danny has a great time in the movie world, meeting all his fictional heroes (including a cartoon cat "


"LOEK OSG9BESE TIME: 887 stark Arnie kicks butt in the Mega-CD version of Last Action Hero. Note that the bad characters can carry guns, but Slater has to rely on his fists and feet. Two of the game's more fearsome characters, the hockey player and The Ripper (who plays a major part in the movie as an axe-wielding maniac) shake their funky stuff in Mega-CD LAH (that's Last Action Hero to you). Digitised scenes from the movie link the beat'em-up levels together. This sequence is taken from the magical Pandora Theatre, from where Danny is blasted into Slater's world. In the final version of this Silicon Graphics-produced sequence, the cinema screen will be used to suck the player in to the action it's only blank on this work-in-progress version. caffeine-free, biodegradable, notquite-as-rough-and-tough version? THE GAME detective and even the T-1000 from Terminator 2) but slips up when he lets the magic ticket fall into the hands of the movie world's drug-dealing bad guy, who uses it to break out into the real world with all his criminal henchmen. To track them down, Slater (led by Danny) has to follow them into reality, where the rules are very different to those in his world it hurts when you try to punch out a car window, for a start. And for once, the bad guys can win... Sporting an all-star cast (everyone from Anthony Quinn to Tina Turner is in there somewhere) and one of Hero for the last three months. Of the nine versions of LAH in production (Mega-CD, Megadrive, Super NES, NES, Master System, Game Boy, Game Gear, Amiga and PC), the Mega-CD is probably the most important; not only is it the hottest format on both sides of the Atlantic right now, but its motion video power makes it ideal for a movie adaptation like this. After careful consideration, Steve and his 11-man team decided to turn the movie into a simultaneous twoplayer beat 'em up in the Final Fight/Streets Of Rage vein. Once you've selected your hero from a choice of three at the start (you \"Last Action Hero is ideally suited to conversion to a computer game,\" says Steve Riding, the man in charge of the Mega-CD version. \"The film contains all the classic elements necessary in a console game a strong main character, wall-to-wall action and a sense of fun all the way throughout.\" Steve is the game's producer at Psygnosis, which was recently bought by Sony and has been working on Mega-CD Last Action the biggest action budgets ever, Last Action Hero should be more than capable of slugging it out with Jurassic Park at the box office this Summer. The only question is, are we ready to wave goodbye to the old Arnie and accept the new, 25 "


"course, the games. «We've had to design the game around the premise that Slater does not use a gun or any projectile weapon throughout the game,\" explains Steve. «Mr Schwarzenegger feels that if children are constantly subjected to these violent images on the screen, they will identify with the violence and project it through to their real lives. It is arguable how much truth is in this, but we can't argue with the sentiments. And it didn't present us with any major problems.\" can be Slater himself, his daughter Whitney or the cartoon Cat detective), your job is to bash your way through six scrolling levels, each based around a scene from the movie (you start off busting crooks An LAH bad guy goes through the motions. in the movie world and finish up in NO GUNS! the real world at the premiere of Slater's new movie) and packed So, that all sounds simple enough. with familiar bad guys. A special But adapting a movie, especially baddy to beat is found at the end one as big as Last Action Hero, is of each stage, and each one is never easy. Just like Jurassic Park, taken directly from the movie the movie has been kept top secret because there's so many of them. during its production, which means And, of course, the action is introthat the game's developers weren't duced and broken down by even allowed motion video sequences taken to see the film directly from the movie. itself until earActually, due to the limitations on lier this film footage available, the Psygnosis month. Before team generated some scenes themthat, they had selves using powerful Silicon to work from Graphics systems the same comcopies of the puters that created the dinosaurs script, still for Jurassic Park. \"I believe that for photographs the first time the movie people are and selected beginning to realise the potential footage. for the interactive version of the Arnie's decimovie, especially with advances in sion to CD technology,\" says Steve. \"The change his player feels that he is actually taking tough-guy image hasn't helped the part of one of the players in the much either. So, although Jack story. What more could you ask for Slater wields a variety of guns in the in your entertainment?\" movie, he isn't allowed to in any of the merchandise products. That includes Last Action Hero things like plastic toys Sprite Information GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION and, of Name: BUNNY Danny's obsession with movies and the Slater character in particular, says Steve. «So the player of the game takes a step back and assumes the part of Danny as he controls Slater or the other movie characters through the game itself.\" Clever, clever. AND THE REST Most other versions of Last Action Hero are being handled by developers BITS, who have opted for a more traditional multi-level romp featuring beat 'em up, driving and shooting sections. All the stuff about Arnie not carrying guns still applies though, but don't worry because most Arnie games to date have been crap anyway, and this is probably just what we need, a bit of a change of pace. Amiga and PC versions ARE on their way, floppy fans, so you needn't fret, it's just that... erm... we don't know very much about them, that's all Mind you, neither did Sony when we phoned them up, so that's all right then. (Left) An early version of Jack Slater in action. (Below) Killer hockey sprites! NO KIDS! Movie producers Columbia weren't keen on young Danny Maddigan appearing in the game, either, which is why he's been left out.

Because there's so much confusion Design, Renegade, US Gold, Ocean and Virgin) and you have a VERY big games explosion waiting to happen. When a new games system or any piece of hardware is released, it needs software to back it up, and that's where the vicious circle starts no-one will buy a machine until they have something to play on it, Systei games and what they call \"interactive media.\" Enlisting members of the same team that designed machines like the Amiga and Apple Macintosh, Trip gave them a simple brief build the ultimate home entertainment machine. Three years later, it looks like that's just what they did, and 3DO are about the hottest three syllables in the industry today. 3DO designed the home system known as the Interactive Multiplayer but it doesn't build or sell them. Having set their standard for interactive CD, they then licence the technology out to their partner companies Panasonic, Sanyo and US telephone giant AT&T will all be producing their own version of the 3DO machine, adding their own wrinkles to 3DO's cast-iron specifications. Everyone, it seems, is into 3DO. As well as the big hardware corporations, 3DO is also working with MCA Universal Studios, Time Warner and Electronic Arts, three of the biggest-known entertainment firms in the world. Add to that another 302 companies who have all signed deals to write software for the machine (including big names like Psygnosis, Interplay, Core every new 3 DO machine is said to be the new 'standard'. So many companies have their own version there's CD-ROM, CD-I, Mega-CD CDTV each jostling to be the king of the hill. There's just so many of them and it's always confusing knowing which one you should buy. It's like the olden days of video, when you had VHS, Betamax and V-2000 all on the market, but it took a while before VHS finally emerged as the top boy and the rest died away. Panason and it's difficult to convince software houses to write for the machine unless they're sure people will buy it. 3DO seems to have no trouble here, though already there are 91 titles in development for the Interactive Multiplayer, with at least ten due to be released at the same time as the machine. Don't think of 3DO just as a games machine, though. This is a multimedia machine, which means that as well as play games, you'll be able to do your homework (yawn), play music, watch movies (with the help of a plug-in card) and run all kinds of other software all through the same basic system. As time goes by there'll be add-ons, like keyboards and mice to go along with the basic joypad, 3-D glasses, modems to connect you to the outside world and MIDI connectors so you can hook up synthesizers, drumkits and whatever else takes your fancy. It's worth noting, though, that of all the 91 titles in development for the 3DO, there are more games than any other type of software there's a proper look at some of the hottest titles over the page. It's easy to waffle on and make the 3DO sound impressive, but the best advertisement for the machine «3DO offers an incredibly realistic interactive experience, different from anything else on the market.\" Trip Hawkins That's what The 3DO Company is trying to do become the VHS of CD gaming, the industry standard that outdoes everything else and resigns them to the dustbin of history, along with the Oric Atmos, ZX Spectrum and everything Alan Sugar's ever done. So what is it, then? Right, this is how it works. Trip Hawkins, who founded Electronic Arts and is generally regarded as a man with one of the biggest thingies in the industry shower rooms, left EA in 1990 to form 3DO, a small research company with big ideas about the future of 30 "


"HREE DEE OH! WHAT A LOT IT'S GOTI A Education... A Action.. is the machine itself. It's a nondescript black box no bigger than a regular CD player (software comes on regular CDs, in case you were wondering), but has enough top-of-the-line sound and video hardware inside to knock your socks off six times over. We're talking about a machine that has more colours and a higher resolution than a regular TV (which means graphics that are even better than the real thing), a 32-bit RISC processor faster than any other machine in the shops, CD-quality sound and a CD-ROM player that can access the disc twice as fast as any other system, which means no more annoying waits or gaps in gameplay, like those seen in the old Laservision games or in some Mega-CD software. The result of all this high-level tech talk is a machine that's more impressive to look at and listen to than anything else ever seen. At the CES show in Chicago last month it was seen running real games for the first time (not just demonstration graphics), and everybody who saw any of the 35 titles on display there was gobsmacked. We're talking seriously good stuff here. The first version of 3DO's Interactive Multiplayer the Panasonic one pictured here, known as R.E.A.Lis due to be released in the US in October at around $700 (about ), which sounds a lot, but but bear in mind that 3DO is selling this machine not just as a new games console, but a totally new kind of home hardware, like a TV, video or Hi-Fi. Will people take to it? Who can tell? Trying to get people to buy a whole new kind of system is always tricky it certainly hasn't worked with any of the CD-i systems already on the market. The thing about 3DO is that it's SO sexy, and there are so many huge companies working with it that it's almost impossible to imagine it failing. Us Brits will get the chance to see it in early 1994, when the first PAL versions of 3DO are released in the UK. If you're wondering what makes the 3DO able to do such sexy things with its software, it's not just down to its hard 32-bit central processor. It also carries what the company calls Cinematic Software Tools basically a set of custom chips that allows the machine to come up with magical graphic effects. WARPING is a tool that automatically renders objects in 3D space simply define an object and 3DO can bend, twist, shrink and stretch it any way the programmer wants, without having to fiddle with complex rendering software for days on end. It's much easier to produce complex and impressive effects with 3DO, so you'll be seeing more of them here than on other systems. TRANSPARENCY is another automatic tool that makes solid images look as though they're made of glass, along with rippling water, fire, cloud and fog effects. There's also a whole set of LIGHTING effects enabling developers to create light-sourced, ray-traced objects and game worlds in minutes instead of months for a real-world feel and a TEXTURE-MAP tool that, like Nintendo's Super FX, can take twodimensional images and wrap them around 3D shapes, like cubes or even entire buildings. The point of all this technical malarkey is that, with a lot of the programming donkey-work taken care of by the machine, the programmer can concentrate on writing better games. And we say three cheers to that! A And catoon graphics. Panasonic Zal 31 "


"THE BDO GAMES 3 DO The 3DO Company says that its Interactive Multiplayer won't be just for games, and they may be right, but in the meantime there are more games in development for the machine than any other kind of software. That means mucho 3DO gaming excellence to the max come 1994. Let's take a look at some of the hottest dishes in the 3DO software kitchen... MAD DOG MCCREE The unlikely arcade hit from American Laser Games is currently being converted to most home CD formats, but the word on the street is that the 3DO version is tops. It's a wild west shooty game that takes the player through all the typical western scenes (the saloon, bank, stables and the main street shoot-out) against bandits, desperadoes and red injuns to free the town from Mad Dog's evil grip. 3DO's built-in full-motion video skills (30 frames per second) are being used to translate the game almost perfectly from the laserdisc original. TOTAL ECLIPSE A space-based flight sim along the lines of X-Wing and Wing Commander, Total Eclipse puts you in the cockpit of a FireWing starfighter, battling against an alien invasion force bent on taking over the Earth. The action takes place in space and over the mountainous planet surfaces, with 3D Surround Sound adding to the atmospheric experience. ROAD RASH: BLOOD OF THE OURIERS This is just one of Electronic Arts' favourite console titles that the company is upgrading for 3DO. With all of 3DO's technical excellence, EA has taken the bike riding action out of the old desert setting and into the heart of a futuristic city with you as a top motorcycle courier racing against rush-hour traffic. JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL Perhaps EA's most famous console game of all time, Madden is coming to the 3DO in style, with fullmotion video presentation that looks as good as a real TV show, digitised players and loads of CDquality speech. The gameplay is likely to be identical to the console versions, but it's in the graphic and sound areas that the real improvements are being made. Could this be the best-looking American Footy sim ever? PGA TOUR GOLF MICHAEL Another old EA favourite and one of the most popular games on display at the CES, too. As with Madden the game remains the same, but the graphics and sound have been upgraded beyond belief, so now you're in control of a real TV-quality golfer, playing over high-res digitised courses that look like the real thing and not just a bunch of overlaid polygons. CD sound provides the digital crowd sounds, swishes and, of course, that allimportant \"plunk\" when you sink the ball. SHOCK WAVE Aliens have invaded the planet Earth (again) and plan to rob it of its natural resources (what a surprise). And only you can stop them (well I never). Yep, this one's another Wing Commander-style space shooter, and also happens to be Electronic Arts' first original game for the 3DO. The Multiplayer's motion video hardware (called CinePak) is being used to come up with the \"photorealistic graphics in the flight and battle scenes. Mean, moody and perhaps magnificent. WORLDBUILDERS, INC. After all this action, it's time for something a bit more therapeutic a bit of strategy. EA's Worldbuilders, Inc. offers plenty of that, casting you as head of a futuristic exploration company hired to find planets in a remote star cluster and terraform them so humans can leave the overpopulated Earth and live on them. This one promises to be educational as well as fun by teaching players physics and astronomy basics. BATTLE CHESS Interplay's age-old favourite that started life on the PC all those years ago is back in its most impressive incamation yet. Being developed here in the UK, this 3DO version blows all others out of the water graphically, with amazing animation in the piece-takes-piece battle scenes and top-quality CD sound effects bringing up the rear. Look out for more on this one in CVG soon... JURASSIC PARK INTERACTIVE This was the only title not on display at CES, because, like the film, it's being kept a closely-guarded secret right up until its release. Rather than an action game like those seen on Sega and Nintendo formats, 3DO Jurassic is a strategic thing with the player caught up in the park control room when the dinosaurs escape. It's your job to steer the park guests to safety by using surveillance cameras, motion detectors and other high-tech equipment. And, of course, there's plenty of motion video character animation taken directly from the film. DRAGON'S LAIR It's only logical that one of the first ever laserdisc action games should be converted to 3DO. SO Dirk the Daring, Daphne the Princess and Singe the dragon are back yet again, with 3DO's CinePak technology used to come up with graphics almost as good as those in the arcades. You also get the complete arcade soundtrack, of course, but if you've played Dragon's Lair before you'll know not to expect too much on the gameplay front. STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION To boldly go where no-one has gone before... that's what the 3DO version of Spectrum HoloByte's latest promises to do, putting you in the shoes of Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Galaxy Class USS Enterprise and sending you on a cinematic voyage through the stars, with the character sprites rendered from the cast of the TV show, so they look like the real thing! The designers have created a storyline in the vein of the toprated series, but are keeping shtum about the details. THE 7TH GUEST PART II: THE 11TH HOUR The sequel to one of the best known CD-ROM games will be debuting on 3DO, while other CD systems are still waiting for their version of the original! It's back to the haunted mansion of crackpot toymaker Henry Stauff for yet more chilling adventures, this time in search for a famous TV producer who went to the Stauff ansion to film an episode of his show \"Cases Unsolved\" -and never returned. Could turn out to be the most impressive and hopefully, interactive version of the game yet DEMOLITION MAN Sylvester Stallon and Wesley Snipes team up as the good and bad guys in the latest Hollywood blockbuster Demolition Man, which has Stallone awoken from cryogenic freeze in the year 2036 to hunt down an escaped psychopath from the past in Los Angeles. Virgin is developing the licence for 3DO first, and this version is being described as one of those \"interactive movie\" thingies, although what we saw at the CES looked more like a cross between a driving game and Operation Wolf shoot 'em up. We'll see. CRASH 'N' BURN Every new system needs a decent race game to show off how fast it can move, and this one from Crystal Dynamics does just that. Crash 'n' Bumn is a futuristic combat driving sim along the lines of Death Race 2000 select your car, tool it up with a multitude of space-age weaponry, then take it out on the road (there are 30 tracks) against nine vicious computer-controlled drivers. You have to see it move to believe it. 3D FOOTBALL While EA's in-house team is busily converting John Madden Football to the 3DO, the game's original creators Park Place Productions have their own gridiron game to go up against it. Though still in the early stages, 3D Football looks very nice indeed, once again relying on 3DO's mega GFX technology to accurately digitise player animations from live video footage. Full-motion video clips are used for the replay sequences, and an intelligent moving viewpoint will, the makers claim, make the game look like TV coverage of the real thing. 3D ADVENTURES Could this be the first real interactive movie? In Park Place's 3D Adventures the player is catapulted into the lead role of a Hollywood-style blockbuster. You get to choose the physical size and strength of your hero (I'll have Arnie, please) before taking him through the film and determining how it turns out. Although the actual storyline is still a secret, expect full-motion video and CD sound a-plenty here. HOW TWISTED Every horribly tacky American game show you've ever seen comes together in one nightmarish TV special in Twisted, also from EA. Twink Fizzdale is your host for Twisted, which puts you up against six freakish contestants in eight different sub-games, interspersed with jingles and commercial breaks. Multiple people can play, with motion video techniques like those seen in PGA Tour Golf used to portray the characters. 32 "

"lights! camera! ACTION\" Mega-CD and next year's 3DO and LaserActive systems have proved that CD gaming can be sexy and interesting but what about CD-1? Gary Whitta has seen a whole new batch of games in development that could make CD-l a force to be reckoned with... PHILIPS D-l is not a new thing. It's been around for quite a while but it's never been known for its games.It's been out in front on its own, offering people who take it up a variety of educational, recreational and information based activities whilst doing very little in the way of games except for the odd golf game or flight sim. This was fine in the beginning for CD technology. Philips were the first on the streets with an interactive CD player, but they don't have the shelves to themselves any longer Mega-CD is already here, and 3DO and LaserActive (both featured this month) are on their way and looking good. But Philips isn't about to take all this lying down without a fight they were here first, after all. So, their battle-weary CD-I unit has gone and got itself a swish new designer wardrobe for the 90s, and a bundle of software infinitely less dull than the old stuff to go with it. And on top of that, the company has just signed a deal with one of Hollywood's biggest movie studios to give it extra muscle. The deal with Paramount Pictures, announced at the Chicago CES, means that Paramount will now be releasing its blockbuster movies on CD-I discs as well as VHS cassettes. Some of Paramount's best-known flicks, such as Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop and The Hunt For Red October have been released to get the ball rolling straight away. By plugging in a separate FMV (full-motion Our personal favourite CD-l game of the moment is the sleazy thriller Voyeur. Cor video) card you can watch the Laserdisc-quality movies the only problem being that you can only squeeze 72 minutes of pictures and sound onto a normal 5-inch disc, which means that most movies will have to come on two discs and need to be swapped at some point during the action This is all very well and good, but what about the GAMES? That's what we're really interested in here, after all. Well, CD-l's not good quite as good a games reputation as the likes of 3DO and Mega-CD because it's a bit more of a serious machine, so the software available tends to be more along the lines of interactive cookery books, atlases, music videos and all that guff. But, knowing that systems like the 3DO and LaserActive are a real threat, Philips is getting more games-orientated, with a whole bundle of new titles on the way to tempt games fans. So far, games like Palm Springs Open, Tetris and Defender of the Crown haven't exactly got gamers drooling with excitement, but the new batch on the way might. Titles like the upcoming Voyeur are almost guaranteed to have you drooling in one way or another it's an interactive movie produced by the people at Playboy Video, which means it's a bit... ahem... saucy. Robert Culp stars as a presidential candidate drawn into a web of sexual intrigue by a bevy of sexy sorts as a secret agent based across the road from his mansion, your job is to collect enough dirt on the would be pres with your roving video camera. It's a bit like Night Trap, where you have to be in the right place at the right time to catch the sexy scenes. Like Night Trap, Voyeur uses digitised animation rather than real FMV, but CD-I's graphic capabilities give you a bigger screen area and much higher resolution, which means more realistic images. And the game's so rude that it even has a built-in combination lock to stop young kiddies playing it! If you want to watch Paramount's movies on your CD-I, you'll have to shell out extra for this full-motion video card. 34 "


"[ 1-1 3 Philips' new-look CD-1 player, the CDI-220, in all its glory. Actually, not quite all its glory, because it's a black-and-white pic. Sorry. HOME .. OTR 13 BALL ONEILL FIELD T.O. ceo VISITORS FIELD | Joak Walker Kevin Butler Gayle Sayers Cookie Gilchrist EXIT Animated antics in Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon. If you're a complete dullard, you might get some enjoyment out of NFL Football Trivia Challenge, soon to be released on CD-l. But we doubt it. Virgin's CD-ROM blockbuster The 7th Guest is also rewing up for release on CD1, with the advanced capabilities of the Philips machine making for a much faster and more fluid game, with no annoying pauses or jerky graphic updates. And, thanks to a tie-in with Nintendo, Philips is also bringing console characters Zelda and Link to CD-I. Both games Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Link: The Faces of Evil are interactive cartoon adventures using full-motion video animation, and according to Philips more CD-I games featuring Nintendo stars are on their way. And let's not forget Rebel Assault, the new CD-only Star Wars flight sim from LucasArts. Finally, for sports fans, there's Caesar's World of Boxing, a fighting/management simulation that mixes arcade boxing action (basically it's TV Sports: Boxing under a different name) with live full-motion interactive scenes you get to chat to the sleazy promoters, do interviews with the TV and press and even chat up the occasional blonde bimbo! The live backgrounds were shot on location at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, and the actors superimposed using cinema-style bluescreen trickery. The demo version on show at CES looked nice, but you'll have to wait for a verdict on the finished article. So, that's CD-l for the 90s in the nutshell. Philips may not have made the CD-I bigtime so far, but with a new wave of games, a cheaper, more compact machine (you can pick up the new-look model now for about ) and a catalogue of big-name movies to keep mum and dad happy, the likes of 3DO might still have a fight on their hands. It might not be the sexiest of the CD set-ups on offer, but at this rate it'll probably still be around when other systems have gone to the wall and that's what counts.

"get ACTIVATED! Along with Philips, Panasonic and Sanyo, Pioneer is the latest company to jump on the interactive CD bus with its LaserActive system. Have Philips and 3DO got anything to worry about? Maybe... No firm word on the games coming for the Laser Active yet, but these early shots of demo games for the system look promising. verybody gets turned on by the idea of having the sleekest, sexiest Telectronic entertainment gear in their home, but not everyone has the pocket power to make the dream a reality. But if you're one of the lucky few with money to burn, the chances are you're the proud owner of a Laserdisc player and if you've got one of those, chances are it's made by Pioneer. But there's only so much fun you can have with what is basically just a digitial video player, which is why Pioneer plans to breathe new life into its technology by making it you guessed it interactive. o leme A SED Pab Pule en el Laser Active's FMV technology overlays computer graphics and digital video footage, no problem. 36 "


"A Pioneer's LaserActive system in its entirety you buy the base unit first, and add the Mega-LD, LD-ROM2 and LaserKaraoke dongles as you go along. aserActive is the next step up for Laservision; the main unit is just like a conventional Laserdisc player, running all your conventional CDs and video discs. The innovation comes in the form of three new magic black boxes that, when plugged into the main set, make all the difference in the world. allowing computer graphics to be overlaid and interact with the video footage, as seen on The Chart Show. In all, LaserActive is capable of handling up to an hour of full-motion video and CD-quality sound and up to 540 Megabytes of graphics, sound and gameplay. That's a lot of memory to play with. The MEGA-LD pack has been developed in conjunction with Sega and, when connected to the LaserActive set, allows you to play not only Pioneer's own Mega-LD interactive discs, but also Sega Mega-CDs Like any «multimedia\" system, Pioneer is pushing LaserActive not just as a games system, but a system you can use for watching movies, listening to music and playing all kinds of interactive software, from educational to \"how-to\" instruction courses and those elusive interactive movies we keep hearing about. But it's the entertainment side we're really interested in, and though the Mega-LD and LD-ROM2 give new owners an immediate software library to choose from on Sega and NEC's machines, we'll have to wait to find out what the LaserActive itself can really do on the games front. The system is due for release in the US later this year, but us Brits will probably have to wait until '94 before our tum comes around, by which time we'll also have 3DO on the shelves. Decisions, decisions... and conventional Megadrive cartridges. If the PC Engine is more your thing, you can opt instead for the LD-ROM2 pack from NEC. Again, LaserActive discs are compatible, and you get the added bonus of being able to play PC Engine cartridges and Turbo Duo discs on it. Finally, there's the LASERKARAOKE box so you can warble along to your favourite Sinatra videos. We all know what Mega-CD and Turbo Duo games are capable of, but what does LaserActive itself have to offer? Well, according to Pioneer, a tech spec far more impressive than its nearest competitor, Philips CD-I. Because it's a Laservision system at heart, full-motion video comes as standard without the need for expensive plug-in cards, with the added LaserActive technology "

Ithough it is well established over in the States, CDROM is only just beginning to take off on this side of the Pond. Up until now, a lot of CD releases have just been enhanced versions of original disk-based titles, but now the software houses are beginning to develop games primarily on CD-ROM. Some of these will later be cut down for regular PC use, whilst others such as 7th Guest will remain unique to the CD format.

In the TOUGHEST challenge of the decade! theporlds MORTAL KOMBAT They're the two top characters in the country's Number One TV show.z They're also a -extremely hard Who could be better qualified to take on the CVG Crew at Mortal Kombat? Three of the toughest men in showbusiness finally go head-to-head... shove. So, when it came to choosing a game for them to play, there was really only ever one choice Mortal Kombat. Currently the biggest coin-op in the country and about to be the hottest conversion of the year thanks to Acclaim, Mortal Kombat is THE game for anyone who's not averse to a little rough 'n tumble so Ross and Steve jumped at the chance to take on the might of the world's greatest gamers and interrupted their busy shooting schedule to trip down to the CVG offices (where a Mortal Kombat koin-op has been installed) for the day and try their luck! 3400000 EEEEE 0000 ere at the GAGES SUB ZERO Challenge Office of CVG (third on the right past the gents), we try to bring together the biggest names from the worlds of sport and showbiz with the best video games the industry has to offer. We've had some top combinations in the past to be sure, but NEVER have we come up with anything as smart as this month's All-Star Challenge we bagged none other than Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden, otherwise known as battling brothers Grant and Phil Mitchell in BBCl's top-rated soap, EastEnders! If you're one of the show's 20 million avid fans, you'll know that Phil and Grant are two of the toughest characters on the box. Brought up around the seamy backstreets of London, these lads know how to handle themselves when push comes to 42 Even hard men have a hard time on Mortal Kombat! "


"THE CHALLENGE THE MORTAL KOMBATANTS ROSS KEMP (aka Grant) In EastEnders, Ross is definitely the hardest of the two Mitchell brothers, what with being an ex-paratrooper, having top criminal underworld connections and being able to beat people up with ease. You may also remember Ross from the Kellogs Fruit'n'Fibre ad before he became a TV tough guy. But on the video games front he's a little rough around the edges now that Pete Beale's left the show, perhaps he could borrow his Game Boy. STEVE Simple enough, really. While Grant and Phil (sorry, Ross and Steve) warmed up with a few practice games, the CVG crew explained the rules. Gary Whitta, still rejoicing over his glorious victory last month against Arsenal's FA Cup-winning squad, was the man to beat, so Ross and Steve would take him on one at a time if both could beat him, the Challenge crown would change hands. If Whitta could beat them both, his title would remain safe, as would the pride of CVG. A mixed result (ie one win for the Mitchells and one for CVG) would be declared a draw. It all sounded perfectly simple, but by the time the rules had been explained, both Ross and Steve had become thoroughly engrossed in their two-player practice and demanded that, before the challenge proper took place, they get the chance to play each other in a pre-match battle to find out who was the best. Yes, just as their characters are battling love rivals in EastEnders, Ross and Steve had become true-life enemies at Mortal Kombat! Whitta was happy for the preliminary bout to take place it would give him a chance to check out the competition and pick up on their flaws and tactics. Ross looking very hard indeed. OPENING EXHIBITION MATCH ROSS VS STEVE MCFADDEN (aka Phil) Not quite as hard as Ross in EastEnders, Steve nevertheless has a fine pedigree as a telly hardman. In EastEnders he's smacked his fair share of people, been a getaway driver and even offered Grant out for a fight! TV afficionados may also remember him as one of the yobs alongside Gary Oldman in The Firm, Alan Clark's brilliant drama about football violence. Quality credentials for a beat 'em up challenge if ever a man had them. With Ross and Steve cracking their knuckles ready to play, and Whitta safely ensconsed in a prime spectator position behind them, we were ready for the off. The winner would be decided on one match, the best of three bouts. Of the seven hard characters of offer, Ross had warmed to Kano, the gangland fighter with a steel plate Come on then you cowson... in his bonce that gives him a devastating headbutt. Steve, however, liked the look of the shaolin warrior and Bruce Lee-lookalike Liu Kang. The first bout was a pretty messy affair; even after a few practice games Ross and Steve, who'd never played Mortal Kombat before, were still getting to grips with the controls, so the on-screen fight was more like a drunken punch-up than a disciplined exhibition of martial arts skills. At first, Ross and Steve's technique seemed to be simply to waggle the joystick and hammer away at the buttons like mad until the coin-op cabinet started to wobble from side to side. Several minutes of random battering finally produced a winner in the form of Ross, who had got the metallic headbutt sussed and used it well against Steve who, by this time, was still struggling to disover any of Kang's secret moves. Steve looking very hard indeed. GAZ (aka Gaz) Aside from fleeting appearances on Noel Edmonds' Multicoloured Swap Shop, TV-am and GamesMaster, our Gaz isn't much of a TV star, and he's not particularly tough either. He does, however, have the advantage of having practiced loads on the office coin-op, and even got his mates at Probe Software (who converted the game) to fax him all the secret moves and death blows. The cheating swine, eh? Gaz looking not at all hard. You'd better hope you never spill any of these two geezers' pints... So, 1-0 to Ross (Grant) in the preliminaries a second win would secure the match. With Steve on the ropes and his macho image at stake, he knew he had to do something fast. Not happy with Kang, he wanted to change characters, but was forced to stick with him until the end of the match. Ross, on the other hand, was well chuffed with Kano and his headbutt and was ready to rumble when it was time to FIGHT! in the second round. But Steve's character Phil in EastEnders has never been afraid to stand up to his brother, and it's no different when it comes to the real-life world of video gaming. Coming on strong and pulling no punches, Steve leaped fiercely into the second bout, taking the fight to Ross and raining Midway's Mortal Kombat looking hardest of all. 43 "


"MOUN KIMET Whitta deals out his own brand of punishment... ROUND TWO punches down on Kano. Within seconds Ross was on the ropes, getting in the odd consolation punch but little else before Steve finally took him down with a bone-crunching flying kick. If it hadn't been for the couple of blows he took, Steve would have scored a Flawless Victory and gained a bonus 200,000 points for his trouble. Ross was physically shaken by Steve's shock second-round performance it tied the score and meant the match must go to a final, deciding bout. Could Steve's new-found skills come good for him again? Or might Ross' Kano headbutt be enough to secure a victory? Actually, there wasn't much of either on display as both players seemed to panic and resort to their old buttonthumping methods. In the end it was Ross who got the upper hand literally when, with both players down to critical energy, he finished off Steve with a devastating uppercut to win the war of the Mitchell brothers. A celebratory handshake later and that was the appetiser over with. Now time Steve celebrates his comeback. for the main course... ...before it all goes horribly wrong and the two kombatants decide to have a REAL-LIFE punch-up! (don't worry kids, it's only pretend). MATCH ONE GAZ VERSUS ROSS No time for analysis or rethinking of strategies. It was straight into the second bout, with Whitta once again taking command early. No-one likes a show-off, least of all Ross it would seem, as he finally decided enough was enough and layed into Gaz with a surprise flurry of blows that caught him off-guard and almost threatened to level the score until the sweaty champ once again resorted to coward's tactics and used his secret Fireball move to finally see Ross off quickly and cleanly. Whitta had won the first match to go one-up, but everyone agreed it wasn't exactly a sporting victory. Funny how Whitta never mentioned how he'd been secretly faxed the details of all the special moves, either. So, it had come to this. The Big Fight. The Realisation of a Dream. The industry's Number One gamesplaying star (pah! Ed) against TV's top tough guy. Both combatants boast impressive credentials in the world of being quite hard, but Whitta seemed the clear favourite based on his sneaky late-night \"practice sessions and Ross' sketchy performance in the preliminaries. But was Ross only faking and getting ready to pull something a bit special out of the bag? Could be, could be... when it came to fighter selection, he went straight for a new character in the form of Raiden, while Whitta chose his personal favourite, the super-cool ex-movie star, Johnny Cage. MATCH TWO GAZ VERSUS STEVE OUND ONE So, it looked as though Whitta, the smug git, had it in the bag. He'd offed the winner of the preliminary match so, logically, the rest should be a walkover. Shouldn't it? Steve showed no sign of nerves as he stepped up to the coin-op and surveyed the fighters available. After a bad experience with Liu Kang, he needed somebody new Sonya Blade, Raiden and SubZero all caught his eye, but in the end it was the ninja Scorpion that he went with. With zen magic at his fingertips, he's got some of the deadliest secret moves in the game but only if you know how they work. Whitta smiled smugly as he punched up Johnny Cage for a second time... MORD KOMBIT EXCLUSIVE! Soap stars in challenge cheat shock! Ross gets the last laugh in the post-match handshake. ROUND ONE MIKILL KOM, As the battle began, respect was due to Ross, who immediately had to contend with a blatant show-off performance from Gaz. Normally, when the celeb hasn't had much practice, it's customary for the CVG star to cut them a little slack and back off in the early stages. But Whitta was displaying no such sympathy, coming at Ross like a whirling dervish. Ross, by some miracle (actually Steve told him) had by this time discovered the Block button and was hammering at it for all he was worth to protect himself. It seemed to work, too, as Gaz's attacks stopped connecting and he was forced to back off and rethink his strategy. Ross seized the opportunity to counter-attack, and for a brief time it was he who had the advantage before Whitta tired of it all and, sneak that he is, resorted to repeated use of one of Cage's special moves, the Green Fireball, to finish off a defenceless Ross. What a scumbag. No wonder Steve's smiling he's just seen how much he's getting paid. "


"FIGHT! Anxious to finish this off quickly so he could go to lunch, Whitta leaped in at the start with a flying kick, only to find his attack blocked and countered with devastating force by a succession of punches from Steve! What was going on? Even while Whitta, shocked by this initial show of force, backed off to regroup, Steve was on him again, using foot sweeps to knock him off balance. With energy dwindling and time running out, Whitta reverted again to his fireball (yawn!) to hold Steve at bay, but it wasn't enough. As Whitta raced in to follow up on the fireball attack, he found Steve too fast for him again, and a killer of a kick to the midsection blew him out of the water and awarded the first bout, conclusively, to Steve. MIDWAY ROUND TWO Another shock defeat for Whitta! What's the world coming to? MIDWAY MIRINL, KIMBIT Well, the CVG Challenges have never lacked drama, and this had more than most. Although Whitta knew he couldn't lose the challenge thanks to his earlier victory over Ross, this had now become a matter of personal pride. Could he, a top gaming champion (Pah! again Ed) really lose against a mere TV celebrity? His answer came as Steve started the next round by cutting through Gaz's ramshackle defences like a knife, going back to that favourite foot sweep of his to constantly down the «champion\". Whitta, normally cool and collected, was beginning to panic and fight back with an uncoordinated frenzy of kicks, only a few of which connected. Steve saw his opening between the attacks, picked his moment and unleashed an awesome uppercut that blasted Gaz off the top of the screen, soaked the whole place with bloodand secured the victory. Steve's final message says it all-give peace a chance. THE RESULTS THE RESULTS THE RESULTS THE RESULTS \"I do not belieeeeeeve it!\" was all Whitta would say after his pitiful performance that only just scraped a draw for CVG against the \"Mitchell\" boys. So much for the Mortal Kombat champion. There were calls for his resignation from some quarters and, as a result, Whitta will be stepping down as CVG Challenge champ as of next month, to be replaced by a better man. For the record, CVG's performance in the Challenge season goes like this: 1 loss (to Nigel Benn), 2 draws (with Zig & Zag and Ross'n'Steve) and 1 win (against Arsenal FC). MORLLRUMBLE Another challenge ends with humiliation for Whitta. Can the crew stop the rot in time for next month? Yet another obvious CVG plug. Yawn. DON'T MISS NEXT MONTH'S CHALLENGE IN WHICH CVG WILL NO DOUBT BE VICTORIOUS! 45 "

Will the arcade giant be a console success? Will it keep the splatterings of gore that made the coin-op such a monster? Find out NOW with the FIRST EVER Megadrive review! The ultimate goal; the old git! ou've read the previews, you've scanned lesser tomes for snippets of info, but only CVG brings you the first review of Acclaim's immortal Megadrive beat 'em up, Mortal Kombat! With Streetfighter 2: Championship Edition still nowhere in sight, Acclaim might just whip in and steal Capcom's thunder and deservedly so. Development team Probe has pulled out all the stops to deliver the biggest kick up the backside to the Megadrive for ages. You may be waiting for Capcom's cart, but Mortal Kombat is going to land with such a thump it'll leave a crater of crumpled software in its wake for months to come! I'm not sure of Sonya's tactics, but Kano's seen his chance! 22 LIU KANG AGE: 24 HEIGHT: 5'10\" WEIGHT: 185lbs ORIGIN: China OCCUPATION: Shaolin Monk. Kang is a Shaolin Monk and strives to win the title with a buming desire. It was lost to the evil magician's monster 500 years ago when Goro destroyed the noble Kung Lao, the eternal and honourable Shaolin Champion, and plunged the tournament into dishonour. SHANG TSUNG AGE: Unknown HEIGHT: 6'2\" WEIGHT: 210lbs ORIGIN: China OCCUPATION: Machiavellian. Before Tsung entered the Shaolin tournament in his youth it was a competition of honour. He won first time and with every victory he made he gained a soul and kept his youth. Eventually defeated by Kung Lao and the title went back to the noble Shaolin. Now he needs to recapture it to save his frail old body from death. Day KANO AGE: 35 HEIGHT:6' WEIGHT: 205lbs ORIGIN: Unknown OCCUPATION: Criminal. Ruthless leader of the underground organisation The Black Dragon gang. Although he was an orphan himself he has no qualms about making other innocent victims' children the same! He wants to lay waste to Shang Tsung's fabled fortune and as soon as he wins the tournament his gang are poised to ransack the island. GORO AGE: 2000 HEIGHT: 8'2\" WEIGHT: 550lbs ORIGIN Outworld OCCUPATION: Prince and ruler. This massive giant burst into our world from his own at Shang Tsung's summoning to defeat the legendary Shaolin Champion Kung Lao he's been victorious ever since! Undefeated in 500 years, Goro has become over-confident, but his strength, size and experience make him the one to beat. 48 "


"SAD FOLK START HERE GARTH Dance Sun-ZERO Oh my word, you sad man! Call yourself a lean, mean kombat machine when you can't even get off the first stage? I've seen cream puffs harder than you! Are you sure you've got the pad plugged into the right port? Try battling on Easy level for the first few games. CIPPIN Straight for the jugular with Shadow moves. NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER STEVE WHAT'S THE POINT? In case you need reminding the path to victory requires you to deplete your opponent's energy bar to zero in a best of three rounds battle. At the end of your second victory your battered victim will stand stunned for a few seconds and Shang Tsung will screech 'Finish Him! You'll then get a 'free' shot at his crumpled body to complete the slaughter brutal! Although Mortal Kombat's all about destroying your opponent in the most violent way possible, there is a points structure to the cart as well. The computer remembers the highest amount of wins in a row for the top nine characters, so if you chalk up an amazing amount of victories without defeat you can rub your mates' noses in it! There are four difficulty levels too, for even more embarrassingly biting victories. Most gamers will have no trouble wading through to the final encounter with Shang Tsung on Easy, but completing the tournament on Very Hard is an entirely different ball game! They only come one harder than this and believe me, they don't come any tougher to beat. Try keeping away from the guy and not committing yourself to moves so much. If you've got projectiles use 'em! \"Get over here!' Like you have a choice! AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! ROUTE TO THE TOP PA This is the big one, Shang Tsung. He knows all the tricks and changes into every other character one by one, so he's got all their special moves as well! Beat him on the hardest level and you're tops! VERDICT To get to the top and take on the big boys stationed on Shang Tsung's island you'll have to fight your way through all the other competitors as well as an identical version of yourself. Then there are three Endurance' rounds where you fight two different characters per round and have to beat both with only one bar of energy! Then your power will be restored and you must beat them again to go onto the next 'Endurance' round, Get through that and your reward will be a match-up with the 500 times-a-winner, never before defeated Goro. Survive this encounter and it's a duel to the death with Shang Tsung himself, who can change into the appearance of all the other souls you've wiped out on your way up and use their special powers as well. Phew! For a minute there I thought it was going to be tough! Acclaim has been banging on about this license for so long now that it just had to be a winner, and by golly it is! Probe, the team normally associated with a clutch of top platform romps, has had its dream factory working round the clock to come up with what is THE best battler on the Megadrive, bar none; the digitised fighters are almost spot-on copies of their coin-op counterparts, and when you plug in the six-button pad and get to grips with the moves it puts even the SNES' champion Streetfighter 2 to shame. Mortal Kombat is the Jurassic Park of console games a sure-fire blockbuster. CVG WARNING: IF YOU ARE OF A NERVOUS DISPOSITION OR OF AN UNSTABLE NATURE DO NOT TURN THIS PAGE! PAUL RAND RAYDEN AGE: Immortal HEIGHT: JOHNNY CAGE AGE: 29 HEIGHT: 6'1\" WEIGHT: 350lbs ORIGIN: SCORPION AGE: 32 HEIGHT: 6'2\" WEIGHT: 210lbs ORIGIN: Hades OCCUPA TION: The SUB-ZERO AGE: 32 HEIGHT: 6'2\" WEIGHT: 21 0lbs ORIGIN: China OCCUPATION: Lin Kuei Ninja Assassin Sub-Zero enjoys the thrill of the stalk and kill. He's lost count of the amount of people he's dispatched from the world and has now entered the competition for the ultimate combat experience. Universal Planes Of Being OCCUPATION: Deity.

"VERDICT WHAT! YOU WANT MORE? MORTAL KONTROLS! Make use of Sega's new SIXBUTTON pad for best results! START I enjoyed Mortal Kombat even more than the arcade! A better job of this on Megadrive could not have been done. Special praise must be given to Acclaim who've gone with the violence option in the wake of the Night Trap farce. Great music, classic killer special moves, brilliant effects and more options than an England football team manager could hope for! This is the most action-packed, responsive and downright fun Megadrive beat 'em up ever seen and will quite probably remain so for a very long time. The full arcade mode gore cheat is not the only thing Acclaim is holding back on. Another cheat lets you access a whole menu of delights that allow you to perform an amazing array of cheats. Players can choose to have a one-hit contest where the first fighter to even remotely receive a scratch goes face down in the dirt. Infinite credits can be obtained at the flick of a switch and you can permanently turn on the killing moves. At the other end of the programmers' crazy minds you can add some special effects to your game, like watching a severed head belonging to Probe's MD bounce along behind fighters on the pit level or add funky silhouettes to locations. 'It just gets weirder and weirder! You can bet with versions coming out on just about every single format there are a lot more surprises in store. STEVE KEEN WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR! (PAD)Left, right, crouch, jump (loads of button and pad combi nations for kicks and punches) (START) Block, bonus round chop. (X) High punch. (Y) Block (Z) Low punch. (A) High kick (B) Block (C) Low kick Now that's a move Kang didn't expect. Duck or be fried! The choice is yours Although the normal cart you plug in will be free of gore and guts, programmers Probe have included a secret cheat mode that will open the flood gates for the red stuff to flow and, more importantly, the killer moves to be executed. THAT'S RIGHT! The deadly finishing moves are in there, including the legendary Spinal Tearing move, where a character rips the head off his opponent, complete with blood and dangling spinal column, to hold aloft whilst the decimated body crumples to the floor! Don't believe us? Just look below and gasp! NEVER IN ONE PLACE The fighting's spread over several locations around Shang Tsung's island. On one location the losing fighter is thrown completely off the screen and hurtles downwards to be impaled on a set of rather juicy spikes! If you're lucky you might even come across the Green Ninja, who jumps up occasionally before bouts to taunt you. He leaves behind clues as to what stage he can be found on. One nice touch is at the end of the game when you find out the true reason for your character's entry into the tyrant Shang Tsung's fight fest and what they'll do when they leave the arena. Then the digitised actors' credits roll to wrap things up. CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONS CAGE The Hollywood film star has tapped all his SFX connections to come up with this blinding bolt of power! The Van Damme look-a-like is still pretty fit and with the Shadow Kick he can cover more ground RAYDEN It's only natural that the God Of Thunder would have command of the elements and this awesome bolt of lightning is devastating. Drop you guard for a second and Rayden will flatten you against the opposite wall by turning into a torpedo! This is the juicy bit; seven new characters with tons of hidden moves and a special arsenal of combat techniques to keep the most ardent scrappers on their toes. Each fighter possesses two extra special moves, with a few having three. Some are better than others and a lot easier to execute in the heat of battle by performing acrobatics on the pad. Here's the pick of the bunch! SCORPION Scorpion ensnares victims with a harpoon and draws them in. By! using his ghoulish talents the ghost can double his force and produce a replica of himself to act as a decoy. SONYA Sonya uses her ring of plasma to singe holes in the opposition. Get too close to her and she'll grip you with her powerful thighs and toss you to the ground like a limp lettuce. SUB-ZERO Sub can freeze competitors with a bolt of ice, then stride up for a 'free' smack at them! KANG Bruce Lee never had powers like these! Kang's fireball is the result of pure Shaolin power! KANO When he's not using the metal plate in his head to butt people, Kang can throw a pretty mean knife to shred your bones! 50 "


"VERDICT CHEATS DO PROSPER! MEGADRIVE Mortal Kombat is a classic! It's fast, playable and utterly brilliant! And even if you like your fighting akin to a bloodfest, the killer moves are almost too ugly to watch! And unlike some of the SF2 moves, the control is certainly easier. It's a pity that to get the best out of Mortal Kombat you've got to fork out for a Sega six-button joypad, but you really need one to get the very best out of your fighter when you're in Kombat! This is undoubtedly the only alternative to SF2. It's blood-tastic! Chances are you won't be able to experience the thrills of these moves until well after the game has been in the shops officially. We can't reveal the cheats just yet, so you'll have to hang in there until a later issue. In the meantime here's every character's killing move for you to drool over at the bottom of the page! Not only can you control these moves but you can choose whether to execute them as well, Be warned, though; they take forever to perfect and require pixel perfect accuracy and timing to perform successfully, but you'll definitely want to put in the time! PROS: The best digitised graphics ever seen on any home format. Above all, great fun to play. CONS: A touch slow to react to the joypad controls. Once you've committed to a move, there's no turning back. GARTH SUMPTER HORREN AN Underhand tactics from the Thunder God. EST UR MICHT GRAPHICS Generally good, but Goro's not convincing at 85 all! Now I don't believe you wanted to do that! Skillin' tunes, brilliant sampled speech and effects. Get your bar up as quick as possible and smash! ON THE OTHER HAND Whoa! What hit me? GAMEPLAY elements 90 Once you've found the moves, very rewarding. FATAL FURY .99 Fatal Fury never was such a good game in the arcades, so its Megadrive counterpart was onto a losing battle from the start. Bad animation and below average gameplay make it an extremely wet fish out of water. The best one-on-one Megadrive beat 'em up ever! REVIEWED: CVG No 136 Come on Kano, I've got something for you STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES KILL OR BE KILLED! CAGE With one mighty blow the thug RAYDEN In the final lunge the Thunder God leans forward and fires a lightning bolt at your head, exploding it in a ball of blood! SONYA The lycra lass daintily blows an orange ball which fries your flesh leaving only the ashes of a skeleton behind! swipes your head off your shoulders with only a pool of blood to prove it was ever there! ONWU VOO  W KANO One powerful thrust of his semi clenched fist is enough to plough through an enemy's rib-cage, rip out their still beating heart and display it before their eyes! MISS OK. HIT SUB-ZERO This is the one! The ice-man calmly places two hands around your head and with one deft move rips it clean away from your body, spinal column and all! KANG Nothing too gruesome for Bruce Lee's double. Just try a simple flip and a whop ping bloody uppercut to sort him! 90 "

"VERDICT CONSTRUCTO TRACK MEGA-CD XJ220 was one of the better arcade style racing games on the Amiga, and it shouldn't have been a problem to convert it to Mego-CD at all. Unfortunately, now it's here we're a bit disappointed. The game runs a bit too slow for my liking, and there's no reason why that should be. XJ220 certainly looks the partand with the track editor there's endless hours of fun to be had on different courses. This isn't a bad game at all with the current crop of unimpressive CD games it's good to see something that's got some gameplay and doesn't rely on piccies but it an extra bit of time had been spent souping yp the speed, we could have seen something even better. Finished the best courses the world can throw at you? Then try building your own! Jaguar offers a novel track design feature which actually saves your construction to the Mega-CD's battery back-up system. The first step in creating your dream track is deciding which country it's going to be in. This affects the weather, the terrain and the type of road-side objects you get to use. Your track can be virtually any shape you want, the only rule being that both ends must meet. The finish and start lines are already in place, along with the pit lane; all you have to do is add the bits in between. It! helps to have a clear idea of the type of track you want at the outset, otherwise you'll end up with something which is just impossible to drive on. PROS: Good graphics and an excellent custom track designer. CONS: Not fast enough and the car's handling could have been more realistic. STEVE KEEN BLOW YOUR WAD Fast update and detailed trackside objects. After being bathed in glory and cash following a race, your next stop is the garage, where you get to spend your hard-earned cash patching up your battered Jag. GRAPHICS PE 2 Good CD tunes but appaling engine noise. 2 ONNONDOS Bank 33000 Cost:5000 N. Select Country 5 JOHA 6 Go on; select away! GAMEPLAY Realistic car handling would have made the game. 1 JAGUAR J220; isn't it nice? At the moment it's in need of several thousand pounds worth of repairs. 2 FUNDS: Here you're told how much cash you've got and how much the repairs will cost. If you can't stump up the cash you're not allowed to race. 3 ENGINE: This is the most expensive part of the lot. Blow this and you can practically kiss your career goodbye. 4 TYRES: Take corners badly and you'll skid, damaging the tyres. Just check out the price of a new set! 5 SHOCKS: Some tracks are full of hills and bumps -take them too fast and you'll damage the shock absorbers. 6 WINGS: These are relatively cheap to replace, which means you're at liberty to barge opposing racers off the track. 7 BONNET: Turn too late and you'll career off the track into a road marker, putting a lovely big dent in the front of the car. 8 BOOT: You could be the best driver in the world, but all it takes is some dork to go too fast and you'll end up with a flattened rear. NEIDI SNELLENT With the track designer there's a lot of game to get through. 75 Why not try this course? STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 2010 The winner's podium awaits you! 1981 VERDICT Oo oo IIIIIIIIIII 2222 MISS OK! HIT Cornering is an important part of the game. Y's a shame that the first true race game on the Mego-CD, disregarding the 'inter active' cartoon game Road Avenger, is a bit of a let down. lis red failing is the lack of speed; while it's hardly sluggish, Jaguar XJ220 doesn't match up to Senna's GP. In its defence though, there are loads of tracks to race on and the course designer is excellent. Considering the MegaCD has a top sound chip in it, the engine noises are a sad travesty I've made more realistic roars using a boitle of fizzy pop and my bottom than the sounds which come out of the speaker! Not the greatest race game in the world, but i'll tide you over until something better appears. GARTH SUMPTER 53 "


"REVIEWSRES CUE -243 SNES f44 OUT: August. Contact Elite (0922 55852) for information. It's in there! What a cracker for the Italians! Looking for the best footy game on SNES? You got it! STRIKER With almost every previous SNES footy sim well and truly hitting the woodwork, the field is wide open for Striker to break the back of the net. 1-0 to the lads in the orange shirts! VERDICT here have been a number of footy games released on the SNES, but as you all know they've generally been a load of old cack. There was Super Soccer, which was okay for about ten minutes. Then there was Pro Soccer (the SNES version of the classic Kick Off), which was never alright. Now the oh-so successful Striker of Amiga fame has made the journey from keyboard to cart. Striker presents you with what is the strangest viewpoint since that used in Super Soccer. The pitch is viewed from behind the goal (like Super Soccer), but your vantage point is such that (unlike Super Soccer) whilst you get a perfectly good view when shooting down the screen, the goal does not obscure your view when playing up the pitch. There are absolutely bags of options and the footy action shifts at one helluva pace, certainly a damn sight faster than that git Des Walker! 54 Striker has absolutely everything necessary for a superb game of football and loads of it as well. When you first start playing, it seems like just another Super Soccer-type effort; it's not until you start to explore all the different options that Striker has to offer, that you realise how long you're going to be playing this for. Fun-wise, this is easily the best footy game on the SNES, and whereas that might not sound like much of a brag, I think it's going to be the best sim on the SNES for quite some time to come. Striker has everything; smart graphics, smooth scrolling, great crowd effects (even though the music is awful), superb gameplay and an excellent two-player mode. I would say more about the game, but I'm off to play it... PAUL ANGLIN "


"YOU'LL NEVER BEAT DES WALKER OH, SORRY, YOU WILL REALLY Seeing as here at CVG we're such a bunch of goal-scoring heroes we thought we'd give you a few quick hints on how to hammer your opposition into defeat: Run at the defenders until you get to the edge of the box and they come out to greet you. You will notice that your player on the left is unmarked. Run your player down the wing tight to the line. Run toward the goal, making sure you have plenty of players up with you. When you get just beyond the edge of the 18 yard box, hoof the ball into the area using Y. Using A or Y, play the ball through to the unmarked player. When you get just inside the penalty area, use Y to whack the ball against either the crossbar or the post. Provided your players have got up the field quick enough, there will be one standing in line with the middle of the goal. When the ball reaches your player push toward the top-right corner of the goal and hit A. Use A to tuck the ball well beyond the keeper Into the bottom-right corner of the goal. Use Y to perform either a diving header or an overhead kick beyond the out-of-position keeper. ON THE OTHER HAND \"IT'S A GAME OF TWO HALVES\" SUPER SOCCER This has been around for some time now and is more or less the same as Formation Soccer on the PC Engine. The gameplay is pretty fast and the only real niggle is that when you're playing up the screen your view is somewhat obscured by the goal. The most simple match you can take part in is a friendly game. This is just two countries, one-onone. There are no points up for grabs in a friendly and you can choose who you want to play against from a selection of 64 international teams. This is a good way of getting used to the game and learning how to play without risking the loss of points. If you're really crap, then you can select always choose Brazil and play the Faroe Islands; hey, maybe England could beat them! REVIEWED: CVG No112 A penalty to be offered here, methinks. 55 "


"\"I STILL BELIEVE TAYLOR IS THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB\" P SWALES SNES There are a total of four different joypad configurations, but here's the one we use: R: Changes Y: Overhead kick strategy during the and diving header. game when the X button is depressed. X: Change strategy during game and scan the pitch before taking a free kick. PROS: Highly original viewpoint of the pitch and gameplay is completely addictive, too. CONS: A little too much of the \"ball sticks to your feet syndrome for footy sim fans. Start: Action Replay. A: Autopass. He's free! But can he score? B: Long kick/shoot and tackle. IF THE ENGLAND TEAM CAN PLAY FOR ENGLAND SO CAN I GRAPHICS Well drawn, super-speedy sprites and smooth pitch scrolling. Great in-game effects, tbut the music on the menu is awful. If you want to practice your football skills with no opposition, you can go to the practice mode, which includes a penalty shoot-out, two-player penalties and ball control. The penalty shoot-outs are pretty self-explanatory; it's actually worth practising your penalties because they are used quite regularly. Ball control is just a very simple kickabout, which sees your team and another goalkeeper Kicking the ball around on the pitch and honing their silken skills. What's tops about this option is that you can practice all the best curling shots without any opposition hounding you hurrah! That goalie's taken off! GAMEPLAY Enjoyable, competitive, addictive and totally brilliant in every conceivable way. You won't stop playing this for aaaages. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Holland set up their wall... WADDLE FOR ENGLAND THE FOOTBALL-LOVING PUBLIC Indoor football may not be much of an intemational event, but it is a right old laugh. The good thing is that the rules of standard five-a-side matches do not apply, so you can shoot in the area and hit the ball over head height. The main advantage of indoor football is the fact that the ball can never go out of play. This means that you can really mess your opponents up by bouncing the ball off every wall and tuming it into more of a pinball game than a footy match. The walls actually do help a great deal, because if you break away and there are none of your players up with you, you can use the wall in a one-two and Score an unstoppable goal. Indoor football includes all the competitions that are in the usual football comps, so you're laughing. ...and they've pick up the spare man. Clever lads! VERDICT O-NWOO IIIIIIIIII SNES-owning soccer fans have been gagging for a big dollop of footy fun longer than Graham Taylor's been waiting for a decisive England victory and while he'll have to wait a bit longer, you can just get hold of Striker! Elite has done a grand job of converting the Amiga original, with its excellent 3D viewpoint and well-speedy gameplay. There's a ton of options in there to sui all tastes, and all the rules of the game have been adhered to. I'm a fan of two-player games and Striker is a fine example of just such a game, but that doesn't mean that the single-player option is plops all the SNES-controlled teams are very difficult to beat and you'll have a top time frying. English footy may be doing an impression of English cricket of late, but our national sport is more than well represented by Striker! MISSHIT 93 PAUL RAND 56 "

TEAM 1 TEAM 2 , TENGEN DAVIS CUP Doubles matches are played at a far greater speed than singles; it's bearable if your partner is computer controlled.  TENNIS Diving is often the only way to reach the ball. Unfortunately, the resulting shot is very easy for your opponent to hit. TCATTI TCAT BEL lennis. Now there's another sport that we're not very good at. There was Andrew Castle last year, the first British tennis player to stir up any national pride in the sport since Fred Perry and that was so long ago that even his Tshirts are unfashionable now and what does he do? As soon as he realises he's in danger of winning he throws the match away. This can now be avenged though, without risking injury or paying a million quid for a couple of strawberries and a dollop of Unigate cream. Break out your Megadrive, put on your LaCoste shorts and hit the courts for the challenge of the Davis Cup. re p avis cup For a real challenge try an indoors double match. The pace is ferocious. IS CUP Your doubles partner expresses his disgust at your inability to produce the most basic of shots. If this were real life you could expect a racquet around the head. On professional level you'll need every shot in your arsenal if you want to win. COURT MARTIALLED GRASS CLAY Davis Cup has four different kinds of court, each of which affects the way the ball bounces and what speed the game is played at. HARD INDOOR This is basically the kind of thing you Low but fast bounces are the norm here.

"MAN ON MAN ACTION ON THE OTHER HAND MEGADRIVE AMAZING TENNIS : .99 If it's realism you want this is the place to come. Large graphics, challenging gameplay and an excellent scrolling court make this one of the best Megadrive tennis sims yet. Not as fast as Davis Cup Tennis, but just as playable. REVIEWED: CVG No 140 PROS: Plenty of different shots and lots of tournaments to enter. CONS: Takes ages to get used to the controls and the lesser computer players are really dim. Team 1 TEAM 2 The real action takes place in doubles matches, where you can play any combination of two human and two computer players. It's usually best to have a computercontrolled player on your side as it's highly unlikely that a sad human duo will have the coordination to beat a hundred quid's worth of Sega Megadrive. The Davis Cup isn't the only tournament you can take part in, either. Exhibition matches, for example, are a particularly good source of practice against better opponents. When you think you're good enough you can take on the best the world can throw at you in the doubles challenge mode. You start off with the modest sum of $20,000 which you can spend on training and, more importantly, travel to exotic tennisplaying countries. These tournaments attract the best players, so you'll need to be good if you're going to stand a chance of winning. If you fancy something a little more sedate, there's a neat splitscreen, two-player mode. It's not instantly clear who's in which half, but a quick couple of swings is usually enough for you to make a positive ID of your player. GRAPHICS Small court, but good player animation. TENGEN CUP STENGEN, DAVIS CUP TE . SOUND Occasional sampled speech and crowd noises. The computer player rubs it in that he's good at the game and you're not. TEAM 1 TEAM 2 TAKE IT EASY GAMEPLAY Good training modes and loads of opponents to beat. a game t CUPTERGEVDASCUP TENGENAIS CUP SERGEN TENGER Lots of different play modes to keep you hooked. A . Because of the speed and timing involved, this is a very difficult game to get to grips with initially. Tengen has incorporated several practice modes, the easiest of which has you blatting balls wherever you feel like it, while the next level requires you to spang the ball off targets. You can also practice against a computer-controlled super player who always returns the ball at maximum speed. There's a beginners mode too, where the computer takes care of hassles such as moving your player all! you have to do is hit the ball, which is still tough at the beginning. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 8 Take your player on the road in a bid to beat the world's best players and earn lots of cash in the process. ONWOOCO LLLLLLLLLLLL UTI TUTTI UTILI VERDICT MISS OK HIT A computer player partners a human on either side of the net. There I was, sitting back, moaning about the lack of Megadrive tennis games when all of a sudden two come along within the space of a couple of weeks. There's not much you can do with a tennis game but, when you compare this to Amazing Tennis they're worlds apart. While the latter is ultra-realistic with moderate-paced action, this game goes at 100mph. There's no chance for a breather, and as soon as you complete the tournament you can take your player around the world to challenge the best of the best. Easily as good as Amazing Tennis, better if you're after action as opposed to realism. PAUL RAND . There are all sorts of players, ranging from sad British fasures to super-stick Swedies. 61 "

"REVIEW by SEGA -.99 MEGADRIVE OUT: July. Contact Sega (071 373 3000) for information. Our hero meets the baddies for the first time. Pros: The one-on-one subsection is superb and that's it really Cons: Boring, uninventive gameplay is the order of the day. When your home's been invaded by loads of toxic wasters, there's only one thing to do kick their ass! odkaiser Hell's Steelmask force has launched a relentless attack on Earth, sending the ecosystem hurtling out of control. After years of research, Professor Kabuto was able to develop the first weapon that stood a chance of making any kind of assault against the invaders Mazinger-Z! This bio-army has been specially developed to cope with the huge arsenal of chemical weapons that the enemy will throw at him. The success of the assault is in your hands; good luck. GRAPHICS Master Systemesque sprites run around the boring backdrops. Except for the one-on-one bit which is great. Horrible tunes grate around your TV. But the effects are quite good. GAMEPLAY Very hard but also very dull. Apart from the one-on-one bit; that's great. SCORE FE ROUND 1-2 THE BIG BOSS MEN The most graphically impressive parts of Mazin Wars are the side-viewed Streetfighter II style bits at the end of the levels. At the end of each sub stage (there's three on each level) you'll fight against the end-of-level baddies foot or arm! This is because they're so big. But at the end of the stage you'll be transformed to enormous size and do battle with them. You're both armed with a weapon each; most of the time the boss has two though, and it's a well-hard fight to the death. The animation in this section is on a par with that of Cyborg Justice they are the most fun and very hard. It's a shame the rest of the game's not like this. The whirly move of death. It won't be long before you get bored with the four levels and two final bosses that this has to offer. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES EARRA VS. ROUND 1-3 MOVE ON UP Press the A button for a special attack, just like this one. ONWA UOO VERDICT ull11111 MISS UK At first this seems absolutely awful! But then you realise that it's not quite as bad as you thought. Unfortunately, Mazin Wars never advances beyond the point of above average'. The main game is similar to Golden Axe but with far less action. It's not all bad, though. The animation is so fluid and the moves are really over the top, and when you add the smart sound you really get the feeling that you are a twenty-foot tall hard man knocking seven bells out of a similarly clad bloke. Why wasn't the whole game like this. The Mazinger-Z has been specially designed to deal with the biobeast army and so has been given a large array of moves. Seeing as there are two distinctly different modes of play, there are two different ranges of moves. The A button will perform a special whirling attack which, although it draws on your energy, will wipe out anybody unfortunate enough to get close to you. One of the hardest moves is the spinning slash. Sounds odd? It's dead good. This involves you tapping the joypad twice to make your man run before pressing jump and attack to spin through the air sword outstretched. The moves in the subsections are all pretty simple, so you should be able to work them out for yourself. PAUL ANGLIN "


"MEGADRIVE by SEGA .99 OUT: July. Contact Sega (071 373 3000) for information. Smart backdrops, eh? Aieee! Watch out for those drones. With the distinct lack of decent Mega-CD games available, Sega needs to put all its weight behind cartridges and by crikey has it done so here! he Earth lies completely ravaged by the Great War (strange definition of great, that!). Whole towns levelled, huge forests wiped out, entire races systematically slaughtered and Zig and Zag banned from morning television. (Aieee! The ruthless, heartless gets!), But luckily, in true 2001 style, the people of Earth have come across a strange alien device containing information about the Galaxy with which they can finally get things sorted. One girl, Nina, can make sense of the alien jargon. But she's been kidnapped by the evil Ogiiwise, who have their own ideas for the use of the artifact. But all is not yet lost; Nina's childhood sweetheart, Kenta Kamino, stumbles across the huge assault suit known as Ex-Ranza and finds a nippy rocket-powered, one-wheeled bike (it looks a bit like one of those crappy old Sinclair C5 things). Now he can set off in search of his love and to save mankind, of course. #RANGER-X THE CVG GUIDE TO KICKIN' SPACE ASS Level 1 Level 2 CORDAR 1) Blast his eye until he loses a segment... 1) Blast af his legs and the enemy fails to the ground STAND L ORS 4. 12 Help! It's after me. It's bigger than the one off Arachnaphobia! NEW PAD ON THE BLOCK Ranger-X is one of the first Megadrive carts to make use of the six-button joypad. Originally designed for use with Streetfighter 2, Sega obviously thought they'd give it a bit of a test run before they let it loose on the beat 'em up fraterity. And to be honest, this can't be called anything other than a test run. As great as the game itself is, there's really no justification for using the pad at all. The top row of buttons controls the direction of the bike (the fact that you can also do this with the directional pad must have slipped Sega's mind) and the bottom row fires and tums you around. Although there's really no point in using the pad, it does mean that you get a chance to get used to the feel of it before Streetfighter 2 and Mortal Kombat appear. 2) Then blast at his eye again unul he loses another... 1030000 2) Direct your fire towards the weapons lurret and let loose 3) Then just constantly blast again until the buys it, but watch out for his deadly lasers they hurt The bigger they come the harder they fall. 3) Destroy the last turret and he's toast, boyeee! 64 "


"VERDICT MEGADRIVE Ha! All those people who thought cartridge software was dead and the future lay in CDs, well check this out and eat those words! Ranger-X packs an absolutely huge amount of game into one modest-sized cartridge. As Anglin has already commented, this bears a striking resemblance to Cybernator on the SNES, and as much as I loved that, I'm of the opinion that Ranger-X beats it hands down. It's just sooo bloody fast and hard and addictive and great and brilliant in every way imagineable. Hurrah for Ranger-X and his one-wheeled rocket bike of doom. WELL 'ARMFUL Although as Ranger-X you are only equipped with one basic cannon, there's a variety of differ ent special weapons to collect. You start the game with the flame thrower and bombs, the latter of which are especially helpful if you need to take out a large emplacement from the air they don't take away too much power, either. The flame thrower on the other hand absolutely eats power and isn't that accurate either. But never mind; among the others available to you are thunder, fire and a very powerful wide beam. You'll have to look very hard to find some of these, but that's what this game is all about, so enjoy. PROS: Superb playability, marvellous graphics and attention to detail. You just can't fault this game. CONS: Errm...sorry, we can't find anything really at fault with the game. PAUL RAND PICK ME UP Eye eye. CRAPHICS Brilliantly animated sprites and superb attention to detail in the backdrops. When your energy is getting a touch low you can boost it by finding a refill station. When you find one, simply land your Ex-Ranza in it and watch the energy top up to your delight There is one drawback, however. Using refill stations draws on the power that supplies your special weapons. There are various ways of topping up your power, depending on which level you are on. For example, to fill up your power on the second level simply fly to the roof of the cavern as soon as you appear. You will notice a slight raise on the roof of the cavern. Blast this and light will come flooding through, allowing you to refill. There are numerous spots where you can do this throughout the second level. As for the other levels, you'll just have to find them, won't you. Very loud explosions and dead good thumpin' tracks. ONNOS Whoaa! Baby, cookin' tonight. GAMEPLAY Meticulously planned out, very hard and frighteningly addictive, 0110000 With a game this hard, you'll be blasting for weeks believe me! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Now you've wasted the power supply, the gun's harmless. Mind the trees. CONTROLS VERDICT ONWON START START MISS DK HIT X: Move bike left Y: Uses special weapon when off bike Z: Move bike right A: Fire left/ Turn Ex Ranza to the left B: Uses special weapon when off bike C: Fire right Although Ranger-X has been heavily influenced by other games, it is still one of the hardest blasters you'll play on the Megadrive! It's similar to that of Cybernator apart from one thing it's just so much better! Whereas Cybernator was just a \"hit the fire button and turn off your brain\" kind of game, Ranger-X has had far more thought put into it. You can see that all of the levels have been planned out meticulously with time and effort obviously spent on each. This is one of the best blasters for a very, very long time! 93 PAUL ANGLIN 65 "

"REVIEW AMIGA by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 For more information call Electronic Arts on (0753)549442 00:1:35NC THE GLOBAL PICTURE As a junior executive in a small, highly unsuccessful syndicate, your briefing is to simply achieve world domination for your company. Don't want much, do they? This can only be done by assassinating executives in other corporations and kidnapping their scientists. Instead of risking it all by doing the dirty work yourself, you've got a squad of cyborg assassins cryogenically frozen in your basement who can be thawed out and sent on raids. Apart from the physical alterations, they've each had EESTATE lobotomies so they obey your orders without question. To capture a territory you must first complete its mission goal, which may be as simple as kidnapping an executive or as violent as killing every enemy agent operating there. The game is played in real time, which would make things difficult if it wasn't for the fact that all four agents can be instructed to perform the same action simultaneously, so you're not constantly issuing orders to individuals. pdo au SYNDICATE EVER THINK YOU WERE SOMETHING ELSE? SOMEONE ELSE? SOMEWHERE ELSE? DON'T WORRY... IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD. MISSION DEERXESLAG ONS STORY GA ESTATE ***** Make n the cut and thrust world of highlevel business it's kill or be killed by four men in trench coats armed with mini-guns. This is the world of Syndicate, a world where governments have been replaced by giant corporations who will go to any lengths to stick one over their rivals. Set 80 years in the future, the planet is now divided up into 50 areas, each under the sway of several of these organisations. Your job is to make your corporation the biggest on the planet by wiping out the opposition with your crack squad of android terminators. The only way into this city is by car. Hah, burn enemy agent, burn! VERDICT I had my reservations about this game when I first saw it, expecting it to be nothing more than a glorified Powermonger or Populous rip-off. My fears were soon laid to rest however, this is ace! Not only is it massively original, it's also probably the most violent game ever seen seen. My only criticism is that the graphics are a little too small, but they're bearable. Don't expect out and out action, as a fair bit of strategy is called for. If you can handle that, then get your jaws around this a potential game of the year! GARTH SUMPTER 68 "


"GORE GALORE MAXIMUM DEATH! AMIGA Flame thrower death to the max! The big guns are out in force in this game. In order to stand even the slightest chance of completing the later missions you need to have the, biggest, hardest weapons imaginable. The job of providing you with this kind of heavy-weight kit falls to the Research and Development department, who spend their days trying to come up with new guns for your assassins. The topof-the-line death machines include: MINI-GUN: Spray your enemies with 20,000 rounds a minute! One of the most outstanding aspects of the game are the ultraviolent graphics. Blast someone with a flame thrower, for instance, and their burning body staggers off before crumpling into a smouldering heap. Urgh! When someone buys it their corpse is left where it fell, so if you're in a particularly violent mood the surrounding area looks like a scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Cars can also be hijacked and used. All you have to do is fire a few shots off at one, and the owner will obligingly pull over then run away, leaving the keys in the ignition. There is a drawback though, if the car is destroyed with your people inside, they'll have to be shipped home in an ashtray. PROS:Excellent violence and loads of levels. CONS:The graphics are a little on the small side. Always use your Green Cross Code. DIY TERMINATOR KIT GRAPHICS Brilliant animation and some stunning scenery. GAUSS GUN: Actually, it's a rocket launcher. Take out dozens of people with one shot. If you don't want your agents to go out armed with nothing more than menacing looks, you'll need to come to this screen. Here you buy the weapons, ammo and cybernetic body parts which help turn them into the ultimate killing machines. SPECIAL AGAJ BECKS 6316 No music, but incredible digitised effects. F8 LASER GUN: Cuts through metal, wood and people as if they weren't there. RESEARCK COL UZI: Small, cheap and light. The perfect backup weapon. TEAM moss COULD ACCEPT GAMEPLAY Easy to get into and a good variety of action. FLAME THROWER: Short range, but incredibly deadly. VALUE Over 50 challenging missions to complete. 1 A new brain increases your agent's awareness and ability to take care of himself. 2 With a pair of cybernetic arms your agent will be able to carry even more weapons. 3 A replacement heart increases stamina and overall physical performance. 4 Add an armoured chest to protect the new heart and increase damage resistance. 5 Robotic legs come in handy in those rare situations when you need your agent to leg it from a fight. 6 Your agent's equipment is shown here. Ideally he should have three guns. 7 Click on these to cycle through your currently selected agents. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 9 NONWOOD timum The mission complete screen. VERDICT LILLILLLLLLL LITTTTTT MISS This is what the Terminator should have been! The violence is incredibly over the top, with gallons of blood and loads of explosions. In fact it's probably a bit much for younger gamers, so you've been warned. Considering you're in charge of up to four characters at once, the game is very easy to play, utilising a simple point and click control system. There are over 50 missions to complete, each requiring individual tactics and specially prepared agents. Providing you can handle the violence, you'll be playing this one for a long time to come. Take out cars with your mini-gun. PAUL ANGLIN 69 "

We got 'em! cant few games have reaped as much success across the computer and console board as Prince Of Persia. The superb animation and gameplay set incredible new standards on the Amiga and blew every other animated adventure out of the water! The bad news is that this time round it doesn't look like there's going to be an Amiga version of the sequel for some time. However, the PC offering is already upon us and it's even hotter than a white dwarf's nebular! Swashbuckling Arabian Knight-style adventure, a full cast of dastardly villains and stunning locations abound, so pull up your silk pantaloons, don a turban and set sail for a classic adventure!

PROS:Tons of atmosphere and addictive as hell. Great locations and fiendish puzzles. CONS:Some of the puzzles are a bit obscure and unless you stumble upon the solutions by accident you'll never work them out. Colourful and realistic, subtle and striking! Eventually the bridge collapses: turn before and grab. GRAPHICS Hurrah! Defeated, dumbfounded and deceased. Now finish the level. Yes, nice move BONUS! Now scramble to strategy. MOVE ON UP SOUND A little tinny, but reacts to the action brilliantly. 81 Fabulous digitised traced graphics of flabbergasting realism have splashed back onto your PC! The Prince has learned some new tricks and, along with his brand new threads, he's got even more animation to wow you with. Now, when our hero dangles from ledges he swings backwards and forwards. When you let go will decide where you land and how! The animation is as slick as ever, it's just like having a real person running around inside your computer! Most of the Prince's perilous leaps will require pinpoint accuracy, often resulting in you having to grasp out at thin air to catch the edge of a ledge and scramble up to safety. Breathtaking stuff!

ESTRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Jump for your life! It's the only way out. VERDICT ONWAOOOO LET'S SCRAP! Whereas the original had you fight ing only one baddy at a time, the Prince must now take on nearly triple the amount of enemies in sword-smashing, swashbuckling style often at once! You're thrust straight in at the deep end from the beginning as you smash through the windowed tower of the palace pursued by throngs of royal guards. Draw your glinting scimitar and slash through the opposition to beat a path to your escape. They come from all sides and you'll have to block, party, slash and rasp until you get away. Not all your enemies are even of this world in the underground dungeon stages things get curioser and curioser as piles of bones come to life, turning into bloodthirsty armed skeletons intent on stopping you in your tracks! MISS HIT Prince of Persia was the game that took computer animation into the next dimension and this sequel is everything that the original was and more; animation is still excellent but the graphical detail and variety of the game really excells. Traps are much harder but there's oodles more variety I especially liked the ability to change into Shadow Man and leave your body behind to scoot around without being hit. Broderbound came up with a real winner with POP1 with the sequel, they've really shown that it's possible to improve on perfection. 92 GARTH SUMPTER "


"REVIEW MEGADRIVE MEGADRIVE by DOMARK 44.99 DE 198 DO 06 2 NIP OUT: August. Contact Domark (081 780 2222) for information. Bir.Fr Boldy go where only one Brit goes every 20 years! The Formula One world championship! ith our lad Nige showing those Yanks a thing or two about Indy Car racing, his old rivals are now free to claim his crown. While there's not much we can do about that, there's always F1 which lets you take them on from the comfort of your armchair. The game is an official Grand Prix licence, so Domark have been able to include big name drivers as well as all 12 championship circuits. To give you the edge, your car can have custom tyre, wing and gear settings. So pull on your fireproof gear, get out of the pits and 'cos there's nobody else on the track in head for Formula One world domination! The road ahead looks deserted-probably this practice mode! TWIN TURBO If conquering the Formula One world in Championship mode seems a bit daunting, there's an easier arcade game. Here the object is simply to pass a set number of cars each lap, or be disqualified. If you can dig out a second joypad and a friend, you can enter into some top split-screen, two-player driving action. Player one takes the top half of the screen with the other would be champion at the bottom. For you ultimate sad cases who only pretend to have friends willing to play with you, the Megadrive can even take the place of the second player, although this isn't as much fun because it doesn't respond to threats of violence like your little brother will! 4 MAN OR MOUSE? Top polygon and sprite combined-onscreen action here! If you don't straighten up within a matter of nanoseconds you'll crash-Aileee! LAP No matter how good you think you are at driving games, you'll come unstuck when faced with F1's speed. Because real-life Formula One cars aren't very robust, the game features several idiot modes where the cars are far slower and take a lot more punishment. Even the opposing drivers are nicer, providing plenty of room to overtake them. Only wimps play at this level; real drivers, on the other hand, go for Expert, where the cars are almost twice as fast and just so much as scratch on the paintwork will take you out of the race. Here's where you alter the settings for your car spoiler, gears and tyres. VERDICT F1 is fast enough to have Sonic himself pack his bags and slink off with a disgusted look on his face. There has never been anything quite like this on the Megadrive before. While the two-player game sounds good on paper, it's actually very confusing as you're both up against the computer racers and there's so much happening on screen it's hard to concentrate. The only stupid thing about this game is the way your car rockets into the air when you crash into a sign or another vehicle. Ignore that and you've got one of the best and currently, the fastest race games anywhere. SEGA HIGH MEDIUM LOW MANIAI AUNO HARD MEDIUM SOFT PAUL RAND 72 "


"As you might guess, Anglin's the sad one who's spanged into the barrier. THREE OF THE BEST MEGADRIVE BRE F1's 16 tracks all vary when it comes to difficulty. Some allow you to open the throttle and cruise at 200mph, while others call for precision steering at slow speeds. REPARE Split-screen shenanigans in the F1 twoplayer mode! Puji Japan This is the best track for beginners. The first turn is the worst, so slow down to around 120. You can make up loads of time on the long straight before you hit the start line. FUJI 1227 PROS: The fastest thing you'll see on Megadrive all year. CONS: Few thrills and no frills apart from the basic driving game. REPARE Barcelona Spain Tougher than Fuji, but still in the little league. The straight isn't very long, but there are plenty of wide turns which are perfect for overtaking. TERLAGOB Your car's about had it so it's time to slip into the pits. WELL GRAPHICS Plain vectors, but boy are they fast! SPRE tene EPHES Monte Carlo Monaco Only the best of the best compete here. It doesn't matter how good your car is, skill is the winner when it comes to the narrow streets of the world's most testing track. HER Para TELE2 Ooh, nice bit of overtaking there and right beside the grandstand, too! ONDOS Nice passing noises and throaty exhaust note..  MPH GOODBYE AYRTON GAMEPLAY As real as you can get without being there. 2 All the major Formula One drivers are featured in F1, except for Aryton Senna who's locked up in Sega's licensed characters vault. Along with these is the complete Grand Prix circuit which includes such notable tracks as Silverstone and Monaco. All have been reproduced from maps of the originals, so you can expect the same kind of challenge that real F1 drivers face. You begin on each track almost blind to what lies ahead of you. All you're shown is a map which gives no indication as to the type of devious turns that are in store for you. It just so happens that you're given unlimited attempts at qualifying for each race, so the first few laps can be taken at a snail's pace while you learn the course. Could have done with more features. JOYPAD JAPERY Up Gear up Right Steer right C Call for a pit stop Left Steer left BO Brake STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 9 Down Gear down A Accelerate GRID LOCK ONWAOVO ILILIIIIIII VERDICT Sio HIT You're probably thinking to yourself that this doesn't look particularly impressive, and you're right. There aren't many roadside objects, and few thrills, because the game excels in another area speed. This baby is fast. One minute you're sitting on the grid, a second later the mechanics are pulling your mangled car out of the first turn. As if it wasn't fast enough already, there's a super high-octane turbo mode included in F1 to contend with. Here the game does away with most of the car's display so the whole caboodle runs much faster. You also get to see more of the track, which is dam useful as the game runs about 20% faster. Fl came from nowhere to the shelves in the blink of an eye, displaying the sort of speed that the game will be renowned for. It's faster than a turkey on the 4th of July! Graphics are simple to keep the speed high but unfortunately courses are spartan nothing actually has any roadside scenery other than chevrons and the odd bridge. This also means that accuracy of the different circuits has been compromised I don't remember any three-lane stretches in Monaco! What isn't compromised is the sheer speed of the game! It's blisteringly fast -perfect for any speed freaks out there! 86 GARTH SUMPTER 73 "

"by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 | REVIEW GY ELECTRONIC ARTS _ 20,9 TENHINONTACT MEGADRIVE SI 62 GREERS You don't get a bodyguard on this level, you're on your own against an army of metallic mutants. PROS: Plenty of spells and interaction between characters during the levels. CONS: Way too slow. If the characters had zimmer frames then the game would be believable. ABRACADABRA Colourful backgrounds and large, clear sprites. RA You play Ronin, prince of the wizards. He's armed with loads of neat spells, and should they fail he also has a pointy stick. In practical terms the stick is usually more effective than any spell, although you have to get close to a target to use it, by which time you could well be wearing one of their sharpened robot appendages. There are nine offensive spells ranging from a meagre fireball to a smart bomb which will kill anything unlucky enough to be on-screen. He also has a few boring spells such as teleport, which will take him back to his buddies for a bit of chin wag. GRAPHICS ucked away in a backwater galaxy is the Inner Realm, where a recent spate of technological advances have almost put paid to traditional magic. But things have started going wrong and mysterious, evil half-robot, half-flesh creatures have started appearing. With a battle cry of 'We told you so', the magicians leap into action and prepare to deal with this mechanised threat once and for all. SOUND Decent music and plenty of zappy sound effects. 80 EPTERITERNATERIEEEPIE lalable GAMEPLAY Bloody slow, and that's an understatement. # Your mates are always on hand with helpful hints. It's a shame they can't actually be bothered to pick up a gun and help you. Will last, simply because it takes so long to complete each stage. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES At the end of the level you're confronted by a rather sappy little metal guy. He soon dies a fiery death at your hands. Occasional hidden rooms such as this one contain bonus health and invulnerability icons. MUTANT MANIA The mutants have no truck with this magic business, preferring to arm themselves with exceedingly large rocket launchers. Ronin doesn't take much damage from direct hits thanks to his bullet-proof cloak, but they eventually take their toll towards the end of the level. The only way he can replenish his energy is by tracking down special healing spells, although they're usually tucked away on hidden screens and bonus levels. These caves aren't up to much. Just walk, shoot and carry on to clear the very pathetic nasties which appear. IIIIIIIIII VERDICT ONWAVO LIITILI MISS OK! HIT For some reason this style of game is really popular in Japan, with titles like Nobunaga and His Ninja Force topping the charts. Technoclash is stupidly slow. It's a sort of zen shoot 'em up where you wander along with enough time to line up each shot and avoid the slow bullets which are fired at you. Had there been more to kill and faster action, this would have been a game worth playing. As it stands it's not worth buying. 50 GARTH SUMPTER Farrg comes in really handy on this level. Just leave him alone and he'll expend vast amounts of ammunition shooting at every. thing that moves. 75 "


"SNES by INTERPLAY .99 OUT On import. Contact ACE Consoles (071 439 1185) for information. AFTER THE STUNNING ANOTHER WORLD. HOW WILL INTERPLAY FOLLOW IT UP? WITH TH ANOTHER GAME THAT TAKES PLACE OFF THIS PLANET, PERHAPS? PILLAGE THE VILLAGE There are a horde of different items available to help the Vikings find their way home. Here's the complete list: FOOD: Heals one health point The Lost Vikings STEAK: Heals two health points. SHIELD: Gives a Viking a bonus blue health point. BOMBS: You can drop them anywhere you like to blow up something. SWITCHES: These will open doors when they are operated. FLAMING ARROWS: Kills an enemy with just one shot. KEYS: Used to unlock doors of the same colour. GRAVITY BOOTS: Lets a Viking walk in a gravitane day a year, the Viking village would celetional field. brate the full harvest with contests of bravery BUTTONS: Used in many and skill and a grand feast at dusk. The hunt places to activate things, like opening doors. was the most popular event and when Olaf, TARGET: Acts like buttons Erik and Baleog failed to show for it, the village people but must be shot by decided to just carry on without them. The three Baleog to activate. brothers heard the hunting horn sound all the way back at their hut and rushed into the woods immediately. Unknown to the three lads the notorious intergalactic zookeeper, Tomator, was hovering above the forest in his space craft. As the three walked home from the hunt, they failed to notice the large object which had now settled directly above their village. Suddenly, all three brothers were beamed up to Tomator's craft but luckily there was a short circuit and, instead of landing in the specimen room, they were dumped in the corridors of Tomator's ship. Now the Vikings must begin their epic journey and find their way home. DO YOUR LEVEL BEST GOOD BACON VERDICT The Vikings certainly know how to get lost in style. They're not just slumming it in the windy corridors of a nearby shopping centre or the local zoo, oh no. These lads have gone and found themselves lost in the middle of five different locations. The action starts off in Tomator's space craft and once the boys have found the portal their journey really begins. First of all they are zapped into ancient caverns full of slimy, erm, things and dark corridors even the odd, dinosaur! If they make it out of there it's on to ancient Egypt where the lads are attacked by a whole host of things including the odd mummy or two. The next destination is just a huge machine that the lads have to navigate past. This stage is full of moving conveyor belts, pounding iron rods and other such nasties. This leads on to what can almost be described as the set of the bathroom level in Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt. This area is laden with spiked pits and bouncy springs great care is needed here. In the final level, before the man himself, the Danish trio are back aboard Tomator's craft to finally do away with the madman, which is easier said than done, believe me. CHARACTERS: These are th lost Vikings. They are: Olal, Buleog and Erik LIFE METERS: INVENTORIES: This is where These three red you keep all of the items dots represent you pick up. To use them the Vikings' press Select and move the energy. When cursor to the desired item They are all and press X to use it. and bresco to gone, il's time WASTE RASVET WASTE BASKET: You can to board the dump any unwanted burning bout. items in here. Interplay knows how to produce good SNES games; Another World was a top treat and Lost Vikings is a bit spesh, too. Most people would retch at the mention of puzzle games, but Lost Vikings has a unique style. The three Norsemen have their own personalities and skills, requiring you to look after them all and on later levels that's VERY difficult. Lost Vikings is well presented, with good graphics and fab gameplay it takes a little while to get into, but once you're in you'll find it hard to want to get back out. PAUL RAND 76 "


"SNES LOOT THE TOWN PROS: Supremely addictive puzzler with some nicely detailed character sprites. CONS: The first few levels are a bit easy, but that's about it really The Lost Vikings are essentially a very sound unit; each uses his own special skill to get the team through the levels. Here's a look at them all: NAME: Erik the FAVOURITE BANDS: Swift Rush AGE: 19 FAVOURITE MEAL: HEIGHT: 5'8\" Fast food FAVOURITE PETS: WEIGHT: 160lbs Cheetah, Jaguar SPECIALTY: and Falcons.

HOBBIES: Body building, knite throwing and bowling. GOALS: World domination, And bowling league champion. FAVOURITE EXCIA MATION: Yo! FAVOURITE BANDS: Aerosmith. STRENGTHS: Baleog can attack with his sword and shoot arrows. He can also use arrows to activate switches. WEAKNESSES: Not yet mastered the art of defence. Therefore he usually hides behind Olaf's shield during battles. NAME: Olal the Stout AGE: 23 HEIGHT: 6'2\" WEIGHT: 320lbs SPECIALTY: Defence, aeronautics and comedic relief. EQUIPMENT: Shield, belly (it doesn't have a patch on Rand's though Anglin) and a silly laugh.

Jump on these to get to the top and grab the key GAMEPLAY Draws you in then attacks you with meticulously thought-out puzzles. That's a loooong fall. It'll easily take you fifty quids worth of days to finish this. GO ON. GIVE US STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Look out for the stompers of doom. VERDICT ONWAMOV IIIIIIIIIIII On the earlier levels of Lost Vikings there are boxes with question marks in them. No, it has nothing whatsoever to do with Mariothese are hint boxes. By walking up to them and pressing A, you will be told something about that particular level or the game in general. The information you get is usually pretty useless, such as \"Push up or down to move the lift up or down\" hey, earth shattering breakthroughs Rus, mate, Although the info is often crap, it's worth using the boxes so you can work everything out quicker. There are also a few aliens that you can talk to; these are essential as some of them will reveal how to complete levels and some will make a sad attempt at humour as well, but never mind, eh? Okay, so I'm not the world's biggest puzzle fan, but if a good one comes along I'll play it sure enough. This cart avoids all the long windedness and lack of action seen in previous puzzlers and gives you something that certainly stacks it head and shoulders above everything else in its class. The humour (be it a little dry) is so disfracting and the smatterings of action really make you forget you're playing a puzzle game. Marvellous music, the little digitised \"Hit it!\" is great, and a top cart all round. MSS OK HIT 90 PAUL ANGLIN 77 "


"REVIEW MEGADRIVE by SEGA .99 OUT: On import. Contact Dream Machines (0429 869459) for information. O.LEAGUE PRO STRIKER 27-1 Beautiful two-man foul there. A great chip over the defender. After the all-conquering Super Kick Off on Megadrive, is there any room for another footy sim? Apparently so... CEHO FOUL Who will get there first? FT BEM 0 Aw, come off it ref. FOUR PLAY Wahey! Lord Emap is letting us go home early. J.League is the first M Jadrive game to use the four layer adaptor. The adaptor is just a black box that plugs into either joypad port and allows you to plug four standard Megadrive controllers into it. You can also have a fi th player plugged into the remaining joypad port in future five plaver games. The options you can hoose from with the adaptor armany and varied; you can havwo players controlling one tean (the team is split in two and eac player controls one half it's a tle complicated at first but yo soon get the hang of it), or four oferent teams each controlled by a human player. The fun you get when there are four of you playing at once is incredible and you can guarantee this one will keep you the most popular lad in the neighbourhood for aaagess. hat's the J.League then? Is it the FA's new \"Super-advanced Makes More Money Than The Rest division?\" No, not quite. It's the Japanese version of the Premier League. Yes, even those wacky Japs like to pull on their shooting boots and get out there on the pitch to slam a few past the best of them in fact, it's so popular down there that even our very own Gary Lineker is doing it! J.League is an attempt to combine the simple arcade feel o feel of footy games with the realistic simulation that Kick Off fans love so dearly. The game has been spared of too many options to keep the action simple and easy to get in to. So does it 31:39 break the back of the net, or is it another for Graham Failure to sit and wonder what might have been? Read on... The Grampus Eight midfield is back pedalling. FIU 1 2 GRA STAY IN FORMATION As with all footy games you can choose the formation of your squad and pick the substitutes according to who's fit and who isn't. Unfortunately it's all in Japanese so it's not really an easy thing to do. The formations are not quite what you or I are used to. There's no 4-24 system, no 5-3-2 attacking play; they're all strange and foreign in J.League. Japanese formations are as follows: 3 top, 2 top, 2 back, sweeper, S.American and Bundes Leaguer. To you and me those formations (or as close as they get to our versions anyway) are: 3-3-3-1, 2-31-3-1, 3-2-3-2, sweeper system you know, 3-2-32 and 2-2-3-3. These are all very odd systems but you soon get used to them. When you're selecting your formation, you get to see how the other team is lining up so you can counter their tactics maybe Graham Taylor should try it. \"CONTROL THE BALLIT ocy Slide tackle/shoot Pass/shoot Change player under control/pass I was only kiddin' when I said on me ead. "


"WHAT A MOVER The keeper prepares to hoof the ball down the field. VERDICT STUSES TRIKER The huge amount of Japanese text put me off J.League at first but once got playing, ooh, what a fine game. On paper the graphics don't appear to be anything special but when you see them moving they are absolutely stunning; the fluid running motion, the superb attention to detail when a player chests the ball down for a volley is incredible. Don't expect to be winning games eight-nil for a while; in fact, don't expect to be winning games at all for a while. J.League will take you a little time to get into but it's well worth persevering as it reaps such huge rewards. Once you begin to master the game you'll discover what is easily one of the best footy sims around. If you like your football fun-packed and with four players, you can't go wrong with this. It's a good ball into the box, but will he reach it in time? PAUL ANGLIN The most stunning part of J.League Soccer is the superb animation of the sprites. The way the players move and run down the pitch is a sight to behold; most footy games just settle for the same old movements with the player kicking the ball with completely the wrong part of his foot, but not J.League. The players kick the ball with the outside of their feet, use their chests to bring the ball down, chip with the end of their boots and perform some of the most fluid overhead kicks I have ever seen. Apparently this superb animation was achieved by a player from Jef United performing all the different moves (I bet it took him a few goes to get the overhead right) using a technique called rotoscoping (which is how the animation in Prince Of Persia and The Terminator was achieved). Good, eh? Here are the Japanese line-ups; strange, aren't they? PD03 D 2TOP EDEL READY SWEEPER S AMERIBAN B-LEAGUER SPULSE 2P READY STUDS. AH, GREAT GOAL RINEKER SAN! It may take a while for you to get the hang of scoring in J.League so here are a few methods we prepared earlier, 1970 TITO Play it through to the unmarked player. Whack the ball up the field toward your attackers. and score. Then run at the goal... AH, RINEKER SAN The J.League, as I'm sure you'll have realised, is the official Japanese Professional Soccer league comprising of ten different teams, ranging from Jef United to the Lineker-inhabited Grampus Eight. Each team consists of 16 members and each player has his own profile which includes such information as previous clubs and goals scored and all that kind of stuff; it's just a shame that it's all in Japanese really. Still, there you go. Take it down on your chest and run with it. SS Hoof the ball into the centre. 2015 ...and score. TERNI D SU REDU ILEAGUESTO SENERATORER JLEAGUE at FAST Then use A or B to slam into the corner. Catch it on the volley and send it flying toward the goal. Ooh, what a spawny get! 79 "


"VERDICT MEGADRIVE LEAGUE ET Too right! As the Canvey Kid said, this game takes one helluva long time to get into. The Megadrive joypad isn't the most comfortable beast to get to grips with at the best of times, but with this game you're going to wear holes the size of Cortinas in your hands. The players move very laboriously and when you play the imported version on a British machine they're about as fast as a three legged tortoise with athlete's foot! Pity, 'cos the animation of the footballers slidetackling, heading and volleying is superb, Once you've got used to the controls and the (lack of pace of the game it's pretty good, but unless you grew up in downtown Tokyo or have a doctorate in Japanese wait for the official version. Can they get to the rebound in time? 1 SPU PROS: Superb animation and great (not to mention addictive) gameplay. CONS: It's chock full of Jap text. And a bit slowmoving. STEVE KEEN Errm...er...this one's not really very interesting is it? EE AY WE'RE GONNA WIN THE CUP GRAPHICS Marvellously fluid animation and great attention to detail on the sprites. 36:32 U SPU 1-1 GRA Pretty good thumps when you whack the ball and great crowd noises. One of the tournaments you can take part in is the J.League Cup, which can be either a four or eight team tournament. Basically you select your teams and then enter a knockout competition to win the hallowed J.League Cup. In the Cup tournament obviously you can use the four player adaptor and have all four of your mates the tournament for some multi-competitor fun and japes. That's off I'm afraid, guys. GAMEPLAY Hard to get into but incredibly rewarding once you do. What a marvellous save! 22:58 TIME SPU GRA EGA JJLEAGUE You'll be playing this for a very long time, especially with the four player adaptor. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES THE J.LEAGUE The ultimate challenge in J.League is of course to enter the J. League itself, which consists of ten teams competing in a normal football season. Seeing as there aren't many teams the season is relatively short but the competition for the league championship is fierce. As with all decent footy sims J.League has a save option so that you can save your position in the league table, only we haven't quite been able to work it out yet as it's all in Japanese, but never mind we're sure someone will get the hang of it eventually. 9 8 B ox ECE ONWAGO llllllllllll OK ON THE OTHER HAND SS OK HIT SUPER KICK OFF Super Kick Off has been available for a couple of months now and it's still selling like crazy. W the sheer realism of Kock Off doesn't get you then the adrenalin pumping speed of the action will. There are oodles of options to play around with and there's enough game here to keep you occupied for months on end. 88 HOPEM REVIEWED: CVG No 136 Arrgh! Help! This wind's bloody strong. 80 "

GRAPHICS SOUND KIRBY'S ADVENTURE 99 89 STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES rguably the cutest character on the planet, Kirby makes a welcome appearance on the 8-bit Nintendo! Basically, Kirby looks like a hairless Kiwi, only far more appealing. Because he's so nice, he doesn't carry any of the hard weapons that are common to most games, instead he relies on his amazing digestive powers, which let him convert nasties to natural to gas by swallowing them, allowing him to inflate and fly or blow fireballs. Each level contains loads of substages, in which Kirby ends up in some really bizarre situations. One even has you trying to dig him out Uh-ho-better watch your step around here; it could get nasty. 10 6 ONWAO OCO TITUUT He was great on Game Boy and now Kirby's neat on NES! of one of those fairground rip-off machines where you use a claw to grab a cheap fluffy toy! This game is so massive that it comes with a battery-save feature, so you don't have to take down loads of mindbending codes. Kirby's has so many elements, sublevels and general cuteness that it really is an unmissable game. My only criticism is that the main sprite is too small and as such tends to get lost during the more hectic levels. Definitely the best NES game so far this year. REVIEW NES .99 by NINTENDO OUT: Now.

MEPLAY GRAPHICS 33 MEGAMAN STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Down in the depths with baddies galoreMegaman's got his work cut out! Megaman's arch enemy, the evil Dr Wily, has returned, this time with an army of lunatic construction droids with dodgy names such as Ring Man (blimey! Ed). Each one has his own domain, populated with bizarre half-human, half-robot creatures which include the massive pyramid of Pharaoh Man and the dirty domain of Trash Man. Fortunately for the Mega one, his suit allows him to soak up the majority of enemy bullets while dishing out plenty of shots of his own. It also allows him to pick up the weapons left behind when nasties are destroyed, although due to the miniscule size of the graphics they all look the same when you use them. He also has an R-type style super beam weapon O-NWANOV TILLITTIILI This seems a little fishy! which is powered up by holding down the fire button; the problem is there's hardly ever enough time to do so as the second you stop firing the nasties take the opportunity to steam you. There have been better platform shoot 'em ups, although few are as varied as Megaman 4. Kirby's is the better game, but if you have the cash to spare then this is a good second purchase. 83 Oh dear, it's rather dark down here. I don't like the dark, me. Boo hoo. 87 "

SUPER CONFLICT SOUND Fancy a slice of strategy, Gulf War-style? section are very basic but the icons are clear enough and it's easy to see what's going on. Battle scenes break up the action quite nicely and give you a good breather from all the statistics of the manoeuvring section. The amount of info you need has been kept to a minimum so as not to get you bogged down with numbers. The difficulty level is nicely graded so you spend the first few scenarios getting used to the icons and the idea of the game, and then you get into some serious combat. The verdict on this one is really very simple: if you like strategy games you'll love this, if you don't forget it!

We've had Desert Strike; now for another game based loosely around that limited skirmish in the Middle East some time back. Super Conflict steers away from previous \"kill everything and kill it now\" type efforts, in favour of a far more strategic effort. You start off with initial contact with the enemy, then you have to fight through 55 different scenarios to get to the evil dictator and wipe him out before he ruins the world with his twisted plans. You are given an overhead view of the desert. The land is divided into hexagons, and both sides are given a number of different armed units, from the Infantry to the Commandos and the beefy Sheridan tanks. The idea is that you have to take over the enemy's forces and destroy their flag tanks or their flag ships. Now one thing that you must know about Super Conflict is that it is an out and out strategy game! It's a cross between a board game and a video game, with the odd battle scene.

"THE Complete guide. PART 2 few tanks on the ground and a load of enemies will drop in from the skies on parachute these are easily killed with one shot. Well, you've done about half of the level; it's about time your inept wing man got himself in trouble, and without fail you've got to save Peppy's ass already. You will soon see a few more arches; there's no reward for going through these, so it's up to you if you chance it. The next tank you come across on your left will release a Nova Bomb when shot. Then it's just a few more wimpy little minions until the Battle Carrier arrives on the scene. DIFFICULTY LEVEL BATTLE CARRIER V2 The long-haired girlie fop, known only as Steve Keen was the first to make it thus far, and as a result, sad Rand's gone off into the corner to throw a strop and find a fat lass. Anyway, here's a quick tip from the man Keen: Difficulty level 2 is dead easy, provided you keep your wits about you and don't rush anything. STAGE CORNERIA SHIEL Hit the Battle Carrier in these weak spots to kill it. Talk about easy! The Battle Carrier V2 uses exactly the same tactics as the first one except it fires a little more than before! To defeat it just use exactly the same method as with the original, as explained in last month's guide. STAGE SECTOR X The blaster power-up will appear here if you fly through all the arches. Ooh blimey, look, it's the very first level again. Well it's not really, but it might as well be. The differences between this and Corneria on the previous difficulty level, are almost non-existent. The first thing that's worth mentioning are the UFO towers. You will come across two of these. Just shoot them at the top and they'll explode. Next you will come across a bundle of satellite dishes on the ground, there's no point in destroying these, other than you get a few extra points for it. Then it's time to grab a blaster power-up. As on the first Corneria level, all you have to do is fly through the arches and a blaster power-up will appear at the huge door. After this, there will be a SHIELD To get past the girders, use your brakes to slow right down, then you can judge where you can get past. Shoot these things as soon as they appear as they spew fireballs and cause you all kinds of hassles. "


"The first thing you'll come across are a few little ships that will attack from the bottom of the screen; provided you picked up the twin blaster power-up on Comeria, you should make light work of these. Next you will enter the construction part of the level. This is the main part of the level and it's bloody hard! For the first few series of girders, you're pretty safe passing between them. You can get through the tightest of gaps by turning your Airwing fighter on its side and flying through. Next though, you'll have to be very alert to get through the spinning girders of doom. To get past these, hit the brakes as you near them and you should be able to safely negotiate your way past them. There are plenty of power-ups hidden in the girder maze including a shield and blaster power-up. Now it's time for a taste of combat again. There's a few of those hour-glass ships and a couple of those horrible spinning ones that spit fireballs in every direction. If you picked up both blaster power-ups you'll have no problems wasting them but the really hard bit will follow girders come at you from above and beside you! You have to use your brakes to get through here but avoid using all of your brake power as, when you do this, your craft will shoot forward and you will be without brakes for a few seconds which could spell disaster. If you make it through this it's on to the Rock Crusher. This place is more baron and isolated than Canvey Island at 4.00 on a Sunday morning. The dodgy weather conditions make it hard to see what's going on. Firstly, look out for the spinning ice blocks the best way top avoid these is to cheat and fly over the top of them. For the first part of this level you'll be flying through the gaps in the rocks (which is a damn sight harder than it sounds) and wasting the scout walkers that appear. When approach the spinning blocks, you have two choices: you can either shoot them and pass through as it rotates, or you can cheat and fly over the top. However, if you intend to fly over the top you'll have to start climbing early otherwise you won't be able to get high enough to clear them. Don't bother yourself with shooting the spinning diamonds on the surface 'cos if you do they'll flip up and whack you. From here on you'll be facing crabs and hangars. Crabs are easily disposed of, just blast away at their legs and they'll soon find it a little difficult to stand! When you approach the hangars, you will see three doors. The one on the left, houses a Nova bomb, the middle one has a blaster power-up and the one on the far right has the weather control unit behind it. These goodies appear behind the hangars until you get the weather control until, so this is a good chance to top up your arsenal. To open the doors shoot them and they will constantly open and shut, meaning you'll have to use your brakes to get through unscratched. When you get the weather control unit the blizzard will stop and normal weather will be restored to the planet, unleashing loads of fair-weather tanks and helicopters for you to destroy. Many tanks will release a yellow power-up ring! when shot. The crabs tanks and helicopters will continue to attack in a non-frightening fashion until you reach the end-of-level baddie Prof. Hanger. ROCK CRUSHER Here are the Rock Crusher's weak spots, blast away at them to kill it. Ooh look this is exactly the same as the original Rock Crusher! The only difference is that the weak spots stay uncovered for less time, meaning you have to shoot quickly, but if you picked up the blaster power-ups, you're well sorted. STAGE Shoot Professor Hanger here to kill him. PROFESSOR HANGER To get past the spinning ice blocks, shoot them to make them spin, then hit your brakes and fly through the gap with a monster boost from your retros Alternatively just fly over the top of them, but remember that sometimes there are bonuses for going through them. If you are going to fly over them, you'll have to pull up early to get over them, as they're very tall! This guy is probably the easiest guardian in the entire game. After the Professor has said his farewells you will find yourself in a long tunnel surrounded by water. Blast all the flying fish and as soon as the Prof appears, fire a Nova Bomb. This guy's so soft that there's no real strategy needed simply blast away at him. Provided you're armed with anything above standard blasters you'll make metal mincemeat out of him. STAGE SECTOR Y Grab the weather control unit to return the planet's atmosphere to normal. Left: Shoot the squid when it turns away from you to kill it. Right: Tap the L or R button twice to roll your ship and shake off any amoebas that cling to your ship. "


"DO NOT shoot the large stingray! If you do, he will constantly crash into your ship until you die! If you manage to avoid all of the stingrays, a large whale will appear just before the end-of-level guardian; this absolutely spews bonuses and makes the Plasma Hydra a doddle to kill. Right from the off you'll find yourself under fire from every ship imaginable as well as a load of missiles fired from the planet's surface. There are also some horrible triangular ships which cannot be shot until they turn around to face you. It usually pays to avoid them as they spray out deadly pieces of shrapnel when they explode. Things become even more hectic now as Andross chucks everything he possibly can at you. Next on the hit list are two minefield blocks which can be shot or avoided, and there's a bonus energy ring inbetween them. Shortly after this a thin ship appears in the middle of the screen; you won't have seen many of these before, but if you shoot it you'll become invincible hurrah! It's essential you get this as literally everything is thrown at you in the next few seconds. Survive this and it's on to the awesome metal smasher. SHIELD METAL SMASHER Weird central. This level's smaller than one of Garth's crazy spur-ofthe-moment ideas, and believe me, they take some beating. It's a bit hard to find any real way to tip this stage but here's a rough guide to beating it. Firstly, shoot all the different ships that are launched at you and remember, the squids can only be shot when they are facing away from you as they have a shield at the front. The really annoying bit in this level is the mean space amoeba attack. These cannot be shot and if they latch onto your ship they'll suck horrendous amounts of your energy away. To throw them off, roll your ship by pressing the Ror L buttons twice. You're best to just roll through the entire section to make absolutely sure that they don't attach to your ship. Next you come across a load of odd creatures called stingrays. Never shoot the big one or he'll turn around and ram into your ship until you're dead. To avoid the smaller yellow stingrays, shoot them and they will turn blue and fly away. A large whale appears at the end of the level if you avoid all the big stingrays shoot it full of holes to get loads of bonuses. sr PLASMA HYDRA Hit the Metal Smasher here to finish it off. Now this guy is hard! Big bird can only be damaged by shooting its arms and the damage will transfer into its body. Keep shooting the arms until they blow off allowing you to concentrate on the main part of the body. The main point of this guardian is to keep dodging and rolling to avoid its flailing arms. If these hit you, they'll take away half of your energy so be careful. This thing is totally deadly. It comes in two halves, which join together to form a deadly crushing machine. For once it's worth listening to Slippy shoot at the very centre of the pods to cause the most damage. It's usually worth blowing a few Nova Bombs here, although save at least one for later. Concentrate your fire on one half at a time rather than switching from one part to the other. Fire your boosters to escape when he moves towards you, hit the brakes and carry on firing. When he flips over to a horizontal position he'll chuck out loads of lasers and missiles which have to be avoided. If you kill this guy then you really deserve to be part of the Airwing tean STAGE VENOM SURFACE SHIELD Shoot the Plasma Hydra at the ends of his arms to kill it. STAGE VENOM SHIEL There's no real point in trying to shoot the tanks that appear you're better off losing them using a combination of retros and brakes. Watch out for the shrapnel that flies around when you kill these. If you'd rather avoid them, just hit your retros and fly straight past them. Traditional combat's blown out of the window as the enemy craft try to ram yours. Forget about being able to shoot them all 'cos they move too darn fast. The best way to keep out of trouble is to use a combination of brakes and boosters. There's not much more you can say about this level, except that it's very similar and very, very hard. Good luck you'll need it. 96 "


"GALACTIC RIDER Fly through all of these arches to get... SHIEI Shoot the Galactic Rider here when the hatch opens up ...this Start off by shooting at the centre, while keeping an eye out for the hover bikes it launches. Next, fire a Nova bomb into the small gap in the guardian. The moment the hatch closes he'll try to crush you, so get ready to move fast. Keep blasting away at that hatch it takes a long time, but it pays off. Honest! This stage isn't very different to its previous incarnations. The archways are positioned at slight angles, but if you're careful they won't pose any problems. There are two different power-ups in the hangers; on the left is a twin blaster, while on the right is a Nova bomb. After that come the same baddies that feature in the previous two Corneria levels, only more vicious. When you get through the city you will come across a network of tunnels if you take the righthand one you'll gain another Nova bomb. Loads of droids appear just before the Attack Carrier. Each one carries a piece of the guardian, which can be shot with some difficulty. The last hazards are loads of falling blocks hidden by buildings. Avoid these by staying low and using your boosters. ANDROSS ATTACK CARRIER Aim for the red core which is beneath the domes. When you've taken out all three, aim for the power cones Hold on to your Nova Bombs as you'll need them on the later levels. x2 ENEN SHIELD Hit Andross here to waste him. As you would expect, the second version of Andross is a darn sight harder than the first. This time he has protective panels over his eyes (eyelids, I believe they're called). If you've got a good weapon you'll be able to get through them a lot quicker. Fire a Nova bomb into the centre of the screen when you've destroyed the lids then hammer away with laser fire. Hit the attack carrier here to kill it. STAGE ASTERIODS DIFFICULTY LEVELL STAGE CORNERIA o, you want to try level three, eh? I suppose you'll be wanting some help then? All I can say at this point is if you get into trouble keep rolling your ship. You can't aim properly, but the missiles won't hit you. When you blast the wedge ships, look out for the explosion of fireballs. 97 "


"The first things you face are large pollen-spitting plants which can't be destroyed, so spin to avoid them. Aim for the ground emplacements otherwise there'll be too many bullets to avoid. Duck aliens and sea dragons also appear so be ready for them. There's an invincibility power-up between the hoops of the second monster-collect it to make life a lot easier. Next up are the dragons' heads which churn out long streams of fireballs. Avoid these by ducking and diving and popping off the occasional shot at their heads. Further on is another power-up, followed by more flowers, ground-based missile sites, larger flowers, pillars and insects. There's also a blaster powerup in the fourth hoop. ATOMIC DRAGON This pick-up is invaluable, but you'll have to be quick to get it. Once again, there's not much difference between this and the previous asteroid level bar a few new baddies. The biggest of these is a squadron of ships which look like spinning tops. Although they're easy to kill, they have a tendency to explode at random, spraying fireballs all over the shop. Some of the asteroids have faces just like the entrance to the black hole on the first asteroid level: these are dupes and spell instant death if you hit them. To clear the last section of this level, keep rolling left and right to avoid the asteroids and shoot the fighters which lurk in the debris. There's also an extra life just after the large piece of scaffolding so you'll have an unlimited amount of tries at the boss. SPINNING WAR MACHINE Hit the Dragon here to kill it. ENEMY To deal with this scaly beast you have to shoot its neck and tail. but the catch is he's only vulnerable when facing you. Roll left and right to avoid his tail when he flies around the screen, after which he'll waddle off. Now move to the centre of the screen and launch a Nova Bomb as soon as he turns to face you. Keep shooting his heads as he approaches, then duck out of the way at the last minute and keep firing at his back when he retreats. After a few hits his neck and tail will shrink, and If both are short enough, try blasting the body. If it flashes you can now blast him to bits. If the tail bulges it means he's about to lay an egg. When this hatches the baby dragon will come charging at you. After that keep working on the dragon's body and watch out for his fireballs. It shouldn't take you too long beat him. Hit the War Machine here to kill it. STAGE SECTOR Z This bloke's really sneaky. He's absolutely covered in mirrors, which deflect all your shots back you! Try to have the fireball power-up by this point, as they don't damage your ship when they're bounced back. Destroy each leg in tum. Stop firing when the top section starts spinning and roll left and right to avoid the missiles and webs it launches. If you get trapped by a web, fire your boosters and press the left and right buttons to escape. Only use Nova Bombs when the top's stationary, otherwise they won't do any damage. When all the legs have been destroyed, make sure you get out of the way to avoid the main section. STAGE 3 FORTUNA SHIELD If you fly through all of the arches you'll get this...and this. Grab the shield for a little help through the tricky parts. "


"SHIELD SHIELD 000 Watch these arrows to see which way the block moves, you can shoot them to stop the arrows moving. Pick up the blaster power-up and you'll make light work of the baddies. As before, scout ships are the first things you'll come across here, although these ones take a few more hits than usual. The spinning rods can be stopped in the same way as before; just shoot the arrows at the end of the them and they'll slow down. Keep an eye out for the near-invisible blocks, they're tough to spot so keep your finger on the booster switch and be prepared for some evasive manoeuvres. There's a blaster power-up about halfway through the section, so don't panic if your weapons are down-graded. After the first section of blocks you enter a space scaffold area with gun turrets positioned on the middle struts and also on either side of the screen. Use the booster to fly right down the centre of the structure while constantly firing at the turrets, this way you'll only take a few hits, if any. The second section of rotating shapes is even harder, so good luck. You will now enter the core which has loads of invisible blocks, so slow down and stay alert. This planet is hot, damn hot, real hot, as hot as CVG Towers in the summer. Get the idea? You start off in a cave where the threat comes from ground-based tanks. Earthquakes are another hazard, causing loads of rocks to crash down from the ceiling. Beware of the volcanoes which spew out bucket-loads of lava and rocks. Keep low and shoot the boulders to survive. What look like a load of thorns will attack you next. These have to be destroyed early otherwise they won't leave your ship alone. The second half of the level features a row of guns that are impossible to get past without taking a few hits. If you're confident with your flight skills you can clear a path with a few well-placed shots, otherwise loose off a Nova Bomb. DRILLER KILLER ENI ATOMIC BASE This bloke looks exactly like the one on the Space Armada level on Easy difficulty setting; he's damn sight harder, though! Use the same tactics as before but make sure you move around the screen a lot quicker. It's essential that you are armed with something more substantial than the standard blaster cos this guy is tough Hit the satellites, then concentrate on the main core. SHIELD Shoot drill boy here to kill him. This guy uses a smoke screen to spoil your aim, Blast the lower section of the guardian as it spins but don't shoot the balls that rotate around the target as these reflect your shots back at you. The Driller Killer's weak points are the edges of its base. A Nova Bomb, launched at the lower section, will take loads of energy. Remember that, even when he's shielded by smoke, you can still hit him. STAGE  STAGE ABOVE VENOM. Under no circumstances, no matter how much you're tempted to, use a Nova Bomb on this level. You'll need all the firepower you can muster to beat the boss. The only new baddy you face is a long thin ship which fires oval beams at you. These can do quite a lot of damage so make sure you kill them as soon as they appear. There's a large energy ring midway through the first level that will come in dead handy. If you fly through it you'll be able to pick up a power shield and a smart blaster power-up. As you approach the end of the stage you'll be set upon by hundreds of those blasted triangle things. Then, it's the Warship. Keep your eyes out for this shield, it'll really help you through the level. 99 "


"First of all fly to the right-hand side and and turn your ship on its side. This way you can hit the baddy and avoid all its missiles. Once all the targets on that side have been destroyed move to the left and do the same there. Fire two Nova Bombs in quick succession when he launches a smoke bomb to cause him maximum amounts of damage. Although this guardian is really hard, follow these tips and you should come out on top. STAGE VENOM SHIELD The shield will provide an un-ending amount of help. SHIELD SMELD Doh! Who didn't listen to the advice about saving all your Nova bombs for the end of the level? Watch the arrow on this block for which way it is going to move. You can shoot the arrows to stop them moving. There are very few enemies on the planet's surface but there are loads of traps and pitfalls to catch the unwary pilot. If you avoid all the aerial attackers you'll be rewarded with a shield. As soon as you have it, fly really close to the ground to avoid more instruments of death. On the right-hand corner there are plenty of square obstacles which appear right at the last moment, and it is very hard to dodge them. One sneaky way of avoiding everything is to stay in the top-right corner of the screen. From this position you can destroy all enemies who threaten you while only taking a few hits MEGA ROBOT ENEMY These things are absolute gets, you HAVE to kill them before they get to you or they'll pummel you. ANDROSS WARSHIP ENEMY Hit this just here to end its miserable life. SHIELD Unload with everything you have on the main body segment and Duck left and right to avoid the lasers and fireballs. When the energy bar is down to half the robot will rotate and fire iron balls at you. Move in a circular motion to avoid them but don't get trapped n the corner of the screen or it's curtains. When the main body splits it rolls balls towards you but they can be destroyed or avoided. Now it's onto the final Andross! Hit the Warship here to kill it. 100 "


"ANDROSS Shoot that face to win! SHIELD The very last guardian takes the same form as before but with twice as much energy and increased firepower. You'll need to use every part of the screen to avoid his shots. As soon as Andross is revealed, launch two Nova Bombs at the centre of the screen and then pump him full of lasers. You will have to return to the face a few times to finish him off. It's worth taking risks as the longer you take the less chance you'll have of beating him. THAT'S IT! YOU'VE COMPLETED STARWING!

SUPER PUTTY SUPER NES FALL SYSTEM 3 TBA Continuing the tradition of top floppy games inevitably making their way onto consoles sooner or later is System 3 with Super Putty. Since the original Amiga RELEASE version of Putty scooped no end of press accolades and dominated the Amiga charts last Christmas, the team at System 3 has been hard at work tweaking and converting the game for the Super NES. In what is surely the weirdest game scenario we've read in yonks, the whole thing centres around a little blob of putty called Billy whose job it is to save an army of lovable robots from the horde of evil aliens trying to kill them on the planet Zid. Each of the 18 stages is built like a vertically-scrolling tower connected by platforms and ladders on which the hapless 'bots and their alien enemies bounce around on frantically. Working against a strict time limit, Billy has to round up all the robots and get them to a safe exit before he can leave for the next stage. But, we hear you ask, what good is a piece of putty against hordes of bloodthirsty aliens? Ah well, fans of the original will remember that Billy is no ordinary piece of Putty. As well as wriggling along and jumping, he can mould himself to take on new shapes, like a fist that bashes the bad guys. He can also absorb enemies into his gelatinous form, blow himself up to giant size and even imitate the shapes of other characters. With heavily stylised cartoon graphics and buckets of sampled sound and speech, Putty promises at least to be one of the funniest SNES games to date if the developers can squeeze as many comic touches into the Nintendo console as they got into the Amiga (like the litIMPERIAL PURSUIT 1 Get ready to take on the Empire's finest in Imperial Pursuit.

When loaded into the original XWing, Imperial Pursuit sets starfighter pilots up with the next chapter of the ongoing war against the Empire, with 15 all-new missions to fly. The story this time has the Rebels fleeing from their secret base on Yavin after it is discovered by an imperial patrol. In their haste, however, the rebels leave their food supplies behind to be destroyed by the Empire, so it's a race against time to find a new base before their rations run out.

And, like most fatal spanner in the works of the German war machine. Instruments of Chaos is a left-toright platform runabout with Young Indy defending himself against the various baddies with his fists, pistol, grenades and, of course, his trusty bullwhip.It's a little similar in style to the last Indy game, Last Crusade, but with a bit more to it. Though still quite early in development, Instruments of Chaos is already looking very nice indeed, particulary in the animation stakes (Indy's bullwhip is well smart), so Indy fans should have something rather good to look forward to around September.

"SUPER NES Kick Off players, get ready to move up to the next level Anco's follow-up lets you manage the team as well as play in it! Your match commentators, Gary Whitta and Trevor Brooking... by ANCO Price TBA REVIEW OCTOBER RELEASE Stage of Development 95% Completed Console owners may have the likes of Mario and Sonic all to themselves, but there are still plenty of software greats that floppy gamers can claim to have got first. Anco's classic Kick Off, for example, was revolutionising the world of computer football on Amiga and ST long before Megadrive and Super NES owners ever got a look in. The same is true of the follow-up Player Manager which only now, after years of success on floppy formats, is finally coming to the SNES. It should be worth the wait. Even though football management is one of the busiest game genres on Amiga, Player Manager is still seen as one of the very best. It's like a management fan's dream a detailed and realistic manager game based around the incredible arcade engine of Kick Off. And, unlike the England team, it's every bit as good on grass as it looks on paper. KEVIN KEEGAN'S The icons represent different skills; the yellow line is your skill, the black is the divisional average. WINSTON CHURCHILL The best thing about the action section in Kevin Keegan's Player Manager is that it's a complete arcade game in itself if you like, you can skip the management side completely and just have a good old-fashioned game of the new, improved Kick Off against the computer or a friend. The practice options are in there too, along with a penalty shoot-out section. So, even if the management side of football leaves you cold, there's still enough in there to satisfy your wildest arcade desires. Or, at least, that's the theory. We'll have to wait until the game is finished to see how the new, enhanced action game stacks up against the old Kick Off or, for that matter, the console versions of Sensible Soccer, which are due out at around the same time. Now almost completely finished, Kevin Keegan's Player Manager just needs to go through the normal Nintendo approval procedure before it's ready to be released in October. Choose the stand to play a match, calculator for finances and Kev to manage! 110 "


"There's more of the pitch on view than in Kick Off, but the action's just as frantic! Sa ANCO TIES MARSEE 25.99 MAGGIE THATCHER Since Player Manager's original creator Dino Dini has defected to Virgin Games with Goal!, the man now bringing the game to the SNES is Steve Screech, who co-designed the old Kick Off games with Dino. But since management games are generally looked on as a bit dull, and console games have to be zappy and exciting to get anywhere these days, this new SNES version is a world apart from the Amiga original. The stuffy old league tables have been replaced by cutesy Japanese-style icons and, as you've probably already guessed from the title, Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan has lent his not-inconsiderable name to the whole shebang. The player can select from a huge array of teams but the names have been changed. Check the papers, or talk to the board about financing. YOUR BOYS TOOK ONE HELL OF A BEATING Top midfield action in Kevin Keegan's Player Manager. & 2 Not even Manchester Utd needs a squad that big sell 'em off for loadsacash! It might look like child's play on the surface, but underneath there's a bubbling cauldron of complex sums and football facts that add up to create a realistic soccer world, with injuries, contracts, player skills and other important factors constantly being juggled by the program. But if you're an old Kick Off fan, probably the most exciting thing about Player Manager is the all-new arcade section, which is based on Kick Off but has been radically re-designed for even more excellence. The graphics have been completely redone, and the control mode tweaked to make it tighter and more fluid. The game itself slots nicely into the management section whenever a match comes up, you can choose to watch the action from the dugout or take to the pitch as a player, just like in Kick Off. Alternatively, if you're a bit dull and only want to play the management bit, you can skip over the match itself and have the result computed automatically.

However, it won't look quite the same, as the console versions' cartoony icons and displays will be replaced by more seriouslooking tables and graphs, because that's the sort of thing you appreciate when your games machine has got more than six buttons on it. Other than that the game is exactly the same, and is due out in October alongside the SNES cart. As player manager of the domestic club of your choice, you start off wallowing at the bottom of Division Three, but with your sights set on the heights of the Premier League. With a team of young but inexperienced hopefuls, not very much money and a bit of luck, your job is to guide your boys to glory using your skill and judgement. To get results in the fiercely competetive league and cup tournaments, you'll have to put players through rigorous training programmes, organise team tactics, buy, sell, negotiate with and scout for players, look after the club's finances... basically everything a real manager does, apart from taking a \"bung\" or being arrested for kerb-crawling. Or throwing tea cups around in the dressing room. Or punching photographers. Or (that's enough Ed). As you do well, the team climbs up the table, which means bigger crowds, TV sponsorship and other revenue, which allows you to bid for more expensive players and expand the club. Of course, if you don't get results the fans will stay away and before long you're looking at the sack. A bit like lan Porterfield. Allegedly. Kevin Keegan may have lent his name to the UK version of Player Manager, but he's not quite as big abroad (except maybe in Hamburg) as he is here, so Anco has signed up some other top footballing names to front the game in other countries. In Germany, for example, top boy Karl-Heinz Ruminegge is the man in the sheepskin coat, while in Italy and France it's endorsed by international AC Milan star Jean-Pierre Papin. You've got an above-average player there, but his stamina's a bit cack. "


"MEGADRIVE by SEGA Price TBA PREVIEW AUTUMN RELEASE WOW Stage of Development 75% Completed www JURASSIC PARK The first dino you'll meet is a friendly Triceratops. Aah, don't shoot her! Look out, those spikes are deadly Last month's Jurassic Park feature may have been tops and exclusive and all that stuff, but where, as you quite rightly asked us, were the Sega versions? Fear Phe film is out. It's making a fortune. It's as good as everyone said it was going to be, if not better. not, Megadrive The Jurassic Park hype is, at long last, over. fans. Spielberg's Well... almost. We're still waiting for the arrival of the games, and although we know that Ocean's Nintendo Summer and floppy formats are looking good, the Sega verblockbuster is onsions have been particularly mysterious up until now. Like the movie, Megadrive Jurassic Park has been its way to your kept tightly under wraps during its development, and machines too. was only shown publicly for the first at the Summer CES in Chicago. Jurassic developers Blue Sky And here's the Software have been on the case for the last 15 proof... months, no less, but it's only now that we're starting to get a sneaky peek at the year's biggest Sega licence. 112 WHAT'S THE STORY? You'll probably be chuffed to hear that this version isn't just a carbon copy of Ocean's efforts. A different development team means a different game design, and while Ocean's games are a mix of birds-eye blasting action and 3D adventuring, Sega has opted for the more traditional platform approach. Don't go groaning just yet, though this one's got a bit more to it than most levels'n'ladders romps. The main hook is that it's effectively "


"two games in one, as you can choose to play either Alan Grant (the paleontologist hero of the movie) on a mission to save the island's stranded guests from the visitor or interesting touch, this -a Velociraptor (one of the movie's deadliest dinosaurs) trying to escape Jurassic Park to the outside world. No matter who you play, the general game map and layout remains the same but that's about all. As Grant, you're up against the wide variety of dinosaurs in the park, ranging from Raptors, through the venomspitting Dilophosaurs and even the giant T-Rex, but can protect yourself with all manner of weapons, like stun guns, gas grenades and tranquiliser darts. If anything the Raptor has a tougher job, with only his jaws and claws to protect himself and an army of heavily-armed park guards to contend with. AND FINALLY... So, that's that, then. Jurassic Park is coming to the Megadrive and it's looking rather fabbo. A contender for top platform game on Sega? Perhaps. After all, it's got 16Mb of chip power behind it (that's twice the size of your average platformer), and early preview plays in the CVG games vault have been very positive indeed. But we'll have to wait until the Autumn to find out which of the two big consoles will be able to boast the best version. In any case, go and see the film cos it's brilliant (we know, because we saw it a month ago at a secret preview. So yah boo sucks). As a Raptor, the Visitor Centre will be one of your goals. SCOPIN' AROUN' What with Rotoscoping being one of the sexiest tech terms at the moment, Jurassic Park has got oodles of the stuff in it, mainly based around Alan Grant. One of Blue Sky's programmers, dressed up in jungle costume, was filmed performing all the necessary game actions walking, crouching, climb ing, jumping etc and the video frames were digitised to come up with the final character animation. It's the same technique used in Flashback and the result is a game that, especially in the first jungle level, looks very similar to Delphine's classic, which can't be bad. It's got a similar control feel too, with Grant able to shin up poles, clamber on jungle vines, and hang from high ledges as well as the standard running and jumping moves. Similarly many of the movie's monster models were brought into the development studio to be videoed and digitised going through the motions, so the computer dinos should be dead ringers for those on the big screen. Peril from above. Inside the volcano which isn't in the book or the film. Oops. PARK PATROL Whoever or whatever you choose to be, Jurassic Park is made up of 13 levels starting in the jungle (if you're a Raptor you've been freed from your holding pen by lightning, while Grant begins from the point where the jeep crashed after the 'movie's T-Rex attack) and progressing through all the major park locations the jungle river, power station, volcano etc, each with their own set of background hazards. And on top of all that lot, of course, you've got the dinosaurs, which Sega claims are some of the most intelligent enemies ever seen. A bit of clever programming here and there has made the enemy dinos' behaviour impossible to predict, and as a result no two games are ever the same. A Raptor may decide to slice you to pieces in one game, but the same dino might just sniff you and walk on past in the next. We think it's a fairly safe bet that you can always rely on the T-Rex attacking you, though. Compys are irritating little dinos that stick onto you. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? GRAPHICS All the backdrops and sprites are in place, so now its just a question of clearing up graphical glitch es and sweeping those ugly bugs under the car pet. Graphic artist Doua TenNapel used to be TV cartoon animator, so he knows his stutt A Dilophosaur is no match for a Velociraptor. ONNOS Each level has its own theme tone and there s no shortage of sampled FX, including the T-Rex roar. Music man Sam Powell has also added an element of interactivity to the sound. SO IT YOU listen carefully to the jungle noises you might get some clues as to what's round the next corner. GAMEPLAY Dinos and humans are running round the landscape happily, but the team still needs to finalise level design, placing of bonus objects etc so it all gels together into a playable experience and not just an aimless runaround.
