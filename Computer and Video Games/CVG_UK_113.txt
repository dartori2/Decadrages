"ED-FIRST Dhwoar! We thought we had a rough time getting CVG on the streets last month, but this issue has been even more difficult! I mean, call me a moaning git, but what with \"British Rail regrets that due to inclement weather...\", and \"London Underground regrets that due to a security alert...\", not to mention stolen cameras and printer breakdowns, this has been one mutha of a month. And just when I think it can't get any worse, Jon draws a cartoon that makes me look like Plug from The Bash Street Kids. Don't be misled, all you attractive lady readers I'm dead nice looking, I am, and Jon's just jealous. Anyway, to complicate things further, we decided we had to make a few tweaks to our new design to make the mag even better looking and provide even more information for our beloved readers! Aha, now I come to mention providing more, you may also be pleased to hear that from next month's issue, CVG will have an extra 16 editorial pages every month, so we can fit in more huge reviews, a bigger Cheat Mode section (get sending in those maps!) and larger news, previews and Mailbag sections. And how much extra is all this going to cost you? Nought, no, not a lot. Zilch, that's the big O. Not a sausage, not a jot, not the tiniest spot. Nothing whatsoever at all.

"CVG NEWS REPO AKIRA THE GAME Decently released in Japan is Akira, the video game. The nversion we've glimpsed is for the Famicom (that is the Japanese version of the NES), and it recreates the look of the film with screens which are replicas of scenes from the movie. The gameplay is predominantly role-playing, but it does feature action sequences, such as the motorbike chase. It seems doubtful whether it will be released in this country in the near future, but if the American version of the movie, with dubbed voices instead of subtitles, ever goes on general release, there would undoubtedly be a demand for the game of this outstanding film. THE POWER OF AKIRA Look. Forget Thunder... Thunder... Thundercats. Paul Glancey checks out the best SF cartoon ever and braces himself for the game of the film... If you thought the pinnacle of Japanese science fiction movies I was Godzilla versus The Smog Monster, think again. Akira is over two hours of the best animated cinema ever, based on the cyberpunk graphic novel by Katsuhiro Otomo, who also di rected the movie. The Akira comic books have been on sale in the UK for a couple of years, and the movie has played to vast crowds at the occasional animation festival, but from late February it is going on tour\" to selected cinemas throughout the country Not surprisingly, the speech in the film is entirely Japanese, but fortunately the version currently on release has subtitles The story is set in Neo Tokyo in 2019, when the world is recovering from World War Ill, and it centres on the adventures of two members of a motorcycle gang who regularly do battle with rival bikers in the city streets During an incredible motorbike chase, one of the gang. Tetsuo, is injured and promptly (and mysteriously) airlifted to an army hospital where he becomes the subject of medical experiments, resulting in him being given awesome telekinetic abil ities the power of Akira. Unfortunately, Tetsuo isn't a well-balanced lad, and the fact that his head's been messed with doesn't half tick him off. In fact, he uses his new found powers to destroy most of Neo Tokyo, and neither lasers, tanks, nor even an orbital defence cannon can slow him down. Saving the city is down to his childhood buddy and motorbiking mate, Kaneda (who, incidentally, rides the hottest motor cycle in the universe), and three children who also have the gift of Akira. Though Akira has been awarded a 12 certificate, it's quite a vicious and bloody film, and following the story often takes some effort. However the superlative animation steals the show, and it makes the action scenes a real thrill to watch. Any SF lan lucky enough to live near one of the cinemas listed, detinitely won't regret going to see it. COMING SOON TO A CINEMA NEAR YOU...

"CVG NEWS 73 7 00020010 MORE CARTS FROM ELECTRONIC ARTS 3, a new company formed by joystick manufacturer Spectravideo. The Stingray comes in four models (standard, autofire, Sega or Nintendo), and is fitted with the usual microswitches, with fire buttons at the rear and front of the grip. We weren't overly impressed with the Stingray, finding it somewhat cumbersome to use, but if you reckon that this baby's right up your street, the standard model costs .95, the autofire .95, and both Sega and Nintendo models the grand total of .95 each. Oh, and Spectravideo can be reached on 081 900 0024. Halfpipe, the Innertube Thrash (Atari's Toobin strikes back!), Acro Aerials and a Downhill Blitz. Nope, nothing to do with the old Gerry Anderson TV series in fact, the Stingray is a brand new joystick from Logic Electronic Arts are about to release two new Megadrive cartridges, namely PGA Tour Golf and James Pond. James Pond is an exact conversion of Millennium's rather jolly Amiga arcade adventure which scored 90% in issue 109, and PGA is a conversion of the successful PC golf simulation which features \"fore\", ahem, four 3D courses full of checkie-trousered antics. PGA Tour Golf is also soon to be released on the Amiga, along with an Amiga conversion of the follow-up to Skate or Die, which is of course, Ski or Die. The game is comprised of various wintry events including the Snowball Blast (an Op Wolf-type snowball fight), Snowboard biggest NES releases for quite some while, but not only that a version of Star Wars for the Super Famicom is also under consideration!

"NEWS GETTING A GRIP ON THE GEAR Virgin have at last announced that Sega's new colour portable handheld, the Game Gear, is to be officially launched during the summer of this year, for the sum of .99. The Game Gear will be supported by (according to the press blurb) \"an impressive and large range of both classic and new games, including Super Monaco GP, Columns, Mickey Mouse, GLOC, Shinobi and Golden Axe\". An attractive catalogue. eh? We still think the Lynx still has the hardware advantage, and at the moment, the Game Boy has the most playable games. However, the Game Gear's ace in the hole is the optional TV tuner which will be available later in the year you won't be able to get one of those for the Game Boy!

"REVIEW ATARI ST.99 BY RAINBIRD After ridding their island from the tyranny of Colonel Masters, the citizens of Midwinter enjoyed 78 years of prosperity. In that time the ice receded, but the melting glaciers created a new problem. The sea-level rose dramatically, and Midwinter is now just a distant memory, residing many fathoms beneath the surface of the ocean. The refugees eventually arrived at Agora, one of 42 islands just west of the old African coast, where they were welcomed into the Atlantic Federation, a military force dedicated to peace and democracy. Unfortunately, the Saharan Empire, who run the African continent, are dedicated to war and dictatorship. The player adopts the role of the best field agent in the Atlantic Federation, charged with completing dangerous missions in the cause of truth, justice and Operation Wildfire the Federation's master plan for the overthrow of the Saharan Empire! The Saharan Empire aren't just going to hang around while you carry out your subversive deeds. The islands are liberally sprinkled with enemy patrols and they shoot to kill! The boys in the Federation Intelligence Department have also got wind of Operation Scorpio the Saharan Empire's massing of an armada to take over Agora! A The island of Khash, with military posts.

First of all, this portrait designer is used to create your character's appearance. Any kind of face can be produced and features such as hair, chin, eyes, nose and mouth can be tweaked. It's pretty flexible, and even someone as ugly as Rob Swan can be created if you really wish (but we don't blame you if you don't!)

TINTERME STRATEGY ESCAPE AMPH FIREF AGORA DHAFRA OPERATION SCORPIO! The enemy's massive offensive against the Atlantic Federation usually takes place in the summer of that year. So you've got at least six or seven months before the real terror begins! The enemy fleet sets out from the African coast and will take the shortest route to Agora. If they come across any liberated islands, they'll do their best to avoid them and try a different route. However, if you've blocked their route completely, they'll be forced to fight for one of your liberated islands buying you more time and possibly depleting their forces. You can simulate Operation Scorpio in the Training Room to help you choose the sequence of islands to liberate during the campaign. CAMARGO DI FREEDOM CHAHOE PSYCHOLOOY RICH SEZ...

The game uses similar light-sourced fractal graphics to Midwinter and they're simply stunning if a little slow. Travel to the coast-line and you can even see the waves breaking on the shore. Commandeer a sub and you can even travel underwater and treat your eyes to a view of the waves above and the sea-bed below (and you can even try and find an enemy underwater base and let them have it!). Midwinter 2 just seems to offer everything, even down at designing your own agent (as you can gather, we all had a bit of fun here!). There's so much to it and tons to keep you occupied for months on end! Midwinter 2 may not appeal to the die-hard laser brains at all, but for sheer depth and enjoyment this takes some beating.

And what is even more unbelievable is that unlike most vast games, Flames of Freedom actually has an awful lot of gameplay in it. There are all those modes of transport, all those people to contact and all those islands to explore, making it an adventure that could easily continue for months. The 3D graphics are slightly more jerky than Midwinter's but they do provide a believable environment, especially underwater, and the lapping waves are so realistic it's uncanny.

Taking control of one of these ultimate combat transports (with a friend controlling the other, it in two-player mode), your objective is to battle through the sixteen different landscapes, to destroy as much of the enemy forces as possible, At the end of each landscape lies a giant enemy in stallation which must be destroyed to progress it isn't that easy, however, as the base will throw everything it has at you to stop you dead!

What I liked most about SWIV was the enemy vehicles, which you might think is strange, but they look just like the sort of tanks, trucks and aircraft Gerry Anderson used to dream up for the SF programmes of my youth. Elderly arcade fans should also watch out for the \"Tribute to Xevious\" part-way through the second section. The use of the two vehicles is as accomplished as it was in Silk Worm, though I found the Jeep more difficult to control than the helicopter because I couldn't quite master the jumping control. Still, they tell me practice makes perfect, so I've got a good excuse to get back to the game and start playing it again. So if you'll excuse me... SMOOTH AS SILK PAUL GLANCEY Though not strictly speaking a sequel SWIV could be thought of as the follow-up to a Tecmo coin-op released back in 1988. This enjoyable horizontal scrolling blast featured a similar style of simultaneous two-player action, but playing the jumping jeep was a difficult job at best, due to the large number of ground installations. Silkworm was converted to home computers a year later by Random Access (who, by no strange coincidence, are also the team behind SWIV), and received rave reviews across the board Paul awarded the cracking Amiga version a CVG HITI in the July '89 issue.

The Lord of the Underworld has spirited his beloved off to the dark recesses of the abyss, to make her his slavel What can a karate-kicking hero do, but make tracks after her, and kick the evil one's butt into the middle of next week? Viewed from side-on, Jackie has to progress through six levels, kicking seven bells out of any opponent that dares to stand in his way. The bad guys aren't about to sit down and die, however, and will do everything in their power to make sure Jackie doesn't succeed! Contact with either an enemy or his weapon results in the loss of one of Jackie's energy points once these are all gone, Jackie goes all a-quiver and collapses! Friendly frogs wait en route, and when punched they release power-ups for Jackie to catch, bestowing extra energy, super spin kicks or super high kicks. These power-ups are limited in number, however, and must be used wisely. Also in Jackie's arsenal is the ability to power-up his \"fists of fury\", and unleash an energy bolt of devastating force! ... 9 A Tiger, tiger, burning bright... 5 10 A Flamin' heck it's hot stuff! CLOUD BOUNCING BONUSES RICH SEZ If you're lucky enough to come across a key to a secret room, Jackie can grab loads of extra goodies! Jackie has to bounce from cloud to cloud without falling off and collecting the fruit as he goes. When the timer reaches zero, Jackie is awarded extra lives, points, energy and power-ups, depending on which fruit he collected! If ever you want to watch a film with a wafer-thin plot, plenty of violence and loadsa laughs, I can highly recommend any of Jackie Chan's movies. Bearing in mind all his laugh-a-minute antics, I thought that this would be a brill game. I was a tad disappointed. Poor old Jackie seems to have gone through a timewarp to ancient Japan (no leaping on top of a moving lorry and taking on seven ninjitsu aces in mid-air, no sir) completely losing all of the atmosphere of the movies! Still, although the game wastes the potential of the licence, it's still a good laugh to play with some really nice sprites (especially the tiger on level one) and decent grunts, groans and tunes beefing up the audio aspect. The game is also very challenging and there's plenty of variety in all the levels. If you're into platform-based beat 'em ups, give this one a WELCOME TO SPECIAL STAGE go. RICHARD LEADBETTER 130 "


"REVIEW THANKS Thanks to Console. Concepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the cartridge used in this review A Have you got frog's legs? No, I always walk like that... ROB SEZ  I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of chop-socky movies, and Jackie Chan doesn't strike me as being among the likes of Harrison Ford in the film star stakes. Bearing this in mind, I approached Jackie Chan with some trepidation, thinking \"yeah, just another beat 'em up\". But, as some games have a sneaking tendency to do, this had me completely addicted before long! It's not just the audio-visual aspect which makes this so good (although the way Jackie leaps, kicks, and punches is pretty good) but the sheer addictive nature of the game which keeps dragging you back for another go. The addition of secret levels only makes the game more entertaining, thereby prolonging the game's lifespan. Easy to get into but a real mutha to complete, Jackie Chan is a must for any PC Engineer's collection.

"SC REVIEW C64 CARTRIDGE .99 BY SYSTEM 3 It is the twelfth century. The evil Shogun, kunitoki, having fled from present-day Manhattan, has taken refuge in ancient Tibet. His new lair is the Palace of Mysteries, the source of the Ninja's power of stealth and magic. The dark one's goal to completely destroy the Ninja by perverting their temples into sanctums of evil and chaos! To test his plans, Kunitoni has called upon his ageold adversary, the Last Ninja Armakuni. Dragged through time and space, Armakuni has to traverse five forced-perspective levels, each of which depict the various chambers of the temple. Each chamber signifies a particular element, Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, and finally Void, in which Armakuni must defeat Kunitoni once and for all! It's not as easy as it sounds, however. Not only are kunitoki's forces out to utlerly destroy the lone shadow warrior, but puzzles have to be solved in order for Armakuni to progress if these aren't overcome, the Ninja will face a fate worse than eternal doom... Getting all fired-up! USING USING 003800 29 A The water level in all its glory. A one-on-one battle! THE FIRST LAST NINJAS The first Last Ninja game (?) was released during 1986 after an extensive advertising campaign, and an even longer wait (prompting some wits to call it \"At Last The Ninja\"). Featuring brilliant chopsocky action and great graphics, Last Ninja also surlaced on the 16 bits as Ninja Remix (although the first one was supposed to have been released along with the C64 version an Atari version was planned, but never saw the light of day). Last Ninja 2 was no less stunning than the first game. Set in present day New York, the game saw Armakuni take on the Shogun's forces, crooked cops, thugs and all sorts of other strangeness. Although the 8 bit versions received general acclaim and many rave reviews, the ST and Amiga versions (programmed and published by Activision) were, surprisingly, inferior and as such were slated something chronic! Mr Death comes to play... 11.1.1. ataleta "


"REVIEW Se A S T w BUSHIDO BASHING If you are drawn into combat (as you inevitably will be), it's important to keep an eye on the prayer wheel at the topright hand corner of the screen-this will inform you which weapon your assailant will attack you with. If you try to utilise the same weapon against him (if you have it in your arsenal, of course!), victory will increase your Bushido level. Your Bushido level dictates how much damage you can inflict upon an opponent with a reasonable amount of Bushido and an average weapon, you can hope to defeat any enemy with little trouble. However, if your bushido is low, and even if you are using a powerful weapon (such as the nunchaku), you're still in for a rough ride. Facing Kunitoni with anything less than full bushido is suicidal! NINJA Climb the cliff! ROB SEZ... As a fan of Last Ninja (and as someone who thought that Activision's 16 bit versions of Ninja 2 were little more than laughable), it's great to see that System 3 are determined to produce the best from an 8 bit machine. The C64's graphics and sound are really pushed to their limits, resulting in some of the most incredible audio-visuals you're likely to see on any 8 bit the Void level, the intro and the end sequences are enough to have even the most cynical Amiga owner eating his words. The construction element of the puzzles makes the game that much more enjoyable to play, and increases the game's lastability. Okay, so twenty-five quid may sound like a lot of dough for someone used to forking out a tenner on a game, but when you're getting a game as big and as good as this, you're definitely getting your money's worth. Overall, this is the best thing on the C64 in years and I ain't joking. ROBERT SWAN Prepare V for pain! SELLE 035 tttttttttttt "


"REVIEW 5252 RICH SEZ... USING plaag2200 16 BIT NINJA MAGIC The Amiga version of Ninja III is also coming along very nicely, and as you can see from these early screenshots, should be just as impressive as the C64 game. Although the intro and end sequences were missing from this demo, as were the spot effects and collision detection, the Amiga's graphics are little short of gobsmacking. When will all of this be available to you? Check out CVG over the next few months for alle details! Where shall I start? Well, perhaps at the beginning and what a beginning! Ninja 3 has the most amazing intro sequence yet seen on a C64 game, with Amiga-quality graphics and sound (1 kid you not). I'm happy to say that this amazing attention to detail continues right through the game. The graphics are simply stunning probably the best yet seen on a C64 game. The sound is similarly impressive, with soundtracks that match each elemental level (the sounds of wind on the wind level you get the idea). Each level is a real bitch to complete with some of the most cunning puzzles ever, but the solutions are quite logical (in a warped sort of way). The only thing that hasn't been improved is the ninja combat this is still a case of just choosing a weapon and laying into your opponent. It would have been nice if a larger degree of skill was required in combat. Still, Ninja 3 ranks as the best C64 game I've played for years well worth the money. RICHARD LEADBETTER Ninja combat can be fun if a little painful. V One mean dude... Cor! C64 TART UPDATE Ninja III should be slashing onto the Atari ST and Amiga within the next six weeks.

"CSP REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY TECMAGIK PATAMA THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PACMAN PacMan's video history is just as extensive the original coin-op, the Atari VCS and 8 bit cartridges, Ms PacMan. Baby PacMan (a curious mix of a mini pintable and a video game, which, unfortunately, flopped). Super PacMan, Professor PacMan (an educational coin-op?). PacLand (from which the TV cartoon series, which is still being screened today, was spawned), Super Pacland ( more of the same, only harder). PacMan Jr (another Atari VCS cart), and finally PacMania. What next, we ask ourselves? How about PacMan on the Game Gear? V acka-wacka! PacMan has returned, only to find that PacWorld has gone all forced-perspective on ROUND 1 him! A strange state of affairs, indeed, but to PacMan, BLOCK JOHN NOBSKUS it's business as usual time to stuff his facel The problem is, those pesky ghosts Inky, Pinky, Blinky and PACHANTS PARK Clyde are back as well, but with two new cohorts, Sue BONETYD.O and Jumpy, and all six are oul to sink their chompers into PacMan's hide! ROUND SANDBOX LAND PacMan's objective is to race around the five levels BONOS 150000 (Block Town,PacMan Park, Sandbox Land, Jungly Steps, and the new secret level, Coin World) munching ZUNSE LEET BEEI down all the video pills in order to progress to the next stage. Contact with a ghost will result in the loss of one of his three lives, but the tables can be turned by gulping A Choose your destination, PacMan! down one of the four power pills, to be found in each corner of the maze. If the going gets too harsh, PacMan can use his new \"bounce power\" to leap over the heads of any ghost that gets too close! Go for the power pill, Pac! Pacman's PA MANIA this time he's twice as deadly! GHTS RESERVED The key to Coin World! RICH SEZ... First of all, there's no denying the technical brilliance of PacMania the graphics are virtually the same as the acclaimed Amiga version with super-smooth scrolling throughout. The playability is just as good as the coin-op version (although it's a tad more difficult methinks) and the instantly addictive gameplay will have you hooked from the outset. Unfortunately, it's perhaps too close to the coin-op for its own good. RICHARD LEADBETTER 040 "


"IREVIEW UPDATE PacMania's been out and bout on computers for onks, courtesy of GrandSam. For those of you who lidn't grab it first time round what's wrong with you?), theck out a new compilation Tom US Gold, containing this ind Pac-Land. THE MONEY MAZE! As well as having all the worlds of the coin-op, the PacMania conversion also has one extra maze to wackaround. Coin World can only be reached from the first level, by... oops, no, we won't tell you just yet see if you can work it out for yourself. It's not difficult to reach, but its pathways are packed with bonus points in the form of shiny gold dubloons! Next stop: PacMan's Park! A Exploring Coin World. ROB SEZ... Gst City in BR Town! For their first title, Tecmagik have definitely come up trumps! I'm a great fan of the original PacMan, and used to spend hours piling coins into the coin-op. PacMania is essentially more of the same, only in 3D. The thing that really makes this game is the speed it's quick, fluid, really responsive, and most importantly, fun qualities which are vital for a game of this nature. The audio-visuals are great, with full-screen scrolling, well drawn and colourful sprites, some great renditions of the coin-op music and that old \"wacka-wacka\" sound. PacMania is easy to get into, but the only thing that may put some people off is the repetitive nature of the game. If you're a fan of the genre, however, you'll love it. ROBERT SWAN PAC PARAPHERNALIA As one of the most famous characters in computer history (more so than Mario in the early eighties, and that's saying something!), the number of PacMan related items that could be grabbed was little short of incredible. Towels, miniature video games (which spawned a thousand and one rip-offs), board games, cuddly toys, py jamas, lunch boxes, thermos flasks, a PacMan fan club (honestl), bedspreads, posters, T-shirts, bubble gum, watches, sweets, wallpaper, stickers, books, a record (the brill PacMan Fever) the list goes on! PacMan even went on a US tour along with Blinky the ghost, and was nearly mobbed by thousands of screaming fans! Can you imagine PacMan being saved by the US National Guard?

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .00 BY MASIYA The evil Iccus Empire are massing for an attack on the very symbol of everything good and righteous Heaven itself! The gods, pretty obviously, are not particularly enthralled with the idea of the denizens of darkness occupying the heavens, but being so nice they can't force themselves to use some of their divine power on the approaching marauders! Enter Wor, a mean, strutting angel with \"an attitude\". He's the sort of chap whose fighting skills are so lethal that even shaking hands with him leads to instant agony and eventual death! He's also the only angel who feels like using his powers for the benefit of Heaven, so out he trots out from his heavenly hideaway to enter six zones of scrolling shoot 'em up destruction, meting out violent death to anything of devil-born! Success is vital in order to maintain the ever-threatened balance of power between Good or Evil (or some other concept that's straight out of Dr Who). ANGELIC ICONS! PAUSE Wor can collect various icons in order to further his alien-annihilating cause. Feathers increase his speed. Blue crystals increase the power of his blue weapon (a front-firing spray weapon). Red crystals boost the red weapon (equal front and rear firepower). Collect the yellow crystal, and Wor is endowed with superb front-liring photons with limited rear-fire as well at no extra cost! The ground attack magle scroll beckons, RICH SEZ... Take a large dose of Hellfirestyle play ability, stir in graphics that more than match the superlative Thunderforce 3 and you've got one great blast! Gynoug oozes playability from the word go, with some of the most extensive power-ups you're ever likely to come across in a shoot 'em up! From the boring old energy balls to the awesome spinning-angel type thing (specific, huh?), Gynoug certainly gives you the tools to carry out the job! The graphics are great with a really nice mythological feel to the sprites and backdrops and some stomach-churning effects the wobbly screen is really weird. The sound ranks as some of the best I've heard on the Megadrive. I plugged in my mega-expensive bass-blasting JVC headphones and I was well and truly amazed by the swingsome tunes and explosive spot effects. Right then, all in all, a very challenging game that Megadrive owners should take a look at ASAP. Understand? RICHARD LEADBETTER Facing up to level one's mid-level boss!

The audio is also tops, with some of the most adrenalin-inducing soundtracks and spot effects yet to be heard on the Megadrive! My only quibble with Gynoug is that it suffers from an unrelenting difficulty level which could have inexperienced gamesters screaming in frustration.

"Si REVIEW FAMICOM BY NINTENDO .00 W elcome to the Pilotwings school of flying! Here, entrants learn everything necessary in order to become a real airman, capable of handling any aircraft in any situation. Your aim is simple. Graduate with honours from the Pilotwings Academy and use your newlyearned skills to complete a deadly mission... or two! Four rounds of aviating antics face the prospective candidate before a serious mission can be undertaken. Each time you take to the skies your objective is to score points by simply travelling through a series of hoops dotted around the airscape and successfully land. Simple, eh? After each round your performance is critically appraised by one of four instructors. Points are deducted for clumsy flying, time-wasting or death(), and if you don't get the points, you don't get onto the next round! Complete one mission, and you're sent back to the Pilotwings Expert school, where the going really gets tough! A night-time landing for this Pilotwings expert. 00059.000 BIPLANE A single-seater job that's a cinch to control. Watch out though, clumsy flyers or speed demons usually end up missing one of the hoops and in Pilotwings every mistake costs you points which could mean the difference between disqualification and entry to the next levell When landing, always remember to get your plane as close as you can to the centre of the runway. Extra points are awarded for accuracy. you see. A Locking on to the next target. RICH SEZ... Breezing througitovolone The first thing that'll strike you with Pilotwings is the amazing visual quality of the game. The graphics are simply incredible the Super Famicom's custom graphics give the player a totally realistic environment to fly around. The sound is similarly impressive and the spot effects are cosmic the skydiving has the most realistic wind effect you'll ever hear! I'm also glad to say that Pilotwings has the playability to match the audio-visuals. The variety in all the modes of transport will keep you at the Famicom for weeks, and I spent hours trying to get through each level just to see what new graphical feasts awaited! My only niggle with Pilotwings is that the landscape is completely flat, but this doesn't detract at all from the gameplay. All in all, an essential purchase for Super Famicom owners. So essential, in fact, that I had to add it to my own Famicom collection, so there you go what more can I say? RICHARD LEADBETTER 048 "


"REVIEW DS25 Borne  ROCKETBELT Cut through the air with your trusty two-speed rocketbelt! Simply fly through the green hoops, land successfully and Bob's your uncle! Easy! Well, it would be were it not for the fact that winds blow you around and gravity is constantly forcing you towards the ground. Keep an eye on the fuel level if that drops to zero, prepare to eat dirtl Candidates should beware of touching down prema turely as this incurs a two point penalty, but in case of disorientation, the buttons on the rear of the control pad instantly switch to a bird's eye view. SKYDIVING Candidates should be fully versed in escape procedure, and this is tested in the skydiving section of Pilotwings. A helicopter carries you up to 3,800 feet and the player freefalls down at around 1,000 feet hopefully travelling through the green hoops on the way down. Landing is the next priority, so pull that ripcord and hope for the best! Extra points are awarded for landing on scoring targets, so controlling your descent is essential. 00358 Jet-propelled excitement with the rocketbolt. to land! Sky-diving can be fun. Now you west Twilight then tulot 002161 HANG-GLIDING The Pilotwings biplane tows you into the sky, but when it cuts the rope, it's just the thermals of rising warm air keeping you aloft! Early levels demand that you just reach a certain height and then land safely. Later levels require you to hang-glide through hoops not too easy. especially when the thermals start to disappear! 049 "


"SPS REVIEWI PEPS UPDATE Pilotwings is unlikely to ever reach any other computer, console, or anything, Sorry! PAUL SEZ... A Prepare for lift-off! While everyone else went straight for Final Fight and Marioworld, this was the one I ended up playing after hours. In fact I've spent so much time on it that I've actually got further on the game than anyone else in the office a real first for me! What I find so attractive are the astonishing 3D graphics and the real feeling of \"being there\" that the sound effects, detail and smoothness help to create. Also, while there's not much in the way of pulse-racing action, playing is a really skillful business, and the addition of the pass-codes makes it easy to come back to time after time. This is one of the most impressive games I've ever played, and when I buy my Famicom it's going to be top of the shopping list. Is that recommendation enough? PAUL The chopper crashes on the coast... METAL HAWK? The first danger-packed mission puts the player at the controls of a helicopter in a sub-game that plays like a cut-down version of Namco's superb Metal Hawk coin-op. The object is pretty straightforward. Simply land on an enemy base and rescue some hostages. Unfortunately the base is surrounded by anti-aircraft batteries that could spell doom to inexperienced pilots! Use your gunship's laser-guided bombs to dispose of this little problem. GLANCEY Our penglun hero leaps into oblivion! A whole battery of rocket launchers threaten the chopper! FLYING PENGUINS! A couple of sub-games are hidden in Pilotwings. Land on a moving target (they're pretty easy to spot) and you're instantly whisked away to a mega-points bonus game! Take control of a hapless skydiving penguin or alternatively a man endowed with angel-esque wings who can be made to hop from platform to platform, earning extra points each time he hits terra-firma!

"SPEEDBALL 2 ST AND AMIGA PLAYER'S GUIDE you throw an electrified ball at the opposing 'keeper... GYM'LL FIX Damian Higgins from Marton in Middlesborough sent in this mega selection of hints, tips and tactics for the Bitmap Brothers' latest and greatest for which he wins  in cold cash cripes! ly positioned, you can just keep throwing the ball at the boinger, retrieving it and doing it again! GOAL SCORING The good old bludgeon method! Run straight at the centre of goal. When the goalie comes at you keep the stick pushed upwards (or whatever) and keep hitting fire. You should knock him over and score! Don't bother spending money on individual players it's much too long-winded. If you have the money, enhance the universal qualities of the team (like speed and aggression) and then tweak each group. Only spend money on subs if you've got the dosh to spare injuries are not very frequent. GENERAL TIPS As in many games of this type, there are only a number of sure-fire ways to successfully score (just go up to a girl and... whoops!). The best tactics are: Move to the corner of the playfield, just next to the side-wall, about three player-widths from the end. Throw a high ball horizontally across the goal mouth. It should pass the keeper, and your centre forward should be able to catch it and score! DOUBLE POINT BONANZA! Play aggressively this is 2100 after all! Be careful with the \"keeper. It's all too easy to turn around and throw the ball into your own net! Play a passing game your players automatically re-zone themselves according to your position. Cunningly use the warp tunnel to confuse your opponent! STAR TURNS Apart from goal scoring, the main way to get points is by hitting your stars (they're always the ones in the opposition's half). Hit each star for two points. Ten extra points are given if you light up all five! Hit your opponent's stars to turn them off and deduct the points from his score! Remember, Speedballers, those extra points can make all the difference! The points multipliers are the large twisty things half-way up the pitch at either side. Throw the ball in here to light up your colour. If your opponent has his light on then your throw will turn his lights off. When a light is on in your colour you get fifteen points per goal and every two point bonus gives three! Get two lights on and you'll get twenty points per goal and four per bonus! Use of the multipliers is the key to taking on the first division teams! Run towards the goal, slightly to one side of its centre, using your centre forward or a mid-fielder. One of your wingers should be on the other side of the goal to you beyond the keeper. Pass to him, and he should score! BONUS BOINGERS The \"No Entry\" icon is one of the most useful on the pitch it glues your opponent's players to the spot, which (not surprisingly) makes scoring a cinch! The other method of scoring points is to use the bonus boingers which are located outside each penalty area in the centre of the pitch. When the ball is thrown low at one of these it will bounce off at high speed and two points should be added to your score! If your player is correct. GREAT BALLS OF FIRE The bulbous bits jutting out of one side of the pitch are the electrolysers. Once the ball hits one of these it can be thrown at the opposing team in order to damage them! This is especially useful if 056 "

All the clasThe action's a bit dated for sic Gravitar/Thrust gameplay is gamesters of today, but those in there and there's plenty to after a challenge could do a keep any thruster occupied. A damn sight worse than this. nice bargain. OVERALL 81% OVERALL 80% RAILROAD TYCOON MICROPROSE .99 The Amiga conversion of the superb Sid Meier PC train game is here at last. Build your railroad empire across the Western or Eastern USA, Europe or Britain, linking up cities and creating trade and communities.

SILKWORM 16 BLITZ PLUS .99 More top quality 16 Blitz shoot 'em up fomfoolery, this time by the team behind the topper SWIV (reviewed on page 26)! Simultaneous two-player excitement, great graphics and rauCous sound combine to make a bargain treat that should be checked out now! OVERALL 88% Psygnosis' Lemmings are tak. ing the world by storm and the Liverpool-based company are already developing a follow-up! No release dates are forthcoming at the moment, but when we know you'll know! Purina According to Virgin, their budget line-up of Infocom re-releases are so popular they account for 31% of all their budget sales (and that includes the 8bit Mastertronic label too!).

MIGHTY BOMBJACK ELITE .99 Bombjack's back for his third home computer outing, and we're sad to report that it doesn't quite cut the mustard. We suspect that there's a jolly game in there somewhere, but it's lumbered with an unwieldy control method, awful and unexciting sound. Only BJ addicts need apply.

GAME PAUSED STAR CONTROL ACCOLADE .99 Remember the ancient Space Wars coin-op? This is much the same, but with extra ships and extra strategies. Unfortunately, the good guys never win because the bad guys have got all the good ships, so it's very onesided. A pretty good laugh in two-player mode, Star Control is worth a look.

"Se REVIEW .99 BY DYNAMIX After having fully explored the potential of simulating the latest in fighter aircraft technology, several software companies seem to be going back in time to give computer owners the chance to take part in First World War dogfights. Dynamix's Red Baron joins the fray close on the tail of Microprose's Knights of the Sky and Mindscape's Blue Max. nbridge Ashford Of course, in those days, staying in the air was much more of a test of the pilot's skill there were no jamming devices to hide behind, and no self-guiding weapons to destroy an opponent over the horizon. Nope, it was all down to the man and his forward-mounted machine gun. So, take to the air on the side of the Royal Flying Corps or the German Air Service, to destroy enemy fighters, Zeppelins or observation balloons. Red Baron lets you go into battle against any of the flying aces of the Great War, and even has a facility to let you take part in one of key dogfights of WW1, such as the final duel between Captain Roy Brown and Manfred von Richtofenthe Red Baron himself! Manfred von Richthofen Dare you take on the Red Baron?

But his commanding officer, Oswald Boelcke, taught him a great deal, and after being awarded the Orden pour le Merite (the Blue Max) in January of 1917 he himself was given command of the inexperienced fliers of Jasta 11, whom he led into battle in the infamous red Albatros which earned him his nick-name. After 52 kills, the Kaiser gave him the go-ahead to form Jagdgeschwader 1, a group of four squadrons, which would become the famous \"Flying Circus\". Von Richtofen weathered a head wound, and continued to terrorise Allied pilots, scoring his 79th and 80th kill on April 20th of 1918. They were to be his last victories, though. The next day, while his Fokker Triplane was chasing a Canadian novice over the Somme, a lucky shot from Captain Roy Brown hit the Red Baron in the chest, ending his illustrious and deadly career forever. Estrees EXTERNAL UPDATE As we go to press, Dynami have no firm plans for any other versions of Red Baro and if they were to produce an Amiga version, our opinion is that it would be sign cantly trimmed down. Prove us wrong, Dynamix! The Albatros that induced terror in allied fliers. After taking command of Jasta 1. Richthofen acquired an Albatros D.ITI. In order to be seen by his men, he pointed his mount scarlet red "


"REVIEW PS25 GETTING IT ON TAPE Red Baron gives you the option of saving each mission to \"tape\", so you can replay it later, and view the action from any point in the conflict. Novice pilots will find this useful because the game comes with several demo tapes which demonstrate essential flying skills, such as Immelman turns, Retournements and the text-book method for attacking observation balloons. Tape the mission and you can knock down a German Albatros... SECTORES Scratch one Berman plan! VIEWING YOUR SPADE VOURS COCKPIT OTHERS TIME EXTERNAL TODE TERRA A TARE NAME A ...and gloat about it on the replay at your leisure! PAUL SEZ... WATCH THE SKIES As with many flight sims, in Red Baron you can watch the action from most angles during the game, but it is unique in that it actually lets you Switch to an external view and look around just by moving the controller, providing the sort of freedom of vision the pilot would have. I'm a bloke who likes a good flight sim, and I'm extremely happy to see that they just keep getting better and better. A couple of months ago I couldn't get enough of Knights of the Sky, but Red Baron has even more features making it an even more playable game! Options like the mission recorder, the ability to take part in decisive dogfights, battling simulated real-life aces, and even the ability to view the whole sky around you and operate the throttle and rudder without having to touch the keyboard make this an absolute joy to play. The really fine points, such as the way night falls and the stars (real constellations!) appear, the way the screen dims whenever you fly under a cloud, and the blinding you get whenever you head into the sun make this a simulator of unparalleled realism. If flight sims really are your favourite computer pleasure, consider selling your Amiga or ST and get hold of a fast PC with VGA graphics it may cost a lot, but PC simulators are easily the best going, and Red Baron is simply the best of the best.

"REVIEW ATARI ST H ATARI ST .99 BY US GOLD The biggest computer brain ever made has gone to tally stark raving mad. Instead of protecting mankind (which is what it's supposed to do) it's directing all its missiles, nuclear and chemical weapons against men, women and cute doggies! To top it all it's locked itself into a huge mega-complex and thrown away the key Luckily, a handy loophole in the thing's design means there's room for just one technician to get into the sys tem and pull the plug. Trouble is, there's a whole gang of dangerous robot droids in there just looking for guys like you to turn into mincemeal. Worse still, Cybercon has laid on a special surprise: somewhere in there is the Annihilator, a robot hunter... and he's looking for you! TILT Displays the angle of the suit from the vertical.

V The red robot comac PAUL SEZ... 17177 A A red horny robot threatens our hero. This is one of the most involved 3D games I've ever seen it reminds me of the classic Mercenary only with the graphics and the atmosphere brought bang up to date. The different-sized rooms and the vast assortment of droids are enough to keep the player constantly occupied, with either blasting or puzzles, or both. The 3D graphics are very fast-moving, and the sombre blue backgrounds make the orange and green robots look almost fluorescent! It's just a shame that there isn't a bit more variety in the robot designs it looks like the programmers discovered a routine to produce vector graphic arcs and circles and decided not to use anything else. That aside, it's a great game and once you've become engrossed in the 3D world it'll be hours before you drag yourself away especially with the tense rivalry between you and the Annihilator to keep you busy.

I've played this sort of 3D exploration game before, and I've never been that keen on them until now. What makes Cybercon different is that it really does feel like you're in an alien environment. The rooms are such weird and wonderful sizes, with massive towers linked by huge walkways and the graphics create such a fantastic atmosphere that it's easy to get engrossed in the scenario almost straight away. And because everything works, you can spend ages just trying things out and wandering around. The fact that you never know what you're going to run into when you round the next corner lends the action a good deal of tension, helping to make this one of the classiest 3D products you're likely to seebags of action and some of the most complex puzzles around.

"| REVIEW MEGADRIVE BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .00 Can he score? The Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics are two of the American National Basketball Association's most renowned teams, and now they're the subject of this, the second of Electronic Arts' Megadrive sports extravaganzas. The aim of the game is simple enough defeat the other team by getting as many points as possible. Unless you're a complete thickie, you'll know that this is done by scoring \"baskets\", or in other words, getting the ball through the hoop. Contact with an opposing player is forbidden. If the referee spots any charging, he calls a foul and gives the opposing team automatic possession of the ball, and a WEST free shot at your basket. Lakers vs Celtics can be played in one of two ways: firstly, in arcade mode, with one or two players (either against the computer or each other), or tournament. which pits the players up against the entire NBA in order to win the championship. You can choose your team from the full list of NBA teams, or even an all-star squad from either the Eastern or Western Divisions, with some of the best basketball players in the world battling it out! ...and the Conference East teams. PISTONS BOSE GES JAKE VERSS NBA CONFERENCE WEST CONFERENCE EAST NBA LOS ELES LAKERS TRAILBLAZERS PISTONS SAN ANTONIO SPURS AND WON CHAN PHOENIX PHILADELPHIA PRESS START NBA PL CONTINUE A The NBA Conference West teams... DUNKING THROUGH THE AGES The idea behind basketball began way back in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1891, when a American (natch). Dr James A Naismith, nailed an old bushel basket upon a wall at the local YMCA. Kids with nothing better to do on a cold winter's afternoon threw balls at itevery once in a while, the ball went in, and so the idea caught on Through the years, however, many great players have made their own contributions to the game, none more so than the Harlem Globetrotters. This bunch of wild 'n' wacky ball-spinners are renowned across the face of the globe for their hilarious on-Court antics. Other \"giants\" include the Lakers' own Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who broke 23 records before he retired in 1989), Magic Johnson (also of the Lakers), Michael \"Air\" Jordan (after whom Nike named a type of training shoe), Julius \"Dr J\" Erving of the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Boston Celtics' Larry Bird, who was the NBA's most valuable player for three years running, between 1984 and 1986. Golly! A Oh, come on, I never touched him! ISI "


"REVIEW DIGITAL DRIBBLING Basketball has appeared on computer in more than one guise the earliest being the really ancient Basketball (original, huh?) from Alari, which appeared on the VCS 2600. Next up was One on One, a one or two player game on the C64 and Atari 8 bit, featuring two of the most famous basketball players in the world, Julius \"Dr J\" Erving and Larry Bird. More recently, the impressive TV Sports Basketball has appeared on the Amiga, with step-by-step action, and now there's Megadrive Super Real Basketball (check out this month's Megadrive Bytesize section for the full lowdown on that). CELTE 69 SUS THE NBA A A classic dunk from the Pistons' forward! PLAYOFFS THANKS ROB SEZ... Thanks to ConsoleConcepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the cartridge used in this review. AMERE This has a lot to live up to after the impressive John Madden's Football, but I'm happy to say that this is just as enjoyable as the aforementioned Megadrive masterpiece. The visual aspect of the game is terrific, with realistic sprites bounding around the court like the real McCoy, and the excellent sonics more than complement the action, with the ref sticking his oar in if he feels you're getting to be a bit rough in your approach! The feel of the game is a very important factor, and Lakers scores highly in that respect it's a very fast game, with little or no time to catch your breath. With two players, the action is even more furious, and has to rank as one of the most competitive games I've seen in a fair old while. If you're into basketball, or just enjoy the odd dunk, then fork out the shekels you won't regret it! ROBERT SWAN 091 "


"REVIEW RICH SEZ... Michael Jordan's got nothin' on me! PS When I first played this wound myself up something rotten mainly because the Celtics managed to cream me by a massive 43 points! Their lanky forward just seemed to be magnetically attracting the ball and dunking it into the net with the minimum of effort! However, once I had mastered the control method it wasn't too long before my own players were emulating the lanky one's exploits and the game could begin proper... and what a game it is! The graphics are super throughout you get a great playfield, a wide variety of animation on the players and some really nice effects. The sound is similarly great with some nice speech and a John Madden-esque theme tune (I hope this isn't the start of a trend...) to keep the ears occupied. The only problem is that the on-court action is pretty limited and although the range of plays is quite large, the skills and strategies are nowhere near as sophisticated as say, John Madden's. Lakers vs Celtics is a really nice basketball game (even better in two player mode), lacking just that special something to make it really spectacular. RICHARD LEADBETTER CHARGING 53 PISTONS EDWARDS BUILDING BASKETBALL COURTS FOR FUN AND PROFIT Fancy building yourself a Basketball court? Boy are you strange. Oh, well, first, get yourself a piece of flat ground 94 ft by 50 ft, and fasten two steel hoops, which are 18 inches in diameter on poles, ten feet from the ground. The pole should have a backboard placed behind the basket, to ensure that the ball stays within easy reach of the players, should the ball go out of play. Each pole must be placed at the centre of each end of the court obviously. If you don't want to buy a can of Dulux emulsion to paint the halfway and free-throw lines on the court you might as well go and get yourself a team twelve superfit persons (preferably well over six feet in height), with five as offence, five as defence, and two substitutes. Only five players are on court at once, but at least the other lads are there to cheer them on and take over when they get tired out. Such a friendly sport isn't it?

RoboCop II follows the same plot as the rather disappointing movie, and bears some similarities to the first coin-op (insofar as the horizontally scrolling shooting aspects are concerned) but that's about it. Additional sections include Robo's chase to catch Cain's van using a Harley Davidson motorbike, but even then, these sequences don't really add anything to the overall game. The graphics are okay, and the sprites are quite large, but they lack detail, and the sound (although quite explosive at times) can be described at best as adequate.

"PREVIEW_MERCS MERCS US GOLD The latest in a long I line of US Gold's Capcom conversions is Mercs the everyday story of one man (or two, if you've got a mate who is willing to play) against the might of a guerilla empire! The action is pretty straightforward. Simply guide your commando around the eight-way scrolling backdrops, dealing out lead death to any one who dares to pass in front of your gunsight. The coin-op was quite novel in that it actually enabled you to blow away sections of the scenery, like enemy huts and all of this napalm excitement has made its way into the conversion! Tiertex (the programming house behind the conversions of UN Squadron, Strider and Dynasty Wars) are the programming team behind the conversion of Mercs, and from the looks of the preview Amiga copy things are looking pretty good. The graphics appear faithful to the coin-op. the scrolling looks fine and the programmers have even cropped the sides of the display to simulate the vertical screen format of the arcade game. Further to this, Tiertex have even included the coin-op's intro sequence in its entirety! But will all these features add up to a playable game? Well, you'll have to wait till next issue to find out!

"PREVIEW SPEED DAMAGE SPEED POS 10TH DAMAGE LAPS POS LAPS SUPER CARS 2 GREMLIN Fields are currently putting Super Cars 2 together for Gremlin. As you can gather from the screenshots, it's another overhead eightway scroller but this time the screen is split in two to accomodate some pulse-racing twoplayer action (a single After the phenomenal success of their last game, Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge, Magnetic screen is used when only one person wants to play)! The courses aren't completely flat this time (unlike a lot of other games of this ilk) and you'll find yourself driving up ramps, under bridges and jumping massive gaps in the scenery! The game promises to be everything its predecessor should have been with more weapons and attachments for your car. We've had a good look at an early version of the game and it's shaping up quite nicely. The graphics and sound are great and the iner tia as you control your Super Car is very realistic. Gremlin are earning themselves a reputation for quality road racers, and Super Cars 2 could well be their best yet! VERSION AMIGA DATE TBA PRICE .99 11 101 "


"PREVIEW 000:20 With super-smooth scrolling, great cartoon graphics and a large amount of levels, Chuck Rock is progressing very nicely indeed and as soon as the game is ready we'll be reviewing it in CVG... CHUCK ROCK CORE DESIGN Take control of the eponymous Mr Rock himself, a caveman with a mission: to rescue the woman of his dreams, mercilessly held hostage by the twisted Gary Gritter (Boo!! Hiss!!). This involves traversing five levels of eight-way scrolling Stone Age excitement each with a number of sub-levels to conquer Mr Gritter's cohorts infest each level but Chuck can either bounce them away with his huge Stone Age belly, use the weapons that are cluttering the place up, or employ his Neanderthal might to \"chuck\" large \"rocks all over the shop WWW WORLD CLASS LEADERBOARD US GOLD IS Gold have a reputation for producing quality games on the Sega Master System and this looks set to continue with the Sega versions of ACcess' golfing classic, World Class Leaderboard. Like the original, the action is made very realistic by superb 3D animation and courses featuring trees, lakes and bunkers. Leaderboard looks likes taking the honours as the best Sega golf game around and it also looks like being the first golf game on the handheld Game Gear! This version looks like being basically the same as the Master System game with only screen shape differences separating the two VERSION AMIGA ST DATE TBA TBA PRICE .99  24.99 VERSION MASTER SYSTEM GAME GEAR DATE APRIL TBA PRICE     102 "

".PREVIEW POPULOUS Not only have TecTECMAGIK Not only have Tecmagik improved the original specification, but the game still plays as swiftly as the Amiga and Megadrive verCollowing on from their first Sega Master System smash, PacMania, Tecmagik are currently putting together a version of Populous for Sega's 8bit console. From what we've seen of the conversion it looks extremely promising with all the features of the 16-bit game crammed in and then some! The programmers at Tecmagik have added to the original by putting not 5000 worlds in their conversion! That's a whole lot of conquering for you potential meglomaniacs out there! Technically speaking, Populous looks like being one of the greatest Sega carts ever! sion! We wait with bated breath for the finished product... F-15 STRIKE EAGLE MICROPROSE The F-15 has been seeing a whole lot of action over in the Gulf as of late, and is soon to carry on the tradition on the ST and Amiga. Microprose are just about finished on the ST and Amiga versions of their cracking F. 15 Il which are being programmed in the UK by the team who produced F-19. Unlike that chart-topper, F-15 Il is very much a thinking man's blast 'em up, with enormous combat zones and superlast 3D graphics. Microprose hope that improved 3D routines will make the ST and Amiga versions even faster than the PC version, and they're adding two new theatres of war for bud. ding Top Guns!
