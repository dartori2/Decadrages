"ED FIRST W elcome to the new-look Computer and Video Games! After thoroughly digesting the results of last year's questionnaire (bet you didn't realise they were printed on banana flavour paper), we thought you would appreciate a new look to Britain's biggest-selling computer games mag. I won't waste space here by detailing all the changes we've made, because you can read all about them on page 8. But suffice it to say that you now have even more of the latest games info than ever before (we've reviewed no less than 70 games this month), and all for the same measly price of .30! Naturally, if you have any thoughts or comments to make on the new look, please don't hesitate to write 'em down and send 'em in. With all this redesigning work going on, this hasn't been an easy month... and it was made even worse by the arrival of the office Super Famicom! The problem is that it's so good that it tempts weak-willed reviewers away from their word-processors and fills their already sick minds with super-slick graphics, sound and gameplay! Even I haven't been able to resist and I'm ashamed to say that I have been staying behind after hours to sneak extra goes on the very wonderful Pilot Wings. Needless to say, this is definitely a machine with a future and you will definitely be seeing more of it in the pages of CVG over the coming months...

"REVIEW_1 5252 .99 AMEGADRIVE BY ELECTRONIC ARTS This is to specify which machine the particular game is being reviewed on, with price and software house. Dattle and Roll are two snakes not your ordinary var. iety, however, these two live in a strange world of chequerboard landscapes, seas, waterfalls, stereo speakers, and, of all things, manholes! Their fate in life is to get from level to level by eating enough Nibbly Pibblys small creatures that infest the landscapes to become heavy enough to ring a bell at the top of a weighing machine, which in turn will open a door to the next level. The all-new CVG HIT! logo to make it easier for you to select the games worth buying, a game now needs to achieve an overall mark of 90% or over to earn a HIT. So listen up, softCOS you want one of these, you've got to make sure your games make the grade! This information is essentially to give you an idea of what the game's all about the storyline, what the player's goals are and how to go about achieving them. ALL CHANGE So, what exactly have we done to CVG to make it even better than before? Well, if you scan around the page, you'll see exactly what we've done to the reviews to make sure they're even more informative than ever before. Not only that, we've come up with a couple more changes which will make CVG the best computer games mag you could ever wish for: Here, we've taken a leaf out of our sister mag MEAN MACHINE's books a critical comment by either one reviewer (for single page reviews), or two (if the review is two pages or longer). So now you get a more authoritative team opinion instead of just that of a single reviewer! CHARTS The charts (due to popular, nay, incredible demand) now include top tens for the Sega Master System and the Nintendo Entertainment System. Not only that, but the Top 20 is now listed by machine sales In other words, which game has sold the most on a particular machine. This not only includes the main five formats, but Sega, NES and Game Boy titles as well! Phew! BYTESIZE Replacing the Budget and Update section, this is your own section of the mag-be you an Amiga or a Speccy owner, these bite-sized reviews give you a run-down on the latest stuff about. Although small in stature, you can rest assured that we take as much time reviewing these as we do with the main reviews (integrity plug number one). MEGADRIVE GRAPHICS 88 SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 88 LASTABILITY 88 OVERALL 88 We've replaced the old VALUE mark with the new LASTABILITY percentage although similar in function, the Lastability mark gives a better idea of how long you'll be playing that new Megadrive cart before stowing it in the cupboard under the stairs to gather dust. 008 "

"NEWS DIRECTIVE 4 SELL LIKE CRAZY! Ocean were the only UK company with a big stand in the Nintendo bit of the show, and they claim that their NES stuff is going down a treat, and that they actually sold out of Robocop carts this Christmas. Nice going. Above is Robocop on the Gameboy, which looks like it could well repeat that success Directive 5, buy it! Dateline: January 1991, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. The occasion: the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, with 1,550 exhibits, ranging from a bloke, a dog and a trestle table, to vast lavish jobbies you could get lost in all in all taking up a whacking 837,000 square feet. In three words, silly but big. Certainly big business, because in America alone a cool 40 billion quid or so crosses the counters every year in the eternal search for the perfect hi-fi, telly and Video game. Globe-trotting journo John Cook cruised the place to bring you the best of the action... MUTANT NINJA... TOADS? So you were the guy who bought 300,000 copies of Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, eh? Well, y'know the drillonce there's something successful, along comes the bandwagon. So how about a Nintendo game called Battletoads! You play this, um, well, there's no way of getting around this, you're a Toad in a jumpy, jumpy combat game that has little going for it other than being faintly bizarre. The question is are you game for a laugh? The other question is what will they think of next? (1 can think of a third question ED) DUNGEON MASTER-ISH You PC owners have grown old waiting for the PC version of Dungeon Master to come out don't worry though as two simi lar style games are on the way in glorious 256 VGA colour Boy do they look good.

"also Build Park SIM NINTENDO FOUR TIMES THE FUN OK, so you can link you Gameboy up to a friends and play two player games. But wouldn't it be good if you could link up to another and maybe another? Well now, up to four of you can play games together, with this fabby link up thing that you all plug into. The first game to be released that can utilise it is a Grand Prix racing game from Nintendo themselves, but they're working on others and at least one other company, Bullet Proof Software (who produced Gameboy Tetris), will be releasing something for it, namely a version of Hybrid Arts' old multiplayer 3D shoot 'em up, Midi Maze. Can't be bad! Sim City is, as they say, a global phenomenon, with the Japs in particular going gaga over the whole business. So here we have it on Nintendo It looks good, plays good and if you've been getting stick over the mindlessness of your cartridge collection, buy this place parents in front of the screen and tell them you're training to be a city planner. Jolly, jolly good this is a \"must buy for the NES LE CHEAP LYNX ANIMAL MAGIC Atari have been tinkering with the design of the Lynx and have come up with something smaller, lighter and a lot cheaper! The price of the basic unit? Only $99, or to you about . Yes a  Lynx, or half the price that you're buying it for now. Admittedly, for that price you don't get a game, link-up cable or power adaptor, but it's sure cheap! So you've got plenty of dosh to spend on those batteries that still only last two hours or so... The Sega Genesis (ie our Megadrive) had a huge amount of stuff on display for it from Sega themselves including the first real simulation on it from true blue Brits, Realtime Games) and others like Electronic Arts. Most impressive, though, was Sonic the Hedgehog, another jumpy jumpy game in the Mario mould, but with an astonishing turn of speed and great music. One of the best Genesis games yet, this cart is going to be the one to sicken your home computerowning friends. Luv it! NENUS O PC ENGINE THE ELEMENTARY CONSOLE NEC were showing a lot of stuff on the PC Engine (or Turbo grafx as it's called over there), including the impressive stuff from Cinemaware namely TV Sports Football and TV Sports Basketball. Most interesting, though, was some stuff on CD a whole range of it with Sherlock Holmes being the rabbest with some synchronised video images and voice, as Holmes explains his reasoning. Note however, the game is also on Commodore's CDTV, and runs a lot laster on that... THE HEDGEHOG 011 "


"GAMEBOY GETS SERIOUS! BRITAIN'S BIGGEST-SELLING COMPUTER GAMES MAG GIVES YOU THE FACTS! TERMINATOR Had enough of Bubble Bobble, Chase HQ or Power Racer? Well, worry not, for GameTek of America (under the new label of InfoGenius) are just about to release four new Game Paks aimed at those who want to use their Gameboys for more serious\" pursuits. Surprisingly enough, Spell Checker checks your spelling, but has the added bonus of a free calculator (at no extra cost)! The Personal Organiser Game Pak has room for over 200 'phone numbers and has built-in auto dialing facilities (for use with tonedialing telephone systems). There's also the Travel Guide, which contains plenty of info on the 20 most-visited American cities, and the French/English Translator does your mate's poncy Collins Gem enable him to play Batman on the sly? No UK release dates have been set for these items, but who knows? Pester your favourite import company enough and they might just bring some of these desirable items across The Pond... Ocean Software have announced that they own the rights to produce home computer versions of the forthcoming Schwarzenegger movie, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Arnle once again adopts the mantle of the killer cyborg that made him an international star, \"doing battle in a world where machines take on the form of human beings and good versus evil\" (sic). It seems a bit odd that the original movie was never fully licensed (how about it Ocean?), but hopefully the new game should help make up for it. What shape or form the game will take isn't known at the moment, but the game should be released to coincide with the movie's launch (probably Autumn of this year). Nintendo owners need not feel left out either, for word reaches our ears that an American developer, LJN are also producing a game based on the potentially blockbusting movie. MILLY'S COMPILATION CHAOS! HILL-BILLY System 3, renowned for the quality of their 8-bit wares are set to release a compilation of some of their finest hours. The pre mier 8-bit collection features Myth (superb platform/arcade puz zler). Vendetta (Last Ninja-esque arcade adventure with a por tion of Roadblasters thrown in for good measure). Flimbo's Quest (brill cutesy platform game) and Ninja Remix (an en hanced rehash of the Last Ninja series). For .99 on cas sette and .99 on disk, this compilation is an essential pur chase for all Spectrum, Amstrad and C64 owners. Expect to see it in the shops by the end of March. Remember the high speed, high thrill, low casualty car chases of those good ol' Duke boys and Sheriff Roscoe \"Peee\" Coltrane in the classic Dukes of Hazzard? Millennium obviously do, because their latest game, Moonshine Racers, owes more than a little to that classic slice of wholesome American entertainment. Their game involves you racing through the county's roadways delivering Moonshine (a home brewed, highly potent alcoholic beverage). Unfortunately, the local authorities aren't really too chuffed with your antics and have despatched their incompetent police force to deal with you with a variety of roadblocks and the like.

Not a bad selection, but we reckon it won't be too long before she trades in all these goodies for a brand new Super Famicom! Is this the ultimate piece of merchandise based on Nintendo's cuddly Italian plumber? The Super Mario Bros telephone enables Mario fans to speak down into a Marioesque pipe, with the cheeky hero popping out at the other end. There's even a little LED that flashes when you receive a call (obviously the bell isn't quite good enough). Other than that, it's just your common or garden tele-. phone. If you're interested in purchasing this deluxe item, the Super Mario Bros telephone has been seen for sale in larger branches of Dixons. "

An all-round street fighting hero is needed to traverse the five rounds-worth of horizontally scrolling screens. doling out violence to any member of Mad Gear who fancies their chances. The objective is to reach the end of round five, where the diabolical leader of Mad Gear is waiting for the Final Fight... HANKS Thanks to console in Concepts (0782 vie! 712759) Tor the loanot the cartridge used in this reviews a HEROES ANONYMOUS HOLLY HDO Mike Haggar is one brutal dude, who is pretty angry at having his daughter Jessica snatched by the Mad Gear. He's a muscular chap, who isn't very fast but he certainly knows how to hit someone... His sparring partner Cody isn't too chuffed either because Jessica just happened to be his girlfriend. Cody isn't as strong or brutal as Haggar, but he's far more athletic. Unfor tunately, he doesn't have as many moves as Haggar either. CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON During the game, our hero may come across various weaponry that he can use against his foes. The list includes knives ideal for throwing or stabbing), lead pipes, and even swords! These are either pinched from vanquished foes or found in the barrels that dot the landscape. Throwing foes at other assailants also causes damage, and results in some hilarious pile-ups!

One has you beating seven shades out of the Mad Gear boss' prized automobile, while the other is a time trial where the violence-crazed hero must break as many panes of glass as possible!

The graphics, sound and playability are almost identical to the coin-op and really show what the Famicom can do. Final Fight is simply the greatest beat'em up available on any console or computer and it's simply an essential purchase, and bodes very well for the future of Famicom games! RICHARD LEADBETTER 017 "


"REVIEWDI FISTS OF FURY The repertoire of moves available to our street fighting aces is many and varied. Haggar enjoys punching, throwing, headbutting and can even produce a mega-damaging jumping piledriver! Cody on the hand relies much more on his fists, though he's not adverse to throwing, kneeing or producing a terrifying flying roundhouse . guaranteed to floor any member of the evil Mad Gearl COMMENT Unlike Rich I'm not exactly struck on beat 'em ups, but I did enjoy Final Fight a great deal, and I'm happy to say that the Super Famicom version is nigh-on identical to the arcade! Audio-visually, as well as for sheer playability, there's no other beat 'em up to touch this on any machine and I don't make statements like that lightly! For one of the first releases on the Famicom, Final Fight is completely amazing, and a game that any self-respecting fight fan should go out and get NOW!

YOB: For a start there aren't even five games available for the Game Gear, so it's going to be a bit difficult to answer the last bit of your letter.

"Se REVIEW AMIGA .95 .95 ST BY US GOLD SUPER Monaco, our of the greatest road racing challenges await you in Super Monaco GP, the amazing Sega coin-op which napalmed the minds of arcadesters when it was released in 1989. But the arcade machine had only one track the mighty Monaco. US Gold have attempted to surpass the coin-op by adding three more! The aim of the game is simple. Whilst burning around the formula one tracks in your turbo-charged motor, all your arcade driving skills are tested to the limits as you fight your way to the front of the race. A position limit has been incorporated into the game which becomes more strict after every checkpoint. If your position in the race falls behind that limit, it's game over. MONACO MOTORING SELECT TRANSMISSION GalishaHTE PROFESSIO GISPEED MINUL SPEED BUM RUTINITIE Before the racing action begins in earnest, the player chooses which type of formula one monster he wishes take the wheel of. The automatic car is recommended to novices, as all the hassle of changing gear is taken care of by the computer. The fourspeed model is the next progression. It's more powerful than the automatic, but also a tad more difficult to control. For ferocious Formula One fiends, the seven speed model is the natural choice. It's a bitch to successfully control, but by crikey does it burn rubber or what? MEGA DRIVE COMMENT Although it can't hope to compare with the likes its arcade parent, this conversion is something US Gold should be justly proud. Although the car doesn't handle much like the coinop version, it's quite a challenge taking some of the tracks' corners especially when you're using a manual gearbox. So, playability-wise, this conversion's fine. The graphics are great as well with a lot of detail and a nippy turn of speed. My only gripe is the fact that there are only four tracks, I still find it hard to understand why US Gold didn't incorporate the world championship circuit (16 tracks) that was featured on the Megadrive version. Don't get me wrong, Super Monaco GP is a damn fine game on both the ST and Amiga. Lotus still rules, however as the best 16 bit road racer. RICHARD LEADBETTER SA 3999 128 678 12. Como o 3.89 0.P. 245 "


"IREVIEW P525 $8-98 8:3838 The route to actually taking part in the Monaco race is long and tortuous. Your first port-of-call is France and if you successfully conquer that grand prix marvel, there's the terrors of Brazil and then Spain to keep you occupied before you qualify for MonaCo. But beware, just like real-life racing, there's a chance that you will have to cope with wet conditions! Obviously, there's less likely to be a slippery track in Brazil than France (because it's hotter, y'see), but drivers who reach Monaco will have to race the circuit in both dry and wet conditions! 207 100'00\"98 -69 g. 99.99 COMMENT TYC Con UPDATE From what we've seen of the 8-bit versions of Super Monaco GP, they're all looking pretty hot. Probe are pretty much the masters of C64 road racers and so not surprisingly, the C64 version looks the most impressive of the 8 bit bunch. Sega have already released their own version of the game for the Master System and Megadrive and they're both excellent games. As Amiga race games go Super Monaco GP is pretty good, and the programmers at Probe deserve credit for trying to fit in as much of the arcade game as possible. However, although it sports features that even the Megadrive version couldn't provide, the game is by no means perfect. The trackside objects are in there in abundance, but they sometimes scroll past in such a way that they make it look like the car has stopped or slowed down to a crawl, making things a tad confusing, especially when a corner is approaching and you're not sure of your speed. This problem also makes the omission of the track diag. ram a little disconcerting, but after a while you get to learn where the curves and the straights are going to appear. I agree with Richard, that while this is a good conversion, It's not as playable as Gremlin's Lotus.

HEADSTONE RICE TERRY FIED PROOVCIMO CARLTON CRINGE 2 2 2. . After the terrific James Pond, I was expecting great things from Horror Zombies from the Crypt. Unfortunately, it's not quite as playable as their last game and the game concept itself isn't that much advanced from the days of Jet Set Willy (remember that?). The gratuitous lashings of \"horror\" add something of an atmosphere to the game, but it is more comical than horrifying. For example, when our hero dies he rips his own head off (!?). Horror Zombies from the Crypt has all the gore and terror of an episode of Doogle Howzer, MD, the most horrifying aspect of the game is its price. The low thrill factor doesn't warrant the price I'm afraid. RICHARD LEADBETTER us BMX 1 EERIE ICONS As you run about the scrolling castle, there's two things you're likely to meet.

"5252 REVIEW PC ENGINE BY HUDSON SOFT .00 99999 Domber Man's girlfriend has been kidnapped by an Devil gang of ruthless killers who don't like Bomber Man much. Not surprisingly, Bomber Man isn't exactly over the moon about his woman being taken away from him and pausing only to scoop up his bottomless bag of bombs, decides to stage a daring rescue attempt! Hurrahl Unfortunately, before Bomber Man can reach his im. prisoned ladyfriend, he's got to work his way through countless mazes dropping bombs in order to dispose of all the nasty creatures. Bomber Man has got to be quick though when a bomb is dropped, our hero has to make sure he's not in the path of the explosion or else! As well as being able to play solo, Bomber Man can take up to four of his mates with him (if you have a fiveway joypad tap). Alternatively, five players can take part in a bomb battle in which they have to blow up the other players until they are the last one standing! THANKS Thanks to ConsoleConcepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the cartridge used in this review. EXPLOSIVE EXCITEMENT! 9310   During Bomber Man's dynamite-laden exploits, he'll probably come across the stone blocks dotted around the landscape. Some of these can be blasted open in order to receive extra goodies. Included in the goodie line-up are bomb power-ups (bigger explosions), the ability to drop more than one bomb at once, and speed-up boots! COMMENT 6 I saw this and I thought, \"Nahhhh\". Then I played it and I thought, \"Yes, yes, yes!\" Games don't come much simpler, and they rarely look as basic, but Bomber Man manages to be brilliant in spite of it all. You can tell when a game is great when people in our office start \"disappearing\" when they shouldn't and then later on you find them swapping level passwords and Bomber Man has had just that effect. It has the uncanny ability to keep the player totally fixated much longer than is healthy, and if you have a joypad tap, you'll have no shortage of volunteers to join you on a multi-player explosion excursion. Another tremendous release from the PC Engine specialists at Hudsonsoft! PAUL GLANCEY 034 "


"IREVIEW PAUSE        1 1 TT 11 1 1 1  COMMENT 11111         PAUN Bomber Man is very, very simple but just completely absorbing and totally addictive, especially when played with five players and a joypad tap. The graphics are nothing special at all, but the sound is brill with catchy music that totally suits the frenetic action! Don't be put off by the simple exterior of this game, once it's got its teeth into you, it won't let go and it'll do every in its power to humiliate and degrade your gamesplaying prowess! You'll never regret adding this game to your PC Engine collection. It's brill, fab and it's tops in my house and no mistake. / Telelog  RICHARD LEADBETTER PC ENGINE GRAPHICS 70 SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 96 LASTABILITY 93 OVERALL 93 035 "

Son of Dracula COMMENT The scourge of Transylvania, Count Dracula, has been imprisoned by his age-old enemy, Professor Van Helsing, and is being held captive far across the land. The only one who can save The Count is his odds ball offspring, who would rather luck into a can or toma foes than sink his teeth into some unsuspecting victims neck! What this all boils down to is a wacky multi-level plat form romp in the PC Kid mould, with Drac Jr up against rampaging orange blobs, stone heads, wooden crosses flying rubber ducks, and some of the strangest end of level guardians ever, including a Jason Voorhees (ol FB day 13th fame) lookalikel Can the valiant vampire suc ceed or will he end up in a box with a well done stake PC Kid was a real hoot, and I'm glad to see that more games of this ilk are appearing on the Engine Son of Dracula being one of the best yet. The graphics are colourful and well animated, and about as cute as you could possibly want, and the game is just so addictive, once you start playing you won't want to stop. My only niggle is that the first few levels are a touch on the easy side, but once through those, you really need your wits about you. If platform fun 'n' frolics are your thang, check it out. ROB SWAN We'd like to see Drac get his V teeth into this big, bad woll! SOMETHING TO GET YOUR TEETH INTO 80 Drac Jr's not powerless against his foes not only is he armed with his dad's magical staff (which fires bolts of white light), but he can also collect suits of armour (which protect him for a certain number of collisions, and also enhance the staff's firepower). and other items of clothing, including a nifty pair of Doc Martens, which allow Drac to stomp on nasties' heads!

Reclaimed by the seas which had created her, Midwinter was abandoned by her people, in search of a home on any friendly island standing tall above the rising seas. \"In the more temperate equatorial reaches of the Atlantic, only one of forty-two islands held out a hand, welcoming the survivors into the Atlantic Federation, a force for peace, prosperity and democracy. But the new home is threatened by the evil Saharan Empire, a mighty military dictatorship based on the African mainland, already enslaving the other island, communities, and ultimately intent on conflict with the Federation The enslaved islands are home to freedom fighters looking to break free from Saharan domination and join the Federation. The mammoth task facing the Federation is to covertly aid the liberation of as many islands as possible before the Saharan Empire makes its final push for Atlantic domination.

"SPS REVIEW .99 AMIGA BY RAINBOW ARTS COMMENT After defeating the evil three-headed demon, Morgul, the warrior Turrican has now got to face his greatest challenge travel to the far off world of Landorin, and save the inhabitants from the deadly forces of the Machine a powerful bio-mechanical unit, controlling hundreds of drones and mutants which constantly seek out the weakened inhabitants in order to destroy them utter ly! Your task as Turrican, is to fight your way through the levels, blasting the aliens as you go, but if things get a little sticky, you can either use a blast-wall to clear everything on screen, or you can even transform into a gyroscope, which can leave mines in its path! Flippin' hell! With it's arcade quality scroll, amazing colour fades and jam-hot playability, Turrican 2 is something of an awesome game! The graphics are simply amazing and incredibly smooth, and easily surpass the original Turrican game. There's even a Z-Outstyle horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up level in there somewhere for you to find and it's just the business! Arcade junkies need look no further for the ultimate Amiga shoot 'em up experience. FIRE AND FORGET PAUL GLANCEY One of the main features in Turrican II is the greatly enhanced firepower. By collecting icons the weapons Turrican can accumulate and use are: The bog-standard cannon starts as a single shot weapon, but extra power-ups turn it into a three-way, then a fiveway shot. Destructo-wall you begin the game with three of these smart weapons, which annihilate everything on the screen with its expanding laser force field. Gyroscope transforms Turrican into an indestructable, mine-laying gyroscope! Essential when the going gets tough. Ynys Plasma cannon more powerful than the ordinary cannon, but doesn't have quite the same coverage. Powerful in the right hands... 2008 The Megaweapon for a limited time, Turrican is transformed into Gyroscope form and bounces around the screen at a high rate of knots firing off every weapons system known to man or robot! 18 040 "

THE FINAL FIGHT COMMENT If you thought Turrican was one of the biggest and best blasters available, think again! Turrican II is absolutely stunning in all respects the graphics are brilliant, and the sound is a real treat to the ears, with lots of explosions and speech, and some cracking soundtracks too! As far as playability is concerned, Turrican II is one of the most addictive and playable blasters I've seen in many a moon.

"See REVIEW CBM 64 .99 BY THALAMUS FREE! A FUZZY WUZZY IN EVERY PACK! trange creatures from the planet Blot are desperate ly trying to escape their planet and the associated stigma of being called Blotians (pretty uncool name, huh?). So, these creatures pile into a colony craft and head over to Earth to start anew. For a start, they're now called Fuzzy Wuzzies (sounds about as hip as Lionel Blair) and the island they've landed on is now called \"The Hippest Place in the known Universe\". Got that? Well, the island's inhabitants are pretty miffed at having their home renamed and are even more narked at having a bunch of annoying cute creatures running amok all over it. So, these cunning demons invite the Fuzzy Wuzzies to a wild party and then proceed to kidnap them and lock them in a torture chamber. Fortunately, one Fuzzy Wuzzy was barfing his guts out (too much beer, see) when the kidnapping took place, and now he's out for vengeance! Clyde Radcliffe is his name and he means business! Messing about on the river with Clyde Radcliff! BEHIND THE STORYLINE Behind the very bizarre scenerio lurks a pretty straightforward platform game the object being simply to reach the right hand side of the horizontally scrolling playfield. Along the way. Clyde can blat meanies with a variety of extra weaponry and hold down the fire button to unleash some fiery death breath frying any meanies that get in the way! SCORE O955 CREA COMMENT CLYDE RADCLIFF EXTERMINATES ALL THE URIE Clyde chucks his bombs about, and why not? Creatures is simply a fun game! Blatting the various meanies is good fun, but the huge variety in the levels and the different tactics required to progress makes it a real winner! C64 owners are going to love this, but there's a couple of rough edges. For example, there's plenty of ramps around but Clyde's got to jump up them rather than just walk up them. Small niggles apart, Creatures ain't 'alf bad and C64 owners should buy this now. RICHARD LEADBETTER 044 UPDATE No other versions of Creatures are currently planned, but if the situation changes, we'll let you know. "


"22TREVIEW IREVIEW 2525 SHOPPING At the end of each level, there's a shop where Clyde can purchase some more weaponry to add to his collection. But the shopkeeper isn't interested in money. Well, he probably is, but his idea of money is an assortment of furry little animals! These are dotted throughout the levels, just waiting for Clyde to pick them up A rather bad case of hali-tosis and no mistake! COMMENT EmE OC 16 STURES Creatures takes me back to the good old days of C64 games, when playability was the important factor not graphical flair. Creatures has both, and mixes them to make a game which is both good to look and listen to, as well as being addictive as heck!

IV and here he is, out to defeat the evil King Koopa and rescue Princess Toadstool from a fate worse than being sealed in a vault with a hi-fi and a lifetime's supply of Val Doonican records! Following a similar style to Mario's previous adventures on the NES, the mustachioed monster-mangler has to make his way through seven platform-strewn worlds, each filled with an assortment of wacky creatures all of them out to make Mario's life particularly unpleasant. Mario can fight back, however, by jumping on them, or collecting all manner of power-ups to increase his creepy-crawly-crushing capabilities. Watch out for magic blocks along the way. Biff them from beneath and coins cascade into Mario's dungaree pocket collect 100 of these and he's awarded one extra life! MAGIC MUSHROOMS (AND OTHER WEIRDNESS) Maniacal madness with Mario as he enters the water level. Like the previous three Mario games, mushrooms can be used to give Mario a better chance of survival. A standard mushroom will increase Mario's size, where as a green mushroom will give him an extra life. But that's not all flowers will provide Mario will fireballs, which kill off nasties with one touch! 048 "


"REVIEW Juron MANIU DOU. DIZZY DINOSAURS If you're really in a fix, magic eggs can be found along the way, which produce a dinosaur for our hero to ride! Dino's not defenceless, either a press of the fire button will send his tongue lashing out, and if any enemy is unfortunate to be nearby, he'll be dragged into Dino's maw, and can be spat back out as fireballs! COMMENT I thought there was no way that Mario Ill on the NES could be topped for sheer playability, but then along comes Mario IV, and blows it away! Super Mario World is a brilliant example of what the Super Famicom is capable of. The graphics are absolutely brilliant, with some fantastic visual gags (the look of surprise on a nasty's face when it's grabbed by the dinosaur is hilarious) and the marvellous music (complete with honky-tonk piano samples) really shows what the Super Famicom's PCM sound chip can do. Quite apart from all that gameplay is just so addictive, you'd better be prepared to stuck to your screens until you've completed it! Overall, a totally fantastic game what more can I say?

MARIO A LIFE 18-22 After arcade starring roles in Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Mario Brothers (which also featured Luigi) and Super Mario Brothers, Mario moved to the NES in a conversion of SMB. This last title was hailed as one of the best games of all time, and with Mario fans everywhere screaming for a sequel, Nintendo followed it with Super Mario Brothers II, which starred Mario, Luigi, Princess Mushroom and Toad the Mushroom Retainer. Coming soon to the NES is Mario 3. whose gameplay has much in common with Famicom Mario World! 20 COMMENT 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 A High above in the sky, Mario strikes gold with the aid of his magic cape! My word! What a truly terrific game! With seven worlds and over a hundred sub-levels, Mario IV has incredible depth of gameplay. Jaz managed to complete the game and he'd only seen 46 of the sub-levels, so there's plenty of lastability in there even after you've blatted the final nasty (and you've got to see that to believe it!).

Now we're having fun with F-15 Strike Eagle II. A fighter pilots dream, as it is pure action all the way.

"LOTUS ESPRIT TURBO CHALLENGE PLAYER'S GUIDE Out and about on just about every home com. puter system going, Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is one cracking game! Featuring simultaneous two-player action and a playfield of 20 LOtuses to race against, times can get a little rough. So try out C+VG's mega player's guide for maximum enjoyment from this awesome road racer! THE QUICK GETAWAY TWO-PLAYER TACTICS To grab as many positions as possible at the beginning, use the pitlane the other players completely ignore it! Watch out though stay too long in there and you'll automatically slow down! One great tactic to remember is to slow down when taking corners and steer into the oncoming path of the other player's Lotus. If he doesn't wham into the back of your car, he's a lot more likely to zoom off the road, hitting an obstacle and losing far more time! Just remember though one of you has got to make the top ten to progress to the next track! GO! REFUELING Some of the tracks require a lot more fuel than can be initially packed into your Lotus fuel tank. On the vast majority of races refueling is best reserved for the last lap. this way you can best judge how much time you need spend in the pits. When entering the pit lane, the best way to slow down is to just clip a roadside obstacle. If all goes well you shouldn't end up off the road, but should slow down to a stop rather quickly.... GEAR BOX GEAR RUH NO SMOKIN As the instructions say, although the automatic Lotus doesn't accelerate quite as well as the manual, it can still reach the same top speeds as the manual gear box. Since changing up and down can be a real pain at times, it's best to stick to the automatic gearbox it's still possible to reach the end of the hard level's tracks with it. If you do have a hankering to choose, a manual gearbox then always choose FX rather than music at the start of a game. This way it's easier to tell when to change, gear by the sound of the engine. LANDSCAPE LAFFS Some of Lotus races do not take place on the road! Other terrain includes sand and ice. Ice is simple. Just play on as usual and use the roadside obstacles to gauge where you are on the road. The other cars automatically go slower as well so victory should be simple. The steering is very unresponsive on sandy tracks, so lay off the accelerator on corners or else! LOTUS HANDLING ASTEROIDS? Quite a lot of people seem to just accelerate and hope for the best. This is a bit of a stupid thing to do, as some of the corner ing required can be handled with ease just by laying off the accelerator. The handling of your Lotus also increases and this is one of your best opportunities to gain a few positions. There's plenty of asteroids in the Amiga version of Lotus! Sim. ply change player one's name to MONSTER and player two's to SEVENTEEN. Start the game and admire those asteroids or something. 055 "


"PRINCE OF PERSIA PLAYER'S GUIDE LEVEL SIX SWASHBUCKLING Our very own Richard Leadbetter provides hapless platforming prince players, with the ultimate set of tricks and tactics, guaranteed to help aspiring heroes through the twelve tortorous levels in the this Amiga/ST/PC masterpiece! Level six is occupied by a rather fat sword slinger, who can only be butchered with this tactic. Advance and strike immediately. The blow will be deflected, so parry suddenly to avoid the fat one's counter attack. There is now a split second delay where he is vulnerable. Strike immediately after your parry to send the obese bodyguard packing. TAKE CONTROL! A SPIKE UP THE BOTTOM A lot of people tend to claim that the hero is a mite unresponsive at times, especially when it comes to performing intricate running jumps. If you're one of those people try using the keyboard, as the key arrangement dispenses with the tricky joy stick diagonals. Remember, it takes the prince a while to per form a running jump, so it's best to push the joystick up (and to the left or right of course) a couple of steps before you want him to jump Watch out for holes in the ground they're rather deadly, sending fatal spikes zooming up between our hero's legs (ooch!). The trick here is either to jump them (pretty obvious really), or if there's a platform above, carefully step into the spike pit and jump up. Just don't fall down, that's all! HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE! Jamming the joystick in the diagonal direction without running makes the hero perform a from-the-spot jump which cov equivalent of two tiles. A running jump covers three, but you have more control over a normal jump and by holding down the fire button, you can hang on to the edge of the opposite platform and pull yourself up to safety SAVING YOURSELF If you're falling long distances, you can sometimes save your self by holding down the firebutton. The hero will then grab on to any platforms that he passes. By the way, remember to have that button jammed down at the beginning of level seven otherwise you'll fall to certain doom! Arrgghhh! RAZOR CRUSHERS CUNNING SWORDPLAY The biggest problem you'll have with these is being forced into them if you're losing a sword fight (there shouldn't be much of a problem here if you're a skilled lighter). Getting through a field of crushers is best achieved by stepping through them carefully. It's best to start moving just as the crusher closes. That's about it, really. Most of the sword wielding maniacs in Prince of Persia are, pretty simple to despatch. Just stay still and wait for them to enter the range of your chopper. That's it! On later levels, things get a bit tougher. Skeletons rise to attack you and can not be killed. You have to keep advancing, forcing them off the platform and down to certain doom! POTION PUZZLING Save your potions for when you really need them! Most of them just put your strength back up one notch. The ones that are really hard to reach usually increase the amount of energy the hero can carry. Watch out on level iwo, when two potions are next to one another. The one on the left poisons you so, watch it. There's also an anti-gravity polion in the game, which can help you to survive one really long fall. Good eh? Just don't expect to see it until around level seven... SECRET ROOMS Sometimes, a roof tile is loose and could lead the way to a vital extra life-giving potion (level three for example). Jump up and hit the ceiling and all wobbly tiles will be revealed. To remove loose tiles, just jump up at the tile, making sure you're not under it when it comes crashing down... 056 "

We've got rid of the old Update and Budget columns, and now we'll be reviewing any new releases we can't fit into the main body of the magazine in a Byte Size column devoted to the relevant machine so that's even more reviews for the \"pound in your pocket\"! As well as the reviews, we've also got Coming Soon features, which list the major games which will be \"coming soon (hence the name) to the pages of C+VG. Watch out for reviews of those in forthcoming issues! A pretty poor month for Amstrad owners, sad to say six budget releases, and only three are worth writing home about... OPERATION WOLF HIT SQUAD .99 Op Wolf was an arcade smash, a C+VG HITI conversion and now, a budget now, a budget TURBO KART RACER re-release. Simply blast through six levels of scrolling enemy territory, in PLAYERS .99 order to save kidnapped hostages. This is the best of the 8 bit versions, with colourful graphics and addictive gameplay, and well worth hunting down for Turbo kart racing may be fun, but this 'simulation certainly isn't! Ultra-jerky three quid scrolling and single colour karts that judder around the screen don't inspire OVERALL confidence, and the frustrating playability finishes this right off. Pretly dire, so leave this well alone. OVERALL MIAMI TURBO GT 22% PLAYERS .99 HAWK STORM HAWK STORM According to the blurb, this is a super-charged race around the streets of PLAYERS .99 Miami, but this is about as exciting as a night out with Ronald McDonald Blocky graphics and poor playability make this a budget game to leave well Another Players budget release, Hawk Storm pits you against the evil Neviks alone boy racers would do better to have a look at WEC Le Mans. in this platform blast 'em caper. It's not overly pretty to look at, and it suffers OVERALL from being extremely difficult to play. Real hard men might get a few hours of 51% enjoyment out of it, but softies steer clear. OVERALL 46% 85% NNNNNNNNNNNNNN  222222 IMPOSSIBALL PLAYERS .99 This Hewson re-release puts you in control over a ball, which must bounce over myriad horizontally scrolling levels, each pitted with deadly obstacles which must be overcome. Although pretty tough, and not overly colourful, Im. possiball is a game that'll have you hooked for a fair old time. OVERALL 80% WEC LE MANS HIT SQUAD .99 Another coin-op hit, this puts you in control of a Jaguar racing car, screaming around the famed Le Mans circuit. Well received when it was first released, WEC Le Mans is still a remarkably addictive racer, and for three quid, is a lot better value than some of the full-priced racers about Well worth a look.

COMPANY OCEAN PRICE .99 AMIGA US GOLD DOMARK GAME NAVY SEALS SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND HYDRA SKULL AND CROCODONC TOKI CRUISE FOR A CORPSE EPIC .99 TBA 1993 R RRR OCEAN .99 After the Christmas onslaught of mega releases, there's not really that much of note going on in Amigaville. Highlight of the month must be the breathtakIng Speedball 2, but enough of this banter... On with the reviews! US GOLD OCEAN .99 .99 SPEEDBALL 2 IMAGEWORKS .99 Incredible! The ST version was good, but the Amiga version has everything! Smooth scrolling, a new 32 colour pitch and totally amazing sound (you can even hear the ice-cream vendor in the crowd!). And there's fabbo intro music composed by new band Nation 12. For sheer playability and depth, Speedball 2 is probably the best sports game ever seen on the Amiga! Go for it, or alternatively feel rather stupid. 97% DRAGON'S LAIR: TIMEWARP READYSOFT .95 Buy Dragon's Lair, Space Ace and Escape From Singe's Castle? If you did and you enjoyed them, then you'll love this. The problem is, here at C+VG we like a bit of interaction and just like it's predecessor, Timewarp is just a case of moving the stick in the right direction at the right millisecond. Lovely graphics of course, but the lack of gameplay means this can't be recommended. OVERALL 42% OVERALL WARLOCK THE AVENGER MILLENNIUM .99 Remember Druid the C64 Gauntlet-type classic? Now Millennium have produced 16 bit versions with nice presentation screens, a new set of dungeons and meanies, but the same Gauntlet-style gameplay. If you enjoyed Druid on the C64 then you'll love this. However, even with the new dungeons the game concept definitely seems a tad dated, and the rough graphics don't help much. Try before you buy. OVERALL 72% TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES IMAGEWORKS .99 Turtles cleaned out the pockets of gamers everywhere over Christmas, but we've only just sent the game for review! It's basically the same as the Spec cy and Amstrad versions reviewed a couple of months ago and is quite a good laugh to play. Unfortunately, the scrolling's jerky and there's a long delay as the game decompacts. Recommended to Turtle fans only. OVERALL 76% WRATH OF THE DEMON READYSOFT .99 As the saying goes: \"pretty graphics do not a good game make and this certainly goes for Wrath of the Demon. The game features some stunning graphics with sound which is very similar to Psygnosis' Shadow of the Beast. The game's lack of playability, however, makes for a very average game. OVERALL 55% OBITUS PSYGNOSIS .99 It's \"free\" T-shirt time again from Psygnosis in their latest graphical extravaganza. A three disk epic quest awaits you with the action displayed in nicelyanimated 3D graphics. You control the game with the aid of a novel point 'n' click interface, but the action is unfortunately rather unexciting. RPG buffs best look at Dungeon Master (or if you've already got that, Chaos Strikes Back) both are far more engrossing. 64% 267196 lo CFJEFE OVERALL EXTRA DISK EXCITEMENT Finally! Dungeon Master fans are going to love Chaos Strikes Back, the supplement disk which provides extra levels for the greatest RPG on the Amiga.. It's incredibly tough though, even with the new selection of beeled-up characters, so potential buyers are advised to build up their strength on Dungeon Master before checking out this stunning add-on. Also, Core Design have just released the Corporation Mission Disk. The gameplay is much the same as before but the map layouts are completely new and there's plenty of new monsters to blast. At .99, this is great value lo fans of the original game. "

The only thing of note to appear on the old C64 of late are the two new Thalamus games, Creatures (which is fabbo and no mistake) and Summer Camp. Otherwise it's time to take a trip to Budgetsville, Arizona for this month's round-up. BATMAN THE CAPED CRUSADER HIT SQUAD .99 Time to dust off that cape and get back into crime bustin' with Batman in this comic strip style romp (which isn't based at all on the movie). The felon fighting action isn't bad and there's two adventures to solve. Three quid is pretty value for this rather entertaining game. One of the better budget games doing the rounds OVERALL 83% TURBO KART RACER PLAYERS .99 Take two player action, a racing track and a few turbo karts and what do you have? This new Players release, that's what. Unfortunately, you've also got laughably tiny sprites, banal backgrounds and a miniscule playing area. Turbo Kart Racer is a dire release that isn't worth 50p, let alone three sovs. OVERALL 24% FIRELORD PLAYERS .99 Steve Crow's old Hewson arcade adventure went down a treat when it was first released on the Speccy ages ago. The C64 version is exactly the same, featuring the same line of repetitive running around and searching. The game concept's rather old now and Firelord is pretty tedious by today's stand. ards. One for arcade adventure fans only. OVERALL 61% SPECTRUM PRICE .99  10.99 Oh dear, oh dear a very sad time for Speccy owners Just three (count 'em) games, and only one of those is halfway decent.

GAME COMPANY TOTAL RECALL OCEAN TOKI OCEAN SUPER MONACO GP US GOLD GAUNTLET III US GOLD HYDRA DOMARK SKULL AND CROSSBONES DOMARK SHADOW DANCER US GOLD .99 .99 .99 .99 .99 RETURN OF THE JEDI HIT SQUAD .99 The third in the trilogy, Jedi differs from the other two insofar as it uses a Zaxxon-style viewpoint rather than vector graphics, but even so, this Speccy conversion of the Atari coin-op is dull, repetitive, and not a whole lot of fun. Recommended to fanatics of the films and the coin-op only. OVERALL 43% MIAMI TURBO GT PLAYERS .99 Although fairly naff on the other 8 bits, the Spectrum version of this Chase HQ-alike is actually quite enjoyable, but after a few plays, the fun factor drops considerably leaving this a rather dull racer to play. If screeching about in a car is your buzz, take a gander at WEC Le Mans instead. OVERALL 72% TOP CAT HI-TEC .99 or TC and his gang are back, to save Benny the Ball from becoming cat food at the hands of a dastardly butler.

It's an absorbing game which puzzle fans (especially the slower thinkers for whom Klax was too nippy) should love. OVERALL 84% ROBOSQUASH ATARI .99 Effectively Robosquash is a 3D version of the arcade antique, Pong. The idea is that you hit the ball past your opponent's paddle which is at the far end of the court, and stop him hitting it back past yours. Power ups and smart graphics liven things up a little, but there isn't quite enough variety to keep the game exciting for very long. OVERALL 70% RAMPAGE ATARI .99 Up to four ComLynxed players take control of giant mutants in this conversion of the Bally-Midway skyscraper-smashing coin-op. The graphics are spot-on throughout, but the there just isn't that much to the gameplay, and anyone but fans of the original will find demolishing building after building a mite tedious. OVERALL 60% 868500012 RYGAR ATARI .99 Take control of a barbarian king armed with deadly spiked yo-yo then legit through 23 scrolling levels of caves and volcanic backdrops, clearing them of evil creatures. The coin-op was never a hit, and this conversion is just as dull. The run-and-bash gameplay isn't too stimulating, and there's no significant variation from level to level. Even the graphics aren't that good, so only rabid fans of the original need apply. OVERALL 46% 071 "

Call them on (0782) 712759. MEHADRIVE TEMY STAGE Crikey! Billions of Megadrive releases both official and import, but hardly any of them are much cop! For the official machines, EA have launched Zany Golf while Virgin have released ESWAT, Arnold Palmer's Golf, Super Real Basketball, Super League Baseball, Moonwalker, Ghostbusters, Twin Hawk and Phantasy Star II a decent bunch apart from World Soccer which doesn't even deserve to be sneezed on. Here are some more import Megadrive reviews to keep you occupied... PAUSE SH PLISH WONDERBOY 3 SEGA .00 It's time to get out that nappie and ready yourself for yet another test of your platform shoot 'em up skills. With its jolly graphics and appealing sound, Wonderboy 3 is initially quite enjoyable, but the action is quite monotonous so it all gets pretty tedious after a while. One for arcade fans only. OVERALL 67% GAIN GROUND SEGA .00 Best described as Gauntlet without the scrolling (and the enjoyment), the objective of Gain Ground is to just reach the exit on the other side of the screen shooting soldiers on the way. It's very simple and very boring. You'd have to be stark raving mad to part with thirty odd quid for this. and you can't even use it to fertilise the garden. OVERALL 49% DANGEROUS SEED NAMCOT .00 Fly your Anti-Alien Doom Mobile across several stages of vertically-scrolling scenery in this shoot 'em up non-event. This is a tedious effort to be sure, and even the power-ups are nothing new. It's very easily completed, too, so only extremely inexperienced laser fans have a chance of getting their money's worth OVERALL 50% DARIUS 2 TAITO .00 Yes, you guessed it! Another horizontally shoot 'em up with extra weaponry! Lordy, when will these programmers come up with a more original idea? Still, Darius has nice graphics and sound and is pretty playable as well. As we said before though, Hellfire is still the best blast around. OVERALL 79% PAUSE HEAVY UNIT TOHO .00 Yet another tempting opportunity to race across a multi-directional scrolling playfield dishing out photon violence to anyone who dares cross your path. Though it's not particularly pretty, Heavy Unit is quite a jolly game, but Hell fire still rules supreme. OVERALL 75% SWORD OF SODAN ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 Remember Sword of Sodan on the Amiga? It had brilliant graphics, sound but pretty tedious gameplay. Much the same applies to this Megadrive version, except that the graphics and sound are actually worse! Just walking around slashing things with your chopper is exceptionally monotonous after a couple of plays, and there isn't even the amusing speech to alleviate the boredom. 57% OVERALL 072 "

Console your selves (arf arf) by buying a copy of the brill Snake, Rattle and Roll (reviewed on page 86) or Solar Jetman (page 82). Here's a quick round up of the rest, which, we're sorry to say, don't have prices because Nintendo's price list wasn't quite up to date... RESCUE NINTENDO TBA Terrorists have taken over an embassy, and it's down to your crack elite SAS squad to go in there and dispense lead death to any terrorists who dare cross your path. Don't kill the hostages though you've got to save them. The game's divided into sub-sections and each is pretty entertaining but rather easy. Leave this well alone.

The game is divided into a number of sub-sections with plenty of ectoplasmic excitement. Unfortunately, although a good laugh, this game has awful graphics, average sound and isn't exactly a steal at the price. Avoid OVERALL 61% BAD DUDES NINTENDO TBA Yet more beat 'em up thrills as the player adopts the mantle of a Bad Dude traversing the horizontally scrolling playfield dispensing untold levels of violence to other Bad Dudes. Flickery graphics, tedious sound and yawnworthy gameplay make this one NES cart to avoid. Go for Double Dragon 2 instead. OVERALL 49% MEGAMAN 2 NINTENDO .95 Dr Willy's back, and it's down to Megaman to beat off all of his robotic henchmen, blag their weapons and make his way to Wily's castle for the final con frontation. This platform masterpiece is only beaten by the Mario series for sheer brilliance, and ranks as a totally fantastic and highly addictive game! We've had an imported version since last August and we're STILL playing it. Buy it as soon as you can you won't be disappointed! OVERALL 95% PINBOT NINTENDO .95 Yet more brilliance from Rare the dudes behind Snake, Rattle 'n' Roll and Solar Jetman.

Remember, though, a lot of the arcade stuff is designed to run on fast PCs 286s or faster. All the games reviewed here were seen on a machine running at 26 MHz (ie very fast indeed) and 13 MHz (quite speedy), and an Amstrad 2086 running at 8 MHz (not terribly quick). 4D SPORTS DRIVING MINDSCAPE .99 Drive 11 fast cars around tracks of your own design comprised of such hazards as loop-the-loops, slaloms, pipes, jumps, forks and elevated sections. If you're playing on a fast PC this sim provides a really great feeling of driv. ing, and makes the original PC Hard Drivin' look pretty weedy. Sub-12 MHz machines make it look less impressive, though, even with the scenery switched off. OVERALL 84% STELLAR 7 DYNAMIX .99 OIL'S WELL Another revived oldie this time a souped-up game of Battle Zone with lovely SIERRA .99 3D graphics (if you've got VGA) and plenty of enemy robot ships to take apart. A worthy purchase for 286-owning blast fans. Originally an Atari 8 bit game many years ago, this has been spruced up with OVERAIT 256 colour graphics. You have to guide your pipe through a maze of passages to grab oil pellets, while avoiding mutant insects. It's a very simple game, and not a particularly thrilling one even with 256 colour graphics. ALPHA WAVES OVERALL 65% INFOGRAMES .99 An abstract 3D platform game, in which you guide a bouncing thing through mazes of rooms, collecting crystals. Infogrames claim that the frequency of the sounds emitted by the PC sooth the troubled mind, but your reviewer turned out to be immune to such brainwashing. Original, and absorbing for a while, but it's a bit too frustrating to keep you happy for long. OVERALL 70% 86% ELVIRA ACCOLADE .99 Help the buxom horror hostess regain control of her ancestral castle in this rather gory graphic adventure by Horrorsoft. The command system is easy to use, the plot and puzzles are engaging and the game is made even more entertaining by all the graphic and sound effects. Be warned, though even the unshockable C+VG staff found some of the graphics a little disgusting. Detinitely worth buying if that and the price tag) isn't a problem, though. OVERALL 84% LINKS US GOLD/ACCESS TBA From the people who brought you Leaderboard, this 3D golf sim sculpts shaded hillocks and bunkers on the fairway in 256 colour VGA graphics. The cliff-top scenery is stunningly realistic and the speaker even reproduces sampled birdsong to make the experience complete. The fly in the ointment is the fact that each shot takes several seconds to 'sculpt', making it very much a game for patient people. Golf groupies will love it, but PGA Tour Golf, though not as pretty, is more instantly playable. OVERALL 80% S.T.U.N. RUNNER DOMARK .99 Take your STUN ship across futuristic highways at 900 mph in this conversion of the Atari coin-op. Unfortunately, this version is exactly the same as the Amiga version reviewed last month and is neither faster nor more playable, even when running on a superfast 386.

"BYTESIZE COMING SOON! PRICE COMING SOON! GAME COMPANY PARASOL STARS TAITO HELLFIRE TOAPLAN SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS TAITO .00 .00 PC ENGINE .00 A mixed bag for PC Engineers this month, with two Sega coin-op conversions, something for grapple fans, and even blasting freaks get a look in, too! TOY SHOP BOYS HUDSON .00 Vertically scrolling blasting action, as you guide three flying lads over Toy. land. It's yer usual shoot 'em up action (ie power-ups and end of level guardians), but it scores originality points for the ability to move the heroes around in their formation, thus selecting a weapon. Not bad, but not completely outstanding OVERALL 70% NEC OUT RUN .00 The classic Sega coin-op blazes onto the PC Engine after what seems an eternity of waiting, and although the graphics and sound are okay, and the game itself is fast, it doesn't take long to finish the game. Also, watch out for the shakey graphics if you have a ropeyvision PAL Engine. For fans of the genre only OVERALL 70% ST DRAGON AICOM .00 Bio-mechanoid blasting in abundance with this conversion of the so-so Jaleco coin-op. The main problem here is the level of difficulty it's too damned hard! Experienced arcade blasters may glean some pleasure from this, but novice gamesters will soon become frustrated. Try it out before you part with the notes OVERALL 77% START CHAMPION WRESTLING TAITO .00 Wrestling games seem to be something of a trend at the moment, but Champion Wrestling is something of a let-down. The graphics are pretty poor, and the control system is a trifle confusing, making this a heck of a hard game to get to grips with. Unless you're wrestlemania-mad, leave this alone. OVERALL 44% ESTA THUNDERBLADE NEC .00 Another Sega coin-op conversion, with you at the controls of a super chopper, pitted against enemy tanks and aircraft. The arcade game was no great shakes, and this conversion suffers further with jerky graphics and yukky sound. Very disappointing OVERALL 46% CYBER COMBAT POLICE FACE .00 Shades of E-SWAT here, with a lone police officer up against various bad guys in order to save the day. The graphics and sound are reasonable, but with only one life to play with, this makes the game extremely tough going. If you're desperate for E-SWAT on the Engine, have a look, but don't expect too much. 67% OVERALL 077 "

GAME DATE CYBER SHINOBI SEGA LEADERBOARD US GOLD HEROES OF THE LANCE US GOLD PACMANIA TECMAGIK POPULOUS TECMAGIK SHADOW OF THE BEAST TECMAGIK MASTER SYSTEM       TBA What do Michael Jackson, the World Cup and Dick Tracy have in common? They're all new Sega Master System games, that's what! Coming soon we've got a load of hot-looking conversions from TecMagik and US Gold check out the Previews section for full details and pics. MOONWALKER SEGA .99 AAOWI Wacko Jacko's back to save the kids of the world, in this conversion of the Megadrive game reviewed in issue 108. This looks a lot like the enjoyable Megadrive game, but the music (which was that version's best fea. ture) isn't as good, and without that the rather repetitive gameplay isn't enough to sustain your interest for long. Recommended only for novice gamesters. OVERALL 70% DICK TRACY GAIN GROUND SEGA .99 SEGA .99 Armed with a machine gun and his fists of justice, the eponymous 'tec fights This little known Sega coin-op conversion looks like a single screen version his way through 18 levels of horizontally.scrolling cityscape on the hunt for vil of Gauntlet but that's where the similarities end. As well as having duff lains. The graphics and sound are pretty basic, and the gameplay is just a graphics, Gain Ground is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Leave it tad confusing, due to the unresponsive controls. Not a chart-topper. on the shelf. OVERALL 64% OVERALL 32% EXIT STARIT DANAN JUNGLE FIGHTER SEGA .99 Swing through the jungle, and duff up a few Amazons in this rather dull platform caper. Jumping around collecting magical powers and doing over various nasties is fun for a while, but tedium soon sets in, and you'll find yourself getting rapidly bored. Have a look, but don't expect too much. OVERALL 54% WORLD CUP ITALIA '90 SEGA .99 It may be almost a year since the Final, but here's another World Cup footy game and quite frankly, it's a pretty poor effort, with some awful graphics and almost no playability whatsoever. If you're after a soccer game for the Master System, have a look at the brill World Soccer. OVERALL LIFE SCORSO 44% LUIZ 078 "

CRIME WAVE US GOLD/ACCESS .99 The president's daughter has been kidnapped (ooh, original), and it's up to you to get her back by any means, no matter how violent! To be honest, this is actually a NARC clone, but with added movie-like pieces. So if you're a fan of the NARC coin-op, and you don't mind the slightly slow pace of the action, take a look. OVERALL 85% OD 80051 OPERATION NEPTUNE ACTION 16 .99 The blurb says the game contains 'unbelievably realistic sub-aquatic combat\", but quite frankly, this is about as believable as an episode of Neighbours! Whilst only average in the audio-visual stakes, this is a really dull game, and even for a fiver it isn't a great purchase. OVERALL 56% STUN RUNNER DOMARK .99 STUN Runner on the Amiga was little short of a joke, and unfortunately, the ST version is even worsel Jerky vector graphics (which run slower than the Amiga gamel) and the complete lack of any feeling of speed or inertia make this a dire conversion indeed, and one not worth even picking up off the shelt. OVERALL 37% BLINKY'S SCARY SCHOOL ZEPPELIN 16 BIT .99 This cutesy platform romp puts you in the shoes(?) of Blinky, a ghost who is out to stop the threatening, ghostbusting activities of Laird McTavish. With its cutesy graphics, addictive gameplay and attractive price, this is a very good game indeed OVERALL 80% METAL MASTERS INFOGRAMES .99 Mechanoid mashing with a difference, as you play the pilot of a massive com bat machine, out to defeat myriad opponents, to make as much money as possible. Although the graphics are okay (even if the animation is a tad sus. pect), there's not enough here to make this something you'll play again and again. OVERALL 71% WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER ELITE .99 The Megadrive cart from which this is taken is not exactly the most exciting footy game ever, and even though this ST version is virtually identical, the confusing control method is enough to drive anyone up the wall. Soccer fans would still do well to go for the cheaper (and much better) Kick Off 2. OVERALL 56% 079 "

"REVIEW .95 ALL NINTENDO .95 BY NINTENDO/RARE The man with a gift for complete lunacy is back (and it's not Rob)! After a break of a few years, Jetman has returned with yet another scheme to get rich quick! His latest madcap caper involves collecting and recycling other people's interplanetary garbage (what an ecologically sound gent he is, eh?). However, on a visit to one particular solar system, Jetman comes across a piece of a once great solar warpship, wrought from purest gold! After a great deal of brain bending thought, Jetman realises that the other pieces of the warpship are dotted across the various planets in the solar system. If he could collect all the pieces of the ship and return it to its former glory, all his money worries would be over and he could retire a rich man! But being such a complete thickie, Jetman has no idea how to complete this monumentous taskand he needs your help! PLENTY OF THRUST HUNT FOR THE I Press the start button on your joypad and you'll immediately recognize Solar Jetman's resemblance to the ancient coin-op Gravitar. Gravity has an effect on Jetman's craft, and pulls him into the ground, so Jetman has to counter its effect by rotating his ship and thrusting. Garbage is dotted around the scrolling landscape and Jetman must collect it and return it to base. If he crashes his craft, he automatically ejects and has to re turn to base to collect a new mmmmm *** 00100D craft. COMMENT Solar Jetman is simply one of the best NES cartridges I've had the pleasure to play this year. The Thrust-type gameplay coupled with some great power-ups make this a really playable little game, but then what would you expect from Rare (creators of the original Speccy Jetman games)? On some planets, keeping control your craft is the hardest task it really is a challenge just to survive! With fabby graphics and super sound, Solar Jetman is a really cosmic cartridge that must be bought-pronto. RICHARD LEADBETTER "


"TREVIEW VH GLORY DAYS Solar Jetman is only the latest in the hopefully long line of Jetman games! Way back in the early eighties, Jetman became something of a cult hero amongst Spectrum owners when Ultimate Play the Game (the label for Rare's early games) released Jetpac which put Jetman in the spacecraft construction business. Lunar Jetman was the follow-up, and there was plenty more baddie-blasting on a Defender-style landscape, and Jetman could even jump into a moon buggy and blast away in safety. Will Rare produce a follow-up to Solar Jetman? Only time (and a future issue of CVG) will tell! COMMENT JE GLDEN WARPSHIP I've been a fan of the Jetman games ever since I bought Jetpac for my Spectrum all those years ago, and it's been great to watch the Rare team go from strength to strength since then. This Is a bit of a departure from the old Jetman style, but as far as gameplay goes, I found it far and away the most enjoyable game in the series, because there's just so much to it! The planets and cave systems within them are vast, and there's such a variety of bolt-on items to find and capture. I couldn't believe how big the second planet was the first time I reached it it's like a game in its own right! The sound and graphics are functional rather than outstanding, but the fast and smooth scrolling deserves a mention. This is another great game from Rare which simply must be played to be believed! PAUL 111 POWER-UP PRICES The level ends when Jetman gets back to his mothership with the Warpship segment. Then it's time to warp off to the Interstellar Shop, where he can purchase the likes of more efficient engines, titanium bullet-packs, time bombs and homing missiles to add to any useful garbage found on the planets.

"I REVIEW UPDATE An ST version is also being planned by the game's creators, Teque. Expect much the same game with slightly inferior sonics at the same price. Pse AMIGA .99 Revelation! Revelation S0000100 47 * a Develation is one of those puzzle games that seems incredibly simple, but is incredibly difficult to explain. Anyway, here goes. The screen displays the locking tumblers of a safe, and it's your job as an elite safe cracker to open the safe before the time limit expires. Actually manipulating the locking tumblers into opening the safe is quite a tricky process. The wheels on the screen have coloured dots arranged around the outside, and if one is turned so that, say a red dot is adjacent to another red dot on a neighbouring wheel, the second wheel will rotate one quarter turn. This in turn may cause another two colours to match up, so watch out for some massive chain reactions! To actually crack the safe, the tumblers have to be arranged so that the colours on them coincide with coloured locking arrows. When all the arrows are matched up with the corresponding colour the lock opens and you can spend whatever time is remaining opening the doors on a set of strongboxes. Some hold jewels which are worth bonus points, while others are completely empty and leave the prospective thief lootless. Revelation COMMENT $0000000 1 35 Krisalis deserve praise for trying to come up with a puzzle game which isn't just another Tetris clone, but when it comes down to it, I'd still rather play Tetris than Revelation. The idea is a good one, and it's very well presented graphically and sonically (the Matt Furniss soundtracks are very \"Countdown\" like). But the Rubik Cube-style interaction between different elements of the puzzle means that this lacks the hypnotic power of Tetris which comes from the player having to concentrate intently on one particular part of the screen. Without that, the game didn't really grab me enough to make me want to think about the strategy and I just played by fiddling with the tumblers semi-randomly until the safe opened. Real puzzle freaks (le Rubik fans) should love Revelation, but it required a bit too much abstract brainwork for my taste PAUL GLANCEY  GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY LASTABILITY OVERALL 80 "


"Ses REVIEW NINTENDO .95 BY NINTENDO attle and Roll are two snakes not your ordinary variety, however, these two live in a strange world of chequerboard landscapes, seas, waterfalls, stereo speakers, and, of all things, manholes! Their fate in life is to get from level to level by eating enough Nibbly Pibblys small creatures that infest the landscapes to become heavy enough to ring a bell at the top of a weighing machine, which in turn will open a door to the next level. There are a fair few nasties out to put paid to our reptilian heroes' schemes flapping loo seats (remember Manic Miner?), big stomping feet, a big shark, and the constant threat of falling off the landscape into oblivion! SNAKES IN THE GRASS Rattle and Roll aren't defenceless against the bad guys by flicking their tongues out, any nastie can be blasted into next week. But when things get really nasty, tokens can be collected to increase their speed or the length of their tongues! But watch out for the icon which reverses the snake controls! COMMENT Rare (previously known as Ultimate Play the Game) have proved that you don't need 16 bit power to produce a game which is so brilliant, it'll have you hooked from the word go! Graphically superb, Snake Rattle and Roll is one of that \"rare\" (ho ho) breed of games an original title which is just so good, there aren't enough superlatives to describe it. The humour is very strong Indeed, and it makes a nice change to play a game which is plain fun. NES owners, go forth and get this now! ROBERT SWAN 086 "


"IREVIEW PS. TAKE TTLE ROLI COMMENT Like Rob, I reckon that Snake, Rattle and Roll is one of the finest Nintendo games I've ever seen. <D Superlative graphics, swingsome sound and extremely addictive one or two player action make this one fine release that Nintendo and Rare (again) should be extremely proud of. With playability that knocks the many Megadrive games into oblivion, Snake, Rattle and Roll is simply superlative in every respect.

"> REVIEW ES C64 .99 BY THALAMUS rand Opening Day at Camp Watadump is soon apU proaching, but there's a big problem the Stars and Stripes, the camp flag, has gone missing! Enter Maximus Mouse, the camp's resident rodent, who's bound to get the blame, unless he can find a replacement flag within 24 hours! To find the flag, Max has to construct a vehicle to take him through each of the four massive levels that make up Camp Watadump. This is done by collecting Acme crates to make up the vehicle's blueprint once the blueprint is complete, Max can go on to the next level! If Max doesn't succeed, he could find that he's going to be next on the camp barbecue... COMMENT HAVE A NICE DAY! Like Thalamus's other new release, Creatures, Summer Camp oozes a level of playability harking back to the olden days of C64 games. The graphics are cute to the max, and the sound is a treat to the ears, with a boppy, funkatronic tune that bounces away in the background. The game itself is a little frustrating, but is just so addictive, you find yourself playing again and again in spite of the rather tough difficulty level. If you're hankering after a brill platform game for the C64, check this out pronto. geny a TIMES ROBERT SWAN GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 82 LASTABILITY 85 OVERALL 85 ICON INSANITY Dotted around the camp are various icons that will aid Maximus in his quest: FRUIT: Replenishes firepower.

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE H MEGADRIVE .00 BY SEGA MAGICALI TURBO AM The kingdom has been rent asunder by an evil dictator, who has filled the fair and pleasant Arabian lands with the minions of darkness. It's a good thing that there's a hero around who armed with his turbo-powered magical hat (and a plentiful supply of Duracells to keep it going) has decided to rid the kingdom of the murderous minions. The action takes place over an eight-way scrolling platform environment, with our cute Arabian hero running around dispensing lethal justice to anything evillooking. The object of each level is simply to negotiate all the platform puzzles and reach the goal at the end of the level. Then it's on to the next stage where more of the same awaits only this time it's even harder! So there you go AAAAAAAAA CRYSTAL CLEAR DET COIN on On the weapons window, the hero's current inventory is displayed and it's here that the player can utilise any crystals that he's picked up. There are four varieties and each has a different effect, like making the screen go all wibbly (and killing all of the enemy sprites) for instance. Other pills and potions that the hat-wearing hero has collected can also be selected here for instant use. 35 55 JAN OEUVOS IND 299999 32: The COMMENT Is this Psycho Fox, or what? Apart from a graphical facelift, this is practically a Megadrive version of the classic Sega gamel Still, the playability of Magical Flying Hat Turbo Adventure makes it stand head and shoulders over the majority of banal Megadrive games that infest the office at the moment, although where does the \"Flying\" come into it? Any road up, with its great graphics, bonus games and huge levels, this game is highly recommended. Be warned though, as Rob will tell you, it's a tad frustrating at times. RICHARD LEADBETTER THANKS Thanks to ConsoleConcepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the cartridge used in this review. 092 "


"IREVIEW INE HAT DENTURE! TURBO HAT TRICK So what's so special about this hat thing that gives the game its rather unusual name? Erm, not a lot really except that it's so big inside, our hero can store all his goodies in there and make them readily available for use should the need arise. The Deluxe Magical Flying Turbo Hat also has a free cape attachment which slows down the wearer's fall, enabling our hero to cover yet more ground with a single leap! Pretty groovy, yes? COMMENT Frustrating!? That's an understatement, and no mistake! Magical Flying Hat Turbo Adventure (the winner of the 1991 Weird Game Title Comp) goes from dead easy to absolutely infuriating! Gripes aside, though, this is one of the best platform games available for the Megadrive, with big, colourful, cutesy graphics, and an addictive nature which grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. The latest crop of Megadrive shoot 'em ups isn't particularly inspiring so this is definitely one to go for. ROB SWAN STATUE SECRETS All of the extra pills, potions and crystals found in the game are collected by punching the heads of statues! But beware: sometimes this hooliganistic behavior results in nasty enemy sprites appearing instead of some nice goodies! MEGADRIVE GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 82 LASTABILITY 84 OVERALL 84 093 "

"ARC az takes a trip to the Amusement Trade ExUhibition at Olympia, and discovers that, amongst all the rehashes of old shoot 'em ups, there are one or two gems coming soon to an arcade near you... SIT IN THIS AND SWIVEL! A very interesting Sega machine revealed at the ATEI amusement show last month was R360, a coin-op which literally turns your world upside down. It's basically G-LOC with very big knobs on, and certainly gives you the ride of your life. When you climb into the machine a big safety bar comes down over your shoulders to lock you into the seat then it's time for action. As you play the game, the machine spins and turns through 360 degrees in all directions, so you're turned around and upside down in the most sickening manner. It's certainly great fun, but there are a couple of down-sides: first of all the machines costs over ,000 so don't expect many arcades to get one. And if they do, goes are likely to cost upwards of .00 a shot! Still, if you see it, play it! RADICAL ROAD-RACING The other Sega coin-op premiered at the ATEI show was Rad Mobile, a car racing game which gives you the opportunity to race other drivers over a variety tracks through different weather conditions. It's certainly technically superb, and has exceptionally realistic 3D, but it lacks original features and that addictive spark that makes most Sega race games great fun to play Push start button Free play free play 096 "


"ADE OREDITS BURGER TIME AGAIN A quick mention to Data East for bringing an ancient concept out of the store cupboard. Super Burger Time is a sequel to the ancient 1980 platform coin-op which had you rushing around the screen attempting to create giant hamburgers while avoiding the attentions of marauding mutant ingredients such as eggs, peppers and pickles! It's all jolly good fun and is certainly addictive for a while check it out if you want a nostalgic trip to the past. MAD DOG MCCREE The first laser disk arcade games appeared back in 1983 and wowed the arcade world with their live action and cartoon-quality images. However, early models suffered from ter rible unreliability (the sensitive laser disk equipment simply wasn't strong enough to take the punishment arcade machines get), and also there were gaps between scenes as the laser disk head moved from one part of the disk to another. However, Atari has revitalised the machinery, sped it all up and are pioneering the laser disk comeback! Mad Dog McCree sends you back in time to the wild west, where men were real men, and Indians were being mercilessly slaughtered. The idea is to shoot your way through town. The screen shows a variety of different scenes, and cowboys pop up from all sorts of unexpected angles. Some are bad guys. shoot those suckers dead. But some don't brandish any sort of weapon at all are should therefore be left alone. Basically the game is a test of reflexes and observation, requiring you to gun down the baddies and ignore the goodies. The picture quality of the real-life action is astonishing (l've got no choice but to give 100% to the graphics, because they're real and therefore can't be faulted), and there are no gaps dur. ing play. Sound is also excellent, because that's real tool Mad Dog McCree is great fun to play and is a refreshing change from the usual coin-op shooting fare. Let's hope more games of this type appear soon!

"PREVIEW BY RENEGADE The Bitmap Brothers are back, with this, their first release under the new Renegade label. Loosely based on Greek mythology (their words, not ours!), Gods puts you in the shoes of a bemuscled warrior, whose task it is to travel through myriad platformstrewn levels, collecting as much treasure as possible. Sounds easy, yes? Not when there's all manner of weird and wonderful nasties out to stop HROHIN AXE..... 750D Como you in your tracks, it isn't! Add to that all sorts of traps and puzzles that have to be overcome, and the stuff really hits the fan! The warrior has a fair few weapons of his own at his disposal, but all have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on your whereabouts. As you can see from the screenshots, the graphics are absolutely stunning (as is the norm with Bitmap games), and when Our Rob took a trip to the Bitmap offices in Wapping recently to have a look at how GODS was progressing, he was indeed mightily impressed. How will the finished product bear up under close scrutiny, we hear you ask? Well, you'll just have to check a future issue of CVG to find out, won't you? 0027165 S Om EFERLER JEEMENT noen347 1424 0001 COSTE 00000 VERSION AMIGA ST DATE TBA TBA PRICE .99 .99 -100 "


"HPREVIEW QUBINDO Se BY SYSTEM 3 Pa POWER USING 00000 After the rather disappointing 16 bit versions of Last Ninja 2 (which, System 3 are keen to point out, were written by Activision, not them), those Pinner chaps are ready to unleash the third in their Ninja series, once again pitting the Last Ninja, against five evil Shoguns and their forces in Tibet, Last Ninja 3 certainly looks similar in style to the last two adventures, but as you can see, the graphics are little short of stunning and so they should be, because Robin Levy, who produced the fancy C64 visuals for Thalamus' Armalyte is the man responsible! Because the C64 version is on cartridge, it promises to have a whole lot more in it than the previous two instalments more fighting, more weapons and whole lot more adventuring, Will it match up to the two previous corkers?
