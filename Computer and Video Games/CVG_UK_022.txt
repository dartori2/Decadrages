"LONG LIVE THE PET DEFENDING THE ATARI CRACKING THE CODE Dear Sir, I felt I must write and voice my disagreement with a number of points raised in your May issue. First, I disagree that the standard of Atari games published is particularly high. Secondly, Mr D. A.

Could you please tell me: Which manufacturers might be interested and how might they be best approached? What detail would be required? How can I best protect my interests? A. F. Hackett Cramlington, Northumberland. Editor's reply: The best way to locate a manufacturer distributor of games is to look through, say, C&VG and find who seems to be marketing the best range for your machine. Just write a letter and say what you have. Do not send anything. Outline the game and ask for details of any legal agreements they may use. Any reputable company has these things sewn up. Your interests could best be looked after by going to a lawyer, and let him have a look through any agreement. Say 10% of any sales, or some money up front and a lower royalty.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETIE PROGRAM COULDWIN YOU ,000! a cheque for ,000\" at the brand Put a special effort into your next program — it could be worth ,000. There's ,000 in good honest cash going to the winner of our August competition to find Britain's brightest programming talents. The prize comes from Calisto Software of Birmingham which is keen to expand the number of machines it covers and use homegrown programmers rather than ship in games from the US. Calisto's Mike Woodroffe believes it takes three months to write a good games program and that's what you've got. If you're starting from scratch, your program must be finished by October 16th. If you are going to polish up one of your previous efforts, then why not send it quickly and get started on another program. You can enter as many programs as you like as long as each comes with an entry form cut from the magazine and we'll have more forms in our September and October issues. But there's a chance for everyone to be a winner in this competition as Calisto will be giving out software contracts to the designers of games they want to market. So even if you don't end up ,000 richer straight away, you could still find the royalties rolling in if you become part of Calisto's team of software writers. You can enter on any popular microcomputer and all cassettes will be tested by Calisto's team of judges. If your offering is picked as the winner, you'll be presented with a cheque for ,000 at the brand new home computing show Brainwave '83 in the NEC Birmingham in the first week of November. To enter, simply fill in the form below and attach it to a cassette of the game. Make sure you fill in all the details about yourself and your game on the form. If the game instructions are not included on the cassette itself, then add them on a separate piece of paper but please ensure that your name and address are included on every part of your entry. Perhaps you are a keen programmer who has not yet turned his hand to games, then you can enter any kind of program and Calisto will test it out. The winner will be the reader who comes up with the best commercial program, and Calisto will also pay royalties on all copies sold. Remember all published entries will be given a software contract, possibly worth a lot of money. The judging time is limited so get your entry in as quickly as possible but be sure that your program is properly polished first, to give your self a good chance of coming away ,000 richer. The entries must be sent to: ,000 Program, Calisto Software, 119 John Bright Street, Birmingham VOTE FOR THE GOLD STICKS Do you have a favourite game that is worth its weight in gold? Or a software company you would like to reward for its high standards and prompt service? Here at C&VG, we decided that the best of British software houses deserved the chance to win some recognition after a hard and competitive year which has seen games programming standards rising fast. We are sponsoring five Golden Joystick Awards which we hope will become the UK Oscars of games programming This is your chance to nominate a company which has given good service or earn recognition for the game which has given the most pleasure in the last nine months (since November 1982). Our five categories are: Best Arcade-style Game, which goes to the cassette or cartridge which proves itself the most addictive and thrilling. Best Strategy Game, is the title bestowed on the finest cassette or cartridge to test the mind rather than the trigger finger -like a favourite adventure. Best Original Game Idea goes to a company which has come up with a game of a completely new type, unlike any board, arcade or computer game seen before.  Software House of the Year goes to the company which has earned the best reputation for quality games, good service and entertaining advertising. Please enter this program in the ,000 program competition Program name: Machine: ......... Model: Model: ..... Number of K needed to run it: ..........K Other equipment needed to run it: .... All entries will be the property of Calisto Software and the entrants will assign all rights, patents and privileges of their game to Calisto. No employees of Computer & Video Games, Calisto, or their relatives, will be eligible to enter the competition. All entries must be sent in with an original coupon from Computer & Video Games NOT A COPY. The judge's decision is final and no correspondence can be entered into.

Our Starweb game is now overbut we hope that all of our readers who took part enjoyed the experience. Here's a message from one of the people who joined in, Mark Woolrich, and a rundown of the final positions. Please accept the following nominations for the Golden Joystick 1 Awards. (BLOCK CAPITALS PLEASE) | 1) Best Arcade Type Game: By (Software house): 2) Best Strategy Game: By: ....... |3) Best Original Game: ..... \"Overall Starweb has been an excellent game, becoming at times a time consuming hobby whilst still retaining the ability to be played quickly and with little thought should you find yourself busy with other things. One of Starweb's best features is the interaction with \"red\" players, (rather than semi-predictable \"computer\" players), in whom you could find all the better and worse traits of human nature and who give the game a complexity impossible to get from the computer alone. However, the game was not without its frustrations, the main one being the fate of all things of a lettery nature that are foolishly allowed to fall into the hands of the Post Office. One thing though, that is a fault of the game is the obvious imbalance between character types. You can see at a glance from the score sheet the types that the game favours. Us poor Berserkers must be the result of a Xenophobic game designer, and as for the Merchants, their wealth presumably relies upon trust and goodwill both of which are notably lacking in a game where there's only one winner. In the Starweb rule book there is a hint that a handicapping system might be introduced, but when? Finally, although I'm full of ideas on how to conduct my next game of Starweb as a result of my experience, I'm afraid the cost is too much at  or more per game. However, I'd love to play Starweb again and again until I found a way for the poor underdog Berserker to come out on top. And after that I'd have a go at the Merchant type. Life's no fun without a struggle.\" Mark Woolrich, Formerly Gzinti Fleet Controller | By: | 4) Software House of the Year: 5) Game of the Year: By: ... Name: . | Address: UTION.

"TOP SECRET... Robert to all readers ... message begins... After a tough journey I've managed to get right into the C&VG office while remaining inconspicuous. With great difficulty I've erected a transmitter on the roof so that I can send my reports safely without them being intercepted. It was awful! There were bugs everywhere. But not any more. The office is now completely free of bugs and 1 shall stay here for as long as it takes to ensure that this reign of terror can never return. I'll be reporting monthly on any infiltration of the magazine's pages, and will keep you informed ... message ends. IG HUNTER All bugs have now been banished, never to return, and the computer room has been pronounced bug free. All that remains to complete the clean up is to expose those bugs which were in residence before I arrived ... ATARI — TEN COMMANDMENTS Firstly there was the Ten Commandments game for the Atari on page 54 of the June issue. Many of you were having problems with line 14093. I have now been assured by the author that this line is not necessary and may simply be deleted. ORIC SNAKES Although Snakes for the Oric on page 53 of June's issue was bug free when it left our reviewer, Mal Function appears to have crept in while the printer's back was turned The small squiggle in line 30 is supposed to be a quotation mark, and the one after line 150 is, as most of you realised, the start of line 160. Not content with interfering with the printing, Mal has also changed the keys which the instructions say are used to control the direction of the snake. Despite the printed instructions the snake is controlled as follows: 7 up, 6 down, 8 left and 5 right. You can alter line 130 to use any keys you wish; I preferred Q and A for up and down and C and V for left and right. If you wish to use the cursor keys as in the instructions, you will have to substitute the letter in quotes in line 130 to read CHR$(X) where X is 8, 9, 10 and 11 for left, right, down and up respectively Another tip for Oric owners comes to us courtesy of the Tangerine Users Group. If you intend to use a lot of string space in your program, you may find that the strings overwrite the character set in RAM. This can be cured by making the first line of your program HIMEM=#97FF VIC 20 GHOST TRAP Although the instructions say otherwise, use the Z and X keys to move left and right. If you'd rather use the cursor keys as printed, change lines 104 and 105 to IF X=31 and 23 respectively. TI 99/4a — SKI-ING Texas owners, I admit, have suffered badly at the hands of the bugs. Most recently there was the Ski-ing program, for which we sent out many hundreds of correction sheets with what we thought was the definitive version Well, it was ... almost! The screen positions for the gates are held in DATA statements as screen coordinates but they appear to be the wrong way round in their pairs. To correct this, alter the READ statements in lines 290 and 360. 290 should now read READ B,A,C and 360 should be READ BA. The program will then work. I know I've played it myself. SPECTRUM CANYON LANDER Another attack on our instructions came in Canyon Lander for the Spectrum in the May issue on page 68. Although the instructions say that control is through the I and O keys, it should read 1 and 0. This is controlled by the IN statement in line 110 and can be changed if you wish. The relevant IN locations are in the Spectrum manual. VIC-20 — PROTECTOR Not really a bug this, but it puzzled quite a few of you struggling with Protector for the Vic on page 48 in June. When run, the program appears to stop and do nothing; it is in fact waiting for you to start the game by pressing the fire button on the joystick. This is accomplished in line 90 and can be altered or removed if you wish. For the Sharp comes a conversion of Mad Max, published for the MZBOK in May 83. To allow the program to work with disc Basic the program should be altered as follows: Replace POKE 17828,0:GET A$ with USR(ST):A$=CHR$(PEEK(53247)) and install the machine code by adding these two lines: 6 LIMIT53239:ST=53240:FOR XT=0 TO 6: READ DA: POKE ST+XT,DA:NEXT 7 DATA 205,27,0,50,255,207,201 Also, says J. Leonard of Penzance, if the last variable on line 515 is changed to D$ then the right person will get the credit for the highest score. Final tip is for Vic owners trying to use a 16k expansion to play Logger from the April issue. It comes courtesy of Mike Davies from Dyfed, Wales. Before loading listing one, load the following program: 1 POKE 36869,PEEK(36869) OR 13 2 POKE 9216,0:POKE 9217,0:POKE 9218,0 3 FOR A=43 to 50:READ B: POKE A,B: NEXT 4 NEW: DATA 1,36,3,36,3,36,3,36 Then change listing one: Line 5 becomes POKE 36879,25 and 65 starts: FOR I=5120 TO 5631 ... Finally change all values in listing two between 7680 and 8185 by subtracting 3584, then change all values between 38400 and 38905 by subtracting 512 To complete the change, change CL in line 430 to read CL=33792. To return your computer to a 16K machine after playing the game type SYS 64824 and all will be normal. Finally, for those Sinclair owners who wondered why there were two Spectrum programs in July and no ZX81 programs, Zax's V is in fact for the ZX81 and not for the Spectrum. Crossed wires in our production department! HINTS AND TIPS As far as I know, the bugs are now extinct at least until next month. Remember, this is the page which you help to write. So if you have any suggestions about how a C&VG program could be improved please send it in. We would also like to know about any tips for micros in general. I'll pay  for any which are published. Tips for this month are for the Sharp and Vic-20. BY ROBERT SCHIFREEN Write to me at: Bug Hunter, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5JB COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 27 "

The aliens are driven to desperate and violent action as their home planet is gradually being dragged into a giant sun and will soon become a cosmic cinder. So will their people unless the alien warriors find a suitable new home. The alien and earth fleets are about to meet for the final conflict on the fringe of our galaxy. The future of earth rests on the outcome. The battle zone has been strewn with space mines and large asteroids are also in the area. Thus the scene is set for this two player space battle...

If two ships collide both will be destroyed. All ships are equipped with laser cannon. When a ship is hit by laser fire it will glow red and will receive a random damage factor. If the damage factor exceeds nine then the ship will be destroyed. . The movement of ships depends on the amount of damage they have suffered, as does their laser cannon energy Damage is not repairable during the game, but cannon energy may improve. Players take turns to control their fleets. Each ship flashes white when it is ready to be moved. Various inputs control the ships. Move ship=m. Move ship and fire at end of move = x. Put ship into hyperspace = h. Fire only = f. Turn only = t + course. Tarn and move t + course + m. Turn and fire = t + course + T. Course controls are 1 = up. 5 = down, 7 = left, 3 = right with 0, 2, 4 and 6 controlling diagonal movements. Key ENTER after input. As an example, to turn and fire using a ship that is on course \"3\" input \"t5f\". This will change the ship's course so it is facing downscreen and the laser cannon will fire.

As you search the outer dome, which has been badly damaged. You sense that you are being followed. After a quick radar scan you detect an alien being following you. As you are on a peace mission and unarmed, your only chance to escape is to build a force wall around the alien so that you can capture and question him. On the planet Weidoo the low gravity gives you great strength to move the portions of brick wall around. But you must watch out for your oxygen level, which is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

"FOX AND HOUND BY A. C. EDWARDS RUNS ON A DRAGON IN 32K It's a dog's life being a fox with hungry cubs to feed. You never know where the next meal is coming from. But it will most probably be a chicken from one of Farmer Brown's coops across the river! The trouble is that faithful Fido, the farmer's hound has his kennel between the chicken coops, and as soon as those birds give a squawk he'll be wide awake and twice as mean. But Fido, like most hounds, it not as bright as your average fox. So you can fool him by laying a false trail and hope to lose him for a while as you sneak up on the tasty chickens. This game has no less than 10 difficulty levels which you set by choosing the number of dens available to your fox in which he stashes the plunder. There are four options of \"hound visibility\" from always visible to always invisible. Full instructions are included in the listing. Variables U = your position in Screen memory. DG = hounds position in screen memory. SL = difficulty level BB = block graphic for dog if searching FF = block graphic for dog if following scent trail. HS = high score SC = your score N$ = high scorers name, DL = option chosen (determines BB and FF). A,X = loop counters. DM = dogs movement. MU = your movement.

Move your laser base and shoot down the swerving landers as they swarm down towards the planet's surface. The higher the lander is when you shoot it the more points you score. You lase energy each time you fire — but regain, it if you manage to hit a lander. If you run out of energy, crash into a lander, or let two alien Craft land you'll lose a life. The game ends when you lose all three lives, and you get an extra life at 2,000 points.

"The tortuous twists and turns of this 3D maze will intrigue even the most jaded Pacman player! You'll find yourself within the walls of a graphically stunning maze even more baffling than the one at Hampton Court. But before you start be warned there are monsters stalking the corridors and deadly pits which must be avoided at all costs during your quest for the way out. To help you get out there is a map located somewhere in the curious corridors. Once you have found that all you have to do is avoid the lurking monsters and find ladders to help you deal with the pits! An added attraction are the transporter rooms, located behind a set of sliding doors which you'll find dotted around the maze. These transporters will help take you to different parts of the maze but offer no real chance of escape! If you see a pair of ladders on your journey through the corridors, pick them up. You'll need them to cross the pits. If you fall into one of these holes in the maze floor the game ends. Ladders unfortunately cannot be transported so you'll have to drop them if you want to enter a transporter room. Monsters in the maze are extremely intelligent beings and will follow you the best tactic is to run away! If you suddenly vanish for no apparent reason a monster has leaped on you from behind! The map is the key to your freedom. It is represented by a black square and is located in one of the many corridors. If you find it pick it up using the fire button on your joystick and then press \"M\" on the keyboard. You will see a plan view of the maze and the all-important transmat beam which will take you to freedom. This is marked by a cross. The map also shows your position and the direction you are facing. You must use the information to work out the best route out of the maze. There are four skill levels if you manage to escape the first time round!

"OVERS BY PHILIP HINTON RUNS ON A TEXAS TI 99/4a IN 5K Watch out — there's a snake in the grass! And this one is after all those juicy windfalls from the fruit trees in your orchard. Take charge of this slippery customer as he wends his way around the rocks and trees, picking up tasty fruits on the way. There are four kinds to munch — apples, oranges, bananas and cherries. When one orchard is cleared of fruits your snake moves onto another more difficult screen. The rocks and trees in each orchard must be avoided. If the snake hits one he loses one of his ten lives. Around the edge of the orchard is a hedge which must be avoided. If the snake hits it the game is over.

"Introduction Spectrum-latest recommended retail prices. One thing's certain about the Sinclair world there's never a dull moment. Every month sees new software and new hardware, produced by Sinclair enthusiasts, or produced by Sinclair itself. The magazines do a fantastic job of keeping you up to date with the input of enthusiasts. We want to keep you in touch with Sinclair's own developments. Every month, there'll be a Sinclair Special in this magazine. Sometimes, inevitably, there won't be anything new to say we want to break away from the breathless announcements of hardware and software you just can't buy. But when something new is available, we want you to have accurate information -fast. You'll find it here. This month, we're giving you the latest information on the recommended retail prices of Sinclair equipment. They're our prices, and you may well find things cheaper (or dearer) in the shops. If they're cheaper-terrific! Snap them up. Note, however, that from us the ZX81 is down to .95. We're also announcing six superb new Sinclair cassettes for the Spectrum, and three more which make full use of the ZX81. There's an order form at the back of this Special. Next month... but there, next month is another story! Watch (as they say) this space. S.PH Nigel Searle.

"BY KEVIN LIDLEY RUNS ON A ZX81 E GLADIATOR IN 16K SPOR 1 REM SETEELLULES GOTO 800D Gladiators takes you back to those bloodstained days of ancient Rome when everyone's idea of a good time was to go and watch two men hack bits off each other! These days we're much more civilised about these things. We only do it on video screens! You can either fight it out against a computer controlled opponent or take on a friend in mortal combat. To move Gladiator 'K' use keys Z and X. To move Gladiator 'L' use keys N and M. The program works as listed but suffers from the speed limitations of ZX81 Basic. It can be speeded up slightly by moving the mass of LET statements to the end of the program. To do this, change line 2 to GOTO 7000 and add 7000 to all line numbers between 3 and 186. Then delete lines 3 to 186.      DLLATICITI   PPPP DI A001 AN 90 000     22EEEEEEEE DDDDDDDDDDCCN Om00wwwwww 000 + lllllllllllllllll Illustration: Jon Davis 64 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"SOFT TERS Cheques cashed and programs not delivered seems to be the biggest problem area in the home computer industry's reputation. The second of our Great Software Disaster columns wrote itself after a deluge of letters about disappointed youngsters who had waited months for a cassette which was still to arrive. We've printed a small cross section of the letters below and phoned up several software companies to find out why delays may occur, how long it is reasonable to wait before assuming that something has gone wrong and how to go about complaining. LOSTA SNATCHA average 50-100 tapes of each title in stock and this is put up to 3-500 on the biggest sellers. \"Occasionally when a manufacturer is having production problems, club members can wait as long as a week. But this is rare and the reason for using the club rather than going direct to the manufacturers is the fast reliable turn-around. \"Our policy on complaints of nondelivery, or the occasional bad loader, is to send it out again and ask the purchaser to send one tape back if two arrive.\" He added that Mr Gardiner need only write to the club or phone membership secretary Mrs King on Oxford 730275 and a new tape will be despatched. One afternoon in March, having saved up all my money to splash out on a program for my Vic-20, I wrote to Imagine Software requesting a Catcha Snatcha for .50. I waited for three days for it to come, the date by which their advert claimed I would have it. Living in London, I couldn't go to Liverpool to complain and I was at school whenever I might have been able to phone. Christopher Morgan, Chartton Place, London SWI Eugene Evans of Imagine came back positively on this one. \"As of now there are no delays. And we do have a complaints procedure for dealing with customers who are suffering from postal delays. \"Part of the problem in the past was that magazines need copy for adverts a long time before the issues actually come out. We would book the advert at the same time we started work on the game so we could have it ready at the same time the magazine hit the streets. But to do this, meant there could not be the slightest delay in production. \"Now there are no problems in timing as we have all our latest titles in stock before we launch them. Our claim of 48 hour delivery time is definitely now in action.\" On Imagine's behalf, I would like to add, Christopher, that C&VG phoned their offices at 5.45pm, so don't be afraid to phone when you come home from school. No black marks against Quicksilva's mail-order department so we decided to ask how they keep their customers happy. Mark Tilson of Quicksilva's production department explained: \"We aim to turn around a cassette in seven days between receiving the order and the game actually landing on the customer's mat. \"We do have our problems though and, like most software houses, we are in the hands of the tape duplicating companies and sometimes hold-ups do occur. The reason being that when stocks run down we order new copies, say 5,000 tapes, and we occasionally have to wait a long time — in extreme cases as long as a month.\" Legally mail-order customers are not on secure ground. The Office of Fair Trading spokeswoman, Lindsay Keith said: \"The biggest problem with mail order is that people are asked to pay in advance. The company can go bust. They may not send off your goods or they may send faulty goods. \"The Advertising Standards Authority lays down 28 days for delivery of mail order goods but it helps to know as much about the company you're dealing with as possible before ordering from them. \"There is nothing to stop a company from cashing a cheque as soon as it arrives even if the goods have been held up.\" but as of late May, the tape had still not arrived. Would you please investigate and let me know why the tape has not been sent. A. R. Gardiner, Bishopbriggs, Glasgow. John Durrant of Microcomputer Software Club replies: \"We usually promise a 24 hour turn-around on receiving an order. The club keeps an ANGRY ADVENTURER For seven months now I have been waiting for five games from C.P.S. Limited which were advertised as follows: The Fourth Kind, The Doomed City, Wizard of Shan, The Ghost of Radun and Convoy I sent for these on November 9th 1982 and included a cheque for .50 and after repeated 'phone calls and numerous letters, I still have not received the games, or any money back. I understand that C.P.S. now call themselves Chameleon Computer Games. D. K. Ditchburn, Nunthorpe, Middlesbrough Let us put you right on one point Mr Ditchburn, Chameleon Computer Games are not the same company as C.P.S. Chameleon did have an agreement to market three C.P.S. games, but have since withdrawn that agreement and impounded royalties to C.P.S.

This issue sees four games listings for the Atari, Spectrum, Sharp and Vic-20. Next issue we've commissioned another four for different machines. Each is a special arcade game which will test your co-ordination to the limit. But if you're under 16 and think you can take on all-comers at the game and end up with a top score, then we want to hear from you. Put up the highest score you can on the machine and get one of your parents or a teacher at school to witness the score and fill in the form on page 82. Score duly recorded and signed by your willing witness send it into us at C&VG before September 16th. The top three on each game will be invited to a final to further test their skills, at the Brainwave Computer Exhibition in November. GULBIS "

No, not yet another bunch of pretty musicians. This Popper aims to become number one in the balloon bursting charts! And all you need is a silly hat with a sharp pointed spike on top. What, you haven't got one! Oh well, never mind the Atari mad hatter will supply you with one as soon as you've keyed in this game. The idea is to manoeuvre your little man with the spiked hat around at the bottom of the screen, placing him under balloons which drift down from the sky above him. If you miss and a balloon hits the ground you lose one of your three lives. But you can save yourself by booting the balloon back into the sky with a well aimed kick. As long as the balloon is below head height and the little man is near enough then he'll be able to save a life. Some balloons are tricky and turn into skull and crossbones before reaching the ground these must be avoided at all costs. To get beyond the first screen you must burst 12 balloons. The second tests you with 14 balloons, the third 16 and so on. The balloons drop faster on each subsequent screen and more of them drop diagonally instead of vertically. You score for each balloon popped and a bonus is given when you complete a screen. You can freeze the action at any time by pressing any key. Program Notes: Line 180. The string assignments are to \"CONTROL COMMA\" (the heart shape). The printer prints this as a space. Line 210. Any mixture of inverse, upper and lower case will do in the title, just to make it attractive. Line 383. As line 180. Line 435. As line 180. Line 550. The word \"START\" is in inverse. Line 576. As line 180. To make it easier to kick a balloon, alter line 400 so that the tests on \"P\" are greater than 4. To make it easier to pop a balloon, alter line 372 so that the tests on \"P\" are greater than 2. Hints on Play: After popping a ballon, immediately return to the centre of the screen. This is critical on the higher levels of play. It is safe to pass through the skull and crossbones once it has missed your head; but don't kick it. Don't panic trying to get exactly lined up. It is often easier to accept that you are off centre for the baloon, and wait and kick it up again, than to keep pulling on the stick trying to move just that little bit. 74 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES GULBIS "

This time they have journeyed far out into the vastness of space, to the planet Pippo just left a bit from the Cleethorpes Nebula! Here they have discovered the miraculous Towers of Twonko, one of the nine wonders of the universe, rivalling the Scones of Craddock, and even the awesome Grimace of Blackburn! For those of you who have never heard the tale of the creator of the towers, one Twonko Higginbottom, here is his story ... Twonko Higginbottom was a freak. His parents were quite normal, all three of them. Their faces constantly wore scowls and hangdog expressions. A picture of perfect misery. But poor Twonko was born smiling. For the first time in the history of Pippo a Pippolian had smiled! There was only one law on Pippo, one which everyone has to conform to and that was \"Thou shall not be nice!\" So poor Twonko was banished to the land of the Gruntox, where Grooses sneer and Ratlings grouch. Twonko was really sad about all this. He sat beneath a tree and started to laugh. He could not cry. He chuckled and chortled, sniggered and snickered so loudly that he disturbed a native of these miserable lands. \"What's all this row?\" shouted an angry voice from above Twonko's head. \"It's me, Twonko Higginbottom,\" chuckled Twonko. \"Go away! Get lost! Scram! Hop it!\" said the angry voice, \"go away you beaming buffoon!\" The voice belonged to none other than Ralph the last of the Dithering Pigmies. \"No, I'm not going!\" smiled Twonko. And then it happened. Ralph the Dithering Pigmy reached up into the branches of the tree, plucked a fruit, and hurled it down. The rest, as they say, is history. The fruit was a lemon. The lemon tasted sour and nasty. Twonko pulled the most miserable face ever seen on Pippo. The Pipponians saw his RUNS ON AN UNEXPANDED VIC 20 BY PAUL JAY 76 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

When one of these keys is pressed a missile appears and moves across the screen for as long as the key is held down. When the key is released so is the bomb.

"CDVENTURE se je 23.0 BY KEITH CAMPBELL BEATING THE DEADLINES! The difficult part about writing this Adventure page is that I have to operate to a deadline. That is not a problem until a game begging a review \"sticks\" at an early stage, leaving much work to be done before my \"copy\" can be written. So there I am, typing away on my micro. I'm tired, it is late oh no — not another one of those difficult Adventures! Having just reviewed eight games for a recent supplement, I went to bed and forgot it. Of course, that was not the end of itI knew that sooner or later I would have to come back to it! So when a bank-holiday weekend came along, I booted up the system, and resigned myself for a long haul. STRANGER BEWARE... The rest of the screen is blank. I press a key, the disc starts to whirl in its drive, and I am suddenly on a desert highway near an abandoned gasoline station some way from a small desert town. Thus starts Xenos, the latest offering on disc from Tandy. After wandering around the gas station I decided that for now it would have to be considered a red-herring apart from the crowbar, and moseyed into town. Although comprising only six buildings, I found it surprisingly difficult to find my way around. Losing my bearings, I strolled up a side alley only to lose my way in the desert, nearly dying of thirst, and really dying of poison in some flesh wounds caused by something very strange and nasty out there. Reboot, and try again. This time I will not be beaten! Why is the gas station and town deserted? Is the jeep really a red-herring? If so, then the Jack-o-Matic 333 is a very elaborate hoax. What does the old prospector out in the desert know about a \"magnetic anomaly\"? Questions begin pouring through my mind, and I am away, oblivious to calls for meals, missing the TV program I had meant to watch.... aquarium and apparently leave them there, or am I possibly a strange being? Xenos is big, but does not appear limitless. Not a long term project likeZork, but one that you will go mad about until finally you have unfolded the riddle of Purgatory City! 'X' ADVENTURE ON TAPE.. Occasionally I describe a particular Adventure as different. That is not a suitable description for Xanadu Adventure which requires a BBC Model B computer to run, and takes you into a world of underground caverns, inhabited by dwarfs and monsters. These are dangerous creatures, and cannot be relied on to turn up in the same place in each game! Some of the situations are similar to those encountered in other games, but with a difference. With some hard thinking the Adventurer will progress gradually towards his goal, the depositing of all treasures in the treasure store. When this point is reached (says the blurb for I haven't reached that point!) \"something will happen\". On his travels the Adventurer will find objects not often encountered in Adventure games, the usefulness or otherwise HOW TO DEFEA MOST CUNNING That is the other trouble with writing this page. Occasionally I come across an Adventure so intriguing, that I am unable to stop, driven on by a craving for the solution to hell with the deadline! And Xenos is one of those few! When I have finished writing this I intend to blow up that safe if it takes me all night! (Wait a minute could the dynamite be for another purpose?) Xenos runs from disc only on TRS-80 Model 1/3 compatible machines. Requiring a rudimentary knowledge of the American language, if a command isn't recognised you will be very cleverly told what word might be missing. For instance, if you type \"UNLOCK DOOR\" the line may be altered to read: \"UNLOCK DOOR WITH what?\", the \"what\" flashing for a while, eventually clearing to let you add further words. An unknown verb will lead to the insertion of a flashing VERB? at the start of your input. The plot of Xenos is somewhat reminiscent of Ghost Town, in that everywhere is deserted. But similarity of setting and plot end there. The score is announced in percentage of mission fulfilled. The first 50% is not too hard to achieve, but the going begins to get rough from there on Are there many red-herrings in the game, or will things all fall into place? Is Screaming Foul-Up responsible for the fact that I can put my hands in the I received recently a letter from reader Alex Shipp, who has been beavering away writing an adventure for his Dragon-32. Upon completing it he found one major problem: how to stop his little brother pressing the BREAK key, then listing the whole program? \"As you can imagine,\" he wrote, \"some of the messages rather give the game away!\" Even worse, what was to stop him getting a listing before he even started to run the game? He assured me that his brother would be quite willing to adopt such underhand methods. This is a problem that besets every Adventure writer. If, of course, Alex's brother is as little as he sounds, then 88 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"NEVER FEAR, HELP IS AT HAND! Last month I reported that Richard Jones and Simon Clarke both had problems with Bedlam. Simon sent a tip to Richard, Richard was able to complete the game, and thus help Simon out with his problem. Because different people can bend their minds to differing problems, through these pages if we at C&VG don't know the answers, we can help you to help each other! For those similarly stuck in Bedlam, printed upside-down you will find how to get past the guard dog! Letters are still arriving with pleas of HELP! for Pyramid of Doom. To find out where to store the treasure, how to pass the rats, and how (most importantly!) to get past the iron statue again you will find the answers printed upside down to protect the innocent! Can anyone help Jonathan Evans of Blackburn find the treasure chest in the Tandy Pyramid maze? Please write if you know how to get to it! P. Coppins of Stanford-leHope is having trouble with tablets in Golden Voyage. He currently wants to throw them simultaneously into the fountain. He is sure he is on the right track unless you know different! of which is not obvious. Has the pentangle some secret sinister purpose? Will the soothing music of the dulcimer send a dwarf to sleep as well as the player? The game has over 100 locations, and the scrolling replies, often four lines or more of text, are not only amusing, they appear quickly, and have nearly the verbosity of a disc-based game. OK, it's an impressive game but unique? What I've not yet mentioned is that this game has a two player option. If that is selected the game takes on a whole new dimension. The players decide how many moves they will make each turn, and as the game proceeds, a blue message at the top of the screen indicates which player is in command. If one player arrives in the same location as the other, the reply will include \"There is another Adventurer here\". An object taken by one player cannot be taken by the other, except for purchases made in the shop. The two players start off as rivals, and if a fight develops the loser's objects drop to the ground, available for plundering by the winner! When playing as rivals it is recommended that only the player whose turn it is watches the screen. But wait there's more! By typing ALLY, an alliance is made, the top message on the screen now displays in white, and weapon power is aggregated against the monsters in a common struggle to obtain the treasures. Perhaps this is the best way to solve an Adventure in company no arguing about whose suggestion is the next command to be entered! And there is always someone else to blame if things go wrong! Unless, of course, when the goal is in sight, one player decides to rat on the agreement, type BREAK ALLIANCE, and rush home with all the goodies! I can only describe Xanadu as unique, at least at the time of writing! No doubt this will not remain the only one of its kind for very long! Xanadu Adventure is a fascinating game that I can thoroughly recommend at a price of .75 from Hopesoft of Newbury. MIND OVER MATTER I got it wrong again Dad! I know, and I despair! Empire of the Overmind players R. Gillman from Birmingham, and Steven Essery from both told me I don't need to drop other Orpington have objects to use the one of my choice. They tactfully explain that although might be carrying something, I am not necessarily HOLDING it. What I should do is to HOLD the object before trying to use it! So I reloaded Overmind, and sure enough, found I was told what I was holding separately from what I was carrying! A fine point-one I have not come across before in an Adventure! shall have to read the small more carefully next time! I take back all I said! Another slip like this and I stand to have my licence to Go North revoked! It all goes to show that even C&VG'S expert Adventurer is not infallable there's hope for all of you yet! Seriously, Keith Campbell is always interested in hearing from you the readers, even if it is a criticism AT EVEN THE NG DRAGON the easy answer is to give the BREAK key a good POKE where it will hurt most-1.e. disable it! Unfortunately, that won't prevent the program from being listed before the game has been run, and it won't be long, by the sound of it, before Alex's little brother catches on! However, I suspect that little brother is really only symbolic of all those low-down cunning and devious people whose main purpose in life is to find a way to prove that our excellent programs contain errors, have omitted the logic for an obscure command, or can otherwise be proved faulty. Let him look at the listing, and see whether, even with plain English staring him in the face he can untangle the program code to solve the game faster than trying the fair way! If he does, then he will have spoiled only his own enjoyment of the game. Even after using a reset button which when pressed prevents a program from listing or running, it is still possible to look at the English text. One has only to PRINT CHRS(PEEK(video ram)); successively from the command mode (see Adventure page in the first issue of C&VG). Cheating can only be made difficult by encoding the text, and include a decoding routine in the program, but at the cost of response time and memory. All this reminds me of my desperate attempts to solve Savage Island Part 1, by peeking RAM. (Yes even I am not above that sort of thing!) I gained some vocabulary, and saw some extremely surprising things that seemed quite out of character with the game I thought was playing.

"MACHINE CODE DEALING WITH LOGICAL VALUES So far in this series we have been looking at programming in terms of arithmetic and interpreting the Os and ls in the computer as having numerical values. However, there are instructions that allow us to treat the Os and is as having logical or Boolean values, with O meaning false and I meaning true. The simplest logical operations are: NOT: Invert a single bit, so 0 (false) becomes 1 (true), and vice versa. AND: Takes two bits and returns 1 (true) if both the bits are 1 (true) and returns 0 (false) otherwise metic symbols for multiplication and addition. The second set is more often used in electronics where this confusion is less likely Logical operations can be combined to build up expressions, for example ( P Q) meaning NOT and (P AND Q) or ( PO) ( QR) meaning (P AND Q) OR (Q AND R). The branch of mathematical logic called Boolean Algebra deals with methods of evaluating and simplifying expressions like these. The 6502, 6809 and 280 microprocessors all have instructions for AND, INCLUSIVE OR and EXCLUSIVE OR, which all work in a similar way. The 6502 opcode mnemonics are AND, ORA, and EOR, and can be used with immediate, absolute, zero page, indirect X, indirect Y, zero page X, absolute X, and absolute Y addressing modes. The 6809 opcode mnemonics are ANDA, ANDB, ORA, ORB, EORA, EORB, the A or B indicating the accumulator the instruction operates on. Like most 6809 instructions, these opcodes can be used with all meaningful addressing modes. The 280 opcode mnemonics are AND, OR, and XOR, and these can be used with 8-bit immediate data, a register A,B,C,D,E,H, or L, or an indirect memory reference (HL), (IX + displacement), (IY + displacement). The machine code instructions work on bytes, performing the logical operation simultaneously on the eight pairs of corresponding bits in the accumulator and the operand, and leaving the result in the accumulator. For example, if we have: ignore others or leave them unchanged. For example, suppose we are working with ASCII codes for letters of the alphabet and it does not matter whether we have upper case or lower case letters. The ASCII codes for upper case letters are the binary numbers from 01000001 to 01011010 (65 to 90 decimal) and the codes for lower case letters are the binary numbers from 0110001 to 01011010 (97 to 122 decimal). The difference between the code for an upper case letter and the code for the corresponding lower case letter is that the upper case letter has 0 in bit 5 while the lower case letter has l in bit 5. We can use the logical instructions to affect bit 5 only and leave the other seven bits unchanged. If we start with the ASCII code for a letter, AND with 11011111 will always leave an upper case letter, OR with 00100000 will always leave a lower case letter, and XOR with 00100000 will change an upper case letter to a lower case letter and vice-versa. LOOKING BEHIND THE MASK A bit pattem used with a logical instruction in this way is called a mask. We can work out the type of instruction and the mask we need in any particular case with the following relations, where B represents any bit value (0 or 1): INCLUSIVE OR (usually just OR): Takes two bits and returns I (true) if at least one of the bits is I (true) and returns 0 (false) if both the bits are 0 (false) EXCLUSIVE OR (usually abbreviated EOR or XOR): Takes two bits and returns 1 (true) if exactly one of the bits is 1 (true) and returns 0 (false) otherwise. NOT and AND reflect the use of these words in ordinary English. We have two types of OR because OR in ordinary English is ambiguous sometimes meaning INCLUSIVE OR and sometimes meaning EXCLUSIVE OR. 6502 LDA %00110011 AND %01010101 6809 LDA %00110011 ANDA %01010101 280 LD A,00110011B AND 01010101B In 6502 and 6809 assembly language a binary number is indicated by writing a % sign in front of it, and in 280 assembly language by writing a B after the number. The result will be to leave 00010001 binary in the accumulator.. Similarly, using OR instead of AND would leave 01110111 binary in the accumulator, and using EXCLUSIVE OR would leave 01100110 in the accumulator. These logical instructions are frequently used when we want to work with some of the bits in a byte and POSSIBILITY OF CONFUSION... There are symbolic forms for these operations, NOT being indicated by writing a bar above a symbol, so NOT P would be written as P, and two commonly used sets of symbols for AND, OR, XOR are V, V and ., +, + we write P Q for P AND Q, PVQ for P OR Q, PVQ for P XOR Q, or P.Q for P AND Q, P+Q for P OR O P + Q for P XOR Q. It is best to use the first set of symbols. With the second set there is a possibility of confusion with the arithBY TED BAL Bl=B B 0 = 0 B B 1 = 1 0 = B B B 1 = B 0 = B 90 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"MACHINE CODE In general, we use AND with a mask to set some bits to Owhile leaving others unchanged, OR with a mask to set some bits to l while leaving others unchanged, and XOR with a mask to complement some bits while leaving others unchanged. jums In the 6809, related instructions are COMA, COMB, COM, ANDCC, ORCC, CWAI. COMA and COMB complement the A and B accumulators respectively. COM can be used with direct, extended and indirect/indexed addressing modes, and complements the contents of the memory location specified by the operand. ANDCC, ORCC and CWAI can be used with immediate addressing only ANDCC ANDs the operand with the Condition Code register, leaving the result in the Condition Code register, ORCC ORs the operand with the CC register leaving the result in CC, CWAI ANDs the operand with the CC register, leaving the result in CC, and stops and waits for an interrupt. AN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION The 6502 has one other instruction related to these logical instructions BIT, which can be used with zero page and absolute addressing modes. BIT only effects the flags, bits 7 and 6 of the memory location specified in the operand going into the sign and overflow flags respectively, and the zero flag being set according to the result of an AND operation between the accumulator and the memory location (this AND does not affect the accumulator, only the zero flag). Related instructions on the 280 are CPL, and the BIT, SET, RES groups. CPL complements the contents of the accumulator, changing Os to ls and is to Os. BIT, SET and RES are used in the form BIT b, register; BIT b. (HL); BIT b, (IX+d): BIT b. (IY+d); and similarly for SET and RES, where b is the bit number, from 0 to 7 that the instruction works on. BIT puts the complement of the specified bit into the Z flag, setting the Z flag so it will reflect the value of the bit. SET sets the specified bit to 1, and RES resets the specified bit to 0. If you have any problems relating to Ted Ball's Machine Code articles, questions about machine code programming or assembly language, then please don't hesitate to drop us a line and we'll pass on your questions to our expert. Remember, the address to write to is Machine Code, c/o Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5JB. In the meantime if there is any aspect of machine code programming you feel needs more attention why not tell us. FLAGS WITH CLEAR VALUES ANDCC and ORCC are used to put specific values into the flags. For example, the Carry flag is bit 0 of the Condition Code register. So to set the carry to l we use the instruction ORCC #%00000001, and to clear the carry to 0 we use the instruction ANDCC #%11111110. The 6809 assembly language contains the mnemonics CLC (Clear Carry), SEC, (Set Carry), CLI (Clear Interrupt Mask), SEI (Set Interrupt Mask). CLV (Clear Overflow), SEV (Set Overflow). These are included to make 6809 source code compatible with 6800 source code. The instructions are assembled into the machine code for the corresponding ANDCC or ORCC indstructions.

The small tank can be plotted at column 5 of row 7, for example, by: CALL HCHAR(7,5,128) The Texas Instruments TI-99/4a has some highly individual features for graphics. The graphics commands that are provided by TI Basic, which is the version of Basic that is built into the computer, include CHAR, HCHAR, VCHAR and GCHAR These commands have the following purposes. CHAR permits a graphics character to be defined so that you can establish say, your own kind of Space Invader. With HCHAR and VCHAR characters can be placed on the screen, and GCHAR allows you to examine the screen. Although commands and facilities comparable to these are available on other machines, very few provide them in such a consistent and easily used form. In particular, the commands for COLUMN Fig 3. 140 NEXT(8)=5 150 ROW=7 160 COLUMN=5 170 CALL HCHAR(ROW, COLUMN, 128) 180 CALL, HCHAR(ROW, COLUMN, 32) 190 COLUMN-NEXT(COLUMN) 200 GOTO 170 The movement can be slowed down by introducing a delay into the loop, say, between lines 170 and 180.

The variable TEMP holds the code of the character to be replaced after the tank has passed. 170 CALL GCHAR(ROW, COLUMN TEMP) 180 CALL HCHAR(ROW, COLUMN 128) 190 CALL HCHAR(ROW, COLUMN, TEMP) 200 COLUMN=NEXT(COLUMN) 210 GOTO 170 Paths other than a straight line can be created by allowing the row position to change as well as the column position With SCREEN the colour of the screen can be established, while with COLOR the colours of the characters can be established independently. 04 The larger tank can be plotted with its top left part at column 8 of row 7 by: CALL HCHAR(7,8,129) CALL HCHAR(7,9,130) CALL HCHAR(8,8,131) CALL HCHAR(8,9,132) With the computer's commands it is particularly easy to create movement. For instance, to make the small tank cycle through the positions shown in figure 3 the following program segment will suffice. It works by blanking out the tank (with a space character code 32) just before it is plotted in the next position. 100 DIM NEXT(8) 110 NEXT (5)=6 120 NEXT(6)=7 130 NEXT(7)=8 O E FF 1F OC 7E A5 I Fig 1. placing characters on the screen and for examining the screen work in terms of the screen's row and column positions. Thus, they provide the same capability as POKE and PEEK do on other machines. Now, suppose that we want to create a graphics character such as the one shown in Figure 1 to use in a game. This character can be defined and assigned the code 128 by the command: LCHAR(128,\"040EFFIFOC7 EASTE\") Note that the characters are based on an 8X8 dot matrix, and that the string used to detine the character is just the row-by-row hexadecimal representation of the character when each dot that is \"on\" is represented by a 1 and each one that is \"off\" is represented by a 0. There is not too much scope for representing a tank (in case you didn't recognise it) in this way, and if you want to create a more realistic effort you can always use four characters to be plotted next to each other as shown in Figure 2. The four characters used here can be defined as characters by CALL CHAR(129, \"000103FF0707033F\") CALL CHAR(130, \"COE0F8FAFAF8 EOFA\") CALL CHAR(131, \"ED522D1F) CALL CHAR(132, \"76AB76F8\") Fig 2 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 93 "

"I AL tit ft The fourth World Computer Chess championship is due to be held at the annual meeting of the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) in New York from October 22nd-25th this year. It is difficult at this stage to see the reigning world champion, BELLE, failing to retain the championship it won three years ago at the last championship, at Linz in Austria. BELLE's opening book of 350,000 positions and ability to evaluate up to 150,000 positions per second are both huge advantages over all its foreseeable rivals. On the other hand, Kaissa the winner in 1974 and Chess 4.6, winner in 1977, also seemed favourites to retain the championship three years later, but failed to do so. Will the title change hands again? round 3 at Dallas was a remarkable one. It is interesting to note that Nuchess provides a link with the past glories of the \"Chess\" series, since one of its co-designers is David Slate, co-designer of the original version of \"Chess\", over a decade before. Here is the game between BELLE and Nuchess. STRANGE PLAY i i ti BAAAB a b c d e f g h If now 6. ..., NxR; 7. QxRch, K-K2; 8. B-N5ch wins so black continues 6. ...RKB1; 7. B-KNS, QxB: 8. QxQ, NxR; Now Black must try to extricate his knight. 9. N-B3, N-B3; 10. B-Q3, P-KR3, 11. QxP, R-KNI; 12. P-KN3, N-B7; 13. Q-R7 NxBch; 14. QxN, R-R1; 15. QN-Q2, R-R4; 16. O-O-O, NxP; 17. R-KI, P-Q3; and Black resigned WARNING FOR BELLE zitt 21 A good indicator for the world championship is the annual series of North American computer chess championships also sponsored by the ACM. The \"Chess\" series of programs by David Slate and Larry Atkin dominated the early years of this tournament with 7 wins in the first 8 years (1970-1977). From 1978 onwards, however, BELLE has been the dominant program, with wins in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1982, and second place in 1979 (behind Chess 4.9). The only program apart from BELLE and the various versions of \"Chess\" ever to win the North American championship was Ribbit, back in 1974. The \"Chess\" series no longer appears to take part in tournament play, leaving BELLE in an apparently supreme position Nevertheless, the manner of its victory in the 1982 championship in Dallas sounds a slight warning note for BELLE White BELLE v Black Nuchess 1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. P-QB3, N-KB3; 3. P-04, NxP; 4. PxP, B-B4; 5. Q-N4, NxBP; 6. QxNP Extremely strange play and a most unusual position after 6 moves — already the game seems to be won for white! a b c d e f g h After 18. NxN, PxN or 18.... RxN; 19. RxRch, PxR; White wins another piece by Q-N5ch. GOODBYE TO ALL THIS.. DRAW DANGER In the four-round tournament, the program won two games and drew two to finish in a four-way tie for first place with 3 out of 4. BELLE gained first place on tiebreaking, a deserved result since it had played each of the three others concerned, drawing with Cray Blitz and beating Nuchess and Chaos. The greatest danger to the strongest program in a short tournament is too many drawn games. In a four-round event, it may be impossible to recover from even one draw such a small number of rounds would not be seriously considered for a human event at any remotely comparable level. BELLE's victory over Nuchess in This is my final article in a series which began 21 months ago, in the first issue of Computer and Video Games, when I described Von Kempelen's Turk, an automatic chess player built over 200 years ago. In the series, I have tried to combine articles about tournament play with ones on detailed analysis of end games such as King and Rook against King and Knight or on topics such as retrograde analysis or finding forced checkmates. Computer chess is unusual in attracting two different kinds of followers, the tournament competitor and the academic researcher. It is notable that even BELLE incorporates very few ideas which were not in use 15 or more years ago. Its success is very largely due to its large speed advantage over its rivals. The Artificial Intelligence researcher would argue that its lack of any deep understanding of the positional themes of the game will prevent it ever advancing much beyond its current level. Others would claim that a further increase in speed of analysis is all that is required to improve performance and that this will apply indefinitely, as long as hardware speeds increase. Thus, a World Champion program is attainable as soon as fast enough hardware becomes available without any additional \"intelligence\". Which side is right? Only time will tell. BY MAX BRAMER "

Both programs run in extended basic only Best in the West Software Products 124 Waterloo Road Ashton, Preston PR2 1 EP Sheepwalk is one of the much publicised new titles from Virgin Games a spin-off from the Virgin record and publishing company. If this is the standard of their games then I would respectfully suggest that Mr Branson stick to records. At .95 it has got to be the rip-off of the year and a dead cert for our Great Software Disasters page. The idea of the game is to round up all the sheep which have strayed from their pen. You play the part of the sheep-dog although you could be forgiven for not realising this as the hound is nothing more than a tiny black speck on the scrren. The animal must also have a gammy leg as it moves with the speed of a farmyard ox rather than a scampering dog! Points are awarded according to the speed at which the sheep have been rounded up and the amount of crops saved from the rampaging flock in the vegetable patch The idea for the game is a good one though not entirely original. It falls down on its execution. Written in Basic it's just far too slow. I can't think of any other professional software house who would bring out a game of this type and at this price without first improving its graphics and then speeding it up with machine code. Perhaps this is the point. Do Virgin see themselves as a software house at all, or is this just another example of the gold-rush mentality which is killing the computer games business with poor quality products. The idea behind this approach to the business seems to be grab any program you can, and publish as quickly as possible to make a quick killing. Never mind the quality, just look at the full colour cassette inlay. You have probably gathered by now that I'm not going to rush out and hand over almost  for Sheepwalk. Despite this there is something good about the game which I think is worthy of mention. The author of the game is fully credited on the cassette inlay. We are given a picture of Gregory Trezise as well as a short biography. Software, like records and books, has to be thought of, programmed, and put forward for publishing by the author. The programmers therefore deserve our recognition for their efforts.

In fairness to Texas it is an old game and some of the newer ones are of a much higher standard. It's the buyers in the multiple electrical shops who really deserve the criticism for inducing people to buy these crummy old games. It is time they gave more thought to their software buying particularly for the Tl where there isn't a great deal to choose from. The idea of the game is to blast all the Morgs that are dotted around the screen. Each time you hit one it turns into a giant desert cactus. Using the buildings at the centre of the screen for shelter the best strategy is to dart in and out before the Morgs can get you. But don't block your escape routes from the township by blasting the morgs as they move across the roads out of town. You could end up trapped! As with many Tl games the useless joysticks are one of the main factors which spoil the fun. It's a game which requires quick hand-eye co-ordination and therefore extremely frustrating when your gun will not move as instructed. When you have cleared one screen a new day in Tombstone City begins. If you do venture beyond the walls of the town to take on the Morgs in the desert you may need to use the panic button-space bar which repositions you at random somewhere else on the screen. Not the best cartridge available for the TI and for my money Parsec and Chisolm Trail are much better games. Tombstone City is in the shops at around .

Four levels of shoot 'em up action await your intrepid laser base in this new cartridge game from Commodore for the Vic-20. The first wave is nothing more than a fleet of archaic Invaders — which you shoot at through an arc of protective force field. This protects both you and the aliens you have to find a gap to blast through! Once these have been dismissed you fight it out with a much tougher breed of laser spitting aliens who flap — birdlike all over the screen. Tough but not too tough. Far harder is the third wave which has the aliens spinning out of deep space 3D style. If you can get beyond this wave you are a better space pilot than me! If you can battle your way through to the fourth wave you get to take on the Gorf's on their home territory. This is the toughest test of all with fireballs to be dodged. Finally the flagship appears. You must penetrate the craft's neutronium hull if you are to destroy the power reactor. As an added incentive to work your way up through the ranks you are given a rank based on your performance at the end of each mission. Starting with Space Cadet the supreme challenge is to become a Space Avenger. Gorf is one of four new cartridges from Commodore in the shops now at  for the unexpanded Vic. Although it is a reasonable conversion of the arcade game you would get much better value for your money by investing in five different cassette based games which you could get for the same price.

Gorilla grabs girl and takes her to top of scaffolding. Gallant Italian carpenter comes to rescue. Gorilla attempts to thwart the rescue bid by showering our hero with barrels. Screen one is easily mastered and the skilled gamester will get to the top of the screen each time every time as a mere formality. Number two is a little tougher introducing fire balls and deadly custard pies sailing along a moving conveyor belt which is trying to take your little mans legs away from him before he can get up the ladders. For most of you though the real test is to be found on the third screen. The ladders are few and far between at this level so you will need to make precise runs and leaps in order to work your way up the platforms to the top of the screen. Also watch out for the falling dumb-bell which can land on your head just before you make the final heroic leap to the fourth screen. I did spot a bug on screen three very occasionally Mario will fall down dead for no apparent reason when he is on his way up the ladder in the centre platform. Other gripes were with the graphics which had a tendency to flicker and much of the on screen movement seemed shaky. Having said this it must also be said that killer Gorilla is the best version of Donkey Kong yet for a home computer. The game is available from Program Power of Leeds at .95. I played the game using the keyboard but it must be immeasurably improved with the addition of a joystick One other improvement could have been included in the program itself-a level selecter. After a great deal of practice it became tedious having to jump through the first and second screens just to get to the third screen which was as far as I managed to get.
