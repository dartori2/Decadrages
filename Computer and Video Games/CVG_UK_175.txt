"computer video games WE HEAR WHAT YOU SAY CVG exists in a seperate dimension inaccessible and therefore out of touch with what you really think, right? Bull Clackers! EDITOR PAUL DAVIES t must be his age, or maybe his mental age (not sure which) but Paul reached a crucial turning point in his life this month. There was every chance that he would leave CVG for good at one stage. Become a Museum curator or somesuch. But when it came to that crossroads, he just broke right down and swore that YES he would be playing video games for the rest of his natural life. Current Favourite Games: VF2. Fighting Vipers, RRR. Vampire Hunter (Night Warriors First of all I wish both to thank you and commend you on such an excellent magazine, one which have read without fail for the last 8 years. Your new look is both refreshing and informative. And extremely colourful. Chris Hill (alias), Cambridgeshire Have to write to compliment you on the absolutely excellent new format very impressive, love the new rating system (great concept makes much more sense) and the FreePlay section is brilliant. Make sure you give Resident Evil a High Five cause it bleed'in well deserves it! Keep up the excellent work without doubt the best games mag in the Universe! Joules xx (o do I have just bought May's edition of your mag and I must say I like the changes, especially the score system. I have read your mag since issue 1 yes I am drawing a pension! Steve Skinner, Bedfordshire DEP EDITOR TOM GUISE e're getting concerned about Tom's sideburns now. Yes, they have been ignored previously but as you can no doubt see this cannot be the situation any longer. Our offices are bad for static as a rule, and electricity conducted through Guise's facial hair has become a problem. We need your signatures on a petition to have them removed. Current Favourite Games: Fighting Vipers, VF2. Burning Road, Track n Field, Nights, SFA 1+2 Oh dear, oh dear. What have you done? Although I applaud the idea of an image change, why have you taken a step back? For a start your pages have become more cluttered, and dare I say it less informative. I see no need for all the bells and whistles. Why use up valuable space with hundreds of tiny screen-shots, coupled with pointless captions, when you could have more room for an in-depth analysis of the game? The new presentation does not focus the eye to any point of any page, it's just a mish-mash of coloured boxes. Take a leaf out of EDGE's book and see how to present a magazine. Now to the new scoring system. Yes, I agree percentages are an inaccurate and abused system. But marks out of five represent jumps of 20%. Why not use marks of ten (giving jumps of 10%) which, whilst informative, does not allow for the marginal few marks either way. I am not in any way criticising your coverage or knowledge of games. I just think you've got a bit over excited. One last point: the letters page is now practically useless, providing answers in an unoriginal YOB fashion. Sadly, CVG, you have just lost a loyal 4-year reader to EDGE. Ciao. It was nice reading you. Tom Hughes, Wallingford First of all I'd like to congratulate you on your new style magazine. It's colourful, funny, and packed with info. Gavin B, Scotland ART EDITOR TOM COX on't talk about games! That's work! We're HERE (usually the chippy). That's WORK.\" If you see Tom Cox in the street, whatever you do, don't mention v-i-d-e-o g-a-m-e-s. He'll rip your head off and play football with it! And don't ask him to eat chicken either. He don't eat chicken. Talk about heavy metal instead. He'll like that. I am writing to ask who the sad person was who invented the High Five ratings was, and also to say I will be cancelling my subscription unless you change it back to percentages. But I must thank you as you have finally got the right balance between PC reviews and PS/ Saturn reviews. I hope you're really sorry for the trouble you have caused, and are going to compensate every reader who has moaned at you. (A Saturn would be nice!!!) Lastly I would like to say the FreePlay magazine is a good idea.

There can be two possible reasons for this. Number One: Fighting games by design are ripe for the picking of untold secrets and player tips. Case in point: Tekken 2.

DESIGNER JAIME SMITH his is a second attempt at Jaime's biog. The first wasn't funny enough. In this version, Jaime wanders around Southend waving a rubber chicken about his head, crushing brazil nuts with his butt cheeks. He's also cultivated a large boil at the nape of his neck, and goes around saying \"Look a'dat. S'orrible innit\". Parp! Outstanding quality.

THE COLOUR GAMEBOY IS COMING! Yep, you read it correctly. THE Games Nintendo's exclusive distributor in the UK have released a press statement confirming that Super Mario RPG will not be released on PAL format. The reason for this bizarre move is currently unknown, although it may have something to do with the game's cre ators, Squaresoft, move to develop software for PlayStation. We can only speculate. The fact remains though, one of the hottest Super NES games we've ever seen, one that we've been covering intently since its Japanese release a few months back, won't be coming out over here. And to think we were complaining about it being called Koopa kapers over here... (MARIO 64 CALLS FOR HELP SUPERDDI MARTORPG MORE OLD TAT! Take it from us, these games were brilliant in their day. NEWS We now know why Nintendo were able to produce such an amazing-looking title as Super Mario 64 in such a short space of time. It's through the professional assistance of development tool providers, Nichimen Graphics Incorporated. Nichimen Inc pioneered the kind of models used in SM64, right down to the strange malleable state of Mario's face on the title screen where players can pinch Mario's nose and move it around, or tweak the peak of his plumbers cap. This month Nichimen's involvement went public, and has meant that the company is confirmed to be involved with a number of future projects. Their N. World suite of computer graphics products are being shipped to all authorized Nintendo 64 devlopers and licensees. Now everybody involved can cut development time by almost a thirdNichimen's tools are that important. ST As the retro-games onslaught continues (check out our increased size Computer Cabin this month!), yet more classic games are set to return. System 3 have announced that they're going to release PC CD-ROM and PlayStation versions of International Karate and The Last Ninja, with the latter including all the features of the complete Last Ninja series. Whether these updates will include 'perfect' original versions too, is unknown, but we hope IK's music makes it into the game intact. Both games are set for release early next year. SYSTEN 3 "


"computer Video games [ SONY EMBARRASSED AT PLAYSTATION EXPO ] ** AUTION EO AND WARP Warp are best known for their game «D no Shokutaku\" released by Acclaim in the west as D. Their new game EO comprises of 50% Computer Graphics sequences, and 50% pure action. In D that balance is weighed much heavier on the CG side of things, and was duly criticised because of it. Once again the central character is Laura Luis Warp consider her as an actress of sorts. The action takes place onboard a spaceship, and finds Laura trying to track down some unseen monster (the Enemy Zero) which has murdered her boyfriend. Like D, some of the scenes are quite gruesome in the introductory demo, heads are seen rolling across the floor! Unfortunately we don't have room to go into detail, so we'll have more for you next month. iss Sony Computer Entertainment suffered something of a humilation at the recent PlayStation Expo. It all followed after Kenji Eno, president of Japanese software house Warp, invited a select few to a private presentation of his company's game EO (Enemy Zero). After an incredible demonstration of this original CG adventure, the onscreen PlayStation logo slowly morphed into a Saturn logo! At this point Kenji Eno announced that his awesome project was in fact being planned for release exclusively on Saturn this summer. As for PlayStation, that version is now postponed for an undetermined period in Japan a tragedy considering the enormous popularity of Warp in that country. Reasons for this shock announcement were stated as being that SCE Japan place too many restrictions on Warp, with fixed numbers of games having to be delivered, and all marketing plans checked by SCE. The president also identified a feeling of mistrust between SCE and Warp, which is not an ideal climate in which to produce the best games for most developers their software is like their child. There is one glimmer of hope, however: apparently Sony's policies are different in Europe and the USA, and a confidante of Mr Eno hinted that EO would be available on both Saturn and PlayStation in those territories.

"computer video games NEWS O [ SEGA ] SATURN PRICE CUT FOR THE US, PLUS NIGHTS! TUS NEWS THE ENTIRE GAMING WORLD ANTICIPATES E3 he ACME (American Coin Machine Expo) report last month kicked off a continuing series of US reports, written exclusively for CVG by Slasher Quan. He's agreed to keep CVG readers informed about what's up and coming from the USA, and as E3 is one of the most important events in the world's videogaming calendar, this is his report. A Night Warriors is proving to American gamers how the Saturn is a cool piece of kit! Sega's biggest weapon in the US 32-bit war has to be, no not Sonic, but good ol dollar Signs. Sega is said to be dropping the price of Saturn to $149 effective the first day of E3 (it currently stands at $249). In Japan Saturn is already down to the equivalent of US $199. (According to reports the lower price has led to Sega gaining a SIGNIFICANT current-sales lead over Sony in Japan.) But Japan's lower price is for the new white Saturn, which has been somewhat streamlined and has lost minor components such as a LED light. Will the supposed $199 US price be for the current Saturn or the white Saturn? Time and an E3 press conference will tell. For you guys in the Kingdom, it's only natural to assume your price is on the way down too. And if you're curious about how Sega is faring in the States, before the holidays Sony was outselling Sega by anywhere from 2-5 to 1, but due to a major A A new $149 price-point is dearth of any new rumoured for the Saturn at E3! PS games other than Resident Evil and the popularity of a few key Saturn titles such as NightWarriors and Virtua Fighter 2, Sega has seemed to regain some lost ground in the past few months. 2100 E3 PREVIEW By Slasher Quan Just around the corner is the E3 show in Los Angeles May 16-18. This should be the biggest videogame convention in US gaming history, because not only will Sony and Sega unveil their second generation of software, Nintendo will roll out the Nintendo 64 in anticipation of the (alleged) September 30th release. Lets run down the biggest names and games that will grace the show floor. ................................. A Raxel vs Tokio in the arcade version of Fighting Vipers. US NEWS: E3 SPECIAL PREVIEW NINTENDO N64 PRESENTED TO WESTERN WORLD AT LAST! A Sonic Team's breathtaking Nights Sega's mindblowing flagship title for E3. Or is it...? SPINEL OSCHEID DO1000 POD Of course the majority of the Nintendo 64 line-up is no longer a secret, having been previewed at Shoshinkai last November. Difference is, they will all (allegedly, again) be playable instead of running on blurry videotape demos. Only a handful of previously unviewable games are rumoured to be at the show, such as Acclaims Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter, and a top-secret Como game from Virgin said to be entitled Stacker. But the biggest is the long-awaited Killer Instinct 64 (working title). According to sources, K164 will NOT be a straight AKI 2 for the SNES could be translation of the the 'surprise' of the show. KI 2 arcade game, but will include new features such as added characters and added moves. The backgrounds will all supposedly be in real-time 3D. Will the game fit in a 64 meg cartridge? Sources claim some unbelievable compression ratios, which would pack the hundreds-ofmegabytes-worth of animation all into the tiny 64 megabit (8 megabyte) allotted cart size. But my view is just that unbelievable. Though the court system might suppose the opposite, I am going to predict Nintendo guilty of exaggerating its animation compression routines until proven innocent. Then again, Nintendo has pulled some miracles out of its hat before. By the way, despite numerous rumours to the contrary, Nintendo continues to deny plans to bring Kl 2 to the Super NES, much Acclaim's Turok: The Dinosaur like the original Hunter is looking pretty cool! Kl1 conversion. On the software side, WOMEO SegaSonic will be a big weapon, with two new games rumoured on E3 display featuring the famous blue hog: a 3D adventure game for Saturn, and a traditional 2D Sonic 4 sequel for the Genesis. My ultimate dream is a 2D Sonic for Saturn, but alas, everyone seems to hate 32-bit 2D, damnit. Also on the way from Sega for Saturn are King of Fighters '95 (yes, including the data cartridge just like the J.import version), Fighting Vipers, and supposedly both Virtua Fighter Kids and Sonic The Fighters. With the Sega/SNK deal secure, Samurai Shodown 3 and Fatal Fury Real Bout should also 9999 be naturals. The Japanese 3D sensation Nights, featuring 3D textures which look far superior to Mario 64 judging by the initial screenshots, should also be on display. BRESS NEWS "


"computer video games SONY 1 CAPCOMIS IL CUBO O PLAYSTATION WELCOMES CRASH BANDICOOT RESIDENT EVIL 2 & STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2! As the initial aggressor in the price war, Sony is guaran teed to try and match any move Sega makes as closely as possible. In Japan, the comparison is this: a stripped down white Saturn for $199 with one controller and no game, vs. a dual-controller, free memory card (but also no game) PlayStation pack for $249. On the software side. Sony's biggee for the show will be Crash Bandicoot, a 3D game which supposedly packs the best graphic environment ever and features an all-new mascot character. Other games scheduled for PlayStation display at the big show include Wipeout 2, Demolition Derby 2, Motor Toon 2, Warhawk 2, Tenka, F1, Mickey Mania, and Jumping Flash 2. Capcom recently held a press conference in Japan to publicly announce a few key new consumer titles, including Breath of Fire 3, Mega Man 8, and Mega Man X4, all for PlayStation and Saturn. Also announced were plans for Bio Hazard 2 (a.k.a. Resident Evil 2) for PlayStation. No word yet on whether the original Bio Hazard will surface for Saturn, much less the sequel. Finally Capcom disclosed the existence of the mysteriously-entitled Super Street Fighter Zero (Alpha) for the Super Famicom (Super NES). In the US, Capcom is hard at work on the action/RPG Werewolf and run-and-gun title Major Damage (which owes some of its inspiration to Gunstar Heroes, a good sign). Both are slated for 3rd Quarter '96 releases in the US. SHIT COIBO 1500 rs Can it be true? Street Fighter Alpha on the Super NES? TOTHER VIPSI 311211 Lap: Pos: 2 of 2 Coin: 14 ml 154 NAMCO. SNK.

It's pretty funky by all accounts. Here's a quick rundown of the rest of the majors: Namco should be readying the US PS versions of Tekken 2 and Ridge Racer Revolution for fall releases, with Soul Edge before the end of the year...SNK is rumoured to be developing King of Fighters '95, Fatal Fury Real Bout, and Samurai Shodown 3 for PlayStation, but their already-actualized relationship with Sega might impact the PS versions... Konami should have 32-bit versions of Track & Field in Atlanta, Castlevania: The Bloodletting, and Speed King (a 360-degree rotational, motion sickness-inducing Japanese arcade racing game) on E3 display...Acclaim should muscle in with home versions of NBA Jam Extreme, its new arcade game featuring 3D texture-mapped polygons instead of the traditional digitised characters from original Jam... Williams will probably have early versions of both War Gods and NBA Hangtime, its own Jam follow up...and Interplay's got ReLoaded raring to go for PlayStation. Cant wait! Well things are pretty tight-lipped among the US companies but this is the buzz at the moment, we'll probably be in for some surprises at the E3. (Would life in videogames be any fun without them?)

"computer Video games NEWS O [ SLEGA ENTER. 7 SEGA ENTER ISLE OF MAN TT! SEGA TO USE MEMORY CARDS! Following the success of the AM3 arcade racing game, Sega have paid out a six-figure sponsorship deal to create their own motorcycle team with the intention of winning the Isle Of Man TT! Team Sega Suzuki will enter two GSXR-750T bikes capable of up to 170 mph in the race, complete with customised Sega liveries. By all accounts, the team stands an extremely good chance of winning, with lead rider Jim Moodie already a four times winner of the Isle Of Man TT. Better still, the second bike, ridden by New Zealand international, Shaun Harris, will look identical to the bike from the actual Manx TT coin-op! The Isle Of Man TT takes place between the 27th May and the 7th June. Sega will also be part-sponsoring two Team G-Shock Crescent Suzuki bikes in the British Superbike Championship, to be televised on BBC Grandstand until October 12/13. Sega Of Japan have announced they intend to use Toshiba miniature memory cards in their own products. Developed for use in items such as personal organisers and digital cameras, these extra-small cards measure in at 45mm by 37mm in size, and are only 0.7mm thick. What plans Sega have for the card has yet to be revealed. The most obvious suggestion would be as a back-up device for the Saturn, similar to the way the PlayStation memory cards operate. This could prove viable if, as has been suggested before, Sega produce an add-on to increase the Saturn's power for upcoming games such as Fighting Vipers. If the add-on were to plug into the current memory-cartridge port (as it logically would), a new slot would be needed for memory back-up. And the miniature memory card would prove practical and compact. On the other hand, perhaps it could be used in conjunction with a new hand-held system. More information as soon. [M2 DELAYED!] M2 DELAYI While UK Nintendo fans patiently await any news of an official N64 release date over here, 3DO owners have now been put on similar tenderhooks, with the news that the new M2 system is unlikely to arrive here until Autumn 1997. When Matsushita bought the M2 technology for $100 million in November, the machine was scheduled for launch in autumn of this year. Now though, it seems the system won't even appear in the US until spring next year. Matsushita claim that negotiations since the sale have taken so long, that software development has dropped behind schedule. As such, the machine is unlikely to be unveiled until E3 next year!. A broad-ranging selection of games are promised to accomapny the launch, as is the possibility of a new controller that's said to loosely resemble the N64 pad. STUDIO 3DO HEAD FOR THE PC One PIPPIN ARTMARK 3 DO With M2 seemingly put back for at least a year now, Studio 3DO the 3D0 Company's internal software development division has TM turned its attention to the PC market, announcing a range of games they're currently developing for the machine. Ten titles are promised for release this year, including original games and previous Studio 3D0 hits, customised for the PC. An all-new golf game featuring British Open champion John Daly is the first for release, with a ten-event Decathlon sports game scheduled for summer. More familiar Studio 3D0 titles Killing Time, BladeForce, Snow Job, Captain Quazar and Battle Sport are all to follow. Also set for release is the Game Guru Game Enhancer. A device similar to the Action Replay, it allows you to enter codes to mess around with all manner of games, including Dark Forces, Command & Conquer and Duke Nukem 3D. Game Guru Game Enhancer, what a name! MO UNIT EPIN ITMARK BY AF Ea77Released this month is the Apple Macintosh/ Bandai console the Pippin Artmark. It's being marketed as a powerful \"communicator\", as opposed to purely a games machine, and is priced accordingly at 64 000 Yen (approx ). Sales of modem and CD-Roms in Japan are increasing all the time, and to this end Pippins which are pre-ordered and then mailed to homes come packed with connection to an on-line service named Franky on-line. Plus, of course, there's all the Bandai games -le Gundam!!! SMN Bandai only expect to sell about 50 000 Pippins in 1996, and still make a profit. 13 "

MAT By the way, there's still a prize going for anyone who can invent a happier name than \"Mailbag\" for this section! CACK HANDED THIS GUY HATES SF ALPHA — AND HE'S BROUGHT HIS MATES! Dear CVG, I have got a few questions. Please answer them: 1. What game should I get next for my PS? | thought of Alien Trilogy, as I am a fan of all the films. What's your opinion? 2. I was looking at another mag in Smiths (UFG). I turned to the review on the great Guardian Heroes and saw 30%. Could this be a printing mistake? I think not, as the reviewer said: (a) It's too easy, (b) the graphics are like they have come off a C64, and (c) just don't buy it cos it's \"well, cack really\". How can this be? Can I sue them? 3. Should I sell my SNES to buy more games for my PlayStation? 4. Why is it that in Doom the guy punches with his left hand, and is shown to be reloading the shotgun with his left hand? This would mean he would be ambidextrous. Was the guy who invented Doom ambidextrous? Thanks, and keep it up. Philip Drakeley, Nantwich. Diddy Kong is on a roll, in the brilliant sequel to DKC. MEANWHILE BACK IN REALITY VOICE OF THE MASSES Dear CVG, Ever since Street Fighter 2 appeared on the market I have been playing it. And, as new versions appeared, my devotion for this game increased. I think no other fighting game can be compared with SF2's overwhelming fighting performance. Unfortunately this Christmas I found that a new version (Street Fighter Alpha] had been issued the ultimate version included a great variety of techniques. I felt this game was not only far from the SF series, but that it was one of the worst games I've ever played. Then I purchased your magazine and found that you glorified it, describing SFA as the ultimate fighting game. Now I would like to ask a question: Have you played it? Doesn't it look rather like a crap Japanese cartoon? If you compare SFA's graphics and animations with the legendary SF2 Als this serious? saga you become aware of certain features which distinguish all versions the graphics look like animated pictures. To finish I would like to say that was deeply deceived by what I read in CVG issue 172. Street Fighter Alpha definitely does not maintain the fluidity that characterised the legendary saga from the beginning, and should not be included as part of them. The following page shows how most of the boys in my class (all Sixth Form students) agree with me that this game is crap. Dani Franc, Barcelona TEAM: 1. Don't ever go after a game just because of a great film license you'll only get your fingers burned. However Trilogy is something of an amazing exception. 2. We rate games here, not the other mags' opinions. Anyway UFG is finished. 3. No way! Super Mario RPG is superb, and there's talk of Nintendo bringing one of the Dragon Quest games to the UK. Besides -excellent though it still is your SNES would probably only fetch around  second-hand. 4. We'll ask John Romero Dear CVG, I am writing to finally end the arguments about what's better the Saturn or the PlayStation. I own an Amiga 1200, and therefore I am not biased in any way. I have three mates: one who owns a Saturn, one a PS, and another a SNES. I've played various top-selling games for each sys. tem, and my favourite is clearly the SNES. Its games have a lot more lastability and it can still produce great graphics like Donkey Kong, Mario RPG, etc. From what I've seen, the Nintendo 64 will be light years ahead of the PS or Saturn. I nearly bought a lesser, 32-bit console but from what I can see Nintendo always come up tops. Perhaps patience always pays off. Just one last thing, are Sega making a 64-bit console? David Crooks, Buckinghamshire TIS 260 PAUL: All I can say is that, recently, the games I've been playing at home have mostly been Super NES RPGs. Admittedly the reason Final Fantasy III (VI) is back in the slot is due to the FFVII frenzy. But your last comment seems to indicate that David Crooks will die with a fence wedged between his butt cheeks. 002 TEAM: First you ask «have we played\" Street Fighter Alpha, then qualify your minority case by saying how you don't like the way the game looks. So, yes we have played the game Dani. We'd like to know, have you or your 35 mates for that matter? But sorry you feel so ripped off. Does anyone else feel the same way?

"DEATH TO FALSE METAL! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! computer video games BAG Dear CVG, I bought your magazine again for the first time in ages and I like what I see (but it is expensive). Doubtless I'll be getting the next one for those Dark Stalkers features you promise. Much more importantly, I noticed certain secret codewords scattered sparsley throughout issue 173. On page 7, in suitably Gothic font, you have the inscription \"Metal Warriors\". I shrugged this off, until I came to page 42, where we are treated to the exhortations to \"Kill With Power\", as well as \"Die! Die\". So, are you guys Manowar fans? If so, good. Keep it that way. Hail and kill.. Kola Krauze, London Dear CVG, I cannot believe the crap I've just read in the April issue by Ed Fletcher. You point out three good games that would help sell the Saturn, then Fletcher and his chums start fretting about biased opinions. Well Fletcher you're wrong when you say these three games won't sell the Saturn. I bought one just because of Rally, and have since bought VF2. I couldn't buy Virtua Cop because it had sold out. You say there are no good games coming out for the Saturn. What?! You don't think Panzer 2, Virtual On, Fighting Vipers, Manx TT, Ultimate MK3, Euro '96, Dark Saviour, and Virtua Cop 2 are going to be amazing? You then tell us these three games are following a trend. Well, Virtua Fighter started the 3D beat 'em up thing which has now been ripped off by Toshinden and Tekken. If you're so convinced about all the fab games you're going to be playing on your PS, what are you so upset about three games on another system for? Then you go on about NU64, and we'll just have to \"wait and wonder\" Eerr...what about??? I won't be buying one I'm having too much fun with my Saturn. Simon White, York RAH! RAH! NINTENDO! RAH! PAUL: You missed the quote at the bottom of page 6, Kola. Call yourself a fan! Dear CVG, Last month all your letters were about the PlayStation and the Saturn, but there's a new kid on the block and it squashes the competition into pulp (if you could call the PlayStation and Saturn competition). Yeah I'm talking about Nintendo's new dream machine the NU64. I'd like to see more letters on this instead of dumb idiots arguing about their crappy 32-bit heaps. They don't have the 64-bit power of Silicon Graphics with a unique 3D controller, offering a completely different gaming experience. So come on CVG: Nintendo's the future and will be for a long time, along with the M2. Why don't you say goodbye to all those impatient rivals with lots of money and no brains? David Vicary, Manchester TEAM: Yep. Next... Is Fighting Vipers crap? Is it chuff! VOICE OF THE MASSES * (0 how much bet PAUL: Okay, no more letters about how much better NU64 is than the 32bit systems until people can actually own one and have an opinion!

I just noticed that there aren't many games out for the Mega CD 32X. I don't mean Mega CD, or 32x. I mean games which are for both like Slam City. I just wondered whether you could write me a list of all the games out on it, or at least the ones I can get hold of. Matthew Reid, Andover Dear CVG, I'm so confused! I've given it some thought in buying a 3D0 as I have been with Amiga for five years (sad, eh). I'm also buying the M2 when it's released. But this is where I'm confused: I've heard Matsushita are buying the M2 technology, and Panasonic aren't getting the 64-bit dream. Then I heard that Matsushita is the owner of Panasonic, so Panasonic are getting M2. Could you tell me which is right because I don't know where to get a Matsushita 3DO. David Kerrick, Leeds TOM: Sega were originally going to release new Mega-CD games that, when used through a Mega Drive 32x, were enhanced by the hardware most notably with improved FMV. But in the end they never released them, so there aren't any official Mega-CD 32X games. Sorry. CVG: Matsushita Electrical Industry (MEI) is Panasonic's parent company. Basically MEI is ENORMOUS, and many famous names associated with Consumer Electronics are divisions of that organisa tion. Seriously, MEI is involved with everything from JVC video recorders to National AA batteries! (VG Studio 3DO's Doomstyle demo for M2. Game art for Slam City one of the very few Mega CD 32X titles. CVER 2 1/2 HOS OF SELMOON VIDEO Dear CVG, I own a PlayStation, Saturn, 3DO, Jaguar, 32x, Sega CD, NES, SNES, Game Boy and Game Gear. Soon I will own Nintendo 64 and M2. I found your magazine (3 issues so far) by accident and I am VERY IMPRESSED. Since I own these systems I look for magazines that are fair to ALL of them. In America I subscribe to 8 zines, and sometimes I pick up another five more. Out of all the magazines I get, your zine is definitely #1 (next to Game Players). I've checked out other zines from Europe and I haven't seen anything as good as yours. Anyone who thinks your zine is biased is wrong! I read many zines that ARE biased, so I should know! I'm always disappointed by those zines because how can you make a decision if you don't have all the information (or the right information). I am a PlayStation owner!! I know your magazine is not biased!! Some people are just upset that Virtua Fighter 2 is the best in America, Japan, and Europe. I AM a Tekken and Toshinden FANatic (Toshinden is pretty shallow, but I love the look of it!) I have had Tekken 2 and Toshinden 2 on reservation BEFORE they were even in the arcade. I love those games just as much as I love VF2, but VF2 is a MUCH BETTER GAME! I know from the American zines about bad ratings. EVERY ZINE has bad ratings!!! Even the ones I love the most. I would agree that Daytona was scored high (JUST LIKE ALL THE AMERICAN ZINES IT DESERVED IT!!!) but if people are not going to buy a game unless it has a 90% rating or higher, then you had to give it at least 90%. It is an awesome game with great handling! If you took points away for flaws, Tekken would have been down a few LOVE THAT FLICKER AND BREAK UP!!! Not one American zine mentioned the flaws in Tekken or Toshinden. But they mentioned the flaws in Virtua Fighter. I hope the rating situation in all zines (ESPECIALLY America) gets fixed. But I doubt it will. In America it won't happen because the reviewers THINK they know it all (they don't). Trashing other systems or games is pointless!! It doesn't stop people from buying or playing them. The frustration isn't worth it and the arguments never end!!! We can come up with more constructive thoughts that could help gamers, magazines, and even game companies!!! Please do not let others decide how you should do your zine. From what I've been reading, you guys KNOW the business! You're doing it right and biased people should not be allowed to interfere with the FAIREST, MOST RESPONSIBLE MAGAZINE I've ever read!!! SCREW THEM!!! Harold H Thomas, Boston, MA PEDRO WINS VOICE OF THE MASSES WITH SCOTTIE PIPPEN HELLO I'M DEAD STUPID Dear CVG, Hey you guys! This is the third version of my letter, because every time I finished one I noticed another April Fool in your magazine. I think you've got a system of three grades of difficulty going: Novice = Mortal Kombat, Advanced = Ridge Racer Revolution, and Proffessional = Vercom. I suppose dozens of halfwits and even retailers are trying to get hold of this link-up' machine. And Pedro who would be gullible enough to believe such a character exists especially with that dodgy moustache. And play Buggy Mode in RRR? Actually that looks like fun. Even though us sensibly-minded punters will regard April issues of CVG with a pinch of salt, the last one was of excellent quality the Alpha coverage was superior (lots of Japanese SF artwork always gets me going).

And there's only a few weeks to wait until you can experience Nintendo's 64-bit wonder Mirror, mirror tell me I'm better than Sonic! ook at these screen-shots! Bet you're already considering that bank lloan! Yes, it's approaching that point in video game history, folks June 23rd: the launch of Nintendo 64 in Japan. Fans poised for their import machines (if any make it out of Japan) can expect to go broke in one fell swoop. Quite simply the N64 and SM64 are set to become THE essential gaming partners this summer, and we expect that thousands of you are willing to trade socialising and the bank account for the privelege. They say the sun is bad for your skin anyway, right! SUPER MARIO OT MESSING WITH YOUR HEAD Nintendo 648 Super Mario 64 A power meter indicates that this barrel is a BOSS! Don't know how Mario defeats him though! Yes, Mario does have Super Powers after all! Check out the wings on the side of his hat. When Super Mario 64 was first shown to the world, players in Japan discovered how it controlled for themselves. As CVG had a man over there at that time, we could report back and explain exactly what you were looking at on the page. This time Nintendo are being deliberatley tantalising. The two fistfuls of screen-shots supplied to the press, shown here, came supplied with minimum info. So what we are left with is essentially a bunch of extremely exciting images, and our imagination! But while nobody is any the wiser as to the structure of the game, there is now rumoured to be around 60 Worlds which require storage space in excess of 90 Meg as opposed to the 64 Meg Nintendo originially planned! Bowser's aquarium, we think. Don't be surprised if Mario is allowed to swim around in there! This pic demonstrates how Mario can use his arms to clamber up or down. That's a long fall! COMING SOON DEPARTURES OXO X As expected, Super Mario 64 has evolved into an exploration-oriented game. Nintendo are obviously keen to accentuate the N64's superior 3D processing power first and foremost, so the situations Mario finds himself in are TOTALLY different to ANYTHING players have experienced before. The character who defined platform games is now leading players in a new direction. *Gnnh!* Mario is almost crushed beneath this King of The Bomb Soldiers. Quick, before he blows! A magic carpet provides transport between worlds. The red cloud is a HUGE fireball. Gulp. 20 "


"computer video games ME AND MY SHADOW NINTENDO 64 Promise of a totally submersive experience with N64 is exaggerated of course, but Nintendo aren't stretching the truth by much. Existing 2D Mario games are absolute hand-eye coordination marathons, where players are the spectator objects above, below, and behind the central character are taken into account at a glance. Mario 64 drops you right in there. It genuinely feels that you are undertaking the adventure with Mario; sharing the same space. When the plumber stops to look around, it's as though you are standing right behind him, peering over his shoulder. Even when Mario is dashing around at the opposite side of the room, or further down the field, the illusion is that you are in the same environment. That's where the magic lies with SM64 and that's before trying to make sense of the tasks ahead. In Japan this towering creature is called Sanbo, but we know him better as Pokey. How can Mario get by without Yoshi's help? Nintendo 64: Super Mario 64 A Kuribo (Goomba) and Noko-Noko (Koopa) attack the intrepid plumber in formation! Help! What's your favourite colour, baby?

Consequently we cannot tell you a great deal about Shogi history which is probably a relief for most people. Shogi is a more complex board game than chess, and the N64 has proven itself capable of processing moves five times faster than any other computer. This is impressive in itself. However to make their game even more superior, Seta employed the talents of \"the king of computer Shogi», Shinichiro Kanezawa. And on top of that, the most popular Shogi player of Japan Yoshiharu Habu. Ahem. Stop pulling that horrible face! Maybe a Japanese 'table game' isn't how you'd imagine an N64 showcase to behave. But, Saikyo Habu Shogi is extremely impressive. I GOT ALGORITHM Of the three N64 games available at launch, Seta's Shogi game stands as irrefutable proof of the systems incredible processing power. But it helps that Shinichiro Kanezawa's genius is such that he can create incredibly neat 'thinking' algorithms, and have them imitate a number of famous Shogi players. Of course the best player of all to imitate is our new friend Habu... ISN'T HE LOVELY Nintendo 64: SAIKYO HABU SHOGI So what's the big deal with this guy Habu? Well, he's apparently very popular with certain Japanese. Especially or so we are told the women. They think he's cute. More importantly, Habu became the Shogi World Champion in February this year. By working alongside Mr Kanezawa, Habu has made Shogi accessible to a much larger audience than ever before. eLE SEA LICHEN SEEI E U TE .. MAMAS AND PAPAS YOU WILL LEARN TO UNDERSTAND! Okay, so this game is definitely one for most Westerners to file under 'Nope'. But we didn't think you'd forgive us for skimping on N64 launch software. Plus you now have something interesting to tell your mates. Saikyo Habu Shogi ought to appeal to every Japanese who falls under Nintendo's 'Family Computer' umbrella. Mums and Dads included. The game is certainly more worthwhile than the numerous Pachinko games which appeared with the PlayStation at its launch. So there you have it. We think it's cool. 2 CH * * 62 # (1053# VPSTEXA) Just in case Nintendo decide Shogi deserves world recognition, and an English language game is released in the West, rest assured there are numerous ways to ease yourself into its philosophy. In the Experimental Room, Habu gives instruction for over 600 moves. From here you can make your own notebook, which is no doubt stored on a memory card. The difficulty of Shogi is dictated by something called Thume: Three-hand Thume is easy, 15-hand is tough. Like we say, don't worry if this BBS makes no sense at all, because Habu and his fellow professionals are always at hand to talk players through any difficulty. RRR 2 C A 23 #37 59B-R A Thanks to N64's solid 3D hardware, the game is represented super sharp and perfectly clear. So no eyestrain.

And we totally trashed them in a Quake deathmatch! Well, we got a few frags on Mike. Iright, alright, we admit it. We don't have Shareware Quake for you this month. Its not our fault! It's those perfectionists at id! Always fiddling and refining. They just won't stop 'till the game's absolutely brilliant! Anyway, to tide you over until the Shareware release next month (touch wood), here's the full low down on the current Deathmatch preAlpha test, as well as some exclusive info on what to expect from the finished version. Happy now? QUAKE IT'S DOOM ON STEROIDS! TEST A small, neatly constructed Medieval level ideal for two to four players. You can obtain the double barrel shotgun, nail gun and grenade launcher on this stage, as well as two suits of armour. Look for an obvious secret door that leads to a ledge containing an extra 100% health, but beware the loud clanking sound the door makes when opening thus announcing your location to every other player on the level! The sound of the grinding grates leading to the teleporter, or the sound of a player actually teleporting, also relay crucial information about your opponent's location. This player stands out a bit too much. If you want good camouflage, try using «COLOR 1 3\". OMING SOON Mind the flying torso! At the top, you can see a poor player being blown to bits from the touchplate required to reach the gold armour. The bottom left picture shows how it's possible to shoot people through floor beams.

"computer Video games TEST 2 TAKE AIM Aptly named 'the Dungeon' this second Test Map is set in a dank, dark labyrinth of claustrophobic stone corridors and vast open halls. It's bigger than Test1, ideally suiting three to six players, and contains many more occurances of the fearsome lava! Aside from the usual gun action (which includes the introduction of the Rocket Launcher) players can use switches to initiate crushing walls in certain rooms, or to retract the main hall's floor, thus plunging any unfortunately positioned players into a lake of bubbling magma! Or you could use another switch to crush an opponent hiding in a side room waiting to ambush you. What joy! ROM LONG BARREL SHOTGUN A long range weapon with a decent reload rate, though its noticeable lack of power makes it a poor choice for heavy fire fights. There are lots of lava pits in the dungeon sections. Force someone into one of them to minus one of their kills. Mouse aiming is very useful around here, because of all the stairs and ledges. AThere, on the ledge! Blam! Down he goes! DOUBLE BARREL SHOTGUN This baby packs a mean punch at close range, downing an unarmed opponent in just two shots. A true 'craftsman's' tool. IT'S DOOM ON STEROIDS! This little section is usually good place to hide if you need a breather. Trouble is, if someone follows you, you're stuck in a dead end! Notice the way that the water covers the players' ankles! NAIL GUN Rapidly firing copious nails of the nine inch variety, this gun is great for messy players who can't be bothered with boring things like aiming. TEST Test3 is the largest and most elaborate of the three test levels, featuring as it does a compact crate-filled maze, a spiralling stair case that leads to a valuable suit of red armour, and a mind-bending underwater section. It is supposed to be an example of Quake's 'Military Base' setting, and due to its size it is only really suitable for four or more players. Still, there are plenty of bonuses and weapons to collect (including the all-powerful Chain Nail Gun), and if you can find the hardware, this is definitely the best deathmatch level to play on. A Dodge the pellets... And return fire! CHAIN NAIL GUN Similar to the nail gun only twice as powerful, and twice as rapid. Thus shredding its target in a quarter of the time! Ouch! It's a race to the top... Almost got him... GRENADE LAUNCHER Lobs bouncing grenades that ricochet of walls and explode on contact with any other creatures. Fun for all the family. NOUS YNWOJ He's getting away... Boom! I win! ROCKET LAUNCER Using the same ammo supply as the Grenade Launcher, this weapon fires deadly rockets straight at its target. Drop some grenades. The chain nail gun! "

TAR BABY These slime puddles squelch around on the dungeon floor and walls, ready to leap out on any unsuspecting adventurers. Remember to check those ceilings! 30 "


"COOL STUFF! computer video games ROM As you may already know, one of the greatest things about Quake is the flexibility of the game engine. id have designed Quake so it can be easily customised or altered in just about any way imaginable. This has lead to a load of user-designed patches posted on the internet over the past few months including the Terminator and Boba Fett player textures we showed last issue. By far the coolest patch additions so far are the range of config file scripts that allows the player to access a variety of new gameplay features at the press of a button! How does the likes of Sniper Mode or X-Ray vision grab you? Or what about an isometric map that reveals the location of both the other players AND the monsters on the level? Check out these shots...

THE BEST MAP EVER! Code available on the internet allows players to use this incredible map, and id Software say that the final version will be similar. It currently shows all monsters, items and other players. A Killing players as they run sends them flying! Yes its true. In the luxury GT suite at last month's ECTS, CVG enjoyed a few sodas with id supremo Jay Wilbur and got down to some serious Quake testing. Quake will adopt a similar structure to Doom, with the final version comprising three episodes each containing up to nine levels each, plus special deathmatch levels (the Shareware version will include the entire first episode). The actual game mechanics (movement, aiming,etc.) remain much the same as they are in the Deathmatch test, but the code has been optimised so it now runs a lot faster. Despite this, the target specs have changed from a DX266 to a low end Pentium, with the Saturn and PlayStation conversions arriving a couple of months after the initial PC release. The version we saw featured all-new levels and textures, new sounds, new monsters (see opposite page!), new gameplay features (you can now drown underwater!) and the promise of three new weapons, including the ability to smack enemies with the butt of your gun when your ammo runs out! NEXT MONTH: SPOOGE TIME! Next month we really should have the shareware version of Quake. Er, fingers crossed. And its going to be massive no matter what platform you own. So make sure get the next issue. OK! COMING SOON 31 "

Zekin Gamof Vector NEW HUNTING GROUND 28 29 O'42-46 3D ORIGINAL CAPCOM BEAT 'EM UP WAPIGU Gamor What Star Gladiator helps us realise first and foremost is just how Capcom approach this hitherto virgin territory for them. Immediately apparent is that the character design is unlike anything we've seen from them before not even in their craziest Mega Man or Ghouls and Ghosts moments. Instead of Japanese schoolgirls we have Raptors. Indian Yoga practitioners are replaced by robots. Like Namco's visually spectacular Soul Edge, Gladiator is a weapons based fight scenario. Characters brandish such tools as axes, spears, and daggers all of which produce similar traces and flares as those in the Namco game. Occasionally though, fighters resort to standard kicks and punches. It is not yet certain how any of these moves are executed though it appears to borrow from all areas of the beat 'em up field. Capcom's first fighter to completely abandon the six-button/ joystick initiated techniques? Don't bet on it. Biasa THE HARDER THEY FALL -0 09-36 CULOS At certain points during a battle, some Gladiators morph into some other fantastic shape. In some cases this means enlarging themselves to such a degree that the floating cam is forced to pull right back to take them into account! Speaking of dramatic camera angles, there are many extreme viewpoints employed in SG, with close-ups playing a major role whenever a character pulls off an especially impressive pyro display! Vector Gore GHIE 05 Garof 0'11-66 Zelkin, the character on the right, uses wings to divebomb his opponents. Gamof the squat robot fighter cleaves his foes with that huge axe slung over his shoulder. INVADING YOUR HOME 1111 In case you hadn't already guessed, Star Gladiator's System 11 architecture means that a near perfect home version is possible for PlayStation. Hence the game's appearance at the 1996 PlayStation Expo in Japan. Now that's an awful lot of people who are suddenly wearing big happy smiles on their faces... Bet you can't wait! More news as soon as we get it. 0-00 00 34 "

"computer video games SNAP THOSE LIMBS! POWER UP ATTACKS! Everyone loves broken limbs, especially when David Busst snapped his leg in half playing against Man Utd last month! Tekken 2 is one of the only fighting games to feature bone-breaking moves, and because they're so spectacular everyone wants to learn them first. The master of breaking legs is King, who can perform a sequence of three breaks, ending with a fantastic move which breaks all four limbs in one go! Many of the fighters possess moves which take time to charge up. These are normally ridiculously powerful, but leave the player vulnerable for a few seconds while they charge themselves up. Though they are often too risky to use in the middle of a fight, a well-timed power attack can bring a fighter back from the brink of defeat. Roger and Alex, for exam ple, can perform a move which will occasionally cause 100% damage! TM ayStation Crakll After a second or so, he swipes his opponent in the ribs... 13 DENTA 1.

Three o'clock in the morning, tearing our hair out over a bunch of pixelated rodents that insist on killing themselves. Until recently though, it seemed it was finally behind us. After 3D Lemmings put in an appearance on the PlayStation though, Saturn owners started to get worried. Justifiably so, because they're back, destined to make your life an addictive misery. «Ahhh no! Please no more! I can't take it! That's it! Quick, get the cyanide capsules! Suicide! Oh yes! The lemmings are back, and just to complicate things they've all popped into 3D!\" 3D LEMMINGS VIEW FROM A BRIDGE JUMP CUTS As well as ascribing lemmings life saving roles, there are some other things you'll want to get to grips with in 3D Lemmings. Because you can actually move round buildings and platforms, there are three different camera angles to utilise, all of which rotate through 360°. You can also zoom in and out to get a better perspective on the particular obstacles your furry chums are facing. This might seem a little awkward at first but it's essential for solving the puzzles. EVEN OINTMENT CAN'T RID US OF LEMMINGS! The introduction of 3D for the more sophisticated 32 bit market makes things a bit more complicated for our lemmings. Lateral thinking is the order of the day with more interaction with buildings and platforms, forcing you to keep your eye on two things at once. The puzzles are just as complicated as ever with four difficulty levels: fun, tricky, taxing and mayhem. Fortunately a practice mode has been introduced so you can familiarise yourself with the more cunning problems posed by 3D puzzles and get used to the different lemming roles. IN 1 OUTS 20 810 DANGER MINEFIELD CCT UTS 10 125 LOG WONDERFUL WORLD WALKER In the old days, looks tended to take second place to the puzzles where Lemmings was concerned. Not so with 3D Lemmings. Almost the whole environment is interactive with lemmings wandering just about anywhere, be it Aztec pyramids, ancient castles or futuristic tunnels. The option of a virtual lemming means you've chance to see lemming world in even greater detail. And even the furry little blighters look better than ever, all dopey gazes and aimless waddling. Rest assured though, there will still be times when you're actually glad to see the irritating rodents dead! Wu JUTED 216 AUTO 47 GAE A new dimension in Lemming fun, literally. We can't wait for 3D Worms. 40\" NEW ROLE ed 3D Lemmings comes with a couple of extra lemming roles for the player to make use of. Both of them are in fact necessary to fully enhance the all-new 3D environments. Turner He does a similar job to a blocker except the lemmings won't simply turn around and start walking in the opposite direction but turn in the direction the turner lemming is pointing. You get to see each Lemming closeup! How did we ever put up with 2D before? FMV intermissions add more excitement' to this already gutbusting rollercoaster of entertainment. Virtual Lemming NEXT MONTH... AAGH! AAAGH! AAAAGH! It had to happen sooner or later I suppose, so here it is, the virtual lemming. Choose this and you actually view things from the eyes of a lemming. This is essential when lemmings travel inside buildings or if you want to get a closer look at whatever problem you're facing. It also allows you to enjoy the snazzy 3D that little bit more. Lemmings is the type of game that develops almost as many enemies as fans and it's only fair to warn those in the enemy camp that 3D Lemmings looks like doing nothing to appease, you. For fans though this looks like being the ultimate test of patience and tefal-headedness. Expect the nerve shredding review next month. 44 "

"computer video games 70% HOUSE D * OCTION ACTION BY EA  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  STORAGE 1 CD Med version COMPLETE PlayStation SEPTEMBER '96 1 PLAYER SATURN  RELEASED BY EA TEL: 01753 549442 PlayStation SEGI EU DIE HARD TRILOGY Explosions aplenty in Die Hard With A Vengeance! Following the success of Alien Trilogy, Fox licensed another of their popular movie franchises to EA with Bruce Willis' stunning Die Hard films being recreated for the PlayStation, Saturn and PC by Probe. s opposed to lumping all three films and their radically different plots into one mishmash of a game, Probe base a separate game around each of New York cop, John's McClean's three adventures. As such, the battle against Hans Gruber in the Nakatomi tower block is recounted as a Loaded-style shoot 'em up, while the Dallas airport siege that was the bones of Die Harder's plot is represented by a Virtua Cop clone. Finally, as Hans Gruber's brother, Simon, returned to avenge his brother's death by blowing up key parts of New York, the player finds themselves in a driving game reminiscent of Sony's Twisted Metal. Live Fast, Die Hard on Saturn and PlayStation! DIE HARD DIE HARDER DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE VUULUULE Each of the games in can be played as a separate entity, but Probe are also planning to link the three wherein, if played in sequence, the user is rewarded with linking footage lifted directly from the films ie. the plane exploding at the end of Die Harder. Here's a closer look at the action: DIE HARD UUUTSUUU The first film saw Willis' McClean character pitted against a crack team of international terrorists who, while fronting a political motive, were actually hijacking the Nakatomi Corporation's vault for the money in the safe in its basement. Lead by Hans Gruber, the gang seize control of the lobby before making their way up to the 31st floor where the staff are enjoying a party before breaking up for Christmas. With New York cop in town to meet his estranged wife who works there, he becomes caught up in the siege and begins a one-man war on Gruber and his men, using the tower's many shafts and corridors as the battleground. The game follows the film's plot fairly closely, but Gruber's army has been expanded from a dozen men to several hundred in order to create a fastpaced blast. Similar in style to Loaded and The Chaos Engine, the player guides the McClean sprite through the fifteen levels which make up the building, using whatever weapons come to hand to pick off the UZI-toting bad guys. Probe have used blueprints from the film to recreate the rooms as closely as possible, and the player will find themselves engaging the gang in Katagi's strategy room, the underground car park, and, finally, on the roof of the building. Some early target practice... VUU17/0 McClean looks for 'clues' in the Nakatomi building lavs. A tense moment in which our hero reccy's the terrorists' truck. ...which comes in useful later! 46 "


"computer video games DIE HARDER 1111111 QUILT PlayStation Virtua Cop style operation. 1 Take out the snow-speeder! Meeting his wife at Dallas airport for a second Christmas break, McClean is again the 'wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time' as he becomes embroiled in a plan to free a vicious dictator. A team of terrorists have tapped into the airport's controls, and threaten to crash each of the planes in turn unless their plans for the evil General's release are met and one of the first planes on their list is the one with McClean's wife on it! Proving that anything Sega can do, the PlayStation can match, Probe have turned Die Harder into a Virtua Cop clone. As the player guides a floating cross hair across the screen, the airport is scrolled through in a preset pattern, with the 'camera' automatically looking up and down to reveal would-be threats. In keeping with Virtua Cop's look, the airport and the terrorists in it are all polygonbased, and McClean also finds extra weapons by blowing up crates. However, expanding on the Cop idea, the highexplosive weapons can be used to blow chunks out of the scenery, crushing anyone below. The final battle then leads to the departing plane as the General and his men get away... SATURN MUID T DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE Hans Gruber's brother, Simon, gives the Big Apple an unwelcome wake up call by blowing up a busy street, and then demanding McClean follow a series of bizarre orders. These include wandering around Harlem wearing a sandwich board with a racist slogan emblazon across the front, racing through New York in a 'borrowed' cab, and eventually exploring the sewer network in search of Simon who has used the explosions to cover a huge gold heist. As Die Hard With a Vengeance is spread all across New York, Probe have opted to concentrate on the car chases that made up the middle part of the film. Seated behind the wheel of the yellow cab, the player is left to zoom around the busy streets of New York in search of bombs Simon has left. A large target indicator offers a clue as to the bomb's location, and the basic aim is to ram the explosive to prevent it detonating. However, Probe's New York is populated with jaywalking pedestrians, selfish lorry drivers, and other equally bad drivers making things very hairy indeed. Live Fast, Die Hard on Saturn and PlayStation! COMING SOON A head-on collision causes this car to recoil across the street. Viewing the action from outside the car. Avoid the pedestrians! 0 Ram the Bomb Car off the road! 1 Too late! The bomb explodes, right beneath McClean's car!

As any role-player worth their Monster Manual knows, it's always the DM who has the most fun, creating the scenario, putting the traps and monsters in it and then throwing it all at the hapless players. That's the premise of Dungeon Keeper. Similar to Theme Park, you start with a basic dungeon inhabited by small monsters. By adding more tunnels and rooms, so more, bigger, monsters come to the dungeon. Eventually these minions can build tricks and traps. But you have to hurry, because it's only a matter of time before the first wandering hero decides to rid the land of YOU! 1 In first-person view, you get to face your own horror creations! Knight!

"computer video games FIGHTING BY CAPCOM  AVAILABLE EARLY JUNE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE  STORAGE 1 CD  PUBLISHED BY VIRGIN TEL : 0171 368 2255 SEGAM SATURN .99 (UK) 1-2 PLAYER SATURN Question: What do you get if you cross a 2D beat 'em up with a load of old Z budget horror movies? Answer: Night Warriors! Capcom's monster extravaganza is ready to kick some unholy ass on Sega Saturn! T G y to kick W RRIORS ARRIORS DARKSTALKERS' REVENGE n 1994 Capcom released Vampire (Darkstalkers), a brilliant horror spin off from their ultra successful Street Fighter 2 series. Unfortunately, due to stiff competition from the likes of Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Vampire bombed on initial release, and it wasn't until a year later with the superior sequel, Night Warriors, that the Darkstalkers phenomenon really took off. In actual fact, the Night Warriors PCB was just a Darkstalkers board with an extra upgrade chip, but that didn't stop the arcade punters flocking to it in undead droves! ES MOVES SISSELERATO7 Srecini Night Warriors offers a unique twist to super moves with the brilliant ES and EX system. Most of the characters basic special moves (such as fireballs and dragon punches) are ESpecial. Once your Special Meter is powered up (by attacking) you can use a super variant of the attack by performing the standard move action, but with two punch or kick buttons, instead of one. TWISTED GAMEPLAY! 2016 While Night Warrriors undeniably borrows many elements from other Capcom 2D beat 'em ups such as X-Men and Street Fighter 2 (e.g. three punch and kick strengths, best of three bouts, Auto Guard mode etc.), its unique premise allows the game to take these concepts one warped step further. Yes there are special moves and techniques, but not as you know them... EX MOVES! On top of the Especials, each warrior also has a set of devastating character specific EXspecials that can ONLY be performed when the Special Meter has been charged. EX's are more difficult to perform than ES's, but the spectacular results speak for themselves! One of Demitri's more powerful EX moves is the Bat Swarm! AND OO Goog Special REVIEW 62 "


"computer Video games HORRIFIC COMBOS! The heart of any good beat 'em up is its combo system, as Capcom should know they invented combos with Street Fighter 2! While familiar chains and two-in-ones form the basis of most of the combination attacks, Capcom have made the combo system flexible to encourage gamers to have a go at creating their own custom combos. Any punch or kick can be chained together provided it is of greater strength than the last hit (and timed right of course), and any ES or EX can be made in to a two-in-one. TWO-IN-ONES NIG Felicia's 34-hit EX is a destruc tive move par excellence! Gallon can dash in all directions: up, down, everywhere! For some reason you can't use heavy hits for two-in-ones... ...but you can use any special you like! Have some of that! ARRIORS POUNCE 500 TSHOP 7 hos A TECHNIQUES EXPLOSION! ROLL AERIAL BLOCKING SER 22 When your fighter is knocked to the ground, by holding either left or right they can spring to their feet a considerable distance from where they fell. Just like SF Alpha, you can now block in the air. No more embarrassing jumps into fireballs! First seen in Virtua Fighter, the pounce allows you to get in a sneaky extra attack on a downed opponent. Press Up and kick the moment they hit the ground and Bob's your rather painful uncle. PROJECTILE REPULSION GUARD DASH SPECIAL @ THROWS REVERSAL GUARD RE Just like X-Men, by double tapping the D-pad either towards or away from your bestial enemy, your character will dash in that direction. Dashes are character specific and range from flying (Morrigan) to teleporting (Lei-Lei). Fire a projectile (fireball or whatever) a split second after your opponent launches one, and it pushes theirs back towards them! This affects the trend of fireball fights considerably! On top of the usual hard kick and punch throws every character has a special throw, normally activated by a half circle away with punch or kick but sometimes a 360° Spinning Pile Driver motion. These throws offer some of the most spectacular moments of Night Warriors, not to mention some of the most painful. Similar to the Alpha Counter, but here it doesn't cost you a Super Meter level! As soon as you see the block connect, do the counter to turn your defensive block into an offensive attack. Split second timing is needed though, and it only works consistently if you can predict the attack. MERE CREVIEW This EX can't be blocked! Er, a whale in the amazon? JI Monty Python eat your heart out. Or one of these guys will. C "


"computer Video games LEI-LEI THE AVENGING GIRL CHAIN COMBO EX COMBO A nice simple chain for 8 Perform the crane drop as hits. Timing between the you land. The punches medium and hard is the key. won't hit, but the kicks and crane will! ING HARD PUNCH JUMPING HARD PUNCH \"PLEASE DON'T BE SCARED OF ME\" Lel-Lei is one of Night Warriors two new characters, who has transformed herself into a 'Kyunsi' (a Chinese vampire) in order to defeat the Darkstalkers and rescue her mother's lost soul. Her power stems from her costume, from which she can produce a never ending stream of weapons and oddities. Her unusual appearance and moves have made her the most popular NW character in Japan, and we reckon she's one of the best too. Her dash allows her to teleport through enemies (or run if she's in the air), while many of her basic attacks hit multiple times. LIGHT PUNCH LIGHT KICK MEDIUM PUNCH HARD KICK ES NORMAL NGARRIOR SPINNING BLADE THROW As you can see, a rather painful experience all round. ANKIHO Projectile attacks hit low and high, or go off the screen and fall back down on your enemy to stun! Can two-in-one up close on tall opponents. AWAY AND HARD PUNCH ES ES MAGICAL SHIELD A magical shield that repels all projectiles, and, when powered up, all ordinary hits as well. SWINGING DEATH A Dragon Punch variant that sees Lei-Lei swinging from the ceiling to strike opponents multiple times with the blades of her costume. CRANE DUMP EX CRANE DUMP Tricky to pull off, but devastating. If the possessed crane doesn't get them, the ensuing spike shower will. SWORD WAVE Lei-Lei puts her hands into the ground and a wave of giant swords sweep the screen, keeping aerial opponents bouncing from blade to blade. THE TWO NEW NIGHT WARRIORS! DONOVAN THE DARK HUNTER \"I WILL DESTROY ANYONE WHO HAS FILMY BLOOD\" ES COMBO ES COMBO A simple but effective twoin-one combo for 7+ hits. The trick to this 10-hit combo is timing the sword to hit in the middle of the chain. JUMPING PLANT AN ES SWORD (4 BUTTONS) ROUNDHOUSE Poor old Don was born half demon, half human, and he's got a rightsized chip on his shoulder about it. So much so, that he's decided to hunt down all the other demons in the world and do away with them. Good luck to him we say. Donovan is another character who, despite having Ryu/Ken style moves, play's nothing like them. He has strong close range abilities, as well as the best projectile attack of the game (the recovery free-kill shred) ES KILL SHRED Press same sized kick and punch strength and Donovan sticks his sword in the ground. Press again to launch it a foe with no recovery delay! JUMP TOWARDS AND SUMMON SWORD JAB BLIZZARD SWORD A rather ineffective fireball variant that freezes the opponent should it connect. DEMON METAMORPHOSIS Another tough move to pull off in the heat of battle, and one which doesn't inflict that much damage either. In its defence, however, it does look really cool. HIT IN AIR MATH HARD KICK... LIGHTENING SWORD ES ES V..LIGHT, MEDIUM AND OLYMPIAN STOMP A giant foot squishes anyone underneath it. Use the different kick strengths for different areas of the screen. REVIEWE LIGHTNING SWORD Send 20,000 volts through your enemy with a reverse Dragon Punch motion, tapping the button for extra hits! Long recovery time though. STRONG CHAIN NORMAL EFREET SWORD A good Dragon Punch alternative that is best reserved for taking down aerial attackers. SWORD GRAPPLE Donovan's special throw isn't a throw at all. And it's not very special. He simply uses his sword to dice the enemy into monster salad. "


"computer video games PYRON THE ALIEN CHAIN COMBO ES COMBO \"I AM THE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE!\" A hard hitting chain that leaves 'em standing. So follow up with more abuse. The Energy Spin knocks the opponent down long enough to follow up with an ES pounce. JUMPING HARD PUNCH JUMPINGLIGHT KICK SATURN From his home planet of Hellstorm, Pyron believes he is the ruler of the known universe. Made of pure energy he destroys planets just for kicks, but stops at Earth when he spots the battles of the Darkstalkers. Intrigued by their altercations, he makes himself material and goes down to join the fray. Pyron is an easy character to get to grips with, and a powerful one at that, but his lack of combo potential makes him limiting for experienced players. LIGHT PUNCH ENERGY SPINES PUNCHIN POUNCE ES COSMIC DISLAPTION EX Pyron's one EX is a bit of a let down. Sure it looks nice and all that, but it doesn't inflict that much damage and can be spotted coming a mile off. ENERGY SPIN ES A Hurricane Kick derivative that can only be performed in the air. ARRIORS NORMAL TOWARDS AND FIERGE PUNCH PLASMA SLAM Pyron's special throw is a cheesy Pile Driver attack that gains advantage over almost every other move. An aroma of fromage precedes it. ZODIAC FIRE ES A dragon punch move that goes horizontally as opposed to vertically! What's the world coming to? NORMAL SOL SMASHER ES Another fireball attack that conforms to the vector theory. Pyron's balls are rather large and so tricky to avoid. He can also fire them from the air! TELEPORT Well, what kind of boss would he be if he couldn't use the old M Bison teleport and throw cheat? CONTROL THE BOSSES IN NIGHT WARRIORS! PHOBOS THE ROBOT EX COMBO CHAIN COMBO If the light punch connects, the next 27-hits are guaranteed. A surprisingly good 6-hit chain for a character generally ineffective up close. Follow up with a pounce for good measure. JUMPING HARD PUNCH LIGHT KICK \"ENEMY TERMINATED > OK\" Phobos is one of thousands of giant robots built by an ancient civilisation to protect them during a titanic supernatural war. When the war finished, the robots where consigned to a cave in Mexico, but now centuries later, one of them has been mysteriously re-activated.. Phobos is a lot like Sentinel from X-Men a lumbering cumbersome giant who specialises in long range attacks. Interestingly, he can also control the downward arc of his jumps. LIGHT PUNCH MEDIUM PUNCH HANG HANG PEMEX ELECTRO-MAGNET THROW Phobos draws his opponents in on a giant magnet, twiddles them around and shoots them into the sky. Powered up he also slams them around a bit first. LASER BEAM A Cyclops style fireball beam that hits high, low and straight up. CROUCHING HARD KICK AIR GUARD GUN ES AIR GUARD GUN A light beam is fired into the air, and anyone who jumps across it receives multiple high calibre rounds to their unprotected rear! HANG TEM An electro hook hangs the opponent in the air. Combine with other attacks for best results. REVIEW 26 ANTI PERSONAL BOMB Chunky fireball equivalent that hits low and explodes on contact to frazzle the opponent, much to everyone's amusement. CANNON Phobos transmutes into a huge cannon to deliver a vast high tech firepower punch! "


"computer games CONF IGURATION DARE TO COMPARE CONTROL FREAK! There are currently two other Capcom beat 'em ups doing the rounds on the Saturn (X-Men and Street Fighter Alpha), both of which are excellent games and come thoroughly recommended by CVG. Yet, despite being the same type of game, Night Warriors is noticeably different. The imagination and detail in the design of these characters really does create a new world of fighting. See for yourselves. As anyone who's attempted to play SF Alpha on the PlayStation will sympathise, the diagonal free Sony pads are not the most thumb friendly pieces of apparatus going. Thankfully, Sega's pads are small wonders of engineering and allow for pain free precise six-button control. Night Warriors features an in-game options screen which allows players to configure any attack to any button, even providing a three button in one option for those looking for easy ES's. SF ALPHA CHILDREN OF THE ATOM -Level 1 NIGHT WARRIORS 4007 SAIBA 42093 NURRIORS A Abog standard uppercut. Nice biceps, but little else to impress. Now this is better. A whopping great big sword. A The words 'very' and 'weird' spring to mind. 25 OUEU EROS CICLOPS. rewall RW CEVEL Ryu's super fireball. You know it. you love it. You've seen it before. Cyclops Optic Blast! Impressive indeed Still sane dammit! A Aulbath summons a tidal wave! Anthuris Susquet A Birdie throws with his chain. A Collosus gives it some wellie. Nice. Erm... BISTRO MY FIREBALL WON'T WORK! emal Srecio REVIEW * 5157LOOR Not only does Night Warriors look completely different to Street Fighter Alpha and X-Men, but in the case of many of the characters, it plays differently too. Entirely new control techniques must be learnt, particularly when fighting with specialist characters like Anakaris or Bishamon. For instance, Anakaris can swallow an opponents projectile and then spit it out for the rest of the round like it was his attack! Bishamon has a Mortal Kombat style sword hook that can be followed up with one of two options. 66 "


"computer video games COMMENT MORRIGAN COSTUME CHANGE CLEAN When you win a round with Morrigan hold down all three kick buttons and she'll change into some natty duds. SECAM WUFTEA SATURN It's clear that Capcom put their heart and soul into developing Night Warriors for the arcade. Likewise this Saturn conversion will go down in history as one to beat. Night Warriors marked a major step-up for Capcom's portfolio: Darkstalkers previewed the incredible cell-animation style which defined X-Men and SF Alpha, then NW tightened up the outrageous game play. What we're left with (and full animation in the Saturn version makes it an exact carbon copy) is arguably the most accomplished 2D fighter Capcom have ever produced. Yes, in spite, or maybe because, of SFA's popularity, many hardcore players stand by NW as superior. And who am I to argue? PAUL DAVIES HIDDEN GOUKI! NIG AT CODES, CODES, CUVES! URRIORS COMMENT RRIORS Before you get too excited, the great pony tailed one is only present in statue form as one of the many bric-a-brac items that Lei-Lei throws from within her costume. These also include the Capcom pin wheel symbol, Vega's claw, Chun Li's wrist band and even a Bonsai Tree. ORIGINAL BACKGROUNDS AND FULL ANIMATION! On the options screen, move to configuration option and input on pad 1: B, X, Down, A, Y (Anakaris' Sarcophagus drop). If you've done it correctly, an extra 'Appendix! option should now appear at the bottom of the screen, and from there you can select the original Darkstalker's music, backgrounds and colour. Even better you can select to have full animation on in same character battles (e.g. Phobos vs Phobos). When Night Warriors arrived in our office, we were under the grip of X-Men and SFA fever, and on first impressions this game paled. After all, why waste time with unknown horror characters, when you can play as superheroes or street fighters? I'll tell you why for the most ludicrous fighting you've ever experienced! These characters are so supernatural in their moves, that at first you can't even tell when you're pulling off a hard kick. But once you adapt to it, you realise that beneath the OTT surface is a finely-tuned fighting game that may even match SFA! prefer SFA and import X-Men over this, but really, only personal taste can separate these awesome titles. Tom CusW OPTION MODE APPENDIX DIRICULTY TIME LIMIT TREE IT A1 STAR MAR FAB FIFE AHATIC PULL 11 PLAUNATION1 REVIEWER CUT ANIMATION FULL ANIMATION OPTION MODE Gatora tend DIFICITY TIME LIMIT  TURBO SPEED SHORTCIT OFF =     T SUNT YODE STEFFC After a quick glance at these pages you'd be forgiven for thinking that Night Warriors is little more than Street Fighter 2 with monsters. And initially it does appear that way. But scratch beneath the surface and you soon start to realise that there's much more to it than that. Capcom have collected together all of the best gameplay features from innumerable other beat 'em up sources, then injected a large dose of twisted imagination into the proceedings. I still can't believe some of those EX's are real! Yet despite the outrageous moves, the mechanics and characters are all finely balanced, and continued play rewards with an abundance of depth. Yes, fighting games are a niche market. Yes, the monster premise isn't going to appeal to everyone. But when a game arrives that combines the spectacular visuals and speed of X-Men with the fluidity and precision of Street Fighter Alpha, it's time for beat 'em up fans the world over to celebrate. Night Warriors is brilliant! DANJE JEVONS GIVE ME SOME SPEED! On the options screen move to the Turbo option and input on pad 1:X, X, Right, A, Z (Gouki's fire cracker from Alpha). The Turbo option should now stretch to the mad cap 10 stars mark for light speed conflict! 1 Summon the original backgrounds. Cool cheat or what? REVIEW NOW LOADING! PIRE TUNTER RATING Night Warriors sets an all time speed record in fighting game loading times, with all the appropriate data loaded in a mere matter of seconds. Almost unnoticeable. Unlike PlayStation Alpha where you can almost make a cup of tea. NOTE: We previously covered this game under its Japanese name of Vampire Hunter. NIG AT We'd argue that this is Capcom at their most hungry for success. And the evidence of this quality oozes from every pixel. Wow! ARRIORS  "

If there's one thing better than violence, it's violence with a touch of sport. Time to thank the mighty Sony, methinks. t's no exaggeration to say that we've had absolute bucket-loads of sports games on the PlayStation, but for all the basketball, golf, and soccer simulations we've had, the all-American favourite, Ice Hockey, has remained untouched. Until now that is... Yes it's time to sharpen your skates and polish your helmets, as Sony themselves unveil their latest sport offering, complete with sampled crowds chanting, impressive 3D skating rinks, and those funny tunes they play on the organ every now and then. FACEOFF LOOK AT IT THIS WAY THE BIG MATCH [VIEW 1] One of the best views to play with is from the high isometric camera. Not only do you get to see all the action, but the height allows you to keep track of all your players' positions. [VIEW 3] The overhead view is about a simple as it gets, offering a good combination of height and simplicity. If you don't like your cameras panning all over the shop, you might like this. [REPLAY] If you want to go bonkers, why not muck about with the incredibly groovy replay system. This offers billions of camera variations to play with, as well as all the usual fast forward and rewind options. 291 Series New AND 27 E Correr COMMENT [FACE OFF] Each game starts with a brave referee standing in for the initial Face Off. The puck is then dropped between the two forwards who attempt to steal it away while simultaneously causing as much damage as possible to their opponent's knees. [GOAL!] And it's an early goal for Detroit! A bullet from Sergei Fedorov, with assistance from Sheppard and Coffey. It's easier to score using first time hits from passing manoeuvres than with individual heroics. There's no 'l' in team. Or something. 322 Seske Fedwar 2 M notector Interference [PENALTY] Ooh! And that's gonna' hurt! One minute Fedorov is the hero, and the next he's off the ice for interfering with the opposition's keeper. Of course, you can always turn the penalties off... and then it's clobberin' time! [IN GAME FACE OFF] Following any stoppage (ie. penalties, icing, the puck flying off into the crowd, etc.) the referee calls for another Face Off. This is where you'll suffer if you've only three players in the rink. You might win the puck, but what you gonna do with it? [VIEW 2] The camera on the ice level offers some incredibly dramatic views, but isn't always the most practical in use simply because it's hard to follow your team mates' movements in play. When I first got NHL '96 up and running | thought I was in for simple Mega Drivestyle hockey shenanigans. Thankfully, after a couple of minute's play, it becomes obvious that there are lots of hidden treats just waiting to be discovered. There's nothing particularly clever or complicated about NHL, it's just down to good old fashioned game play and handling. The momentum, inertia, gravity, and overall physics of the game are spot on, leaving you with an entirely satisfying feel of realism as far as slinking around the rink goes, while the presentation throughout is also highly commendable. The inclusion of detailed team data bases means that the game should appeal to die-hard hockey fans and puck virgins alike, so get hold of a mate, sort out passing and first time shots, and prepare for fun on a major scale! MATT BROUGHTON Slap shot to the forehead! REVIEW FOR YOUR INFORMATION It's not all action, you know.

Two teams out to smash each other squarely in the head? It can only be NFL Game Day! air to say that the majority of people watching American Football haven't got a clue what's going on. Of course, this could be completely wrong and we have just made complete arses of ourselves. But we're willing to bet a few brussel sprouts that there are at least a few readers secretly confessing as we speak. But let's be honest, it hardly makes things easy, does it? Forty five players on each team, but only 11 on the field at any time. Four 'downs' to make 10 yards without fumbling or being 'sacked'. Just what the hell are they on about? Well there's only one way to find out without leaving the armchair -and that's to play Sony's new NFL game. Er... hut, hut, hut. ..... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Ultimately, the appeal of NFL Game Day is down to how much interest you have in the sport itself. While Sony's NHL can just be played for the fun of it, to get anywhere in NFL you really need to have your head screwed on. The hardest part is becoming familiar with all the offensive and defensive calls. Some are obvious defending against attempted place kicks but otherwise it's all trial and error. Of course, this is where experi enced football viewers will have no problems, but it doesn't exactly welcome you in to start with. The 'coach' mode saves the game from being too user-unfriendly, as you can become familiar with the various plays without doing too much damage does. This allows you to simply pick the play and then let the computer do it's best to finish the job. NFL is no way as much fun as NHL '96, but remains a competent sports simulation. MATT BROUGHTON And here's the ultimate goal — a touchdown. You can attempt to run the ball into the scoring zone, but it's easier to throw it over the opposition. REVIEW SOIRECTION RATING Having caught the ball, you then have to get as far back up the field as possible. Here you need to make use of speed bursts, dives, and all the 'fending off' buttons. Once chosen, it's then down to you to carry out the play as best you can, either running or passing as directed by the play. Alternatively, you can select the 'coach' mode and let the computer play out your selection. And why not add insult to iniury with a decently placed kick? You'll only get a single point for this, but what the hey! Not exactly a \"pick up and play game, but one that offers reasonable rewards with time. 69 "

It's disturbing! It's downright disgusting! It's Acclaim's new interactive adventure, Bad Mojo! Iver wanted to view life through the eyes of a bug eyed cockroach? No, neither have we. But that hasn't stopped Pulse Entertainment from making a game about it! In Bad Mojo you play the part of Roger, a low-life college professor who is mysteriously transformed by a magical amulet into the aforementioned creepy crawly. As Roger it's your mission to guide the rambunctious roach around the seedy apartment building where he lives, searching for clues as to his condition, and more importantly, a way to return to his original form. ac MAPPED! Most of the action in Bad Mojo is viewed from a top/down flip screen perspective, with Roger traversing a series of disgusting household locations all rendered in sharp Super VGA graphics. To make things even more realistic, every screen is specially image mapped to convey height and depth on the various objects. What this means is that the animation on Roger changes as he clambers up and over an obstacle, making the background seem far more solid and interactive. Ace! Bad Mojo GOOD MOJO? COMMENT TEST DRIVE A ROACH TODAY! In Bad Mojo, pest control couldn't be easier. Simply use the cursor keys to move Roger in any one of eight directions... and that's it! The animation on the roach is incredibly realistic, as Roger skitters across filth-laden floors and table tops in a horribly convincing manner. Of course, being a mere cockroach, Roger is distinctly limited in the ways he can affect his environment, so a cunning manipulation of everyday household items, such as cigarette butts and beer bottle tops, is required to progress. As Roger explores the various locations he triggers a variety of FMV flashback sequences, cleverly blended into the background (e.g. newspaper article will come to life), and the player must then use these snippets of information to piece together the jigsaw puzzle of Roger's life. For an \"interactive adventure', Bad Mojo's story is really quite good, and after just a few hours play you begin to realise that Roger's metamorphosis is actually the best thing that ever happened to him! When I first heard that Acclaim were publishing a new 'interactive adventure I immediately dismissed it as the usual FMV rubbish. However, I'm glad to report that my fears were completely unfounded. Bad Mojo is both entertaining, disgusting and (gasp) original in equal parts! The animation on Roger is flawless, and the photo-realistic environments really do give you an impression of what it's like to view the world through the eyes of a cockroach. It has to be said that the game mechanics are somewhat limited, but for once the intriguing storyline and spooky atmosphere actually make up for this deficiency. Even the music is good! My only real criticisms of Bad Mojo are that, firstly, the play areas are so vast it takes a long to get from A to B (I suppose that's what its like for a bug), and secondly, the experience is a short one. But with production values this high, that's only to be expected. DAUZEL JEVONO MYSTIC SMEG! REVIEW RATING On your travels you will come across a number of other domestic' creatures, most of whom will try to kill you, but some who will aid you in your quest. Whenever you move onto on of these 'eye' symbols, a nearby creature will psychically connect to you and impart some valuable advice in the form of a rendered cut scene. Very handy. An original and entertaining adventure, with a lot to offer. Just don't play it while you're eating! H "

SHINING WISDOM It must be summer that brings out the demons in Shining Wisdom territory. More specifically the kingdom of Parmecia because each time the weather starts to improve, some huge, evil warrior appears to completely destroy everything! If the thought of slapping on a bit of sun cream, and relaxing with a Strawberry Split annoys them that much, you'd think they might move somewhere really drab like Runcorn. However, the somewhat predictable reality is that one evil elf wants to revive the Dark Giant, and you're the one that has to stop it... ONCE UPON A TIME  HOPE YOU'VE GOT A BIG BAG The game starts as you begin your first days work at the castle, and once you've been introduced to the King, he gives you the tedious job of night shift. During the course of this day, a dark mist descends over the castle, and the Princess is kidnapped. You are then sent to rescue her, where you discover that the Dark Elves, and more specifically Pazort, are planning to release the Dark Giant. Morever they've turned the Princess into a swan. All you've got to do is rescue the world, and that's where the adventure begins. Games begin at a fairly sedate pace, but once the initial problems have been tackled, more and more of the game opens up for you to wander around. Certain areas require more than just exploring, with items and orbs needed to be in your possession for any progress to be made. Here's where to find some of them: WodSM ONINIHS LIFE tx 77 Received Stip/ Shoes. Received Magic/ Hands. When the Princess is returned to the King, he opens the Treasury containing these gloves. With these on you can pick up and carry bombs. Once obtained from the Vale of Gudo, low rocks and fallen trees can be slid under. Also, secret rooms tucked into sections of rock are accessible with these. Grab them in the Lost Forest for a smart, long range attack to be added to your arsenal. They are capable of taking out more than one enemy per attack. LIFE LIFE OO REVIEW Received Doolittlel Conch. Received Monkeyi Suit. Get these from the Royal Crypt to be able to break through weak sections of floor. They can also kick away blocks of wood and the turtles from the Lost Forest. Only used a couple of times, but allows you talk to the princess when she has been turned into a swan, and the Trenches in the Lost Forest.

'It has unique fight systems, a massive game area, and is rock hard. All the elements that make a great RPG. So to say I was looking forward to a Saturn version would be a slight understatement. And, despite initial disappointments, I am pleased to say, that it too is up there with Force. The biggest problem is that it starts off too slow, and the story doesn't develop quick enough. But, with perseverance, Wisdom unfolds into an epic RPG adventure. The levels are varied, and get progressively harder as the game moves along, and you're always finding secrets and new items to test out. Graphically it could be better, but when a game plays like this, looks aren't of paramount importance. RPG fans definitely won't be disappointed. Don't expect to be bowled over by the presentation of Sw, but definitely prepare for an involving and ultimately very rewarding adventure. The gameplay is very different to the Shining Force games, it being more akin to Nintendo's Zelda IV in many respects. So if the strategy-based battle scenes of SW are what turns you on, you're better off with Mystaria. However if it's character development and intriguing plot details look no further. Another refreshing alternative for Saturn owners to the 'dip in arcade-oriented releases. And I love it. The hero confronts a character named Banbo. He's an early obstacle, and quite stupid.

Clap hands, here comes the ball! ( Coca-Cola t the moment the battle for soccer supremacy on the Saturn is being played out between FIFA '96 and the surprisingly good sequel to Victory Goal (currently available on import only). But now, after a few delays, Gremlin have Euro '96 ready. In case you didn't know it's a modification of their hit Actua Soccer, designed to fit in with the championship this summer, and hopefully ride on the belly of footy hype that's already starting to sweep the country. All of the usual sports sim extras are in there like the multi-viewing angles, the replay facility for a good gloat and the standard plethora of stats. Out in the shops in the last two weeks of May (the championship starts on June 9th), Euro '96 looks like putting away the last minute winner against FIFA '96. And it's even got the elder statesman of commentary, Barry Davies, to celebrate its success.

GOAL Coca-Cola GET IN SHAPE It is the curse of video game footballers that while they might outrun the other players, they'll never lose that marker under their feet. On the omnipotence of the programmer! Unlike most footy games though, Euro '96 sees this marker change shape. A triangle simply denotes that the player is on the ball straightforward enough. If it changes to a circle it means there is a passing opportunity. If a player is legging it down the wing, it might change to a square denoting the chance of a decent cross. Best though is a star which means the player singled out can then perform some flashy pass or shot like a Pele flick or bicycle kick. 06 GO When the marker is star shaped, your player is ready to attempt a real crowd pleaser.

"GAULD BLESS THE ENGLISH SHED computer Video games EUS:1:6 Ok so you might think stadiums like the Super Dome or the San Siro are the last word in the modern amphitheatre, but if you want atmosphere you can't beat an English footy stadium with the crowd right in your face. Euro '96 features all eight stadiums that are to be used in the championship, each of them juicily rendered and perfectly proportioned. What this means in real terms is that the atmosphere will change from one venue to the next. Likewise the size of the pitch. Obviously, this is veering towards trainspotting exactitude, but it's a mark of the extent to which the game tries to capture the spirit of this great sporting event. SATURN EMISETUP Done ENGLAND Coca-Cola STATTO 13 Perce IP Cascaine If you've always been slightly bemused as to how certain people can have such a vast knowledge of football stats, then bemuse no more because Euro '96 gives you every opportunity to get up to date with those all important squads, dates and scores. Each squad is right up to date, the programmers actually taking advice off some footy pundits to get what they think are the most accurate line ups for each team. There's also information on each teams performance in the Championship since it started in 1960 and on their form in the run up to the championship. It even singles out the players to watch for. 14-3-3 You're not singing. You're not singing. You're not singing anymore! You're not si-hi-inging an-ny moooore!!! Aaaaaaaaah!  GOAL SCORED BY T. SELYHES eart 96 COMMENT euro 963 MN NI I was slightly disappointed by FIFA '96 on the Saturn. While it played pretty well, I felt it lacked a sense of atmosphere which is so much a part of football. Euro '96 on the other hand makes no such oversight. Admittedly some of the thrill comes from knowing that the championship for real is almost upon us, but it is nevertheless impressive to see such an effort made to grasp the whole spectacle. At the foundations this is Actua Soccer, although Super Actua, Soccer might be more appropriate because the animation is slightly smoother and the game easier to get in to than it is on PC and PlayStation. The game logic ensures that if you're playing as one of the best teams in the Championship (you can argue over who) then the ball cunningly played into space is read by one of your equally sharp teammates. In fact, the graduation of standards is well thought out, and thoroughly in keeping with the form of the teams themselves something which makes the game all the more satisfying to play if you're a stickler for realism. All this combines to make Euro '96 one of the best games on the Saturn yet, and a marker for the potential still available to make even more classy footy sims COME ON YOU LIONS! ROB BR 641 REVIEW RATING RATING The best footy sim on the Saturn to date and an admirable accompaniment to the championship itself. 81 "

And we're on our way to it! TM Three new circuits, and a twoplayer link-up option. Faster cars, and secrets so amazing some people thought we were joking. Yup, the Revolution is here! oyal CVG readers already have a good idea how we rate Ridge Racer Revolution: like, it's the greatest thing four wheel experience on the PlayStation! But let's face it, «PlayStation owner + race fanatic = Ridge Racer\", no doubt about it. And Rx3 looks pretty much the same at least on the page.

O WHAT GOES AROUN 000 o BIGGER, TOUGHER CIRCUIT Revolution is so much more than a sequel. It's a link to an ongoing celebration! Namco's series, both in and out of the arcade, is now a mini culture unto itself. 'More of the same' is seldom an attractive proposition (unless it's Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat), but the Ridge Racer team have a knack for elevating the familiar appeal of fast cars and roads to another plane. And to those whom value for money is everything, just look at the custom extras on this year's domestic model: You could recomend RRR to your local Martial Arts club as a test of reflexes; it's that manic! Competing in the lower class cars may lull you into a false sense of security, but grade up and your reactions are tested to the very limit: devilish corners set you up for worse ones lurking just behind.

More than just a nice graphical touch (which it is), the RVM becomes an essential piece of tactical equipment when trying to beat the fastest cars to the line. Blocking a rival's line is a staple manouevre, especially when going for the secret cars. "


"computer video games BEELZEBUB HAS A DEVIL PUT ASIDE TRANCE CORE Completing RRR once is easy. We make no pretence about that. But making the most of the game's potential is a much more rewarding process. Check out this long list of extras: TIME Three It would be criminal not to mention the awesome tunes that accompany the race action in RRR. Here is a collection of some of the greatest tracks ever to enrich the gamesplaying experience. Somehow Namco's musicians have taken all the chaos encountered upon walking into a major arcade site, and compressed these types of sounds into incredible 'rave' anthems. Currently JVC are releasing special remixes of RRR tunes on 12\" and CD. But we reckon people would still go for such classics as \"Feeling Over\" as they are heard in game. Tum it up! Turn it UP! PlayStation Super Cars by Etabo 5'00\"765 TIME Back in the February issue, CVG told you about the three secret cars in Japanese version of RRR: 13th Racing, 13th Racing Kid, and the White Angel.

Much has been added to the original formula the basic gameplay is the same, but survival tricks and custom extras are pretty incredible. This is pure video-game thrills all the way, and I guarantee that anybody bowled over by RR1 will fall in love straight away with RRR. Of course it's not the most realistic driving experience that's the whole point! RRR is all about becoming a driving superhero, even if that means performing the impossible as the 360° Spin Points highlight. Plus the music is so over-thetop magnificent, it's impossible not to understand how this is a party-time expe, rience. Only one down point to this story is the UK version displays borders above and below the image, and cars look slightly falttened. Still the SPEED is exactly the same, so why worry. Nail all the aliens in the Galaga '88 load screen, and this 'Super Deformed' (Japanese term for comedy miniatures) version of RRR is accessed. All cars handle differently, and the commentator's voice becomes stupidly high pitched! Complete the Reverse circuits in pole position, and you earn the option to predict the time of day. Usually the lighting fades from bright sunlight to pitch darkness. Here you can freeze time at evening, noon, or nights. A neat trick learned by the Ridge Racer fan base is to perform 360° turns while racing. Whether Namco intended this is uncertain, but they've honoured the tradition by including secret bonus points in Time Trial mode. REVIEW PAU.

Yeh? A dinosaur who fires little coloured gems out of a cannon? No? Oh well. lo the untrained videogaming eye, this might just look like another Puyo Puyo-style puzzle game, only upside down and with a stupid name. But to the whirring cyborg viewing lense of a games expert, it means only one thing Puzzle Bobble 2 has arrived on PlayStation! With a stupid name. Bust-A-Move, you see, is the American title for the game. Why they've called it that over here is a puzzle, (why they've called it that over there is a puzzle too) but hey, we like puzzles. And we like Puzzle Bobble 2. Its multi-coloured gem firing gameplay has already proved hugely addicitve in the arcades, and hopefully it's going to do just as well in the home, provided everyone knows what they're looking for. It's BUST-A-MOVE 2, ya hear! EREDIT CANNON AND BALL! SAVE YOUR TELLY! PUZZLE The average gaming expert might also recognise the two dinosaurs that work your gem-cannon at the bottom of the screen.

The pure gameplay nature of puzzle games has always made them hugely addictive, even when they look as basic as Gameboy Tetris. But it's amazing how much impressive presentation and sound can turn such simple games into magical experiences. Bust-A-Move is one such example. Its briilliant cutesy Japanese graphics, totally crazy tunes and bizarre sound effects convince you that you're playing one of the nuttiest, mind-bending games ever. And all you're doing is firing gems up a screen! That's what makes Bust-A-Move so enjoyable. At first it doesin't even feel like a puzzle game, with aiming seeming more important than lateral thinking, but the more you play, the more you realise how clever it is. Levels can be cleared in record time with skillfully-fired shots, making modes like Time Attack particularly good fun.

THE MONSTER MENU! ep, it's yet another terrifying vision of the future. Only it's worse even than the lawless nightmares depicted in the likes of Escape From New York and Blade Runner. At least in those films the future was exciting. Flying cars, androids, muties living in the sewage system, illegal ring-fights with spiky clubs. That's what we expect from the dark futuropolis that is 30,000AD, motherspankers! Instead though, it seems everything's going to be horribly... normal. Teletext is the main channel, everywhere looks like 'up North', all the shops are shut (that fits into the 'up North' category) and worse, kids speak in American accents. It's scarier even than Dalek Invasion Earth. And that starred Bernard Cribbens. Scream! Perhaps the most horrific part of this future visionfor some people at least is that it all takes place in a point-and-click adventure. Fortunately, if there's one thing the future does hold, it's innovation. Welcome then, to an all-new point-and-click menu system, created, it looks, from some genetic dabbling. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE!

Instead, you can wander fully around your environment, looking at anything you want. These 3D sites are neatly linked by some impressive motion-captured CG intermissions.. It's clear a lot of thought and effort has gone, into Normality. The brilliant FMV opening (matched by plenty of intermissions through out) sets the scene superbly, both in atmosphere and humour. And the surfer-dude, \"Woah, totally like far-out\" humour is amus ing... for a while. Unfortunately it DOES get unfunny. NOT because the jokes get tired, but because they're only funny once. With this style of 'explore-everything-in-the-room' game, you find yourself repeating moves a lot, Hearing Kent exclaim \"it doesn't wanna Open\" in a californian accent for the twelfth (come to that, the fiftieth) time, gets extreme ly grating. Also, the 'normal' scenario lends itself to a rather actionless plot. A shame because the 3D engine is very impressive. In only it'd been used for more than just exploring. Some people will doubtless love this chugging, humorous adventure, but I just found it a bit dull.

It's easy to control just point and click up to a point. Because everything is made up of rendered sequences, it's not possible to go everywhere rather like The 7th Guest, but that's where the comparisons should end. It's not everyone's «thang\", but is still one of best \"interactive movies\" available. EN LOMAS Here's Burgess Meredith.

As new places are learned of, they appear on the map. Everyone in 2040 has access to \"the net\" via a VR headset, and is very useful for getting information if you know where to look.

It's obvious that Tekken 2 is one of the most popular games at the moment, and this PlayStation conversion is incredibly accurate. But the decision on whether or not to buy the game depends very much on your personal opinion of the arcade version. If you're a fan, this is totally essential. For those who aren't so keen on the game, or have never played it before, it's a nennen bit harder to explain. Everyone knows the good things: incredible 3D light-sourced characters, excellent motion-captured animation, atmospheric sounds, awesome music, plenty of moves including counters, 25 playable fighters, and the ability to break legs! What isn't often mentioned is that there are bad things too. I was really looking forward to buying my own copy of the game, so that I could spend ages mastering it to eventually collect all of the boss characters, but I instantly found a bug which meant I collected all of them in under an hour. By holding the Down/Forward diagonal and tapping the Right Kick button it's possible to complete the game in under 4 minutes, even on the hardest setting! This is a ridiculous bug to have left in a game-one which any decent playtester should have found. It makes the one-player STAGEA 02'513 PUSH P2 START mode pretty much redundant to have such a lack of computer intelligence. Another thing which annoys is cucin the lack of balance in some characters. For example, King's incredible multiple-break move, ending in his opponent having all their limbs broken, only does slightly more damage than one punch from Paul! Also, the lack of a decent \"dash\" means that escaping from incoming moves or hopping in for quick strikes isn't really possible, slowing the fights down to a series of attempted combos. To sum up, Tekken 2 PS is an excellent game, and an absolutely incredible conversion, but it loses the magic because of these undeniable faults. I'd feel guilty recommending a game Features such as 'fighter's eyes unconditionally, which I know I won't be playing in a make Tekken 2 undeniably impres. few months' time. ED LOMAS sive.

As Nintendo Of America's Howard Lincoln once commented, DKC raised the 'gold standard' and Prehistorik Man, which a couple of years ago would've been praised as state-of-the-art, just doesn't cut the mustard any more. To be fair, it's not that there's anything exactly wrong with the game, it's just that there's nothing here you haven't seen before and far, far better. The graphics are colourful but unexciting, the music and sound FX are pleasant but unexceptional, and the gameplay is enjoyable but strongly reminiscent of a thousand other Super NES platformers.

The Japanese love him, you know this is his third Super NES outing, and he's also appeared on innumerable NES and Game Boy carts. However, on the evidence presented here it's hard to see quite what our eastern friends see in him. As platformers go Mega Man X3 neither looks or sounds particularly spectacular, and in terms of gameplay it suffers from some serious flaws, most notably the fact that the blue-armoured hero can't duck to avoid enemy shots. And it's tough to boot, boasting a difficulty curve that starts high and then proceeds to shoot right off the top of the graph. Despite this, Mega Man X3 is curiously addictive, in a masochistic I'll-finish-this-if-it-kills-me sort of way if you're looking for a long-lasting challenge, this will suit you down to the ground.

Nonetheless, The Chessmaster 3D has been released in the USA, and it'll probably be released here pretty soon. We're not going to review chess, that'd be stupid, but we can say how well Chessmaster compares to the real thing. Firstly, the graphics are 3D, obviously, meaning that it's almost impossible to see what's going on, as with every other 3D or isometric chess game. The music's nice, but it shifts between techno and classical during the match, which is a strange combination for sure. Also, it's slow. Very slow. At least when you're playing against a human opponent you can hit them until they move. In the end, it'll only be used for two-player games from the plain overhead view, and that's a bit pointless when you can get a real, cheap set without having to get a PlayStation.

The criticisms aimed at Prehistorik Man apply just as well here, with the added problems of poor control (Ardy has a strange 'double jump' that is a pain to master, especially in times of stress) and some vomit-inducingly cute graphics.

However, once the shield is gone the boss releases a barrage of deadly purple plasma spheres that are particularly hard to dodge.

Use berserk to cover the ship surface as you enter the galleon. Things get hectic and you'll have charged it back up by the time you need it again. 4. Do a bit of masking to get these two ships. Although you won't see the lock, when the panel comes down they will already be targetted. PLAYER'S GUIDE EPISODE 6: ATTACK OF THE FLOATING GALLEON 8. ...ignore the two ships and turn to the front to nab the three hoppers that drop out the galleon. The other two ships fly past and be blasted then. 7. The pattern is: 3 ships behind, 3 in front (bottom right), 3 directly in front, 3 turrets on the hull behind, 3 from behind, then 2 ships from behind, however... 6. Getting all the angels here is tough. Use full berserk and it lasts until you leave the ship, strafing all the dropping stones that count on your ratio. 5. Shoot the oar's defences before going for the oars. With the turrets gone, pistol fire the oars to charge your berserk, before finishing with max laser. FLOATING GALLEON, Shoot the shell while it is invulnerable to charge your berserk attack, though you won't need it for this boss, Keep shooting the shell to reveal the mother dragon within, and move in a figure of eight pattern when she starts to fire, to avoid all damage. Only aim at the shell, and this boss should be conquered very quickly indeed. Strangely, the last few hit points always seem to be on the portion of shell left on the mother dragon. "


"computer vided games onu MOTHER DRAGON 1. This method is for a QUICK take down. The Mother dragon comes close to start. If your berserk bar isn't full, use pistol shots. Otherwise, fire lasers. 2. As she turns stay between her tail, firing lasers and berserk attack when the plasma shower starts, so you can stay right where you are. Watch for the fly past. 3. Now you fly at a distance from the mother, and she releases homing projectiles. Zap these with your pistol, as this charges your berserk bar. 4. After another fly by, she fires more projectiles. Use your berserk attack and ignore the projectiles as you'rere invincible. Aim for the mother's head. EPISODE 7: 8. The Mother Dragoon explodes into hundreds of fragments which plummet down! Hurrah! But wait... what's this? Another energy bar? 7. When the Mother's tail starts spinning, she releases pink lasers harder to dodge and more damaging than the darts. Dodge like mad. 6. These blue energy darts are east to dodge, so nip into her path for a few locks when you get the chance. 5. Head to one side of the screen, when the Mother rushes with her tail whiplash, , quickly strafe to the other to avoid the hit. noma GUARDIAN DRAGON 1. Ah! The git who swatted you at the end of episode one. if you die whilst fighting the Guardian Dragon and continue, he will not appear a second time. 2. Just face forward and keep your sight in the centre of the screen for multiple laser locks. If you're low on energy, stay out of his energy stream. 3. Use the figure of eight pattern when he turns and attacks with fireballs. They're easy to avoid, thankfully. After two sweeps, he's off again! 4. He's gone! That's it! You've done it! You're the hero! Now did you get all 100%s? No?!! Well, don't blame us. We've told you everything. IZN21 NONYI 13211 THE END? SEQUENCE ONE After destroying the Mother and Guardian dragon, Randy admires the destruction he has caused, as hundreds of life boat craft fill the skies, evacuating the crashing galleon. While he watches, Randy is suddenly plucked from Lagi by a strange green glowing sphere, and before you know it he's zoomed off through a warp speed time tunnel, being bombarded by a montage of strange and alien images from all sides. When he awakens he is on the ground by the crashed Galleon, and upon venturing inside he discovers a strangely familiar dragon symbol inside the craft's main chamber. WARNING SPOILER! 3 SEQUENCE TWO PLAYER'S GUIDE Riding on the back of the Type 1 dragon, a simipast! Indeed, it transpires that Randy is none between the destruction of the floating galleon lar time warp to the first ending takes place, other than the dragon rider who is killed at the and the destruction of the tower in Panzer one, though this time the images are clear and Randy start of the original Panzer Dragoon, and Lagi is and Randy comes to understand the sacrificial does not return to the present right away.

"computer Video games PADIDAS POWER SOCCER GUIDE ERC 31 We here at CVG thought that the soccer community could do with a little help from our vast gaming knowledge. And what better game to start with than Adidas Power Soccer efore we begin here's a little cheat that allows you to activate a female commentator and her friend: In the audio menu press the SQUARE and CIRCLE buttons at the same time, to activate female commentary. Now, as you play the game, you'll hear Jessica Martin (Spitting Image, Doctor Who) and Sharon Duce (Casualty, The Bill, Buddy's Song) talking among themselves and offering such gems as «Put your knitting down! You're missing the best bits!\" Comedy value only. A number of special techniques can be found in Power Soccer, all of which can be used to devastating effect both on players and the goal net. Let's start with moves that are aimed at burning a hole through your opponent's goal. G0000000AAAAAAALLLLII There are many sneaky techniques used for scoring in Power Soccer, and we're here to enlighten you with some of the more cooler ways of hitting the ball home. Also the best ways on how to avoid your opponent's tackles. THE JUGGLE THE PREDATOR VOLLEY This is the best-looking move in the game, the juggle is performed by pressing the Square and Triangle buttons together upon receiving a high or low ball. If this is performed correctly your player juggles the ball from foot to foot. Once he's finished he performs a Predator kick towards goal. The predator volley is a super fast surprise for your opponents. This is performed by pressing the Triangle and Circle buttons together. As you receive a low ball activate the predator volley to score an amazing goal! THE RUNNING MAN PREDATOR KICK DIVING HEADER No need to explain what this is. Simply press the Cross and Triangle buttons together whilst receiving a low ball to perform this super cool move. The Predator kick is the most powerful move known to man! Press the Triangle and Cross button to unleash a terrifying blast at goal. Any man standing in the way will be knocked down and rendered unconscious for a short time. Strike a few of these at any goalie and he's sure to consider changing his career. Best way to catch up to the ball or an opponent is obviously by running. By pressing the Square and Circle buttons your player goes into overdrive! This is known as the super run. As your player starts sprinting, his energy begins to deplete quite rapidly, so use this sparingly. The best time to use this is when you need to catch other players, or when you are in possession of the ball and need to make a quick getaway. THE BICYCLE KICK THE GOOD OL' FAITHFUL HEADER Another super cool addition to your arsenal of attacks, A Bicycle kick is performed by pressing the Triangle and Cross buttons while receiving a high or medium ball. THE HAND BALL Performing a header is simple: press the square button whilst receiving a high ball and your player will knock the ball either towards the goal or to another player depending on which button you have pressed on the D-pad. To perform a super hard header press the Triangle and Cross button together. The cheapest of moves, but also the most innovative move we've seen in a footy game. Press the Circle and Triangle buttons together when receiving the ball, and watch as your player jumps up and dabbles in a game of volley ball. AVOIDING TACKLES TIPS (ap 1P Once in possession of the ball and running towards the opponent's goal, you'll have to either pass to another player or make a run for it. If you decide to do the latter you'll undoubtedly fall prey to a sliding tackle from the opposing team. To have any chance of making it to the afea you must use the avoid button (Triangle), timing is crucial so be careful, as your opponent runs towards you and starts to drop down, press the avoid button to jump over the tackle. Once you get the timing right you'll be able to jump any tackle that is thrown at you.  "


"TIME 01:16 computer video games 2 23 [PUI NOIX COTEE THAT'S FLICKING MARVELLOUS A To score a really lucky goal perform a power lob (Triangle + Cross buttons and tap back on the DPad) whilst in the centre circle. The ball will either fly straight over the keeper straight in to the goal or the ball will land in front of him, bounce over his head straight in the goal. Another way of avoiding an opponent's tackle is the ball flick. Use the same principle as above but press the Triangle and Circle buttons together. This works just as well, the only difference is you stand to lose the ball much easier because the move takes longer to perform than simply just jumping over a tackle. MOET UND WESTE IP FERER adidas The easiest way to score is to unleash a predator kick when you are half way between the centre circle and your opponents area. The shot is so powerful that if the goalie manages to catch it he'll fall head REE over heels in to the goal. OVER ERE SON 2 PROUDNICS Crossing the ball and heading the ball home is one of the most gratifying ways of scoring. The trick is to cross the ball in whilst running down the side, chip the ball in as soon as you line up with the edge of the area. As the ball floats towards one of your team mates, get ready to perform either one of the headers. If you're feeling really sneaky perform a bicycle kick or predator volley to score an amazing goal, pressing either R2 or L2 will curve the ball as soon a you strike. A Whenever you are in a one-on-one situation with the goalie, perform a Predator kick. The ball will either hit home or knock the goalie over the goal line if he manages to catch it. If the ball bounces off of the keeper, quickly knock it in before he gets on his feet. CPU A The breakaway goal is a simple manoeuvre which leaves your opponents wondering what happened. Throw the ball out to one of your defenders, now pass the ball to a mid-fielder, chip it over to one of the forwards who will now be unmarked. Once in possession of the ball, use the super run to break away, now hit the ball home. TIPS PREDI BIRD FB JE A A cheap way of scoring is to perform a Predator Kick when you're near the five yard line. Even if the keeper gets a hand to it, there's a high chance that you can hit it out of in the net before the keeper manages to get to his feet.

"computer Video games (WOW! 2 BANDA E NONS COOL TOYS ANDA NEW TV SERIES MORPHINOMENAL POWER RANGERS PRIZES! AND MASKED RIDER! elcome fans, to a special CVG feature dedicated to me MASKED RIDER and my friends the POWER RANGERS. Together we make up for some of the coolest entertainment on kids television you might even find that your parents have a secret stash of our programs too -recorded onto video and painstakingly filed in order of episodes. But, hey, I could be wrong... What's that! Wait a minute! Magno tells me somebody's in trouble! I've got to go... enjoy the show! SABAN'S NEW Hot on the blazing trail of Power Rangers, and the not-so-hot VR Troopers, comes Masked Rider another of Saban Entertainment's blend of martial arts extravagance, Japanese-style rubber mon sters, and American High School 'comedy'. You've got to be about seven years old to appreciate the gags, but the action sequences are cool as only Bandai know how especially when it comes to marketing their trademark action figures. Masked Rider is due to air on mainstream TV soon, so we're taking this opportunity to fill you in on some details. KAMEN CROSS-OVER WHEELIN AN'A CHOP SOCKIN' (COMPETITION Though Masked Rider is a new production for the West, its origins lie in a series called Kamen Rider, which first aired in Japan on April 3rd, 1971! The original Kamen Rider (literally: Masked Rider) centered around an average bloke who was transformed into a Cyborg by an evil alien syndicate. Unlike Saban's interpretation, there was more than one Kamen Rider, all of whom had super powers based on those of a locust and grasshopper. Like the Power Rangers (lifted from the Zu Ranger series in Japan), the Riders in human form all wear belts, and shout \"Henshin!\" (Transform!) before 'morphing' into their heroic counterparts! Of course the make or break factor with Masked Rider is how the action sequences shape up. Well. it seems we're in for an exciting ride literally. Dex has a motorbike named Chopper which TALKS and a slick red car named Magno which ALSO TALKS. Incidentally, Bandai tell us that Magno shares the same designer as the classic 1960'S Batmobile, and the Munsters' car among others: a man named Geroge Barris. We've already seen Chopper tackle a Giant Beetle, and Magno who's female -come to Dex's rescue. So far they're not much of a match for the Zords, but Dex's fighting skills, especially with his light sword, are definitely worthy of applause. Anyway, that's too much already on transportation. What you really need to know is how all this craziness hangs together. Cue next box: CONSIDER YOURSELF AT HOME A message to those expecting a tragic display of outdated special effects: FEAR NOT! Kamen Rider is such a popular, long-running series in Japan, that Saban have been able to take cuts from the 1989 Kamen Rider Black RX episodes regarded by those who have nothing else to worry about as being the best in the series. The plot is predictably flimsy, but so what: Our hero is a boy named Dex, actually make that an alien Prince from the planet Edenoi, sent to Earth on a mercy mission. Our beloved home is under threat from the evil of Count Dregon and his cronies, so Dex's grandfather and Ben Kinobi look-a-like King Lexion volunteered his off-spring for the job of defending us. Remember ALF (Alien Life Form)? Well, Dex crash-lands in somebody's backyard too belonging to the Stewart family who adopt Dex as one of their own. Oh, you're from outer-space how interesting? Pass the mayonnaise, would you? 102 "

"computer video games IM RED DEPT.2 ARIAVE FIGHTING GAME BY AM2 AUGUST RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS Take a good long look at these two pages, because you're staring at the next evolutionary leapfrog in video game technology. Even more incredible you'll be able to experience it by the end of the year!  HOME VERSIONS RUMOURED  DISTRIBUTED BY SEGA MODEL 3 ARCADE BOARD  STAND UP CABINET THE MOST INCREDIBLE COIN-OP EVER! Frans JE! hen AM2 announced the development of Virtua Fighter 3, it was hard to imagine how much better it could look than Virtua Fighter 2a game which is still the most visually amazing arcade game around. But when VF3 was unveiled in demo form at the AOU Amusement Expo in Makuhari Messe on February 21st, it exceeded all expectations. People who have seen Virtua Fighter 3 moving do not, cannot believe it's actually a game they're looking at. Head of AM2, Yu Suzuki, promised it would match the graphical brilliance of the Virtua Fighter 2 CG portrait series, and he's right. Gone are any unnatural polygon edges, gone is the impression of animated dolls all replaced by super-smooth, superrealistic graphics akin to the most impressive movie special effects. Virtua Fighter 3 looks like nothing that has gone before! THE NOW-MYTHICAL AOU DEMO!! MODE A RCADE The eight-minute demo displayed at the AOU (and also the Orlando ACME show) revealed six regular VF characters Lau, Jacky, Pai, Jeffry and Dural plus one of the two planned new fighters a traditional Japanese female called Aoi Umenokouji. More than a demonstration of what VF3 holds though, it was primarily a showcase for Sega's new Model 3 arcade board. As such, the game is set to undergo a number of alterations before it emerges in its final form. As Yu Suzuki explains, \"The quality of the graphics will be further developed. So we can do better than the show version.\" As such the look of the characters may change. \"We'll change the costumes if we can make better ones.\" says Mr Suzuki. The backdrops also, are not finalised. \"None of them will go straight into VF3 as they are, but some will have the same image.\" continues Mr Suzuki. When asked if there was anymore news since the show, he replied «None for the time being. I am now concentrating on the development of even better things to show.\" He did however, have this to say, \"I'm not sure what will develop, but if people play VF3 they'll lose interest in VF2.\" Supposedly, no texture-mapping was used to create the fighters. Model 3 can mould nontextured shapes to create any shape required. Dural's dramatic morphing appearance. A demonstration of effects that rival those of T2. B "


"AOI UMENOKOUJI! The newly revealed VF3 character looks incredible, primarily due to the way her traditional Japanese costume moves. Mr Suzuki explains they had to make sure her moves worked with the flapping of her huge kimono sleeves. «Without this, we had no interest in creating Aoi.\" There were around three or four other possible characters, but to bring a full selection of new techniques to the game, Aoi was chosen. Using a custom combination of aikido and judo, she excels in counter attacks and parrying moves similar to Akira's 'surprise exchange'. AM RAD DEPT.2 NEW CHARACTER 4 EWE Aou performs a counter attack on Jacky, with her back to him. An all-new VF3 technique? JEFFRY MCWILD! THE MOST INCREDIBLE COIN-OP EVER! lis All the characters revealed at the show caused astonishment, but only one Jeffry brought on fits of laughter from those assembled. Performing his finishing pose, his muscles rippled and exanded realistically. Amusing as this looked, it more importantly gave clues to the as yet unrevealed second new character a wrestler known only as 'the plump man'. Yu Suzuki has said that the Model 3 board's capabilities are necessary to create the movement of this character's flabby body. But he adds, \"It may look similar, but there is a difference between muscles and fat.\" S: 1131 BRYANT! AACHANI Performing moves familiar to his fans a spinPai appeared on an underground platform. ning back knuckle and double roundhouse for Could it be the Bryant's new Chicago stage? example Jacky's appearance is massively improved. His new red and black jacket, still with the fire emblem on the back, flapped about as he spun around, and the individual strands of his spiky hair were visible. He also looked unusually moody, but as AM2 explain, \"His appearance on the Sarah (VF1) stage was well received, so we tried to light him up from below. His image will be 'cool'.\" The stage that Jacky appeared on showcased an amazing transparent glass floor, complete with light reflections. Dressed in white, Pai's embroidered costume effectively shows Model 3's shifting and warping abilities. The material looks real. The facial details are amazing. All the characters' eyes rove about, watching their opponent. OH The costumes aren't finalised, but AM2 Jacky's jacket flapping about in mid-spin. say they may do away with the distinction The movement is utterly realistic. He also between 1P and 2P costumes. We hope not. performs Bruce Lee-style nose-scratching. It's unclear where the ring edge, if at all, would be on Jeffry's South Sea Island stage. Perhaps you fight into the sea? 105 "


"computer video games DURAL! The robot boss from the previous VF games made a startling appearance on the demo. Whereas before Dural was the most visually basic fighter, this time she is by far the most amazing, demonstrating the Model 3 board's warping and reflective capabilities fully. Just like the T1000, she morphes up like mercury from the metal floor. This though, is not what she's going to be like in the game. «There's no great significance in this.\" explains Mr Suzuki, \"We simply thought this scene would amaze people.\" AM RSD DEPT.2 SOBRE LAU CHAN NEW TECHNIQUES? THE MOST INCREDIBLE COIN-OP EVER! Lau performs the incredible move that could well be a new technique for VF3. Perhaps each stage will feature interactive surroundings that allow for specialised moves. The big question over VF3 is as to what new techniques will appear. From the demo some clues were given. Similar to Fighting Vipers, it seems that failing to grab with a throw may now leave you frozen and vulnerable to a counter. Also, all the characters demonstrated the ability to evade sideways a feat only Shun and Lion could previously perform. In fact, free movement into and out of the screen may now be fully utilised. Something that may prove essential with the more dramatic camera angles AM2 wish to employ, and the possible removal of the 'ring' altogether... AM2 PLAY THE GAME! ARCADE NEXT MONTH... Lau's appearance took place on a courtyard set below a castle. This is eventually to be kagemaru's level. Most interestingly though, it was surrounded by walls, which at one point Kage actually used for a move. Grabbing hold of Pai's head, he leapt onto the wall and threw her from there. When questioned about this Mr Suzuki answered \" There will be new fighting techniques. I don't know yet if there will be a scene with a wall on all sides. At the moment the thinking is, if there is a wall, there will be a technique using the wall.\" Just to prove to the punters that what they saw on screen was the real thing, AM2 briefly put the game on demo play at the show. Although they controlled the characters themselves, it was clear everything was happening in realtime and that VF3 contains a lot of never before seen features. Whilst the AOU show demo gave a taster of Virtua Fighter 3, behind the scenes the game is already playable with a summer release in Japan still on the cards. With the Los Angeles E3 happening this month, we hope to bring you much more on this ground-breaking work next issue Perhaps even pictures of finalised game action... 106 "

Enter the VF Kids! CHAMPION & WINS CHALLENGER CHALLENGER 29.87 0464 Serock The idea might sound lame. A revamp on Virtua Fighter 2, but with big-headed kid' versions of the characters battling on cute backdrops. But there's far more to VF Kids, causing it to be one of the most talked about upcoming games in our office. For a start, it's on the ST-V board, meaning a perfect Saturn version is guaranteed. Secondly, it promises a number of brilliant refinements to the Virtua Fighter 2 formula. Refinements that have actually been taken onboard the VF3 project. And finally, AM2 are advertising it as superior to VF2. In their own words \"It's a speed battle game far better than Virtua Fighter 2!\" What's more, the characters look totally wicked! JAYA HH EXCITING CAMERA ANGLESI PRODUCT PLACEMENTI This is something AM2 have perfected for use in VF3, but VF Kids gets it first. For instance, when Wolf performs his spinning throw, instead of viewing it from one angle (as in VF2), you get to see him from the front with the backdrop spinning past behind. Plus, there are Fighting Vipers style dynamic replays of particularly exciting attacks. As a result, VF Kids has far more moves that send opponents flying! You just can't get away from it. The Japanese version of Fighting Vipers had the Pepsi logo on Picky's board, VF kids has yet more advertising for real Japanese products. When Jacky wins a fight, he pulls out a can of Java Tea. And Shun swigs from a can of Java Tea A It's a soft drink, instead of his saki bottle. Perhaps it's because but it gets him he's now underage! Also there's an all-new sloshed.

Obviously thirsty work all this fighting. SUPERIOR TO VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 THEY'RE AT AN EMOTIONAL AGEI VF Kids adds far more life to the fighters than was evident in VF2. Apart from wincing when hit, they now display more emotion. All the characters are joyful when picked to fight (except Shun who looks angry). Jeffry who in early versions looked fierce is so happy he looks tearful. His eyes also go watery when he pulls his winning pose. And Kage's eyes now glint when his throws are successful. A Pained faces when they're hit. You can see Kage's scar easily. Jeffry has a strange tearful look. HEAVY HEADSI The new Pai vs Pai stage! There's also a Shun-factory for the Shun vs Shun stage. Could be, that there's new backdrops for all the same character stages. I  ARCADE 90 IPLETEI L6.5th The big heads are more than just a cosmetic change, they actually affect the way the game plays. For instance, when ducking to avoid an upper attack, the fighters have to lean back, as their heads are just too big to avoid it otherwise. It also seems, the heads are going to be 'heavy', perhaps adding centrifugal force to such moves as Wolf's spinning throw. And Kage's crown is easier than ever to knock off. After all, how could you miss a head that big? 6-85p 5.5thu. to. 35503 By the time you read this, VF Kids should be finished and running in Japanese arcades, with it hopeful. ly appearing here soon.

Last month we revealed that Mr Naka Yuji has reassembled his Sonic Team in preparation for a Saturn Sonic game. First though, they have something else completely amazing lined up. With Nights, Sonic Team had just one objective to create a game that successfully replicates the sensation of flying free from the constraints of a flying machine! The result is one of the most impressive and innovative 3D games we've ever seen. Nights is set in a dreamworld, between nightmares and good dreams. It follows the adventures of two kids who, troubled in their waking hours, journey to this land of their subconscious when asleep. It might sound deep, and in fact. Sonic Team studied the work of dream psychologists, Frederick Holtz and Jung to create a genuine dreamscape. However, don't be fooled by the big words it's still the most exhilarating. addictive, character game we've seen since... Sonic! ELLIOT NEW GAMES SONIC TEAM'S FIRST NCREDIBLE SATURN GAME!

These are the two main characters whose dreams make up the levels. They are both unaware of the other and each have their own set of levels. Whether you have to play as both of them, or if they eventually come together, is so far unclear.

SA Created by the game's main villain known as the Wiseman, Nights hero of nightmares is the key to the game. Once Elliot or Claris find Nights, they merge with him. Now you can control Nights and take to the skies! Controlling Nights is much like steering Ecco the Dolphin. He can perform loop-the-loops and barrel rolls. SONIC TEAM'S FIRST NCREDIBLE SATURN GAME! 1 Flying in the right direction is not as difficult as it may look. As in a Sonic game, there's always a neat route through the level. Nights does weave in and out of the screen. Controlwise though, you only have to steer him left or right. If he can curve around an object, he will! + You can only control Nights for a limited time, during which you have to collect as many balls as possible. These have to be dropped off at a special temple. 1 Once the time runs out, Nights vanishes, sending your character plunging to the ground. Any balls you haven't cashed in, scatter! BOSSES NIGHTMARIANS The evil folk from Nightmare. The word 'badnik' springs to mind. NIGHTOPIANS There were only two bosses in the early version of Nights we saw. They were however, more impres sive than any we've seen before, save perhaps the very best of Panzer Dragoon Zwel! The good people of Nightopia, they look just like the coneheads from the Japanese Saturn campaign. COLORES NEXT MONTH...DREAM ON! This amazing dragon is the only other boss so far revealed. The huge translucent galaxy that fills the sky is fantastic. Unfortunately you can't see it! We've barely scratched the surface of this magical game here.

VIPER NEW GAMES FORMAT: PLAYSTATION, SATURN, AND PC CD-ROM AIR COMBAT BY: NEON 1 PLAYER DUE: SEPTEMBER One thing's for sure Viper is one hell of an impressive demo. It features a magnificent-looking militarystyle helicopter, fully controllable through 360 degrees in the midst of a future cityscape. In Viper's present state players can climb, dive, bank, and turn the copter within a small sector of this city. The response is quick, and the sensation exhilarating. Joining the chopper in the night sky is a huge aircraft which has the appearance of a WWII Wellington Bomber. In this demo the bomber does nothing except look quite awesome. The only other activity comes from small, unidentifiable aircraft which explode spectacularly when targeted by the heli's missiles. In fact if there's one thing that strikes you the most about the Viper demo, it's the pyrotechnics especially the shockwaves. Along with Tunnel B1, Neon are certainly working their much touted 3D engine to the max. We can't wait for the games to happen.

Up to eight players may select a car to race, around locations varying from dusty desert (without the dust), to a serene underwater scene complete with fish if memory serves correctly. In keeping with Micro Machines tradition, each of the 10 new locales require a different vehicle, so expect to see submarines, magic carpets, and even skis in the finished game. Cool. We're also promised loads of secret bonuses and hidden levels to discover. So long as it plays the same as MM2 or better, that's all that matters. More soon. 110 "

Many importers have been quick to order their batches of chips, which arrive complete with instructions on how to install KONAMI them. What's more, they're cheap. Very cheap.

N64-STYLE I CONTROLLER FOR SATURN Contents Sega's enthusiasm for matching Nintendo's 64-bit machine blow for blow has resulted in the company announcing its own analogue controller for the Saturn. No doubt to coincide with the worldwide release of Nights this September. Rumours are already flying on the internet as to how this new peripheral might look, along with the types of games that might become available in the future. Ahh... you can't beat a bit of healthy speculation. Back in reality though, a home version of the entire MEGA LO control panel is now available in Japan. It's full-size, two-player, and incorporates two eight microswitched buttons (six plus the shoulder buttons) on each side, and two joysticks. Told you: Japan loves the Saturn. What next an AS-1?! BUT DO SEGA LOVE REALLY LOVE YOU...? Some people may not feel so sure. If you own any of the following, prepare for some really crappy news: Mega-CD 32X Game Gear Right. They've all been dropped. Which means no more software support for any of those Sega systems. From now on Sega are concentrating on the Pico (their children's computer), Mega Drive and...um...er... that other one. Saturn! Well, at least this means they now have a leaner and meaner operation to combat Nintendo and Sony in the months to come.

You must return to timing combos as in Super SF II Turbo. Try to link a low Strong into a low Forward, then two-in-one into a regular or super fireball. By Slasher Quan ARCADE GUIDE CHUN-LI COLOUR SELECTIONS There are four different colours available for each character. These are achieved by pressing one punch, one kick, Jab+Strong punch, or Short+Forward kick respectively when you choose your character. player boss fights, are also selectable! When you Join in, press Start and continue to hold down the Start button. Move the cursor to either Sagat or Bison, wait five seconds, then choose your char acter normally. You will be transported to the appropriate hidden stage!

The method is the same as before: block any attack, then press A,DA,D, and Punch or Kick. DEFAULT TO PREVIOUS STAGE This method enables you to fight on the stage of the previously defeated opponent. Press Start and continue to hold it down, then choose your fighter without hesitation. If appropriate, you will fight on the stage of whichever character was just beaten off the machine! Special note: All stage select codes work only in two-player matches. SECRET CODES SECRET BOSS FIGHTS Original Costume Chun Li: When you join in, press Start and continue to hold down the Start button. Move the cursor on top of Chun Li, wait five seconds, then pick her. She will appear in her original costume from the Street Fighter II series, and her fireball will be restored to its original Charge execution. (She even has four different colours for this costume, like all other characters! Overall Strategy Chun Li is the most-improved character in Alpha 2, and possibly the #1 character in the whole game. She can now two-in-one her low Forward into a Fireball, and the ability to do her Fireball as a motion instead of a charge move adds a whole new dynamic to her gameplay. Try to poke at the enemy with her low Forward and jumping Short, and keep out the enemy with standing Fierce and Roundhouse. Her Super ener gy is best utilised as Custom Combos involving the Lightning Leg or Rising Bird Kick. Hidden Challengers! In a one-player game each character can fight a special bonus opponent, who will interrupt the normal schedule of enemies with a \"Here Comes a New Challenger\" message, in much the way that Dan would challenge in original SFA. The secret to finding these hidden challengers is to win as many times as possible with a Super Combo or Custom Combo finish. By winning five rounds in a row in this manner without interruption, by winning in any other manner, or by losing a roundyou will find the hidden challenger! No specific reward (such as a better ending) is yet known for defeating the hidden challengers, but you will be treated to some entertaining dialogue when you first encounter them.

Then choose your character normally and you will be transported to the selected stage! CHARLIE FREEPLAY SECRET STAGE SELECTION THE SPECIAL AKUMA FIGHT If you win with three Perfect round finishes in a row, Akuma will challenge you...but not the normal Akuma! This is the Akuma as he appeared in SSF II Turbo; he throws TWO air fireballs and is hellishly fast. Good luck, he is a monster! Move List Sonic Boom: Charge A,T, AP Somersault Shell: Charge D,U, AK Spinning Back-Knuckle: T + Fierce Step Kick: T or A + Roundhouse Top-Down Kick: T or A + Forward Sonic Break: Charge A,TA,T, AP, then press AP Somersault Justice: Charge DA,DT,DA,UT, AK Crossfire Blitz: Charge A,TA,T, AK Sagat's and Bisons hidden stages Australia and Venezuela, which normally appear during certain one12 "


"2240 UTER computer video games ADON Overall Strategy A slightly quicker recovery time off Sonic Booms places Charlie in a much better position to keep out enemies and lock them down with patterns. Use his crouching and standing Fierce (depending on the angle of their jump) to easily swat away those who jump your Sonic Booms. In Custom Combos, Charlie's Somersault Shell can be especially devastating juggle the enemy with it for huge damage. and not a combo, is his only remaining chain. He also can no longer two-in-one a standing Forward into the Bushin Air Throw, a major cheap he relied on. Guy has gone from among the top three characters to possibly among the bottom six. Move List Rising Jaguar: T,D,DT, AK Jaguar Kick: D,DT,T, AK Jaguar Tooth: D,DA,A, AK Top-Down Punch: T + Strong Jutting Kick: DT + Forward Jaguar Revolver: D,DA,A,D,DA,A, AK Jaguar Varied Assault: D,DT,T,D,DT, AP Overall Strategy Roses strategy hasn't changed much, be the addition of the Soul Cloak move enables her to more effectively pin down opponents, especially because she is not vulnerable if they block it. Rose can no longer multi-slide and redizzy the opponent, but her Level 2 Aura Soul Spark is probably still her most effective Super in terms of range and proportionate damage. BIRDIE KEN SAGAT Move List Sliding Roll: D,DT,T, Start Roll: D,DA,A, AP Fireball: D.DT,T, AP Hurricane Kick: D,DA,A, AK Air Hurricane Kick: Jump then D,DA,A, AK Top-Down Kick: T + Forward Shoryu Reppa: D,DT,T,D,DT AP Shinryuken: D,DT,T,D,DT AK then AK rapidly (L2 or L3) Move List Flaming Bull Head: Charge A,T, AP Bull Horn: Hold 2P or 2K then release Murderer Chain: 360, AP Choke Swing: 360, AK Top-Down Kick: standing Roundhouse Bull Revenger: D,DT,T,D,DT, AP or AK The Birdie: Charge A,T,A,T, AP Overall Strategy Generally Adon is much easier to play now that his Jaguar Kick and Tooth are fireball motions. His Top-Down Punch is a sorely needed addition and should be interchanged with the Jaguar Tooth to confuse getting up opponents. Unfortunately his Jaguar Varied Assault has been sorely weakened and is not as fast or long-reaching as before; only use it at point-blank range. Move List Tiger Shot: D,DT,T, AP Ground Tiger Shot: D,DT,T, AK Tiger Blow: T,D,DT, AP Tiger Crush: T,D,DT, AK Tiger Cannon: D,DT,T,D,DT,T, AP Tiger Genocide: D,DT,T,D,DT, AK Tiger Raid: D,DA,A,D,DA,A, AK ROSE Overall Strategy Adding a longer pause after the Bull Head is a poor trade for flames, but Birdie had to be weakened...I guess. His new Choke Swing is extremely damaging, cheap, and much easier to do off the standing Short then the Murderer Chain; try to cheap grab opponents with it as much as possible. The Bull Revenger should still be the primary use of super energy, whether to fly over fireballs or to pass invincibly through descending air attacks and grab Jumpers as they land. Move List Soul Spark: A,DA,D,DT,T, AP Soul Reflect: D,DA,A, AP Soul Throw: T,D,DT, AP Soul Cloak: DDT,T, AK Slide: DT + Forward Aura Soul Spark: D,DA,A,D,DA,A, Overall Strategy Like Ryu, Ken is generally unchanged but he can no longer rely on devastating chain combos. His Flaming Dragon Punch is quite effective in Custom Combos, inflicting tons of juggle damage if the timing is accurate. Ken is also bereft of his humiliating, perpetual Roll Trap due to the removal of chains, but Roll/throw is still a great cheap to pull out occasionally. Overall Strategy Despite Sagat's low to middling ranking in Alpha 1, Capcom chose to weaken this character In several aspects. His low Forward can no longer two-in-one into a special move (it can, however, two-in-one into a Super, which is a very devastating combo when the opponents getting up). Also, the Tiger Genocide is far less invincible to fireballs. If you pick him, use the traditional standing Roundhouse, standing Strong, and standing Fierce to keep the opponent out...and pray. AP Aura Soul Throw: D,DT,T,D,DT, AP Soul Ilusion: D,DT,T,D,DT, AK ARCADE GUIDE SODOM GUY Move List Dash Elbow: D,DA,A, AP Bushin Air Throw: D,DT,T, AP, then P (close) Bushin Air Elbow: DDT,T, AP, then P (far) Bushin Hurricane Kick: D,DA,A, Move List Jigoku Scrape: DDT,T, AP Butsumetsu Buster: 360, AP Daikyo Burning: 360, AK Counter Grab: T,D,DT, AK Super Roll: After knocked down press T,DT,D, AP Jitte Walk: After knocked down press A,DA,D, AK Super Rushing Jigoku: D,DT,T,D,DT,T, AP Omega Slam: 720, AP AK Bushin Dash Stop: D,DT,T, Short then AK Bushin Dash Slide: D,DT,T, Forward then AK Bushin Dash Crescent Kick: D,DT,T, Roundhouse then AK Strong Elbow Drop: While in the air press D + Strong Typhoon: DT + Roundhouse Top-Down Punch: T + Strong Bushin Hell Chain Fist: standing Jab, Strong, Fierce, Roundhouse Bushin Strong Thunder Kick: D.DT,T,D,DT, AK Bushin Eight-Double Fist: D,DT,T,D,DT, AP Overall Strategy The change of Sodom's Jigoku Scrape from a dragon punch to a fireball motion drastically alters his strategy. Use an early crouching Fierce two-in-one into a Fierce Scrape for an insanely easy, two-hit combo as the opponent is getting up. Also, Sodom's Counter Grab is NOT a fake, its a counter-attack that reverses any airborne or shoulder-level attacks...do it just as a leg or foot is about to connect. FREEPLAY Overall Strategy As the most chain-reliant veteran of Alpha 1, Guy is the most weakened (call it crippled) in A2... His Bushin Hell Chain Fist, which Capcom considers a move 13 "


"mputer ideo ames M. BISON DAN ROLENTO Move List Psycho Shot: Charge A,T, AP Double Knee Press: Charge A,T, AK Head Press: Charge D,U, AK, then AP for Skull Diver Somersault Skull Diver: Charge D,U, AP, then AP for Skull Diver Bison Warp: T,D,DT or A,D,DA, 3P or  Knee Press Nightmare: Charge A,T,A,T, AK Psycho Crusher: Charge A,T,A,T, Move List Self-Taught Wave Punch: D,DT,T, AP Shiny Dragon Punch: T,D,DT, AP Flurry Kick: D,DA,A, AK Super Wave Punch: D,DT,T,D,DT,T AP Super Shiny Dragon Punch: D,DT,T,D,DT, AK Certain Victory: D,DA,A,D,DA,A, AK Super Taunt: D,DT,T,D,DT,T, Start Move List Patriot Circle: D,DT,T, AP (repeat X 3) Air Knife: T,D,DT, AK then AK or AP Flip Attack: D,DT,T,UT, AP or AK then any button Flip Away: D,DA,A,UA, AP or AK Wall Leap: D,DA,A, AK then any button Roll Rebound: D,DA,A, AP then AP irge Forward Hurricane Kicks to lock down the opponent, and the Roundhouse Hurricane to stop jumpers. Pull out the Super Slide Kick to override ground moves. Don't use the Running Dragon Punch unless you're sure it will connect, because if they block you will be open to almost any Super or Custom Combo. Hold away and use her standing Forward, or her crouching Fierce, to keep out jumpers. AP AP Fip/Roll Recoil: 3P then AP Super Chain Grab: D,DT,T,D,DT,T, AK Rolling Grenade: D,DA,A,D,DA,A, GEN AP Move List CRANE METHOD (3P) Overall Strategy Bisons only new addition is an air throw with the Strong or Fierce Punch. Otherwise he is generally the same.... Always use the Psycho Crusher instead of the knee Press Nightmare when the opponents jumping, and plant plenty of Fierces into any Custom Combos. Overall Strategy Dan benefits from a number of redrawn animations for his basic attacks and special moves, but generally didn't gain much to beef up his arsenal...some of his moves are actually much worse, such as his delayed-reaction jumping fierce. His most exciting addition is the Super Taunt, the first Super move to, well, involve the use of taunts! (And the Start button...) What a fart knocker! Fast Hands: Tap AP rapidly Rising Kick: T,D,DT, AK Super Dashing Swipe: D,DT,T,D,DT,T, AP Hand of Death: D,DA,A,D,DA,A, AP AKUMA Overall Strategy Rolento seems to be the most effective new character and can devastate opponents with his huge variety of attacks. By alternating between his different flip, wall leap, and roll attacks, you can keep any opponent confused and psyched out. Use the Rolling Grenade to juggle jumping enemies, and Super Chain Grab to maul ground-based opponents who are about to do a move. End his Custom Combos with 3 Patriot Circles for huge damage. MANTIS METHOD (3K) ZANGIEF ARCADE GUIDE Move List Blue Fireball: D,DT,T, AP Red Fireball: T.DT,D,DA,A, AP Dragon Punch: T,D,DT, AP Hurricane Kick: D,DA,A, AK Air Hurricane Kick: Jump then press D,DA,A, AK Ashura Warp: T,D,DT or A,D,DA, 3P or 3K Hundred Demon Somersault: D.DT,T,UT, then....

Super Air Throw: D,DT,T,D,DT, AK Flying Air Kick: Jump then press D,DA,A,D,DA,A, AK Move List Small Fireball: D,DT,T, AP Medium Fireball: D,DT,T, tap AP 2x Large Fireball: D.DT,T, tap AP 3x Running Dragon Punch: T,D,DT, AP Hurricane Kick: D,DA,A, AK Top-Down Kick: T + Forward Super Slide Kick: D,DA,A,D,DA,A, AK Super Fireball: D,DT,T,D,DT,T, AP Super Dragon Punch: D,DT,T,D,DT, Overall Strategy Zangief is not the same as he was in SSF II Turbo, and while there are a few improvements there are also some major new weaknesses. His Spinning Pile Driver has positively minuscule range; forget sucking in enemies from over 1/4 screen distance! He can still cheap, but only in close. You can alter some of Zangief's crouching kicks by holding either in defensive or offensive crouch. Use his standing Roundhouse to keep out jumping opponents. Overall Strategy Gen is possibly the most complex SF character and the best way to play him is to learn each opponent and decide whether Crane or Mantis is most appropriate in each case. Gen is generally a tick type character, and you can wear them down with moves such as the Rolling Attack and Fast Hands. When your Hand of Death connects, simply avoid getting hit by the opponent until the timer runs out and they'll be dizzied. AK AP Messatsu Fireball: T,DT,D,DA,A,T,DT,D,DA,A, AP Violent Air Slash: Jump then press D,DT,T,D,DT,T, AP Instant Hell Murder (L3): Jab Jab,T,Short Fierce Overall Strategy Sakura's only decent two-in-oneable move is her crouching Strong, so centre all your combos around it. Use her Short and DHALSIM Overall Strategy The change of his Red Fireballs motion is a great addition which greatly increases his playability. as there is no more overlap between the moves. If only his Messatsu Fireball were easier! A significant delay has been added to his Air Fireballs (they are now released a moment after the command is inputted), so be careful of ground opponents who can use basic attacks to keep you out if you throw the Air Fireballs too close to the ground. His Instant Hell Murder now requires an extra button (identical to the home versions of A1) and is quite hard to do in a pinch. Move List Yoga Fire: D,DT,T, AP Yoga Flame: T.DT.D.DA.A. AP Yoga Thrust: T,DT,D,DA,A, AK Yoga Teleport: T,D,DT or A,D,DA, 3P or 3K (can be done in air) Top-Down Punch: Hold Jab, release Yoga Burn: D,DT,T,D,DT,T, AP Super Air Throw: D,DT,T,D,DT, AK FREEPLAY Overall Strategy As in SSF II Turbo Dhalsim can control the usage of his limbs (close or far attacks) by holding away or neutral/toward on the joystick. His main strategy involves keeping out the enemy with fireball/kick patterns, sliding under fireballs, and using the Yoga Burn for huge damage. His Super Air Throw, for all intents and purposes, is identical to Roses and Zangief's. 14 "
