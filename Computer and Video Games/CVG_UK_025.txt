Unfortunately the manual supplied is rather lacking in information to do with the ports B001 and B002. I would be obliged if you could tell me about a book which could give me more information about the aforementioned ports. R. D. Melville, Co. Down, N. Ireland Editor's reply: One book I know of that contains details of the Atom ports is the Atom Magic Book by Timedata. This contains details of the ports at B000, B001 and B002. It also contains useful information on the VIA and various zero-page and ROM addresses useful for machine-code programming. Basically, the ports at B000 to B002 are used by the keyboard, cassette 10 and controls the graphics mode. The circuit diagram should help with decoding the functions of each bit, since PA, to PA, are at B000, PB, to PB, are at B001 and PCo to PC, are at B002. These should be marked on the circuit diagram. The 7445 chip is a binary to decimal converter, so that when a binary input is applied to it, only one output goes low. This is used for selecting the correct row of keys to be read. The column is read using port B (at B001). e.g. to read the \"I\" key, then the following Basic line would be used. ? #B000 = 9;IF? #B001&16 = OTHEN... Note that nits 4 to 7 of part A are used to control graphics, so the above line would reset the Atom to text mode. To leave the Atom in graphics mode, the '9' should be replaced by \"#x9 where 'X' can be found by referring to page 88 of the manual. We hope that helps you Mr. Melville! PRAISE FOR C-TECH.

And what's a Pass-Me when it's at home, I hear you ask. Well, it's a game that will test your skills of response and deduction to the full — and it talks too! Pass-Me is a bit like those Simon games except instead of flashing lights it has a voice and numbered handles. The games you can play with a PassMe are many and varied. Too varied to explain here in full! But they will keep you and your friends guessing for hours on end. Just the thing for Christmas The competition produced a splendid crop of entries and included some well written computer programs. One or two high scoring readers failed to absorb the small print and either used a digit more than twice or scored points for factors greater than 99. There were eight top score entries who spotted, as did young Stubbs at school, that the six numbers did not have to be different. So, by finding the three highest scoring numbers, which had three different digits each, using each number twice produced the desired result. Commiserations to those who scored high but were not lucky in the draw from the postbag. parties. You won't be able to pass up a Pass-Me! Just turn to our competition pages and solve Trevor's latest brain twister, send in your answer and a Pass-Me could be yours. Don't forget we've got five to give away so enter today! PARDON?

Yes, you can actually upgrade the chips and the Chess cartridge to keep up with the state of the art in the rapidly developing world of Chess computers. The Ambassador has 10 skill levels from beginner to expert and also has two analysis levels useful if you play correspondence Chess or for solving Chess problems. The Ambassador is extremely easy to use. The pieces are moved in the conventional manner on the board. There is no keyboard to type in moves on, or tiny screen to squint at all of which enhances play. The board registers each move using its automatic sensory capabilities. All this and it looks attractive too with the classic Chess board design in inlaid mahogany and rosewood. And all this can be yours if you win our latest competition!

There are 20 sections of a maze and lurking in each one are the traditional resident ghosts and ghouls. In each maze are four coloured doors, each colour corresponding to four coloured keys hanging at the very top of the screen in section one. You take the part of a key — whose job is to travel to the twentieth section of the maze unlocking the door to each new section on the way. To open the doors you have to guide your key to the four other keys at the top of the screen and select a colour. Your key will then take on this colour and you can move off to try the door. If it is a dud, make your way back to the top and chose another one. This may sound easy but there is an added hazard. Ghosts which try their best to capture you! In section two of the maze you will find not one ghost but two and so on throughout the game.

"BORED WITH BL Give your trigger finger a rest and take a look at an in space. We look at a game that existed long before You don't have to spend all your BY JONATHAN CALDER ram and their micro-processor in a detachable cartridge. This means that the owner can take advantage of any developments in chess programming or micro-chip technology at a fraction of the cost of a new chess computer. All he has to do is buy a new cartridge as and when he feels inclined in order to keep fully up to date with developments. You should certainly look for this comprehensive updatability in any machine you buy it will save you money. If then you're buying a machine to last in effect a lifetime then you really ought to be thinking of its appearance too. You want a machine that can happily be out on display in the home, almost as part of the furniture, and not a Heath Robinson version that has to be hidden away whenever you've finished playing with it. This points you towards a chess computer finished in wood rather than one of the \"high-tech\" machines. After all, nowadays, there is no need to let everybody know you are a computer freak, computers in the home are no longer remarkable. Not only should you look for a computer that is good to look at, you also should seek one that is easy to play with. The best sort of computers are the fully automatically sensory ones. You simply pick up a piece and move it in the normal chess way. The computer senses automatically which square you have moved your piece from and to. These have no squares to push down; no buttons to press, or keys to punch. Anything less than this ideal arrangement is likely to become unnecessarily irksome and tedious over the years. There are a number of very cheap machines on the market, some of them costing as little as -, but if you're thinking of getting one of these you should be clear what you would be buying. These are executive toys, either suitable for beginners or as an ideal thing for long flights, but they have little to offer the more serious minded chess player. To get a good chess computer you must be prepared to pay at least . A lot of people will tell you that there is no need to get a dedicated machine at all; you need only buy a chess program for your home computer. This is, of course, a much cheaper option, but then you would be getting a great deal less time on computers zapping aliens. When you've saved the universe from the forces of darkness a few hundred times, you might want to play a more intellectually challenging and rewarding game. If you do, then chess is one of the more obvious choices. The fascination of the game of chess has lasted for centuries and, when it comes to individuals, this fascination tends to be lifelong. So it's a good bet that any money you spend on chess now will be an investment which will pay dividends for a long time to come. This is why anyone who is interested in computers and also interested in chess should think very seriously about the latest generation of dedicated chess computers now available. They bring the owner a whole fistful of benefits, not the least of which is an ever available opponent whenever you need one. How often have you wanted a game of chess but had no-one to play with? The first question almost everyone asks about chess computers is \"How good are they?\". The answer to this is that state of the art chess computers are now as strong as very good chess club players at their very highest playing levels. So unless you play chess seriously every week you almost certainly will be struggling to beat good chess computers on their top levels and will have a very searching game on their lower levels. In fact ultimate strength of play isn't all that should be considered by the would be purchaser by any means. One really important point is to buy a chess computer that has a wide range of playing strengths so that not only can you be sure of finding a level that will give you an even well balanced game but that other members of your family can play at levels appropriate to them. Such a computer should also give you the choice of a game lasting a few minutes useful for lightning chess fanatics or a whole evening. Another feature that you should be looking for is the ability to update the machine. In the early years of chess computers (even until last year) the state of the art developed so quickly that anyone who bought a chess computer found that something much better came on to the market about six months later. Nowadays the best chess computer, like CONCHESS, have both their progProducing a machine that can play chess like a grand master still an unfulfilled dream has always been the ultimate challenge. In the 1960s and early 1970s a number of quite strong Chess programs were developed on huge number crunching mainframe processors. Nowadays however, a Chess playing computer doesn't have to be the size of a small house. The advance of microchip technology has meant that you can have a free standing or dedicated Chess computer sitting on your living room table. Over the five years that these have been available, great strides have been made. Below we offer you a guide to what is available today. Challenger A series of American machines, ranging from the weakest to the strongest of available computers. The buyer should be careful as there are a lot of outdated models still about, but the more recent machines represent good value. CONCHESS International design. The cheapest fully sensory boards available and the only machines yet to appear with updatable hardware as well as software. All this together with a strong program with delightfully designed classic rosewood boards have made these machines a best seller. Mephisto A German machine equipped with a program that makes some attempt to follow human thought processes. As yet the results have been relatively disappointing especially as the models are quite a bit more expensive than most. NOVAG Made in Hong Kong, this range of cheaper machines vary greatly in performance. The Constellation is by all reports a strong program. How reliable it will be remains to be seen some of the earlier models from other Hong Kong manufacturers were a problem in this area. La Regence This French machine is about to appear in Britain. Early reports of it are encouraging with a good program and an elegantly designed board. Scisys Again a range of machines appears under this name. Their Mark VI may appeal to the Chess fanatic because of its comprehensive range of features, but the average player may find it all a bit bewildering 44 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"ASTING? alternative to all those shoot-outs those little green men CONCHÉSS for your money. It is safe to say that no program for a home computer is as good as a top class dedicated machine. This is partly because a lot of the power and the memory in a micro-program are taken up in handling the graphic display and partly because, while the manufacturer of a dedicated chess computer lives or dies by the quality of its program, to a software house, a chess program will be only one among hundreds of a variety of products. It should also be remembered that playing chess on a screen is a lot more difficult than playing on a real board, (especially given some of the graphics one sees even now); it's a lot harder to visualise possibilities, for instance. Chess really is a three dimensional game where one needs and wants to be able to handle and feel the pieces on a good sized board.

"We've been telling all you vidkids out there just how good that old fashioned arcade game Pinball is for some time now. But here's your chance to get a taste of the game on your micro. It's got all the features of the original apart from the colourful cabinet and backsplash that is! As in the arcade original the main aim of this pinball game is to score as many points as you can. You get five balls to play with. The playfield includes several bumpers and targets which score varying points when you hit them. A major difference from the arcade machine is the bat you get at the bottom of the playfield which replaces the usual flippers on proper pinball machines. The bat is controlled by the Z and C keys. Accurate positioning of the bat in key positions will score high points. There is a two player option and a high score routine. To increase the speed of the bat and ball simply leave out the REM statements. SPECIA WHEN LIT Pinball BY JIM WILLEY RUNS ON A SHARP MZ8OK IN 4K "

"The tunnel is almost complete and we have all the equipment together ready for the escape attempt tonight. We hope that it's cloudy the tunnel exit is very close to the castle wall and any moonlight would make it easy for the guards to spot us as we run for the trees ... Al we can do now is wait Colditz Castle is supposed to be escape proof can you prove the German High Command wrong by leading your team of prisoners of war under the walls? This is a classic Adventure style game so as in all good Adventures you must collect equipment and plan your escape bid before making the final attempt. You have to find the best way past guards and their dogs and reach the castle walls. Once outside you still can't relax as you must follow a safe path to freedom. Well, can you escape from the supposedly escape proof castle?

"Theunbeatable TI Home Computer. It's all the computers your family will ever need. Buying a home computeris something you have to get right first time. It's too late when you've got one to find it won't take plug-in software. Or can't be programmed without an expensive accessory The TI Home Computer is a real computer system The TI Home Computer has got the memory power you might expect from more expensive computers, built in. Atits heart is a powerful TMS 9900 16-BIT Microprocessor. Most other home computers have only an 8-BIT. And you can expand the memory from 16K of RAM up to 52K. The total memory capacity is 114K Bytes. A wide range of software for everyone Another feature that makes the TI system so powerful, yet so easy to use is Solid State Software. These plugin cartridges cover everything from space games like Parsec to teaching maths, managing home finances and composing music. And the range is getting wider all the time. It even has what professionals look for in a home computer CPU: TMS 9900 16-BIT, plus 256-byte Scratchpad RAM Memory: Total 114K bytes; 26K bytes ROM internal; up to 36K ROM cartridges external; 16K built-in RAM expandable to 52K bytes, Keyboard:48 Key QWERTY, alphalock, function key auto repeat. Sound: 5 octaves, 3 simultaneous tones, noise tone. Colour: 16 foreground and background. High resolution Interfaces: Cassette, TV, 2 joysticks, main peripheral port. More than one programming language The standard programming language, TI BASIC, is built into your TI Home Computer so you can begin programming right away. But there's an expanded range of optional languages like Extended BASIC, TI Logo, USCD-Pascal, TI FORTHand Assembler. With these you can fully expand your programming skills. A wide range of peripherals Most computers lose a lot of memory when you add peripherals. The TI Home Computer is different. Every peripheral comes with its own built-in programs to keep the loss of memory to a minimum The convenient Peripheral Expansion System houses up to eight peripherals. Additional hardware cards simply plugin. You can even add a complete Floppy Disk Memory System. The peripherals include memory expansion, RS232 Interface, P-Code card and more. There's also a sophisticated matrix printer and Solid State Speech synthesizer which you can use with your own TI BASIC programs. A lot more for no more The TI Home Computer gives you so much more without costing more. At today's price it's exceptional value. Take your family round to try one.

"leche THE \"BARREL The Atmos phere in the pub is merry Everyone is singing along with the juke box joining in with favourite oldies. But then horrors! The beer has run out! It's your job as landlord to nip down in to the cellar and bring up a new barrel. But as you have been joining in the celebrations to your vision is a bit blurred and your reactions a bit slower than usual Down in the cellar you make a fatal mistake and start a landslide of barrels. You must run as fast as possible to escape the barrels and climb the ladders back to the safety of the bar -avoiding the falling barrels at the same time. If you reach the bar you will be greeted by the pub band playing \"Roll out the barrel almost as if they know what was going on all the time. You get three lives and he must climb to the top of the cellar. The played must avoid the barrels which are moving down towards him by jumping them. If the player jumps too early and lands on a barrel or does not jump at all then he is hit and he looses a life. The player will gain points however for climbing the ladders (10 for the first, 20 for the second and 30 for the third) and for reaching the top (1000 maximum). Also if he reaches the top he will get an extra life. The man will move left with the left cursor key and right with the right cursor key. Both these controls will keep the player moving until another key is pressed. To make the man jump use the space bar and to make the man climb up or down a ladder use the up cursor key. To convert the program to run in 16k, all pokes in the 45000-49000 region must be lowered by 8000 Hex. This is the only change that is needed.

"ABF PROGRAMMABLE OYSTICK INTERFACE MICRODRIVE COMPATIBLE ONLY 32.95 +pp for To Spectrum or ZX81 AGE ABOUT OUR INTERFACE The AGF Programmable Joystick Interface is a unique design offering the use of any Ataricompatible joystick with absolutely all software, whether it is cassette or ROM cartridge, with the Sinclair Spectrum or ZX81. The hardware programmable interface requires no additional software and accurately replicates the keys of the computer in a manner which is responsive to absolutely ALL key reading methods, both BASIC and Machine Code. The interface does not interfere with key operation and can therefore be used simultaneously with the keyboard. There is no need to remove the interface once fitted as the rear extension connector will accommodate further expansion, i.e printers or RAM packs etc. This important feature avoids excessive wear to the expansion port. The key replication principle pioneered by AGF means that your own programs can use eight directional joystick movement by utilising simple key reading BASIC. Two joystick sockets are provided which share the same keys, for use with the majority of two player games. Several interfaces may be used on the same computer for multiple joystick applications. The interface is programmed by a two digit code, which is looked up on a programming chart supplied, for each direction and firing button. The two numbers are then selected on a pair of leads which are clipped onto appropriately numbered strips on the interface. Once configured this can be marked on a Quick Reference Programming Card for storing with the game. As the programming is not power dependent the interface retains the last configuration made and can be immediately used when next switched on. PACKAGE CONTENTS SUPPLIED Programmable Interface Module as illustrated, complete with clip-on programming leads. . Self adhesive programming chart detailing how to define which key is simulated by UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and FIRE This can be fixed on to the case of your computer or if preferred the protective backing can be left on. The chart is made of a very durable reverse printed plastic and is extremely easy to read. One pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards for at-a-glance setting to your games requirements. The card allows you to mark the configuration in an easy to read fashion with space to record the software title and company name. Video Graffiti demonstration program which is written totally in BASIC to illustrate how all eight directions and fire can be read. This is also a useful high resolution drawing program. 12 months guarantee and full written instructions. JOYSTICKS KEY FEATURES * Programmable design gives TOTAL software support. # Accepts Atari, Competition Pro, Wico, Starfighter, Quick Shot, Le Stick etc. # Rear extension connector for all other add-ons. * Free demo program and instructions.

"Hoots Mon! Those wee Haggises are at it again. Chasing me through the heather. It's always the same when the Haggis hunting season ends. They like to have their revenge! This is an adaption of the arcade game called Mr Do which you may have seen in your local arcade. You control Billy Basher, the man hunted by Haggises, who travels around the screen picking up the smiling faces which appear. Behind him come the Haggises out for revenge. Billy has a supply of Haggis repellent, but this is limited. And then there is the spider deadly to both Billy and the Haggises. Billy can lure the Haggises onto the spider for extra points. You get three lives and an extra man at 1,000, 3,000 and 9,000 points. Each smiling face collected is worth 10 points. Happy Haggis Hunting! The Haggises are programmed to chase you most of the time but will sometimes run away. Pressing shift releases the Haggis repellent but you only have 10 units of this. 1 GREM HAGGIS BASH 2@REM BY LEIGH HUGILL 92 198 HAGGIS 30*FX15.1 40SOUND2, -15, 100, 10:LL-3: NB-1 00: RR=0 50MODE7:PRINTTABC 15,5); \"PLAY\" :PRINTTABC 11,8); CHR$( 141 ); \"Haggi s-Bash\":PRINTTAB 11,9); CHR$( 141 ) ;\" Haggis-Bash\" 6@PRINTTABC 10, 15); \"HIT A KEY\". :PRINTTAB6, 17); \"FOR INSTRUCTION 160FOR Sp1 TOSpeed: PROCMONO:P ROCMAN: PROCSPIDER: NEXT: PROCMONO: GOTO160 17@REM** MOVE YOUR MAN ACCORDI NG ** 180REM** TO KEYBOARD COMMAND ### 196DEFPROCMAN : PRINTTABCX, Y);\" \":25-INKEYS(O): RRR=RR RR-INKEY70Z$GET$ BOMODE1 90SOUND2, -15,100,10 100PROCCHAR 110CLS:PRINTTABC 2,4); \"YOU ARE BILLY BASHER TRAPPED IN A MINE\" ; TABC2,6); \"YOU MUST COLLECT THE B ONUSES AND AVOID\" 126PRINTTAB 2,8); \"THE HAGGISES AND SPIDERS\" 13GPRINTTAB(5, 10); N$;\" HARRY H AGGIS\":PRINTTABC 5, 12);FS; THE B ONUS\" PRINTTABS, 14);M; \" BILLY BASHER\" : PRINTTAB 8.28); \"HIT A KE Y TO BEGIN\"; TAB(5,16); CHR$ 226; CHR$(227); \" SAMMY SPIDER 140PRINTTABC 6, 19); \"YOUR CONTRO LS ARE\"; TABX 6,21%;\"'Z TO GO LEF T**'X' TO GO RIGHT\"; TABC 6,23);\": : TO GO UP TO GO DOWN\"; \"T ABC 13,30);\"* GOOD LUCK *\"; TAB 6.25); \"SHIFT' =MONSTER REPELANT\" G$GET$ : CLS 150DIMO%C4), E(4), W%C4),P%C30,3 0:9=: SC+8: PROCCHAR: PROCMAZE 200N=PX(X+1, Y): IF N<>1 AND N<> 5 AND N 0 PXX+1,Y)=ASCC\"2\"> 210N=PX(X,Y-1): IF N<>1 AND N<> 5 AND N<>0P%CX,Y-1 ASC(\"/\") 220N+P%CX, Y+1): IF N<>1 AND N<> 5 AND N<>0 P X , Y+1)=ASCC\",\"> 230N=PXX-1,Y): IF N<>1 AND N<> @ AND N<>5 P%CX1 , Y ASCK \"X\"> 240IF2$=\"Z\"AND P%CX-1,Y>5 X= X-1 ELSE IFZ-\"X\"AND P%CX+1, YX> 5 X=X+1 ELSE IFZ$=\"\"AND Y3 Y=Y -1 ELSE IFZS=\"/\"AND P%CX,Y+1 X5 Y=Y+1 250*FX 15, 1 260IF S>=NB THEN NBNB+NB*2:LL =LL+1 : PROCEX 270IF PCX,Y)>=0 SOUND1, -15,20 9.3 76 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"BY M. D. TOWNEND DODGEM O RUNS ON A VE 20 Mo S.sk RUNS ON A VIC 20 IN 3.5K Hi, there! Welcome to Grenville ffrenchSmythe's driving school! Oops, sorry sir. It's only a very small dent. Pardon? Well, there's no need to get like that! Really, some people! Anyway, hello again. Yes, we at the driving school are proud to be associated with Computer and Video Games bid to drum a bit of road safety into all of you out there! All you have to do is type in this driving simulation to have all the fun of driving up a busy High Street on a Saturday morning. You must clear each screen of dots and asterisks without hitting the other computer controlled — car. Your car starts at the bottom right hand side of the screen and moves anti-clockwise, scoring points for each dot or asterisk hit along the way. If you clear one screen you simply go on and increase your score. Keys to control your car are W=up, A=left, S=right, Z=down. Well there it is, we at the Smythe School of Motoring hope you all pass the test with BEANZ OR NER flying colours. Sorry? What red light ... Program notes: If you run the program and the track is not printing properly, check the characters in lines 100-330. Also check that each of the lines has a semi-colon at the end of it. If you don't get two cars appearing on the screen never fear, help is here! Check the initial values in line 10 and, if the cars look strange then check lines 1, 4, 6000 and 6001. If your car goes charging off the screen or starts demolishing the track, check lines 2000-2008. If the computer car does the same, check lines 600-608. If you find that you can't change lanes, i.e. when you leave a \"corridor\" check lines 3000-3500. GBH 3 Variables. P: position of players car. K: variable added to P to get next position. C: position of computer's car. V: variable added to C to get to next position. Q: variable used in lane changes. D: character for player's car. L: character for computer car. S1: bass speaker. S2: treble. S3: white noise. T: number of dots/asterisks left. illustration: Terry Rogers 3 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 83 "

"BY M. J. COATES RUNS ON A 40 COL PET IN 8K BRICKO UST "


"Have you been feeling just like another brick in the wall? Do you want to breakout? Well, try this game for size! Its a copy of that well-known arcade game in which you bash away at a brick wall with a bouncing projectile until all the bricks are reduced to a pile of dust! But beware, thiw version has a little tweak all of its own.

Meanwhile on the planet's surface the defence system is on Red Alert. All shields are up ready to defend the cities and lasers are at: the ready preparing to blast the missiles out of the atmosphere as they race toward the gleaming spires and towers of the vunerable cities.

"Waldo the Wizard the Game network's trademark The cable TV revolution won't just mean more sport and soap operas beaming into your front rooms. Computer games will also be zapping down the cables to provide yet another way of getting software for your micro. TIM METCALFE takes a look at two cable games services which will come on-line early next year. Will cable change the face of video gaming? ICTURE the scene. A bored family sitting around the TV, watching yet another repeat of The Good Life. Suddenly there's a flash of light, a puff of orange smoke and a strangely dressed being appears through the screen! \"Hi! I'm Captain Cable, defender of the viewer,\" says the odd visitor.\" My mission is to protect YOU from TV boredom. No longer do you have to suffer the tyranny of the dreaded repeat. I can bring you the TV programmes of your dreams — and computer games too!\" Soon the family are happy and laughing again, playing the latest space shoot 'em up on their special cable games console supplied by Captain Cable. \"Gee, thanks Captain,\" says little Bobby, \"We'll never have to watch Game for a Laugh again!\" Well, maybe the arrival of cable television won't be so dramatic in your home, but there's no doubt that it will change the way you use your TV. If you are lucky enough to live in an area where there is already a cable system linking your home with a \"head end\" station that's where the films, games and news come from you should be able to get a games service shortly after cable TV starts early next year. 114 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES Two major companies are going to provide a computer games service to subscribers when cable TV gets under way. W. H. Smith have come to an agreement to distribute services provided by The Games Network, a Californian company. And Thorn-EMI will be using their own cable networks to send games for popular micro-computers into your homes on their Telesoftware system. The two systems illustrate the different approaches to playing games by cable. The W. H. Smith service, The Games Network, will be offered as a package to companies operating a cable system who in turn will sell it to you the customer. The Games Network needs a special computer to download the games, you can't just plug your own home micro into the system. This machine is called The Window and is a 64k micro custom built for The Games Network. Subscribers to the network will be able to chose from 20 different games each month — selecting the game and playing it using The Window. Each month at least five new games will replace the least popular offerings on the system. The games are stored on a head-end computer system, which includes a fail-safe back-up to prevent any problems. It will be a 24 hour system too so if you want to blast a few aliens at three o'clock in the morning you'll be able to do just that! W. H. Smith say that the cost to the subscriber will be around  per month. They reckon that if you wanted to play as many games per month as the network will provide you'd need to spend around  on tapes or cartridges. Any of you having ideas about copying the games from the network system had better think again. The Window has built in security systems to prevent you doing it! There's no way you can save your favourite game, you have to pay as you play. Initially The Games Network will use games written in the U.S. but W. H. Smith say they want to gradually introduce British written software into the system. The Games Network was tested in California and started in earnest in September this year. In the States the network recommends that cable companies charge subscribers $49.95 to install the computer. The cable company keeps $15 of the installation fee and the customer gets $20 back when he ends his subscription. Thorn-EMI hope to hold several of the cable franchises when the Government decides later this year. They will "


"DIAL A VIDEO GAME! use their Telesoftware system to distribute games already available on their software catalogue. The main difference is that unlike The Games Network, subscribers will be able to use their own micro. The games wil download onto any of the popular home-computers including Spectrum, Atari, Texas, Vic-20, Commodore 64, BBC and, in the near future, the new Electron Subscribers will need a TV top adapter and Thorn-EMI are developing special cartridges for cartridge based machines to allow communication between the Telesoftware system and the computer. The subscriber simply calls up a menu page, selects another page detailing games for his or her machine and then choses a game and downloads it. Telesoftware hope to have up to 100 games on their system, again being monitored for popularity so changes can be made to the catalogue. They also plan to use other software other than that marketed by Thom-EMI. They say they went for a cable distribution system rather than a telephone line system — like Micronet simply HE days of buying your software on cassette are numbered. The latest way of obtaining programs is called telesoftware. The tele part means the same as in television and telephone Latin for \"from far away\" which is the idea of telesoftware. Instead of buying a program on a tape or cartridge you can now receive it, transmitted at the speed of light from a computer far away, into your own micro. There are two ways of doing this. One is to transmit the program down a wire using either a specially installed cable or the existing phone line. The alternative is to broadcast the software through the airwaves as a radio signal and let your micro decode it when it arrives. Both systems are currently available and although they both allow you to \"download\" programs, there are also many differences between them. Let me BY CABLE because of the speed of downloading and number of games that can be stored on the head end computers. Both W. H. Smith and Thorn-EMI are aware of the tremendous potential that cable systems have for testing out new games and discovering if they are winners or not. This would save a lot of time and money and popular games would soon find space on the packed software shelves. The Government has invited applications for the first pilot cable franchises in August. By November this first dozen should have received the green light and by next year should be in operation. Thorn-EMI have applied for franchises in Scotland, Coventry and Leicester. But many thousands of homes already have access to cable TV so they could be receiving a games service before the rest of the country. It remains to be seen how popular playing-by-cable will be. Will micro owners give up buying software? Or will cable games be able to exist side by side with existing outlets for software? Many experts are already predicting that cable TV will flop badly in this country. They reckon that people won't want to pay to watch — or play for that matter. But it's really up to you isn't it? explain ... Both systems are very new. The newest, though, is run by the good old BBC and is currently available only for the BBC model B micro This telesoftware system is the latest addition to the BBC's Ceefax service which puts screens of written information on your television. Until now there was only the normal information which everyone needs for their daily life, like the current share prices and today's price of fillet steak. What the BBC had been dreaming of was to produce a Ceefax adaptor to enable BBC micro users to access Ceefax instead of the normal way which involved buying a special TV set for around  more than a normal one. It was thought that, if the BBC micro could receive pages of information then why couldn't programs be transmitted on Ceefax pages and loaded into the micro? Well now they can. This is the BBC's entry in the telesoftware stakes and there are currently around six to eight programs which you can download, as well as having full access to the rest of the Ceefax database. You can also look at ITV's teletext service which is called Oracle although the BBC don't mention this. Anyway, Oracle doesn't have telesoftware on its pages. To access Ceefax on your BBC you will need to buy the Acorn Teletext adaptor. This will cost you , for which you get the box of tricks itself, a ROM which you can install yourself without invalidating the guarantee, and a glossy 73 page manual. Because the data from Ceefax is broadcast over the airwaves, communication is only one way. You'd need a pretty big transmitter in your garden to talk back! This means that you can't, for example, say \"send page 147\". So what happens is that the Ceefax transmitter sends each page for about a fifth of a second and then sends the next and so on. Then it starts again from the beginning. You tell the Teletext adaptor which page you want and the machine then waits for that page to come round, \"grabs\" it from the system and displays it on screen for as long as you wish. Although there is no real limit to the number of pages which are available on Ceefax, it is kept at around five to six hundred to keep access times as short as possible. One complete cycle takes 15 seconds. It's not as simple as that, though. Each page, of which there are a couple of hundred, can have up to 99 sub-pages which are extensions of that page. So a screen which is labelled 147 5/8 means page 147, sub page 5 of 8. The computer cycles through the pages transmitting all the sub page l's, then cycles again transmitting the 2's and so on. So if you're looking for a certain frame it may take time. If you are downloading a 10-page Basic program though, and the first page the machine finds is sub-page 5, then it will load from there and pick up the first four frames when they come round. This works on Basic programs only if you are waiting for a text or machine code file then the chances are that it will have to wait and start from the front page. The most important and useful difference between Ceefax on a special TV and Ceefax on a BBC micro is that a Basic program on a BBC can access pages from Ceefax as if they were stored in the computer's memory and then manipulate them. For example, there is a program which asks you to choose a menu for a dinner party from a wide range of ingredients. When you have chosen, the computer looks up the \"today's food prices\" page on Ceefax, extracts the prices of the items chosen and shows you what you would expect to pay for the meal. If the program is used again the next day, then new prices will be used. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 115 "


"ON LEER EEN Ceefax is not seen as being a long term software library, and there will only be about seven or eight programs available at one time. These will be changed every 14 days. There will also be software to tie in with schools television broadcasts, and this will be changed weekly to coincide with the programmes. The other way of receiving telesoftware is via direct wire link between your micro and the computer which is sending the program. To avoid laying extra cables, most of these systems use the existing telephone line. Such a system is Micronet 800. Micronet (to its friends) is a large database of information held on an even larger database called Prestel. Prestel is run by British Telecom and owing mainly to the cost of the hardware needed, had only about 10,000 members as of last year. These were mainly business users. Then someone had the idea of opening an area of Prestel especially for micro users, with the micro doing most of the work of decoding the signals from the phone. All that would then be needed would be a simple piece of equipment to link the micro to the phone. This system is called Micronet and began operation in April of this year. It starts on page you guessed it! — 800 of Prestel and has space for around 30,000 frames. Membership of Micronet also gives you access to the rest of Prestel, which totals some 250,000 pages. Some of these are for private use by certain companies but most are freely available to look at. Micronet also offers telesoftware, with a range of programs which can be downloaded via the phone into your computer. Transmission on Prestel is two-way As well as being sent information, you can also send data from your set to the Prestel computer. This means that you can request a particular page and Prestel will transmit it to you. Data from Prestel to you is transmitted at 1200 baud, which is the same speed as loading from cassette. There is hardly any delay between pages on longer multi-frame programs. Because you are on line to a live computer when using Micronet, there is a lot more available to you besides telesoftware. But for the same reason, the computer knows who you are and what telesoftware you are downloading and what other pages you are looking at. So every three months you receive a Prestel bill, as well as a severe shock when your phone bill arrives! Micronet can currently be used on the Spectrum, BBC, Apple and Tandy. Link-up for more computers is planned. tween  and  for the modem to link the computer to the phone, depending on your micro, BBC is the cheapest. You also need to register as a Prestel user which costs  a quarter, and as a Micronet user which is  a quarter. Then there are telephone charges and also page charges, although these can be avoided. The BBC Teletext adaptor costs . Once you have paid for it then there are no other charges at all. You can download programs and access the entire Ceefax database as often as you like. The entire database, though, is only 500 pages in length while Micronet alone has 30,000. Prestel has nearly ten times more. The Prestel and Micronet system is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ceefax is available only while the BBC transmitters are active: from around 6.30am to lam. Both systems are quite accurate in the transmitting of data. The telephone line is quite acceptable for Micronet, although the BBC recommends an outdoor aerial for Ceefax reception, unless you live next door to a transmitter. Micronet is a two-way system. You can send data to Micronet, and even send messages to a fellow subscriber, which will be waiting for him or her when they next use Micronet. A home banking section has just been introduced whereby you can handle your account, pay bills and see your statement while sitting at home watching TV! The BBC Teletext adaptor (above) and Spectrum with Micronet modem. There are at least a hundred free programs on the system for each computer, which can be downloaded for the cost of a phone call. There are also programs which will cost you money. These are either written by contributors or by professional software houses. You can download the latest releases from the major companies more cheaply than ordering the cassette. However, if you then have trouble saving the program on cassette you've lost your money. These charges go on your Prestel bill, as does your Micronet subscription. About 80% of Prestel pages are free. There is also a charge for being connected to the Prestel computer. During office hours your bill increases by Sp a minute, but at other times it is free. These are the two database/telesoftware systems currently available in this country, To connect to Micronet costs beTransmission of Micronet pages is at 1200 baud and, like Ceefax, you can fit about lk of program on a frame. Although Ceefax transmission is faster and can download a single-frame program in hardly any time at all, multiframe programs take as many 15second cycles as there are frames. I watched a 20-page program loading. It took six minutes. The maximum program size which you can download is governed by the amount of RAM which the micro uses to process the telesoftware and other data. Installing the telesoftware ROM in a BBC reduces RAM by around 1.5k, whereas the Micronet-handling software takes 17k of the 32k available to a BBC B user. (One of the reasons why Micronet won't run on a model A). So now it's make-your-mind-up time. You can either get into the telesoftware habit or carry on sending off for cassettes. If you'd like to get into this new technology and have a BBC micro then you're lucky enough to have a choice. If you've got a different computer then you can either join Micronet or hope that someone will make a Teletext adaptor for your machine. BY ROBERT SCHIFREEN 116 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"CHOOSING WARNING) A HOME MICRO Choosing a home micro can be a daunting task to the newcomer, and with an ever increasing number of micros emerging on the market, even up-grading, say, from a ZX81 can be a risky and expensive exercise if the wrong decision is made. It is important to look at the real facts and specifications, and check exactly what you get for your money before choosing your micro-computer system. High Quality Sound Some computers claim to provide a sound channel when in reality all that can be found inside the computer is a small buzzer controlled by electronic pulses. At the very least a sound facility should provide more than one channel and a raise channel as well (for gun shot effects in games for example). The best systems also provide envelope control of the sound channels to produce very sophisticated effects: very important for generating music. Also look for the ability to connect to external amplifiers. THE PITFALLS \"DON'T LET THE ADD ONS ADD UP\" A number of large companies are offering packages that seem to be good value and low cost. These offers usually have a hidden sting inasmuch as the essential accessories such as connection leads, peripherals and software often carry very high cost premiums. e.g. software for low cost hardware usually costs between  and  for a ROM cartridge!! CHECK THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. Raw materials are now an area where comers can be cut and shoddy workmanship during building can effect the 'up-time of your unit. Areas to watch out for are unreliable edge connectors, corrosion and poor quality P.C.B.s. Low quality components and bad design will seriously effect the reliability of the end product and can lead to false economy. DON'T BUY A GAMES MACHINE Inless you want just games and nothing else! With a games computer you are limited Some computers, however, have the advantage of both games facility plus the whole world of computing to explore, as your interest and skills develop. A real computer system will allow you to expand your knowledge of the Hi-Technology world, and help earn its keep with its added uses in the field of education, communication and home business use. SOFTWARE Make sure the system you choose has a growing library of support software, to enable you to realize the full potential of your machine. KEY POINTS TO LOOK FOR  High Resolution Colour In general most home computers have a poor graphics resolution (or detail). Check on the vertical and horizontal resolution in graphic mode and multiply the two numbers together. If the result is less than 35,000, then the graphics can hardly be considered high resolution Without high resolution graphics displays such as those used in games tend to be \"Chunky\" in appearance Choosing the right system carefully will save you from throwing your money away Check full specification plus peripherals and software prices, before you buy. Preferably choose a Real computer system that can expand to meet your needs. Keyboard For accurate entry of programs and data into a computer it is important that the keyboard has a good tactile feel in operation. Coupled with acoustic feedback the user is fully aware when the computer has accepted his/her actions. Also of importance in a keyboard is layout A standard computer keyboard layout will familiarise the user with the vast majority of computers used in the world of business and professional applications: very important if the purpose of purchasing a computer is educational RAM One of the most important features of a computer is the amount of RAM or memory, included. In general the more powerful and exciting a computer program is the more RAM it requires. But take care, all computers are advertised quoting the total RAM used in the system Computers use up a great deal of their own RAM for storing essential data and particularly in supporting the graphics display and the CPU. If it is less than 32K think again, is it enough? Computer Language It is too dificult to program a computer in its own binary language so high level languages are used, the most popular being BASIC. However, there are a number of BASICS, some being very different from the rest A de facto standard in the computer industry is Microsoft BASIC Learn this one and you will be able to program in the majority of computer BASICS: such an important point if a home computer is to be used to educate your children to face the technology of the future. Expansion As your interest and knowledge of computing grows, you will need a computer system that will grow with you: able to accommodate Printers, Disk-drives. Joysticks, Communica. tions Modem, and Colour Monitor, as well as produce HI-FI sound effects. Software The computer you choose should have a growing selection of utility software to make the most of its capability. Remember, computing is here to stay. You can't learn to compute on a toy. or a device which does not behave like a real computer, In short, look out for a computer which offers all the points above, and you will be sure of getting the best value for money To find out which company offers you the right choice, with: Good value, high specification, quality micros.

BY ROBERT SCHIFREEN 3D ESCAPE ZX81 ZX81 owners were puzzled by line 1560 in 3D Escape from September. Although the line was printed out, it does not make sense in Sinclair Basic. I loaded the tape which the author sent us and it was still there on the screen. I can only assume that our RAM pack has a fault in one of its bits, but I managed to find out the correct value by changing line 1570 to PRINT A. The program then printed the numbers from 6 to 11, so it seems that the strange dollar sign should in fact be a number 1. Clever, eh? Logjam Atari: Logjam for the Atari from October's issue lost half a line during printing. Line 5330 ends in a lone \"D\". This should say DRAWTO 71,39. Vic Tips: I said in October that SYS 256 is the same as LOAD. This is not quite correct; SYS 256 starts a machine code program which is at that location. Therefore it will only load if there is a relevant machine code program there. Texas Slalom: Slalom from October's issue for Texas works fine, except that your score is not set to zero after each run. To cure this, add the following line; 105 SCORE=0 Manhatten Invasion -Spectrum: You may find that the program does not register hits and also that the missiles are not drawn correctly. You can correct this by adding a command to line 1 by typing 1 INK 7: GOTO 100 and the program will now work correctly. Well that's it for another month.

Thinking again about pinching game ideas from SF, I realize that many stories feature flying or falling through endless passages or tunnels. Alice in Wonderland must be one of the first remember her drop down the rabbit hole? I've often wondered whether Carroll was inspired by the lad who, several years before Alice, fell 250 feet down a Great Western Railway tunnel shaft and all the way down kept shouting \"Below!\" to warn those underneath thus proving at last that it wasn't the speed of the fall that killed you, just the sudden stop at the bottom. In A E. van Vogt's Slan his most readable book, by the way, although it was his first and Damon Knight's space-opera Beyond the Barrier, people in strange craft go diving straight down into the solid Earth. Charles Harness's The Paradox Men features a terrifying plunge down a mile-high wall in an early chapter and an even more bizarre one into a bottomless sunspot near the end Samuel Delany's Nova has a spaceship steering down into an exploding sun and — because this nova is for some unlikely reason doughnutshaped-through the hole to safety. All good rousing stuff; any SF fan will think of many more examples of the Long Drop. Of course Star Wars swiped traditional SF ideas from everywhere and then they had the nerve to complain that Battlestar Galactica plagiarised Star Wars!). Sure enough, the ultimate assault on the Death Star involves a long hairraising flight down this narrow trench like a steel railway-cutting, although even that wasn't as mind-blowing as the Star Gate sequence from 2001. Indeed these high-speed flights through narrow spaces and dizzy perspectives are powerful stuff for absolutely dreadful psychological reasons, according to Damon Knight in a chapter of his In Search of Wonder, one of the more readable and unpretentious books about SF. So if you enjoy the arcade game Scramble and its derivatives, you probably suffer from appalling neuroses. It's still healthier than being a science fiction writer! I wanted to invent a mini-game which, without too much software, could perhaps conjure up this feelting of vertigo. Which reminds me that Vertigo is the title of a fine book by Bob Shaw, whose hero ends up having to plunge 124 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"BLIVION sickeningly down narrow shafts out of a hotel in the sky. My version simply uses the left and right arrow keys to steer a tiny craft this way and that as it falls down a horribly irregular \"tunnel\". You fall forever. You try not to hit the walls at left or right. Likewise you avoid the lumps of space-junk you pass on the way down; but you score points for ramming and destroying the # symbols which rise from the deeps. Each time you crash, your replacement ship appears a bit further down the screen, giving you less time to see and plan for the obstacles ahead. When you're forced clear off the bottom of the screen, the game is over. Can you score 100 or 200 before then? The listing suggests that the game's about zooming down an endless hyperspatial tube, avoiding debris while ramming alient nasties. It could just as well represent Alice falling down a convoluted rabbit-hole, seizing jars of orange marmalade while avoiding, er, bats or cats. The listing is for a Tandy Model I Level II. It should transfer with some tinkering to most machines: the important thing is that the screen must have automatic scrolling, this being what gives the game that heady speed which my yawning friends have compared to a slug running amok. A few notes: Line 1ll takes advantage of the TRS80 space-compression character codes, preparing an array of blank strings of all required lengths, saving time on STRING$ function calls later in line 303. LR and X represent, respectively, the width of the walls to left and right, and that of the space between them. The more esoteric conditionals like lines 302 and 404 are concerned with making sure the \"random\" changes in tunnel width never actually close the path off altogether. Line 305 alters your horizontal motion (the variable DZ) in a semi-realistic way according to pressings of arrow keys. A touch of the left-arrow adds a bit of leftward speed; another touch adds a bit more; a touch of the right-arrow at this point only reduces your leftward speed, another being needed to stop and yet another to set you moving to the right. Moral: don't build up huge speeds, it takes time to slow down! The PEEKS and POKEs are nothing exotic merely quick ways to handle some of the screen graphics. Type in the listing, then, and thrill to the awful sensation of falling. Will you be able to sleep peacefully at night again? WE POL BE mo 302 23  COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 125 "

"IG3/4 PLAN By Garry Marshall OVER THE RAINBOW ON THE SPECTRUM a = PI/2 a = PI a=3P1/2 The word spectrum conjours up a vision of bright colours. And the Sinclair computer of the same name is supplied with a wide variety of colours to create interesting graphic displays. The \"canvas\" the Spectrum provides for high-resolution graphics is a rectangular array of 256 x 176 dots. Displays are created by colouring in these dots with colours from the Spectrum palette. Horizontally, along a screen row, the dots are numbered 0 to 255 from left to right. In the vertical direction, up a column, they are numbered 0 to 175 from bottom to top. Thus, with this numbering scheme the dot in row 0 and column O is at the bottom left of the screen, and the dot in row 175 and column 255 is at the top right. As far as colour is concerned, the PAPER command is used to set the background colour, and INK the foreground colour in which the plotting takes place. By using the PLOT command any individual dot is coloured with the current ink colour. The command takes the form PLOT x, y and it causes the dot in column x and row y to be coloured in. A line can be drawn with DRAW and it causes a line to be drawn from a starting point to a given end point. The starting point is either where PLOT last plotted a point or where the last line produced with DRAW ended, depending on which was done more recently. The form of the DRAW command is DRAW x, y with x and y giving the position at which the line should end. However, they specify the point at which the line should end relative to the starting position. In this way, the line ends x dots to the right of the start as long as x is positive, but x dots to the left if x is negative. Similarly, the end is y dots up from the start if y is positive, but y dots down if it is negative. Because DRAW works in this way, it is a little tricky to use until you get used to it. Its form does make it ideal for writing a subroutine that plots an object at the current starting position, though, and when this can be done it is easy to move the object around the screen. This can be illustrated with an object that has a simple, shape, and so we choose a triangle that points upwards and is 8 dots high and is 12 units along the base. This can be plotted at the current starting position by the subroutine: 1000 DRAW -6,-8 1010 DRAW 12,0 1020 DRAW -6,8 1030 RETURN The triangle can then be plotted at the centre of the screen by: 10 PAPER 1: INK 6 20 PLOT 128,88 30 GOSUB 1800 The triangle can be moved around by plotting it again in the paper colour to erase it, moving to a new position with PLOT and drawing it in the ink colour, like this: 100 INK 1: GOSUB 1000 110 PLOT 148,68 120 INK 6: GOSUB 1000 The DRAW command can be used to create arcs and circles as well as straight lines. By giving it a third value so that it takes the form DRAW x, y, a the starting and finishing points are still the same, but the curve connecting them passes through an angle a as it traces its path. It should be noted with care that a is in radians and not in degrees. Since an angle of 2*PI radians corresponds to a complete revolution, or a complete circle, an angle of PI, for example, gives a semicircle. The illustration shows the results of giving a the values PI/2, PI and 3* PI/2 while using the same start and end points. Using DRAW in this way, the following subroutine plots a triangle with curved sides at the current starting position. 2000 DRAW -6, -8,-PI/3 2010 DRAW 12,0,PI/3 2020 DRAW -6,8,-PI/3 2030 RETURN.

"D T SOFTWARE DISASTERS (GSH) Not so much a disaster more a way of preventing them. At last software houses have started to think about YOU, the customer. A group of leading software houses have formed an association which has in turn established a Customers' Charter to protect the rights and interests of the people who purchase their products. We decided to take a look at the new Guild of Software Houses GOSH for short! and what it hopes to achieve. DEALERS' CHARTER Guild of Software House 1. Members will advise dealers of their individual delivery dates and will guarantee delivery within this time. 2. Members guarantee to maintain good standards of customer relations and to deal promptly and thoroughly with complaints. Action on complaints will normally be taken within five working days of receipt. 3. Where unavoidable difficulties do occur, outside members' control, dealers will be them as early as possible and will be kept informed of developments 4. Members undertake to avoid advertising products as available before this is in fact the case. 5. Members will quarantee a high technical standard of quality and reliability of their product and will exchange genuinely faulty or defective goods. (Dealers have a responsibility to ensure that goods returned are genuinely faulty.) 6. Members of the Guild will maintain high standards of business integrity in compliance with this Code of Practice. Member's terms and conditions of trade will be available on request. 7. The Guild of Software Houses will act to ensure that high standards are maintained. In the event that a complaint can not be resolved then dealers must make it clear to customers that they have the right to refer the matter to the Guild, Complaints should be directed in the first instance to the supplier of the goods, but if this fails to provide satisfaction, write to the Guild of Software Houses, 71 Park Lane, Tottenham, London N17 OHG (enclosing any relevant correspondence) and the matter will be taken up on your behalf. The Guild has been set up by a number of leading software houses including Bug-Byte, New Generation, Quicksilva, Salamander, Silversoft, Softek and Virgin Games. The Guild says it was founded in response to public demand for a little more discipline from the software houses. All GOSH members have pledged their support to a Customers' Charter which includes commitment to maintain promised mail-order delivery times, replace defective stock and deal promptly with complaints. There is also a Dealer Charter for the trade and a Code of Conduct for software houses in their dealings with one another, which outlaws the poaching of programs and programmers. Any software house found to be in breach of either the Charter or the Code of Conduct will be subject to the Guild disciplinary procedure involving fines and ultimate expulsion. With all these conditions attached to membership, the Guild hopes that their logo will quickly become a sign of quality and service to customers and dealers alike. Membership of the Guild is open to UK Software Houses at an annual subscription of  but, in order to sustain the Guilds standards, only houses able to satisfy the committee that they can live up to the Guild's pledges to dealers and customers will be elected So our advice is to take advantage of the Guilds offer of help and assistance. Make sure all the software you buy matches up to the high standards they have set and you won't go wrong. Meanwhile we're still interested to hear from any of you who feel you have a Great Software Disaster on your hands. Just drop us a line including all the details of your problem and we'll attempt to help you out. Remember we're the reader friendly magazine! GUILD OF SOFTWARE HOUSES CUSTOMERS' GUARANTEE 1. Members of the Guild guarantee a high technical standard of quality and reliability for their products. Faulty or defective merchandise will be replaced free of charge and despatched promptly. 2. Orders placed with members will be filled with a minimum of delay. Details of members' individual delivery times will be displayed prominently in advertising and strictly adhered to. In no case will deliveries exceed 28 days. 3. Members guarantee to maintain good standards of customer relations and to deal promptly and thoroughly with complaints. Action on complaints will normally be taken within five working days of receipt. 4. Members undertake to avoid advertising products as available before this is in fact the case. 5. Where unforeseen difficulties do occur, which are genuinely outside their control, members of the Guild undertake to keep customers well informed of developments. 6. Members of the Guild guarantee high standards of business integrity in compliance with this Code of Practice. Members' terms and conditions of trade are available on request. 7. These guarantees will be backed up by the Guild of Software Houses and action taken against any member company which fails to meet the required standard. Complaints should be directed in the first instance to the supplier of the goods but if this fails to provide satisfaction, write to the Guild of Software Houses, 71 Park Lane, Tottenham, London N17 OHG (enclosing any relevant correspondence) and the matter will be taken up on your behalf.

Just line yourself up at the START and hop onto one of the brown squares (you'll have to work out which is the right one) and work your way from square to square until you reach the correct blue square from which you can legally hop over the END line. Each of the four symbols has a meaning: UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT to the adjacent square. The direction each represents is shown by the arrows near each face. Hold on a moment though — the meaning for each symbol only applies to one face; i.e. the symbol for, say, DOWN, on face I cannot also mean DOWN on face 2 or 3. One other useful fact which may help to reduce the apparent awesomeness of the task to near triviality is that no symbol has a meaning which would take you right off the cube's faces, except, naturally, one of those in the blue squares. With these facts and our useful grid in which you can enter X's and V's for impossible and definite meanings it really isn't too much of a task for you to trace the one route through this cubic maze. But can you do it? O & D BR 0/0/0/&/o &&M cow  AP }/0/0/0/0 Avs $//*// wzo cow 2 Folcl--plocFli MOD TIL 0 OSTENTATIOUS PYROTECHNICS!

By adding them up before they fade you can see just how much has gone up in smoke. All of which made it triply annoying for Sir Herbert Lemmon when he saw his chauffeur, deputising as festival arsonist, let off three costly specimens at the same time. The stars became so intermingled that it was impossible for the guests to be impressed with just how much each had cost. After the event all he had left were a photo of the tragedy plus the dim recollection that the three prices of the different fireworks were equally spaced VESUVIUS "

"BEWITCHING BARBARA As the witching hour approached on Halloween Barbara may have made the last mistake of what had already been a pretty accident-prone life. Never a traditionalist, she had decided to go abroad dressed as a witch should be — entirely in black with blackened face and hair as well. Later gossip has it that the genuine sirens of the district took exception to this and crashed a broomstick into the main power line just as she sallied forth after having this picture taken. The bare fact is that a power cut plunged the village of Much Mulching into a darkness as black as her costume and she hasn't been seen since! If only she had settled for a white sheet off Widow Spriggs' washing line like the rest of the youngsters. Thanks for volunteering, but you cannot help to trace her now...though you do have it in your power to produce a white witch from the picture and, you never know, that may persuade the sprites to release her. No, you don't have simply to splash a pint of gloss over the page -in fact you must not use any materials at all! You are not even to touch the picture in any way. To break the spell and make white from black all you need to do is ... WHAT? Home Era CAN YOU RE-JIG THE JIGSAW? As you have no doubt divined already, we are asking you to complete this fully interlocking fourpiece jigsaw puzzle so that four five-letter words can be read across and down, starting from the arrows, and two three-letter word lie on either side of AVA. The pieces cannot be turned over but can be rotated and by sheer magic the letters will remain the right way up! So there are no dirty tricks like an N becoming a Z.

"GDAN 28 JOIN OUR ADVENTURE SWAP SHOP Are you an Adventure hoarder, or are you the type whose tape is well worn out by the time the game is solved? What do you do with an Adventure when all the mystery has gone from it? Graham Kennedy and Stuart Field wrote to me with just this problem, and wondered if anyone would care to do a one-to-one swap. Quite by coincidence, I noticed, they had compatible computer systems -so I put them in touch with each other. Is there any Apple II owner whose old copy of Mission Impossible, Savage Island or Golden Voyage is gatherring dust, and would like to swap it with Graham Boddy for any of Scott's other Adventures? described by text, movement is controlled by the arrow keys, and most other commands are single letter codes. There are about a dozen of these, but they are no problem to pick up — just as well, since parts of the action are in real-time, and quick responses are needed. Not an Adventure that poses problems, depending more on strategy than problem solving, but an interesting game, nonetheless. ENTER HERE AT ing, finding myself in a \"west-south\" tunnel. My mind twisted itself into tortuous knots trying to grasp this concept. I have mixed feeling about Knight's Quest. The responses are painfully slow, worse at locations which are accompanied by simple straight line graphics. These pictures are quite nicely done, but a hindrance to speed. HELP is a non-word a pity as a few HELPS could easily explain some of the mysterious and frustrating difficulties. 'I CAN'T\" type responses give no clear indication of whether one or both of the words used is recognised, or whether the action itself is illegal. On the other hand, the plot is interesting, with many problems. The display is well laid out, and very clear. The game is big (I managed to defeat the BREAK disable, look at the listing, and return to the game), and will take a long time to solve IF you have the patience! Knight's Quest comes from Phipps Associates for the 48k Spectrum. YOUR PERIL! LIGHT TOUCH FOR DRAGONS THE STRANGE AND THE GHO. Finding a good Adventure game for the Dragon is causing some people as much difficulty as others have solving Adventures! Although not exactly an orthodox Adventure, here's a game that combines features of Dungeons and Dragons with an Adventure style, using a series of maps and mazes for movement. I refer to The Ring of Darkness from Wintersoft. The player starts by choosing his character. I chose to be an intelligent elf, and after loading other programs from the tape, the game started. I moved around to various locations, some of which were townships with facilities to purchase food, drink, weapons, magic and other things. Food being an essential, I was'a regular customer, since each move around the main map used up one unit of food. I also tried a drink, and was treated to a very potent beer! Travelling around had its hazards, attacks by bandits and others being quite commonplace, so after dying a few deaths I included additional weaponry in my purchases. Although progress in the game is I am always suspicious of ground covered with leaves, for leaves are notorious for obscuring gratings. A grating is never straightforward to open and enter, but enter the adventurer must. The chances are that it is not there simply to drain stormwater, but may be relied on to lead to the meaty part of a game. I got quite excited when I discovered my first grating, and congratulated myself on my perception. A few gratings later, however, and leaf-shifting had become a fairly routine task. So it came about, in Knight's Quest, that as an experienced grating-finder I had those leaves swept into a pile in no time, and sure enough, there it was! Now to open it was it a brute force grating, or an unfindable key type? Whatever the answer, I was bound to need an implement. So I searched the land to Camelot Castle and beyond, meeting up with elves and a dwarf, an impassable giant, and a glaring Dragon. (No Adventure is complete without one, is it?) En-route I decided to pick a fight, and was dismayed to be told I was without a weapon, knowing I had on me a sword. Without any clues or HELP to guide me, I could only deduce that the reason was because the sword was in its scabbard. Unsheathing it became a long drawn out word game in its own right. I make no apology for telling you that you have to \"DRAW SWORD\". Ever hopeful of finding my implement I entered a cave, only to find that I could not leave it. I later discovered what I needed to get out, but never why. And so eventually I got into my gratBack in May, Stephen Donoghue's cat had left home, and his wife was about fo follow. Neither could stand the strain of trying to shoe the horse in Ghost Town. So worrying was the situation, I felt unable to set off for my week's cruise on the Oxford Canal without first writing to put Stephen out of his misery. Two months later, the horse was shod but three treasures were still missing. Stephen assembled a high powered team in an all-out attempt to find them. Perhaps I should have known better than to book a late break on the Trent and Mersey, for it heralded another letter from Sunderland. Adventureland had taken five hours, Strange Odyssey six days, but four months and still no end in sight on Ghost Town for our PhD, 3 MScs and 8 BScs! The team, I diagnosed, had overlooked one simple move, so I rushed Stephen a reply. My fingernails chewed to the armpits. I begged him to let me know the outcome. He rang late the next evening BY KEITH CAMPBELL 146 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

Padded cells lead off from a network of corridors, each with a door, always closed and often locked. The text is witty and plentiful, and produce a loony-bin atmosphere at least as good as Asylum's mixed graphics and text. A Bedlam lobotomy is not as devastion.

The city is made up of several types of buildings all differing in shape, size and design. If you accidently fire on a building it will be destroyed. Every layer one building you hit loses you ten points, and up to 40 points for a layer four building. This stops you demolishing the city to find aliens. There are three levels average, difficult and impossible. I did try the impossible level and found that about twice as many buildings have been added, all much taller which cuts down your view of advancing aliens! Yes...it was impossible. Despite some very nice graphics and realistic simulation, I thought that the game could have incorporated more interesting characteristics though it did possess a surprisingly addictive quality It's a good addition to games software for the ZX81 a micro that's rapidly being left behind in the rush to bigger and brighter machines.

Can you save the day? You are the supreme commander of a laser ship. Your task is to intercept and destroy all alien suicide craft. Your rank will be raised depending on how many aliens you destroy in relation to the amount of destruction being caused in the besieged city. The city consists of four layers of buildings which all move independently to each other at differing speeds in relation to the viewing angle, creating a 3D effect. The eight way direction is controlled by keyboard which I found took a long time to master. The all character graphics scroll in four directions producing a realistic flicker free flying simulation. Alien space ships appear near the top of the screen and keep a constant direction thereafter. When an alien stops, it automatically goes into its search and destroy mode! You will be destroyed if it hits you five times. Two quite frightening features are the hidden aliens located elsewhere in the city off screen. These may fire their laser demolishing a building. All you will see is a brief flash in the sky. Also ifby unfortunate means an alien completes its mission and reaches Ground Zero the game freezes for a second followed by a series of large explosions that blow a large chunk of your city to smithereens! You also have the useful option of flying at maximum speed by holding two keys down simultaneously, this results in the buildings wizzing past you at tremendous speed!

If you run out of control and hit the side of the winding tunnel, you will encounter an anti-matter field and immediately be blasted into a million little pieces. Continual use of your laser will soon use up the energy available on each level and I found it best to conserve energy by firing in short bursts. Your energy cells will regenerate themselves if you don't fire for a couple of seconds, but it is very irritating having to hang around and dodge the enemy missiles with no way of retaliating. A very ordinary game to play in its initial stages but it is redeemed by the space corridor and the fast action waiting for you on the other side.

All that exists is a barren land of sand, rocks and boulders. Life nowadays is ruled by cars. Gold is replaced by petrol and your sole aim in life is the possession of the eight Golden Cups of Ultimate. A more imaginitive scene-setter to a road race game is hard to find. And the program's not bad either. Tranz Am gets away from the standard screen layout of the car at the bottom of the screen and the road scrolling towards you. The car stays in the middle, and the whole screen scrolls in any direction To control the vehicle you use two keys to rotate yourself just like good old Asteroids. The screen acts as a window on the whole land, which is about seven times the size of the displayed area in each direction. The area you are searching is therefore about 50 times the screen size. The idea is to tour the land seeking and collecting the eight trophies which are positioned randomly for each game. There are also enemy cars which roam the area and must be avoided. You have three lives. The screen which displays the road is square, which leaves a column of spare TV space on the left. This is your indicator panel and shows the time, score, miles travelled, speed and a Fernando Herera is a name that commands the same respect in American video gaming circles that a well known writer or artist would in the art world.

Astro Chase takes the oldest cliche in video games but re-works it splendid ly to produce a game of colourful 3D style graphics and challenging game play. The Earth is under attack from the aliens and you are the lone pilot on a mission to clear the space around the planet. An assortment of adversaries have to be dealt with. Chasers are spider-like craft that can destroy your ship but don't really present much threat to the Earth. Far more deadly are the Megamines which gradually surround the Earth hiding from you behind surrounding planets.

The second issue of Soft Hits, is due out in November and consists of a cassette with a game for the 16k Spectrum on one side and the same game for the BBC B on the reverse. The game is called Airbrush and your job is to paint the floors of the prison in which you work while avoiding the waste bin and the armed guards. At least that's what the Spectrum version is about The BBC game involves life on the planet Duluxe and you have to collect enough local currency to afford the fare home, while avoiding the radio-active dustbins. This sounds like two different games but is in fact only one. It seems as though two different people were hired to write the blurb and no one could decide which was best. The game itself is quite playable, at least on the Spectrum version, Control of the paint roller is via the Caps Shift, Z, P and L keys although if you don't press any key then you move downwards. The idea is to roam the screen collecting paint pots to replenish your supply which is used up as you wander the screen. The program uses only normal character resolution graphics with user defined characters. Your roller moves by a whole character each step which is not ideal. The BBC version uses mode 1 graphics which should improve the situation. Sound effects are included and are quite effective, even if it does sound like water gurgling down a plug hole.

One interesting feature are the hearts planted at random on the platforms. These may be picked up for extra points but leave holes in the runways. Barrels that roll over these holes will fall through to the platform below, although you may jump over them. I'm sorry to say that this version fell below standard although the graphics were quite good.

Fans of action and adventure games now get the best of both worlds with the launch of a double-tape game. The pack consists of two cassettes. One with an action arcade-type game and another with an adventure. This idea is not new, but Phoenix software has added a new twist. You cannot load the adventure without the code, which you can only get by mastering the arcade game first. The first release in this series is for the Dragon and goes under the name Death Mines of Sirus. A feature of the cassette system on the Dragon is the ability to record speech or music and play it through the television. This can be activated by the remote control from the recorder Phoenix is the first company which have seen make use of this and it works amazingly. Once the game is loaded you are greeted with the theme music from 2001. Then, if you want the instructions, the music is played again as backing. This, unfortunately, is the best part of the game. The action game proper is little more than a lunar lander. It is in black and white, and it flickers badly. You and Captain Phoenix, say the instructions, must land your drone ship on the four pads at the bottom of the screen. Once you have done this you have to transport the aliens which inhabit the planet back to the top of the screen a better place. You have to complete all 12 skill levels of the action game before you can proceed to the adventure. At the end of each level you are given a clue which will help you later on. When you have mastered the first cassette, you will be given a code to load part one of the adventure. This consists of a four letter code, and there are nearly half a million combinations, On loading the first part of the adventure there are two — you are asked for the loading code. You are then told to press enter but this does not matter. SPECIAL OFFER for ATARI 400/800 OWNERS Hire your first 2 games free from our extensive range of software.

Guide your frog to his frog-hole by hopping him across a busy road and crocodile infested river in this, the official version of Frogger. In a close representation of the original arcade game by Sega your frog has to avoid the fast moving road traffic and cross the river by using floating logs and turtles' backs as stepping stones. Beware the turtles -they are inclined to dive unexpectedly. A lady frog appears at random in one of the five frog-holes on the far side of the riverbank When all five holes have been filled with frogs you move on to a new level. Things start to get more difficult as less time is allowed to get the frogs safely home, the cars move in faster convoys and there are fewer logs For one or two players, control is by joystick or keyboard. Keyboard control is very easy to master using the cursor keys for left, right, up and down moves Frogger is written in machine code and the graphics and speed are among the best I've seen on the Dragon.

Splat! certainly makes a welcome change to the usual shoot-em-up games that flood the C&VG offices every month. Instead of wiping out hordes of mutant invaders or destroying squadrons of bird men you've got to help Zippy, Splat's central character, to eat grass and avoid being squashed. The game has seven levels but this review only covers the first threemainly because I wasn't good enough to get any further! At the beginning of every game Zippy, represented by a flashing cross, is placed in the centre of an area strewn with rocks and the occasional clump of grass. The screen scrolls randomly in four directions. Bumping into the rocks doesn't do you any harm but you have to be careful not to get crushed between a rock and the surrounding wall, On your travels points are scored for eating grass and on the higher levels an odd plum might come your way. Zippy's progress through each level is shown as a percentage mark. When it reaches a 100 you move onto the next sheet. The second level includes a river but remember to use the bridges because Zippy can't swim. Level three has spikes which will kill you if they are touched. Incentive Software, the manufacturers of Splat! are offering a  prize to the person who can get the highest score on the game. I'm afraid you can't cheat because each score has a unique Hi-code which can be used to check the authenticity of any Hi-score. Splat! is one of the most addictive games I have ever played on the 48k Spectrum, it is certainly the most original and at .50 is good value too. Getting started Graphics Value Playability sky-scraper. Until out of the skies come a squadron of crazy choppers intent on dismantling the building brick by brick to let the beast out. Your job is to blast those choppers and stop the ape. If he gets out he quickly runs along the ground and bashes your little man with his fist. The game has several levels making for a progressively difficult challenge. Level one should not cause any of our readers any problems but by the time you get to number three the action becomes fast and furious. Added hazards are parachutists who can cripple your man if they land on him -as can falling sections of the building, crashing to the ground from obliterated choppers. If you do bite the dust the game introduces a cute Andy Cap type character who shuffles on to the screen to sweep up the mess.

I thought to myself, when I first sat down to play Star Jammer on the Dragon. I ended up horribly disappointed with the game. You are presented with a starships viewscreen and various stars and objects float in front of you. Your gunsights are situated in the middle of the screen, and the object is to manoeuvre an alien ship into range of your lasers and zap it.

There were no instructions included with the cassette and play was largely by trial and error. When I started the game I found it almost impossible to identify the alien as they start off as small blobs identical to all the other blobs around them. They rapidly get larger and larger until they exploded in a spectacular and colourful fashion. I was immediately awarded 50 points for doing absolutely nothing. With my next life I manoeuvered the alien into range of my gunsights and blasted away. I was awarded another 50 points! As the game progressed, the greater number of aliens killed meant more points were awarded for each one reduced to cosmic dust. If the alien isn't killed before it reaches a certain size, it grows until it fills nearly half the screen and explodes. These explosions are fantastic and although the program is written in Basic I feel it's a shame that the game doesn't match up to the quality of the explosions. The game is not helped by the impractical Dragon joystick. This doesn't have the usual self-centering feature and makes for very erratic manoeuvrability.

It features some spectacular graphics, and there is a choice of ten circuits, mostly based on real race tracks, although there are also some ficticious ones too like the Cambridge Ring and Micro Drive! When the game has loaded you first choose your track. Then you get a choice of three cars, one of which has an automatic gearbox. The entire lower half of the screen is taken up by your car. You see all the dials — in fact it resembles the cockpit display in Psion's flight simulation program in many ways. Apart from the car, which is superbly drawn, there is not a lot else on the screen. Small telegraph poles fly past occasionally, but there are no other cars to pass — or to crash into! This is one of those games which you have to be an octopus to play well. The game uses ten different keys but you only need to keep your hands on the accelerator, brake, left and right. You also need a spare finger to change up and down through the gears, except on the automatic car. I found the game a very real simulation of driving round a track. But steering is quite tricky and you certainly notice the lack of other cars. Chequered Flag runs on a 48k Spectrum, and you should find it in W. H. Smith. It costs .95.

"TAKING NEW SOFTWARE IN NEW DIRECTIONS SOFTWARE UPDATE The latest cassette software for ZX Computers You'll see that this issue of Sinclair Special devotes considerable space to software.Why, when we've so much to say about hardware and peripherals? Simply because at Sinclair we believe in supporting first-class hardware with first-class software This month sees the start of a new commitment to education in our catalogue, both for adults and children. In the field of micro theory, we've programs like Beyond BASIC and Make-a-Chip, which take you from the creation of simple Zx assembler subsets to simulated circuit design projects. There's Musicmaster, to teach you music terminology, note values and composition And if you're keen to beat your Spectrum at chess (which can be hard), you'll certainly want to try Chess Tutor 1, the first program in a complete chess masterclass 101 i Chess Tutor 1 For 48K RAM Spectrum. .95. Chess Tutor is a new way of learning all about chess-using your ZX Spectrum. It starts from the beginning by teaching you about the chess pieces and the way they move-including castling, en passant, promotion, check, checkmate, stalemate and perpetual check. Then it teaches you the basic tactics -pins, forks, double attacks and skewers. There are over 120 exercises and over 200 questions for you to answer with demonstrations and hints from your ZX Spectrum when you want them. You can choose which parts of the course you want-and even experienced players may be surprised at what they can learn from Chess Tutor Musicmaster For 48K RAM Spectrum. .95. Musicmaster turns your ZX Spectrum into a musical instrument which will not only play tunes, but will also demonstrate key signatures, durations of notes, and scales. You can write your own tunes -in any keyplay them over and over again, save them on tape, modify them, You can either write your music on a stave, or place a simple overlay on your Spectrum for a 17-note keyboard. Coming soon... In the pipeline are many new releases, some of which break completely new ground. LOGO and micro-PROLOG for instance. They're fifth generation languages which will take you and your Spectrum closer than ever before to the creation and application of artificial intelligence A formal agreement between Sinclair and Macmillan Education has been announced, the first results of which will be published this autumn. These consist of five programs in a complete early reading course plus the first four of a series of programs based on Macmillan's top selling Science Horizons Scheme. All programs are designed for use in schools or the home. And with Blackboard software, we're publishing six more home education programs for primary school children. Covering alphabet, spelling and punctuation, each of these programs is a true gem, unlike any other education software, and fascinating to run. Even for adults! I believe that these new titles represent a major advance in educational software for the home. Make-a-Chip For 48K RAM Spectrum. .95. Make-a-Chip teaches you the basic elements of circuit design, shows you how they fit together, and then lets you design and test your own circuits. When you have designed a circuit, you can give it inputs and outputs and your ZX Spectrum will check it for you. Then it will run it, or tell you what's wrong so that you can modify it. Make-a-Chip is a fascinating way of finding out how computer logic works. New ROM software too! You may well have heard news of ZX Interface 2 and ROM cartridge programs. You'll find full details of the Interface and its software on the facing page (and there's an order form on the back page too!).

Alisen Maguire Beyond BASIC For 48K RAM-Spectrum. .95. Takes the agony out of assembler. Takes the mystery out of machine code. Beyond BASIC gives you a deeper insight into the workings of your ZX Spectrum. It explains what happens inside your micro when you run a program, and it teaches you simple Z80 machine code programming. A major feature of Beyond BASIC is that it enables you to write your own Z80 assembler programs-then you can actually see on your screen how they affect the ZX Spectrum memory and registers.
