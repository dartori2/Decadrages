"computer video games gts NEWS O [GAME BOY GOES COLOUR] SELECT START FINALLYPLAYSTATION 2 RUMOURS GAME BOY colour ine years after the release of the original portable console, Nintendo has announced a new COLOUR SCREEN Game Boy that will be in UK shops in October, priced at .99. Previous colour hand-helds were let down by inadequate screens or short battery lives, but Nintendo claim that nine years of research, in conjunction with electronics giant Sharp, has solved both problems. The Colour Game Boy will be able to display 56 colours from a palette of 32,000, on a new kind of reflective colour screen which, it's promised, will be just as visible in indoor lighting as it is in sunlight. Battery life will not be as long as the mono Game Boy or Game Boy Pocket, but will be significantly improved over the 2-4 hours use that was such a problem with the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear. Nintendo have also promised a facility to link the Colour Game Boy with the N64, a feature that will probably come into its own when the Pocket Monster games are released in the autumn. The processing hardware inside the Colour Game Boy will be compatible with that in the original Game Boy, ensuring that older software Yeah, can be played on the Colour machine, as on the well, Super Game Boy. Players will be able to assign we've colours to the standard four-tone palette, and mocked some games will show a border graphic this up, around the screen.

But, with a total of over won't be releasing any more information until a more 60 million Game Boys sold worldwide to date, will be detailed announcement at E3 in May. Although the machine is still a good two years off (at least), rumours surrounding the PlayStation 2 are already circulating. Apparently, Sony wants to make PlayStation 2 more than a mere games machine and reports suggest that the PS2 team are working with Microsoft's Web TV developers to add Internet browsing capabilities to the console. This would allow Sony to market the machine as a mass-market, multi-purpose set-top box that handles games and online entertainment, and could also score millions of new customers for Microsoft's growing online services. Backing up this rumour is news that LSI Logic, a chip manufacturer that supplies Sony, is developing a chip that incorporates exactly the kind of processing facilities required for such a set-top GAME BOY GOES COLOUR AT LONG LAST!

The one titbit he did reveal was that he considers the major challenge for his developers is to create a machine that can \"convey emotions to the player\". Exactly what this means in terms of hardware design is anyone's guess. LOMYGOD! THEY'VE SIGNED APRIL FOOLED YA! South Park, the adult cartoon comedy sensation sweeping the USA, has arrived in the UK.

Tom's face has been pasted into the juggling game and Ed has been using camera trickery to create grotesque pictures of hands with eight fingers. Meanwhile, the printer has been pressed into criminal activities, generating unpleasant stickers to impress the ladies. Currently the camera and printer kit is available from a few importers, though many aren't planning on bringing any over because they don't anticipate much demand for the \"novelty item\".

"computer video games COMET STAR, LETER GRAB A GRANNY UNDER THE SURGEON'S KNIPE Dear CVG, Do you know of anywhere that I can get hold of Final Fantasy VII merchandise (T-Shirts etc)? Anthony Parker, Brentford, Middx. CVG: As far as we know, there are no official FFVII merchandise sellers in the UK. Your best bet is to try a local importer to see if they can get anything for you. Bor Dear CVG, I work part time in a games store, which may sound like heaven to your readers. Well not quite. There's one problem, namely your parents and grandparents. You see, there seems to be some unwritten law that states \"The older you are, the better your chances are of having a game exchanged or your money back.\" The number of people we get through the door who have bought their darling son or grandson a game he already owns is staggering. Yet nearly all of these games that are returned have something in common and follow yet another unwritten law. \"The crapper the game sold, the greater the likelihood that the customer already owns it.\" So come on folks, stop looking for the oldest person in your family to try and return the crap games you've bought and come and face us yourself, if you've got the balls. But be warned, as you leave the shop with the same game you came in with, myself and my colleagues will not be held responsible for the laughter thundering around our shop. Oh, and by the way, if you do send you grandmother, the same thing will happen to her, although we will laugh a little quieter. Who said the young people of today don't respect their elders? Stephen Atherton, Workington, Cumbria. P.S. Judging by your review, Cruis'n USA is going to be top of the \"he got two for his birthday' chart Dear CVG, After reading Richard Brightwell's letter in issue #196 (who now claims to be dead) complaining about Bomberman 64 being put in the back of the issue of #193 your reply was that \"Bomberman 64 was at the back of the mag for the simple reason that it was a review. And that is where the reviews go.\" At first, I thought that was a good reply, but after turning to page 18 there was a review of Yoshi's Story before the Coming Soon section. What excuse will you try to make up now? (It'd better be good!) Kinny, Blackburn, via E-mail. CVG: Just a little goof we made, Kinny. Soz. But Yoshi's Story in #196 was a Coming Soon feature, but the panels on the latter pages were mysteriously changed to Review ones! AND FIVE GAMES WIN A CONSOLE CVG: Well done, Stephen. A funny letter that easily deserves our prize. Get in contact with us to sort it all out. Dear CVG, A few weeks ago, I bought Resident Evil 2 on import and to be honest, it's s**t hot. It's got great graphics, great gameplay and tons of gore. This is good. Mark Holliday, Possilpark, Glasgow. CVG: \"... tons of gore. This is good.\" Comments like that spark national moral panic attacks, so careful who you talk to. Saturn is? Despite not being No1 in the UK or the USA, it's top of the tree in Japan (the gaming capital). It's success there has been overwhelming, and it's overshadowed every console and despite third party [titles), I've noticed the Saturn games are better quality. The PS and N64 are welcome to EA, Codemasters etc. The Saturn now has 90%, even 99% support from Capcom giving us 10/10 games like Vampire Saviour, X-Men vs SF, Marvel vs Capcom, SF3 and Res Evil 2! Warp are also giving 100% Saturn attention, with Enemy Zero and the first 64-bit game on the Saturn, D2. Then there's Sonic Team giving us Burning Rangers (who needs TR2 now?) and Panzer 3, Dead or Alive, Bomberman 2 and Shining Force 3 all coming out too! So I'd like to thank all those who ditched Sega because now we have better quality games by Warp, Sega, Capcom and Hudson. Adrian Batour, St Albans, Herts. Dear CVG, Why do the Spice Girls have a game on the PlayStation? The majority of PS owners are over 15 and most Spice Girls fans are much younger. And from what I've seen, it looks very boring. The Spice Girls craze is over now and Sony have missed the boat. Hugh MacDonald, Glasgow. CVG: You've answered your own question. It's aimed at all the younger fans who don't own a PlayStation so they go and buy one, thus increasing Sony's market share even further. It's not meant for your age group which is why you think it's crap. CVG: 1) Saturn is not No1 in Japan and hasn't been for a while now. The battle is definitely between PlayStation and N64. 2) D2 has not been confirmed on Saturn or the new machine. 3) A hint of sarcasm would have made all the difference to this letter. Dear CVG, I am a big cricket fan and love Brian Lara '96 for the Mega Drive. As I've got a PlayStation I never play my MD any more, so it's a shame that there are no cricket games for the PS. Or is there one coming out? David Wishart, Surrey. THE RATING'S FOUR CVG: You'll be pleased to know that Brian Lara is indeed coming to the PlayStation this summer. Cricket fans everywhere rejoice! Dear CVG, I'm confused over the situation about the latest snowboarding games, Cool Boarders 2 and Steep Slope Sliders. I'm a massive fan of SSS and in issue #195 of your mag, you gave both titles a worthy four out of five. I was pleased that SSS could measure up to such a massive title like CB2, but here comes the confusing part. I was checking the contents of issue #196 and it said there was a review of CB2. Anyway, I looked at the review and to my surprise you gave it a lower three out of five! Why did you make this change? A confused Alex Ramseyer Bache. SONY — AKA COUCH POTATOES CVG: We hold our hands up on this one. The wrong score was inserted in #196 by accident and it went in unnoticed. So, for all those that want to put it right, you can cut out the four out of five box below and stick it over the top. Dear CVG, I am one unsatisfied reader and writing to complain about there being a lack of PlayStation arcade games. You see Sega have been dominating the league of arcade games for the last eight years and have taken the world by storm with the opening of Segaworld. I'm almost certain that if Sony built a new park full of PlayStation arcade games, they would be making more money than creating a game that will only make a small profit. Richard Dowe, London. Suala RATING RATING CVG: How can you say that games only make a little profit? When Resident Evil 2 was released in America, only the film Titanic made more money the same weekend. Are you telling us that that's not much money? cut along the dotted line 15 "

Everything you need to know about this great game begins here. in the world of Tekken, 19 years have passed since the last King Of Iron Fist Tournament. Though it may seem as though 19 years have passed in real life, it has only been two years since PlayStation Tekken 2. The whole gaming world has been waiting eagerly for the follow-up. Tekken 3 has been a big hit in the arcades over the last 12 months, and the promise of an enhanced home version has had fans salivating to the point of dehydration. Now PlayStation Tekken 3 is complete and CVG is the first UK magazine to play it. And play it. And play it some more. Here's the first of our massive reports on what will become the biggest game of 1998. Enter the Tekken! THE STORY SO FAR YOSHIMET YOSHIMITSU FIRST UK PLAYTEST OF Tekken 3's King Of Iron Fist Tournament takes place 19 years after the last one, and a lot has happened. Heihachi has regained control of the Mishima family empire from his evil son Kazuya, but not before Kazuya and Jun Kazama have a son, Jin. He was raised by Jun in isolation until, at the age of 15, his mother was killed by the mysterious God Of Fighting. Wanting revenge, Jin turned to his grandfather Heihachi for help. Heihachi spent four years teaching Jin the Mishima fighting style, and chose to hold the King Of Iron Fist Tournament 3 to lure the God Of Fighting out of hiding. Here's where we come in. The mechanised space ninja Yoshimitsu wants the blood of the God Of Fighting to save Dr Boskonovitch. Nina Williams has spent 19 years in cryogenic sleep, but is now awake and ready to assassinate Jin Kazama. TEKKEN 3: THE MOVIE The first thing you see after powering up Tekken 3 on your PlayStation is the most incredible intro movie ever.

Yoshimitsu has a new move in Tekken 3 where he blows a cloud of acidic purple gas into his opponent's face. It's a great surprise move. The 45-year old kung-fu master, Lei Wulong, is now known to the criminal underworld as \"Super Cop\". king the Second was an orphan who saw the original King killed by the God Of Fighting, and was trained by Armor King. SPOT THE DIFFERENCE The first thing everyone wants to know is how good the PlayStation version of Tekken 3 looks when compared to the arcade original. Don't worry Namco have done an incredible job. Although the backgrounds have taken a drop in detail (they're not three-dimensional), the fighters are all massive and look fantastic! The best thing is that the game plays IDENTICALLY to the arcade game, and we really mean IDENTICALLY! The game code is exactly the same, so everything moves at the same speed and in the same way as the original. FIRST UK PLAYTEST OF 30. PALL WINS:3 The characters' legs are slightly less rounded than they are in the arcade version, but otherwise look pretty much spot-on!

"computer Video games THE NEW CHALLENGERS * JIN KAZAMA ***** *** * ** IMACH As well as the fighters we saw in Tekken 2, there are a few new challengers for the title \"King Of Iron Fist\". They all have their own reasons for fighting as well as their own complex links to the Tekken plotline. EDDY GORDO THE STORY Jin was raised by his mother, Jun Kazama, after his grandfather killed Kazuya his evil dad. Jin is competing in the King Of Iron Fist Tournament so that he can kill the God Of Fighting and get revenge for the death of his beloved mother. Everyone believes he is free from the possession of the devil which plagued his father. PlayStation NWINS! THE STORY Eddy Gordo is the son of one of the richest men in Brazil. His father was killed as he worked to wipe out a massive narcotics syndicate, but he convinced Eddy to hide in prison just before passing away. Eddy learned Capoeira from an old inmate during his eight years 'inside'. He is now ready to join the Mishima empire to gain more power against the drugdealers who took his father's life. EDDY WAONS EDDY EDDY TRO THE STYLE Jin is the main fighter in Tekken 3. He looks and fights a lot like his father, Kazuya. He uses the power of lightning and many familiar techniques, though he has new tricks of his own. He has a great balance of speed and power, and is considered by the team who created Tekken 3 to be the best overall fighter. FIRST UK PLAYTEST OF THE STYLE His Capoeira dance-fighting style looks strange and can be very confusing as he bounces all over the place, even fighting standing on his hands! Eddy is an easy fighter to play with when first starting, and has some very impressive moves. Thing is, he can take quite a lot of hard work to master. As well as the rendered arcade movie and PlayStation intro, Tekken 3 also has the real-time sequence with the fighters showing off their moves. An alternate version of it features the hidden fighters. 36 LCOVER STORY Law wears this brilliant Game Of Death costume in the first Tekken game, and it's back in Tekken 3!

Xiaoyu's teacher and distant relative Wang Jinrey once told her that the Mishima empire had lots of money, so she climbed onto Heihachi's private boat and defeated his guards. Heihachi was so impressed that he promised to build this theme park if Xiaoyu won his tournament. THE STORY Hwoarang studied under Baek Doo San, the Tae Kwon Do expert from Tekken 2. He's the leader of a gang, often participating in street fights, though he has never recovered from the embarrassment of accepting a draw with Jin Kazama. He's entering the king of Iron Fist Tournament to beat Jin outright, and to get revenge on the God Of Fighting for killing Baek. PlayStation YU WINS! HWOARANG WINS HWOARANG HWOARANG XIAOYU. XIAOYU. FIRST UK PLAYTEST OF THE STYLE Xiaoyu uses various traditional Chinese martial arts, which make her stand out from the other Tekken 3 fighters. Her style means that she's constantly moving from pose to pose. Though Xiaoyu is not an easy fighter to master she can be deadly with practice. THE STYLE Hwoarang has many similar kick-based techniques to Baek, as well as plenty of new techniques. One of Hwoarang's greatest skills is the ability to switch his stance at any point, swapping his leading foot to give him different moves. Good speed and agility make Hwoarang an impressive fighter both to watch and control. ALL NEW! TEKKEN FORCE MODE EDDY YOSHIMITSU The most surprising PlayStation-only feature of Tekken 3 is Tekken Force Mode. This is a sideways-scrolling mode where you battle against up to five enemies at once. There are four stages in all, each of which has a major character as an end-of-level boss. All of the enemies are members of the Mishima family empire's Tekken Force Heihachi's private army which he uses to restore peace and order to the world. As you pick off the Tekken Force, you gain extra time to complete the level. If you manage to complete the whole thing without dying you get... a secret, and a completely amazing new character who we'll reveal next month!

"computer video games TEN OF THE BEST Getting an impressive 10 hits is a different matter. Each fighter has at least one 10-hit combo to learn, all of which look excellent but take a fair amount of work to master. There are plenty of other combo possibilities, the most useful of which involve hitting your opponent into the air then keeping them up with repeated attacks. The revised Practice Mode teaches you the basics of these 'floating' combos. This technique is also known as 'juggling'. You can string together four or five hits in Tekken 3 by tapping the buttons and hoping for the best. PlayStation OL Here's one of Paul's 10-hit combos. If each attack connects, this does big damage! If you mess up, you could be left open to attack. O THERE'S MORE OGRE HWOARANG As players of arcade Tekken 3 already know, there are extra characters who appeared in the game over the course of a few months thanks to the System 12's internal clock. In the PlayStation version you collect these fighters by finishing the game in arcade mode, then save them to memory card. They may be 'secret' characters, but they've had just as much effort put into them as the regular ones. The God Of Fighting in almost-human form.

It's all here, man! ver since the launch of the N64, Nintendo have been criticised by more mature players for making games that are just too kiddy. Goldeneye changed that to some extent by bringing in a bit of shoot-'em-up danger, something that parents might not approve of. Now, as well as danger, Nintendo is using sheer, out-and-out cool to bring in the older gamer with 1080°, the most realistic, playable and gorgeous-to-look-at snowboarding game ever created.

You can control any of five characters, all with different abilities, and put them on simulated versions of seven of the latest boards. All this detail is in there for a reason to make the control feel as true to the real thing as possible. In fact, that's one of the things that makes 1080° such a great game, so let's talk about that first. It may look deadly, but you can land any jump.

Take to the Half Pipe in Trick Attack mode and you get 45 seconds to get to the finish line, pulling off as many airborne stunt combinations as possible on the way. Air Make is a huge, indoor ski-jump; launch yourself off the end and you get lots of air to make the biggest combo possible before landing.

Match Race is pure racing, you versus computer opponents in the normal, hard and expert categories. Time Attack is you versus the clock, but there's not enough time on the clock to finish the course, so you have to pass checkpoints along the way to win extra seconds. Trick Attack allows you to tackle any course and try to notch up as many stunt points as possible. And Contest is a mixture of five speed slopes and trick courses. Red and blue flags are placed around each slope and, to stay in the game, you've got to follow them. Again, you don't have enough time on the clock to make it all the way down, but every flag you pass gives you an extra two seconds. Lastly there's a training mode to help you learn the tricks and a two player versus option, where it's you versus a friend in a cool splitscreen, head-to-head battle.

It was originally reported that there were over 300, but this dwindled to 150 at one point before shooting back up to the rather vague 'over 250'. Our own research suggests that there are at least 160 different cars and Sony's claim of 'over 250' rests on the fact that the vast majority of the cars have an alternative bodyshell. These new looks for the car can only be bought once every other upgrade is fixed onto the vehicle, and usually only increase the speed by a fraction.

PlayStation FFF HEEFT BOMBERMAN WORLD I WAS FLAT BUT NOW I'M ROUND za e's been around for a decade and has appeared on nearly every console in that time, but now Bomberman is making up for lost ground. He hit a sticky patch on the N64 last year with a game that strayed away from everything that made Bomberman great. Namely simple gameplay and an awesome multiplayer mode both these elements are back for Bomberman World. But in an ongoing quest to breathe new life into the series, Hudson have opted for an isometric viewpoint this time. Does it work? Are Bomberman's greatest games behind him? Judging from this, we expect the B-man to be with us for quite a while yet. The isometric perspective employed in BW suggests that the game is trying to find a happy medium between Bomberman games of old and his 64-bit adventure. The viewpoint works, but it takes a little while to get used to. On later levels this camera angle is well utilised when enemies can attack from higher platforms. Judging from this and the Nintendo game, though, Bomberman's clearly finding it hard trying to exist in, and compete against, 3D games. SCORE 3000 02:48 0/1 SCORE: 7200 04:41 THE OLD FAVOURITES RETURN BOMBERMAN BLASTS ONTO PLAYSTATION It's pretty easy to see enemies and bombs here. * THE NEW STYLE Like all other Bomberman games since the year dot, the new version is made up of several seperate modes of play. You get the single player story mode, where our B-man must battle to save worlds from the evil B-men. The challenge mode is just that a two or five minute challenge where you try to clear a heavily guarded room and defeat a boss in the alloted time. There are bonuses to collect and extra points be won for time remaining. Finally, there's the battle mode, where you and four friends can battle it out in a variety of arenas. There are lots of options to play around with in this mode and they allow different weapons to appear. The number of rounds won constitutes victory. 02:38-00, 0, 0, 0, 0, So what's changed? What element is going to convince the B veterans and the newcomers to want to play the latest installment of the Man? Not a great deal, we're afraid, just a few minor additions. There's a new bomb that can cause mass mayhem the spiked bomb, which is the most powerful bomb the series has seen. It has the range of a power bomb, but the blast is not prevented from expanding by a destructible wall it continues until it reaches an indestructible object. If your enemy has these, you're in trouble. There are also several mini games that play similarly to an electric stick challenge, where B races through the course to collect bonuses, but he's not allowed to touch the sides. 4x2 SCORE 2300 002 48 146 SCORE 1578000010 +50 Shop COMING SOON The battle mode is back to how it should be 10 arenas, and lots of power-ups to fight over.

Those starved of Bomberman on the PlayStation will be glad to hear that Sony are releasing the game very soon. It may not be his greatest adventure, but he's still got the classic multiplayer skills! 38 "

"I'VE GOT TO GO SIR! computer Video games One trick that has remained from the original version is the \"leave the room\" tactic. If you're trying to conserve your ammo, some of the tougher enemies can be avoided altogether by leaving the room without killing them and returning: The very first Hunter can be side-stepped like this. Of course this doesn't work all the time but it's worth trying if you get a little stuck. DET PlayStation LAUGH TILL YOUR SIDES SPLIT YER VALVES GONE HUN The Valve handle is one of the most important items in the game. Its location usually changes and depends on the scenario you're playing, but it's one of the first things you pick up. Apart from putting out the fire on the helicopter. It can also be used in a couple of other situations, which aren't immediately obvious. Once you've made your way into the sewers, the Valve handle is used to raise and lower the platform that lets you get to the Alligator and control rooms. Additionally (and this is the one that isn't immediately obvious) it turns off the fan that lets you sneak back through to the sewers... 1 Do you think that this guy is dead? The helicopter is just around the corner, so dispatch all of these bad guys before you attempt to put the fire out. The zombies in the pic below float after they're dead! As the zombie staggers nearer, Leon aims the Shotgun and pumps the zombie with a stomach full of lead. As he mutilates the other zombie, the torso slowly crawls towards his feet! One handgun round to the head and it's bye bye! REVIEW One of the most visually satisfying aspects of this game, is the ability you have to split the undead into two pieces. Doing this is pretty difficult as more often than not you'll simply find yourself blasting zombies rather than slicing them. But if you're lucky, one shotgun round aimed at the midriff is enough to carve a walking corpse! Tron si pool Remember this pool... Another one bites the dust. Crow, meet Rocket Launcher! 47 "


"games WHENIT HISTHEFAIN. LES SHE WAS JUM PlayStation It turns out that the main culprit behind the chaos in Raccoon City is the Chief of Police, Brian Irons. Basically, he was working in secret with Umbrella and taking lots of envelopes from behind the radiator in order to keep the police away from their labs. But it all turned against him when Umbrella tried to take the T-Virus and it spread throughout the city. Playing as Claire, you get to meet the twisted man, and also see his grisly demise. There are two ways in which he kicks the bucket, both with ultimate gore satisfaction. These are really funny, but also damn scary! Scenario one sees him being infected by William, and having a small mutant hatch from his chest. Scenario two gives you the opportunity to watch Irons get dragged to his death by a huge tentacle, and half his body spat back up at you. As well as the secret game modes, there are also other weapons to be had by completing the game in double quick time. By completing any original scenario for each character with a rank of B or higher, you get yourself a Rocket Launcher with infinite bullets to maim zombies with. When you start up the next game, it'll be located in the first weapon storage box you come across. Then, complete the second story for either character and you can expect a Gatling Gun with infinite bullets for your troubles! This is an extremely cool weapon, and with this pumping 10 rounds a second, you cannot fail to feel like Blain from the movie Predator. 1 Oh dear. After revealing all of his trade secrets to you, a tentacle appears to drag the chief away! One quick look... + ...and the remains are gobbed back up by the beast! Obviously Mr Irons legs had more use as toothpicks than his midriff. 1 Nothing lives after the Gatling Gun whirrs into motion! Chew on this fools! ONE HUNK OF A MAN The first 'secret' game puts you in control of Hunk, who is a member of Umbrella's SWAT Team. This time however, your aim is to get from the sewers to the roof of the building, so you can escape with the Virus. It becomes a lot clearer once you've seen the rendered sequence about half way through the game, explaining how the T-Virus escapes and spreads into the city. The second game is another variation of the Hunk game, but is called Tofu. And you control a bit of bean curd. The bean curd only has a minimal amount of weapons and ammo and is rock hard to complete. He turns red and starts puffing when energy is low even wears a beret. Quite why Capcom elected to put this is the game is a mystery, but nevertheless, it's a fun little quirk if you can be bothered to try and access More Gatling Gun action. Once this is up, you can go for Hunk, pictured far left. The Rocket Launcher with infinite ammo. One shot kills everything with this baby! And this is the mysterious To-Fu. Armed with only a knife, this is one rock hard sub game. REVIEW it. 48 "


"compute Video games THE LOST FILES hetore N after PlayStation So what ever happened to the version of Resident Evil 2 that they scrapped? Now officially crowned as Res Evil 1.5, a 6070% complete version still exists, which makes speculation rife as to its future. With no official word on what's going to happen to this disc, the very fact that it's still kicking around suggest to us that it could well be released as a special collectors edition or something similar? We also thought it may go straight to a budget range seeing as the game wasn't that finished? As you can see from our comparison shots, it seems that some of the elements were used in the final game, but how much was left out? Will we ever know? 1 The weapon storage room? The big link are the lockers at the end of the room, as the open door is where you find the Sub Machine Gun in the final game. No dogs in here though. 2ND OPINION Wow. This delivers everything I'd hoped for in a Resident Evil sequel. The graphics are amazing. They make the original seem sparse and almost redundant in comparison. I can't say that the gameplay has really been added to there are some nice puzzles, but none that offer a huge leap over the original. For me it's the overall effect which is so satisfying. Little touches add to the atmosphere, like the way characters don't take their eyes off the dead, or the different ways they walk when injured. Even the variety in sounds for shooting and walking are amazing. Add the replay factor, some cool secrets, and everything that made the original great but significantly enhanced, and you've got another Must Have game. ALEX HUHTALA CVG OPINION RESIDENT EVIL 3? More speculation, but this time we have a bit of a hint to go on. Without wanting, to spoil too much of the game for you, there are an absolute ton of loose ends at the end of RE2. Chris and Jill never make an appearance, which considering that Claire is only in town to find her brother, means that there must be a next installment. Sherri makes it through as well, so what happens to her because she never finds out the whole story about her parents. Put it this way, it wouldn't surprise us if RE3 was already in production. I would go as far to say that this is one of the most involving, scary, and outright awesome games I've ever played. Our forum page on Game Online has differing views on RE2, many complaining that it's too short. Initially, I would have to agree with them. However, once you start playing all of the scenarios, the plot changes and new locations or items really do make a difference. I never got bored playing through the mansions again, and there was always a nagging feeling inside that I had to find the secret weapons and hidden games. I don't think I've ever played a game as much as this, and quite simply cannot praise it enough.

"computer video games NINTENDO 64 Tournament the RPG PLATFORM OUT APRIL BY KCE OSAKA 1 PLAYER  PRICE .99  SNES PREDECESSORS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 128MBIT CART  RELEASED BY KONAMI TEL 01895 853000 OUT APRIL 1 PLAYER NINTENDO 64 ITEM It might look like a Mario 64 clone, but there's more to Mystical Ninja than jumping around platforms. The first N64 Action RPG is here, and it's really funky. intendo die-hards will need no introduction to Goemon and Konami's Mystical Ninja series. But for the sake of the rest of you here's the deal. The Goemon games are comedy quest adventures set in ancient Japan, and star two thieves turned folk heroes, namely the spikeyhaired Goemon and Ebisumaru, his rotund pal. Action is based around solving puzzles, finding items and completing sub-quests for characters you meet along the way, but the games are full of platform-vaulting and smacking monsters over the head with sticks. In the Super NES Goemon games, the blend of tight action and imaginative adventure was perfect. Now Goemon has made the leap from 2D to 3D, and the effect is something special. STARRING COEMAT ITEM21174 RO X4 MALNDNIN STARRING OOOO THE FOUR NINJAS -ITEM439  sITEM A strength of the Mystical Ninja series is the way you can switch between characters with different capabilities. The N64 game stars the full line-up of characters from the last Super NES game. Hard man Goemon and his comedy side-kick Ebisumaru are here. They're joined part-way through the game by Yae, a female secret agent, and Sasuke, a robot ninja. As well as wielding different weapons, the characters also acquire their own magical powers during the course of the game. Also, other characters in the game react differently to you depending on which player you're using, so one character might help you if you're playing Ebisumaru but not if you're Goemon.

Within the walls of the towns, everyone is friendly enough. But out in the countryside bizarre mechanical monsters roam free, and selfdefence becomes important. All the characters start with one weapon, but they find new ones as they progress. Combat is generally closequarters stick-beating, but ranged weapons also turn up later on.

The puzzles in Mystical Ninja aren't that tough. If you're ever stuck for what to do, who to see, or where to visit next, just ask the people around and they'll give you a heavy-handed clue. Once you're in an enemy stronghold, most of the puzzles are to do with finding keys to doors, and you don't usually have far to look. Keep your eyes open for hidden stuff, too. There are lots of extra lives, health-boosting cat charms and life-restoring dumplings hidden about the place. REVIEW Each character has one magic power that gets them past impassable objects. Goemon's power is super strength, Ebisumaru's is the ability to shrink to mouse-size, Yae can transform into a mermaid and swim underwater, and Sasuke can earn a sort of jet pack that lets him jump extra high. This is all very convenient of course, but all magic abilities have to be earned by completing a subgame. And though they look easy, some of them can be quite demanding. 2023 1 Wonder what this can be? Some kind of seed, perhaps? 1 What happens if I 1 Way-hey!

LETS START OUR JOURNEY AS WE WHISTLE ALONG Mystical Ninja has its own theme song which features at the beginning of the game and at certain dramatic moments. The singing is in Japanese, but English subtitles appear to tell you what the song is about... sort of. These are literal translations so the songs come across as being peculiar. Lyrics like 'Even if the harsh winds were to take you away, live your life the way YOU want it, that is the destiny for many' wouldn't be out of place in the average Eurovision entry. The difference is that these tunes are all very catchy indeed and we can't get them out of our heads! STARRING COEMON live your life the way Vou want it, that is the destiny for many CVG OPINION There's a message for us all there. Sigh. Another night in a single bed. This is a great game but I can imagine it being ignored by the masses just because it looks a bit different. Mystical Ninja has a very strong Japanese flavour, and the direct translation of the storyline, the dialogue, and even the jokes has left it looking and feeling quite surreal. If you're prepared to cut it some slack and play along, though, it's a really entertaining adventure, with loads of combat and platform action and excellent surprises along the route. Also the quest is enormous, with only the slightest hint of linearity. The graphical style is great the scenery is detailed, and the characters are superbly rendered. The 3D isn't quite as smooth as Mario 64's, but the layout of the rooms means there are fewer ambiguouslooking jumps. So, don't be put off by your prejudices make this the most popular Mystical Ninja game yet.

But Lone drivers can also experience the delights of this game. For a start you can record your entire race and save it to your hard drive. As well as being able to watch this again from a variety of flash camera angles, you can also race against a ghost which follows the route you recorded. If you think you've got a world-beating time, you can even e-mail this saved game to a friend, and they can try their luck racing against it! If you're hooked up to a network, there is also a chat option in the pre-race lobby where you can engage in friendly banter.

It's one of the most visually appealing driving games you're likely to find, certainly on the PC and maybe on the PlayStation as well. It's an immensely fast game, something you notice even with the first few cars, and there is hardly any sign of pop up. The soundtrack is also something I really liked, despite a few comments from passers-by about how it sounded like an \"Eighties disco'. The one major gripe would have about the game is that it can seem a little bland at some points. There isn't too much going on in some of the stages, and if the other cars get too far in front then you find yourself going through the motions. There is a catch-up option, but this doesn't work in the league mode. Overall, however, Motorhead is a stylish racer, and one that I found impressive. STEVE 269 IR 6 -UUGU Wullit B. .

PRICE .99  PC AND SATURN VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 128 MB CART  RELEASED BY GT INTERACTIVE TEL 0171 258 3791 MAY RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS NINTENDO 64 You've heard a lot about Quake's dungeons recently, and now Nintendo 64 owners have the chance to experience them first hand. DUA KE uake is a game without a plot. It's got no intro, no 'bad guy', no main character, no reason for any of it being the way it is. The thing is, Quake doesn't need any of this. It's as pure as games come some bloke in some places with some weapons killing some things. On the PC it's bigger than big, and it's one of the most popular subjects on the Internet. It has revolutionised PC gaming and is now heading to the Nintendo 64 with fancy new graphical features. But does it carry across the most important thing... the playability? Well, hold onto your rocket launchers, it's time to Quake! 4 HOW TO PLAY... QUAKE In case you have trouble working out what to do in Quake, even after you've read the instruction manual four times, here's a little explanation. I'M GONNA FRAG YO ASSI QUAKE One of the suggested reasons for Quake's sudden leap up the release schedule is that Midway decided the proposed four-player split-screen mode would be impossible to get working at a decent speed. Thankfully they haven't left out the multi-player options entirely, as two of you can battle it out at the same time in the mode that made Quake so popular deathmatch! 1 First of all, find a weapon the bigger 1 Get some health and armour so that the better. These range from a standard you can last a bit longer against each axe to a meaty lightning gun. level's wandering hellspawn. HEALTH SBMBBS 2 LOAPS Of DUCISSHOT, HALTE ARMOR TOO Amino PRAGS Find some enemies and kill them with your weapon. They should turn into a bloody mess. If not, keep shooting. Repeat the steps 1-3 until you find the exit. Go through to the next level. The six original deathmatch-only levels are included plus there's an extra level specially created for the Nintendo 64 game.  AMOR SRIMDB 00 AMMO | REVIEW HALIH 100  HEALTH TOO IMDB AMMO Amu FB5 All of the deathmatch levels in N64 Quake are hundreds of times more interesting than Goldeneye's. Well, we think so, anyway. In multiplayer mode, it can be a bit hard to see what's going on, and the frame rate is just jerky enough to cause a few problems, but otherwise there's a lot of fun to be had. 72 58 "


"IT'S LIKE A DISCO IN HELL computer video games Nintendo 64 Quake uses some of the 3Dfx-enhanced PC version's techniques to create the great graphics. All of the textures are anti-aliased so that they look smoother, plus there are some great new coloured lighting effects. Unfortunately, the brilliant real-time effects of the Saturn version aren't used here, but the levels are lit in a new and very impressive way. Lava-filled areas glow red, watery sections are blue, and other colours are used to add atmosphere. Everything under these lights changes colour accordingly. NINTENDO 981 970 QUAKE 194 NOT ALL THERE er HEALTH 100 LOOK! HE'S HERE! ARMOR We always knew that it wouldn't be 200 possible to fit all of Quake onto a AMMO relatively small Nintendo 64 cartridge, and the final version has FRAGE a fair few features missing. First of all, seven levels have been removed entirely (still leaving 25), HOALIH and practically every other one has 100 been cut down. Normally these DEMOR cuts are fairly small things like secret sections or unnecessary AMMO rooms, and they don't really affect the levels. Also, some of the larger FRAGS areas have been reduced in size. The most noticeable times are when tall rooms or buildings have The Ring of Shadows power-up makes a player translucent been shrunk, just as they were in and very hard to see.

"computer video games NINTENDO 64 FEEL YOUR HANDS QUAKE As with most Nintendo 64 games, Quake is compatible with the Rumble Pak. Every time you fire the pad shakes, and getting hit by grenades almost hurts for real. The foul Shub-Niggurath! Don't look at her or you'll go maaaad! You'll really feel this with a Rumble Pak! Don't worry about the Fiend and Ogre above the Shambler, they're fighting one another and don't care about you. + MONSTER MASH      One technique which can come in extremely to watch! Two monsters of the same race won't useful when playing on Hard or Nightmare fight, except for the humans (they'll kill difficulty is getting the baddies to fight among anything), but it's still a trick worth using. If you themselves. If one creature gets hit accidentally meet an Ogre, get another enemy between you by another, it'll fight back. A battle to the death and him and there's a good chance that a stray normally follows, which is both useful and fun grenade will start them fighting. CVA OPINION I was very impressed to find how close Nintendo 64 Quake is to the original PC game. Everything moves in pretty much the same way, and even little tricks such as the rocket jump are possible. The lack of levels is a bit disappointing, and it's a shame that some of the new features of the Saturn game weren't included (such as real-time coloured lighting and extra secret levels). Quake 64's graphics are very impressive there's lots of detail, the new lights look good (but a little TOO colourful at times) and it all moves around very smoothly. One point make sure you turn off the 'Filter' option as it makes everything look very fuzzy otherwise. Two-player mode is fun, but the 3D stick doesn't let you turn as quickly as is often needed. Although you can only play with two people, the excellent level design makes Quake a good alternative to Goldeneye for deathmatches. This game has everything going for it, except the N64 already has a brilliant selection of one-player corridor games, so Quake isn't going to stand out from the crowd as it should, no matter how great it is. EN LOMAS The bases are packed full of zombie human guards waiting to be gibbed. REVIEW Get the Quad Damage and use the Super Shotgun to blow enemies into meaty chunks of flesh. You also get a satisfying gurgling noise as they die. RATING RATING A brilliant version of one of the best games ever. Everyone should play this game at some time in their life. 60 "

If you come across a small plume of swirling light tucked away in the corner of a level, walk into it (note, the cool lighting) and you should see your crystal count decrease but your overall energy count increase. Obviously, you can only trade energy for crystals providing you have them in your possession, so making a bit of an effort to get a hidden stash could be worth your troubles. USING THE PICK AXE 72 The good thing about Pitfall is that you are constantly thinking whether or not you've covered all the areas in the level. While there is only one real route to a particular stage, the branches and splits in the path often lead to The main weapon Harry Jnr has is the pick axe. He power ups, life, or that all-important energy uses this to attack, and as an aid for getting recharge point. It's well worth exploring across difficult chasms and gaps. When you come because you may well find secret rooms or across hooks suspended in mid-air, all you have to caverns too. Scouting all angles is essential do is jump onto them and Harry hooks himself on the later stages because switches onto the rail. From here you use the axe in a simirequired to trigger, say, the power generators lar way to a vine, in that you swing backwards and are located in the far reaches of the stages. forwards to gain a bit of momentum then jump off.

"ARE YOU A GLADIATOR? YYYY computer Video games There are only three boss characters in Pitfall, but they are an impressive bunch. Take Gladiator, for example, who is the first boss you face. Harry is flung into a room full of Lucense, a gas with levitational properties which is the focal element of the game. Harry, must float around the room and fill it with the gas so that Gladiator asphyxiates. However, if Harry takes too long to finish him off, Gladiator pulls the plug draining the entire arena! Doh! .ys.ito It's difficult enough to control Harry Jnr on the gas itself, let alone avoid laser beams and a boss! | 00 DA BOMB 00 Harry Jnr also has a couple of special weapons that can be collected. They are usually found under barrels and crates that you need to smash, and look like small jars. Pressing the Triangle button cycles though items you've collected, and the Circle button uses them. You can pick up small shields which circle your body, acting as protection, bombs and energy power ups. You climb into this machine to defeat the second boss. You only have a few shots to fire, and once they are spent, Harry is ejected from the hotseat and you have to do it again! ORIGINAL AND BEST For all the Retro freaks out there, you'll be pleased to know that you can play the original Pitfall game as a secret bonus. We won't reveal how to do it just yet, but in all honesty, having something like this is pretty pointless and serves only as a novelty. CVG OPINION 1872 II 19:38 The first time I played this I was very impressed the initial stages seemed imaginative and were just the right difficulty. Then it all seemed to go a little downhill. Pitfall is still a fun enough game, but it got too frustrating and repetitive to play for any length of time. The camera perspective often proves really annoying, as you think you're making a normal jump onto a ledge, but end up crashing to the floor in a heap of death. Some of the textures on the levels can be deceiving too, as you think you're jumping onto a solid ledge but it turns out to be part of the background. I really was looking forward to playing this, but ended up getting frustrated and wanting to switch it off.

Burning Rangers has grown on me in exactly the same way as NIGHTS did. For the first day I didn't know what was going on at all, the graphics looked ropey and it all seemed very small and boring. But once I finished it and realised how little of the game I'd actually seen, really got into it. Although the graphics can make it hard to see what's going on the game is very stylish. The look and feel is great, and there are loads of brilliant little touches such as the way rescued survivors send «thank you\" letters. It's amazing when you come to play the game through for a second time and realise that parts are different, but after that it changes every time, always giving you something different to do. True, the graphics do often look a mess, and they do slow down at times, but once you get into the game they're not important.

Yes, Crystal Dynamics' infamous gecko is back, in a by-the-numbers attempt to bring Super Mario 64-style action to the PlayStation. t takes a lot of courage for a widely-loathed game character to attempt a comeback. To our minds, Gex was stuck at the bottom of a very tall pile, being propped up by other alsorans. If any character was to take on the mighty Mario 64, we would never have considered Gex for the prime candidate. Yet the green-skinned wonder has pulled off the almost impossible task of stealing the best parts of Mario's groundbreaking adventure and getting away with it. Enter a 3D world, with numerous pop culture references, as a new and improved Gex enters the Media Dimension once again. GEY TM ENTER THE  THE GECKO OOO OL' SQUARE EYES IS BACK OO GEX ENTERE GECKO The aim of the game is simple: locate remote controls time Gex is working for the government. OK, so they in various worlds inspired by TV shows and movies. This offered him a load of cash, but the clincher was a land is called the Media Dimension, and Gex has been secret agent suit. Get ready to walk on walls, and chew transported here to do battle against the evil Rez. This bugs, 'cos the gecko is back. Z. 46 A GECKO MAN DOES WHATEVER A GECKO CAN @OR Being a gecko. Gex has some very special abilities. The most impressive of these is the ability to walk up walls, and even on ceilings. He can only do this in certain places however, otherwise this would be a very easy game. He also attacks bounce on a jump, allowing Gex to reach higher his enemies, not by jumping on them, but with a platforms. If he can't quite make a jump, he'll whip of his tail, a bit like Crash Bandicoot's spin sometimes lash out his tongue, which makes attack. His tail can also be used to gain extra him cling on the edge of the platform. REVIEW 1 He has a habit of doing this. 1 Spin that tail now Gexy. 1 Hmm, major tongue action. 1 Plus lots of platforms too. 68 "


"computer video games 000HHHHH HELLLO000! No pun is too corny for Gex, and whenever it's vaguely appropriate he lays one on you. Lucky for us he's got over 500 different lines of dia logue, or we'd be reaching for the mute button a lot quicker than he'd like. It's also lucky that Crystal Dynamics hired a Brush comic actor, Leslie Phillips, to deliver these puns. This transforms the turn-off factor of the original Gex witticisms into 'turn-on' fun. PlayStation GOLD COINS ARE FOR WIMPS Mario had coins and stars to find in his quest, Gex locates 'collectibles' and remote controls. Collectibles serve the same purpose as coins. In Gex, they are different depending on the level, and how many you've collected. For example, in the Kung-Fu levels, you need to find 30 noodle boxes to receive an extra life, and then you have to start collecting a different kind of object. Collect 40 of these and you earn another life. The final collectibles on this level are Kabuki masks, and once you've collected 50 of these you earn a silver remote control. When you've reached that target you can keep collecting to earn yet more extra lives. Oh Gexzilla! There's a mean robot to beat in this boss level. 0 0 FIND THE CHANNEL CHANGERS The Media Dimension is split into many themed areas. Each one takes after a particular style of movie or TV show. You'll encounter Sci-fi, horror and cartoon levels, plus many more. A certain number of remote controls are hidden in each world. These are indicated above the monitors which transport Gex to the action. As you enter a level, you are shown a clue, and sometimes the location of a remote control. The standard remote to search for is red. Collect enough of these and you'll gain access to boss levels, and open up gates that take you to deeper sections of the game. Remote controls are essential for opening later levels, so to go everywhere in the game, you have to do some major exploring. ENTER THE GECKO SZ CVG OPINION REMOTE REMOTES As well as the regular remotes, each level contains two silver remotes. One is hidden somewhere and the other is gained by gathering the third set of collectibles. Collect three silver remotes and you open up a bonus level. Best of all are the gold remotes which you get by completing a task on a bonus level or defeating a boss. Collect four of these to open a secret level. This is a genuine 'Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough' assault on Mario 64. It steals the game's dynamics completely, but everything else is pure Gex. Leslie Phillips, with his distinctive voice, is a revelation. He adds humour to the game as opposed to nuisance value. The levels are well thought out, with some touches of originality, and with so many remotes and rewards to collect, this is a lasting challenge. The learning curve is excellent, just like in Mario 64, and while there may be a few graphical shortcomings when compared to Nintendo's masterpiece, Gex proves a worthy challenger. In the past the gecko has had the reputation for being a dud character in a dud game, but this is sure to change players' opinions. ALEX HUTALA TV'S ARE YOUR FRIENDS Besides searching for remotes and collectibles, Gex must also keep an eye out for TV screens. These offer health power-ups, extra lives, fire and ice attacks, plus small periods of invincibility. There are also some very useful TVs which act as a restart point when Gex croaks. These are usually only found in places that are very tricky to reach. REVIEW RATING RATING Mario beware: the opposition has finally caught up! An amazing comeback with humour, gameplay and great graphics. Crash Bandicoot, your time is up! 69 "

Stand aside for the naughty little boy... Real ascal. That's not a good name to call a kid, but that's the main character in this game a little guy who wears a backwards baseball cap and wraparound shades in an attempt to look cool. Rascal has a reputation for causing trouble, usually when he's out on his skateboard. But here, in his very own game, he's out to make amends. And it's all because of his Dad and the evil timelord Chronon, but we'll get to that later. You can bet Rascal is gonna save the day. Armed only with a bubble gun, it's up to him to right all the wrongs, and get his Dad back to the future... er no, make that back to the present! ASGAT Tvos ON 8 CHRONON AND CLOCKWISE REVIEW All was going well for Rascal, playing around on his skateboard, when these two little men turned up. This is shown in the opening title sequence, which sets the scene for the rest of the game. Rascal is genuinely startled, and after some nifty footwork, he evades these strange creatures. He runs to his father's laboratory, searching for answers, only to see his Dad (Casper Clockwise) confronted by something hideous the evil Chronon. A flick of the Professor's latest invention causes both of them to vanish. Now Rascal's got a big problem the invention was a time travel machine and his Dad could be anywhere. All that remains after the pair vanish is a bubble gun, something Rascal knows will help him. With a deep breath, he jumps into the time bubble in the hope of bringing back his Dad. 70 "


"IT ALL SEEMS, RASCAL VS CROC... FIGHT! computer Video games FAMILIAR TM PlayStation The play with time travel conjures up some nice surprises. As each location is visited in the different time periods, things start to change. For example, one level, The Jolly Raider Pirate Ship, is centred on the fine vessel captained by the dread captain Peg Lee Pete. The first time you see the ship, it's seaworthy, well known and feared in every port. But when you visit the same site in the present, the boat lies shipwrecked at the bottom of the ocean. A further surprise lies in the future as the ship is again on dry land, in the middle of a scorching desert. In all future zones, Rascal must face the evil Chronon. Every level has neat little tricks like this, so it's worth paying close attention to each new location. From this brief introduction, it's safe to assume that Rascal is aimed at the younger gamer. Much in the same vein as Croc, but sadly nowhere near the complexity and ingenuity of a Mario title. The controls are simple, you've got only directions, jump and shoot to worry about. The main game consists of searching for missing segments which, when collected, form a time bubble, allowing you to pass to a new time zone. Finding these segments can be quite tricky. They are hidden in the large levels, and once you've collected them all, you've still got to locate the time bubble. Add keys required to open doors, falling objects, hazardous falls and flames and Rascal has got a lot of problems to worry about. We're not even mentioning the life forms that also patrol each level. 4x+3y-Z Aascal The obligatory mine cart level, steer Rascal past some boulders! os That's the little fella's bedroom. Looks way too big for him. CVG OPINION I'LL PUT A SPELL ON YOU The pirate ship in the past and the sunken present. Chronon has already visited each of the locations and time zones that Rascal must venture through, and has put all the inhabitants of these places under an evil spell. They now all answer to him. The first place you visit is Castle Hackalott, renowned for its famous dragon Gordon the Good-Natured. The problem is, though, Gordon is now under Chronon's spell, so the \"good-natured\" dragon could cause you some damage. There are many more creatures like Gordon you'll meet on your travels, especially as Rascal must travel to such exotic places as the land of the Aztecs, the Wild West and even the Corridors of Time itself. This is where the game becomes quite innovative. For although there may only be six locations in the game, each must be visited three times in the past, present and future. Lucky for Rascal he has access to a time travel machine. When it comes to looks, it's pretty hard to knock Rascal. But in most other areas there's something sadly missing. First of all, where are the controls? Jump and shoot, that's all you've got. As a result, Rascal is limited. The biggest crime in Rascal concerns the camera angles. The view sweeps around when you enter a room, the trouble is you can never quite position it where you want, and there's also no first person viewpoint (something that a 3D platformer should never omit). Also, where's the music? Every game hero has some sort of theme and semi-memorable tunes. But here the music is simply forgettable. This is clearly aimed at the younger players, and like Croc before it, will no doubt do well. It seems though, that this game hasn't lived up to its full potential. Why sell yourself short by appealing to a younger age group when you could do a Mario' and attract all? ALEX 4WATALA REVIEW RATING OU The Wild West becomes a movie set in the present. Rascal is about to eat lead. This gangster wanders around the movie set. For the younger gamer and no-one else. Amazing graphics but simplistic controls. Sadly, a frustrating and below-average game. 71 "

Now Wario's got to run around the place trying to find it. That's the simple set up for this simple sequel to one of the Game Boy's top platformers. The basic idea is to collect coins to buy clues in a puzzle game at the end of each level. Fifty coins get you one clue in the puzzle, which requires Wario to guess a number that's partially hidden. If you win, you earn a prize that goes toward revealing a bigger picture. There's another puzzle game hidden on each level, a simple matching pairs game. Complete it and Wario wins back a piece of his stolen treasure. That's the overall objective, but each level also has a specific goal, like finding an alarm clock or turning off a tap, and making things difficult throughout are a variety of witchcraftempowered enemies. They can molest Wario with a variety of strange magic spells, making him fat, hot, crazy and even turning him into a zombie. The clever bit is that Wario can use each of these to his advantage in certain circumstances, so, for example when he's fat he can break blocks and defeat enemies he couldn't before, and when he's a zombie he can fall through floors. That's about all you need to know, apart from the fact that the game has a variety of different endings, and the one you get depends on how many coins and pieces of treasure you collect on the journey. This is a solid platforming adventure with plenty to do, and loads of secrets to find, but it has one major flaw it's very easy. Wario is invincible(!) which reduces the challenge somewhat, and makes this one of the few colo platform games where you don't have to worry about tough jumps. In fact the only thing the enemies can do to make your life harder is steal coins. But in spite of the low skill level this is still a DTBEEBIBE) quality little game, and younger players and the hardcore Mario/Wario fans should really enjoy it.

PUZZLE $$ Playstation KULA WORLD PlayStation OUT MAY ERDE BY GAME DESIGN 1-2 PLAYERS his puzzle game must qualify as one of the most bizarre ever, but at least the objective is simple enough. You have to move your ball around floating 3D mazes, collecting keys to unlock the door to the next stage before the time runs out, Collect five bits of fruit before you exit and you'll be transported to a bonus stage, then on to the next level where even more obsta cles appear to try and stop you. Spikes will puncture the ball if you touch them, pills speed up the clock but slow you down, and the moving enemies capture you if you stray too close to them. Rotating the maze gives you access to some of the more difficult ore difficult. to-reach sections, and jumping down a level is also a tactic to bear in mind.

The same could be said of the sequel, which has come out in time to challenge Gremlin's Motorhead... and just loses out. Kalisto have done a fair job on the graphics (which also work without a 3D accelerator), although 1-16 PLAYERS there's the occasional dodgy translucency effect, but Motorhead looks far more flash.

"computer video games THEY'RE CRRRRRRRRATE! AVE You'll notice that there are crates in some of the screenshots of Ehrgeiz. These can be used in a few ways you can jump onto them to avoid attacks, you can hurl them across the arena and into your opponent, or you can smash them to find extra power-ups. These range from extra weapons to potions which restore life and increase the strength of your attacks. SASUKE Yes, it's a strange name and yes, it's got some strange features for a fighting game. But it also happens to be one of the best games in the arcade right now. GOD BLESS THE RING FIGHTING GAME BY DREAM FACTORY OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS H ASIEN NTERRUPT!  PLAYSTATION VERSION RUMOURED  DISTRIBUTED BY NAMCO  UNKNOWN SYSTEM  TWO-PLAYER CABINET EHRGET Een eerste consible for EHRGEIZ TM NASEEM POGODANI EHRGEIZ SQUARESOFT'S BRILLIANT NEW FIGHTING GAME! hrgeiz is developed by Dream Factory, the team responsible for the fantastic Japanese adventure/fighting game, Tobal 2. This time around, the Squaresoft developers have worked with Namco to produce one of the most exciting combat games ever made for the arcade! It takes many of the excellent ideas used in Tobal 2 and adds even more speed and interesting techniques. Now that the game is appearing in arcades all around the country, we're going to tell you why it's so great. Pay attention. As you can see, Ehrgeiz's graphics are great, especially when the view zooms in close to the fighters like this. Learn to use the crates to your advantage, or smash them open to get hold of handy power-ups. THE ARENAS OF DEATH ENRUEL The fights in Ehrgeiz take place in a selection of varied and impressive backgrounds. Like Virtua Fighter 3, these are irregularly shaped arenas with floors of different levels and walls surrounding most sections. Because of the control system it's possible to run anywhere you want with ease, even jumping and climbing to higher ground to get away from certain attacks. It's worth trying out all of the stages to find your favourite as the current challenger gets to choose the next battleground. After slamming into a wall, you can bounce back at your opponent with an attack. Wow! GOD BLESS THE EHRGEIZ ARCADE 76 "


"O THE EHR-GUYS computer video games B Ehrgeiz has eight main playable characters from the start, each with their own unique fighting style, selection of moves and occasionally weapon. Here's a brief introduction to each: SASUKE HOOLS WHAT DOES WHAT? One of the things that makes Ehrgeiz stand out is the way that the controls work. Each character has a massive selection of moves, many of which are very easy to figure out and use. Here are the basic controls: AGE: Unknown NATIONALITY: Japanese SEX: Male OCCUPATION: Future Ninja SPECIAL ATTACK: Shuriken, Katana, Enmaku, Makibishi LEE SHUWEN JOYSTICK Pushing the stick in any direction makes your character run that way. This keeps the fights extremely fast and means that it's very easy to get out of a tight spot. AGE: about 47 NATIONALITY: Chinese SEX: Male OCCUPATION: Martial Artist Murderer SPECIAL ATTACK: Long Spear (A) GUARD Holding the Guard button causes a small defensive barrier to appear around your character, though it's still possible to move around the ring. You can also make yourself crouch with the Guard button. HAN DAEHAN (B) LOWER ATTACK As you'd expect, a low attack normally a kick of some description. AGE: 23 NATIONALITY: Korean SEX: Male OCCUPATION: Action Movie Star SPECIAL ATTACK: Missiles (C) UPPER ATTACK Normally a punch or high kick. Both of the standard attacks are easy to link together into combos. INOBA od GOREANA (D) SPECIAL ATTACK This makes your characters perform one of their unique moves, often some sort of fireball. AGE: 38 NATIONALITY: Japanese SEX: Male OCCUPATION: Pro-wrestler SPECIAL ATTACK: Pro-wrestling arts Pressing Guard and either standard attack button gives you a more powerful move; Guard and Special makes you jump and the Guard, Lower and Upper Attack buttons together initiates a throw. This system works brilliantly, and makes Ehrgeiz play unlike any other game. EHRGEIZ SQUARESOFT'S BRILLIANT NEW FIGHTING GAME! YOKO 100 W GODHAND AGE: 17 NATIONALITY: Japanese SEX: Female OCCUPATION: ICPO Agent SPECIAL ATTACK: Yo-yo AGE: 26 NATIONALITY: Japanese SEX: Male OCCUPATION: Ex-Mercenary.

This is a weird one. It looks as though Psygnosis have recycled most of Colony Wars, taken out the dodgy story bits and the Star Trek reject spaceships and turned out a really cool, Old Skool, space shoot. 'em-up. Of course, we say 'Old Skool', but the Old Skool never looked this good. Once again, Psygnosis demonstrate their talent for PlayStation pyrotechnics with dazzling laser effects and explosions, and the backgrounds and starships look just as slick. The interplanetary spaceways are swarming with starfighters, freighters and battlecruisers that look like they've been inspired by the work of 70s airbrush artists like Chris Foss. The action itself is a simple case of blasting as many enemy ships as your mission requires, getting home and counting the COD25000 credits you've racked up. Next time out you can spend them on new weapons for your ship and do even more damage. There are 31 missions in the game and you often get a choice of two to try next, so there are numerous routes through the game. If that isn't enough to keep you occupied, you can always convince a mate to lug his gear round to your house for a head-to-head spaceborne deathmatch. Now there's something you don't see much of these days.

Execution-style killing! Stealth is the key as you go through the various missions rescuing and killing people. An on-screen indicator lets you know when you've been spotted by any guards, but you should really try to stay well out of their way. If you need to, you can creep up behind them and slit their throats before they even know you're around. You also get a choice of items like shurikens, caltrops, and smoke grenades. Your ninja also uses a grappling hook to reach rooftops and other high areas. A UK release doesn't look too likely for this interesting action game, but we'll keep you posted. 00:20:98 * "

The answer to that question is this: they 'do' Incoming. This game takes advantage of pretty much all of the latest PC hardware and software technology to create a 3D shoot-'emup so impressive that companies like 3Dfx have been using it to demonstrate to other game developers what their 3D cards can do. Now it's close to completion and there's no denying that it LOOKS utterly gorgeous. The idea is to defend your bases from enemy attack from behind the controls of an air defence gun turret, a helicopter gunship and a tank. In all game modes the graphics are wonderful; smooth, shiny, detailed craft roam over the realistic-looking landscape just waiting to be turned into burning fireballs by a well-placed rocket, complete with smoke trail.

Pick your team according to their skills, arm them up with heavy artillery, then control them all individually throughout the mission. It's a bit like Syndicate meets Command and Conquer, but with some quite slick 3D environments. Yes, very interesting. Quite looking forward to this one. Battlezone, never heard of it? a change of pace, there's also a more strategic game variation which gives you a plan view of your base and lets you assign units to see off waves of invaders attacking from different directions.

Well, we like your style, and so, probably, do Activision. In May they'll be releasing the first official Quake 2 mission pack, dubbed 'The Reckoning'. This adds a set of new single-player missions set in a moonbase and an enemy spacecraft, as well as a selection of extra deathmatch levels for 32-plus-player battles. The pack also adds several new enemies as well as three new weapons, a particle shotgun, a high-powered plasma accelerator and an energy trap that catches enemies and turns them into extra health. Though Xatrix have done the coding and design, id Software have given the pack their approval, so the office Quake 2 junkies are expecting something really special. Expert opinion, next month.

There are a few changes from the Saturn and arcade versions. For a start, there are two new characters. One, Bass, is a lot like Hulk Hogan a bandanna-wearing wrestler with loads of throws and slaps. The other is a girl who is only accessed after a bit of play. Some backgrounds have been redesigned for the PlayStation, and there are no Ring Outs any more. Instead, all the stages go on infinitely like those in Tekken. The graphics are excellent, with big high-resolution characters who move very smoothly. As anyone who's played Dead Or Alive in the arcade will know, it plays NEW GAMES a lot like Virtua Fighter 2, with plenty of counters and fast-paced combination attacks. And the feature which will appeal to most PlayStation owners? Big, bouncing breasts. 79 "


"(BOARD GAME PENDO 64 ON A BY TITUS 80% COMPLETE computer video games FIGHTING SIM DO CANEL BY SQUARE SOFT COMPLETE OUT APRIL 1-4 PLAYERS TBA RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS PlayStation VIRTUAL CHESS BUSHIDO BLADE 2 he first game has only been out in the UK for a few months and the sequel is already available in Japan. The game is very similar to the first, but has a selection of new features such as the ability to use more than one weapon at a time. The graphics are slightly improved and it's all been sped up a bit to make the fights a bit more action-packed. A UK release will probably depend on the success of the first game, and as yet hasn't been confirmed. 08980 12B ou probably didn't buy an N64 to play Virtual Chess, but, hey, there's no denying that it's a timeless strategy game, and if the opponent Al is clever enough it can make a brilliant video game. On PC, Titus' Virtual Chess has won two world championships, so there's no questioning the power of its algorithms, and for the N64 version the basic game has been tarted up with a 3D graphics mode, a variety of chess sets (including 'Viking Tribe vs Kingdom of the Knights'), and even 3D animations which play whenever a piece is captured. There's even a four-player mode so you can have two one-on-one games going simultaneously! And if you don't know one end of a pawn from the other, the game even gives you interactive chess lessons. If there's a chess sim that offers more we ain't seen it, so watch out for it, you crazy 'chess fiends'. GUESSION NOT KNOW HOW THE 2222 Play as the ARP warden from Dad's Army! New-look POV Mode.

Following hot on Klonoa's furry heels comes Tomba, a sort of cave-guy (perhaps a distant cousin of Joe and Mack from the ancient Caveman Ninjas) who is on a AP 1100 mission to... well, we haven't quite worked that one out yet. However, we do know it requires jumping on piggy guards and wrestling them into submis. sion, smashing dino-bird eggs to retrieve chicks, as well as solving numerous bizarre problems and clambering, swinging and jumping over outlandish obstacles. Like Klonoa, the scenery scrolls left and right, but it's actually multi-layered so you can go into or out of the screen to explore hidden areas. The level also changes direction every now and then, and you get to see that the flat scenery is actually a three-dimensional playfield. Interesting, but it looks a bit more junior gamer' than even Klonoa. Still, we won't hold that against it in the forthcoming review.
