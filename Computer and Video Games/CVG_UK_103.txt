"TEENAGE MUTANT HERO GAME It had to happen, didn't it? After all, they've got their own comic books, toys, tee-shirts and even a cartoon series. Who are we talking about? Of course, it's those heroes in a half-shell, the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, who are about to get their very own computer game, courtesy of Konami. It's NOT going to be a conversion of the highly popular coin-op, though the programmers are instead converting the Nintendo version of TMHT (which is reviewed in the fantastic Complete Guide To Consoles Book II) to the Amiga, C64 and PC. We'll have a lot more Hero Turtle news next month, so watch this space. ELITE SEGA CONVERTS ARNIE 'N' BILLY Well, looky here! Elite, who until recently had pretty much shunned the licensing game, are back with a vengeance with the signing of three Sega titles Last Battle, Tournament Golf and World Championship Soccer. Last Battle isn't what one could call a particularly good Megadrive game it's a tepid scrolling beat 'em up in which you guide the futuristic hero through reams of baddies, smacking them about along the way. The other two, however, are graphically excellent and very playable sports simulations. Release dates are set for October. ow 13:00 FRE ITA 0-1 Arnold Schwarzenegger is back Ocean are obviously very pleased that he is, because they've just signed up his new movie and are, as we write, programming the computer game! The film, called Total Recall, is about a mission to Mars which goes disastrously wrong, leaving Arnie to go up and sort things out, paving the way for violence-a-plenty (surprise surprise!) as the ex-Mr Universe takes on alien fiends and dangerous robots. Sounds as though it could convert into a shoot and beat 'em up of dynamic proportions! Ocean have also teamed up with ex-adventure writers Level 9 to produce a game based on the rootin' tootin', sharp-shootin' Billy The Kid, in which you control either Billy, his best mate Pat Garrett, or a desperado with a heart of gold. It'll have everything which makes a good western shootouts, bank robberies, busty.barmaids and bar-room brawls when it arrives on the Amiga, ST and PC. "

Which means that, not only will you get to take on the roles of national heroes like \"Battling\" Bryan Robson, Paul \"Gazza\" Gascoine and John \"John\" Barnes, you'll also be able to dip into the players' pool should one of your first-team members be crocked, and stand in the training shoes of everyone's favourite manager, Bobby Robson. All the international teams will be graded according to recent form, so you may have a bit of a tough time against the likes of West Germany but, if the recent friendly is anything to go by, you could give the Czechs a right old stuffing!

The game follows the plot of the film in which police officer John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, has to rescue his wife from a gang of terrorists who are attempting to nick billions of dollars worth of bearer bonds, locked in the vault of a skyscraper. The PC version features super-fast, filled vector graphics and loads of gun-toting action will the 64 game do the same? All will be revealed, when we Update C64 Die Hard as soon as we receive it!

"SEGA MICRODRIVETHE PIC! can tell, Microdrive was only a working title and, judging by what's written on the casing, it seems likely that the portable is now called the Game Gear. Measuring just 103x210x38mm, the Game Gear is controlled by a Z-80A processor (as used in the Spectum and Amstrad) running at 3.58MHz. Screen size is quite large at just a shade under 3.5 inches and, although that's all we know at present, you can be sure that, as soon as we hear more, you'll be the first to know! We've got it! The first definitive photograph of Sega's fantastic new Microdrive hand-held machine! As far as we 11Bài 3M THA SELA GAMEGEAR PHASERS ON FUN, MR SULU After the vaguely jolly Spectrum and Amstrad Light Phasers, Magnum have launched a similar gun for the 64, complete with five compatible software titles. The games, which come on both cassette and disk in the same box, are Operation Wolf, Gunslinger, Ghost Town, Goose Busters and Baby Blues. The whole kit-and-caboodle weighs in at a pretty reasonable .99 and, if you get hold of the pack before 15th June, you can enter the competition found in the box, giving you the chance to win .00 worth of records, tapes and CD's woooh! And there's some bottom-spankingly good news for owners of the Speccy and CPC guns, too. The Megaplay Bundle, which currently retails at .99 and consists of Bronx Street Cop, F16 Fighting Falcon, American Turbo King. Billy The kid and Jungle Warfare, has been slashed to a ridiculously inexpensive .99. VROOM! VROOM! Look out this month for the release of a brand new game from ThalamusQ8 Team Ford Rally Simulation. Based on the exploits of the team of the same name, the game puts you will in control of an ultra-fast Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4, ripping up the roads as you attempt to beat the clock, and other drivers, and become number one in the rally stakes. The game will feature \"stylised\" filled-in vector graphics, running at a nippy fifty frames per second to give what should be a very accurate illusion of driving through mud, trees and all those other obstacles you find on rally circuits. You can even plough into the spectators! Q8 Team Ford Rally will be appearing on ST, Amiga, Spectrum/SAM Coupe, C64 and Amstrad (fluffy dice and Blaupunkt car stereo not included). "

"SALES CURVE LATEST SCINE 19843.00 RRE 02 km/h While we wait eagerly for Sales Curve's SWIV (which, they point out, doesn't stand for Silkworm IV, even if it looks like it), news reaches us of their other forthcoming conversions of Jaleco coin-ops which will be making his tory late this year and early on in '91. The most imminent title is the conversion of Saint Dragon, a mighty shoot 'em up starring a cybernetic flying lizard, and that's penciled-in for a September release date. Next year, we should see conversions of Rod-Land and Big Run. The first is a dead cute platform game in which you play either Tam or Rit, two fairies with magic wands and a mission to pick flowers. Sounds very weird, but looks very good. Big Run, in case you didn't know, is a sporty drive through the desert on the Paris-Dakar rally. It didn't break any records in it's original arcade form, so it'll be interesting to see how the conversion will come out. All three games will be released under the auspices of Sales Curve's new Storm label, and will be available for Amiga, ST, Amstrad, Spectrum and C64. CORE! A NEW SOFTWARE HOUSE TWO LICENSES IN ONE I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE. California Games is one of the best multi-event sports games ever to appear on a home computer, and it's certainly the best sport sim seen on the Sega Master System. That's why Epyx and US Gold have got together again to produce a sequel. California Games Il will feature over half a dozen new events, all played out against a sunny California backdrop. It will be released in late Autumn but will you get a free beach babe with each package? Remember we previewed World Cup Soccer '90 from Virgin two issues ago? Well, scrub that title because that's not what its going to be called. What Virgin have done is, as well as buying the rights to the coin-op. they've also gone out and signed up the Italia '90 name from FIFA, and stuck that on the packaging, too! Sheesh, must have more money than sense, eh? Anyway, the game is to be called World Cup Soccer Italia '90, and it'll be the only football game this summer to carry the little World Cup stick-man mascot on its packaging. Ooooh! Core Design, creators of such greats as Rick Dangerous and Dynamite Dux, have come to the conclusion that there's more money to be made by selling their own games as opposed to just programming them and passing them along to a third party outfit. So those Derbyshire dudes have set up shop, so to speak, and are going it alone, with a couple of titles already announced. Torvak The Warrior is a beat 'em up in which the player must battle through five levels in h and defeat the wicked Necromancer, while Corporation will be a much more strategy-orientated game, as you become a government agent, seeking out terrorists in a robotics factory. These, along with three other as yet unannounced products, are to be released between July and December of this year. More news as it arrives! palabras "

Whereas previous games of the genre have relied on a semi-3D, birds-eye view of the court showing two solid players, International 3D Tennis utilises a revolutionary three dimensional display which can be twisted and turned to access a number of different camera views.

I've never been a big computer tennis fan apart from the ages-old Match Point on the Spectrum. Most have been lacking in either presentation or gameplay, or sometimes both. International 3D Tennis on the other hand, is a breakthrough both in tennis simulations and C64 programming in general. No-one could fail to be impressed by the awesome graphics system the stick-man players may look basic in these static screenshots, but when you see them moving about, hitting the ball and even shaking hands at the end of a match it's real eye-popping stuff. Another fantastic feature is the stack of different camera views which you're able to access, from vertical and side displays to a longrange shot of the whole centre-court stadium! Playability, though, is the most important factor of any game, and International 3D Tennis has it in abundance. The amount of control which you possess over shots is staggering you can spin the ball in a variety of directions, choose whether to serve automatically or manually and of course, depending on the height and position of incoming balls you can play all of the real tennis moves such as backhands and lobs. International 3D Tennis may sound complicated and, for a while, it is.

Working out contracts is crucial promise too many fights in a year and you may find yourself struggling to keep those promises, which in turn means the loss of a fighter to a rival manager. The fight sequence is imaginatively done and instead of seeing the two boxers slug it out onscreen, you're informed of the action by two commentators. This might sound a bit on the dull side, but it does work and is actually informative because the commentary gives you hints as to which areas your boy needs extra training in. World Championship Boxing Manager may not have the blood, sweat and tears of the real fight game, but it more than makes up for that in terms of playability and longterm addictive qualities.

"AMIGA REVIEW WIIIIII UZNI A UP PERSIAN GULF INFERNO Smm PISTOL BY MAGIC BYTES Terrorism has been growing steadily more widespread and daring over the past decade. Bombs, assassinations and other such unsavoury practices have become an unfortunate fact of life. But never before has the world been in such a grip as now. One of the organisations most active in the international violence game is reported to have stolen a nuSPAS FRANCHI 12 SHOTGUN GUN MAGS: 1 MAGS: 5 MAGS: 55 A Find the armoury and you can collect some hefty firepower. Another terrorist gets his. VIIIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 Crikey, what a spiffing little game this is! Persian Gulf Inferno is packed with shoot 'em up action a-plenty, as you storm around the oil platform, killing terrorists and collecting new guns with which to perform your massacre antics. The character sprites are small, but well animated and, when you choose to use a new weapon such as the shotgun or Uzi, the respective gun can be clearly seen in your sprite's hands. All of the sound effects in the game are sampled, and they work really well foo, especially the shouts of the terrorists as they appear on-screen. But this isn't just a lesson in international liaising there's a job to do, and with only five lives and thirty-five minutes to complete your assigned task, you'll find time very tight indeed. Persian Gulf Inferno isn't the sort of game which you'll be playing well into the night for weeks on end in fact, its long-term qualities are very questionable indeed. However, I've enjoyed playing it because it's fast-moving and fun, so if you've got a bit of spare dosh left over from Easter, you could do worse than take a butchers at Persian Gulf Inferno.

It was only a matter of time before they would put their terrifying new toy to use, and that time is now. The terrorists have overrun the newest oil platform in the Persian Gulf and are threatening to detonate the warhead, killing themselves, their halfdozen hostages and a quarter of the population of the southern hemisphere in the process. And guess who's just received a phone call from an anxious President asking for a one man army to go in, rescue the hostages and defuse the bomb? With just an eightshot revolver for company, you have to race around the multi-level platform, searching rooms for weapons, explosive charges, door passes and, of course, captive rig workers. Once you've released the hostages it's time to go and find that nuclear warhead. But be careful, one wrong snipped wire will spell more than a bad headache!

"EVIEW MINIMUM Sound asleep.\" Cor seventeen years, Bobbin Threadbare has been brought up as a low achiever in the Guild Of Weavers on the island of Loom. He was content with his life, despite the Elders' strange insistence that he should not be allowed to attend school or make friends. One day, though, everything was made startlingly clear when he heard his adoptive mother, Hetchel, having an argument with the Elders who settled the disagreement by changing her into a cygnet. From what they were saying, Bobbin surmised that he isn't the dim-wit people want him to believe; he is, in fact, a child of the Loom, pulled out of the Guild's source of magical power, and so poses a threat to the centurieslong grip which the Elders have held over the community. Night time in the graveyard, with only a hungry owl for company Hetcher's Workshop. Her magic spellbook might come in handy BY LUCASFILM/US GOLD Armed from the outset with only a simple Opening spell, Bobbin must travel the world and seek his destiny, aided by the wisdom of his cygnet-mother. Bobbin's quest unfolds before your very eyes in the latest interactive movie from the Lucasfilm stable. While displayed in a similar fashion to the Indy and Zak McKracken games, the programmers have done away with typed commands completely, and a simple click of the mouse over an object or area of the screen is enough to make Bobbin carry out the required action. An unusual feature of the game is the instruction manual it's stored on a cassette and takes the form of a story spoken over a background of suitably spooky, mythical music. book "


"Down at the jelly What's in the clam? REVIEW IIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIII UPDATE Amiga and ST versions of Loom should be appearing at the end of June, but sadly, due to memory restrictions, no other versions are planned. .99 My hopes were high for Loom after the excellent Indy adventure, and the game meets with expectations in almost every way. If anything the graphic style works even better than in the previous titles, with lots of atmospheric (and occasionally rather comical) animation and screens of lavish backdrops. The cut-scenes which make this type of adventure stand out from the crowd are as enjoyable as ever to watch, and the different puzzles, ranging from finding required spells to working out how on earth to get into certain rooms without being hurled out, are taxing without being infuriating. But in spite of all its good points, Loom is marred by one flaw it's just too easy. It took me only one six-hour session to get from beginning to end, as opposed to almost a full day's play in Zak McKracken, and for  I think you should get more for your money. Don't get me wrong Loom is an extremely clever game which at times will have you tearing your hair out in sizeable chunks; trouble is, it's too good you won't want to leave it alone (I missed a lunch hour playing it!) but for a product which looks as though it could go on for ever, Loom is ultimately disappointing just because it's all over so quickly.

The number of warzones is initially disappointing, but when you see the list of scenarios for each one, everything is put into perspective. Each craft has a distinctive flying feel, which means you need to alter your strategy each time you play, and even on the easiest level, the enemy are tough nuts to crack, calling for all your skill and nerve if you want to live to fight another mission. Graphically, LHX is nothing short of outstanding. Each helicopter looks exactly as it should, as do the tanks, choppers and jets, and as well as the usual mountains, bridges, roads and bunkers, the ground detail also extends as far as tents and camels in Libya, men with AK-47s in Vietnam and half-timbered houses in Germany! When you choose a rescue mission, the rescuee even waves his arms in the air to attract your attention! Brilliant though it is, this still isn't the best flight sim available (F15 Strike Eagle Il holds that accolade) but it's the best helicopter sim EVER.

IIIIIIIIIIII UPDATE No other versions are planned. VIIIIIIIIIII ST .99 Ultimate Golf lives up to its title: it's just about the most comprehensive simulation of the sport to date. The easily accessed menu system allows very subtle alterations to every stroke, and the random wind factor adds an extra edge of judgement and skill. The course viewpoints are very quickly drawn and quite detailed but dividing the terrain into grid sections gives the game an artificial touch. This isn't the only fault: the caddy (if you use him) has a habit of thinking for too long; and the ball movement, though mostly accurate, occasionally feels awkward, particularly when putting large distances. These are minor drawbacks, though: the game system is unsurpassed in its flexibility you can change everything from opening the face of the club to the viewpoint all of which can alter the game significantly. It's not as much fun as Leaderboard, but it's a far more accurate simulation and should appeal to armchair pitch and putt fans looking for something a bit more demanding.

It cho bn VIIIIIIIIII SEGA .95 I'm one of the many Sega owners who own a light gun, and must admit to being pretty disappointed at the amount of games available for it. Or rather, the lack of them. However, Operation Wolf goes a long way to redeeming that deficiency it's by far the best light gun game I've ever seen! In fact I'd go so far to say that it's almost worth buying a light gun for!! It's a tense game which requires very sharp reflexes to survive as you blast your way through an entire enemy army. These guys chuck everything at you armoured cars, helicopters, snipers, gunboats, paratroopers... If there's one game that'll leave your trigger finger quivering with exhaustion it's this! Arcade fanatics will be pleased to note that the graphics are very similar to the coin-op, with smooth scrolling backdrops and all the little cut scenes from the original.

As scrolling shoot and beat 'em ups go however, what we have here is one of the best, most playable and addictive games of the genre to hit the Nintendo for quite some time. On screen presentation is generally very atmospheric, using dark, forbidding backdrops to portray the depressing city of Gotham, and just wait until you see the main sprite himself he's a walking, jumping, pistol-packing masterpiece of graphic design, 1 kid you not! Other notable aesthetic additions include the very attractive intro sequence which sets the scene with a background storyline backed by a scrolling view of Gotham, and the cut scenes of the Batmobile zooming to the next stage of the game. The sound effects and various ditties are also worthy of praise, as they add heaps of atmosphere to the game.

The hydraulic version gives you a pretty good ride, but the trouble is that its massive joystick is so sluggish that when you react to a situation, the plane moves a half a second later usually half a second too late. However, that criticism doesn't apply with this conversion since control is with the joypad, and response is instantaneous. So, the controls are alright, but what about the game itself? Well, it's marvellous damn near arcade perfect. Enemy planes and missiles zoom in at supersonic speeds the 3D is easily the fastest and smoothest I've ever seen in a game of this type. In fact it all seems too fast at first, and games tend to end quickly with you thinking \"what the @*&$ hit me\"! But although it's a very tough game (and I do mean VERY tough), practice makes perfect, and once you get used to the sheer speed of the action, you start dodging and a-weaving missiles, ducking and a-diving hails of lead and blasting squadrons of planes out of the sky! Brilliant!! If you want to get a game not only to show your mates how completely amazing your Megadrive is (not only are the graphics superb, but the hard rock soundtrack and sampled coin-op effects are the best I've heard on the Megadrive) but also want to play one of the hottest, most addictive and definitely the most impressive coin-op conversions yet seen, get UTILIILIH La jok out!

Good luck, and may God (and a nifty trigSplash one bogey! (urgh disgusting!) ger finger) go with you. We saw the screenshots for this Afterburner derivative a couple of months ago, and were amazed. We read the blurb which came with the pics and were astounded. Now we've got the finished article and we're... pretty cheesed off actually, because Air Diver isn't nearly as good as it's been made out to be. The problem doesn't lie with the graphics no, they're very good indeed, with large, metallic enemy sprites and a great cockpit display. The trouble with Air Diver is the fact that everything moves far, far too quickly! It's very difficult to follow what's going on, making for frustrating and ultimately dull gameplay, as it's a real chore to get through even the early levels. And later on things just get virtually impossible, making it very frustrating and not enjoyable at all. One of the few Megadrive games to avoid, unfortunately Afterburner blasts it out of the sky.

"SCOBRZER PC ENGINE MACHINES A Watch out for that spear! PC ENGINE BANZAI! Prepare to split some skulls! .99 CORE HI-SCORE TIME I don't recall Tiger Road 250 35000 1:44 being a big hit, either in the arcade or on home PLAYER computers, and this PC Engine version is unlikely to take its reputation any further. The graphics are fine and the music is okay, but the gameplay is just annoyingly difficult. The first level I can cope with without any problems at all, but from then on the computer gives itself all sorts of unfair advantages. In the second section, enemies offscreen hurl javelins at you from nowhere, then in the next bit you have to fly your baldy through very tight spiky gaps while guns in the walls shoot streams of fireballs at you. The fourth section is the most frustrating as it is played on a set of platforms suspended over a splky floor. Each jump between platforms is a test of luck because vicious bats can appear out of thin air, knocking you on to the spikes. There's just nothing you can do to avoid them.
