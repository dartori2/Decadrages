Inside and outside this Monster Special issue you'll find the latest batch of super scary glow-in-the-dark stickers (more on them later) and an exclusive preview of Alien Storm chock-a-block full of things that go bump with a fright.

THE WANDERER RETURNS Just when everybody thought Hong Kong was just about Ufar enough, old hand Paul \"Pauly' Rand returned from his far-flung Far Eastern tour to win back his old job as staff writer on CVG! Funny old world, eh? Having charmed the natives of Hong Kong and amazed the locals with his knowledge of frothing beverages, Paul fought his way through customs weighed down with all sorts of technical little miracles the details of which it would be best not to go into. Back on British soil, our Geordie-born Liverpool supporter set about finding a bedsit in the smoke, only to find that nobody was prepared to take his whippets or accept massproduced ROM chips in place of rent. Anyway, the upshot of all this is that the man Rand is now back on the beat, so sorry to those of you who set your sights high and applied for the job of Staff Writer. Incidentally, Paul's return is good news for CVG and everyone else except the Hong Kong tourist commission, who had his crappy T-shirts and bloody Southerner jokes marked down as their main attraction for the summer...

Robocop 3 and Captain Hook, err, 1 What with monsters all over this month's CVG. we ve got to start with a mention for the biggest bug movie of the lot Aliens 3. Mirrorsoft have snapped up the rights to this tasty license and are planning a completely different style of game to show off the movie to full effect. The film, starring veteran Alien basher Sigourney Weave and a host of British stars, looks set to become a monster til when it s unleashed on the public later this year Apparently there are very few guns in the film (the poor old humans are armed with knives and things) and bits of the movie were filmed on an English beach because it looks like an alien landscape. So now yer know! The CVG crew have had a quick look at Robocop it on the Amiga and it's looking pretty impressive. Ocean and devel opers DID (the team behind F29 Retaliator) have opted for a full 3D game which appears considerably less violent than the other two. One to watch out for... Also, we do hear tell that Steven Spielberg's next biggle Captain Hook will be swashbuckling its way onto home compu ters soon, thanks again to Ocean. This looks like a license and a half (the film itself costs lions to make) and we'll bring you more news as soon as we have it! GAME GEAR GETS GOING.. GAME cable for optional head-tohead play and the whole thing feeds on six AA bal. teries or an optional power Supply Other games planned for release later this year include Outrun, Ninja Gaiden, Space Harrier, Frogger, Joe Montana Football, Golden Axe and Donald Duck and there are some pretty strong titles among that loi SER SUPER Monaco IT'S officialIls here.

After five very long years one of the finest coin-ops ever (A top ten jobbie in Boone's Arcade Hall of Fame) makes a welcome return with twice the thrills for your hard-earned dosh. The original just oozed finely-tuned gameplay, and early reports from Japan indicate that Namco have cap. tured the same atmosphere of clean-cut mayhem for Rolling Thunder 2. Basically, the terrorists are taking over wrecking every communication satellite floating around the Earth and leaving everyone in a frantic panic. Well, what do you expect with no Sky Movies? It's all the fault of the Geldra those bad guys from RT One reincarnated to cause more trouble as the Neo-Geldra (clever. eh?). The war has started again. Luckily agent Albatross from the original now has a fine looking sidekick the slinky red-headed Reila. Together or one at a time they can take on the baddies in a struggle to save the planet. Just like the original, there are one heck of a lot of bad dudes to contend with. Luckily there are guns and machine guns to play with, with various piles of ammo hiding behind closed doors! Expect to see Rolling Thunder at an arcade near you at some time in the near future. Make sure you save those 10ps you're going to need 'em. TURN on your telly right now and chances are you'll tune in to find good old Mario at the top of a skyscraper and sav. ing the world (again). Why?

While Richie Leadbetter was in Brum for the Challenge, he sneaked a peek at how things were progressing expect the exclusive review next month! Alien Storm went down a storm (groan, gibber) in arcades during 1990, combining Golden Axe gameplay with big guns and laser whips! The scenario (as to be expected from a coin-op) is rather corny. Put simply. loads of alien spores have landed on Earth and repellent. slimy aliens have grown from them, strengthened by the Earth's pleasant atmosphere. Now, the population centres of the world have been emptied and aliens roam the streets. looking for any juicy humans to accost. slime to death, and then eat for supper (yum yum). There are three heroes in the game who decide that enough's enough, and set out to utterly destroy the alien menace... US Gold are the software publisher behind the home versions of Alien Storm and they ve enlisted the aid of Tiertex (fresh from their successful conversion of MERCS) to carry out the home versions. From the look of the Spectrum and ST versions we've seen, it looks very impressive indeed, and we'll be giving you the definitive review in next month's CVG. A BRISK JOG... In the bonus game, the player Sprips along a horizontally scrolling level, blasting all sorts galier scum into next week and beyond! When all his high-speed malarkey is over, the player's performance is judged by the panel (made up of characters from previous Sega coin-ops even the dwarf from Golden Axe is in there!). Bonus points are awarded based on the judges' dekberations. LENSORM Devastation guaranteed.

Not only are they stealing valuables, they're also after evidence which can convict The Bonanza Bros' foes in this escapade are multitudinous the villains. And they are...

As well as wearing DEADO armour, these guys carry bullet-proof shields so they can only be shot when they are facing away from the brothers. If that doesn't work, you can rely on their slow reactions and risk dodging around them. THE WAITERS: These baddies inhabit locations such as the Millionaire's Yacht, and usually they're pretty shocked when they first see the brothers so shocked that they drop all the plates they're carrying! There are, however, a couple of quickwitted individuals who start throwing their plates at the intruders! PAUSE THE ROBODOGS: These steel-toothed monsters prowl around the later levels, growling whenever the brothers approach, then pouncing to knock them off their feet. However, hark at 'em whine when you pop a couple of stun pellets into their metal hides! The most impressive thing about Megadrive Bonanza Bros are the graphics. which are very true to the ray-traced sprites in the coin-op. Unfortunately. once you've recovered from that minor thrill. there's not a lot else capable of providing excitement. Do NOT follow your instincts and start playing this on EASY level, because after two games you'll have completed it. In fact the only way to get your money's worth out of Bonanza Brothers is to set the difficulty level to maximum, the lives count to minimum and ignore the option to continue using the extra credits. Even playing that way, it doesn't take long to grow tired of the gags and bored with the lack of things to do. In short, after only a few plays the entertainment value of Bonanza Bros plummetted, and if I were paying in excess of .00 for a game, I'd expect something much more substantial for my money. PAUL THE BEARDED BOMBERS: Usually to be found guarding exits. It takes four or five shots to knock these guys off their feet, and it's probably best to expend the ammunition, because they like to either pound heads or lob bombs in the brothers' direction.

QODEO PALUBE STIGE TRICKS AND TRAPS Bonanza Bros features some painful-looking sight gags to get the player (and any audience present) laughing... 0008200 TIME STAGE 0007108 THE DOOR SLAM: This can be used at every venue. Hide behind a closed door, then lure a guard to the other side When he is right behind it. open the door and SPLAT! Make sure you do it to them before they do it to you, though. Both Robo and Mobo reach the exit. THE CRUSHER: To be found in the Mint. Tempt an armoured guy towards you then duck behind the machine, grab the lever and pull. Chortle in hysteria as he is squashed flat, making him a bit of a \"walkover\"! 00002DO PAUBE STAGE 0003950 THE RAKE: Some guerilla gardener has left his tools out, and if you're not careful, one of the boys will knock himself cold when he steps on the end of the rake and the shaft smacks him in the face. Best jumped over. THE CAN: A bit like the rake, really. A litter bug has left a can on the ground, and if one of the lads walks into it, rather than jumps over it. he'll end up flat on his back, ready to be collared. A Robo admires his handsome features. THE ROBOT HEAD: A good way of avoiding the guards in the MD Laboratory. As soon as one comes near, duck into an alcove, and the brother in your charge plucks the head off a nearby robot and puts it on as a cunning disguise! PAUBE STAGE THE ROPE SLIDE: This one looks fun rather than painful, but it all ends in agony. It's actually a fast way of getting from to the floor below, but it's so fast that as soon as slide stops, the speeding brother is hurled through the nearest brick wall! A Hobo gets the last item while Robo heads for the exit. "

This conversion is two levels shorter than the coin-op. the fruit market being one of those absent. Also missing are the bonus stages which appear every few levels in the arcade game, in which the Bros have to dodge the beams of searchlights or face a mouthful of bullets! Hobo hangs around, while Robo makes good his escape 000 32900 PAUSE STAGE 00022100 There's no denying the graphical appeal of Bonanza Bros. The sprites are true to the arcade, with some nice, varied backdrops and excellent sprites. The sound is quite nice too with some cutesy soundtracks and good effects. To begin with the gameplay is quite entertaining splatting meanies and collecting the swag does keep you occupied for a couple of hours, but if you've got the difficulty level on the lowest setting and the lives counter on the highest, then you'll complete the game in just a couple of shots. There are actually less levels in this version than there are in the arcades and all of the bonus levels are missing too. Superficially, Bonanza Bros is a great game, but it lacks the lastability factor that would make shelling out .00 truly justified.

"This month's Challenge took me to the repellent Birmingham, home of mega softco US Gold.! took the gibbering Paul Glancey and snivelling Richard Leadbetter in tow, anxious to force un told amounts of suffering and humiliation on them... or so I thought... THE CHALLENGERS lancing over my challenge forms, I decided to summon Trevor Deighton from North Yorkshire, who had proved his scoring worth on many Commodore 64 and Megadrive games, even though he'd only been playing since February Gary Wilson was my next challenger. a hardened ST score warrior from Aldershot. Gary also brought a mate with him, \"David\" (or \"Dave\" to the more adventurous) and after letting it slip that he was not averse to playing the odd game he was duly roped into the festivities. US Gold's \"champion for a day\" was to be Steve Fitton, a \"Product Manager\" and alleged games expert. This strange fellow seemed highly confident of emerging from the contest victorious. The spazmo CVG squad arrived next, and I was anxious to force them into taking part. After showing an interesting selection of \"photographs\" to the warped Paul Glancey, he grudgingly accepted my offer to take part, on the condition that he got the negatives at the end of it. Unfortunately, no such items of blackmail were available into goading the mentally-crippled, quiff-toting Dick into action and he defiantly decided to just stand and watch, and perhaps gloat. I put paid to his disgusting behavior by sending him into the corner of the room, facing the wall with a bag over his face, lest his grotesque fizzog put my worthy challengers off their game (as well as their dinner). HALLENGE "


"David arrived next on the console and came up with a fairly miserable 4,480 and that was after a practice session!! wondered if this cheeky Chappie was really any good at games following this effort. I decided to keep a close eye on him.. GAME ONE GAUNTLET worthy game to start the challenge. Gauntlet is an eightway scrolling maze game with the objective being to reach the exit of each maze blatting and blasting meanies on the way. This isn't really my cup of tea the lack of gratuitous violence just isn't good enough. Still, this Master System version of the game is probably the best yet, so it's not all bad. Trevor went first, \"went\" being the operative word. Being relatively new to this computer game malarkey, the ex-rally driver had never played any version of this age-old arcade blast, and his maze-related antics proved to be completely inept. The other challengers watched in dumbstruck awe at his unskilled activities. A pitiful 2,500 was all Trev could come up with. Oh well. Steve \"Mr US Gold\" Fitton came up next for his turn, and came away with a fairly creditable 6,325, and so he should seeing as he'd playtested the game! His tactics were much like slothful Gary's except that they were even more tedious, About fifteen hours later he was finished (but Gary's score still ruled), and I woke up the rest of the audience ready for the final, pathetic participant. It only took a saucepan blow to the cranium to wake up the retarded, drooling Glancey person and persuade him to take his seat before the Master System. Obviously the concussion had some unforeseen effect and he somehow knocked up 6.015 points, which I was shamed to admit gave him third place in this round. Arrgggghhh! I'd make the fool never wish he'd been born for this! GAME TWO PAPERBOY The Sega version of this age-old coin-op was the next game on my challenge agenda, and after the drawn-out proceedings of the Gauntlet game I ushered Trevor to the seat ready to commence newspaper-throwing combat. This was another game he'd never played, but after five minutes of competent coaching from the Glancey-thing he turfed up a pretty decent score of 4.200 points reaching day three. Gary and David (real-life paperboys both) obviously weren't paying attention during Paul's \"expert\" tutorage and came up with a pair of surprisingly lacking performances, scoring 3.900 and 3.550 respectively. Their games were par ticularly painful to watch and it seemed that avoiding any sort of obstacle was a bit too much for these creatures. Gary takes his seat and proceeds into battle against ghouls and demons in the Sega version of Gauntlet. By the time he'd finished his go, his slow-playing tactics had drained the will to play from the other competitors, allowing him to take the round. The slightly more experienced Mr Wilson proved to be mar ginally more successful, achieving a score of 9.140. His game was a more cautious one, hiding behind corners and occasionally blasting the meanies. It took an age to wrest the lad from the console, and I suddenly realised that dirty play was the order of the day: Gary was subtly trying to bore his opponents into submission! Mean and moody Mr Wilson studies his surroundings and struggles not to be brainwashed by the huge number of publicity posters which confront him at every turn! You can tell by the look on his face that his will is gradually slipping away... The diminutive Steve Fitton took the seat after about seven minute's worth of constant whingeing, ended only by my mentioning something about his tender regions and the large, spiked stick I'd brought in my weapons holdall, and the red mist that was appearing before my eyes. It seemed that his pathetic, apologetic whining was justified as he came last with a limp 3,330 Last and very definitely least, the giggling, deluded Glancey took the hot seat. He had obviously been taking some kind of subliminal anti-clumsiness course and much to my supreme annoyance he took the round with a massive 10,610 points! At this stage in the contest, this made him joint leader Steve Fitton a man barely alive. Gentleman, we can rebuild him. We have the technology to make him the world's smal lest product manager. "


"THEZ CHALLENGE CONTINUED... with Gary. I hoped that he completely fouled-up the next couple of rounds for his sake... Unfortunately, US Gold didn't share my sentiments and took the whole lot of us (including the Leadbetter creature) out to lunch at the swanky TGI Friday's restaurant! Trevor Deichton -a man so hard he can sit on discarded soft drink cans without inflicting injury. Here we see him watching his fellow challengers practicing on the Shadow Dancer coin-op in the corner of the room. GAME THREE SHADOW DANCER After a vast lunch, it was time to cart the challengers off to NUS Gold's coin-op city for the third and fourth rounds of my challenge. To get the ball rolling. I ordered one round to be played on Shadow Dancer the story of a psychotic ninja and his ferocious child-mauling canine chum. Cheers went up from the assembled US Goldies as Steve Heeeeere's David! He's having a bit of a practice at Shadow stepped up to the machine. He reckoned he was company Dancer before lunch so he can trounce the rest of the field champion at this particular coin-op, and proceeded to let later. Unfortunately, it was all to go so tragically wrong for everyone else know as he started to show off a bit (more the boy when the time came. than a bit actually his slimy smugness made me want to After this slimy, odious performance, David's limp 4,800 vomit into the nearest sick bag). His multiple hours of practice was, well, there's no other word for it, but \"distressing\". I don't made it easy for him to get well into the game before his on really want to dwell on this ineptitude, so I won't. screen Ninja counterpart finally kicked the bucket. He fin Unfortunately, the same goes for Gary's equally lacklustre ished his game with a meaty 76,000. performance. His score of 5,600 wasn't quite as disastrous "


"as David's effort, but it simply wasn't good enough to match Steve's performance. To round the game off with a laugh-and-a-half, Paul Glancey arrived to have a quick stab at the game. I had noticed him observing Steve's skillful attempt. and he had obviously been taking careful note of how to take out the tougher terrorists. So, even though he had played the arcade game on only two other occasions, the annoying creature actually did surprisingly well, clocking up a fairly decent 20,400 and claiming second place as his own. Bah! Glancey's look like complete Excrement From The Last Devil In Hell, as he yomped and blasted his way through to level three with a huge 84.100 score! Gary had taken the round, and Glancey could not help but feel a little disappointed. I laughed a lot Masters GAME FOUR MERCS ager to redeem himself after his earlier failures. Trevor had been practising on the MERCs coin-op which stood in the corner of the room. So he was first to take the joystick, and he proceeded to blast his way through level one, collecting all the weapons he could and massacring as many enemy soldiers as possible. His performance did him credit and he came away from the game with a respectable score of 51.450 points. Steve decided to have a go next. He brashly announced that this was another coin-op to which he was seriously addicted, causing looks of consternation to be passed between the other challengers, who had played it only seldom. Sadly, his boasting proved to be no lie and his assault on the enemy continued until the end of level two. He left the coin-op after racking up 52.300 points. Again I had observed the writhing Glancey studying Steve's tactics, anxious to emulate them for maximum success. Some hope! When his turn actually came up, the nauseating Paul \"Mr Floppy\" Glancey actually did better than Steve. yomping through the majority of level two with a gargantuan score of 69.600. The assembled masses seemed to think that the odious one had clinched the round, and their suspicions seemed vaguely justified as Dave started his go. and only managed to knock up a quick 10,000 points before expiring! However, Fate was to deal the smug-ridden Geordie a los ing card as Gary took the hot spot. His MERCS abilities made A It's all over for the youngsters, and they take delivery of their prizes. Brave loser, Trevor (left). gets the booby prize of an empty cardboard tube, while the others (Gary, centre and Dave on the right) get an extremely expensive Walkman and a Master System Plus pack!

I found the results intensely embarrassing I checked and re-checked my findings, but there was no denying it. the vomit-inducing Glancey had won my challenge. Tying at the top slot with Gary Wilson' US Gold really piled on the prizes, handing out brill remote-controlled cars. mega-expensive Walkmans (Walkmen?) and even a Sega Master System as a runners-up prize. So another happy ending for them. The prospect of Glancey winning a challenge made me feel ill for many days, and I vowed a ter rible vengeance against the hideous Geordie... Here we see Andrew, US Gold's resident spaz, who is trying to plug his favourite joystick into the Shadow Dancer ar. cade game. Aren't you glad they don't let him do any programming? "

The action is fast and exciting, depicted with excellent graphics. The sound is also good, with great grunting noises and perfect effects stamping your opponent's head against the canvas pro duces the most satisfying noise! Although it tends to get a bit repetitive after a (long) while, there's lots of chal lenge on offer, and pummeling all of the opponents will take ages.

You can then fling him across the ring, flip him over on to the mat, drop kick him in the face or even clothesline him achieved by sticking your arm out and allowing your opponent to run straight into it!

Hulk Hogan (known as the Hulkster to his millions of fans) is acclaimed as the all-time WWF champion. During his career he has fought all comers, and won, to retain his title.

Wrestle War is fast and playable, and there is some real skill required if you're going to trash the whole bunch of computer fighters. What really makes this game are the big wrestler sprites, whose movements and facial expressions are superbly animated. Not only does it look good, all the grimaces and popping eyeballs are added too by sampled groans and \"oof!\" sounds, making it one of the most satisfying beat'em ups you could hope to play outside of an arcade.

"REVIEW SUPER FAMICOM .00 BY IMAGINEER im City offers would-be megalomaniacs the opportunity to create and control their own city: to watch it grow from the humblest beginnings to a sprawling metropolis. The game gives you all the tools for the job, including a fat pile of cash and some very eager builders. Make your city look attractive enough and people (\"the Sims\") will willingly move into your settlement. But the Sims are a pretty picky lot, and if your taxes are too high, or if there's too much pollu tion, or if there's nowhere to work, then you can expect them to de part in their hundreds and getting them back isn't easy... In short, your job is to provide plenty of opportunity for both work and play to the little Sims, so they'll want to live in your city. Do you have the ability to create an awe-inspiring metropolis, or is a dinky little hamlet more your style? CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN POPRON There are three main building types in Sim City. Residential areas are the places your Sims are going to live in, whilst your industrial areas are the manufacturing centres where a lot of the Sims are going to work Commercial areas are the places where shops, offices and small businesses are located. Connecting these different areas is obviously very important. Sim City offers two methods of creating a transport network. A good road network would attract the carowning Sims to your town, but could promote some pretty heavy pollution. Similarly, a badly planned network could result in serious traffic jams. The alternative is to create a rail network, which cuts down on pollution and carries more Sims off to work XB09212a999 Sim City was never a game that amazed due to its visual or sonic properties. It's just that the idea of creating and maintaining your own city is incredibly compelling, and watching it grow before your very eyes provides some serious entertainment. The graphics (though not spectacular) serve the purpose, and there's plenty of little delights like watching all your boats. planes and helicopters going about their business. This Super Famicom version has been crammed full of new ideas, like the bizarre professor that informs you of your progress (if he's being chased around by a bloodthirsty criminal, then you know there's something wrong with your police department!). Also, the inclusion of the four seasons varies the graphic style immensely. Imagineer (the game's programmers) are to be congratulated on a game that improves on the original classic concept.

These could be \"your house\", a bank (handy for loans when the money gets tight). the library, a casino, a fun park and even an astrodome-type sports stadium! The ultimate ego-boost must be the monument built in your honour! That'd be nico place Exeo THE FOUR SEASONS As the months roll by. you'll probably notice that the colour scheme tends to alter somewhat. This is because the Super Famicom version has faithfully captured the passing of time (and the four seasons) in the game.

"REVIEW SIM cm Watch the bridges open for passing ships, SYPasaia PORTS AND 'PLANES Sooner or later, your industrial products will have to be unleashed onto an unsuspecting world. For the purposes of importing and exporting both goods and people, seaports and airports can be created. Watch out for those ship-related tragedies and plane crashes, though. TAXES AND POPULARITY Though you're given a large wad of money to play with, the only way to keep your services (public works, police and fire departments) going, and keep building is through levying a tax on your poor Sims. Watch out though, because if your taxes are too high, you'll fall out of favour with your Sims and they'll leave your city deserted! zire cuiside the ure UPDATE Sim City is available on the ST, Amiga, PC and C64. Although they haven't got all the features of this version, they still offer an excellent gaming experience. The 16bit versions are also available in an Infogrames package, where this classic title is coupled with the brill Populous! Not bad, eh? Nintendo owners should also watch out for their own version of this game. From what we've seen, it's looking good!  11 BANK When I first sat down to start playing this, I was a bit concerned that all the Japanese text would make it difficult to play. Luckily. there isn't much of a problem because most of the icons and graphic screens are self-explanatory and it only takes a bit of experimentation to reveal the purpose of the others. The only possible confusion could arise from the budget and tax screens, but anyone who's played the game on other formats will be able to work them out, and this review should help anyone who hasn't. It turns out that this is the best version of the lot, mainly because of the extra presentation, the music, the sound effects and the addi tional challenge of working your way towards constructing the special bonus buildings. Unless brain games are a complete turn-off for you, Sim City is a game that is definitely worth buying. PAUL GLANCEY FIRE AND THEFT Crime and fires cause something of a problem to your city creating antics. Thankfully, you can add in fire and police stations to cope these problems.

"IREVIEW SPS Funnily enough, fact fans, Hydra is supposed to be the unofficial follow-up to Roadblasters. The gameplay is much the same. Simply burn up the road (in this case it's pulsating in different shades of blue, desperately trying to convince you that it's water) blowing other vehicles up. This type of game can be quite exciting if it's fast and smooth enough-arcade Roadblasters is brill. Unfortunately, this lacking conversion simply doesn't deliver. The graphics look like grainy replicas of the arcade original and seem quite pleasing in static screenshots but slow, jerky 3D scrolling completely ruins the effect. The sound isn't bad, but Matt Furniss'tunes are pretty uninspiring and the sound effects stunningly mediocre. If you're a fan of the coin-op check it out, but in my view buying this is equivalent to flushing 25 notes straight down the loo. RICHARD LEADBETTER A Messing about on the river.

The puzzles (if you could call them that, after all the quests are just a matter of finding an object or a person and then taking them to the exit) are quite simple, but the quests are sufficiently varied to sustain interest. The only possible fly in the ointment is the fact that the game is at its best with two or preferably four players participating, because then the game becomes a race to find the treasures before the others. Although it's still very playable solo, the game just doesn't have quite the same challenge so it wouldn't take too long to finish the 14 quests.

"! REVIEW MEGADRIVE BY ELECTRONIC ARTS D lockout is a puzzle game with a difference and probably the Dmost fun you'll have with building blocks outside a play pen. Take Tetris, turn it on its side, add a new dimension and you have the mechanics of Blockout. The aim of the game is to it together blocks so that they form complete layers in a pit. When all the holes are plugged, that layer disappears and the bricks above drop down one space. Staying alive for long doesn't come easy, though, as misplaced pieces force your blocks further up the screen and push you closer to doom. The pieces just keep coming, so rest assured you won't beat the machine. Play against a human and at least you have a chance... BLOCK A Two-player multicoloured mayhem! A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK Don't let anyone tell you different, puzzle pros: Blockout is Tetris with knobs on. Whereas Tetris shapes were restricted to every possible 2D combination of four squares, Blockout features any shape involving up to five cubes and in three dimensions Tetris was actually programmed for the Megadrive, but for reasons best known to the Nintendo and Sega legal departments, it was never officially released in Japan, the USA, or Europe, although pirate copies do exist The word on the street is that Super Tetris, written by Alexei Pajitnov (the original's creator) for Spectrum Holobyte is nearing completion. Quite what shape that will be tak. ing is a closely guarded secret, so watch this space for news as and when! I was pleased to hear EA were planning to tweak the Megadrive version of this top puzzler, and the result is a finely tuned game which works well. The Rainbow Arts original featured too many options, but this defect has now been ironed out. The two player game is a little slow, but great fun nonetheless. Blockout is easy to play, hard to put down and damn near impossible to avoid going back to. It's therefore a wise investment for any Megadrive-owning puzzle freak starved of long-term challenge. Enjoy! TIM BOONE FLIP ME, WHAT A PUZZLE! To get to grips with the Blockout control method, you'll need to think in three dimensions because anything's possible in this game! On the joypad, button A flips the shape vertically on its Xaxis, B flips it horizontally along the Y-plane and C flips it around. Confused? You won't be. Spinning the shapes to fit soon becomes second nature and you find yourself planning further and further ahead. 052 "

"REVIEW AMICA AMIGA .99 BY ACTIVISION EUROPE The Hunter roams the blasted landscapes of tomorrow a one man army bent on the destruction of the evil Red Empire as long as he's paid enough money! He's cool, he's mean, he's resourceful and intelligent. He also has the enviable talent of being able to drive any form of transport known to civilisation and this comes in handy during this game. There are three different types of game available. The first is a simple list of missions that are carried out one after the other. These simply involve blowing up strategic enemy targets or people. Then there's the action scenario. Packed full of blasting and annihilation, it's a desperate attempt to wipe the empire off the face of the earth once and for all. Finally, there's the campaign option. This is a massive strategic epic, with all your single missions counting towards the final outcome. At the end of each mission, you can save off your position and all your tools, equipment and money for use in the next game. X 079 .Y 070 and sans A The mouse is used to manipulate items. POCKETS OF FUN Be sure to collect some useful items from the stores before you embark on your mission. A log book comes in handy for digitally noting down any useful discoveries. Various scanners are also available which help the Hunter keep track of the enemy (and himself). The most useful item turns out to be the map. This can be superimposed over the main playing area to help keep track of your progress nu am UPDATE An ST version of Hunter has been completed and plays exactly like the game seen here. Priced at .99 it's an essential purchase, and it should be out by August. us DRIVING, FLYING, RIDING SWIMMING The Hunter is adept at using all forms of transport available to man, and since the enemy have numerous vehicles dotted around their territory, this skill comes in handy. The list of vehicles is endless and includes bicycles. cars, ambulances. scanner vans, trucks, armoured cars, tanks, rowing boats, speedboals and even windsurfers! The best mode of transport turns out to be the helicopter, but watch out for those surface-to-air missiles. Keep a look out for the hovercraft as well. This baby can travel aver both land and water! The Rocket Boat in all its glory! Helicopter vs helicopter! The start of the mission begins outside Allied HQ. The objective is simple: destroy the enemy base! The nearest shed contains a lot of the necessary equipment. Maps, flares and scanners are all here. A short drive takes the Hunter to the Allied Stores building. Most of your weapons are collected here. The stores screen itself! Simply by clicking on \"auto\" a nice selection of weapons are instantly collected! STOR 054 "

The graphics some kind of useful equip are excellent (the animation as the Hunter pedals around ment to be found in buildings. the landscape on his push-bike is amazing) and the 3D is fast and smooth enough to be convincing. The sound is similarly excellent with a good military tune and amazing sound effects (all of the cars make different noises, and there's loads of volcanic noises and seaside effects where appropriate). Lastability is guaranteed too, with loads of missions and scenarios with an expansive map for each. Look out too for the special surprises, hidden weapons and vehicles! There are even lashings of brutality for the hard-of-thinking when you mercilessly run down enemy soldiers and get money for it! Hunter offers everything for everyone and as such ranks as one of the best Amiga games money can buy. RICHARD LEADBETTER It would take ages for the Hunter to reach the target by speedboat. A helicopter is a welcome discovery! A few moments later and the Hunter is airborne! The Helicopter is quite difficult to control, but it sure shifts... Bombs at the ready . and just in time! There's enemy HQ but your 'copter is under heavy attack. The helicopter is brought down, but enemy HQ is heavily damaged. A few rocket shells are all that's needed... 055 "


"REVIEW HUNTER THE REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCE Just like real-life, time passes in Hunter, so expect days to turn into nights and so on. Nocturnal activity comes in handy as the enemy tend to fall asleep and their SAM sites and tracer guns are useless. Other authentic touches include the presence of many forms of wildlife, including seagulls, rabbits and even bulls! Credits are taken away from the Hunter for any indiscriminate killing (and that includes running over rabbits in your tank!). The Hunter takes a quick dip... Safe behind Allied territory! Let's hope there's not someone already inside! ENEMY ENTANGLEMENTS Don't expect your journey into hostile territory to be free of danger. A vast contingent of enemy soldiers is present and they're manning all forms of motorised artillery as well as massive tracer guns and SAM sites. Extra credits are awarded for blowing up the enemy artillery, but make sure you leave enough of the explosive stuff over for taking out the main targets. If you don't it's a case of finding some extra weapons behind enemy lines. no My jaw dropped when I first saw this at the Computer Entertainment Show last year, and I was most dismayed when Activision took it with them as they slid down the pan. It's lucky that The Disc Company were there to save Activision and Hunter, and you Amiga owners should be eternally grateful because it's one of the most impressive arcade adventures you're ever likely to play. The 3D graphics are just superb and I love the little touches, such as the bulls, the bunnies and the vultures which circle overhead when your energy is running out. The variety in vehicles and scenery keeps the game interesting throughout, and the graphics really are great. This is a game I could see myself playing for hours (if anyone would let me) and all those missions guarantee you getting your money's worth. It's out in August, so make sure you've saved the requisite cash by then because no self-respect ing Amiga owner can afford to be without Hunter. x 153 .Y 205 PAUL GLANCEY AERIAL OBSERVATION Send up an aerial observation unit to scan the immediate vicinity for people, buildings and most importantly, vehicles essential if you've just been shot down and need to get somewhere fast!

"REVIEW AMIGA BY CORE DESIGN .99 Another day at work for Private Biff and Sergeant Scooter means another day in the jungle putting bullet holes in enemy soldiers, enemy tanks, enemy trains, enemy buildings, and possibly a few enemy trees and enemy bushes as well, because you can't be too careful. These guys are such good soldiers that, even when they're on their summer holidays, they keep hand grenades safety-pioned to their fee-shirts, just in case. Today, though, they're hard at it, off to wipe out all of the enemy's ground forces which are hidden throughout the vast vertically scrolling jungle lying before them Initially armed only with machine guns, the lads (or lad it your fighting in one player mode) have to yomp up the screen, blasting bits out of anything they come across Best not get carried away though, because friendly prisoners have been tied to stakes and left to die in the heat it you can res cue them (rather than blow them full of holes), it'll make their day, and they may even award you some bonus points. MORE RUMBLES IN THE the bandwagon, and in the following months Microdeal released Leatherneck (which was actually a four-player game if you had JUNGLE the appropriate joystick adaptor), and Ocean brought us (actually a film license) and Victory Road (a very poor converWar Zone is by no means the first commando shoot 'em up to sion of SNK's lkari sequel). Further Commando-style action is appear on computer. Capcom released the original Commando found in Ocean's Guerilla War (another hideous Ikari spin-off) coin-op, which Elite promptly converted to the computers with and Steve Bak's pseudo-sequel to Leatherneck, the okay Dogs some success. Following that SNK's Ikari Warriors was the arof War. Most recently, US Gold have put together a two-player cade game which started the two-player ball rolling, and that conversion of Capcom's three-player commando coin-op. was given the conversion treatment, again by Elite, in 1989. Mercs, which was reviewed last issue and earned 90% on These successes inspired numerous companies to yomp onto Amiga. 2. ECE EMU UPDATE ST owners should watch the shelves for their own version of War Zone which should be available as you read this. Although War Zone has the two things that usually make for a great shoot 'em up, namely big weapons and loud noises, it is a bit lacking in originality. That moan aside, what I admire about the game are it's excellent graphics (which I think are rather more colourful and attractive than those in Mercs), the great sound and the good variety in weapons. The other good thing about War Zone is that it's certainly no pushover if you're playing on your own you'll have trouble just beating level one. An extra player makes all the difference, because you end up cover ing each other's back, which adds a surprising touch of realism to the proceedings. War Zone is pretty similar to Mercs (though not quite as good in the gameplay stakes), but it is a fiver cheaper, so in the VFM stakes, it comes up trumps. PAUL A bridge-based assault 058 GLANCEY "


"REVIEW BRINGING ON THE BIG GUNS Eh Our two War Zone grunts start the game each armed with a weedy machine gun, but, as befits a game of mass destruction, there are five types of meatier armament stored in the weapons cases which are hidden around the landscape. Collect P icons and these can be powered up three times. ROCKET LAUNCHER A long range, heavy-duty weapon which explodes on contact with a target. Definitely one to grab before your mate gets to it. GRENADE LAUNCHER Powerful (especially when powered-up into a multi-directional weapon), but you have to get the range right, or you'll be lobbing grenades over the enemies' heads! FLAME THROWER Short-range, but quite deadly. Power-ups increase the flame thrower's range dramatically. SMART MISSILES Once launched, these home in on the nearest enemy then blow him or it to smitheroons! Certain to make any party go with a bang. THREE-WAY SHOTGUN Unsurprisingly, this is a shot gun which fires in three directions. Powerful, but has a slow rate of fire, which only increases with multiple power-ups. Grenades cause aggro. The first mid-level boss, Taking on a tank! I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed my explosive trip into the War Zone. As per usual for a Core Design game, the graphics are simply superb. The sprites are all well-defined and possess some nice animation, whilst the backdrops for each level are varied and visually interesting. I also like the pseudo-3D effect of the landscapes and how it affects the gameplay. For example, you can't shoot through solid walls, but there's nothing stopping lobbing a grenade over them, thus neatly disposing of the evil nasties loitering behind it! All this napalm-related excitement is accompanied by some excellent sound effects. The rocket launcher in particular has a brilliant noise! The gameplay itself is really tough and getting past each level is incredibly taxing. I had problems getting off level one. Any road up, War Zone is a great Commandostyle blast that is good in one-player mode, but even better if you can force a chum into taking part.

I've got through about 30% of the game, and for each area the graphics just keep on improving! The sound is excellent as well. The renowned Tim Follin comes up trumps yet again with some brilliant atmospheric scores probably some of the best music yet heard on the NES. The gameplay is excellent, with some brain-bending puzzles and nice power-ups for Shadox's abilities. For the Nintendo, this is a very original and compelling game that'll have you super-glued to your console. RICHARD LEADBETTER MAGIC SHOES? There are a number of items carefully dotted around the 3D landscape. Two distinct types are in evidence. The first type, consists of building block-type platforms that Shadox can call around the screen and use as stepping stones. The more inter esting items are magical. These come in the form of magic keys (essential for spenira magic doors), credits (endows Shadox with a continue) and special items that power-up Shadox sabi ities.

If you've ever played any of the similar games on the Spectrum or whatever you do have an instant advantage because a lot of the puzzles and ideas will be familiar (in fact some of them are VERY familiar, looking like they've been taken straight out of the Ultimate oldie, Knight Lore).

Shoot spiders off the ceiling and make sure they are dead, or they'll attack! 7. Don't use a grenade in an enclosed area. It's a bit of a stupid thing to do, isn't it?

Redefine the keys as you want them and you'll have infinite lives just like that,\" added Rodney for good measure in his letter. 000 STRIDER If playing through this tepid conversion is a bit too much of an effort, try this little tip from Rob Arnold of Nuneaton.

"Simon Sleight from Spalding sent in this cosmic SWIV player's guide, full, of juicy hints 'n' tips for this brilliant multi-format shoot'em up. So without further ado, let's get on with it, eh? CHOOSING VEHICLES If you want to complete SWIV, there are two main games types: In one-player mode, choose the heli, as it's easier to de stroy the bosses and dodge bullets. In two-player mode, one player should get reasonably far on a credit, but when he/she bites the dust, the other player should take over with the other vehicle whilst the first player sits out. Get the idea? CUNNING TACTICS GOOSECOPTERS This helicopter's easy to destroy if you shoot at its metallic cen trepiece whilst its forming. Or if you're endowed with a shield, fly straight at its heart, firing for all your worth. BAUSEN PRIS P TO CONTINURI FIRST INSTALLATION With the Star Weapon, this momma's easy. Just sit down to one side keep blasting! SECOND INSTALLATION With the extra spread weapons, take out the two guns first then concentrate on the middle laser dome, before mopping up the two outside laser domes. Be very wary of the helicopters. 066 "


"PLAYER'S GUIDE COLLECTING POWER-UPS When you destroy the first Goosecopter, collect three (or two i you were slow) extra spread tokens, and perhaps a shield, At the second Goosecopter collect extra spread and rapid fire tokens and perhaps a shield. Blast the third Goosecopter into smithereens but instead of col lecting the icons, keep shooting them. This should make a star token appear, which endows your SWIV lighter with a superbrill star weapon, which fires in eight directions! Beware though, this baby only appears once and vanishes alter you ve been hit five times. After that revert to the tactics used to dispose of the first two Goosecopters. Another thing to remember is that shooting the shield turns it into a smart bomb which annihilates everything on-screen! Yay! GENERAL TIPS Try to memorise the baddies appearing points and the whereabouts of the shield icons. It'll come in handy Be very wary of bullets, but don t always take evasive action as the baddies are mostly crummy shots. When you die, put your four second shield to good use Blast the tokens repeatedly to claim the Star Weapon In two-player mode, take it in turns to collect all the power ups It's best to blast silkworm homing missiles rather than trying to avoid them Never fly/jump directly over pyramids and volcanoes,  Keep firing! THIRD INSTALLATION Just before this baddie appears, there's a Goosecopter. Collect one shield from its remains and keep blasting the other token. Then sit in the middle of the moving gun. When that shield runs out, collect the other shield and repeat the process. If you die still sit in the middle and keep blasting as you have a four second timed shield. FOURTH INSTALLATION This nasty spills silkworms at an alarming rate, but don't worry about blasting these. Just aim for the main body to make your shots count. Eventually, you'll destroy it. 067 "


"NINTENDO SNAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL What should I find on my desk. but this set of hints and tips for Rare's brilliant game. So, thanks are in order for Dale Thomas of Swindon. Here goes... At the start of level one, jump onto the small island in the water and press your B button. This opens a secret manhole that takes you to level three! Also on level one, there is a new life on a very high platform. You can get to it unless you jump into, the water near the platforms. When the shark comes, let it bite you. As you fly into the air, keep your finger on the up direction of your pad. You should reach the platform. Use this tip on other levels too for other secret bonuses. On level three (past the three blades), grab the key from under the manhole cover (you'll need to carry the key all the time) Get onto the platforms near the loudspeakers that spit nibbly pibblies and jump onto the manhole cover and jump to the right onto the manhole cover. Jump right again onto the higher plat form. Jump to the left onto the large platform and above you is a manhole which is a warp to level live! According to Dale, ac tually pulling this off is pretty difficult. So there, Here's a quick way to complete level tour quickly. As you get near the bell, anvils will fall from the sky. Avoid them and when the green one appears. make it land on the scale. I will ringi the bell and open the door for you. Hurrah!

Nicky Lee strikes back with this one. pad to choose a level! Also, during the game little Sega signs appear. Collect them all to make all the fruit you collect worth 500 points. There's also a tenth round secreted in the game. You need to collect 36 dolls. You get these throughout the game (but some of them are hidden, so be careful). Get all 36, and the game automatically moves on to the tenth level! WONDERBOY Since this has recently appeared on the Game Gear, I thought I'd print these tips for this okay-ish coin-op conversion. Oh by the way, these tips are from Sega of America themselves, so if they don't work, I'm a Dutchman (which I am, sort of). Any way, to choose the round you wish to start on follow these instructions. When the screen shows the round and area number press button one twice, and button two twice. Now hold both buttons down and use the direction DEVIL CRASH This was one of first games I ever played when I joined C+VG, and it's pretty damn hot in my opinion.

Just in case, Infogrames have rewritten the classic puzzler for the Amiga with tons of extra options and pretty graphics thrown in.

Whilst it's quite close to the 16-bit original, it's a tad unconvincing and jerky for my liking.

DOMARK .99 OVERALL 72% This platform game scored highly on 16-bits because of the amazing animation on the main sprites and the great mixture of lethal traps and puzzling. Let's put it this way, we're absolutely amazed by the quality of the Amstrad conversion. The animation is as showstopping as ever, the gameplay's great and there's loads to keep you occupied.

Jeff Minter unleashes his own bizarre sense of humour on the ST OVERALL 69% world again, this time in a llama version of Williams' classic Robotron coin-op. This is a Public Domain game (so you can copy it and pass CASIO 3100) it amongst your friends), and since it's only .50. you really are getting a bargain. The gameplay (though slightly repetitive) is very entertaining, and though the graphics are rubbish, the sound is excellent with many rib-tickling samples are used throughout. One of the best things Minter's done in ages.

Hurrah! This adventure has a simple control method, excellent graphics, gripping plot and a laugh-a-minute sense of humour. The only slight niggle is the fact that there's quite a bit of disk-swapping involved if you've only got a single drive 520 ST. But you'll have so much fun playing it, who cares?

"SPECTRUM DRAGON NINJA Speccy owners once again get a whole load of budget re-releases doled out in their direction. There's the usual mix of beat 'em up and blasting action, and even James Bond too! Richard Leadbetter heads off to Spec. trumsville. JOCKY WILSON'S COMPENDIUM DARTS ZEPPELIN .99 Six different types of pulse-racing Darts action can be yours with the aid of this Zeppelin release. As well as the bog standard 501 Championship Darts, there's Shanghai, Football (?), Dart Bowls, Ten Dart Century or Scram. Though the gameplay is pretty simplistic, and the duel against Jocky himself is a tad disappointing, this darts game isn't bad.

Dragon Ninja is a definite improve DOMARK .99 ment over the lacking Double Dragon, and isn't a bad purchase for Ha-harrrr me laddie! Shiver me timbers, etc etc. If you didn't get the Speccy beat 'em up addicts. idea from that unoriginal and lacking intro, Skull and Crossbones is a OVERALL 73% scrolling beat 'em up based around pirates. The coin-op, like this conversion, borders on the average, so if I was you, I'd save the eleven LICENCE TO KILL quid for something better. Let's hope that future conversions are far superior. HIT SQUAD .99 OVERALL 57% One of the better 007 Domark excursions, Licence to Kill offers would-be members of the Secret Service the chance to take out a drug baron across several levels of vertically scrolling annihilation. Licence to kill is quite an addictive little number, but the monochromatic graphics cause the baddies' bullets to become almost invisible on some levels. If you're a Bond fan, you'll doubtlessly love this. Others may be put off by the frustrating gameplay. ...Coming soon to a Spectrum OVERALL 73% near you, courtesy of Domark: Hydra. If you didn't know this is LICENCE a 3D aquatic blast in the Roadblasters mould. In fact, check out the 16-bit review on page 44, and the update in the next issue of CVG... NEWSFLASH ERDE DRUPAGE BONUS PENDE SDI HIT SQUAD .99 The end of the world is nigh! Well, it is unless you and your laserarmed SDI satellite can annihilate all of the enemy missiles streaking towards friendly territory. SDI is a conversion of a startlingly boring Sega coin-op, and this game simply fails to strike home in the entertainment stakes. I can't really recommend this much at all I'm afraid. OVERALL 59% ...Nearer Christmas time, look out for Domark's conversion of Atari's Pit-Fighter coin-op. This one-on-one beat 'em up featured superb digitised graphics and sound, and rumour has it that conversion house Teque have even managed to get in the screen zoom-in, which it's said even the programmers of the Megadrive version couldn't include...

Richard Leadbetter tells all... It's time to dart around an overhead eight-way scrolling course, overtaking other cars with the express purpose of winning the race. FasCHESSMASTER test Lap has got some excellent static graphics, but the in-race visuals are rather lacking. Come to think of it, that last comment applies NINTENDO .99 to the race action as well. If it's high-speed thrills 'n spills you're The first chess game on the Gameboy turns out to be one of the after, check out the likes of F1-Race before setting eyes on this lackbest in existence! With computer opponents ranging from mega-thick lustre effort. to Einstein level, there's plenty of lasting appeal. The graphics work OVERALL 62% exceedingly well and there's even sampled speech! There are billions of options too, including a battery back-up option to save off your game. If you've got even the slightest interest in chess, Chessmaster is the one for you. OVERALL DOT MATRIX WITH STERED SOUND 96% BATTERY BOMBER BOY HUDSON SOFT .99 The HIT!-rated PC Engine Bomber Man hits the Gameboy and there's even a new game (the eponymous Bomber Boy) thrown in for good measure. The action is pretty straightforward. Just run around a maze, blowing up creatures with the aid of your bombs and the various power-ups available. Bomber Boy is a very addictive little number and good value for money, so what are you waiting for? OVERALL 82% GREMLINS 2 SUNSOFT .99 Gizmo's back and this time he's taking no crap. His general aim in this conversion of the movie is to roam the eight-way scrolling platform area picking up extra weapons and blatting those evil little Gremlins (and the evil big ones at the end of each level). Gremlins 2 is a tough game all right, with very challenging gameplay and very difficult bosses. The graphics and sound are great, but with the amount of platform games available, it's very unoriginal. OVERALL 80% Nintendo GAME BOY ...NEWS FLASH... MICKEY MOUSE ... Available in all Gameboy stockists now (try out Boots first) the all-new Gameboy carry case! Cast in robust, rugged plastic it protects your Gameboy, leads and six game paks from the rigours of the outside world. Retailing at .99, it's a tad on the pricey side for a bit of moulded plastic, and some nice, soft material inside would've helped cushion the Gameboy when it gets buffeted about... NINTENDO .99 Yet more platform malarkey on offer here in this Gameboy licence of everyone's favourite Disney rodent. The action is pretty limited. Just guide Mickey around the platform area opening doors and collecting keys. The graphics are fine, but unfortunately the scrolling is megajerky and the gameplay itself can hardly be described as addictive or compelling. Put simply, Mickey Mouse 2 is a pretty lacking effort. Leave well alone. OVERALL 51% ...News reaches us from Japan of a special NES Gameboy converter cart! The device itself is shaped like any other Nintendo cart, apart from the fact that there's a small slot in it that takes your Gameboy cart.

"AAAAA REVIEW SEGA .99 BY SEGA he evil god of destruction, Bios, has risen from the flaming fields of Hell and is bent on wreaking havoc to our fair and pleasant galaxy! Only one man is capable of massing enough fire. power to do away with the evil Bios, and that guy is Guy (if you get my meaning). He enjoys blowing things up (well, it's a hobby) and sees Bios' intrusion into our dimension as a good excuse to kick some demonic ass. So, pausing only to pick up his anti-gravity belt buckle and massive double-barreled laser shotgun, Guy flies out into the un Ist go for our known ready to do battle with Bios. The only problem is that as Guy heroes as they take scrolls horizontally through each level, Bios' satanic minions arrive, on all manner of ready to give Guy a laser blast that'll send him to oblivion! niasties Lucky Thankfully, Guy's made of pretty stern stuff and can withstand they've got a hagdy plenty of hits before he meets his makerl The only problem is that corner shop and at the end of each level, Bios has deposited a massive trainee god, few guid to and Guy's laser skills are tested to their limits in order to bring spend, eh? these oversized minions to photon justice! RESES 97688 2001 INN FORGOTTEN COIN-OPS Forgotten Worlds is something of a landmark in Capcom history. It was the first coin-op to use their CPS arcade system, and all of their subsequent coin-ops (UN Squadron, Strider, Street Fighter 2, Final Fight et al) are based around this powerful design. But did you know that Forgotten Worlds is actually called Lost Worlds in Japanese arcades (now, not a lot of people know that). The coin-op is different from this conversion in that it boasted simultaneous two-player action and different routes through each level (some routes were either more dangerous or provided more money to pick up in the form of vanquished monsters). In my view, there aren't really that many Master System shoot 'em ups that hit the mark, and Forgotten Worlds doesn't do much to redress the balance. The scrolling's fine and the graphics are quite close to the coin-op's (apart from the slightly dinky sprites). and the gameplay is quite entertaining with lots of explosive action and some good power-ups. Unfortunately, there is something seriously wrong with the sound. The coin-op's tunes were pretty nail to begin with, but these Sega renditions are just completely dire with some very bizarre booming \"bass lines\" luse the term very loosely) and irritating tinkling noises. If you can put up with this just for one minute. you're seriously deranged. Turn the volume down and Forgotten Worlds boils down to being a pretty average blast. But worry not Sega blasting fans, I've seen a preview of Mirrorsoft's Xenon 2 and that looks rather special indeed... RICHARD LEADBETTER HIGH CALIBRE SHOPPING In amongst the blasted entrails of vanquished meanies Guy collects money. The local currency in this and other Capcom games is Zenny, and at the shop located at the middle of each level, this can traded in for better weapons. Also, medikits can be bought to heal those wounds and resurrection potions are also a must should Guy bite the dust. SODD ANNONININGINN 2000 3000 5000 WELCOME! 088 NA AAANAA "


"L REVIEW FLASK This potion of resurrection grants you an extra life, at the cost of 3000 zennies. goo LASERS There are three types of laser, ranging from wimpy shooters to spiffy weaving blaster UPDATE Forgotten Worlds has been out on all the computers for a year or two (conversions were by US Gold), and a Megadrive version has been officially available since before Christmas.

The coin-op was hardly a classic. and this version doesn't even have the major plus-point of the two player option. The sprites are really great, looking like smaller versions of the graphics in the Megadrive game, but unfortunately, they are the game's only asset worth mentioning. It's not that the game is bad as such, it just, well, doesn't pack much, of a punch. If you liked the arcade game you'd more than likely get a few thrills out of this, but otherwise you di probably be happier playing the Sega version of R-Type, which was much more impressive and enjoyable, PAUL GLANCEY BOO 100 CENNINNINNNNN 300 NINIENININININININNINNININ LEND TAVAA AAATAT ROTATO-BLAST In the arcades. Forgotten Worlds was distinctive because of the strange joystick controls. The stick could actually be twisted through 360 degrees thus enabling the main sprite to fire in one direction and move in another. Of course, the Sega hasn't got a rotating stick, so instead the A and B button are used to spin Guy either clockwise or anti-clockwise. A button to fire all of the weapons systems isn't required, because the game nas an auto-fire built in! GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 80 LASTABILITY 70 OVERALL 75 AANAA "

"50Q Uitver IT AIN'T SHAKESPEARE, BUT... Dear YOB. I have written in to publicly mock and cast down Allan \"I'm a pleb\" Brownie's pathetic attempts at poetry. To make up for his generally crap rhymes I have written one of my own. YOB, as he scours the mail, Stops and then lets out a wail, \"If Brownie don't stop. Sending me this trollop. Then to the floor, his head will nail.\" Not bad eh? P.S. I have an Amiga and a Gameboy and am proud of them both. Mr Anonymous, Nowhere Land YOB:There was a young lad from Nowhere Whose poems were full of hot air He tried to impress But forgot his address Now he looks a right prat, so there! MORE GRIPES, GROAN! Hi Y, I'm writing in to gripe about such no-hopers as Guy Simms (Muhmud Ahmud's \"friend\", ish 110) who's got some funny idea that the Megadrive has better graphics and sound than the Amiga. He's not completely wrong, but he sure as hell isn't right either. On the graphics side, the Amiga has a palette of 4096 colours (in low-res mode and the A2000/A3000 can produce 16 million colours with special chip). The Megadrive's palette is somewhere between 512 and 1024, nowhere near the Amiga's. On the other hand the Megadrive manages 12 channel stereo Yeehaa! The Mailbag was full to bursting this month, which cheered me up so much I had to go off and fight with the milkman to put myself in the right mood, to deal with you lot. Now I've turned sour again and need a few good laffs to glower over. If you think you're up to the mark, drop me a line at I'M FUNNYTAM. YOB'S HILARIOUS MAILBAG, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. The best letter wins , but nobody scoops it this month because they're all crap... sound compared with the Amiga's 4. even though Amiga sound has better performance. Enough of that, though. The only reason that the Megadrive has better games is because it is a console and designed specifically for games, not because it has better capabilities. I think Amiga programmers around the globe should pick up their act and start producing bril liant arcade-style games and'. perfect conversions the Amiga is capable of. James Pond and Turrican are prime "


"you use too much Vicks Vapo Rub and don't have a cold. I wanted to make this star letter, but there's no address to send the cash to. Har! Har! Har! COME ON breed of arcade owners have really cleaned up their act. Some of them are now so well run I almost feel out of place... CHVGS FOLKS, PLAY THE GAME! A VIEW ON REVIEWS Dear YOB. Here is my guide to a good review (answering last month's letter from Jon Lindsey). 1. Make sure the first one or two paragraphs give the outline to the game. 2. Say roughly how to play the game. 3. Give a few views on the game (not too opinionated). 4. Add a few paragraphs of \"nice touches\" the game includes. 5. Give your own personal view of the game. 6. Give a rating (graphics, sound etc shouldn't come into it to much. Playability and lastability are much more GIZZA JOB, GO ON.. important). examples of what they should be doing, though think they could have been even better if the programmers utilised the full European 320x256 resolution instead of the American 320x200. A good way to start the ball rolling would be to port over a few original Megadrive games (Super Shinobi, Thunderforce III) instead of porting from the inferior ST with inadequate changes. Mr Wizard Man, Canberra, Australia. YOB: Your letter is a triumph of ignorance over fact. First of all, have you seen a recent Amiga game using the 4,096 colour HAM mode? Because of technical reasons your brain cell couldn't cope with, most games have only 16 colours on-screen at once. But what's all this \"better performance\" Amiga sound garbage? The Amiga can only play samples, whilst the Megadrive can synthesize it's own noises and play samples. The Megadrive plays better games because it was designed to play games, and thus does have \"better capabilities\" (custom graphics and sound chips and better, faster hardware scrolling for starters). Oh and while we're at it. The size of Turrican and James Pond's screen has nothing to do with US or European screen sizes. In fact, the REAL reason is the fact that the Amiga couldn't update the screen as fast if the play area was bigger so there! I'm not putting the Amiga down, 'cause it does have some games that will never appear, or be bettered, on the Megadrive. Indeed, some Amiga games are actually better than the Megadrive ver. sions (Rainbow Islands and James Pond, for example). I just can't stand a smar. tass who gets all his facts wrong, so stick that up your Aussie bum and smoke it. Hey YOB! I'm writing to you on a subject that happens to be very close to Jazza's heart the amusement arcades. I've noticed how that's a bad word with parents nowadays. At least, in Britain. In Japan there's no problem. In fact, going down to the local amusements is likely to be a family outing you can see Japanese tourists here in the summer taking their kids for a shot on the vids. So why is it taboo here? Ask the parents. \"It's a waste of money.\" I don't know about you, but I think twenty-pee for anything up to twenty minutes of vidbashing (if you're good) sounds perfectly reasonable to me and I'd certainly rather play a coin-op than smoke the equivalent number of cigarettes. \"It's anti-social\" Sorry, parents. You're wrong on this one. I love to meet mates for a go on the latest two, three, or even fourplayer machine. The arcades are a great place to make new friends too. If you see someone playing a twoplayer game alone, of course you're gonna join them having to work as a team with a stranger will bring out the best in you. I've quite a few friends I've made that way. \"You'll get addicted\" Yeah, sure it's addictive. It's meant to be. Addiction to the vids doesn't mean you're a moron who whops all his dosh down the coin slots as soon as he gets it look at Jaz! So why do parents think that the arcades are a den of sin? As far as I can see, they tend to think of amusements as dark, smokey places with people pushing drugs in corners, whereas the truth is that most modern arcades are clean no-smoking zones bustling with happy players. So come on parents, wise up! David Black, Inverness. YOB: You may be a boring old fart Dave, but you're right of course. In the past it's true that your local vid game emporium left much to be desired, but the new 7. Unless real, make no imaginary Ed remarks. (Like this one? ED), don't completely rave about a game (even if it is excellent) and remember a game always applies to someone. (Eh? ED) Robert Walker, Hillingdon, London YOB: So that's how to write a spiffy games lowdown, eh Bob? What does it look like we're doing on the Review pages? Hanging out Auntie Dot's laundry? Doing the Sunday Times crossword in Swahili while standing on our heads? dunno, there's just no pleasing some people. As for those Ed remarks: Tim's real enough, but I reckon you're a work of fiction dreamed up by somebody just to cheese me off on a Monday morning. Talking of which... HA! HA! WHO? Dear YOB! Ah Ah! Ho ho ho! MR STOOL HEAD HERE! How are doing... get it? Har har har! Well, joking a-side... get it? Har har har! Yer know Saddam sent out his kid to fetch him a bag from the bottom of his garden. He came back and said \"There's no Bagdad\"... har har har. Knock, knock... Doctor... get it? Har har har! Gibber gibber! Where does a frog go on its holidays? Ah Ah! New York. Har har har. Why did the girl fall off the swing? Ah ah! 'Cause she didn't have any arms! Har har. Well, that's all from me, good ol' Mr Stool Head. Ah ah! Good Ole Mr Stool Head, Bevere, Worcester. YOB: See what I mean? This is what happens when Dear YOB I'm thinking of a career in publishing and I wondered how you lot got started in CVG. Did you just have loads a' dosh or did you...? How? Another thing: I don't think your new-look is as good as the old one. But don't get me wrong. I still make it the premiere choice on the shelf along with MEAN MACHINES Oh yeh, can you remember the very first CVG? The front cover read \"HIT THE BEACHES WITH BATTLE SHIPS\". Those were the days eh? Only .00 for your CVG... M Walton. Oxford YOB:How did we all get jobs? That's a good one. I was delivered to the CVG offices by mistake with the Wednesday morning mail after falling asleep in a post box. I'd opened a few of the letters, formulated suitable replies and the crew were so impressed they gave me the tea cupboard to live in. Jaz got his job for setting the all-time high score on Lawnmower Simulator in a Aberystwyth fish and chip shop while waiting for his saveloy. Paul was employed on the strength of his incredibly trendy pocket organiser, Rich got his job because we couldn't bear to unleash his quiff on anyone else and Jon got his due to his incredible talent for lurking in dark corners and barking at anyone who comes close. As for Tim, God knows why they employed him. By the way, the first CVG had Space Invaders on the cover (it was a typein listing for the Nascom), and it only cost 85p. Mind you, that was in 1981... 9oooooo RENT AM D Cause she didn't have any "


"WITH NARCO treated. Although it and my Amiga are deadly rivals, the one ST review in issue 114 was pathetic. Less time should be spent on unofficial, unavailable machines (Famicom and PC Engine) and spent on machines which are popular like the Megadrive, MS, ST and Amiga. Lastly, I know that it hasn't made much of a UK appearance so far, but with the new Lynx Il console, sales the impress in the states (it outsells the Genesis and PC Engine), new accessories and new games of real quality (35 are listed in Special Reserve), it is the most promising handheld. More coverage please! Please print this as I'm sure I'm part of a large chunk of your readers with these views who, like me, are considering whether to continue purchasing CVG. Barry Jenkins, Theydon Bois, Essex. YOB: You've completely ig. nored the prime virtue of CVG there are 101 things you can do with a rolled up copy of the magazine. I suggest you carry out the last, because you're talking out of the place you should stick it sideways... FACTS AND FIGURES Dear Yob. I am writing a review on your Mail Bag, and here it is... Drawings: 85% Remarks: 98% Boredom: 1% Lunacy: 60% Crapness: 0% Funkyness: 90% YOBness: 100% Worth of Cost: ,000,000,000,000 Overall: 99% So there you have it. Your Mail Bag is totally brilliant. Now please can I have that ? Daniel Jones, Clwyd, Wales. YOB: Your chances: 00% FAB FROM THE MEGA MAN Dear YOB, After reading the third magazine since the first newlook issue. I felt I had to write and air my views. Firstly, think that CVG is resting on its laurels. As it is the bestselling magazine of its type, it doesn't need to attract more readers by recommendation and, as a result, standards have slipped. However, it appears that an attempt to gain customers has been mounted which involves painting the pages garish colours and using words like \"Mega!!!\" and \"Fab!!!\". Younger readers may be fooled, but the quality of the reviews has suffered and many older readers in the 14plus bracket will be put off by the inane caricatures of revie. wers and general immaturity of the magazine and turn to more objective, informative magazines. Secondly, CVG has been left behind with regards to new technical achievements. I'm not talking about the Famicom etc, but where are features on CDI/ROM, extensive VR reports, not just on one system, previews of state of the art games, Wing Commander II, Birds of Prey etc? Thirdly, CVG has been seriously marred by the allocation of space. As the owner of a Lynx and Amiga, I have practically every sort of machine handheld, console and computer so I am neutral in the \"my console knocks spots off your computer\" wars. It is therefore easier for me to see which machines are being unfairly and console it's being re in the western hemisphere, viewed on. Better, but not things to do with six much change.

Overall, the new C+VG is an TURBO improvement with some bloody great illustrations laid TROUBLE out wonderfully and even more information. A great job. Dear YOB, CVG is absolutely wicked. I have recently visited an YOB: Yeah, yeah, yeah. American Airbase in Eng. And if you could afford the land.

My quesComputer and Video Gamestion is, will someone demagazine: signed something that will 1.

Wow! dated monthly and, as you deal with all types of computers and consoles, you could print a list for a micro one month and then do another the next. This would ensure the league does not become too repetitive as it would change so much. Anyway, keep up the good work on CVG and best of luck for the future. S N Hardy, Sheffield. YOB: Here in Yob's corner keep personal lists of the best and worst letters received, people I hate most TOP OF THE TABLE ). A LARGE CHUNK Ole BARRY JEN KEEP THE CHANGE Dear Mr YOB, I'm writing this concerning the changes in CVG. 1. The charts. Very good. Including the Sega Master System and the Nintendo Enter tainment System was a wise choice and listing them by machine sales is even better. Full marks. 2. Putting in more than one person's opinion is much better but they seem to be very similar. The little pictures of the reviewers are funny and interesting. Overall, those changes seemed to be essen. tial (not the little pictures), SO very good again. 3. The CVG hit logo cool and modern. What more can I say? 4.

"REVIEW PC .99 BY ELECTRONIC ARTS It's that man again and back with a vengeance! Ace pilot and sky supremo Chuck Yeager returns to the cockpit for another slice of aerial action to make your head spin and your hair curl. Join Chuck through a wide variety of historic air battle conflicts. Wrestle at the controls of a fistful of aircraft through the skies of World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Thrill to the excitement as you single-handedly wipe out a bomber formation and turn to take on their fighter escort. Jump as they line up to attack, guns blazing through the clouds.

It's something slap bang in the middle and the result works brilliantly. Here is a game where absolutely everything is under the player's control: except the bad guys, of course! Ironically though, this is the game's one drawback you find you have so much power that the incentive to achieve every thing wanes after a while. Nonetheless, Electronic Arts have come up trumps with a package every PC owner should fight for. Great stuff. TIM With boxfuls of options at your disposal, Chuck certainly gives you plenty to play with. First up. you can chose to fly any of a multitude of pre-set historic missions, recreating combat scenarios from World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Having conquered that, you can create a mission of your own deciding how many other planes you want to fly against, what they are and how well their pilots cut the mustard. This is where the fun really starts! Fancy a duck shoot? Line yourself up a few flights of B52s without fighter escort and blow the blarney out of them from the comfort of the super fandango jet you chose from the options screen. For a close shave, try flying a B-52 at 10.000 feet against fifteen F-4s who hit you with a surprise attack. Hold onto your flying scarf and pray those suckers' quns are jammed! 098 BOONE "

Oh well, s'pose it's time to rescue them... In this well-hard Game Gear beat 'em up you take the role of the Single Shinobi left to battle against the evil forces holding a quartet of buddies hostage in four locations. Battle across the highway, the valley, the woodland and the harbour in a bid to save your captured chums from doom. Lurking at the end of each level is a dastardly boss which is GASP! under the control of one of your Shinobi mates! Defeat the boss and the Ninja quickly comes to his senses, and joins your side. From then on you can call upon your forces at any moment to take over the action, using their own special weapons and skills to do away with the terrible perils inside the last level. Neo City... KNOW YOUR PLACES! At the start of the game you have a choice of four locations in which to play, each requiring a different blend of skill and strategy to overcome the obstacles in your path. Here's a quick guide... THE HIGHWAY This level is quite easy, and the powerful Pink Shinobi lies at the end so it's a good A The round select screen. place to start.

Flying bad guys are the biggest bummer of this section, along with the little grey bloke with his spinning wheels of death. The second stage of this level is played inside and outside a massive pagoda which hides the Green Shinobi. Hiiiiyaaa! GG Shinobi is just the business! This must be one of the best beat-em-ups I've ever played even managing to knock some arcade games into a cocked hat. The graphics are excellent, the gameplay superb and the attention to detail absolutely amazing. You'll find it hard to believe that so much has been crammed into a portable game and will wear down a fair few batteries before beating this. GG is a showpiece for the Game Gear, showing just what's possible on Sega's colour handheld. More of the same, please! TIM BOONE 102 "

OSWOBIC HANGER-ON: This bloke actually knows how to walk on the ceiling, which can be quite a problem when you re trying to get past him and stay alive at the same time!

He is armed with a large sword, and can use his magic to make everything on the screen (apart from himself, of course) explodel Primitive weapons, its true, but when no one else seems to be making progress it's worth giving him a try. PINK Pink is one of the strongest Shinobi, and is the first you should look for. He's in a helicopter at the end of the Highway level. Pink is armed with grenades and can crawl upside down along platforms an ability which comes in very handy everywhere. His magic power is the ability to freeze everything on screen! YELLOW Yellow shoots magic fireballs from his fingertips, and these can be powered up by holding down the button. His special power is a devastating lightning bolt which annihilates every enemy in sight! An evil guardian! BLUE Blue comes complete with a blade on the end of a long chain which, as well as being a deadly weapon. can be used to swing from branch to branch in the forest His special magic turns him into a whirlwind which can travel anywhere on the screen! GREEN Green carries shurikens which take out anything they hit, and he can also perform a double leap, and a spin which sends a shower of deadly metal stars everywhere. Green reacts to danger by using his magic and exploding everywhere! As far as the actual games go, the Game Gear has been a bit of a non-starter until now! The programmers of GG Shinobi have performed wonders in making the Game Gear produce something that looks like a Megadrive game! In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it's one of the best beat 'em ups I've ever played anywhere, and the addition of strategy (working out the best ways to use the different Ninjas) makes it even better than Megadrive Revenge of Shinobi!

"REVIEW .99 ST ST 0:12:05 EDT 1 BY DOMARK 24116 It's time to put a funny cap on your head and trundle on down to DOMADA the disk-based digital diamond! RBI Baseball was originally a Tengen cartridge for the Nintendo and Domark have seen fit to release. a conversion for all major home formats The rules of baseball are pretty simple. There are two teams who bat and field alternately. Each member of the batting side has to score as many runs as possible by whacking the ball as far as it will go then running as far round the diamond as possible before the fielders can retrieve the ball. If a batter can get round all the bases, back to home base, he scores one run As soon as the ball is hit the outfielders have to try to catch it (thus instantly dismissing the batter) or failing that retrieve it and throw it to one of the other fielders on the bases if the ball reaches a base before a batter who is trying to \"steal\" it he is out MARK  Meanwhile, back on the pitching mound at the centre of the dia. mond, the pitcher has to try and get the batter out by throwing the ball in such a bizarre way that he cannot get his bar to it Each miss is a \"strike\" and if one batter scores three strikes, he is declared oul. Once three hitters have been struck out the fielders get the chance to bal. and vice versa. So, after that lecture on Baseball For The Completely Uninitiated what more is there to say except \"it's just like Rounders and perhaps \"play ball\"? The main action of the game takes place on this 3D screen. All that really happens is that the pitcher throws the ball, and it's the batter's job to slog it as far possible. Both the pitcher and the batter can slightly alter their positions, and the pitcher is ca. pable of throwing a fast or slow ball, and can put spin on it to make it curve left or right, in the hope that this will completely flummox the batter. the who BATTING 'N' PITCHING! HOME RUN! As soon as the bat connects with the ball the viewpoint changes to a bird's-eye view of the pitch which scrolls to follow the movement of the ball. Now it's the fielders job to get the ball to the appropriate base, to stop the batter from getting any nearer to home. If the fielders are a bit clumsy and waste time, then the batter may be able to \"steal\" one more base and get that much closer to home. If he hits the ball as far as the crowd. he is awarded a \"home run\", and he and all the other batters on the diamond get to run all the way to home base in complete safety, each scoring a run. 33 RBIB I must say, if you like Baseball games, RBI 2 Baseball is probably the best one on the market at the moment. However, if you're not really interested in Baseball, this polished Domark effort won't appeal to you at all. Unfortunately, I'm a member of the latter category and after a few minutes found the gameplay to be rather repetitive. Just hitting the ball and running, or running for the ball and throwing just didn't seem to be my cup of tea. Indeed, after about half an hour's play, I'd gone completely off the game. The graphics are very nice, and the sound is similarly impressive with some decent samples. The two-player mode increases the longevity of the game somewhat, but doesn't really add that much in the way of variety to the game. RBI 2 Baseball is mildly diverting, but for the hefty price (.99) I find it hard to strongly recommend this game. RICHARD LEADBETTER WHAT DOES RBI STAND FOR? RBI actually stands for Runs Batted In which in English means the amount of runs scored as a result of a single player's hit, which could be either his cuns, or the runs scored by getting other players back home. So now you know! 104 "

Fielder and dive for the ball, an l ag the runDS UPDATE RBI 2 Baseball is going to be hitting just about every 8 and 16-bit format. Expect to see the game appearing on the IBM PC and compatibles and Amiga (for the wallet-busting sum of .99) and C64, Spectrum and Amstrad (.99 on cassette and .99 on disk). DIAMOND-VISION! At regular intervals in the game, the action switches to the super Diamond-vision (tm) screen. Here. special animated sequences depict the outcome of the last play. Special sequences include \"Safe\" (when the player reaches a base safely). \"Home Run\". \"Foul Ball\" and \"Out!\". If a batter just makes it to a base before the ball, or if he's just run out, you re treated to a colour cartoon of him sliding toward the base. It's just like the colossal screens built into a real-like stadium, except RBI Baseball doesn't bother you with silly ads! Hurrah! ASEBALL 2 EN 29116  TETEL mm 105 "


"REVIEW RBI BASEBALL 2 RBI BASEBALL 2 COMPUTER BASEBALL Although there have been a number of Baseball games released in Britain, none of them have ever been really popular. probably because the sport itself isn't popular over here. The most successful of such games must be Accolade's Hardball which was programmed in the USA. In the USA and Japan. Baseball is extremely popular of course. so. not surprisingly, there are loads of Baseball games on console. Among them are Sega's Great Baseball and The Baseball, Nintendo Baseball and Neo-Geo Super Baseball Stars (a game with brilliant sampled commentary pity it costs .00!). Recently, Megadrive owners have been wowed by Super League Baseball, whilst Ac. colade have just finished converting Hardball to the same 16-bit system! Probably the most comprehensive Baseball games have appeared on the PC Engine, and the Power League series is now in it's third installment! However, Cinemaware are \"pitching\" in (ho ho) with their TV Sports Baseball which should spice up the competition, if it survives that company's recent fin ancial problems! I quite like the idea of computer baseball but I've always been put off by all the fiddly details and statistics which get in the way of the gameplay. Well, that's one flaw RBI doesn't have the controls are pretty simple. and you don't really have to take that much notice of all the statistics, so it's quite easy to get into. It also scores Brownie points for it's smart presentation, the samples and the Diamondvision screen, which looks great. Unfor tunately, even with all this going for it, the game isn't as much fun as you'd expect. Soccer and American Football are full of fast action and tactics and maybe it's just that Baseball doesn't make as good a computer game be cause it doesn't have enough of these two qualities, Whatever it is, I have my doubts about whether I would get thirty quid's worth of enjoyment out of RBI.

These guys gonna plomacy, so the only way to get rid of them is to send the Amance fleet to meet them and reduce them to their component molecules. What this boils down to in gameplay terms is a space shoot-out along the lines of the very ancient Space War coin-op ships battling it out in a 2D view of the galaxy. There are seven IWO ships in each fleet, and it's up to each commander (either or bomo which can be a computer or human player) to choose a shio torty into battle. They all have different capabilities and weapons, which make some craft better opponents than others. Each ship has a crew and fuel quotient Every time it is hile some crew are killed, and if the ship is unmanned it self-destrucis The fuel is used when the ship's weapons are activated, then slow y Teplenished.

In close quarter combat press the C button to make the female crew sing their mystical song which draws the enemy crew out of their ship. While they're floating in space, the Syreen can res, cue them and make them join their crew! ARILOULALEELAY SKIFF Probably the Alliance's best ship, the Arilou Skiff is equipped with a homing laser and an inertialess drive, so it's super-manoeuvrable. The short-range hyperspace drive, which warps the ship to another part of the screen, helps make this a match even for the Ur-Quan dreadnought. A very swift ship.

It's the sheer variety in all of the ships that makes this such a winare nothing to shout about, but the sound is excellent ner. The in-game graphics Indeed, a lot of the games turned into a bizarre version of \"Name That Tune\", or rather \"Name That Sample Wars and Star Trek have both been sampled here, and Star the end result is excellent. One-player mode isn't really that bad either. The full strategy game is quite compelling, and the option to play either side is rather original.

The Guardian is very sluggish and is armed with a completely hopeless main weapon which releases a cloud of wandering acid bubbles.

The Dreadnought is equipped with a forward-firing energy cannon but press the C button and a fleet of interceptors is launched from the hangar pods UPDATE Star Control has been out on all other formats for quite a few months now, but even the Amiga version (which looks very similar to the Megadrive version) isn't as playable as this one, because it's cursed with loads of disk-swapping.

SPATHI DISCRIMINATOR This craft may look clumsy. but it's one of the Heirarchy's fastest and most manoeuvrable ships. Don't be fooled! This game may look like a pile of crud, but it's one of the most enjoyable Megadrive titles I've played in ages! There are all those weapons to play with, and a lot of the fun comes from learning the best way to use them, and which ships make the best opponents. With two players this process is unbelievably good fun, but be prepared for a lot of rude words as your ex-companion blows up your best ship! Even the computer player is good, especially if you play on either the medium or highest of the three levels. The easiest oppo. nent doesn't use the special weapons, but the other two are so clever it's like playing a human. The graphics are adequate rather than great, but the sound effects are excellent-nearly all of them are sampled from SF movies or TV programmes. Anyone after something different from the usual scrolly-blast pap that's finished in a couple of days has just got to try Star Control. It's a whole new universe!

" hat wild 'n wacky family, the Simpsons have just appeared in their very own coin-opand it's just as nutty as their television programme! The plot revolves around baby Simpson Maggie, who's been abducted by a group of jewel thieves. The only thing for it is for the rest of the family to go and rescue her from the clutches of the evil hoodlums Up to four players can participate, with each member of the Simpsons family selectable for battle. The mission of mercy is split into a variety of levels which run across the length and breadth of Springfield: addicts of the TV series will instantly recognise such lo cations as the funfair, the park, the main street and even Moe's Ta. vern! Each level is packed full of hoodlums all out to nobble the heroic Simpsons and wear down their energy bars. Fortunately, each member of the family carries a weapon with which to dispatch the baddies so beat 'em up skills are the order of the day. As with all games of this type, at the end of each level lurks a giant guardian who must be duffed over to progress onwards. At the end of level one there's a giant wrestler next up is one of Krusty the Klown's minions. On the final level is the boss of the jewel thieves: defeat him and Maggie is rescued! THE SIMPSONS Similar in concept to the Turtles coin-op (hardly surprising. since it's designed to go into old Turtles cabinets). The Simpsons is nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable game. The graphics are absolutely marvellous, from the brilliant movie-style introductory sequence showing Maggie's abduction to the ingame graphics, it's just like playing a cartoon. There are so many neat touches just watch the expressions and reactions of the characters as they do battle, they're hilarious. The sound effects are also excellent all sam pled from the cartoon and there's a version of the Simpsons tune thumping away maniacally in the background, which adds greatly to the frantic atmosphere. Add this all together, and mix in the mega-addictive gameplay and you've got a coin-op that offers loads of fun... and keeps you pumping in the credits! EL JAZZO RIGNALL 116 "

"PREVIEW VERSION MASTER SYSTEM DATE SEPTEMBER PRICE .99 ega owners aren't exactly well catered for when it comes to vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups (Powerstrike is probably the only decent one that comes to mind) Not to worry though because Mirrorsoft are set to redress the balance with the re lease of Xenon 2: Megablast! The aim of the game is pretty simple. Travel along the vert cally scrolling play area roasting and a-toasting Xenite poste rior with the aid of your attack fighter Loads or pick-ups are on offer, ranging from heavy duty lasers to cannons and missiles. There are also the less interesting icons like the speed up and smart bomb, made available simply by blasting away at the icon-carrying Xenites! Mirrorsoft reckon that the finished game will be ready for a September release, and from what we ve seen the game looks completely brill Expect to see a review of the finished package as soon as possible. M E GAB MEGABLAST VENUES The original Amiga blast had five levels of blasting action, but due to memory restrictions only the best three can make it into the Sega cartridge. The idea is that the evil Xenites have planted time bombs in various stages of the Earth's past, and our time-travelling attack craft has to rescue history by annihilating each bomb in turn. But the Xenites aren't going make things easy... DO-27 107771 2 000MOOL ! A 06h BLERIN OOOOOO PLAYER LAZIZ 120 "


"EXPLOSIONS 'R' US At the end of each level, after the player has seen off a massive boss, a trip to the shop occurs. Here, the player can buy new weapons systems as well as sell off all of the obsolete systems. Side-fire, rear-fire, mines, drones, extra energy, massive lasers and cannons can all be purchased if you've got the necessary wonga! A B L A S T THE COMPARISON QUESTION The ST and Amiga versions of Xenon 2: Megablast fared extremely well when they were first reviewed in CVG, scoring a massive 95% and 96% respectively! From the pre-production Sega version we've seen, the graphics look extremely close to the 16-bit originals, with the action only slowing down when there are a lot of sprites and bullets on-screen at the same time. There's also a surprisingly small amount of flicker as well! 121 "

"HPREVIEW VERSION MASTER SYSTEM DATE TBA PRICE   PERSIA Drincely Master System games freaks are in for a treat the brilliant Prince of Persia will be taking a bow on a Sega, near you soon! Converted by Domark, publishers of the original sword-and, puzzle computer classic, this console conversion is looking very good indeed and (dare we say it?) actually better than the original Taking the role of a rather dashing young hero, run, jump and fight your way through screen after screen of puzzles, traps and bad guys to rescue the Princess from the nasty old Grand Vizier Jaffar. She's trapped in her room high in the palace tower and you've been stripped of your sword and thrown in the dungeon If you want to live happily ever after, you've got to get to that Damsel before the Sultan marries her... The main strengths of the original Prince of Persia were its stunning animation and great playability, Work is now well under way on the Master System version and from what we've seen the results are looking absolutely brill. Domark have paid a lot of attention to the graphics and spent some serious time making sure the game feels the same.

Krysalis are now set to repeat the glory with the imminent release of Manchester United Europe. Viewed in a similar fashion to the original, this new footy spectacular has vastly improved audio-visuals (the crowd constantly cheer or murmur, depending on how the action is going) and the choice of teams available includes all the teams selected to go into Europe's major football tournaments next year! BRYAN ROBSON MUE also has an Kick Off 2-style aftertouch option, giving improved ball control as well as almost-pinpoint accuracy for corners. throw-ins, and free kicks and the ability for headers and volleys! Penalties are also awarded for fouls inside the six-yard box, and yellow and red cards are dished out for players who can't keep their boots to themselves! If a player is injured badly enough, he can be substituted for one on the bench. Unfortunately, MUE arrived at CVG Central too late for a full review this issue, but rest assured we'll be having a close look at this next month. The question remains does Kick Of 2 have anything to fear? Find out soon! Le Friendly Match Manchester United England Besiktas Turkey 125 "


"PREVIEW H VERSION DATE PRISE VERSION NINTENDO DATE AUGUST PRICE   CAPTAIN SKYHAWK fall our brave flyboys, one man stands out from the crowd: it's Captain Skyhawk! With a chin to out-square the best of them, he's the one to be chosen to take his Tomcat out for a spin and blast those alien rotters who have decided that Earth is a bit shagged out and should be ripe for the taking Whether they're right is up to you in this five-level alien bashing spectacular. Each level consists of three stages, the first being an air-to-ground vertical shoot 'em up. Complete this and it's off into the blue skies for an Afterburner-esque blast, Then comes a tricky docking procedure requiring pixel-perfect accuracy unless you want to be so much dog food and metal shards. Once you're safe inside HQ. it's toddle-down-to-the-shops time with any credits earned whilst in battle to buy a load of missiles, before you're ejected back into the wide, blue yonder to do the same again! This latest release from ex-Ultimate chaps Rare has to be something special to continue the company's tradition of high, quality releases Whilst most blasters start off relatively simple and become more difficult as you go. Captain Skyhawk seems to do exactly the opposite and becomes easier as you progress! Strange. One of the biggest complaints about Afterburner was the lack of things to do apart from shoot planes out of the sky, mak, ing it a bit of a lame horse in the long-term playability stakes. But why waste a good idea just because it fell flat on its face as a stand-alone shoot 'em up? The programmers of Captain Skyhawk have simply squashed the full game down and made it into just one stage of their blaster This Elite-inspired stage sees the sweaty-palmed player lining his aircraft up with the entrance to the revolving space station in order to spiral toward and into it without scraping the sides. And if that's what you do, you'll need more than a few licks of paint and a sticky plaster to cover the scratches! DESTROY ENERY 1985 200559712 126 "


"PREVIEWH VERSION AMIGA DATE TBA PRICE   STAVROS FASOULAS All's been quiet from Finland's foremost coder since 1988, when he impressed the C64-Owning public with the brilliant ball-rolling Que Dex (Quest for Ultimate Dexterity). Now, Stavros Fasoulas is about to amaze the Amiga owners of 1991 with Galactic: The Vision Game. There isn't much of a scenario as such. The player adopts the role of a king in a distant galaxy who gleans much amusement from playing the Galactic game. There is no certain goal: just fast, frenetic action as you guide your king, blasting all-andsundry with explosive playing cards of doom. The aim is just to survive as long as possible! Galactic has been in production for seven months now and most of the graphics and gameplay are complete. Stavvy's managed to coax this Amiga game into running at 50 frames a second (that's as fast and smooth as most coin-ops) and there's usually over 50 sprites on-screen at once. From the look of the screenshots, Galactic looks like a very busy game and we're led to believe that it's one of the fastest games ever (Stavros reckons it's faster than both Defender and Stargate!). In order to keep the action fast and fluid Galactic is a single load game, so there's no waiting around for new levels to be loaded in! Galactic promises to be one of the most playable games ever to hit a 16-bit machine and we look forward to receiving a finished copy! 127 "
