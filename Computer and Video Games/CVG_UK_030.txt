"<MAILBAGE ANNOYED ATARI FAN even on MINERS JUST CAN'T WIN! machine's other functions VIDEOGAMING filing systems. In any event HALL OF FAME? Dear Sir, I was compelled, nay forced, to put pen to paper after reading David Gardener's letter concerning Atari sound. I read with total astonishment that the Commodore 64 (jumped up Vic-20 perhaps?) has vastly superior sound to the magnificent Atari 800. After banging my head against the wall several times, I read it again. Yep! That's what it says! Has this man had his head buried in the ground for the last few years or is he just deaf! Perhaps he ought to listen to the sound on Preppie or Shamus or Necromancer or well the list is endless! I think he may have judged it by listening to Choplifter, which I concede is absolutely terrible although graphically quite good. No computer can compete with the 800's sound capability, with the exception of the new XL range. Also he states that the games for the 64 can be made as good as the Atari's. Well, isn't it about time. After all these years the 800 has been on the market, it's only now that rival firms are coming anywhere close to being graphically as good -although still not better! He wonders if 800 or 400 owners are biased of course we are! Who wouldn't be when they have a machine which is so vastly superior in every department gameswise — to any other home micro currently on the market. Maybe Mr Gardener should stick to the old pingpong games and leave home micros well alone! Gary Campbell Preston, Lancs. defeated the computer on the vocabulary (possibly even on difficult game.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPET. ICALISTO'S ,000 WINNER! CALLING ALL THOSE CARTOONISTS Nineteen year old David Thomas is ,000 richer and also looking forward to a career as a full time computer games writer with Adventure International as a result of entering one of our competitions. Birmingham-based Calisto Software challenged C&VGs readers in our June \"83 edition to write a game good enough to sell commercially, David immediately sat down at his Atari 800 and, after many hours bashing his keyboard, gave birth to Warlock a super fast, Scramble-type; shoot-'emup with truly stunning graphics. Calisto were so impressed with the game that they have now marketed it commercially and are about to release a Commodore 64 version of the game. The ,000 cheque supplied by Calisto's managing director, Mike Woodruffe, was presented to David at the Golden Joystick awards in London last month by disc jockey Dave Lee Travis. David intends to spend a large part of his winnings on computer equipment to enable him to write more games. Writing games looks like becoming quite an important part of David's life as, since the competition, he has been offered a full time job by Adventure International. Adventure International's boss, Scott Adams, has invited David over to the company's Florida head office in America to sign a contract and take a course in adventure writing techniques under the guidance of the grand master him. self.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPET THE SUN SETS ON Joe the lion THE SEVENTH EMPIRE Well, it's finally over. The last turn of the Seventh Empire has been run, and a worthy winner has emerged. And if your player number was 3201 then congratulations! You've won yourself a spanking new ColecoVision games centre, currently the best seller in the States. But before you frantically search for that crumpled piece of paper with that magic number on ... don't. Unless, that is, you happen to live in Sandringham Close, Haxby, York and be called T. White. You do? Great. Well done! But just in case you're not Mr. White, then here's how the game went. Top score, as above, was obtained by T. White; player number 3201. His overall total for all six turns of the game stands at a massive 17,331 — well worth a Coleco. So near, and yet so far, was runner-up player number 1781. This code belongs to Bob Wade from Orpington, Kent. His overall score is 16,009. I'm sure that we can find a suitable consolation prize for Bob. How 'bout it, Tim? The remainder of the Seventh Empire hall of fame looks like this, running down from positions 3 to 10: A. Capaldi, Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear third with 11,678; David Speight, Carleton, Blackpool fourth with 11,317, fifth was J. Woodhall of Wickford, Essex with 10,992; sixth was P. Tong of Leigh Park, Havant, Hants with 10,386, seventh was W. Mole of Ecclesfield, Sheffield with 9,615; W. Wood from Chorley, Lancs was eighth with 9,013; G. Anderson of Kempston, Bedford was ninth with a score of 8,628 and finally, P. Walker of Woodford Green, Essex was tenth with 8,626 points. If you do still have any queries, please drop me a line and I'll do my best to answer them. (Write to the Seventh Empire at the address on the Bug Hunter page.) Once upon a time there were hundreds of software companies selling lots of exciting games to computer gamers all over the country. Then, suddenly, an evil force came along and whisked all the poor little software companies off to an enchanted land where they all got jumbled up and lost their powers to create all that fun and frivolity for the poor micro owners. Then one day a saviour appeared on the horizon in the shape of Joe the Lion! He discovered a mystic book which contained the curse which kept all the software houses in the power of the evil forces. All he needed to do was unravel the mixed-up names of the software houses from the mysterious story. But poor old Joe needs your help. Can you find the names of the unfortunate software companies hidden in the following story?

"GAME OF Sophie R-E-V.I.E.W.SE Essa FANFARE FOR THE FALLEN FLEA BOOG-A-BOO Every now and then a game comes along that's so revolutionary, so full of new ideas that you know it will be a winner the minute you set eyes on it. Boog a Boo is one such game. Set in a world of weird and wonderful vegetation, you play the part of Boog a Boo the flea who's fallen down into a deep chasm and is trying to escape. You must make the flea jump onto the numerous ledges in the cavern in an effort to escape to the surface. You control Boogie by tapping the joystick making him hop, skip or jump according to the strength. The graphics are breath-taking easily the best to come from a British software company. The game requires timing and co-ordination rather than a fast firing action and is addictive and frustrating in the extreme. The whole C&VG team fought over it for three days — a record equalled only by Mattel's Burger Time.

With three different coloured balls and Slick, the colour-changer, in hot pursuit, Q*bert has to keep his wits about him as he hops round the pyramid changing the coloured squares by jumping on them. Coily and Wrongway are the ones to watch they're out for Q*bert's blood. Luckily for Q*bert, there are two escape discs he can use when in dire straits. If he jumps on to these at an opportune moment, Coily will leap after him straight into the void. Slick, who's just plain obstructive, makes life harder for the long-suffering Q'bert as, every time he jumps on a square, it changes colour and Q*bert has to keep backtracking to change them back again As you get further into the game, Q'bert will have to jump on each square twice to go through two colour changes in one level. Unfortunately the graphics capabilities on the G7000 portray Q*bert and his pals in block graphics rather like little Legocreatures. There are no rounded edges and he loses that rather cute look he has when portrayed on machines like the Atari VCS.

"ZO--<AZD OZCOM Try to imagine a disco without a light show. You can't can you! How about a Pink Floyd concert without all the lasers and other visuals. Totally impossible! Well for all these years you've been sitting at home playing your records or tapes and probably staring vacantly at the wallpaper or the latest pop pin-up posters from Smash Hits. You can change that immediately by simply programming in your very own Sound to Graphics program. Colin Holgate, graphics expert with the band called Mainframe, has come up with some programs which will transform the way you listen to your record collection. In order to create some graphics that respond to any music, rather than graphics synchronised to just one song, a process similar to normal sound to light methods you see in action at your local disco has to be adapted for your micro. Usually sound is fed into a box of tricks, its frequency worked out and something pretty happens. With a computer, the sound is fed into the cassette input, the software works out a value related to the input frequency which can then be used as a variable in a graphics routine. In the programs on the following pages, the values taken from the cassette input control create kaleidoscopic patterns or a \"spectrum analyser\" graphlike effect. Machine code must be used in order to read the sound input fast enough to reach an accurate pitch-related value. On many current home computers, the incoming sound has the effect of setting or not setting a single bit in a particular byte or set of bytes, depending on whether the signal is above or below a certain level. For example, bit 7 of location C060 (49248 decimal) in the Apple Il is set to 1 if the input is high. Likewise bit 6 of location 7FFE (32766 decimal) in the Spectrum works the same way. A sine wave signal coming into the computer will appear as a sequence of ones and zeros. By timing how long it takes for one incoming signal to change from one state to the other, we can get an idea of its frequency. The timing value could control colour, position or length of a drawn line in your graphics routine or whatever you wish. For BBC or Electron owners, things are a little different when it comes to the cassette input. Both these micros have dedicated chips that present the computer with complete bytes when they read from the cassette. This makes working out the frequency tricky at best. However, a limited affect can be achieved by simply seeing if there is a sound or not. The program for these computers printed here does something Illustration: Micky Finn "


"FOR THE APPLE 8888 along those lines. Even the originator of the program isn't sure exactly how it works — so you'll just have to sit back and enjoy the effects! Each of the programs require a sound source at the cassette input. This can easily be done, the only problem being that in most cases you won't be able to hear the music! But there are two ways around this. Connect your computer to a headphone output on your system that doesn't cut off sound from the amplifier. To do this, you will probably need a simple jack plug adaptor for your computer lead. These are available from all good hi-fi stores. If your portable cassette player has a built in microphone, connect it to the computer as usual, then place it near a speaker with the record/play/pause buttons pushed down. Please remember that connecting a speaker output to your computer is definitely NOT a good idea. These programs will react to any outside sound source, not just music. Have fun playing around with them! Since the BBC/Electron program was written, Basic 2 has appeared for the BBC B. With Basic 2, the expressions M%= ?FE04+ ? & FE09 has a different effect to the one intended. For safety, if you have a BBC B, change this part of line 240 to read M%=?&FE09. Likewise change line 260 to read N%=?&FE09 etc. A a B 888988887 88.888 04 OE8034 08 OF OB 11 33 55 77 OE8899 BB DD FF 22 44 66 88 OE90AA CC EE 11 33 55 77 99 OE98BB DD FF 22 44 66 88 AA OEAoCC EE 00 00 OEAB00 OEBO00 00 00 OEBB00 00 Oo oo OECO00 00 00 02 02 01 01 OEC801 01 01 OEDO03 03 OED806 06 OEEO08 08 OEE8CO 85 02 E8 FO OEFOCO 45 02 10 F6 A2 OEF860 CO 85 02 E8 OF0060 CO OF0820 58 2C 56 OF 10co 20 50 CO 20 D1 OF 1883 OE 85 FD 2000 CO 10 OF 2016 2C 10 CO AZ 1F A9 00 OF 289D A4 OE CA 10 EA EA OF 30EA EA EA EA 4C BO OF 20 OF 38E4 OE FO 3C 4A 4A 4A AA OF 4085 FE A9 1F 38 ES FE 18 OF 4869 04 85 FE BD 84 OE 85 OF5030 BD C4 OE 85 FC BD A4 OF58OE C9 30 FO 1B FE A4 OE OF 6085 FF A9 2F 38 E5 FF A4 OF 68FE 20 00 F8 C6 FC FO 08 OF 70AO 00 88 DO FD 4C 56 OF OF 78C6 FD DO AO A9 00 85 30 OF 80A2 00 AO 23 BD A4 OE FO OF88OD DE A4 OE 85 FF A9 30 OF9038 ES FF 20 00 88 E8 OF98EO 20 DO E8 AD 83 OE 85 OFAOFD 4C 1C OF 2C 52 CO 2C OFA850 CO 2C 56 CO 2C 54 Co OF BOA9 FF 85 FA 20 D1 10 A OFB81E 85 07 A9 00 85 06 AO OFCO0091 06 C8 DO FB 20 E4 OFC8OE 86 08 20 E4 OE 86 09 OFDO4C E9 OF AD 60 CO 29 30 OFD885 OA A2 00 AD 60 OFEOFO 06 29 80 CS OA FO OFE860 AS 08 4A 4A 4A OFFO30 02 A9 00 85 08 AS OFF84A 4A 4A C9 14 30 02 1.00000 85 09 AO 00 A9 1008ES OB 91 06 A9 13 18 101008 C8 91 06 A9 13 38 101809 CB 91 06 A9 13 18 1020-09 CB 06 AS 08 FO 1028EA 10304A 4A 1038-F8 20 63 10 AS 06 1040BO 85 06 A9 00 20 104820 63 105085 105810 10604C 14 1068OA AO 107069 04 20 00 F8 107806 A4 OA 18 69 108000 F8 AO 01 B1 06 108820 00 F8 84 OA AO 109006 A4 OA 18 69 04 109800 F8 68 38 E9 04 85 10AOAO 00 B1 06 A4 OA 18 10A804 20 00 F8 AO 10BOA4 OA 18 69 04 10B8-F8 AO 03 B1 06 A8 68 10C000 F8 84 OA AO 00 1008A4 OA 18 10DO60 A9 04 10D806 AO 00 A9 00 91 10E0DO FB E6 07 A5 07 C9 10E8DO F1 60 00 00 00 00 &1818333%9588%88%8888888 FOR THE BBC & ELECTRON 10 MODE 1 20 PRINT 30 COLOUR 2 40 PRINT \"Sound to Graphics program.\" 50 PRINT 60 PRINT \"For BBC Model B and Acorn Electron.\" 70 PRINT:PRINT:PRINT (preferably mu 80 COLOUR 3 90 PRINT \"This program requires any sound source\":PRINT:PRINT sic) to be connected to\":PRINT: PRINT\"the cassette input on this computer.\" 100 PRINT:PRINT: COLOUR 1:PRINT \"Adjust the volume until the input level : PRINT :PRINT \"is about the same as is required for\":PRINT:PRINT \"loading programs. 110 COLOUR 3 120 PRINT:PRINT:PRINT \"Adjustment of the volume control wi 11\":PRINT:PRINT \"var y the graphic's response.\" 130 PRINT:PRINT:PRINT \"To exit the display press'Escape'.\" 140 PRINT:PRINT:PRINT:PRINT_\"PRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE.\" 150 A = GET 160 ONERROR MODE7: END 170 MODE 2 180 FOR L = 0 TO 15: VDU19,1,0,0,0,0: NEXT 190 FOR L% = O TO 638: COLOUR 128+ABS (10-LZ MOD 20)+ABS (16-L% DIV 20):PRINT; \" \" : NEXT 200 VDU23; 8202;0;0;0 210 L% = ?&FE10: L% = ?&FE11 220 REPEAT 230 VDU19, L%,0,0,0,0 240 P% = 0: REPEAT P2 = 2% + 1:M% = ?XFE04 + ?&FE09: UNTIL (P% = 100) OR (M% <> NZ) 250 IF P2 = 100 THEN FOR P2 = 0 TO 15: VDU19,2%,0,0,0,0,: NEXT: GOTO 240 260 NZ =2&FE04 + 2&FE09: VDU19, LZ + NZ DIV 64, NZ MOD 8,0,0,0 270 L% = (L% + NZ) MOD 15 280 UNTIL FALSE COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 57 "

"That cute little monster, Q*bert, is back and swearing louder than ever. The little chap has been turning the air blue and pyramids assorted colours in arcades for some time now. But now with the help of Jason Rider, the cuddly curser has bounced right back for the Dragon 32 — with suitable alterations of course. We're a family magazine folks! Just like the arcade game, Q*bert has to leap from square to square on the pyramid changing the colour of every cube. But his life isn't without dangers.

"THE HOBBIT WINNER STRATEGY GAME OF THE YEAR PENETRATOR RUNNER-UP BEST ARCADE GAME OF THE YEAR THE HOBBIT RUNNER-UP GAME OF THE YEAR MELBOURNE HOUSE RUNNER-UP SOFTWARE HOUSE OF THE YEAR Dhankyou ME 1983 GOLDEN JOYSTICK AWARDS "


"1983 GOLDEN JOYSTICK AWARDS A glittering gathering of software stars congregated at Mortons restaurant, in London's posh Berkeley Square, last month to celebrate Computer and Video Games' first ever Golden Joystick Awards presentations. All the top names from the British software industry were there waiting to discover just who would go home clutching one of our coveted Golden Joysticks. Radio One DJ Dave Lee Travis a self confessed computer fan was there to present the prizes and, as the time for the awards to be announced approached, tension mounted among the rival programmers and software house supremos alike as they waited with bated breath to hear the news. First up was our Golden Joystick Award for the best Arcade Style Game of 1983. Nominations were Penetrator from Melbourne House, Arcadia from Imagine Zalaga from Ardvark and Manic Miner from Bug Byte. The winner was the ever popular Manic Miner so the first Golden Stick was received by John Phillips from Bug Byte and the man behind Manic Miner, programmes Matthew Smith. Next came the award for Best Strategy Game which went to The Hobbit, 1983's most popular Adventure, from Melbourne House. Other nominations in this class were Football Manager from Addictive Games, Planet Invasion from Microdeal and Scrabble from Psion. Best Original Game nominations included Psst! from Ultimate Play the Game, Ant Attack, that wonderful three dimensional adventure from Quicksilva, Splat! from Incentive, and Ah Diddums from Imagine. Winner of the Golden Joystick in this category was the game with that cute teddy bear, Ah Diddums! Moving on to the main award of the day, Game of the Year, the nominations were The Hobbit, Manic Miner, Jet-Pac from Ultimate and Arcadia from Imagine. After a suitable pause for effect, Dave Lee Travis told the assembled multitudes that Ultimate's Jet-Pac was Game of the Year 1983! Ultimate's Carol Ward stepped up to receive the award and thanked all C&VG's 80,000plus readership for making the game an award winner. Ultimate's representatives didn't have much time to settle back in their seats as Tim Stamper was called up to receive the Golden Joystick Award for Software House of the Year -the final award in the ceremony. Other nominations in this category included Melbourne House, imagine and Jeff Minter's Llamasoft. After much applause and merrymaking, the first award ceremony came to an end and the software houses were already planning new games to compete for the 1984 Golden Joystick Awards.

"WALKING | THE CC PLANK Land lovers beware this game could make you very sea sick! There's mutiny aboard the ship. The crew have rebelled against your cruel and tyrannical regime. Half starved and beaten to within inches of death, the crew have taken you and the rest of the officers prisoner. The crew are preparing your demise and have already nailed a plank to the ship's deck. The men have decided to prolong your agony by asking you questions. Each question you answer wrongly means one more step nearer Davey Jones's locker. Each correct one and you can return to the relative safety of the deck. The game features animated graphics, including the captain of the ship and sword-waving mutineers. To save the game onto tape just break into the program and type GOTO 5200. Program notes In the listing the line is formed by typing in Poke 16510,0 and then newline. Variables along the horizontal position of the captain man = vertical position of the captain a = random number generated z = test to see if the number is high or low y = to see if the number is correct Illustration: Dorian Cross RUNS ON ZX81 IN 16K BY PETER BEEBE "

One pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards for at-a-glance setting to your games requirements. AGF PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE Recognised as the only true Hardware Programmed joystick interface this product offers all the features associated with such a design. You can use any Atari-compatible joystick controller with any software for your Sinclair Spectrum or ZX81, not just those with a joystick option. Movement of the joystick is recognised by the computer exactly the same as pressing the appropriate control keys, and can therefore give the most immediate response to that movement. The hardware programmed design works with all possible key-reading methods, both BASIC and Machine Code. Eight directional movement, with or without the fire button being pressed, can be achieved by only programming the left, right, up, down and fire keys required by the game. Programming is achieved by a two-digit code, which is looked up on the Programming Chart supplied for each direction and firing button. These two numbers are then selected on a pair of leads which are clipped onto appropriately numbered strips on the interface. Once configured this can be marked onto a Quick Reference Programming Card for storing with the game. As the programming is not power dependent the interface can be immediately used when next switched on. The keyboard remains fully functional and can be used simultaneously with the joystick. An integral rear expansion connector means there is no need to remove the interface to connect other peripherals. NB. A recent design improvement now means that the AGF Programmable Interface works with the new Quickshot Il rapid \"Auto Fire\" feature. 12 months guarantee and full written instructions.

"HELPLINE Help for Andrew Kennedy, troubled with Velnor's Lair comes from Jonathan and Alex Gick. You cannot pass the waterfall, they say. Their advice is to go north from the central cavern, feed a corpse to the crocs, and use a large bath to cross the river. Haunted House is a game I very rarely hear about, but it has one Adventurer troubled. Martin Ward of Farnborough, has braved animated armour, passed a wall of fire, and cannot deal with a mere ghost on the second floor! It's been mopping-up time over Christmas for many Adventure players. A number of readers have written in to claim a game completed, or record beaten. Lords of Karma has brought forth another record breaker Graham Potts, from Cowplain, had the game for Christmas, and by the 28th December had amassed a total of 970 Karma points, beating our previous high of 957. Can anyone top that? Another quick score was made on Hobbit on the '64, by novice Adventurer (it was his first), Terry Dibden of London W6. 100% was run up in little over a week after he received it as a Christmas present! At least — he THINKS it was 100% yet another Hobbit-bug appeared after he scored 95%, and told him his score was <0.0%. But the cheering crowd were there as usual! Golden Voyage is a mere puzzle compared with Empire of the Overmind, writes K. Stavron of Liverpool. After a six-month struggle he has completed Overmind the first such claim to fame I've had. But it is not all a success story. Matthew Howell of Wednesbury can shoot electric eels, but can't prevent a crab from devouring him. Has anyone out there solved this Devils of the Deep problem? Among the other troubled pleas for help: Opening a courtyard door in Castle Colditz, from Paul Waterman. Have shovel can't dig, have boat and paddles can't sail, in Calixto Island, from G. Laurie. Can't escape from railway carriage in Ten Little Indians, from Chris Jones. Blinded by flash of light in philosopher's lab, in PO, from Adrian Baldwin. Finally, another bug. Jason Warren from Jersey has found one in Valhalla! Surprise surprise! In the Cave at Hell, he typed JUMP, and his Spectrum said \"Integer out of range\". Have you tried \"Sell food\" yet Jason? That gives you a different error! trated booklet that comes with the game! I played the Dragon version, which, as expected was irritatingly sluggish at times. Beeb owners can expect a much snappier response. And some final advice for those of you who buy this game — keep trying underwater if you can't avoid the whirlpool! I would put money on that being the only way out for many, until you hit upon the right sequence! Fishy Business is from Salamander Software, for Dragon 32, BBC B, and Oric, price .95. FISH FINGERS AND PIECES OF COD! I'm stranded on an island about the size of a postage stamp, with the temperature plummeting upwards, and only my space ship for company. My ship seems to have developed a dislike for me, and tells me to go away. I ask if it knows how to get out of this place. \"No, but if you hum a few bars I can fake it!\" comes the reply. You've guessed it — with corny lines like that I've got to be Dan Diamond again, returned from being lost in space and up to something rather fishy. So, like the only book I had with me said, I took the plunge, and did a bit of underwater exploration. I found a whole world down there, and even bumped into old Sparrowhawk, who gasped a dire message about a princess, and dived off into the pool in the cavern. A lot of help he was! I tried to follow him, but he was gone. If only he had told me where, but he hadn't, and I ended up revolving eternally ... In fact, I kept revolving eternally. Passing down through underwater caverns, and swimming blindly in the dark — no lamp to see where I was heading I kept hitting the same watery current. After some hours of trying different sequences of directions, I suspended operations, strongly suspecting that there was another exit down there and I couldn't find it. The only way out, I decided, was to GO SOUTH and visit Salamander Software, the publishers of Fishy Business, the third in the Dan Diamond Trilogy. By the time I arrived to speak to Pete Neal, I really did feel like Dan Diamond, for it was lashing down with rain, liberally mixed with sea-spray blowing up from the sea front. Pete took pity on me, and confided that the dark underwater was confiIT CAN'T BE DONE! A few months ago I suggested that a reader who had completed an Adventure game might care to swap it with another, through these pages. It all sounded fine, but when it came to the point, I found there were unforeseen problems. Should we print a list of swap-shop offers? We concluded that if we were to print a list of offers and leave readers to contact each other, the Adventure page would read like a list of classified ads! And if a swapper offered a popular game how would he deal with the situation if he received dozens of letters? Alternatively, if we arranged the swaps at this end, then the Helpline would be at risk, since the task of arranging swaps would be tremendous. All in all, we decided the idea was not one of our more practical suggestions. So to all those of you who have written in hoping to arrange a swap sorry! Swap shop is no more! gured to confuse. \"Yes, there is more than one exit\" he confirmed, and grasping a pen in his tentacles, wrote a ROE of letters on a sheet of damp paper. Thus I was able to explore underwater tunnels leading to a sea-horse stable, a kitchen specialising in fishballs and cod pieces, and more corn! So have fun with Faint-hearted Franklin once more, and see if you can achieve the objective set by Sparrowhawk. If you do you'll be well rewarded with a final laugh! I know I have been PEEKing RAM again! I liked this one better than Lost in Space.

"Not at all what I expected from a crea ture from Berkeley Square. Strange! Oh! Yeah! I just got it! But where was the lamp for the Adventurer? So how do I escape? \"Up\" says the book trouble is I am disoriented and keep running into walls. The answer must be locked in the control panel. Now this has ten buttons and six indicator lights quite a number of combinations, or is there a code staring me in the face? Whatever the answer I must hurry! I hear faint mechanical noises coming from outside ...! It's all in the buttons and light, I have now decided. And I'm getting the hang of them I think! Where did I read that this game should take a few weeks on average? A chiller in more ways than one! The scene is set with such realism I can imagine a future advertisement: \"You've played the game now see the film!\" And when that happens, Adventure games will have really arrived! Snowball is from Level 9 Computing, price .90, and available for BBC (B). Commodore 64, Spectrum 48k, Lynx 48k, Nascom 32k, Oric 48k, and Atari 32k. If you have one of these micros and like a difficult adventure buy it! Note that only the BBC version comes with the title music. MORE TIPS FROM THE CHANNEL ISLANDS! MUSIC TO FREEZE BY! I never thought it possible that I would actually start writing about a game whilst it was still loading! But I have been won over before the tape is halfway through! The gentle tones of an organ are playing a captivating melody in two voices through the speaker of my BBC micro, as Snowball from Level 9 loads. Here, then, is the first game I have ever wanted to carry on loading. A cover picture\" I am used to, but a full-length classic rendering? Incredible! I contacted Level 9, to discover the name of the piece. It is Winter from the Four Seasons by Vivaldi. A very appropriate title to accompany this adventure! But will the game be as enjoyable as its theme tune? Snowball seems an unlikely name for a science fiction adventure. The booklet supplied with the game gives a fully documented background, and the personal history of Kim Kimberley, the part you are about to play. Snowball 9 is a vessel assembled in space, and fuelled by frozen ammonia in which it is encapsulated, to take its cargo of colonists from Ceres base. Kim was specially trained as a secret agent, to be awoken from her freezercoffin only if something went wrong aboard Snowball on its journey to Eirdani A. And something just has. The game, when eventually loaded, runs in black and white text, (not surprising, as it is claimed to have 7,000 locations) and has a good response speed. The text is wordy enough to be interesting, and perhaps mysterious rather than cryptic. After my first few moves, having just read the booklet, I began to feel I was taking part in a film rather like a cross between 2001 and Alien. Cold shivers were the order of the day, for the second time around. I knew that the clanking mechanical noises getting nearer and nearer, sometimes fading, sometimes not, were coming from a Nightingale. Nightingales are great big ugly black things with hypos and syringes inside. Our nutter from the channel islands has been fiddling with his BEEB again: Dear Data-Twiddler, I'm back again, and I've got lots of tips for all you lot out there in Computerland! Firstly, how about Hobbitbug number 475? By simply typing EN DO, the sword breaks, Gollum dies and the black river evaporates! Secondly, Artic's Adventure A. Last time I wrote I told you how to find the coin. Now I'll tell you how to use it. Bribe the guard, I think he MIGHT just do something useful. Signed J. Yeates (a total loony) P.S. The password is \"Joshua\" or \"Hovver Bovver\", guys, and I'm not telling you which! Keith: Wow! Now all we need is the game to go with the password we don't know! A correspondent whose letters 1 always look forward to is Simon Marsh, from New Malden in Surber's edition, I came to the conclusion that adventure players are the best computer users kind, friendly, and always helpful. If the above is true, why are the software houses still releasing 'unfriendly' games, e.g. Mad Martha? The most frustrating thing I have found about some adventures is the lack of save-game facility. This really does make me mad. The writers should endeavour not to let this fundamental operation be missing in any form of adventure. I was upset not to see an Adventure page in the Year Book, though your Vespozian Affair was a consolation. I've not had time to key it in yet, but I'm sure it is a great game. I must go now, the Dragon's getting hungry and wants something soft to eat! Keith: Ooops! Vespozian hasn't a save-game feature! And has been described by my nearest and dearest as the worst Adventure ever written! (They find it too difficult!) rey: Dear Keith, After I read your article in Octo116 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"kit, and at  it has to be about the best value program available. Night Mission is Sublogic's offering, from the author of Flight Simulator on the IBM PC now available for the Atari as Flight Simulator. Its unusual qualities are that over 40 variables can be altered and that the sound comes solely out of the keyboard speaker and doesn't sound too bad at that. For the cassette player owner, this is the best buy, unless you can contact Synapse Software in the States and get hold of their program Slam Ball, which again is innovative in its concept. Although I have never seen it in the flesh, the message through the grapevine is that the screen scrolls around following the ball. David's Midnight Magic and Raster Blaster are very similar and both of these excellent games, along with Night Mission, are included as playable demonstrations in the Pinball Construction set. tarisof SCORE 000 100 000 Terrified by that mass of games software that confronts you each time you walk into your local computer store? Worried that you might not have the right games in your collection? Well, you can stop getting all hot and bothered! C&VG is proud to present a comprehensive rundown of the best games around for the Atari range of home computers. CRAIG THACKRAY has been delving into the mass of software around and has come up with a few winners. WAR GAMES FLIP AND FLOP INVADERS POLE POSITION There are many followers of War Games who play on paper maps covered by hexagonal patterns with cardboard pieces. These games are easily converted to computers. As a result there are many War Games available, but they are more prolific on the Atari than any other machine. The three War Games I would recommend are Operation Whirlwind, Eastern Front and Legionnaire. The latter two are by Chris Crawford, a master of scrolling games and co-author of De Re Atari. All of these games scroll and have highly detailed maps. For disc owners, Operation Whirlwind is by far the most sophisticated and has the most elaborate title page I have seen. For those who prefer a little faster action, I suggest Legionnaire, supplied on cassette in 16k by Avalon Hill. The last on my short list is Eastern Front, originally sold on cassette by Atari Program Exchange and then bought by Atari on cartridge in a very professional package with instructions in the form of a war diary. SE3:52:52 BLUE MAX PINBALL AE by Broderbund is a 3D game which loads each detailed scene from disc after playing a selection of wonderful little ditties. A band of six alien invaders then dart in front and behind objects on the screen in a very acceptable manner. To continue through the game, you must kill three complete sets of aliens Bandits follows a much more standard screen format. The game itself is not totally enthralling, but it is an excellent game in terms of graphical presentation and the final touches incorporated are magnificent. When the game begins there is a small spaceship on a lunar surface ready to fly off from a launch pad into infinity. A small astronaut transport vehicle bounces its way off the screen and the spaceship launches, reeling the title page onto the screen. However something is wrong! There is an apple sign by the word Bandits. But fear not! A termite runs onto the screen and in a flurry of activity eats the apple to the core, leaving only an Atari sign behind. Throughout the game there are nice details like this -putting this game a cut above the rest. Bandits is a must for Atari owners with a liking for Galaxian style games. ADVENTURES One of the most realistic simulations that computers can create is Pinball. Several great software authors have risen from pinball simulations, Bill Budge being the best known. Bill's Raster Blaster pinball simulation is now regarded as one of the landmarks in software. True to the tradition of Raster Blaster, Pinball Construction Set is the most sophisticated piece of software available. Based on Smalltalk, a variation of a mainframe language, it is entirely graphics controlled and enables construction of any pinball table conceivable. It is an essential part of the Atari software collectors Adventuring is an area of games playing taken to religious lengths by some and covers the largest range of titles available for the Atari. Due to the orig. inal nature of many games, several unlikely games will crop up in this section. Pure adventure enthusiasts will know that there are two main adventure companies, Infocom and Adventure International. However, two British companies, Level 9 and Channel 8, are now producing very high quality adventures. 120 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"best ring, ron Atari lities ered out of esn't nis is ntact get Thch cept. the the rolls horribly on the British system. If you are not friends with your local optician then don't even consider it! The most enjoyable graphic Adventures I played were the On-Line Sierra series. Special interest should be directed to the Dark Crystal, my suggestion for the best graphical adventure. Synapse Software are to arcade Adventures what Heineken is to lager. Shamus II, Pharaohs Curse and Necromancer are their best releases in this line. I recommend all of these, my own soft spot being towards Necromancer. The animation on all of them is superb, the control over each is very well thought out and the graphics are beyond compare. For those who prefer to spend a more reasonable amount on a game, then Lone Raider, the latest release by Atari costing .00, is perfect. It is one of the few programs avail. able that plays music while loading and is a very professional three part action adventure, written by an English programmer, Justin Whitaker. ster hof ight detion I can see no difference between the Online Sierra disc version and that from Parker Brothers. Both are perfect copies of the arcade game and are immense fun. One other striking example is Preppie! by Adventure International. Although innovative at the time, it is now rather average and I find the movement sluggish. I confess to enjoying the tunes it plays as you are run over. Dig Dug is, in comparison, a new release in the arcades. To date I have found four versions of the game: O'Reily's Mine by Datasoft, Diamonds by English Software, Anteater and Dig Dug by Atari. Dig Dug from Atari, is my personal favourite, mainly because I find it relaxing. The documentation explains every aspect of the game to the full. O'Reily's Mine ... well, what can you say about it, nice title page, shame about the game. Diamonds by English Software digresses too much from the original for me and I find the graphics tacky and the game laborious. However for  it is reasonable. I'm afraid I just don't like Anteater. A game I did enjoy in the arcades was Q'Bert. There are now many versions of the game available and of these I have collected the best three. The most accurate version presently available is Pharaohs Pyramid. It is also part adventure and I found it a very satisfying game to play. Flip and Flop is brought to you by the people who brought you Astro-Chase. It is a wonderful piece of animated graphics, played on a scrolling 3D chess board on several levels. Juice is by the author of Kid Grid. It is very slick, but I found the playfield tediously small and the goals to be ARCADE Var COardsily sult ble, tari The best value text adventure available is Snowball by Level 9 at .90 which has over 7,000 locations. For those who enjoy defeat, a strong favourite is Empire of the Overmind by Avalon Hill, still a favourite amongst masochists and members of Mensa alike. If you believe in doing three impossible things before breakfast, then pop out and get one today. The best Adventures available are those in the Infocom range. They supply the most intricate Adventures available. Each of their latest releases covers two sides of a disc and is supplied with large amounts of extra documentation such as ID cards, postcards, games boards and numerous testimonials. All are supplied in intricate packaging and have the professional air of a best selling record album. Interaction is in a dialect as close to English as you are likely to see for some years. Full conversations with characters is encouraged and the world in which you play seems boundless. It is now possible to buy blueprints of buildings, maps of the underworld, tshirts, brass lanterns, clues in invisible ink, posters, almost everything an Adventurer could need The games they have released are the Zork trio, Deadline, Starcross, Witness, Suspended, Planetfall and Enchanter. If you own a disc drive, then buy the latest Infocom game whatever it might be. I guarantee you won't be seen again for months. Beginners or those with limited memory (all you 16k 400 owners) will find more joy with Channel 8. These are relatively easy by Infocom standards -but very enjoyable and reasonably cheap. For the Adventurer who wants to play classics, the Adventurer's guru Scott Adams, offers very humorous adventures through Adventure International. Two modern classics released by Adventure International are based on Frogger and Pacman. Preppie I and Preppie II written by Russ Wetmore, also set new standards in software quality and will be mentioned later. For those who prefer graphics in their life they can turn to the offerings of several companies. Technically, Sounds of Egypt is by far the best graphic adventure available the pictures are highly detailed and animated with scrolling clouds and bouncing camels. However, it is so incredibly difficult to converse with and impossible to complete that it is barely worth playing let alone buying. The Scott Adams series is now available in graphic format, called SAGA's. I'm sure they will soon become famous for their incredible flickering graphics. In order to achieve multitudinous colours, the programmer has timed the colours to flick every 60th of a second for the television system used in America. The desired effect however fails The official Frogger, by Sega, always looks good. However, there are now two official Froggers for the Atari, one from America and the other by our very own Parker Brothers. 583 TH Night m18 em 48MON 24 continued on page 122 NIGHT MISSION LOWDOWN ON THE SOFTWARE PRICE E PROGRAM NAME MANUFACTURED BY RAM K FORMAT XL COMPATIBLE Bandits  N 16/24 Raster Blaster Pinball Construction set Night Mission Davids Midnight Magic Operation Whirlwind Eastern Front Legionnaire Infocom Scott Adams Adventures S.A.G.A.'s 1 to 6 Snowball Empire of the Overminds Sands of Egypt Dark Crystal Shamus Case II Pharoahs Curse Necromancer Lone Raider Frogger Preppie!

"tarisof hit the spot. Both are by English Software for .95 a meagre price for such excellent games. Atari also have a version of Scramble, which is now well known. Caverns of Mars is a poorly made, roughly finished, overpriced game with little resemblance to the original, a difference which works negatively! I place a warning here. Caverns of Mars III has been released, called Phobos. It is a truly horrendous game avoid it like the plague. There are four particularly striking variations of Defender. Defender by Atari is the best copy of the arcade game, and I personally prefer it to another strong contender Repton. However, many of these who helped me to compile this article preferred Repton The final decision is based on personal opinion and whether or not you have a disc drive. Sky Blazer is rather loosely based on both Defender and Scramble. It involves undertaking several totally impossible missions. The graphics are boring and the scrolling is very jerky using none of the built-in scrolling facilities -I loathe this game. Choplifter also uses software scrolling, however it is very smooth and there are many reviews around. It is overall a very well produced game, available on both disc and cartridge. SARGON II OTHER BITS! PREPPIE! II CHPRC FR0000 continued from page 121 achieved too high Parker Brothers have bought the rights to Q*Bert and if they follow in their present tradition they will release a perfect arcade copy. Pacman is a huge area now. However, out of the silicon maze two playable versions stand out. For traditionalists, Jawbreaker is fast and the ghosts are very well created. However Preppie! II by Adventure International, from level four onwards, is a much more enthralling prospect with all the usual professional grace of a Russ Wetmore game. Other notables include Ghost Hunter, Pacman, Ms.Pacman, Tumble Bugs, Mouskattack and K-Razy Antiks a novel digression Scramble and Defender games have been popular since their conception in '81. Usually any game with a flying battle wagon on a scrolling landscape is thought of as one of the two that's how I think of them anyway. This is another area in which Synapse Software rules. Mike Potter is their leading programmer in this field and his mastery of horizontal and vertical scrolling is stunning. Titles to his credit are Protector (versions I and II), Shadow World and Nautilus. By far my favourite by Mike Potter is Nautilus, because of the excellent selection of colours, the slick scrolling and the deep bassy tune it plays on the title page. For this novel game to be really enjoyable, two players are needed. The computer is well above human skills and gets very depressing very quickly. Both Nautilus and Shadow World scroll different sections of the screen in different directions and each player can appear at two places on the screen. Shadow World is very close to Defender, the major difference being that the invading aliens descend in Battlestars and then pour out. The objective is to destroy the bases when their defences are down and before they land. This is an excellent one or two player game, although it takes some time to relate the rules to the game. It's one of these games which grow on you, but I can envisage it getting dull after a while. Protector II places you at the controls of a Needle Fighter as the heroic CAPTURE THE FLAG saviour of your home planet. It is a rather boring theme for a rather boring game — not as enjoyable as Protector I. Perhaps the best scramble type game available is Fort Apocalypse. It is 32k, but it utilises fine scrolling and very large sprites. The hardest Scramble game I have found is Sea Dragon by Adventure International. It is ridiculously difficult, but it is possible to skip levels by inserting a joystick into port 4 and pressing your fire button. Adventure International are reported as saying that it is made that difficult to give long lasting value for money and challenge. My personal belief is that Russ Wetmore is a sadistic and cruel programmer! Those who liked Preppie! and Preppie! II and want a Scramble game, then Sea Dragon will be for them. Purists will find Airstrike and Airstrike II very enjoyable. For me they just The remainder of this section covers various miscellaneous themes. Pogoman by Computer Magic is a smashing little program. You play the part of a public service employee who turns out the street lights during a black out from a pogostick. It does, however, boil down to bouncing over the various objects which scroll towards you. On later sheets you must jump over cats, ducks and a unicyclist whilst avoiding the killer parrot. Throughout the game a very relaxing tune plays continually preventing you becoming frustratedrather like a sedative. A novel approach to scramble was adopted by Zaxxon and the Synapse spin-off Blue Max. Zaxxon, like many of the arcade copies on disc and cassette, is licensed to Datasoft. It is a very close copy, especially the disc version, and although pretty, neither the disc or cassette versions feels like the arcade game. It was also evident that the pro. gram was not fully debugged, with what can only be described as glitches at the top and bottom of the screen. Blue Max turns you into a British Fighter Pilot flying over the front line to destroy three prime targets in a German city. The first few hits on your plane from ack-ack or enemy bi-planes knock out your manoeuvrability, machine guns, bombs or fuel tanks and finally you dive 122 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"Softfor ble, s of med, emce s of Phoing and I find a Kempston Competition Pro-Joystick perfect. At the top of each screen you are given a piece of code and eventually, after completing eight screens, you decode the message and send it off to Penguin Software. The program plays tunes continually and has options for keyboard, joystick and paddle play. I have played this game almost continually for a month and enjoy it immensely. Recently released was The Spy Strikes Back which is a graphical adventure as opposed to a version of Donkey Kong. Again it is an excellent game. Perhaps the most appreciated game in my collection by all my playtesters was Mountain King by CBS (previously K-Byte). After pressing start, the adventurous player dances to Grieg's in the Hall of the Mountain King from the Pier Gynt Suite, until start is pressed again. To continue the game, the player must collect 100 diamonds from a choice of thousands scattered liberally around ade to on. me Con. nal e a on wes The final task is to leave the mountain avoiding the kings minions while more bars of Pier Gynt are played, increasing in speed all the time. The game involves a great deal of scrolling and has splendid animation of all characters, especially the Arachnid who patrols the floor of the subterrainean kingdom. The tunes are complete utilising many of the octaves available on the Atari. This is another of those 'must-buy' games. Electronic Arts entrant is Hard Hat Mack. This game utilises the entire 48k available for the Atari, and is only three screens. It uses mode eight graphics, hoping to use artifacting. Unfortunately, in the UK it is black and white. If it were not for this problem, the graphics would be very detailed. It is packaged in a very well produced folder including interviews with the programmers. Last year, the Computer Game of the Year award didn't go to any of those arcade hits like Pacman or Defender as it had in previous years, but instead it went to Wayout, an incredible 3D maze game. Wayout's graphics are terrifyingly fast and smooth, with a choice of 26 unique and claustrophobic mazes, ranging from open, spacious mazes to tight and narrow intricate ones. There are gales blowing through many, which send you off course and eventually result in your failure. To hinder you further, the Pentangle appears (a vertically rotating rectangle) whose playful antics centre around annoying you by stealing your compass and map marking equipment. This equipment is used for displaying a top view of the expanding maze as you explore it. Wayout, not surprisingly, is a 48k disc based game, but for those of you with unexpanded machines, be frustrated no continued on page 124 and out of the sky, crashing into the ground. Every few miles you must land on an airstrip then take off. To progress through the game you must bomb primary targets marked by the computer. The game can continue for up to an hour, although you only have one life with such ratings as Kamikaze Trainee. From its stunning title music to its final, definite crash, this is a marvellous program which must go down on my shortlist very near the top. It is pointless to point out that the best copy of Donkey Kong for the Atari and probably any computer is the cartridge version of Donkey Kong by Atari. It is modelled on the American version of Donkey Kong and so may seem slightly different in its screen layout and the order in which screens appear. All this follows on the recent tradition by Atari for a move towards as close a copy of the arcade original as the computer's hardware will allow. A game soon to be released by Atari is Jungle Hunt already available for the VCS. This multi-stage game follows the exploits of an explorer attempting to find Jane and release her from the cannibals. The graphics routines are very complex, especially the co-ordination of player missiles with the screen memory. A review of this game will appear in this magazine at a later date. Donkey Kong Junior is also planned for release soon and, although I have not seen it yet, but it should be good. For those who already have Donkey Kong, this is the perfect sequel. However, I find the arcade version impossible. Rather like Michael Jackson's album Thriller, Miner 2049'er has been in the top ten sales for the Atari for months. This was a first attempt at a game for the Atari by Big Five, a leading software house for the TRS-80. This game has been reviewed by almost every magazine available, and highly acclaimed by all. Its huge sales have led to many spinoffs for other machines and Bounty Bob now returns in Miner II, called Scraper Caper. It should soon arrive in this country. If you don't already have the game, then buy it. For those who cannot afford such expense, then Leggit is an excellent game at only .50. It includes an animated title page multi-channel music and all the other features you would expect for an Atari game. The game rates as the best value game for the Atari. I hope that Ultimate Play the Game will follow Imagine's lead and release some of their excellent Spectrum games for the Atari at .50. Leggit is almost as demanding as Spies Demise (now available for the BBC as Corporate Climber through Dynabyte). This game is very simple. You must run your spy between ascending and descending lift-like objects, finding clues and, as each end of the screen is reached, you rise a level to the next ramp. The game is very demandP DONKEY KONG the screen before moving on to the next stage. When all these have been collected, the player must search for the magic EEN 2o ESO background tune increases in volume.

"tari soft continued from page 123 longer. From the makers of Wayout comes an equally incredible game called Capture the Flag on an 8k cartridge. It is effectively an action version of Wayout with music, enabling up to two people to play. The purpose of the invader is to get to the exit, avoiding a fatal encounter with the defender. The defender must destroy the invader by slamming into him. The graphics are as stunning as Wayout's, if a little slower. storing it in the bank. The game became boring very quickly and now I only play it to listen to the music. About the latest release from Synapse is Drelbs, a very silly game. The first phase of this two phase game is based on a board of rotating fences which must be moved to form squares. Preventing you is The Face, a stripped maggot and an evil monster which has the dastardly task of destroying your squares. The maggot moves around the edges of the screen, shooting into the central play area and unleashing bullets which rebound around the maze area of fences. Occasionally a girl's face will appear in one of the previously built squares. This is your cue to dash to your heartthrob to receive a slobbery kiss! Eventually when you have completed as many boxes as is possible, large numbers of Drelbs will appear in the boxes. You must then run into these squares to continue to phase two. Here all you need to do is to avoid The Face while collecting Drelbs and transporting them to safety in other words run over the creatures which look like you in a frantic dash. Overall this is a great game to play although progressing through the levels is slow. To date, Atari's most astonishing game is Pole Position, the well known 3D car racing game taken from the arcades. On the first track, you have to set a fast time to get a good position on the grid for the main race. The secret to the game is the fast realistic action, the thrill of screaming around corners at 160mph while avoiding the other cars on the track. If you are only going to buy one game, then this is the one you should get. I may be repeating myself here, but I promise this is the last time I will say it (he said nose growing with every utterance). Also from Atari is Tennis, very similar to the Activision version on the Atari VCS. I personally loathe the game, particularly as I am continually thwarted by the vindictive attitude of the computer opposition. I have won three points out of four full games. For those of you who like chess, Sargon II answers all your needs. As well as being able to play a good game of chess, you can also start the game from any position. This is useful for solving newspaper chess problems. There is a choice of levels from novice (which beats me every time) to expert.

LOWDOWN ON THE SOFTWARE RAMK PRICE MANUFACTURED BY FORMATS PROGRAMME RD 888 32 The remainder of the article is devoted to original games which do not come under any of my artistically oppressive classifications. Other than action adventure games, Synapse are well known for releasing totally original game concepts. Of the games they have released, the two most easily available are Picnic Paranoia and Claim Jumper Picnic Paranoia is the most novel of the two and plays a very good rendition of 'Flight of the Bumble Bee' from the Carnival of the Animals. Soon you'll be able to spot a computer user by whether or not he whistles Beethoven when he's happy. The title page introduces each character by name as they walk, fly, crawl or slide onto the screen, whilst George uses code to spell the name of the game, fly swatter in hand. In the game, you protect your food from the ants who crawl on to steal your booty. You have to protect the food on the tables with the aid of a fly swatter and occasionally a can of insect killer which acts rather like a bomb. To aid the ants, however, is their secret weapon, the deadly wasp which, I might add, splats with wonderful finality. Overall the game is rather lengthy and not fast enough. Claim Jumper only works as a two player game and only then if both players are evenly matched and violent. Basically it is a variation on Boot Hill, varying only in that it involves collecting gold, converting it into cash and then 16 16 22.95 Sky Blazer Brderbund 16/48 27.95/23.75 Choplifter Brderbund 28.95 Pogoman Computer Magic Ltd. 16/48 29.75 Zaxxon Datasoft 22.95 Blue Max Synapse Software 28.95 Donkey Kong Atari 29.75 Miner 2049er Big Five Software 29.95 Scraper Caper Big Five Software 5.45 Leggit Imagine 14.95 Spies Demise Penguin Software 14.95 The Spy Strikes Back Penguin Software 28.45 Mountain King CBS 29.95 Hard Hat Mack Electronic Arts 25.95 Wayout Sirius USA Capture the Flag Sirius 29.75 Claim Jumper Synapse Software R 29.75 Picnic Paranoia Synapse Software 22.45 Drelbs Synapse Software 28.95 Pole Position Atari 28.95 Tennis Atari USA Strip Poker Artwork USA 16 Hayden Publishing Ltd.

What? You want me to go to Las Vegas, USA to report on a computer fair! That's right folks the Editor finally flipped and sent yours truly on an all expenses paid trip to the Consumer Electronics Show in America. Well. I couldn't pass that up could I? So very shortly afterwards, my bags all packed. I set off for the U.S. of A. and the dream town that is Las Vegas. Here's what I found there ... A CADEACTION ACADEACTION he CES is the largest electron.cs trade fair in the world -about five PCW shows rolled into one! It's not just all computers either -the CES features everything from fridges to car stereos. Although the CES is a good opportunity for reporters to find out what's new for the coming year, the main business is about selling. Every hotel, motel and guest house in the city is booked weeks before the show by buyers from all over the world. It is make or break week for the manufacturers -a poor performance at the CES may well mean that a new product is shelved and never find its way into the shops. But C&VG was there to look at new developments in the games world. So what's new for the games fan? This CES was the turn of the American software houses to steal the show. For the last three years it has been dedicated video-game specialists like Atari, Activision, and Imagic who have stolen the limelight with their awardwinning video-games and whizz-kid programmers. But no longer. The new glamour names in American electronic games are software companies like Synapse, Broderbund. Data soft, and Electronic Arts. Now let's take a look at some new titles from these rising software stars. It had to happen -JR has finally bought his way into the computer games business. The Dallas baddie will soon be topping the bill in his own computer game. If you've always thought you could outwit TV's most devious double dealer, then this is your chance to try as the action takes you inside the Southfork ranch and into the jungles of South America in pursuit of the black stuff.

"metals and clocking up points on your computer. Epyx, of Temple of Asphai fame en tered the show with a fistful of new titles. A strong sports theme was evident in titles like Summer Games and The World's Greatest Baseball Game. Any new Epyx title is watched closely in the States especially since the charttopping success of the company's games — Jumpman and Pitstop last year. No software house set the pace in 1983 more than Synapse with smash hits like Zaxxon. Fort Apocalypse, and Blue Max. Once the legal wranale stopping the import of Synapse games has been resolved, lucky Atari and Commodore 64 owners can look forward to Dimension X, which boasts 3D-style graphics even more impressive thar. Zaxxon Two other forthcoming goodies are a totally new personal fitness program called Relax, no it has got nothing to do with the record and what Synapse describe as \"a step beyond the Advanture games of the past to the new range of Synapse electronic novels\". Can't wait! The most interesting of the newcomers to the CES were Electronic Arts a company with a whole lot of hype but some good new games as well. Pinball Construction Set already reviewed in C&VG, March enables you to design your own pin table by dragging the various play mechanisms around the screen with the joystick. Acheron is a strategy war game based on Chess, and Hard Hat Mack is an arcade-style climbing game. Electronic Arts games are for the Atari computers and the Commodore 64, on disc only and come distinctively packaged in record-like sleeves. Most of the software houses in the U.S. are now concentrating on the Commodore 64, Atari computers, the IBM PC, and Apple as these machines represent the largest market. The Sinclair scene is very flat in the U.S. with just one piece of British software -Melbourne House's Penetrator — attracting the occasional player on the Timex Sinclair stand. Quicksilva were the only British software house to have their own stand at the CES which served as a sort of clubhouse for British journalists and buyers visiting the show. The only really good news for Spectrum owners to emerge from the show is Sega's decision to license Thorn EMI to produce their titles under licence in the UK. UK. The wealth of hit arcade games in the Sega range promises a real treat for Spectrum owners with titles like Zaxxon, Turbo, Buck Rogers, Congo Bongo and many more. Sega titles for the Spectrum will be matched in the summer by \"name games\" from Parker Brothers and Atarisoft which all adds up to tough competition for our own home grown Spectrum software. Another software show-stopper was Broderbund's Lode Runner — a game which has topped the charts in the U.S. for the last six weeks. HesWare's stand attracted the autograph hunters as Minnesota Fats -the famous American pool player -was demonstrating his Pool Challenge game and taking on all comers. Another personality attracting attention was Mr Adventure himself, Scott Adams — drawing the crowds to the Adventure International stand. Dozens of Penthouse Pets also attracted a lot of attention at the showhanding out signed photographs of themselves. What's this got to do with computer games, I hear you ask? Not a lot really! But if Nadine should ever read this... Something else which didn't have much to do with computers caused more than a flicker of interest — robots. Robot is the current buzz-word in consumer electronics. Try saying robot to a computer journalist, publisher, buyer, or self-appointed 20th Century H. G. Wells and watch his eyes light up and mouth start salivating as he prepares to relate his now well rehearsed theory about how these mechanical beings will be answering the door, doing the washing up and telling jokes in every household in the country before the turn of the century. The ones which you will probably be aware of already are Topo and Fred from the American company Androbot. Both these robots recently went on sale in the UK. Topo is the deluxe model who can walk and talk but, if you want him to do anything else, you'll have to wait for the add-ons. Fred is a toy. Fun but not as much fun as say-Scalextric, Action Man or a BMX bike!

"SHUTTLE-BBC Let's start with another bug that I've just noticed crawling from deep within the pages of February's book of games. Shuttle for the BBC, on page 45, lost a character at the end of line 540. Time, for future reference, is equal to zero. (... TIME=0) (well, typewriter ribbon actually) of Damien Rew from Balcombe, West Sussex. Damien ends his letter by asking why there isn't a top 10 score section for the BBC. Well, Damien, I think you've just answered that one yourself. YEARBOOK REVISITED Returning for one brief moment to the Yearbook, line 16910 of Vespozian Affair for the Atari should end in J=1. coloured, flashing square on the screen and further play is then impossible. Well, Ross, I've spoken to Imagine and was told that there was a fault in one of the machines used to produce the first batches of Stonkers. They managed to track down most of the faulty copies but there could still be a few left. The game has been tested heavily, they assured me, but because it's so complex there may still be some bugs lurking deep within the code. If you find one, please let me know. Imagine was quick to point out that all of their games carry a lifetime guarantee. Quite what that actually means I can't be sure, but if you have a problem with your copy of Stonkers and you're still alive then send it back to Imagine in Liverpool and they'll rush a fresh copy as fast as the local postman can walk. ATARI 600/1200 Atari listings have been causing a few problems with the introduction of the new 600 and 1200XL models. I've been getting calls recently from readers asking whether programs written for the 400 or 800 will run on the newer models. I've actually spoken to Atari myself and was told that there should be no problem, on condition that only normal programming practices are used. Although a new operating system is used in the 600, all pointers remain the same. This means that POKES to the character set or to the Player Missile Graphics are the same. However, some clever programmers use their own routines to bypass the way the Atari's operating system sets up functions. In these cases, where jumps are made straight into the Atari's ROM, there may be some problems. Meanwhile, if you've ever wondered what Australian programmers have to put up with, type POKE 755, 204 on your Atari to find out. PLAY IT AGAIN Someone called R. Timothy from Rumney, Cardiff, writes in with some useful addresses for restarting some of the Acornsoft games on a BBC B after you've pressed BREAK If you've interrupted your game of Rocket Raid, then there's no need to re-load it -just type CALL 678, press return and then press space. The same goes for New Snapper, but change the 678 to 657. To restart Killer Gorilla, CALL 6135, press return then press escape. VIC SCREENS Roger Walkden from Park Road, Beckenham in Kent writes in with a useful Vic-20 tip. If you POKE 36896, 1 the entire screen will move to the left. Change the 1 to an 11 to return to the centre, or change it to 22 for the right hand side. Anything larger than 22 will make the screen start to disappear off the edge ... and by 61 it's all gone. LUNAR JETMAN Dunler I've also had a few letters about Lunar Jetman from Ultimate. Approaching the alien base in your buggy sometimes causes the program to crash. Ultimate says that there may be a faulty batch of tapes -if you think you have one of them, they'll replace it for you if you return it. No doubt they'll refund your postage as well. addresses for restarting some otsene Winite to me at Bug Hunter, WRITE THROUGH MICRONET Durroir London, ECIR 5EJ. Or phone Me on 01:278.3881. OWARRK —.64 Planet Qwarrk for the Commodore 64 from February's issue suffered from some unclear printing at the end of line 440. The colon ( before the final \"F\" should, in fact, be a semi colon (:). SPLATTING BUGS Here's some news of a possible bug in best-selling Splat for the Spectrum for Incentive Software. Whenever you score 50,000 or more, says Gregor Rankin from Belfast, the machine crashes just after generating the hicode. If you've had this problem with your copy of the game, then let me know. It may be a faulty batch of tapes, or there could actually be a bug in the program. There are now three ways you can get in touch with the Bug Hunter. As well as phone (01-278 3881) and letter, we've now joined Micronet 800. If you're a member of the Micronet database then you can write to the Bug Hunter via Prestel Mailbox. My account number is 012786556. I'll try to reply to every message within a day or so, but there will probably be certain times during the month when it will take a little longer. After all, I have to write this page you know. DIY REPLIES Here's a way of cheating on Superior Software's Q Bert for the BBC B. When the computer asks you for a skill level, press BREAK and ESCAPE together. Then type this line... 4017 VDU ?PCHAR1%:SOUND 1.1,55(FY%-1%). 1:NEXT: IF MEN%= 1000 THEN 5000 ELSE 3015. Then type RUN, and you now have over a thousand lives. This naughtiness comes from the pen IMAGINARY BUGS Ross Scott writes from Burghfield Com. mon near Reading about Imagine's latest pride and joy, Stonkers. I have yet, he says, to complete a game owing to the program's crashing. It leaves a MORE VIC BITS Finally for this month, here's a few SYS numbers for Vic owners, courtesy of John Jones of Eastham, Wirral. SYS 234 is the same as pressing RUN STOP, RESTORE. SYS 64802 simulates switching the machine off, and instead of using \"PRINT\" with a CTRL key to change colour, use POKE 646,0 for black, 1 for white, 2 for red and so on.

"TO GAPLATOS By Garry Marshall MAKING THE MOST OF Y OUR 64 PART 2 sprite colour X position Y position    location pointing to description 2040 2041 2042 2043 2044 2045 2046 2047 53287 53288 53289 53290 53291 53292 53293 53294 53248 53250 53252 53254 53256 53258 53260 53262 53249 53251 53253 53255 53257 53259 53261 53263     puter multiplies the contents of location 2040 by 64 to get the address. So if we are to put the description of a sprite at the beginning of the cassette buffer, we must store 13 in location 2040 (with POKE 2040, 13), since 64* 13 = 832 is the multiple of 64 that gives the address that is nearest to the beginning of this buffer. The X-positions and the Y-positions that are stored in the locations given in the table give the xand y-coordinates of the top left corners of the sprites. In addition to these registers, location 53269 controls whether the sprites are on or off. Placing a l in bit 0 of this location turns sprite 0 on, while a 0 in bit Oturns sprite 0 off. The other bits in this location control the other sprites in the same way. When sprites meet each other, their priority, that is to say the way that it is determined which sprite remains visible, is determined by their numbers. Sprite 0 has the top priority, sprite 1 is next, and so on. You will find a program for displaying and moving sprites below. It displays three sprites and, when a key is pressed, it sends them off for a short journey. You can produce sprite graphics on the Commodore 64, and they can be very impressive. They are large so they can be highly detailed, they can be magnified both horizontally and vertically and they can be multi-coloured. Unfortunately, though, the Basic on the Commodore 64 provides no support at all for sprite graphics, and programs to generate sprites must consist of masses of PEEKs and POKEs to access the various registers in the Vic graphics chip that produces and controls the sprite graphics. A sprite is 24 dots wide and 21 dots high. It is represented in the usual way by using a 1 for a dot that is \"on\" (foreground colour) and a 0 for a dot that is \"off\" (background colour). Thus, it takes 63 bytes to store a description of a sprite, although the Commodore 64 allocates blocks of 64 bytes for them and then makes no use of the last byte. Up to eight sprites can be maintained at the same time. The illustration shows a design for a sprite, and its description is included in the DATA statements of the accompanying program. This program maintains three sprites, all of which have the same shape, but different colours. The first problem that we have to face is where to store the sprite descriptions. We shall put ours in the cassette buffer, which extends from location 828 to 1023. If you do the necessary arithmetic, you will see that there is only room for three sprite descriptions here, but this is not a problem since several sprites can share the same description However, if you want to write a program that uses more than three differently shaped sprites, you must delve further into the mysteries of the Commodore 64 to find out how to make yourself a sufficiently large amount of storage that will not be affected by anything else than the computer may do. Now we come to the part where we have to start remembering the large numbers which are the addresses of the Vic registers that control the various properties of the sprites. The addresses in the following table are vital, controlling the colour and position of each sprite, and showing where the description of the sprites are stored. The sprites are numbered from 0 to 7 To find where the description of sprite 0, for example, begins, the com5 PRINT \" 10 FOR K=O TO 62 20 READ B. 30 POKE 832+K, B 40 NEXT K 50 DATAO.16.0.0.56.8.0.40,0,0.56,0,0,56,0,0.124,0,0, 84,0,0,124,0,0,254,0,1,255,0 60 DATA 3,255, 128,7,255,192,15,255,224,31,255,240, 63,255, 248, 127, 255, 252, 255,255 70 DATA 254, 255, 255, 254, 248,56,62,0.56,0,0,16,0 80 POKE 2040,13: POKE 2041,13: POKE 2042,13 90 POKE 53269,7 100 POKE 53287.2: POKE 53288, 3: POKE 53289,7 110 POKE 53248.52: POKE 53249.50 120 POKE 5325e, 100: POKE 53251, 100 130 POKE 53252, 150:POKE 53253, 150 149 GET C$: IF C$=\"# THEN 150 FOR K=51 TO 200 140 160 POKE 53248,K 170 POKE 53251,K+50 180 POKE 53252,J: POKE 53253.J 185 J=k+100: IF J)255 THENJEK 190 NEXTK 200 GOTO 140 Ti COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 137 "

With a little knowledge of machine code, it's easy to produce your own title pages. 'I LOVE C&VG perhaps? F for any reason you want your Spectrum checked to see if an upper case letter has to be entered in your program, here's the answer. Just replace INKEY$ with LETAS=CHR$PEEK 23556 and then check the letter with IFA$=\"S\" THEN GOTO 100. Mr Edwards of Wrexham has also sent Program Extra a tip that lets the computer wait up to three minutes for a key to be pressed: LET T=7997USR7997. The variable T is length of time in fiftieths of a second. This is particularly useful for pages of instructions where the user can move onto the next screen once he's finished reading. ESIGNED characters for computers have always been tedious and difficult to use. You could spend hours keying in numbers before you found just the right shape and colour. Mr E Horner has produced a program that goes part of the way to solving this problem. This short listing for the Texas not only lets you design the shape of the character with ease, but also colour it with any of the colours from 2-16. 10 CALL CLEAR 20 CALL SCREEN(12) 30 INPUT \"CHAR CODE\":A$ 40 INPUT \"COLOUR:\":COLOR 50 CALL CHAR(105, A$) 60 CALL COLOR(10, COLOR,12) 70 CALL HCHAR(15.15,105,1) 80 PRINT \"PRESS Y TO CONTINUE\". 90 CALL KEYO,K,S) 100 IF K=89 THEN 10 ELSE 90 110 END. HE Quantum Leap the new Sinclair personal computer looks set to repeat the performance of the Spectrum and ZX81, Sinclair have begun a new approach to home micros. The QL signals the end of the race to produce the cheapest colour computer and a move toward producing more professional computers. It's not that many years since the most a home micro could offer was lk of memory and very primitive graphics. 128k, two micro drives, RS232 interface and hi-res graphics all for  three years ago was an impossibility today it's a reality. The QL uses a Motorola 68808 a 16 bit central processing chip. Most home micros, like the BBC and Commodore 64, only use eight bit chips. This new CPU is much faster and can handle a much greater amount of memory the QL is expandable up to an incredible half a megabyte of RAM. Another feature that was only found on much more expensive computers is 'multi tasking the ability to run more than one program at one time. The QL can, in fact, run a total of 20 simultaneously. So PROGRAM EXTRA HE Atari 600XL is claimed to be able to run all the software written for the older 400 and 800 models — that is as long as it's written by Atari themselves. The new machine has had the ROM slightly rewritten but this won't cause any problems if the proper machine code entry and exit points are used. Unfortunately, many of the games written by independent software houses for the Atari don't use these standard routines So remember to check the games before you buy. "

"HY ARE micros useful for music? And why would you want to turn your micro to musical ends when you could quite happily use up all your micro time playing games? The reason lies in the nature of music itself a true art which demands great creativity and yet depends largely on a few simple numerical relationships. Mastering both these aspects of the musical process can be infinitely rewarding. In the past couple of years computers have made great inroads into commercial music, to the extent that maybe half of the Top Ten records at any given time will use a computerised composition, sound production or recording device. So don't feel that the home micro enthusiast has nothing to offer the world of commercial music — experience gained on small machines can stand you in good stead in many of the most advanced studios in the world. The example of scores of stars such as The Human League, Tears For Fears and Depeche Mode attest to the influence of computerised music. There are three main ways in which standard home micros as opposed to dedicated music systems such as the Fairlight Computer Musical Instrument can perform a musical task. These are using built-in sound functions to play tunes, controlling additional hardware in the form of effects generators or \"voice\" cards to produce complex sounds, and controlling existing musical instruments usually synthesizers for complex composition. We'll look at each of these three methods in turn, and conclude with a look at the typical computer-equipped recording studio as it may look in three or four years time. MAKING MUSIC pop goes HE MIRO It's very simple to get some sort of musical effect out of most micros all the programmers' handbooks will have a short listing to get a scale, an arpeggio or even a short tune. One obvious exception is the ZX81, which has no sound facilities, and the Spectrum is little better, although we reckon our music program makes the most of this machine. It can produce a single beep at various pitches and with various lengths, but that's about it, particularly as the machine uses a very basic piezo instead of a speaker. Lots of cheap amplifiers are available from Fuller, Kelwood, and others, however, and one of these is really vital if you want to make serious music on your micro. Owners of the Vic-20, Acorn and Dragon are better off, with both white noise and one or more oscillators available. A few musical software packages for such machines are now out, but these are usually games or educational programmes rather than \"compose your own symphony\" types. Many top pop groups use computer technology to help make their records top ten hits — and not just in the recording studio. Nowadays many instruments can be linked with computers, allowing groups to reproduce studio sounds when they perform live. Musicians like Vince Clarke pictured the man who will be casting a critical eye over your musical efforts in our Micro Music contest who uses a super-computer called the Fairlight CMI to help him compose hit tunes. We asked computer music expert Mark Jenkins to bring us the low-down on hi-tech in the world of pop. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 165 "


"WHO ARE the LORDS MIDNIGHT The first SPECTRUM Game to feature LANDSCAPINA 166 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"One for the Commodore 64 is Softcomm's Dancing Feats which uses a joystick as a musical instrument and can help you compose and replay quite complex accompanied pieces, but then the sound facilities of the 64 make this practical — there are three channels plus white noise, ring-modulator for complex tones, and filtering. Similar facilities exist on the BBC B, Oric, Sord MS and Lynx, so in practice quite complex sound effects or musical patterns are possible. These could consist of tunes in three-part harmony, perhaps accompanied by white noise effects for percussion backing not exactly New Order, but better than nothing! There are some composition packages available, such as Atari's Music Composer which will run on their 400, 800, 600 and 800XL models. It's a cartridge-based program which gives you a menu of alternative functions Edit Music, Arrange Music, Save, Retrieve and so on. Some of the musical instrument manufacturers are going into micros in a big way with similar programmes, and Roland's Compu-Music hardware and software can match such compositions with drum machine-type sounds and musical notation of your compositions. This would involve a pretty substantial investment, but represents one logical step after your compositional imagination becomes limited by your micro. Compu-Music won't do much for the nature of computerised sounds though and, as we'll see, there's another way around that particular problem. expense, because unfortunately the more complex \"voice\" cards tend to be manufactured for up-market computers such as the Apple. One of the great advantages of the Apple is the \"slot\" system, used to add on new facilities, and into these slots can be fitted voice cards such as the Mountain Hardware or Soundchaser systems. In a system such as Alpha Syntauri, these voices can be put to a vast range of fully professional uses. Sounds can be laboriously defined, swept with harmonic filters, split across a five-octave keyboard, merged and stored on disc. Real sounds can be sampled by the computer and replayed, and very lengthy compositions with many tracks can be composed on the computer. Games, educational software and composer's aids are all available, and many of the country's top musicians and universities are using the system for a wide variety of music-related activities. And at the end of the day you can still work out your finances on it! MICRO CONTROL ter interface, and so it's much more friendly to micros. The cheapest synthesizer currently fitted with MIDI is Korg's Poly 800 at around , and the system is becoming a much-needed standard. The synthesizer manufacturers are marketing interfaces which allow your micro to \"speak\" MIDI, and as it's a universal system there are theoretically no restrictions on which MIDI-fitted synthesizers can be used. Sequential Circuits market a MIDI interface which allows the Commodore 64 to act as a versatile 2000-note sequencer, composing device and music notator, and the unit will eventually work with the Spectrum and Atari as well. An independent company, Upstream, are marketing a Spectrum MIDI interface for a similar price — around  — and there are more to come. The point about MIDI is that it can be designed into any digitally-controlled musical instrument, and so in the immediate future we'll see MIDI drum machines, pianos and even guitars. Anything fitted with MIDI can be controlled with your micro, so the realisation of a totally computerised studio is very close indeed. Looking forward a little, we can see that it will be very easy to use a micro to control musical instruments within a few months you'll be able to plug your Spectrum, Commodore, Atari and so on into a professional synthesizer via a relatively inexpensive interface. Some instruments are already being designed with the ready-to-use memory capacities of home micros in mind, for instance MPC Electronics' Music Percussion Computer, a versatile drum machine which uses a ZX81 or Spectrum as a memory bank Sequential Circuits have a new system, Six-Trax, which uses a Commodore 64 to compose tunes, store rhythm patterns and move from one pattern to the next. A Commodore 64, or certainly an Apple, could sit at the centre of a bank of synthesizers and drum machines, playing compositions on them, helping the composer to come up with new songs and all the time displaying exact. ly what is playing and what options are available. Remember that micros can accept all sorts of inputs, from heat sensors, motion detectors, video cameras and so on, so it would be possible to compose using all of these unusual signals. All these musical advantages derive from the familiar number-crunching capacities of the home micro, which leads us to wonder what Bach, with his lengthy but mathematically balanced compositions, would have made of the Lynx or BBC matched with a couple of disc drives and maybe a little Moog Synthesizer. The other way to look at it is that, in a few years time, the modern equivalent of Bach may be working with just such a system. SOUND ADVICE Finally, we come to micro control of existing musical instruments. These would usually be synthesizers of one kind or another as previously mentioned, but recent developments have made this generalisation less accurate, as we shall see. Firstly, a brief description of the conventional synthesizer, which was developed by Dr. Robert Moog (as in rogue rather than mood which is what you get for having Hungarian ancestors) in the Sixties. All the parameters of Moog's synthesizer were controlled by varying voltages, and so a pattern of voltages produced by a keyboard or an automatic device (sequencer) when applied to an oscillator would play a tune. For that matter the tone (filter setting) and other parameters could be voltage controlled. Micros excel at storing information such as musical notes as we've seen, but to gain direct access to a synthesizer is difficult as micros produce digital information rather than voltages. What's needed is a Digital to Analogue Converter (D/A) and although these are common parts of sequencer and other designs, they aren't exactly common in the form of a simple box. A design for the Spectrum has been published in the specialist magazine Electronics & Music Maker and a ZX81 design in Electronic Soundmaker magazine, both acting as sequencers which will store long strings of notes and plug into the Voltage Control input of a cheap single-note synthesizer such as Roland's SH09. Help is at hand, however, with the MIDI, or Musical Instrument Digital Interface. As its name implies, this system speaks a digital language and operates in serial form as does the RS232 compuThe built-in sound facilities on most micros are very limited, for simple financial reasons the number of users wanting complex musical functions would not justify the expense of the circuitry involved. The next step, then, is to add a little more hardware, and the simplest units give a wide selection of sound and musical efforts which are ideal for writing into computer games. The Petron Trichord, for instance, is a little black box for the ZX81 and Spectrum which has three sound channels and a white noise generator for explosions, waves and random sounds. It has a musical range of more than eight octaves and can produce some very rewarding three-part harmony music, with over 6,000 chords for a 48k memory in other words, a pretty lengthy composition. It's really very easy to define musical notes, and no real knowledge of music theory is needed. The problem with the Trichord and similar inexpensive units is that the quality of the sound is very basic a simple sine wave in a lot of cases. You won't be able to sound like Vince Clarke without going to a little more COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 167 "

"IIIIIIIIIIII The best part of some games is the excellent sound effects which are often built in. The crash of an ill-fated driver in Road Race, the cheering crowds in international soccer, the extra terrestrial murmurs emanating from distant planets in far-off solar systems. As well as purely abstract sound effects, computers can generate music. This means producing real notes in sequence to make a tune. Many programmers actually incorporate music in their games, either to supplement or to replace the normal sound effects. If you've ever played China Miner on the Commodore 64, for example, you'll have recognised Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag accompanying your game. Spectrum fans will have heard \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" from Greig's Peer Gynt suite while burning the midnight oil in a last desperate attempt to escape the Mutant Toilets and the Bouncing Cheques in Manic Miner. And so there came a time when software houses realised that the music in some games was so good, it would be worthwhile creating programs which did nothing but enable the user to play or hear music on his or her micro. A BBC tape landed on my desk recently which played Bach's Toccata & Fugue in D Minor in beautiful harmony for 11 glorious minutes. Many software companies now produce packages to let you make your micro play music. The official Sinclair offering was launched recently for the Spectrum which allows the rubber keyboard to act like a musical instrument (no you don't hit it, you play it). Commodore has a music composer cartridge for the 64 which has some quite advanced features. It's rumoured that they also have a sequencer cartridge on the way. For the non-musical amongst us, a sequencer allows you to programme a set of notes into the machine which will be repeated over and over again. You can use this as backing, and then play the actual tune over the top, making it easy to produce reasonablesounding music with the minimum of effort -just like Duran Duran, really. BBC owners who'd rather make their own sweet music than have another programmer do it for them can buy Music Processor from Quicksilva, or the not-as-good Music program from BBC Soft. Quicksilva also has a Commodore 64 program named, in true Newspeak fashion, Ultisynth You'll find reviews of commercial programs elsewhere in this magazine, but if you don't want to spend your hard-earned money on them then you could always use the ones which we've printed. The music listings All work (honestly, I've tested them). However, they're obviously not as good as something costing 10 times the price of your copy of C&VG. They will, though, allow you to play tunes on your micro. The listings as printed are quite simple and don't have an enormous number of special features, but you can add to them if you wish. Perhaps you'll want to give a greater range of notes, or special effects. If special effects are your interest then you'll need to know something about what's called the envelope of the note. There's a direct command for defining envelopes on the BBC. They take a little time to get to grips with, as does the envelope command on the Beeb with its 14 parameters! Think of a single note played on, say, a piano. As soon as you hit the note it rises straight to its maximum volume. Compare this to someone blowing a trombone. Unless the person blowing it has lungs like an air compressor, then the note will rise much less sharply — taking time to reach maximum volume. This feature of a note how long it takes to reach peak volume is called the Attack Got that? Good. Now imagine keeping your finger on the piano keyboard after you've played the note. The sound continues but loses some of its original volume. This is known as the rate of decay, which has nothing to do with nuclear reactors. The amount of time that the note stays at this reduced level is known as the sustain time. After a while, though, it will decay to nothing. The speed at which it does this is known as the decay rate. So a note is made up from four definable values, namely attack, decay, sustain and release. If you've got one of those small Casio VL-tone instruments, you'll now understand what the ADSR setting means! Developments in technology are helping to widen the part which computers are beginning to play in music. Many bands now perform exclusively on electronic instruments which can generate the sounds they require. Although a large amount of skill is still required to produce something respectable from one of these machines, the job of the modern musician is gradually changing to that of a computer programmer. One of the most popular (and expensive) synths around is called the Fairlight and no big-time, super-rich band should be without one. For your ,000 you get a computer complete with keyboard (both sorts) and even two 8-inch floppy disk drives to store the tune on. Imagine wearing that on a strap round your neck. Programming such a beast is no mean feat, but you can get some of the most amazing effects. It also has the facility to do what's called Sound Sampling. Normally, when you use a synthesizer, you start off with a bank of a couple of dozen pre-programmed sounds which you can then alter out of all recognition (the clichés are really flying today) by pressing a few buttons and twiddling the odd knob or two. Sound sampling means that you can start off with any sound you like as a base for your knob-twiddling. Just connect a microphone to the machine and play the sound into its memory. You can then do what you like with the sound, or play it in any key on the keyboard. You've probably heard that awful record by someone going under the name Wonderdog, called Ruff Mix. It featured a dog barking a tune (and we all know where he lived, and what his favourite composer was, don't we?). Now I hate to disappoint you, but the hero of this record (you might call it a hot dog) was a computer. All the musician did was to play a dog into his computer and then he could play the keyboard and it would sound like a woof-woof. Following on from the success of such idiotic material came a flock of sheep singing Baa Baa Black Sheep. Needless to say, it didn't make Top of the Paps (or TOTP as they call it in Smash Hits) So that's about it, really. As you've realised, computers and music have a lot in common. And it's a link which is growing all the time. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 169 rate. "
