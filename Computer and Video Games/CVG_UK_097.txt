"EWS 11111111 The consoles war is hotting up! Looking like something out of a science fiction movie, the PC Engine Super Grafx is released in Japan at the end of this month. Just how good is this latest super console? Julian Rignall has the story... SUPER INSIDE THE BEAST The PC Engine Super Grafx is a stunning-looking machine which resembles a piece of high-tech military gadgetry. And beneath its rugged exterior beats a mighty heart. The machine uses a similar processor to the normal Engine, but has the addition of special video and blitterstyle chips to shift sprite data around very quickly, allowing up to 128 sprites to appear on-screen simultaneously, compared with the Engine's 64 The sound chip is the same as the Engine, but since Super Grafx cartridges feature more memory than their PC Engine counterparts, there will be much more room for sampled sounds and speech PCENGINE SG A The new console in all it's glory. tures a full steering yoke, rather like the controls on the Star Wars arcade games, complete with top-mounted fire buttons, a gear stick/throttle, an LCD clock/timer, an LED radar-type display, a numeric keypad, and a plethora of buttons and knobs! The Engine SG slips neatly inside it, and once installed, you've got a control system that a 747 pilot would be jealous of! The Power Console how's THAT for a joystick? A Airborne blasting thrills! THE GAMES First and foremost, the PC Engine SG is compatible with all existing PC Engine titles, a feature that has become increasingly important in the design of new consoles, as it gives the user an instant games library while newer titles are developed. There are details of only three SG games at the moment, a conversion of Capcom's Ghouls 'n' Ghosts (which looks as good as, if not better than the Megadrive version), an amazing Rastan-style arcade adventure, and a stunning 3D flying game that looks similar to Lock-On. The latter two have untranslatable Japanese names. Reports state that there are another seven games currently being developed. THE WHOPPER ADD-ON An incredible piece of hardware that is being released simultaneously with the Engine SG is the Power Console, a control unit which makes the Konix Multisystem look very ill indeed. It fea"


"NEWS WIN POLIER ) A SuperGrafx Ghoul's 'n' Ghosts WHAT ABOUT THE ENGINE? The immediate thought is that PC Engine software will dry up when the SG is released. Rubbish! With over 1.9 million Engine users in Japan alone, the American version of the Engine, the TurboGrafx just released, and a European version on the way (rumours currently state that it'll be available by autumn 1990), there's going to loads of new Engine games. What's more than likely to happen is that games will appear on both systems, with the SG game being a very enhanced version of the normal PC Engine title. IN CONCLUSION A Grab the yoke and whiz through the ether. The Engine SG is a brilliant new machine, especially when you take into account the amazing Power Console. PC Engine titles already hold their own when compared with games on other systems with its extra chips, SG games should be simply stunning! WHEN AND WHERE The PC Engine is yet to be officially released in Britain, so the PC Engine SG is a long way off appearing. The release date in Japan is later on this month and it'll retail at just under  if things go the same way as they did with the Engine, you'll probably be able to buy modified imported versions QSIQ Hl. early in the new year for around ...

The British team notched up record scores on Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Ocean's Amiga version of New Zealand Story and Sega's poopy old Captain Silver The lads did creditably on the Amstrad conversion of Forgotten Worlds too, and were only stymied by the ST version of Loriciel's Turbo Cup, which only Julian had played before (a year ago!). THE RESULTS But luck and a following wind were on our side. With sterling performances all round, the team took first place, followed by the French (sponsored by Tilt magazine) and then the Spanish team (sponsored by Micromania magazine). Our boys won 3000 francs (about 300) each, and Julian would have taken the prize for \"Best Player of the Tournament\" (about 500) had he been .02 of a second faster in Turbo Cup. Tchaah! Still, that leaves him something to set his sights on for next year's competition, which will be held at the ECES Show (formerly the PC Show) next Autumn!

The graphics are almost identical to the coin-op, and the gameplay is very faithful. The twoplayer mode works very well, adding more fun to the proceedings, and the game is challenging and addictive.

"EVIEW C64 A snowplough would make this stage easier. TIIIIIIIII I S Gold released their conversion of Sega's hydraulic arcade driving machine, Outrun. this time two years ago, and although it sold incredibly well, it was generally considered to be a disappointment. Two years on and history seems to be repeating itself for what we have here is a conversion of the sequel to Outrun. Turbo Outrun. Is it better than the original? Well, read on and find out The aim, as in Outrun.is straightforward enough in that you've got to race across America in your gleaming red Ferrari. with the sun whistling through your shades and your blonde girlie sat by your side. This time round, though, you have a set route from New York to Los Angeles ahead of you instead of a nameless batch of freeways. and the Testarossa in the first game has been swapped for a considerably more powerful (top speed of 202mph) F40. Gone too is the ability to choose the road you wish to drive on; to compensate, the number of stages has risen from five to sixteen (four states, each containing four stages). At the end of each state the option is given to customise the F40, making available such extras as a bigger engine, wider tyres and a more powerful turbo boost than the one already fitted. Prowess at the steering wheel is essential to completion of the course, as all the other road users will be doing their damnedest to prevent you from finishing. Don't be tempted to drive recklessly, however: poor handling could mean your fickle girlfriend leaving you at the garage in favour of your arch rival a hunky guy with a Porsche 959. Just about everything from the coin-op has been included in this staggering C64 conversion manual/automatic gear shift,variable weather conditions, the car bouncing when you hit a log, all the roadside objects... the only thing missing are juggernauts on the road and the massive flipover when you crash the car.

"REVIEW Lay that sucker out! Chao Lin, so they say, is a temple of peace somewhere in the wilds of Manchuria where the monks are taught meditation, the spiritual secrets of universal energy fields, and also how to beat the doo-doo out of just about anyone on the planet. Now you're sure to be thinking. yeahyeah, another beat 'em up. but where Chambers of Shao Lin differs from every other game of this type is in its six training sections which let you create your own fighter and build up strengths in particular disciplines. Then you can move on to a five-part quest to do over a dragon While some of the tests are just a matter of repeatedly dodg. ing bombs or an opponent with a large stick, there are a few which are quite ingenious. In the Test of Speed, for example, your baldy on-screen hero is standing on a platform in a well with two holes in the walls. through which gallons of water are flowing! There are two covers suspended over the holes, but to cut their ropes you need to release the catches holding up two axes by hitting them with a steel ball suspended at head height from the ceiling. High kicks get the ball swinging but mis-time it and you could end up with it between your eyes. Do well in certain disciplines and you'll be rewarded with mighty strength in the dragon mission. If you do particularly badly, you won't be able to perform some of the more exotic moves. The first part of the mission is made up of four, single screen beat'em ups, which, as single screen beat 'em ups go, are pretty good. The graphics are smart and the computer combatants are challenging opponents As I've already mentioned, the moves available are dependent on your success in the discipline rounds, but with a well-trained fighter there's a decent selection of kicks and punches. The final section is fraught with dangers, in the form of swooping dragonlets and rolling rocks, which your chap has to duck and jump over. All the sections are beautifully depicted on-screen, and if you watch the backgrounds carefully there's always someone flying a kite or a Ninja falling off a verandah or something. The sound effects are sampled, and if you have a 1040ST you get some very nice sampled music as well (520 owners get standard sound chip toons). PAUL GLANCEY UPDATE Plans are afoot for Amiga and C64 versions. A PC version of Chambers is being released by Cinemaware over in the States, so PC owners will either have to import it, or wait for someone else to distribute it over here.

Yeah, that's right, you've got to escape from 'em all BY RAINBOW ARTS ROCK' Although it's a generally simple task to roll around, tapping your feet to the Greasestyle soundtrack which blares out of the TV speaker as you go, it isn't long before you stumble across a highly unstable section of floor. It's possible to buy pick axes with which to repair these danger zones, but these implements aren't exactly cheap and you begin without a single penny in your pocket, so it's a good idea to collect the coins left scattered around by previous, less fortunate maze explorers. The coins vary in value, starting from $100, and you must be wise with your dough, only spending it on items which you need, as opposed to want. As well as pick axes, you can also spend your bread on bombs (to blow up obtrusive barriers YOUR CI and uncover previously hidden sections of walkway), armour (which allows you to smash down blockages found along the way) and parachutes (which stop you falling through holes in the maze). Keys must also be found to unlock doors in the maze. Completing most of the 32 stages is a real challenge, as the scales of fortune are definitely NOT in your favour and you're allowed only the bare minimum of objects to assist you in the search for each exit.

"Christmas is just around the corner, and just like every other year, that means it's time for software companies to start wheeling out compilations by the ton. Julian Rignall has been sorting out the bargains... STAR WARS TRILOGY CONTENTS: STAR WARS EMPIRE STRIKES BACKS RETURN OF THE JEDI C+VG COINOP HITS CONTENTS: THUNDERBLADE BIONIC COMMANDO ROADBLASTERS OUTRUN SPY HUNTER TIIIIIIIIIIIIIII SPECTRUM .99 An excellent all-round coin-op compilation with a neat mix of titles ranging from the classic Spy Hunter to last year's Christmas biggie, Thunderblade Outrun is getting on a bit and has a stupid multiload system, but Thunderblade and Bionic Commando are both superb, OVERALL 87% AMSTRAD .99 Hours and hours of fun are an offer with this package. Outrun is dire, but the other games in this package range from very good to excellent. Definitely one for arcade junkies OVERALL 83% THALAMUS: THE HITS CONTENTS: SANXION DELTA QUEDEX ARMALYTE HUNTER'S MOON HAWKEYE VIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII C64 .99 A stunning package of some of the best C64 games ever. Hawkeye is good, Hunter's Moon is a stunning visual and aural experience. Quedex is weird, but very playable, Sanxion is ageing, but is still a good blast, and Armalyte and Delta are two of the best shoot 'em ups on the C64. And just to make the package even more worthwhile, Delta features the best computer soundtrack ever written, and a fantastic Mix-e-lode music loading system. An absolute must for every C64 owner.

Recommended. OVERALL 80% C64 .99 The C64 isn't much cop at doing vector graphics, and the versions of Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back suffer as a consequence, with slow frame update making the game jerky to look at and tricky to play. The Return of the Jedi is blocky and doesn't really capture the atmosphere of the arcade original OVERALL 63% ST .99 Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back are both virtually indistinguishable from the arcade versions. Return of the Jedi packs all the features of the coin-op, but is let down by poor graphics and occasionally quirky gameplay. Still, this is a superb package for Star Wars fans OVERALL 81% AMIGA .99 Exactly the same criticisms as the ST package the only difference is the clearer sampled speech on all the games. Star Wars fans shouldn't miss this. OVERALL 81% Thunderblade and Outrun are good. Spy Hunter is superb, but the star of the pack age is Bionic Commando, which sports some brilliant platform action and some amazing soundtracks.

"REVIEW TIIIII 0000250 a Roz an Axel has become mega-rich, due to all the royalties which he received from being named in the Beverly Hills Cop theme tune, and he's as happy as a sand lark because of it. Unfortunately, his girlfriend Lucy isn't what you'd call over the moon, as she's been kidnapped by a big, green dragon whose song was rejected by the film company. Axel, being the charming chappie that he is (and because he wants even more publicity and royalties), braves the terrors of the outside world and sets off to find young Luce... The dragon is hiding in a faraway castle which Axel must reach to pay the ransom, passing A Our helmeted hero busts bricks 'n'blocks. of all those cute japanese games, with devilish woodland creatures bogging you down wherever you go, lots of goodies to collect and a host of hidden rooms to hunt down and loot. Unfortunately, programmers Core have made one little slipup while attempting to put across the feel of a trendy Japanese arcade adventure when was the last time you saw Mario or Alex fighting their way across a black backdrop? Garish colour is all-important in this type of product, something which has been overlooked. Still, that's hardly a niggle. and Axel's Magic Hammer gets AXEL'S MAGIC BY GREMLIN HAMMER 0026000 oooooooo the thumbs-up from this reviewer. It's captured the feel of the consoles, with a host of cuddly graphics which you'd want to snuggle up to. were they not trying to do you in, and music is suitably bouncy, jingly and generally superbly suited to the proceedings. Brilliant! PAUL RAND though eight different lands before reaching his woman. A myriad of baddies must be annihilated along the way, which include poisonous snakes, vampire bats and primitive pygmy tribesmen. To add to this confused state of affairs, Axel must collect all of his cash, which is hidden throughout the eight levels (the shy superstar doesn't trust banks), in order to get his girl back safely. To protect himself from the rigours of the outside world, Axel carries a hammer with which to biff the baddies over the head, as well as to smash the many blocks which contain the loot. Some blocks, though, hide useful objects which our lad can utilise on his journey, articles which include new weapons. extra lives and keys to secret doors Axel is working to a strict time limit set by the dragon, but he still has enough time to search the many bonus rooms, hidden across the levels, which may or may not contain money or objects Anyone who owns a Sega console will immediately realise where the programmers have taken their inspiration from; the thought of Alex Kidd practically butts you in the face from the word go. In fact, Axel's Magic Hammer is a clever combination UPDATE The Amiga version of Axel's Magic Hammer will be released shortly, and with the exception of a few minor colour and sound alterations, should be exactly the same as the ST game.

"THE ARCADE IN YOUR BEDROOM If you're one of those who's always wanted a real coin-op in your bedroom, Mention Technical Services has something that you could well be interested in. Paul Glancey has the story... But this isn't the most exciting feature of the Arcade Plus, though. Inside the veneered chipboard casing, there's a circuit board which lets you hook up the main program board from any JAMMA-compatible arcade game to the joysticks. Effectively this means you can slot in any game with the same single joystick/three fire button controls anything from old classics such as Bubble Bobble to newer titles Owning an Engine or a Megadrive was one hard-to-beat pose for anyone who wanted to be part of the real gaming elite. I use the past tense, because now there is a way to out-cool Johnny \"Consoles\" Chuckletrousers across the street Mention's Personal Arcade Plus. After many months of importing and selling consoles, Mention Technical Services have decided to take the arcade experience even further with a coin-op cabinet which fits around a Megadrive, PC Engine, in fact any console or computer on the market. It's a sturdy pre-built wooden box that comes in black, silver, red or wood veneer and is, to all intents and purposes, a coin-op cabinet. At the top of the machine is a shelf into which you put a SCART monitor/TV (it can be up to 19 inches wide). Incidentally, you MUST have a SCART socket on your monitor otherwise the machine won't work. Once the monitor is safely stored, all you have to do is plug the cabinet's joystick circuit into the controller ports of your console (just like plugging in a joystick), bung in a cartridge and switch on. The cabinet has two arcade-quality sticks, six fire buttons and two select buttons which you can use on any one or twoplayer PC Engine or Megadrive game. The gubbins. Plug in and go! he Smart eh? Jim gets to grips with Side Arms. like Prehistoric Isle or Golden Axe. Obviously newer, classier boards cost the most (Robocop would set you back around ) but you can pick up old games such as Bombjack, Yle Ar Kung-Fu, Pengo, Exiron, Ikari Warriors and Tiger Heli for as little as  in the classifieds of arcade trade papers like Coin Slot. The high turnover of arcade games mean that there are heaps of bargain boards coming on to the second-hand market every month. At .99, the Personal Arcade Plus is an obvious luxury, but it gives arcade fanatics the chance to play real coin-op games at home at a relatively cheap price (since a proper arcade cabinet of similar standard would set you back over ). Older arcade boards can be bought surprisingly cheaply, often only a few pounds more than a PC Engine or Megadrive cartridge, and you can always sell boards at very little loss once you're bored with them. If you've got the cash, the Personal Arcade Plus is an innovative and highly desirable piece of equipment that any arcade fanatic would want in his bedroom.

"EVIEW ST AMIGA SPECTRUM VIIIIIIIIIIZ TOOBIN BY DOMARK kay, okay! I know it's winter, and it's most probably just about to pour with rain, but imagine yourself in California on a sun-kissed day. It's hot. Reeeeeal hot. To cool off, you and your buddy Bif each grab a sixpack of Cokes, inflate a couple of giant inner \"toobs\". Jump in the creek and prepare to let your troubles float away.. But as you doze off downstream, you start to dream that the creek has become a wide, wide river. Suddenly, off to the right, a tree plunges into the water and floats in your direction! If it punctures the toob it'll be certain glugsville! In desperation you hurl one of your coke cans towards it and, amazingly, it goes straight to the bottom! But before you have time to get cocky, some more formidable foes appear further down the bank... Fishermen cast their deadly Dodge the snakes, Bif! CREDIT 2 Yaah! It's the 'gator! F1 UA hooks at you, and you have to use your hands and feet to frantically paddle your toob away from rocks, sharp branches in the water and nasty toob-eating snakes. The only way you and Bif can ever wake up from this nightmare is to toob it all the way to the end of the river and that means running the gauntlet of a daunting array of hazards. Every so often the river forks with each separate tributary leading to another world. In Hillbilly land, blunderbuss-packing bumpkins are after our buoyant boys. Hell is full of such nightmarish creatures as skulls, knife murderers and pyramids with eyes. Even worse is The City (all concrete, nasty punks and pollution), and then there's The Jungle and Ice World which are CREDIT. 2 CRECT 152 "


"REVIEW WITA both teeming with deadly wildlife... To make things even more difficult you have to manoeuvre your toob through bonus gates. Miss too many and a giant 'gator swims down from the top of the screen and tears you limb from limb... But it's not all a nightmare. There are extra coke cans dotted around the river which can be picked up and hurled at the baddies, and if you grab a sixpack, you'll have an unlimited arsenal very handy. Beach balls speed up your rubbery ride and there are also extra lives to collect in the form of toob patches If you manage to reach the beach party at the end of the final level, the nightmare is over and you can return to normality (as if anything in California was Hillbillyland on the Spectrum.

Well, OK, it has, but only insofar as it's based on the events of the American Civil War. Stop yawning at the back, there sure it's a strategy game, but there's not a hex-grid or co-ordinate entry system in sight. In fact Infogrames' effort is an ingenious arcade/strategy game in the Defender of the Crown mould which pits your Yankees against the computer's Confederates (or the other way around).
