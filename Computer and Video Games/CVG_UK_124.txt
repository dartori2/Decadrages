"NEWS THE BATTLE BEGINS! Nintendo have marked 1992 down as the year they do great things with the SNES in Britain tackling the mighty Megadrive head-on, Mega CD and all. If all goes according to plan, Nintendo reckon they'll be launching a CD drive for the American SNES in 1993 at the ridiculously low price of $199 (about 130!). Meanwhile Sega are gearing up for the official launch of the Mega CD in Britain in autumn this year, and they'll be releasing some topper titles (including, for certain, Sonic ll on the Megadrive!) throw down the gauntlet. It looks like the stage is set for a real ding-dong battle between the two giants for the title King Of The Consoles and at the end of the day it's YOU who decide who wins! SPECIAL REPORT OFFICIAL! UK SUPER NES! (IT'S A SUPER FAMICOM!) The merry month of May will be a biggie for Nintendo fans across the land when Nintendo unleashes the official UK Super NES onto these shores with more than a few surprises thrown in. So before your trousers burst with excitement, here's TIM BOONE with all the facts... HOW MUCH WILL IT COST ME? The official UK SNES will sell for , with the utterly fabby Super Mario World thrown in free, gratis and for nothing. Other early official titles will include Sim City, F-Zero (both pretty fab) and the utterly fab and completely superb Super Tennis the Tonkin House classic which has gone down in the CVG Hall of Fame as one of the greatest two-player laffs ever! Other titles will follow soon after, probably kicking off with Actraiser (cool), R-Type (super cool) and Super Ghouls and Ghosts (everyone likes it except Paul Rand and me). Prices will hovver around the  mark. SUPER NESTHE FACTS REVEALED! Hold onto your hats, 'cos the news is big for Super NES fans awaiting the offial launch of the UK machine. First, it's definite ly going to be released in this country in May. Second it's not going to look like a Super NES at all. In fact, it's going to look incredibly similar to the Japanese Super Famicom and it will NOT be compatible with American or Japanese games. Crazy old world, huh? Internally the machine will be identical to its American and Japanese cousins (except, of course, it'll be configured to run on UK PAL tellies), but it's going to look pretty much like the classic Super Famicom we know and love. But here's the really strange bit it'll use controllers very similar to the Super NES joypads, all colour co-ordinated to look dead nice on your table-top! ENTERTAINMENT SO WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? Confused? You won't be once you realise that the Super Famicom, Super NES and UK Super NES are basically the same machine inside different boxes. Quite simply, the powers that be at Nintendo decided that the UK version of the machine is best suited to the Super Famicom look. So the official UK SNES will look like this: a Super Famicom called a Super Nintendo Entertainment System on the box with American-style control pads and a newly-shaped cartridge slot to stop people playing grey imports. But you can bet your bottom dollar somebody will come up with a converter like they always do... LUMME! LET'S HEAR SOME MORE, MATEY! So, stay tuned to this very spot for more info on the mother of all console battles the very microsecond it comes our way. And why not drop us a line if you've got any views or questions about the whole thing at: THE SUPER MEGABATTLE, CVG TOWERS, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. We'll print a selection of the best and throw in a hundred quid's worth of software for the top of the lot, so get scribbling! The Japanese Famicom A British Super NES will look quite a lot like it!

"NEWS STREETFIGHTER '92 BURSTS INTO BRITAIN! XCLUSIVE! Just as CVG was going to press this piece of gobtastic news flew into the office Streetfighter '921 Yes, yes, yes. apparently the greatest arcade game in the history of coin-guzzlers has been given a bit of a revamp and could soon be hitting an arcade near you soon! Details were thin on the ground as the CVG bloodhounds sniffed out the news, with lots of cards being played closely to chests. However, informed sources tell us not to expect a fullyfledged segeul but a beefed-up version of everyone's fave beat 'em up. We reckon this could involve some new characters to scrap with (and new moves to master) together with tweaked graphics and backgrounds. However, this is nothing more than informed speculation nobody knew diddlysquat as we put the mag to bed 'cos the machine was due to be premiered at the ATEI arcade show. So, if this news has you slobbering all over the carpet, make a date to grab the next issue of CVG the second it hits the stand, 'cos that's when we'll have the full in-depth report on what could be the arcade event of the year. GAMESMASTER GOES FOR THE GOLD! It's Britain's first ever all-computer games TV show, and by all accounts it's a bit of a runaway success. Millions of gamers are tuning in to Gamesmaster and the Channel 4 phone lines are jammed with calls after every show. Faced with the prospect of actually meeting the incredibly famous CVG crew, we thought the celebs put up a pretty good show and didn't let fame go to their heads at all. None of them passed out with excitement, but one or two could well have passed things it would be best not to go into... Anyway, if you're sad and stupid enough to have missed all the televisual treats up to now, keep hitting yourself over the head with something blunt and reasonably heavy until you remember it's beamed out at 6.30pm on Tuesdays so now you can switch over straight after Neighbours! NOW THE NEO'S A PAL! It's the biggest, spankiest console around. Its games are massive, with a price to match and it's only been available through grey importers. Up until now, that is. It's the Neo Geo and now everyone can experience the Rolls Royce of consoles 'cos it's now available as an official UK PAL machine! The conversion to PAL has had the Neo Geo's producers, SNK, pulling their hair out in large, greasy clumps but now it's finally arrived! If you didn't already know, here's the staggering tech spec of the machine: two main chips run the show a 68000 and a Z80A, adding up to a staggering 24 bits of processing power! 4,096 colPAUSE ours can be displayed at one time from a palette of an unbelievable 65,536, which will come in handy when colouring in the incredible 380 sprites. Near-CD quality PCM sound completes the picture, the whole lot of which is used in games which can be as huge as 330 Megabytes that's the equivalent of well over three hundred Megadrive cartridges! As you'll know, there's a snag when it comes to possessing all this awesome power the price. The basic unit costs .99, with games starting at a pretty ridiculous .99 and going up to an astronomically expensive .99. Those are the official prices, but the mail-order companies have already got their deal heads on. Console Concepts, for example, are selling the official Neo Geo on its own for , or  with the game of your choice (and your Neo would look pretty silly without any software unless you enjoy turning things on and off for a laugh). If all this is just a tad out of your price range, don't despair official distributors DGM are busy talking to a variety of video and hardware hire shops in order to secure a rental deal on consoles and games. Just thinkthe power of a coin-op, with such wicked titles as Burning Fight and 2020 Baseball, in your own home. Now that's something to think about... TE 22 "


"NEWS Addams WA WWF IT'S A SMASH! ere's news of few pretty super Super NES products you'll Ibe itching to get your hands on soon-'cos they're all from the same company and all of them are looking pretty fab. Games giant Acclaim have been in a whirlwind of activity lately, buying up top console licenses left, right and centre and even finding time to take over all the 16-bit games from the now-defunct Mirrorsoft into the bargain! All of a sudden the US company has become a major noise in the UK games market, with a whole sackful of topper titles on the cards. Just drool over these screenshots of Smash TV and WWF Smash TV looks like a near-perfect acrcade conversion featuring just about every detail of the original, while WWF looks set for superstardom with a wide range of moves a brill graphic effects. Both won't be available until a bit later this year, but since we're so red hot we thought we'd give you a sneak preview anyway. We're going to be having a look at the Super NES in quite a lot more detail pretty soon, so keep your fingers superglued to these pages for all the sticky stuff on the latest and greatest! USG GRABS A GOLD! It's got to be the biggest license of the year! Actually, it could I be the biggest of the last four! Birmingham-based games giant US Gold has clinched the rights to Olympics '92 and the game should be racing its way onto a Sega system near you in time for the big event! Programmers are currently beavering away on this megalicense spectacular, to be unleashed on Megadrive, Master System and Game Gear in early summer just before we all go Barcelona barmy and stay up all night watching the pole vault on the telly! We're told the game will feature a whole fistful of Olympic events, with plenty of waggling wonderment for budding athletes everywhere. Included in the line-up are 100 metres dash, pole vault, hammer throwing, high diving, swimming and archery to name but a few! This could be the biggest game of the summer, maybe even the entire year, so keep those peepers plonked right here for more news the moment we get it. Ocea TM &  1991 PARAMOUNT PICTURES CORPORATION.

"NEWS THE GRE: SPECIAL REPORT GAME DOLL UP! ROLL UP! It's the greatest Ngames show on Earth, when all the latest and greatest gaming goodies are shown off to all sorts of incredibly important people from all over the place at the glitz and glamour capital of the world Las Vegas! To get in you have to have loads of cash, a dead flash car and your own company or a few copies of CVG. Big Ed TIM BOONE joined the spammy jet-set and flew to Vegas for the games event of the year. This is where the world's games industry shows off all it's top hot products, and for a few short days all the console games everyone will be playing for the rest of the year are all under one roof! Over the page you'll find the only complete list of EVERY game at the show, but for now let's take a look at some of the highlights... CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOWS ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION KONAMI KICKS OF WITH CONTRA It's action all the way with Konami this year, showing off loads of brill Nintendo titles to drool over. Top of the lot was an incredible early demo of Contra IV, looking totally spiff and playing like a dream. Turtles IV (Turtles in Time) is another biggie from the coin-op maestros, and I was dead impressed with the speed and fastpaced action of the early version on show. Watch out for STREETFIGHTER II HITS SUPER NES OFFICIAL! It's almost here Streetfighter II on the Super NES! For me, this was THE event of the show. Quite simply. Capcom have delivered a near-perfect conversion of the Best Arcade Game Ever! After fighting my way through the crowds glued to the screen and actually getting a go, I reckon this could be the greatest console game EVER it's that good! Somehow the programmers have captured the speed and feel of the coinop, with huge chunky sprites kicking five kinds of crap out of each other in fine style! Start saving that cash now, \"COS SF2 is due for release later this year and it looks like it's going to be mega! Magic Sword was the other biggie featured at the Capcom stand, also due later this year, and a nice-looking conversion of the arcade slash 'em up. STRIKE EAGLE FOR SNES! Hotshot from the fighter sim masters is F15 Super Strike Eagle previewed at the show. Not too much to see, but this is one to watch out for together with F117A Stealth Fighter on the humble NES! IT'S THE INCREDIBLE ULTRABOTS Another SNES hotshot of the show was a playable early demo of the fab-looking Ultrabots, featuring hugescale 3D laffs in a mega robot rumble to end 'em all! Having played the early version, I'm really looking for ward to this! Wonderboystyle Joe and Mac made its debut on all three machines, and pretty darned good it looks too! COLOUR GAMEBOY RUMOURS RIFE! A CES show without any rumours is like a butty without any bread, and it was whispers ahoy amongst the games world that the Colour Gameboy is due for imminent releasel Sadly this turned out to be a pile of old horse droppings, and it's going to be quite a while before Nintendo unleash their latest hand-held wonder on an unsuspecting world. Importantly, CVG's spies in the sky tell us a colour Gameboy will definitely NOT be compatible with existing cartridges (bool) but more than that we just don't know.'cos nobody except the top bods at Nintendo does either. One rumour which DID stand up to scrutiny was a mega-cheap CD for the Super NES SO read all about it in the News section right now! "


"EATEST IES ON EARTH LYNX LAFFS A-PLENTY Atari weren't exactly making big noises at the show, deciding to wait before unleashing their long-awaited and much-publicised 64-bit Jaguar games machine later on. This time round they did show off a fairly impressive lineup for the Lynx, including loads of sports titles for their fabby hand-held World Class Soccer, Hockey, NFL Football, Baseball Heroes, Malibu Bikini Volleyball(!) and Basketbrawl. Other Lynx goodies coming your way this summer include Super Squeak, Shadow Of The Beast, Deamonsgate, Lemmings(Ray!), Ninja Nerd and Dracula. Hurrah! There was tons and tons of Gameboy stuff on display to all and sundry among my personal faves were Prince of Persia, Asteroids, Faceball 2000 and Trick and Trap (Spy vs Spy!), but it has to be said that new Game Gear goodies were not exactly overwhelming. Never fear, though, 'cos Sega has loads of tasty licenses to dish out and we should be seeing them pretty darned soon. Class Soccer, Hockey. NFL Football, Baseball Heroes. Malibu Bikini Volleyball(!) and Basketbrawl. Other Lynx goodies coming your way this summer include Super Squeak, Shadow of The Beast, Deamonsgate, Lemmings(Ray!), Ninja Nerd and Dracula. Hurrah!

Never fear, though, 'cos Sega has loads of tasty licenses to dish out and we should be seeing them pretty darned soon. THUMPING GREAT LAFFS? Sega's big event of the show was the appearance of none other than World Heavyweight Champ Evander Holyfield to promote his brand new boxing game on the Megadrive! While everyone else was crowding round trying to get the great man's autograph, yours truly managed to get a go of the game and it has to be said i was more than a bit disappointed. So-so graphics and over-simplistic gameplay add up to a game that's probably best left in the dressing room. Sorry Holly. TIM'S TOP TREATS Here's a quick list of the stuff that really blew my ass off at the CES. There was plenty of good stuff on show, but these are the truly outstanding titles you'll be wetting yourself to get hold of! SUPER NES: Streetfighter II (it really is that good!). Ultrabots (3D bot-busting action that's second to none!): PGA Tour Golf (it was in credible on the Megadrive and looks even better on the SNES!): Gunforce (utterly brilliant conversion of Irem's own arcade blaster): Top Gear (the best home console racing game I've ever seen): Smash TV (pixel-perfect arcade conversion): Falcon (great on 16-bit. better on SNES). Battletoads (a hoot and a half!) MEGADRIVE: Alien III (great gory fun galore!). Side pocket (fabby pool bonanza): American Gladiators ('cos the show's brill as well): Rolling Thunder II (probably the best-ever Megadrive arcade conversion). Steel Talons (looks great. but how does it play?): Lemmings (of course). Terminator (it's the business) NES: Turrican (looking very good): Ultimate Air Combat (great air-to-air laffs): Megaman IV ( cos he's great), Empire Strikes Back (better than Star Wars!): Robocop III (another Ocean goodie): Casino Kid II (loved the original): Super Spy Hunter (raay!): Battletoads!! GAMEBOY TOP FIVE: Super Hunchback (great gameplay!): Batman Return Of The Joker (moody and brill!): Super Off Road (top racing action): Pitfighter (with incredible sprite scaling!!): Asteroids (utterly fab). GAME GEAR TOP FIVE Super Off Road (again!): Alien III (well'ard!): Marble Madness (just great). Olympic Gold (fabby pad pounder!): Pacman (because I love it). Best bits of the show Playing all the great games, the real-life Barbie model. Las Vegas, fruit machines. Worst bits of the show Playing the crap games, the outside loo for a thousand people, fruit machines... * * * * * * AMERICAN GLADIATORS PITFIGHTER PACKS A PUNCH! One of the biggest gob-smackers of the show came on the smallest screen Pitfighter on Gameboy! Somehow the programmers of THQ's arcade conversion have managed to include sprite scaling very similar to the coin-op! Quite how they did this I don't exactly know, but it involves very clever screen manipulation and has to be seen to be believed. I saw an early version, but it's already down on the list as a Must Have! WINGS ACES HIGH "

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY ELECTRONIC ARTS MAD BAD MISSIONS The Apache pilot's tour of duty spans five missions, each one made up of a number of targets, all of which must be hit before the next, more difficult assignment can be tackled. Just like the real thing (except it isn't, because Desert Strike isn't based on actual events at all), you'll be taking out radar stations, POW camps, SCUD sites Sounds like a nice feller! and a whole lot more! Those triple-A's don't look too friendly... LISTEN UP. PILOTA RETURN TO THE GULF . 18.308 PRETRE LORE BEWE B-MISSION C STATUS o n August 12th, 1990, the Iraqi Army rolled into the tiny province of Kuwait and stayed there until they were kicked out by an international fighting force headed by the British and Americans early 1991. What's that got to do with Desert Strike, we here you ask. Well, nothing, according to Electronic Arts, who reck-ON that their game is not an attempt to cash in on the horrors of that recent conflict. Piloting a heavily-armed AH-64A Apache gunship. across an un-named desert battle zone in the Gulf, the object of Desert Strike is to complete a number of missions by destroying various strategic targets. Take them out in order, and try not to get shot down by the Iraqis Sorry unknown enemy forces, as you're only given a few choppers to play with. DESERT ISTRIKE Desert Strike reminds me of an ages-old C64 game called Raid On Bungeling Bay, which was a top-down blast in a helicopter and a very good one at that. Electronic Arts have taken that idea and brought it into the nineties with a swish Apache gunship, a controversial scenario and a dash of 3D, to come up with a fun (if slightly bad taste) piece of blasting action. There's a definite strategy to Desert Strike just flying in there and shooting hell out of targets is going to get you killed in a matter of seconds. Generally, the graphics are well done, especially the helicopter which really does look the part and would have any thirdworld grunt cacking his knickers. It's a pity that the sound effects are of only average quality: the noise of your rotor blades is a pitiful click, for instance. But all in all, I think Desert Strike's a good 'un, even though it gets a little samey the longer you play. PAUL RAND EXTREMIST EXTRAS Yeaah! The good ol' Stars 'n' Stripes! You be in a sorry state if all you had to rely on was your standard Apache and the few weapons which you begin with. So it's a good job that your brave boys have gone to the trouble of depositing extra items around the desert. Fuel, ammo and armour can be found (if you look hard enough) but use. them sparingly, as there isn't an infinite supply! 022 "


"REVIEW .Get that box of ammo and start blastin'! A No time to sunbathe, lads. GO GET THE GRUNTS Not only have you got to destroy your allocated targets, you'll also have to be a bit of a hero and rescue your chums who are holding out throughout the desert under a barrage of enemy artillery and sniper fire. When you see one of your men (they're all dressed in brown), just hover above them; a ladder will lower and he'll grab it! When your 'copter is full, simply deposit them at the landing zone for bonus points and then go back for more! Strafe them fents, boyeee! Desert Strike comes as a bit of a nice surprise from Electronic Arts. It's not often that the top simulation boys come out with a straightforward blast, but that's exactly what Desert Strike is. The actual plot of the game is just about the dodgiest thing I've ever heard of and there'll be a lot of complaints about some of the game's content. For the hardened shoot 'em up fan though, this is refreshing and brilliant. The screenshots don't really do the game much justice, it all looks a bit bland and Insipid, but the glorious animation and supersmooth scrolling actually make it look brilliant when it moves. There are tons of missions to accomplish, each with different objectives and for a shooter, It's very deep. The music by Rob Hubbard is fantastic, with brilliant guitar riffs and stonky sound effects. The game is slick, groovy and totally playable, you can pick it up straight away, but putting it down isn't quite as easy. One of the smartest games in a long while and essential stuff for Megadrive owners! FRANK O'CONNOR AH-64A  Dimensions: Length 58'3\" Height 15'3\" Wing Span 17'2\" Power: 2 General Electric T700-GE-701 Turboshaft engines, producing 1,696shp from each engine. Performance: Max speed 184 mph, can go faster but not without handling difficulties. Rate of climb 2,500ft/min Max range 300 miles (internal fuel) A He's going nowhere in a hurry. Take out that man with the pea-shooter! EXTINGUISH THE ENEMY Dotted around the desert are enemy soldiers who aren't averse to taking pot-shots at your Apache and with only a limited amount of armour at your disposal, you'll have to take them out quickly. Some of them only have a crappy pistol with them, but others usually hidden inside buildings carry portable rocket launchers, and they can do serious harm to your craft.

"SON OF BOMBER MAN Bomber Man first appeared on the PC Engine, it was such a massive hit that it wasn't long before it turned up in the arcades as a fully fledged coin-op. Strangely though, it was renamed and you can still find it under the name \"Dynablaster\" A Nintendo version did well in Japan, but never surfaced here. The Gameboy version, known as Bomber Boy, was superb and remains one of the best Gameboy titles ever. It's a pity to blow it up really REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY UBI SOFT > Domber Man was a smash hit, both in Japanese arcades and on the PC Engine. Over here in crusty old Blighty though, hardly anybody's played it. The game is one of those infuriatingly simplistic ideas, with that mysterious quality that makes it stand out from the crowd. The idea of the game is simple...murder. You enter a maze infested with a set number of baddies and it's your job to kill 'em all. The maze is made up of two basic kinds of wall, destructible and indestructible. At your disposal is the ability to drop bombs, these will explode in four directions, destroying any adjacent destructible bricks. They will also kill any baddie who foolishly walks into the explosion. At first, you can only drop one bomb at a time, so careful placement is required to off the bad guys. The bomb's power and reach can be updated by collecting certain icons and you can also gain the ability to drop multiple bombs. Once you've killed all of the screen's inhabitants, you have to find the exit. It's always hidden in a block, so you just walk around blowing them up until you find it. Simple as that. You let off a big one! Screen shots from Amigo version. Things are getting hairy EXTRA BITS 'N BOBS There are quite a few hidden surprises in Bomber Man, all of which are designed to aid your progress. By collecting a certain icon, you can make the explosions you create larger, destroying more blocks at once. Remember though, the explosions can kill you too, so get out of the way fast. You can also collect a bomb icon. This allows you to drop more than one bomb at a time. The blocks are normally impassable, but collecting a token allows you to walk through, unharmed. Roller skates work as speed ups, but are very hard to come by. Come back with my girl! Well, this has to be the biggest gaming surprise in the history of the Amiga. Hudson Soft, the people who programmed the original on the PC Engine, have released Bomber Man on Commodore's baby! It's called Dynablaster and it's faberoony! Bomber Man and indeed Bomber Boy were a pair of console treats and this version is almost identical...only better! The combination of frantic running and strategic planning makes this an arcade gamer's delight. The graphics, while simple, ooze character and style. The animation is fluid, the screens are bright and jolly and everything moves quickly. The inclusion of a joystick adaptor means that five-player malarkey is possible and you wouldn't believe how much fun that is! The music deserves a special mention, it's wonderful! The sound effects are totally cheesy and the whole thing feels great. As far as playability is concerned, this is a dream come true. In one player mode, it's a massive and addictive task, but in head to head (with up to five players), this is truly awesome! This is just one of those essential purchases and I guarantee that absolutely everybody will love this! Get it! FRANK O'CONNOR GANG BANGING! The Bomber Man package includes a very special joystick adaptor. This allows you to plug four joysticks in at once and lets another player use the keyboard, so up to five players can bomb away at the same time. When you get a gang huddled round the monitor trying to blow each other up, things get heated to say the least. It's an excellent gimmick and it makes piracy very difficult indeed.

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY GREMLIN GRAPHICS TAKE HEART YOUNG MAN! The whole game revolves around hearts. Obviously the game's objective is to mend the broken heart, but you also use hearts as weapons. These fire outwards in a gentle arc from your magic glove. You can update this weapon by collecting, you guessed it, a heart! The sections of heart you need to repair, are scattered all over the kingdom and it's gonna take quite some time to find out where Harlequin looks puzzled...ho, ho, ho. HOPPER The land of Chimerica is in big trouble. The life I of Chimerica depends on a dirty great thumping heart. Unfortunately for the people of Chimerica, that heart is broken and it's up to you to fix it! This game comes from Gremlin and should be in the shops shortly after you read this. You play the part of Harlequin, a bit of a silky boy, turned masked vigilante. Your task is to find the four pieces of the broken heart and put them together again. Unfortunately for you, most of the inhabitants of Chimerica are pig-ignorant and will do their best to hinder your progress, if not actually kill you. The game itself is a scrolling platform extravaganza, not entirely dissimilar to Robocod. It features all the usual bits and bobs you've come to associate with the genre, like extra weapons, hidden levels and secret bonuses. All this and a massive 23 levels (each level is massive too!). A Watch out for that triangle, it's tears are deadly. SPACE ANTICS Harlequin is great! It's a multi directional scroller, more than a bit like Robocod, but with enough original features to make it stand out from an otherwise samey genre. Harlequin borrows heavily from other games, including Sonic and Super Mario Bros. Fortunately, it borrows all the best bits and the results are spectacular. The graphics give the game a very distinctive look and feel and generate oodles of atmosphere. Although basically cute, there's an underlying sinister theme that's hard to ignore. There are lots of things to see and do as you explore. The inclusion of clues and thought bubbles makes finding things easier and you have a fairly hefty task to perform on each and every level. The sound isn't too bad, but is outshone by the quality of the graphics and gameplay. The game is instantly addictive and it wont be too long before you're stuck in front of your telly, frantically trying to get past the trickier levels. One of the best platform games on the Amiga and a huge, huge challenge. The pick ups in Harlequin are bizarre to say the least. They include an angel fish to help you swim. An umbrella helps you fall safely from great heights and a burger restores energy. You can carry circling rockets which destroy enemies on contact, but best of all, is the Space Hopper. This is a smart balHMM, THIS loon which allows you to A That guy bounce around the screen as SOUNDS in the top hat well as destroying any varis trouble! mints it touches. FAMILIAR!

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .00 BY PALSOFT BIG SCREEN BONANZA Fans of the Double Dragon games are in for a treat late this year. Golden Harvest, the company who brought you about fifty squillion Martial Arts movies, as well as the two Turtles films, have signed up the rights to Double Dragon. Don't expect a romantic comedy though, this'll be a punchfest of gargantuan proportions. It looks set to start shooting very soon, so more news when we hear it! Double Dragon is probably the most famous beat 'em up of all time and this, its sequel didn't do too badly either. The first told the tale of how Billy and Jimmy, the Double Dragon brothers, rescued their girlfriend from the evil clutches of Mr. Big. In this sequel however, things are much worse for the girlie. Mr. Big has ordered and successfully carried out her execution. Bummer! The Double Dragon brothers are understandably furious and set out to seek revenge. They have to cross the same country to reach her, although few things have changed since they last entered that neighbourhood. For a start, it's a lot rougher than it used to be. This isn't much of a problem for these two though, cos they're hard as nails. Both Billy and Jimmy are top rated Kung Fu masters and they both wear steel boots. A kick in the knackers from one of these lads and it's off to the local infirmary with you. For that same reason, all the baddies come armed to the teeth with baseball bats, chains, whips, bombs and machine guns (just to make sure you understand). So, the girlie's dead and there's nothing to lose. Kick ass! DOUBLE DOUDEACON DRAGON THE REVENGE KODAKAKO Oo BE] DEBO x2 25888 PAUSE HOO000000 Albet he likes big dinners! The first DD was a bit of alright. Never before had we seen such inexplicable violence and destruction. The use of weapons like baseball bats, whips and great big rocks was too much to resist. The sequel in the arcades was a bit of a disappointment, the game was essentially identical, with a couple of new baddies thrown in for good measure and slightly tweaked graphics. This wont matter to Megadrive owners though, as you can't get the first game on Sega's baby. Graphically, this is alright. The backgrounds are nice and colourful, spoiled somewhat by the jerky and slightly chunky sprites. The game plays fluidly enough and has the same feel as the arcade machine. The odd control method has been taken straight from the arcade, the A button always kicks or punches left and the C button always strikes right, even if this entails a back kick. Although a little confusing at first, you'll soon get used to it and it works quite well after a while. Soundwise, It's no great shakes, but the slapping, bashing noises are decent enough. All in all, a solid and respectable addition to the genre and a must for Double Dragon fans. FRANK O'CONNOR Natty purple cossie. innit! 032 "


"REVIEW MY BEST FRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND Billy and Jimmy are the best of pals and both of them fancy the same girl. Unfortunately, she's a one guy girl. Mind you, she is dead at the start of the game, so the competition for her love is forgotten until the last level of the game. When you reach this point, said girlie is magically reincarnated, so Billy and Jimmy have to slug it out to see who gets to snog her. What kind of girl is she? A Yaab, she was asking for it. A Don't jump kick their heads in. MT Yes, well. Frank reckons this is arcade perfect, but from what I remember the arcade version of Double Dragon II was good. This is absolutely appalling. Graphically it's a disgrace. Sprites are badly drawn and animated and, when there are a few of them onscreen, the game slows down to a ridiculous degree and there's really no excuse for that when you see some of the games on the Megadrive with their sprites whizzing about all over the place. Sound isn't bad, but it isn't very good either. But what is really disgraceful is the fact that I finished Double Dragon ll within threequarters of an hour! There's absolutely no challenge to be had here position your character correctly and the baddies will line up and practically beg you to kick 'em in the head. If this is all that Sega could do with Double Dragon II, I'm not surprised they never released the first game. My advice is to remove all thoughts of buying this from your mind and get one of the far more enjoyable Golden Axe games instead. PAUL RAND TOODIT Why not try this? What a fa eh? Whalebe bending to MEGADRIVE MARTIAL MAYHEM If you don't fancy Double Dragon 2. maybe you'd be interested in another beat 'em up? So far, there have been very few brilliant Martial Arts games, but the list includes the awesome Streets of Rage, very similar too, but a lot slicker than DD2. Revenge of Shinobi is a more platform oriented game, but still stands tall as one of the best Megadrive games ever. Kabuki Fighter is a great laugh and is kind of like Final Fight in the Middle Ages. Mind you, there's yet to be a great one on one fighting sim, so let's see a decent Streetfighter clone! A Or this? No time te rest.. There's kicking to be done Stomp on the tarty-pieces' heads. I believe a lat man can fly! GHOSTLY GOINGS ON Before Billy and Jimmy reach the final obstacle, they have to beat up their own ghosts. The ghosts rise mysteriously from nowhere and set about our boys. Smacking a ghost in the teeth is a lot harder than you'd think and it's no fun having your teeth kicked in by your own spirit. Quite how your ghosts turn up before you're even dead is a bit of a mystery.

"all FATE HOTI HOTI HOT! He's got to be one of the greatest dudes of all time, and here's Indiana Jones with a whole hatful of fab-looking new games in the pipeline putting the man with the hat on just about every machine there is! Lucasfilm have sure been busy beavers of late, with tons of Jones-related goodies coming your way pretty flippin' soon. Well, what else could we do with all these megatastic and completely Exclusive Indy goodies than stuff them Inside this cram-packed issue and slap the great man himself on the cover? After all, CVG is the greatest games mag in the world so make way for whip-crackin' pants cackin' FRANK O'CONNOR with all sorts of white hot Indy info... Atlantis was destrued when Thera es if that fisherman know anything To we go from here? Open Talk To Push Close Look at Pull THE ADVENTURE! Vahoo! All of you diehard Indy fans out there can relax. If you didn't get your fill of the whip wielding adventurer from the first three films, Lucasfilm might just have saved your life! Using a system very similar to the Monkey Island games, Lucasfilm have come up with an awesome looking graphic adventure. In this latest incarnation, you take on the role of the man himself. Indiana Jones, archaeologist and role model for hat wearers everywhere. His quest this time round, is to find the fabled city of Atlantis. Indy is approached by a top Nazi agent, who wants to know the value and authenticity of a mysterious artifact. Indy guesses immediately that the artifact is real and from the lost city itself. He then teams up with a gorgeous psychic girl named Sophia Hapgood and the quest for Atlantis is on! Mind you, this kind of stuff is never easy with the Nazi scum in hot pursuit. Use the icon controlled menu, collect the objects you need and do battle with the might of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich! Chatting Talk to Solda al Guen Pickup a bit easy P you're Indy.... DIRTY NAZI SCUMBAGS Poor old Indy. He's always being chased around the world by Nazis. Quite why they hate him so much isn't too clear. It probably has something to do with the fact that he keeps on nicking all their stuff. Every time the Nazis get hold of some bit of ancient swag, along comes Indy and pinches it. This is his third run-in with the Third Reich and it probably wont be his last. Don't you just hate those Nazis? WHAT AN MUSING STORY! Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis features Lucasfilm's incredible new iMUSE system. This was first used to excellent effect in the incredible Monkey Island 2. The system detects where the hero is and what the characters are doing at any given time. The music is then adjusted to suit the situation. The beauty of the system, is that there are no sudden changes, everything changes gradually, just like a real orchestra. With a decent sound card on your PC, the effect is totally staggering. 036 "


"WATONES:// and the THREE WAY GAMEPLAY! There are three ways, or paths, to play the latest Indy game, the first is the obvious one and uses the same kind of logical (and not-so-logical) puzzles that you've come to expect from Lucasfilm. This requires a combination of strategy and puzzle solving ability. The second option, is to play it as a purely action oriented adventure, using your whipping and fighting skills to best effect. The third option is a bit mysterious. Called the \"Team Path\", it apparently requires \"an intuitive sense and interpersonal skills\". Blowed if I know what that means, but it sounds like a more involved and difficult version of the first path. Fish-on-a-string? What's that for then? THE ACTION GAME! |ucasfilm are bringing out two distinctly differLent Indy games and this will be the second. It's an arcade adventure, with more in common with the likes of Heimdall and the Immortal than Monkey Island. It uses the now familiar isometric 3D viewpoint to portray the action. You can view the action from several viewpoints, useful for looking behind obstructing objects. Indy and his new girlie, Sophia Hapgood, have to find the lost city of Atlantis. To do this, they'll have to make their way across the world, visiting Nazi filled countries as they do so. The places you'll visit in. clude a top casino in Monte Carlo, a danger-filled naval base, a claustrophobic submarine and at last, the city of Atlantis itself. You can control both Indy and Sophia and each have their own special talents. Indy's talents are obvious, punch ing Nazis and whipping things, but Sophia has rather more interesting attributes...including psychic powers. Indy tends to get by through smacking people in the teeth, but if you take control of Sophia, you'll need to use your wits and brains to get anywhere. So, it's off to Atlantis for some undersea escapades! Indy steels himself for action... SOPHIA'S A TWO TIMING PSYCHIC The heroine of the story, Miss Sophia Hapgood, has in her to complete each section, cavo casino possession, some very important jewelry. This jewelry is you'll have to guide both made of a very strange substance called Orichalcum. This characters through the level. 3333 stuff is supposedly what the ancient peeps of Atlantis used to It's generally easier to get power their city. What it has done though, is bestow top psyIndy through, 'cos he can chic powers on the hapless Miss Hapgood. Mind you, the w hack people in the teeth if Nazis want the jewelry off her, so look after her! they get in his way. Sophia is Will our hero lose his shirt? No chance! a bit wet, so you'll have to be a top hero to save her miserable skin. Problem is, you can't just leave her to the mercy of the Nazis, which would make things a lot easier. Still, Indy's a caring kind of guy and he wouldn't do that sort of thing. 037 A "


"and the TEMELE OF 100m LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION! The isometric viewpoint of the action game, can at first seem a little confusing. Lucasfilm though, in their infinite wisdom, have included a multiple viepoint option. This allows you, at the press of a button, to look at the scenery from absolutely any angle. This comes into play when you're hunting for objects, as they can often be hidden behind bits of furniture. Look out for chocolate bars, Indy's partial to a bit of choccie! Cor! It's Casino laffs for the man with the hat! TERRIG INDY, INDY EVERYWHERE! There are absolutely tons of Indy games available, more than any other film license ever. There are versions of Raiders of the Lost Ark on almost every machine, including the Atari VCS. The second game, Temple of Doom, turned up first as an Atari coin-op, with computer conversions following soon after Next came the Last Crusade and this turned up in both adventure and arcade forms, the latter even appearing on the Sega Master System. Indy games fans are spoiled for choice! his WHERE IS ATLANTIS THEN? Nobody really knows where Atlantis was supposed to be, but whackos who believe in that sort of stuff reckon it's off the North African coast, between Egypt and Spain somewhere. The great Greek philosopher, Plato, wrote about Atlantis in his top-selling paperbacks. Apparently, the Atlanteans were possessed of great technological skills and were immortal too. Well, at least they were until the whole blimmin' city sank without a trace after a volcanic upheaval. MEGA SO YOU WANNA PLAYER SEE MEGA CD? The prospect of Indy action on the Mega CD should have you wetting your pants with excitiement, so here's the lowdown: all the indications are that there are BIG plans afoot for Lucasfilm titles on the Mega CD. Although there has been no confirmation yet, CVG's spies in the sky tell us that some pretty toplevel meetings with all sorts of important people have been going on. and now Indy on the Mega looks increasingly likely. We know for sure that Monkey Island will be making the allsinging, all-dancing transition onto Sega's new machine, SO you can bet your bottom dollar on a full-blown Indy game in the not-too-distant Mega CD future!

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY SEGA N arly! Bodacious! Station! It's California N Games and it's totally non bogus. Californian dudes don't waste their time playing bizarro games like soccer and baseball, they prefer to skate, skateboard or like, juggle hackey-sacks. More than anything though, Californian dudes like to surf. Yup, this is a simulation of some of the daftest sports ever. The list of games reads like a list of overnight fads. There's half pipe skateboarding, there's BMX racing, rollerskating, juggling and last but not least...surfin'! This is what those Baywatch types live for. This game was released on home computers yonks ago and met with critical acclaim. It's part of a long running series that started about a squillion years ago with Summer Games. We then had Summer Games 2, followed closely by Winter Games. This borrows much in the way of graphical style and gameplay from the first three and the result is a multi-player, multi-event laff. You can compete in any event and in any order, or just practise your favourite event for fun. The options are comprehensive and you can have up to nine competitors at one. CAUSED V Wipe out and you get no points SURFIN' USA The most typical of Californian sports is surfing. This is when some tanned, well muscled kid, stands on a big ironing board and slides along a great big wave to almost certain death on the rocks. The Sega interpretation of this is very neat. You move up and down the wave in a rhythm to build up speed and you can leap off the wave and perform a turn. Real heroes get points by shooting under the curl of the wave, Californians call this \"Curlin' some totally narly toobs, dude!\". We call it \"Very silly and dangerous\". It's just like the Old Spice advert! Bike bike beach action! Hacky sack action CAUSED Cor, what a laugh! This is one of the few sports sims available on the Megadrive, so you're not exactly spoiled for choice. The events themselves are a fair old laugh and the graphics, it must be said, are amazing. It's one of those games where you really need a few pals around to fully enjoy it. It's OK playing the competition against the com puter, but with a gang, it takes on new dimen sions. The five events may not sound like much, but each has its own appeal and can be thought of as a separate game. Sound-wise, this cart is reasonable, I mean the tunes are brilliantly done, but they're kind of depressing and don't really suit the game. Learning the different con trol methods for each event is fun and a differ ent talent is required for each sport. Some need speed, some need rhythm, but all need a laid back Californian attitude. California games is a brilliant title, but ultimately dull for one player. FRANK O'CONNOR WHERE'S THE FRISBEE Oh dear, oh dear... «  The original 16 bit versions of Cally Games, had an event not present in the Sega title. Frisbee throwing! This was excellent fun and it gave you the chance to perform some brilliant frisbee related pranks. This game worked best in two player mode and it was a right old laugh.

"G REVIEW SUPER NES .00 BY SUNSOFT/PSYGNOSIS 18_ 0% 4-2 animanisnonnnnn SERIES BLOCKERS, DIGGERS AND BOMBERS You have a very wide range of abilities to bestow upon a bog-standard Lemming. The list of transformed Lemmings reads like this: Bombers, they self destruct after a short countdown, taking a good bit of scenery with them. Blockers, the most commonly used, they simply stop the Lemmings from walking any further. Diggers, they dig straight down with their bare hands. Miners dig in a diagonal line using a pick-axe. Bashers punch through rock and earth in a straight line. Bridge builders build diagonal ramps. Parachutists use umbrellas to break their falls and finally there's climbers who can scale vertical walls. tud They're lean, their green, they writhe and scream. They're Lemmings and they're on the Super NES! Hurrah! This game caused a bit of a storm when it was released a couple of years ago. The original concept and the hilarious theme had 16 bit owners buying it by the bucketload. The game is essentially simple, you have to guide a number of suicidal Lemmings across a hazard-filled landscape. The Lemmings are completely thick and will walk to their death over the edge of a precipice, through fire or even plummet to a watery grave in the sea. It's up to you to stop them. At the bottom of the screen is a string of icons. These give you the ability to endow a Lemming with a certain power. For example, if the daft gits look like they're going to fall off a cliff, you could make one a Blocker. He will stop dead and any Lemmings who meet him will turn back the way they came. Other powers include bridge building, digging, bashing and parachuting. You have to use these powers to get the Lemmings to the exit, usually on the right-hand side of the level. Sound easy? Don't kid yourself! 102 05 available. NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE If it all gets too much for you and you can't cope with the horrible little blighters anymore, you can call up the Armageddon option. Activating this causes a timer to appear above the head of any Lemming on screen and after a count of five...Kerblammo! The Lemmings are history and you can try that level again. The explosion as the all kick the bucket simultaneously is quite impressive! IN 1802 Lemmings! If you haven't played it, you haven't lived! This game scooped about fifty squillion awards last year and it deserved every one. It looks dead boring. but appearances couldn't be more deceptive. The big worry about the Super NES version, was that the control method might be iffy, remember, the original used mouse control. Fortunately, the SNES' six fire buttons make it a joy. The control method employed here is actually easier to use than the original and a lot faster. The graphics aren't really up to much, but the animation is superb. Sound-wise, this knocks spots off the Amiga version, with brilliant tunes playing on every level. As far as gameplay goes, this is faultless. It's easier to get into than the Amiga version and harder to get out of. It's not difficult to find yourself playing at three O'Clock in the morning, trying to get past that particularly nasty level. There are so many tricks and surprises in this game, it's a joy to behold. There are only two really essential purchases on the SNES, Super Mario World and now Lemmings. What more can I say? Buy it! FRANK O'CONNOR HOW TO WIN AT LEMMINGS! There are a couple of very easy knacks to playing Lemmings. The first, is to pay attention to the hints that sometimes pop up on the screens between levels. Secondly, you should always pause the game and take stock of what's on the screen. The timer stops when you pause the game, so you can stop and think about it all day if you like. Also, keep the rate at which your Lemmings pop out of their burrow down, it's no fun when a hundred death-hungry Lemmings throw themselves off the nearest cliff! WHAT'S A LEMMING? A Lemming is a real animal, famed for its suicidal antics. It looks a bit like a gerbil and it's actually quite cute. They don't really commit suicide, as is the popular myth. This stems from their total stupidity when it comes to swimming. Lemmings can't really swim, they're completely crap. but they will carry on trying. To an observer watching them try to cross a river or pond, it looks like they're trying to pop their corks. SUPER NES GRAPHICS 86 SOUNDS 91 PLAYABILITY 94 LASTABILITY OVERALL 93 "

This I'M SO STUPID time I'm asking questions. 1. On Super Mario 3 you said there was a small two-player game. I know I'm probably wrong but is IT HURTS it when you move your Mario on the map screen onto Luigi or Dear Yob, vice versa? 2. What happened to the end of my last letter.

Why don't you lot write in and tell me which one is best and why, just as long as you don't live in crappy places like Kent. HELP. I'VE GOT NO BRAIN! Dear YOB, I've got a few things to point out to lots of ignorant people out there, so here goes. People claim that consoles are computers. This is all very well, but then they go on to say that consoles are more capable than computers this might be true with graphics and sound but can they do business applications, type letters or animate? Then these people go on that consoles will force out computers but how can this be true if consoles are computers? And anyway. could a console run a business? Most great games are released on computer firstRobocod, Lemmings and many more. You might think I'm against consoles I'm not. I think they're great but they have their place and that is alongside computers and it's likely to stay that way for a long, long, time yet. JOSS FARMER Claverson, Warwick 400 It's true that you need a good computer to carry out business applications and type letters, but who wants to do boring trash like that when there are games to be played?

"STUPID THICKIE SPECIAL FE O 10 TAS AM I DUMB OR JUST STUPID? JUST CALL ME THICKY MICKY Dear YOB I wrote to say that I think your letter pages need a bit of colour. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with them being black and white, but it would add to the atmosphere. For instance, in your pages you like to draw things like somebody being mashed to a pulp or pictures of brains that have decided to lie he ground and be labelled \"badly needed\" and other things that involve the writers of silly letters. Well, if you added a bit of red and a few greens, things would start livening up. But then you might have to have your other brilliant pages in black and white. Oh well, perhaps you shouldn't have bothered reading this! MICHAEL COOK Crawley Down, West Sussex. Dear YOB, I am a great fan of CVG and I like GO! as well. I like handheld machines and I think they are the biz (especially the Gameboy with loads of cool releases on it).

I bet these people would not dare say it to your face. I think you should go to the local asylum and give the doctors all the addresses of these sad cases. I wish these people would act their age!

YOB If you give me  million I promise not to tell the world what a useless dipstick you are and I'll throw in a free subscription for the next thousand years. Dear YOB I've read a lot about the Megadrive game Sonic The Hedgehog and it sounds brilliant. The problem is I don't have a Megadrive to play the game, so I was wondering if Sonic will come out on any other console or computer in particular Nintendo or Amiga. If it ever will could you please tell me the date. I would be very grateful. RHODRI JENKINS Cardiff YOB: Nintendo Sonic? What are you on? As for Amiga, Sonic should be doing his thing on the 16-bit machines sooner rather than later, but I can't tell you any more because, well, I can't be bothered really. Watch the News pages for more info. Meanwhile, get a new first name... Dear YOB, My aunt has an NES.

Oh, about a hundred and fifty quid probably, so let's have a few before I have to print another useless letter like this... WHAT'S AN IQ, ANYWAY? MY BRAIN'S AS DEAD AS A DODO Dear YOB, I have a few questions. 1. Which should I buy a Famicom or a Super NES? 2. What kind of plug is best for the computer. 3.

No. Dear YOB, My brother (who is 10) hogs the new Nintendo we got for Christmas. He is a real addict and I can't get a look in.

PS I am 8 years old and my mum has written this out for me 'cos my writing's not too good yet. YOB: I have two suggestions: 1.

"STUPID THICKIE SPECIAL A BRAIN THE SIZE OF A GNAT'S WEDDING TACKLE Dear YOB, I am a Sega Megadrive owner, which I am damn well happy with, although I'm slightly jealous of my Amiga owning mates. Why? I hear you ask. Well, they can buy compilation CDs which have a collection of different games on one CD for their Amigas, as can owners of all other computers. Why the hell can't us console owners buy cartridges that give us more than one game? Surely this is not too much to ask! Paul McArdle, Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire YOB: What are you on about, you drooling git? You can't buy CDs for the Amiga (except the sad CDTV) and it would cost about two hundred quid per cartridge to do compilations on a console. Do us all a favour and eat your own brain. I'M TOO STUPID... THICKY DICKY, THAT'S ME! Dear YOB. Whatever happened to The Bugs? The best cartoon strip in any computer magazine has vanished. All I did was stop buying the mag for a year or seven and you stop printing Bugs. So what did you do to them? Did they fall foul of some horrid, nasty virus or did you just callously edit them? I am aged 22 years and much too old to play silly computer games (so my mummy confiscated them). RL LEE Bream, Glos. YOB: It's cost you a stamp to send this letter in, but it doesn't cost me anything to call you a sad lump of pigeon trots. Next... Dear YOB, I'm writing in reply to James Carter (issue 122). I can understand his feelings about new games on the Amiga, but to say that consoles are inferior to the Amiga is wrong. I don't think there should be any comparisons because they're equal. If you only like playing games then buy a console, but if you also want to use it for education, business etc then buy a computer. I think that James Carter was talking out of his ass just because there are not many new good games available doesn't necessarily mean that consoles are taking over. Many people just want to play games anyway so why spend  or so on technology that you wouldn't use? It doesn't make sense. That's where consoles come in. There is little in the way of great software coming out on the Amiga but on the consoles at the moment there are loads and loads of great games including F22 and I think both the Amiga and the Megadrive should be able to live together side by side and not in competition. RICHARD WESTWOOD Chasetown, Staffs. YOB: I think I know what you're waffling on about, but I'm not quite sure. The Amiga v Megadrive debate goes on and on, so I'm going to perch my backside right on the fence and hope you lot write in before my ass falls asleep and I fall off... THICK AS A PLANK, THAT'S ME Dear YOB, Last May I got a brilliant Nintendo! It was the action set and I completed Mario in three days. But my sister trod on one of my hand controllers, so now I can only have one player on my games. I guess you're wondering why I wrote this letter. Can you send me the Nintendo Power Glove and answer these questions: 1. Will Final Fight come out on the NES. 2. If So, when. 3. Are there plans for Super Mario 4? DANIEL BAKER Southsea, Portsmouth YOB: This letter is pathetic. You are about as clever as a chicken climbing up its own ass looking for birdseed. I wish your sister had trod on your head wearing steel toecapped boots. AS DENSE AS FOG Dear YOB, Please answer the following questions. 1. Is it possible to use a normal AC adaptor with a Gameboy? 2. Has Nintendo got any plans to release Super Mario 1, 2 and 3 on the Gameboy? 3. Are there any good snooker or pool games on the Gameboy? 4. Out of the two Robocop games, which is the best? 5. Have Commodore any plans to release a handheld? M. Willsher, Plymouth, Devon YOB: 1. No way thicky, you need a special adaptor. 2. Absolutely not El Stupido. 3. Yes, about three or four good 'uns Dr. Sad. 4. Robocop 2 is the best you daft git. 5. Please God, no!! (6)11... I'M DUMB-BOY DARYL Dear YOB I have a few questions: 1. Will Mario 4 be converted onto the NES. 2. What exactly is a Powerglove? 3. Can I say Hi to my mate Jason \"Lard-ass\" Wells?

"ROBOCOD Part robot, part fish, all fab cheat from Andrew Soper of Bedfordshire, who has sent in the following tip. On the castle where you select your levels, go down to the third tower. Go onto the roof between the third and last tower and walk straight into the tower. You should disappear and then reappear in a sub-level where there are a further two doors at the boftom. BOSS 3 GHOST Stay close and fire at him using any weapon. Then crouch down and he will jump over you and back again. Repeat the process until he dies. BOSS 4 BAD PETE First of all, kill both of Bad Pete's boys. Then jump up onto the top-right platform. Pete will travel up the gap between the platforms or from the far left. Fire a plunger at his head then run far left on the top platform then run back to the top-right and fire. Keep doing this until he waves the white flag and choose the diary from the menu to get out. BOSS 5 KNIGHT You'll need the plunger to kill the knight. See which way he is going to face you can tell by the way he raises his sword. Fire a plunger at the wall and stand on it, then fire at his face. Stay there until the blocks have fallen. Repeat until he is no more. MICKEY MOUSE CASTLE OF ILLUSION Can't remember ever printing this cheat, which has been sent by Jake Hawkins (wonder if he has a sister called Sally) from Cheltenham in Gloucester.

Here they are in full, courtesy of Max Harrower of St Austell in Cornwall. EDJI HICI FLLD LIBC CCAL EDIL HICI FLAK ICAH LALD And the final code? LFEK. PAUSE MEGADRIVE F22 INTERCEPTOR The first tips for the first Megadrive flight sim, courtesy of Steven Cain who says that he will introduce me to his dog's teeth if I don't print his campaign codes. Well, we can't be having any of that, can we? Here's the codes: USA: 6PGEO2 USSR: KSQGIV KOREA: BIOF8P ACES: MHO1K1 IRAQ: GTGESV QUACKSHOT STARRING DONALD DUCK! A jolly little cartridge, and a quick set of Boss deathtype stuff from young Mark Shrimpton an apt surname for he lives by the beach down at Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. OUT RUN Steven Cain again, this time with a cheat for the rather average conversion of one of Sega's greatest ever coin-ops. To get a different end-game sequence, enter your name as ENDING on the high-scores table. BOSS 1 DRAKULAR Stay in the centre of the screen at all times. When Drakular fires his bats, fire popcorn at him to defeat him after a while. BOSS 2 TIGER Crouch down in the centre of the screen and, when the tiger does a high jump, fire upwards at his head, using popcorn if you have enough, otherwise the plungers. ROBOCOD What an amazing cheat I've got for you, all the way from Paul Nightingale in Jersey. Walk right, to the first platform and jump onto it you will be able to see some objects on the roof. Pick them up in the following order: SEE CAKE, HAMMER, GLOBE, APPLE, TAP You will now be invincible! TE From here, fall down off the left-hand side of the roof and walk to the right until you reach a door. Go through it and walk to the left. Collect the star and go through the exit. You'll now be able to enter any door! 055 "

"ARCUSS ODYSSEY This isometric 3D Gauntlet type jobby has kept Jason Henry up till all hours at his Selkirk, Scotland abode, long enough for him to jot down a load of passwords and pass them on to me. SUG WIZARD WARRIOR LEVEL 2 HAYAAAACJA LEVEL 2 IAAAAAAARJ LEVEL 3 HD4NBAAFK2 LEVEL 3 IIAYAAAHOO LEVEL 4 JI1DAAIKDC LEVEL 4 KJEDQAAJ1V PHANTASY STAR A bit of a pointless tip, this one from I don't know who because he hasn't put his name on the letter and I've thrown the envelope away (so remember, always put the address where it can't be lost!), but give it a go any. way. Press the START button, and hold down button B to slow down the game. Hmm. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG You sent in tips for the Megadrive version of this amazing platform corker in their hundreds now it's the turn of all the 8-bit Sega specialists among you. Well, one of you anyway. And you haven't even included your name! But you do come from Washington in Tyne & Wear, so now you know who you are. To access level select cheat, push UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, 1 and 2 DEVIL CRASH There've been surprisingly few hints for this amazing pinball sim, but Suleman Noor of Bradford hopes to correct this sad state of affairs by starting the ball rolling with this following smashing cheat. Start the game with a chosen password, then press PAUSE and hit buttons A, B and A. Jot down the pass word then press B and A. Write down the password again (it should be different to the last one). Reset the game and enter the password screen in two-player mode it should ask you to input 20 characters. Input both passwords and start the game with both players with the same score and number of balls. MIRACLE WARRIORS Want to find all the keys in Miracle Warriors? You do? Great! Just read the following piece of advice from Steve Swincer: Go round the large desert on the bottom-left hand side of the map. Press button 2 and a menu appears on the top-right hand side, called SPELL. Key in the right spell to transport you to the Cave system. When you find the chest, open it to be confronted by a guardian. Defeat it and you will be given one of the three keys. Repeat the process until you have all three. MASTER SYSTEM COMMODORE 64 ALEX KIDD IN MIRACLE WORLD David Gilchrist from Sydenham has been beavering away at this fine cartridge, so much so that he's come up with the folowing tip. When you kill the first octopus (by punching his tenticles), go inside his bowl to find a secret level containing loads of coins. WWF WRESTLEMANIA Seeing as it was the top-selling game of Christmas, it's not surprising that we're getting the odd tip sent in for it. One here from a certain Shaun Barritt, who hails from Clwyd in that land of sheep and, erm, more sheep. When the match begins, go down to the bottom ropes and wait for your opponent. When he is in line with your fighter start to run at him be shouyld start to flash and find it impossible to move. Perform flying knees or drop-kicks on him while he is in this state then, when he is out of energy, pin him down for the three-count. "

"REVIEW ** REVIEW MEGADRIVE .00 KICKIN' ASS IN STYLE Each of the three fighters available has a distinctly different style. Buzz is a brutish wrestler, who piledrives and punches opponents. He's very strong, but he loses out on speed. Kato is a Kung Fu expert who prefers punching to kicking, he's dead fast but doesn't have much reach. Ty is the best all rounder, a kickboxer, he's very fast and can perform some spectacular moves. He doesn't have to get as close as the other two...very handy! BY TENGEN PAUSE PAUSE Tool Three of the world's hardest geezers have been entered in a highly illegal fight! This is a no holds barred, rollocking bloodfest, where the losers leave in bodybags and even the winners leave on stretchers. Sex is no obstacle either, women are just as likely to climb into the arena as men and are often harder. The three heroes are Ty, Buzz and Kato. Each has mastered a different martial art and they'll fight anybody. even each other. The object of the game is to beat your opponent to death as quickly as possible. The quicker you do it, the more money you win. The action takes place in an arena, the watching crowd stand around in a circle while you fight. You may have to face more than one opponent at a time and you'll have to use all your skill, cunning and complete hardness to win through. The fighters get harder as you progress through the game, with the ultimate opponent being a masked hardman, totally huge and as the game says, totally awesomel So, use all the weapons at your disposal, knives, crates, sticks and throwing stars and go kick some ass! TOTALLY ILLEGAL DUDE! Pitfighter is based on an illegal event called Kumite. Kumite is an oriental term meaning simply \"light\". This is practiced by most martial arts, simple sparring usually. However, there are illegal Kumite in places like Thailand and Hong Kong, where there are no rules and no set styles. These are run by crimi nal organisations like the Hong Kong Triads. As the game, these matches often end in death or serious injury, so remember, don't do it at home kids! PAUSE PAUSE Pitfighter was a massive success in the arcades, with its digitised graphics and amazing sprite scaling. The simultaneous two player action had queues of blood-crazed video gamers waiting to pump in their credits. The gameplay though, was essentially very simple, with only a few moves at your disposal. This conversion retains the digitised graphics, but gone is the impressive scaling. Believe it or not, this actually makes it easier to see what's going on and this makes it a lot cleaner-looking than the arcade game. It does however show up just how limited the original was and as a result, the game is quite boring in one player mode. With two players though, it's a good old laugh and anyone who went nuts for the arcade game, will probably love this. The graphics are actually very nice, with reasonably slick animation and nice backgrounds. The music between screens is alright and there's a good bit of sampled speech and girlie screams. Ultimately, it's a bit too easy, but this doesn't matter if you play it with a friend. A reasonable beat'em up, but Streetfighter it ain't. FRANK O'CONNOR CROWDED HOUSE! One of the most distressing aspects of Pitfighter, is the fact that the crowd get a little more involved than they should. If you get too close to the surrounding throng, they jump out and attack you. It's bad enough when you're being wasted by a huge, lumbering psycho, but it's no fun getting stabbed from behind by a leather clad beauty: The crowd very occasionally help you out too, by whacking the enemy fighter, but not nearly often enough. 89 MEGADRIVE GRAPHICS SOUNDS 86 PLAYABILIT LASTABILITY OVERALL 82 "


"INREVIEW THE THIRD MAN As well as Terry and Andy, there's a third fighter to choose from. His name is Joe Higashi and he's got no axe to grind with Geese at all. He's only here for the glory, and what better way to grab it than kicking crap out of all the baddies and Geese himself? You can still choose him to fight with one of the Bogard boys, but he's got a pair of girls' shorts on and people might take the mickey if you're seen with him. NEO GEO  BY SNK V ahoo! What with the Neo Geo being all V V official in this country and all, here we go again with TWO megahot reviews for the wonder console. Do we pack it in or what? Anyway, here's CVG Neo hero PAUL RAND with all the goodies... Ten years ago, Jeff Bogard was brutally murdered by a vicious hood called Geese. Those were violent times, with killings occurring more regularly than car thefts, so no-one seemed to take notice. No-one, that is, except for Jeff's family and, most notably, his two sons Terry and Andy. For a decade they trained for the day when they would avenge their father's killing that day is now. It's the annual King Of The Fighters tournament, where the world's best braulers gather to battle for the ultimate prize: the title of Number One Fighter. Organised by a cartel headed by the now powerful Geese, it's the perfect way to complete the training and put it to the test for, should they get that far, the boys will have to go up against the reigning champion fighter Geese himself. WRESTLE WARS! Every couple of fights, you're whisked off to the bonus island to test your skills against one of those fairground arm-wrestling machines. To play, simply press the A button as fast as you can and, if you're hitting it quickly enough, you'll win. The first one is easy to beat, but they get harder on later levels. But don't worry about losing, because the game is only played for points. kane plot Massive graphics? Mountains of moves? It isn't difficult to tell where the inspiration for Fatal Fury came from. Streetfighter 2 is currently the hottest coin-op around, certainly as far as the lads in the office are concerned, and SNK have done themselves absolutely no harm in releasing this brilliant feast of fighting. No compromises have been made in the graphics department the character sprites are huge and excellently drawn, with lots of great animation. Each of the three available characters has their own special attacks, giving the game more variety. The bonus screens are impressive and, what's more, you don't even have to do them if you don't want them, because they're only there to let you accumulate points. It's the action that shines more than anything, though. Even on Easy mode, Fatal Fury is no pushover, but the most enjoyment is gleaned from battling against a human opponent just watch their faces (and listen to their abuse) as you smack them all over the playing area. Out of the most recent batch of Neo Geo releases, Fatal Fury is up there with the best of 'em, so get your parents to remortgage the house and go get it. PAUL RAND Here's a bit of a whirl to sort out the bad boys! A When all else falls, run MANY good ON 13 MARVELLOUS MOVES Along with an ordinary assortment of kicks, punches and blocks, all three fighters have access to a selection of special moves. These are brought into use by a nifty combination of joystick movements and fire button presses, and they become more powerful the further GRAPHICS 93 into the game you progress. SOUNDS 89 Unfortunately, your opponents also have tricks of their PLAYABILITY own up their sleeves, so be sure to watch out for them otherwise you could well end up flat on your back and out of the game.

"OBO ARMY_ REVIEW NEO GEO BY SNK  arth is on the brink of destruction. A robot army created by a lunatic megalomaniac Is on the march, bringing chaos and terror to everything in its path. The world seems doomed. However, there may be a saviour. Rebel forces have created a prototype weapon: a combat cyborg. Half machine, half livIng tissue, with an array of combat skills and special weapons, this powerful creation could be just the thing to stop the terrible onslaught now ensuing. But surely, one cyborg can't stop a battalion of metal warriors? That's up to you. Step into the cyborg's metal frame and sweep a path through scores of manmade marauders, utilising a variety of moves and bonus artillery found throughout the game. At the end of each stage is a commander which, when smashed, allows safe passage through to the next stage, containing ever more difficult enemies. Well, what else do you expect? Kick butt! THANKS... ...to Console Concepts for the review cartridges used in both reviews. Call 'em on 0782 712759 for Neo Geo goodies. PUNGE! A DOUBLE DOSE OF DESTRUCTION If you can't manage to defeat the army on your tod just find a mate, plug in a second controller and indulge in twoplayer malarkey. You can't damage each other, but it's a great laugh pinching the items that the other player has fought tooth and nail for! A BIG GREEN RACING CAR Some of the robots, when destroyed, drop items which either boost your energy or give you extra oomph in the fighting department, depending on what's been picked up. The smartest item by far is the one which turns your cyborg into a big metal buggy, which can then be used to ram the attackers it's built onto your frame in a similar way to that seen in the Light Cycles race in the film Tron and it looks bloody impressive! me to kick metal ass Our grear GO! logo gets everywhere! Here's yet another Neo Geo fighting game and, like all the others, it's a good looker. Robo Army has some really classy graphics, with massive robots charging all over the place both on foot and on big motorbikes. Sound effects are superb meaty punches and kicks and some hot metal tracks playing away in the background. Robo Army is similar in terms of look and the way it plays to Burning Fight, itself a complete rip-off of the classic Final Fight. Trouble is, it's not as good as either, with only a few moves to put into action. There are a lot of special weapons available to break up the battering and, with only a couple of continues, at least you're not going to complete the game straightaway. Robo Army is very good, but Burning Fight is a better example of the genre. PAUL RAND NEO GEO GRAPHICS 90 SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 82 LASTABILITY 83 OVERALL 84 "

"Space...the final frontier! REVI MEGA CD $45.00 BY WOLFTEAM TWIRL THOSE SPRITES! The most widely used effect in Sol Feace, is the MEGA CD sprite rotation. This simply spins the sprites around as they move towards you. This effect is impressive, but the chances are that you wont notice it anyway. The worrying thing is that this effect has been seen before on the standard Megadrive, in a game called Granada X. where an end of level nasty spins around in much the same fashion. Makes you wonder just what the Mega CD can actually do. ol Feace! What kind of name is that? Well, as far as we can tell, it's the name of the spacecraft you pilot in this horizontally scrolling shooter. The plot is entirely in Japanese, so it could be about anything. Mind you, the plot doesn't really matter too much as all you have to do is fly along and shoot things. There are all the usual features in this game, like end of level bosses and extra weapons. The action takes place in deepest space, with hordes and hordes of baddies hurling themselves at you, loosing of bullets as they do so. The weapons come at set intervals, little pods which you have to shoot to release the goodies inside. The weapons simply boost your laser power, giving you wide shots if you're really lucky. The whole time you play, bits of space debris come spinning onto the screen. These are indestructible and have to be avoided. So, off into deep space with you young man and don't come back until you've saved the Universe. SPACE JUNK It seems that people of the future haven't learned their lesson. All the litter that you see in the streets is nothing compared to the junk floating around in space. There's tons of it. Collide with a hunk of damaged space ship and you're history. As it rushes toward your fragile ship. you can slow it down by blasting it, but it's easier and safer to avoid it. You'd think that there would be some kind of cosmic litter bin around, but no such luck I'm afraid. The big red thing of doom! All that technology, all that memory, all that speed and what do they do with the Mega CD? A horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up. Zilch out of ten for originality Wolfteam. That's maybe a little harsh, the game does have a few things going for it, like the incredible speed and impressive sound effects. It's difficult to know what to expect from the Mega CD, we've only seen one other game and that was a bit crap. Graphically, it's no great shakes, there's tons of sprite rotation, but fans of crusty old Granada X have seen the Mega drive do this anyway. In short, apart from the music, there's nothing here that a Megadrive can't do anyway. The intros are smart, but hardly awesome. The soundtrack is funky enough and there is a lot of music but to tell you the truth, you'd be better off buying something like Gynoug or Hellfire. Not a total waste of money, but hardly ground breaking. FRANK O'CONNOR OH NO! IT'S JAPANESE! There is one almighty problem with buying CD games from Japan. They're all in Japanese. It's not much of a problem with shoot 'em ups like this, but you do miss out on the huge narrative while you play. There's a ton of speech on this game and if you can understand Japanese, it probably adds greatly to the game. Sadly though, the chances of getting games with English text and speech are minimal. If you want to reap the full benefits, you'll have to wait for the official launch some: time in Autumn. Sega promise that there will be at least eight games available at launch time.

"REVIEW HEAVY MEGA CD $45.00 BY MICRONET in the future, law and order are no longer handled by humans. Sophisticated weaponry has made lite far to dangerous for mortal cops. Crime however, has a new enemy. Heavy Nova. Future cops. Steel replaces bone. Titanium replaces skin. These guys are kick-ass death dealers from space. As a member of the newly formed Tokyo Robopolice, your tasks are many and varied. You have to fight crime wherever it rears its ugly head and you have to do it with your bare hands. The robots have all been programmed with various martial arts skills and it lurns out that robots are the ones committing the crimes too. Yup, not a human being in sight in this scrolling beat 'em up. Just droids, droids and more droids. It's similar in style to Rolling Thunder, but without the guns. You can choose from a wide range of robots, each with their own range of moves and features. All you have to do really, is walk along a scrolling world, beating other droids up and avoiding traps. There is however, a two player head to head option, similar in many ways, to Streetfighter! INTERESTING INTROS Heavy Nova certainly looks impressive and the first thing you'll see when it loads up is a beautiful animation. This is a fairly big cartoon, with lots of flashy special effects and weird \"camera\" angles. Owners of PC Engine CD ROM machines will have seen this kind of thing before. These cartoons are also used to break up the various levels, with bits of plot and new assignments being shown between rounds. Neato! STUDIO RIVER KIDS?!! PAUSE The musical accompaniment to Heavy Nova was supplied by a top Japanese band called the Studio River Kids. A weird name and a weird band too. The lead singer is a girlie and she warbles on like an injured sparrow. sing. ing to a tune that sounds like it belonged to a video game anyway A crippled robot prepares to self destruct! So this is the CD ROM then, is it? Heavy Nova starts off with a very pretty intro, with a teeny-bopper One of the THE AMAZING SPRITE Japanese band playing master robots and singing in the back slides towards SCALE SCANDAL ground, while a typically our hapless Japanese cartoon shows robotic hero. Everybody knows that the Mega CD is capable of some bril the plot. The animation is Best thing to liant graphical effects, which is a bit odd seeing as this game very impressive, but there contains none. Sure, the sprites are big, but you've seen bigdo is to Isn't as much of it as you might think. Still, the ger. The backdrops are pretty, but nothing special. Rumour leap out gameplay's what counts and Heavy Nova has a has it that Micronet were told just to program it as if it was a of the way at few novel twists. For one thing, we all thought the last normal Megadrive, but with tons and tons of memory. Well, this was going to be a straightforward arcade that's what they've done, with zillions of levels, bags of possible beat 'em up, but this is really two different sprites, tons of music and no sprite scaling. Boool 15 any two diferent moment games. One is an involving scrolling adventure, with you thrashing ass as you explore the terrain. The other game is a simultaneous two player martial arts game. It's not exactly Streetfighter 2, but it's OK for a laugh. Indeed, that's the whole problem with Heavy Nova. It's alright. SOUNDS You've probably been expecting the Mega CD to be some kind of super dream machine. It may PLAYABILITY well, be, but Heavy Nova doesn't show it off. Neat graphics, slick animation and impressive LASTABILITY music, but nothing special at all. FRANK O'CONNOR  HD GRAPHICS 81 OVERALL 80 "

Only trouble is he's a bit of a bad lad, and with him in charge it's Doom Central for all and sundry everywhere! It's up to you to stop him but how? We know, but we're not going to tell you 'cos you'll have a load of fun finding out! This is just one of the five missions in the game, progressively more difficult and some seemingly impossible. Good luck! AMIGA .99 BY NOVAGEN It's a tough old life when you're a space-age Mercenary out for an honest buck. You risk life and limb to save other people's planets by getting rid of a rogue comet and they throw you in jail and chuck away the key! OK, SO you made a cool 50 million destroying the comet Damocles but that won't get you far when they throw you onto the street with a new assignment! This time round you face a new enemy, the enigmatic PC BII, Who is he? What does he want? Where did he get such a stupid name? How the hell are you going to save the solar system? Go to it, my lad, it's a whole new world out there... Any letters in that mailbox for me, postie? Check out the rectangular geezer by the window! MERCENAR CENARY LON CRISIS by Paul Woakes NOVACEN RETTES 017-51 ON-DE 30 05005 ET 00155 MERCENARY THE LEGEND Mercenary was one of the all-time great 8-bit games, featuring astonishing gameplay and a wireframe 3D world which was, in it's day, a breathtaking achievment. Then came Damocles (Mercenary II) and 16-bit gamers were at last treated to a true 3D challenge, with fabulous filled vector graphics and incredible gameplay to match. Mercenary III takes up the story where Damocles left off, only this time round things have changed in a big way. In Damocles, everyone had fled the impending comet of doom, so there was no one left to talk to. In this game they've all come back, and to get ahead you have to interact with some weird and wacky people! CONVECHTES Hoek se Yes it is, isn't it. 511-51 02-06 COOOOO NEGATIONS Crumbs! This is exciting! Mercenary maestro Paul Woakes still owes me approximately two months of my life, 'cos that's how much time I spent on Damocles. Now he's done it again! Mercenary lll is the sequel to the sequel in every sense, and if you're a fan of the originals this game is big news. Fabulous it certainly is in most respects, except I can't shake the nagging feeling I've done all this before. Sure there are characters to interact with this time round, and this adds a whole new dimension to the game, but you can't help thinking you've already seen it. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I'd like to have seen a true successor to the originals with a completely revamped setting and scenario. That aside, Mercenary III is the closest you're going to come to Virtual Reality on your home machine, and it's easy to get lost Inside this wonderful world. A worthy successor which could have been another classic, Mercenary III offers a fantastic gamesplaying experience, but just pips itself at the Hitl post by being a tad too faithful to the others. A great game nonetheless! GETTING AROUND TOWN Unlike Damocles, which boasted all sorts of ships at your disposal, getting around in Mercenary III is tricky to say the least. You can always call a taxi, but the vast journeys you'll make will eat into that cash. So why not catch the bus instead? You'll have to watch the timetable though, 'cos there won't alway be another one along in a minute! PLANETS A PLENTY Just like Damocles, Mercenary III features a whole solar system to explore, and the whole thing is slowly turning as you play. This is as close to VR as you're likely to get on home computer, and there's a great sense of \"being there.\" Just watch those two-mooned sunsets to see what we mean!

"REVIEW SUPER NES $45 BY HUDSON SOFT uper Adventure Island is here and it doesn't look anything like Wonder Boy, honest! Well, maybe it does look just a bit like Wonder Boy, but I'm sure that's a complete coincidence and Hudson Soft didn't pinch any ideas from Sega's great old game. Well, this features the most cunningly original plot you've heard for ages. Your girlfriend's been kidnapped by an evil magician, you don't get much of that in video games, do you? It's up to you to rescue her and you're well qualified for the job. You're a cherubic little caveman with some incredible jumping skills and a handy line in axe throwing. The land is filled with hazards, mostly the local wildlife, always hungry and generally deadly. You yourself have to eat a lot. A rapidly decreasing energy bar at the top of the screen must be topped up by scoffing the various fruits that litter the countryside. As you race across the prehistoric landscapes, you'll find a host of hidden goodies and secret bonus levels. as well as a fair bit of danger! So get to it Wonder Boy, er...I mean Adventure Island Boy! A Jollynpi EUSE TALLY ME BANANAS To stay alive for any duration in Adventure Island, you have to constantly consume quantities of fruit. These fruits float around in the sky (the way fruit does) and you have to jump to reach most of it. Some of the fruits are invisible, but can be revealed by shooting thin air for a bit. If your energy bar runs out through lack of fruit, you're history! A All sorts of sand-related shenanigans... PODEM BUUND Ooh! This is nothing like Wonder Boy (I don't bloody think!). No similarities at all as you guide a small caveboy over a prehistoric landscape, eating fruit and lobbing axes. The game is a blatant rip-off of Wonder Boy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The gameplay is a smart mix of platform action and combat related high-jinks. Graphically, some of the screens are wonderful, funny sprites, slick animation and brilliant characters. The graphics improve as you get further and further into the game and the end of level bosses are a hoot. The music deserves a special mention. It is, without doubt the best music so far on the SNES. The brilliant tunes even beat the awesome Actraiser and that's saying something. We liked it so much, we paused the game just so we could thrill again to the danceable commotion of groove filled greats. Awesome mixing, sampled voices and brilliant orchestration all add up to a sonic treat. The gameplay is simple and at times, frustrating. The sprite collision, while accurate, is unfair and leaves no room for error. Pixel perfect jumping ahoy! A good laugh though and a worthy purchase. FRANK O'CONNOR SUPER ADVE 078 "


"REVIEW SECRET SCREEN SURPRISE! There are tons of hidden bits n' bobs in Adventure Island, but best of all are the hidden levels. These are a sort of bonus sub-game and can only be found by doing something special and I'm not going to tell you what! Oh, alright then. You have to jump in a special way, and in a special place. If you fire a weapon and it stops for no reason in mid-air, that's where to jump. A star will appear and whisk you off to wonderland. You simply collect all the icons to get a free life. Simple. oo Wonder Boy revisited that's the simple description of Super Adventure Island. Don't be too downhearted though (especially because Wonderboy is a fab classic!). This game is sufficiently different to stand out from the crowd and hard enough to keep you stabbing at the old pad of joy for ages. Presentation is tip-top: sprites and backdrops are a syrupy-sweet dream and they get even better the further into the game you venture, And sound is absolutely unbelievable chock full of samples and the music is perhaps the best heard on any current Super NES game to date! The game itself won't have your brain doing cartwheels, but that doesn't mean to say it's not terriff, because it is, even when it's being silly and reckoning you've hit a sprite when in fact you've just missed it! A hearty bag of Won derboyish fun 'n' frolics is what you'll get from Super Adventure Island and you can't say fairer than that now, can you. PAUL RAND  olly jumping japery and no mistake! Getting a bit behind? Get your skates on! Flip me, look at the size of that! 22001 WONDER BOY DEJA VU This game is a total rip-off of Sega's Wonder Boy. It's actually a sort of sequel to a game called Adventure Island on the NES. This too, was a copy of Wonder Boy. Funny that, cos' Hudson Soft are famed for their originality. Still, it's a decent enough game and there are a couple of real differences (not many though). A Hurrah it's the secret bonus level! TITUTUNUTTU GREAT ISLANDS OF THE WORLD There are lots of famous islands in the world. There's Fantasy Island (Dee plane boss, dee plane), there's Alcatraz Island where Clint Eastwood lives. You could go to Rainbow Island and get eaten by a big spider. There's also Monkey Island and even Bog Island (it's not really an island, well actually it's a pub).

So, stopping only to round up the staff from sister magazine MEAN MACHINES, we rushed off to the West End for some serious pedal-to-the-metal fun and frolix in the amazing Arcade Action Grand Prix Challenge!

RACE ONE USA The Championship started off on the simplest track to give everyone a fair chance and the race certainly proved exciting. With a screech of tortured engines the racers burned off leaving skid marks all over the track whilst sad Rad and Gary left a few in their underwear! A five-car pile-up at the first corner left smug-boy Jazza lagging miles behind and Britain's arcade superstar never caught up with the pack.

Tim, Rich and Jazza fought for the lead. On the last hairpin turn, baboon boy Rignall tried to force the other heroes off the track but only succeeding in spinning off leaving Rich to grab the honours and Tim to amaze himself with second place. Way back down the track, CVG and Mean Machines sad shufflers Frank, Gaz and Oz showed in graphic detail the true meaning of the dribble-drive as they (s)crapped for 6th, 7th and 8th positions.

"SPACE GUN OCEAN Taito released the Space Gun coin op last year and the combination of a truly massive screen and the Op Wolf style of play made it something of a minor hit. The object of the game is simple, just walk through the labarynthine passages of a spaceship, removing any aliens you encounter with your big gun! You also have to rescue human hostages as they try to escape from the twisted alien space fiends. The graphics are reminiscent of the Aliens movie, with hundreds of slimy space critters roaming around the dark, smelly ship. The arcade game featured some impressive sprite scaling and rotation, but this has been lost from the Amiga conversion. The graphics though, are still quite nice and the version we saw had some lovely animation. It's a game for one or two players and with a pal, the game takes on a whole new dimension. Teamwork and cooperation are the order of the day (as well as a bit of competition to grab the extra weapons). The game can be used with mouse or keyboard, but ideally you should play it with the Trojan light gun. VERSION AMIGA DATE TBA TBA PRICE .99 .99 ST Ouch! Ouch! GAME OVER PRESS FIRE CREDITS 04 "

"BA ES ES pasiseks PARASOL STARS PARASOL STARS OCEAN BUBBY BOBB Darasol Stars is an arcade license with a difference. It was never in the arcades. This smashing Taito game is the third in the Bubble Bobble series and is a direct successor to Rainbow Islands. The game only appeared on the PC Engine, but Ocean have recognised its potential and snapped it up. The game has been programmed in-house by Ocean's own boys and from what we've seen, it's identical to the original En gine game. The game looks very much like Rainbow Islands, but instead of rainbows, you have to use an umbrella as a wea pon. You can whack the baddies as you leap from platform to platform, but smart dudes will collect the raindrops. These drip from platforms and can be caught on the top of the brolly. The more you catch, the more power you build, letting these raindrops go, unleashes a massive burst of power. There are the usual Rainbow Islands hidden screens and bonuses, as well as a few secret treats that weren't in the PC Engine game. The graphics are cute, the gameplay simple and this game has all the makings of a massive smash hit. VERSION AMIGA ST DATE TBA TBA PRICE .99 .99 092 "

"PRE LEISURE SUIT LARRY SIERRA al Leisure Suit Larry, the sadly dressed and infinitely lecherous pervert from the famous Sierra PC games, is about to appear on the Amiga. This means you'll be able to pick up girls, watch strip shows, gamble illegally and perform all manner of seedy tricks. Larry is a sexist pig and it's your task to guide him through a very dodgy adventure. The plot is very, very interesting, but seeing as this is a family magazine, we can't really tell you what it's about. This game has been available (for adults) on the PC for a very long time and it's sequels now number four. This, Larry's first outing is generally considered to be the best of the lot. The Amiga has been put to good use and both the graphics and sound are far superior to the PC version. It's an icon driven adventure, along the lines of Monkey Island, but with a different control system. The Amiga version comes on a massive six disks, so there should be a whole lot of lecherous gaming antics for all you Amiga owning pervs. VERSION DATE PRICE AMIGA TBA TBA Streal upem Ele the  HEIGHT:000.00 K M 0366 WARRIOR SA SHADOWLANDS DOMARK In a time when Dungeon Master, Captive and Eye of the Beholder have taken the RPG world by storm, it seems a little odd that someone should try a new formula for the genre. Domark have done just that, with their upcoming release, Shadowlands. This uses an isometric 3D viewpoint, as opposed to the 3D scenario we've all become used to. It borrows influence and ideas from all sorts of games in the genre, but adds a few new features and some brilliantly flexible controls. Basically, you take control of a party of four warriors. It's the same old story, each has different abilities, Wizard, Priest, Warrior etc. You can alter their attributes and powers, but strangely, this is a random process. Obviously these abilities can be improved as you progress through the game. One nice feature in the game, is the use of lighting in the lower dungeons. The torches give off limited light, so you can only see the illuminated sections of the dungeon. The party can walk around as a group, or you can split them up and send each off on a different mission. It's very easy to control the party members and switching between them is simplicity itself. We've seen a nearly finished version and the game is looking good! Look out for a review soon! VERSION AMIGA ST DATE TBA TBA PRICE TBA TBA 094 "

"PRE HOT RUBBER BORN TO BURN PALACE VIEW Now there's a name and a half but will the game match up to that cheeky title? Actually, it probably will 'cos Palace are hoping for great things with this fab-looking little racer. Pull on your posiest black leather trousers, stick a huge helmet over your head and take control of a mega-cool 500cc racing bike for 3D thrills 'n' spills. As you can see from these shots, the game is looking well tasty, featuring one or two player laffs across 12 different international circuits, loads of different views and tons of computercontrolled bike boys to burn up. Look out for the game in the Spring, when we'll bring you the full lowdown! Whoops dept: Last month we printed the picture of this lovely lassie next to Top Racer when this is the game she's supposed to be promoting. It's all the fault of Jon Billington but we'll let him off 'cos CVG's own boy racer claims her wing mirrors put him off.

Basically you're stuck in this research station and in a bit of bother 'cos all sorts of alien scumbags are overrunning the place and it's up to you to blow 'em back where they came from. The game scenario, it must be said, borrows more than a little (actually quite a lot) from the Team 17 Amiga smash Hostile Breed. Whether the game plays the same way remains to be seen, but Palace say they'll put you against intelligent hostiles and provide shooter fans with a brand new challenge. Keep your eye right here for more... ver fancied your chances in the Paris-Dakar rally? In a juggernaut?
