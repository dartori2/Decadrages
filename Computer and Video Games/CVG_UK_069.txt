We're sure you'll overcome all the dirty tricks he can throw at you with ease, agility and grace and a haughty «Beep Beep\".

The Coke cans feature in the Amstrad version too — but the graphics are generally chunky and the animation of your jogger is fairly crude. Perhaps the most disappointing version is on the 64. Once again you're faced with chuncky graphics. The music is good but just try playing the game with it turned off. Where are the sound effects? A few bleeps and burps for jumps and an explosion sound for the landmines. That's it. No running sounds at all. You might find yourself captured by the game for short periods but unless you REALLY loved the coin-op original and don't want to spend any more money trying to beat it, I reckon you might find the asking price of nearly  for some versions a bit too much. PLAYS. conversion releases for the summer. The original Namco coin-op wasn't a classic by any means and the US Gold programmers haven't done a bad job converting it. But I found early levels too easy to play and later levels too difficult. More on that later — but in case you haven't seen the game before, here's a quick run down on what it's all about. You find yourself in the running shoes of a futuristic jogger out to break speed records in a marathon race across a 23rd century city. The streets are full of hazards static, mobile and explosive. It's your task to run, jump and dodge as fast as you can and beat the clock — earning megapoints and progressing to the next, more difficult level. That's the idea how about the execution?

The moves are spin kick (roundhouse), punching and a REVIEWS SO Wizball BA Samurai Trilogy MACHINES: CBM 641 SPECTRUM/AMSTRAD SUPPLIER: OCEAN PRICE: .95 (CASS), .95 (DISK) VERSION TESTED: CBM 64 REVIEWER: PAUL Every so often a game arrives in the office with out fuss or fanfare which exudes quality, cleverness, ace graphics, brilliant sound and that elusive of all properties, originality. Welcome to Wizball. Step right into the colourful realms of Wizworld where the Wiz and his cat lived happily until the evil Zark stole all the colour making it dull and grey. Controlling Wizball, and its servant Catelite, you've got to restore Wizworld to its former brilliance. Each of Wizworld's landscapes is made up of three colours. By shooting the red, green and blue colour bubbles and getting Cat to collect the droplets as they shower to the ground, it's possible to fill the cauldrons displayed at the bottom of the screen until the target colour is achieved. When you zap an alien, green pearls are deposited on the screen. If Wizball can pass over it and pick it up it lights the first icon at the top of the screen. The Wiz can now select the feature. Obviously the more pearls collected, the more weapons available. Icon one: Gives more control over the Wizball, allowing it to move left and right. Antigrav halts the perpetual bouncing of the Wizball. Icon two: Beam the supabeam weapon. Double both the Wiz and cat get automatic two-directional fire power. Icon three: Catelite Wiz gets a cat. Icon four: Blazers Super power for the Wiz and cat. Icon five: Wizz Spraymega spray protection. Cat Spray same for the furry one. Icon six: Shields limited protection for Wiz and cat. Icon seven: Smart Bombthe ultimate killer. The Wizball is fiendishly difficult to control first of all, almost to the point of hairtearing frustration. If I had a gripe about this game it is that it's a little too difficult to get going. By the way, check out how the Wizball materialises on the screen. It appears to come out of its own mouth. Clever that. You can put spin on the ball using the joystick, hitting the fire button fires the weapons.

As you know, gnomes come in all shapes and sizes, well one size actually small. Some become great fighters, others renowned sorcerers, but all are well versed in the art of magick. Stryfe features two legendary gnomes in Vlamir, a top-notch sorcerer, and Olaf, who makes Rambo look like a performing flee.

These include Kobolds, Green Sprites, Trolls and Phantoms, all of which have different characteristics, mostly mean. Various objects can be collected to help you with your quest. Of these, the most useful are keys and potions. Golden keys give you access to the next region of Faerie. You can only pick up a gold key when in possession of a silver one. If Vlamir, the sorcerer, uses a potion, it will destroy all enemies together with any Gates of Evil on the screen. A potion in Olaf's hands will only destroy the gates. Other objects include hams for extra energy and a chest containing money and experience points. Each region of Faerie is dotted with trees, lakes, buildings, walls (that form mazes in some levels), hills, columns, and, of course, a liberal smattering of Evil Gates. All of which block your path. Often you'll have to use a potion in order to get to a key or the exit to another region. The screen is divided into the action area, occupying the top two thirds, and a status area containing the vital statistics of each gnome.

The excellent music yes, even on a Spectrum comes from none other than Rob Hubbard and is more than just a collection of beeps and burps. Graphics are as you'd expect from Gargoyle-pretty neat. I particularly like the baby whale. Overall, Hydrofool is the most fun you'll have with your Spectrum this summer probably this year. The best game on the Amstrad since Batman. If you thought the arcade adventure was dead, think again and think about raiding your piggy bank to collect the cash for your very own copy of Hydrofool. Don't miss this one. Stop press!

"*Stifflip desperate for something different then take a look at Stifflip. If you're already a Binary Vision fan, you won't want to miss this. Like me, you'll enjoy it a lot. Oh yes, there've some great tunes too! It's up to you to work out when and on whom to use physical force. It doesn't always work to your advantage. GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY Oooo MACHINE: 064 SUPPLIER: PALACE PRICE: .95 REVIEWER: TIM Trust Binary Vision to come up with something different. Well, they had to go some to follow Zoids didn't they. Well, Stifflip isn't Zoids II, but it does use some of the neat \"windowmation\" that you came to know and love after playing that first classic game. Stifflip is very clever and very playable. If you read our preview a couple of issues back you'll know that the Binary programmers delved back into the Boy's Own adventure style stories to bring you an icon driven graphic adventure featuring dastardly deeds in a banana republic. The screen is set up like a comic book page--the pictures are drawn cartoon style and you get two panels of action per through the adventure. Like say something on the lines of Zoids, your actions are \"Nice bar you have here.\" controlled from a series of icons The four characters each have and menus. a role to play in the adventure The first of these icons is as so you won't be able to Chinwag, the second is the complete it unless you keep Fisticuffs icon, the third is them all fit and well. Each Beetle-off, the fourth is Do carries things which come in One's Stuff, the fifth is State of useful but you might have to Play and the sixth is Change swap them around in certain Batter. All pretty easy to circumstances to achieve the understand. desired effect. On the right hand side of the Read the speech bubbles and screen shot you will see these examine each \"page\" carefully icons showing three different for clues to the riddles which characters. The top character open up areas of the adventure who has the eyepatch is Colonel to further perusal. R.G. Bargie, the second is There's plenty of humourProfessor Braindeath and the you may not laugh out loud but third is Miss Palymra you'll definitely snigger to Primbottom. yourself. The first character you get to And if you control is Viscount Stifflip manage to himself. Look at our screen defeat the shot. The fact that he is next to the character in the immediate past means one of two BiFN ? ETOFFLIP while BiF! cuffs while Ale-off Sne's stult evil Count Chameleon you're a better player than me! The only real \"arcade\" . sequence in the game is Fisticuffs which is a bit like the attack sequence in Zoids. You have to line up an icon on a revolving target and hit the fire button to biff your opponent. You can hit \"below the belt\" but this will affect the final outcome. Stifflip might not get the audience it deserves because its a sort of in-between game. In between an adventure, an arcade adventure, a bit like Redhawk in fact. But if you're a games player ate of play things. Either he moved away very quickly by selecting the Beetle-off area, or Stifflip beat him in a fight. If Stifflip were to talk to this character, the sort of thing he would say would be \"Now look here my good man\", whereupon Stifflip would be attacked. In the other illustration Stifflip is seen with a barman. If Stifflip was to talk to this character he would be likely to \"page\". As you move through the game the \"pages\" flip. A really nice effect. You can control any one of four main characters, but you'll encounter other helpful or unhelpful people as you travel hange batter "

SPECTRUM (PAUL) REWENS Mario Bros LH. Well, I was completely and utterly addicted to the arcade version of this, and so when I saw the advertisement for Mario Bros a few months ago, couldn't wait for it to arrive. Well it has, and I must say ! was rather disappointed by it. Don't get me wrong, it is about as close to the original as is possible with the limitations of the machine, but for some inexplicable reason, it just doesn't seem to have the same 'grab-you-by-the-throat' compulsiveness of the arcade original. Anyway, putting that aside for the moment, here's the plot. Bonjourno. My name issa Mario, And dis is ma brother, Luigi. We work in a disk factory, which has a very slippy floors, and issa inhabited by lotsa nasty creatures. We also have a very hard heads, which we can use to bend da Platforms, and knock thesea rotten animals onto their backs, where we can boot them toa kingdom come! Right, you can now read in English. All the features of the original are there, sidestepper, shellcreeper, etc, as is the two player mode, either working together as a team, or against each other. The graphics are fairly close copies of the original, as is the sound, which is why I cannot understand why this isn't half as much fun as the arcade version. For some reason, the comic style humour isn't there any more, which is probably why some of the magic has been lost. Overall, it's not a bad game, and it could just be that I was expecting too much of Ocean to capture the spirit of the game! was so addicted to in the arcades. Try before you buy is the rule with this one I'm afraid. It is good, but you might just be a little bit dissapointed. Right, lads, chest out, stomach in, you're in the army now. The going's gonna get rough and tough. Only the fit will survive a battle with Army Moves. C+VG has deployed its resources in force to battle it out with Dinamic Software's game for Imagine. Brian \"Take No Prisoners\" Webber became involved with fierce fighting which lasted days on the Commodore 64. Paul \"Shoot to kill\" Boughton launched a full frontal assault on the Spectrum version. Here's Brian's report from the war zone. WOW! This is great! Army Moves is the one game I've played every single day, for at least an hour, since the copy arrived on my desk. The game is split into seven sections, and comes in two loads, the second, I assume, is after level four because I haven't got passed that yet! You are a member of the Special Operations Corp, which has been picked to go into the enemy's camp, to retrieve some vital information, that could turn the coflict around. To get there you must negotiate many hazards, such as crossing jungles and deserts. The first, four sections are basically scrolling shoot 'em ups, in the same vein as Moon Buggy except that you drive jeeps and helicopters. Level five onwards is then on foot, trying to get the plans, and get back to the barracks. That is basically it. A fairly run of the mill storyline, and in some respects, a fairly run of the mill game, but for some inexplicable reason, I am totally addicted to this. Yes readers, me, the one who hates this type of shoot 'em up. The graphics, which although are not mega brilliant, do their job well, and from what I've seen of them are well above average. Soundwise, again, this is above average, with a brilliant rendition of 'Colonel Bogey' that would put the original Montry Mole game to shame.

"Moves 1111!A POINTS PHASE 5 version seems pretty much the same. The graphics are pretty naff but that doesn't really matter. Army Moves is strangely playable. It's hellishly difficult to get going. Your jeep approaches a whole in the bridge which it must leap. You can slow the vehicle down but you can't stop it. Just when you're faced with no choice but to jump the gap or plunge into oblivion, you see an enemy jeep heading towards you, or helicopters heading down to zap you. Army Moves is nothing if not annoyingly addictive. I kept saying \"I'll give it one more go.\" You know how it is? Thirty goes later you're still willing to give it a go.

The Spectrum Stormbringer Coopy 2,170 **SEHAAEPEAL MACHINES: SPECTRUM/CBM 64/AMSTRAD/MSX SUPPLIER: MASTERTRONIC PRICE: .99  REVIEWER: PAUL This review originally consisted of just four words: \"Go and buy Stormbringer.\" That's all there is to it really. But a large expanse of white space looks a bit odd. Stormbringer is the final game in David Jones' wonderful series of Magic Knight games. Remember Spellbound and Knight Tyme? At the end of Knight Tyme Magic Knight had encountered a problem or two with an unreliable time machine while trying to get back to his own era. He was split into two people. Now there's Magic Knight and the Off-White Knight, or as he is also known, Stormbringer. Stormbringer is the opposite of good. That means he's bad. Very bad. He gets his name from the very powerful storm cloud he can conjour up and with which he intends to destroy the good guy. You can't destroy Stormbringer because that would mean you would destroy yourself. Clever, eh? What you have to do is merge with him. Once again David has used what he calls Windimation as a means of giving the player command choices. That means a series of windows open on the screen, each with its own information, commands etc. It's the same system he used in the other two games to great effect. Magic Knight is controlled by joystick as usual. He moves back and forth against a series of backgrounds (great graphics). Picking up objects talking to characters and avoiding this annoying little cloud which zaps a harmful lightning bolt at you. There are 56 locations to explore on the 48K version and 64 on the 128K version. If you played any of the previous games you'll need no urging to go and buy Stormbringer. It's got great graphics, sound, fiendish problems and great game play. And at .99 you can afford not to miss out. This is how all budget games should be. GRAPHICS SOUND > VALUE PLAYABILITY wee "


"out on the 15th of July Next Month James Bond, 007, loomed over the shattered body. It had been a tough fight but Bond had triumphed. He leaned down and whispered into the terrified man's ear. \"That will teach you not to miss Computer + Video Games each month especially when it has the first review of my latest computer escapade The Living Daylights in,\" he said. And you'll be equally shattered if you miss the world's best-dressed computer magazine with Domark's The Living Daylights and competition which, unlike Bond's martinis, will leave you stirred AND shaken. We'll also have the latest on The Living Daylights film starring Tomothy Dalton as 007 which is about to explode onto the silver screen this summer. Top Secret.

Pangea, C/O Anvil Games, 74 Aarons Hill Godalming, Surrey, GU72JL in from the USA, where it is a smash hit PBM game. They have been running quality PBM's in the UK since 1985 and Ageyptus is their biggest commercial release to date. Each game can accommodate up to 150 players and the world is mapped over 100 by 100 squares. There are other points of the game that I haven't the space to comment upon in depth, but you can get involved in naval combat, encounter sea monsters, harvest food, mine, create weapons and lumber forest. The game is undoubtedly a good one, it oozes quality and style. It presents a comprehensive portrait of ancient times. The rule book, which is well produced and nicely set takes you through the game step by step. I also like the concept of this game. It is a social/economic/financial strategy based game, with the warfare option included if you need it. It is not a \"hack and slash\" basic wargame. A lot of time, effort and pre-planning has to go into issuing your orders. You also have to contact a lot of other players to ensure that you enjoy the game to the full. I would not recommend this game to a novice or beginner as they would find it too difficult. However, if you have played a few PBMs and are looking for a new challenge, then give it a try. It is easy to lead an army into battle, but could you ensure that battle gives you the foundations of an empire? Ageyptus gives you that chance to find out. The price for the rule book and set up package in Ageyptus is  however the prices for playing vary according to the political power you play.

But now he's at our mercy, and must answer all our questions, just like Arthur and Ford Prefect in the Vogon spaceship. We begin the interrogation ... C+VG: Douglas Adams didn't just spring to life with the Vogons and Earth's destruction. What type of things were you doing before HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy? D.A.: That's a timely question, because somebody found for me yesterday (actually last year) two short stories which I had done when I was 12. They were published in a comic called The Eagle, which I used to read as a kid. I was even paid some ten shillings for each story. Much later, I was in the Footlights Club at Cambridge, and just missed (by 10 and 15 years "


"E 75-respectively) John Cleese and Dudley Moore. But I did get a bit involved with Monty Python near the end of the series and a few bits of mine did make it on the air. C+VG: Did you work with any of the Python guys? D.A.: Graham Chapman and I did a pilot for a comedy featuring Ringo Starr, but it never got anywhere. I also helped Graham write some of his autobiography, but mostly I watched him drink a lot of gin. C+VG: But you did get involved with BBC television, didn't you? D.A.: Right. It was the 1978 season of Doctor Who, with Tom Baker as the Doctor. I did a number of scripts, like Pirate Planet and The City of Death. I was also the script editor the following year, and ghost-wrote a few more episodes. Doctor Who was a lot of fun. I mean, it wasn't super high budget by any means. Rocks would vibrate like jelly_there was just so much you could do with limited resources. Also, there was such a highshooting schedule that you ended up running as fast as you could just to stay behind. I think that the old black and white episodes worked better because the lighting was so much more interesting. Colour is a lot more destructive than an asset in sci-fi, because television lighting for colour makes everything too bright and baldly realistic. C+VG: Where do most of your ideas come from? D.A.: Hitch-Hiker's was really my first major thing, so a lifetime of ideas hanging around in the back of my mind wanted out real bad. It's a matter of being openminded, of knowing what you want to do. At the time, I wanted to write a sciencefiction comedy. Some things happen to you that are perfect to add to paper as well. C+VG: So the famous, or infamous, towel liturgy comes from real life? D.A.: Yes indeed. I was vacationing with friends in Greece some years back. Every morning they'd have to sit around and wait for me because I couldn't find my blessed towel. It seemed to epitomise my disorganised state of being. I came to feel that someone really together, one who was well organised, would always know where his towel was. I thought of it as a Universal Truth. C+VG: Did you map out solutions to all the problems Arthur would get into beforehand? D.A.: Not at all. Writing has to take the writer, as well as the reader, by surprise. When I had Arthur and Ford jettisoned into space, wellthat seemed to be the end of it all right there. I racked my brains trying to find a way to rescue them without \"with one bound, Jack was free\" entering all. Then I remembered a TV show on Judo I had seen. A small man can toss a heavier opponent because he's using the other's weight against him. So here I was with the problem that any solution I used would be highly improbable. So, make improbability the solution, and it leads you on into other things. Thus creating the Infinite Improbability Drive. C+VG: What did you enjoy most in writing the Hitch-Hiker books? D.A.: Being able to bring together the meeting between the utterly ordinary and mundane, and the utterly extraordinary. C+VG: Are you going to continue the trilogy? D.A.: No, absolutely not. I've a new book coming out, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detection Agency. Now all those chat show hosts will have to come up with some new questions. C+VG: Speaking of new works, will we have better luck asking about your new interactive text game, Bureaucracy. D.A.: Definitely. This is an exercise in the assault of red-tape, of small minds and vast horrors. Of being catapulted into appalling adventures and catastrophes. Repetition after repetition after repetition. Insane/inane situations which just get progressively worse the more you try to sort them out. (As if to illustrate the point of meaningless redundancy, everyone dons Douglas Adams' masks. Adams declines, noting that he: \"Already has one on.\") C+VG: What happens? D.A.: Moving day is over. You've just settled into your new house, and will shortly be starting a brand-new job. The company is going to fly you to Paris for a combination training seminar and vacation. It all sounds great, but there's a small hitch in that your bank won't accept the fact that you've moved. What happens next is bureaucracy at its finest. I shan't give too much away, but can you believe that the ultimate objective is to get the bank to acknowledge your change of address?! I 13 10 2 "

"Stephen King is the world's top horror writer. In his latest book, Eyes of the Dragon, King has turned his hand to fantasy with instant success. John Gilbert, whose own horror novel, The Devil's Children, is due to be published late next year, looks at King's career and his future plans. King King, like other authors, writes about what interests him, but as new novels were published — Salem's Lot and The Shining it became evident, even to his agent, that he was bringing horror out of the closet and making it his own. He swiftly became worried he would be stuck with the genre curse but the critics who were willing to read past the first page of his novels, as well tephen King, undoubtedly the world's greatest living horror writer, is about to make history. Within the next 14 months he will publish four novels, none of them straight horror, continuing on the incredible path which is taking him away from the gore field and into other areas where critics and new readers are finding that there's more to Stephen King than boogeymen in the closet and giant, goblin-fronted trucks which mow down their hapless drivers. King, who celebrates his 40th birthday in September, has the loping stance of a bear furthered by a prolific beard, which he cultivates during winter, but countered with kindly disposition and the humour. He's already published 15 novels under his own name, had films made of eight of those, as well as having his novella The Mist turned into an American radio play and home computer game. He admits that, although more than 200 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide, he would have taken longer to get his first novel published if it hadn't been for his wife, Tabitha, who is also a novelist with a high profile in the US. In 1972 he started work on short story about a girl with the psychic power to move objects. At that time he was living in a mobile home in Hampden, which is in Maine, New England, and working as a part-time teacher. He worked himself into depression and began to believe that he'd never make it as a writer despite the piles of short stories, some of which he'd published, and four novels he had written. Carrie, half completed, went into the bin but Tabby rescued and read it. She convinced him to complete the manuscript, which grew into a short novel, and submit it to US hardback publisher Doubleday. It was accepted and King received a royalty of $2,500. He was happy but almost had a seizure when Doubleday announced that the paperback rights had gone to New American Library for a staggering $400,000. King bought his wife a present to celebrate, a hairdryer, and gave up teaching to write full-time. narrative in his work. How do you follow the rampant success of a book — not to forget Brian de Palma's film -like Carrie? In 1974 King played around with the idea that a small town, lost amongst the New England countryside, could become prey to a vampire. The townsfolk could just disappear and, like the Marie Celeste, no one would know why. King's agent wasn't enamoured with the idea because it was another horror novel but he started the novel, called Second Coming, which when published was retitled 'Salem's Lot. When 'Salem's Lot was published King was already working on his next novel, a book about the Patty Hearst kidnapping called The House on Value Street which eventually went on to become called The Stand. His plans underwent a dramatic change when he stayed at a rambling hotel, called The Stanley's in a little out of the way place called Estes Park. It was about to shut up after a frantic summer season and everybody was leaving, the hotel was nearly deserted. The Value Street novel changed course, and a new novel sprang up, its central character a boy with the ability to \"shine\", a power to see future events, trapped with a psychotic father and ineffective mother in a snow-bound, haunted hotel. King named the novel The Shine. seller lists as soon as Stephen King's name was put on the covers. US capital cities. So, the title of book and film became The Shining. During the year in which The Shining was published a new author crept into the public eye. Richard Bachman's first novel, called Rage, drew little attention from the critics and modest paperback sales. It concerns a college student who wants revenge on life, the universe and the educational system and goes to fatal lengths to get it. Bachman's books — of which five are still in print received little publicity but the author made a slip when he published a slim novel called Thinner, about a lawyer under a gypsy slimming curse. It received a lot of publicity, it was Richard Bachman's greatest novel yet, and it was his downfall. His publisher, New American Library, announced that he had died of cancer. Shortly after Stephen King, under constant pressure from fans, admitted that Richard Bachman was his pseudonym. He had adopted the pen name in order to get away from Stephen King who then was expected to write a certain kind of fiction but, despite the lack of horror in four of the books, most of them made the US best INTO THE FIRE The movie rights to The Shine went before the book was published. Warner Brothers wanted Stanley -2001 Kubrick to direct with Jack Prizzi's Honour Nicholson in the starring role as the failed teacher and drunken, homicidal, father. Everything seemed fine, but Warner's wanted to change the title. He has already escaped attempts to change the title of the TV mini series based on 'Salem's Lotto As Maine Goes. So Goes The Nation, but he understood the reasoning. One of the major characters in the book is a black chef called O'Halloran. The film company was worried because Shine was a pre-war racial taunt dating back to when black shoe shine boys worked the streets of OUT OF THE CLOSET When Carrie was published King had no intentions of becoming a horror writer. There's a maxim in the writing business that genre books — science fiction, LET'S BOOGY MAN While Bachman boiled away King got on with the business of being Mr Best Seller under his own name with a string of books including The Dead Zone, Cujo and two short story collections. He also wrote two massive novels, The Stand and IT, and collaborated with Ghost Story author Peter Straub on a fantasy called The Talisman. The Stand, a sombre and sometimes brutal tale of Armageddon not by nuclear holocaust but by a flu virus called Captain Trips, was the first to see publication. The original manuscript was cut substantially by the publishers but an uncut version, around 1,000 pages will be published now that some copyright problems have been sorted out with Doubleday, King's first US publisher. The 3,000 to 100,000 copies, while mainstream fiction, which contains a little of everything to interest everybody, can sell up to a million copies or more. "

"blown to bits. That'll teach you to examine everything carefully! Never mind, you DID make a ram save, didn't you? The obvious place to head is Joe's Diner, to pick up the trail. After a little difficulty with a wire mesh, you get your first real lead, amidst the grease and grime of this dubious establishment. Now it's off again in the car, and behind a pink door you meet Ben, and find another clue. But what about the rendezvous you were supposed to keep? And so on SUPPLIER: PIRHANA SOFTWARE/DELTA 4 MACHINE: SPECTRUM, COMMODORE 64/128, AMSTRAD CPC PRICE: .95 REVIEWER: KEITH THE Hot on the heels of CRL's Murder Off Miami, comes another American detective adventure from Fergus McNeill, this time published by Pirhana. And the two games could hardly be more different. Fergus stresses that this one is a Delta 4 product, whereas Miami wasn't, although what that means in practice is probably only of interest to the taxman! Regardless of that, it can safely be said that Fergus is back on form, with this parody of the great American Private Eye, or Private Dick, as he is referred to (of course!) in the adventure. Slummy office full of dog ends, containing trendy Private Dick's mac hanging on coatstand, and a rather strange safe. As you are contemplating your new surroundings, SHE arrives at the office, casts a shapely silhouette on the frosted glass panel of the office door, and kicks it in. Her father has made good to the tune of a million, but has failed to turn up to a celebratory reunion at Joe's Diner. She'd waited a fortnight, but no sign of Dad. Is there foul play behind it? Of course you'll take the case. With no more ado you set off in your old heap of a car. Babies cry, interest rates fluctuate, Clive Sinclair launches a non-standard Maltese Falcon, and you get The Big Sleaze is a Quilled adventure, and in true Fergus style, there is plenty of humorous text. I found that the jokes stand up better than in anything he has done before, and the narrative suits the subject well. It rather put me in mind of a fictional 'eye' I used to read Glenn Bowman was his name, Hartley Howard his author. There are a few graphics, fast and not too boring, and you get the choice of saving to tape, disk, or ram. The game comes in three parts, on cassette. Detective stories are a natural for the adventure format, and adventure players should be well suited to solving them. Every adventurer has (or should have) a keen eye for spotting clues and making deductions it's all part of the game. Here is a game that is not too difficult, the vocabulary is less fussy than any other Delta 4 adventure, and I rate it as Fergus' best to date. If you enjoy a bit of sleuthing American style, then do it with a smile on your face, with The Big Sleaze.  VOCABULARY ATMOSPHERE PERSONAL  VALUE 00 00 00 00 "

This she did and after a highly successful tour they received recording offers from labels and producers. Ann finally chose Mikey Davies to produce this album and he has a pedigree that can boast the likes of producing the likes of Ted Nugent and Kiss. So there you have the sad story of Ann Boleyn and Hellicon. I would like to say the album is great, but the fact is that they are just another run of the mill rock and roll band. They give 110% effort, but I'm afraid it just doesn't click. Ann never gives her vocals a real chance. Half the time she ends up sounding like a watered down version of her ex-promoter, Ronnie Dio. The rest of the band are quite competent, but the songs are musically shallow and the lyrics are, at times, downright over the top, even by heavy metal standards. I'm afraid they will have to produce better quality stuff than this middle of the road drivel to impress the likes of me and, I suspect, you.

"Seat OL REGGAE VOLUME 1 VOMOTO: AF A Leat of MOHLI REGGAE lieat of WILD FRONTIER ARTIST: GARY MOORE LABEL: TEN RECORDS (CDIX 56) As we all known Gary Moore was a great friend of the late Phil Lynott and played for various periods of time with Thin Lizzy. Gary has dedicated this whole album to Phil and it shows. Nearly all the songs are really Lynott/Lizzy orientated and half the time I found myself imagining what they would be like if Phil was alive to sing them now, as they would have suited his vocal style to a tee. Of course, the music is of the highest quality, with Gary pulling out all the stops with his guitar style and singing. If I have one gripe about this album it is a small one. I would have rather seen a couple of new tracks added to the album instead of having BOTH seven and 12inch versions of Over the Hills and Far Away and Wild Frontier.

"WHAT'S THAT HAUNTING, EERIE, SCRAPING NOISE?? Dont worry it's you and' you are the ..... After a million long year's evolution the inevitable consequences of genetic engineering has materialised to haunt the galaxies, to terrorise the star systems and the beings that exist upon them. A race of Masters so feared that stories of their awesome powers are legend and the tales of havoc that they commit from the grotesque starship in which they collect galactic specimens, strike fear into the bodies of all inhabitants of planets upon which this vessel of doom casts its evil shadow. Fear that is in all except one single, savage neoreptilian creature, that too has felt the cataclysmic tremors of evolution and exists as the only living example of the one remaining lifeform that has the strength and cunning to resist the domination of the Masters. Motivated by a sub conscious determination to perpetuate its tortuous existence the creature roams the labyrinthed depths of the space station seeking the hidden hibernation chambers in which the last remaining members of its  rebellious race lie in suspended animation. There can only be one objective in its miserable existence... the freeing of its companions and the ultimate destruction of the monsterous Masters.

"THE JAMES BOND DOSSIER MAKTAD As promised last month, C+VG now presents the second part of our exclusive James Bond Dossier on Domark's new game, The Living Daylights. We've got the latest screen shots, pictures from the new film and the inside information on 007's fantastic Aston Martin Vantage. Our word is our Bond. The Living Daylights is due for written from the same specification. I simultaneous release across all Add to that the blaze of publicity major formats. It will also be out on an that is about to be unleashed arcade machine. surrounding Timothy Dalton's debut as If all goes according to plan it will James Bond in The Living Daylights, probably be a world's first that a then you're going to have to skip the computer and arcade game have been planet to escape 007. JE GAME First Domark's game. Latest reports say that the programming of the game is progressing well. These are the latest screen shots from the Amstrad version. Bond is the character in the white shirt. The man near him is a defecting Russian agent called Koskov who 007 must protect. Lurking in the background are the bad guys intent on putting a few holes through Bond's nicely-pressed Saville Row shirt. Richard Naylor, designer of The Living Daylights, is at the time of writing on a secret mission to the United States to check up on the programming teams working on the Atari ST and Amiga versions. Latest reports indicate he's somewhere in the Salt Lake City area visiting Sculptured Software. The arcade machine version is also being produced in the US — using the Amiga board — by a Mastertronicowned company Arcadia. Last month's C+VG James Bond Dossier included a rough outline of what to expect in the game, the backgrounds of which will be taken from the film. There are ten levels in all with varying difficulties. Before each level Bond has the chance to choose a weapon from the laboratory of gadet master Q. But be quick. There's only five seconds to choose. There is a selection of weapons, from a ghetto-blaster rocket pack to a hand-held gun. The range varies from level to level, some even being able to be taken from one level to the next. Bond is about one-fifth of the height of the screen and one-fourth of the width, and is controlled by numerous movements of the joystick. His Gun controls consist of a joystick for directions, the fire button for shooting and a second button to select between controlling Bond and the gun sights. When the select button is pressed a red dot appears in the centre of the screen. At this point Bond stops, the dot can now be controlled around the screen. Bond will follow its movements with his gun arm. On pressing the fire button the gun will release a shot, if pressed quickly it will fire repeatedly. The gun has unlimited firepower! Level 1 — Gibraltar: Bond begins his adventure with a test of the defences on the island of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean. He must match his wits against the skills of the SAS armed only with a paint pellet gun. After all, it is only a mock battle, or is followed you and he has orders to kill! it?

The ever-faithful Aston Martin returns, this time it's the 160 Vantage Bond's hightech version suitably equipped with sophisticated, yet lethal, gadgets!

"XE THE JAMES BOND DOSSIERY Bratislava masterminding the defection of KGB General Koskov. Despite an attempt on his life by beautiful Czech cellist Kara, Koskov is eventually brought safely to London. Unfortunately, Koskov is abducted by Necros, a ruthless killer. 'M', suspecting the KGB, sends Bond to serve a termination warrant on General Pushkin, who is known to be in Tangiers with a Trade Delegation. Before doing this Bond decides to return to Bratislava to try to get closer to the beautiful Kara. This he does and discovers that Kara is an innocent victim of the Russian general. He also learns of Koskov's involvement with International Arms Dealer Brad Whittaker. In true 007 style, Kara is rescued and taken to Vienna where she succumbs to the Bond charm. Bond, together with Kara, move on to Tangiers where Bond eventually confronts General Pushkin in his hotel. They plan together to trap Koskov and Whittaker. Bond and Kara are taken prisoner by Koskov and flown to Russianoccupied Afghanistan, but it is not long before Bond breaks free with Kara and Kamran Shah, the leader of a group of Afghan freedom fighters. Together they find out what Koskov and Whittaker are up to smuggling raw opium. It is obvious that they must be stopped, so with the support of Kamran's rebel group they overcome masses of Koskov's troops and allies in an attempt to prevent the opium leaving the country. The final mopping up is at Whittaker's Tangiers villa. BOND'S GAR Bond's cars are always scene-stealers and his Aston Martin 160 Vantage will be no exception. C+VG visited Pinewood film studios to take a look at this mean machine. It can accelerate from 0 to 60mph in six seconds. And that's not all. It is equipped with two missiles at the front, laser beams in all four hub caps they rip into enemy cars that come a little too close a jet booster to give it more zip than a jet fighter, out rigger skis and spiked tyres to get a grip on ice and snow. The Bondmobile will be setting off on a world tour soon to promote the film. * B549 TUU "

Apart from sit-in racing games where you feel a part of the machine, this is the first time the atmosphere and sheer addictiveness of a shoot 'em up has transported me to another planet. Alien Syndrome is fantastic. Play it if you dare!

MONTY In an age in which honour was revered, from a time when grace and beauty were virtues, a class of warriors set themselves apart to dedicate their lives to a perfection in combat that in itself was an artform, to a discipline of mind that became a religion. The attaining of such excellence required an extraordinary diligence in self-denial and training in order to achieve the ultimate accolade War Lord'. Kendo, Karate and finally Samurai are the tests that must be mastered before such honour can be bestowed. Monty the Mole is still on the run on his most exciting and exacting journey to date, a whistle stop tour of the capitals of Europe, acquiring more than just the local scenery on the way.

"1.D.E.A.S All right you lot — what's happened to all the hints, tips and pokes. Could it be that it's that dreaded time of the year when exams are looming or could it be that you are still drooling over my poster. Then again it could be that you are just too darn lazy. Well, whatever the excuse, I am not happy! Do you think I enjoy getting loads of letters saying \"you never print any hints, etc for MY computer\". What do you want me to do — make them up. So please, please inundate me with letters and I can pay you for info. Send them to me Melissa Ravenflame, I.C. NETHER EARTH GENERAL HINTS Nuclear weapons-generally it is not worth using these to destroy enemy warbases or factories. However, they are extremely useful for clearing obstructing walls, such as those on the approach to the warbases. Build a small robot, such as those on the approach to the warbases. Build a small robot, armed only with a bomb and advance on the obstruction. Retreat all robots at least five miles, then manually detonate to destroy the wall. Robot Combat when manually controlling your robot use combat mode which will give you quick access to its weapons. In combat let your enemy come to you. Try to stay on the edges of the screen or behind full blocks to restrict the angles you can be attacked from. Try to deal with one enemy at a time and above all, do not stray into another robot's field of fire. HAMELEONG Settle down for some pretty moving forward when a complex hints from Edward convenient gap appears. Occupy Hartnell of Swansea.

When Build a few lightly armed, fast the heli-pad appears land on it moving robots to capture nearby and construct more battle robots. factories. You will need no more Order about a third to capture than two or three such robots, enemy factories and the rest to equipped with cannon and tracker destroy robots. Now retreat and or, preferably, anti-grav chassis manually guide out any robots units. Send one ahead and leave stuck in the maze-like approach to the other to capture the nearby Tarras. Again build as many neutral factories. Taking manual robots as your resources allow control of the advanced robot, use and order these to destroy enemy it to capture neutral and enemy robots. factories, as well as terminating Once this section has been enemy robots. Once well cleared take control of one of the equipped enemy robots begin to foremost robots. Advance slowly, appear take up a defensive firing constantly and clear the area position and try and hold off the of enemy robots. Then occupy Insignians for as long as possible. and hold the entrance to Faretra When this robot is finally Warbase until the heli-pad destroyed retreat to Kerberus and appears. Build more robots with with you accumulated resources the same orders as before. Now build battle robots. The best such direct any stuck robots through to robots consist of an anti-grav Faretra. By now the Insignians propulsion unit allied with should control only a handful of missiles, phasers and an robots. Build robots as before. But electronic support module. Never with the addition of nuclear economise on the chassis, since bombs. Order the robots to seek the speed with which a robot can and destroy the enemy robots .... turn to face an adversary is just as advance and take control of a important as the strength of its battle robot. Use this to eliminate weapon systems. Generally the the remaining Insignian robots. larger the amount of resource Now you have two choices. You points spent on a robot the more can either use this robot to cost-effective it will be. capture the final Insignian Order your robots to search and Warbase or you can use a destroy enemy robots.

"INTO THE EAGLE'S NEST HELP EE CU O D DEC LO BB EF C The game to get David Harvey's mapping talents going this month is Into the Eagle's Nest. Here are the first two levels with a few hints. As well as walking into doors, you can shoot them. The first aid kit reduces hits to zero and the food to ten. Only shoot the chest once, as there might be dynamite in it. Try to stand behind something and edge out gently — you can now blast them. To get the prisoner out of your way, shoot him in the direction you want to do in. Look out for the next two levels in I.C. next month. 11 OOOOOO Melvyn Jones of South Yorkshire bought Tarzan for the Amstrad 464 and after a couple of days was horrified to find out that Tarzan can't get over the long piece of quick sandeven though there is a swing! Can anyone help before he cracks up? Another frustrated Amstrad owner is Michael O'Sullivan of London. His problem is with Ghosts 'n' Goblins he can't pass the goblin on the first level. Peter Leung of Luton is a C16 owner who is having problems with Airwolf. He feels you don't have many lives and there are too many objects flying about. Anyone have any pokes for Peter.

"HRSCORE TITE 000000 SCORE:008500 BY DAVID PERRY inthip GREAT GURIANOS is this good value for money or what? Three games for the price of one from C+VG's Software House of the Year. Elite. And they aren't just any old games either. You get a coin-op conversion, the sequel to one of Elite's best sellers, plus an entirely original game all in one highly playable package. We're talking about the arcade combat game Great Guryanos, Airwolf Il plus 3DC on the Speccy and Amstrad and a neat bouncing ball type game called Cataball on the 64. Great Guryanos is a scrolling combat game in the Rygar mode although the coin-op original appeared light years ago. The computer version features large cartoon style characters and lots of armed conflict. 3DC is an isometric arcade adventure set underwater. Your diving-suited hero has to rebuild a lost submarine while battling creatures of the deep. Airwolf Il features that world famous helicopter on a new mission which owes a lot to Salamander and Nemesis. An addictive shoot 'em up with lots of neat frills. Cataball is another addictive and different offering. You guide four bouncing balls across various landscapes in a quest for lost balloons. Sounds silly but it's extremely playable. You can lose your balls --if you'll pardon the expression one by one as you encounter different hazards. Each game could be released as a full price game but it's nice to see Elite thinking about your pockets and offering this bumper bundle as a compilation. All cassette versions of the game will set you back .95 while disk owners will have to fork out .95. In your shops in July.

The survivors withdrew to underground complexes, and now, after years of dedicated research, they have produced an android, Cyborg 64, who may provide the answer to their prayers. The problem is that a race of unusual aliens has populated the earth and are less than keen to relinquish their newly found homestead. Alien Evolution is played from a 3D prespective, looking down at the plant, and features tranporters to zap you from area to area. Monochrome graphics and full scolling are also included. Meanwhile, here's a look at Gremlin's The Final Matrix out soon on Spectrum, MSX (.99), and Amstrad (.99) Nimrod is a member of a friendly race called the Bioptons, a mechanical people who are very friendly and fond of socialising. During an outing hostile Cratons abducted a party of Bioptons, and scattered them across the galaxy on their matrix network of space prisons. Bioptons have delegated the rescue of their countrymen to Nimrod! It's impossible for Nimrod to land his craft on the matrix, his only option is to actually land himself and retrieve the hostages individually. Nimrod has an added handicap no one really knows where each matrix is or even how many there are. His quest begins in a Bioton spacecraft fitted with the Bioton's most advanced navigational aid the Pentavision. Using the display monitor, he can locate each matrix and manoeuvre his ship into the correct position to land. Once on a matrix the fun beings!

"da Monster esly Walker. ZATAMash! \"20 W Typ it's possible we did find something in the deep murky waters of Loch Ness? If the stories we heard from the locals is anything to go by, I think we did! OPERATION NESSIE HUNT began in earnest on Saturday 2nd May when the three prize winners went along to the Loch Ness Centre at Drumnadrochit to receive the first half of their prizes. The winners were Suraj Tanna, 11 from Lodon, Marti Taylor, 13, from Essex and Derek McCall, 14, of Sauchie and you can see them here staggering under the weight of their goodies. Sunday was the big day when they had a trip out on the New Atlantis to do a sonar search of the Loch. Everyone got a chance to steer the boat (and guess who couldn't steer!) and the boys then did some tracking with the radar and picked up an object at a depth of 50m. Adrian Shine and David Martin of the investigation team are presently looking into the reading as most fish don't go any deeper than 30m.

"Bee -Bouncy Bouncy GREMLIN GRAPHICS GREMLIN GRAPHICS *THING BOUNCES BACK OM SPECTRUM.CBM: AMSTRAR GVG COMPETITION C-VG Zing will go the strings of your heart as Thing springs back into action. Yes, Gremlin's coiled character is about to leap back into action in Thing Bounces Back. And we've got 50 copies of the game to give away to the winners of our hunt the Gremlin game competition. But first more about the game. Remember Thing on a Spring? Well in that Thing had to deal with the toy goblin who was turning out monstrous and hideous toys from his underground factory. Having defeated the goblin, Thing must finish the job and stop the factory auto-producing the toys. Thing must bounce round the factory complex in his search for software to aid him in his re-programming venture. He can alter the layout of the rooms through which he travels to suit his purposes, and has access to the factory pipe network. Thing travels though these pipes at breakneck speed to get from screen to screen. As always, our hero's life is not easy. Goblins lurk in every location, anxious to deplete Thing's oil stocks. If reduced by too much, or if Thing bumps his head too often, his spring seizes up. To be in with a chance of winning, just take a good look at the printed word square. Hidden in it are the names of five Gremlin games. Find them and send your answers to Thing Bounces Back Competition, Computer+Video Games, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London ECIR 3AU. The closing date is July 16th and the editor's decision is final.  -Address...

The game was not programmed by exactly the same people though, and it's as used in Intuition, you can easy to see. But, enough of this. easily move Sinbad throughout Here's the plot. this magical world of witches One day the Princess and genies.

Very handy. He says that to release the Caliph, Sinbad must collect three eyes from three sisters, and the wing of a demon. Not being the things you find in the local supermarket, this is going to be tough! Sinbad can ask various people questions, and by collating information together, he can try to understand the Shaman's needs. You find out the locations of the sisters by questioning the Caliph's ex-wife, Libitina. She has knowledge of the black arts, I will grant thee 3 wishes Next Wish Previous Wish OK! Go back to your lame; I will SUMMOn you later. you, but you only get the customary three wishes. So far this all sound impressive, but what about graphics and sound. Well, the graphics are not up to usual Amiga standard, but they are quite colourful. At certain points in the game, it gets really blocky, and I don't understand this at all. The lowest resolution is 320x200, which is the high-res on the 64, so why the chunks. The sound, however, is totally different. A fantastic 'Arabian Knights' soundtrack fits the game perfectly, and the sound effects are fab too. I particularly liked the misic when you get seduced, real heavy. amount of jewels collected.

"STARGLider AMIGA Special MACHINE. AMIGA SUPPLIER: RAINBIRD PRICE: $24.94 REVIEWER: CHRIS vector graphics, and digitised speech can only mean one thing ... And that's Starglider. The famous shoot-'em-up cum tactical game which first got the Atari ST noticed, has now, at last, arrived on the Amiga. Starglider, da, da, da, de, dum, do, dol Yeah, that famous 17 second tune, the colourful se 00000315 The game uses vector graphics, similar to those in Mercenary and Battlezone, although of a much higher quality Based around the accompanying novella, specially written by James Follet, Starglider is the story of Jaysan, and his attempt to destroy the Egrons' fleet. Who are the Egrons? Well they're a nasty bunch trying to destroy your planet, and of course, you can't have that. Flying your AGAV fighter in a manner similar to Skyfox, you will come across plenty of nasties to blow away. All displayed in lovely vectors and at this point you can do little else but marvel at what Jez San, the man responsible for this masterpiece, has achieved. The Walkers walk convincingly around the screen the Bute fighters dodge your laser blasts with amazing manoeuvres, and the Starglider flaps about in the most menacing way. All this, and not a flicker to be seen. Incredible! But enough about the graphics, let's get back to the game. Being a shoot-'em-to-bits, Starglider is instantly playable, but you will soon find yourself being shot down time and time again, unless you think about what your doing. Using the excellent novella, you must work out how to stay alive, refuel your ship and destroy the Egron flagship, Starglider One. Starglider One, the orange bird, is mean and extremely tough. She has only one weakpoint, and it is this which you must expose if you have any idea about saving Novenia. When entering the docking bay, you may be able to collect a missile. If this is possible, the screen will flash green and you will automatically have it. But, you can only carry two missiles at any one time. The amazing graphics are accompanied by superb sound, which has been dramatically altered since the original ST version. The game now features not only the original music, played whilst loading, but also a new stereo tune which is heard once the game has loaded. The sound effects have also been beefed up, and are now sampled, giving a lot more realism to explosions. The other vital ingredient which is of course the speech, courtersy of the lovely Miss Edgeley, has been made much clearer. So when you hear things such as 'Missile Launched' or 'Energy Low', it sounds as if Clare is right next to you. Plus, all sound is in stereo, for a quick example hook the Amiga to your hi-fi, and fire to the left or right of the screen. The sound comes from the corresponding speaker! The game also runs faster on the Amiga, which means you get faster lasers, and things don't slow down when there's a lot of action on the screen. Even the options have been increased, you now get to choose between normal and self-centring sights, and there are several settings for fixed sights. I must also mention that the game can now be played with a joystick, a special routine has been implemented which allows the stick to act like a 2-button mouse. When you finally have your lights put out, you receive a status sheet as to how well you performed. The sheet consists of accuracy, shots fired and generally gives you a rating. The ratings are Rookie, Poor (That's me!), Fair, Average, Above Average, Accurate, Deadly, Super Flyer, Ace Pilot, and finally Commander. I say finally, but there is one more rating. This is a very apt one for someone who scores this high. When you get good enough to enter your name in the score table, you have the option of saving it to disk. This wasn't included in the ST version, but it means that your friend's score stays there until you top it! Starglider just goes to prove what I've always said about Rainbird, they are in the elite of software houses and are constantly turning out new and original material. I also think they were lucky to find Jez, who has to be one of the best Amiga programmers around. He has taken the machine further than anyone else to produce what I call a true Amiga game. All that can be said now is three cheers for Rainbird, three cheers for Jez. leee2000 3940  GRAPHICS SOUND  VALUE PLAYABILITY C+VG HIT! oso "


"Silent SERVICE MACHINE: COMMODORE/ AMIGA/C64/ST/800XL SUPPLIER: MICROPROSE PRICE: .95 VERSION TESTED: AMIGA REVIEWER: CHRIS Snar reports distant explosions. Hmmm. Ok, up periscope and give me bow torpedoes one and two. Were going put this sucker under once and for all. Hold her steady... FIRE! ... and another goes to meet Davy Jones. That could have been a scene from a John Wayne epic, but it was actually a true experience from Silent Service. What's the Silent Service? Well it's what the Americans used to call the people who fought in submaries, those relentless old sea dogs who went up against the Japanese accompanying documentation, When you start, you can choose what sort of thing you'd like to try. There's Torpedo practice, Convoy actions and the main one, War Patrols. Each section is well presented and can be made extremely difficult, depending on the reality levels. The reality levels are just one of the special features making the game very playable indeed. But what do they do? Well, one of the options is visibility, another Dud Torpedoes. If you set visibility to limited, you can only see enemy targets in your area. This is more realistic than knowing where they are all the time, and as for dud torpedoes it speaks for itself. Once you've completed several Convoys, you should attempt a war patrol. This involves following one of the accompanying maps, and patrolling the waters for Japanese war fleets. The maps are vital as they show the path taken by various types of enemy craft, and they also enhance the excitement. When playing the game, you use various Battlestations screens, which consist of a periscope, maps, a damage SIMULATION SUSPENDED Study HAPS . C DEP navy. SPD 18 8 HD658 And, it's also the name of this truly wonderful simulation game, by those clever Microprose people. The simulation enables the player to become a WWII US sub Capt., and to fight some of the deadly battles that went on at that time. Unlike most simulations I've come across, SS is very easy to operate. It's icon controlled, and although very complex, is explained very clearly in the screen, a dial and a gauges screen and of course the bridge. The bridge is the least important really, but where would you be without a periscope. Once you've found the enemy, you will wish to give him an early retirement. When he is in range you can do this with either Torpedoes, the main weapon, or a four inch deck gun which is used for destroying already damaged craft. Silent Service is extremely playable and fun, whilst giving an accurate account of submarine warfare, a must for every simulation addict. Gunship, another excellent simulation, is being converted at this very mo, and I can't wait.  GRAPHICS SOUND  VALUE PLAYABILITY C+VG HIT! OOOO HACKER MACHINE: AMIGA SUPPLIER: ACTIVISION PRICE: $24.99 REVIEWER. CHRIS The Hacker series just goes to prove what I've always said about Yanks, they can't do anything by themselves. Once again, the amazing 'know it all' American CIA need your help, and you're just an ordinary guy, or gal. This time, they interrupt you whilst you're browsing through the latest on-line software chart, and beg you to help them. It seems the Russians (surprise, surprise) have some kind of notebook which contains the stuff that brings countries, worlds and galaxies to their knees. Of course the papers are guarded in a maximum security building in Siberia, which isn't the world's hottest tourist spot. Using a US satellite, you can get into the complex with your micro, and consequently control a droid which the Americans have managed to sneak in. Using your micro, you have managed to tap into a security camera, and you are able to use this to look around. There are other cameras about, but you have no control over them. But you may jam their signal, and run a pre-recorded tape past them, so you can step in front without being squealed on. Doing this takes care, and you must match the camera signal time with the video exactly, otherwise you will be detected. When you are detected, the Russians send out a thing called the 'Annihilator'. You have probably guessed what this does. But it does it in a most humorous way, mashing your MRU over the head. The sound effects here are great, listen out. So, we've got four displays on the screen, three cameras, and the fourth is the TGS.

It is called Killer Rings and comes from Tony Crowther. It runs on the Commodore 64 and is due soon on a budget label from Airolasoft. . Like most good shoot-'emups, it is nice and simple, you annihilate everything that moves. The title screen has three options, sound (either spot sound effect or background music), easy or hard levels and the choice to play from keyboard by defining your own keys. Forget the background effects just leave the music on!! It is really funky stuff, and rates as one of the best bits of 'thumpy, thumpy take 'em out tunes I have EVER heard. On playing the game you are faced with a rotating metallic gyroscope and you zipping around the screen. On level three you get metallic log rolls to shoot and they are protected on their sides by little shields, so accurate shooting is in order. Levels five and six have you facing the same fat, ugly flies again but they are more colourful and a chain of bouncing balls that loop around the top row of the screen regenerating the flies you kill. Level seven has you facing that old brute the Mothership and you have to shoot a passageway into its hold to destroy it. As in the Phoenix tradition the mothership releases hordes of flies to keep you on the move and away from shooting her. Lots of colour, blow away action and some really groovy, groovy music to zap along to make this a budget offering you cannot miss 16. Killer Rings can move this around the around you, teasing you to go bottom half of the screen for them. They also drop lethal spewing out death lasers up bombs on you and contact is and down the screen. Above fatal — you lose one of your fatal you lose one of your you there are fat, squat, hairy four lives. looking flies walking across the Your laser can shoot the flies screen. and the bombs they drop on The flies peel off from the you.
