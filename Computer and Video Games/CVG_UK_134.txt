"WORD UP! as he gone yet? He has? HELLOOO! Welcome to the Christmas issue of CVG! And guess what? Boone has shuffled off this mortal mag and gone to join the great Nintendo lot in the sky! Well, the fourth floor at least, where our man Timmy's the new editor of Nintendo Magazine System. Good luck to him and we hope those pieces of silver are safely tucked away! In the meantime, your host with the most is your very own North-Eastern person, and myself and the boys have pulled out all the stops to bring you an issue which can only be described as 'Very Good Indeed'. As you've doubtless already noticed on the front cover, we've been out and grabbed the Exclusive Review of the incredible Megadrive version of Another World check that out NOW! Are you back? Looks the business, doesn't it! Not only that, we've got Desert Strike on Super Nintendo, a sneaky peek at one of the most incredible simulations ever seen oh yes, the CVG Challenge makes a more-than-welcome return this month, too!

STREETFIGHTER ENVELOPE WINNERS! NAIL ORDER You might have noticed, scattered throughout the pages of this fine tome, a little CVG rosette attached to some of the mail order ads in the last few issues of the magazine. Want to know what it is? That's the CVG Recommendation, and it's basically there to let you know which of the stacks of mailorder boys have a consistant track record of good service and reliability so you know where to go if you're after a good deal! CECOMIENDS There's only one word to describe the amount of entries to this competition UNBELIEVABLE! Sackfuls of mail flooded into the offices for a month, and poor old Rob wasn't happy that he had to sort through all of it! But sort through he did, and we picked out the ten winners, who each receive a Super Nintendo Streetfighter 2 pack! The lucky ten are: PHILIP KEMPINSKI, LONDON SW17; WAI SING MAN, COWLEY, MIDDX; ANTONY WILLIAMS, SCUNTHORPE; CLARE-MARIE POWELL, LEICESTER; THOMAS JOHNS, SOUTHAMPTON; DANNY HUDSON, LOUGHBOROUGH; RASHED KHANDKER, BIRMINGHAM; AIDAN MINTER, PITSEA, ESSEX; PHILIP BAKER, CHESTERFIELD; JAMES WHITTAKER, SCARBOROUGH. STOP WHINGING, SOFTIES! Just a couple of quick 'Oops'es before the software companies phone up and have a go! Firstly, X-Wing should have been attributed to US Gold last ish, as they're distributing the game in Europe; also, the Brummie boys reck-ON that Flashback, which they're putting out on Megadrive, isn't an actual sequel to Another World but it looks tops, so who cares? On the subject of Another World, Interplay have decided not to call their SNES version Out Of This World, plumping instead for the original title. Hurrah! You spawny gets!

"IT'S GOT THE LOT These amazing machines can't be touched for mind-blowing games. Graphics and sound capabilities are unrivalled, with more and more PC games using digitised graphics and stunning video animation such as the soon-to-be-released X-Wing and Comanche Maximum Overkill (which we give you a complete lowdown on this very ish!). Amstrad have even left room for the Mega CD to plug into the hardware too! The MegaPC sounds a dream come true for everyone wanting all the fun of the Megadrive and the pure power of a PC. But it doesn't come cheap the package weighs in at a hefty  so get saving those pennies NOW! NEWS CONSOLE AND PC IT'S MEGA! indy monte carlo casino 00000 50 sophia WHAT A LOT YOU GET! One of the most frequentUly-asked questions we get posed at CVG is 'Which machine should I buy? A SNES, an Amiga, a PC or a Megadrive?' Those really smart geezers at Amstrad have come up with an amazing piece of kit that will go a long way to making that allimportant hardware purchasing decision a teensy bit easier! In an amazing deal secured with Sega, the keyboard boys have managed to secure a contract that has allowed them to manufacturer Sega Megadrives in this country! But that's not all the new machines will not come out alone; they'll be bolted lock, stock and barrel to the innards of a whopping great PC! If all that tech spec has freaked you out, just take it from us that the Mega PC is one awesome collection of hardware. It's loaded with innovative features, including an interactive tutorial package that will lead you by the hand through all the PCs functions and complex words. You discover what each function and key does by clicking on the screen and revealing the explanations as the tutorial runs in front of your eyes. Once you've got into the swing of things and start using your computer you can leave the beast to run an application or programme whilst you thwack away on a Sega cartridge by simply sliding over the panel at the front and automatically activating the Megadrive console. Just insert a cartridge and go with all your favourite blasting games. Then, when you've finished, you can switch back-the PC will have completed the task you began and awaits your next instruction. The brand new machine will be called the MegaPC and is a direct stab at grabbing the purse strings of parents who want their children to be in possession of a games machine that will stand the test of time. The complete package has not been decided yet, but what you're certain to get is the Megadrive and 386PC in its slim-line housing, an Ad-lib sound card for incredible audio effects above that of normal consoles, an analogue joystick, Megadrive joypad, stereo monitor with in-built surround speakers and VGA graphics capabilities, a complete MS DOS tutorial programme to teach you every aspect of PC use, a mouse, keyboard, a stack of PC and Megadrive games, 1Mb of RAM and a 40MB hard drive! S URGIU Just as we were about to go to press and go home, something happened which made us totally change this page to get the following info into the mag! This is not at all solid news, but strong rumours have reached CVG of a BRAND NEW VERSION OF STREETFIGHTER! Apparently, this new Super Nintendo game isn't a pirate, is being produced by Capcom themselves, and goes under the name of Streetfighter Turbo! So what's the difference between the two? From what we've been told, not only are the graphics even better a feat in itself but all the characters now have new moves and, most importantly, WEAPONS! As we say, this could be a load of old tosh but it has come from a major source in the console industry. Rest assured, we'll keep you well informed of any further developments! CVG 010 "

"NEWS GUESS WHO? SEGA STORM HAMLEYS The BBC may have given up on the good Doctor and his time-travelling antics, but Alternative Software haven't. They've picked up the rights to the time-lord, Tardis and all, and are busy putting the finishing touches to the Amiga and PC versions of the game. It takes the form of a platform shoot 'em up with the Doctor going up against the Daleks and their crazy, shrivelled leader, Davros. It should be out around now priced at .99, and looks to be better than the crap version of Dr Who which was out some time ago, and starred a robot cat because the publisher couldn't afford the K-9 license! FIGHTING CHANCE When you're down London way, no doubt you've popped into the world's biggest toy store, Hamleys, and mucked about with the variety of goodies stored therein. But it's a bit of an annoyance that there isn't banks of video games to play on, isn't it? Not any more! Hamleys have signed a deal with Sega to create the Metropolis. Located on the lower-ground floor, the Metropolis is a Sega-only arcade, filled with all their newest coin-ops and the R-360, Sega's awesome gyroscopic air-combat game. So when your little sister is playing with the Barbie dolls, you know where to go! Are you a Streetfighter sad-sack who's always being kicked around by your mates? Does the Dragon Punch elude you? Quickshot may just have come up with the solution to your problems the Topfighter. It's a six-button Super Nintendo stick designed to improve your Streetfighter prowess. Apart from the six buttons, its main feature is a programme mode which can store a whole series of moves in the stick's memory and are activated by the press of a button. So you can now confound your friends with lethal high-speed combina tions executed with just one finger! The Topfighter is available now, priced at  thirty quid cheaper than the Capcom stick, which doesn't have the smart macro-mode, so check it out! Hamleys CLEARLY A JOYPAD Ever wanted to see what's going on inside your SNES joy-pad while you're using it? Probably not, but in case you do, or just fancy a trendy looking gaming device, Quickshot have come up with the Pro Pad, a joy-pad made out of clear plastic. It has a twospeed auto-fire mode and a slow-motion button which pauses and restarts the game really fast to make it look like it's running in slow motion. TOP FICHTER STICK IT TO EM It may look more like a UFO, but take our word for it; this is the latest in a huge line of joypads to be released for the SNES. The JB-King features no less than 16 buttons which handle fast and super-fast auto firing, pause and slow motion. The tiny joy-stick fits right into the palm of your hand, making the JB-King one of the most accurate and comfortable sticks we've seen. AONAMI ATARI The low-price version of Atari's new wondermachine, the Falcon, has had its launch date put back, so it now looks likely to hit the shops in the new year. Atari have been banging on for ages about its new wonder machine and its price, but it turns out that the one megabyte 68030 will be beaten to the shelves by a more powerful 4Mb version which will retail at . One of the machine's main selling points is its betterthan-CD quality sound, which goes along with the built in microphone input and internal MIDI interface. The Falcon's enhanced graphics capabilities allow it to display 65,536 colours on screen at once, which is a marked improvement over the old STs. But at a price of nearly nine hundred sovs, the Falcon's going to have to go some way to grab the limelight from the Amiga 1200 at a stupidly low price of , Commodore's new addition to the Amiga family seems to have the lead. We'll keep an eye on what develops. KONAMI CVG 012 "


"GRAB A GAME Crumbs, those wacky Japs! The latest game-craze over in the Land Of The Rising Sun is Dragon Quest V, a new RPG along Zelda lines on the Super Famicom, where queues up to 3 miles long have appeared outside shops stocking the game. Apparently, this cart is so popular, ten muggings were reported on the first day of sales, as those unwilling to face the queues found a new way of procuring a copy. Lumme! PADDING IT OUT More pad heaven for SNES users comes in the form of an infrared system for the Super console! The handy gadget is the product of coin-op giants Konami and allows the user up to 25 feet of wireless control. The small dish plugs straight into the pad port on the SNES and can be positioned anywhere within a 70 degree angle of the pad. Wild! BRAND NEW MEGADRIVE ON THE WAY! There's a new Megadrive coming in the Spring! Don't blow a gasket yet, though this isn't the fabled Gigadrive. Instead it's going to be a redesigned version of the existing machine. The only alterations we know of will be a new slim-line case with the expansion port placed in such away that it will connect sideways-on to the Mega-CD rather than stacked. While we're on the subject of the Mega-CD, it now looks as though Sega are planning an Easter release; coincidentally, at the same time as the Megadrive 2. Word is also reaching us that the Mega-CD will also have undergone cosmetic changes by the time it's released. We'll bring you the info as and when. The time has come for you to flex those biceps and stand strong against the onslaught from the competition. See if you have got what it takes to become the ultimate World Warrior.

"FRUITY FUN INEWSFRUITY FUN From the totally bizarre Lemmings, Psygnosis have ventured further away from reality to find the star of their next game and found a tomato. The game is called Terry's Tomato Game and, funnily enough, stars Terry Tomato, who's in search of his kidnapped girlfriend, Tracy. There are 100 hazard-packed levels and the aim is to guide Terry through them by placing objects such as trampolines, fans and jack-in-the boxes in his path to bounce and blow him past the nasties that stand between him and his small, spherical love. Sounds positively, erm, tomatoey to us!! MICRO ON MEGA! Hot news! CVG's just had a sneak preview of the Megadrive version of that top NES game, Micro Machines, and while the gameplay remains unchanged, the graphics have undergone a face-lift and look fab. The glitches that dogged the NES version have gone and the sound is ace. Keep and eye out for a full Preview in a forthcoming issue! Yleese leave us ALONE SN Quogo TOPPIES NINTENDO IN HAND OF GOD SHOCK We've had Commodore sponsoring Chelsea FC, and Sega forking out for the European Championship and Cup. What next? The arrival of Diego Maradona, the striker who's \"handy' in the goal mouth, at Spanish club Seville has also heralded the arrival of a computer sponsor. The fans will now see their favourite team running around with 'Super Nintendo' emblazoned on their shirts. Who knows what's next Atari Lynx for Leyton Windgate? STREETFIGHTER 21 395905 KOI We're always being asked if there's going to be a Streetfighter 3, well hold on to your trousers, it already exists! Not only that but there are another seven different versions as well! While most of these coin-ops can only be found in Hong Kong, word has reached our shell-likes that Streetfighter: Champion of Champions Edition can be found in some British arcades. This version has loads of new features to tax the most experienced battlers. For a start it's a lot faster than the normal version, Ryu and Ken can now perform mid-air fireballs which can be curved across the screen. The Dragon Punch has been further improved, making it the deadliest move in the game; now you can perform a Dragon Punch on top of a Dragon Punch when the character is in midflight to smash high-flying characters like Vega. This new wave of Streetfighter games isn't just limited to coin-ops, either; there are now an incredible THIRTEEN versions of the game available for the Super Famicom! They feature such gems as a move which makes Blanka invisible and super-long distance hurricane kicks and Dragon Punches. But don't go trying to buy them; they're dodgy pirate versions of the original and Nintendo will probably come down on anyone possessing a copy like a ton of bricks! ARCADE ON A DISC CAUTION! AUSE While you're waiting for the really smart stuff to make an appearance on the Mega CD, the first of Sega's longpromised CD compilation discs is to make its debut in Japanese Mega-CD packs. The limited edition Classic Arcade Collection features perennial Megadrive favourites Golden Axe, Streets Of Rage, Revenge Of Shinobi and Columns crammed onto one disk, and if you're lucky you may be able to grab it from some mail order houses.

INSWISATO COMMANCHE AS EASY AS KGB The KGB don't take kindly to American helicopters buzzing around their supposedly secret bases, so you can expect them to react to your presence with attack helicopters of their own, as well as a variety of surface-toair missile launchers and tanks. Some missions just have your lone 'copter going up against 20 or more enemy vehicles, each one armed with missiles and machine guns, where your job is simply to avoid the waves of rockets and bullets and destroy everything in the area. Each mission requires its own set of tactics and battle plans; one scenario in particular requires you to steer your chopper down a narrow gorge to avoid a hail of rockets launched from enemy emplacements it happens so fast it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on. Each mission varies in setting and objectives one might require you to simply fly around, laying waste to everything you encounter, while another may contain orders not to disturb the enemy simply sneak up to them, get them in your sights then catch them unawares with an artillery strike. 1000 CHAFF:23 FLARE:30 MAE THRERTS TO CHAFT:00 FLARE:00 0004 INFO DAHIGEM HELLFIRE C F F CHAFF:00 FLARE:00 GVG 016 0009 HELLFIRE F10 F11 F12 "

"PIE REVIEW MEGADRIVE RACING SIM BY GREMLIN .99 The Formula One season may be at an end but that by no means signals the end of the racing thrills and spills for you lucky Megadrive owners. Courtesy of Electronic Arts comes the 16-bit Sega version of Gremlin Graphics' most popular racer to date Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge. You get to take control of one of the curvaceous cruise mobiles and fly around a load of different tracks, trying to reach the finish line before your time limit expires. But it's not as easy as that there are stacks of other cars filling up the freeway, attempting to do exactly the same. That said, the Lotus is one of the nippiest cars this side of Monaco, so jump in and let's have less of that claiming you were bumped off the track nonsense. E S P R TT TURBO CHALLENGE Earl Could do better TRACK ATTACK We all had pretty high aspirations for Lotus, but mine were very quickly dashed when I plugged in a switched on. Badly drawn and blocky cars, wobbling around a slow and flat landscape more commonly known as a road, isn't my idea of graphical excellence. The sad sound effects grate their way out of the Megadrive with no real likeness to a Ford Fiesta, never mind a Lotus Esprit Turbo. Then the gameplay just completely breaks this game's spine clean in two! It's so dull; the car moves so slowly that you'd think you were controlling one of those kiddies' dodgem cars rather than a top of the range Lotus. The game isn't particularly difficult at all and it won't take long to get very bored with, as I found out. The two-player mode does little to save the game if anything, it's less exciting than the one player mode because it runs slower. A poor example of the driving genre. CVG 018 PAUL ANGLIN The tracks in Lotus Turbo Esprit Challenge work in a similar fashion to those in the oldie but goodie coin-op, Out Run. You've got a massive long stretch of track with countless different checkpoints along it, and extra seconds are added to your timer each time you drive through a checkpoint. The tracks are very long and many-a-time will you scream in agony as your car stops inches away from the checkpoint as your timer lurches to zero, but hey that's motor racing for you. Driving through a puddle will cause your car to skid. "

SPLIT-SCREEN SHENANIGANS ZOOMIN' AROUND If you're smart enough to own two Megadrive joypads and you've got a chum willing to indulge in some double-driving antics, you can select two-player Lotus and indulge in a whole new way of playing. The Megadrive gives you a The Lotus games first started life on split screen view of the proceedings, with one player at the top and one at the Amiga many a moon ago under the bottom. This makes racing far more competitive as you can see your pal the name Lotus Turbo Esprit chalzoom past you, leaving a trail of dust. But if you're really that bad you can lenge. This was hugely successful always assure victory by unplugging his pad! ultimately proving to be one of Gremlin's biggest titles. The sequel, Lotus Turbo Challenge II, meant the hire of another garden rake to bring in all the cash made from sales. Then not too long ago came Lotus 3. This blew all the others away and the garden rake was done away with and replaced by a large hoover. This isn't the first computer-to-console translation of the game, though. It appeared under the name of Top Gear on the Super Nintendo and was big hit. Will there be a Lotus 4? We wait in silence. 00145901 Limited visibility is one of the hazards of night-time driving. 135 What on earth is CVG's very 2 own Nick Cotton looka-like talking about? I remember Lotus Esprit on the Amiga, thought it was the tops, and to be perfectly honest this conversion Wisn't a million miles away from being bang-on! Graphically, I don't think it's bad at all Anglin must have had his special blocky glasses on when he was playing, because the cars are quite well drawn. Sound isn't anywhere near being bad in fact, there are one or two good tunes in there and some half-decent sound effects as well. And as for the speed the road fairly zips along underneath your wheels. I do believe that the time-limit-beating style of play is somewhat limiting, but two-player mode makes up for that more than adequately. Take no notice of sad Anglin; Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is a perfectly respectable cart. PAUL RAND STRATEGY SKILL 104 MPH53208 CB 24 GET IN GEAR 109 MPH\"My car must be sad. I can't get anywhere.\" Is this you? Fear not; if you just don't seem to be going fast enough, try switching your transmission from automatic to manual.

Basically, you race totally against the clock and it doesn't matter what position you finish in. This isn't nearly as much fun as trying to finish in first place.

"FUS REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO This nuclear power station is one of your early objectives. SHOOT EM UP BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .00 DES Typical! There you were, just about to get the Christmas tree up, when all of a sudden some nutter decides to install a load of rocket bases in the Middle East, threatening the very existence of the planet! A full scale air assault would be too risky, as the evil dictator may notice a fleet of F-14's blowing his rockets up left, right and centre. So what can the President do, other than issue you with the hardest assault helicopter around and tell you to get out there and cripple his entire arsenal? Seeing as you're such a fun-loving guy who loves to indulge in some armour-piercing bullet-related shenanigans, you agree to the idea. So polish your Apache 'til it gleams and get your special hard man socks on you'll get no Christmas spirit out of these fellers! THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL The many different campaigns in Desert Strike all involve some pretty dodgy situations. First on the agenda is to get your hands on the secret agent, who's hidden himself somewhere in the desert and can't be found until you've destroyed a whole heap of Arab goods. Next up it's time to say bye bye to the chemical weapons systems and SCUD launchers dotted around the map. Then it's on to the riverside, where you'll have to rescue hostages trapped on the madman's yacht. All entertaining stuff, eh? Too right it is and there's another couple of missions to go! GUNNING FOR GLORY When is a gunship not a gunship? When it's got no guns! Luckily, this Apache has three different weapons systems; the 30mm chain gun, Hydras and radar-guided missiles. While you can shoot those 30mms quite happily without much fear of running out, both the Hydras and radar guided bombs are in short supply and will need a careful check kept on them. All three weapons are useful in different situations the chain gun is best used for taking out foot soldiers and enemy camps, while the missiles come in handy for destroying hard targets such as SCUD launchers and enemy bases. Hydras come in handy for taking out well defended AAA units. Desert Strike managed to cause quite a stir when it came into the office, even though we'd all seen it before on Megadrive. I suppose it was never going to be particularly different to it's Sega counterpart, but I was expecting some kind of graphical boost alas, no. The game itself has remained totally unchanged having said that, the original was, and still is, an absolute must-have, and this is just as brilliant. There's so much to do and so many things to lay waste to, that you can expect to be up until the early hours time and time again, trying to get to the madman's bunker. The difficulty setting has been set just right-it may be bloody hard, but you just can't put it down until you've got that little bit further. Megadrive owners had something to shout about in Desert Strike now SNES fans can experience the same fine blast.

"REVIEW TO YOU'LL LOOK A FOOL WITHOUT ANY FUEL With everything running out on you, it's a good job you can pick things up to replenish your ever-depleting supplies. The fuel drums will take your fuel counter right back to one hundred gallons but only pick up fuel when absolutely necessary, 'cos your Apache can only handle one full load at a time. The ammo crates will endow you with thirty-six Hydras and eight radar-guided missiles, with the same rule applying to the ammo as with the fuel. A lot of the collectibles are concealed in buildings, which means you must be careful not to keep firing once you've destroyed a target you may blast the goodies as well. Megadrive owners went gaga when Desert Strike hit their machines, not only for its ooh-risky scenario but also for the excellent graphics and top-notch gameplay. EA's Super Nintendo version is practically a pixel-perfect conversion of the Sega hit, which initially disappointed me because the SNES could have had a graphical field-day with this one, but after a short amount of time I began to concentrate more on the game itself. And you'll have to do the same this is an incredibly difficult shoot 'em up with a goodly amount of strategy thrown in, and it'll take you all your time to get off the first level, never mind reach the end! That said, you always manage to blow up that extra building, or find just one more box of ammo to get you safely through to the next campaign, which keeps the adrenalin and interest at a high level. Basically, it's the same game as the Sega version, but Megadrive Desert Strike is a classic and so's the SNES game get it now!

The map shows you everything you need to know about your mission all the different objectives are depicted, in the order that you must complete them in, as well as all the pick-ups available.

It has to be said though, that they're a bit thick; although they're quite obviously able to scarper to safety, they tend to hang around near enemy soldiers and weaponry, making your job much more dangerous when it comes to rescuing them.

"RUE REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO ARCADE BY THO .00 NOT OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE AND YET PILOTING A VARIETY OF HIGHT TECH AIRCRAFT! Why is it that all kids insist on carrying on the family tradition? James Bond Jr could have been an accountant and had a nice relaxing time, sitting at a desk writing lots of important forms, but oh no instead, the young whippersnapper decides embark upon a lifetime of dodging bullets, landing top international models and other heroic exploits. And it just so happens that Dr Derange head of SCUMM has appeared to create all manner of chaos in the world etc, etc. OOOH! JAMES! In order to keep your special investigation into Dr Derange's goings-on ticking over, you'll have to grab the plethora of special items scattered around the stages. There's an absolute stack of them to get here's a list of the more important ones: HEART -Adds one unit of energy to your meter. 1-UP Gives an extra life. SNEAKERS allow young Jim to jump that little bit higher. DART Adds a dart gun to James' arsenal. SHIELD Makes your vehicle impervious to damage for a few hits. PREPARE TO DIE, MR BOND This game deserves some kind of award for the crappest Super Nintendo title in a long time! The James Bond Jr cartoon is a bit of an abomination, but I expected much more from the game than this. The graphics are terrible, with some of the worst animation yet seen on the SNES. James doesn't run; he sort of shuffles without moving his feet, which is some trick in anyone's language! Sound is even worse; horrible, grating tunes torture your ears and spot effects are generally pitiful. The gameplay does absolutely nothing to rescue James Bond Jr -this could well be the most unresponsive, dodgy and frustrating game ever to hit the Super Nintendo. The collision detection is so iffy it makes an otherwise simple game incredibly difficult and totally frustrating. James Bond Jr is a mockery of the capabilities of the SNES steer well clear! PAUL ANGLIN The original James Bond always wowed the lovelies with his wealth of hi-tech kit, and his young 'un looks to be following in father's footsteps. Get hold of grenades for long-distance lobbing, or grab the rocket gun for enemy-shooting action and thrills. In the air, pick up the shrapnel-tipped missiles to destroy many more vehicles and, on the speedboat level, purloin the nitro boost to turn your tootling little craft into a speed demon! AH, MR BOND I SAY, A ROBOTIC JU JU MASK TYPE ENEMY THING! Even though this is James Jr's first outing he's already learned how to control a number of top secret assault vehicles. Level two sees you controlling a death dealin' mini-copter across a forest laden with groundbased tanks and the odd anti-aircraft missile. Level four puts you behind the wheel of a nippy speedboat down by the riverside and, if you're good enough to get that far, level six lets you take to the skies in a jaunty jet which resembles the classic UN Squadron fighter!

"CVG REVIEW MEGADRIVE SPORT SIM TIDLA BY ACCLAIM .99 BATEANA MOVE TO THE GROOVE It seems as though some people will do anything for money. I mean, dishing out grub in burger bars is one thing, but pulling on a pair of tights and grappling with sweaty men is quite another. But the WWF boys don't care 'cos they're that hard and they'll dust anyone who says otherwise. You control some of the World Wrestling Federation's most famous and infamous characters, and have to guide them to the precious WWF title by smacking everyone's teeth in. There are a number of grapplers to choose from and a stack of different matches to enter; take part in a Survivor Series, one on one match, a tag team bout or the WWF title challenge if you're feeling up to it. No WWF game would be the same without a fair sprinkling of bone-crunching attacks and the odd signature move here and there. WWF Super Wrestlemania has more than its fair share of these, with each character able to perform his own special move. These range from Papa Shango's shoulder-breaker to the British Bulldog's Powerslam. Most are very easy to pull off and consist of just pressing A and C together. The majority can be used at any time but some, such as Randy Savage's elbow, can only be used when an opponent is down. THE BOYS As you might expect with a WWF game, WWF Super Wrestlemania features a large selection of all your fave boys. The list ranges from the sadness of Irwin R Schyster, right up to the likes of the British Bulldog and the Ultimate Warrior. There's no real difference between all the different characters other than the inclusion of their signature moves, but it's a good laugh to be able to choose your favourite WWF boy. CRUNCH! A MASSIVE DROP KICK STRAIGHT TO THE CHIN! OOOH! I CAN'T BARE TO LOOK! ULTIMATE NAER.IO YE Another SNES game gets the Megadrive treatment this month; WWF Super Wrestlemania is almost identical to its SNES brother, except for a few differences. The digitised pics of the lads aren't quite up to the same standard, but that's not to say they're not good, and with very detailed and fluid sprites you can hardly call the graphics anything less than brilliant. The other main change has come in the playability department. There are new wrestlers included in this version, not to mention a stack of signature moves, and the control method for all the grappling action is very easy to get to grips with. Sounds good in one-player mode? It is, but WWF Super Wrestlemania really comes into its own when you get a friend round for a two-player fighting feast! Overall, a job well done and an improvement over the already excellent SNES version. TENG SHUNCE CVG 026 CVG 026 PAUL ANGLIN ANE "


"GIVE US THE GEN ON THE WWE MEN REVIEW GUE The WWF boys may be rock hard, but it has to be said they're being a a bit sad at the minute. Rowdy Roddy Piper has left the squared circle to follow a musical career with a rather tawdry single called \"I'm Your Man\": apparently, this is more fun than running around a ring and get paid thousands for it. The British Bulldog has quit the grapplefest in favour of becoming the latest Gladiator, but then with not-ugly Ulrika Jonnson presenting the show, you can hardly blame him, can you? ERM. I DREAD TO THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE! HULANAS BAVAGE BRLLOSE AAAH! THAT WILL MAKE YOUR EARS BURN! SPRIONG! MAKE USE OF THOSE ELASTIC ROPES! The problem with all the wrestling games that we've seen so far is that there are too few moves. Wrestlemania goes some of the way to tackling this problem by giving each character a good library of kicks, punches, throws and maiming techniques to choose from. Unfortunately it's pretty hard to bring them all into play, especially when up against a mate, as you don't have a lot of time to mess about; whereas you'd love to clothes-line a baddy or triple pile-drive him, most of the time you'll settle for kicking him in the face a few times to rob him of energy. The animation of the wrestlers is totally convincing though, apart from when they're knocked to the ground and roll up and down the screen trying to avoid the high altitude belly flop! It's hilarious! The tag-team feature adds a much-needed bit of strategy to the game too, but despite Paul's high praises I'd have to question how long you'll want to play WWF for.

MIND ME TENTACLES There's a real war going in Sega and Nintenc land, what with the SNES playing host to a perfect convert of the Megadrive hit Desert Strike, and now Virgin hitting back with their Sega version of Another World. And guess what it's exactly the same as the Super Nintendo game reviewed last ish! Absolutely nothing has been left out; the incredibly life-like animations are all in there, as are the cut scenes which add greatly to the 'interactive movie' atmosphere of the game. I've played Another World on every machine it's appeared on and never got bored with it, and the Megadrive game has the same gripping playability as all the rest. Not only that, it's also faster than most because of the machine's nippy processor. There's a password option included which may allow you to complete the quest relatively quickly, but when I say relatively I mean in terms of weeks. But don't just take my word for it; plug in the Another World cart and be amazed. I was! Large explosions usually render those stuck slap-bang in the middle of them dead, or at least not very well not our Les. Just before the particle accelerator goes bang, the lightning causes the machine to do its stuff. However, because it's fed with thousands of volts when it shouldn't really be run off anything other than the normal mains supply, the accelerator goes haywire. Which is why, when his atoms are rejoined, Lester finds himself in a large pool of water on an alien planet. This is the start of Chaykin's quest, and he's got to get out of the drink fast before the enormous tentacled horror lurking at the bottom grabs him! CVG 030 PAUL RAND "

Right from the start, you're accosted by massive, wolf-stroke-bear combinations, sprawling, tentacled terrors and the rulers of the planet, strange humanoid beasties that knock you senseless and lock you in a cage. Don't be too despondent though; you end up making friends with one of This other world is a big place, and your quest spans a large expanse of land, the aliens who becomes a necessary both above and underground. Many of the areas visited by Lester contain a ally throughout your adventure puzzle or hindrance which must be tackled successfully before he can contindon't fall out with each other, and ue on his way. Just because you don't solve a problem on one screen, ensure that you guard him as well doesn't mean you're going to die on the following one, though success in as yourself against enemy attack completing tasks generally won't become apparent until later on in the game.

"FUL REVIEW THE BEAST FROM ANOTHER WORLD! TOP GUN Whoaah! No sooner do we get over the extreme excellence that was Out Of This World on the Super Nintendo than we get our flabbers well and truly ghasted by the same game, sporting its original name, on Megadrive. The game is exactly the same as all versions apart from one important aspect it's much faster! Everyone thought that the SNES version was the one to top the lot think again. The Megadrive's faster CPU is shown off to full extent in the incredible intro, and the game itself plays just that little smoother and faster; there's also no waiting inbetween scenes like the Super Nintendo version. The only thing that has been slightly toned down is the music, but Megadrive Another World does have the best samples of all the lot, so don't lose too much sleep. An incredible game has just got better so, all you Megadrive owners, go out and gloat over having the best version of Another World in the cosmos! You'd think that an alien planet would be chock-full of all manner of weird and wonderful weaponry, but you could be a little disappointed to discover that the best piece of kit you can get your hands on is a simple laser pistol. It can do a number of smart things though either let off a few laser blasts, power it up and build a shield that will only crack after a few hits, or power-up even further for an ultra-powerful blast that'll destroy almost anything in its path! Sometimes even your gun is useless, and you've got to rely on something a little less subtle like a swift kick to the nether regions when one of the baddies grabs you by the throat! STREAMING RAYS OF PLASMA OBLIVION! BREAKING GLASS PAUL ANGLIN Remember earlier, when we told you that the consequences of many of Lester's actions don't become apparent until later on in the game? Well, there's a part of Another World where this rings incredibly true. Some way into the game you'll come across a room with glass balls hanging from the ceiling, and if you look carefully you can see the reflection of a patrolling guard, directly underneath. If you enter that room, which is actually on a completely different platform, the guard will blast you to smithereens, so you've got to find a way of putting him out of action. Clue there's a gap in the wall just large anough to aim your gun at one of the glass spheres... DELPHINE'S BACK IN A FLASH ENT ALS DIRECONE Many people may not have heard of Delphine, the creators of Another World, because they've concentrated mainly on home computer software up until now. They're first big hit was Future Wars, followed by Operation Stealth. Both were graphic adventures in a similar style to Lucasfilm's Monkey Island and Indy games. The French softco's first extensive use of polygons came in their fun but rather slow Cruise For A Corpse, with Another World following shortly after and going down a storm on every format it hit. If you think that's the end of the saga, think again; soon to appear on a number of formats is Flashback, unofficial sequel to Another World and we've got the Exclusive lowdown on the game, elsewhere in this very issue!

"AVE WHERE'S THE JUICE? NES Robocop must collect the power pods scattered around the platforms to keep his efficiency levels up. Some will immediately replace lost energy, whilst others can be saved until later and used to repair limbs and body armament back at the laboratory at the end of a level. If you neglect certain areas, Robo is inclined to loose control for a second during play and put you right in PLATFORM it. BY OCEAN .99 LOOK OUT! A SNIPER! CAN YOU SMELL PORK?! Robocop's mission to rescue his fellow officers leads him through factories, workshops and city streets, some of which have stunning backdrops for the NES! The animation of the characters is great too, but the sprites are prone to clashing and flickering when there's more than one on-screen. Computer effects as seen through Robo's eyes really add some atmosphere to the game, and keep you coming back to see what's next. ROBO LIES IN AMBUSH! RGROUEU The metal monolith is back! But this time, he hasn't got a film to ride his video game interpretation on the back of! Yes, for what could be the first time ever, a licensed game has appeared before the product it's actually licensed from! The movie company who were producing the Robocop 3 movie have gone bust, so there's a slight possibility that the film will never be released over here at all! But all that doesn't matter now: the game's here, the plot centres around Robo attempting to rescue his chums from the now-derelict Old Detroit ... A MOST EXCELLENT Don't be put off CGAME... Robocop 3 by the scrappylooking graphics at the beginning of the game they get a whole lot better! The jumping from platform-to-platform can get pretty dull, but with the addition of power pods that allow you to charge up different parts of the body and the like, I was eventually won over. There's a great variety of villains to smack about and blast to pieces and the graphics are constantly changing, so your interest is kept well up. The whole kit and caboodle has been presented very nicely, from the excellent city landscapes to the series of explosions that take Robo apart when he dies. By no means is Robocop 3 going to melt your socks, but it'll keep you going a long time after many platform romps have long lost their appeal. STEVE KEEN GRAPHICS % SOUND THAT HANGING CHAIN LOOKS OMINOUS! THE HIGH-TECH OFFICER OF THE PEACE BLOWS AWAY HIS 923rd SUSPECT! HURRAH! CHOICES, CHOICES What use would any self-respecting killing machine be without weapons? Robocop's got tons of 'em six to be exact. But to get his claws on them you've got to collect the special disks and advance the cursor at the top of the screen. Rapid shot, triple direction and rocket launcher are just three, but the extras don't end there; the second stage leads to Robocop being equipped with a rather useful jet-pack!

Fiend's speech and a couple of animated sections, but after half an hour's play you realise that there's little else on offer. Whereas Devil Crash is riddled with extra bonuses and rewards for good play, such as a whole host of different bonus tables, Crue Ball possesses only a handful of extras and just one main play-field. The battle in space with the flipper sled makes you believe that there could be something just around the corner if you could only The Crue are famous for their rockin' good tunes, but the three keep the ball in play long enough, but included here won't do them any favours.

"YOB'S M You'd think that Christmas would be a time of glad tidings, goodwill to all men and letters worth reading. But no, in YOB's Mailbag trash is trash, whatever time of the year. Still, at least I just have to read them, not live them like the poor unfortunates who put pen to paper this time around. Hope you all have a perfectly lousy Christmas, get all the worst presents ever which break two hours after you've opened them, and the telly breaks down half-way through the James Bond film. That'll give you time to send another stack of desperately unfunny mail to: BARBERA CARTLAND ROMANCE BOOK OFFER, C/O YOB'S MAILBAG, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. comics and so on. Luckily for him I gave his NES away! Now he's on his Megadrive 24 hours a day, playing Sonic The Whatever and insisting on having his hair dyed blue and spiked. In fact, he was pestering me again while I was writing this letter, so I had to calm him down by slapping his ugly face a few times.

"AILBAG TORCH THAT GETS BROKEN BEFORE LUNCHTIME Dear YOB Here are some questions I hope you can answer. 1. I know Streetfighter 2 is coming out on the Amiga, but how will the controls work? 2. Will you have to use the Megadrive control pad? 3. Will SF2 on the Amiga be as good as the SNES version? 4. Do you think Capcom will release a six button joystick that will work on the Amiga?

Make sure you follow the instructions sent with your converter and you should be alright unless your name is M Clynn, of course any machine will immediately sense your presence and fry its own chips in disgust. YOB: I've got a better idea that lets you hang on to your beloved Electron. Give up trying to flog it, dig a big hole and throw yourself in it along with your crappy computer and its cack spelling games. Scott Gray, Peterborough.

"PVP REVIEW TALE SPIN MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BYSEGA .99 CRATE BALLS OF FIRE WATER WAY   Daloo the Bear's moved out of Dthe Jungle Book and into the freight business. A big company has offered an infinite amount of work to the courier firm that can collect the most parcels in seven days, and Baloo wants that work! Unfortunately, so does his main rival, Shere Khan, who's already hot on the trail of the packages. Visit nine different parts of the world, collecting cargo from the most awkward places, then ship them to the Customs office and fly off to the next destination. But beware Shere Khan's henchmen are out to scupper your chances every step along the way! In each of the nine locations the player must collect at least ten items of cargo before he can leave that area. It's not an easy task, either the crates are positioned in some very difficult-to-reach places, such as on top of tall buildings, slap-bang in front of gun-toting minions of Shere Khan, even underwater! To assist ONE OF THE DEADLIEST FOE'S Baloo and Kit, each has a weapon to FOUND IN VIDEO GAMES... A, ER, maul the meanies with although WATERFOUNTAIN whether you can call Kit's slingshot and Baloo's paddle-ball weapons, we're not too sure! It's a fact bears do not like water. And Baloo being just such a mammal, he's none too keen on having to wade into the stuff. The trouble is, he's going to have to if he harbours any notion of winning this contest, because some of the crates of cargo are immersed in underground lakes. Not being a fish, Baloo will have to come up for air regularly, so it's a good idea to keep an eye open for little oxygen pockets if you're straying far into the water. ANYTHING TO DECLARE? Okay, so you've grabbed your ten items of cargo and made it to the Customs office what you may not have been expecting is a heavily armed nasty lying in wait to halt your progress. There's a different one in each office; defeat them and you take to the skies in your trusty plane, the Sea Duck, and fly to the next stage of the quest. It's here that you'll come into contact with the air pirate Don Karnage and his bully-boys, who try to nick your riches by lobbing bombs at your craft! You do have some response a gun-toting kit is being towed behind the Sea Duck to ward off any nimble-fingered nasties. Tailspin looks as though it's running on a Master System sprites and backdrops are quite basic and not particularly detailed. Each level is quite large, but the main stages themselves aren't that tricky to complete the end-level nasties, on the other hand, are and it looks as though they've been put in primarily to beef up the game's otherwise lacklustre difficulty setting. There's a two-player mode included in the game, allowing yourself and a chum to control Baloo and Kit at the same time, but that just makes the game simpler because the challenge isn't beefed up sufficiently. This is not a terrible game it's playable enough and reasonably addictive in the short term but it could have been so much better had there been a little more thought put into it.

"GVE REVIEW EWE . DOMINO RALLY PVA SUPER NINTENDO DOMINO RALLY You're not playing with a standard set of dominoes in Pushover, these ones can do all sorts of things. Apart from the usual dominoes which do nothing more exciting than fall over, there are several 'special pieces which would go down like a pork chop in a synagogue at the local labour club. Among their ranks are ascenders, which go up when they're knocked, splitters which divide into two dominoes, bridges which cover gaps, stoppers which seem to be superglued to the spot and vanishers which disappear PUZZLE BY OCEAN .99 PUSHOVER S PY PUZZLE MUDDLE ow about this for a strange conncept an ant who topples dominoes. While this pastime is normally observed by Japanese students, who spend countless hours recreating works of art, in dominoes, just to push them over and put them back in their boxes. In this game the ant isn't toppling dominoes for fun, he has to solve a number of domino-related puzzles to help his friends out. Considering there's nothing A in the way of action in this game, it's surprisingly addictive. The time limits contribute the most to this, they're usually just long enough for you to complete the level and get to the door with two or three seconds to spare, which makes for some real nailbiting moments. I did found the game becoming a bit limited once I got into it, as many of the puzzle seemed to be repeated in slightly different formats. It starts off in a very easy vein, with a simple line of dominoes to topple, but soon becomes very challening indeed. Unlike many puzzle games, though, this isn't frustrating, and you can have as many cracks at completing a level as you want, and jotting down the codes you're given is essential if you don't want to find yourself repeating the previous 20 levels or so. One annoying feature is the when the ant salutes when the last domino falls, wasting a vital second which could make the difference between success and failiure on some levels.. Not a title for action freaks, but a good way to kill a few hours. PAUL RAND GRAPHICS % 75 The puzzles range from the relatively simple matter of swapping one or two pieces around to a complicated race against the falling dominoes in an attempt to move a key piece into to catch the trigger domino. If you can't remember what the special dominoes do, pressing start calls up a handy reference screen so there's no excuse forconfusing a splitter with an exploder. 00:12 07 SEE ANT NO DOUBT Your ant is quite a hefty little bloke, who's capable of lugging individual dominoes up and down ladders. The aim is to arrange them in such away that the trigger domino, which is the one with the three stripes, is the last to fall. Of course, it's not just a matter of pushing one domino and watching the rest fall. There are gaps in the platforms and the dominoes are stacked on different levels, so you have to work out where to move the dominoes so they fall in succession LOCCO 11:22 CVG STRATEGY SKILL SOUND % 79 GAMEPLAY % 84 VALUE % 80 REFLEXES ACTION GVG 050 CVG "

"Ken is too close to Ryu for comfort and is in fact the the only other student of the famed martial arts master Sheng Long. Ken has proved himself to be an incredibly fast and dexterous fighter, but in recent years has let his talents slide in order to devote more time to all things female. However news of the Street Fighter Tournament has stirred up some old memories and once more he longs for the cheers of the crowd and the blood on his fists. Being one of the most versatile fighters of them all Ken is one of the most popular choices of would-be champions. Special Combat moves are Hurricane Kick, Dragon Punch and Fireball.

"After years of intense training in the art of Yoga Dhalsim has managed to turn his sinewy body into a rubber power-house. By constantly stretching his limbs he's become so supple that he can contort them into all manner of defensive and offensive formations, making his very body a lethal weapon. No one's quite sure why the Indian has entered the Street Fighting arena, but most are wary of his fearsome appearance and the magical aura he radiates. During his own personal battle with the mystic arts he's also managed to master one of the elements, fire, and can now send waves of roasting flames from his mouth at will! His special combat moves are the Yoda Fire, Yoda Flame, Diagonal Torpedo and Horizontal Torpedo. 0 25% 50% PUNCHES ATTACK RATINGS 75% 100% PUSHING JOYPAD FIERCE 75% 100% 25% 50% HARD 75% 100% O 25% 50% NORMAL O 25% 50% KICKS 75% 100% FIERCE 75% 100% 25% 50% HARD 75% 100% 0 25% 50% NORMAL YODA FLAME 50% 75% 100% 25% YODA FIRE 50% 75% 100% 25% DIAGONAL TORPEDO 50% 75% 100% 25% HORIZONTAL TORPEDO 25% 50% 75% 100% STREET GUIDE 2 "

TDI:63% WINNING TACTICS KENRYU:Astonishingly enough when fighting the computer Ken or Ryu the machine has a flip and you can easily get the duo into a dragon punch frenzy. Simply stand your distance and punch where they land for an easy win. CHUN LI: As you know the oriental flower bounces all over the place. Simply walk backwards and time your kicks to catch her on the side of the head as she attempts to spiral over your head.

"Sagat was held to be greatest fighter of all time, up until his defeat by Ryu in the previous tournament. This time round he's out for revenge and has trained longer and harder than any of the other contestants to fine tune his incredible new skills. His speed of attack is almost unprecedented and what with his complete mastery of high and low fireball attacks and the awesome Tiger Uppercut he ranks as one of the most dangerous warriors on the circuit. Versatility is Sagat's strength, being expert at both long range and close quarter combat. Just when you think you've got him beat he'll pull an incredible combination form out of nowhere and leave you dusted and broken at his feet! Stay calm and keep your distance. A scrap with the Thai champ will call upon all your special attacking skills BEATING SAGAT ST BLANKA: Duck underneath GUILE: Use the somersault high Fire Shots and upper cut to Sonic Kick to it's full, but don't miss! crack Sagat's jaw wide open.

NEVER use electric attacks, at all. Always duck under Fire Shots but the Rolling Ball can be handy. and come up with a heavy kick to send him reeling. KEN/RYU: Exactly the same tactics as with Dhalsim. Fireball Sagat to oblivion and if the thug tries any monkey business, like jumping in from on high, just upperZANGIER: If you can lead cut for a one way ticket to complete Sagat into your corner for a fist fight triumph! you might stand a chance, but chances are he'll waste your bones from a distance with Fire Shots which Zangief can't even avoid by jumping!

When he's knocked two on screen at the same time you backwards run up to him for a full could be forgiven for thinking that power punch, but don't get too close, they were separated at birth!

"CHEAT MORE Good day to you all and welcome to this Yuletide episode of Cheat Mode, hosted as ever by young tearaway Paul 'I don't look at all like Nick Cotton' Anglin. Now he's managed to grab this fine section all for himself, our lad Anglin's got a few ideas up his sleeve keep your eyes open over the coming months and see the Jaunty One transform Cheat Mode into even more of what it already is: the best. In the meantime, keep wanging your hints and cheats to: PAUL ANGLIN'S SPOILT ROTTEN CHEAT MODE, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON, EC1R 3AU. Just think if your tip is the biz you could win software worth .00! Get to it! SIM CITY: SHADOW DANCER Paul Jeacock from Ashfield, Notts, has come up with a top cheat for this game of one ninja and his dog. Take it away, Jeasy! For a LEVEL select screen, do the following: press buttons A,B and C together on the title screen. UE SUPER NINTENDO Not the best start ever the first tip and it's got no name. Spend all of your money in one year. When the tax screen appears at the end of the year, hold the L button and exit the screen. While still holding the L button, go back to the tax screen and increase spending to 100%. Exit again and release L. When the people start spending, your funds will rise to $999,999. B Russel from Folkestone in Kent has got a sense of humour almost as weird as the one in this game. But he has sent us a smart cheat, so we'll let him off. As soon as you get either Icarus wings or a rubber ring, drop off the edge of the island and go all the way back to level one. Move the lads down to the bottom-left hand corner of the island out across the water, and you'll eventually come to a doughnut-shaped island with a sort of a warp, hole in the middle. Drop through the warp and you'll fall onto level O, which is filled with loads of bonuses and a jacuzzi. Falling off this will return you to the highest point you reached previously MEGADRIVE ME Cor blimey! No sooner does CVG review the game than James Blackham form Kings Heath, Birmingham, sends all the passwords for it. What a lad!

"BATTLETOADS BATMAN It's the boy B Russel again, and this time he's worked his wonderment on the game which knocks those rivals the Turtles into a cocked shell. Hold down A, B and then press DOWN and START for five extra lives. You want more Nintendo Game Genie hilarity? Look no further than here! Some top codes for not the worst platform romp in the world. EXGOTO Running enemies freeze when shot PPPPPP Machines move slower SOPEZA One shot with Dirk ZOOL NINTENDO SUPER ADVENTURE ISLAND II 10 We're even getting tips from the one and only Manchester Utd centre back Steve Bruce! What a guy, eh? Shame they got whacked out of the UEFA cup though. On the title screen type GOLDFISH and the screen will flash. When the game starts press 1 for a shield, 2 to skip a stage and 3 to skip a world. And another Zool tips, this time Danny Francis who think the game is fANTastic! Once you get to the platform which crumbles with a Z power-up on it, jump across to the second platform below there is a comer. Jump into it and you will go to the seceret bonus stage. So as not to feel left out, ere's some Game Genie s or you Nintendo owners! PEXVAALE 10 lives SXNLOKVK-infinite lives SZUIGEVK infinite energy XTAINS invincibility GEXULGPA higher jumps XENON II PANZA KICKBOXING I've been up to my old tricks again and managed to find you this little treat with the help of my very own GT (spawny get! The CVG Boys). Use this code to start with 99% on all attributes and $900,000: DGDGDGKF. ROUND: 1 The one and only PC cheat this month comes from Stuart Crocker from Mid, Glamorgan, Wales. When the computer brings up the menu of CGA, EGA etc, press F7 then, when you have started to play, you can switch invincibility on and off by pressing I. PC ENGINE AMIGA X220 Paul O'Hara from Luton has come up with a great way to win a race without driving maybe Ayrton Senna should try it out. As soon as the starter says go press P to pause the game then press P again to unpause it you will win the race instantly. George Ogier has found a pretty novel cheat for all you Final Fight saddies out there. Speaking of sad you forgot your address George! At any time in the game press 0 on any of the number key pads to go right to the end! Thanks...to Hornby Hobbies for the Game Genie codes used in this month's Cheat Mode. PUSHOVER AMIGA Thanks go to Luke Atkinson for providing me with all these codes (not to mention hours of rather boring typing antics). And be nice to him after all he does come from Chelmsford; the party capital of the Western world. 01536 04098 01024 12290 03072 13826 13314 02560 02048 15362 15878 06144 06656 14854 07680 14342 10246 07168 05122 10758 05634 11782 04610 11270 09222 06734 08718 08206 24590 25102 26126 25614 27662 28174 27150 26638 30734 31246 32270 31758 29726 30238 29214 28702 20510 21022 22046 21534 23582 24094 23070 22558 18494 19006 20030 19518 17470 17982 16958 16510 16511 17023 18647 17535 19583 20095 19071 18559 22655 24149 23679 21631 22143 21247 20735 28927 29439 30463 29957 31999 25599 25087 08073 09275 10239 09727 09 00:29 cVG 070 "

"VASTLIGHT We are a Hong Kong based export company specialising in video games & relating material. Hong Kong without doubt is still one of the most important trading centres and also manufacturers of some of the 'peripherals' appearing recently. Most of the so-called 'imported' goods come through Hong Kong at some stage or another. However, the range of console and related goods available in Europe are very limited; nowhere near the large variety on offer to consumers here. So we are here to offer people the usual consoles, cartridges, joysticks, boosters and the other 'peripherals' that are hard to get hold of in other countries. In a sum, as long as its available in HK and related to video games, we can supply it. Currently, we deal with the SFC/SNES, MD, PCE, GG, GB, & Super Gun. SFCISNES is very popular now with new 'peripherals' appearing all the time, We would like to increase the number of overseas customers whether it be traders or private buyers. The idea of sending money and buying from abroad is no doubt regarded as risky by many private buyers. So why trust us? Firstly, you have to consider the goods available in your country. All these Japanese imported goods are not on the shelves by accident; they are there because some company has taken the risk to buy off another company in the Far East. Our company now sell to some of the largest retailers/mail order companies in Germany, UK and New Zealand. The amount of trade we deal with each company far exceeds what we deal with any private individual so if they can trust us, so can you. In addition, too many private individuals are too worried about what they could lose and not considering what a company can lose. The rapid expansion of our company has came about because satisfied customers have given recommendations to other people they know. Because we're based in Hong Kong, we can offer the latest goods when they're released and a much larger range at competitive prices. When a firm is in such a competitive position, does it make any sense to rip people off? Wouldn't the loss in potential profit outweigh the small gains in running with one's money? For ease of payment, our company offers a unique system whereby residents in the former West Germany and the UK can order without the need of sending any money abroad. If you live in the former West Germany, you can order off us by simply depositing your Deutsche Marks in any branch of the Deutshe Bank, Bayerische Hypothekenund Wechsel Bank and the Stadtsparkasse. All you have to do is send a photocopy of the bank counterfoil to us with details of your order. This safe method of payment eliminates any costs when on deals with foreign currency. In the UK, Sterling can be deposited at any branch of the Midland Bank or Barclays Bank. If you live anywhere else you must pay in Hong Kong Dollars. For the benefit of people overseas, we also offer a video which features all the latest SFC 'peripherals'. There is some feature of the MD but mainly it is for SFC owners. Whether you are a beginner to consoles or quite knowledgeable this video will be worth your while. These SFC 'peripherals have been around for some time now but people in Europe have only got knowledge of the basic ones. This means that the more sophisticated peripherals' go by unheard of. This video is over 100 minutes in length and in English/P L I. Once again, people will probably just ignore this because they feel its just another company offering a video with the hottest stuff' on when in fact at the end of the day it's just a disappointment. Up until now, there were no companies in Hong Kong prepared to tell you what is new. Information on SFC 'peripherals' filter through very slowly but since the advent of them in Europe, rumours go round and as it spreads information is manipulated. Find out the truth, find out everything about the most wanted devices for the Super Famicom So, for the ultimate rundown on the very latest SFC 'peripherals', just send a PO payable to VASTLIGHT for DM23/GBP. French and German scripts are also available free. As a bonus, the video also features some of the few versions of SF2. Since summer this year, there has been the appearance of no less than eight versions of the Champions Edition in the arcades. This may sound unbelievable but I believe these new versions of SF2 have also been appearing in London; one of the versions is known as 'Champion of Champions' in England. For those who have not seen it, new features include special moves in mid air, change characters in mid-game, longer Dragon Punches and Hurricane Kicks. Unless you know Chinese people who come on holiday in Hong Kong quite regularly, you will not have heard or seen many of the products on this video and believe me its worth your while. For a full and up to date price list just send a PO for DM2/GBPl or send a fax to us.

"CHALLENGE GAME ONE THE AVG CHALLENGE! NAME: SUPER MARIO KART MACHINE: SUPER NINTENDO THE CHALLENGE: PLAY MUSHROOM CUP AT 50CC AND 100CC OVER ENTIRE SEASON HIGHEST SCORE AT THE END WINS 000 29 OK losers the moment you've all been waiting for has arrived! To haul you all back into the Christmas spirit the CVG Crew have decided to revive the incredibly popular CVG Challenge, appointing me, Sadie, as marks mistress. Under my orders the boys scour the country searching for the very best gamers to take up the gauntlet and thrash pixels out of each other for a ton of prizes and the chance to take on the games masters supreme, The CVG Boys! Neither of the boys had played Mario Kart before, but after a few hectic training sessions and choice advice given by the crew they picked it up incredibly quickly, qualifying in nearly every race first time! Simon opted for the handling skills of Toad and Chris decided Yoshi's superior accelerating ability would be enough to see him through. Mushroom Cup was the scene of the first race and the contestants were neck and neck the whole way. With little stress they amazingly scorched across the line with Simon in first and Chris in second and it looked as though we were in for a really close challenge! The second race, however, was a different story! Chris was wiped out by a vicious shell up the backside from Mario, as Simon took full advantage and accelerated through the pile-up to take first. Chris pulled back to third but was never going to catch the leaders after such a sad start. Dogged determination edged its way onto Chris's face, but trouble reared its head once more in the third race as he ran out of coins on the last lap and was well trounced by a heavy smash from Bowser and sent spinning of the track. What a boy! Simon took first place again whilst Chris hobbled in way down the list like a one legged tortoise with athletes foot! It looked as though nothing could go wrong for Simon now, but for some reason his brain went into foppish meltdown and he mistook Yoshi for his kart at the start of the fourth and, before he knew what was going on, the microbe had fallen back to last place! However, Bowser was on the warpath again and continually bombarded Chris with Bowser Bombs, shrinking Yoshi down to microscopic size, but the green skinned spawny toad still won. Chris had now found some form and lead for the first two laps of the next race. However, not to be outdone Simon squeezed in between a block and Yoshi to rob dragon-breath of first place on the line. The grand final of the 50cc class and Chris stormed off like James Hunt! But he soon got into trouble, being sandwiched in-between Bowser and Kong. Simon had already been shrunk by the horned one and was just trundling along, begging to be squashed. Miraculously though, he survived and scooted into first place, leaving Chris struggling to gain fifth after hitting nearly every bend. Maybe with some glasses he could have done better?! 100cc wasn't much kinder to Chris, and there was already a score deficit of 37 to 22 in favour of Simon. Bowser continued to pester Yoshi, taking every opportunity to blanket the boy in banana skins. He also got shrunk on the second lap and, after catching the Princess up the rear with a shell, ran under her wheels and was flattened (DOH!) just to complete his misery (DOUBLE DOH!). Simon, pipped to the post by Kong, took third and Chris fourth. More bad news for Chris, as Simon took second and the Dragon sixth in the following race. An uneventful and scrappy race around Ghost Castle saw Simon win again and Chris forced back to a pitiful fifth.

Simon, not content with taking on fellow competitors, was knocking the stuffing out of a motorcycle policeman with a truncheon for daring to try and pull him over! This act catapulted him into fifth place, whilst Chris sneaked in between a tree and an oncoming car to capture eighth.

"POS REVIEW ME AMIGA RACING SIM KI BY THALON .99 DON'T GET TOO CLOSEIT COULD ALL END IN TEARS! Tou're one of the six best bikers in the world, given the opportunity to race for the biggest prize in motorcycling history an only-oneof-its-kind two-wheeled terror! This ultimate gift can be yours but only if you beat the other guys and gals across some of the world's most famous and dangerous racing circuits. Pull on your leathers and go flat out to win the big onethere's no second prize for the runner-up. BOY (AND GIRL) RACERS There are six different bikers from various parts of the world to choose from at the start of the race; four men and two ladies. Each has his or her own background, such as the German engineer who's obsessed with old Heinkels (they're motorcycles, if you didn't know). Each of the six has they're own strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to you to select the character which best suits you. ON THE RIGHT TRACK The No Second Prize competition is held over twenty different circuits, each one based on real courses around the world. Bomb around Hockenheim; burn rubber around Brand's Hatch; Storm your way around Silverstone! Before you begin the challenge, you can check on statistics relevant to each course, or try a few practice laps either on your own or with the other racers; whichever you choose, make staying on your bike and going very, very fast your prime objectives! JUST CHECK OUT THAT STUNNING HELICOPTER FLY-BY! UGHT ON CAMERA At any time during a race, you can have a look at the action from the tailing cameras by hitting the replay button. There are four different views to choose from; the first gives you a first-person view like that from which you play the game. If that's not to your liking, watch the race unfold from a camera closely following behind your bike alternatively, view from a position slightly further behind to get a better view of the proceedings. If, however, you want to see how the spawny get at the front is doing or if you yourself are that get why not go for the fourth camera mode, which shows a view of the first-place driver from a helicoptermounted camera. Motorbike sims are practically nonexistent on the Amiga, and if anyone is thinking of turning their hand to this untapped genre then they'd better have a bloody good product, because No Second Prize is going to take some beating. The first thing to grab you is the sheer speed of the polygon graphics I'm not joking when I tell you these are some of the fastest, smoothest examples yet seen on the Amiga. And that's even when there are big roadside objects such as grandstands on screen there's very little drop in speed. It's mouse only, but don't worry; the controls are very simple to learn and extremely responsive. There's no shooting or killing to be done here, just straightforward hard and fast racing against a line-up of very skillful riders on a host of top tracks. This is a game that'll test your skills to the limit a very impressive title indeed! PAUL RAND CVC STRATEGY SKILL GRAPHICS % SOUND % 72 GAMEPLAY % 88 VALUE % 85 CVG ACTION REFLEXES CVG 081 "


"GVG REVIEW AVC SCORE: 9981DID SUPER NINTENDO . BARA BEAT EM UP BYTRADE WEST .00 S UP E R W omen, eh? When they're not wingeing about us lads watching footy, they're getting kidnapped by vicious drug gangs. Take Marian, for example. She's a policewoman looking into the dealings of a criminal organisation known as The Black Shadow Warriors. At least, she was until the hoods tracked her down and kidnapped her. You'd think that in these days of recession Billy and Jimmy Lee, Marian's pals and bosses in her part-time job as martial arts instructor at the boys' karate training school, would just shrug their shoulders and look for a new employee but no; they've decided to put their karate skills to good use by entering the shady world of the Black Shadow and doling out their own special brand of justice a swift and ruthless kicking to anyone they come across. BRAEON JOHN MCLAINE NEVER HAD THIS TROUBLE! ATILAIRLINE OFF! OUCH! EEK! Super Double Dragon isn't a straight conversion of the Tecmo coin-op if it were, it would probably get ** a slating because the arcade game is rather N dated but a soupedup, graphically enhanced fight-fest. Super Double DragHAIR on is a real RAISING eyecatcher, with good-looking sprites and some excellent backgrounds. Colour is well used throughout, and those Lee brothers have a few nifty moves up their sleeves. The game actually smacks of the original Megadrive Streets Of Rage there's even an elevator level in here, just like that excellent title. Unfortunately, this one suffers from being a tad too easy in twoplayer mode. Get a friend along, use all the continues available and it won't take you an age to get to the end. Had it been a tad tougher, Super Double Dragon would have been a cracker but even as it stands, it's still worth a look. ATTITAITTETI zo za GVG 082 PAUL RAND "


"EIREVIEW GIVE AVA SIASACHEOS DRUM IT INTO 'EM CASIO Keep your eyes open for the weapon-carrying baddies beat them up and they drop their armaments, which the Lees can pick up and turn against their original owners. Nunchakus and Konbo Sticks are the weapons you'll usually come across, but sometimes Bill 'n' Jim will be able to lay their hands on grenades, knives, boomerangs and even massive oil drums which pulverise baddies with just one hit. ON THE LEVE! The Lee's search for Marian takes them to seven different areas of Las Vegas. Billy and Jimmy start their battle in one of the city's casinos, before moving on to the airport for more heavy-duty scrapping. Win through here and it's off to Chinatown's shopping district and kung-fu gym. It's then time to toddle down to the Golden Gate Bridge where you'll ride on the back of an articulated lorry until you reach The Slums and an abandoned factory full of Black Shadow. Do the business in the factory and you get to travel into The Forest and go up against the Black Shadow leader's right-hand man Carlem do away with him and the road to the final challenge the big man himself, Duke will open up to you. THANKS... to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the review cartridge. It has to be said I wasn't exactly filled with the excitement at the prospect of a SNES game featuring the fabulous Lee brothers but oh how I was surprised! The style of the graphics has changed little from the duo's first outing all those years back and if anything they look very Streets Of Ragey but then what's originality anyway? Luckily the smack 'em up now and laugh later aspect of the game has stayed intact. There are a ton of moves in there and some are real corkers the special moves are easy to pull off and will get you out of some real tight spots. The two player mode has been left intact and yes for those of you wondering you can beat the crap out of your mate if he nicks all the weapons. The only bad thing is that it's a little too easy. If you're playing with a pal it won't take you more than a couple of days to complete but if you're on your own then the lasting appeal should go up a bit. All in all a potentially brilliant beat 'em up that's a real good laugh to play but just misses out on being a classic due to it being too easy. PAUL ANGLIN STRATEGY SKILL WHERE'S HANK MARVIN? SCORE ODBSB SCORES BOE 3 ORE The Black Shadow Warriors gang is well trained in the martial arts and, considering that there's hundreds of them to two of you, the boys are going to be in for a pretty rough ride. And if that wasn't enough, each level has a big boss lying in wait to mop up whatever the minions have let slip through the net. Luckily, Billy and Jimmy aren't lacking in the fighting department, with around twenty different moves and five special attacks to help see them through to the conclusion of their quest. DON'T DO THIS AT HOME! SEPARATED AT BIRTH? ACTION REFLEXES Is it just us, or are video game fighters all related to one another? Latest in a long line of look-a-likes to grace our screens are none other than Billy and Jimmy Lee themselves take a look at these two and compare them to those kings of the Streetfighting circuit, Ryu and Guile uncanny or what? And another thing since when has Jimmy taken to wearing pink? Gumph! GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE CVG % 83 % 81 % 75 % 70 A NOVEL USE FOR A PUNCHBACK! TO SMACK OR NOT TO SMACK 11 STORES Like the original Double Dragon coin-op, one or two player options are available. Should you wish to play alongside a friend, you can choose one of two different modes Mode A allows Billy and Jimmy to beat up each other as well as their enemies, while Mode B stops the boys from smacking each other around, letting them concentrate on doing away with the Black Shadow Warriors.

"CO REVIEW AVG MEGADRIVE ARCADE The Little BY BLUESKY .99 ermaid 120 ! !1 5* HEALTH FISH FINGERS Some areas can't be easily reached they're blocked off by large boul ders, too heavy to be budg mer-person. Luckily, you can com a friendly flounder, whose sole purpose in life is to push away the offending rocks in order to allow our hero to continue. Other fishy friends to call upon include a digger fish that uncovers hidden treasure, and rock-hard Sebastian who scares off any encroaching baddies for a short period of time. JUMBO SAUSAGE AND CHIPS Ursula has placed your pals across four levels; sharks, clams and eels attempt to scupper your chances of success in The Reef, while skeletal pirates will hassle you in The Sunken Ship. Beat the baddies here and its off to the lost city of Atlantis, where statues come magically to life, hurling frisbees and firing arrows at you. The final level takes you to The Cave full of sadistic sea-life, not to mention boiling lava pools that'll make you look like a Greasy Harry's chip-shop special if you run into them. o M ermaids haven't exactly made I waves on the big screen. Apart from the awful Darryl Hannah film Splash, only Disney's The Little Mermaid has furthered the cause of the half-human, half-fish folk in celluloid form, and now Sega have grabbed the rights and come up with this Megadrive conversion. The player dons the dorsal fin of either Ariel or her father, King Triton. Whichever one you select, you've got to rescue the other from the clutches of the dreaded Sea Witch, Ursula! This is a poor game far too small at only four levels longand ridiculously easy to complete; we got all the way through in about an hour. The action and I use that term loosely is the same from start to finish; swim through a maze, collect the merfolk, then fight the end-level baddy before moving on for more of the same. Perhaps if there wasn't a map screen showing exactly where the mer-people are this would have been more enjoyable but I doubt it. To cap it all, The Little Mermaid is a bit of a graphical joke; poorly defined and animated sprites, and flat, uninteresting backdrops. The music isn't much cop either especially bad considering the tunes were some of the movie's strong selling points. Youngsters may enjoy the easy pace of The Little Mermaid, but the rest of you are advised to leave well alone. PAUL ANGLIN GRAPHICS % 58 SOUND HE'S BEHIND YOU! ALL WAS QUIET IN THE BIG BLUE.....APART FROM THE THREE HEADED GREEN HYDRA TYPE ARRANGEMENT. COD INBATTER The kidnapped mer-men have been positioned around each level, and it's up to you to release them. Thing is, they aren't locked away, so why do you have to go and get 'em? Because, Ursula being the nasty old so-and-so that she is, she's turned them into small, green things called Polyps they can't swim and just hang around looking cheesed off. Touch them, however, and they turn back into their original form, able to swim away freely. CVG STRATEGY SKILL E46 % A7 GAMEPLAY VALUE % 40 CVG 086 ACTION REFLEXES CVG "

AN EVERYDAY INCIDENT IN NEW YORK! EXIT SHEER HELL AT THE HOTEL Kevin starts out in the Plaza hotel, where his problems are compounded by the staff, who appear to throttle him when they catch him. Fortunately, our key can jump really high and arm himself with a number of unlikely weapons such as a necklace which breaks to cover the floor in beads, upon which the nasties slip in an incredibly unfunny manner. The first thing to look for is the gun, which fires those little plastic darts with the suckers on the end, the effect of these is to stun whoever they hit. emember the unlikely comedy hit Home Alone? You should do it's the film that launched annoying child actor Macauley Culkin's career with his portrayal of annoying child Kevin McCallister. Now Kevin's back and he's in trouble again. Now he's lost in New York is this kid just unlucky, or do his parents just want shot of him? This time he has to escape the same pair of burglars, along with their newly-recruited gang, while trying to find his parents. Does he succeed, or will key end up a sad, lonely Big Apple dropout? That's up to you! Home Alone 2 really lived up to my expectations; I thought it was going to be crap and it is. The sprites look as though they've been badly digitised either that or the artist drew them small and the programmer enlarged them, which would account for the appalling pixelled effect. On top of that the backdrops are almost devoid of detail some are nothing more than a single colour! Gameplay is as tragic as the graphics; simply walk through the scrolling levels collecting pizza and cash while avoiding or destroying the token nasties it doesn't even begin to approach being fun. To cut a sad story short, Home Alone 2 sucks more than a toothless pensioner with an ice-pole, and if anyone gives it to you for Christmas they're probably trying to tell you something. STEVE KEEN GRAPHICS % 28 SOUND SOUND % 42 ONE OF THE MORE DETAILED BACKGROUNDS... NEW YORK, NEW YORK The final two levels have Kevin showing some initiative. Realising that the probability of finding his parents in a city of fourteen million people is pretty remote, he digs out his address book and looks up his uncle Jack. Unfortunately he isn't in and his house is being renovated. To add to Kevin's problems Harry and Marv, the burglars from the first 'hilarious' film, turn up. Making the best use of a poor plot, our lad rigs up a booby trap which he must use to trap them. If he escapes his final destination is the Rockefeller Plaza, where his parents are waiting for him THANKS ..to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the Review cartridge. WALKIN' IN THE PARK Should Kevin escape the hotel, he then makes the mistake of blundering into Central Park. At the best of times it isn't a safe place, so a young boy wandering there in the dead of night generates plenty of interest from the local punks, muggers, bats and rats. Like most parks, Central has its own resident weirdo in this case it's the pigeon lady. Although Kevin was told never to talk to strangers, he has to befriend her to enter the cave guarded by her pigeons, which leads to the next level. 2TI CVG STRATEGY SKILL El 26 GAMEPLAY VALUE % 28 % 25 ACTION REFLEXES CVG "

"GUG REVIEW MEGADRIVE PICK YOUR TEAM AND HIT THE PITCH.HUT! HUT! SPORT SIM HUT! Buffalo Play Mode Game SCLER Washington T aron HASTOT BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 Lewat DERBI Press Start to Play Before kick-off the ref tosses a coin to decide who kicks and who receives. There's actually quite an advantage to losing the toss, as the loser gets to choose which end of the field they want to defend, a factor which proves crucial if it's windy. You get thirty Seconds to select a play from the dozens available some are safer than others, but if you really want to gain some serious yardage it's worth going for some of the high-risk manoeuvres. ike celebrity Family Fortunes, the release of Megadrive American Football games is becoming a regular Christmas event. This year sees the launch of the third in Electronic Arts' highly successful Madden series, imaginatively titled John Madden '93. The basic gameplay is unchanged in this version; play a single game, take part in the Superbowl qualifiers or try a headto-head match with a mate. There is, however, one new feature added which allows two human players to compete on the same side, with one running or receiving and the other taking the role of the quarterback. Could do better FOOTBALL FORTYEIGHT! #28 RUNS FOR 4 VARD LOSS There are more teams than ever in Madden '93. On top of all the usual ones are classic Superbowl-winning sides such as Washington '82 and San Francisco '86. There's also Madden's Classics a side made up the greatest American footballers ever and is, naturally, almost impossible to beat. John Madden comments on each side before the game, which gives you an idea on whether you should play a running or passing game. KICK IT HARD FOR THE EXTRA POINTS STo my mind the success of the Madden games is down to their pace, excellent control system and huge number of plays, so when one of these elements goes missing the whole game suffers. That's exactly what happens in this game. It plays at a really frustrating pace, something that's very noticeable if you've played the previous games. And perhaps more to the point, were it not for the speed, the few bits of digitised animation and smattering of speech, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and Madden '92. Definitely the worst of the trio, and hopefully EA will finally learn that '92 is virtually impossible to improve on. Most of the new features are purely cosmetic. When you switch the Megadrive on you're greeted with a digitised animation of John Madden. Other treats include a digitised crowd animation that appears when you score a touchdown, and the occasional sampled phrase such as the won't forget that number in a hurry'. One or two extra plays have also been bunged in, but apart from that the gameplay is the same as in the previous games, except for one important difference for some reason this is slower than the two previous Madden titles, which is strange as no noticeable changes have been made to the graphics. 40EUL 90922SBA Wm direction STRATEGY SKILL CVG PAUL ANGLIN GRAPHICS % 80 SOUND % 83 GAMEPLAY % VALUE % 78 OU CVG 090 ACTION REFLEXES CVG "


"REVIEW CVE L.A SUPER NINTENDO SPORT SIM BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .00 One aspect of Electronic Arts' sports sims that has become very much an essential part of the package is the instant replay option, and it's made its way onto the Super Nintendo version of Madden '93. By pushing SELECT at any moment during the game you can gain control of the replay feature, which works like a VCR and features play, rewind and slow motion buttons, allowing you to view that glorious forty-yard field goal time and time again! TWENTY eeing as the Americans have never been much cop at our fine sport of football (just watch John Harkes at Sheffield Wednesday is you don't believe us), they decided to create their own version of it. And although it's a bit of an overstatement to call it football most of the time the ball is carried, and it isn't even a proper ball it seems to have been well-received over here. There have been countless attempts to recreate the sport onto console, the most successful being the John Madden series on Megadrive. OOPS! YOU'RE SACKED ON THE THIRTY-FIVE YARD LINE. DOH! A new Madden game, a new set of challenges to take up. This time you can take your pick between playing one-on-one with a mate, teaming up with your mate against the computer (which isn't terribly easy) or those two sets of play-offs you can join. There's the standard best of seven, which sees yourself and six other teams battling it out to reach the final; alternatively there's the All-time Greats play-offs basically the same, but you're up against the best teams in American footballing history. All great fun but not what you'd call a breeze. Came Set Up P Mode Players Hatton PENGER TWO STRONG SIDES THIS IS GONNA BE ONE HELLUVA GAME! = = = Seeing as there's a wealth of what can only be regarded as huge people on the pitch all out for your blood, it's good to know that you have a few defensive moves to keep them at bay. Whilst running with the ball you can skip over tackles, hand-off challenges, turn around to try and shake off any particularly nasty advances or even dive for that extra yardage. You'll need to master the lot if you harbour any ideas of winning through to the ultimate Madden Challenge the Superbowl! #28 RUNS FOR 4 YARD LOSS This is a vast improvement over Madden '93 on the Megadrive, mainly because it's so much faster I'd actually say that this is the nippiest version to date. It whacks the original effort on the SNES right in the teeth, but then it deserves to. Graphically this is much better; sprites aren't blocky, scrolling is smooth and the little extras such as the action replay mode add that little bit extra to an already enjoyable sport sim. Even if you know nothing about American football and let's face it, who does you'll find yourself hooked by the title's all-action gameplay from the start. Electronic Arts have put themselves firmly back on the Super Nintendo sports sim map with John Maddens '93 hurrah!

"AG REVIEW PRO AMIGA PLATFORM BY MIRAGE .99 BEEBBIESEL YES, WE KNOW THERE WERE'NT ANY DINO'S THEN, BUT IT IS MORE FUN! HIGH SPEAR-ITS STERET To begin with your tribe are utterly thick, only knowing how to pick up objects and stand on one another's shoulders. Your first task is to help them discover the spear, which has a number of useful properties. For one it comes in handy for stabbing rival humans and fending off voracious dinosaurs a feat in itself, considering that the dinosaurs were wiped off the face of the Earth millions of years before the first man appeared. It also allows your people to pole-vault over chasms a feature which is essential on the following levels. HELP THE POST SIMIEN CARBON BASED BI-PEDS WITH YOUR 20th CENTURY WIT! BIG BOSS MAN HEL The Humans who lend their name to this game are in trouble. They're just starting out down the long road of evolution and they don't even know hoe to make a fire, let alone set the microwave to full power! You're given a tribe of these hopeless homosapiens to guide through various trials of life, including the discovery of fire and the wheel. It's not going to be all plain sailing, and the tribe must work as one if it harbours any thoughts of playing Streetfighter II in 8000 years time. The idea behind DECISIONS, Decisions Humans is essentially a sound one; that is, if you totally forget about all this dinosaurs nonsense because that lot had been iced millions of years previously. The game itself smacks very much of Lemmings, with the added advantage of being given much more control over the characters. What lets it down, though, is the lack of action. The early levels, although designed to introduce you to the controls, are a bit slow and, to be honest, the game never really picks up in pace. A lot has been made of the humourous aspect of Humans, but in fact this 'humour' is limited to a few small animations which in no way compensate for the frequently tedious tasks you must complete to see them. If you're into puzzle games Humans is worth taking a look at, but it was just too slow for me and lacked a hook to keep me coming back for more. PAUL RAND GRAPHICS % 75 SOUND % 82 GAMEPLAY % 73 VALUE Life can be very hard, not to mention short, for some members of your tribe. Not only do they face prehistoric hazards like wandering dinosaurs and lava, but one of their biggest threats comes from other humans. A misplaced spear hurled by another tribe member can be dangerous, but even more so is the Shaman. This mysterious character appears from nowhere to give your tribe a helping hand; by using his strange shamanic powers he can create objects out of thin air. There is a price to pay though, every time he uses his ability the Shaman demands a human sacrifice which is, understandably, not very popular with the surviving tribesmen. 3:06 KEYBOARD ANTICS As the Humans acquire more items and new skills, the icon bank at the bottom of the screen starts to pad out. These are accessed via the keyboard, with the space bar switching between them and Return activating the currently highlighted command. The function keys are also used to switch control between the Humans, and because the levels are time-limited it's essential to remember which key selects which character.

Unfortunately, for all it's revolutionary graphics, Pitfighter was a loser as a game and any interest it deserve to receive will by now be well used up. Fortunately this coin-op's got far more depth than the first, but it's still way off being a credible arcade master. The animation is jerky and game-play soon becomes boring after you learn which of the moves works best. It's worth sticking a few groats into the beast for a wiggle, but it won't enter your all-time faves list. STEVE KEEN GUARDIANS OF THE HOOD GUARDIANS OF THE 'HOOD ang warfare's not something we come into contact with very often over here; not unless you step into your local arcade, where it seems to be the theme of every arcade beat 'em up in existence. Big gangs of even bigger thugs have taken over your once-peaceful ghetto. Not content with routing them out and beating the innards out of them you've got to persuade the big wigs of organised crime to convert to your side, which really amounts to the same thing. Only then can you take on the masked monster imaginatively called Mr Big and return harmony to the streets. Yawn! ARCADE by ATARI 50P PER PLAY   Each fighter has a choice of buttons and joystick combinations. Muscle Power and Defend buttons plus the devastating Power Move combine to give each street brawler over 35 different moves. Although there aren't any 'magical powers to speak of, the ample variety of punches, kicks, throws, strangles and holds for each of the heroes makes up for any short fall. STRATEGY SKILL WHAWWAS WATE The machine can handle up to three players simultaneously and the screen's been widened to accommodate all the action. Fighters will have to combat thugs in a variety of situations. Brawl through the streets in a scrolling beat 'em up section or go head-to-head, one-on-one in a gym. The characters can use anything they can get their hands on from the scenes parking meters, dustbins, newspaper stands and even car bumpers can be ripped off the streets and turned into weapons! ACTION REFLEXES DONT FINK! FEEWL! GRAPHICS % 89 SOUND 82 GAMEPLAY % VALUE OVERALL 74 The tools of your trade are the four heroes Conner, Chief, Tanya and Javier. In addition, you can choose to control any one of three bad guys, once you've managed to take over their organisations and get them onto your side. Conner's an all-round good fighter trained in Thai boxing and karate he's incredibly fast. Chief's the big boy of the bunch. being at least twice the size of anyone else around he adds awesome power to any party. Tanya's the token girly with black belts in Taikwondo, Tai-Chi and Kung Fu. And lastly, Javier's a gold medal kick-boxer winner. GVG 096 "


"PVC otor bike racing games are ten a penny in arcades these days, but Moto Frenzy has taken the genre one step further as it's the world's first full-motion motorcycle simulation. There's no namby pamby circuit racing here all the action takes place off-road and across country! There are six stages to race through including LA, Maui, Utah, Las Vegas, Kenya and Norway. Each course has its own specific obstacles and weather conditions; dodge monster trucks in Los Angeles and rabid polar bears in Norway for the thrill of your life, but don't forget to strap up with plenty of padding! Here's something new! An arcade racer that actually lets you experience all the bumps and grinds of the real thing. You'd better make sure you're wearing some pretty heavy duty underwear before attempting to take on this baby, as things are tough! The bike is incredibly responsive and, although it's ridiculous to say that sitting on top of a moulded plastic shell with a TV monitor in your face is just like competing in a real racing contest, it almost is! Moto Frenzy is a lot of fun and if you can forget about the rather crappy motorcycle graphics and concentrate on the obstacles, track and movement of the bike under your bones you'll have a blast! The only problem is that you don't get a lot of action for your money, but ideally what you do get will depend on the tightfistedness of your local arcade manager. But whatever the time limit you'll want to come back for another go because Moto Frenzy is fierce! Great roaring sound effects too. STEVE KEEN SKATE AND CACK! The Moto Frenzy machine comes with a full-size hydraulically operated scramble bike bolted to it. Not only can you sit on it and hold the handle bars to race but the bike reacts exactly to what happens on the screen. The machine twists, pivots, skids, leans and even pulls wheelies whenever you pass over the onscreen obstacles and road hazards! TIME'S THE LIMIT The name of the game is speed as everything is against the clock. However, points are awarded for loads of other things and it's not all about the quickest kid on the block. Bonuses are awarded for completing laps and special scores are dished out for stunts performed above and beyond the call of duty! The whole thing amounts to the ride of your life! MOTO FRENZY ARCADE by ATARI 50P PER PLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 79 CREDITS TWO'S COMPANY 88 GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % % % % 86 Some arcades operate two Moto Frenzy arcade machines in link up and if you can find one that does it's worth dragging someone else down to play with you, even if you have to pay! In head-tohead competition players can race against each other and see where their opponent is on the screen at the same time. If one of you manages to qualify in the time allotted for the race it makes life, a hell of a lot easier as you'll both be allowed to go through to the next stage. OVERALL 89 CREDITS 097 CVG "

"FUE HOTSHOTS POWERMONGER SUPER NINTENDO Je may have been French and kept his hand hidden in his coat for long periTods of time, but there's no denying that Napoleon was a right good leader of men. Now, Electronic Arts offers Megadrivers the chance to be a world-class general without the burden of having to eat garlic! Powermonger allows you to control an army of people in search of a better life, by attacking towns, grabbing food and making frriends along your way. But there's more to it than that; for instance, you'll have to change the strength of your attacks according to what you want, 'cos after all, if you attack fiercely and kill everyone how are you going to recruit people for your army? TEEB TOOER COMLETED EUREKA! -590 As hard as you may be, your army's not going to get very far with their bare hands, so one aspect of Powermonger that you'll have to get very familiar with very quickly is the Invent icon. When you take over a village you inherit all of its resources and, provided you can persuade some clever inventors to join your merry throng, you can create all kinds of goodies, from spears to catapults. What is invented depends entirely on how clever your inventors are and what resources you've got if you're inventor is Steve Keen he's going to find it hard to get past the peashooter stage. THIS ICOD 18 SEDD CAPTAID THIS WILL SEND YOUR CAPTAID ANYWA NICE OR NASTY YOU CHOOSE SUC DOO NIFF The most important aspect of Powermonger is the battles. As in the real world, not all people are reasonable enough to hand over all their food at the drop a dime. There are three different postures for attack; there's Fierce, which basically entails marching in and killing anything that moves, the drawback to this being if you're trying to recruit there's no point in signing up a load of corpses. Passive means going in and killing a few, and the sad lad of the pack is Peaceful, where you try and persuade them to join your merry band of men. ICON DO IT WITH A BIT OF HELP With a mountain of icons to tangle with, it's good news to hear that there's an icon which will explain what the icons do! Simply click on the Help box and then go to whichever piccy you want to ask a ques tion about. You can also ask questions about stuff on the screen; try getting your army to fiercely attack a lone sheep and then ask what it is you will be told that it is a dead sheep. GVG 106 "

If you are currently using your Amiga or ST with a domestic television set, then you are missing out on picture quality. Unfortunately, because your TV is used to receiving inferior UHF transmissions from the airwaves, it only has a UHF socket. So, your computer has to downgrade its high quality digital RGB (Red, Green, Blue) signal to UHF to enable your TV to receive it. However, because your TV can only display using RGB, it has to convert the UHF signal back to RGB before it can put a picture on the screen. Of course, every time you convert from one signal to another, there is a loss of quality which means that the final picture on the TV is not as good as the original signal from your computer. You can overcome this with a monitor, which has an RGB socket, not UHF. Your computer will recognise this, and send its original RGB signal to the monitor which will display the image directly to the screen with no loss of quality. The Philips 8833 is the best selling colour monitor for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Ideal for game playing, it offers excellent colour graphics and has stereo audio speakers for enhanced stereo output from the Amiga and ST-E. The performance and reliability of the 8833 is exceptional, which is why we are confident to offer 12 months ON-SITE warranty with every Philips 8833 monitor.

"EU HOTSHOTS ROLO TO THE RESCUE MEGADRIVE O The latest offering from the top guys and gals at EA is a rather strange-sounding title by the name of Rolo To The Rescue. Having absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with chocolate-coated toffees, Rolo is a little elephant whose other animal chums and, more importantly, his mum have been kidnapped by the Evil McSmiley Twins. It's all down to the boy Rolo to go and rescue them, by using his many and various skills. Rolo can run, jump and use a number of different elephant-orientated weapons, one of which is a hoover which will turn Rolo's trunk into a vacuum, allowing him to suck up baddies and spit them at others. There seems to be a hell of a lot of depth to Rolo To The Rescue; not only can you rescue the animals, but you can control them as well! Each creature has a different ability; for example, if there's a wall blocking your way you can select the mole, who will burrow through it for you. Graphically, this is looking very cutesy, and the backdrops are simply stunning! This could be the successor to the excellent James Pond series of games it's designed by the same guywho created the fish-like secret agent! Feast your eyes on these here screens and we'll bring you the full CVG review next month! MEGADRIVE PGA TOUR Arguably the world's finest console golfing experience, PGA Tour Golf, has just been given a new lease of life with a sequel. The original game managed to capture the atmosphere of competitive golfing to a 'tee' with smart graphics and realistic golfing action. The revamped and remodelled successor has a host of new options, as well as three completely new courses and competitions. There's new graphics, new sound effects (including some sampled speech and crowd euphoria) and entirely new features like the Hole Browser, which is a remote control camera that \"flies' over the course and allows players to check out where potential hazards such as bunkers, trees and water lie. You can use the camera to zoom in and scrutinise the holes from absolutely any angle this feature is particularly useful on Skins, where you and a competitor compete against each other for a massive, purse on every hole of a course. This is certain to become an office favourite (especially as Steve still holds the record for the longest putt 156 feet! on PGA) and we can't wait to get our steaming hands on the finished product. PGA Tour Golf 2 looks stunning, and the full lowdown on its potential excellence will be revealed next month! Wind .

"W HOTSHOTS RISKY WOODS MEGADRIVE COCO The evil lord Draxos has turned all the monks to stone, threatening the existence of the Risky Woods. And exactly how does petrifying a bunch of slap-heads endanger the future of a small tree plantation? Well it turns out that rather than hanging out with choir boys and getting up early for morning prayers, these holy boys spent their time battling undead and slamming the door on any demon foolish enough to come through the gateway to hell. But with the monks out of the way, evil runs rampant through the woods and only Rohan, a young warrior, can free them and save the copse from the corpses! The result is a platform-battler, as Rohan searches the woods and surrounding lands for the monks, while smiting any undead miscreants who cross his path. Certain areas are guarded by mysterious gatekeepers who will only let him pass if he brings them a key, then repeats a tune. Fortunately, there are only four different notes which are played by pushing the D-pad in certain directions, so even the tone deaf should be able to manage it. When a creature is destroyed it mysteriously drops a metal disc which Rohan can collect and, by using his mysterious warrior powers, he can join them together to make a suit of armour. Along the way our hero can increase his arsenal Ghouls 'n Ghosts style, by collecting weapons icons which appear after shooting chests. The CVG boys have seen a Beta test version of the game, which first saw the light of day in floppy form on the Amiga. We thought it quite a laugh then does it stand up in cartridge form? Stay tuned to CVG and find out! DAVD CRANE'S AMAZING TINNIS SUPER NINTENDO kr   oorlock We may be one of the most lethargic countries on the planet, but when it comes to Wimbledon week we go absolutely crazy! The aim of Amazing Tennis is to keep that interest up for a whole year by being the most realistic tennis game there's ever been and, whilst there's nothing new in the gameplay area, Amazing Tennis certainly looks the part with huge animated sprites, coupled with a whole bag-full of options. There are three court surfaces to choose from hard, grass and clay and fifteen different world-ranking opponents to cause a raquet with. You can get to grips in a head-to-head smash spread over three sets, or go the whole hog in a bid for fame and glory in the knockout tournament. For all the extras it's the super smooth aniLLLL LLLLLLL mation and movement of the ball that make Amazing Tennis look like it'll knock the compeWhere tallbegi tition for six. Sound effects are awesome, with loads of realistic Thwacks! and Thuds!, as well as speech taken directly from the lips of a professional abuse-resistant umpire! Not only that, there's a handy video replay facility that lets you rewind the action and play it over again in slow motion great if you want to examine your style of play and the 'tape' can be played forwards and backwards so that you're able to see every movement! Lobs, volleys, slice and top-spin are just a few of the shots available to contenders you can even choose to be a left or right-handed player! This one looks as though it might topple the incredible Super Tennis from it's perch wait and see next month! alles GVG 110 "
