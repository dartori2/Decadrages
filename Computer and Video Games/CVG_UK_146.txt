"TEILSA tari put on its best blue business suit for the official world launch of the Jaguar. The event took place on the 48th floor of the Time-Life building in Manhattan and had that in-yerface approach that Americans dismiss as showbiz. CVG was there. BIG APPLE LAUNCH FOR THE JAGUAR JAGUAR ddressing the 120-strong delegation of joumaises, developers and retailers at the recent New York launch of the Jagwaa' (that's how they pronounce it over there) was Sam Tramiel, President of Atari. Tramiel told the computer and video game industry representatives how the promotional campaign for the 64bit console wil rip at the guts of the Jag's 16-bit rivals. Also on his agenda were some new details about a CD drive for the machine which is planned for 1994, and about an even more powerful Jaguar Mark 2 for 1996, he even hinted that one day there might even be a Jaguar computer. This is a still from the Jaguar telly ad campaign, which you'll no doubt see when the 30,000 machines en route to Europe actually get here. PAIDEN 2028 Raiden. This verticallyscrolling coinop has already been seen on the SNES, Mega drive and PC Engine. Atari allege that the conversion to the Jaguar will be the most accurate yet. JAGUAR 2 60 JAGUAR Jaguar the 64-bit console. Not to be confused with the 6.4 litre car of the same name. Silmarils is converting Robinson's Requiem, its Amiga and PC sci-fi game, on to Jaguar. Set on a distant planet in the future, you play a hunted man in an astral prison. The variety of terrains in the game should give more than enough scope for the Jaguar's texture mapping magic. BORN IN THE U.S. OF A. Extra large helpings of mom's apple pie were served at the press launch. Atari pointed out it had made sure that everyone who buys the Jaguar will see the words \"Made in the USA' plastered all over the box. Apparently, it's all to do with Americans feeling miffed about the Japanese approach to doing business ARA c 1.OK "


"KEY TO SUCCESS The shindig's main purpose, though, was to demonstrate Atari's commitment to the Jaguar. It was also an opportunity to thank Toys 'R' Us and other daft-named chain stores, such us as We Love the Wiz, who are stocking the Atari machine as part of a number of do-or-die sales pushes in and around New York and San Francisco; it's here where success will be crucial. Studios, claimed: \"We think that the Jaguar is a great machine that has great game power. Return to Zork will be the best adventure game on that platform». Hardly an unbiased opinion, but a chink in the wall of silence that has so far been the response from the software industry to the launch of the hot, new console. THE BIG CHEESE Atari's President, Sam Tramiel, announced a cut in price for the CD drive, due to be launched early next year, down from $200 to around $150: \"I'd like to keep the price as competitive as possible. We can do that because the drive will be dumb in so far that everything it needs memory-wise will already be located in the Jaguar.\" MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 cartridges will be produced, allowing owners to watch music videos and CD movies owned by Atari collaborator, Time Warner (of Batman fame). NEW GAMES The big news of the night however, concerned the string of software houses who have now signed up Sam Tramiel, Atari President and big 3DO fan (as if). to develop on the Jaguar: Activision, Virgin Interactive Entertainment, UBI soft, Gremlin, MicroProse, Accolade and 21st Century will be publishing some of their best-known titles for the Atari machine. Expect to see Return to Zork, Battle Chess, Jimmy Connor's Tennis and Zool along with big-name football and pinball conversions from Imagineer and 21st Century respectively. Howard Marks, Chairman of Activision Tiny Toon Adventures for the Jag will be based on the Warner Bros characters. Licences of Warner products are easier for Atari to come by as the two companies have longstanding connections. COULD IT BE MAGIC? 3, DOMARK: 081-780 1540 Some of the dudes Marko is gonna have to play ball with in his forthcoming game. HIFIDELITY GAME SOUNDS omark is blowing its whistle at its latest title currently in development. Marko's Magic Football rolls on the lines of Soccer Kid from Krisalis: a little kid is out on an adventure blasting baddies with his ball instead of a machine-gun or something. Due out in March '94 for the Mega Drive and Game Gear, with Marko himself set to become Domark's new mascot. PS INTERPLAY: 0865 390029 INNOCENT ANIMALS WERE USED AS TEST SUBJECTS, DOMARK MARKOS MAGIC FOOTBALL ed up with crap sounding games? Interplay, the name behind the likes of Rock 'n' Roll Racing, Lost Vikings and Robocop Vs Terminator on the SNES would like you all to know that its SNES games have the best quality sound possible (and we agree!) Using a new system called ARDI the company has succeeded in producing hifidelity samples and effects. The music in The Lost Vikings is probably the company's finest moment, so if you've connected your SNES up to a hi-fi, tune in. Soccer KielMarko Magic sprites practising ball control. Separated at birth? Marko's Magic Football looks very similar to Soccer Kid. Don't you think? "

So, check out the next six pages to find out what are the real Christmas crackers... S 2000. Umilli "


"_78600 CONTINUE POP 'N' TWINBEE SNES This is reminiscent of that old fave Parodius and is basically a top and rather weird two-player shoot-'em-up. The graphics feature beautifully drawn sprites which are packed with humour. There's also some typically console-esque soundtracks. A tough challenge is guaranteed by the relentless aliens who simply never give up. In fact Paul even went so far as to warn virgin shoot-'em-uppers to stay away from this game in case they got frustrated by \"dying for the umpteenth time.\" But Randy also said this game is worth persevering with because only then will you discover how good it is. BATMAN RETURNS MEGA-CD The Mega-CD's first foray into the game-of-the-film genre, Batman Returns casts you as Batman (surprisingly enough) as you try to clear his name after being set up by the despicable Penguin. Unfortunately for Penguin, Batman isn't interested in proving his innocence lawyer style and has decided the best way to clear his name is to beat up all the Penguin's henchmen and then take on fat boy himself. The CD game is based on the excellent cartridge version so it obviously had a lot going for it anyway. The game is divided into two main sections, a platform style beat-'em-up and the excellent driving section, where you get to control the Batmobile and the Batskiboat. The graphics on the driving section in particular are stunning, and the whole game is bathed in fantastic CD music taken straight from the movie. Great fun and a must-have if you haven't already got the cartridge game. .99 by KONAMI 081-429 2446 REVIEWED: JULY ISSUE Page 34 .99 by SEGA 071-373 3000 REVIEWED: JULY ISSUE Page 40 LEMMINGS LYNX Yes please! This is a perfect conversion of the Amiga original and is simply a delight to play on the excellent Lynx. For those of you new to the planet here's the idea of the game. Take some Lemmings and guide them through 100 levels to safety. Sounds easy doesn't it? Unfortunately I forgot to mention all manner of traps and natural hazards out to kill the loveable Lemmings. Luckily you can give them skills like bridge building to help them on their way. Sounds simple and it is, but it's a true classic and will appeal to everyone whether they are puzzle fans or not. THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND-PC CD-ROM The first of the new breed of Lucasfilm adventures and still a complete and utter classic made all the more excellent without all those horrible floppy disks to play with. As Guybrush Thweepwood, aspiring pirate, it's your job to crack the mysterious secret of Monkey Island in order to be accepted as a proper plunderer of the high seas. The graphics show their age a little but are still more than worthy of praise, however it's the gameplay that will keep you captivated until finished. The puzzles are terrific but always logical so there's none of the 'give the plastic bag to the mongrel rubbish that you get with some adventures. Special mention has to go to the humour. You wouldn't believe Americans could be so funny .99 by PSYGNOSIS 051-709 5755 REVIEWED: JULY ISSUE Page 20 OF GO! MORTAL KOMBAT MEGA DRIVE .99 by LUCASFILM 021-625 3366 REVIEWED: JULY ISSUE Page 108 93 STRIKER SNES Get over here! I'm a sad man and missed out on the Streetfighter buzz because for some obscure reason 1 didn't think it was much cop at the time. By the time I realised what a good game it was I was too embarrassed to to play it as everyone else was so good. Luckily I didn't make the same mistake with Mortal Kombat and fortunately Acclaim has done the business in converting this to the Mega Drive (and indeed every other format). All the gore is there as are all the special moves. It's got all the top playability too, so snap it up soon Goro else! Surprisingly enough this a football game and probably one of the best on the SNES. If you've not seen it in the flesh, ignore any screenshots you may have seen because they don't do this game justice. Basically the developers should be commended for coming up with an original graphic angle. It's difficult to explain but imagine the view that you'd get sitting in a tank as it climbs a mountain and you'd be halfway there. There's lots of options (including playing five-a-side indoors), good graphics and FX and a mountain of gameplay. If there's one fault it's that the ball does tend to stick to your feet a little but hey, it's a minor point. This is a worthy challenger to the Sensi crown. .99 by ACCLAIM 071-344 5000 REVIEWED: AUGUST ISSUE Page 48 .95 by ELITE 0922 55852 REVIEWED: AUGUST ISSUE Page 54 13 "


"GAMES ROUNDUP PIPI STREETS OF RAGE 2 GAME GEAR The original was a classic and this is, ahem, streets better. Axel and Blaze are back from the first game, but Adam's been taken prisoner by Mr X so his younger brother Skates takes his place, and it's up to all of them to battle through six levels (each divided into a number of stages) to get him back. Amazingly enough Skates is blessed with rollerskating powers which makes a change from the usual mega fist-type rubbish these heroes usually process. In fact each character now has at least 15 moves and there's also loads of weapons to pick up . This is the best beat-'em-up you'll find on a handheld it even gives Streetfighter 2 a bit of a fright. .99 by SEGA 071-373 3000 REVIEWED: AUGUST ISSUE GO! Page 10 94 JIMMY CONNORS' TENNIS LYNX RANGER X MEGA DRIVE Despite being the best handheld by 300 miles or so Atari's machine seems destined to have sand kicked in its face by the other handhelds for all eternity. And yet games like Jimmy Connors' Tennis only add to the mystery of why the Lynx hasn't been a success.JCT has stacks of playability. Admittedly the game is slow moving but this adds to the gameplay as you get some time to plan your moves. It's not an easy game but, hey, that adds to the value, 'cos it's gonna take a while to become as good as Connors! The game features a two player option and some rather realistic speech, so snap it up pronto! CE Doom, doom, doom... The world lies ravaged by a Great War. Those 'lucky' people that remain, however, have discovered a mysterious alien device which will enable them to sort out the trouble. However, only a girl called Nina can make sense of the TRUP FOLIE alien jargon. And yes you guessed it, she's been kidnapped by the evil Ogiiwise who's got his own nasty plans for the artifact. Luckily Nina's childhood sweetheart, Kenta Kazimo stumbles across the assault suit known as Ex-Ranza. Cue lots of power-ups, blasting action all accompanied by brilliantly loud rock soundtracks which result in this being one of the best blasters to appear on the Mega Drive in recent months. Deserves your attention pronto. .99 by ATARI 0753 533344 REVIEWED: AUGUST ISSUE GO! Page 22 (90 KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE GAME GEAR .99 by SEGA 071-373 3000 REVIEWED: AUGUST ISSUE Page 64 Whoa, momma! Krusty's fun house has been overrun by rats and it's up to the Simpsons to kill all the nasty rodents. What this boils down is a Lemmings style puzzle epic where you control Krusty as he attempts to guide the rodents to a trap that one of the Simpson family has set up in each room. Objects to manipulate the rats' direction include blocks, fans, springs and transporter pipes which blast them around the screen. It's not all easy going for Krusty though, as all sorts of yucky critters lurk around in the rats' smelly domain including snakes and flying pigs. The game provides a massive challenge with five huge sections each divided into 14 ) rooms so value and lastability score highly. The graphics and gameplay are a delight (it's based on Lemmings so that's to be expected) but the sound stinks with some well cheesy music. That's only a minor niggle, however, and overall this is another brilliant platformer for the Sega handheld. . SYNDICATE — AMIGA Here's one for strategy fans. Syndicate is set in a grimy, cyberpunk world where you control a bunch of zombies as they do all sorts of nasty spy-type stuff in order to make your syndicate the most powerful in the world. Has some morally questionable gameplay, so not suitable for the very young. (American Revolt data disk now available. GUI .99 by ACCLAIM 071-344 5000 REVIEWED: AUGUST ISSUE GO!

"GAMES ROUNDUP PRINCE OF PERSIA 2 THE SHADOW AND THE FLAME PC Prince of Persia. Nice game that, best remembered for its stunning animation. And the gameplay was pretty hot too. Now, too many years later, comes the sequel which is more of the same and then some. The great animation is still there and the background graphics are now equally stunning with a lovely use of colour. The story is the usual swashbuckling type and features tons of villains (who are as well animated as our Prince) as well as loads of traps and puzzles, and most importantly variety and therefore long lasting gameplay. FIRE FIGHTER GAME BOY Aaawhooo! Fire's broken out all over the the city and lucky old Eric is the only one who is talented enough to fight it. Ten major blazes have to be doused and the luckless civilians trapped inside rescued before people can sleep easy in their beds once more. What we've got here is your standard Nintendo platform romp (in other words it's pretty good!). All sorts of hazards are out to stop you quashing the fires. On the office level for example, ringing telephones and manic swivel chairs have to be avoided. There's all the usual bits and pieces to help you out though, including a trusty axe which you can use to turn the offending items to matchwood. A tricky puzzle element comes into play on the later levels where switches need to be manipulated in order to get lifts and electronic doors working. The gameplay is fast and frantic but never frustrating thanks mainly to the jolly control mode.

It's a sequel to a Jurassic Lucasarts game called Maniac Mansion which appeared back in the late Eighties. It starred a nutty professor called Dr Fred Edison who's up to more mischief. Not content with creating two weird tentacle creatures he's also managed to invent a machine entirely devoted to flooding rivers with toxic waste. A purple tentacle drinks some sludge which turns it into a super-being who wants to control the world. Big problem, especially when the only people who can save the world are nerdy computer boffin Bernard, twitchy medical student Laverne and fat heavy metal roadie Hoagie. Mad but never frustrating puzzles, heaps of speech, groovy tunes and awesome sound effects make this simply the best adventure game ever. STREETFIGHTER 2 TURBO: HYPER FIGHTING SNES .99 by US GOLD 021-625 3366 REVIEWED: SEPT ISSUE Page 46 95 ECCO THE DOLPHIN GAME GEAR Do I need to explain this. I think not. OK then but only quickly. Chief differences are that you can choose to play the bosses or to play the game in turbo mode (ie bloody fast!) and the characters themselves have also been tweaked to give you a more rounded game than before. Oh and you can play the same characters head to head. The game has good graphics and sound but fanincredigimongoutastic (Wha? -Ed.) gameplay is what continues to shift this beauty. It was  when released on import and still sold heaps so the official UK release is likely to do the same considering it's  less. Get it. Sega's 16-bit original of this game was a real corker and nothing has been lost in this sequel to the handheld. Playing Ecco the Dolphin it's up to you to rescue your fishy friends who've all been sucked up into the sky. This involves lots of swimmy swimmy-type scenarios as Ecco darts about solving puzzles while avoiding nasties like crabs and piranhas. One of the most fun parts of the game is remembering to return Ecco to the surface so he can top up on air. If this isn't done he'll end up more blue than the ocean he's swimming about in. A cute and fun game for all the family with decent graphics, sound and playability. You'll think it's a Mega Drive you're holding. .99 by CAPCOM REVIEWED: SEPT ISSUE Page 34 95 .99 by SEGA 071-373 3000 REVIEWED: SEPT ISSUE GO! Page 6 16 "

"GAMES ROUNDUP the world's most famous fish spy to sort things out by battling through all manner of wild and crazy platform antics. The idea is to run through six levels and bounce on the heads of the baddies while picking up all the penguins found on each stage. Pond can run, jump and now stretch himself to ridiculous lengths in order to grab those out-of-reach platforms. Pond 2 is a classic game with fine graphics, sound and playability. Randy said of it: «the best Game Gear game of the year.» And you know what? He could well be right. KEVIN KEEGAN'S PLAYER MANAGER SNES Keegan is a suitably top manager and he deserved a suitably top game, and boy did he get it with this. Essentially a tarted up game of the floppy classic Player Manager. This of course means you get the rather dishy Kick Off and the equally sexy Player Manager merged together in one essential package. No the graphics aren't very hot and the sound is fairly basic, but it's the wealth of options and the massive, long lasting and very enjoyable challenge which will fill you with joy. A classic mix of strategy and action. .99 by US GOLD 021-625 3366 REVIEWED: OCT ISSUE GO!

This houses both the Championship Edition (where you can play the bosses) and the Turbo enhancements, plus loads more bits and pieces unique to this version, most notably a rather nice Match/Elimination option. In the match option players have a single bout to decide who's master, while in elimination it's down to the winner of the most bouts. Any character's special moves can be disabled to handicap players who rely too heavily on one tactic. There's also a choice of 10 speeds to play the game at. Graphics, sound (apart from the odd bit of crackly speech) and gameplay especially are all fanin credigimongoutastic (Again? Ed!). So you know what to do. Surely this needs less of an explanation than Streetfighter 2! I mean where have you been? What you get on this bargain-tastic cart is the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Bros 3 and Mario the Lost Levels (originally a Japan-only disk product and it's bloody tough!).

This takes the form of a database and tells you all you'd possibly want to know about dolphins. Who said video-games weren't educational? The best of the Robocop/ Terminator licences by far. Ignore the plot (basically because it's dodgy to say the least) and instead get stuck into some massive destruction, wicked graphics, endless gameplay and noisy, noisy sound all strung together with a sensible learning curve. The only down side of this game is that you can't play the Terminator. Boo Hoo! Still it's brilliant fun being old Robo-features himself.

"graphics and sound are not exactly stunning, but the well fast action hockey gameplay sure is.

Buy this it's fabbo, but don't bother if you've got one of the previous versions because there's not a lot of difference. the dinosaurs locked up. Graphics are very realistic (especially the 3D sections on a PC) and the sound is rather atmospheric also. Heaps of gameplay is guaranteed because of the numerous and varied puzzles which need to be worked out.

The game allows control of Luke, Han Solo and Chewie as they battle through most of the action scenes from the film including fighting the AT-ATs (check out the most excellent use of Mode 7), taking on asteroids and TIE fighters and learning all those essential Jedi tricks with smelly Yoda on Dagobah. This game is essential for lovers of good games with its brilliantly fun gameplay. The graphics are great throughout and apart from the Mode 7 effects the animation is also rather dreamy. Sound too is great, especially the rousing interpretation of the score. All in all essential stuff and the nearest you're likely to get to an interactive version of the film on the trusty SNES. One for floppy owners to stick their tongues out at their console owning friends, 'cos Jurassic Park is much better on computer. The game combines a Chaos Enginestyle overhead perspective game and a 3D, RPG-type adventure. The overhead view involves rescuing John Hammond's grandchildren from the clutches of dinosaurs, while the 3D section links the different levels, and is also where the Park's power supply needs to be reconnected in order to keep TI! .99 by JVC 081-570 6015 REVIEWED: NOV Page 58 58 DESERT STRIKE LYNX Each machine has its own game that has boosted sales and if there's any justice in the world then this conversion of the Mega Drive classic should be one such game for the Lynx. It's a fine interpretation with some of the best graphics I've seen on a handheld, and the sound isn't that bad either. For those of you new to the scene here's the plot. Destroy a Middle Eastern dictator by flying loadsa missions that range from rescuing spies to blasting the dictator's boat. Top playability is guaranteed because there's a large variety in the missions and you have great control over your Apache. This is what you could call a thinking man's shoot-'em-up since it's not all blast, blast, blast; there's a great deal of strategy required if you don't want to end up blown out of the sky, or end up running out of armour.

The graphics and sound aren't too hot, but the gameplay is an absolute scorcher. This is partly because of the game's realism in that it includes just about every feature and cup you could possibly want, although I hope they introduce injuries in any planned sequel. However, it's the fantastic control which will hook, line and sinker you, it's just so simple you'll be scoring goals in no time. It's possible to be unbelievably precise and accurate with your passing and shooting. Quite simply this is my all time favourite game, a joy to play and should not be missed at any cost. FRONTIER ELITE 2 PC A sequel that was years (five to be precise) in the making. It was worth the wait though because Elite was amazing, but you run out of superlatives to describe the sequel. The aim of the game is to travel the universe trading (buying goods cheap on one planet and flying off to another base and selling them off for more pennies. This game is huge and has infinite possibilities (and it all fits on to just two disks), has gameplay coming out of its nose and ears and will probably make the rest of your software collection obsolete. .99 by SONY 071-734 5151 REVIEWED: DEC ISSUE Page 30 94 sir TOD .99 by GAMETEK 0753 553445 REVIEWED: DEC ISSUE Page 52 FIFA MEGA DRIVE PINBALL FANTASIES AMIGA As game genres go, one of the most addictive has to be pinball simulators — probably, they're such a simple concept, but you just keep on coming back for more. And Pinball Fantasies on the Amiga is an excellent genre example; it utilises the A1 200's AGA chip set to good effect, with the four tables being redrawn and touched up (ooer) so that they have a quite fantastic feel about them. One of the most accurate pinball sims that's available, and the most realistic one or my name's not Elton John. (By the way only half of that last sentence was true.) Not the highest scoring footie game on the Mega Drive (that goes to Sony's Sensi) but worth a mention because it is just as stunning, though it abandons the overhead perspective that Sensi has and gone for an altogether different isometric viewpoint. FIFA is very playable, the goalies are very responsive and the sounds are very realistic.

Cool Spot's a fairly standard platform affair set over 11 distinct stages, but it plays very fluidly thanks to super character control and lovely graphics with great collision detection.

"WORD UP WITH PAUL here's a lot going on in this little old industry of ours at the moment. The console boys continue to dominate the market, but for how long? With so many new machines hitting the streets between now and Spring, Sega and Nintendo are going to find it increasingly difficult to stay at the top of the tree. Which may not be good news for S&N, but will hopefully mean that, because of the quantity of systems available, the market will get more dogeat-dog and, as a result, we should see more diverse and, more importantly, more exciting games appearing, especially on CD formats. As you'll see when you flick through this issue, there's some mighty fine things occurring on the compact disc front. 3DO's Crash And Burn looks promising, Liberation on CD32 is a brilliant game and, in our opinion, the way that the media should be being used and, in our special feature this month, we finally get our hands on Digital Video! Across the board, the scope for innovation is becoming wider, and it's getting ever more difficult to make a choice.

They look good, but are badly animated. Sound is, on the whole, average and a couple of good tunes stand out from the crowd, but your engine sounds like someone's strangling a cat! The game is enjoyable, and there's a choice of different cars, water on the tracks to complicate driving and, obviously, the ability to blow away the opposition, but I'd like to have seen a debut game with a bit of meat on its bones, gameplay-wise. PROS: Absolutely stunning 3D graphics. Car pet If you do manage to get yourself banged about, at the end of each lap there's a pit stop which you can drive into to initiate repairs to your car and the reloading of your weaponry. Finish the entire race and you're given stats on your position, the amount of kills you managed and the best lap time. CONS: Unresponsive controls and generally lacklustre gameplay.

The graphics are promising, the full motion video is stunning (but let's hope 3DO doesn't become a home to failed actors) and the sound comprises cliched rock ditties and an engine noise that resembles a wasp with a stomach problem. Gameplay is exciting with the tournament option helping lastability, but you can feel detached while playing and the weapons do not seem as if they are causing any real damage.

"3DO, MEGA DRIVE, MEGA-CD, SNES As in the film, Spartan goes in all guns blazing. Taken from the 3DO version, Demolition Man looks superb! by VIRGIN TBA PREVIEW SPRING RELEASES Stage of Development 60% Complete DEMOLITION MAN Sgt John Spartan is crushed between a big futuristic thing in a scene from the movie. Get ready for the small screen version of the BIG Christmas action movie! t's the biggest action movie of the year and it's coming to a machine near you soon! Demolition Man, starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, is currently clearing up at the box office, and it was only a matter of time before someone snapped up the rights to produce a game of the film as a matter of fact, Virgin has been working away on the game for some time now, and we have the pictures to prove it! Spartacus If you haven't seen the film, Demolition Man revolves around Sgt John Spartan of the Los Angeles Police Department. Known as the Demolition Man for his skill at destroying buildings when on patrol, Spartan is cryogenically frozen as punishment for the deaths of 20 hostages, held by criminal lunatic Simon Phoenix (Snipes) who is also frozen. But when Phoenix is revived in the 21st century and starts a reign of terror, the authorities revive Spartan to deal with the threat. What this leads to is action, Hopefully, Virgin will be ensuring Sly doesn't have the mumps in the finished version as he does in this early screenshot. Not the most sane lad in the world; Wesley Snipes plays psychotic Simon Phoenix in the movie and game of Demolition Man. 34 "


"WHAT ABOUT THE MOVIE? Believe it or nof, this is a shot from the 3DO version... guns and a high body count which has the punters baying for more. pawny gets that we are, the CVG team blagged their way onto a hushhush press screening a whole week before the official release of the movie, and frankly we weren't disappointed. We thought that Stallone's other movie of 1993, Cliffhanger, was a bit poor. But boy, were we in for a surprise with Demolition Man! Sly is back to his guntoting best, but this time he's not a Vietnam vet in some dodgy jungle, he's an LA cop in 1996 who gets cryogenically frozen for a crime he didn't commit, along with his sworn enemy, Simon Phoenix. Jump to the year 2032; Los Angeles has linked with a host of other states to become San Angeles, the world is a safer, cleaner, more naive place where ...and this is from the Mega Drive game! Don't push me Planned for Mega Drive, SNES, MegaCD and 3DO, Demolition Man has 12 action-packed levels two are based in the LA of 1996, where Spartan must track down Phoenix, with the rest spread over the new state of San Angeles in 2032. Here, Spartan and Phoenix are defrosted, and Phoenix's henchmen from the 20th century are also on the rampage. You play the good sergeant and it's your job to hunt down the Cryo-Cons on each level. The stages are taken directly from the movie, so you'll find yourself battling it out in the LA warehouse where Phoenix has the hostages stashed; then it's on to the museum where your enemy finds a power laser gun, then through the Taco Bell and a meeting with Francis, one of the Cryo-Con endof-level baddies, and beyond. action-a-plenty, with plenty of baddies to waste and lots of different weapons and other pick-ups. At the time of going to press, it hasn't been totally decided whether the original music from the movie will be included, but on the graphics side, as the Mega Drive and 3DO shots shown here prove, things are looking good. When it comes to the crunch, though, it'll depend upon whether Virgin can include the non-stop thrills and spills of the film into the videogame versions that will determine whether or not Demolition Man is going to be a hit. We'll be keeping you posted, so don't go away! Down in the sewers in Mega Drive Demolition Man. Operation Sly While the cartridge versions take the form of traditional platform arcade blasts, the Mega-CD and 3D0 games are presented in the Operation Wolf/Lethal Enforcers-style, with a first-person perspective, horizontally scrolling view. Both versions promise everything is automated, everyone is nice to each other and you get fined for swearing. It's in this period that Phoenix is released from captivity to wreak havoc on society. The 21st Century cops can't handle him, so the only solution is to reawaken Sgt John Spartan AKA Stallone. What ensues is the sort of mindless action and gun-toting violence that had up until recently been Schwarzenegger's forte until he went soft. Demolition Man is packed with top special effects and good one-liners, and the battling hardly lets up. There's bodies galore and, although it won't leave a lasting impression, it's a film that you'll be glad you didn't miss CVG RATING The enemies will all have their own artificial intelligence; they'll dodge bullets, hide behind objects and try to trick you. 35 "

This old timer warns you of the dangers that await you. Two player action is available and there is also a continue option, which allows you to carry on playing exactly where you last left off. Your score is reset to zero, though, so don't think there's a chance of creating an awesome scoreline! caree Crazy pup What's it all about though? Well, it's not exactly going to tax your grey matter. Mad Dog and his mean mob have kidnapped the town's mayor and his daughter.

To help you get used to the control system there is a practice mode where you have to shoot a number of bottles off a fence. The on-screen cursor can be set at three speeds to make dispensing of baddies as painless as possible. 99 GAMEPLAY 5 VALUE Don't worry about being shot. You get three seconds to avoid any incoming bullets! With the cursor being so unresponsive it's nearly impossible to beat baddies when they show more than one at a time. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT Quite possibly one of the worst games ever. Graphics and sound are OK, but Mad Dog has no gameplay. Weapon 'control' is non-existent and once you manage a shot you'll think it's a time-freeze raygun you're holding, not a six-shooter. Every time a shot is fired there's a horrid pause while the CD chugs away; on the bottle screens it can take three seconds for a bottle to explode once hit. And as you can restart the game where you die the game can be completed in one go. Complete trash. ONWU VOO ILLU 58 RIK SKEWS Can you possibly draw your gun as slowly as Mr Blocky Pixel here?

REBEL ASSAULT Darth Vader and the Empire return in the first CD-only game from the people at LucasArts. Is this the future of CD gaming or what? VOL VCO on Rookie One (you) have crashed your snowspeeder and must make it to the base on foot. 9MAGE SCORE 002580 Above: It's one of the most famous film sequences of all time, the desperate and ill-fated rebel attack on the Imperial Walkers. I'm going in Yee-haaaaaaaa! Left: The arcade action is seamlessly linked together by a series of stunning animated sequences. We're talking movie-quality stuff here, you should see this move! ou can often tell how popular a game is by the size of the crowd gathered around it. For example, Day of the Tentacle (or DOTT as we call it in the 'biz') drew a good crowd of six when I played it. Now six is a good showing, but when I sat down to play Rebel Assault, with the lights turned off and the music cranked up loud, a crowd of no less than 15 of my colleagues gathered to watch me! Rebel Assault is quite simply breathtaking, featuring full motion video effects, superb TV quality animation and the famous stirring Star Wars soundtracks. This game has atmosphere by the ton, whether you're attacking Imperial Walkers, VERDICT THE STORY SO FAR... Playing Rebel Assault is just like watching a movie (apart from the fact that you can actually take part in the battles). After the Rebels flee from Tatooine, they secret themselves away on the ice planet Hoth. Unfortunately as you know, old dark helmet himself sends out probe droids to detect their presence. The battle for Hoth is split into three different sections, namely pursuing the probe droid through the ice caves, fighting the AT-AT walkers and shooting stormtroopers in the empty rebel base. Only once you've succeeded in these three missions can you jump into your trusty X-Wing and flee to Yavin. This is without a doubt the best, the most wondrous, the most hugely atmospheric game l've played in a long while. Forget your SNES, chuck out your Mega-CD because the PC has finally arrived. Playing Rebel Assault is just like watching the Star Wars movies. Dodge TIE Fighters, attack huge star destroyers and zoom down that famous Death Star trench. How can I go back to non-CD games after this? Even at , if you've got a CD drive I can't recommend Rebel Assault highly enough. PAUL RAND "


"PC CD-ROM VERDICT Stupendous, superb, brilliant, er, awesome, amazing and astounding. These are just a few of the words that tried to get out of my mouth when I first saw Rebel Assault. It's an astonishing game that finally goes some way to proving the real power of the CD format. I only have one criticism and that is that maybe it's a bit too easy. I finished it in under two days, top rebel pilot like I am, but despite this I will not hesitate to recommend it. I mean it is an arcade game after all and it's high scores that are important. resemblance to X-Wing as a Maserati does to a Lada. As an arcade game it takes about three different forms, namely the in-cockpit view, the 'chaseplane' type view and the running about in the ice tunnels sequence. These levels or chapters (of which there are 15) are linked seamlessly together with some of the most glorious cutscenes you or I have ever seen. They are absolutely superb. PROS: Everything a CD game should be. CONS: Possibly a bit too easy. DENIZ AHMET Breathless I can honestly say that of all the CD games I've seen on the PC, Rebel Assault is quite simply breathtaking. It boasts superb graphics and even some gameplay as well, which is more than can be said of the 7th Guest or the other big CD release, Microcosm. If ever there was a game that will shift CD-ROM drives, then Rebel Assault is it. Wow, cor and blimey. This is stunning stuff. flying through asteroid fields or fending of TIE Fighters over the surface of the Death Star GRAPHICS Utterly wondrous. TV quality images that move at TV speeds. Wow. Shut up then Rebel Assault isn't just about flying. No sir, in Rebel Assault you get to be a pedestrian too. It's so good in fact that I'm going to keep this review short and concise so our wonderful design staff can squash more pictures in. I can get away with this because Rebel Assault is essentially an arcade game, a shoot-'em-up to be more precise, and is a game that bears as much The sound is superb. Sampled from the London Symphony Orchestra no less. PILOTS WOW ANTEN Hmmm. It's a touch limited but once the music starts who cares! The rebel base on Hoth has been overrun. You've got to shoot the troopers and escape. It's not a difficult game but it's the best CD game on the market. And it's Star Wars. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES If you manage to fire the torpedoes at the Death Star you've won. Cue wild applause. IIIIIIIIIII Having escaped from the Hoth, you're called to defend a transport under attack by TIEs. ONWA CAN YOU FEEL THE FORCE? MISSOK HIT! Like X-Wing, Rebel Assault culminates in the battle to destroy the Death Star. First you've got to fight off wave upon wave of TIE fighters and then you lock X-foils in attack position and dive on to the surface. After destroying a few surface installations, you've got to neutralise a laser cannon near the trench. This means knocking out its blue shielding and diving down right inside to disable its power relays. When you've done this, you can get down there in the trench and try and fire that lucky shot. Use the force and all that. This is it. Stay tight. The attack on the Death Star is the hardest and most atmospheric part. 41 "

"JAGUAR by ATARI FREE WITH JAGUAR Contact Atari (0753 533344) for information. Flying through those gorgeous vector shaded caverns gives an awesome effect. Just don't hit them or you'll damage your craft. Atari's answer to Nintendo's Star Wing? Cybermoprh gives us a flavour of the Jaguar's vector graphics, but how does the gameplay taste? LOTUS GYBERKORFE ord has reached you that the Pemitia Empire has conjured up a robotic technology which can regenerate itself. Like a virus, this has spread through the Galaxy. New weapons and defences have been designed to deal with the threat, but the enemy has seized these and suspended them in pods scattered around the planets. Jumping to the challenge you seat yourself in the Cybermorph, a prototype morphing craft which can adapt its shape and regenerate its damaged parts; this doesn't serve any particular gameplay use, but it 'looks impressive. You have to seek out the pods on eight planets to free a sector from the Empire and secure a defence base. Five sectors will need to be regained to defeat the Pemitia clan. Cybermorph goes in to destroy that Christmas tree-type object. These pollute the ground around them and so kill off any pods. If they destroy too many pods you can't complete the level. VERDICT I'm in two minds about this. Visually, it looks stunning, but there isn't much interaction. The enemy craft are easily disposed of and once the novelty of exploring the shaded terrains has gone all you find is a repetitive game. This wouldn't matter in an action game like Star Wing, but it does in the tactical approach used by Cybermorph. Atari is obviously looking to cash-in on the vector game status created by the likes of Star Wing on SNES. Sorry, but Star Wing is heaps better. DENIZ AHMET Here you approach a fleet of fast-moving aliens. Like most baddies in the game, you don't need to fight them just fly around. 46 "


"VERDICT JAGUAR Cybermorph seems to be a cracking game; it handles well and the graphics are impressive. Unfortunately, it is a bit empty in the gameplay stakes. Simple puzzles and pod collecting isn't what 64-bit games should be about. The sound is poor and the graphics don't use half the special effects available, and the end-of-level guardians lack imagination. Ultimately, this is a dull game which lacks the class and 'surprise' element of the SNES' Star Wing. It's fun for a while, but come on, 64-bit should be arcade quality. PROS: Possibly the best vector terrains yet seen. CONS: Limited appeal and a bit boring after a while. RIK SKEWS Using the radar is vital to gameplay in order to find sufficient pods for collection. It also informs you of enemy craft and which way the exit is. being deposited tactically beside an awkward obstacle or attack craft. GRAPHICS Excellent by vector standards, but not by Jaguar standards. 8? No in-game music and bad sound definition on the title tune -out-dated sound effects too. mi Not so peasy On easy planets the pods are left in the open. Things soon become harder though when pods are hidden in capsules and bunkers because you can't see these on the radar. The challenge mounts on deeper sectors. Spikes will frequently surround a pod preventing contact while force-fields shut-off areas, of terrain where pods are hidden. The solution to both of these headaches is to find the relevant control stations and destroy them. In addition to these you discover float: ing teleporters which take you too and from secret terrains and so more pods and baddies. How you approach this game is up to you. I went in there got the pods and did a runner. Well it worked for me. O GAMEPLAY For the first hour you'll swear it's brilliant, but then it all gets tiresome and repetitive. Those yellow diamond things in the distance are the pods you must collect. Some are placed dangerously close to buildings so go slow. Peas in a pod low the arrow on your radar to the Cybermorph is not a straightforward nearest pod and pick it up. If you shoot-'em-up like Nintendo's Star encounter any baddies all you need Wing. It's more of an exploration to do is fly past they don't seem game. The screen can rotate through to chase after you. The only enemies 360°, so you are not limited to you need to blast are those hanging defined paths like Star Wing. While around the pods once they sense the hills and terrains look stunning, you they will swoop in and steal the they never demand any manoeuvra nearest pod. Annoyingly, allowing 'bility skills. Basically, all you do is fol them to escape will result in the pod Not much of a challenge. With passwords it shouldn't take long to complete. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 5 NO-NWOO IIIIIIIIIII INI MISS OK The Cybermorph craft changes its shape depending on what you're doing. If you accelerate for example, the ship tucks in its wings. Very smart indeed. Just one of the 'intelligent' opponents in the game. These lay flat on the ground but pop up and start spitting if you get too near. 47 "

Until he realises from news reports and a little detective work that the new police droids are killing people due to a design fault, and the cops are framing innocent civilians and locking them up in a huge coverup job.

The red circles indicate an entrance to a tunnel and the blue mark the entrance to the special mission. ocee1220 tardust is essentially a combination of the classic Asteroids game, with a touch of Blasteroids added for good measure. After an amusing intro, which shamelessly rips off the start of the Star Wars films, it's on to the game proper. You've got to clear five worlds, each of which is divided into six zones. The zones can be completed in any order desired. At the end of the second level there's a special mission, which I'll keep a secret because I'm like that.

Luckily for platform addicts though, this isn't the case, hence Zool, the sequel. Follow the leader Zool 2 follows on where the original left off. Once again there's six worlds to journey through, all of which are larger than those found in the first game. The levels include Swan Lake, Bulberry Hill, Tooting Common, Mount Ices and Snaking Pass. Enemies are related to each world they inhabit. Swan Lake, for example, has a wealth of bird like critters all Zool now has much better climbing abilities than he did in the first game. Big bonanza There's all the usual hidden zones and mega bonuses to pick up, but these are generally tucked away in difficult-to-reach areas. Bonuses can be worth up to 20 times as much as a normal collectable.

Zool was one of those games that people never liked, they either loved it or hated it. Zool 2 will no doubt throw up similar contrasts. The graphics are full of detail (but slow down in places), the sound FX are great (while the tunes are poor Jarre ripoffs) and the levels are beautifully nonlinear (but too sprawling). Don't think I don't like it though. There's a long lasting challenge that never seems to frustrate, and with the addition of Zooz, the game may well broaden its appeal to female gamers.

Unfortunately, the Terran Emperor is not too chuffed about this and forces Clay back into racing by kidnapping his girl, Alyssia. Not only is Clay lumbered with the daftest name this side of Mars, but he also has the whole future of the Terran Empire, not to mention Alyssia's life, resting on his young shoulders.

CyberRace is fast, furious and full of action. Zooming around at ridiculous speeds and blasting seven shades of something or other out of the opposition is great fun, but isn't it all a bit limited? Well yes, in the long run, anyway. You'll get a lot of enjoyment out of it while it lasts, but once you've finished the game I doubt you'll want to go back to it too often. It's worth shelling out for if you don't mind spending  on a few days' entertainment, but it doesn't score too well in the value for money department. ONWAU IIIIIIIII M ter the next race, I promise!

"LREVIEW PC by EUROPRESS .99 Out November. Contact Europress (0625 878888) for information. Before each race you get to see Topsy turvy your progress for each day of the Rally. There's a lot to do. You can now appreciate why Rally requires so much skill. Each day brings VETWORK different weather conditions which Day  1 cause you havoc -1 seem to spend RALLY more time driving along on the roof than anywhere else though, and chances are, you'll do better if you listen to the advice of your co-driver as he warns of the dangers ahead. Make it to a check-point in one piece and you can use any extra time to repair your car if you can be bothered. Coming up on a slow driver, he may try to stop you overtaking. MPH MEHHH LILONG STRT RALLY Make sure that you keep on the road or you'll damage your tyres and gears, or even smash the windscreen! Top gear Your goal is to reach each checkpoint within a set time limit, to do this you have to select one of the five performance cars available. You can't simply go flat-out all the time in Rally because you just end up driving the hell out of your car. Bad driving habits like over revving and changing gears too soon will do you no good at all, plus constant crashes with trees and scenery will chip and crack the windscreen. Seatbelts check, crash helmets check, new rally sim from 'Europress Check! The challenge is set on the last leg_ of the World Championship Series, held in the UK. This covers a 350 mile course which has been digitised down to every last detail to offer the most realistic rally game ever. 33 Crashing at speed will flip your car and waste you valuable time, 79 he best thing about rally racing on the TV is watching someone spin off the road and splat an unsuspecting onlooker, unfortunately in Europress' rally simulation on the PC you can't actually hit any of the bystanders. Apart from this omission, though, Rally is just like the real thing. SOIHavaa Aldava VALUESOUND Sil STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Racing at night time means limit, ed visibility. Make sure you pick good tyres for that mud. OS 10 5 VERDICT Skid marks on the floor indicate that this is a difficult course. Make sure you use automatic breaks or you'll skid like crazy on the corners. Rally is road-jammed with options, but it fails to deliver a convincing illusion of movement on the track. Even on a 486-33 the digitised graphics are sluggish, and that's with a small play area; you can reduce the detail setting, but then it losses its realism. The car is also unresponsive, especially on tight corners. OK, so it is a realistic rally game, but PC owners expect better, just look at Grand Prix from MicroProse and you'll see what I mean. Rally looks exciting but it plays like a drunken driver. Sorry. ONWOO IIIIIIIIII mm DENIZ AHMET The snow has stopped, Your mirror shows no opponents so this track is going to be fast. 68 "

"MEGA DRIVE by ACCOLADE .99 Out December. Contact Accolade (081-877 0880) for information. Gods gives you the chance to gain an -ology as this floppy mythology classic hits the Mega Drive GODS y God, this has taken its time to hit the Mega Drive; admittedly it has been out on import, but that version failed Sega Europe's quality control checks over a year ago, but now it's been revamped and is ready for release. So what does it take to become a god? Well in this instance you have to have a Greek temple crammed with fiendish labyrinths, soaring towers, hidden underworlds; hoards of eerie, mystical creatures; relentless combat and plenty of cunning puzzles and traps. To fulfil your quest you must venture through 12 levels. Early worlds are limited in complexity while further in, greater interaction is needed as certain keys will only unlock certain doors, and a series of objects need collecting and returning to specific locations One of the four guardians you meet at the end of each city. Immortal combat COAT 1000x00000* la Gameplay is of the find A and B to achieve C-type approach. Yet Gods merges this with lots of killing and destruction. Slain enemies provide the main way to power-up, since they drop money, points and weapon tokens. Gathering several of the same weapon will activate multiple fire, while other tokens will disperse this fire into an arch of carnage. You get the idea. Quests like this sure drain resources, which is why completion of a world will summon the shopkeeper where you can power-up with weapons, lives, food and shields, but choose carefully if you want to progress with ease. Your treasure comes in handy when you summon the shopkeeper by finding a special token. FESIN REKEN GRAPHICS ONNOS IUTOD3 T Tokens are dropped by slain baddies. Here you can see a selection of power-up weapons. The question mark is a clue token which scrolls a relevant message. GAMEPLAY 9 VALUE 65 STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES mer 10 VERDICT Gods on the Amiga had top graphics, wicked sound and solid gameplay. Now it comes to Mega Drive and it has been enhanced with parallax scrolling and 64 colours and best of all, it's faster. It may seem out-dated, but the emphasis is on involving the player with eerie action and taxing puzzles. Your central character is impressive he's a very big sprite and because of the creatures' artificial intelligence, the better you play the more crafty they become. A gripping game and no mistake.  ONWU DENIZ AHMET If it's the time of day you're after, then go ask Accurist, 'cos he's not the conversationalist type. "


"MEGA-CD by KONAMI .99 Out December. Contact Konami (081-429 2446) for information. Grab your gun and get blasting, Mega-CD style! LE 6 -ENFORCERS TOURIE Z large Chinese people with guns and meat cleavers down in Chinatown; terrorists at the airport and vicious drug barons at the docks. While all this carnage is going on though, spare a thought for the civilians who stroll by occasionally. It's in your interests not to shoot them, as this will scupper your chances of promotion. You start the game as a lowly patrolman and must rise through the ranks on each stage if you wish to progress further into the game. 10 HIJACK re you looking for a highoctane shoot-out for your Mega-CD? Then look no further, because Konami has taken its popular Lethal Enforcers coin-op and converted it to compact disc! NATIONAL RUBBER At the start of each new level, you're treated to a bit of digitised animation. Shoot to kill The aim is simple shoot people. You're a Lethal Enforcer (a friend can be a Lethal Enforcer too) and it's your job to scuttle round the levels, taking out the enemies with the gun that comes with the game. You'll be taking on armed robbers at the bank; Go for the bloke first, then the power-up weapon, otherwise you'll get shot and lose the gun. GRAPHICS GAMEPLAY Power-up guns work only until you get shot. It's advisable to try and not get shot by terrorists, if you can help it at all. Arsenal This would be a difficult task and it is anyway if all you had to hand was your paltry police issue revolver. Luckily, new weapons appear on each stage such as rifles, gas bombs and Uzis, which you must shoot at to get the chance to use. However, if you get shot by an enemy at any time while in possession of one of the bonus firearms, you automatically revert back to your handgun. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT O-NWAUOVO There really isn't any difference between this and Konami's cartridge conversion of Lethal Enforcers. It will appeal to fans of the coin-op as it is a very good conversion. The big problem with games of this type is their long-term addictive quality; you're inevitably going to tire of the limited gameplay and start looking for other ways to satisfy your gaming hunger. But at a tenner less than the cartridge version, Lethal Enforcers on Mega-CD is certainly worth taking a look at. 1111111 82 PAUL RAND Not all the enemies shoot at you; this little feller, for instance, is handy with a blade. 72 "

Prepare to walk the plank if you can't fathom this strategy arcade adventure on the high seas Take some advice from the Governor. He's on your side. t's been a long time since the original Pirates was around. It first sighted land on the Commodore 64, but it has now been dredged from the bottom of the sea and is back on the hunt for gold, revamped and packed with the usual MicroProse attention to detail. The swashbuckling captain of a pirate ship is the role you take on, stalking the Caribbean seas with your scheming crew. Your ultimate aim is Zato Incognito Duel with the incumbent captain to force him to hand over his title to you. Incognito Opace 12 roms Cannon 12x to become rich enough to retire from Jolly Rodgering, as well as find a wife and become advisor to the king.

You can also visit merDo you plunder the ship or add it to your fleet? VERDICT 10 Una HEEL GOOS Put your thinking cap on, you're going to need it for this game, because there is so much to do there are countless different options. My main criticism though, is the arcade sequences the sword fights are a little lame; it's a shame they are not more action packed. And you've got to be in the right frame of mind to play this because unless you're a strategy fan it's quite heavy going. Having said that it you are a fan then you could be burning the midnight oil for some time trying to complete Pirates! TUP SUGAR AMANDA TIPPING Check up on your reserves.

"VERDICT MEGA DRIVE chants to trade food, sugar, goods, ships and cannons. At sea keep an eye on the sails because the wind can change and you can get lost at sea. Follow the map to check in at ports. Pirates is one of those games which tries to blend strategy with arcade action. Unfortunately, it fails to satisfy either. There are many elements to the game which do provide a challenge if logically followed, but that often takes too much time. The main problem is that the sword fighting scenes are dull, unresponsive and unimaginative. I'm not the greatest strategy fan, so from that point of view I find it very difficult to get in to. It certainly isn't the type of game you can pick up and play instantly for hours. Ahoy there me hearties Strategy is the name of this game, and there is plenty of scope in the adventures. Not only do you choose your type of ship and sword, but you also have the task of deciding whether to go to battle with other PROS: Plenty of attention to detail. CONS: Arcade action sequences are a bit lacking DENIZ AHMET ships or to sail past; whether to attack a port or wander in as a tourist; plunder ships or add them to your fleet.

It's based on a flight sim engine of all things, so you get a first-person view of the battlefield. The idea is to complete a series of missions, using your brains and your weapons to get you through in one piece. Surrendering is the better part of valour in my book. Body bag It's great fun to go in with all guns blazing, but many of the missions depend on you staying undetected. However, it's here that the game runs into problems. Say you have to go in and catch a prisoner. Does it matter if you bring him home in a body bag? Apparently not. Just go in, napalm a whole village, kill your target and you'll still get a pat on the back and a medal or two for your efforts. There are a few other inconsistencies too. Being able to walk through walls is one, and have you ever seen a boat floating across grass and still leaving a wake? Beyond that, it has plenty going for it. Graphics are adequate, if a bit basic, but with 80 missions to complete there's plenty of action and it's all backed up with great music and sound effects. On the whole, it's a promising start, so let's hope Electronic Arts produces a sequel which does away with all those niggly little problems.

Getting Nintendo and Disney to work on a game like Aladdin can only mean one thing: quality 1000 This is a bonus stage. The object is to collect as many gems as possible. Fly in all directions as the screen can scroll down to street level. Jump on these to discover something very important. Jump on these to empty their contents. This adds an extra health unit to Aladdin's status. This will restore Aladdin's health. laddin's adventure is not the easiest of challenges. Like the film, Aladdin is tricked by the evil Jafar into retrieving the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders, That task alone takes you up to level three in the game, and by level four Aladdin finds himself inside the Genie's lamp. There after, the action leads via the pyramids to Jafar's palace for Aladdin to save his girlie. Beauty or beast? 2UP dni The wheel of for tune. Let's just hope that it stops on something useful. Collect 100 of these to gain an extra continue. Find this and Aladdin will use it as a parachute when falling. Bouncing baddies off the screen is the only way to kill guards in the game, so Aladdin has no sword (boo!). In fact, Aladdin does everything by jumping on to it, be it opening treasure chests, emptying jars for food, or killing end of world, guardians. Aladdin is just a very nice game and you'll know that the instant you play it. GRAPHICS 9: ONDOS Tarzan So what's it really like? Well, Aladdin is a platformer which benefits from a Prince of Persia type interface, yet avoids the heavy puzzle approach with plenty of bashing action. That's nothing special, but Aladdin interacts with items of scenery in an imaginative manner. Rather than bouncing a guard off the screen for example, he can lure opponents towards a post and swing off these Tarzan-style, kicking them away in the process. Having collected the rug, Aladdin can use it to slow down his decent towards awkward platforms. VALUE GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 VERDICT There's a lot of jumping to do, but if you think you're going to miss a platform push up to make Aladdin grab the nearest object. ITT illllllllll Like the movie, Aladdin has had a lot of care and attention devoted to its graphics, delivering a stunning display of animation. It has the perfect balance of platform and bash-'em action and is full of typical Disney imagination. It's different to the Mega Drive version in layout, and harder, but it's still a bit easy. Even so, it may well be no more than a few days gameplay given the passwords, but this is still a very good game in every sense and the strongest movie tie-in for a long while.

No emeralds to collect, no big bosses to crush, just jump in the cockpit of your fighter and set off to do whatever you want.

FLASHBACK No it's not a new kitchen detergent, but can it wipe the floor clean of lesser platform games? interact with his surroundings comprehensively, which is unusual for a platformer. Stumbling across objects and people will shift an icon to explain what form of interaction is achievable. The list consists of adventure type commands like take, look, talk, activate and use. The latter permits Conrad to select an object from his inventory at any time, and it's good practice to examine his inventory at the start of each level as new objects will be automatically added to assist you. Flashback is full of cinematic animation sequences which depict key points in the game. ne thing more boring than a politician is a cloned politician. We probably wouldn't notice, but Conrad Hart has discovered duplicated political figures cloned by a bunch of aliens. Sadly, Conrad isn't the only one making dis'coveries, so as a penalty for his knowledge the aliens have formatted his memory. The game begins with Conrad's animated escape and his sudden realisation that he's no longer on Earth. Complete the game's challenges to restore his memory and make it home. Flash Gordon There's only one route through all six Flashback levels. Conrad is able to The start of this level is unfair as you run straight in to a land mine if you haven't been here before. A common aspect of the game. Don't jump down and shoot this guard as you'll get hit. Sling a stone to distract his attention and nail him in the back, WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE Conrad starts his quest in the artificial jungle. Here you can get a feel of the structure of platforms which need to be negotiated. Flashback is a flip screen game so there's always a danger element. VERDICT Flashback must be one of the best multi-format games around. The SNES graphics are better defined than those on the Mega Drive though, and it has close-up animations that the Sega version dropped. In many ways Flashback is a futuristic Prince of Persia, but better. The puzzles are involving, but they are not for the impatient as there's a lot of wandering about. That said, our shots can't show you Flashback's best feature its 'human' character animation, which makes the game a universal delight. DENIZ AHMET 86 "


"NERGY GENERATOR VERDICT SNES Smicom TERTENOG I am one of the few people who think that Flashback is overrated. But hey, the game is a welcome change for many console platform fans since it requires lots of thought to solve some mindbending puzzles. The graphics too are great especially Conrad's animation, and the sound is passable also. However, it's Conrad's control which lets the game down. It can be very frustrating to manoeuvre him and this affects playability somewhat lowering the game's pedigree from classic to very good. PROS: Superb animation; the best 'human' animation there is. CONS: Too much wandering and exploration on each level. HIELD RIK SKEWS Conrad can summon his inventory at any point. Here he places his shield in the generator for recharging. This is something you do quite often. GRAPHICS Amazing central character animation and very atmospheric scenery. Flash git Initially tasks are easy but soon dispersion of objects becomes more frequent, and doors no longer function without an ID card or key. Add to this platforms which are inaccessible without a teleporter, plus the need to find generators for recharging shields and a depth of challenge begins to emerge. you out then the hazards in Flashback will. Robots are not too problematic, but they gain intelligence the deeper you progress, but you can trick them by throwing stones to lure them away for a shot in their back! Ultimately, your survival comes with scenery familiarisation. Those big falls will kill you, and then there's the electrified ground, disintegrators and land mines. Towards the end it gets rather nasty with jet-packed cops, cameras and pressure pads which set off an alarm at the most awkward moments. The best idea is to just take it easy and think before you blink is my rule. There isn't much to be honest, but you do get tense tunes when danger is around. Flash in the pan If the puzzles don't catch The terrain in Flashback is designed to be very demanding on Conrad's acrobatic skill. Here he goes for a jump, but will he make it? There's a lot of puzzles to contend with, but plenty of addictive action too. It's actually a big game with a strong challenge for all ages. Lots of lastability.

TE ONE LOCALES Revisited, recycled, repackaged, relaunched... it's 1993 and once more the gates of Zork are open to adventurers The game features a host of Zorkers'. Talk to them, record their voices, even snap their pictures. ou may not remember Zork, but long ago it was one of the most successful adventures in the world (cue nostalgia). It was complex, difficult and you could only count its admirers on one hand if you had a million fingers that is. Yes Zork wasn't just big it was huge, immense and leviathan. And the secret of its success? It was the best-written text adventure on the market. The land of Zork certainly looks stunning, it's just a shame that the gameplay doesn't quite match up. Something old, There's nothing new here for veteran adventurers to worry about something new So what's new about it? Well in Oh and of course don't forget the amongst shouts of frobozz (?), wizplot. As usual the clouds have dark ards and small, white houses, Return 'ened and the land of Zork is threat to Zork features some new features. ened by a terrible evil. Naturally, You can record speech and take you've got to save it single-handed. photos but the game will be best You've got no weapons, no money remembered for its American sitcom and you've no idea where you are. actors. Nice game, dreadful acting! Sailing down the river. Now do I grab the handily placed bridge or plunge over the waterfall? GRAPHICS SOUND Times change But if playing the original Zork was like reading a book, then Activision has given Return to Zork the look of a glossy, magazine supplement, and brought it bang up to date. Now Zork boasts high resolution graphics, digitised speech and a thoroughly modern icon interface that means that every action can be mouse controlled. BUTT-HEAD Return to Zork features a host of US sitcom actors. There's the guy who plays Wayne (Kevin's brother) from the Wonder Years; some kid from Doogie Howser; Nino and Leonard from that daytime filler Major Dad and even Sam Jones, who played Flash Gordon on the big screen (remember that?). Almost every CD release this year has had standards of acting that would make the organisers of school nativity plays feel proud. Come on, enough is enough. This ham acting has got to stop. GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT ONWAOOOO IIIIIIIIII Return to Zork looks fab, but it's not much fun. In fact after the delights of Day of the Tentacle, Zork is a positive bore. There's some nice ideas like using the camera and the tape recorder but ultimately it doesn't quite work. Deep down it's the usual object A + object B = desired result' routine hiding behind pretty graphics and digitised speech. Frankly I'm not impressed. It's dull and repetitive and if you're going to buy an adventure, buy Sam and Max (page 98) instead. You'll have tons more fun, I guarantee it. GOTT TIITT DENIZ AHMET The lighthouse: Zork's easy-touse icon interface makes the adventurer's difficult job a much simpler one. 96 "

"REVIEW PC by US GOLD .99 Out November. Contact (US Gold 021-625 3366) for information. IS NOT widely known, but Tixie nad ranen ERT love with Bruno Sam & Max is an adventure with a twisted sense of humour, but is it laughably good? Am Sit-down aerobics are no excuse not to be interviewed. You do all your travelling via the car, but avoid the water! HIT THE ROAD HALLSS EIRD EIRD CREEPY n its own abstract humorous way, Sam & Max is the sequel to Day of the Tentacle. It's a different plot, but the animation user interface and warped visual gags are all intact. Basically, you control an unlikely detective duo: Sam who's a pondering dog and Max a hap-hazard bunnie. Having been assigned the case of solving some strange disappearances, your task is to drive around a number of tacky tourist camps using your brains and imagination to gather sufficient clues. As with Day of the Tentacle, this game has an excellent dialogue Your clues have led you here but how will Sam get past his bad breath. clues and show the climax of your previous task solving efforts. Sam and Max meet Elvis (almost). You can interrupt him for some clues and perhaps game tips. PLAY GRAPHICS Gin Hair raising antics which captivates your attention and churns out a hilarious script. Assisting this is many humorous animation sequences which activate at key points in the plot to reveal further STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES You control Sam for the majority of the game but you can use Max for help with certain puzzles. The good thing is that you can interact with fea tures in the scenery, more than your average adventure, and there's plenty of genuinely useful snippets of information to be found. Sam & Max is an average adventure, but it does have some highly involving visual attractions. O VERDICT Sam & Max will appeal to more than just adventure fans because of its impressive full-screen graphics and simple interface, these hold your attention by promises of funny cinematic sequences. Plot wise, it's imaginative and the characters have strong, confident personalities. There's plenty of interaction and locations to visit and you'll find the game opens up its complexity gently. I'd say its more difficult than Day of The Tentacle, but experienced adventure players may still find the challenge over in a month.

AF The plant life's alive on Magma here, Daffy takes out a dangerous-looking cactus. You're dethpicable Money is gained by shooting Marvin's minions, the Instant Martians. When Marvin sprinkles water on an Instant Martian pill, it grows into a towering alien, complete with gun. Dodgers can destroy the Martians by letting loose with his gun when the Martian is dead it leaves bags of money. At the end of each mission you'll meet Marvin, encased in a spaceship blasting at a point on the craft causes damage, and once Dodgers has dispatched Marvin he gets his face in the newspapers, before moving on to the next mission. GUNNING FOR MARVIN Unlike some platform game characters, Duck Dodgers can't bounce on baddies' heads to kill them he has to use one of the many weapons which he can buy at the start of each mission, provided he has the cash. He starts the game with a normal blaster, but can purchase any of the following firepower: THE MARVIN MISSIONS Looney Tunes This really is no laughs with Duck time to be sitting down on the job!

ELECTRICITY GUN Emits a very powerful bolt of electricity, which destroys baddies with three shots. THREEWAY GUN Blasts out one big bullet which splits into three smaller ones, giving a greater hit range. R ANNOS 69 . GAMEPLAY GRAPHICS TOR STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 2 VERDICT This game reeks of unoriginality, kill the baddies using a variety of weapons, climb the platforms and travel on the lifts, then shoot the end-of-level guardian. Is this the sort of game punters want? I don't think so. The sprites are close to the cartoon originals, but backdrops are lifeless. Sound is average, and the Looney Tunes ditty is a pale imitation of the original there's some decent Daffy speech in there, though. My main gripe is with the gameplay, however. It's old, derivative and, at the end of the day, bland. ONWAV BOMB GUN Shoots a time bomb which rolls to your enemy before finally exploding with a powerful blast. ANTIMATTER GUN This is the most powerful gun you'll find in the game, it kills the enemy with one or two shots. IIIIIIIII MUL 67 PAUL RAND 99 "

You control over 300 conscripts (but you can only take 15 into battle at once) each with differing abilities such as grenade throwing Twenty four levels await you, some are sub-divided into a maximum of six phases, taking the total missions to over 100.

REFLEXES POHOME HERDES 10 — VERDICT TITUTII ONWOOCO Cannon Fodder is the best Amiga action game I've played since Sensible Soccer. Graphics are good, the sampled sound is excellent and playability is superlative. Control of the troops is instinctive and brilliantly implemented, just like Sensible Soccer, and the use of the mouse is an excellent idea. The difficulty curve has been pitched just right and saved games can be loaded in to avoid repetition. A classic game and yet another winner for Sensible methinks. 310.5 U 32339393 90 RIK SKEWS Rather cheerfully the game keeps a running count of all deaths on both sides.

Killer mushrooms! Where's that fungicide? VERDICT Shadowcaster is an attractive RPG, with fast scrolling, original monsters and detailed graphics. In terms of gameplay, though, it's a bit of a bimbo: good looking, full of action but not all that interesting underneath the frills. Basically it's Wolfenstein 3D with swords instead of guns. The puzzle element is weak, there's no character interaction, and the emphasis is on combat. It will suit novice gamers, but I don't think it has enough depth to satisfy experienced role-players. ONWOOD IIIIIIIII MULTUM TIITTIITTI Tough enough? Shadowcaster is technically an RPG, but it's more like a beat-'em-up as most of the time you are bludgeoning monsters to death, which can be great fun for a while. It's a very slick looking game and I hope that the sequel (if one is planned) has more depth though. Very promising, but not quite taxing enough. 75 PAUL RAND 104 "

"CHEAT ) = SNES ALIEN 3 CHEAT MODE o Ho Ho! We've got into the Christmas spirit, and we've contacted that fat bloke with the beard, Santa, to come down the CVG chimney and enlighten us with a horde of Christmas cheats, hints and tips to keep you happy over the festive period. So if you've had enough of Bernard Matthews' favourite bird and all you wanna do is play, then plug in your console, at about the same time that Queenie makes her speech (just to annoy your granny), and get cheating! By the way, have you discovered a clever tip or cheat that everyone else is to much of a geek to find? Do you want to share it? You don't? Well this is probably because a) you are too scared to share your incredible cheats with us in case we pass over your details to MENSA who wants to use your brain for biological experiments, or b) you are just plain damned lazy. Well we promise we'll keep your details safe from MENSA, and there's no excuse for being lazy (even though Rand comes up with plenty of 'em), so send your amazing but true tips to CVG Cheat Mode, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1 3AU. Blimey, Alien 3 is great but you tend to run out of weapons quickly. So, press A, B, Y and X on controller two and then use the following keys on controller one to activate the cheats: A for invincibility, B for damage level and X for unlimited weapons. ELE S43019 S STAT SNES SUNSET RIDERS CONTINUE TACTIC you'll be able to carry on playing without going back to the start. Repeat this procedure in reverse to continue when player two dies. MEGA DRIVE GAME BOY EX-MUTANTS TURRICAN This shoot-'em-up Western is a fine coin-op conversion by Konami, but don't you just hate it when you have to restart the entire level just because you snuffed it on the boss. But hey, not any more! Use this routine to continue the game without going back to the start of a level when your lives are up. Start a one-player game and pause when you lose your last life. Grab controller two and press start to introduce a new character and CHEAT MODE Should you feel the urge to suddenly um, cheat, then this info should be of help. Access the options screen and set the music to 05 and FX to 21. Exit and hold A, B and C before pressing START. INVINCIBILITY You all know how hard shooting games are on a tiny screen, but who cares when you can be invinvible by pressing A, B, B, A, B, A, A, B, A, A, B, A, A on the title screen. Also pressing START and SELECT will skip stages during play. YOU-GOT ME! 119 "


"SNES SNES MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE BATTLETOADS IN BATTLEMANIACS SUPER TURRICAN TAZMANIA SPLATTER HOUSE 3 LEVEL CODES LEVEL SKIP INFINITE LIVES FIVE LIVES AND CONTINUES TEST 198 012300 Once upon a time someone invented a thing called passwords to make hard games easy. Cheers, to whoever that person was because you can now make use of these access codes: Level 2 = REISOR Level 3 = ETLBUD Level 4 = TABRAE Level 5 = ELPOEB Level 6 = PHENIX XXXX This game will be a lot more fun with this easy cheat code. Simply enter FFD45 on the password menu If you're looking for a lavish platform shoot-'em-up, don't look past Super Turrican. That said, it takes a while to get through it so use this cheat to access all the stages. Start and pause the game. Press RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, A and START to go to the next level. Repeat for each stage. Another scrolling beat-'em-up with some hilarious attack moves, but bloody hard with it. Could do with some extra lives methinks, and now you have it. On the title screen hold DOWN A and B while pressing START. The flag will blink red to indicate that the cheat has worked. GAME BOY TURTLES 2 LEVEL SELECT If like us, you're fed up with getting shell shocked all the time? Well use this method to skip levels and avoid heaps of problems. On the title screen press UP, DOWN, B, A, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A then START. MEGA DRIVE CRUE BALL MEGA DRIVE LEVEL SELECT JAMES POND II: 0:00) Well, you know how it is when you play a game for ages and just fail to make it to that next level. Good job that we have this cheat to save you all the trouble eh? Play level six on the sound test option then hit A, C, A and B followed by START. You can now start a game and press B and UP to advance a level. INVINCIBILITY and LEVEL SELECT It could be quite an important moment in your life when you enter this cheat, because it might actually work. Get on to the first roof and collect the Cake, Hammer, Earth, Apple and Tap for invincibility. For a level select press A, C, DOWN, LEFT and START on the title screen. This will take you to an options menu. 120 "


"ALL FORMATS MEGA CD GAME BOY ECCO THE DOLPHIN CD PROBOTECTOR MORTAL KOMBAT PASSWORDS ALWAYS WIN! One of the strangest game concepts for ages. Perhaps that's why this has been such a big hit. Anyway, to see the best bits commence play and swim to the left password screen. Enter any of the following for the last five stages: LEVEL SELECT AND EXTRA LIVES A fine platform shoot-'em-up this, but few people will get to see all the levels because of the difficulty curve. Perhaps that's why you can press UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, B, A then START on the title screen to advance a level. For extra lives hit Up four times, DOWN four times, LEFT four times and RIGHT four times on the title screen. Deep Water 2 = GAAGDPLP City of Forever = YLQQZNLM The Tube = MNEYELLB The Machine = SKZNELLO The Last Fight = KANZFLLX MEGA DRIVE CYBORG JUSTICE This mega selling game is superb, but it is actually quite easy. One tactic which no-one seems to have discovered is that if you select Scorpion it is possible to beat every opponent all the time and on any difficulty level by using your hook move. When the fight starts hook your opponent immediately before he has a chance to move and use an uppercut to knock him to the ground. While down perform the hook move again and if you've timed it right you'll grab him before he has a chance to get on his feet. Using this tactic it's possible to always win and not lose any energy! SNES POP 'N' TWINBEE CHEAT MODE It's mean, it's moody and the combat moves are sick to watch. But we love this game and you can enjoy it even more when you activate this special cheat option. This secret menu can be found by pausing during a duel or arcade game and hitting C, B, B, C, C, A, C and B. INVINCIBILITY 99500 This is the best shoot-'em-up officially released over here and while not particularly difficult this invincibility code will allow you to marvel at those lavish visuals. Start the game, pause it and press A, Y, A, Y, L, R, L, R, X, B, B and unpause. MEGA DRIVE STREETS OF RAGE 2 SNES LEVEL SELECT PARODIUS INVINCIBILITY Possibly the most sickeningly cute shoot-'em-up game ever, Parodius becomes far less frustrating with invincibilty. Just pause the game and press L, R, UP, X, R, A, L, Y, DOWN, B, A, Y, A, Y, R and START. Phew! A very popular game; so this cheat should go down well. If it doesn't work don't blame us because it was one of our readers who sent it in (and didn't put their name on it, as usual). Go to the options screen and hold down A and B on pad two. Press START on joypad one simultaneously and you'll access a cheat screen which might have some useful options on it. 121 "

SNES BOBSEN PRINCE OF PERSIA SNES SNES MEGA DRIVE This is a very good platformer which is fast enough anyway, but hey, why not make it faster? ZOMBIES STREET FIGHTER TURBO MUTANT LEAGUE FOOTBALL 7E0000FF to double the speed of the game! 3356 Still the best fighting game ever so here are a few codes to enhance the game a tad: MEGA DRIVE It's footie, American style and with heaps of mutants on the field. Still, these cheats will enhance the gameplay. ZOMBIES 7E188FOB to skip to Vega/Bison after winning one round. 7E0530BO for infinite energy on player one. 7E0730BO for infinite energy on player two. FFFD5E0002 for super charged running. FFE1E60003 to start the game in the finals. One of the best maze games for years. Zombies suddenly becomes hard after level 20 or something. Balance things up by using these cheats: Zombies is plenty of fun in one or two-player mode, but it's a hell of a lot quicker to complete with these codes: SNES COOL SPOT 7E1CB80A Infinite energy for player one. 7E1CBAOA infinite energy for player 2. 7E1D1E99 infinite keys for player one. 7E1D3E99 infinite keys for player two. FFFA47000A for unlimited energy on player one. FFFAE700FF for unlimited energy on player two. FFFAA100FF for unlimited keys on player one. FFFB4100FF for unlimited keys on player two. The red dot returns in a smashing platform romp where everything is about 20 times bigger than himself. Time for some cheats I'd say: TE0OD403 for infinite lives. 7E0ODOOF for unlimited energy 7E00AAXX for level select. Replace XX with 00-10. 2 000900 SNES 3 10 JURASSIC PARK The SNES version is staggeringly better than the Mega Drive version, though it is very difficult. Use this cheat to keep you from becoming prehistoric: 7E02A304 for infinite lives. 125 "

TVORY CST Stage of development 95% complete Expect to receive the yellow or even red card for any illegal moves. The referee is very interactive in Empire Soccer BELGIUM Christmas comes once a year, which is more than can be said for footie games You can customise the controls to your own style of play, this will help to get the ball past the nimble goalies. IVORY EST very time we get a new footie game on the horizon we hear | the same thing: 'This is going to be the best football game yet'. Empire Software reckons that's the score with its new soccer game. much of the pitch at any one time which can make passes a bit limiting. The second, and more vital lure is that of special shots. Empire Soccer has a huge range which are quite easy to perform, including the likes of banana kicks, snap shots, back-heels and power dives. Realism, is hence, a focal point in this game. The graphical detail in Empire Soccer is immense. The stadium casts a shadow on the pitch. Even so, it is difficult to see what's happening when you're under the overhang. On the pitch? BELGIUM In Empire Soccer you are going to be able to choose between either a league or knockout style word cup final championship. The game is going to have two main attractions which separate it from its rivals: huge player sprites are the first thing, making Sensible Soccer teams look positively titchy. A potential problem with this, though, is that you don't get to see It's on the pitch on the pitch the game moves along at a nice pace, not too fast like some footie games, and the various team configurations have a definite effect on the course of play. You'll also find some worthwhile visual sequences for goals, injuries and referee decisions in the form of close-up animations. Empire Soccer could well net a following for one of the best looking footie games. 126 "

"SNES/GAME BOY by GREMLIN GRAPHICS TBA PREVIEW Zool's about to jump across the formats, and he may well give Mario a bit of a kick up the jacksie JANUARY levels to each world, including the secret bonus world. Stage of development hat's right, the Ninja from the Nth Dimension is in full fighting force as he embarks on his intergalactic quest to quash Krool and his side-kick, Mental Block, from doing evil things on a weird and wonderful planet. The story's the same as on the Mega Drive, Amiga and CD32 so to cut a long story short Zool is the guardian of goodness and defender of the Dimension 80 % complete Zoom There's funky music and groovy graphics that are more than a match for hedgehogs and plumbers alike. Ordinary objects such as sweets, flowers, fruits, fairground and musical instruments have been turned into dangerous assassins trying to stop the spinning, twirling and altogether hyper Zool from reaching the end of his entertaining journey. You'll have to wait until the new year before you can get to grips with the game yourself, but from what we've seen so far it's worth waiting for.

You'll find it's a hair raising experience if they do. t02 Stage of Development 100% Completed Donald Leap across the branches of the trees to get you through this level. Don't fall into the bottomless pit. The inlet. Seek out the Golden Fang to get closer to the statue. This doesn't look much like a jungle. Anyway kick the treasure chests and blocks to help you. Some hold feathers which speed you up, others will move to block spiked rivers. Donald Duck follows in a recent line of Disney cartoon-to-game conversions. Will you go quakers about it? oor Donald Duck is in a sad state. Not only does he have a slight speech impediment, but he also has a crazy Uncle Scrooge who always gets itchy webbed feet and likes to go off on adventures, unfortunately they usually end up in trouble. This time Uncle Scrooge has been cursed. He grabbed a mysterious pendant from the neck of a statue of an ancient goddess, and he's blown up to the size of a balloon. Into the valley Scrooge asks his nephew to return the pendant to the shrine, as this will break the curse. You take on the role of Donald and you start your intrepid adventure on a deserted island in one of four places the Jungle, the Volcano, the Inlet or the Valley. There's good use of scrolling, platform gameplay and the graphics are really smart, especially seeing Donald die because he looks so funny. As you'd expect the sound is similar to the cartoon theme with short, chirpy ditties that actually get on your nerves after a while. Despite that, it looks like we're going to have an impressive game on our hands; wait for the full review soon. VOLCANO Where is Uncle Scrooge? The daft duck relates his tale to Donald. The map of the island. It may look small but there's plenty to keep you busy. Clamber up the platform and there's a surprise waiting. 130 "


"MEGA-CD by PSYGNOSIS .99 Here at CVG we thought this was the finished game; but Psygnosis assures us that yet more is going to be added to the final product. PREVIEW NOVEMBER Stage of Development 99% Complete Will the gameplay in Microcosm Mega-CD match the superb intro; watch this space for the final analysis. MICROCOSM The intro to Microcosm reaches cinematic proportions. Psygnosis has high hopes for its shoot-'em-up derived from an old sci-fi TV show; prepare to fight your way through the veins of a human being... You'll spend most of your time drifting in the patient's veins. These twist and turn and occasionally split giving the player the option of selecting different routes through the game. As you may expect, the inside of a body isn't very interesting, so let's hope it doesn't get too repetitive. hen The Fantastic Journey was filmed yonks ago the idea of shrinking a person and injecting them into a patient for surgery was a unique concept. Slipping this concept into its plot, Microcosm has conjured up a shoot'em-up game set inside a human body. The story tells of Axiom agents who have infected a patient leading you to take pursuit, and blast away for a splash of interior decorating. toxins come flooding your way. You're supposed to avoid blasting the red and white cells as unbalancing these will kill the patient, but blast the toxins with your on-board laser. Eventually, the enemy will start to come at you in armoured pods which commit you to seeking out better weaponry from scattered items left drifting in the body. At key points you can also dock with a supply base and upgrade your pod completely. Nothing lasts forever in shoot-'emups, and towards the game's climax you abandon your pod to battle the final guardian in the bloodstream. Infected It's not long before blood cells and 131 "

"SNES by EMPIRE SOFTWARE .99 PREVIEW Yogi has reached the final stage in the game. He should always be careful when sliding down the platforms because there might be a nasty waiting just off-screen. It's a tip to jump along and not walk. MARCH RELEASE Stage of Development 97% Complete Yabba Dabba Doo time (whoops wrong cartoon), anyway take it away Boo Boo... ogi, as every decent Hanna Barbera fan knows, is smarter than the average bear. And so faced with the news that a chemical plant is being built inside Jellystone Park, Yogi is more than capable of getting through this (yes you've guessed it) forthcoming platform release from Empire. BEAR gry woodland animals, smelly skunks, salmon and other starving creatures. The game on first sight looks like a mundane platformer, which like Asterix uses established platform game techniques to deliver a very cartoonish but standard offering. Polluted picnic hampers For his video game debut Yogi's sideways scrolling adventure will take him over five terrains of basic platform action to the final showdown at the construction site. Our preview version looks mighty huggable, with an ex Yogi sprite complete with the characteristic pot belly. Dashing around munching food Yogi can adopt the familiar bum-splat to dispose of hunIt's not new Boo Boo Yes, this is another game where you have to bum-splat dangers. Yogi never kills anything. There doesn't appear to be anything original in here and the platforms are all logical and easy to anticipate. Later levels see some variety with the customary under water stage where Yogi does his doggy paddle. He also does a tad of cave exploring, beaver surfing (Ahem -Ed.) and pelican hopping (but we haven't seen these scenes yet). While not promising anything spectacular on the gameplay agenda, Yogi is presented well and visually it's very slick and you can expect a review in the new year. Yogi jumps for a clock. Obviously, grabbing lots of these gives Yogi extra time. The swimming stage is great. There are no baddies in the water but it's slow going. Best to get out as quickly as possible if you don't want to risk running out of time. 138 "


"SNES by EMPIRE .95 PREVIEW JANUARY RELEASE A leap of faith into the unknown is common in this game. Yet, it becomes even harder when sprites this big decide to give chase. Stage of development 100% complete Dirk gets a chance to use his gun here. He'll need to defeat the ugly worm before he can get to the other platform. A common task. there'll always be something new to discover, and from what we've seen 'agreement' is probably a safe conclusion to make don Finally a Sullivan and Bluth graphics game that has some decent gameplay 3D-'em-up There are various 3D tunnel shoot-'emup stages, bike racing courses, rollerskating challenges inside a maze and heaps of shoot-and-dodge action on risky platforms. Every level can be completed in at least two ways and with no passwords available this game should hopefully deliver the sort of challenge that was lacking in the coin-op. releasing this unplayable game on floppy format, and understandably us journalists moaned at the predict and move interface. Empire, though, in converting Space Ace to the SNES has actually, wait for it, made a real game out of it. Dirk skids around a lot so it can be tricky to negotiate platforms. Just one example of the varied styles of play in this game. Ace of spades Space Ace isn't going to be a platform game. It's going to have 25 different levels with massive animated characters popping up at awkward moments. What you'll get is plenty of variety with your character going it on foot, with wheels, in a spaceship and a heck of a lot more from what Empire has been saying. The graphics are faithful to the original; familiar characters set in a surreal cartoonish land. Access to each stage is via a maze cavern which appears to keep the game open to different routes. Empire promises hile the coin-ops of Space Ace, and its predecessor Dragons Lair, were the most ogled, they were probably the least played machines because of the lack of gameplay involved. Someone thought they could get away with 139 "

Please tell him what you will do if he calls me it again. YOB: Dear Mr Blockage, How can you take the mickey out of this lad's stupid surname when you're obviously such a saddo yourself? Just because his name is even more ridiculous than yours, it doesn't give you the right to ridicule the lad in front of the class.

Remember, there's  for the best letter of the lot, and a kick in the kerakas for the rest... 140 ANYWAY Dear YOB, I am writing to complain about these people who are banning violent video games from television, like Mortal Kombat and Streetfighter 2. The only people who are going to start freezing people with giant balls of ice are either God or a certain fictional character from a certain violent video game. I am sure that I am not the only one who agrees with this and if I am I don't really care. Could you please answer these questions or shall I write a letter informing you about the dangers of sheep dips? 1. Do you believe in Father Thursday? 2. Do we exist? 3. Is the world going to end on a leap year? LUKE JENKIN Tintagel, Cornwall. PS I am an Atari 2600 fan. YOB: 1. Depends how much he's prepared to pay. 2. I wish you didn't. 3.

"TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT Dear YOBBO, I am writing to you to try and tell all the rest of you dimwits at CVG that whenever I read your mag and look at the reviews I nearly always notice that you add up all of the percentages wrong so I, being the great person that I am, will help you brain-deads to get it right. You add them all up and then divide by four to get the correct total. Now that wasn't very hard now, was it? Keep up the good work of the little that you lot do. DEAN SMITH Hampton, Worcestershire.

OH WELL, AT LEAST HE WAS FROM WORCESTERSHIRE. THIS TIME. NAHEEM JAMIL Slough, Berks. Dear YOB, These are two different letters that are separate entities in their own rights, one from me (Naheem) and the other from my cousin Zaher. We decided to post them together because we thought that it would save stamp money, so please take them as two completely different letters from two completely different people. Thank you. YOB: Just for once, there is absolutely nothing I can add to this letter. Instead, dear readers, please fill the following space with your own thoughts and feelings after witnessing its complete lack of purpose: . Thank you.

STEPHEN QUIGLY Glasgow, Scotland. YOB: Tails has been put into early retirement aone Q YOB: As a machine, I think it's the business. Its technical specifications are nothing short of stunning, and it avoids the perils of slow CD access time by opting for cartridge format. The trouble is, Atari hasn't exactly got the world's greatest record for producing the games that everybody wants to play on console, so there's a massive question mark over the software.

"WHO YOU CALLING BALD? Dear YOB the Pob, First of all, let me start by saying how excellent CVG is and how mental you are. I am going to ask you some questions now, you bald-headed eagle with a few crappy bits of hair on the side. Send me the , you mug. Print this letter. EDDIE TAYLOR Eltham, London PS I've got a machine-gun. PPS If you cuss me I'll have my nan come round your house. of Bovril and fried egg sandwich in hand, you sit down at your desk and prepare to begin the day. A pile of letters awaits. Unable to face the sad ones with insults on the envelopes, you reach for the most sensible-looking one that you can find. Hands trembling, you pull it from the pile. Maybe this will be the one the sensible, intelligent, genuinely witty letter you've been waiting for. Cautiously you tear open the envelope and Eddie Taylor's latest effort falls out, landing in a damp, fetid heap before you. He's really pulled out all the stops this time, holding the crayon the right way up and everything, but this is all he can manage. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, so you scream... YOB: It's 11.34am and you've just arrived at work. Mug ARE TOO STUPID Dear YOB, I have found a way to beat M Bison in the arcades. In the first round you'll probably lose. When this happens, shout: Why does a sad geek like me always lose!' Then, in the second round, slam the side of the machine twice, kick the bottom about 10 times and head-butt the screen as many times as possible. Hey presto, you're well tanked him! SIMON YOUNG East Lothian. ANS YOB: Dear Everyone, I've found a way to beat Simon Young. When you read his letter, shout: \"Why does a sad geek like him actually exist?» Then rush round his house and punch his lights out. You'll have to hurry, though.

Dear YOB, Could you answer these quizzes for me? 1. I have a SNES. Could you tell me the best games to buy this Christmas? 2. I don't have Zelda. Do you recommend it? 3.

BARRY MCCALLUM Clydebank, Glasgow PS Please, please, please print this letter otherwise I'll start snivelling. YOB: Depends. Are your electrodes configured to NTSC or PAL standard? Hit the switch and find out. Don't forget to put the machine on full power, and it helps if you've got a bypass switch running through the light socket. Write in with the results and Doctor Yob will advise you accordingly. TO WORK IT OUT 13004700? more details: SOB! See Dear YOB, I recently purchased a copy of Mortal Kombat for my Mega Drive. The game is great but the death moves on my cartridge are different or just don't work at all. For example, your CVG October issue printed the death moves. I tried these on my console but they don't work. The only character whose death move works is Liu Kang's and I can safely say it's so crap it's unbelievable. I can't understand why this happens when I follow the exact moves that you printed. Is there something wrong with my cartridge and has Sega decided to manufacture new games without the blood? Please answer. NEILL ROBERTSON Aberdeen, Scotland. YOB: 1. All-Stars, Turbo, Bomberman, Sensible Soccer. 2. Y-up (previewed last issue.) 3. Y-up. Ask nicely and I might supply » more details. 4. Turbo Duo. 5. Coin-op. Coming to conIsoles next year. 6. Why do you think? It's because yours truly keeps supplying all you snivellers with crucial info like all of the above. PS Stop snivelling, it's not very Glaswegian of you. ANDREY MAN-Size SNOT iWi PES YOB:THICKIE ALERT! IS ANYONE ELSE ENJOYING THIS AS MUCH AS ME? SHALL WE TELL HIM WHAT HE'S DOING WRONG?

"I'M SICK OF DOING STUPID HEADLINES Dear YOB, Why the hell did you get your own column in a superb mag? My mum fancies you a bit but she's just about as ugly as you are. I bet you cried your eyes out when Eldorado finished. You've got such scummy clothes a skip once fell in love with you. I bet you  you don't print this letter. RS BECKWOODS Cardiff. Dear YOB, I am thinking of getting a SNES for birthday and Christmas, but I am having trouble deciding which version to get: US, Jap or European. Also, I like the sound of the Amiga 32CD. Could you tell me: 1. Which you think is the best version of the SNES? 2. Should I buy the Amiga 32CD or the SNES? 3. How much do games cost roughly for the 32CD? 4. Could you give me a list of your top 10 games for the SNES? 5. Could you give me a list of games (out now and on the production line) for the Amiga 32CD? AXL SMITH Surrey YOB: I bet you ,000 you're a member of the GamesMaster club. Oh and if your mum's ugly then it's odds on that you're ugly too. LET'S FACE IT Dear YOB, Since buying CVG from Issue One could you please answer my queries: 1. Where are all the CD-i reviews and previews of Link, Zelda and Voyeur etc? 2. How about an eight-page review of CD-i Playboy disc to save me buying the top-shelf mags for their DIY articles? 3. Do you agree that Digital Video is one of the most important developments in gaming history? Just compare the CD-i and PC CD-ROM versions of 7th Guest. 4. Give Philips CD-i a chance. It's a great machine and it's more than a match for the 3DO or the very unsupported CD32. MIKE COWLEY Stonehouse, Glos YOB: 1. Jap, but you'll need a SCART monitor to use it. The machine runs approximately one sixth faster and you won't need an adaptor to play Japanese import games. All the professionals use them. 2. It's called a CD32, you donkey! It's a bit of a corking machine, but there's not much in the way of CD games for it, just straight portovers from floppy. Keep an eye on it for a while to see what develops. 3. You don't want to know. 4. Nice question. It changes all the time, but here's the current top 10: Streetfighter Turbo, Mario Kart, Turtles Tournament Fighter, Art Of Fighting, Zombies, Mortal Kombat, Mario AllStars, Shadowrun, Super Bomberman, Striker. Honourable mentions: Zelda, Pooyu Pooyu, Virtual Soccer, Tetris 2, Aladdin, anything by Konami except Sunset Riders, which is dollop. 5. See question 3. Right now the software houses are waiting to see which way Commodore jumps before they follow. Your Mighty Yobster has it on top authority that the 1200 is selling a bomb, though, so that's where the clever money is right now. YOB: With a brain like yours, the only thing you're entitled to is a Yobdaloo Sinkseeker Mach VII. If you bothered to read last issue, you'll have seen International Tennis Open reviewed on CD-i. Where do these people come from? YOU KNOW WHAT? space whatsoever here. Actually, I'm doing everybody a favour. When you turn 16 and want to leave school, but your parents are whining on about you're doing A-levels and crappy university courses, simply whip out this letter and show them the error of their ways. This is what too much college does to people, and Dickie here is living proof. If you ask him nicely, he might even come round your house to prove beyond doubt the perils of further education. Just make sure you've rolled up the carpet before he arrives, because those stains can be impossible to remove... Dear Mr YOB, I am an A-level student studying English Language and part of my course work is to produce (CENSORED DUE TO COMA-INDUCING LACK OF INTEROB) rubber-keved Spectrum 48K. It brings the memories flooding back? Now I don't want to get into the subject too heavily as I think I said everything I wanted to in my essay (ALL SIX PAGES OF IT YOB) but I would like to add that I am sick of the image of video games in most people's minds; that of a (CENSORED DUE TO SPASM-INDUCING SUBLIMINAL BOREDOM YOB) or close their eyes at the nasty bits (which aren't that bad). Please take a look at my article and I hope you agree with the points I've made. Bear in mind it was written so my technophobe teacher and examiner could understand it and the audience it's written for is a radio programme, but maybe you could print some of my arguments. I would like to finish by commenting on the type of reader your magazine sadly often attracts. I look at your letters page and shake my head in disbelief: I can't believe that there are such truly stupid people around today. It's no wonder that nobody has won your  prize for the best letter when most of the scribbles you receive aren't even in joined up writing. After leaving university, I hope to move into the world of journalism and my ambition is to write for a computer magazine like your very own (yes, I do know what I'm letting myself in for). Yours sincerely, RICHARD MOULTON Ashton-Under-Lyne, Lancashire HIGHLIGHTS OF DICK'S A LEVEL ESSAY: Kids Today! Video Games and the Media If you were to believe...
