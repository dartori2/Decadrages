From Ocean/Imagine's own publicity people, would you believe. Isn't that interesting? We didn't think so either.

"the business. The result, as you'd expect, is pretty naff. Supertrolley, it transpires, is a game of strategy and memory. You start off as a supermarket dogsbody, and your aim is to win promotion by completing tasks in the alloted time. Your first task, for instance, is to stock up bread, and you have 47 game minutes to do it. Before setting off you must stick price labels on a pile of packets, which takes a couple of game minutes, then it's on to the game proper, as your miserable-looking flunky pushes a trolley full of bread around the supermarket in search of the right counter Despite the fact that the playing area seems to be only something like 8x8 screens, it's probably a good idea to make a map of the shop, since most of the 3-D perspective scenes have at least three exits. Displays below the screen show the objects you are carrying, the food type on the counter ahead of you, the day, week, time and score.

I know how he feels, After all, you won't be the first get abstract apparitions after 10 and probably won't be the last points of Theakstons Old Peculiar to try this tactic to put one over on too... the punters. Load up the game, and instead Cynical, moi?

I found myself getting quite addicted, despite my initial irritation at the lack of originality The Prohibition, you need to be quick on the trigger and fast on your feet to defeat the various nasties that come at you.

Oh yes, the quicker you zap the target the more you score To move from level to level you must defeat the Awesome Wobbly Balloon, more commonly known in instruction-speak as the magnetic meteor globe. This takes several hits to destroy and it's hard to get a direct shot at the thing. But if you succeed you see our hero in an Impossible Mission type lift, moving up to another futuristic cityscape where more enemies lurk. The action gets faster the further you get into the game, and the targets get harder to spot. Graphics on the Spectrum version I looked at were pretty good. Some of the nasties you shoot at are pretty big. The nice A React quickly Godzilla type monsters were my favourites. Animation is a bit futuristic Mad Max-style landscape creaky and the sounds are basic complete with damaged buildings, Spectrum bleeps and burps. designer pipework and those nasty Lee Enfield isn't a bad game, but minions of the Yellow Shadow it's still just a copy of Prohibition ready to gun you down. Quickly with frills and as that should be a moving your gunsight, you zero in budget-price release. Then it on the target and hit the would be a real bargain. fire-button. Budda-budda-budda!

While your lifemeter shows the amount of energy you have remaining, one good punch or shot and you're dead, so the best advice is to stay clear of any physical contact. The characters are nicely animated, with your hero assuming an appropriately macho pose as he fires, and the hooded baddies crumpling satisfyingly, especially if you catch them in the middle of a mid-air leap.

By the middle of the 21st Century, man's insatiable appetite for energy has necessitated the deployment of a number of huge nuclear power stations in permanent orbit around the Earth. As luck would have it, some incredibly inconsiderate alien life-form has chosen one of these power stations to live in, feeding off the raw energy being produced by the core of the reactor. The action takes place in the four levels of the power station and is viewed from above through a multi-directional "

Somewhere beneath this adaptation of a Jack Higgins best-seller is an interesting story of morality and a man who wants to renounce violence.

In a fit of generosity it was the drink they decided to give a load of creepy-crawlie goodies to C+VG Readers. Not only that they sat me down and made me sign a lucky for you 13 posters which I'm giving away. And all for nothing! That rather nice young deputy editor from C+VG, Paul Boughtonsuch a pleasant character, full of fun, helpful, contented with his lot-is looking after them right now. So you can be sure they are safe. All you have to do is write into the Great Grotbags Frightmare Giveaway, Computer + Video Games, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London ECIR 3AU. All the entries will be put into the hat and the lucky names pulled out will be a winner.

The dearth of decent Amstrad games continues with only the odd game arriving in the office which is worth dusting down the 464 for. Such a game is Arkenold 022160 1 00000 Revenge of Doh. Is Imagine the only software house turning out decent Amstrad games these days? Of course, it's the old, old Breakout/Tonic Tiles/Addictaball/Trazz/Arkenoid 1 formula re-made, re-modelled and re-marketed. But it's still a damn good game worth shelling out for The Amstrad version is probably the hardest of all the Breakout clones I've played. It took an enternity to clear the first screen-due mainly to the fact that the first line of bricks had to hit at least three times before disappearing and that the bat movement was so slow. It was like playing in treacle. However, once the first line of defence crumbles things become a little easier. The weapon capsules come thick and fast, dropping not just singly but in whole clusters, making it difficult to choose which one to go for. I often found I got "
