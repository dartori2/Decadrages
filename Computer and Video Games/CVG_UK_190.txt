"computer video games EDITORIAL computer games BOX FRESHI EDITOR: PAUL DAVIES  DEPUTY EDITOR: TOM GUISE ART EDITOR: JAIME SMITH SENIOR WRITER: ED LOMAS SENIOR WRITER: STEVE KEY STAFF WRITER: ALEX HUHTALA hought I should let you know that I'm (un)fortunate to be one of the world's first generation games players. Which is the most interesting way of saying that I'm old enough to remember the first ZX 81 games. This is both good and bad. It's great because I can call upon over 15 years of experience. However it's dangerous because I'm less likely to be awestruck by something I consider as a 'rip off\". You'll find it pretty hard to impress most older players. We're such a pain in the neck, so used to finding fault. However, something I've learned to appreciate in recent months is that not everyone has experienced the same benchmark titles as the staff on CVG. CONTRIBUTORS: DAVE KELSALL, JASON FRENCH, PAUL GLANCEY, CARL WHITE, KARIM BORHANUDDIN, GARY RYAN THANKS TO: JAMES MORRIS, BEN ENGLISH, PHIL JOE PUBLIC' DAWSON SPECIAL THANKS TO: SIMON FARMER, DAVID DOAK, SAM LEE, THE SPIRIT OF THE MAD GAMER US CORRESPONDENT: MATT TAYLOR JAPAN CORRESPONDENT: WARREN HARROD X Not everyone is comparing Mario 64 to Super Mario World; Tekken 3 to Yie Ar Kung-Fu. Thank goodness. There were a lot of comparisons to be made at E3. Few were disappointing, which is a bonus, but the fact everything looked so similar was a worry. However it occurred to me that players new to the scene would still be amazed. Just like music, popular styles will be adapted by different artists, and the many interpretations of Mario 64 Croc, Banjo Kazooie, etc contain enough magic of their own to be worthwhile. All the best new games to come out of E3 are presented this month for your expert eyes only.

This includes the journey to and from, and 18 months digging around for Martian cackola. Apparently the conditions are pretty extreme for the cosmonauts involved all that time cramped together with nothing but work to occupy their minds. Lack of exercise putting their health at risk, possibly not being able to walk very well at the end. Why didn't they come to us for advice. We've been working under similar conditions for almost three years now, and we're still here. So what's our secret?

"PAUL DAVIES computer video games CVG RATING SYSTEM 5 ...EXCELLENTERI ......... . Rumour is that Paul Davies has gone mad. It's completely false. Paul didn't buy Sonic Jam which is a surprise, but isn't madness. Compared to his former self, yes Paul Davies is quite different. In past months he would have bought two copies of Sonic Jam one for playing, another for safe keeping. This leaves a kind of void in Paul's life, which is so huge that it can be glimpsed through his eyes. What's taken its place is obviously too terrible for the rest of CVG to imagine. So they avert their eyes from his gaze, and mutter the word mad under their breaths. If and when Plan X is revealed, all will become clear. ............................. ........................................... Pure magic, enough to make a 1 grown man cry. Every game which hits the High Five is essential. Let there be no doubt, this is depth and vision beyond belief. GELVET EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES  PANZER RPG RAGE RACER  TROUBLE MAKERS SA.GA FRONTIER  GRANDIA OHET RECOM TOM GUISE 4.VERY GOOD y Usually the highest we feel confident awarding a game. Ranks among the best in its field, or surprises us with elements of well implemented originality. 13.GOOD Something you may want to own, as opposed to renting out for a couple of days. Here is a quality, entertaining game to suit most tastes. Good, but not great. If you're wondering why Tom looks cool this one time, it's because he recently paid to have his hair cut. Someone must've broken his mixing bowl. Tom is a tragic case a playboy with absolutely no money, Everything is done with economy in mind, without sacrificing quality. His look is obtained from a cou ple of genuine designer items mixed and matched to extremes with M&S, etc. Should you ever meet Tom, you'll notice how he moves about a lot and screams at the top of his voice. This has two effects: you don't have chance to clock the label on his jeans, and you're too embarrassed to raise your head to check in the first place. DEP EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  TIME CRISIS (PS)  HOUSE OF THE DEAD RAGE RACER  DUNGEON KEEPER  SCUD RACE 2. PRETTY BAD u ...VERY POOR Unlikely to be especially original, or overflowing with exciting features there are better examples available. Or else this is a clumsy attempt at a new concept. ED LOMAS Almost a flat-liner, it's so lifeless. You'll be wanting to exchange this for something else straightaway. Save yourself the bother by avoiding in the first place. We've found that Ed has an alternative approach to recording special events in his life. Where usually people would photograph their friends, and occasionally themselves with their friends, Ed snaps the scene. So for Glastonbury those who couldn't go will be pleased to review lots of pictures of mud. Or count the number of tents in this field as opposed to that one. It's definitely wrong, but works somehow. Ed's special peripheral photography technique is now available for Weddings. Why focus on the centre stage, when there's a newsagent and a grocers across the road? Could also be a few crisp packets in the gutter to remember. FAIR COMMENT BIG GIRL'S BLOUSE CURRENT FAV GAMES SONIC JAM  QUAKE  HOUSE OF THE DEAD  MONKEY ISLAND 3  TIME CRISIS STEVE KEY Hold onto your solicitors. Apparently, so long as we put this little box here, CVG can get way with saying exactly what it likes, when it likes, in the manner it likes, and for ever! Just to make it clear that everything written in CVG is based on our own personal opinion. Fact boxes which head the reviews comprise of information from the relevant companies, or is to the best of our knowledge. Also the news section of the magazine is full of information which we have found to be true, and is correct at the time of going to press. Basically if we say it's good, we think it's good. And when we say it's crap, we honestly think it's crap. We don't have any big organisation breathing over our shoulders influencing review scores or anything sordid like that. We're clean! Long live the truth! Of Steve's many hidden talents, the one which has impressed us the most is the ability to play the cornet. Lunchtimes are now enriched by solos from the New World Symphony (Hovis, by gum) and on Ilkley Moor Bah t'at. Money from the CVG swear box is being saved to buy Steve a mute, so that he can entertain us with his versions of old 70s sitcom themes. It's kind of a shame that there isn't a Docklands Brass Band for Steve to join, as this would definitely be another marketable attraction for the area. Docklands isn't so friendly towards people who enjoy music. There could be an uprising soon. if it weren't for Steve and his cornet...well. HOTTER ON THE INSIDE AMV/GVG CHALLENGE IS A HITI SENIOR STAFF WRITER CURRENT FAV GAMES  STAR FOX 64  TIME CRISIS  V-RALLY QUAKE  PARAPPA THE RAPPER ALEX HUHTALA 100% PURE HUHTALA ueues outside of Manchester's store, reports of hysteria at Blackpool. Serious competition at London and Croydon. The HMV/CVG Challenge has been a great success, all thanks to those CVG readers who made it happen. As you should know, the first Challenge Game was Namco's Rage Racer. It was good to see all the best players totally ignore our advice! Instead applying their own incredible skills to power slide the Gnade car to the finish line. Best times on the Lakeside Gate circuit hung around the 1:42:00 mark. Our rough guide would've enabled times of around 1:56:00. You're the best, as if we didn't already know it. Let's try and make the Star Fox Challenge even bigger. We want to see crowds outside all participating stores. Where the numbers are big enough, you can guarantee a few photographers will be on the case. Get your mug in the national paper, and certainly CVG. Go for it! More details of how to take part in news and the Challenge pages this issue. It's the time during Alex's two week holiday. So excuse us for having nothing to record here. Other than his place has been take by Gary, our honourary Work Experience geezer. And before you all start writing in, Gary's place here, was pretty much a one off occasion. Just where he's not a cheeky git, or up his own backside like some of the people who apply. Anyone who sent in their class fied Ad this month, or submitted a great letter for MailBag should be grateful to Gary for typing them in On our part, we're glad that Gary didn't cost us a penny to keep and completed his work in the kind of speed we used to expect from Alex, before the CVG rot started to set in. Everything back to normal next month, friends. OUT OF STOCK CURRENT FAV GAMES  DARK CASTLE (MD) ROAD FIGHTER (NES) ATARI KARTS (JAG)  SATURN DOOM (SAT)  TOM & JERRY (SNES) JAIME SMITH Something not mentioned in Paul's little story is the Discman he is so proud of. This is because Jaime now owns the next model up, making Paul's shabby (but expensive) effort irrelevant. Did Jaime do this deliberately so that he would remain the coolest CVG figure, unquestioned? Or was it purely an accident, not intended to provoke suicidal thoughts in the mind of his Editor (and friend). Our opinion favours the second scenario. Since Jaime, does own the coolest Discman on the magazine. It even has a special carrying case. And if Paul feels like diving off the new footbridge at Canary Wharf that's his business. ART EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  TETRIS JNR  SSF2 X  MARIO KART 64  SUPER MARIO BROS  SSF2 EDITORIAL JASON FRENCH They were shooting the Spice Girls movie near our place the other week. So we took Jason down to watch the event, hoping his good looks would get him part and really put CVG on the map. Since that failed, we started a small riot which gained the support of a few mothers who were obviously outraged at our Jason being ignored. You may have read some thing about this in the papers. Our next attempt at marketing Jason as this year's big thing will be to, sneak him onto the Big Breakfast with Alex. To make this story interesting, we'll finish with the news that Oz Browne is alive and well, working on cool projects at Titan books.

"15, Rosey bank Cottages, Parsons Court, Buxton, Derbyshire, SKI7 9IJ June 17 1997 Tizer. AG Barr plc. North Road, Atnerton MANCHESTER, M46 OBZ. Dear Si.s, It is with regret that I wish to make a form Complaint. Tne past few days of our lives have been nothing short of absolute hell. It all started when our nephew took a photograph of my wife and I (a copy of which is enclosed. He claimed it was for the photo album we had kindly given him last Christmas. He lied. It turns out that he is a viawer of a programme called The Chart Show. I have since learnt that this is a Satysday morning televsion show based on the popular hit parade. Everybweek on this programme you place za advertisiments for your fizzy drink Tizer. You ask viewers to send in photographs of friends or relatives that look a bit dull, boring perhaps.

MAILBAG.CVG@ECM.EMAP.COM THE FAMOUS MR ED CVG ere's the drain for you to empty HELP US OUT HERE your brain, the pages where grey matter turns to psychedelic spew. Your cola-fuelled view of the world of video games. We love to read. No, really we do. Take a break from whatever it is you're playing, count to ten, and grab your pen. Hey, we're poets but didn't realise (?). Your words are wanted CVG: Okay Nintendo, by the UK's gaming community! Don't this is getting very forget we have an e-mail address. Use it a bit, why don't you! Dear CVG, I get  a month. I can get a [Nintendo 64) game every six months if I don't buy your magazine. So you are losing out as well. If Mario 64 only took me three weeks to complete, that means I payed for less than a month's entertainment. I am sick and tired of game prices, so come on Nintendo I am speaking for everyone. Bring down those prices. Gavin Cullen, Earlston Dear CVG, I've had a Tamagotchi for about a week and I think they are a great idea. I've played games with him (Pugsley aged 8, going strong) fed and disciplined him, given him medication and even cleaned up his cacks. I'm going to name my next pet 'Ed' after your living Tamagotchi Senior Staff Writer. PS: How about a FFVII poster or preview video in a future issue of CVG? lan Chaddock, Guilden Sutton serious! Drop your prices or we're out of business! MAILBAG.CVGECM.EMAP.COM MERCY (00) CVG: Final Fantasy VII is about to happen BIG TIME in CVG. Anyone opposing the idea should get their letters in soon. TAMAGOTCHI CRECHE UNLOVED. MAD RAMBLINGS OF THE GAMING MASSIVE! Dear CVG, I am writing in to complain about Eubasaben Jessop who wrote in thinking your PlayStation reports were biased and you were trying to make all your readers buy one. Well, after I read that letter, I read all the PlayStation reports and none of them were biased and they didn't make me go out and buy two or three PlayStations. So, Mr Jessop, if you are reading this, I think your letter was a load of crap. David McMahon, Kilsyth Dear Sir/Madam, It has come to our attention that you are in the possession of an unregistered Tamagotchi egg. We are also aware that this defenceless creature was bought from a black market, and therefore has not had the necessary upbringing to ensure a long, healthy life. I know that you are fond of the Tamagotchis as I have read your articles on the subject, and was enlightened, and overjoyed, that someone is taking an interest. However, I must express my distaste at the Twisted Tamagotchi Ideas section. I was disturbed and shocked at the suggestions as they are barbaric and evil. I can honestly say that these comments, although undoubtedly joking, are most offensive. They are the Tamagotchi equivalent of. kicking a dog in its knackers, and must cease!! Chris \"Boggs\" Bates, Woodsetts CVG: Great minds think alike. The only thing we're biased for or against is good video games versus bad video games. MANGA MANIAC MONOLOGUE Dear CVG, I'm a 12 year old boy and all of my friends think I'm sad because I like computers. And my friends who do like me think I'm sad because own a Saturn and like Sega. When they have a conversation about computers they start talking about there new Nintendo 64 or PS. They start saying that if they made games like this on the Saturn, it couldn't handle this or can't do that. They say that with games like Tomb Raider 2 and Tekken 3 coming out for the PS and Starfox and... erm something else the Saturn will have no chance. In sad times like this I try to think why I did buy my Saturn. 1. I'm a die hard Sega fan. 2. I like AM2 games (from the arcade) and want to play them whenever I can. 3. The games you cover in your book made by Sega I drool over! So all I'm trying to say is all of you Saturn fans who thinks the Saturn is going to die in the next day, just think about what you can have to look towards to. VF3, Project Sonic, and Saturn Quake. Do you agree CVG?! Paul Street, Leeds Dear CVG, Why don't you put more manga pictures and articles in the magazine. In some respects I enjoy watching manga video more than playing games, though I am fanatical about both. I find it hard to obtain Japanese magazines which are more dedicated to it, so I rely on CVG to provide for my needs. The problem is though, that you don't have nearly enough pictures on the subject, so am asking you to put more pictures. Name and address lost! CVG: Get a yourself a sense of humour (00 Chris! And our Tamagotchis weren't bought on the black market, they came direct from outer space. Tamagotchis are our friends! CHRIS'S OTHER LETTER CVG: Not everyone loves manga, or anime. This is the reason publishers go to obscene lengths to replace original artwork for Japanese games released in the US and/or UK. We do our best to honour everyone's interests. Sorry, the cleaners whipped your letter away before we could finish typing in (they're super-efficient, see). SU111  Dear CVG, Your mag is the only one 'ard enough to designate a full double-page spread to the little [Tamagotchi] blighters! I got my first from Japan, and have been hooked since. However, it does have its downside. Deciding it wants attention in the middle of an A-Level exam, for example! Anyway I read the spread with relish, and I think a Tamagotchi Q&A would be great. Any plans to release Tamgotchi 2 or 3 over here? Chris \"Boggs\" Bates, Woodsetts HIS ARSE NOT OURS Dear CVG, I would just like to say, as a true GAME fan, that your magazine is a breath of fresh air in a world of guff. Biased my arse, excited more like. I have been reading CVG since the days of cover tapes (C64, Spectrum) and am proud of it. Shaun Perry, Fenton CVG: Ignoring the obvious success of PlayStation, there are still some awesome games lined up for Saturn. There are considerably less of them, but the quality is there. CVG: Hey Chris, try thinking about something else. 12 "


"ULTIMATE FIGHTER SELECT BLUMMIN' GREAT PUDDIN FIGHTERS MEGAMIX GETS A KICKING computer video games Dear CVG, As a I've been addicted to pixelated pleasure since 'PONG gamer', it hurts me to see how many gamers have lost sight of the cause: The quest for the ultimate gaming experience. I have been on this quest for well over 15 years, and there's only one thing I have to say to all those bickering gamers out there. It matters not which technological gadget you own, all that matters is that you acquire the rush from PAUL VS PEDRO the game on that gadget. As I recall, when the proverb 'the proof of the pudding' was written, nothing was mentioned about which oven it was cooked on. I have owned many machines on my search, and at the moment my three primary sources are: a rapidly aging PC, a Saturn, and last but not least a PlayStation. Why do I not have an N64 yet? 1) South Africa it takes a while to get anything cool OK! 2) As yet I have seen nothing gameswise drawing me there yet. I have a feeling that TUROK may change all that. I will see. I am not nuking the N64. What I'm disappointed in is the programmers eg: Shadows of the Empire. From Maniac Mansion to Rebel Assault, LucasArts have astounded and amazed. Why oh why now have they rushed this one out? Was it time? As gamers we must bond together and start letting programmers know that we want good products and won't stand for gump. We want good conversions on all machines, each version using that machine's strength. NO BIAS NO COMPETITION AMONG BRANDS. That is why I'm so absolutely gobsmackingly happy to see 'ULTIMATE FIGHTING UNIVERSE' guys getting together to give us the BEST GAME POSSIBLE! Spank you for reading this. Sir Joe, Durban, South Africa CVG: We too are on a quest for the Ultimate Gaming Experience. Paul used to offer something approximating this in his bedroom, but it's being refurbished at the moment. Unfortunately for you Sir Joe, Ultimate Fighting Universe was an April Fool gag. So look elsewhere. Good message though, cheers. More letters from around the world please! SULLA GREAT IDEAS R US DONT MENTION IT Dear CVG, Thank you for printing a sixteenpage advert for Tekken 3 (issue #188). Perhaps the moves lists would have taken up four pages? Gareth Crowley, Thirsk Dear CVG, What the hell are you on, spouting on about Fighters Megamix? The game is terrible. It's the most boring, untactical, pathetically crap game ever to be rated by a magazine as excellent. A High Five and endless rantings indeed! You can spout about gameplay all day long but what about the other things that used to be considered when deciding whether a game was any good or not? You've forgot all about graphics, music, and sound effects, as your rubbish 'improved rating system shows. The graphics in the game are absolutely awful. They're ultra grainy and in really low resolution, the colour choices are disgusting and the characters' faces are funny rather than cool (look at Lion's win animation. The characters are also out of proportion as any selfrespecting artist would know. I bet Capcom had a good laugh at it. The animation isn't that bad, but the overall speed of the game is. It's ridiculously slow on the NTSC version, never mind what the PAL system must have done to it. To top that off, it also has tremendous slow down, as bad as early SNES games. Fight using a character wearing armour on Jane's level for maximum (or should that be minimum?) effect. The '3D'environment is also extremely laughable. The camera angles are pathetic and undramatic and the 3D' engine overall lacks any sense of involvement. The music is rubbish (not the tunes, the quality) and the sound effects are perhaps the worst I have never heard, exactly the same as Fighting Vipers, rather than the cool and fun sound effects from most of the VF series. Moving on to what you are so obviously raving about, the gameplay it's crap. It's basically just Fighting Vipers with knobs on. Most importantly, missing from VF is the different methods of getting up off the ground and the attacks that go with them. Instead you end up constantly pressing up or down or cheesily using the escape button to rise in a veritable millisecond. The game is slow, boring, untactical, and un-fun and has far far too many moves for most players to get to grips with. Anyone other than an expert will only be able to properly use about 2 of the 22 characters. Forget the worst ever secret characters, I'm not even going to moan about them because there's no point in embarrassing Sega more than they have embarrassed themselves by including such rushed 'additions'. The complete presentation of the game is awful. One of the most rushed pieces of software ever. After its conception 'Virtuas Vs Vipers' and the task of putting them both in the same game, they just stuck in any old rubbish that was quickest, dull options, a fake one-player mode that only records one time for each 'course', pathetic Vs screens, the aforementioned 'embarrassing secret > characters' and the saddest endings ever. All Namco's games beat the life out of this. Record screens are one of the most important things in a game. They keep you playing for ages trying to beat your, and other peoples, times and scores. Namco realise this, as the amount of record screens in Tekken 2 and Soul Edge show. Tekken 2 and Soul Edge are so so deep. I bought Fighters Megamix a day or so after its Japanese release on December 20th, so don't accuse me of not playing it for long enough. And all you idiots reading this letter with your writing hand itching, waiting to write in and accuse me of being 'up Sony's arse' I'm not biased at all. Less than any of you in fact. I own two Saturns (a Japanese NTSC and an English PAL) and one PlayStation and one Japanese NTSC N64. So that's p****d over your parade. The bottom line is that Fighters Megamix is CRAP. J Tilbrook, Sheffield. 13 CVG: Yeah, but you would have missed out on all that awesome artwork. That issue is now highly collectible by the way. : a poem about : Dear CVG, I've been playing computer games now for 14 years and have developed a knowledge of what would think is a good game. 1) If I had an idea for a game is there an address where I can send it or will I have to send it to each games company individually? 2) If I have to send it to each individual company do you know if they tend to look at it or just throw it away? 3) If they just throw it away, is there any way in which I can improve my chances of them looking at it? eg. Full text and diagram for each vehicle in the game, all word-processed etc... 4) I think you should run a monthly page or competition to design an ace game. The winner wouldn't win anything, except the fact companies would know about it and may be paying attention to it. 5) Do you know of any games that have evolved from someone sending an idea to a company? Thanks for your time and answering my questions (if you do). Cheers. Matt Simpson, Milton Keynes. Bubbles by Purple Ronnie  Vimto is a smashing drink So why not have a slurp It's full of fizzy bubbles That will make your bottom burp as drunk by Purple Ronnie CVG: Competition pages for the best games idea is a great suggestion. You can bet that lots of games have been influenced by the occasional letter from the general public, though usually games are tested using groups of people playing the game's during development. That's what a Games Tester does. Anyhow, We Design-A-Game pages are under serious consideration. CVG: No it's not. Sputs Puts a smile on your to your faces "


"computer video games SONY ony PlayStation is now the closest a games console has ever been to creating an alternative Hollywood. PlayStation games have also become as free and personal as music. It is just accepted that PlayStation is THE format. This incredible, but undeniable, situation has been brought about by two things: Sony's choice of CD as the format, and, more specifically to them, Sony giving their developers a lot of time and money to explore their creativity. Sony's presence was huge at E3. Most people commented that this was not remarkable all the variety and glamour is now the least we expect. On with their show: FINAL FANTASY VII DEVELOPED BY: SQUARESOFT his will be Sony's biggest game of the year. If not in Europe, in America the sales will be astronomical. CVG first brought this game to your attention approximately a year and a half ago, knowing FFVII would make such a big impact. FFVII magically combines live action with FMV. Sephiroth is one of the most sinister characters in the game... UK FINAL FANTASY VII IN NOVEMBER! SONY. Squaresoft's RPG is amazing; mysterious; delightful; scary; grand; personal, and very stylish. This we tried to demonstrate through our coverage of the Japanese version earlier this year. So get ready for the shock the US version of FFVII, destined to become a UK version soon after, is enhanced over the Japanese original! From the feedback Squaresoft received from a large number of the three million players already out there, improvements have been made. These include a more balanced difficulty setting for battles, an improved menu system, specifically with regard to the Materia options, and all new Elementals (the awesome magical creatures which assist during battle). New narratives and aside scenes may also strengthen the storyline. Reading between the lines we don't expect anything to be taken away, the issue mainly seems to be a matter of clarity in presentation. A statue which symbolises the mysterious Jenova project.  84. The UK is still on schedule for launch sometime before Christmas. Hopefully Sony Europe will follow the American lead by releasing one million demo disks to players prior to launch. Whatever they choose to do, expect expert coverage of this monumental game only in CVG. By using magic stones called materia', the heroes in FFVII can summon the elements to attack!! A basic magic attack from early in the game. Nothing has been removed (censored) from the English language version of FFVII. Not even the bedroom scenes! 14 "


"RAPID RACER computer video games 1529 DEVELOPED BY: SCEE peed boat racing for one or two players, taking place in a variety of exotic locations. A genius graphics routine, combined with neatly placed subtleties makes Rapid Racer of special interest. In the first instance the water effect, which even the development team in London admit to being unrealistic but cool, is very impressive. It's not as lifelike as seen in Nintendo's Wave Race 64, but the experience is quite similar. The small but effective gameplay boundaries make up for the rest you feel as though the boat is being tossed from 'wave' to 'wave', and you can cut up boats in your wake. A rate of 50 frames per second adds the final sheen. Expect Rapid Racer to have a pretty huge profile when it's released over here in Autumn. The dance band Apollo 440, who remixed U2 and Manic Street Preachers tracks, have composed a soundtrack exclusively for the game. It has cool all of its own, without imitating the techno in Wipeout. All in all another new lifestyle ideal for you to buy into, courtesy of the Sony marketing machine. And it will work. SONY Rapid Racer is developed to be a fun game. Trying to take the challenge of predicting the waves seems too frustrating, as the physics aren't as convincing as Wave Race 64. It's possible to make the current work for you, which is pretty lifelike. But after you've encountered the first uphill section you have to wonder. An additional set of fractal circuits, all randomly generated, is designed to screw your head up, no doubt about it! The feature which we expect to make or break the game is how much fun it is to customise the boats, and how this effects the balance of the game how much it's possible to cheat. Extreme conditions on the water require a stomach of steel to survive. Especially if you're viewing the race from inside the boat. ROSCO MCQUEEN DEVELOPED BY: SCEE RAPID RACER AND ROSCO MCQUEEN 3D adventure with a unique twist fire fighting. Rosco is a firefighter, who appears to double as some kind of government agent. Though extinguishing flames is a prime directive, it's only part of his overall mission objective. The ultimate goal is to prevent the villain Sylvester T Square from doing whatever it is he's planning to do with the world. A pretty spectacular indoor garden display about to go up in smoke! The scene is set within the tallest building in the (fictitious) world the Tower XS. Aside from setting alight all the floors in the building, which any crack fire brigade could handle, Sylvester has stationed armies of robots, and laid fiendish traps to stop those who might try to catch him. To make life hotter, the Tower XS employees have not been able to escape and are at risk. It's an interesting mix for the player to be presented with. They're fun to work out too, and Rosco is given a selection of power-ups to make bigger and better reactions take place as he progresses. Water bombs cloak large areas in water and can be detonated from a distance. Rosco's state-of-the-art mega hose can also be upgraded to form a more powerful jet. Nitro is used to freeze objects. Some enemies malfunction if frozen, and are then used as improvised weapons against others. 1995 Inside of this neon barrier Rosco is safe from harm. COVE! CTORY The fires are, of course, the stars of the show and creOnce the path is cleared, Rosco is left to negoate all-new dilemmas for players to consider. There is tiate the tricky platforms.

"computer video games NIGHTMARE CREATURES DEVELOPED BY: KALISTO aken on board by Sony because of its innovative 3D engine. One player takes control of a male or female defender against evilIgnatius or Nadia. Both are highly articulate, polygon-based characters capable of a wide range of combat moves. These are activated by directionals with corresponding button presses. Combinations of moves can also be linked. It ain't quite Vampire Saviour, but it's a first for this style of game. Plus it's a lot of fun dishing out the damage. Enemies such as this werewolf have intelligence enough to find your weakness! All 24 of the enemy characters are programmed with substantial artificial intelligence enough to make each one-to-one combat situation a challenge. To help overcome them players must look out for power-up items. These might include strength-giving potions, or special keys. Hopefully the large range of mission objectives, and the difficulty of destroying evil will make Nightmare Creatures a classic. On the receiving end are various creatures of the night, such as zombies and demons, in the service of the Brotherhood of Hecate. The confrontations take place in 19th Century London, which means lots of fog and gloomy corners as backdrops to the action. There are 15 core-blimey districts to exorcise in total. DEVELOPED BY: MILLENIUM COVER STORY NIGHTMARE CREATURES AND MEDIEVIL SONY his 3D take on Capcom's classic Ghouls and Ghosts series looks wonderful, and is fun to play. The premise is very simple-free-reign through 30 levels represented in detailed 3D, blasting anything that moves. You're Sir Daniel Fortesque this time around. A skeleton, in fact, whose accomplice is a tiny worm (only useful once, we discovered). Just like in Ghouls and Ghosts, Sir Dan is armed with a wide range of weapons, including daggers, swords, lightning bolts, and... chicken drumsticks. The majority of which must be found before use. Other potential treasures include potions to enhance weapon power (just like G&G), or provide temporary invulnerability. This shot is taken from an early version of the game. In the finished game we there will be enemies coming out of the coffins. I!! The game adopts the end of level guardian approach to adventuring, seven in total, to break up the routine. Additional spice is added through 13 FMV sequences which, like all good FMV sequences before them, help to enhance the experience, and not bore you whitless. Honest. No, this time they really are good! We have a lot of respect for Millennium and Medievil. Since Capcom haven't already seen the sense in attempting Ghouls and Ghosts in 3D, Millennium deserve all the credit for trying. It's a fiendish trick to pull off, but it seems they're on the right track. 16 Dramatic camera angles change to suit the situation. "


"BLASTO computer video games DEVELOPED BY: SCEA ore of a pictorial update Il for you this month, rather than hard info. Sony are being uncharacteristically protective over Blasto. This is a game setting out to prove a lot about the PlayStation's technical capabilities, and so far doesn't look so special. According to Sony, Blasto is \"marked by innovative 3D gameplay\". In our experience it's like a heavily stylised Mario 64, with guns! Instead of Yoshi, Blasto rides a giant space chicken. Not a bad thing to begin with, then. Sony's problem is that few of Blasto's graphic style is very reminiscent of the the textures have been applied yet, and it's tough to classic Warner Bros cartoons. Sony intend to add gauge how effective the free-roaming 3D environment will much more detail before the game is finished. be when so little of it was in place at E3. Though the game engine is said to be 60% complete, those foundations are yet to be built upon to any significant degree. But the concept is amazing, and Blasto is a great character. One huge sci-fi world streamed continuously from the CD, replacing the stop/start nature of cartridge games. The there's the voice of Phil Hartman (Troy McClure) as Blasto echoing about the place. Will be cool. OLE SONY Not sure what Blasto's firing at here, but the glowing effect from his gun is cool, so... 1 Obviously it's not a good idea to run Blasto into these burners. But One graphical touch that Sony are happy about we'll give it a go anyway! at this stage is the light-sourcing. ..... CRASH BANDICOOT 2: CORTEX STRIKES BACK BLASTO AND CRASH 2 DEVELOPED BY: NAUGHTY DOG rash finds himself wearing a jet-pack a most impressive sight, and a fun experience. This is \"more than just a revision of the initial game engine\". So it's the initial game engine, revised, plus more geddit? The 'more' part is essentially the new set of tight-as-a-gnat's-chuff levels to negotiate. But if you think that's where Jason Rubin's talented team are gonna leave it, you obviously don't know Naughty Dog too well. In the sequel Crash gets to ride jet skis, goes flying, and can string combos of moves together for some tasty coot-style combat. Naughty Dog are claiming Crash 2 is twice the size of the original. If your brain survived that level of stress, twice the intensity is obviously what you were born to appreciate. The levels are all accessed from several \"centralized rooms\", making Crash 2 closer to Super Mario World on a 32-bit console than has ever been dared before. Naughty Dog already proved that they can do great platform-games, albeit twisted. This sequel should set that reputation in stone. COVER STORY The new jet-pack feature is really cool. Crash can fly left, right, into or out of the screen. The Bandicoot's trademark spin attack takes out this new weirdo character. With an army of Hollywood producers from Universal offering their full support, there's no doubt at CVG that Crash will make a significant impact on PlayStation when he returns this Christmas. "


"computer video games Nintendo A show nyone walking casually through E3 would have ended up at Nintendo for one simple reason they were impossible to miss. The most noise, and the most excitement! All of the really cool Nintendo titles appeared only on the huge TV screen, courtesy of yet another video: F-Zero 64, Yoshi's Island and Zelda. Playable versions of their newest platform games Banjo kazooie and Conker's Quest were there, though the star of the booth perhaps even the show was Goldeneye! ORARE BANJO KAZOOIE DEVELOPED BY: RARE Nintendo If you look past the obvious Mario 64 references, BK could represent another big platform game for the N64. Initial feelings told people that it had all the same features as Mario right down to the butt-stomp. But there appears to be a lot more depth to BK. For a start, the two characters Banjo (a bear) and Kazooie (a bird) can link together to perform double moves. The bird can carry Banjo to higher ledges, and use its beak as extra attacks. There are 24 different combinations of moves between the two of them. Banjo can also morph with Kazooie to form other animals (an ant is one of those seen already) which give access to other hidden parts of the levels. Graphically. BK has benefited from the early limitations experienced through Mario. Textures have been added to almost everything in the game, giving it a more realistic look. The version at the show was around 65% complete, so with any luck we could be having a preview version next issue. It's hard to ignore the obvious similarities between this and Super Mario 64. The main characters aren't just restricted to the ground either! Chocks away! NINTENDO UNVEIL BANJO KAZOOIE AND CONKER'S QUEST! This ant is one of the many creatures that Banjo and Kazooie can change into when they morph together to form a better animal. BARN CONKER'S QUEST DEVELOPED BY: RARE oded by Rare, the same people responsible for U Banjo kazooie, and their first game published by them, rather than through Nintendo/THE. The first and possibly most important thing about Conker's Quest is that its style is very similar to Banjo kazooie. But it's also plainly obvious from the name of the game alone, that this is aimed at a far younger audience. Details are sparse on the game, but from what we saw it has all the little touches that 'make' platform games. If Conker needs to get energy, he shakes nearby trees and nuts fall out. Conker also carries a slingshot as an additional weapon. The camera angles can be rotated, as in Mario, so you can look all around the levels if you think you're getting stuck. Conker also has a girlfriend called Berri. We don't know as yet what part she plays in the game. Cute characters and bright colours. Pass the sick bag. RAREWARE 18 "

Another game to benefit from the rep of a SNES classic, Yoshi's Island 64. Nintendo claim this is going to be a '2 and a half D' game, which makes you wonder what half a dimension does or even looks like, but we'll soon find out. Being a sideways scrolling game, Nintendo have been able to use a lot more of the Nintendo colour palette and texture tools to make it as bright and bubbly as the original. They have also confirmed that all of the characters will return (Shy Guy was in the early version they had running on the video), so fans would be foolish to ignore it. Again, details are sketchy, so get what you can from the screen shots. Nintendo) NINTENDO UNVEIL BANJO KAZOOIE AND CONKER'S QUEST!

YOU KNOW THE REST e've all heard the lines, seen him woo the various gorgeous women from around the globe and drink his Martini, shaken but not stirred. We've seen the Walther PPK used against some of the most heinous villains on the planet and we've all thought, at least once, \"I'd love to be James Bond.\" Well now you can thanks to new Bond-O-Rama Goldeneye 007 64 available for the bargain price of .99 from all good game stores. Buy it soon folks, you won't be disappointed! After the debacle that was Hexen and Doom 64, Rare prove that first person shooters can be done on Nintendo 64 with Goldeneye, which could be described as the greatest movie tie-in ever, even if it is a year late! We've played the first eight levels, and they are some of the most varied and rewarding seen on the N64 yet. What remains to be seen now, is if Rare can keep this unique feeling throughout the entire game. Then we could have a classic game on our hands! Shooting enemies in certain places can have different effects. Here, this guy has just had his hat blown off! Shoot people in the arms and they stagger about but don't die. WALTHER PPK KF7 SOVIET SNIPER RIFLE KLOBB GRENADE LAUNCHER 06134 WALTHER PPK 7.65 MM As Robbie Coltrane said in the film, \"Walther PPK, 7.65 mm. Only three men I know use such a gun. I believe I've killed two of them.\" James Bond's weapon is legendary. But having one gun for a game like this would be silly. So lets have a look at couple of the other weapons Rare have given 007. As you crawl through the ventilation shaft, you come across this guy sitting on the toilet. Shoot him in the head now! These troops wait for you to fire at them before they retaliate. The Sniper rifle can take him out in one shot to the head. BULLET? WHAT BULLE... Becoming a dead shot with the Sniper rifle is one of the most important parts of Goldeneye. Not only can you save yourself from an all-out close range gun battle but it may also save your ass when a guy is making a dash for the alarms and needs to be stopped quick. When you have the Sniper Rifle equipped, holding the aim button will cause you to look through the sight, subsequently zooming in on the area in front of you. You can then aim onto specific targets to take them out. It is advisable to try and aim for the heads of the troops because 99% of the time, a direct hit to the bonce will result in an instant death. The zoom can also be used as a warning to see what is ahead of you if you're in an open field level, rather than a corridor stage. 20 "


"computer video games U ETERIE ENTERTAINER JUST A STEP TO THE RIGHT Show A handy hint for keeping your energy as high as possible is to use the side step manoeuvre. If you know there are a group of enemies waiting for you around a corner, line yourself up so that you are as close to the edge of the wall as possible without leaving any of your body exposed. Then hold the aim button and tap the left or right c button depending on which way you wish to move. For as long as C is held, you sidestep out into the open and can begin firing at all those in front. If you sense you're in danger, all you have to do is release C and you nip back behind the temporary sanctuary of the wall. NINTENDO LISTEN CAREFULLY, BOND Bond: For England, Alec. 135 CEIVECI OEMFLETED That's gotta hurt! With a steady aim the Sniper Rifle becomes your biggest asset. You can save a lot of time by killing people from long range. Bondi and the oth half? Before each mission, you are given a set of instructions from M and Q, detailing what is expected in the level. It is VITAL that you read these because they often contain clues about how to finish stages with minimum risk of death. For instance, we unwisely skipped through them on the fourth stage, in which it told us not to attempt entry to the underground base via the helipad door. The first thing we did was go for the said door and lo and behold, the klaxon started and panic set in. Within seconds, a troop of at least ten green beret style soldiers came running across the hill, unloading tons of bullets at Bond's head. Needless to say, death was inevitable. THE NAME IS BOND... YOU KNOW THE REST Even the enemy troops have trouble aiming sometimes! Bullets will frequently fly past your nose encouraging you to start killing people quickly! QUIET PLEASE! While the bullet crazy players out there would love to run through the levels mowing down everybody in their way, this tactic will get you nowhere if you want to see the later levels. Stealth is the key word in Goldeneye. While the PPK with silencer is equipped, you don't attract attention when you shoot people. Switch to the Soviet or Klobb, and as soon as you unload on people, enemies swarm all over the place. Keep an eye out for security cameras, because once you get caught in their range, it's time to panic as the alarms ring in your ears. Finally, the coward enemies are also a danger to your health, as they run for the nearest alarm at the first sign of gunfire! When you enter this room, the guard makes a dash for the alarm. Fire through the small door panel to take out the security camera. The explosion alerts all the nearby troops in the area and within seconds of the blast, they've come for you! Being quiet is the key. 21 "

Your main objective for mission six is to prevent the launch of the these silos. And the launch countdown has already begun. The blue object on top of the crates is body armour. It's a very useful bonus to pick up, as it will protect you from more hits. 06:40:30 The gun will move up and aim automatically on guards who are on a slightly higher level to you. MAKE USE OF ANY EQUIPMENT O NINTENDO 64 This is your mission briefing for the third stage. This is a pretty vague instruction from the men upstairs, but if your powers of exploration are good enough you'll soon discover why the hint was subtle...'cos there's a flipping tank parked round the corner! Simply climb onto the top and press B to sit inside. Then cycle through the weapons and find the tank missiles! But they are not nearly as much fun as running people over and listening to them scream! This level becomes incredibly easy once the tank is in your possession, as all you have to do is shoot the turret next to the biplane, jump out of the tank and into the aircraft and it's mission over.  WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU MISTER BOND! The two coloured bars show your health (yellow) and body armour (blue). They appear when you get shot. 006 pu could make it, 007. Dr. Doak: You'll need this decoder to open the bottling room door Good luck, 007. THE NAME IS BOND... YOU KNOW THE REST One of the biggest compliments you can pay Rare on this game, is how recognisable the characters from the film are. It would have been easy for them to paste some shoddy images of Pierce Brosnan onto the bodies of the characters, but he does actually look like himself. As soon as you bump into 006, you'll remember that it is Sean Bean and once you meet Valentin Zukovskij, the bulbous figure of a Mr R Coltrane becomes immediately apparent. And did you know that the faces of entire Rare team have been digitised into the game. Even the gardener has been put in! OBJECTIVE E: COMPLETE 12 400 The double crossing Sean Bean as 006. Don't shoot him, save that for your second meeting! 007 Find the tank, climb in, shoot the tower and jump in the plane. Easy! This isn't one of the in-game views, it's an intro to one of the levels.

"computer video games O SEGA 19 ere's the pick of what Sega had to offer E3. Right or wrong, the impression is that Sega are putting their main effort into future projects, and this line-up is intended to bide the time before major announcements next year. Generally, though, the quality is high. Hope you don't mind but we excluded the Genesis (Mega Drive) stuff, there was nothing new. o SONIC R. DEVELOPED BY: TRAVELLERS TALES/ SONIC TEAM nyone expecting something radical, such as M NIGHTS, from Sonic Team suffered a slight upset with Sonic R. But that's not to say that the new game isn't technically outstanding. VIVES Since Travellers Tales' outstanding work on Sonic 3D and Toy Story for Mega Drive, Sonic Team now trust the Brit developer implicitly. Already TT have conjured a couple of new tricks from the Saturn hardware: fade-in depth-cueing, and multi-layered transparency. Both of which TT claim cannot be achieved on any other system, by the way. These new effects are applied to create clear, smoothrunning 3D landscapes the five Sonic R race circuits.

Players have the pick of Sonic, his friend Tails, girlfriend Amy, eventual partner Knuckles, and sworn enemy Robotnik. The Sonic charas each have special abilities, the only one to be announced so far is Sonic's Spin (for speed boosts, no doubt). Since they all have different means of getting around, they have built in pros and cons too. Robotnik may hover over rough terrain, even water, but can't travel very fast. That type of thing.

"QUAKE computer video games DEVELOPED BY: LOBOTOMY A project deemed impossible by many, but developers Lobotomy (Exhumed) have found a way. Way to go Sega! Strictly speaking this isn't Quake. It's a near perfect interpretation of id's technically magnificent 3D engine, which has established itself as THE PC game since its release last year. What Lobotomy have done is to write their own complex 3D engine to replicate what id's engine does on a high-spec PC. This includes all the tricky stuff like real physics, polygon enemies, and wide open spaces. While Lobotomy were busy doing their thing they hit upon a way to have the Saturn produce light-sourcing in different colours, a new feature being hailed as a cool edition to Quake 2it's not in original Quake on PC! Undead marines run for their unlives as we take the infamous nailgun to 'em! All enemies in Quake are made of polygons. MIT SEGA The great outdoors. The scale of Quake is enormous. Lighting on Saturn Quake is in some ways better than on PC. Outside areas like this require lots of polygons to create. see from the shots here, they're looking pretty cool. There are relatively few enemies present at this early stage also. No link up mode is planned. Expect the enemy count to increase, of course, but not the player configuration. Even Lobotomy say that option is impossible. Quake is as powerful argument as any that Saturn is a very powerful 3D machine if the effort is put in to development. Not even PlayStation can handle Quake, according to Lobotomy. The usual route for PS/PC cross overs is for developers to transport code directly from PC over to PS or vice-versa. Done like this, the game slows down horribly. Only by addressing the Saturn's unique system have Lobotomy been able to achieve such impressive results. That's why it's no surprise to find that one of the team has bright orange hair. Is he from Mars? One final point we should make is about the control system. Lobotomy MUST make use of Sega's cool analogue pad to have Quake play the way it ought to. Only then will players be able to run around, while looking and firing in any direction they choose. The standard digital d-pad option is clumsy and not Quake. Saturn fans relax why pine the loss of Lara Croft when Quake is coming home?! So far the only playable version features just the level select level, and the first two locations from Episode One: Slip Gate Complex, and Castle Of The Damned. As you can THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE.. DUKE NUKEM DEVELOPED BY: LOBOTOMY uake's arch enemy is Duke Nukem. The arguments still rage on as to which is the most fun. At E3 Lobotomy had what appeared to be a near-final version of the game to show off. All the enemies, and weapons. Even Duke's wicked dry wit. Even the dancing girls are here! 9 10 Duke can survey the scene in another room by using the security cameras. DO 20 a 20 Duke Nukem doesn't Erm...don't know what take itself very seriously. this is all about. Some holThis guy has been shrunk!iday program maybe...? As with the Quake situation, Lobotomy aren't running 3D Realms' slick 3D engine on Saturn. It's another imitation. But to the untrained eye it's impossible to tell. In some ways the Saturn handles Duke better than any PC out there. Certainly the lighting effects are better, more natural. There is a slight loss of detail, but the 3D is rock solid, and the textures are clean. COVER STORY ...giggle...snort... OP You can't write your name, but making bullet holes in the wall is a neat touch. T ENT Ingenious devices such as this laser trip wire are unique to Duke Nukem. Saturn Duke Nukem 3D looks so good, it puts the N64 version to shame! It plays fast and smooth as it ought to, so none of the good time thrills are sacrificed. Lobotomy have hinted at the presence of special secret stages, exclusive to the Saturn version also. Remember the Team Dolls from Exhumed? What dastardly tricks must we perform to get our reward this time around?! Can't wait to find out! "

Instead of travelling long distances on foot, the hero in Panzer Dragoon is flown between locations. Sometimes it' possible to affect the shape of the landscape by attacking using the dragon's magic. This might trigger switches to open new routes about the vast map. When the time comes to face your enemy, the battle scene cuts in suddenly and without warning, just like in the Final Fantasy series by Squaresoft. this plant-like creature is called a Rock Bug. The white square outlines are used for targeting. Moving around the enemy could present you with an advantage during battle. A very cool feature! Choosing airborne combat as their theme, Andromeda make it possible to constantly move around the target during battle. This is an innovative first for the RPG game style; a gamble which may well pay off for them. All confronta tions begin with both parties facing each other. However once the initial attacks have taken place, the rider has free dom to circle the enemy. As you can imagine this opens up new tactical possibilities for both the rider and the enemy offensive and defensive strengths or weaknesses may alter dramatically. This will require all players to revise most enemy types so that they can fully exploit their weaknesses and avoid being in the worst possible firing line. 7173 21585/115 Ex2 MAL A giant, slow-moving Boss creature In the exploration scenes the detail of soars overhead.

Experience points are tallied after each victory, taking into account the use of the dragon's berserk attack. Just like in Panzer Dragoon Zwei, not using the berserk is considered very skillful so earns more points. These points are then used to customise the dragon's molecular structure. Several attributes, including speed and strength, are raised or lowered to suit the player's needs. The outside result is that the dragon changes form, ranging in size, shape, and colour.

Less memorable are the circuits, which is a bit of a problem, but die-hard Sega fans will want to learn every minute detail. The difficulty is that the surface is all asphalt.

It's impossible to comment on the 'intelligence of the CPUSPEED controlled cars at this stage since it is not completed yet. The third circuit, and still no sign of any As a finished product for Saturn, we expect that Touring Car surprise track details. Just burn rubber! will have its followers. It's a straight conversion, with nothing revolutionary to offer players who haven't already bought into Daytona USA or Sega Rally.

"computer video games BMG INTERACTIVE wo worthy new games for CVG readers from BMG, both developed by Crystal Dynamics, and both sequels. Titles you've already seen comprised mainly of the DMA projects, two of which received special attention at E3. Grand Theft Auto was shown behind closed doors, so as not to cause any controversy with the American visitors. Tanktics succeeded by winning DMA an award for best creative team. Expect updates on all DMA's great titles coming through BMG, starting next month. Onto the newcomers... PANDEMONIUM 2 GEX 2: ENTER THE GECKO DEVELOPED BY: CRYSTAL DYNAMICS PLAYSTATION DEVELOPED BY: CRYSTAL DYNAMICS PLAYSTATION andemonium 2 is a big improvement in style and content over the original. Nikki and Fargus return, this time equipped with greater skills. More complicated 'platform' obstacles require double jumps, monkey swings, and backflips to negotiate. There's also a fair amount of clinging on by fingertips. ERACTIVE elieve it: Gex 2 is dangerous news for Nintendo! If Mario 64 clones are the best they can support, Crystal Dynamics prove they can do just as well on PlayStation. Gex 2 is a real showcase for how the PS can build complex 3D worlds for versatile, and beautifully-modelled characters such as this pyschedelo-gecko. On top of that, the dynamic lighting effects and detailed textures used by Crystal Dynamics are in many ways superior to what has been seen on N64. Biggest improvements of all are in the level mechanics. Instead of simply jogging left or right the whole time, the heroes are now faced with areas which head off in all directions. Players are still guided through this, but the new element requires sharper decision-making skills. More dramatic viewpoints are planned to make Pandemonium 2 a more breathtaking experience. INI 1 TWO SATISFYING SEQUELS FROM... One of the best scenes to describe the enhanced gameplay in P2 takes place inside a cylindrical tower. Running up the centre of this tower is a an elevator, which stops at walkways heading off in various directions. Nikki/Fargo is required to travel the lift, locating switches that open doors or lower bridges all over the tower. Players must concentrate really hard on the direction, and height of obstacles to solve the puzzle. With improved control over more interesting characters, and ingenious stage design featuring trickier obsta cles, P2 is looking good. Just like Mario in the N64 game, Gex has complete freedom to explore the Media Dimension a place where all the classic scenes from movies go crazy. He is expected to boast around 125 new moves for the sequel, which include the trademark tailwhip, and wall climbing. Once again HBO comedian Dana Gold is providing the voice samples for Gex including 500 impersonations of famous personalities. DO 99 21 Some of the visual tricks used in Enter the Gecko are astonishing in one scene Gex walks up the wall and across the ceiling, as the entire world rotates around him, to reach the far side of a cave. Everything, EVERYTHING, is impressive. Scenes are not on the same grand scale as in Mario 64 ie the vastness of the pyramid but the detail and atmosphere is superb.

As well as the 10 characters from the first arcade game and the extra 7 added for the Plus edition, SF EX Plus Alpha contains Dhalsim, Sakura, and the 4 secret fighters including Gamma, Beta and Evil Ryu!

There are some new monsters and surprises, including a zombified Forrest from Bravo team! The Director's Cut will be excellent for fans of the game, as well as those wanting some new challenges when playing the game through again. POCKET FIGHTER The first difference is that all of the cut-scenes which were removed from the Japanese version have been put back in the full-length intro shows the Alpha team being mauled by the dogs outside the house, the zombie eating Kenneth at the start knocks his half eaten head off, and so on. Because of this, it's going to get a fairly high age rating. But by far the most exciting thing FORMAT: ARCADE about Resident Evil: Director's Cut is that it comes in a two CD Capcom also unveiled a new Street Fighter package. The first CD contains arcade game at the E3! But before you get the game, while the second too excited, we'd better warn you not to contains...

Coooo0000000oool or what? Capcom have also added some new features to the game. Both the characters have new costumes, and some rooms CAPCOM ANNOUNCE MORE ARCADE CONVERSIONS! Capcom have announced that they will be using a new 4Mb RAM cartridge with future Saturn games. This is instead of the 2Mb cart used with Cyberbots and the current version of Marvel Superheroes and on top of the Saturn's 2.5Mb of internal memory. Games already officially announced for development on the Saturn in the next year are Street Fighter 3, Vampire Savior, X-Men vs Street Fighter, and Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter. X-Men vs Street Fighter is also now going to appear on the PlayStation, along with Megaman X4, Megaman Neo (a 3D Megaman adventure) and Resident Evil 2, which looked VERY impressive on the video shown at the E3. Unfortunately, there still wasn't a playable version. Booo. 29 "


"computer video games namco When it comes to arcade conversions, PlayStation owners automatically turn to Namco. Following Soul Blade and the Ridge Racer spin-offs, the E3 punters were baying for more. But they were left disappointed. PAC-MAN GHOST ZONE POINT BLANK SU Zone N ow that Time Crisis is available on import, Namco's attention has switched to their other arcade gun game, Point Blank. It's a far more tongue-incheek game to TC, but still possesses the same frantic gameplay. It's a one or two player game,and features not only a main game, but also a batch of two player games, similar to that of the training mode in Virtua  Cop. Details of this one were scarce, but it's due for a early '98 : release. We'll keep you posted. Watch out Mario, Pac-Man's still the godfather of videogames! 12 Even though it's a new engine the essence of Pac lives on... amco's most famous creation, the spherical yellow one returns, in a whole new adventure. This one player adventure borrows heavily from Mario 64, with a fully rotational 3D gaming world created for Pac to wander around in. There are a total of fourteen worlds including Mr Mans humble abode, a frozen waterfall and a haunted house. Pac still chomps on his pills they now give him the ability to throw fireball type projectiles but he has also learned a number of new tricks as he can now do a doggy paddle when swimming. Rather disappointingly this, along with most of their new stuff, was only available to see on a video. So we have no idea how it plays! Sorry. Considering Pac hasn't been in a decent game since Pac Land, retro gamers across the globe (well Microgoblin anyway) are hoping that Namco live up to their promises and don't make just another Mario clone. 00 PAC-MAN AND POINT BLANK FROM... Ma ...because the main aim is still to gobble up the pills!   TREASURES OF THE DEEP CCOVER STORY lonoa is still at the very early stages of developments, and E3 was the first time any sort of pictures were released. The pics seem to show that the game will be a cross between Mario and Pandemonium, but this is just speculation. Look out for updates early next year. Namco also had Time Crisis and Ace Combat 2 on show, but you can find out more about those elsewhere in the mag. 10.000 Looks typical, but never under estimate Namco for new ideas! reasures of the Deep is another gorgeous looking game (only a video was running) and could be a surprise title for Namco. You play as an ex-Navy Seal who goes on a worldwide treasure hunt around various sunken vessels. He isn't the only guy after these lost gems, and as a result has to fend off all the other deep sea robbers. The natural inhabitants of the waters will also have a say in your journey, particularly the sharks, as they don't take too kindly to humans in their territory. You also get the chance to pilot various  aquatic craft depending on the success of your raiding, with the Viper attack sub being your ultimate goal. This is due for a stateside  release in September, so expect some coverage next issue. 30 STORE 12 "

"computer games nsurprisingly, a lot of the PC games shown at the E3 were similar in many ways to Quake. The surprising thing is that they are all of an incredibly high standard, rather than the hundreds of inferior clones that usually appear after a game does as well as Quake has done. But even with all of these games, as well as many that we've already covered in previous issues of CVG, the most impressive PCrelated item at the show was the 3Dfx chipset. ..............................

The games using 3Dfx they just wanted were also the best-looking to stop things at the show, and anyone else convinced PC gamers that making a 3Dfx it's the next big thing to console for a spend their cash on. while. Who knows? on Storm, the company recently formed by the man-god responsible for designing Doom and Quake John Romero gave us our first look at their debut this E3. to s interactive ROM All the enemies are futuristic cyborgs after your head! The Daikatana itself is an ancient sword with the magic of time travel. Lost for hundreds of years at the top of a mountain, it is recovered in the year 2455AD by Dr Toshiro Ibihara. Before long, his assistant Dr Jarred Benedict kills him and takes the sword, using it to go back in time to the year 2030. He then steals the cure for AIDS which was created by one of Ibihara's distant relatives and pretends that it is his own. Using the fame and fortune gained from the cure, he creates an enormous fortress to protect the sword and stop his alternate future from being altered. You play as Hiro Miyamoto, Dr Toshiro Ibihara's star pupil in his quest to breach Benedict's fortress, get the Daikatana back, right history and save your teacher's life! DEVELOPED BY: ID SOFTWARE PUBLISHED BY: ACTIVISION One of the titles that the PC gaming world is looking forward to most was at the E3, and was one of the best things there. THE HOTTEST NEW PC GAMES! A fair number of levels were playable, though not completely finished. The enemies were in place and looked amazing, with movement as smooth and realistic as those in Turok. They didn't fight back properly, and the artificial intelligence which will make them duck and dodge to avoid shots wasn't totally in place. (COVER STORY We also got our first go with some of the new weapons, all of which fit in with the futuristic setting of the game. There's a standard handheld laser blaster, a larger pulse rifle similar to the one in Aliens, an Eraser-style rail gun complete with incredible vapour trails, a futuristic shotgun which was reloaded after each shot, and a two-speed gattling gun. The longer the fire button is held, the faster the barrel spins! The light coming from The new coloured lighting adds the weapon also changes colour as it to the atmosphere of the levels speeds up! Very tasty indeed. like no other game before. In ancient Greece you must fight off hordes of undead skeletons, just like in Jason and the Argonauts! Daikatana is going to be wikkid! In the game you are assisted by two other characters Mikiko, Dr Ibihara's daughter and Superfly Johnson, a cool-sounding character if there ever was one! Working with these characters is essential, and you even get to play as them after you've finished the game once. The graphics in the game are particularly amazing, with the 3Dfx cards used to the max. The new coloured lighting is the best we've seen in any game so far, with magnificent effects which make everything look amazing. Improved physics and movement as well as a great one-player game should make Quake 2 even better than the first game. Can you imagine that? Wow! The levels of the game are set in different time zones and countries, like ancient Greece and a futuristic San Francisco. Daikatana uses a customised version of the Quake 2 engine, with more than 30 different weapons and over 60 enemies. John Romero has yet to let us down with a 3D action game, and Daikatana sounds like it could be incredible! We'll be updating you on this as soon as possible. Oh yes. 32 "


"BLADE RUNNER UNREAL computer video games DEVELOPED BY: WESTWOOD PUBLISHED BY: VIRGIN DEVELOPED BY: EPIC MEGAGAMES PUBLISHED BY: GT INTERACTIVE The creators of Command & Conquer unveiled their latest game at the E3, based on the classic movie Blade Runner! A new playable version of Unreal was shown at the E3 and looked more impressive than before. CDO You play as one of the Blade Runners themselves, hunting down Replicants in the 3D futuristic Los Angeles. The way the game works means that you get to decide how you want to play you can even choose to join the Replicants in their mission to find the DNA information they need to live longer! When we did a Coming Soon feature on Unreal a few months ago, the version we played didn't run too smoothly, though it did have some fantastic special effects. The code shown at the E3 looked better, though it was clearly running on a very powerful machine. O There are over 130 computerised areas from Los Angeles 2019 in the game, and the events of the film itself go on around you as you play! The other characters have detailed artificial intelligence to make them act in a lifelike way, as well as motion capture to make them move realistically. It's due for release this Autumn on an enormous four CDs! If the game turns out to be half as good as the film, it'll be amazing! We got a better look at some of the weapons to be expected some futuristic, some ancient magical artifacts as well as some of the enemies in action. All of the character movement is brilliantly smooth, and the weapons are animated really well too. With all of its special effects generated by the software rather than graphics cards, Unreal is going to need a powerful PC to run properly. This is another corridor action game we're looking forward to it doesn't look as though Epic Mega Games are going to let us down.

An impressive version was demoed at the E3. Broderbund have also launched a new entertainment label named Red Orb to go with the release of Riven. The game itself follows on from the end of Myst and sees Atrus travelling the world of Riven attempting to free his wife. A much larger team is working on Riven than the one that worked on Myst, so : it should look really spectacular when : it's released later this year. THE HOTTEST NEW PC GAMES! There are four different character classes Warlock, Earthlord, ArchDemon and Inquisitor, each with different magic and special abilities. As you'd expect, up to four people can play Mage Slayer at once, either in cooperative mode or in a head-to-head battle. The story goes that two powerful meteors fell from the sky many generations ago. One of the meteors the SunOrb gave the Mage Slayers who studied it magic powers, while the other the StarStone was turned into five separate relics. In a later battle, the five relics were lost and it's now down to the leaders of the four remaining Mage Slayer clans to recover them. If Mage Slayer is half as good as Gauntlet, it'll be excellent. Here's hoping. You got a REALTH EAU32 As with most of the Quake style corridor games on the way, Prey looks fantastic. Using a unique game engine created especially for the game, it not only allows amazing 3D worlds with real-time shadows and lighting, but also a new portal system. 3D Realms' \"Portal Technology\" allows the designers to place portals anywhere in a level with an exit somewhere else, just like the teleporters we're used to. The unique part is : that it's possible to see through these portals, giving incredible scope for level design! For example, you'll be able to walk through a tiny door and end up in an enor: mous room or exterior section! We can't wait to see just what 3D Realms do with this technology in the final game! 33 "


"computer video games 2 KONAMI WA etal Gear Solid for PlayStation was the most talked about software of the event, and Paul spied a number of very famous Japanese software gurus visiting the stand (Kenji Eno from Warp was there!). Konami's line up was one of the strongest at E3, no question. These were the show stoppers. METAL GEAR SOLIA PLAYSTATION '98 And by 'Solid' Konami mean the first game to demonstrate the realism the solidity that 3D CG graphics can present. Seasoned gamesplayers may remember the original Metal Gear on the MSX (1987) a milestone title for 8-bit hardware. Konami are making it very clear that they intend Metal Gear Solid to become a milestone for PlayStation. That pain-in-the-ass ninja is around here somewhere... We'll skip story details one month to concentrate on the gameplay, and describe the action. The outward appearance is of a real flashy third-person shoot'em up. There are great-looking characters involved, created using an incredible 3D engine. 1 ...but I just can't see him. Wait a minute... something behind me! Like its predecessor, Metal Gear Solid blends strategy with action, and is being directed by Hideo Kojima (Policenauts, Snatcher). Kojima has researched the world of Metal Gear Solid with meticulous attention to detail. This has meant consulting US SWAT teams about their methods, spending time on the shooting range to observe how weapons are handled. However MGS is not a straight forward 3D shoot 'em up. The key to success is perfect ing espionage skills the art of destroying opponents without being detected by them or their associates. GAME OF THE SHOW GOES TO... 7 KONAMI. 255 The most spectacular sequence involves 'Ninja', a cyborg who cloaks himself Predator-style with invisibility. This effect looks impossible too good to be true! Most of the video demo is used to depict the stealth element, in which Solid Snake (a 'Space Seal') infiltrates a secret base with the intention of blowing it all to heck. Snake can slit throats, and drag the body into hiding, crawl along the floor on his belly; run around trashing an entire office using a machine gun to tear up furniture and shatter glass divisions. Snake can also set time bombs, which he does to initiate the grand finale of the demo: The entire enemy base goes up in flames, with camera angles used to show victims in corridors blasted through doors, and distant shots where terrorists are thrown into the air with flames toasting their ass! Your agent, Solid Snake, takes to refurbishing the office in style! 9959 Everything about Metal Gear Solid, from the intelligent and dramatic use of camera angles, to the apparent depth of thought required to survive the missions, promises to be monumental. We're pressing Konami for the very first UK playtest! Blow the enemy base and their agents are blasted sky high! This entire sequence is gobsmacking! NAGANO OLYMPICS 1 NBA BASKETBALL N64 and PLAYSTATION 1ST QTR 98 (COVER STORY (WORKING TITLE) -N64 N64 PLAYSTATION WINTER 97 rom the same team that brought you International Track And Field. Not surprisingly Konami are the official producers of the Winter Olympics game, to be held in Nagano Japan this year. The project has only recently begun, so all there is to see are rough demos of the skiing and speed skating sections both on N64. NIA BASKETBALL ning -N64 O N64 n extremely early demo of a fairly solid-looking B-Ball sim. Konami's NBA In The Zone gave Sony's Total NBA a tough challenge on PlayStation, so it's safe to assume that their first N64 attempt will set a high standard. What you can't tell from the stills is how slow this demo runs, though we expect this is deliberate to show off the clean texture-maps of player faces. Everybody in the NBA, except Michael Jordan, is included (but with the custom feature you could add him too!). "

With their mark already strongly stamped on the driving, fighting and shooting game markets, they're now making inroads into flying games. The original Ace Combat stormed onto PlayStation early in its life, back in Spring -95. An entertaining arcade flight simulator, it was marred by technical limitations. However, the PlayStation has grown stronger in the time since. So for Ace Combat 2, Namco have been far more ambitious, pushing their ideas for the ultimate console flying game home! However, don't just take our word for it. The Namco development team behind AC2 have been happy to talk to CVG about the project. Read on as they reveal all the hot development info!

NAMCO: When we first created Ace Combat we still hadn't mastered all of the PlayStation's programming techniques, so there was a feeling amongst the staff that, from a technical point of view, there were still things we wanted to do. From the beginning, Ace Combat has always been a great flying game that's been easy to play. However, this time we wanted to make the best use of both the visuals and the flying sensation. To do this required us to get 100% performance capacity from the PlayStation. This is how we came to produce AC2. 52 The spoils of working at Namco eh? Loads of ultra cool games and a huge plush building! CVG: At the start of the project, which aspects of AC2 did you plan to improve over the original? NAMCO: From the beginning, there were several technical areas we wanted to improve. Before we began the process of creating the missions, we did a lot of technical research such as finding out how many polygons we could display. In a flying game you have a 360 degree field of view, so to make everything look great we had to work as hard as possible to create a program that could display as many polygons as possible. We really wanted these high level graphics to stand out. With these awesome graphics it was possible to experience the wonderful sensation of flying. In order to make best use of this we thoroughly considered many things about the game contents including a wider variation of missions. In the first AC there were basically only two types: attack a ground target, or fight in the air. This time we wanted to include a lot more variety. TARGET VIEW 36 "


"FLIGHT SIM OR ARCADE BLASTER? computer Video games CVG: Although AC2 seems to be strictly an arcade experience, are there any aspects which you feel will really appeal to the flight-sim fan? NAMCO: As the flying isn't very complicated it obviously can't be compared to a proper flight simulator. However, when you consider the fighter plane and all the thrills and excitement that you can enjoy as you battle your way across the skies, it's much more fun than a flight simulator. RANPlayStation 54 The missiles won't lock on to anything until you are closer than 900 feet. STUTTAR Once a mission is complete you get a replay of your last kill. Cool! CVG: There are a lot of planes, various game options, and the wingmen to consider. How did you go about play testing all the missions to make sure they all offered different kinds of enjoyment? NAMCO: Actually, it's the other way round. From the very beginning we considered whether the missions we were creating were going to be fun and exciting. In this way, every time we created a new plane or developed the enemies actions we always thought about whether it was going to make the game more interesting or not. Therefore, when we actually playtested AC2 we were just checking to see whether the enjoyment was really just as we first imagined it would be. First of all we decided what we thought would be interesting and then we created it. This is the lock-on for all ground targets. Again, you must be close to get this. THE FLIGHTDYNAMICSI CVG: Did you receive any advice from real pilots about how the planes should handle or flying tactics etc? NAMCO: We really wanted to get some advice from a real pilot, but in the end we were unfortunately unable to do so. However, since we couldn't ask a real pilot we searched for lots of data, read a lot of books and studied a long time. CVG: How accurate is the statistical information for each jet? NAMCO: At one time we tentatively considered using real models of fighter planes but with only that kind of data the game would've become too difficult. In the end, we decided that the game should use a simple law of physics model. The statistics aren't fabricated. It's just that if you use the real facts to create the game the average person probably wouldn't be able play the game because it'd be too complex. For example, you'd keep stalling the plane. Because of this we decided to make these areas simpler. EXCLUSIVE namco / MARRIN LUTZ INTERVIEW! COMING SOON TARGET VIEW 9. B Mr Takumi Kudo is one of Ace Combat 2's graphics designers. Responsible for making the game's super-realistic look. These are the briefing screens that appear on all of the missions. They guide you through all the enemies you encounter and the final main target. CAUTION CVG: What kind of reference materials did you use to design the jets? NAMCO: We read books about the performance and abilities of planes. For modelling we gathered every possible piece of information possible. At the (American Armed Forces] air show we took a lot of photographs which we used later and we read a lot of aviation fan magazines and modelling magazines. We cut out and collected any number of plane pictures from these magazines to create the plane models. We also watched a lot of videos as well, especially air combat movies. CAUTION CVG: Did any of the team fly in a real fighter plane? NAMCO: If we'd had the chance, we'd have liked to fly in a real plane. However, in Japan ordinary people don't have the opportunity to fly fighter planes. I believe that in America and Europe that you can ride in the planes but in Japan the SDF (Self Defence Force) won't let people ride in their planes. However, even if you did ride in one you'd probably faint (laughs)! !  "

NAMCO: Compared to the original AC we've improved the Al considerably. All the Al routines were written by a specialist programmer for us, so Slash and Edge are now able to judge the situation and act accordingly. In the case where they are guarding a bomber, in AC they would simply fly off to attack any enemy plane that approached, but now they are a little more intelligent and consider the current situation first. In a combat situation, in AC the wingmen would only judge the situation to the extent of considering what would be the best way to get behind the enemy plane in order to fire a missile. However, in AC2 the wingmen now consider the roles they've been assigned at the same time as judging the combat situation. They think ahead and consider what the possible future state may be and apply the appropriate tactics in response.

NAMCO: Well, AC2 is a flying game so of course it has the \"Top Gun\" image, but that's just a fixed concept. Just to create something that's the same doesn't have any meaning, so we boldly distanced ourselves from that and created something original instead. Because you're flying a plane, the screen visuals are very breathtaking and cool-looking, so we really wanted to feature a guitar in the soundtrack to bring the music up to this level of coolness. PRESS STARTERTO VHS The new analogue controller is also compatible with AC2. They thought of everything! EXCLUSIVE namco / Maand SIGNING OFFI AIRCRAFT CVG: How do the missions influence the sound track? NAMCO: The music always reflects the atmosphere of the game. For example, the feeling of tension as you try to avoid the enemy radar, or the invigorating sensation of flying across the sky or over the sea, is all contained in the stimulating music. We created the soundtrack after looking at the missions. During the missions the atmosphere can quickly change. For example, in the beginning you're flying low over the ground, almost touching it. Then all of a sudden an enemy plane appears and so you soar into the sky and start dog. fighting. The music is there to emphasise the tension of this kind of atmosphere in the mission.  CVG: Is there anything else in the game you are proud of, or would like to highlight for the benefit of Ace Combat fans? Mr. Noboru Yamato: As a programmer, technically I think that I did everything that it was possible to do. I'll be happy if everyone enjoys playing AC2. Mr. Masanori Kato: There are various combat games out there, but there are very few games that are as enjoyable as AC2. I think it's a game you can play with a smile on your face, so please give it a go! Mr. Takumi Kudo: Visually I put an awful lot into creating this game. Flying through the sky is an exciting experience and the combat is cool. Even the option select screens are all far better than normal. I put a lot of effort in and the result is that everything is great. If you can enjoy this, then I'm pleased. Mr. Kota Takahashi: The BGM compliments the visuals perfectly. Every aspect of the sound track is cool. As far as it was possible to, we raised the standard of the music and sound to the highest level. A 6 Dilant . F-16 CVG: How did you create all the sound effects in Ace Combat 2? NAMCO: Most of the explosions and missile noises etc that are in the game are taken from a special-effects CD. However, as you'd expect we added to this and created new sounds as well. We didn't sample any of the sound effects from real sources. We just used our good sense and judgment. INTERVIEW! COMING SOON  A 10 CVG: Do you have a message for any of your English fans? Mr. Noboru Yamato: We've heard the comments of the Japanese players, but we don't know about abroad. We'd love to hear views on AC2 so please let us know. Mr. Masanori Kato: Compared to just a simple war game, a fighter plane battle is far more visually sensational. Please enjoy it. Mr. Takumi Kudo: Certainly, English games have a very cool image. We really tried hard to make sure that AC2 was up to that standard. Mr. Kota Takahashi: There's a great music mode for you to enjoy the sound tracks. Please listen to the guitar music. CHOCKS AWAY! Ace Combat 2 is already out in Japan and a UK release is guaranteed. We'll keep you informed on that event and any other top info we discover on AC2. N773/R9 AIRMAET TT. DICT Bin604 09825 39 "

How about commanding the entire fleet! STAR WARS REBELLION 0 W010 Sonax Coruscant ome could call it overkill, but then the Star Wars universe is so vast and rich LucasArts can't help finding new games to entertain us. Supremacy is a break from the norm. Less action thrills, more strategy. It's Command & Conquer in that galaxy far, far away. Though comparisons to Westwoods classic are far, far from the truth. Instead Supremacy has closer ties to Master of Orion 2. Set just after the conclusion of A New Hope, the Alliance has dealt a blow to the Empire by destroying the Death Star. Now is the time to develop diplomatic ties, to spread and hide the fleet. Of course, the Empire are in hot pursuit. Fashy awa 992 THE STAR WARS SAGA CONTINUES IT IS A PERIOD OF CIVIL WAR IT'S A TRAP! To begin a game, you must first choose your side. The mighty Galactic Empire or the puny Rebel Alliance. The game is battled out over a galaxy of up to 200 planets (or sectors and systems). From your command centre you must make all decisions. Manufacturing, resource management, fleet deployment, mission assignments and exploration will keep you constantly occupied. Luckily you are aided in updates of all events by a trusty droid. C-3PO informs Rebels, while IMP-22 is at the Empire's service. All resources are placed in a pool. Loyal planets are able to train troops, build ships and buildings. These can then be transported to anywhere in the galaxy. If the Empire gathers enough resources they'll even be able to build a new Death Star. Supremacy is a real-time strategy game, not turn-based as most games of this ilk so often are. Game events are in constant motion. When two opposing fleets meet over the same system, you are instantly whisked away to view the action. Using a 3D engine to view the battle, you join the ships which have already been deployed. Take command of the fighter squadrons and assign orders or targets. The tactical mode can be placed on auto-run so you can only concentrate on the strategic side of things. Grand battles can last as long as 20 minutes. Though all battles are space based and not fought on land. ODD TOP TRUMPS CO NOOS NINO Your overall objectives to winning depend on which side you're playing as. There are 55 characters from the Star Wars universe, 28 from the Rebel Alliance and 27 from the Empire. Included in this number are four very important characters. For the Empire, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, while Mon Mothma and Luke Skywalker are the Rebel's key players. Capture of these characters is a factor of winning the game. The final objective is to destroy the Rebel base, or seize the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. If a character is captured, there is still hope to mount a rescue mission. The key to victory is assigning a character whose attributes match the mission, thus the chances of a successful mission are enhanced. The element of danger is when on diplomatic missions, as the perfect character to send is Mon Mothma. Her capture would deal a blow to the Rebel's cause. Plus if Han Solo is captured, you can be sure Luke will want to launch a rescue mission straight away. CARAVAN OF COURAGE 50 Supremacy is going to be brilliant. LucasArts are also claiming that this is ideal for strategy game beginners. Who are we to argue with them? They've hardly put a foot wrong. Expect all your Admiral Ackbar dreams to come true this Autumn. 40 "

Resident Evil hungry scratchy Saturn. Hungrywate man-awesome conversion flaking\"peeling-arm fell off. Be afraid they're coming RESIDENT EVIL. he gulf between the Saturn and PlayStation conversions is obviously narrowing. And Resident Evil is the perfect example of this. It was the game that had PS owners laughing and pointing, with cries of I'd like to see the Saturn do this' flying all around the room. Having now had the benefit of seeing both titles, we can comfortably report that Sega owners have a gem of a title on their hands. And if you were having second thoughts on Sega's box of tricks, KEEP IT! Res Evil coupled with some of the other titles on the way (Quake, Panzer RPG and Marvel) make the Saturn a musthave machine at the moment! NEW MONSTERS? NOT QUITE... SURVIVAL HORROR GOES THE DISTANCE ON SATURN! SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT? After all the talk about new monsters, the truth is that...well there aren't any. Just tweaks on the old monsters. At the end of the game you get to fight against two Tyrants if you're playing with Chris, and when you reach the underground sewer section the Tyrants have a slightly different look to them. In the Battle mode the Tyrant you fight is gold coloured (and ROCK hard) and you also get to fight against Wesker as well. Other than that... Without wanting to give away too much of the game at this stage, we still thought it would be worth telling you about the extra bits and bobs that have been added. It may not seem much on the face of things, but when you actually play them... Aim your shotgun high, and take off a zombies head! AMAZING BATTLE MODE! The biggest new addition has to be the against-the-clock battle mode. Basically you are thrust into fifteen different rooms from around the house, each containing various enemies inside them, and you have to dispose of the flesh hungry mutants as quick as possible. At the end of it, you're given a time, score and a rank thus giving the chance to continually try to better your best times. The all new, slightly redesigned Hunter! Cool. MaxoS NUOS PNINO WHAT ABOUT THE UNIFORMS? They're new! Once you've found the Special Key and made your way to the closet, you'll find you have access to each characters secret uniforms. We won't reveal them to you, simply Wesker becomes one of because they are a nice surprise when you do get them. The the undead in the battle rocket launcher with infinite bullets is also in there for all those mode! Pop his ass full of lead! blood-thirsty hounds who like their gore fast and furious. Cool HE'S BEEN PECKED TO DEATH BY CROWS! All the indications are pointing towards this being a perfect conversion of the PlayStation smash. Being as we now have a finished version, you'll have the full update next month. 42 The closet where you get your new costumes. In the normal game, these crows won't attack. "

A N64 game that's not 3D! When you find out who the game's by, you'll realise that this 2D platform adventure is in very safe hands! is in very safe hands! sa plattorna aventure esponsible for some of the greatest Mega Drive games ever seen, Treasure have slowly but surely built a reliable reputation. They brought sprite scaling, and rotation to the console for the classic Gunstar Heroes, and refined their skills through Dynamite Headdy and Alien Soldier. Their last classic was the incredible Guardian Heroes for the Saturn. Quiet for almost two years they have re-emerged, going back to their roots. Not Gunstar Heroes era, but further back. When Treasure were still a bunch of coders working for Konami, making the classic Probotector for the Super NES. Once again working on a Nintendo console, what kind of Treasure can we expect to find this time? GO GIA TROUBLEMAKERS 2D PLATFORM GAME GENIUS IN 64-BIT GLORY QUEEN OF THE ROCKET MEN Set on the planet of Nendoro, Troublemakers is the adventure of Marina Liteyears, a bodyguard and maid. Her resourceful master. Professor Gumbel, has been kidnapped by inhabitants of the planet. As Marina you must search for your beloved master through the colourful levels. Unlike most other platform games where you jump on creatures to dispose of them, Marina must grab opponents and shake or throw them. Shaking sometimes produces power crystals or weapons. Marina also has the ability to fly short distances with the aid of rocket boosters on her body. This is necessary for some of the more deviously designed levels. O WOEDIAET I PLANET, WELLIN The game consists of five worlds, each broken down into ten levels and containing all the Treasure trademarks of diversity and large bosses. The first few levels of World One even acts as a tutorial. Here only friendly creatures are encountered who offer tips and playing advice. manath 1 Advice can be bought on most stages in the game, by trading ten red stars with any pink faces (with hair bow) you encounter. Useful because these tipsters often appear when you encounter a section that is unlike any you've visited before. 4.4 To finish a level, Marina must locate a star to warp to the next location. Later levels have multiple stars. Only one is the real warp! "


"computer video games THE CRYSTAL MAZE NINTENDO BASAN ES There are four different colours of crystal littered around each stage. Red, the most common, are the building blocks of your lives. Every time your energy bar reaches zero, red crystals are used to continue the game. Ten crystals puts you back in the action with a full bar of energy, 30 reddies and you receive two full energy bars. Or if you're feeling really rich, hand over 100 red fellas for three full energy bars. Blue crystals add a small amount to your energy bar, while the less common Green crystal restores health back to maximum. Also on each level is a hidden Yellow crystal, collect these on every stage to receive a special surprise! A TREASURE TRAIL Though Troublemakers is short on few real surprises, it does contain a few clever features. The majority of levels may look similar, but nearly all contain something new to do. All the levels involve the simple task of finding a star to warp to the next stage. Some stars are only revealed by solving puzzles, such as rescuing lost Nendoros. Not all levels follow the same structure, certain sections involve using different types of transport. Most scroll horizontally, but there are levels where Marina needs to climb. Marina also takes a rest on two levels, and you instead take control of a Nendoro called Chappy. At the end of World Three there's even a Track-and-Field style tournament to compete in! The lava boss is getting pretty angry. That's because we've disposed of one of his minions, who protects this mighty monster. Better watch out, he's drawing energy and is about to spit flames! 2D PLATFORM GAME GENIUS IN 64-BIT GLORY  BADD CBR 1-3 15 1-? 1-9 1-2 1-4 1-8 1-8 1-10   »    Like NIGHTS, Troublemakers features a grade system for each completed level. All A grades should reveal new surprises. COMING SOON TO O GOING, GOING GONE! Go, Go!! Troublemakers is dead! Long live Mischief Makers! For this is the title the game will go by in the US and UK when it arrives later in the year. Due to the large amount of Japanese text, the game is quite hard to understand, though has recieved rave reviews in Japan. Expect an English language version to reveal hidden delights. A jar allows Marina to mix objects to make powerful weapons. Flowers, placed inside and shaken, make a throwing star. Crystals can also be upgraded. Experiment with recipes. 45 "

Kidnapping plots, crime syndicates, ancient Mayan curses, dwarfs with blowpipes, mysterious idols, Welsh drug dealers and the imminent destruction of all life on our planet! Broken Sword II. BROKENSWORDT DOGODIDO SMOKING MIRROR AROUND THE WORLD IN 80+ SCREENS GET OUTOFTHAT! BROKEN SWORDI THE SMUKINS MIRROR If Broken Sword Il were a Thovie it would have to have a hell of a big travel budget. From Paris, a lead to an export agency takes George off to the docks at Marseilles, where he finds Nico tied up in a warehouse. The pair decide to follow Professor Oubier to Quaramonte in South America, where they run into an Indian shaman, who reveals the true purpose of their quest to recover three stones that will prevent the evil god Tezcatlipoca front deing released from his magical prison after an imminent solar eclipse. With a new sense of purpose, George and Nico split up, George heading for a Caribbean island which was once home to a loot-crazed privateer, and Nico jetting back to London, where one of the stones resides in the British Museum. Thank goodness our heroes are immune to jet-lag! MINA REVOU TUN! PHEW THIS ISSUE OF CVG JUST KNOCKED ME OFF MY FEET! Wow! Revolution Software have been in the adventure business for several years now their first hit was the acclaimed sci-fi caper, Beneath A Steel Sky. Over the years they've been refining the technical side of their games. The most striking advance in Broken Sword Il are the extremely impressive graphics. All scenery is intricately detailed and even has parallax-scrolling features, and the character animation is enhanced by clever effects such as shadowing, light effects, alpha-blending and geometric sprite transformation, both of which prevent the sprites from becoming chunky or indistinct as the characters move in and out of the screen. It's as good as any cartoon, and that's a fact! NOOS ININOJ The story starts with George accompanying his girlfriend Nico to the Parisian townhouse of esteemed archaeologist Professor Oubier. They're met by a muscley South American, who shows them upstairs, then coshes George over the nut! Suddenly, Nico gets a poisoned dart in the neck and collapses to the floor! When George wakes he's tied to a chair in a burning room with Nico nowhere to be seen and a massive spider about to climb up his trouser leg. How to escape a fiery death, and the spider, and clear the poison, is just the start of your problems! Click on the subject icon at the bottom of the screen to talk. When George and Nico split up, the action cuts between the two characters. It's Karzac, the Welsh drug dealer! And he's got Nico! A classic 'Divert The Guards' puzzle in operation. BROKENSWORD-ONSHEATHED! PART 2 OF PART 2 COMING SOON What with Broken Sword Il and LucasArts' imminent Curse of Monkey Island, adventure fans have a lot to look forward to this summer. Since this is becoming such a popular trend (and we thought point-and-click was on the way out!) we're hot on the case trying to find out any more that are planned. All things considered this sequel is expected to offer far more depth and longevity than the original. Only way to be sure is to lock Alex in a room for a whole month. Results next issue. "

"computer video games CHECKPOINT If you like lists, pictures of really ugly people and competitions that have a vague reference to a big game of the month, then Checkpoint must be your wildest dream come true! The month's events and software releases at a glance. Aug-Sept FCTS t's the first hot day we've had in weeks. There are shorts and shades all over the place, parks are full, sun worshippers have emerged from the hibernation and begun bathing again and guess where we are? Stuck indoors, staring at screens all day, watching others sitting in pubs having a great time. So, with that in mind, you had better like this month's Checkpoint. The release list is one of the most up-to-date we've printed, the pictures are some of the most bizarre and gruesome (have you seen Ed's sister??!!!) and the games we're giving away are awesome. So stop reading this unimportant bit, and skip to the nitty gritty. What are you waiting for? September. Earls Court, London. This is the British equivalent of E3, yet without every games company in the world and half the glamour. Still it gives the British journos like us a chance to go and drink lots of free beer and look at games we've seen before. Expect newer versions of Sonic R, Quake and Duke on Saturn and maybe Res Evil 2 and Tomb Raider 2 for PlayStation! Sounds like good fun to us! Sonic powers back into ECTS! Cool! WINI WIN! WIN! WINNERI * F1 '97 EVENTS AND SOFTWARE RELEASES F1 was brilliant. But it was bugged up to the eyeballs. To counter this Psygnosis have smoothed all of those irritating little glitches and added loads of other stuff too. You want split-screen two player mode? You got it! You want a real over-the-top Virtua Racing style arcade mode? You got it! You want to win this game? You got it! All you have to do is this. Murray Walker returns to this version, along with newcomer Martin Brundle. We all know that Murray is as bald as a coot. You have to draw one (or all preferably) of the CVG team members with no hair. Slapheads, shiners, a Willie Thorne. Call it what you like. The funniest and most lifelike will win. And don't just limit yourself to us being bald. Any form of defacing will be accepted. Mark your entries to: CVG HAVE MORE SPAM THAN TESCO'S COMP. EVENTS AND LAST BRONX Blimey, this is what our regular readers look like. Sick bag anyone? SHINING THE HOLY ARK You may or may not know this, but a bronx cheer is another name for a fart. That the reference to Last Bronx and this competition. Sega's new fighting game proves beyond doubt that that they are the masters of this particular field, so we want to give you the chance to win a copy of the home version. All you have to do is draw us (your pens and pencils are being kept busy this month) one of the characters from Last Bronx doing a move in which a 'bronx cheer' is incorporated. You have to sketch one of them doing a fart fireball. Or something similar to that. Send your entries to: EGGS, SHOULDERS KNEES AND TOES COMPO. All we wanted you to do, was draw what you think we'd take on an Ark with us. Nothing complicated about that. So why on earth did you think that we'd want to take dirty mags with photos of Maggie Thatcher in them??? Bizarre. So we plumped for the most imaginative, creative and awesome drawing out of the lot. Well done Jack Doherty or Co. Durham for the picture you see here. DUNGEON KEEPER You lot certainly have some really ugly mates. Pig ugly. We had such a laugh seeing the various monsters you choose to call relatives or mates that we almost wet ourselves when each days post arrived. But there were two notable entries. Just failing to win a prize was the picture sent in by C.Coleman of Ed's better looking sister. But the undisputed winner was Adam Tomlinson who sent in this pot bellied picture. TF1 Friday will be on the phone for the Ugly Bloke audition in a matter of days. WINNER! CHECKPOINT * DARK REIGN What happened to our summer?

"computer video James THE FIFTH ELEMENTO ayStation TM ayStation Theme The most intense special effects film EVER is being made into a video game! CVG spoke to designer Patrice Garcia, and developers Kalisto to find out the details so far. ROM  Gaumont WMS TO SAVE THE WORLD very five thousand years the universe needs a hero, and in New York City of the 23rd Century, a good hero is hard to find.\" Every once in a while something comes along which gives our Editor, Paul, a new reason to live. Sometimes it's a game, sometimes music. Sometimes a crazy gizmo like Tamagotchi. This month it's a film Luc Besson's new-born space action epic, The Fifth Element. Film critics refer to it as the freshest science-fiction vision in 15 years. Paul says it's just a really cool film with loads of artillery action and beautiful women in it. So, you can imagine how his ears pricked up when he heard there was a game of the film on the way for PlayStation and PC! Ace CVG agent Paul Glancey was immediately hired to shed a little light'... Coding has only recently begun on The Fifth Element game. As you can see from the screenshots, it adopts the 3D exploration and fighting routine. The idea is to recover the four stones representing the four earthly elements, and get them back to the temple on Earth where they can be reunited with the fifth element in time to repel the ultimate evil. In the process, you have to explore 15 different 3D levels, fighting it out with Mangalore mercenaries; Zorg's lackeys; New York cops, and all kinds of other futuristic monsters while looking for secret passages, door switches, and your current mission objective. ELEMENT DEVELOPMENT LEELOO DALLAS MULTIPASS Games-of-the-film have often been an afterthought on Part of The Fifth Element game the part of a film's marketing team. Not so with The involves strategy. Leeloo or Korben Fifth Element. As soon as production started, the film's must fight hard AND think fast. producers at Gaumont in Paris realised that the story and the action sequences were perfectly suited to use in a video game. Rather than selling the game license, Gaumont set up their own software studio in June of 1995, Gaumont Multimedia, then started looking for a developer that had the experience required to turn the film into a game. They found Kalisto another French team and work began on the game at the start of this year. Gaumont gave Kalisto access to the script and all of the film's production artwork, and even sent the design team over to America to meet the film's special effects technicians at Digital Domain. When Kalisto returned they worked out a game design, then submitted it to Gaumont and Luc Besson for approval. Both liked the idea enough to give the go ahead. Game-of-the-film history was begun. In the film both Leeloo and Dallas get almost equal shares of the action, and this will be reflected in the game. Some levels are played as one of the two characters, while others let you pick your favourite. Your choice of character affects the action, though. If you're playing as Dallas you get plenty of powerful firearms to defend yourself with, whereas Leeloo gets a selection of weapons, plus she can use her martial arts skills. CMF  NYPU Leeloo wastes no time using measured violence to get what she wants. However she requires the military know-how of Korben Dallas to help her out. This partnership will also feature in the game, where players will use both to their advantage. 52 "


"SOOOOO computer video games PlayStatio O0000000OOOOOO O00000OOOOO TIME IS NOT IMPORTANT ROM ORIGINATING THE FIFTH ELEMENT Production on The Fifth Element began five years ago, but the concept is over 20 years old, beginning when Luc Besson was 15. At that time he was kicking his heels in boarding school. Fed up with his situation he decided to dream his way out of it. Luc set to work writing a fantastic story set in the future, in which a force of pure evil enters our universe, and can only be stopped by an ancient weapon constructed of the four earthly elements, earth, fire, water and air, and a fifth, alien element. Once finished, he had a massive 400page script! Not knowing what to do with it at the time, he put it away in a safe place. By the time Luc Besson picked up the script again it was 1992 and he had attained a reputation as one of Europe's star film-makers. Re-reading the script, he decided it would make an excellent action film. With the help of his friend Robert Mark Kamen, Luc trimmed the story to a more workable 150 pages, then assembled a crew of conceptual artists to realise his vision. The team would be led by two acclaimed French comic artists, Jean Giraud, who had become world-famous for his work as 'Moebius', and Jean-Claude Meziere, the creator of Valerian, Spatio-Temporal Agent. After taking a break to shoot another film, the stylish action flick, Leon, Luc returned to The Fifth Element to pull the ideas together and get production fully underway. Three years and  million ($90m) later, the film was finished. When it opened the prestigious 1997 Cannes Film Festival its breath-taking visuals left the audience of filmland glitterati stunned. In the USA it went to number one on its first weekend, and in the short time since its release The Fifth Element has earned over  million in US box office receipts. With films like Batman and Robin and The Lost World occupying screenspace at your local multiplex, The Fifth Element will have a lot of competition this summer. But of the three films it's the only one that comes close to deserving the description of 'classic'. HILETE M TEME THEY MAKE THEM...PERFECT One of the powers The Fifth Element has over other science fiction films is the spectacular sights the film offers. From the miles-high structures of 23rd Century New York, to the space-going hotel, The Fhloston Paradise, its appeal is magnetic all the way. While the concepts were originated in Europe, the actual effects were produced in the USA, at James Cameron's own effects house, Digital Domain. Headed by oscar nominated director Mark Stetson you'll have seen their work with models and computer-generated effects in Apollo 13, True Lies and many other blockbuster films. But even they had to push the boat out for The Fifth Element. In one shot of New York Digital Domain beat their own record, composing 82 separate SFX 'elements into making just one shot. FEATURE "


"computer video games KA 'layStation THE DIRECTOR'S CUT ROM Most of the levels are adapted from the film, so you get to explore locations such as the temple and the Fhloston Paradise ship. Kalisto have also been allowed to use two other locations which were edited out of the film for time and budget reasons. One is a police station, the other is a New York sewer, which houses a whole community of social outcasts and blood-thirsty mutants! Also, Gaumont have hinted that one of the game's digitised cutscenes may include a surprise ending, which was 7 shot for the film but never used in the final print. THE 3D ELEMENT Comparisons between The Fifth Element game and Tomb Raider are inevitable. However the skills required are completely different. At the heart of The Fifth Element game is Kalisto's own 3D engine, which they have also used in Nightmare Creatures, a PlayStation title due for release by Sony later this year. In Nightmare Creatures you have to explore graveyards and other sinister locales armed with a big stick, a pair of pistols and a bunch of magic weapons. Nightmare Creatures looks impressive, but by the time The Fifth Element appears, you can expect that engine to have been refined quite a way. Kalisto are working on a lot of new effects for The Fifth Element game, and will be using texture maps taken from the computer models produced by Digital Domain for the film. To make sure the PC version gets the full benefit, like so many other developers Kalisto will be including support for Power VR, and possibly other 3D hardware. Don't remember this from the film? That's because this is one of the areas originally planned to feature, but didn't make it. LEELO VS LARA One thing we are very keen to discover is how Leeloo measures up to Lara Croft soon to return for Tomb Raider 11 in the female-game-hero stakes. Leeloo may not have Lara's measurements, but she swaggers better and handles herself with more style in a fight. Kalisto are quick to deny any similarities between The Fifth Element and a certain game in which tombs are raided, but looking at these pictures... well, see what you think. Though Gaumont have not specified, we assume this is the Sewer. This was also planned, but in the end omitted from the film. GILEE o o O WHAT...YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM?! O O O Shame on you! Okay, just so's you know what we're talking about, here's a brief summary of The Fifth Element's plot. Every 5000 years a planetary conjunction opens a black hole in space, allowing a force of ultimate evil to enter our dimension so that it can destroy all life on Earth. The only thing that has saved us until now is a weapon constructed by an alien race, the Mondoshawan. And this weapon can only be activated by stones embodying the four ele ments, earth, fire, water, air. Plus one other, vital ingredient the mysterious Fifth Element. The vear is 2258, and evil is on its way. Fortunately, so are the Mondoshawan, carrying the five elements required to destroy the invader. But before they can reach Earth their ship is attacked and destroyed by a gang of Mangalore mercenaries. The mercenaries are in the pay of one Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg, an Earth-based arms dealer who is in league with the evil force, 'Mr Shadow', and has to retrieve the elements before it arrives! With the Mondoshawans gone all seems lost, but a survivor is found in the wreckage of their ship a single living cell that had been part of one of its crew. The cell is returned to New York and cloned into a beautiful humanoid alien female, (named Leeloo), who promptly escapes and ends up jumping off a ledge, miles above the ground. and into the back seat of a cab. At the wheel of the cab is Korben Dallas, who suddenly finds himself with this fugitive in his cab, 54 "

Eventually he evades the police and takes Leeloo to a priest, whose name she has been burbling. The priest is the head of an ancient order inaugurated by the Mondoshawan to be their representa tives on Earth. He recognises the girl as the supreme being, but wonders how she can save the Earth now that the stones are lost. But it turns out the stones were never on the Mondoshawan ship, and Leeloo was to recover them from a Mondoshawan agent on the luxury pleasure planet, Fhloston Paradise. Word spreads and soon everyone is heading for Fhloston Paradise to find the stones: Zorg. who was outraged to discover the case the Mangalores recovered was empty; the Mangalores, who were outraged that Zorg didn't pay them and who now want the stones for themselves; Dallas, who has been engaged by the military so that he can ensure the stones' recovery: Leeloo, who ends up accompanying Dallas, and the VEFATURA O So, who gets the stones? And who gets blasted to bits? And what exactly is the Fifth Element? For the answers to those questions, get down to your local cinema and buy a ticket. 55 "

Starfox 64 is about to rock a cartridge slot near you! STADROWOT he N64 is beginning to pick up steam. The slow start worried many people, and the lack of releases is still a cause for concern. But with every passing month, those who plumped for the 64 are beginning to think they made the right decision. Mario Kart stormed the charts, beating a number of other big titles, including ISS Pro. Starfox represents the next triple A title for the machine, and if sales in the USA and Japan are anything to go by, it's gonna be huge! Even the rumble pack is sound investment, with over ten games reportedly in development to run in conjunction with the add-on. If you hadn't already gathered by now, we love Starfox. And we want you lot to love it too. If the next four pages don't convince you to buy it, nothing will. *** HONOURS EVEN? * * * The key to getting the most out of Starfox is obtaining the medals for each stage. These prizes are only awarded once you've notched up a certain score for a particular level, but let us say now that this is INCREDIBLY tough! Here are a few pointers you may need to remember. Oh, and unless all of your wingmen are alive, all of your hard work is pointless. TIP 1: USE THE HOMING LASER! 000 000 099 lauls The biggest thing you have to remember is that the homing weapon you have can gather the most hit points. If you kill a group of enemies with this bomb, a little message appears on screen along the lines of 'Hits +2' for instance. This means that as well as the normal point you get for downing each individual fighter, you also get 2 extra hit points. Do this enough times during a level and you may even double your score. 119 8 TIP Z: LAUNCH THOSE MEGABOMBS! 8 050 000 Don't be afraid to launch a megabomb into a group of enemies as well, because you can often gain 30 or 40 hits in crowded areas. A good time to do this would be at the beginning of Area 6, where there's a huge clut tered minefield. Big rewards can be reaped from this section if you time the bomb's detonation right. Meteo is another level in which this works well, just as you reach to big portals where twenty or so ships appear on both sides. Il32 WW3 8 TIP 3: CERTAIN ENEMIES GIVE MORE POINTS * REVIEW 035 00 You have to remember that different enemies can give, more or less reward points. The Red Mechs on the first stage (Corneria) for instance robots that knock over the pillars will give you 'Hits +5' every time you blow one up. There are two or three of them that are tucked away behind pillars who need to be killed in order to reach the desired 150 kills. Usually, the bosses will give a *Hits +10' bonus so don't worry about not having enough. 56 "

This warp is most handy for those trying for medals on Sector Z, as it lets you warp from Sectors X to Z without gaining Cat on the way. This then lets you take out all of the missiles and get the 'Kills +10' bonus for each of them. INTENDO 64 083 000 092 OU At the split make sure you take the left hand side otherwise you miss the warp completely. Try and kill all of the three enemies by the path junction to get a laser power up. As you approach the first gate, wait for the debris to move before hitting the brakes. Now unload with as many bullets as possible to flip the gate up as shown in the shot. You need to use the brakes on every gate, and you have to flip them up to get the warp. Once the door turns red, it's almost open, so keep shooting and you're there! Once completed, you warp to a similar gassy area as the first. Except this time there is a lot more to get in your way. Surviving is the tough part, but it's well worth it! ALL TRAINS WILL BE DIVERTED... boni  THE MISSILES ARE COMING!

Control of the Landmaster is once again thrust into your hands, as you play through the level alongside a huge freight train. There are a couple of ways to finish this level, with what we are about to detail being the proper ending. The alternative is to simply kill the boss as standard, but you never get the medal this way. As you approach the guardian you can see small signposts with numbers on them. Every time you shoot one, they swivel around and a green light appears to indicate they have been switched. Shoot all eight and the small signal box at the end of the track will open, revealing a switch to change the points. Shoot this and the tracks will change, diverting the train into the building and earning you an extra fifty point hit bonus. xodus he OOG 3!10  1 This is where the game is up.

Although com pleting this level is simple, getting the medal isn't. The object for the level is simple, you have to stop the missiles from hitting the Greatfox.

"computer VICEO games SLIPPY LITTLE DEVIL! NINTENDO 090 00 CD Sector X also sees a pretty major plot change, providing you meet the tasks set. Obviously you can take the warp, but should you ignore that and reach the boss, your speed becomes important. You think you've killed the boss once, only to see it come back alive. It's here that the speed comes in handy. If you don't finish the boss off quick enough, Slippy races forward in an attempt to grab his own little piece of glory. Unfortunately the boss is having none of it and whacks our amphibian friend down to the Titania. Save him and you move up to Macbeth and the chance to finish the game on the harder setting. Fail, and you have to go and rescue him! 085 ANN 193000 193 000 x G 09 O NG HT+4 STARFOX ON-LINE! Just a little note to let you all know that an American website dedicated, solely to Fox McCloud and Co. has cropped up on the net. The address, is a simple one, STARFOXA http://www.starfox64.com but the page is crammed full of everything you could wish to know. Character profiles, official guides and the chance to become the greatest Star fox pilot are all here. It's well worth checking out! REVIEWER Fail to save Slippy and you head to the sparse wastes of Titania. Because of the hills and sand dunes in this stage, you really need to use the burners to see what's coming. Keep the homing laser charged to shoot any surprise enemies. 013 do I'd buy an N64 for this game. It's as simple as that. Everything that epitomises Nintendo the playability, the depth and the incredibly well thought out nature of the games, return once you boot up Starfox. You cannot deny that this is simply awesome to play. It takes no time to get into and loads of time to finish. And it's this reason that the game reaches the dizzy heights of a CVG High Five! The pleasure you get from finding out all the little secrets, how and when to shoot enemies to give yourself the biggest score and whipping three of your mates in the multiplayer mode...classic gameplay. The Rumble Pack proves that something like that can work, and while it may be a little on the bulky side, it still adds a hell of a lot to the atmosphere. I have finished Starfox lots of times, but keep coming back for more and that, in my books, makes this a great game. YOU SHAKE IT ALL ABOUT! Something that is very rarely written about Starfox is the fact that it has an inside and outside view. The outside option is by far the better of the two, as not only can you see everything going on around you, but also if enemy craft sneak up behind. Inside, aiming and more pinpoint shots are the benefits but you often lose a sense of direction like this. REVIEW IN OUT STEVE tieg S HUGHEIVE) cott RATING This is the second 'must have' game for the N64 after Mario. Superb visuals coupled with absorbing gameplay make this a winner. Buy it! 59 "

Which is nice. LITTLE BIG ADVENTURE 2: TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY he world of Twinsun is in peril again, and what started off as a simple trip to the shops has turned into a nightmare mission for the heroic Twinsen. It all starts when Twinsen's pet dinofly is hit by lightning during a freak storm and crash lands in his garden. When his wife, Zoe, discovers the ailing beast she sends Twinsen off to find a healer before the cuddly dragonling croaks. Little does she suspect that he's going to end up travelling all over the planet, learning wizardry, going stuntdriving and fighting an assortment of local monsters, as well as a contingent of recently-landed aliens then stowing away aboard their flying saucer and taking the fight back to their planet! All in all, it seems fair to assume that he won't be home in time for tea. Looks like it could be somewhere like Greece. But actually it's in a place called Twinsun. And you're called Twinsen. Catchy name, eh? An ingenious adventure it may be, but there's still room for the trusty minecart section. Well, you can't beat the old favourites. TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY UIDE LITTLE BIG ADVENTURE 2: TWINSEN'S SPACE INVADERS Finding the cure for the dinofly is only the start of Twinsen's Odyssey. Once he's cleared away the storm that brought down the dinofly, a mysterious yellow spaceship lands in the centre of town and unloads a horde of grim-faced aliens. They say they've come in peace, but Twinsen gets the distinct feeling that they're keeping him under surveillance for some reason. His suspicions are further raised when he discovers that all the planet's wizards are disappearing, apparently lured away by the promise of an alien information exchange programme. If only he could get aboard that spaceship... LOOKING FOR TROUBLE REVIEW can can At first glance LBA2 looks just like LBA1, with the same isometric, 'onhigh' viewpoint and a similar-looking 3D environment, but when you step outside Twinsen's house you'll see a big difference. In the external locations the camera' shifts about to give the best view of Twinsen and his surroundings, and when he moves out of camera range, the screen changes to show a new view. If Twinsen has to go behind an object or you can't see exactly what you're doing, a keypress switches the view to another camera, in another corner of the location. 62 "


"computer video games ENGAGE STEALTH MOOD! EMT... Hommig. see y To knock you out! Tho umbrella please Give me my tunic back! LBA2 sees the return of the unusual \"Mood' control system that appeared in the first LBA quest. Instead of having different controls for fighting, talking, searching and so on, you just get one action button, and what Twinsen does when you press that button is affected by the mood he's in. Set him off in 'Normal and he simply walks about, talking to characters and examining objects. In 'Sporty' mood he runs everywhere and leaps when you press the action key. When he's being Discreet' he tip-toes about, unnoticed by any nearby baddies. And when he's being \"Aggressive' he stomps about punching, and kicking anything that gets in his way. ROM t ol D Why Twinson Bo pouco collow You just found umbrella the customer's Discreet 1 Here Twinsen has to recover a stolen brolly from a thief... 1 He can try running after him, but the thief is too fast.... 1 If he tries a more discreet approach he can take him by surprise! FLY-DRIVE TRIPS POS BALLS OF FIRE The action in LBA2 takes place on the numerous islands of Twinsun, and if the mission requires him to travel to another island Twinsen usually has to buy a ticket and take the ferry. Once Dinofly is back to his usual self, though, Twinsen can save money by getting on the grateful reptile's back and flying to all kinds of far-flung destinations. Twinsen can also speed up his quest by repairing his cool little buggy and having it shipped out to him, so he can motor around the landscape and reach areas unattainable on foot. As well as the punch-and-kick Power-of-Strop abilities afforded him by Aggressive mood, Twinsen has other means of defending himself. He still has the magic ball he found in his first adventure, and he can usually put most minor foes out of action by bopping them on the head with it a couple of times. The ball is even more effective if Twinsen is packing some magic power, and later in the game a friendly wizard upgrades him to 'Green Ball Power' to make it the ultimate in hand-launched spherical weapons. 1 Twinsen tries some target practice to prove his wizard-worth. 1 Riding that dinofly. Looks like a peaceful enough escapade. Unless the dinofly had bad guts, or died. Shudder. LITTLE BIG ADVENTURE 2: TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY REVIEWER 1 LIGHTING UP THE MAP 1 Burt Reynolds used to do this. Something else Twinsen has kept since his first adventure is the holomap, a portable globe that shows his location, and, by zooming in, a map of the island he is currently exploring. If someone gives him some information about a new location he has to visit, the map is updated and his next objective is marked with a red arrow. How convenient! I didn't get on with the first Little Big Adventure mainly because of the occasionally unwinnable combat scenarios and the general repetitiveness of the action. LBA2, however, looks and plays significantly better than its predecessor, offering a Legend of Zelda style of adventuring but with superb 3D graphics, an engaging (if slightly soppy), storyline, loads of different challenges to meet and plenty of cool things to play with. The action does take a while to get up to speed for the first half-hour or so you're never in any danger at all and your time is taken up just talking to people but by the time the aliens land you've got your hands full, and things keep building from there on. The combat is still a little weak because the magic ball is so tricky to aim and Twinsen often takes his time throwing it, but you're not as likely to be overwhelmed by enemies as you were in LBA1, and other weapons become available as you progress so that's not a major issue. Nope, good, solid fun is what's on offer here, and plenty of it so buying it would seem the only reasonable course. REVIEW Tent of the Weather Wizard PAUL GLACES 1 Yep, that looks like a map to us. RATING 1 You can even take the car racing, kind of. It might look a bit poncey-fairy-taley, but LBA2 has everything it takes to entertain adventure fans of all sizes. Citadel Island 63 "

Some of my all time favourite games include all the Zelda titles and both Shining Force games. But this just didn't give me the same amount of satisfaction as the others. The biggest problem! found is that you don't actually have that much control over what is going on. All I could do was point the cursor at a building and the character would walk there, or stand and watch all my troops get caned and then have a one-on-one duel at the end of it all.

It's the rebirth of cool as Sonic's original adventures reach a new generation! SCORE 200 TIME 1:19 INCS 23 onic The Hedgehog is the character that lead the rise of 16-bit video gaming a few years ago. At the end of 1992, when Sonic 2 was released, it was hard to survive a day without seeing or hearing something about the legendary blue hedgehog. Then he disappeared. Sega seemed to lose all interest in him, even ditching him as their company icon for a while. But now he's back, and in style. Sonic Jam is the first part of Sega's Project Sonic, with Sonic R and a new, secret 3D platform game to be released in the next year. This is your chance to go back in time and find out what caused all the fuss, as well as take a look towards the future! THE SONIC JAM! The games included in Sonic Jam are some of the best-known 16-bit games around, but chances are that not many people have played them for a while. Here's a quick refresher on each. DINOS NIC 1 SONIC 3 One of the most important 16-bit games ever, Sonic The Hedgehog had the best graphics seen on the Mega Drive as well as super-fast non-stop platform levels. Maybe slightly too short, the levels still had lots of reasons to play more than once. SCORE TIME 0:07 BINESO Although Sonic 3 was bigger and tougher than Sonic 2, it didn't have anywhere near the same effect on the public.

"computer video games SONIC REMIX! SONIC MEMORABILIA! SEO SATURN For those who've either never played the old Sonic games or have played them to death, Sonic Team have added some remixed modes. Original mode is exactly the same as the Mega Drive games; Easy mode leaves out certain enemies, adds platforms and items, and leaves out most bosses; while Normal mode redesigns sections of levels, normally making them slightly easier but still giving fans some new surprises. This feature is something that should definitely be included in more of these compilations of old games. SCORE ORIGINAL GO BACK ZOOM IN G CANCEL O NEXT ZOOM OUT 1 All the American Sonic packaging is in the Gallery. Oh deary deary us. Entering the Sonic World buildings lets you view all sorts of Sonicrelated things. In the Gallery you can see lots of pictures of Sonic, the Character House has lots more pictures and sketches of Sonic and his friends, the Sound room has all the sound effects and music from all the Sonic games, the Movie Theatre lets you view lots of Japanese TV adverts, Sonic cartoons and the brilliant Sonic CD intro and outros!

You can only race on the levels you've already completed, but the game will save the top three times for each act right down to the last hundredth of a second. Unfortunately you can't enter your name, but it still gives lots of scope for challenges against friends. If it wasn't for Sonic 1, I probably wouldn't be into games now. It was the first thing to get me completely hooked, and the excitement in the build-up to Sonic 2's release almost killed me. For anyone else like me (ie. sad people) Sonic Jam is fantastic! The chance to play all the games again without getting an old Mega Drive as well as using all the new features and remixed modes is brilliant. It's also amazing how well the games have aged, especially the epic Sonic 3 & Knuckles. The collections of artwork, movies and music are great for fanatics, and with a retail price of just . it makes it one of the best bargains on the Saturn. If there happens to be anyone who's never really got into the Sonic games, this is the compilation to convert them.

ZORE 1959 Alright! That ou eacher! Make no mistake PaRappa is a classic game, though not perfect. The graphics and sound are amazing, and it is a joy to play. Alas something's got to give, and in PaRappy's case it's the long term appeal. Only six levels, which are relatively easy to finish, means most players could have this at the bottom of their games collection in less than a week. It's a great game to impress friends who don't normally play video games, or even something that your granny might be able to have a go on. At the end of the day PaRappa The Rapper is a novelty, and sadly too short lived. It's such a quirky title that there will be some gamers who are disappointed, or misled by praise and hype. For me ! think it's essential that PaRappa succeeds, there are far to many sequel based and unoriginal games being released that the games market is slowly beginning to look very stale. For these reasons PaRappa is a breath of fresh air to the game scene. Vote PaRappa, and vive la difference! ALEX 404TALA QQ HIP HOP DON'T STOP!

If the meter drops into bad, strange things start happening to the level. This is because the sound and visuals are real-time generated! Rapping bad will make the music change, the rap meter drop to Awful, and things start going really screwy. Stay in the Awful zone too long and the tutor asks you to start the stage again. A classic or a cult? You decide. We love PaRappa, even with its flaws. Cartoon visuals, great songs, and a top sense of humour. Peace, we outta here. O "

Xevious returns, accompanied by his ancestors! f you were old (or young) enough to be frequenting arcades in the early eighties, no doubt you would have come across Xevious. A frantic shoot 'em up where you take on the marauding Xevious Horde. Through countless sequels the story continued, though only a true fan could be found playing them. Now comes the return. Part compilation, part rebirth. Included is the '96 update of the title Xevious 3D. The same Xevious thrills, but this time in the third dimension. Fans of the series, prepare to go wild and start frothing at the mouth! The rest of you stop sniggering. HYPNOGOGIC MIND MACHINE Shox Namco have been very brave with the design of Xevious 3D, wanting to retain the look and feel of the original, yet in a 3D environment. A large risk has been taken no texture maps. Most may feel that Namco have missed the boat somewhat, and that the game looks too basic. Though Xevious has a history of not looking state-of-the-art, it has built a reputation as a solid, addictive blaster. Zoiks! The bosses may have basic textures, but they can still look impressive at times. OLD FOLKS HOME Namco Museum Volume 4.5. That could have been the title of this disk. For not only do you receive the 3D game, but also three more blasts from the past. The original Xevious, plus Super and Arrangement incarnations. Visually indistinguishable, only their mother could tell them apart. All offer a slight variant on the same original thrill. Still, not bad for nowt pence. CFEDITES 20220 REVIEWER Socce This weapon fires out these crackly lines which follow enemies around the screen. Mmm, good. What Pacmania was for Pac-Man, so is Xevious 3D to its original. While the Pac is almost always welcome back into our hearts, Xevious has never retained the same respect. Xevious 3D would have been a great game almost a decade ago. but now is sadly something of an embarrassment. The trio of Xevious past seem to be placed on the disk to show how Namco have remained faithful to the series (just in case anyone had forgotten what they looked like). To their credit, Sony have lowered the number of continues for the European release, making a tougher game. Yet Xevious doesn't achieve the same levels of addictivenes and challenge as next month's Ray Storm. Sadly, Namco have backfired in their designs. One for the die-hard Xevious fans only. Alex 404TALA REVIEW FLY ME TO YOUR ROOM Your trusty craft, the Solvalu, is the last hope of the planet to defeat the Xevious clan and is armed with standard missiles and bombs. Upgrade weapons by locating crystals on your journey. Blue, red and green flavours affect your destructiveness, blue multiplies the standard payload, green gives you laser beams, and red gives you lock-on laser lightning bolts (well, that's what they look like). A fair degree of experimentation with the different weapons is required, especially when encountering bosses. BATING RATING DUU A missed opportunity. Xevious should have returned phoenix-like, instead of being reduced to a Z grade bit-player. 72 "

Until we got the game, no-one was really sure whether it was definitely going to come out on Sega's machine or not. Converted by Perfect, they've done a much better job than the last Wipeout which played completely differently on the Saturn to the way it did on the PlayStation. This time, although the graphics have been altered, the game plays pretty much as well as it ever did.

QURICOM CHeck ros 0:30.3 I AM THE FIREST... OH NO I'M NOT LAP 2012 wipo As with the first Saturn Wipeout game, the licenced music by \"real\" bands has been cut out. That means no Chemical Brothers, no Prodigy, no Underworld, and so on. Instead, Psygnosis's in-house Cold Storage has added a load more tunes, as well as remixing the originals. The two used in the PlayStation version were some of the best in the game, but the new ones don't come across quite as well. LRP TITES 10:46.4 0:26. ENERGY REVIEWER V BACK TO THE FUTURE! V POS Sos 11 In the year 2097, F3600 racing has been dropped in favour of the new, faster F5000 racing. Piloting super-fast hoverships, racers have new deadlier weapons which can be used to eliminate other pilots totally. Pits have been added to give the ships more chance of getting through entire races in one piece, and the tracks are more varied than before. There are three classes with two tracks for each, plus an extra class especially for the very best pilots in the world. FCISA. 0:49 60-12 0:34.. LAP TIRES 10:SS.O 189 WH 0:48.8 ENERGY Whoah! Avoid the loser! I've always loved the Wipeout games, and still play the PlayStation version of 2097 a lot now. The buzz you get from zooming around the incredible-looking tracks with fantastic techno blaring out of the speakers can't be touched by any other game. While the Saturn version seems excellent on paper, it doesn't have any of the feeling of the PlayStation version. The brilliant music tracks are missing (although Canada, one of the in-house tunes, was always one of the best anyway), the graphics have lost the edge that made them look so great, and the frame rate has dropped ever so slightly to become noticeable. They're all only minor changes that don't affect the way the game plays, but they really destroy what makes Wipeout 2097 so brilliant. Without the excellent rush that goes with the PlayStation version, Saturn 2097 just feels like a \"good\" racing game. There can't be many Saturn owners who want to play a cut-down PlayStation game on their machine I certainly don't.

While they don't look as good as the PlayStation originals, they certainly don't look as bad as the ones in the first Saturn Wipeout.

This can only be a conversion of the acclaimed strategy game that did once quite a name for themselves with mightily smite PC players! TM PlayStation WARCRAFT 2 lizzard Entertainment have made quite a name for themselves with their fantasy strategy and roleplaying games. Now they're out to establish a reputation with console players. What sort of game is Warcraft ir? Imagine a sort of D&D version of Command and Conquer, with axe-wielding Orcs, Human archers and Dragons, longboats and giant siege-engines replacing the commandos, snipers and heavy artillery. Playing as either the sinister Orcs or the barely nicer Human forces of Azaroth, you get over 50 missions in which to build your resources, marshal your forces and, with a bit of luck, kick the opposition right off the map. ..EMPIRE BUILDING... WARCRAFT 2 Whether you choose to play as Orcs or Humans, the format of most of the missions is the same. You start in a corner of the map, surrounded by unknown territory and equipped with the few meagre resources you need to build a force of skull-crushing maniacs. Your starter base usually comprises a central town hall type building which handles supplies and peasant training, and a small farm that produces food for your personnel. A couple of low-grade troops and one or two labourers are provided to kick off with. Here's how the game develops from this point on. Start by sending your low-grade troops out to explore the uncharted corners of the map, then get your peasants to start bringing in resources gold from the nearby mine, wood from the forest and food from the farm. Pretty soon you can be the proud owner of a navy of destroyers and troop ships, and an air force of dragon-riding knights and airships to deliver your army directly into enemy territory for a full-scale invasion! The scent of victory is in the wind! IT Peasants are also builders, but to begin with they can only create simple structures, like farms, town halls and barracks. Once they've got some experience they move on to more advanced projects, such as shipyards and foundries. REVIEW Training injects expertise into your forces, and constructing certain buildings complements others (eg, the foundry produces armour and enhanced cannons for the ships). As you progress your options branch out. 76 Rendered cut scenes appear throughout the game. "


"computer video games SEGA SATURN Some missions are simple clear-the-map-of-enemy-forces jobs, while others have more specific objectives. Houses can be used as shields for your army, so try to keep them out of the open. Once a dragon starts to attack your village, you've got big problems! The battles aren't restricted to land. Once you've built your ships, obtaining control of the waters is just as important. TM PlayStation <THROUGH THE ) DARK PORTAL.. The original missions follow the Command and Conquer style of building up a base and then launching an attack, but the missions in the extra campaign, which takes place in the Orcs' realm rather than the Human world, are slightly different. They usually give you a small force of more capable warriors, and possibly a sorcerer, who have to explore and fight as they go, making alliances and claiming buildings and equipment on the way. If you're after more immediate thrills and excitement, these are the best missions to play. Occasionally you have to raid an enemy base to recover a prisoner, or set up a beach-head with barracks and supplies for use later. 1 Sailing to unchartered territory and attacking the enemy forces is a lot more fun in the extra campaigns, as you already have a strong army to fight off the inhabitants. WARCRAFT 2 MAD CAMPAIGNS REVIEWER The PlayStation and Saturn versions of Warcraft II feature the original 26 missions from the PC version, plus the 26 from the Warcraft II add-on pack, making a total of 52 missions, plus customisable scenarios. Half of the missions put you in command of the Azaroth forces, and the other half give you the Orc NVE GOT THE Horde to play with. Aside HORN. LOADS from appealing to the OF THEM, IN player's alliance to order or pig-faced FACT. anarchy, there's no major advantage in playing as one side or the other, and the mission structures are usually the same for both. Everyone seems to be having a crack at the Command and Conquer-type strategy games these days, but Blizzard have got the formula just right with Warcraft II. The action is a little samey in the early campaigns, but each mission is a definite progression, with perhaps one new character or one new piece of equipment that subtly adds depth to the gameplay. The second set of campaigns is even more interesting though, mainly because the missions follow a more varied format and you get powerful mercenaries and wizards with cool spells to play with straight away. My only pernickety complaint is that the control system is a bit fiddly because once you've given an order to a unit you have to deselect it before you can attend to another. Usually that sort of thing winds me up no end, but in this case I'm prepared to forgive any such minor misdemeanours. Definitely one of the best PlayStation strategy games available. PAU. CANCES REVIEW RATING RATING A cool strategy/RPG that delivers quality Even if you already own C&C, Warcraft II is worth seeking out. 77 "


"computer video games NINTENDO 64 CORRIDOR HEXEN OCT RELEASE BY PROBE 1-4 PLAYERS n the PC, Hexen was a hit. It upgraded the brilliant Doom engine and added a real adventure feel by adding magic, items, and a level system which meant players could move backwards and forwards at will. The 32-bit console versions weren't bad, but we were expecting a lot more from a 64-bit version than this. There's an option to turn the blurring of the characters, but it makes everything look really blocky. The controls work reasonably well, but the new four-player split-screen mode is terrible. Hexen deathmatches involve quite a lot of hand-to-hand combat, but to keep the speed up the levels are made extremely foggy so that you can't see anyone until you're almost on top of them.

Gone are the pedestrians and red blood of the original, for the British release in come the zombies and green gunk. Killing the zombies is essential for surviving the race, they give extra time and extra credits. Money earned is used to build a better car, and even to repair damage while in the race.

Yes the star of those love 'em or loathe 'em adverts has been given his own game. It's a point and click adventure, where all the humour of the adverts has been expanded upon to create a unique world where Peperami and other vegetable and savoury products live. Of course Peperami himself is 'a bit of an animal'. As such you'll find yourself taking part in what is billed as the world's first 'Eat-em-Up' a sub-game which is heavily inspired by Doom. If you find playground humour such as this amusing, then you'll no doubt enjoy this game.

The only comedy bits you get in football is when Everton attempt to sign the whole of the Premier League or somebody scores an own goal. As a result, All Star Soccer just doesn't work. The commentary is funny the first time around and mildly amusing the next couple of goes. After that, well. I think you get the picture. Graphically, it seems like a step back from the other Eidos game, Olympic Soccer. The style is slanting towards the humour element, but the players look like cast offs from Clayfighter. And it has the annoying little bugs where the keepers always let in certain goals. It's a quirky enough game, but when you consider Olympic, this has to be seen as a major step back for Eidos.

The game plays pretty much the same as the first with a combo system which is similar to Virtua Fighter 2's. The damage aspect of Zero Divide has been improved upon, as powerful hits now visibly knock chunks off the robots' outer shells. If one body part takes too much damage, it becomes useless. The graphics are better than before, with smooth high-resolution characters though the backgrounds are mostly more basic. While it's not brilliant, Zero Divide 2 is certainly a lot better than many of the Tekken/Virtua Fighter 2 clones around at the moment. If you're after something different.

"computer video games (C) 1997 SNK ALBAADO INITIVO On Tuesday 1st July, SNK invited CVG down to take a look at their brand new hardware board, the Hyper NeoGeo 64 and some of the great new games they are developing for it! POWIN linii OMOGOH n the beautiful city of Osaka, the home of SNK, we are able to have the first play of Samurai Shodown 64 and Roads Rage at SNK's special arcade preview show. Having seen videos of the now legendary Samurai Shodown running on their new hardware in 3D at both the AOU Show and the Tokyo Game Show, excitement was at fever pitch as the top press gathered to finally play one of the most eagerly awaited games this year. SAMURAL SHOWDOWN Samurai Shodown 64 (known as Samurai Spirits in Japan) is a 3D sword fighting game, using an 8-way stick with 4 buttons (guard, weak attack, strong attack, dash). There are 11 selectable characters, one mid-boss and one endboss. Each fight uses a best of three rounds system. Far more than previous 3D fighting games, SS64 gives more opportunity to move around the stage, by allowing complete 360 degree freedom over your movement. There are some new special features too, beyond those of previous Samurai Shodown games, as detailed below! SNK'S ARCADE REVOLUTIO THE ANGER GAUGE! THE HYPER NEOGEO 64 As you take hits, your Anger Gauge fills. When full, your character enters a state of ANGER where 1. Attack strength increases. 2.

Pressing the A, B and C buttons together gives you a very special attack called the 'Anger Explosion!' THE SAMURAI DRIVE SYSTEM! SNK's new arcade hardware board is called the Hyper NeoGeo 64. As the successor to the very successful NeoGeo board, SNK have not only incorporated the latest in 3D capabilities, but included enhanced 2D capabilities as well. This is the first time that any company has created a hardware system with both advanced 3D and 2D technology. While the 3D features allow unprecedented realistic 3D CG to be realised, the 2D features permit incredibly smooth animation. Having both worlds of the computer game industry on one board will not only have amazing cost performance benefits, but will let SNK combine the best features of sprites and polygons together to create unparalleled games. The Hyper NeoGeo 64 uses a ROM Cassette to hold the software, which means that it is both practical y and easy to update and change games. SNK's new hardware is til running at a 1/60 second frame rate which allows it to create unbelievably realistic graphics. In addition, the Hyper NeoGeo 64 features a fantastic new sound system as well, to compliment the e excellent visuals. Without a doubt, SNK's Hyper NeoGeo 64 will be capable of creating a brand new virtual gaming world which we'll be able to enjoy at the arcade SOON! Giving beginners a better chance against experts, SS64 uses a new combat system that makes chain attacks easier. No matter which stick/ combination you select, you can still pull off a complete combo! FREE DASH. Press the D button and your character can dash in any direction you move the stick. By running around the stage, you can use various tactics to turn the battle to your advantage. However, this feature requires the Stamina gauge. HYPER. NEOHEN 64: BOARD SPECIFICATION SIAMINA GAUGE.

"1P NAKORORU QALFOREA * CURRENT DEVELOPMENT REPORT!* computer video games 11:11 D Samurai Shodown 64 is currently 40% complete with four playable characters (Haohmaru, Nakoruru, Galford and Ukyo) and three basic stages (see below). Each character had about six attacks with no specials. The Free Dash and Stamina Gauge were working, however the Anger Gauge wasn't. Only the main stage was present, but without its Field Shift features. Even at this early stage SS64 looks impressive. The fighting is very dramatic with realistic sound effects and sparks flying when swords clash. There's even different-sized splurts of blood depending on the strength of your attack! Being able to leap over your opponent or sprint right around them (either in front or behind) is refreshingly over-the-top. When both characters run away from each other the camera pans out very smoothly. It's great having such freedom of movement. Character motion-capture is highly impressive. When blocking, the fighters don't simply hold the sword, they use the other hand to support it against the blow. With each character the effect is different. Nakoruru puts her other arm behind her knife. Ukyo half draws his sword out, leaving the tip in the sheaf. Galford holds the top of the sword with his other hand. The select screen is really cool with the characters first being shown as beautifully-drawn pictures, changing into polygon versions of themselves when selected. They then make a special pose. Each character has several costume colours. Characters behave very naturally in the game. When not fighting they stand in a ready pose, moving slightly from side to side. Their weapons are sheathed, but as you attack they draw their swords out quickly. When running they hold their weapon at their side carefully. SNK have been able to convert everyone's favourite characters from sprite to polygon without losing any of their charisma. They act as you would expect, with agile Nakoruru moving quickly with multiple knife attacks. The huge Haohmaru, on the other hand, powerfully swings his sword. SAN FRANSISCO PORT Galford is fighting Nakoruru. The screen shows you looking out over the sea with the saloon to the left. Everybody has come out to watch the fight. The picture shows Nakoruru's wolf, which wasn't playable at the show. In the final version both her hawk and wolf, as well as Galford's dog will be included. Galford's Anger Gauge is now full so it's burning away. Nakoruru's Anger Gauge is almost empty. ZHAOLNWR 21 UKYO RID Each of the three stages gives a feeling that it's a real place and not just a backdrop behind another arena. Good use of well-drawn scenery gives a real feeling of depth. 64. SNK'S ARCADE REVOLUTIO SANFRANSISCO PORI KOREAN TEMPLE HYPEREOCERY Set on the sea front, this corral-like stage is constructed from four distinct features. To the left a huge galleon is docked at the quay. On deck several sailors are watching the fight. To the right is a saloon where customers and staff stare through windows, or have come out onto the walkway. Behind a large wooden fence you can see the main port area and its buildings. Lined up along the street are people watching the fight. Currently, the only background movement is reserved to the floating clouds, and spectators. Haohmaru is fighting Ukyo Tachibana. The screen shows you looking out over at a small wooden building with the steps leading to a path that goes to the temple to the left. There are no other people in this stage. Ukyo's Anger Gauge is nearly full while Haohmaru's is about half full. The symbol at the end of the gauge is the Japanese kanji for anger. As your gauge fills, the symbol gets bigger. BAMBOO FOREST HANZO 41 KAZUKA Ho pound Set deep in a wooded valley on a cliff's edge is a small village and next to it, a large semi-grassed clearing for this stage. Bounded by only a few trees and bushes, you have a great view of the valley which has a giant waterfall at one end. At its base is a large pool of water which forms into a river which runs past the cliff. To one side of the river is a small jetty but there are no boats to be seen. Around the stage are a several deer standing between the bushes, and three people in front of one of the small village huts. Currently, the only background movement is the waterfall. cs ARCADE KOREAN TEMPLE CANYON ROPEBRIDAE 7 front of an old temple is a courtyard contained by a large stone wall, a tall perimeter fence with a gate and a low wooden building. Between the courtyard and the temple is a huge stone archway with steps leading up. On either side of the steps there is a stone carved statue of an oriental lion. The entire area is surrounded y trees. There were two versions of this stage playable: nightime scene and a daytime scene. During the day, sunlight streams through the trees and you can easily ike out all the surrounding features. At night only a gle light coming from the temple can be seen. erything else is cast in shadows. Even the nightime zzing of the insects can be heard as well. Hanzo Hattori is fighting Kazuki Kazama. The screen shows the two characters standing on a rope bridge over a large canyon. Neither this scene nor these two characters were available at the show. Hanzo is in a state of anger. At any moment the rope bridge could collapse and the characters would shift to a new field of battle. "

All the finishing touches are now being put in, so expect a full report soon on the final release version. Many games use a system of altering the route through a game. However, they normally involved finishing one stage before choosing the next. In G Darius the game route actually changes during a stage! For example, in one zone you have the choice of continuing to fly above the water and taking the airborne route or sinking beneath the waves and taking the underwater route. Both the way the boss attacks, and the various weaponry it carries, changes also. There are 15 zones divided into 30 areas. In keeping with the G-Darius theme, every zone begins with G, for example (Green Globe, Giant Fortress, Galaxy Islands). Halfway through each zone there are divisional areas to enter, each protected and guarded by different bosses with different weapons. There are an unlimited number of selections. To complete a game, you need to battle through 5 zones. (C) 1997 TAITO The popular mid-boss capture system used in Darius Gaiden has been enhanced. The scope of the capture system now covers almost everything in the game, with only the final boss and things on the ground excluded. All you have to do is fire a Capture Ball at one of the mid-air enemies. If it strikes, the enemy takes no damage, but instead becomes your ally and can assist you in your attack against the enemy boss ship. Use the capture bombs wisely to destroy the captured enemies. In addition, by keeping the A button pressed down while holding a captured enemy, you can transform them into 'Energy' and unleash a powerful Alpha Beam attack!

[60% COMPLETE] LE MANS 24 Developed by AM#3 Model 3 Driving Game 55 RENOWN CHARGE M3's trademark with race games has always been realism. And with their first Model 3 racer, realism is gonna get a whole lot realer! Stage One: To find a suitable racing backdrop. AM3's choice the Le Mans 24-hour endurance race! Stage Two: Bring it to life! And with Le Mans 24 that's exactly what AM3 have done! Battle it out over the gruelling 24 hours with six of the world's top car manufacturers, Mazda Speed, Porche, Mercedes, MacLaren, Nismo and Ferrari. Le Mans 24 has been designed to appeal to a wide audience, from beginners to die-hard game fans. The car bodies and the race course are fully created with the high level graphics only made possible by the power of the Model 3 CG board. Sega's know-how and the latest technology combine to bring you the world of Le Mans 24 in stunning realistic detail! You can with THIS Nissan! RENOWN MODEL 3 RACING WITH LE MANS 24! Not your average Mazda. THE RACE! arex SUCUDERIA GET REAL! The Ferrari F40. An awesome car! After selecting your car (the choice is Ferrari F40 GTE, Sauber C9-Mercedes, Nismo GT-R, LM Nissan or Mazda 787B) and its transmission, the game begins. Using a free-entry system, the race continues even when no-one is playing. You are permitted to enter the race at any time. The player's 24-hour endurance race begins from the point they enter the action. You must pass each checkpoint within the set time and complete the race within 24 hours (about 10 mins). If you overtake rival cars during the race you can get extra points and extended game time. Complete the race and you can enjoy the challenge of a special extra course. At the very end of the game your rank is displayed on screen. THE COIN-OP The appeal of Le Mans 24 comes two-fold firstly from great handling and secondly from driving through a whole day. The incredibly realistic driving 'feel' of these cars was made possible by the expert advice given to AM3 by professional drivers (Youjiro Terada and Naoki Hattori). Wait until you check out the incredible handling and drift of these cars! As for the 24-hour race, the Variable Scenery system in Le Mans 24 means that the course and race conditions are continuously changing. The road surface, weather and time of day operate in real time, so whether you are driving on a freeway during a hot sunny day or racing on a normal road at night in the pouring rain, you can be sure that no two games are ever the same! Keeping all the features coin-op racing fans have come to expect, Le Mans features four different driving views. Link-up is also possible between up to six cabinets. AM4 have also used a multi-speaker system, to provide realistic engine sounds and pounding background tunes. Finally, the basic machine uses a hefty 29-inch screen!

Anything one does, the other can do better! Driving games, fighting games, tank/robot duel games, motorcycle games, even skiing games! But there's one category that, for a while, Sega indisputedly held the crown to. Gun games! With Virtua Cop they re-invented the formula through awesome 3D graphics and realtime shootouts! There was nothing that could touch it, until Namco answered with Time Crisis! More than just a clone, Crisis evolved the gun game concept further. And more even than Virtua Cop 2, Time Crisis became the true 'next evolutionary stage' in gun gaming. However, Virtua Cop still reigns supreme in one area the home! The Saturn version, with replica gun, is unchallenged by any gun game on any home system. Now Namco have drawn their bead on the home gamer.

The first is the pedal, which allows you to dodge behind scenery, thus adding evasion tactics to the gameplay. The second ingredient safeguards against you using the pedal to hide indefinitely a time limit! With the clock as your enemy too, this isn't just a shooting game, it's a racing game! And that's the Time Crisis! 6326 10:29 1?! PLUS GUNCON! STAGE 1 CLEAR  DEGREES OF ACCURACY  03 55\"30 ACCUR 12 As crucial to PlayStation Time Crisis as the coding conversion itself, is the authentic coin-op gun. Matching AM2's Virtua Gun, Namco have packed an excellent quality piece. Known as the GunCon, it's a customised replica of the arcade pistol, with added 'action' buttons on either side of the barrel. A couple of things to note. Firstly, the gun doesn't have any kickback mechanism. Secondly, it is only compatible with Namco gun games (Point Blank being the next one). However, we expect software companies will make their future games work with the Gun Con. After all, let's face it, if you're going to buy one PlayStation gun, you're going to get the one that's compatible with (and packaged with) Time Crisis. Right? Namco have been doubly cautious in ensuring the GunCon is super-accurate. And rightly so! Unlike the 'fat' bullets of Virtua Cop, the shots in Time Crisis have a far smaller impact diameter. You have to be more precise than ever! Guncan.000 ath FCBUTTO?

"REPRODUCING THAT PEDAL \" WHY'S THIS PEDAL SO SPECIAL ANYHOW?!! computer video games \" Swift effective use of the pedal is vital to Time Crisis' gameplay! For those who've never played the coin-op, it should be noted that pressing the pedal swings you out from behind cover, not the other way around! Release it and you immediately duck. Here's a quick rundown of why you need fancy footwork! TM Namco once stated they would never bring out any of their System 22 games on PlayStation (System 11), clearly because they wouldn't be arcade-perfect. With Time Crisis they've broken that vow, but what a game to pick. Not only does it need a replica gun, but a pedal too!

When this flashes onscreen, look out something big is coming toward you! Sometimes you can stop it, other times... Swinging off-screen affects accuracy, which is why you should keep it swift. More so. because while hidden the enemy can move about too! A RACE AGAINST TIME! The 'time crisis' is more than just a slapped-on countdown timer.

She couldn't accept that Nina would stay young, while she got older. So Anna put herself into a cold sleep as well, to awaken when Nina did. The time the present. Nina is awoken by the God of Fighting and Anna woke up at the same time. She attacked Nina, but soon realised that Nina had completely lost her memory. Deciding she didn't want to quarrel with a sister who couldn't even remember her, Anna is now trying to stop Nina being an assassin, and is now involved in the God of Fighting mystery. After Heihachi regained the Mishima Empire and uncovered the God Of Fighting (see CVG #184) he was visited by his long-lost grandson Jin Kazama. Hearing what happened to Jin's mother, Jun, Heihachi reasoned that the God of Fighting thrived on the strong spirits of others. Heihachi trained Jin, whose spirit had far surpassed those of Jun and Kazuya, to use him to lure the \"God of Fighting\". When Jin reached 19 years old, Heihachi organised the third Iron Fist Tournament. At the same time he noticed that Jin was gaining the same dangerous power Kazuya had. Heihachi decided to dispose of Jin after he had lured the God of Fighting, in order to prevent his doomed destiny. FOUR MORE CHARACTERS REVEALED!

Instead of being buried, Bryan's corpse was brought back to life by one Dr Abel. This 88-year old scientist was fairly famous in the underground scientific society, but his studies were always beaten by Dr Boskonovitch. Now though, he was finally in the last stage of his 'Cyborg Army' project. Abel thought the perfect cyborg must have Boskonovitch's permanent mechanism though, and revived Bryan's dead body to have him collect Boskonovitch's brain data. In his former life Bryan was a skillful detective, but there were rumours that Lei Wulong had discovered he had a connection with drug dealers. Bryan has sneaked Into the third Iron Fist Tournament, targeting Yoshimitsu, who has a strong connection with Boskonovitch. An ancient native American Indian legend says that Ogre was a war weapon which creatures from another planet left on the Earth in ancient times. It understands the entire structure of all living and artificial beings, and absorbs them. It wanders the world in search of those with strong spirits, but all other knowledge about it was forgotten a long long time ago. 97 "


"computer video games THE RAC BRITISHGRAND PRIX Damon Hill had the chance to bring his formula One season to life in front of his home crowd, while the Villeneuve and Schumacher battle for supremacy rages on. This is the British Grand Prix! TOTAL AtasterCard HEWLETT BIR PACKARD AUTOSPORTH t's two o'clock on Sunday afternoon and we're standing in the pole position box at Silverstone. Looking out onto the track, we can see Jacques Villeneuve sitting in his Williams Renault with all of the newly refurbished Silverstone circuit in front of him. Behind him await Schumacher, Coulthard, Irvine and Alesi, all eager to win this prestigious race. The first red light activates and the engines roar into life! Those without earplugs frantically rush stop their eardrums from playing an impromptu solo on the tarmac. As the second and third red beacons come alive, the engine noises get louder and louder and you can almost taste the adrenalin! A second passes, then it's green, and in a blur of sound colour and excitement the cars disappear in an instant, leaving a strange wobbling feeling in your stomach. Even if you go to an F1 meet just once in your life, it's worth it for this experience alone! via Goon ONKA MELINDA MESSENGER AND THE BRITISH GP! Zepter paralat permai THE STARS! To say that Formula One is where you go to mingle with the celebs, is a bit of an understatement. As well as all the drivers who are stars in their own right those with a sharp eye would have spotted the 'Page 3 girl for the Thrillenium' Melinda Messenger, wearing just about enough to show she was representing the Jordan Team. Pierce Brosnan popped in with the missus to have a wander around the pit lane, along with the lover of anything vaguely related to cars, Jay K from Jamiroquai. Autograph hunters paradise. LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC SILVERSTONE: AKA THE RETIREMENT HOME! ac RaC RE I CAN SEE SOME \"EADLAMPS COMIN OUR WAYI YA, THATLL BE MELINDA THEN. SNORTI Watching F1 live means that unless you have an Inspector Gadget style neck, you're not going to see the cars for more than a few seconds at a time, as they whizz through at speeds of over 200mph! Which is why you really want to see loads of cars on the track, and no people dropping out. But come the last ten laps, what we actually saw was loads of retirements and no cars left. Schumacher and Irvine suffered mechanical problems, the first time a Ferrari hasn't finished a race this season. Hakkinen, rather unfortunately suffered engine failure no more than five laps from the end, having taking the lead shortly before. C Ra RaC RAC R FEATURE WATCH FOR THE LIGHTS! AND DAMON GOT A POINT The race for Pole was an extremely close affair, with Villeneuve nipping in at the last minute to secure his sixth pole of the season. Frentzen was just behind him, with Hakkinen third and Schumacher fourth. However, a disastrous start for Frentzen occurred when he stalled his car and the first start was aborted. As punishment, he was sent to the back of the grid, and Jacques had the front row to himself. Frentzen then crashed out four corners into the race, to complete a miserable time for the German. The safety car left the track a couple of laps after, and the race began!    At the end of it all, Villeneuve won with Alesi second and newcomer Wurz third. Damon Hill scored his first point of the season and got a massive cheer for doing it. Everybody goes home happy. Our thanks go to Helen and Howard from Sierra for the whole kaboodle. Guys and gals, it was awesome! 98 "
