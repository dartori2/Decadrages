"HOW WOULD YOU FARE IN THE WORLD CUP? NEXT June will find normally mildmannered men vehemently pushing forward halfbelieved theories as indisputable facts. Gesturing wildly with beer-glasses and shouting down conflicting opinions with a bigotry which belies 50,000 years of civilisation. Yes, you guessed, the World Cup is with us again and love it or adore it -it's difficult to close your eyes to it. Already the arguments rage with the Hoddle Walks on Water school, battling against the He Couldn't Kick His Way Out of a Paper Bag theorists. Northern Ireland is dogged with the Martin O'Niell question and Scotland which has seen it all twice before in the last eight years is gearing itself up for the Jordan or Gray debate. It's certainly a hot topic in Argentina and probably causing quite a furore in El Salvadore. But if the facts don't finally support your views then Computer & Video Games can help you take the matter into your own hands. If you feel England would have qualified from their group if only Greenwood had followed your advice for the team against France then you will have the opportunity to prove it next month when we publish our World Cup Manager game. You can choose to manage any of the 24 sides, pick your team, play your matches and find out how you've fared. Send out your scouts to watch the opposition, brief your team on tactics, discover the danger men in the opposition and make arrangements to mark them. Winning with Brazil or West Germany is a hard enough task but anyone who can do it with El Salvador will really have proved their management potential. We think it's a winner, see what you think next month.  Everyone will be a winner with our World Cup competition. The Silica Shop is putting up the Atari T.V. Games Centre and football cartridge for the first prize but there are also consolation prizes and everyone who enters will receive a  voucher to spend at the Silica shop. Find out how to enter and test your football judgement in our June issue. If the spirit of Adventure is lurking in your veins, you'll find plenty of ideas in our June issue. We have four very different adventures featuring next month. From outer space thrills in the Star Wars mould with Dog Star Adventure down to the depths of the earth for a very different kind of challenge in the hunt for Trolls Gold. Or you could Save the Princess in another short adventure game for Atom owners. When the BBC lends its name to a product it has to be special and the microcomputer that bears its name falls into that category. If you own one already have one on order, or just have a healthy interest in the machine, you'll want to read our special section on this highly rated microcomputer including three of the first games created for it. Commodore's VIC-20 is now in the high streets and selling well. The company is supporting it with some high quality games cartridges and a growing range of peripherals. A complete rundown on this popular micro takes place in next month's Hardcore section. The response to our first issue's free cover puzzle N 7 caught us on the hop. This time we think we're ready for you and we've also set you programmer/puzzlers a slightly more challenging task. There's another free puzzle, from the people at Pentangle, going on our June front cover and although you won't need a computer to solve it we hope you'll use one to enter our second competition. Even if you don't win you should emerge a better problem solver for trying. The Beat-the Bug puzzle will make Computer & Video Games stand out even more on your local newsagent's shelves. But why not make sure of your copy by subscribing now. I would like to take out an annual subscription I enclose a cheque/PO. for , ( overseas) for twelve issues.

"FROM THE BATTLEZONE COUNTING ON COMMODORE Dear Sir, To my mind, people are attracted to arcade games subconsciously, for they often get out far more than they put into these computers. Take Atari's Battlezone. It caught my eye in a fish'n'chip shop because of the XY monitor with vector scans, and the prodigious amount of maths the computer gets through in real time. In case you haven't met it, it's a fighting tank simulator in which you drive around a valley dodging missiles and rocks. Everything is portrayed in full perspective, right down to the missiles flying longer to distant targets. A kind man let me mend one. There's a 6502 riding a 12K program, plus four custom bit-slice chips doing 16-bit trigonometry. among the 150 other support devices. She certainly puts out more than you put in. At a guess the software came out of the backdoor from NASA, Boeing and Lockhead. Thought your readers might be interested. Jonathan Pope Chesterton Road, Cambridge. I would just like to | Julians Road, St Albans, congratulate you on the Hertfordshire and D. E. marvelous reading that your Graham is the person to magazine offers. contact. Mr J Harrison, Millbrook, Southampton. Editor's reply: 'I'm afraid that you either have a faulty cassette containing the Dear Sir, game, or a faulty computer.

The Beebug User Group But also even with all your hall vour can be found at 35 St excellent advice I am still TUNE IN TO THE BBC unable to create my dream game, which, when finished I might let you see. To tell the truth I haven't started yet but with your help, who knows? I am presently using an Apple II. I have searched the manuals high and low in order to find some good sound effects. All I have achieved so far is a loop around a line like PEEK (-16336) -PEEK (-16336) + PEEK (-16336). Are there any other ways of getting sound from the Apple because this sounds horrible. Not exactly your ideal laser gun sound. I am also experiencing problems in High Res Graphics. I am presently using a shape from a shape table with the command. DRAW 1 AT 10, 10 This works fine but I would like to know how to make the shape move by pressing a key on the keyboard and for that shape to continue moving until that key is released. Another problem I have is how to make the aforementioned shape explode or disappear when touched by another shape e.g. a missile. Is there any way your dedicated readers could help me and I'm sure many others like me? Please, please write in because I'm really desperate. I'm sure many readers with Apple's without paddles would like to know how to convert the Dogfight by Mark Pelczarsk in the February issue in to a keyboard operated version. Paul Cainey Exeter, Devon. JUMBLED ADVENTURE SOUND AND VISION... Dear Sir, I have an Atari 400 computer with a microtex 32K card in it. Please could you help me with a problem I have. When I run Scott Adams adventure games, 1, 2, and 3. 90 percent of the time when I run the games they are all right, but sometimes when I press the return key, the screen is covered with jumbled-up letters and then after about two seconds, the screen either goes black or yellow and black with machine code symbols. The only way out of this is to turn the power off and to start again. I have also tried the games on an Atari 800 and the same thing happens. Tito 10 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"ITIONCOMPETITIONCOMI Would you make out as a berserker And the first 15 imaginative names we receive will be given a place in the game. We also need your name, address and telephone number but most importantly we need 15 people who will make the deadlines for orders, not lose heart if their system is invaded by a fleet of Berserkers and be willing to write the occasional piece about the game for inclusion in the magazine. So be quick off the mark with your letter. Confessions of a Bug your games Do you see yourself as a Berserker, spreading fear through the galaxy with your army of life-crushing robots? All those now in a state of confusion should turn straightaway to page 70 for enlightenment. If you have already digested our double page spread on computer moderated gaming then you will be ready to carry on. Flying Buffalo's U.K. agent, Chris Harvey is offering 15 Computer & Video Games readers the chance to take part in a special free game of Starweb. It's special because the company is promising a fast turnaround so you ll be able to see the results of your orders without having to wait the usual four weeks. The computer is running off the first few turns of the game, so that you begin the game already involved in the action. We will also be following your fortunes in the magazine with a regular column devoted to the deals, battles, hopes and fears of the players. If you would like to join in, write, telling us which of the six character types you would like to play: Berserker, Apostle, Pirate, Artifact Collector. Empire Builder or Merchant. Choose a species name for your race which fits the character type you have decided on. Calling aspiring games writers: If you think your games deserve a wider audience then send them in to us with instructions, a list of variables, and other helpful information to aid our readers in the understanding of the game. No matter what machine you want to write on, we'll try and get around to publishing your game. A printout is what we will eventually need but we can make do with a tape â€” which also helps us try the game out and get the game printed from that. Our thanks to all those who have sent games in to us so far but there are some machines we would like to continue to support and we are running short of good games for. Remember we pay  for each listing published and there's also a chance of winning a trip to Paris if your game is voted the best of the year. There are times when we Bugs surprise even ourselves. The February edition offered the Tandy TRS-80 game of Grand Prix which generated innumerable phone calls from readers who claimed various assorted gremlins in the program but we never touched it! Honest! The most popular theory expounded was that disc based instructions made it impossible to run with a cassette. But after thorough testing (a Bugs curse on John Gibbs of Dover) it has been proved to everyone's satisfaction that the game works perfectly well on both disc and cassette. The problems seem to relate to the data statements and making sure you distinguish between a \"B\" and an \"8\" in these. Also check the letters \"D\" and \"O\" in the program. A program which includes a line to check the data entry is available from Computer & Video Games for anyone still having problems with this game. The ZX81 Poker game in our April issue caused plenty of phone calls from observant programmers who spotted an IF statement in line 3530 with no THEN attached. The line is correct as far as it goes but continues: =J(4 ANDJ(2) +2=J(3)+1 THEN LET T4=1234 This game does in fact work without the missing line until you get three of a kind up and so slipped through the rigorous testing the editor put it through The Moon Lander caused a few problems as a rogue symbol appeared in the printout in line 360.

BREAKOUT This version of the popular arcade Breakout game features a curved bat. The idea is the same as the original game. Your task is to keep a ball in play by bouncing it off your bat. Using the joystick to control the movement of the bat. At the top of the screen are several layers of coloured bricks which you must dislodge with the ball. For each brick you knock out you are rewarded with a varying number of points, depending on the layer which the brick comes from. If you miss the ball and don't catch it on your bat it automatically goes out of play. You get three balls to play with. After you have lost the third one the game ends.

There are two exits from the room but you can only escape when you have shot the aliens lurking in the room. You move your man around the room picking off the slow-moving creatures. For each one you kill you are rewarded with a number of points. When all the aliens turn green you know there are only 10 left to get rid of. You can angle your shots left or right, up or down. If you need to you can take diagonal aim at the creatures. The first wave of beasts is the easiest. After wiping them out, you make your man run out of one of the exists -taking care not to bump into any of the deadly radioactive walls. Then you begin the second phase, and things get tougher.

"Everyone knows computers can play chess but they are also very able problem solvers. An intriguing type of problem on which little work has been carried out so far is the retrograde analysis problem. These problems, unlike conventional ones with requirements such as \"White to play and mate in three moves\" are concerned only with the past history of positions. A recent collection of retrograde analysis problems by the American logician Raymond Smullyan was presented as a series of chess detective stories, entitled The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes. Here is a relatively simple example invented by Smullyan. It is Black's move. The White King has accidentally fallen off the board. The problem is to place it back on the correct square. At first glance, this problem seems unsolvable, or rather, there seems no reason why the moved his King away from b3 to a3 for example, but not a2 where it would itself be in check discovering check by the Bishop on a4. Unfortunately on b3 the White King is in double check by the Black Rook and Bishop. What was Black's previous move? There is no possible Rook or Bishop move by Black which produces the required double check configuration, apparently another example of an imaginary check. In fact, however, this one is only \"pseudo imaginary\" are generally not concerned with strong sequences of play, or even sensible ones, but merely legal ones. Underpromoting, that is turning an eighth rank pawn into something other than a queen, is quite legal (even likely) in these problems. A researcher at Bristol, Brian Alden, has recently written a program which solves quite a number of retrograde analysis Na 6 a b c d e f g h problems and later I will look at this in some detail In the meantime here are two more problems for you to consider. The problem given in figure three is quite simple. To program the solution to this and the previous one you have to write a reverse legal move generator. The rightmost Pawn in figure four is not a printing error. It is deliberately placed halfway between the g file and the h file. t 1 a b c d e f g h since the desired effect can be achieved by an en passant Pawn capture. Figure two shows the position shortly before. Black has just moved his Bishop to give check. The game continues 1. c2-c4, b4 x c3 en passant; 2. Kb3 x c3, giving figure one. Thus, the White King originally stood on c3. This example illustrates a number of important features of retrograde analysis problems. Firstly, the phrasing of the question does not immediately suggest that any backward analysis of the position is necessary, but the problem cannot, in fact, be solved otherwise. Secondly, it is crucially important to think of asking the right questions. Care must be taken with imaginary checks; a move may have involved a capture including an en passant capture; a piece on the eighth rank may represent a promoted Pawn. It is important to note that retrograde analysis problems OV . i a b c d e f g h King cannot be on any one of many possible squares. The key to the solution is to notice that the Black King is in check. Since White moved last, what move did he make to give check? If the White King were on h3, say, it is impossible to \"unmake\" any previous White move which takes Black out of check. This is an example of what is known as an imaginary check. Since the initial position is known to be legal, the only possibility is that White has just N a b c d e f g h The problem here is: does the Pawn stand on g2 or h2? It is White to move and as a cryptic hint, you are given that there have been no \"underpromo. tions\". Brian Alden's program solves this problem can you do as well? Solution next month.

Fig. 1 This article is intended to help both you and your computer OCB play Reversi also known as OAD Othello more skillfully, by three simple rules-of-thumb. They form the backbone of my program, and have been balanced by practice trial-anderror. Thumb 1: The whole game is 3 about capturing corners, as then you can safely expand from the captured corners without risk of 11 capture yourself, So a general rule is take a corner whenever a b c d e f g h you can, and avoid playing next Fig. 2 to the corners for fear of giving your opponent a chance to take it. Generally, the nearer you play to a corner the more dangerous it is in the long-term. So set values as in diagram one, making the machine select the most negative valid move. Thumb 2: You want to force your opponent to give you one or more corners as early in the game as possible. So you want to force him by giving him no option. The best way to reduce your opponent's options is by a b c d e f g h taking as few pieces as possible Fig. 3 . but don't lose them all! With that ploy, you can easily slaughter any thumbless human or machine. Once you have the corners secure, you then get revenge. In diagram two, the square that captures least pieces for Black D at h7 â€” forces White to give a corner by playing at A or it is the best move. So any move that takes lots of pieces early on must be bad. Add points to the value of such squares to dissuade the computer playing there. Thumb 3: Early on, if you take a side you might feel it a good way of restricting your opponent's options which is true. But at the end, when corners fall, he who has the sides generally loses. Look at diagram three Black to play. Black will lose all four corners but win massively. Try it! So avoid taking the sides by spotting when side pieces would get captured, and again make such squares less attractive. Balancing thumbs: No single thumb should totally over-ride any other. Sometimes it is better to take lots of pieces â€” if it avoids giving away a corner. Capturing a side isn't all that disastrous so in diagram two, if it is White to play then P at h3 is far more preferable to A or C in the corner. So only add a few points to the side capture value. It also takes two pieces but is better than the alternatives of capturing only one. It is surprising how careful balance of thumb values can encourage good effective play. My Thumb I comer values are deliberately big. The squares next to a corner are ugly, while the corner is a luscious -9! The diagonal value is 22 quite a bit preferable to the 29's in my experience if you have to give a corner away, do it diagonally. Nine times out of 10 it is best. Of course, there are times when the thumbs are not valid at the end you want to capture as many pieces as possible. ooooo 2 8 OOOO 6oooooooo "

"ZX 80/81 HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ZX KEYBOARD OOOOOO Pradeda ca CDC Now with repeat key and facilities to add numaric pad. The keyboard has all the 80/81 functions on the keys, and will greatly increase your programming speed. It is fitted with push type keys as in larger computers The keyboard has been specially designed for the Sinclair computer and is supplied ready-built. It also has facilities for 3 extra buttons which could be used for on/off switch, reset, etc. .95. Numaric add on . 4K GRAPHICS ROM The dk Graphic module is our latest ZX81 accessory. This module, unlike most other accessories fits neatly inside your computer under the keyboard. The module comes ready built, fully tested and complete with a 4K graphic ROM. This will give you 448 extra pre-programmed graphics, your normal graphic set contains 64. This means that you now have 512 graphics and with there inverse 1024. This now turns the 81 into a very powerful computer, with a graphic set rarely found on larger more expensive machines. In the ROM are lower case letters, bombs, bullets, rockets, tanks, a complete set of invaders graphics and that only accounts for about 50 of them, there are still about 400 left (that may give you an idea as to the scope of the new ROM). However, the module does not finish there; it also has a spare holder on the board which will accept a further 4K of ROM/RAM. This holder is fitted with a 1K/2K RAM and can be used for user defineable graphics so you can create your own custom charactor sets. .95. MEMORY 80/ 81 16K RAM Massive add-on memory for 80/81. .95. 16K KIT-A-KIT VERSION of a 16K Ram. Full instructions included. All memory expansions plug into the user port at the rear of the computer. 16K RAM 642.95 16K KIT .95 2K & 4K RAM Static Ram memory expansion for the 80/81. They both work with onboard Ram i.e. 4K plus onboard = 5K. This is the cheapest small memory expansion available anywhere. 2K RAM .95. 4K RAM .95. IO PORT Interface your computer with the real world, our 10 port has holders to add up to 6K of RAM. .95. 16K 81 SOFTWARE As seen at the ZX Microfair. DEFLEX This totally new and very addictive game, which was highly acclaimed at the Microfair, uses fast moving graphics to provide a challenge requiring not only quick reaction, but also clever thinking. One and two player versions on same cassette. .95 3D/3D LABYRINTH You have all seen 3D Labyrinth games, but this goes one stage beyond; you must manoeuvre within a cubic maze and contend with corridors which may go left/right/up/down. Full size 3D graphical representation. .95. CENTIPEDE. This is the first implementation of the popular arcade game on any micro anywhere. Never mind your invaders, etc., this is positively stunning, the speed at which this runs makes ZX invaders look like a game of simple snap. .95. Graphic ROM Software Centipede. The graphic ROM version of our popular Centipede game. The only real version of Space Invaders on the ZX81. 23 Sussex Road, Gorleston, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

"RUNS ON A TRS 80 IN 16K DU DOCKING is one of the most difficult manoeuvres a space pilot has to deal with. In Earth-Port II you have to land your ship safely in the docking bay of a spaceport somewhere in the galaxy At the start of the game you enter your military rank â€” you can chose between private first class, corporal, captain, major, colonel and general. The higher your rank, the harder the game becomes. You control the spaceship by using the four arrow keys. The program will respond when two keys are pressed at once. For example the down and left arrows together. Once you have guided your ship safely to within a certain proximity of the spaceport, your on-board computer will automatically switch your view screen to a close up view of the landing bay. There's a slight catch to the game too. You have to land before your limited supply of oxygen runs out. The higher your rank the less oxygen you start out with High rank is obviously a big drawback -as the more stripes you have the greater the initial momentum of your ship. At the rank of general you have only seconds to prevent a fatal crash. 5 CLS:PRINT:PRINTTAB:16) ENTER YOUR RANK\" PRINT:PRINTTABI24)\"1.

"DUC MUNCH your way around a maze in this adaptation of the popular arcade game. The deadly ghost which haunts this maze is just as hungry as in the arcade version but it's not after the tasty dots which fill the maze it's after you!  But the ghost is not invulnerable. From time to time it becomes luminous. Then you have 10 seconds to catch it but you have to be quick as during this time the ghost also puts on an extra turn of speed. If you catch the ghost it returns to the centre of the maze and the game continues. If the ghost is not captured in time then you lose. Your character is controlled by the keyboard but the ghost moves randomly, changing direction when it reaches a junction in the maze. Once the maze is emptied of dots -and you have managed to avoid the ghost it is refilled and the game gets harder. Every number possible has been changed to a variable to speed up the program as much as possible. Many of the GOTO's and RETURNS are also for speed. Here are some details of the program: Lines 50-70 control timing of the ghost. Lines 90-130, control movement of the Puckman. Lines 140-190, control ghosts' movement. Lines 210-260, scoring. Lines 280-290, tunnel joining sides of maze. Lines 310-320, random movement of ghost. Lines 380-410, variables. Lines 420-660 maze. Lines 780-1240, instructions.

DOUBLE Cannon is a shoot-emup (or down) game for one or two players. A sharp eye is needed to judge when the randomly moving target crosses the path of your laser cannon. But you can't waste time waiting for the perfect shot, as the game is also timed. Yet, it is important that you not waste any shots, either, since your cannon has just enough energy for 20 shots. To fire, the player on the left need only press the Z key, while the player on the right should press the M key. A green box will indicate the time remaining in the game and a blue box for each cannon will show the number of shots you have used. Hits are recorded by red blocks above each cannon's blue box. For two players, the winner is the shooter with the most hits. When there is just one player, the object is to get as many hits as possible. Included with the line listing are definitions of the major variables. Also, a line-by-line description of the main game loop is presented. Perhaps of interest to programmers is the movement of the target. The target location for the PLOT commands is X, Y. This is adjusted each move by the variable X1 and Yl (line numbers 302, 307). For example; if X=30, Y=10, X1=1 and Yl=1, then after line number 307 has been executed, X=31 and Y=11 SO the target is moving down and to the right. When the target reaches the right edge of the screen, X1 will be changed to -Xi (X1= -1), since in line 302 the test for X greater than 57 is true. Now the value will decrease by one as Y increases â€” so the target will move down and to the left. RUNS ON AN 126 PRINT \"Time left is indicated in 6 REEN.

You have to fly ahead of your mother ship and blast a path through a severe meteor storm. This is also a paying proposition. You are given points (the monetary system is in points) for just staying alive by dodging the meteors. If you don't want to make your first million within your own lifetime, then just dodge. But for each meteor you destroy you get 100 points. When the situation gets very dangerous, you can go into hyperspace. I must warn you to use this as few times as possible because you could come out of hyperspace right on top of a meteor, or be hopelessly lost in space. Within a short time, however, you will be navigating through the meteors with the best of them. Now for the variable list: A$Used for temporary storage of INKEY$ and used all over. E$ this is what your shot looks like. G This is the PRINT at location of your shot. If it is zero, then you aren't shooting HP High score HP$ The name of the high scorer.

Y$ Used to ask, \"DO YOU WANT TO TRY ANOTHER MISSION?\" Now to explain myself a little. First, the whole secret to this game is the screen's scrolling ability. When the screen is made to scroll, everything on it seems to go flying past. That is the way I made such a fast game with such a small amount of typing. This, however, is the most useful technique I have found. You may have seen a table that has the keyboard memory on it. Actually, there is no real memory between location 14336 and 15359. It is a bunch of switches that were mapped into a place in memory. The author, Mr Harper, says he encourages people to edit the daylights out of his program. So if you think you can make Meteor Storm a better game to play, feel free. -) > 127. THEN 6 = 2:51 16287 11.GO.FO 180 171.

"SWOOPING across the surface of the alien planet you prepare your ship for battle. Your laser cannon is armed as you look out for strategic targets. A city looms in front of you and the attack is on! In this arcade style game you are piloting an anti-grav air car. It is equipped with a laser and has two speeds attack and super-fast Zype drive. The idea is to cause as much havoc and destruction in the city as you can But you must beware of the deadly super-forcefield gravity traps. You have warning indicators which light up when you approach one of these danger zones. The game requires quick reactions and mental awareness If you want the fuel to last longer just modify the variable \"F\" in lines 1000 and 1980 the greater the value the longer the fuel lasts. As soon as the warning indicators light up alerting you to a danger zone the force-field trap will be placed directly in front of your flier at the bottom of the screen. Only the centre of your craft is affected by the hazards. Although the game is written in easily understandable Basic Mr Firmin says it is quite fast in execution.

"AVOID THE PROJECTILE In this game the player has to avoid a self guiding projectile while attempting to reach home base.

To move your man up and down use the V and N keys, to move left and right use B and M. Another way to alter the difficulty of the game is to change the 4 lines 70-100. BY J.

The program simulates a track with randomly placed obstacles. Unfortunately due to the limited memory nothing happens if the player crashes into one of these, so a mental note should be taken of the number of obstacles hit and an extra five points added at the end for each collision. When you have successfully completed the course the game ends and the time you took to cover the distance is shown. The car accelerates when key six is pressed and is steered by using keys five and eight. \" X,YUS : zzzz XXX THEN LET THEN LET THEN LET HEN LET Y HEN LET X <X<X TI++ BY JEREMY YOUNGMAN QUOA OPO000OOMOA 000000000OOOOOO 66666Â°Â°Â°66609265 P666*016g9g0   KILLLILLLLLL LLLLLLLL LLLLLOL # # OE:: :: 0 1 letou AAVV++ AV11 ::::FHII BEHEEZXFFFFFFCO VA IIZ = ODD-ON LET BES + T NO: 0 HHHHHH OOOOOOOOOoon 00000000 INNO010 EM WRITTEN BY J.S.

"illustration: Dorian Cross Do you enjoy solving mazes? Well, this program will provide a different one each time it is run. Just watch the computer draw out a maze while you try to work out the right path. When the computer is finished drawing put that plan into action and do it quickly as you have to race through the maze against the clock. The program is built on algorithm, which will produce a maze which has one, and only one, path from a cell the little \"rooms which make up the maze to another cell. The algorithm is as follows: 1. Fill the maze with little cells, no one connected to any other. (lines 40-80 in the program) 2. Choose one of them and call it the \"mother cell\" (line 95). It will be the \"present position\". 3. Record cells which aren't connected to any other cell and border on the present position (lines 100-140). 4. If there are no such cells, return to the previous position. If you can't do that, because you're in the mother cell, is the maze ready. (lines 150-160) 5. Choose randomly one of the recorded cells. (line 180) BY MATS OEHRMAN 6.

"FROM TOP TO BOTTOM Some machines require string space to be set aside, by the use of Clear nnnn. This reserves the specified amount of memory for strings and string handling. If you have this feature I suggest you start by clearing about 1500 bytes and adjust by trial and error if you start running out. If your game is approaching the capacity of the machine, you may have to strike quite a fine balance between string space and run-time memory. Some machines allow ranges of variables to be defined at the beginning of the program by a DEFSTR statement. DEFSTRA for example would thereafter cause any variable whose name begins with an A to be a string variable. This saves the memory requirement for the $ sign. Similarly, DEFINT will define a variable range as integer. Dimensioning arrays has already been covered but a word of advice! Make sure the plot of your game is thoroughly detailed before setting hands on the keyboard or you will not only have to keep increasing your array dimensions, you will have to lengthen the loops that scan them and you are BOUND to miss one! I know I always do! Now we can see the shape of the whole program, in the next issue I will start to examine more detailed parts of its logic. GOING UNDERGROUND Those of you who have ventured into the dark forest of Adventure programming and typed \"LOOK AROUND\" probably can't see the wood for the trees by now! So let's have a look at the structure of a complete program. From top to bottom of the program, the following sequence shows how various blocks of code fit together. 1. This block of code lays out the ground for the program to operate in: CLEAR string space. (Allows manipulation of character strings) DEFINE variable types. (string, integer etc.) DIMENSION arrays. 2. This block loads the framework of the plot READ in DATA or directly assign variables â€” or both. 3. Start of program loop. Communicate with the player: Check for special conditions. Clear screen. PRINT display variables. Reset screen variables to null. Await INPUT. 4. Interpret the player's communication with the computer: Decode verb and noun. IF either are invalid singly or in combination set reply and return to block three. ELSE GOTO block five. 5. Execute the plot: This block comprises a number of routines, one to cover each valid verb. Each routine alters game variables and sets reply variables, then returns to block three or goes to block six, for a standard reply. 6. Set standard replies. For example \"IMPOSSIBLE\" \"OK\". 7. DATA statements to be read by block two. Let's have a look at block one in some detail. Don't worry if your computer doesn't have all of these Basic statements but use them if it does! I have been playing Abersoft Adventure supplied by Abersoft of Dyfed, which runs on a Sinclair ZX81 with 16K RAM pack \"Welcome to Adventure\" proclaims a flicker-free screen on typing \"RUN\", and before long we are on the edge of a forest outside a large brick building. Further exploration leads us to a canyon, and eventually to a locked grating. Oh dear -you didn't bring the keys, did you? Never mind I did, so down the grating we go only to find ourselves in an underground world of caverns, low twisting passages, and a vast chamber with an uncrossable fissure. We have collected en route a small bird, a wicker case, and a black rod. Hang about we've done this before haven't we? Yes, for all intents and purposes we could be inside a Pyramid of the Tandy variety. For black rod read sceptre, for small bird read birdstatue and for wicker cage read statue box. Those of us who are well travelled now know how to cross the fissure, find torch batteries etc. What I didn't mention when I received the Tandy game is that Pyramid is itself an abridged and modified version of the original Adventure So for sceptre read wand. Could be useful for there are things you would expect to do with a wand but not necessarily with a sceptre or rod. Although not an original plot, it has certainly survived well! What's it like on a Sinclair? I found it typing apart â€” better than on a Tandy as the screen is cleared rather than scrolled, making it, for me anyway, less confusing. One small criticism is that the inventory is retained when the game is re-run. Consequently you can grab things, quit, and then cheat! Nevertheless, it is pleasing to see full size Adventures in micro termsbeing made available to thousands of Sinclair owners.

"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING GRAPHIC GRAPHS... reasons why this is less satisfactory than using STR$ and LEN, including its lack of obviousness and the practical reason that, due to rounding errors within the BASIC, it may give the wrong answer on numbers close to a power of 10 COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS PRINT statements is to produce columns of numbers, but there are problems when different numbers of digits are involved. For example: 100 FOR I = 1 TO 10 110 PRINT I; I*1; I*I*I 120 NEXT I Many home computers have a will give the result shown in sophisticated set of graphics table one, while replacing the commands, and various dialects semicolons with commas gives of BASIC provide features for the the slightly better, but still format of output, including cur unsatisfactory table two. sor control characters and such We can use the TAB function to commands as PRINT USING, print the columns with the numPRINT AT, etc. However, it is bers right-justified; we need possible to do a great deal with TAB(N) for one-digit numbers, only the standard formatting fea TAB(N-1) for two-digit numbers, tures of comma and semicolon TAB(N-2) for three-digit numfollowing the PRINT statement, bers, etc. i.e., we need TAB(N+1 and the TAB function. number of digits), which Using the TAB function it is leaves only the problem of find possible to draw low resolution ing the number of digits in each graphs; for example: number to be printed. There is no 100 FOR X = -1 TO 1 STEP simple way to do this, but the 1/10 method I prefer is the following: 110 LET Y = X*X 10 LET X = number to be 120 PRINT TAB (Y*40);\"*\" printed 130 NEXT X 20 LET X$ = STR$(X) will give a graph of the 30 LET D = LEN(X$) function Y =Xfrom X = -1 to 40 PRINT TAB(N+1-D); X X=1; while i.e. convert the number to a 100 FOR X = 0 TO 2 STEP string and then find the length of 1/10 the string. The various opera110 LET Y = X tions can be combined into a single statement, PRINT 130 PRINT TAB (Y*5);\"*\" 130 NEXT X TAB(N+1-LEN(STR$(X))); X will give a graph of the function Y=X* from X=0 to X=2 The reason for using Y* 40 and Y*5 is to provide a suitable scale for the graphs. The argument of the TAB function is required to be not greater than the number of columns on the screen; since X? <=1 when X is between-1 and 1, and X <=8 One point that you need to when X is between 0 and 2, these watch when using STR$ is the values allow us to use the full format of the resulting string. width of a 40 column screen.

There are several BY TED BALL STRINGS AND THINGS. A more complicated problem involving columns of numbers arises when we have amounts of money in pounds and pence which have to be printed with exactly two digits after the decimal point; e.g., .30 rather than .3 or .00 rather than . If the amounts are calculated by a method which does not necessarily produce an exact number of pence the answers must first be rounded. The standard method for rounding to two decimal places is: X = INT(100*X +.5)/100 (rounding to the nearest penny) or X = INT(100*X)/100 (rounding to the lower penny) When we have the answer correct to two decimal places we cannot simply print it using one of the methods above, as trailing zeroes after the decimal point will not be printed by BASIC, and the decimal point will not be printed if the answer is an integer. To get around this we have to do a great deal of manipulation, separating pounds and pence, converting to strings, removing leading spaces put in by STR$, making sure that there is always two digits in the pence, and finally putting everything back together. 100 LET X = amount in pounds, to 2 decimal places 110 REM SEPARATE X INTO L POUNDS AND PENCE 120 LET L = INT(X) 130 LET P = 100 *(X-L) 140 REM CONVERT FROM NUMERIC TO STRING VARIABLES 150 LET L$ = STR$(L) 160 LET P$ = STR$(P) 170 REM DELETE LEADING \" * "

Table 2 VOWN 125 216 343 343 In order to be sure that we get the right answer we must add a small fraction to the computer's answer, for example, when rounding an amount of money to the lower penny, if we use: LET X = INT(100 *X)/100 due to binary decimal conversion, 100*X may be 2-24 or 2-92 less than an integer and INT(100 *X) would be one less than the correct amount.

Many of the numbers we deal with are approximate, particularly numbers obtained by measurement, and we often have to round answers to a specified number of decimal places or a specified number of significant figures. There is a simple method for rounding to any specified number of decimal places, as described above for the case of two decimal places, and the same method can also be used to round to any required degree of accuracy. However, when using the INT function we must always watch out for differences between the decimal number that the computer prints on the screen and the binary number which is held internally and used in calculations. Just as some fractions do not have a decimal representation in a finite number of digits, we also find that some fractions cannot be represented in binary with a finite number of digits. Thus 1/3 as a decimal is .3333 ... repeated to infinity, and as a binary fraction is .010101... The problem with INT arises when we have a fraction that has a finite decimal representation but an infinite binary representation. For example, 1/5 can be exactly represented in decimal as 0.2, but in binary is .00110011.... If we ask the computer to PRINT 5*(1/5) the ans| introduced by binary/decimal conversion, although adding .0001 may sometimes introduce an error in the opposite direction. A similar problem arises when making tests for equality. As in the example above, we may find that a number printed out as an integer is actually held internally as a fraction differing by a small amount from an integer. The test IF X = 1 THEN... may give the wrong result although PRINT X would give the answer 1. This can be allowed for by testing for the two numbers being close together rather than for them being equal, so we should write instead IF ABS(X-1) <1E-6 THEN... "


"Graphic 22 ADVENTURE IN VIEW FIGURE Creators of Adventure games have yet to tap the full potential of graphics. They can be used to model terrains which could be a big advantage in such games. The terrain can provide opportunities for ambush and give a clear advantage to characters occupying the heights. In general, graphics can provide many tactical possibilities. An important use of graphics has always been to present information in such a way that it can be easily understood. In this article we are going to start with a table of numerical data, and examine various ways of presenting this information graphically. Tabulated data of this kind arises in many problems and applications, and the graphical techniques that are illustrated here are widely applicable. For this reason, although a specific problem and some of the possible ways of presenting its solution are described, the ideas that are put forward should be of general interest and use. The following table gives the heights measured at each cross-point of a rectangular grid covering a particular site. can be presented in the way shown in figure one by drawing a curve using the data in each row of the table. Each curve gives a different cross-section of the surveyed region. This presentation is rather cluttered and does not really help one to visualise the appearance of the site. Figure two shows the information presented as a contour map. This is a rather better presentation. It could be enhanced by using colours to shade the regions between contours as is done in the maps in an atlas. However, it still does not give a visual impression of the appearance of the region. Its effectiveness depends almost entirely on whether the observer is familiar with the idea of a contour map. A three-dimensional perspective view of the surface is given in figure three, and at last we have a visual presentation that makes it easy to interpret the data. The appearance of the \"wireframe\" model is improved considerably because the hidden lines are removed from the drawing. Incidentally, you might like to determine the position of the vantage point from which the terrain is viewed in this figure. The three-dimensional contour COLUMN 5 ROW 1.0 0.8 1.5 2.8 2.1 os 0.6 1.6 3.4 5.8 0.4 1.9 CONS 3.3 3.5 3.8 9.2 5.3 0.2 1.0 2.6 6.3 4.5 4.9 5.5 3.9 5.5 4.6 DO 8.2 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 5.3 6.1 6.2. 6.0 4.6 5.9 6.8 6.4 5.7 6.2 6.6 5.8 6.2 5.6 The data could have come from an official survey or from mea. surements made in my garden. They could be used to model the terrain that was surveyed, but the data could equally well be used to provide the field of operations for an Adventure game. The information in the table map of the region shown in figure four also provides a good visual impression of the surface of the region. An ideal presentation of the data might consist of a combination of methods. Using both a three-dimensional perspective and a contour map, the details that are not apparent because of hidden line removal in the 3D presentation can be deduced from the contour map. Alternatively, a series of threedimensional perspective from different viewpoints may prove to be most useful. By Gary Marshall "

"PayTUC already big business in the U.S. and look ripe to take off over here. Terry Pratt reports The name of Ragnar the pirate and his star troopers must now be feared in this sector of the galaxy. Nine enemy worlds have I plundered in the last parsec-four of these for the first time. The invasion of Sirain s empire is going strongly. She puts up so little resistance that I will pull out half of the attacking force to plan an assault elsewhere. My tame merchant Epplan is transferring materials as fast as his fleet can and I know he needs the business so he is no threat for the moment. Chaos the Berserker and his many robots have proved faithful allies throughout the game ... which makes them a perfect target! And as Chaos must be thinking the same, I'll attack him now. And I wonder who ambushed those two explorer ships I sent out...? The late night caller identifies himself: \"This is Space Pirate Tharg. Unless you start delivering raw materials to me as from the next turn I'm going to plunder your home world.\" He hangs up abruptly, leaving you to wonder; Can Tharg really be serious? How does he expect me to react? Was it even Tharg at all? Hard to imagine a computer being involved in this kind of duplicity but this is an example of the kind of play you have to guard against in the still rela tively undiscovered field of computer moderated gaming. The best established of these games is Starweb, run in the U.K. by Chris Harvey, who has a host of horror stories similar to the above: of murderous berserkers claiming to be merchants to dupe the unwary; of players tricked into forfeiting their next turn; and attackers who, in midonslaught, realise they have been fed the wrong map information. Anything goes and you have to be prepared to face opponents who will stop just this side of the law-of-the-land to achieve their ends. Threats, broken alliances, libel, lies and downright sneakiness, form the fabric of these games, some of which consider 18 months a good life span-others go on indefinitely. A computer program is used to map out a world, galaxy or even universe and the rules and aims of its races and inhabitants. The game is then peopled by players, who take charge of tribes, nations or whole solar systems and then plan their campaigns for mastery. Starweb, via the U.S. firm, Flying Buffalo, is a good example. Players choose a racial type for themselves. There are six: Pirates, Berserkers, Empire Builders, Merchants, Artifact Collectors, and Apostles. Each type has his own special powers, aims and victory conditions. As he fulfills these conditions, he is awarded points. Enough players to achieve a good game (between 10 and 15) strive for a points total chosen by averaging out each player's suggested winning total. Apostles try to convert worlds, Empire Builders attempt to own worlds, Berserkers aim to destroy life, Pirates seek to plunder planets, while the popular Merchants ship much-needed raw materials and Artifact Collectors hope to gather rarities. It's a combination of characters which ensures plenty of rivalry and conflict but also demands interaction, reliance on other players and usually results in some unholy alliances. The player is placed on his home worlds, given ships and forces as befits his role and embarks on his quest by sending off a letter detailing his orders. In the case of Starweb these are sent to an old mainframe computer-a Raytheon â€” in America to be processed and then returned with a printout of how the universe is developing before each player's eyes. What his exploration ships have discovered and whether any contacts have been made. Turnaround is four weeks. Other races players are usually contacted around turn three and then the \"diploming\" side of the game begins, with a player sending off a card to whoever ambushed his small fleet on the outer edges of his realm. This card will usually include a phone number and suggest a meeting of minds. Swopping any information with fellow players helps to increase your understanding of the universe. The game scores over more orthodox wargames, firstly because fellow enthusiasts are found for you and secondly, because there is a greater sense of realism. You can't see your opponent secretly massing his forces on your border and you don't know what is lurking beyond what you have explored. You only have a player's word about his strength, race characteristics and intentions so just how far do you trust a space pirate? According to enthusiast Kim Bailey, honesty is the best policy because those who lie are usually caught out and never trusted again. 70 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"WHOD TAKE THE WORD OF A SPACE PIRATE? Diploming is the most important part of the game. Being able to persuade others that it is in their interests to do what you want them to is the mark of a good player. Occasionally you come across a player who will not talk and these, according to top player Bob Brown are the first to go: \"They are an unknown quantity and that alone forces you to attack them.\" It is difficult to estimate how many Starweb players there are in the U.K. as many play several games at once but it is in the region of 250+. The U.K. end is run from P.O. Box 100, Bath Street, Walsall, West Midlands. Starweb costs .50 per turn. Other Flying Buffalo games which have a following over here are: Nuclear Destruction, 50p; Battle Plan .00; and Space Battle, from 75p. The only all-British game is Mike Singleton's Starlord which he wrote on his 32K Pet and began running in April 1981. It now has 300 players and allows up to 50 to compete in each game. This game is designed to run indefinitely. Players aim to become Starlord Emperor and take their seat in the Throne Star at the centre of the Galaxy. The reward for this is free turns while Emperor, a complete printout map of the Empyr which stretches across a whole galaxy and control of any surviving Empyr garrisons. Players start with a command ship, a base star and a fleet of 50 starships. The command ship has no fighting power but is a communications centre and the player's control is limited to seven astrals around this ship. All the stars have a name and there are 14 types in this galaxy including: signal stars, for galactic news: power stars, for fuel; gate and exit stars, for space jumps; city stars; battle stars and fort stars. Battles are resolved by the computer, comparing each commander's battle orders, retreat threshold and ratio of forces on either side. Starlord boasts a two weekly turnaround and costs .25 per turn. But the real measure of its success, is that America, the real home of this form of gaming, is keen to import Starlord under licence. Mike Singleton claims proudly: \"We are negotiating with three American firms. It's a bit like selling coals to Newcastle.\" Mike is at 1 Rake Hey Close, Moreton, Wirrall, Merseyside. Tribes of Crane is a computer assisted game with record storage and word processing performed by computer. This is set on the fantasy world of Crane and features the warring tribes of that nation. Players take the part of a chief of one of the wandering tribes and their aim is to lead their people to dominance over the neighbouring tribes. Each tribe has its own way of measuring prosperity and so obtain points. The game runs indefinitely and can be entered at any time and the fantasy world has a complete range of geography, ranging from desert to polar ice, with mountains, rivers and forests. Cities also form part of the world of Crane and act as centres of trade and homes for the land's powerful lords and shamans. Among the creatures you are likely to run into are: caribou, cattle goats, warhawks and huge bipedal lizards. The game is run in the U.K. by Mark Blundell and costs .50 for the first four turns. The price includes a rule book players have to pay .50 per turn after that. Mark Blundell has two new games planned: Gladiator is one he wrote himself and Starmaster is a popular U.S. game. Both will be started this year. Write to him at Lothlorien, Stockdale, Hee lands, Bucks. Perhaps the best recommendation for computer moderated gaming is the players themselves. The four I telephoned came from very different parts of the country but with one exception they all either knew or had heard of one another by reputation. A very good way of contacting fellow games enthusiasts. ..

You will find yourself having to repeat groups of instructions at several points in your program. These groups of instructions may be identical or very similar. Another problem is that the increase in the length of your programs makes it more difficult for you to keep track of what is going on in your program. The unfortunate consequences of this are that you will tend to make more mistakes in developing and typing in the program, and that the errors will be more difficult to track down. The use of SUBROUTINES can help alleviate both these problems. BASIC contains the facility whereby a sequence of instructions which is to be executed at several points in a program need BY MOIRA NORRIE 72 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES to that of the GOTO statement. The operation of the GOSUB statement is in fact similar to that of the GOTO statement in that control will be transferred to the statement specified. In the above example, control will be transferred to statement 400. However, with the GOSUB statement, a note is made of the current statement number before the specified jump takes place. It is then possible to return after the subroutine has been executed. With the GOTO statement, there is no record of where you jumped from. In BASIC, a subroutine is actually no different from any other group of statements in a program except that there will be a RETURN statement at the end of the group. It is when this RETURN statement is encountered that the computer transfers to where the previous jump occurred. The RETURN statement takes the form <statement no. > RETURN for example only be written once. These instructions form a subroutine. Each time the subroutine is to be executed it may be entered by means of a GOSUB statement. The general form of a GOSUB statement is <statement no. > GOSUB statement> for example: 20 GOSUB 400 As you can see, the form of the GOSUB statement is very similar "


"DOWN TO BASIC 450 RETURN After the return is made, the statement after the GOSUB statement will be executed. Usually, subroutines are included at the end of a BASIC program. A program containing one subroutine could therefore take the general form the need for comments in your program before. It is vital when using subroutines that, at the very least, you include a comment at the beginning of the subroutine. In line 100 of the program there is a STOP statement. This causes the execution of the program to be stopped when it is reached. It is possible to have a number of STOP statements at various points in a program providing alternative stopping points. 888888 and through the subroutine. As a general rule, there should always be either a STOP statement or a GOTO statement immediately before a subroutine. Subroutines are also used to split a program into logical sections where each section can be developed and tested as a single unit. Ideally each logical section should be no longer than a page in length so that they remain easy to read and understand. This may be achieved by further dividing large subroutines into logical sections some of which will themselves be subroutines. In this way, you can have nesting of subroutines. 40 GOSUB 400 70 GOSUB 400 80 SUBROUTINES AND LOGIC 90 100 STOP 110 REM 400 REM*** 410 REM SUBROUTINE 420 REM 430 440 450 RETURN 460 REM******* 470 END NEXT MONTH In a program, it is often necessary to process a list of related data items e.g. a list of individual golf scores. Next month, 1 will show you how to set up such a list and then process it. The microcomputer system to be covered is the Commodore PET. THE NEED FOR COMMENTS.. NEXT MONTH The reason for the inclusion of a STOP statement in line 100 of the above example, is to prevent the computer automatically proceeding sequentially from statement 90 to statement 400 Two main points arise from the above example. As stated previously, the only factors that distinguish a subroutine from any other section of code is that it has a RETURN statement at the end, and it has corresponding GOSUB statements. There is nothing in the mechanism for setting them up that clearly indicates the beginning of a subroutine and the task it performs. I have emphasised VUOMI PORTO COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 73 "

"SCREWDRIVERS AND SPANNERS S alli ko It would be nice, I keep telling myself, if I could carry on me every single piece of electronic equipment I was ever going to need. I tried once but my pockets split. Now all I carry around is a small neon screwdriver and a penknife, with which I can get most pieces of domestic equipment installed or temporarily repaired. Of course, for construction, as well as for the majority of repair jobs you will need quite a few more pieces of equipment and these I will cover here. Before I start there are a number of important points to remember. The first, which is a rule of thumb I always employ, is to buy the best you can afford. Secondly, and almost as important, don't waste money buying something you will not use or which you could do without. The last point is to find out which model is right for you by reading through the catalogues and trying out the equipment in the shops. This especially applies to soldering irons. Now, down to the tools. I will start, as I have just mentioned them, with soldering irons. There are two main types â€” uncontrolled mains heated and temperature controlled, either mains or low voltage AC or DC. Whichever one you get you will be able to undertake the same work. Buy an iron with interchangeable bits, and get a spare one to go with it. You should have one small one to 2mm and one medium 2 to 4mm. The names to look out for are: Adcola, Antex, Erasa, Oryx, and Weller for mains uncontrolled and add Ungar to the list for controlled irons. Prices range from .50 to .00 for mains and from  to  for controlled. An iron should last a lifetime, only the bits need be changed. You can't really go wrong with solder, but having said that do not buy acid flux type. Use 60/40, tin/lead in 22swg, which is generally available. To unsolder use desoldering braid. It is easier and cheaper than a solder sucker. I have found Multicore Solder Wick to be the best although there are other makers such as Spirig and WIK-IT. The worst, without a doubt, is the one made by RS Components. Next on the list are pliers and cutters. These can be bought separately or as a set. Either way will do. Find the ones which suit you best by trying them out. The pliers should be pointed nose with either plain or serrated jaws. The cutters ought to be lightweight, either side or diagonal cutting for the best results. Manufacturers include Arhoso, Barco, CK, EPE Corporation, Erim, Lindstrom Proto, Wilkinson and Xcelite. The prices range from  to  for pliers and from  to  for cutters. For cutting heavier guage wire and pins I suggest a purpose built cutter and stripper as the light cutters can easily be damaged on the harder materials. Prices range from .50 to .00 and most are usually good value, and most of the makers of pliers and cutters produce these. It is most important to buy the best when it comes to screwdrivers. Sets are too expensive and usually contain too many sizes. Changeable blades are a waste of time in my opinion, if you are using different heads and screw sizes. For slotted screws you will only need four sizes at the 3, 4, 5, 6.5mm marks. All should have 8-12cm long blades. When it comes to the crossheads it is important to match the head with the driver. There are two main types Phillips and Pozidriv. Pozidriv now have Supadriv, but the difference is only cosmetic. If you use screws in your work please make sure that they are Pozidriv, as they are much more reliable than Phillips. Two sizes will do for each type and it is best to make the smaller ones nice and small to fit the recessed screws. There are too many names to mention so shop around. Individual prices below l are good value. Allen keys, which are really hexagonal keys, are also very handy and come in very reasonably priced sets. It is worthwhile getting both Imperial and Metric. Small spanners are very useful for tightening up nuts as the use of pliers is not to be encouraged. Again, there is no standard and in fact this time there is a choice of three: Imperial, American and Metric. The common Imperial sizes are 4 and 6BA, 2 and 8BA only occasionally being used. The American sizes are \"AF, VAAF and 56\"AF. All are commonly used. The Metric nuts come in M2.5, M3, M4, and M5. Again the middle two are most common. The safest method of purchase is to get an adjustable spanner. There are several types of spanner, the most common being the open ended. Nut drivers are handy but pricey, as are ring spanners. However, do not make do with the wrong sizes. As with crosshead screws you will only damage both tool and component. Some spanner makers are: Bedford, Bahco, Eclipse, Elora, Footprint, and King Dick. Prices extend over a great range, from 50p to  for nut drivers and shifting spanners. Value for money comes at about midrange. If you are going to expand your construction projects you will undoubtedly need a comprehensive set of tools. BY KEITH MOTI "


"Make the most of your Sinclair ZX Computer... Sinclair ZX software on cassette. .95 per cassette. SOFTWARE GAMES SOFTWARE ZXB/ The unprecedented popularity of the ZX Series of Sinclair Personal Computers has generated a large volume of programs written by users. Sinclair has undertaken to publish the most elegant of these on pre-recorded cassettes. Each program is carefully vetted for interest and quality, and then grouped with other programs to form a single-subject cassette. Each cassette costs .95 (including VAT and p&p) and comes complete with full instructions. Although primarily designed for the Sinclair ZX81, many of the cassettes are suitable for running on a Sinclair ZX80-if fitted with a replacement 8K BASIC ROM. Some of the more elaborate programs can be run only on a Sinclair ZX Personal Computer augmented by a 16K-byte add-on RAM pack. This RAM pack and the replacement ROM are described below. And the description of each cassette makes it clear what hardware is required. 8K BASIC ROM The 8K BASIC ROM used in the ZX81 is available to ZX80 owners as a drop-in replacement chip.

A squadron of deadly falcons fly in battle formation above your defence base on a lonely planet It's up to you to shoot down the birds of prey before they swoop down and grab you with their razor-sharp claws. If you manage to survive the birds the game moves onto the second phase. This time the falcons appear on the screen in a diagonal formation, still suddenly swooping down at you. More of them move out of their formation to take up alternative attacking positions. The ordinary falcons will earn you 100 points, but are worth 300 if you blast them as they swoop at you. Beware of the falcons which reach your base level. They walk along the bottom of the screen. Into the third phase your life gets really dangerous. The falcons have laid eggs, and these tiny blue dots invade the screen snaking their way towards you, all the time getting bigger and bigger. It's vital to shoot them down while they are in their early stage of development because if you don't they grow into huge green creatures capable of the most horrific destruction. They are worth 200 points. When I played it, I was unable to come out of this stage of the game alive. But if you do manage it the fourth stage brings a mother ship on to the screen which can be worth up to 9000 points This is the most hazardous phase of all as the ship opens up a hatch and drops scores of baby falcons on top of you. One advantage the player has is a protective shield. This only lasts for four seconds and will not operate again for another five seconds. To fire your laser beam press the 0 key on the keyboard, the 1 key to activate the protective shield. A joystick or the arrow keys are used to move your base ship.

Take cover! It's the four minute warning! Which is about the length of time one needs to get used to working the controls in this game of Missile Attack. This game is a very fast machine-code program of the well-known arcade game Missile Command. The object is to protect your cities and missile bases from the onslaught of countless enemy missiles. This is attempted by firing your own missiles to intercept the enemy rockets prior to them making a successful strike. Each of your bases to start with has a total of nine missiles. The graphics, while fast, leave quite a lot to be desired. The movement of the tracks of missiles across the screen is accomplished in a weird eye-wrenching zig-zag fashion which detracts greatly from concentration. Also, the use of the numeric keypad to control the movements of the Cursor by using the figures 7, 8, 9,4,6, 1, 2 and 3-is laborious and time-consuming. Much time and many games can be lost just by glancing down to try to discover which key you have been operating which successfully lost you your last city and two of your bases. Missiles are launched by using the keys Z, X and C and once again, valuable time can be lost by glancing down to verify which one is being pushed. Maybe the answer is the introduction of a single joystick control â€” because it certainly doesn't work well using the keys referred to above. The game itself is similar in all respects to the arcade Missile Command, and apart from the \"wobbles\" and the lack of full control, it plays quite well and fast. The page of instructions is not held on the screen for long enough for the average reader to assimulate full details of the operating system. This blips up for a grand total of four seconds, and as a consequence of this, it does take a while to work out which keys are supposed to operate which function of the game. There are no written instructions provided. Also the quality of the leaflet that came with the game is very poor. For the sum of .95 it is not good value and I'm rather surprised that the price exceeds the .50 I expected. On second thoughts I think I'd prefer to continue visiting my local arcade! On the whole it's a game which would only maintain a slight interest, you might even play it twice then shove it away and forget about it until you can overcome the cumbersome controls. It runs on a Pet, from Softprint, in New Malden. Authors: lan Stewart & Robin Jones The reader-friendly guide to getting started with the Sinclair ZX81.

"HARDI ONE TOUCH WORDS The Sinclair is based around a 280 microprocessor, and for your money you will initially receive a startlingly small, light, box with a \"Qwerty\" keyboard on it, a power pack, leads for a television and cassette recorder and one of the best written Basic manuals for beginners to get to grips with The Sinclair Basic is very close to the Microsoft variety but does without such well-used command words as READ and DATA. It also has the time-saving notion of one-touch key words which come up on the screen when you need them. An example is to touch the \"P\" on the keyboard after a program line number, then PRINT will appear on the screen, already spaced for you. Beginners will find this confusing initially but with usage it becomes automatic. In the spring of 1980, home computing was lifted out of the realms of the expensive hobbyist market and offered to a receptive public. The Sinclair ZX80 was the reason and it was superceded the following year by the ZX81 model. Love or hate these machines, they were instrumental in putting computers at the fingertips of the public at a price they could afford -and utilising such house-hold items as a T.V. set and a cassette recorder. Among the 81's limitations were a difficult to operate, touch-sensitive keyboard, crude graphics and it was launched with only 1K of memory and no printer facilities ... it still sold 50,000 in the first three months and Sinclair ownership has now risen to 150,000 in the U.K. and 260,000 worldwide. The printing and memory deficiencies were made up towards the latter end of last year and many other firms realised the potential for producing Sinclair peripherals and software. These names and addresses, are laid out below if an address is missing it will be included elsewhere. The ZX81 in kit form costs .95 and .95 assembled. It is built by Sinclair Research of 6 Kings Parade, Cambridge CB2 1SN MEMORY APLENTY Memory capacity for the ZX81 is expanding and prices are coming down. Memotech now offers a 64K RAM pack for . Details can be obtained from the company at 103 Walton Street, Oxford, OX2 6EB. A variety of 16K RAM packs are available. JRS Software produces one at . D K'tronics sells a ready built pack for .95, and a kit for .95. It also produces a 2K pack at .95 and a 4K pack for .95. Other firms which offer memory expansion packs include Byg Byte of 28, The Spain Petersfield, Hants, 16K for .95. And Audio Computers of 87, Bournemouth Park Road, Southend-on-Sea, Essex does a 16K for ; 32K for ; 64K for  and 128K for . Sinclair Research's 16K RAM pack costs .95. The ZX81's membrane keyboard has proved a problem for some users. There are now several typewriter-style keyboards available. Fuller Micro Systems produce a keyboard which comes ready-built and costs .95. The ZX81 fits neatly inside the case, as does the power supply and memory boards with no leads hanging about outside. Details from Fuller Micro Systems, The ZX Centre, Sweeting Street, Liverpool. DK 'tronics also produces a keyboard, at .95. Redditch Electronics produces a keyboard in kit form for .50. A keyboard connector is optional and costs a further .95. D K Computer Keyboards produces a keyboard, at .95. Voice recognition and music are possible on the ZX81. William Stuart Systems produces a speech recognition system for the ZX81 called Big Ears. It allows speech input through a microphone provided with the system, and costs . It also produces a music synthesiser which can be used to put out sound effects and music. Through its input and output lines the ZX81 can monitor a home security system and control a robot arm. Details can be obtained from William Stuart Systems Ltd., Dower House, Billericay Road, Herongate, Brentwood, Essex, CM133SD. The 50-character-per-second printer developed by Sinclair for the ZX81 allows the user to have hard copy of program listings or of program output. It costs .95 It is useful to have a holder for the ZX81 and its peripherals, to contain all those loose wires. Various units are available including the ZX81 Workstation, a specially-moulded tray from Peter Furlong Products, 125 Catford Hill, London, SE6 4PR. If you prefer a wooden workstation, try ZX Business Systems'  console. The address is 14 Brookfield Garden, Ryde, Isle of Wight Many of the firms are small, one-man outfits which operate on a mail order basis. Prices for software range from  to  and the more you pay the better the quality tends to be. The main firms involved in software production are: Bug Byte, 98-100 The Albany, Old Hall Street, Liverpool L3 9EP. This firm has about a dozen games on its books including versions of most of the popular arcade games like asteroids, space invaders as well as an adventure game. It also supplies a multi-purpose filing program, a machine code program, and a disassembler/debugging program. Artic Computing, 396 James Reckitt Avenue, Hull HUS OJA has a trio of adventure games for the ZX81 with 16K. Premier Publications, 12 Kingscote Road, Addiscombe, Croydon, is a games supplier offering a wide range of generally good quality. The prices start at just under .

There is no shortage of software for the ZX81 from independent suppliers. Many firms have set up producing both business and games for the machine but the standard of some of these is very poor. Sinclair Research itself sells four tapes of programs which users have submitted to the firm. Included in the range is a tape containing six games, Orbit, Sniper, Meteors, Life, Wolf Pack and Golf. There is a junior education tape, and a business and household management tape. You can buy the tapes mail order from Cambridge based Sinclair for .95 each. A GAMES PLAYER'S GUIDE "


"CORE JRS Software, 19 Wayside Avenue, Worthing, Sussex; Video Software, Stone Lane, Kinver, Stourbridge, West Midlands and Richard Shepherd Software, 22, Green Leys, Maidenhead, Berks. 146 Oxford Street, London, W1; Mine of Information, 1 Francis Avenue, St Albans, Hertfordshire; Sinclair Research, 6 Kings Parade, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire CB2 1SN A USER'S STORY GRAPHICS JAM What's the user's view of the ZX81? Well! To set up the computer it is much like any other, fairly easy if you read the manual. It is when you come to type in a program that the trouble starts. The membrane keyboard is difficult to get along with, especially if you are used to a regular keyboard. Most people I have talked to heartily dislike it as well. I found the keyword system slow and awkward to use at first. If you are new to computing don't bother to use the manual that comes with the unit. I found it easier to grasp the basic principles using a book like the ZX81 Basic Book A lot has been said about loading problems, but I have not encountered very many. For the record, I use a Ferguson 3T15 portable cassette player. All sorts of hard and software is becoming available for the ZX81 and it must be said that some of it is of dubious quality. Buy software carefully, read the reviews published in this and other magazines. This year will see a multitude of peripherals for the ZX81. Sinclair's own printer has just become available and various bits and pieces are coming on the market monthly. Joysticks, memory packs, sound boards and desk units. I would recommend that you join a group of local users if there is a club in your area. The interchange of ideas is invaluable. Another source of advice, programs and reviews is the National ZX81 Users Club. For details send an S.A.E. to 44-46 Earls Court Road, London W8 6EJ. The ZX81 represents good value for money. Sinclair's product support does leave a lot to be desired especially if you mail order. Order lead times are quite long. Getting acquainted with your ZX81 by Tim Hartnell. It contains 80 programs for the unexpanded 1K ZX81 and is available in three editions. Numbers two and three cost .95 and .95 respectively from the ZX81 user club's magazine Interface by mail order. The address is 44-46 Earls Court Road, London W8 6EJ. And 49 Explosive Games for the ZX81 by Hartnell costs .25 and contains listings to program into your, Sinclair. Stretching Your ZX81 to its Limits by Trevor Sharples and Hartnell is available from Computer Publications, Unit 3, 33 Woodthorpe Road, Ashford, Middx. It costs .95. Mastering Machine Code On Your ZX80 is by Tony Baker and it costs .95. So is the Gateway Guide to the ZX81 and ZX80 by Mark Charlton for .95. 34 Amazing Games for the 1K ZX81 by Alistair Gourlay is priced at .95. All are obtainable from Interface. The ZX81 Basic Book by Robin Norman is from Newnes Microcomputer Books and the price is .95. He has also written a similar book for the older machine called Learning Basic With Your Sinclair ZX80, costing .95. Peek, Poke, Byte and RAM is about Basic programming and includes information on graphics, setting up the hardware, logic, looping and branching, character manipulation, subroutines and debugging. It is by lan Stewart and Robin Jones and costs .95 from Shira Publishing of 4 Church Lane, Nantwich, Cheshire CW5 5RQ. Byteing Deeper into Your ZX81 by Mark Harrison gives programming tips and 37 programs to try out your newly acquired skills. Sigma Technical Press is the publisher at 5 Alton Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire. The price .95. The ZX81 Pocket Book deals with machine code, decimal justification, and playing adventure games as well as giving hints and tips to get the most out of your computer. Phipps Associates at 99 East Street, Epsom, Surrey publishes this book by Trevor Toms and sells it for .95. Books from Kuma Computers of 11 York Road, Maidenhead, Berkshire are: Understanding Your ZX81 ROM by Dr Ian Logan costing .95. The ZX81 Companion for .95. The Sinclair ZX81 Programming for Real Applications by Randle Hurley at .95. Hints and Tips for the ZX81 by Andrew Hewson priced at .25. Machine Language Made Simple for .95 and Not Only 30 Programs for the ZX81 at .95 but also 50 Rip Roaring Games for the ZX80/81 for .95. Finally Making the Most of Your ZX80 by Tim Hartnell is obtainable through Interface and the following shops: Timedata, 37 Swallowdale, Basildon, Essex; Foyles Bookshop, Charing Cross Road, London WC2; Syntax Software, 96 Collinwood Gardens, Ilford, Essex; The Software House, The ZX81's graphics capability is very limited. In fact there are 20 graphics characters, and an inverse space, to play with. Although it has flicker free graphics the ZX81 is not viable for programming complex graphics displays in Basic. It is possible, but it takes up an awful lot of memory and makes animated graphics displays move sluggishly and jerkily. Machine code is the other possibility, but not a good alternative for Basic for the beginner. There are several add-ons for the ZX81 that allow use of programmable and hiresolution graphics. Quicksilva produce a programmable character generator at .00. It allows the user to program lower case letters, scientific notation, and space invader-type meanies to name just a few. The character generator comes with a demonstration cassette of fast machine code routines. Quicksilva also produce a hi-resolution graphics board, at . This enables the user to produce very detailed screen displays, such as maps and almost perfect sine waves, with a high degree of accuracy. Details of both these products can be obtained from Quicksilva, 95 Upper Brownhill Road, Maybush, Southampton, Hants. DK 'tronics produces a graphic ROM board at .95. This can be attached to the ZX81 by three solder connections. It allows the use of lowercase characters and also a variety of games orientated graphics characters. Anyone who has tried playing a dexterity game on the ZX81 keyboard, will realise the value of joysticks. These are available from Micro Gen, Dept. VG, 24 Agar Crescent, Bracknell, Berks, at .60 each. Light pens are useful when using menu driven programs. They make the selection of items on the screen easier, without having to use the keyboard to input replies. RD Laboratories produces the \"Doodler\" at .50. Details from RD Laboratories, (Dept. Y), 5 Kennedy Road, Dane End, Ware, Herts, SG12 OLU. For users who have difficulty with loading, the Abacus Controller should provide a remedy. At  the controller switches from SAVE to LOAD by turning just one switch. Details from Abacus Electronics, 186 St. Helens Avenue, Swansea, West Glam. Finally a colour programmable character generator will soon be available from Fountain Computers of Dorbill Road, Rockley, Alresford, Hants. As we went to press it was still under development and a price had yet to be fixed. But for around  it will let you program any character or pixel in colour. WEALTH OF BOOKS A wealth of books are now on sale to help you glean every piece of information about your Sinclair machine. Many of them cover the same subjects, like programming your ZX81, machine lanquage and the use of subroutines, but treat the topic in varying ways. We have included a selection with comments. The Explorer's Guide to the ZX81 by Mike Lord of software house, Timedata. It covers programming aids, lists some games, applications, machine language and goes over the hardware side and expansion. It costs .95 from Timedata, 57 Swallowdale, Basildon, Essex. It claims to carry on where the Sinclair manual leaves off. And for .75, Timedata sells the ZX81 Magic Book. DE TO THE SINCLAIR ZX81 "
