"CVG ED'S COMMENT CHANGING WITH THE TIMES 6 B SEGA Daytona USA The most spectacular driving game in history will be the first game for the Sega Saturn and we've got it before anyone else! See page 32! elcome to the fantastic 150th issue of Computer & Video Games. Having been involved on the mag for the best part of six years I've seen some changes, not only to CVG but also to the games themselves, and now is a very important time in the games industry because we're heading for more major changes, with the introduction of all-new machines. That's why we're continuing to make Computer and Video Games the magazine that will bring you all the info on the new systems and games as they happen. That's the reason why we've given CVG a complete overhaul, and if PAGE 54: Twisted This is A TRULY original game, you have a quick flick and the best use we've seen made of interactive CD technology the first stunning game on 3DO. through this issue you'll It's our aim to review every single game see that not only has the released what ordinary mag can do that? design of each page been Features-wise we've got lots of great new ideas: altered to make it much buying your own coin-op, for very little cost (P46), plus the games developers REALLY want to make (P20). simpler to find the information you're looking for, but also that there's a whole lot more inside. We're not only reviewing more games than any other magazine, but our reviews make accurate comparisons and aren't just written from just one, biased perspective. Features have been expanded to give you a better understanding of what's happening in the ever-changing games market which is more important now than it's ever been with over half-adozen new games systems appearing during the next 12 months. The tips section has been overhauled now we give you the opportunity to ask us for the cheats which you need, as opposed to just printing a list of general hints which may be of no use to you whatsoever. Anyway, that's enough from me. Enjoy the new-look CVG, tell us what you think, and happy gaming. RAND OUR REVIEWS POLICY Here at CVG we're independent of any hardware manufacturer, so we'll let you know whether a game is available on other formats, whether there are better examples of the game on that system, and most impor. tantly whether it's any good. Unlike other maga zines which base their scores on the views of one person, our ratings are arrived at after lengthy discussion between the CVG team about each title's good or bad points, with the overall score being a separate mark based on the quality of the game NOT an average of the other marks. For the sake of those who want to refer to back issues, if we recommend an alternative game we'll keep its original score, but obviously times change and what may have been a great game a couple of years ago, now may be a bit passe. However in the past five years alone we've reviewed around 1,000 games, so you can be sure that our recommendations come with an accumulated wealth of gameplaying experience. If a game scores more than 90% we'll award it a sought-after CVG HIT!. WORLDBEATER SNES Streetfighter Il Turbo Nintendo/.99 Still the best one-on-one combat game for the SNES. If you've already got a copy try Ranma 1/2 from Ocean or Capcom's Art Of Fighting Issue 134: 81% Rise Of The Robots which is the first magazine to bring all 11 versions of this graphically stunning beat-'em-up together in one feature? CVG of course. Whenever you see one of these we'll be referring to the best game of its type, irrespective of which games machine it's on. You won't be seeing many of these only games scoring 95% or over will be granted this accolade. "

"UUNITO JUU COMING SOON CVG Core is undoubtedly the isometric graphics master on the Amiga, with Skeleton Krew promising some of its most stunning images yet. JULY Last month we brought you exclusive first pics of this corking football game, and it won't be long now until you can get your hands on it. FIFA promises even more in the way of action than the Mega Drive version, plus there's going to be a fiveplayer mode with a Hudson Super Soft Multi-tap. Building on the original, there'll be more moves, better graphics and stunning crowd effects made up from 30 different samples. THEME PARK 3DO/PC/PC CD-ROM/A1200 BULLFROG If you caught our big EA preview last month then you'll be familiar with the next release from software supremo Bullfrog. Basically It's a cross between a fairground and Sim City. As boss of a struggling theme park, your job is to make it the top attraction in the world by designing rides and setting up better facilities. Everything you build has an affect on other parts of the park, so if you don't build any toilets, people won't hang around for very long. The CD versions have the added bonus of letting you try the rides out in a stunning ray-traced sequence. With Bullfrog's impressive track record it looks like this is one developer on to another winner. HOM The Mega-CD's first video-based shoot-'em-up since Sewer Shark certainly looks impressive, but will Tomcat Alley have the necessary playability? SKELETON KREW AMIGA 1200/CD32 BY CORE Remember Domark's Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters? Well here's a game which uses the same 3D view-point and combines it with stunning graphics and gruesome nasties. As Core is also a licensed Sega producer, we may even see a Mega Drive version in the distant future. Whatever, Skeleton Krew is looking really good (check out last month's in-depth preview). It could well turn out to be one of the biggest Amiga shoot-'em-ups out this year. All the signs say that Bullfrog is on the right track with Theme Park, keep an eye out for the review soon. I TOMCAT ALLEY 1 MEGA-CD SEGA More FMV mayhem is coming to your Mega-CD as you take to the skies in an attack fighter. Tomcat Alley looks like being the first properly playable video shoot-'em-up, but you'll just have to wait for the review next month to find out. The original version of Stardust was excellent, and the CD32 release is set to be even better. WHO SHOT JOHNNY ROCK? 3DO AMERICAN LASER GAMES The follow-up to the very poor Mad Dog McCree is due to appear on 3D0 this summer. Rumour is that ALG has managed to crack the access time trouble, which really plagued McCree, to produce instantaneous action, but we'll just have to wait and see what the result is. MOSHO JOHNNY I SUPER STARDUST CD32 DAZE Building on the success of Amiga Stardust, Helsinki-based programming team Bloodhouse is set to release a new and improved 256colour version of their smash-hit Amiga shoot-'em-up. It's a cross between asteroids and the old Star Wars coin-op, and received rave reviews first time around on floppy. Mad Dog McCree didn't go down very well, let's hope Johnny Rock turns out to be a lot better.

"CVG FEATURE DEVELOPERS' WISH LISTS WISH UPON A WITH THE NEXT GENERATION OF CONSOLES KNOCKING ON OUR DOORS, WE WANT TO SEE SOFTWARE WHICH ISN'T JUST A CROCK OF OLD PLATFORM GAMES. BUT WHAT DO BRITAIN'S TOP DEVELOPERS THINK? QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS, EVERYWHERE We questioned console developers, PC and Amiga developers and those who work with new technology. We asked each person the following four questions: 1. If you could design your ideal games machine, what would it feature? 2. If you had an unlimited budget to produce a game for this machine, what would you aim for? 3. Which games do you think are the best for graphics, playability and technical features? 4. Finally, bearing in mind that this is a fast-moving industry, what do you believe will be the major developments in the next five years? Jason Kingsley Company: Rebellion Rebellion is developing for the Jaguar, the world's first 64-bit console. 1. My ideal games machine would be in everybody's home. It would have a 32-bit screen display in high resolution for High Definition Television in letterbox format. It needs to have a very fast main processor and huge amounts of fast-access memory. An octuplespeed CD would be ideal. 2. Fully real-time rendered images in 32-bit colour (so that we can simulate sunlight effects etc). Creatures that speak to you with intelligence and wit. Bad guys that aren't too tough to deal with and the ability to just explore a game world without having to shoot every thing along the way. 3. Top game for playability is Civilization. The graphics are awful, but I've probably played this more than any other game. As for graphics, it's Alien vs Predator. Need I say more? 4. CD is one way to go, but only if used correctly. There may well be faster cheap forms of mass storage in the future, who knows? Let's hope development budgets keep on going up, games prices decrease significantly and more people take up gaming. Most of all, let's hope we retain our independence and vision. Military VR sims are a common training tool, soon we'll have the power to produce the same setup in our own homes. Are keyboards necessary on tomorrow's console? 20 "


"DEVELOPERS' WISH LISTS FEATURE CVG Jo Boner Company: Probe GAMEProbe has been responsible for some of the biggest name game licences, with Alien 3 and Mortal Kombat amongst its most recent successes. 1. My ideal games machines would have one extra and valuable feature and that would be an automatic timer which saved the game and then flashed up a sign that said \"Go out, get some fresh air, play a bit of footy with your mates, say 'hi' to your Mum and live a little.\" After a while you could press a button and carry on where you left off. 2. It would have to be a multi-user game where you could travel anywhere in the world and visit other people and be shown around where they live. with people thinking es warp kids' minds, what will Jo and Josephine Public think of home VR? Will we see more sims and shoot-'em-ups, or original concepts developed for the new machines? 3. For playability it's Zelda on the Game Boy at the moment. This game just aches to be completed. Oh, and Rik Mayall plays it, doesn't he? Graphics is a tough one. We're doing some games at the moment with some right tasty graphics. Heavens, a corporate answer; we can't have any more of those. Technically, how many other people have said Doom then? Sorry, but it's just so good it's frightening. Martyn Brown Company: Team-17 Team-17 is one of the country's leading independent Amiga developers, with a string of successful titles, such as Body Blows, Alien Breed and Project-X under its belts. 1. Firstly it wouldn't have those bloody pad things. My games machine would have decent, coin-op quality mechanism joysticks with about three buttons (I can't handle any more, I'm getting old). It'd also have a keyboard, be CD-based with a high dataatch rate and have lots of custom chips to do the things none of our coders can be bothered doing. 4. Cripes, I should imagine that in five years time we'll all be flying cars to work (which means that stupid people won't be able to drive, of course). Oh, and all our clothes will look like the ones out of Space 1999. As far as video games are concerned, it's again difficult to say, but I should think we'll be doing Real Reality platform games. 2. I had a free reign on games design, which I'm already privileged enough to have smug git that I am), I'd do a really (and I mean REALLY) violent future sports game based on a cult film, erm, something like Rollerball. It would feature lots and lots of moves, lots of blood 'n' gore and be really playable. 3. Notable titles are Doom and Dungeon Master (back in 1986). As for graphics and technical features, it doesn't really matter as long as the playability's there. Where's it all going? I wish I knew. I just hope no one forgets gameplay when all is newfangled technology takes over. I'd like to see cartridges removed, which gives EVERYONE the excuse to BRING DOWN PRICES so that they are more in line with similar markets and use CD. A How interactive's your computer? Developers want to see a move to more interaction between the player and the game. 21 "


"CVG FEATURE DEVELOPER'S WISH LISTS Jim Loftus, Producer Company: SCI SCI is the company that's behind the recent launch of Lawnmower Man on CD-ROM and SNES. 1. I'm currently trying m currently trying to decide which of the many CD machines is going to be the big one. My ideal machine would have to be something which combines traditional hardware with new concepts, such as the way the PC has worked with the advent of CD-ROM. According to the interviewees, the next generation console should be 32-bit colour, have a 100Mips processor, but funnily enough, nobody plumped for Full Motion Video. Matt Webster, Associate Producer FIFA Soccer Company: EA Electronic Arts is responsible for several of the biggest selling Mega Drive titles and it is now turning its attention to 3DO. Is FMV necessary then? Do we want to play games or watch them? Until recently nobody's used FMV to good effect. 2. If I had completely free reign to produce a game, the majority of it would be 3D. The best part would be that we could develop it to perfection, although we'd probably end up working it forever. 3. When it comes to playability, the game that's knocked us all for six is Doom. This is the first game I've seen in a long time which has everything that a gamesplayer could ask for. You get a sense of fear and tension with every corner you turn. 1. My ideal games machine would be a 100Mips-plus machine with at least 16Meg of internal memory. 24. bit graphics display and a really fast polygon/texture engine, at least as good as SGI's Onyx reality engine. Stereo Sur round sound at 44Khz. A virtual headset and input addons and a full feedback chair. This should be achievable within two years! 4. And the future? Recording artists like Peter Gabriel are bringing out interactive products which combine video footage, music and documentary styles. Likewise, the movie industry has awakened to the possibilities. There were two extra days of filming added to the shooting schedule of Demolition Man to provide footage for the interactive product. According to the producerbods, the next generation of games will be specs-on fully interactive virtual reality. 2. I'd like to do a 3D first-person perspective simulation of major events sports and the like. True look and feel games with artificial intelligence that can 'rival' a human player. GAME OVER 3. My current most playable game is Bullfrog's Theme Park. It's so easy to get drawn into, has depth and is fun! For graphics it has to be Doom. Technically FIFA Soccer Sega/3DO was impressive with artificial intelligence that's invisible to the user and genuinely 'intelligent'. 4. The future is either in CD or in central areas allowing downloading into the home. More, more, more and faster, faster, faster is what we want. I also want to see true multiplayer games and interactivity through headsets become common place. 22 "

MENT, THE MOST TALKED ABOUT COMBAT GAME SINCE STREET FIGHTER IT IS ALMOST COMPLETE. CVG GOES BEHIND THE SCENES AT INSTINCT TO TELL YOU HOW ALL 11 VERSIONS ARE MORPHING IN TO SHAPE RISE OF THE he unthinkable has happened. People are becoming bored with Streetfighter II. It's hardly surprising though bar a few new characters and moves the gameplay hasn't evolved in the three years its been out. As for the clones, well the less said about most of them, the better. But now there's a serious alternative. Rise Of The Robots is the first beat-'em-up in a long time that actually promises something different. In fact it's ground-breaking in many ways. It's the first beat-'emup to use full ray-traced graphics throughout; it's coming on more machines than any other 16-bit title and it's the first game to employ the services of an interior designer. Rise may not be offering a wealth of new action, but then again there's not much you can do when style dictates that two people go toe-to-toe and slap each other into submission. There is, however, room for different styles of graphics, original characters and moves and intelligent opponents. These are the areas Rise's programmers, Instinct Design, have concentrated on, and the reason why this game has generated so much interest with the public and press alike. ROBOTS One problem Instinct found with the PC CD-ROM version is that the drives couldn't load data and play music together, so it opted for a mixture of CD music and digital tracks. Surprisingly, the Mega-CD doesn't have this problem, as it uses the CD-XA format, which allows sound and data to be read simultaneously.

It all seems quiet at first, until the robots stop you... The intro starts with your ship zooming over the city. While inside the factory it seems quite deserted. A This is going to be the most power-intensive version of the lot. The bare minimum you'll need to run the 256 colour version will be a 33Mhz 486 with SVGA card, 4Mb RAM and a 40Mb hard disk. If your machine doesn't quite match up, there'll be a 32-colour version which requires at least a 20Mhz 386 with 2Mb RAM and a 20Mb hard disk. Obviously this is going to be one of the most cut-down versions. It will however, use the same palette as the Mega CD game and Instinct claims there won't be any significant speed differences compared to the other versions.

"CVG WORK IN PROGRESS A STUNNING IDEA FOR LOADS OF MACHINES 3DO & CDHEROES AND VILLAINS Your cyborg assassin is one of the best all-round characters in Rise, but the six enemy robots he's up against all have their own, unique strengths and moves. Invisibility moves and laser blasts have just been added, which are activated by Streetfighter-style joystick moves. Here's how they all line up. For the 3D0 Instinct is adding more cinematic sequences and improved graphics, much of which had to be cut out for the other versions. Both are due later in the year. MEGA-CD CYBORG This is you, a sort of long lost brother of Robocop only harder. Your cyborg combines speed, strength and agility to give it as much of an advantage as possible. Despite getting one over the PC CD-ROM version when it comes to sound, the Mega-CD game has to have the number of colours reduced to 16 each for the robots and 56 for the backgrounds. Even then, the cut-down graphic data still soaks up a gob-smacking 300Mb of disc space. PC LOADER Basically this is a giant robot forklift truck which can't move fast across the screen: it has an upper half that strikes lightning This combined with immense power, produces a very deadly machine. Floppy users will get less cinematic scenes (also known as cut-scenes). However all the basic gameplay elements intro, rooms, characters and graphics are still included. There's still no word on how many disks it take up, but expect it'll to be quite a number. THE SENTRY This looks more like a transformer than a combat robot, but this ain't no plastic toy. The Sentry is agile and powerful, its sharp mind means that it'll try to suss out your tactics then attack you based on your very own combat style. For the Super Nintendo Impact is planning on cramming in most of the features from the Amiga 500 version on the cart, so SNES owners should have a game capa. ble of holding its own.

"A STUNNING IDEA FOR LOADS OF MACHINES WORK IN PROGRESS CVG RISE OF THE ROBOTS BUILDER Renaming itself Prime-8 and adopting a gibbon-esque appearance, the builder droid is almost as strong as the loader. It's also slightly faster, although its brain is an old fashioned 32-bit processor which limits its artificial intelligence. Interior designer, Kwan Lee, was brought in to come up with ideas about how the complex should look. In fact he got a bit carried away and designed all the rooms plus the city in the intro. 2009 DUE TO THE IT'S A TRACE ABOUT RAY CRUSHER This droid is designed to destroy malfunctioning robots, and as such is capable of identifying its opponent's strengths and weaknesses and exploiting them to the full. It moves faster than the previous two robots and is equipped with a pair of vice like claws. EXTERMINATOR This may not be the most powerful robot in the game, but it certainly looks like it should be. With vicious features and nasty spikes, its incredible speed is matched only by its vast knowledge of karate moves. Step 1: The first step in creating a high-resolution ray-traced image is to draw it in wire-frame form. This is pretty tricky as it's not always clear if the finished result is going to be exactly what you want. Step 2: Next the software calculates where the light source is and what the primary colour of the object will be. It then works out what shades will be required. Step 3: The next stage is to add the final colours. The same degree of shading is used plus the new colours, which are overlaid on top. Step 4: When the last colours and details have been added, the object is properly rendered to smooth it out and make it look more life-like. Then the last stage is to join it up with the rest of the components to create a rather vicious robot. FIGHTING GAME EVER... THE RAY-TRACED OBJECTS IN THE ROBOTS ARE LINKED IN SEQUENCE TO MAKE THEM MOVE MORE REALISTICALLY. 22 "


"CVG WORK IN PROGRESS A STUNNING IDEA FOR LOADS OF MACHINES A 500 RISE OF THE ROBOTS Like the Mega Drive and SNES versions, A500 Rise has to have cutdown graphics to keep the game running at a decent speed. Even then, it still utilises 16 colours for each robot. A1200 SILVER SURFING The sketch on the left is a rough of the Supervisor Droid. It's very much in the vein of the T1000, only this one's supposed to be a woman. Whatever, it's extremely deadly and you must overcome the final robot on your quest. This is going to be the floppy equivalent of the CD32 version, although with fewer cinematic scenes. However, the basic gameplay and graphics are going to be identical throughout. CD32 Like the Mega-CD version, the CD32 game has been converted from the PC original. However, this one's going to have 32 colour robots and 128 colour backdrops, which should look pretty swanky. COIN-OP Na That's right, Rise Of The Robots is destined to become a coin-op! It's being produced by Bell Fruit, the company responsible for the Zool coin-op. As yet there are no technical details, but you can be sure we'll bring you all the info as and when we get it. The roughs for the intro in the story board above show your cyborg entering the complex at the start of the game. It's all rather Blade Runner-ish at the start, but once the robots get involved it's a wholly original story. The Sentry is one of the most impressive-looking robots in the game, and one of the most complicated designs.

WILL IT DO WONDERS FOR CD-i? GUEST he conversion to CD-i of Virgin's chart topping PC CD-ROM game has sure taken its time. What's been going on, you see, is that the entire game has had to be upgraded to MPEG standard for use with the Digital Video Board. In some instances, this has required extra rendered graphics to be added. The game is set in a toy maker's haunted house, where you have to solve a succession of puzzles. Each separate locked room contains one of these puzzles, which are linked in a fashion so that solving one poser unlocks the door to the next. The game interface is the same as on the PC, but, at the moment, the mouse-driven cursor is annoyingly fiddly to accurately control using the game stick, especially on some of the puzzles which require delicate cursor placement. WORK IN PROGRESS At strategic points in the game, players encounter Full Motion Video images of ghostly guests in the house. Listen in to their discussions because they occasionally provide clues and direct the plot. In the library there's a clue book on the table. If you're stuck in a puzzle go to this and it will tell you what to do. COMING SOON A Another complex test. Place eight Queens on the board so that they can't capture another piece. PC CD-ROM, 3 DO, MAC CD The intro is superb. This book slowly unfolds with FMV clips in the pages explaining the challenge, and then the six ghostly occupants introduce themselves. But who's the seventh? The game is entirely icon driven. The skeleton hand will tap its finger forward if you can move in that direction, or wave side-to-side if you can't. It changes to a pulsating skull if there's a puzzle to be solved and a mask if an FMV clip needs viewing. The sequel to 7th Guest is nearing competition from Virgin. Titled 11th Hour, this offering features the original game aged seventy years with all rooms redrawn accordingly. Apart from more puzzles, the scrolling will be smoother and much faster. EXPECTED RELEASE: AUGUST Going up and down the stairs is a stunning experience. You'll be using the stairs a lot, so look out for short cuts. This is the first puzzle you find.

BIT MEGA DRIVE UPGRADE HORNET EHORNETE his looks fabulous. Virtua Racing was released a year-and-a-half ago and amazed everyone but Daytona makes it seem postively dated. Like Virtua Fighter, Virtua Racing featured Sega's Model 1 graphics board, capable of shifting 180,000 polygons a second. The Model 2 board in Daytona USA coinop is capable of shifting around TWICE that amount, and now they're texture mapped to boot. The result: awesomely realistic action and a stunner of an intro sequence. Like its forerunners, Daytona USA will be multi-player with up to eight people able to compete at once, and it will also feature the multi-viewpoint option made popular in Virtua Racing. And you can be sure that Daytona will cause a stir when it eventually appears on the Sega Saturn and before that on the 32-bit Mega Drive add on which, as we report in this month's news section (page 8), will be available in the autumn for . Get ready to climb in CVG's passenger seat we'll soon be taking a ride into a whole new world of gaming.

Sega has pulled out all the stops to make the handling of the car feel as realistic as possible! ALL ACTION CRASHES Sega's CG Model 2 board continues where the Model 1 board used in Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter left off. Apart from texture mapped polygons the 32-bit custom board allows for super-realistic effects, such as collisions, and also enables crashes to be depicted with car parts scattering and bodywork damage faithfully depicted. Although the cars are a little boxy and Volvo-ish compared to those in Ridge Racer, the overall graphics have smoother movement and more overall detail. SEGA SEGA cu Graphically this game dumps on the earlier Model 1 cionops like Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter and their ability to handle about 180,000 polygons a second. Daytona USA can handle around 300,000 polygons and they're texture mapped too. As with Virtua there will be three courses on offer. Beginners will race around the famous Daytona circuit itself. 32 ORTH SEGA There's expected to be up to 40 opposition cars to race against; much better thatn Namco's Ridge Racer, which has a severe lack of opponents.

"CVG WORK IN PROGRESS THREE TIMES THE RAGE MEGA DRIVE IBEAT-'EM-UP I.99 ROUT JUNE GAME GEAR VERSION PROBABLE zu STREETS WOR PROGR ONE OF THE BEST MEGA DRIVE BEAT-'EM-UPS RETURNS FOR A WELCOME THIRD APPEARANCE... OF RAGE he first two Streets of Rage games have built up a deserved following, so will the third be able to maintain the same high standards? From what we've seen so far it looks like a certainty. For a start this is going to be a 24 MEG whopper. Of course it's quality not quantity that counts, and Streets of Rage 3 features some fine graphics with lots of variety and all backed with hyper aggressive techno music, It's hardy lacking in the gameplay department either. There's a whole heap of new special moves for each character which you can check out in the captions. There's new weapons too, which are even more effective than before and can be combined into each character's death moves. Most importantly the game doesn't follow a single plot, it varies according to the actions of the players which should result in plenty of variety. See for yourself when CVG challenges it to a fight in the next issue. There are seven stages in all, the majority of which are divided into three stages. All the favourite baddies are back including Queen Electra and Zako. IZAN 1622 BLAZ E 03335 Originally seen in the first game the ability to grab someone and throw them has been brought back to life. Be warned though, the enemies can now do the same to you! Adam Hunter's not going to appear in this game but his skating younger brother Sammy is back, and although he's still a bit feeble his speed should get him out of the majority of sticky situations. Like most new Sega games these days Streets of Rage 3 is definitely best played with a six-button joypad. This allows much better accessing of the special moves. Adam's replacement is Zan, a researcher who's blessed with cyborg attachments and can also centralise his energy and fire a blast of supernatural power. A Axel Stone is back and now has a whole host of new and extra strong special moves. Although his jumping ability is still ropey, he's been made extra fast to compensate. ZAN A Mega babe Blaze returns with a whole host of new moves and she looks likely to be the best all-round character once again. If you get bored with the main game then there's a Vs. option against another player, although with the moves on offer Streetfighter's unlikely to be scared. A This won't be just a mindless beat-'em-up. For instance there are sections when the object is simply to avoid obstacles like motorbikes rather than destroy them.

"THE BEAST IS BACK! WORK IN PROGRESS CVG MEGA CD ARCADE ADVENTURE I UNCONFIRMED OUT SUMMER INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED WORLD-BEATING SOFTWARE GETS A WELL-DESERVED SEQUEL... WORLDT HEART OF THE ALIEN elphine has stuck with the same graphic style used in Another World for the sequel AWII Heart Of The Alien, as opposed to using the updated system used in its last outing, Flashback. No bad thing, we reckon, as looking back at Flashback's graphics, although they are undoubtedly excellent, they just aren't as unique as those featured in Another World. Also this time round, as opposed to just running left and right along the flip-screen levels, Delphine has included 3D perspective so that you can shoot into and out of the screen. Add this to the fact that Another World II is around FOUR TIMES bigger than the original and you get the first game on the CD too and you're in for a treat when Heart Of The Alien makes its debut early in the summer. WORK PROGRES Remember the snarling black beastie from the first game? He makes an unwelcome return, along with a host of new enemies, one of the best being this strangeyet-deadly winged terror. Those see-through wings are a bit special. The game opens with an animated intro sequence (as you'd expect from a CD product) of Lester's untimely demise. The action then kicks in, with you controlling Buddy, the friendly alien from the original. You may be feeling pretty down because of Lester's death in the original), but what it does mean is now you play a character with more weapons and more moves. Buddy not only has a laser gun, but he also carries a whip which he can use to lasso baddies, as well as use it to swing over chasms as you can see here. Very versatile lad, is our Bud. A Your enemies are still as insistent on frying your bones as ever, but luckily you've still got the clever laser which shields you in the short-term from alien blasts. Remember, if it's hit too many times it shatters and you're history. A Here's a look at one of the new perspective screens in Another World Il. You can't actually run in and out of the screens (boo, hiss) but you get clever effects such as here, where the enemy alien blasts at Buddy and the laser looks as though it's about to burst out of the screen. 3DO, SNES, MEGA DRIVE, AMIGA, PC Another World made an appearance on all of these machines and now it's coming to 32-bit systems, starting with 3DO.

WORK IN PROGRESS BOLIVIA ABGENTI SNES espite scoring an impressive 93% in CVG last, August, as well as being a number one selling game, Elite clearly thought there was room for Striker to improve. So what can SNES owners expect when the game's released in June? One of the main improvements will be the addition of a battery backup, so no more irritating passwords! This also means that teams will be able to be altered and then saved. It's multi-tap compatible too, for that unbeatable four-player action. There'll be a choice of referees (from tolerant to harsh), more player anima tion, better graphics, more difficult computer teams, and 32 different set piece formations. The Game Boy version includes most of the important features from its big brother. Instead of the battery backup there's a password option in case you want to take a break during play. There's also an edit squad facility and each player has their own attributes which include aftertouch, ball control, tackling ability, passing and heading. Both versions are shaping up well and hopefully will get the full review treatment next month.

The central gameplay element is the character's sword and this will have five manoeuvres, which will probably compensate for the lack of any other weapons. The problem with having one weapon is that it can limit the degree of challenge which the game has. We'll wait and see on that point, but Activision has incorporated six large worlds and an interesting range of bosses to provide some lastability. But Slash is the only man who will it be enough?

While these games aren't technically advanced, they're still better than any of the home computer or console versions. good for them. So wherever possible try to see the game running before you part with your money or make sure you can exchange it if it does turn out to be faulty. VIRTUA You won't have access to every game that you find in your local arcade though, several newer games such as Virtua Racing are dedicated machines and they are built specifically for the one game. However, there's a vast library of games out there, including many all-time classics. Remember to check that the game you're after doesn't require a special joystick (such as Ikari Warriors) or a vertical monitor (like Super Contra). So where do you start if you want to turn your bedroom into a pulpitating pleasuredome of arcade gaming? The first thing to do is to pick up a cabinet. This is the biggest outlay which, depending on how flash you want to be, will set you back between  and ,000. The size of the monitor and its housing are what pushes the price up. Cheaper units, such as the Brent 100 cabinets, come with 20-inch monitors and little else, while top-of-the-range cabinets come with 28inch high-definition screens and excellent stereo speakers. Because the cabinets all conform to the same hardware standards, you shouldn't worry about compatibility, although The Supergun contains very little hardware as the JAMMA boards contain their own custom chip sets. Nearly all Superguns require SCART TVs or monitors. It's a little restricting, but it gives a better picture. Continued on next page SHERX0 VOU 366223 TIME NICK FURYXO YOUR DIY ARCADE SYSTEM Before you rush out and part with your readies for a Supergun, you'd better make sure that your TV has a 60Mhz SCART Socket, as it won't work with anything else. If your TV's under four years old chances are it will have one, but it's best to check in the manual or give the manufactur er a call just in case. The final ingredient is a joystick. preferably one with six buttons if you're planning to shell out for a version of Streetfighter II. Practically any joystick can be wired in, but we recommend you go for a six-button stick On offer are the Apollo stick and Pro-S for .99, or a Mega Drive six-button pad for .99. It's also worth spending a couple of quid on PCB legs, which hook on to the boards so they're not sitting on the desktop picking up bits of fluff.

HERE ARE THE CVG TEAM AND AS IT'S A NEWLOOK ISSUE, WE THOUGHT WE'D ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR BEST OR WORST NEW THINGS! MAY RELEASE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED PAUL General gadabout Rand is no stranger to new experiences. The best of them has to be when he and his chums had their own pub for a weekend, after the bankrupt manager purloined the fixtures and fittings and did a moonlight fit. What would the worst have been? Says Paul; 'Finding that the electricity had been turned off and the pumps wouldn't work. SEGA RECKONS ITS SVP CHIP WILL MAKE FOR TOP COIN-OP CONVERSIONS, BUT IS THE GAME WORTH THE WAD OF CASH IT'S GONNA COST YOU? GARY The last new thing I bought ended in disaster; I was out buying a Mother's Day pressie and spotted these glass vases. They were all different coloured, and the one I want. ed was two rows back and when I reached for it I knocked one over which had a domino affect, and they all went rolling off the shelf! I loathe the sound of breaking glass. DENIZ CVG's 'Dr Blag', fresh from his appalling blagging performance with Acclaim for a copy of NBA Jam, proclaims his fave new item to be an Akai S2800 sound sampler. Which no doubt makes Den happy (yawn Everybody). The most unbelievable thing about it is that he paid full-price no trade discount or anything. Blimey! ega stunned the world when it launched its 32-bit Virtua Racing coin-op in January '93. Like most players, we too wondered if this marvel would ever appear on console. Suddenly, in the middle of last summer year it announced a new DSP chip which later became the SVP (Sega Virtual Processor). The extra processing power of this custom chip finally made a conversion of Virtua feasible and the process began soon after The end product is a stunning conversion which unashamedly flaunts the power of the SVP. All the original tracks and viewing angles have been included (if you have a six button pad). Three tracks represent your three difficulty levels and in two-player split-screen mode you can handicap your opponent for extra advantage. Finish a race and you are treated to a replay of the entire event. More tracks would have been a good idea, but instead Sega has made the opposing drivers damn good, which has had the unfortunate side. effect of leaving you behind on an empty, lonely road most of the time unless you opt for the trickier to control manual gearbox which makes your car go much faster. RIK After an arduous time attempting to discover whether Rik has had any life experiences, we finally deduced that his copy of The Beatles' 'Abbey Road' album is the best new thing he's ever had, while the worst is the Superman outfit he allegedly bought at eight years old. Funny that, considering that he's 22 and it's still a very snug fit. MARK Writer Mark's fave new thing in all the world has to be the Triumph Dolomite he received when he was 17. A strange lad, Mark. Not only can the car not be classed as new it was two years older than him he also had no licence and it wasn't even insured! Perhaps he was one of these saddos who used to sit in it and make 'Brmm brmm' noises? JULIE Obviously sucking up for a pay rise, Julie, when asked about her best new thing, replied with a sycophantic tone: 'My job.' Mind you, can you blame her? After all, the CVG Art Ed has it easy, being able to leave work as early as 2pm on some days, while leaving the layout of the mag to her army of design lackeys (Cough! Splutter! Julie). WED AUTOMATIC HANUAL PETAEA Ever since she joined CVG, we've been worried about Petrea. And not because she's Australian and might be bitter about us shoving her ancestors on a God-forsaken lump of rock 200-odd years ago. It's because the Antipodean artist cites her favourite new thing as garlic snails which she first sampled in France last year. Next she'll be munching on the slugs on her lettice sarnies! STEVE He may have been a driving force behind the newlook CVG, but Stevie J isn't what you'd call thrusting in the sartorial department, if his best new thing is anything to go by. 'My favourite new thing is a second-hand suit with epaulets (decorative square things stuck to the shoulders, like on a doorman's jacket) that made me look like David Byrne' (crap square thing in a band called Talking Heads). This option isn't on the coin-op. Essentially, just a practice option which lets you charge round each course to familiarise your self with the dangers ahead. PEDAL "

ISSUE 148 95% The one player game is the finest arcade conversion I've ever seen. The problem with most arcade games, though, is that they don't stand up to repeated playing and Virtua's three (or six if you count going round anti-clockwise as well) tracks soon become boring. Two player games are usually better, but the lack of opponents means that as soon as one player takes the lead it's nearly impossible to catch them. Technically it's a Ferrari, but playability wise it's a Cortina. RIK SKEWS SPEED 289KM (7) BEGINNER 2.

IT'S ANNIVERSARY TIME, AND HOW BETTER TO CELEBRATE THE VOYAGES OF THE ENTERPRISE THAN A CD-ROM GAME THAT HAS THE DIGITISED VOICES OF KIRK, SPOCK AND BONES... es the original Star Trek adventure is back and if you missed out on the trials of Kirk and crew the first time round, if you're lucky enough to own a CD-ROM drive, Star Trek CD is a game you MUST have in your software collection. Star Trek CD enhances the original with sampled music, sound effects and, most importantly, over 6,000 lines of digitised speech. At great expense, developer Interplay has managed to sign up William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei and Walter Koenig so that you can now hear Kirk shout his familiar commands and listen to the incessant bickering between Bones and Spock. Star Trek CD takes you on a non-stop wave of nostalgia, back to days of spooky alien ships, pointy ears and dramatic Shatner kisses. It's quite remarkable captain. ..or you can play with the text boxes switched off. Obviously this screenshot is damned near useless and so you'll just have to take my word for it that Kirk and crew are engaged in witty digitised banter. PC CD-ROM YOU SEE ASIALL EXPLOSION AND THE KLINGON'S HAND FALLS TO THE GROUND WITH A DULL THUB OK so the game is exactly the same as the original but the voices make it so much better. Star Trek was originally praised for brilliantly capturing the mood of the old TV series and now with the addition of the speech it's almost like watching an old episode. \"Warp factor five keptin\", \"Fascinating\", \"I'm a doctor Jim not a fork lift!\" It's all here. PAUL RAND Even though Star Trek CD features digitised speech throughout, text boxes still appear to describe the character's actions. The Enterprise rocks under the laser fire of another Federation starship. Luckily this is only a training simulation but sounds like the sirens, lift doors and that 'woooohoohoo' whistling noise the intercom makes have all been sampled and faithfully reproduced. 94 OTHER VERSIONS Star Trek on Amiga looks and plays exactly the same as the old PC version. You get the adventure but sadly not the digitised speech. Possibly the weakest part of the game is the combat sections as they are rather jerky and sometimes not really necessary to the plot.

"CVG REVIEW BASKET CASE POWER IMEGA DRIVE SPORTS .99 OUT NOW ISNES VERSION ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED BYRER CAN THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE OF BASKETBALL SIMS POSSIBLY TOPPLE THE MIGHTY NBA JAM? 000 002 ARRIA U ARIE ONUN is a sport Basketball has yet to excite the British masses, but this hasn't hindered the softies releasing a whole wodge of slam dunkin' games. We've had NBA Showdown. Barkley: Shut Up and Jam, Jammit. NBA Basketball and best of the lot, NBA Jam. Now Konami has entered the frey with Hyper Dunk which deserves a pat on the back for not having NBA or Jam in the title. That's about all it deserves a pat on the back for though, since it's another for the strictly average basketball simulation pile. Presentation's not too bad with competent hip-hop music on the title screen, but its graphics and playa bility are quite primitive and not what you'd expect from Konami or the Mega Drive. A The bland backgrounds won't do much to frighten NBA Jam, 'eh? Yo, someone pass me the varnish 'cos this crowd is seriously wooden! MEGADRIVE Hyper Dunk's shortcoming is it's end-to-end gameplay: run the court length, score and then it changes to the opposition. Trying to stop an opponent is nigh on impossible and made even tougher by the off-putting perspective. This makes the game frustrating and predictable, and it quickly becomes dull. Stick to Acclaim's NBA Jam. RIK SKEWS GRAPHICS 67 SOUND 68 PLAYABILITY 61 I VALUE 56 ALTERNATIVES SNES NBA Jam Acclaim/.99 NBA Jam is available on Super Nintendo, and it's absolutely brilliant. Want to know why? The conversion is outstanding, it's packed with action, speed and great fun to play, that's why. An essential purchase Issue 148: 88% OVERALL 9080 A Ooh, someone's near a basket. The tension mounts. Except it doesn't because there's not the variety of finishing shots that there is in NBA Jam. Don't get me wrong Hyperdunk, isn't a bad game it's just that every other basketball game pails into insignificance compared to the mighty Acclaim game. 3.5 Like NBA Jam, some of the realism has been sacrificed to make the game play better. For instance, once your player has passed the half-way line there's an alterable time limit during which time the ball must be passed or a shot taken on goal. 61 GAME BY KONAMI O CONTACT KONAMI (0895 853 000) FOR MORE INFORMATION, 58 "


"TETRIS AND PAC MAN TOGETHER IN ONE GAME RETEW SNES PUZZLE GAME -60 OUT ON IMPORT PAC ATTACK INO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED THIS IS PACMAN AND TETRIS WITH AN EXTRA TWIST... SBORE DO04911 ou wouldn't think it possible to combine Tetris with Pac Man, but once you play Pac Attack you'll see that it is. The concept is familiar: you have to prevent falling items from filling the screen; the difference, though, is that ghosts attach themselves to falling blocks. Every so often, Pac Man makes an appearance and you have to align him so that he can gobble up as many ghosts as possible. Pac moves via the shortest route to the bottom of the screen, bouncing off side blocks until he reaches a dead-end and vanishes. Luckily, you can rotate blocks after they've landed, and remember all blocks collapse into any gaps not yet occupied by ghosts. This means you have to think beyond just fitting a falling block into a gap and work out where it'll end up squeezing into! DOG SOUKE 2002616 The fairy will only appear when the screen is almost full. Try and guide her to an empty space and she'll cast a spell destroying any ghosts below her. GEVEL 102 ISNES This head-to-head option is played in rounds of three. You can handicap an opponent with separate speed settings. Eating ghosts fills up your star tube in the middle of the screen. When filled it will summon a fairy. The only notable absence in this mode is not being able to play against the CPU. Pac can't munch through bricks, so when he reaches a dead-end you'll lose him. After the screen gets filled past the half-way mark it becomes very difficult to regain control of the game. I thought I'd had enough of this sort of thing, but this is such a fresh approach that the addiction is revisited. Pac Attack Requires far more complex strategies than Tetris over its hundred levels, and is more involving thanks to an extra element of control over Pac himself. Funky music and clear graphics enforce the appeal. DENIZ AHMET Stone blocks form ledges which trap other falling blocks. It's possible to destroy them by incorporating them into a row of bricks across the screen. ALTERNATIVES MEGA DRIVE Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine Konami/.99 Play against the Doc from Sonic to match up four beans of a similar colour. Highly challenging and original enough to be considered a classic. Smartly presented and themed. Issue 146: 90% San GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 86 PLAYABILITY 90 VALUE86 OVERALL PASSOS In puzzle mode, the object is to clear the screen of ghosts. While Pac falls you have the option of rotating him independently from the block he's attached to. You can then ndently from the block he's attached to. You can then launch him in any direction you want. The main tactic is to get the ghosts in a straight line. The zig-zag layout shown here is perfect but almost impossible to achieve. 82 GAME DESIGN BY SNK  GAME BY NAMCO CONTACT NAMCO (071 581 5515) FOR INFORMATION  CART 8 MEG 59 "

A Like any good flight sim, F-14 has a positive plethora of outside views. Apart from the usual cockpit angles, missile and enemy views, F-14 boasts a padlock view which pans around indepen dently tracking the nearest target. It's a bit fiddly but it looks quite nice. HERDIMG ALTITUDE PC emember the movie Top Gun? Well if you feel the need, the need for speed'. Fleet Defender is MicroProse's latest jet fighter sim, a carrier-based simulation of the US Navy's F-14 Tomcat. With the look and feel of F-15 Strike Eagle 3, Fleet Defender has all the features you'd expect to find in a flight sim: digitised voices, external views and to top it all off it's beautifully presented. Within minutes you can take to the pastel blue skies with the Ghostriders or join the strike wing of the superbly named Pukin Dogs, adjusting the difficulty level to suit your flying ability. It isn't the prettiest of Sims but there's plenty of variety in the missions. But if you already own something like TFX is it really worth buying? A Strap yourself in, line your plane up on the steam catapult and whoosh... launch yourself into the wild blue yonder. A F-14 has training missions, single missions and a full blown campaign option. Yet another flight sim for the PC. Although it's nice to try and fly a heavily laden F-14 Tomcat, there's nothing here that really grabs you by the shoulders and urges to dump your other sims in the wastebasket. The graphics are thickly drawn, lacking the crisp edge of TFX, and despite being solid and playable, the gameplay is short on originality and, ultimately, depth. PAUL RAND A The graphics engine is based on the old F-15 3 model and although it's quite versatile, the resolution is often poor turning the horizon into a jumbled mass of pixels.

It's usually a dangerous recipe mixing platforms and puzzles but Bubba 'N' Stix comes up with some impressive results. The platform element is varied and fun, and while the kind of puzzles on offer could easily have been boring, with Stix on hand to be manipulated it's great fun just trying different things out. If you're one of those computer owners who hasn't upgraded to the CD32 yet, then why not check out the standard Amiga version? This is the same game except for the awful adult film style music and lack of an animated intro, and it picked up a glowing 88% from my good self in Issue 147. One of the main differences between the CD32 and the standard Amiga version is this tasty cartoon intro which is similar to Core's intro on Chuck Rock 2. A Here's the first time that you'll come across Waldo, the game's main baddy. Except he isn't. You see he's just a servant for a much more powerful alien and in reality is a bit of a bumbling fool and not out to hurt Bubba at all. CD32 Like any platform game worth its salt, Bubba 'N' Stix features a whole host of amusing animations if Bubba is left alone for any length of time. These range from the usual (Bubba looks at his watch) to the downright wacky (Stix is picked up and used as a flute). SELON I love this on Amiga and this is the same so, yep, I love this too. The animated intro is great, as is the speech and sound FX that have been added throughout the game. Apart from this the only difference is the addition of some fantastic CD music which complements the game perfectly and is heaps better than the original score. Mighty fine stuff. RIK SKEWS Here's a puzzle from the last level. This detector won't allow Stix through so what ya gonna do about it?

"CVG REVIEW SEGA TAKES A SECOND MEGA-CD .99 ADVENTURE OUT NOW OTHER VERSIONS SNES/MEGA DRIVE/ SNES/PC/AMIGANES/GAME BOY JURASSIC PARK WITH THE MEGA DRIVE VERSION BEING LESS THAN IMPRESSIVE, SEGA HAS PULLED OUT THE STOPS FOR THE CD VERSION TO SALVAGE SOME CREDIBILID . When you move between locations you're treated to awesome video sequences such as this, when you enter the visitor centre. or Mega-CD Jurassic, Sega has wisely chosen to abandon the film's plot and concentrate on a storyline which actually allows them to make a decent game. It starts where the film left off. Dr Grant and co have been airlifted off the island, but as they leave you arrive, sent by InGen to recover dinosaur eggs. On reaching the island your helicopter crashes, and from that point on you're on your own. The game takes a novel approach to adventures, mixing video footage and traditional drawn graphics with a first-person perspective game style. It uses a point-'n'-click interface with a cursor that lets you scroll the screen and click on objects to pick them up, take a closer look or use them. The gameplay is also very open, which enables you to explore the game in any order you like. A This is the T-Rex enclosure, but the occupant isn't home. In fact Rex is roaming around, and if you hang around too long you hear her footsteps and digitised roar. Watch out you don't end up as lunch. Triceratops is a nice animal unless it spots you. At which point it's time to get out of the way of a four-foot horn powered by 20 tons of dinosaur charging at 30mph. PROCOMPSOGNATHUS TRICERATOPS Lengt tot 25 Weight: 6 tone SA DE ROSTOR One of the best features is the information booths which tell you about the park's dinosaurs. They're fronted by beardy dino-expert Dr Robot Bakker who's been digitised into the game. He plies you with loads of interesting snippets of info about dinosaurs and their habits. As in the film, the Raptors are the deadliest dinosaurs next to Rex herself. Aside from their razor-sharp claws, they move extremely quickly across the screen and are almost impossible to out run.

"BITE OUT OF JURASSIC PARK REVIEW CVG Remember this jeep from the film which T-Rex decided to play with? Well here it is. It's not much use to you, but a search of the boot reveals a pair of wire cutters which come in very useful later. SECOND OPINION A lot of original graphical touches have been used in this game and it makes a refreshing change to find a CD that's not been filled with pointless full motion video. Sound too, has been used well with plenty of gut wrenchingly realistic FX, although the music isn't very atmospheric. Hardly an interactive movie but it's high playability that makes it a fine licence all the same. RIK SKEWS One of the puzzles is working out how to cure the sick triceratops so you can get into the bunker. We could tell you how to do it, but that would spoil it for you, wouldn't it? 1. It's essential to access the control centre early on in the game. Clicking on the computer terminal in the centre of the screen calls up a number of options 2. From the terminal you can access the videophone, which puts you in touch with your base on the mainland. It's worth checking regularly to see if any messages have arrived which contain clues as to how to defeat particular dinosaurs. 3. The terminal also provides you with a map of the dino park, although it's not much use to you until you start overcoming the many obstacles which block your route further into the park. MEGA CD A Your primary mission is to collect at least one egg from each breed of dinosaur and return them to the incubators in the visitor centre. It's not that easy, since the dinosaurs which laid them aren't that keen on giving them up. OTHER VERSIONS MEGA DRIVE/SNES Jurassic Park Sega/.99 The cartridge effort, by Sega US, is a decent platform game, but not as good as Sega's Gunstar Heroes and Jurassic on SNES is much better too. Issue 144: 65% Issue 144: 87% A When you find something interesting the cursor changes to a magnifying glass when it passes over it. You can then click on the object to take a closer look. To my surprise Jurassic Park on Mega-CD is actually very enjoyable. The Cinepak video sequences break up the game nicely, as do the little information snippets on the dinosaurs. This is a decent and inventive licence: it's not quite the interactive movie we were promised, but impressive all the same. MARK PATTERSON JURASSIC PARK PC/AMIGA Jurassic Park Ocean/ .99/.99/ .99 The floppy version is a combination of top-down arcade action and first-person perspective maze game. The mix works well, certainly better than the Mega Drive cartridge version. Issue 144: 89% GRAPHICS 92 SOUND 95 PLAYABILITY 86 VALUE 87 These little Compys don't look very dangerous, but do your best to avoid them if you're running low on energy. OVERALLE RAPTOR-OUS.. 82 There are loads of theories as to how the dinosaurs died out. Sensible people reckon it might have been due to climate change or disease, while those who are a couple of samnis short of a picnic go on about alien viruses or that they ate each other until only Nessie was left, or something 63 "


"CVG REVIEW ISLE BE BACK IPC CD-ROM STRATEGY .99 OUT MAY NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED BLUEBYTE BLASTS BACK WITH A FOLLOW UP TO BATTLE ISLE, A REVAMP THAT'S BIGGER, BETTER AND TOTALLY ADDICTIVE... attle Isle 2 is a strategy war game; it's a huge hex-based affair with some nifty graphics and very addictive gameplay. It's bigger and better than the original and even throws in some 3D animated combat scenes for good measure. The aim is to marshall your forces and to beat the enemy into the ground, capture his buildings and to occupy his HQ with a cheery smile. And instead of playing map after map like the original, Battle Isle 2 has a plot and a developing storyline that involves and distracts you from the repetitive grind of attrition warfare. With tanks, buggies, planes, submarines and artillery, Battle Isle is an extremely accessible turnbased game. Don't be put off by first appearances. CKTEMIRATOR A One of the most notable additions to Battle Isle 2 is the superbly drawn 3D battle sections. Once you've made a move on the map, the result is shown in 3D! PC MORE FORTRESS IMPERATORS RUIRE IMPERATGES Battle Isle 2 is huge and with three levels of difficulty it's tough to beat. Like chess it's no good just wiping out your opponent's pieces one by one, you must have an overall strategy. It's tremendously engaging but on the later levels the computer takes a ridiculously long time to make its moves and sadly this pulls it down a peg or two. MARK PATTERSON A A lot of emphasis is placed on supply lines. Charge in without support and you're going to be in trouble. Of course, destroying your enemy's rail links and disrupting the supply units is the first step towards a winning strategy. Visual range is limited depending on what vehicles are in the area, the landscape, the weather conditions and radar cover. A menacing red mask sits over the area you can't see. Battle Isle 2 isn't just about blowing up tanks and mechanised infantry. As the game progresses and you move through the maps you gain access to battleships, aircraft and huge howitzers. ALTERNATIVES GRAPHICS 85 SOUND 89 PLAYABILITY92 VALUE 84 AMIGA Campaign 2 Empire/.99 Campaign 2 is a hugely complex challenge that combines strategic planning with a 3D fighting section where you can control tanks, jeeps, helicopters and infantry Not previously reviewed If you have a modem you can play over the phone against a friend.

TURING FAMOUS NINTENDO CHARACTERS... *** COOKIES RAR SLAVE L uzzle games nearly always manage to be addictive, if nothing else. Tetris is living proof of this, but so also is Yoshi's Cookie, which like the former will soon acquire cult puzzle game status. If you've ever played Connect 4 you'll understand the principle behind this game. The object is to make a vertical or horizontal row of similarly patterned tiles. New columns and rows of cubes enter the screen from the top and right-hand side, and like Tetris they gradually appear at a faster rate. So, unless you manage to match up tiles and clear a space quickly the screen clogs up and you lose a life. Two distinct sub-games feature a sec. ond player and extra puzzles, which should help ensure that Yoshi's official UK release is as successful as the import version a year ago. Two-player mode is basically the same as the main game except that you have to clear each puzzle before your fuse runs out. Each correct match replenishes your fuse. ROUNDER STAGEOT SNES 80 80 As puzzle games go this is the best available alternative to Tetris. The Mario characters give it appeal to younger players, but it'll hook the older ones, too. Some of the puzzles are very tricky and quick reflexes are vital. Each time you plug in Yoshi's Cookie you can rest assured you're getting good value the puzzles are always different. DENIZ AHMET There's an assortment of tiles in this sub-game. You get a limited number of moves to clear the tiles and a time limit adds to the pressure.

BALL EMERGES AS POSSIBLY THE BEST WE'VE EVER SEEN... I womento GOLD S squality to aby fans Brick. No Squad ega conversions of Anco's Amiga soccer spectacular Kick Off 2 were of comparable quality to the original, but unfortunate SNES, NES and Game Boy fans got a woefully inadequate version that played like a brick. Now, Anco has gone back to the drawing board, ripped up the original spec and come up with Kick Off 3, a game very different to its previous effort. Not only has the screen switched from a vertically scrolling, bird's eye view to a horizontally scrolling 'watching from the stands' pseudo 3D affair. Unlike all other football games using this view, the ball doesn't stick to your player's foot; instead, it rolls freely like a real ball should. There's also a radically different approach to player control; a new method using 'playmakers' has been employed to allow the computer teams to play in a similar style to their real-life counterparts. It all sounds rather excita ing delve into the review and find out more. There are 32 different international teams included in Kick Off 3, each with its own strengths and weakness or just weaknesses if you choose Australia. Kick Off 3's action replay feature not only kicks in after the scoring of every goal, you can also call up a manual VCR-style replay at any time in the game. THE SEEK AND SCORE FEATURE All four SNES fire buttons are used to perform different types of kick. Pressing A performs a pass, while B allows you to punt the ball or shoot on goal. X lets you knock the ball just ahead of you, allowing you to dribble and run round opposition players, and hitting Y produces a lob handy for when the keeper is off his line. To take a penalty, simply hit the fire button and, before your player kicks, push the Dpad in the direction you wish the ball to travel. 1. The playmaker feature really makes a difference to the way football is played on console. 2. Instead of just kicking the ball blindly around like Ipswich players. 3. ...your playmakers will actually seek out the player with the best chance of scoring.

"DON'T BE A NERD GET KICK OFF THE THIRD REVIEW CVG A Go in with a particularly heavy tackle and you're going to pick up a yellow card. Do it again, or perform a professional foul, and you're off the pitch. When the ball is in the air the firebuttons also allow actions such as overhead kicks and flying headers. 8:20 A Unlike so many soccer games available, Kick Off 3 has the offside rule built in, which makes for a more realistic game. The passback law is included, too. SECOND OPINION I've played some football games in my time, and I can honestly say that this is the most playable, involving and impressive of the lot. Bar none. The graphics aren't up to FIFA standard but I don't care, because the gameplay will have you playing long after other soccer sims have curled up their toes. Kick Off 3 is brilliant. DENIZ AHMET SNES OTHER VERSIONS Your average football team will have players who look for ways to feed the ball to the strikers and open up play, this is replicated in Kick Off 3, so that when the ball reaches a playmaker he'll look for the player with the best chance to score. Mega Drive, Amiga, PC and Jaguar versions of Kick Off 3 are almost complete. All versions of the game will be very similar to the SNES one, with the Jaguar game having superior graphics and sound. EXPECTED: JUNE You want a soccer game that's involving, realistic and as addictive in the long term as the day you first bought it? Then you really must choose Kick Off 3. The new playmaker feature adds an exciting dimension and you get rather jumpy the further you advance on goal. I'm a big fan of Kick Off 2 on Amiga, yet I'd say that this one beats its daddy hands down. PAUL RAND CAN YOU KICK IT 85 GRAPHICS 80 SOUND PLAYABILITY 95 VALUE 95 ALTERNATIVES MEGA DRIVE Sensible Soccer Sony/.99 One of the most playable soccer sims available on any machine, this scored very highly when reviewed, but Kick Off 3 is looking more intricate and more enjoyable, but it's still a classic Issue 145: 94% OVERALL 4. Here's the England playmaker passing into space so that the winger can... 5. ... score a terrific goal what a belter! Well worth watching again. 6. You can forgive the scorer for this blatant display of egotism. 96 APPARENTLY, THE ORIGINAL SNES VERSION OF KICK OFF HAD ITS NAME CHANGED TO PRO SOCCER BECAUSE OF LEGAL HASSLES WITH A JAPANESE ZIP MANUFACTURER WHICH, UNBELIEVABLY, WAS CALLED KICK OFF! 69 "


"CVG REVIEW A SENSIBLE NEW UNITED GAME? AMIGA SPORTS SIMULATION .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE MANCHESTER UNITED CVG KRISALIS, BEING A FIRM MAN U FAN, IS ABOUT TO RELEASE ITS THIRD OLD TRAFFORD LICENCE... GP, JS tenhan Hispur 23 All the correct kits are present and you can choose which one you want so as to avoid strip clashes. espite being a Tottenham fan even I have to admit the current United team are probably the finest football side I've seen. This enables me to be clever since I can tie in Manchester United's club form to the state of the games that Krisalis has released which feature them. The first Man Utd game that came out on the Amiga back in 1990 was pretty ropey, much like the team at the time. The sequel (Manchester United Europe) which came out around a year later was a bit better, again like the team at the time. Both these games featured a horizontally scrolling, pseudo 3D perspective as though you were watching from the stand, whereas this new version employs the Sensisoccer viewpoint. Now it's 1994 and Manchester United look like they're on for a win-tastic season. And it looks like Krisalis is on to a bit of a winner too with this excellent Amiga footy sim. Keep your team fit and injury free and you'll do well.

It's quite hard to be accurate with your shot. Tactically this is fantastic with all the right people, squad numbers and formations. Realism scores highly too, with well animated goalkeepers, realistic weather conditions and a range of injuries. And it plays brilliantly, but the control is just a touch weak in places (especially when shooting at goal) and as such Sensi still reigns. But only just. RIK SKEWS Overviene Star Player Information on every character can be called up and every player has his own set of accurate statistics. Each team has three star players and in Spurs' case one of them is Darren Anderton who's shown here. 87 Tottenhan tiotspur Here's an example of the game's realism. This is Tottenham and there's a black player wearing the number 12 shirt who fans will realise is Taciau Jason Dozzell. This makes a difference when playing the game because you can pick the right person to pass to, for instance Teddy Sheringham when he's in front of goal.

Smash them all before Bugs can set the trap for him and complete the stage. ELSETNINE t's not the most original concept around a platform game for a cartoon licence that is, but done properly you have scope for plenty of imagination and creative gameplay. Bugs is exactly this. It's not pushing back boundaries in any way, though as you stride through the varied levels crammed with familiar cartoon gags and traps you find the elements of surprise and intrigue keeping you hooked. This game pokes fun out of classic Bugs cartoons and your opponents are all Warner Bros characters. Bugs' methods of attack are inspired, and apart from his highly animated kick, punch, spin and bum splats, Bugs can also gather various ACME devices to hand. Essentially, it's the variety and creativeness of these devices which give the game its appeal.

Mine's 'Throw Again' as it's the only way I get another go. bout eight years ago no Christmas dinner would be complete without a game of Trivial Pursuit afterwards. Around about the same time came the first of the computer conversions on to the C64, Spectrum and Amstrad. These were quite good fun but the limited memory restricted the number of possible questions. Still they introduced a couple of innovative features, namely real music and sound to listen to and real pictures to look at instead of simply questions. This CD32 version is essentially a repackaged version of the old CDTV game from about three years ago. Now we've got CD quality music and sound FX to listen to and photorealistic images to gawp at. But is this package any better than the boardgame? MC Russell is the game's host. He guides you through each section. At first he's appealing (thanks to wonderful animation), but he soon becomes irritating. Thankfully you can turn him off. Trivial Pursuit has a smart intro reminiscent of Super Space Invaders, another Domark product. It starts off with a family sitting round a TV playing Trivial Pursuit.

"REVIEWS CVG SNES OUTI INOW WORLD BEATER SNES Mickey's Magical Quest Capcom/.99 Possibly the most highly polished platformer of any cartoon character. Varied gameplay and stunning visuals. Highly impressive but too easy because of the infinite continues Issue 135: 87% IF YOU'VE A FLASH NEW CD GAMES MACHINE HERE'S SOME SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT AND WHAT NOT TO BUY FOR IT... ON CD By this stage you realise the best way to defeat bosses is by jumping on their heads. ACME devices have little effect. This game captures the appeal of Bugs. It's funny, well-animated and the levels feature memorable Bugs themes. The gameplay is flawed though, by questionable sprite detection when Bugs tries to kick grouped baddies, and the absence of your ability to attack while jumping. Apart from that it's highly enjoyable. DENIZ AHMET This witch casts a spell which turns Bugs into a tap-dancing frog. LAWNMOWER MAN / PC CD-ROM/SCI / .99 This is easily one of the best looking CD-ROM titles yet, combining stunning ray-traced graphics with generous amounts of FMV footage.

Easily the best CD-1 game at the moment. Issue 147: 87% The animation and presentation is superb. A paintbrush paints in each new level and the rubber shown here erases Bugs when he dies. LIBERATION / CD32 / MINDSCAPE / .99 The follow-up to the awesome Amiga game Captive, blows everything else on CD32 out of the water. The sound effects and music are stunning as is the gameplay, which will grip you right from the off. Issue 147: 95% CD32 It succeeds more than most boardgame conversions because of its quality graphics and sound, but Triv' fans are hardly going to want to sit around a monitor, and games fans won't rate this above the latest platformer or beat-'em-up. Nice try though. This and the CDTV version are the best small-screen trivia games to date. RIK SKEWS REBEL ASSAULT / PC / CD-ROM / LUCASARTS/ .99 If you're a Star Wars fan, this is a must buy, if you're not you'll still need a very good reason not to buy this.

Thankfully, for all of us who aren't yet kitted out with Commodore's latest bit of CD-wizardry, Mindscape has managed to cram the game on to a mere five floppies. Gone is the orchestrated soundtrack and speech which graced the original, but that's about the extent of the cuts. It still retains the same massive levels and totally absorbing gameplay. Set in the 29th century, you're out to blow open a sinister plot to cover-up the fact that police interrogation robots are slaughtering prisoners. The resulting RPG action is a mixture of problem solving and brutality against other robots as you guide your four battle 'droids through the underworld of a futuristic metropolis. It's important to upgrade your weapons as soon as you can afford to. As you progress through the game you encounter robots with armour that's resistant to weaker weapons. The best thing about your robots is that they can be upgraded. When you've got enough cash you can buy upgrade chips which are adapted to work with specific weapons and legs that let them leap out of trouble. AMIGA ALTERNATIVES SNES Legend of Zelda Nintendo/.99 It may not be 3D like Liberation, but Zelda is easily the best adventure/RPG on the SNES. It's totally absorbing and there's so much gameplay in it you won't complete it in a hurry. Issue 112: 92% On an A1200 you just can't beat this. It's got all the features of the CD version with very little disk accessing. Obviously, the 16-bit versions are slower and a lot less colourful, but they retain all the gameplay which is what really counts. You need at least 1.5Mb to get it running, and if that counts you in then you've got to have this. MARK PATTERSON GRAPHICS SOUND 84 PLAYABILITY 95 VALUE 94 WORLD BEATER Doom/PC Transcend/.50 This may be predominantly action-orientated, but as 3D games go there isn't any. thing better than this on any machine.

Here you learn access codes for doors as well as clues as to where to go next You can talk to the majority of characters you encounter, although not all of them have anything interesting to say.

"HE'S PINK HE'S ROUND, HIS GAME IS SOUND! REVIEW CVG GAME BOY PINBALL .99 OUT NOW ANO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NINTENDO'S LATEST GAME BOY STAR NOW FEATURES IN A FIRST RATE PINBALL GAME! PINBALL LAND ever misjudge the Japanese when it comes to the creation of characters to star in the latest video games. Yes, it does seem odd that a small, pink, balloon-like creature can become a huge success, but then again who would have believed a speedy, blue hedgehog could capture the imagination of a generation? Fresh from success in his Mario style platform adventure, Kirby returns to Game Boy in a pinball game where Kirby himself is the ball! Sounds crazy, but as he's round and prone to bouncing around, it makes some sense. Honest. Anyway, Kirby's Pinball Land features three distinctly different tables, each one made up of three full Game Boy screens. There's a host of features present on each table, including warps to bonus stages and even big boss baddies to destroy for mega bonus points. BERDA A Hit Mr Bright (the sun) three times and he turns into Mr Shine (the moon). Hit him three times and a warp star appears which will take Kirby to Mr Boss (the boss). A When you fall through the gap between the flippers on the bottom table, you're given one chance to bounce back by pressing the A button to hurl Kirby back into the game. Choose from three pinball tables: Wispy-Woods Land, Kracko Land or Poppy Brothers' Land. The names are quite sad, but the tables are right fab. DREA GAME BOY The Game Boy has a fine pinball track record So we were expecting something special. We weren't disappointed. Kirby's Pinball Land offers great graphics, a ball which doesn't disappear on the Boy's lowly screen and a stack of features that'll have you slaving away for ages. Forget all other pinball sims on the little Nintendo Kirby's is the one to go for. PAUL RAND The big Kirby on the right thinks about various objects and if you bounce little Kirby off it that object appears. Useful items, like warp stars and Maxim Tomatoes, should be kept and bounced into when you can, but many of the objects are only good for building your score and are best got rid of by bouncing off the big Kirby on the right. 80 ALTERNATIVES Dragon's Fury Mega Drive Domark/.99 If it's all-out action and general pinball perfection that you're after, then look no further as this is the one to go for. Originally available on import as Devil Crash, Dragon's Fury is the beall-and-end-all in pinball simulations. Issue 134: 81% GRAPHICS 86 SOUND PLAYABILITY 93 VALUE 91 A Take a look at one of the bonus screens which can be accessed in Kirby's Pinball Land.

PACED RACING GAME, ADD A SYCOPHANTIC GAME SHOW HOST AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? THE NEW GAME FROM CRYO... The bonus level looks pretty much like any other track except that the cars drive at you head-on. in the far flung future the most popular game show in the universe is Megarace. Hosted by the badly dressed Lance Boyle, competitors race stupidly powerful racing cars on a variety of different racetracks in search of the ultimate prize; fame, small, tacky spot prizes and huge amounts of cash. The tracks, of which there are 16, are varied, and range from simple city courses to tracks through asteroid belts and even underwater. On each track the aim is ludicrously simple. Driving any one of eight powerful cars, you have a mere three laps to shoot or bump off the enemy cars. If you don't manage it within the three laps you lose and must start again. Succeed and you move on to the next track, but if you're very, very good you can even win a prize. Although Megarace involves little more than keeping the accelerator down, moving left, right and firing, it's a highly addictive game. Loud, beautifully presented and incredibly addictive. Lance Boyle is with you every step of the way. He's Bruce Forsythe on acid, Jimmy Tarbuck in casualwear... he's everything a game show host should be.

PC CD-ROM SECOND OPINION Megarace is a stunning game and the shots here just don't do the superb backgrounds any justice. It's true that the gameplay is simplistic but it is highly addictive, and on the later tracks the going gets very tough. I like Megarace but I have reservations about how long the game will last. Its simplicity could be its downfall. But I haven't finished it yet so who knows? RIK SKEWS On the surface, Megarace is a simple game that doesn't seem to have a huge amount of gameplay, but this game is one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time.

A bit of a tall order for any programmer, considering they'll not have had the development kit for very long. That said, there's nothing wrong with trying out new things after all, if a system is more powerful than those which have gone before it, then surely it can do things which the others can't. Which makes you wonder, quite frankly, why Atari decided to release, as one of the showpiece titles for their 64-bit wonder-system, a conversion of a four year-old vertically scrolling shoot'em-up, the likes of which have been around since the days of the Spectrum and C64. Originally released into the arcades by Fabtek, Raiden is a 100% accurate conversion of the coin-op. Trouble is, PACIS who gives a toss? JAGUAR PATISEN COMING SOON JAGUAR Don't be disenchanted because Raiden's a waste of your time and money, because there are plenty of hopefully decent titles in production for the Jaguar.

"HELLO SAILOR! REVIEW CVG ISNES IBEAT-'EM-UP I TOUT NOW ON IMPORT NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE PRETTY SOLDIER SAILOR MOON IT'S AN ALL GIRL, ANIME STYLE, WONDER BRA WEARING, BEAT.'EM-UP POSSE FROM JAPAN, ONLY THEY'RE SAYING WATCH OUT BOYS'. very week in the Land of the Rising Sun, hoards of pubescent viewers tune their TV sets in to watch the antics of five, cute young girls (or if you're being PC, women) jumping around in short skirts in the highly popular anime TV series Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon. And it didn't take the marketing men long to turn it into a two-player scrolling basher starring the cast of the programme, comprising Sailor Moon herself and her four schoolgirl buddies. The game's like most scrolling beat-'em-ups: the screen scrolls for a bit, stops, baddies march in, you bash them, and then it scrolls a bit more. After a while you meet a boss, and then it all starts again with different backdrops under the guise of a new level. It's not very difficult because the baddies have the intelligence of a large root vegetable that's just failed all its GCSEs. This boss is rock hard because there's no way to block his attacks. Try and throw bosses by approaching them diagonally rather than punching; this seems to confuse them. SNES CA Each girl has two special weapons: one shoots forwards and the other to either side. The first weapon needs to be charged up. The problem with Sailor Moon is there's only two buttons for combat, but it gets worse. The methods of attack are limited and the baddies never learn your attack patterns. Any beat-'em-up which lets you stand at the edge of the screen and wait for enemies to walk into your fist has to be bad. Unrewarding, unimaginative and unwanted. DENIZ AHMET Chain Bird is the only girl to use a weapon. Unfortunately, her chain is not much use in short range attack. In two-player mode you would even the odds by selecting one of the other girls. The conveyor belts shown here are also a main feature of the game and a nuisance, too Girls cry when a life is lost.

"CVG REVIEWS THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ROUND INSIDE MY HEAD MEGA DRIVE SHOOT-'EM-UP .99 OUT MAY NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SUB-T A SMALL CRAFT WITH BIG PROBLEMS COMES TO THE MEGA DRIVE. WILL GRAVITY BE YOUR DOWNFALL? hy is it that whenever the universe is threatened by aliens, the best us earthlings can muster in defence is a single attack craft? Probably because it makes for a good shoot-'em-up, like Sub-Terrania. It's set in a series of multi-direc tional scrolling rocky caverns infested with vacantminded baddies and the frequent massive bosses. Sub-Terrania is more than just a shoot-'em-up though, there's also a certain amount of puzzle solving involved. The problems usually involve, you carting objects to specific locations in order to rescue a handful of innocent earthlings. The first task is normally to collect the special 'sub' pod, which tells you what the puzzles are but not how to solve them. In easy mode the nine levels are perhaps too easy, but one thing's for sure: Sub-Terrania is a gorgeous and involving blast. MORE SPN THAN A BLACK HOLE! A Buildings aren't just there as obstacles. Blast them to reveal hidden power-ups. MIRROR IMAGE One of the puzzles which is typical of the game involves placing various mirrors to deflect a laser beam into a nearby wall to destroy it. There are three different types of weapons available each of which offer three power-up stages. Don't forget to collect any stranded miners on the ground too. Blast baddies as soon as they appear in your view, preferably before they can hit back Drop the mirror on the moving truck to deflect the laser and provide a clear route to the switch which grants access to the cave below. There you'll find a double-sided reflector essential to the puzzle. A The reflector also comes in handy as a shield from ground attack while in flight. It's not as much fun as blasting em though. Your ship can only land on flat surfaces. But make sure you have plenty of fuel or you'll die. Bashing into any other surface will drain your energy. It starts here...

Sensi Soccer, arguably the finest football game on floppies, is out for your machine and it can't be missed. This version is identical to its Amiga cousin in every way. from speed and gameplay to tournaments and tactics editors. Renegade has produced one of the most outstanding Archie games to date. The presentation is excellent throughout the game, including the stunning intro sequence. The controls are identical to Amiga Sensi, as is the speed. This is easily one of the best football games anywhere. MEGA DRIVE FUEL MEGA ARCHIMEDES Sub's stunningly smooth parallax play area manages to create a superior illusion of depth. The control system is also sensible but the inertia takes some getting used to. A useful range of weapons makes this a good blaster and the puzzles are inventive and taxing. But, more variety would have helped a lot. DENIZ AHMET Fouls are an essential part of the game. A few sliding tackles will slow the opposition down to a more manageable speed. Everyone likes Sensi it's that good a game, and there's no exception here. It's exactly like the Amiga version and best in two-player mode, but even if you only have one joystick you won't easily beat the single-player game. An essential Archie purchase. MARK PATTERSON bane Pausta. PONOWN SCORE 00110040 The mark of a good shoot-'em-up is having different weapons for different reasons. The power plant shown here is surrounded by a force field, which requires you to locate the appropriate weaponry to blast through it.

REVIEW CVG GAME GEAR PLATFORM .99 OUT NOW SNES, MEGA DRIVE AND NES ALSO AVAILABLE AMIGA VERSION PLANNED BATTLETOADS NOW THE TURTLES ARE BACK IN FASHION, CAN THE TOADS HIT THE BIG TIME AGAIN TOO? After you've smacked the robot a few times it'll begin to fall to pieces. Use this to your advantage and pick up a bar to smack him with. attletoads is a parody of the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles with Zitz, Rash and Pimple taking the place of our shell-laden friends. The game has already done the rounds on the NES and 16-bit formats and it is based on a number of classic games including Double Dragon, Castelian (based on the old C64 hit Nebulus) but most notably the Turtles arcade game itself. There's plenty of variety on offer, but in the end it comes across as rather one dimensional. The fighting's not exactly going to hurt Streetfighter and the platform sections hardly match Sonic in the enjoyment stakes. Presentation is also rather average for a handheld game with no options screens. Graphically this is the first Game Gear game that's disappointed me for ages. A classic example of how you shouldn't try to turn back the clock. Now this is a novel way of picking up energy! Stick your tongue out and grab the grubs, then watch your energy shoot back up! These plants are another obstacle you'll have to overcome when descending the ledge. Hit them once to stun them, but they take three hits to kill in total. GAME GEAR These guys are so frustrating. They bounce all over the place and just when you think you've beaten them they hit you into oblivion. Aargh! Hitting things with the bar makes all the difference since it does much more damage than your fists or feet possibly can. Another average platform game. One thing in Battletoads' favour though is it has more variety than usual. The parallax scrolling is decent, but the game's perspective means it's too easy to fall off a ledge when you thought you were completely safe. It's not difficult but frustrating and unforgiving in its control. Battletoads? Tadpoles more like. RIK SKEWS Here you get to look through the eyes of your enemy. To kill him, pick up the rocks the robot burns out of the ground and throw them at him. BLUE OTHER VERSIONS The best version is undoubtedly the Mega Drive version, and it is a bit dated on the NES now and SNES Battle toads didn't have any significant enhancements. 64 GRAPHICS 69 SOUND PLAYABILITY 58 VALUE 57 OVERALL 55% This game is far too hard and here's an obvious example of why.

ICD32 SHOOT-'EM-UP .99 OUT NOW AMIGA VERSION AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED DISPOSABLE WHITE HERO IS GREMLIN'S LATEST SHOOT-'EM-UP A DISPOSABLE FRISBEE OR A FIRST RATE HERO? 'm in two minds about what in the games industry is known as 'shovelware' (software that's ported over to another format with no obvious differences). I'm in two minds because on the one hand I don't mind playing straight ports if they're decent games like Disposable Hero, but on the other so many CD-only games are a load of smelly old dustbins anyway. Not an accusation you could level at Disposable Hero. Although there's very little 0016500 difference between this and the original floppy disk version, it remains a decent blaster which smacks very much of the R-Type series. The chief differences are the obligatory CD music, but gameplay wise the only difference is that the game's been made easier and more playable. As good as the background scenery is don't stray too close to it because one touch means instant death. 0016500 CD32 The Amiga version of D-Hero is a fine blaster but it's too hard. For the CD32, though, the game's been made easier, but with only five levels you could find yourself completing it before too long. The graphics are decent but the same as the original. The excellent CD techno music gets the adrenaline going though. Fun but hardly essential. RIK SKEWS A You can expect to come across guardians at certain stages during the level as well the big mutha at the end of it. This globe type thing replenishes your energy essential stuff since the game's mighty tough going.

NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED. aten onvenientes VERSIONS aval ESPRIT ni ashion 15 ELOT TRILOGY I DUNNO, YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A LOTUS FOR AGES AND THEN THREE COME ALONG AT ONCE... If you tire of the common-or-garden race tracks then why not go for a designer track? Nip into the course constructor and whip up your very own circuit. A The difficulty curve in all three Lotus games is pitched just right. As you progress it becomes ever more like driving round the North Circular as no-one lets you overtake. The fog in this level makes visibility so dire that could you actually crash the car in Lotus then you probably would, regularly in fact. AI'm sure only a few game veterans will remember this age-old games screen. Quite what that guy is doing round the back of that Lotus is anybody's guess however. DRIAN hree classic games on one disc? Well, yes but the thing about the Lotus trilogy is that they are sequels (yes OK, the first one wasn't smart arse), and although from a nostalgic point of view it's nice to have all three together as one, if you've got the choice of playing Lotus III you're not going to play the first games. Why? Well because in its rawest form Lotus is not as much fun as it is in its latest guise: two player option, more detailed courses, varied tracks, just about every different weather condition thrown at you and numerous obstacles. Plus there's a choice of Lotuses (like the now defunct Elan) and the excellent course constructor, so when you're bored of the supplied tracks you can create your own. nna : HDH: nnnnnnnn GOO CD32 1 ET 44 009 MPH 00000000 600 1 ST Now on this course you would probably be better off driving a Saab or something. Trying to see where the road actually is bad enough let alone trying to stay on it. There does seem to be a degree of slow down on the CD32 version, but the sound is better and the FX are far clearer. But really what we have here is a compilation of past hits, which are fun to play again but an old game like Lotus hardly shows off the capabilities of a 32-bit console. A good but dated racing game(s) GARY LORD Surely every racing game is far more fun in two-player mode, and the lotus Trilogy is no exception.

REVIEWED ISSUE 141.86% OVERALL In its third incarnation Lotus was (and still is a whole lot of fun, with wackier racing courses (just check out this little gingham number) and drone cars that are buggers to get past. With out a doubt the game's far more playable with automatic gears, though if you find that too easy then you could torture yourself and do all the courses with manual. Can I reach the checkpoint in time? Is there enough room to get past the obstreperous white cars? Will I crash into the roadworks just around the corner?

Another big improvement is the 'Go To' option which allows you to click exactly where you want to go without having to move through every square.

"CVG REVIEW SHUT UP AND SKATE! MEGA-CD SPORTS SIM .99 HOUT NOW SNES AND MEGA DRIVE ALSO AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED E JALEC ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL MEGA DRIVE CARTS PUTS ITS CD TROUSERS ON 44 Richer <1 he history of this fine game stretches back to around 1990 when the Mega Drive was still sucking dummies. Since then EA Hockey (as it was originally called) has seen three upgrades with the main changes being the exclusion of blood from injured players and the inclusion of heaps of accurate player statistics. It's also appeared in an excellent SNES conversion. The Mega-CD game is essentially the '94 Mega Drive version with the obligatory CD intro, featuring some FMV hockey footage. Apart from this the game is the same, but if it ain't broke why fix it? Those of you wanting a bit of blood would be well advised to check out Mutant League Hockey (80% CVG 149) which is based on the NHL game engine. MEGA-CD 1ST 8 07 Golaccio! Or something. Scoring a goal is difficult but extremely satisfying. Instead of going one-to-one your best! bet is to run straight down the middle and then pass to someone near the edge who can smack the puck goalbound at an angle. A This is the sort of quality software the Mega-CD is crying out for. It's graphically similar to the Mega Drive version (excluding the FMV intro of course) while the sound's been improved with sampled speech and a better soundtrack. Gameplay's tops with fine control, decent speed and a good range of options. It can be a little tough against the computer but against a friend it's almost as much fun as Micro Machines. RIK SKEWS Just like FIFA Soccer the crowd is an animated bunch, especially little Johnny who leaps to the front of the screen at the start of a face off. It's really tempting to smack the puck as hard as possible and break the glass in an attempt to hurt him, but don't tell his mum I said that! See that row of chairs on the left? That's the sin bin that is, and if you do too many fouls then your players could well end up cooling off in here. DOW JOSE MONTPC 80 S WICE KiGRAPHICS 84 SOUND PLAYABILITY 90 VALUE OTHER VERSIONS Apart from the FMV intro and the improved music and speech the Mega Drive and SNES versions are the same as the Mega-CD game. All come highly recommended. MATCHUPS 89 AVANT OVERALL Come on EA! If you've added real speech and an FMV intro surely you could have incorporated a real person to read out the prematch statistics. Face offs occur at the start of every period and after a goal has been scored. They also take place in the zone of whoever's committed a nasty foul. All the usual options are here and EA's excellent 4Way Play adaptor can be used for four-player tomfoolery, if you can rally round that many mates.

SIM CITY 2000 / PC / APPLE MACINTOSH MAXIS / PRICE: .99 With the follow-up to the classic Sim City. Maxis has created a game which has already bulldozed its way into the software hall of fame. The city-building gameplay is simple but contains more depth than anything we've seen in ages. Excellent. Issue 148: 94% DASH AROUND IN ALOIN CLOTH AND GET MORE THAN THOSE BARE NECESSITIES... t would be nice to forget about your worries and strife, but when you're in the jungle wearing little more than your pants it's best to get back to your village ASAP. And to do this in this platformer you have to map a path through 12 levels, swinging and climbing on vines and battling with all of Mowgli's enemies, knocking them away with boomerang bananas and a blowpipe. The game is a race against the clock, however, a number of awkwardly placed jewels must also be gathered to complete each level. This introduces an exploration element, plus there's usually more than one path across a screen, which gives the game some depth. But it's the well-placed continues which prevent Jungle Book being as frustrating as some similar platform games. DOOM / PC /TRANSCEND / PRICE: .50 When it comes to naming the PC game of the year, chances are this will be it. Doom combines the best 3D graphics seen on a home machine with allaction ultra-violence. Best of all, you can get a third of the game as shareware for only .75! 12.07 1957 Issue 148: 93% These flies attack you, so avoid them or bounce off them on to a higher platform. You lose some energy but it's worth it. GAME BOY COOL SPOT | AMIGA / VIRGIN PRICE: .99 The Amiga finally has its version of the SNES and Mega Drive smash, and it's every bit as good. The graphics aren't as sharp as they should have been, but that's no reason to overlook this excellent platform game. Issue 147: 87% What any platformer needs is imagination and Jungle Book certainly has that. The exploration, action and humour are well-thoughtout and the difficulty level is above average, which gives it that vital lastability. There's perhaps too much emphasis on keeping away from the usual death gaps at the bottom of the screen and not enough on the enemies which inflict little damage and die easily. DENIZ AHMET Mowgli spends a lot of time jumping on baddies or between platforms. He jumps an awful lot higher, though, if he's standing still and not running.

A lot of Marty games can be found on other formats. Microcosm from Psygnosis on CD32, PC CD-ROM and Mega-CD is actually a conversion from the FM Towns, and it actually came out a few years ago.

The shoot-'em-up element is very weedy and very repetitive. You can't hit the walls. The rendered backgrounds are smart but purely cosmetic because there's no sprite collision mapped on them. It's also easy to get through. Far too shallow for the price.

THEN DOGFIGHT WITH A FRIEND AND TAKE SOME REAL EVASIVE ACTION... vasive Action is a pure dogfighting game. Gone are the mission briefings and the tedious A to B flying that chews up your time in most flight sims, in Evasive Action you've just got to get up into the sky and shoot down your opponent. And that's all there is to it but EA offers the player four separate time zones to fly in: World War One, World War Two, The Present Day and even a futuristic 2064 space scenario for good measure. Best of all, EA allows you to fight against a friend, playing on either a spilt screen or over a modem or serial cable. With basic but effective polygon graphics, EA is a fast and difficult game to master. A superb alternative to the current crop of heavyweight flight sims. In the year 2064 suitably futuristic starfighters battle it out in a debris-strewn space sector. PC A The second time zone encompasses World War Il and the pacific theatre; Hellcats and Zeros are your craft this time. A In the 1914 time zone you can take to the skies in either a Sopwith or a Fokker Triplane. This is more a flight game than a flight sim, Evasive Action simplifies the whole flying experience, abandoning the 300 page manual and trimming down the usual mountain of flight controls. The computer opponents are tough but the game is at its best when played against a human opponent. It's a nice game and will hold your interest for a while but for just how long is questionable. GARY LORD .50 Guns 355 You can choose what model of aircraft you fly, how you control it and whether you fly in splitscreen mode against a friend or singly against the computer. Stunts involve either flying through, between or under obstacles and when successfully completed these replenish both your fuel and weapons stocks. A Flying a plane in Evasive Action is simple.

IT'S STRANGE TO THE EXTREME, BUT GOOD WITH IT... long with Mega Man, this has been one of the most eagerly anticipated SNES carts since Streetfighter II. The first Goeman game was good enough and any sequel of sufficient quality could be better than practically anything else around, and it looks as though Konami has delivered. The plot has the hero, and part time thief, Goeman attempting to stop the evil General Magnus destroying the Japanese province of Edo. But Magnus isn't your average dumb harbinger of evil, he's! replaced most of the people with robot rabbits and samurai. And overcoming these is a formidable task. However, all isn't sweetness and light in the Goeman story. Konami of America has decided not to publish the game, which means, for financial reasons, it won't be released in Europe either. So if you want it you'll have to get it on import and it'll set you back  for the 16-meg battery-save cartridge. Still, even with Japanese text and a manual that's as clear as a back-to-basics policy on a dark night in an MP's private chambers, this is one hell of decent game. Magnus has recruited an army of killer robot rabbits to foil Goeman.

"ROBOT RABBITS AND SUMO TROUSERS REVIEW CVG !! BA TITTELUTETETTE ch A counter in the centre of the display shows how much energy the boss has left. Punches do more damage than coins, although it's harder to connect with a fist than it is to land a barrage of money on target. SECOND OPINION Goeman 2 just goes to prove that originality is still alive and kicking in Japan. It's one of the best SNES carts I've played this year, and I doubt if I'll come across anything better. The action and array of features is enormous from taking control of giant killer clockwork toys to the 3D battles with bosses. As the actress said to the vicar's trousers, 'I never knew there was so much in it.' MARK PATTERSON It helps to be controlling Sazuki on the first stage of the ice world since you find yourself running from a giant snowball, which is almost as big as the screen. This is the fastest, and one of the trickiest, parts of the game. SUMO TROUSERS SNES 1. First, hammer the sumo wrestler until he gives in, then steal his robotic sumo trousers. 2. When you encounter General Magnus he'll try to push you out of the ring. resulting in instant death. 3. Get a few good hits in and the top of Magnus' wrestler will explode, revealing Magnus himself. 4. Finish the job and destroy the trousers, leaving Magnus in his rabbit costume. eller A good platformer needs variety and imagination to stand out. Ganbere Goeman 2 starts predictably enough, but as you visit new territories you realise the sheer size of this game. There are plenty of original moments, and the Mode 7 bosses are incredibly challenging, making this one of the best games to appear on SNES in a while. DENIZ AHMET ALTERNATIVES MEGA DRIVE Gunstar Heroes Sega/.99 The closest thing to the varied action of Goeman on Mega Drive is Gunstar Heroes. Apart from any. thing else, it's easily in the top-ten best MD games. Issue 142: 92% From inside the cockpit of the giant Goeman Impact robot you take on a succession of 3D Mode 7 bosses. Impact comes complete with coin-firing gun and two fists which can be used to punch the boss or block his attacks. WOO Sazuki is the weakest of the three characters.

The walls dissolve to stop your characters from disappearing. hile the world and his wife are whingeing about the quantity of platform games and beat-'em-ups doing the rounds on all the main systems, there are at least some companies trying other genres to fulfill your gaming enthusiasm. It seems there's a bit of a resurgence in the popularity of the RPG of late, what with Liberation on CD32, Secret of Mana on SNES and now Legacy Of Sorasil on Amiga. Like Darkmere from Core Design (82% Issue 149), Legacy of Sorasil doesn't really offer anything that hasn't been done in the past, but what's on offer here is superbly implemented and it's great to see that Gremlin has spiced up the usual RPG storyline with some jovial quips. Like any good wizard the magical characters turn their noses up at using weapons and turn to their mystical side by using magical attack weapons like this lightning bolt. When a character dies they naturally enough leave their stuff behind. This can be picked up and used by any of the other characters. Hisensteek AMIGA There's clearly someone with a sense of humour at Gremlin as two of the characters are Angor the barbarian and Calorflame the Cleric. The game has one of those always handy auto mapping features. It also points out things like baddies and traps which your characters can see. The first thing that strikes you about about Legacy of Sorasil (apart from the weighty manual) is how good the graphics are for an RPG. They're clear and colourful but maybe a little unatmospheric. The music is quality stuff though and the gameplay is first rate and easy to get into and you can even alter it to your heart's delight if desired. RIK SKEWS Fighting is simply a matter of selecting the fight icon, moving it over the character you wish to attack and hitting the mouse button. Be careful you don't attack your own characters by accident. 83 It can prove tedious to check every room but it's always worth it as there may be some gold or a trap to avoid ALTERNATIVES WORLD BEATER If it's an incredibly absorbing and enormous roleplaying experience you're after, there's nothing to touch the superb sequel to Captive.

CESS STORIES ON THE MEGA DRIVE, SO WHO CAN BLAME EA FOR TRYING THE SAME TRICK ON 3DO... eemingly unwilling to break with the formula which made the Madden's series so popular, this version uses exactly the same control system as its baby brothers. In fact, the game is generally identical in every way apart from the graphics and presentation. All the graphics in John Madden's are digitised throughout, and that includes the players. There are enough frames of animation to prevent them looking jerky, although they're not as smooth as they could have been had the programmers used sprites instead. Basically, if you played any of the other versions, you'll know exactly what to expect here, although the gameplay isn't quite up to the standard of the Mega Drive game. Receiving passes, for instance, is incredibly hard. Still, it's proof positive, if any's needed that the 3DO has great potential; and if you need further proof then turn to page 54 now! JM IN FMV ON 3DO s1 More video footage, this time its the infamous man-with-stick, who checks to see if you made the down. This can be a little tiresome and it would have been nice to have had an option to switch it off. As in the other versions, you get three windows when you hit the pass button, each showing the position of a receiver.

"THE MADDEN'S SERIES CONTINUES REVIEW CVG INTERCEPTION It's chucking it down with rain, which makes long plays almost impossible. However, if you're des perate, they have to be attempted. A When the ball's snapped back you need to buy your quarterback some time by positioning him behind his defence. Now's the time to recall the little diagram of the play to work out which is the best receiver to pass to. The windows are marked A, B and C, which correspond to the joypad buttons. Simply choose your receiver, press the right button and you'll unleash a massive pass. Unfortunately the balls gone straight to a member of the opposing team, who happily tries to reverse the situation by steaming through your forwards and on towards your goal line. OTHER VERSIONS Madden's has appeared on a variety of 16-bit machines with varying degrees of success. The Amiga version uses a slightly different control system from the other versions to get around the joystick only having one button. Long passes, like this one are difficult to complete, and easy for the opposing defence to intercept and make up some major yardage. The field goal-control system has a gauge to determine power and position.

The only disappointment for me is that the game doesn't play quite as well as the Mega Drive version. MARK PATTERSON There's nothing like a mass bundle to put a player out of the game.

"YOB'S MAIL BAG CVG Life! SOVEREIGN RING WEARERS Dear YOB, I have never before written to a mag, so forgive me if this letter is crap. Before I go on, I'd just like to say that your mag is brill and that I buy it every month. I would really appreciate it if you could answer the following questions: 1. In the recent issues of CVG you have not reviewed a single Neo Geo game. Why is this? 2. How does the Neo Geo compare with the Atari Jaguar? 3. Would you say the Neo Geo is going out? 4. In your opinion which is better out of the Jaguar and Neo Geo for graphics, sound and overall performance? 5. My final question: who the hell named you? M SIDHU Wolverhampton PS I like the pictures, except for the ones of you! PPS I'd prefer cash, rather than a cheque. BRASS BAND CONDUCTORS Dear YOB, Please could you print a picture of a camel having a crap on my head? CRAIG HUNT Tamworth, Staffs YOB: Provided it's been detached from your body first. JOHN MAJOR'S CABINET Dear YOB, why are you such a deceitful, degenerate, perfidious, heinous, loathsome, grim, grisly. abominable, abhorrent, ghastly, gruesome, hideous, horrid, repulsive, revolting, shameful, shocking, terrible, unpleasant, beastly and awful diminutive geek and a total dweeb? STEWART GREEN Holme, Lancashire. YOB: Obviously your Anal Retention Therapy is starting to have some effect. Provided you don't scratch the affected area, you might save a few cells of your brain. Let's face it you're about as useful as a colostomy bag in a jacuzzi and it's about time you took your insignificance elsewhere. YOB: 1. Well if you read last month's CVG you would see that we reviewed Art of Fighting 2, and that we reckoned it is a rather special beat-'em-up, although it must be said that Fatal Fury 2 is one of the best beat 'em ups ever written. 2. Technically the Jag is far superior, but the Neo has a stack of really playable games and more than its fair share of classics. To date, of all the software I've seen on Jaguar makes the machine look like a pile of kitten cack, and until that situation improves the Neo has the edge as an all-round machine particularly if plans to shove up to SEVEN Neo Geo games on to one CD come into effect, as is planned very soon. 3. No. Some of the most playable games I've seen in ages are all on the Neo. SNK is going from strength to strength and its games are getting better and better. If you haven't yet played the uncensored version of Samurai Shodown in the arcades I'd suggest you get a big bag of silver and prepare to spend it all because that game is sheer brilliance. 4. Like I said, technically the Jaguar wins on all counts. But the simple fact is that programmers haven't yet learned how to unleash the power of the beast and until they do the Neo will have better, more playable, games. 5. I was named by Big Chief Hiewatha of the Northern Tribe after my mum's car broke down near an Indian reservation. I always wondered why he called me Yob, and I wasn't the only one. One of the braves once asked the chief how he decided on names for all the newborn babies of the village. \"It's simple,\" explained the chief. «Every time a baby is born I walk outside me tepee and look around. The first thing I see will be that baby's name. For example, if I see a bear in the trees I'll name the baby Brown Bear Running. If the moon is coming up I'll call the child Moon Slowly Rising. Do you understand?\" The young brave nodded. \"That's good,\" said the chief. «Now, Two Dogs Crapping, why did you want to know?\" AND PROBABLY THEIR FAMILIES TOO Dear YOB, I was walking home from the chippy the other day when this scruffy bloke in a leather jacket stopped me and told me he'd beat me up unless I gave him my fishcake. I told him to get stuffed so he knocked the chips out of my hand and they went all over the floor. The thing is, he looked just like your picture, except he didn't have an axe. Was it you, YOB? JAMES STRETCH Basildon, Essex A MASO No PiClu BUT IM YOB: Of course not. I've been banned from Basildon after that incident with the prawn balls during the Mayor's Official Opening. Besides, it couldn't have been me this bloke let you live, didn't he? WILAT'S THAT FUNKY SWELL! 107 "

"CVG ALL-FORMATS RACING GAMES Geoff Crammond's Formula One Grand Prix is identical on PC and Amiga, although the PC-based game does run faster on 486DX2 machines. If you've got Indy Car, this is a worthwhile second purchase. CD JAGUAR XJ-220 MEGA-CD SEGA In 1991 Core Design gave its Lotus-style racing game for the Amiga a bit of a profile boost by basing it on what was then the world's fastest road car, Jaguar's XJ-220. Since then both the game and the car have been bettered, but that didn't stop Sega commissioning a Mega-CD translation to be one of the machine's first titles. Jaguar puts you in the cockpit of one of these 220-mph mega-monsters and challenges you to burn around 32 torturous tracks before the 30 other cars you're up against Underneath these few fancy bits is a game which is competent but not blinding. If you've seen the dazzling driving sections in the CD version of Batman Returns, with its rollercoaster roads and in-yerface scenery you'll be left unimpressed by Jaguar's comparatively simple and unexciting 3D effect. Add that to the fact that there's not really that much skill required and you've got something which doesn't quite match up to its potential. Still, it is the only playable Mega-CD racer, so you'll just have to make do with it for now. .99 HPH Jaguar XJ-220 is the best you're going to get on Mega-CD at the moment. it's a shame it's not that good. WINNER value for money, which is some consolation for all of you who enjoy getting behind the computerised wheel once in a while. (Full review on page 81.) O.99 THE LOTUS TRILOGY CD32 GREMLIN This is an identical pack to the Amiga floppy versions, with all three of Gremlin's successful Lotus games on one disc. As you might expect, there's plenty of CD music to accompany the driving action, but for some reason the games seem to run slightly slower than their floppy brethren. While this is a problem, there's nothing else in the way of driving games for the CD32 at the moment, so you'll just have to make do. Let's hope that either Mindscape hurry up with Mega Race, or Domark do the decent thing and turn out a version of F1 Championship. In the mean time you'll just have to satisty your speed-lust with this. At least it's good PH AND EVERYTHING ELSE... 3DO: Currently the only driving game on 3D0 is Crash 'N' Burn, which is available only on import. It suffers from a chronic lack of playability, so don't bother with it. 54% Best Master System and NES: Like so many other machines, the best here is Micro Machines. Fast paced, two-player and massively addictive. It's out on the Master System and NES which, incidentally, was the first machine it was produced for. 93% Best Game Gear: This is probably no surprise, but once again Micro Machines takes the honours. It's only on Game Gear, but it stands head and shoulders over everything else on this machine. It's even got a two-player on one machine option. 95% Best Game Boy: Easily the best race game on Game Boy is F1 Race.

"CVG Q&A HE BEST HANDHELD? WANT TO GET A SERIOUS ANSWER TO A QUERY ON ANY SUBJECT YOU CARE TO MENTION, BE IT HARD OR SOFTWARE? THEN WELCOME TO HELP! THE CVG TEAM ARE READY AND WILLING TO PUT YOU ON THE RIGHT TRACK! I'm a Mega Drive owner who now wants to get a handheld, but I really don't know which one to get. My mates all reckon the GT is the best, but I haven't seen one on sale anywhere. Please tell me which one I should buy. Roger Bartlett, Swindon CD SWAPS? I'm saving up for a PC with a CD-ROM drive. Can I use CD-i games with it or will PC CD-ROM games work on a CD-i? Duncan Hughes, Slough The short answer is no. It's a bit like asking if Amiga disks will work on a PC or if Mega Drive carts will work on a SNES. Just because a game comes on a CD doesn't mean it will work on every CD machine out there. The PC and Philips' CD-i are two completely different systems with different capabilities. The only thing that may happen in the future is that if both machines are M-PEG compatible (and that will mean buying an M-PEG card for the PC) then both may be able to play movies on CD but not games. Your mates are right. The GT, NEC's handheld PC Engine, is easily the most powerful handheld, and you can get an excellent version of Streetfighter for it. However, it's not on sale officially in this country so you can expect to pay up to  for one on import. Technically the best official machine in this country is Atari's Lynx, although it suffers from a chronic shortage of decent software. So the choice boils down to the Nintendo Game Boy, which has decent games and excellent battery life, and the Sega Game Gear, which also has its fair share of quality software, but gets through batteries at an incredibly fast rate of knots. And the Game Boy has a black-and-white screen whereas the Game Gear's is colour. The best handheld you can get your hands on is the GT and if you can get hold of one you must try and play Streetfighter on it it's excellent. GAME TIPS MEGA DRIVE BUY a Game Genie.

And finally, some of the code same shipping problems from Japan that Nintendo that would have to be included in a Sega or Nintendo and Sega have.

"CVG Q&A HELP! SPEED FREAK SNES BEST I own an Amiga 1200, which I think is rather spectacular. However, even though it's got a 68020 processor, I would like it to run faster. Is there any kind of accelerator board can buy? Jason Reading, Mitcham I have just bought a SNES and I was wondering if you could answer a few questions: 1. What is the best shoot-'em-up on the SNES? 2. Which is better, Striker, or Super Formation Soccer? 3. I want to buy a joystick for Streetfighter II, which one do you recommend? Lee Evens, Shropshire 3 b There certainly is. Depending on how much you want to spend, u n speed your machine up to 30, 40 or 5 O MHz. However, if you just want faster games, an accelerator will only speed up g a mes which feature vector graphics or use features which slow the machine down. Your best bet is the GVP A1230-11, which is a 68030 50MHz accelerator which holds up to 32Mb of RAM and has plenty of expansion capabilities. Prices start at . For more information contact Silica Systems on 081-309 1111. 1. It's between R-Type 3, Starfox and Super Aleste. 2. Striker by a mile. 3. Our fave is still the Capcom stick, which is accurate and takes a hell of a pounding. LEKTRON The best shoot-'em-up on the SNES? Well we reckon that R-Type III would have to shoot it out with Starfox and Super Aleste. REPAIRS A few weeks ago I let my brother finally get his hands on my Mega Drive, which was a mistake, as the stupid dweeb pulled the cartridge (Streets Of Rage 2) out without switching the machine off. Now the game won't work. Is there anywhere I can get it repaired? S Harding, Newcastle Unfortunately I'm afraid that once a cartridge has gone down it can't be repaired.

"Q&A CVG WHICH PUNCH? If Streetfighter Il is not your idea of beat-'em-up heaven, then why not try Streets of Rage II. Be sure also to read our Work In Progress on SOR III on page 34. I'm after a beat-'em-up for my Mega Drive, but I don't know which one to get. I'm not really a fan of Streetfighter II, so is there anything else you can recommend? Morris Day, Sunderland The obvious alternative to Streetfighter II is Eternal Champions, which is still basically the same type of one-on-one beat-'em-up. For something different we suggest you give Streets Of Rage Il a whirl, or wait until couple of months for Streets of Rage III to appear. THE HELP! LINE 3DO DOH!

What exactly is it and will it be released in this country? Danny Elphick, Durham The latest news we have on the American machine is that a lot of them have been returned, mainly because the console keeps crashing. Later versions of 3DO, like the ones which will be released here, shouldn't have this problem. So far the software support is very good with over 140 titles being shown at CES in Vegas in January (see Issue 148). However, price is another consider ation.

"TIME FOR ARCADE NEWS AND GOSSIP ARCADES A D E 5 EUBE ARCADE ACTION LAWYER WARS CAPCOM VS DATA EAST Lawyers of Data East and Capcom are currently in horn-locking mode, the subject of their discussions being Data East's Fighter's History. It's a one-on-one beat-'em-up which Capcom reckons is too similar to Streetfighter II. Data East has also flogged Fighter's History to SNK who is releasing it as a Neo Geo title, to Capcom's annoyance no doubt. This might seem a strange tack for Capcom to take seeing as SFII has spawned countless clones, and Fighter's History is no more similar to it than games like World Heroes or Art of Fighting. Could this mean that Data East has woken a sleeping tiger and Capcom is now getting tough on all copycats? A A Bomberman and Puyo. Puyo hybrid is coming soon. PUZZLE GAME GIANTS MERGE Top games Puyo-Puyo and Bomberman are coming together in a coin-op from Eighting. No official title as yet, but the idea is to manoeuvre the falling bombs until they join together and explode, clearing all the Bomber Man heads piling up at the bottom of the screen. With the success of Bomberman and Puyo-Puyo, this game is going to be very big. CAPCOM'S WRESTLE FEST Coming soon from Capcom is Muscle Bombers, sequel to Saturday Night Slam Masters. It features the same gang of weirdo wrestlers, but the control system has apparently been altered to make the game easier. Muscle Bombers also features a four-player link-up, though this only works with two connected cabinets. Capcom is also soon to convert Saturday Night Slam Masters on to a massive SNES 24 meg cartridge. SEBOU A The stars of World Heroes 2 are set to return in the imaginatively named World Heroes 2 Jet.

"THEY TELL IT LIKE IT IS OPINION CVG BIG EOS THE EDITORS OF BRITAIN'S BEST COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES MAGAZINES TELL YOU WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR ON THEIR SPECIALISED FORMATS... SIMON BYRON EDITOR, THE ONE FOR AMIGA GAMES PAUL RAND EDITOR, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES Stardust. Overkill and Cannon Fodder, the best Amiga games of 1993, proved that even in this day of sophisticated graphics and visual trickery you can't beat old-fashioned playability. Thankfully, this trend looks like continuing with the release of Acid's Guardian, a 3D version of that old arcader Defender. You won't see a game which marries playability and fast-moving 3D routines as well as this on any other format. Try as I might, I just can't stop playing Liberation on CD32 at the moment. It's almost certain that the market will go almost totally CD within the next 18 months to 2 years, but the major players are panicking at present because, while they're trying to knock out generally over-priced and low quality console product to tide them over until the CD revolution, the man on the street isn't buying. Good on you, I say find out exactly what's good or crap, only buy the good stuff, and keep it up until they get their act together! DAVID UPCHURCH EDITOR, PC GAMES RICHARD LEADBETTER EDITOR, THE OFFICIAL SEGA MAGAZINE After a hard day's city construction, how would you unwind and relax? You'd run around darkened labyrinths, chainsawing anything that moves obviously. At least that seems to be the case if the current PC hit games are anything to go by, with both Sim City 2000 and Doom causing PC gamers across the country plenty of sleepless nights. These are interesting times for PC owners; this month has seen more games released on CD than on floppy, with titles such as Mindscape's Mega Race showing just what the shiny new medium can do when pushed. Personally speaking, you can keep your new-fangled high-tech gadgets all l need is a chainsaw... Me and my Mega Drive are virtually inseparable at the moment. And that's because Virtua Racing provides more high-speed pursuits and incredible car accidents than the Police! Stop! video combining realistic Virtua 3D graphics with superlative gameplay. It's looking like 3D is the future of gaming, what with the announcement of the Mega Drive's 32-bit upgrade apparently this little sucker out-specs the Saturn in terms of speed and the number of polygons it renders which bodes well for future Sega Virtua titles, like the incredible Virtua Fighter. In the meantime, we'll just have to make do with quality 16-bit titles like the thumping Streets of Rage 3 and Sub-Terrania currently the greatest blaster of the year on any home system. TIM BOONE EDITOR. NINTENDO MAGAZINE SYSTEM Right now Nintendo owners have three big questions: 1) What are the new FX chip games like? 2) What's the best soccer game? and 3) How long until Project Reality? At NMS we can answer two of them, but the third is in the lap of the gods! The new FX games look very exciting, and have the potential to take the Super NES to a new level. There's soccer mania in the Nintendo marketplace, with three front runners: FIFA Soccer, World Cup USA '94 and Kick Off 3. My advice is that you can safely buy any of them: they're top quality titles and among the best games I've ever played! .
