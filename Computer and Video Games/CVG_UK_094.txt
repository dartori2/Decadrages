"EWS WIN SON OF VCS fter two years of doing very nicely in the States, Atari's 7800 ProSystem A console is now out in the UK at what in console terms, is at budget price, At 69.95, the only machine it doesn't undercut is its ageing predecessor and Atari stablemate the 2600 VCS, which a few dealers are still trying to knock out at ludicrously low prices. The 7800's only real competition, therefore, is from the likes of the slightly more expensive Sega Master System and the Nintendo. So how does it compare. Paul Glancey reveals... Pump up the Pubar in Dig Dug. ISATAR 7300 PROSYSTEM THE PACKAGE For your 70 you get a package very similar to the basic Nintendo or Sega kits. The 7800 unit comes with two \"console-esque\", two-button, joypad controllers with tiny screw-in levers to turn them into miniature sticks. Like all such controllers, they're extremely fiddiy to use until you get used to them. you can get away with plugging in your favourite turbo-charged, microswitched joystick but obviously this doesn't work if the game assigns different functions to the second joypad fire button. An interesting point is that in the states the machine comes with some rather neat Atari Super Controllers (they're more like the traditional joysticks). It's a shame that Atari have decided against packaging them with the UK version of the machine. Ah well.. To start your software collection off, there's a copy of Asteroids II actually built into the 7800 so you can start to play without even buying another car tridge and plugging it in. Namco's elderly arcade blast, Xevious, hits the 2 DO most playable and addictive games are the conversions of classic coin-ops which never had flash graphics to start with the likes of Centipede, Joust, Galaga, Donkey Kong Jr and Mario Brothers. The list of future titles includes even more arcade conversions, such as Bally Midway's Xenophobe, Capcom's Commando and SNK's Ikari Warriors. Other titles are conversions from popu. Roaring down the straight in Pole Position II. THE SOFTWARE It has to be said that, graphically, the 15 games we've seen running on the 7800 don't compare that favourably with the newer 8 bit console software such as Super Mario Brothers Il or Wonder Boy III. The machine has a custom graphics chip, nicknamed MARIA, which does its best to be as flexible as possible regarding the trade. off between colour and screen resolution, so what sprites lack in definition and animation they try to make up for in colour. The programmers have gone in for some quite ambitious projects, too, but with complex flight simulations like Ace of Aces and Super Huey the limitations of the machine do show, as the cloud banks and scenery jerk past. Many of the 7800's best games don't need fantastic visuals to keep the player amused, though. Some of the LINIT TOR SCORE 9640 9540 SPEED 147 D 08 "

Even though the hardware has many technical merits, compared with recent top console titles, the initial software releases are disappointing. However, that's not to say the machine is totally without promise. Some of the upcoming titles such as Joust, Commando, California Games and Ballblazer (which even has an extra sound chip inside the cartridge) look good. In the meantime, the price is the main attraction, and when you consider how cheap you can pick up some top-notch VCS games these days, the ProSystem seems like quite a good buy for those who are more interested in good old-fashioned gameplay than flashy graphics.

Dear Yob, I am mainly writing concerning this mysterious letter answerer THE YOB. I don't think there is such a personit's just an excuse to give loads of people a chance to answer letters instead of the Ed. I also have a complaint about Mr Johnson's views on American software producers. He said they are no good-he obviously hasn't looked at games from Cinemaware such as Rocket Ranger and TV Sports Football which are excellent, and he was for too biased when talking about European Software houses. And another thing, why was FAX removed from your magazine. Previews is OK but it only covers games, and FAX covered much more so me and I'm sure many others want it back to it was before. Finally, why is Julian Rignall so biased when reviewing PC Engine games — he makes out that they are much better than Amiga games, but he is wrong because the Amiga blows it away for quantity and quality. Nunchaku (cool dude) YOB: I'm mel The YOB Is the YOBI There are no substitutes! We've replaced FAX with the new-look news pagescoupled with the massive previews pages, you now get even more news than ever before. Mr Rignall tells me that he isn't blased towards any machine when reviewing (he owns all of 'em anyway)he just enjoys good games, whatever machines they're on. There are plenty of excellent Amiga games, but In some cases Engine games are better than Amiga ones-just look at R-Type, Vigilante and Space Harrier for Instancel And In no way does the Amiga \"blow the Engine out of the water'. I'd say the were on a par. 021 < "

"EVIEW IIIIIIIIIIII C64 OUVERTE K 4 What's in the cave? BY SYSTEM 3 LIVES. A Oo-er! Looks a bit creepy. BE A Tusker. s far as I remember there hasn't been a computer game that features elephants to any great extent, so Tusker is a real ground-breaker in the field. In it you play a rugged Indiana Jones type whose explorer dad has just popped his clogs on the road to the legendary Elephant's Graveyard. You've decided to follow in your father's footsteps, and search a flip-screen version of the wilds of Africa for this hoard of priceless ivory. On the C64, the game comes in three-part multiload form, starting with you somewhere in the desert. There's sand, sand. sand as far as the eye can see, but the place is teeming with sword-wielding Bedouins and zombie tribesmen, who, for reasons known only to themselves, would like nothing better than to make Explorer Cous Cous from your guts. Every time you're wounded by their clubs and pointy sticks, you lose pixels from a jar of blood in the status area to show that you're getting a little nearer to your maker. However, being well-versed in the art of fisticuffs you can punch and kick most assailants until they're just a pile of bones in the sand. Tougher situations call for tougher weapons, and there are a flippin' load of those lying around the place.

"REVIEW IMIIIIIIIIL QUUUUU PER sheikhs. The second load features giant bouncing skulls, weeping idols with deadly tears and giant marsh monsters which spring out of the ground, give you a good kicking and then spring back down. The third load is a sort of \"Land That Time Forgot\" affair, in which you have to duck swooping Pteranodons and avoid hungry water dinosaurs and even giant carnivorous plants! The definition of the graphics for these beasts and the jungley backdrops is excellent, and the hero of the piece, a stubble-chinned specimen of spritehood with the lope of a man half-knackered, is impressive. A bit of variety always makes a game a bit more interesting to play, and Tusker's multitude of different scenes help lend the gameplay that variety. You can be wading through an underground river, dodging crocodiles one minute, and duffing up tribesmen in ancient temples the next, which isn't a particularly nice way to behave, but it's quite good fun. The puzzley bits combine nicely with the hitting-people bits to make a game that plays very similarly to The Last Ninja duo. And considering how playable those two were, I'd say System 3 were onto another winner. A Bash the enemy. USKER Watch out for those tears. what you need to get through the jungle village and the temple in the second and third loads.

After months of speculation and prepublicity (cynics have called it \"hype\"), those programmers with Speedballs, the Bitmap Brothers have finished their magnum opus — and I'm happy to report that the wait was 100% worth it. As you must know by now, Xenon II Megablast is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up with bolt-on extra weapons to help keep those aliens extra warm. There's no plot as such, but play is set over five beautifully-drawn, full-screen, multi-speed, bi-directional, parallax scrolling levels, each of which takes its graphical inspiration from a different evolutionary epoch. Your little spaceship starts the game winging its way through the undersea world of the Cambrian era, when the Earth was populated by sea slugs, peculiar shellfish and flat worms which wriggle in and out of coral structures. Subsequent levels take you through an insectinfested forest, a fishy scenario, a land of dinosaurs and finally, a futuristic spacescape populated by robot craft. Sooner or later the monsters all yield to a few bolts of hot photons so pump that fire button and they're Distapart from a bubble A Single shot fire-not what you want Uuuuu SU260 that's left behind. In the bubble there's an identifying letter to let you know what you can collect by running into it.

The dosh comes in handy halfway through each level when the weapons shop appears.

"DEVIEW he saga continues! Roger Wilco is in the hibernatic sleep chamber of the space pod in which he escaped from Sludge Vohaul's asteroid fortress in Space Quest II. Drifting aimlessly in space, the pod is detected by a robot-controlled space garbage freighter, and drawn into its gigantic rubbish chamber by tractor beam. The landing jolts the pod's revive circuits into action, and before long, Roger emerges from the craft into what looks like an outsized scrap yard. Thus begins Space Quest lll, in a cinematically animated title sequence. Your job, once again, is to get him out of trouble.

"EVIEW IIIIIIIIII korte uns BUFFALO BILL'S RODEO TIME:GO SECONDS SCORE ! BY TYNESOFT Where's Bill? uffalo Bill is famous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, because he killed lots of buffalo: over 4000 of them in the late 1870s (to provide meat for labourers constructing the Kansas Pacific Railway). Secondly, and more relevant to this review, he set up his legendary Wild West Show in 1883. Tynesoft's Games, like the original, feature Indians, cowboys, sharp-shooters and rough riders in a contest of strength and skill. There are six events, all of which contain some humour. Knife-Throwing has you lobbing sharp blades at a Red Indian woman in a leather bikini, who's mounted on a spinning wheel. Hit the wheel and you score points; hit skin and the screen drips blood. Trick Shooting is split into two sections, a firing range and a bottle-smashing event. Next there's Bronco Riding only for the seriously deranged. Follow the direction arrows with your joystick and you might just stay on your hoss for longer than a couple of seconds. The Stagecoach Rescue isn't a real event as such, but it involves A How the west was won. a lot of good ol' joystick waggling moo-moos to the ground before and an old-fashioned punch up, as the time runs out. Silly but you attempt to wrest a coach enjoyable. from the hands of a dastardly Red Buffalo Bill is all very well Indian. presented before you start The last two games — calfthere's a 1-4 player option and roping and steer wrestling are the chance to register your very similar: right-to-left scrolling name. Each event is then action in which you bring wild multiloaded, but there's the A Ride 'em cowboy! opportunity (as there was in Summer Olympiad) to try each one again as many times as you want. For every contest there's a different thigh-slapping Wild West tune, (these include reasonable renditions of the Lone Ranger theme and The Camptown Races), a neat title pic and an individual highscore table. There's not much wrong with Rodeo Games: it needs a lot of skill to master, the three difficulty levels and four-player option keep you interested, and it's good fun to play. The only real criticism you can make is about the price: it's a fiver too expensive. Take a look anyway — it could be worth trading in your Six Shooter for.

"EVIEW AMIGA C64 TIIIIIIIIII OMNI-PLAY BASKETBALL asketball isn't the most popular sport on any computer, and there have been very few successful conversions, so what have SportTime got that the others haven't? For a start, there's a huge range of options. You can name your team, place it in any of the leagues and customise its players in terms of speed, control. outside and inside ability. There's an option to view both BY MINDSCAPE league and team histories and statistics, and you can load in DOD02010061 different league styles and ways of viewing the match. However, the alternative viewpoints and styles come on disks that are bought separately. The action closely follows the rules of basketball, and allows coaching of the team to be carried out by you, another player or the computer. You have the choice of a human or computer opponent and are allowed up to eight time-outs per game (with additional \"tv timeouts\"). Matches can be set at either 3, 6, 9 or 12 minutes per quarter, and you can even change the colours of the team and court!

Beneath its jolly exterior is a real malicious streak which challenges the expertise of even the toughest C+VG UNIUNII 3150 2UP RAOREET The Lather Lads are back! It seems that at the end of their soapy adventures in Bubble Bobble, Bub and Bob were changed from bubble-blowing dinosaurs to rainbow-casting blokes in dungarees. However, even with Baron von Blubba defeated the world wasn't safe (was it ever anyway?). The leader of that nefarious organisation, SHADOW, has captured the inhabitants of the seven Rainbow Islands and is undertaking a land reclamation project, whereby he claims the islanders' land and enslaves them Are Bub and Bob going to stand by and let him get away with such a disagreeable plan? Pah! How could you even ask the question? Of course not! Controlling Bub or Bob, you start a one-man assault on SHADOW's forces at Insect Island. To win back each island you have to fight your way to the top of four scrolling levels, jumping between platforms and casting rainbows which you can climb onto. Each round is timed, and if you dawdle, the island starts to sink into the sea, sending you to a watery grave. Trying to show your progress are hordes of SHADOW agents, who, despite their uncompromisingly cute appearance, are a merciless bunch and their touch spells instant death. On the first island they take the form of diabolical caterpillars, ladybirds, spiders, Wasps and bees, while on the Here's Bub. to time your cast to hit it with the end of your rainbow. As in Bubble Bobble, zonked monsters turn into yummy collectables. Not that there isn't already a veritable grocery store full of stuff to pick up on the platforms all sorts of fruit and veg, flowers, chocolate bars, ice creams and cakes. As well as these pure point-providers, you can also collect potions to give you double, triple and fast rainbows, speed-up boots and smart stars, which zonk everything either on-screen or for the rest of the level. At the end of each round you're also awarded a chest full of goodies to pick up for mega points. Now then, I think that constitutes just about all the features of the arcade game. In fact I've asked around, and even the real fans of the coin-op in the C+VG office couldn't spot any difference at all between this and the real thing Incidentally, the author of this conversion is Andrew Braybrook it's his first ST game, having A Cast rainbows, collect goodies and destroy all eight baddies to win! UPDATE Rainbow Islands is out on all formats. The Amiga version should have even better music that the ST, and the graphics will also be identical to the arcade game.

Well here's another one for the player that wants to play something that little bit different Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters! Here's the scam you play Jake or Duke (two real hip dudesl) who are sent onto the surface of Planet X, which has been taken over by the Reptillons-nasty allen creatures. They're enslaved a lot of humans -who are now usefully employed building a robot army which will be utilised to invade Earth. Can't have that now can wel so beam us up, u nd awayl The controls in this not-toserious isometric shooter are simple enough jump, duck (both used to avoid shots) and shoot, with the usual 8-way joystick controls. Press all three at once and a mini-nuclear explosion occurs, wiping out everything near you. There are three phases to the game-the normal jump and shoot Isometric bit that most of us will be used to from home computer games, a run the speeder through the mate bonus section and a kick the hell out of the mutant reptile bit at the end of the levels. Most of the action occurs in the former bit, though. Move around the early levels THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO CREATE AN EVIL ROBOT ARMY DESTINED TO DESTROY EARTH!  084 "

"ARCADES DYNAMITE DUKE New in the arcades and running along the same successful lines as Operation Wolf is Dynamite Duke. A powerful blast 'em to bits with a few punchy additions. The game starts off in a fairly standard setting: The Airfield. Lots of crates litter the ground, troops advance and oil drums are scattered around providing lots of cover. The first thing you notice is the air is thick with cordite. Aim quickly and squirt off a few volleys at the enemy trucks and tanks need quite a few hits before they disintegrate. Red Cross boxes can be shot open for prolonged life, and firing at oil cans, crates and the like reveal bulletproof jackets and extra ammo. The surprise of Dynamite Duke comes when one of the enemy wades in for a spot of one-on-one combat. In other games, you just shoot to stop anyone getting too close. In this one you go into punch and kick mode and attempt to beat their brains out! Dynamite Duke has lots going for it. The graphics aren't as slick as Operation Wolf, but the action's fast and sufficiently difficult to create the \"just one more go\" syndrome. the absence of a machine gun on the front of the cabinet. Dynamite Duke is controlled by Joystick and fire buttons. In fact alming the gun sight is a hell of a lot more accurate with a joystick. There are three fire buttons for fire, punch and kick. A fair amount of close-up bashing goes on and you need to dodge some killing blows. The action is fairly run-ofthe-mill. Duke stands with his back to you facing into the screen. The enemy --all Invading cyborgs-pop up from behind a variety of objects and let rip with their guns.

As I've already said, Pacland is a marvellous conversion. The tunes, the graphics and the playability are all absolutely identical to the coin-op. It's massively addictive, very challenging and will keep true Pacfans happy for months. JULIAN RIGNALL MACHINES FINA BY NAMCOT VIIMIITTI C+VG BY NAMCOT randslam released computer conversions of Pacland earlier this year, so I was interested to see how Namcot's PC Engine conversion compared with them. Well, to be honest, even the Amiga version looks poor by comparison. (And before any enraged Amiga owners write in.

Final Lap Twin is a conversion of Atari's two-player racing coin-op, and I'm glad to see that Namcot have included the most important feature of the original machine the two-player head-to-head option. A split screen display is used to show each driver's viewpoint, and either one player can race against a very good computer opponent, or two humans can battle one another.

Then it's straight into the race. There are 26 other cars on the course, and the idea is to simply to overtake them all within three laps and finish in the first seven to get points. As well as going for points, there are also course records to break! Apart from having excellent graphics and sound, Final Lap Twin is supremely playable.

"SEGA MEGADRIVE THILINDER CFTIRCE MACHINES THUNDERFORCE The impressive title screen. Blast 'em with mega weapons. 2550 N ew Sega Megadrive reI leases have been thin on the ground since it was launched in Japan just before Christmas but if this new shoot 'em up is any indication of the quality of software to come, it looks as though the machine has a very bright future ahead of it. Thunderforce is a technoblast with five scrolling levels. The twist is that there are three eight-way scrolling bomb-thebase sorties which alternate with two horizontally-scrolling megablast missions. There are the usual truckload of aliens buzzing about the place, as well as the usual truckload of weapons to shoot them with. Not yer standard powerups these, though. Exotic armaments such as wave beams, Lovely smooth-scrolling backdrops. hunter missiles, megaflash or five way shots are what you want, because they kill lots of baddies (and make some rather nice noises too!) Very handy for those b-i-i-i-g end-of-level nas. ties, particularly that mean mutha of a tank in mission four. The alien backgrounds and sprites are very well drawn and animated and there's even a bit of parallax scrolling in there. The use of sound is outstanding. though, and it's really worth plugging your headphones in for the funky music and raucous spot effects. In spite of all this, I wasn't completely bowled over by Thunderforce, simply because there isn't quite enough to it. Although it's pretty tough at first, a few days of practise and a bit of jammy flying is all it takes to get through the game. If it had eight levels I'd rave.

To get unstuck the characters have to make their way through three loads-worth of fiendishly designed platform screens that are jam-packed with puzzles, baddies and hazards.
