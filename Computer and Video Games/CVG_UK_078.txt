Sad to say that ATFisn't one of DI's best releases, although it does offer a depth of play missing from many full-price games. It's just that we've come to expect more from the company who created Tomahawk and TT Racer, ATF is basically a shoot-'emup with some clever frills not one of out and out flight-simulations that have made Di's name. The reason could be that the game is based on a jet fighter that won't fly until 1990! In reality the ATF is planned as the most technologically advanced aircraft ever built. It is being developed for the US Airforce by Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics. It will have an electronic co-pilot designed to take away many of the more mundane tasks currently performed by the pilot. The game attempts to simulate this electronic gizmo but this means you have to spend as much time hitting the keyboard as flying with the joystick. Many of the controls are keyboard based. For example you have to select and fire missiles, access your onboard data-base and jam enemy missiles using the keyboard. Fortunately there is a sort of \"automatic\" pilot which, if engaged, guides your ATF over the terrain at an optimum height, avoiding natural hazards you still have to deal with the man-made ones. The object of the game is to defend allied forces and installations against the enemy, maintaining the balance of power and maybe defeating them totally.

Well, there are shoot-'em-ups and there are shoot-'em-ups, and there are so damn many of them around these days that a game has to be pretty special to stand out. And I'm afraid this isn't it. Playing Bedlam is like going back in time two or three years: it would have seemed a pretty decent game then, and to be fair it still kept me quiet for a couple of hours, but to earn a C +VG hit, or anything like one these days you have to be a DDDDDDDDDDDDDDE little bit original, a little bit different.

Once you complete a level four events a presentation screen is displayed, but you have to do numerous levels to get the full rewards. This is, as you have probably guessed, a comparatively simple game, given life by the high standards of the well drawn and convincing graphics, Lacking laser blasts and a variety of very different backdrops, it relies on the addictive qualities of the very simple basic idea of the game to retain the interest. What this means is it lacks the special touch that would make it stand out from the rest, and would probably do better as a budget title that at its current asking price. So to sum up.

In the all time hall of scrolling shoot 'em up fame you have to class it in the Sanxion, Delta and Zynapse class. Maybe in playability terms it is just about on the same level as Zynapse, but graphically 10 is way ahead of all three of these. Firebird has sensibly dispensed with plot and scenario -lo is about blasting the wondrous aliens that come at you. As with most games of this type you have to build the firepower of your ship to have any hope of surviving. You do this by shooting certain glowing orbs that are dotted around the game at intervals. When they absorb a set amount of missile fire they turn into duplicate ships that you fly into. This will add first one, then two, and finally three extra bullets increasing your rate of shot rather than adding extra weapons to the ship. When you have built the ship up to maximum fire power you can still get two more orbs to add protective orbs. These effectively add extra lives. If you city-scape with monrails at the top and bottom of the screen. Along these rails move blue metalic aliens which spit flak at you. There is a huge worm that twists and spins its segmented body all over the screen making for a formidable opponent. Two sputnik aliens shoot past you, spraying a trail of spheres at you as the 64 emits a splendid whooshing sound. The second level is set against a weird, alien-like forrest, with tulip like plants spitting flak at you. A huge skull is the horrible monster that confronts you at the end of this level. If you are skilled enough to waste him, you will see the red rocky HICHI C 10000 One of best shoot 'em-ups we've seen for C64. PEHYER MICH PEHYER 2!

PRICE: .95 VERSION TESTED: SPECTRUM REVIEWER: PAUL, From the land of mountains, ice and snow comes a legend that has intrigued people for ages, stories of a huge hairy beast, a giant mysterious creature whose existence has never been conclusively proved or denied. It's the Abominable Snowman or Yeti. And so enters Destiny, a new name on the software scene, and programmer Christian Urquhart, and old industry stalwart, with a quest to discover this mythical creature. Armed with a rifle and grenades those twin tools of scientific exploration you set out to hunt and capture the Yeti. Every now and then you get a tantalising glimpse of the Yeti but he or she scampers off before you can do anything about it. It is not until the fourth level of the game that you can actual confront the elusive creature. Until then you must trek through snow, blizzards and into forbidden territory where outsiders are made to feel decidedly unwelcome. Leading the unwelcoming committee are sullen Buddhas which protect the pathways, flinging death-dealing lightning bolts. Then there are the mad monks who rush straight at you. These must be blasted until they change colour before they die. Also watch out for spikes. Don't worry if you don't get the point of them. You soon will! There are also cravasses, hidden beneath the surface, waiting for a real fall guy. The explorer starts out with 50 rounds of ammunition and 10 grenades, three lives and a body temperature which must not fall too low. Along the way, he can replenish his ammunition and grenades. There is also a mystical fluid to be found which will restore body temperature. Power at Sea is a one player game of sea warfare based on the American fleet at the battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944. The American task was to capture island strongpoints by A Because the Buddha... amphibious landing against opposing Japanese sea and air forces, including for the first time the Kamikaze suicide attacks. Anyone expecting a serious strategy game will be disappointed. Power at Sea bears only the most fanciful relation to the real events of Leyte Gulf. But if you like good graphics, good sound and an undemanding shoot-em-up, then this will be one of the best games for you! The player commands from the bridge of an American battleship, with an aircraft carrier and cargo freighter in support.

REVIEWER: STEVE BADSEY. 4th & Inches is one of the better American football simulators now on the market, but you need to know the rules of the real game very well before you start playing. This is a one or two player game in which joystick options let you select a play from a selection of five, then an intended receiver or blitzer, and finally a player to control. You can see your opponent's options, but not which one has been selected. The graphics representing the players and field are good. The only drawback is that you can't look downfield to see if a receiver is clear and you have to throw to your intended receiver (although bootlegging is possible) so quite often a pass is wasted. Fortunately the computer, otherwise a tough opponent, plays zone defense, so there are some plays which are virtually guaranteed to work against it on a timing pattern. Fumbles are not possible except on an onside kick and nor are false starts or delay of game, since the 30 second clock simply stops if you try it. Interception is possible, but you need to have picked the nearest defensive back to reach the ball.

No, don't groan, those games may have been basic, but they were undeniably addictive, and what Arkanoid does is retain that very simple addicition, while at the same time adding all the advances we've gone through over the years. Points are awarded for knocking out each brick, or for taking out one of the variety of bizarre aliens that whizz about causing no threat to anyone, outside of drastically affecting the ball's course. At the same time, coloured energy barrels drop towards you. Collect these, and your ship is dramatically effected. Blue ones marked F, for instance, stretch your craft to twice it's size, making batting the energy blips much easier. A Blast those bricks! MACHINE: AMIGA SUPPLIER: DISCOVERY. SOFTWARE INTERNATIONAL PRICE: IMPORT ONLY REVIEWER: MATT BIELBY. ARRANOID Juggling is all part of the game. HIGH SCORE 50000 12450 This game of the month this and every month as far as I'm concerned or at least until the next hot Amiga game comes is this new version of Arkanoid. It makes such good use of the increased ability of the Amiga as to make it the nearest thing yet to playing a coin op in your own bedroom. Unless you win a C+VG competition that is! Apparantly, you are supposed to be the captain of the escape craft Vaus, trapped somewhere in space behind a variety of elaborate brick walls, and desperately fighting your way out. Your rectangular ship moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen, battling a single energy bolt up against the brickwork as if you were playing some giant game of destructive squash. Miss the bolt and you lose a life. In fact this whole space ship idea is a bit of red herring as far as playing the game is concerned. The ship looks and feels so much like a bat, the energy bolt like a ball and the bright geometric shapes of the walls and backgrounds so little like any idea of space I've ever heard of that you tend to treat it Green barrels (G) make the ship sticky, catching the ball each time and allowing you to reposition your ship before releasing it again to good effect. Light blue splits the ball into three, giving you far more destructive power, for as long as you can juggle them. There are others that speed up or slow down the speed of the ball, but best of all is the red L barrel, which turns your ship into a laser cannon. You get unlimited shots on this, so catch one and the level could be as good as won, as long as you don't get carried away blasting, and lose touch with ball. Arkanoid is an odd game in that at times it seems incredibly easy your Granny could play it when suddenly an unexpected hit speeds everything up, or an unexpected obstacle sends the blip careering in an odd direction. You certainly need to be on your toes. If you're lucky enough to have an Amiga, this should be near the top of your list.

"REVIEWS   MACHINE: AMIGA SUPPLIER: ROBTEK/DIAMOND PRICE: .95 REVIEWER: CHRIS CAIN. A Great backdrops. BALL RAIDER However, where originality does show its face is the stunning 32 colour backdrops for each screen. These backdrops are pictures of great detail, featuring things like fantasy sword-fights, astronauts and heavenly beings. The artwork isn't digitised, and it makes one hell off a difference, One thing about Ball Raider, though, is the devious patterns in which the bricks are laid out. Take level two for example. The bottom row of blocks, except one, are absolutely indestructible. This means bouncing the ball through a one block gap, and it's so darn tricky that you could easily grow old trying to do it. Of course, no good Breakout clone would be complete without a nice sound effect or two. Ball Raider has this sussed in the form of a digitised rhythm which pumps away in the background while you play. Although it keeps repeating itself, the tune doesn't seem to get on your nerves and this is a real boon. The only other unique touch is that you can't actually choose what extras you get to play with, you just get them thrown upon you. One minute you've got a stop ball, allowing you to hold the ball and manoeuvre it, the next ball is wizzing around the screen in a fast mode. Needless to say this makes things slightly trickier but it all adds to the fun. Well, that's about it. A neat version of breakout, with some great graphical backdrops and nice sound. It even has a animated high score table, featuring a real 'Arnold' type who pulls down a blind to reveal the high scores. Can't really say much more, it's just Breakout. Superb detail Over the past few months the 'Breakout' theme has been used to create some really good versions of the old arcade classic. First there was Arkanoid, then Impact and finally Tonic Tiles. So it will probably come as no surprise to find that Ball Raider the latest from German-based software house Diamond, runs in a similar vein. Having said that, it is surprising to find that this is also a pretty nifty version. The scenario for Ball Raider is about as original as the signed photograph of Napoleon hanging above the Ed's desk, going on about the ultimate challenge, etc, etc. Even the special effects such as fast ball, stop ball and free ship are all available in Arkanoid.

This month sees the review of Price: .95 Rating: 76% the best computerized FRP on the market, as well as the latest release from Games Workshop. G.W.'s futuristic brainchild. Warhammer 40,000, a game Live role playing is back and we take a peek at system that took years to some new plastic orcs. construct, has finally hit the shops like a comet hitting the earth. The shock waves of its impact are still being felt all over the country, so let's pick up on the reports that have come in. Our first eye witness is a roleplayer from London. He describes what he saw: \"Well mate, I was at Gamesday at the time it arrived. Gordon Bennet! It appeared from nowhere and the myriad of beautiful colours hit me minces in an instant. An historian from Nottingham expounds about the history: \"Oh yes, this incident has been on the cards for some time. G.W. have been tinkering about with other projects, but in a different timescale. At first they created \"Warhammer Fantasy Battle Rules\", which have been a best selling mass battle fantasy wargame for years. They then mutated this into \"Warhammer Fantasy CITADEL Roleplay\", which was a single MINIATURES character role playing game for use in their world of fantasy. Warhammer 40,000 shock waves still being felt Now they have rocketed the basis of the afforementioned games into the future, combined a few of the ideas behind them with some quantum physics and produced Warhammer 40,000.\" We whizz off to Yorkshire now for a quick summary of the playability of the game from a member of the Flat cap and ferrets role playing society; \"Well lad, we'ere at t' club have given it a bash, an' 'though we found it a mite tough at first, we now play it on a regular basis, when lads can get together. Finally up to glasgow we go, to out economic expert for her comments on value for money: \"Aye, at .95, I found the game a wee bit expensive. When this game was launched in 1980, it was hailed as the next best thing to AD+D, SO of course being young, free and employed back in those heady days of youth, I splashed out with my hard earned cash and bought it. To this day the original is still in my cupboard and it has many well worn pages from continual use. However, the game was withdrawn from the market for some unknown reason and the game obtained a reputation for being complex. E.O.T.P.T. is a complete games system, so when you buy it, all you have to do is buy the relevant dice and you can play it with your friends in no time at all. It gives you all you need for creating your characters, dealing with combat, discovering the powers of magical items and describing the monsters that a party may encounter. You get the feeling that the creation of this game was a labour of love and the detail the rulebook goes into is daunting. This game is not explained to you, it is shared with you and it draws you in with it's intimacy. Let me set you a brief example of what The World Of Tekumel is like. In this world, iron and steel are more valuable than gold; four legged creatures like horses and mules do not exist; monsters have six legs rather than two or four. It is a behind of dozens of cultures, supertechnological to primitive savages. It even has its own language which you can try to learn and speak if you wish. This game is no more complex than any other. The various tables are easy to follow and there are not that many modifiers to deal with. E.O.P.T.P. is also the only game that I know of to have its own newsletter with lots of more background material and scenarios. A great idea. A E.O.P.I.P. has its own newsletter "
