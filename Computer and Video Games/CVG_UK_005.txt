"CASE FOR DECODING Dear Sir, In last month's issue of Computer and Video Games I read in one of the articles that games programs written in machine code are better than games written in any other language because they are faster. I don't know much about how computers work and wondered if you could explain how machine code works and why all games are not written in it. Frank Gree Godalming Surrey Editor's reply: Machine language is difficult to use. It's all right for machine to machine communication but not for man-machine communication. It is possible to group the binary coded words together so that each step in the program can be represented by a word, or mnemonic, describing that operation. This is called mnemonic machine code. Machine language is the most primitive programming language from the human point of view, but it is the only language which the computer can really understand. The manufacturer of a particular processor provides the user with a set of instructions. Each instruction relates to the operation required.

"HUW KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND THE MACHINES Asteroids expert Peter Edmonds, took on the best in the arcade world and came second last month. Only world snooker champion Steve Davis could beat Peter's score on the deciding game of Qix. But by that time, Peter had already been heralded as Britain's top arcade player. In conjunction with Taito Electronics, Computer & Video Games magazine organised the Best Arcade Player finals at the Embassy Club in London's West End. Nine finalists who could prove their top scores on Britain's three most popular machines travelled down from all over the country to compete for the title on January 26th. But it was the finalist with the shortest journey. 18-year-old Peter from Whitton in Middlesex who came away with the prize, his favourite arcade machine. Asteroids, generously donated by MEET OUR TOP ARCADE Taito. Instantly recognising the numerous creatures featured in arcade games is a daunting task even for the most addicted player. But Huw Roberts of Maidenhead has got his finger on the pulse when it comes to creatures. Huw emerged the winner of our Know Your Creatures competition by correctly identifying eight of the nine creatures we asked you to name. No-one managed to name all nine creatures correctly but our thanks and commiserations go to everybody who took part. \"At the moment I'm keen on playing Galaxians and Mooncresta but on average only spend about 20p a week in the arcades,\" said 18-year-old Huw. \"I worked out what the creatures were by playing the games myself and also spent a lot of time watching other people playing.\" What he really likes about arcade games is converting them to run on his own computer, an Exidy Sorcerer, or his school's Research Machines 380Z. \"I really like to watch other people play and try writing my own versions.\" he added. \"He has been playing arcade games for about four or five years ever since the original bat and ball games were introduced. «Ever since Space Invaders came out I've kept reasonably well up on the new developments.\" His top scores to date are 48,000 on Mooncresta and 17,000 on Galaxian. They bring out the aggressive streak in him: \"I like the fact that you can kill things! But also because you can keep increasing your score and bettering your own experience.\" He's hoping his Taito Electronics Space Invader table will grace his parents' lounge when it is delivered. Huw thought quite a few of the creatures we posed in the competition were obvious. But four of them caused him problems. Galaxian was the little beast that made him slip up, and he guessed at two of the creatures, the Wizard of Wor, and Space Fury. Already with O level computing under his belt he has a place at Cambridge University to study computing at the end of this year. games a couple of hours a day and is now concentrating on perfecting his Defender technique. After being beaten by Steve Davis in the specially arranged play-off between the champions, Peter admitted that he may not have put as much effort into that as he had the earlier rounds: \"After all the competition proper was over then.\" And Steve Davis was generous in his victory, confessing that he had played the new Qix machine \"about 50 times\" before this competition. Steve is often seen relaxing between televised snooker competitons by playing arcade games, and his favourite one is Defender. \"I use them just to mess about with during the sessions,\" he said. \"I find them very relaxing even though if you watch 90% of the players you'll see their feet twitching which can be very amusing \"They are a form of competition but it doesn't really matter if you get blown up.\" Steve found the Qix game an interesting and original concept: \"It's certainly a different idea to most of them. But it's timing and co-ordination that is vital in all these games.\" Steve put his victory down to the fact that he had just come in \"fresh as a daisy\", while Peter had been competing since the early morning. Steve Davis concentrating on Qix Unemployed Peter plays mostly in his local Whitton pubs. \"I like playing where there is an atmosphere. It's not beating the machine I like, but beating my mates.\" Before the actual final Peter hadn't played Asteroids for a couple of weeks and he put his win down to the fact: \"I was the only one not wearing a Computer and Video Games T-Shirt.\" He usually plays arcade 14 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"THE NINE FINALISTS E PLAYER The Embassy Club was alive with the sound of bleeping and buzzing machines and the sight of frantic fingers pushing buttons and pulling levers as the nine finalists battled it out. Each contender had five minutes' practice play before they went through 15 minutes of tense, competitive play. The winner from the three Asteroids contestants was Peter Edmonds who achieved a high score of 129,610. Runner-up was Vincent Mulholland of Steve Davis presents champ Peter Edmonds with his rosette Buckhurst Hill, who plays in Tots 'n' Toys and scored 58,410, while Karl Booth a regular on the Gipton Hotel's machine in Leeds came third with 8,750 points.

He beat Richard Carr The Qix machine has already proved very popular in America and was launched who scored 85,575 after hours of in Britain at the Amusements Trade Exhibition on January 18. practice at the Scarborough It is a game of space capture with the player taking the part of a drawing line Casino.

"ONCOMPETITIONCOMP OUR WINNERS DON'T HAVE LONG TO WAIT Following a close joint second were solutions programmed for the Sharp MZ8OK and the Tandy TRS-80 with the Acorn Atom the fourth most popular machine. Many people obviously spent a lot of time and effort not only writing a program to match the sides of the puzzle, but also in presenting it. Some entrants included additional documentation with flow charts, instructions, diagrams and photographs. The final decision rests on the quality itself, whether or not there are any bugs in it and the quality of the programming. GET AN EYEFUL OF THIS TOWER-ON US! Next month the three winners who managed to solve the free Octagon puzzle we put on the cover of the very first issue of Computer and Video Games will be announced. When the closing date of the competition had crept upon us our office was swamped with entries and anxious telephone calls from entrants making sure the post hadn't delayed the arrival of their entries. Getting on for 1,000 people submitted a solution to the \"beer mat\" puzzle hence the delay in choosing the three winners of the VIC-20 computers. These are now in the process of being sorted and tested, a mammoth task for those involved. But by February 15 our judges will have found the three programs which met the criteria laid down. Generally the standard of the programs submitted was good. They covered a variety of computers ranging from the Sinclair ZX81 at the micro end through to the DEC PDP/1.1 representing mini-computers, and up to a mainframe ICL computer. Sinclair owners were keen to upgrade their machine to a VIC-20 and accounted for the largest proportion of the entries. The delights of Paris are waiting for you. That's the prize up for grabs if a program listing you send to us at Computer and Video Games is judged to be the best of the year. Not only will you spend a weekend in Paris — and you can take a friend too but we will also fill your pockets with money. October is the month when our panel of judges will put their heads together to find the winning listing. Each listing submitted will be thoroughly played and tested by the judges taking into account the originality of the game, the use of the facilities offered by that particular computer, playability, presentation and skill in programming. No matter what computer you have written the game for, or how old you are, you can enter the competition and stand the chance of being named best programmer. All entries are valid until October so you've still got seven months to knock out a games program good enough to put you on a plane to Paris. BRAINWARE ANSWERSI The answer to our February Mind Routines is that 73, 74 and 75 are the lowest 3 consecutive integers whose factorials contain the digits 0-9 in ascending order. (73 factorial has 106 digits). The correct solution to last month's Nevera Crossword is printed on the right and we will publish the names of the winners next month.

If you want to play to game to lose, try flying into a quadrant where there is a black hole or a class 0 star. The ship will be destroyed immediately and the game terminated. Another effective method is to ignore your crew and ship's reports, and just keep flying until you run out of energy. The only honourable way to die is to be destroyed in a Klingon battle.

"min w Snakes Remember the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark and how its hero Indiana Jones just hated snakes? Well, he would hate this game too and it would take all his swashbuckling ingenuity to get out of The Arena. How will you fare? Players find themselves in an arena full of snakes. The sides of the pit are electrified — just to add to the difficulty. Among the snakes in the pit are some very hungry man-eating creatures... All you have to do is get out of the Arena by the exit, dodging any snake which takes a fancy to you. Sounds easy. But in order to score points you must hit energy banks dotted around the Arena on your way out-and once you reach the exit there's another arena full of snakes waiting for you. The program uses XTAL Basic and should be easily converted to any other Basic. If you do not have to PRINT facility then you can use POKE (SPAX + 40*Y) or lots of cursor movements. The machine code routine can be replaced with GET, INCH, KBD. or whatever your system uses, it simply returns the ASCII value of your key even when you keep it depressed.

"BY RICHARD JOHNSON \" DODGER RUNS ON AN APPLE Watch out there's a gangster about! and a contract has been put out on you. Dodger is a neat graphics and sound game which features a crowd of Chicago hoodlums armed with nothing more deadly than empty violin cases. But they are out to get you. There's a fence around the screen and a small hole at the top through which you have to escape. There are 1 to 50 bad guys, you choose how many. The object is simply to get out of the exit before one of the bad guys catches you. You are able to shoot some of the gangsters but how many bullets you get depends upon the number of bad guys you've chosen. It's simple but very addictive and trying to escape from all 50 villains is a real challenge. 100 REM 110 REM DODGER 1 120 DIM AS (10),X(50), Y (50) COPYRIGHT R.H.

At the end of the game the computer reads out your score and shows how long you lasted. To play Air Attack you use four keys and a space bar. . Key \"4\" places your A.A. gun in the horizontal.  Key \"5\" places your A.A. gun at a diagonal angle.  Key \"6\" places your A.A. gun in a vertical position.  Key \"A\" fires your A.A. gun.

"Gordon Stevens has utilised some machine code in his program which needs careful handling on the Sinclair The USR routine is used for a preliminary screening procedure in the selection of the computers best move. This allows the main part of the evaluation routine to be written in Basic while still achieving a good response time. The machine code section is held in REM statement 1, entry point 4095H (16533 in decimal) Locations 4082H-4087H (16514-16519 Dec) are used for transferring data to and from the Basic program via PEEK and POKE commands. REM statement l can be written from the keyboard, provided that the function keys are used where appropriate. Commands such as RETURN can be entered by first using THEN followed by the command and deleting THEN afterwards. Statements 10 to 19 modify statement 1 where the code cannot be loaded directly. Alternatively the routine may be loaded via a Hex encoder, such as Remload into blank REM statement from the Hex dump given at the end of the Reversi program.

"RUNS ON AN ATARI IN 8K WITH A JOYSTICK BY JAMES GARO ) 54 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"DRAW If you thought Etch-a-Sketch was the last word in automated art, Octadraw will prove you wrong. As the name suggests, Octadraw enables the player to draw in eight directions at once. This use of symmetry will suggest all kinds of new ideas to the amateur artist and produce some interesting results from those who previously believed they possessed no artistic bent whatsoever. The program is designed for an Atari with 8K and at least one joystick Run the program, then press the start button at the right of the keyboard. You will see a blinking cursor in the centre of the screen. Using the joystick in slot #1, you may move the cursor around the screen. With the fire-button pressed, the cursor will leave a trail of colour as it moves. Seven mirror images of the line will also appear, three will match the cursor colour, and four will be a different colour. Pressing the select button (just above start at the right of the keyboard) will select the computer to do the drawing, while you sit back and watch. When you wish to continue drawing, just move joystick #l and hold it until the computer finishes the line it is currently drawing. You may then add to the computer's drawing. Pressing the button with the word \"clear\" on it will erase the current picture. If a joystick is placed in slot #2. you can control the colours that Octadraw uses. Pressing forward will change the background colour; pressing left changes one of the drawing colours while pressing right changes the other. Holding the fire-button down during any of these three operations will change not the colour but the luminance of the corresponding colour. With eight shades of 16 colours for each of the three parts of the drawing, there are over two million possible colour combinations! VARIABLES USED A=32: Added to x-value to centre drawing. C=3: COLOUR value HI, H2, H4: Colours used in SETCOLOUR x, Hx, Ly statements I: Loop variable KEY=764: PEEK address to determine which key has been pressed L: Used in line 10 to create mixed mode display Used in line 820 to determine length of line to be drawn by the computer L1, L2, L4: Luminances used in SETCOLOUR, Hx, Ly statements P=95: Used to calculate reflections across X-axis Q=127: Used to calculate reflections across Y-axis COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 55 "

START=53279: PEEKing at this location reveals which of the START, SELECT, or OPTION buttons are pressed T: In line 500, T gives the status of the fire-button: 0 if pressed, 1 if not. This determines whether a line will be drawn or not. Similarly, in lines 800 and 810 the computer \"pretends\" to press the fire-button about 9/10ths of the time. You may change this fraction by changing \"0.1\" in line 810 to some other fraction between 0 and 1. V: Reflects any activity from joystick #2. This changes the colours of the drawing. W: Tests for the fire-button on joystick #2. This affects the brightness of the colours. 56 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES X, Y: The coordinates of the point to be PLOTted.

"Trapped in a collapsing labyrinth, it's a race against time to get to the exit before the roof caves in around you. Murray Allen has come up with a simple but innovative game which requires some swift thinking to spot the way out before it's too late. The noughts which appear in the maze are an additional way of judging your performance: how many can you run over on the way out. There are several ways the game could be improved but as an idea, it is quite an original one and could well spawn several interesting progeny. We look forward to hearing from any readers who build on Murray's idea. You are represented on the screen by a (hash) symbol and have to reach the bottom of the screen.

"BY ALLAN SCARFF THE BASIC RULES OF GO 14) CAPTURE A single stone or an entire group is in danger when it has but one tuberty left. An opponent's stone placed on that liberty cap tures that stone or group. All captive stones are removed from the board. Assuming it's his turn, black can capture any one of the three white groups shown here The popular Eastern strategy game of Go is one of the few games which is quite simple to represent on a computer screen. This is the first step in turning your computer into a Go opponent. To tackle this problem, you will need a computer: Pet, Apple, Deep Thought any computer will do! You'll need at least 2K of RAM and a video terminal. Colour graphics would be super and so would disc storage but neither are essential. I will attempt in this and future articles to describe the building bricks of Micro Go. These are designed to minimise effort in the long run. Each rectangle shown in diagram 1 represents a function which, coded separately, can be used unchanged in future iterations of the Micro Go program 1. One player uses black stones. The other white. 2. The board starts empty. Play consists of the contestants placing, in turns, a single stone on the intersections of a 19 x 19 grid. Black starts first. Once placed, stones are not moved unless captured. 3. The object of the game is to surround territory. 1 point is awarded for each vacant intersection surrounded and also for each opponent stone captured. 4. Suicide (capturing your own stones) is forbidden! 5. A player may pass his turn. 6. A game is ended by resignation or by three consecutive passes. 7. The player with the most points wins. 12) LIBERTIES Unoccupied 15) EYES A space within a DUp is called an eye. As a consequence of the suicide Tule, groups with two or more separated oyes can never be captured. Groups that can be reduced to a single liberty. Internal or not. are doomed Each group here is invulner able. Try as you might, the suicide rule will prevent you from removing that last lib arty (6) CONNECTED STONES Stones of the same colour, placed on adjacent intersec tions are solidly connected and act as a unit. Here we show two groups of solidly connected stones along with each group's liberties intersections adjacent to stones are called liberties. A single stone in the middle of the board has 4 barties. At the edge it hus 3 and at the corner only 2 libertins. Here the liberties are marked with CROSSES 2) AT THE END Play ends 0 0000 when no further territory can 01010 0 0 be gained by other player.

"Adventure NAME OF THE GAME GOTO (start). 3040 (reply) = \"OK\": GOTO (start). 3050 (reply) = \"I'M NOT CARRY ING IT!\": GOTO (start). The method of screening replies is dependent upon the structure of the program. To complete our session on possession, we need a reply to INVENTORY. This is simply a matter of concatenating all the objects whose current location is 50 into one reply string: 1200 (reply) = \"I'M CARRYING\". 1210 FORINO TO 3: IF P(I) = 50 THEN LET (reply) = (reply) + 0$(I): 1220 NEXT: GOTO (start). FIGURE 1. & Cottage to knite) 1 Lane 2 Forest (3 Axe) 3 Meadow (2 Cow) Fig. 2: Simplified network of locations showing initial positions of objects in brackets. Note: objects and locations independently numbered. 4 Lake (1 Fish) ROOMS AT THE TOP Adventure is the name given to the dragons and castles game which features on the Atari T.V. games centre. If you own an Atari games centre and have wondered about the Adventure cartridge, be warned that it is not the sort of game usually describe on these pages. This game is purely graphical and is played with a joystick control. The player has to guide his \"puppet\" through a maze which is shown from above and consists of several discrete \"pages\". The aim is to get the treasure, avoid or kill the dragons, keep an annoying bat from disrupting your tactics too much and win home through a maze. Three games are provided according to the package this really means one basic game with additional features that increase the interest and difficulty level. This game, written by Warren Robinett, is popular with Atari owners, but not what you'd really call an Adventure! Adventures would be very dull if you couldn't pick up and drop things — all those treasures so let us take a look at possession commands, TAKE, DROP and INVENTORY. To \"take\" an object, the following conditions must be met: The verb \"take\" or equivalent must be decoded from the input. The noun decoded must be an object in the current location. The player must not already be carrying too much. The object, player and environment may have to pass other condition tests for a successful \"take\". In the example used last month, the decoded number (K1) for TAKE was 2. To check the second condition above, the array P(n) must be scanned. Refer to Figure 1. Suppose the current location (LN) is 2 and the player types \"TAKE COW\". The scanning may be done as follows: 1000 FOR I=0 TO 3: IF LEFT$(0$(I),3)=R5$ THEN K2= I ELSE NEXT: GOTO 3000. Line 3000 will be a standard reply like \"I don't know what a \"R3$;\" is\". However, we have found the word COW and the FOR/NEXT loop is exited with K2=2. But where is the cow? 1010 IF P(K2) <> LN THEN 3010 ELSE LET P(K)=50: IN=IN+1: GOTO 3040. Line 3010 is another standard reply like \"I don't see ti here\" since P(K2)=3 and LN-2. If the player is in location 2 then the ELSE statement executes. Line 3040 is a reply. saying \"OK\". IN is the inventory count which is incremented to keep track of how many objects are being carried. 50 is an imaginary location number, which we will use for objects being carried. When the screen is updated, since P(2) now=50, location 3 will not show a cow. Condition 3 has not been checked yet however, so we must expand line 1010 to cover both that and the miscellaneous condition check: 1010 IF P(K2) <> LN THEN 3010 ELSE IF IN > 5 THEN 3020 ELSE IF C(K2) < 0 THEN 3030 ELSE LET P(K)=50: IN=IN +1: GOTO 3040. Notice that an arbitrary limit of six has been set on the total number of objects carried. C(n) is an array used as a flag for objects, and I will describe this in detail later. At this stage we can establish a convention that if C(n) is negative then for some reason the object can't be taken even though it is in the current location. Dropping an object is simpler than taking one. After \"DROP\" is decoded and K2 for the object has been set: 1100 IF P(K2) <> 50 THEN 3050 ELSE LET P(K2)-LN: IN=IN 1: GOTO 3040: REM if not carrying it say so else deposit at current location and decrement inventory. We now have quite a collection of \"standard replies:\" 3010 (reply) = \"I DON'T SEE IT HERE\": GOTO (start). 3020 (reply) = \"I'M CARRYING TOO MUCH\": GOTO (start). 3030 (reply) = \"IMPOSSIBLE!\": I was particularly pleased to receive a copy of Wizard's Mountain to review from the Software House. It is written in Basic so I was keen to see the speed and size of the game, not to mention the program listing. The speed for most commands is good after hitting enter there is only a slight delay before the response. Written by Jeremy Zorwold, the setting is a mountainside castle with a number of well described rooms. Objects appear at different locations each time the game is played, making for multiple solutions. Some of these objects look very much like treasure but seemed to incur a nega tive score when carried. Frequently and without warning it gets dark and one's legs are often paralysed by an evil spirit preventing movement for five turns. Among the objects are a telescope that falls to pieces for a reason 1 didn't discover and a digital watch, which when read caused the computer to break out of the program with an illegal function command error. This turned out to be because it was trying to compute the log of zero for a watch? Fascinating! BY KEITH CAMPBELL "

"Fig 1: White move Att  Fig. 2: White The second form of the horizon effect, called positive, is more subtle than the negative kind and even harder to deal with. In this case, the program plays an attractive move prematurely when it could be played later to much greater effect. In Figure 2, it is White to move and the search is being conducted to a depth of three ply. The program notices that it can play 1. P-Q7 and promote the Pawn next move if Black does not play 1....NxP; then after 2. NxN, White has gained further material Unfortunately, this leaves White with only Bishop and Knight to checkmate the lone Black King, very difficult. If instead White were to play 1. B-K5 followed by 2. B-Q4 White would win the Black Knight without giving up the Pawn, with a simple win based on promoting the Pawn. The program insists on winning material immediately, because if it does not do so within the horizon of the search the gain of material does not exist. In practical play, examples constantly occur not necessarily involving any gain of material where it is much better to delay playing a strong move, folFig. 3: White 14 move Last month I demonstrated the use of the minimax algorithm which finds a move in any position by looking a few moves ahead and assigning values to each of the positions which can arise at the end of such an analysis. Each \"half-move\" looked ahead in the game tree is called a ply. Thus, if White is to move, a five-ply search would examine sequences of three moves for White and two for Black. This month I consider the horizon effect, a phenomenon which arises because a program is effectively blind beyond the limits of its analysis, i.e. its search horizon. The term \"horizon effect\" was introduced into the computer chess literature by Hans Berliner, a strong U.S. master and former world correspondence champion, in his Ph.D. thesis which appeared in 1974. However, the effect had been noticed as long ago as 1952. I can best illustrate it by quoting — with slight changes two examples given by Berliner himself. In figure 1, it is White to move. He is a piece ahead but cannot avoid losing his Bishop. Suppose that White is searching four ply ahead. The program will consider trying to save its Bishop by 1. B-QN3 but after 1.... P-B5; 2. P-KR3 (say). PxB; the Bishop would be lost anyway. Eventually the program would consider 1. P-K5 and recognise that if now 1.... PxB; then 2. PxN is good for White. However, if Black were to play (his best move) 1.... PxP; White would play 2. B-N3 and there would be no way for Black to capture the Bishop in one move. Thus, within the four-ply search horizon, White would have saved his Bishop for only a Pawn! Of course, this is absurd, since Black could still win the Bishop by 2.... P-B5. All White would have achieved would be to delay the dreaded moment by a completely worthless sacrifice of a itt    is concerned, events more than four-ply in the future do not exist, so it will happily play 1. P-K5. Unfortunately, after 1. P-K5, PxP, White is again faced with the loss of a Bishop in four-ply. To avoid this, it might consider a further sacrifice by 2. P-B4 or even 2. RxB, but again this could simply make matters worse eventually. This is the negative horizon effect, the attempt to avert some unavoidable consequence. In this particular case, a deeper search would prevent the wrong first move being made. However, shifting the horizon cannot eliminate the horizon effect, just \"bury\" it more deeply. is greater than its execution\". Finally, here is another example of the negative horizon effect from a game between Chess 4.4 and Tree Frog from the Sixth North American Computer Chess Championship (1975) Figure 3 shows the position after Black's 12th move. White had an indefensible Pawn on the seventh rank. However, since it gave a high value to such Pawns, White tried to save it for as long as possible by playing the sequence 13. P-KR3, B-KB4; 14. P-QR3, B-B4; 15. P-KN4. These moves delayed the recapture of the Pawn, but only for another few moves and at the cost of ruining the Kingside Pawn structure.  By Max Bramer "

The percentage signs are necessary in Atom Basic to indicate floating point variables and calculations. The final figure shows a pattern created by shifting and rotating a simple four line shape. Moving your graphic shapes around on the screen can be a lot simpler than most computer books would have you believe. A shape can be drawn by joining up a set of points and stored by storing the positions of all these points. Once a shape is stored, it can be transformed in carious ways, like shifting, scaling or rotating it before it is plotted again. The transformation processes are interesting in themselves, but they also form the basis for many of the more advanced applications involving computer graphics, such as animated graphics and computer-aided design. With the vertical column positions of the points in the shape stored in an array, XX, and the corresponding horizontal row positions stored in the same order in an array, YY, as shown in lines 30 and 40 of the accompanying program, the shape can be drawn by lines 60 and 70. Transformations of a shape can be achieved quite simply. Books on computer graphics are inclined to introduce fairly sophisticated matrix methods for transformations, but they can be achieved with the use of arithmetics and some simple trigonometry To illustrate this, a shape can be moved to the right by increasing the column positions of all its points by the same amount. The effect on a single point is illustrated in the first figure. Similarly, movement to the left is achieved by decreasing all the column positions by a fixed amount. Movement up and down the screen is achieved by changing the row positions of all the points in the shape, while a combination of a sideways movement with an up and down movement gives a shift in any 68 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 0 COLUMN POSITION, XX other direction to the shape. This is also illustrated by the first figure. A shape can be scaled by multiplying all the row positions and all the column positions by a constant scaling factor. If the scaling factor exceeds one, the shape is magnified: if it is less than one, the shape is reduced in size Rotation is a little more difficult to achieve than shifting or scaling. The location of a point after it has been rotated through an angle, aa, is shown in the second figure. The expression giving the location of the transformed point can be obtained by using the properties of rightangled triangles. The following program, written for the Acorn Atom in its high-resolution graphics mode, stores and plots a square, and then interactively accepts commands to transform it before plotting it again. The inputs T, S and R, respectively, cause a translation, or shift, a scaling, and a rotation.

"By TED BALL PRACTICAL PRACTICAL PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING Y TED BALL meaning, called \"exclusive or\" is a separate function usually abbreviated as EXOR or XOR. XY X AND Y FF FT TRUTH IS NOT AS SIMPLE. TF TT XOR Y XY FF FT TF The actual values assigned to True and False vary but are usually and 0 or -l and 0. In many cases, although I or -1 is assigned For True the BASIC will accept any non-zero value as meaning True, so that 10 LET A = 100 20 IF A THEN PRINT \"TRUE\" would output TRUE when run. The logical functions may also be applied to numbers and variables, or to a mixture of numbers, variable and relational expressions. For example, LET X = (Y AND (Y>Z) may be a valid expression. However, the result depends on the particular Basic which evaluates the expression. In ZX81 BASIC such expressions are evaluated as follows: X AND Y is X if Y is not 0 O if Y is 0 X OR Y is 1 if Y is not 0 X if Y is 0 NOT X is O if X is not 0 1 if X is 0 X NOT X F COMPOUND CONDITIONS We can use compound conditions in IF ... THEN ... statements, for example: 100 IF (A>0) OR (B>0) THEN 500 200 IF (AMB) AND (B>C) THEN 500 Honesty may be the best policy in life but in computing, truth can be the cause of a few problems. George Boole ran into some of these problems in the True and False statements. Boolean algebra is fundamental to computing and is among the first topics covered in the study of computer hardware and assembly language programming. Boolean algebra is not often covered in courses on Basic, but because the subject is so fundamental it has applications in Basic programming and most dialects of Basic include the Boolean (or logical) functions AND, OR, NOT. A Boolean expression has one of the values True or False, and is usually met in Basic in IF ... THEN ... statements. IF condition THEN statement creates a branch in the program, with a different path taken according to the condition being True or False. The condition is usually a simple expression as in IF A=B THEN ... or IF X$=\"YES\" THEN ..., but sometimes a branch will depend on more than one condition and the logical functions provide the means for combining multiple conditions into a single compound condition. If X and Y are conditions we can form the compound conditions NOT X, X AND Y, X OR Y whose values are shown in the tables. Note that NOT and AND behave just as in ordinary English; NOT True is False and NOT False is True; X AND Y is True only when X and Y are simultaneously True. \"Or\" in English, however, is ambiguous. It may mean one or the other, or both, as in \"I don't like cabbage or spinach\". In logic, the first meaning, called \"inclusive or\" has been taken as OR, while the second These can be written without the logical functions, as: 100 IF A>O THEN 500 110 IF B>O THEN 500 200 IF A<=B THEN 220 210 IF B>C THEN 500 220... It is often possible to write a compound condition whose meaning is immediately obvious, but is not at all easy to understand when converted to a sequence of simple conditions. For example, it is clear that: 100 IF ((A>B) AND (B>C)) OR (AB) AND (B<C)) THEN 500 tests for A,B,C, being in ascending or descending order, but the equivalent: 100 IF A<=B THEN 110 105 IF B>C THEN 500 110 IF A >=B THEN 120 115 IF BC THEN 500 is not at all easy to follow and would probably require some pencil and paper work before its meaning was understood. Some Basics allow a truth value to be assigned to a variable, for example: 10 LET A=(B=C) 20 LET A=(B>0) This is covered in the ZX81 manual, which gives examples of how these expressions can be used in programs. Microsoft Basic, which is used in most personal computers, evaluates logical expressions in a totally different way. It requires that the numbers involved be integers between --32768 and 32767 (so that they can be represented in binary with 16 bits), and the result is obtained by applying the appropriate function to corresponding bits. For example, 12 AND 10 is evaluated as 8, because: 12 in binary is 0000000000001100 10 in binary is 0000000000001010; applying the AND function (as in the truth table, with 1 for T and 0 for F) we get 0 AND 0 = 0 in the first 12 places, then 1 AND 1 = 1, 70 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"| NOW TRY THE PROGRAM 1 AND O = 0, 0 AND 1 = 1, 0 ANDO = 0. Collecting these together we get the answer 0000000000001000 in binary, which is 8 in decimal. Negative numbers in binary are represented in a form known as \"2s complement\". To negate a binary number we change the Os to ls and the ls to Os and then add 1 (addition in binary is very simple: 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, 1+1=1 and carry 1). For example, to calculate -12: 12 in binary is 0000000000001 100 changing Os to ls and ls to Os gives 1111111111110011 and adding 1: 1111111111110100 To see that this is sensible we can add 12 to 12: 0000000000001100 +1111111111110100 10000000000000000 We actually get a l in the 17th place, but because we are working with 16 bit numbers this 17th bit is ignored and the result is then zero, as we could expect. The demonstration program will print out decimal and binary values which will allow you to see how X AND Y is evaluated for any pair of values. The program can easily be altered to work with OR NOT, or any other logical function. The program uses most of the features discussed above, and studying how it works should help you to understand the logical functions in Basic. The 16 bit AND function is used in line 620 to test the individual bits of the number X which is to be converted to binary. P is always a power of 2 and has one bit set to l and all other bits 0. Since b and 0=0 and 6 AND 1=b, whatever the value of the bit b, X AND P will be l when X has a lin the same position as the single 1 in P, and zero otherwise. 100 PRINT\" \"AND' FUNCTION DEMONSTRATOR\" 110 PRINT 120 INPUT \"FIRST ARGUMENT\"; AI 130 LET X = Al 140 GOSUB 500 150 IF E THEN 120 160 INPUT \"SECOND ARGUMENT\": A2 170 LET X=A2 180 GOSUB 500 190 IF E THEN 160 200 LET X=A1 210 GOSUB 600 220 LET A1$=X$ 230 LET X=A2 240 GOSUB 600 250 LET A2$=X$ 260 LET X=AI AND A2 270 GOSUB 600 280 LET A$=X$ 290 PRINT AI;\"AND\";A2;\"=\":A1 AND A2 300 PRINT 310 PRINT AI:TAB(8);\"IN BINARY IS\";A1$ 320 PRINT A2;TAB(8);\"IN BINARY IS\";A2$ 330 PRINT AL AND A2;TAB(8): \"IN BINARY IS\":A$ 340 PRINT 350 PRINT 360 GOTO 120 499 REM CHECK VALIDITY OF INPUT 500 LET E = 0 510 IF (X=INT(X)) AND (X>=-32768)AND(X<=32767) THEN RETURN 520 PRINT\" ARGUMENT MUST BE AN INTEGER BETWEEN -32768 and 32767\" 530 LET E = 1 540 RETURN 599 REM CONVERT X TO 16 BIT BINARY STRING X$ 600 LET X$ = 610 LET P = 1 620 LET B = X AND P 630 LET B$ = \"O\" 640 IF B THEN LET B$ = \"1\" 650 LET X$ = B$ = X$ 660 LET P = P + P 670 IF P = 32768 THE LET P = -P 680 IF P <> -65536 THEN GOTO 620 690 RETURN COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 71 "


"SOPHISTICATED STRINGS The new generation of computers are equipped with quite sophisticated sound facilities. Last month I dealt with the production of simple tones. With this technique an electronic organ can be set up using the computer keyboard as playing keys Computers such as the Sharp MZ-80K contain a simple onboard sound generator which can output notes via a small speaker which is also built in. Basic commands are provided in the operating system which control the sound generator directly. The system is limited to single notes and covers only three octaves but it is extremely easy to use. A tune is entered into a string variable as a series of notes to be sounded as they appear in the music, A-G. The octave to be used is marked by a simple graphic symbol and the length of notes by the number 0-9, O being a 1/32nd note and 9, a whole note. Rests are entered directly into the string as R. Tempo is set by a Basic statement; TEMPO=, followed by a number. To play the tune set up in M$. one now enters the Basic word Music=MS and away it goes! Because the system is resident in Basic, many strings can be set up and played in any order and they can be repeated by enclosing them in a loop. Older generation computers like the Pet and Nascom can all be made to act as music generators in the same way but, because no Basic commands are in-built, the user has to set up his own system. This is now fairly easy as so much software exists which does just that. When we come to discuss the production of more than one note at a time, things obviously become much more complicated. However, this objective can be achieved in several ways. 72 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES The computer can be used to control an existing external synthesiser or a specially designed sound generating circuit. Keyboards may also be used with an interface which drives the computer and uses it as a music maker. Such methods might appeal to those with an existing synthesiser but tend to be very expensive indeed. But what about music actually generated by the computer itself? New computers such as the Dai and the B.B.C. coniputer are provided with sound generating chips on board which are capable of generating three or four notes at once Sophisticated operating systems are included by means of which different sound voices can be used to represent various instruments. This is helped by a facility which changes the note envelope — the time a note takes to build up, how long it stays at maximum and how fast it decays away. Music produced by one of these computers sounds bright and lively and has depth and harmony as required. The operating software is complicated but easy to use once it is understood. The amount of information required by the computer to play even a simple tune is quite vast and the less you know about music, the more user friendly such a program must become. Ultimately it should be possible to enter a piece of music into the computer from a music manuscript without knowing anything about music at all! The Atari computer is one of those supplied with a built-in sound generator capable of producing four notes at once. Such a provision might be useful to those of us who could write programs to control it. However, Atari have supplied a software package aimed at music makers and music dunces alike. It is very user friendly and takes the \"musician\" through the inputting of information in easy stages. A wide variety of control is possible including: key signature, tempo, meter and volume. Music is entered phrase by phrase. Each phrase is remembered and can later be recalled to be played. Phrases can be repeated in a set order. Entering a phrase is done direct onto the screen by using the A-G notation of ordinary music. Accidental sharps and flats, changes of octave, note durations, dotted notes, bars, ties and slurs are all catered for. Once entered, notes can be added, deleted or transposed and the phrase can be played to check how it sounds. Finally, the whole composition can be played by joining the phrases together. The tune can be monitored on the screen, all four notes will play but only one can be visualised. An experienced musician could find a few faults with the system like the number of phrases available (10) is very limiting — but on the whole a good example of how to present a complex problem in a simple friendly way. How can owners of computers which do not have such facilities achieve like results? Well, by using a digital-to-analogue converter such as the ZN425E, or an even simpler resistor network, it is possible to emulate all the above. Things are made much easier by commercial packages which are now available for many computers. These range from the Alpha Syntauri system for the Apple at a few hundred pounds, to the very versatile and inexpensive Visible Music Monitor for the Pet. The latter is supplied complete with plug-in board containing a D/A converter, filters and small amplifier with provision made for feeding the output to a more powerful one. Once such systems become available, whole libraries of music soon accumulate on tape and disc contributed to by home enthusiasts. BY DAVID ANNAL "

"DOWN TO BASIC DOWN JUMPING TO NEW LINES BY MOIRA NORRIE THE POWER OF IF ... above, I can give the general format of a condition as: arith. expr.) relational operator) arith. expr.) A relational operator is a mathematical sign used when comparing two values and can be one of: < less than <= less than or equal to > greater than greater than or equal to = equal to <> not equal to To illustrate these formats, I will now give a selection of examples of IF statements. (Note that each line is a separate example and this is not intended to be considered linked in some way as part of a program!) 30 IF X=O THEN 120 90 IF A+B <=C+D THEN 10 85 IF INT(6*RND+1)<>6 THEN The GOTO statement, also introduced last month, takes the general form (line number) GOTO (line number Again, the first line number simply labels the GOTO statement. The second line number specifies the line to which the computer should jump. The GOTO statement is referred to as an \"unconditional jump\" as the jump will always take place. On its own, the GOTO statement is not of much use. However, used in conjunction with the IF statement, it can be used to set up alternative sections within a program. 20 SOLVING A PROBLEM Notice that, as a result of an IF \"It\", so the saying goes, is one of the most powerful words in the English language. And the same is true of the Basic language. Last month, I introduced the IF statement with the example: 10 IF RND<0.5 THEN 40 I explained the operation of this statment as follows: if the condition RND 0.5 is true, then the computer will \"jump\" to line 40; if the condition is not true, then the jump will be ignored and the computer will continue with the line following the IF statement. In general, an IF statement will have the following format: (line number) IF condition) THEN (line number The method I have used for describing the general format of the IF statement is commonly used in programming. The parts enclosed in angular brackets, e.g. condition), are descriptions of what should be placed in that part of the IF statement. The parts not enclosed in angular brackets, e.g. IF, indicate exactly what must be placed in that part of the IF statement. The first line number is simply the line number that must appear at the beginning of every line of a Basic program. The second line number is the number of the line that the computer will \"jump\" to if the condition specified is true. What sort of conditions can be tested for in an IF statement? A condition will involve the comparison of two arithmetic expressions. In my earlier example, the value of \"RND\" would be compared with the value 0.5. If the value of \"RND\" turned out to be less than 0.5, then the condition would be realised. Using the method described 76 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES statement, the computer may \"jump\" either \"forwards\" or \"backwards\" in a program it will simply jump to the line specified in the IF statement, wherever that might be. Many version of Basic allow more advanced forms of the IF statement. Rather than \"jumping\" to another section of the program if the condition is true, it may be possible to specify a simple action to be performed, e.g. printing a message. In some e.g. print versions, it is possible to specify alternative actions to be performed depending upon whether the condition is true or false — all within a single IF statement. These forms will be discussed later in the series. By looking at a simple example, I will demonstrate the steps involved in writing a program. First, let's look at the problem. \"In a sponsored walk, each entrant is given a number in the range 1 to 100. The entrants are all sponsored at a rate of 25p per km for the first 15km, and 50p per km beyond that. Write a program that could be used to print the amount earned by each entrant.\" I can start with the general program outline repeat for each entrant input data print results end repeat For each entrant, I will need a pair of data values the entrant number and the distance walked. The statement of the problem specifies that the entrant number will be in the range 1 to 100 and, clearly, the distance walked must be a positive number. However, it is not stated whether that number must be an integer, or, if it can be any real positive real number e.g. would the pair of values 25,12.5 be acceptable? I will assume that real numbers are acceptable, but, strictly speaking, I should say that the statement of the problem does not "


"ç ! W SPONSORED provide all the information required! Now that I have decided upon the format of the data for each entrant, I will require some way of determining when the end of the data is reached so that the computer will repeat the \"loop\" the correct number of times. If I knew that there were to be exactly 100 entrants, then I could use a FOR loop to control the number of times that the loop would be repeated. But we do not know exactly how many entrants will take part. Although the statement of the problem says that each entrant will have a number in the range 1 to 100, there is nothing to say that there will be exactly 100 entrants. In fact, a sponsored run would involve someone in a lot of counting to determine how many turn out. It is easier to keep typing data until there is no more; then type in some preset value which will stand out from the normal data, so that the computer will stop looping. This special value is called a \"terminating value\" since it marks the end of the data. In most practical situations, some value can be found which would never occur in the data for processing. For example, in the case of the sponsored walk, an entrant number of I would never occur we could therefore use this as a \"terminating value\". As I will input pairs of values in the program, I will also provide a \"dummy value\" of 0 for the distance walked by \"entrant number-1\". will and then amount earned = D*0.25 otherwise amount earned = 15*0.25 + (D-15) *0.5 where the amount earned is in pounds. The STOP statement is similar to the END statement in that the program will stop running when it is encountered. However, unlike the END statement it does not have to be the last statement in a program -it can occur at any point in the program. The above program could be improved in many ways. For example, the results would be a lot clearer if they were printed in a table rather than being mixed in with the input data. AND FINALLY — THE PROGRAM THE GENERAL OUTLINE NEXT ISSUE MORE INPUT Having developed the outline of my program, I am now in a position to write the program itself. 10 REM SPONSORED WALK 20 REMN IS THE ENTRANT NO. 30 REM D IS THE DISTANCE WALKED 40 REM 50 PRINT \"WHAT IS ENTRANT NO. AND DISTANCE WALKED\" 60 INPUT ND IF N=-1 THEN 130 80 IF D<15 THEN 110 PRINT 15*0.25 + (D-15)*0.5, \"POUNDS\" GOTO 50 110 PRINT D*0.25, \"POUNDS\" GOTO 50 130 END If your computer does not use END statements, then replace line 130 by 130 STOP 70 I can now develop the general program outline as follows: input entrant no., distance walked if entrant no. = -1 then (end of program) print amount earned goto (input data) end How can I calculate the amount earned by an entrant? Assume that the entrant no. is N and the distance walked is D. then the amount earned by entrant N will be determined by: if D < 15 In the program for the sponsored walk, the data for each entrant consisted of a number followed by the distance walked. It would be convenient in such a situation if the name of the entrant could also be input so that it could be printed next to the amount earned for easy identification. Next month, I will describe how this can be done using \"string variables\". 90 100 120 NEXT ISSUE COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 77 "

"Kit Korner CIRCUIT TRAINING If chips are included in the design you are strongly advised to use holders, which conveniently fit into the O.lin. pitch holes. It should be possible to bend the legs of the holder outwards to be soldered to pins inserted along the side of the chip. This secures the holder onto the board. When you come to making connections across the board, between pins, it is advisable to use insulated wire of different colours. It makes it much easier to follow the circuit if you can use particular colours for each line of the design, not only for power lines, but for data lines as well. This applies to all types of construction as a few circuits sort out the layout. A special track cutter is available but a drill bit will do just as well. If necessary, components, can be laid along the tracks, so long as the track is cut between the leads. Yes, it has happened that all the components have been laid along the tracks without them being cut. For some reason the circuit did not work! Make sure that the chip holders, if they are used, are laid across the tracks and that the tracks are cut between the pins. Again, the use of a drawing or diagram would be helpful. Until you become proficient at designing board layout you will always use more board than you really need. This is unavoidable Over the next two issues I am going to move slightly away from actual kit building, to look at prototyping your own designs or those that you may find elsewhere. It is helpful to know from the very beginning which is the best way of developing your ideas into a working circuit. Depending on the complexity of the circuit and its function there is an ideal means of construction. There are, of course, other factors to consider, such as cost and availability and also how involved you want to get. I will try to cover all the methods but there will probably be one or two obscure types I will miss. Many years ago I built a bridge rectifier with a dropper resistor on a group panel. It was very crude but as I had to dissipate a lot of heat it was an ideal way as I could hang the strip of high power diodes and resistors in a draught to cool it. The group panel, by the way, is simply a parallel line of solder tags formed onto a piece of insulating material The next stage up is probably the matrix board. This is just a piece of insulating board with an array of holes, of various dimensions, set 0. lin. apart, into which pins are inserted. By drawing your circuit out on paper you can arrange the pins at the point of each join of the components. For complicated circuits the components can be arranged on both sides of the board. Please do not make the mistake of wrapping the component leads around the pins as it makes it extremely difficult to unsolder them later on, if you need to redesign the circuit or re-use the components. A simple lap joint will do. Also, take care not to push the pins in too far as you will fracture the board. If the board is to be well used, a drop of solder on the underside of it will prevent the pins from working loose. will be impossible to trace unless they are colour-coded. Up market from the matrix board, in some respects, is the stripboard. Like the matrix, the stripboard is just a variable array of holes, set at 0.lin. pitch in an insulating board, but with a very distinct difference. On one side of the board are bonded strips of copper conductor. The components can therefore be soldered onto the board without the use of pins, although these are useful as terminal and test points. Care must be taken to cut the tracks in the right places. Drawing the circuit out on, preferably. 0.lin. graph paper will help you to begin wit to overcome this probler. ghtly, try to redraw the circuit a few times on paper as you intend it to appear on the board. It will give you some experience in alternative design, if nothing else, and you may discover a more rational layout. Next month I will endeavour to deal with wire-wrapping and the use of Eurocard type circuit boards. Unlike the two types of board mentioned here, which are discrete component orientated, the Eurocards are biased towards circuits with large numbers of chips. See you then. BY KEITH MOTI "

WILSON 9 COTSWOLD TERRACE, CHIPPING NORTON, OXON For those of you who have never heard of Rubik's Cube, apply to the Guinness Book of Records and move to the next review. For the rest of you, here is the computerised cube! This program not only solves the cube as you watch, but also lets you play with the cube yourself. Since I have never yet solved a cube, watching the computer solve it, is both interesting and demoralising. The standard of the display is exceptional. The screen presents you, in colour, with a 3-D view of your cube, a view of each of the six sides, a view of the side to be turned showing position before and after the turn, and all the moves made so far in normal cube notation. The instructions are short and clear, but do require reading fully before using the program. To enter the state of the cube you have been trying to solve for weeks is simple; just key in the colour of each position on each face. The program prompts clearly and a seven-year-old had no problem with it at all. How much you enjoy the program will depend on how much you like the cube. As an alternative to the cube there are certain disadvantages you can't easily throw it at the wall quite like a regular cube! As an example of how easy to use a good program should be, I place it top of the list. It runs on a 48K Apple under DOS 3.2 or 3.3, but supplies and price are not yet finalised in the U.K. BEAM ME UP SCOTTY AND SPEEDWAY ADULT GAMES !! \\ON CASSETTE Can of Worms  8 GAMES ACNE, VASECTOMY, SMUT, DOLE, HITLER ROYAL FLUSH, REAGAN, Ps & Os Love &Death  8 GAMES SEDUCTION CONCEPTION BIRTH RUBIC'S PUBE, ON THE JOB.POX, DEATH GOD * The Bible  10 GAMES GENESIS, ADAM & EVE NOAH PLAGUES OF EGYPT, EXODUS.

To make things worse, these monsters are sometimes invisible! Occasionally, your man panics, and it can take both skill and luck to prevent him running into a monster or obstacle. The comprehensive instructions are very well presented within the program, and imaginative use is made of the graphics. The program runs on a 16K Nascom 2 with ROM Basic and graphics, represents good value for money at .00, from Futura Software of Chelmsford. On the same tape comes Speedway, a racing game for up to three players, including a one-player practice mode. The object is to try and complete as many laps as possible before crashing into another player, the track boundary, or one of the hazards which appear at random. Varying road conditions and hazard difficulty level are selected at the start of the game. The controls are difficult to get used to each player has two keys to steer in four directions and the bikes are slow to respond to changes in direction With three players on the track, it is a challenge to complete even one lap!

ADULT ONLY VIDEO CLUB SNAPPER MINOTAUR, BABIES day or evenings cheap tatel Ring: 0373: 830563 | or send coupon to: VIDEO CLUB 1.DREWSTEAD RD., LONDON S.W.16 Please send FREE details, I am over 18 NAME... ADDRESS PHONE ... This is the ninth and probably the best games pack from Acornsoft so far. All the games on this cassette use graphics and sound effects to the utmost showing just what can be achieved on the Atom through skilful programming. The first game, Snapper, is a variation of the arcade game \"Mazeman\", mentioned in the November issue of Computer and Video Games. However, the game has been simplified to fit it on a standard Atom. These simplifications include changing the \"ghosts\" and your man into circles (they are in fact in colour if you've got the colour encoder board fitted), and the simplification of the rules (you don't get fruit in this version) If you haven't seen the arcade version of the game, then here's how to play. The basic object of the game is to eat as many ghosts as you can while your mouth is open (if your mouth is shut when you catch one, it eats youl). To open your mouth you must go over one of the corner crosses. Then you have a limited amount of time before it shuts again. The graphics are good and are backed up by excellent sound effects. The second game, Minotaur has impres. sive graphics too. The object of the game is to take all the gold bars from the boxes scattered around the maze, and to put them in the safe while trying to avoid meeting the minotaur who tries to catch and eat you. All this is done with 3-D pictures of the passages and the various objects in them. However, if you get completely lost, then you can call up a map of the labyrinth telling you where everything is. You can also mark the floor with a big cross so that you can remember where you've been. The game is very difficult to win and it ends either when you have put all five bars in the safe, or when you have been eaten by the minotaur. The scoring for this game is to put it mildly, odd, since you may often end up with a negative number of points. This game also has sound effects telling you how far away the minotaur is he growls when he gets close. When eaten, the minotaur just sits there in front of you smiling and winking. He doesn't actually look too convincing but that's only a small point which doesn't detract at all from the excellence of the game as a whole. The third and last game, Babies, is an exact copy of the hand held game with the L.C.D. display in which babies jump out of a burning building. You must catch them on your stretcher and bounce them off the end of the screen before they fall to their deaths. Three are allowed to die before the game ends This games pack is excellent value for money and I was very tempted to play the games rather than write the review!

"RD ROOM TO GROW The Atom uses the 6502 microprocessor which is the same chip used in the Apple, Pet and the BBC microcomputer. Memory capacity starts with a minimum of 1K RAM which can be expanded to 12K by adding chips. Expansion to 32K is achieved by adding an extra Eurocard inside the Atom case and then you have to buy a 19in rack which is expensive. ROM starts at 8K and goes up to 16K on board, with extra expansion available as with the RAM chips. The power supply needed to run an Atom is eight volts at 800 mA each for the minimum system. Acorn can supply the power unit which feeds the internal regulator. For the maximum system you need an external regulator supply. A cassette interface port allows you to connect a cassette recorder for loading and storing information, and a printer output port for attaching a printer The Atom has sound capability via a loudspeaker which allows the generation of tones of any frequency. The Atom is made by Acorn Computer Ltd. and is available in kit form or ready built. Direct from Acorn it costs  for the 2K assembled or  for the kit. A \"full\"' Atom has 12K memory and costs  from Acorn. It is designed to plug into a television set and the Atom comes complete with Basic manual, U.H.F. television lead. A power supply cost .20) and a cas sette lead (.50) are important extras. The machine, which was launched in mid-1980, has proved popular with games players because of its high resolution graphics but also has business and educational applications. Hardware and software is available from Acorn Computers and its associated company Acornsoft, which shares its address at 4a Market Hill, Cambridge CB2 3NJ. The prices quoted above are Acorn's, but its large dealer network will sell the equipment much cheaper. colour coverter board about  each. The highest mode is more than adequate for reproducing arcade-type games and the more sedate displays required by strategy games. For example: Acornsoft has designed a version of Kensington which fits on the Atom screen Sound is available from a single bit on an output port and the user must write a machine code program to generate noises very easy as the Atom has built-in assembler the manual contains a machine code program to impersonate a harpsicord. Volume and quality from the internal speaker leaves a lot to be desired, however the sound output is available on one of the pins on the din socket which the cassette uses. A seven pin din plug will connect it to an amplifier BASIC PROBLEM GAMES PEOPLE interactive type. A radar game, Early Warning, is its most successful. Team 4 Software (12 Taunton House, Redcar Road, Harold Hill, Romford, Essex) offers Space Invaders and Shapemaker, an etch-a-sketcher which enables you to draw and store your own graphics. . Computer Concepts is at 16 Wayside, Chipperfield, Hertfordshire. It produces a small range of software for the Atom including Invaders, a sound effects program, an alarm clock program and a program to increase the number of text lines and characters on the screen. GOOD GRAPHICS Independent software supplies have not been slow to support the Atom and a large range of games is available for the machine. Acornsoft produces 12 games packs which contain three games on each cassette and costs .50 inclusive of VAT. The company claims to be able to turn any arcade craze into an Atom game in a matter of months. One example is the game of Snapper, which recreates the popular Pacman game this shares a cassette with Minotaur and Babies. Also available are three Atom adventures and a chess playing program. Among the other Atom games software suppliers are:  Program Power (5 Wensley Road, Leeds LS7 2LX) has a range of about 30 games, from adventures to the arcade type. Astro Birds, Invader Force and 3D Asteriods are its best sellers. Bug Byte (98-100 The Albany, Old Hall Street, Liverpool L3 9EP) offers some 19 games, including the arcade and simulation-type. 747 is a flightsimulation program which along with Invaders and Galaxian, is its most popular cassette. . Hopesoft (Hope Cottage, Winterbourne, Newbury, Berkshire) at present has six games concentrating more on the adventure type. Of the arcade variety it offers an elementary Pacman game called Chaser and Space Invaders. Atom Adventure is its best seller. A & F Software (10 Wilpshire Avenue, Longsight, Manchester M12 5TL) produces four games for the Atom of the The Atom manual contains all the information necessary to produce your own graphics and sound for games playing Graphics capabilities depend on the memory available. A minimum Atom has 1K of V.D.U. RAM, half of which is used for storing text. But this can be expanded up to 6KV.D.U. and 5K text space which is the maximum configuration on the board. The Atom has nine graphic modes dependent on memory: Mode Resolution Memory One of the main criticisms levelled at the Atom by other computer users, is that its Basic is very different from the Microsoft Basic. Among the peculiarities are the operations to carry out print formatting, floating point arithmetic and string handling. You can also use abbreviations for the most widely used command words. The string handling commands are also unusual again to conserve memory space and speed up the string manipulation operation. The Atom has an in-built assembler which enables you to produce machine code programs. Machine code can also be placed into memory and assembler statements be made part of a Basic program so that it returns control to Basic after the machine code has run. Owners of the fully expanded Atom can take advantage of the Atom Forth implementation. The Forth language is a programming language which can be implemented on microcomputers and offers high-level ways of solving a wide range of problems. It is a compiled language and programs run very quickly when you use it. The cassette contains a Forth dictionary and compiler, a tape interface/screen editor, a graphics package and a high resolution graphics demonstration. Pascal can be used with the Atom but you need extra memory to link it in with either the System 2 or 3. The Acorn Pascal package includes a compiler, an editor and an interpreter and an in-line assembler for programming critical routines. The List Processing Language (LISP) can be used on the Atom but this language is usually used when working on research programs rather than production programs. 64 -SN 333 1.5K 128 64 .5K IK 128 1K 128 128 3K 128 192 3K 4a 128 6K 256 X is the horizontal axis and Y the vertical. The \"a\" modes refer to colour which requires the floating-point ROM and the 192 192 ALL YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE "


"CORE OPTIONAL EXTRAS The Atomtel facility allows users to access massive mainframe databases via the information service Prestel. The Atomtel ROM plugs into the Floating Point ROM socket (E30), you also need a modem and Isolating Unit () and a PSU + cables (E20). A few of the Atomtel facilities are Auto Dial, Auto log-on, full Prestel character set and provision for downloading software. A USER'S VIEW A variety of peripherals are available for the Acorn, both from Acorn and other specialist firms. The Atom was designed as a cassette based system, not as a disc-based one, but in the near future Acorn is to bring out a single disc drive unit which should cost around the  mark. Acorn claims any cassette recorder can be plugged into the Atom and used to save and load programmes but the more expensive the recorder the better the per formance. Acorn markets a printer which will produce hard copy from the Atom. It is called the GP-80A and sells for . The GP-80A is a dot matrix printer and provides characters printed in single and double widths, also graphics. The 2K system needs the Atom printer drive chips which fit inside the machine's casing. These retail for . Having expanded the Atom you need a wire link from pin 17 of the 8255 chip to pin 17 of the printer connector. There are no joysticks on sale for the Atom but Atari joysticks can be converted, A booklet on the subject can be obtained from Burgaids, 32 Guithavon Road, Witham, Essex. The .50 12 page booklet also contains some Atom games programs. Additional memory boards can be bought from Acorn or Basildon-based Timedata which specialises in the Atom. You can get 1K RAM sets from Acorn for .22 each (shop around as these come a lot cheaper) and a 4K floating point ROM for .00. If you buy the 12K Atom it comes with the system. An 8K memory card is also available. It is connected inside the Atom and costs about . Timedata supplies a 16K add-on RAM for .50 and a 32K RAM board for .00. A 64K dynamic RAM card can be connected inside she Atom. It is made by Audio Computers of Southend and is available from the manufacturers or Technomatic of 17 Burnley Road, London NW10. Extra memory is not usually required for playing games on the Atom but is usually needed if the user wants to build up a large database of information. According to Acornsoft all of the games software runs perfectly on a 12K Atom. The user port on the Atom is similar to the Pet's (8 bit), so any peripheral advertised for the Pet user port can be connected to the Atom. You will need to make an adapter lead up and change the software — most manufacturers will make these alternatives available. One interesting aspect is a voice synthesiser available from Wide Band Products of Royston, Herts. Its Speakeasy unit with power supply unit and speaker for  (plus VAT) will connect to the Atom. I bought the minimum kit Atom for about  from one of the dealers. Being a dab hand with a soldering iron it took me a long evening to construct but it's not hard for beginners because the construction manual which comes with the kit version only is quite comprehensive. The keyboard is a problem so take care, but the grapevine says that a new keyboard will soon be used. I had toyed with a Pet previously so I was slightly perturbed by the reports of Atoms' peculiar Basic but within a week there was no problem. The Atoms' \"idiosyncratic\" approach to PEEK-ing, POKE-ing, print formating and string handling is not only more compact than other methods, but more logical. The floating point arithmetic is a bit complex because one has to prefix with \"F\". But you soon discover the speed advantages of Integer and only use Floating Point when you need to The extra 2114s and VIA 6522 come next and I had a fully expanded Atom and my wallet didn't notice. The beauty of the Atom is that you slowly build up and eventually you've got a hard disc-based system, with colour, Prestel, Atomtel, BBC Rom set, Wordpack, Printer, Econet and speech. And finally, one tip for those who intend to get serious use out of the Atom. Buy. build, borrow or steal a 5 volt 3 amp regulated power supply the Atom P.S.U. will support a maximum board, but if you are going to expand sooner or later you'll need it. If things go wrong, Acorn has a service department but the company is notoriously difficult to reach by phone. The Acorn Atom Magic Book is another publication on sale from Timedata. It is full of simple programs, mainly games, for the Atom and also programming tips for the amateur. The Magic Book also covers converting programs from other machine's Basic into Atom Basic, together with useful subroutine addresses contained in the ROM. The Magic Book costs .50 A book along the same lines, called Getting Acquainted With Your Atom. It is an introduction to Basic using examples of games and educational programs, as well as a section on graphics. This book is slightly more expensive costing .95 and is published by Database Consultancy of Gidea Park, Essex. For the more advanced programmer who seriously wants to learn about the subject in more depth, a book titled 6502 Assembly Language Programming by Lance Leventhal is a good buy. It's a thick book packed with information detailing standard features of assembler language and also going into the complexities, but in a readable style. The publisher is OsborneMcGraw-Hill and the price is .50 Starting Forth is useful for those who have bought Acornsoft's recently introduced Forth implementation package. Forth has generated a lot of enthusiasm amongst micro users because it is a high level language which is easily implemented on low memory systems. It was invented about 10 years ago but is just now becoming more widely accepted mainly due to the Forth Interest Group. Starting Forth is published by Forth Inc. which is owned by the language's author, Charles Moore. Acorn supplies its own documentation with every computer it sells. For the Atom this includes the Atom Manual (.00), the Basic Manual which can be used with Acorn's Systems 1, 2 and 3 and costs .50 and a sheet of information on any integrated circuit for .00. The manual which is written by David Johnson Davies of Acornsoft, also contains a section for the advanced user. BOOKING TIME Several authors have been tempted into print to give others the benefit of their Atom experiences. Acornsoft is in the throes of producing a book titled Atomic Secrets. This publication will consist of programming hints and techniques which Acornsoft's programming team has employed in producing software for the machine. It will give advice of how to get over many problems. ACORN ATOM... BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK "

"special from Computing Educational We can all help if we care enough... Many people regard computers as some form of man-made monster, heralding the advent of an era where machines are the masters of men The emergence of microcomputers in the mid-seventies has helped to overcome this misguided view of how computers will affect our lives. Each month, Educational Computing shows the tremendous advances being made in the enhancement of computers, particularly. micros, as teaching aids. In this annual issue, Learning to cope computers in special education, we look at the marvellous achievements of many very dedicated people working with disabled and mentally-handicapped children. Tremendous progress is being made in this area, brought about by a mixture of ingenuity, flexibility and determination on behalf of the manufacturers of specially-adapted products, writers of applications software, nurses and teachers putting ideas into practice and the children themselves. In our annual, we look at the latest developments in special education. You can read about the many fascinating applications of microelectronics in this field, what the people involved think and what the future holds in store. Most important of all, you can find if you can help even in a small way.
