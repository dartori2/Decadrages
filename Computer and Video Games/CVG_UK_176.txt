Only minor limitations prevent this game from being an all-round 'must have'. Among the best money can buy for your machine. These games may not be innovative, or fall into everybody's notion of ideal. They are either well produced examples of common concepts, or slightly flawed workings of originality. But they are definitely worth looking at. 2-PRETTY BAD There's something fundamentally wrong with the mechanics, or the presentation lets the game down (ie it's in a foreign language). Could still keep some people happy, but we can't wholeheartedly recommend it. 7-VERY POOR PAUL DAVIES Shhh! He's back everyone. Everybody, get back to your desks before he suspects a thing!

"computer video games NEWSO E x P O [E3 HIGHLIGHTS LES HIGHLIGHTS ever before in my life have I wanted to be in so many places at one time than E3. The greatest games from the biggest names had me staggering around, eyes swirling, arms outstretched, and fingers clutching for anything attached to a monitor screen. Any disappointments were immediately scorched into oblivion by the sheer brilliance of quality product on show. Yet the main events took place behind the scenes, as the world's premier manufacturers of video game technology schemed to undermine their competitors chances of success. LOS ANGELES '96 Before laying down the bare naked' facts, here's what I perceive to have been the undeniable highlights of the event: 1. NINTENDO 64 E3 REPORT You will be astounded the first opportunity you get to play either Wave Race 64, Super Mario 64, or Pilot Wings 64. Nintendo's new system is clearly distinguishable from LADRANK SPF Saturn or PlayStation in terms of quality starting from immediate presentation, through to extraordinary gameplay. No matter how experienced, all players approach N64 like a complete innocent unprepared for the powerful magic those three titles exude. I was, and I thought I had a pretty good idea of what was coming having played SM64 last November at Shoshinkai. How Nintendo's R&D engineered such perfection is beyond contemplation by just anyone with $300 000 to 08 24942 spend on an N64 development system. For more details turn to \"New Games\". New character Aoi floors Jacky in VF3. 2 VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 GEDOEN sum Pilot Wings 64 takes video games to new heights! SMEN The shape of things to come. Yes, in spite of the towering and noisy Sony presentation across the way, the fruits thus far of Sega's Model 3 and the AM2 team maintained the biggest crowd for any one game. Whereas all other exhibitor's products were observed while standing, many people were so beguiled that they sat respectfully on the floor for the duration of the selected routines and in many cases for repeated showings. Just as CVG reported from the ACME show a couple of months back, and detailed further last issue, I am amazed to confirm that Dural at least equals the T1000 of Terminator 2 fame in quality. And remember, this is a character who will be able to perform amazing routines in real time in direct response to a player's input! The silk on Aoi's traditional Japanese dress ripples, folds, and responds to her movements in the way real silk is perceived to behave. What's more, this new character already exudes the same powerful charisma that typifies all the VF stars. The facial expressions are swift to change, and look quite bizarre as a result (Pai Chan's toothy grin for example, but these nuances serve to substantiate the personalities even more. I'd like to clarify that the appearance of all the fighters in the demonstration is still quite hard edged and obviously constructed of multiple parts. Especially in the Jeffry routine in which the man's muscles are flexed, where his chest expands and the separation between his body and limbs is obvious. Plus his chest is clearly built to sit on top of his abdomen, as opposed to giving the impression that this giant's body is wrapped in a seemless layer of skin. The illusion, however, is better than anything ever created for an interactive situation. I almost cried tears of joy when I saw it. "

"computer video games THE SILICON GRAPHICS TOUCH NEWS O [ HARDWAR! ] TREASURE CHESTTHE NINTENDO 64: 64DD While Nintendo of America are keen to promote N64 as The Fun Machine, Co-developers Silicon Graphics prefer a more corporate approach. On May 15 NOA had a revolutionary new games system to promote Silicon Graphics, on the other hand, revealed \"Reality Immersion Technology\" as part of the debut of Nintendo 64 home video game system. Wow! Same thing different perspective.

"computer vided games SATURN \"3D\" PAD REVEALED (TINY SHINY GAME BOY ] A nice little surprise at the show was the Game Boy Pocket, which is 30% smaller and slimmer than its older brother. It's essentially the same piece of kit, only the screen clarity is improved, and power consumption has been reduced to just two AAA batteries, as opposed to four AA types. This sleek matte silver model launches July 21 in Japan, with September set aside for the US. It may be smaller, but the price is still at large at $59.95. Game Boy Pocket is so far unconfirmed for UK release. SEGA SATURN Sega chose the week of E3 to unveil their new analogue controller for the Saturn. It will be bundled with the NIGHTS game, with release dates set for 7 July in Japan, and 20 September in the US. If you want one on its own, the price is 3800 Yen (approx $25 US). which should translate directly to  in the UK. The crucial component the 3D controller is obviously different in style and placement to N64's centre mounted 3D stick. On its own, the analogue pad works well and lends a fantastic new feel to NIGHTS. However the crucial difference is that both controllers cannot function simultaneously. Nintendo's can. Limitations aside, the 3D pad is set to boost the appeal of other flight and race games on Saturn. Plus the flimsy shoulder buttons on the US and British pads can finally be given up in favour of the cool triggers replacements. Overall then, the Sega Saturn Analogue Controller has potential to give Saturn games the edge over PlayStation. But . Nintendo need not worry too much. The switch at the bottom of the controller's face toggles between the D-pad and the 3D pad. A Tiny or what! Got to have it. SPIELBERG AND MICROSOFT PRESENTS.. SILICON VALLEY FINALLY FINDS ITS PERFECT PARTNERS As expected, Microsoft had enough Software at E3 to fill this entire magazine. Their extensive range of product all comes from third-party developers, and totals in excess of 100 titles. Of course CVG will be keeping you informed as and when they reach fruition and when we have more space! Meantime the most notable partnership announced was that between Bill Gates and the Stephen Spielberg directed operation: DreamWorks Interactive. E3 SPECIAL REPORT NEWS DREAMWORKS This major undertaking has been in progress since last Autumn, and brings together three colossal names in the entertainment industry: Stephen Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen. Spielberg is of course valuable for his amazing contribution to Hollywood, while Jeffrey Katzenberg is erstwhile president of The Walt Disney Company. David Geffen is responsible for pioneering a hugely successful music, and film publishing company. These people have been busy hiring established game developers such as Doug Ten Napel, who created much of the EarthWorm Jim universe for Shiny Entertainment. The Neverhood: A Curious Wad of Klay Finds His Soul Doug TenNapel's game is an animated clay adventure game. Puzzles play a major role and, as you might expect coming from Ten Napel, it's pretty weird: The objective is to help the hero Klaymen defend The Neverhood from an evil magical creature called Klogg. No, I'm not making this up! Goosebumps: Escape From Horrorland Based on a book by R.L. Stine, and the top rated \"Goosebumps\" TV show in the US. Goosebumps is like the Twilight Zone for eight-year-olds and is very popular. This exploration game stars Jeff Goldblum and Isabella Rossellini, and allows 'players' to interact with typical Goosebumps scenarios. The production values are tremendous. Of all the projects Bill Gates has deemed worthy of association with Microsoft, I expect that the DreamWorks library will take on greater significance within the entertainment industry as a whole. Here's how the first line up is shaping up. Lets Get Cookin' Okay, this one's aimed at 4-7 year olds. Which isn't you I know, but Spielberg had a hand in this \"magical, musical activity centre\" and thought you'd like to see something of it... It's about cooking food with talking utensils, by the way. 11 BLACK OUT "

"computer video games *STAR LETTER A MESSENGER ARRIVES FROM THE NORTHWEST! U Dear Bank Manager, Over the years gamesplayers O have seen dramatic changes to the videogame world. But throughout these years, from Atari's VCS 2000 to the forthcoming Nintendo 64 there has been one constant; the home console has always been less powerful than its arcade big brother, and therefore arcade conversions to the home have never been arcade perfect in matching them frame for frame, pixel for pixel. Obviously the home console will never be able to keep up with arcade technology which improves with every sequel. Sega's Virtua Fighter Model 1 board, VF2 Model 2, VF3 Model 3. The Saturn console which VF 1 and 2 have been converted onto have stretched the limits of the machine's capabilities and only through having new development tools and the expertise of AM2's coding team has the Saturn been Atari: RIP? able to support these conversions. Otherwise the Saturn could have died a death months ago, if we're honest. My point is this: Not only Sega but Sony, 3DO, Atari (RIP) and Nintendo have let down gamesplayers with their substandard (Arcadewise) consoles. They should forget trying to squeeze an arcade perfect translation out of their machines and instead bring out a game that is based on the arcade hit\". A fighting game could have the gameplay of the arcade machine but have the graphics, backgrounds and 3D routines etc. that are well within the capabilities of the console. Therefore no disappointment and a much longer 'shelf-life for the console which no longer needs to compete with up-to-theminute arcade technology... the British telly system (PAL). I read an article in show would be the presenters themselves who Edge magazine about a bloke who developed a kind should be good gamesplayers and have no backof Turbo Charged Signal Booster which, for a few ground in presenting or even writing for Earth Pounds, will give a full picture, speed, etc on videogame publications and therefore give a any console. Don't you think that Sega, Nintendo, fresh and unjaded approach to the show. All the and Sony would have the corporate heart to buy machines and games can be played and tested this gizmo and bundle one in with every console so on screen during the programme. The good we can get the best from our machines? And if not, points and bad points can be voiced whilst get off their cheeks and develop one themselves? they're playing the games themselves. If it's an I'm just drooling at the thought of seeing Nintendo arcade conversion they could have the coin-op 64 with its advanced Silicon Graphics 'As used in up and running simultaneously just to see how Terminator 2, and Jurassic Park' chipset produce good they really are. A retro section could be yet another glorious squash-o-vision display for our included, old consoles 'dug up' and played, local British consumption... computer clubs could be invaded, games shops could be visited and rated for range of products, CVG: Enabling polygon-based price, Shopliftability, and being able to 'Have-agames to display the exact same go-on-the-freeplay-machines-in-the-shop-withoutimage on NTSC and PAL is much having-any-intention-of-buying-the-game-on-disless of a problem than those which play'. Trade Fairs could be visited and reviewed are sprite-based. Polygons, as in depth, and not with the broad strokes that mathematical routines, can be told have been applied in previous programmes. to fill a specific area on screen, Finally there should be no crap 'PC Application' but a bit-mapped character (sprite) sections. No special guests. No stupid Internet. is always a set number of pixels Just gamesplayers who can actually play the high. Since the height of a PAL disdamn things and enjoy talking about them. My play consists of several lines more name for the programme would be: THE MCP than NTSC, images intended for Master Control Programme, or Midnight NTSC display appear compressed Computer Programme, or My Crappy Pony... or flattened. Given the time constraints, and overall benefits of the task, develop CVG: Crap name, but a brilliant idea minus the ers have to weigh up the pros and cons of a PAL 'Shopliftability' thing. So why don't you get your modification. But yes, we will be mightily brassed idea down on paper, copywrite it, and post it off off to find that any N64 games are lazy ports of to some broadcasting station for feedback. American NTSC originals. * wwoo GLSE KNOW YOU CMOOG? VOICE OF THE MASSES Panzer 2: Capabilities showcased. CVG: No way do we want to play \"The Adventures of Lion Rafale\", when we can be experiencing VF2.1. Or \"Ridge Racer Maths Edutainment\" when we can drive the genuine article. Do you honestly believe that the Saturn would be as successful were it not for its promising coin-op library.? Or that PlayStation would be half so cool without the Tekken and Ridge Racer games? NO WAY! It's games like Resident Evil and Panzer Dragoon Zwei that showcase their relevant machines' capabilities. But you can't beat the thrill of a top-class coin-op conversion on a home machine whatever the graphical sacrifices. After reading the article in the Free Play section about the demise of video game programmes Bad Influence etc I don't think TV producers should be scared off making programmes for gamesplayers. What they need to do is drop the kiddie approach and go for an older, later at night, slot. Dominik Diamond had a go on the Gamesmaster Gore Special. But again it was the wrong approach and tried to be naughty and nasty but failed on both accounts. All the games programmes I've seen have never reflected gamesplayers or their environments. We don't live in Heaven or hell, or in a Virtual World. We play our games at arcades or at home in the Living Room or Bed Room. So I thought that a set comprising elements from both these environments would be much better to show the games, consoles and presenters. As for the content of the programme it would basically be the same set up as any other programme of its type: Reviews, Playtests, etc. But the main twist to the Another idea of mine would be to set up a kind of clone of the Cyberia Cafe. But instead of paying .50 for a cup of shaving foam and a half hour session of hammering away on a keyboard, 'Surfing' the net, why not have a Videogames shop? You could have walls full of monitor each displaying games from various consoles. Underneath you could have extender cables hanging out of the walls, so that you the punter can come in, buy a drink and a snack for, let's say, .50 per hour, and play against your friends or total strangers, to see if your gaming skills are as good as you think. If you have a console of your own you could bring your favourite pad to cut down on the expense of hiring one. If there was a beat 'em up and the cafe was 'chocka' then normal arcade rules could apply winner stays on. Anyway, that's the broad idea. COOTMGG UGLB OS MORG SERONT Tony Rycroft, Salford With all the new developments in computer technology I have always been puzzled as to why console manufacturers and their socalled \"Super Consoles\" with their advanced state-of-the-art polygon generation chipset thingies have been unable to produce one single b*****d console that will produce a full picture and give full speed to its CPU on CVG: Again, it could be a winner. Only problem is, people with that kind of money to invest on a commercial project don't see a bunch of kids waving personalised joypads as profitable. So, on the other hand, what a terrible idea.

I'm lucky though, as I can just about) afford to change if and when necessary. But what of the hard-working parents can they?

It's such an old question, and the answer is never likely to change Nintendo, Sega, and Sony licensing their mascots to a competitor's system is a ridiculous proposition. It's as unlikely as Pepsi and Coca-Cola forming an alliance. cess. The closest I have come is Mr Do's Castle on the C64 which I no longer have.

And please, I want Paul answering my questions not crap Tom. I learned I don't get everything I want after I didn't win the lottery, so I just hope you print my letter! 1. What's all this about M2 and 1 Tom: Crap? Sega? Is it that Matsushita are making a 64-bit machine and Sega are helping and making an upgrade for the Saturn? hope so! 2. When will the new Sonic platform game make it to the Saturn? 3. Will that new pull-out section in your mag be a permanent feature? 4. Those pictures of VF3 last month. Are they going to be the graphics on the actual Saturn game? No, they can't be...can they? 5. When you said Sega may launch a new control pad with the new Saturn, does that mean that white pad you features last month or an all-new pad design? I'm not that bothered, but it would be nice. Cheers Eeers!!! Gavin B, Scotland Dear CVG, I am writing about the new 22 Flash Saturn 2 which was recently launched in Japan. Do you know anywhere that I will be able to get hold of a pair of those beautiful white joypads, as they're awesome! Also, how does the Saturn stand up against the PlayStation sales in Japan? I've heard that it's ahead with 300 000 units. Is this true? By the way, doesn't VF Kids look cool. Those AM2 lads certainly have some funky ideas don't they! That last issue was excellent indeed. It's just a pity that it comes to an end. Roll on next ish! James Cross, Hale Village LETTERS CVG: 1. No. Apparently Sega's R&D boys didn't rate the M2 hardware. 2. See the E3 report this issue. 3.

"computer Video games * AERIAL PLATFORM 55% COMPLETE (BY SONIC TEAM  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD SATURN SEGA SEPT RELEASE 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY SEGA TEL: 0181 996 4620 After two years silence, \"Sonic Team exploded back onto the scene last month with the first look at Nights, their incredible debut . Now we turn up the pace of coverage on their all-new gaming superstar! * SONIC TEAM 02 SIHIN NO SMAN 1SJIV ST NEWS ON hen it comes to creating smash-hit videogames characters, you don't get credentials any higher than that of the Sonic Team. Through the invention of Sonic the Hedgehog, these are the people arguably responsible for jump-starting the whole console craze into action four years ago. Never before had one videogames character been greeted with such mass appeal. People of all ages, from across the world, were drawn to him, Sega became a household name and the rest is legend. With Nights, Sonic Team aim to replicate this effect. They've researched the opinions of children from all over the world, this time giving priority to the views of children from Japan and America. «We've also had quite a good feel from England.\" explains Mr Naka Yuji, producer of the Sonic series, and producer and main programmer on Nights. «So we may have more of a breakthrough in Europe this time.» More so than with Sonic? How far EXACTLY do they intend to go? ..... ............................ DREAMUN Nights is set in the dreams of two children. Controlling one of them, you can wander freely around the landscape of their dreamworld. Being ordinary kids though, there's only so much they can do. Therefore, you have to find Nights (it's not so hard, just follow the arrow) and merge with him. That's when the game proper begins. NOOS INIWOJ 23 Coming from an artistic family, Claris is set for a future as a theatrical dancer, but her spoilt lifestyle means she hasn't developed the courage to face things herself. With the help of Nights, she becomes a stronger character throughout the game. A 15 year old boy from the fictional town of Twin Seas. As the eventual intro sequences will show, he's a brilliant basketball player, but is being bullied at school. This is giving him bad dreams and he needs Nights to restore his happiness. 22 "


"compute videc game WHO IS. NA He's the superhero of the game, that's who! Created by the main villain of the game, known as the Wiseman (we've yet to see him), to be his right-hand man. Although Nights is a bad type of dream creature (known as a Nightmarian), he used his power for mischievious fun, defying even the Wiseman. As a result the Wiseman imprisoned him. Only Elliot of Claris can free him by merging with him. Once that happens, you can take to the skies as Nights and save the good dream folk (Nightopians to you and me!). THE WAY HELOOKS! VELOPMENT OF THE CHARACTER \"Many thought we would probably create an animal for our new character, but we meant well when we betrayed these expectations.\" says Mr Naka. Mr Oshima, the designer of the Sonic character, explains, \"The personification of an animal for a hero had already been done in Sonic, I felt it was better to create a new character in a different world.\" The result is the bizarre looking elf-creature you see here. \"He lives in a world of dreams, so is neither male nor female. Therefore we gave him a neutral design. The image is old yet at the same time novel.\" continues Mr Oshima. \"It was trial and error to design Nights, at one time he had horns!\" \"Nights is coloured purple.\" observes Mr Oshima, «Purple is usually a colour which is unacceptable in the toy business. But when we researched the colour for this work, we had good response. So we thought that in Nights we could destroy the jinx in the toy world that 'purple is no good'. We want him to be fostered so much as to be fit to bring out on occasions such as Valentine's Day or Christmas or Halloween.\" LATEST NEWS UN WHY 3D? \"We didn't really have any particular preference for polygon or 3D.\" Mr Oshima explains. \"What we thought was important was to put life into the screen character and make him come alive as far as possible. We investigated various methods of portraying the expressions and movements of the characters, and out of them we chose 3D. We want people to experience not the technical side, but the more natural world of Nights and its inhabitants. We don't want people just to think «Oh, he's in polygon.\" V.CHIS CONTROLING NIGHTS Anyone familiar with Sonic should find controlling Nights somewhat familiar. The D-Pad steers you around the screen, whilst the fire button thrusts the character forward, for increased speed and attacking. «The area characters can move in is now much wider, and so we are still examining how to make the controls easier to follow.\" says Mr Naka. «We hope at least to make the controls feel in keeping with the movement of the character. We may work on the LR button\" DRILL SPIN! LOOP ATTACK! Tapping the L and R buttons causes Nights to twist in flight. It looks particularly impressive, especially when he collects a ribbon trail. What its purpose is though, is a mystery. Aside from his dash attack, Nights can also fly in a loop, causing a vortex that destroys any baddies or collects any objects within. WMNIGE SUUN O MORPHING ABILITIES! BOSS TECHNIQUE It seems Nights may be able to change shape according to his circumstances. Of the three levels currently revealed, the snow one features a bob-sleigh course which, in order to navigate, Nights transforms into a bob-sleigh. The resulting ride is very much like the tube special stages from Sonic 2! Although in its early stages, Nights so far seems to attack bosses by grabbing them and spinning them around him. This effectively causes the boss to get caught in his vortex, sending them flying! 23 "


"computer video games With Sonic we made one world. Now for Nights we have made another. In the future maybe we could make a Sega World made up of many different worlds...\" Mr Oshima, creator of Sonic the Hedgehog. 10 SATURN THE WORLD OF NIGHTS \"The world view we wanted has already gone through two or three changes. We thought of adventures, of military themes, and after many ideas settled on 'dreams.\" says Mr Naka. \"We wanted to make a different world from Sonic's. Something with contradictory features, something which is perhaps both familiar and novel, appealing and frightening. In the game we have the situation of the world of dreams, Nightopia, and the world of bad dreams, Nightmare. Nights can come and go freely between these two worlds.\" SCIENTIFICALLY CORRECT DREAM WORLDS! THE DREAM LEVELS! LATEST NEWS ON NIGHTS In creating these dream worlds, Sonic Team actually studied genuine dream psychology. «We had a lot of help from the works of German psychiatrist Frederich Holz, whose interpretations of dreams were novel. He was much easier to understand than Jung Freud's works!\" offers Mr Oshima. \"We are including things which an expert would be able to understand, but you wouldn't be aware of them at all when playing!\" adds Mr lizuka, the main planner of Sonic 3, Sonic And Knuckles and Nights. Three stages have so far been revealed! Which character you control, depends on which level you play. \"The reason for seperating the stages that the girl and boy can go to, is because the world view is based in the depths of the psyche,\" says Mr Oshima. \"The dreams of the boy and girl are after all not the same.\" SNOW STAGE FOREST STAGE ALPS STAGE : The landscape is very realistic, with trees dotted about. This stage is filled with trees, that Nights can swing around. You tan almost breathe in the fresh mountain air on this level. There's an impressive train on this level, that you can ride! The forest is particularly shady, with a lovely leafy canopy. There's that rainbow again. Must be something to do with dream psychology, NOUS SNIN ZD Clambering up these mountains is tricky. Go and find Nights! Although the terrain is quite realistic, there are odd things like traffic lights. The backdrops cleverly blend with the foreground to give an expansive feel. "


"_mputer Video games THE AMAZING ARTIFICIAL LIFE SYSTEM! THE TIFICIAL LIFE SYSTEM! One of the most fascinating elements of Nights is the A-Life system. This form of artificial intelligence allows the dreamworld creatures to live and reproduce freely. They also respond to Nights' actions with their own ecosystem. As such, they develop differently with each game, depending on what you've been doing. Likewise, with each play, the terrain of the world is different. «The A-Life system was an experiment to help create the dream world.\" explains Mr Naka. «At present we have not actually considered how far the topography will change, and have only thought about giving different movements to the Nightopians whenever they move. Therefore, the Nightopians act in response to Nights' actions, either coming at him with pleasure or running away in fear, or fishing at leisure. They may create new companions through their encounters, and, while keeping the character of their Nightopian parents, may travel far afield. Here the time and place of their actions is not randomnly chosen, but since they are artificial beings, this cannot be appreciated by us. To be honest, we are still finding out how far we can create 'artificial life', and have had a great response from the Internet and the press. I hope that when finished, people will think «This is different!\" each time they play, and there will be an event which even we did not conceive of!\" In the early version of Nights that we've played, the Nightopians playfully grab at Nights. After which he spin around them or springboard into a different direction. On closer inspection, when left alone, they paint and fish. Yes they do! OO LATEST NEWS ON NIGHTS ALL-NEW CONTROLLER FOR NIGHTS!! As we mentioned last month, Sonic Team have developed an all-new analogue controller specifically for Nights. Comparisons with the N64 pad are obvious, but the Saturn controller is no copycat. Sonic Team have spent ages creating an interface that works effectively with Nights. \"(Nights is) a game with a strong sense of attack. 'Your fingers will hurt!\" says Mr Naka. «It was thought this would be too much for most people, so we started to look at commands which did not use the traditional pad. The result was that last autumn we first used the analogue control properly. But the team was worried about it, and created about 100 (different) controllers. There were controllers for no hands such as the remote controllers, ones using feet many ideas. For the foot controller we even made a gigantic sample!\" The resulting controller, as revealed at the E3, resembles a thumb-sized trackball, with a self-centering mechanism. This is fitted above the standard D-pad. \"We haven't decided whether to package it together or not, but Nights does not feel awkward even with the old pad.\" continues Mr Naka, «The point of the analogue pad is to give Nights a better floating sensation.\" One problem with the normal D-pad is that you cannot easily control the speed at which Nights flies, often sending him looping all over the place. The new analogue D-pad should allow you to steer him around with incredible precision. COMING SOON NEXT STOP... DREAMLAND! Nights is still scheduled for a worldwide September release, but rumour has it the game may get a Japanese release in June. Whatever happens, expect more development news next month! "

"computer Video games STORIES FROM THE FRONT CD ROM A good friend of CVG's, Gary HarrodTM, is a big fan of Quake, and he got to play the near-complete E3 version. When he returned to our office, he was in such a state of shock that all he could do was mumble stories about a giant creature he came across. Apparently, it was over ten times the size of any other monster, with a giant pair of horns, and was so big that it couldn't actually move around the room! Before passing out, he drew this sketch of the creature to demonstrate how big it really was. Our apologies for the quality of the picture, but the shock was obviously so great that the man who drew covers for Mean Machines magazine lost all his artistic talent. 1996.10.2003 GARY HARROD ART WORK ENTERPRISES PLC COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT WILL RESULT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF MOTHER JOKES SPECIAL THANKS TO GARY MARROD ARTWORK ENTERPRISES PLC Led Co .

REAL QUAKE LEVELS AND FEATURES REVEALED! FUN WITH FRIENDS When we spoke to Jay Wilbur from id about Quake, he mentioned that multi-player games won't just be limited to deathmatches or co-operative play there will be a few extra game styles added. These include \"Capture the Flag\" each team or player has a flag that needs to be protected while attempting to capture the opposing team's flag at the same time; and \"Soccer\" a big arena with hole \"goals\" at either end, and a head which needs to be hit around! A game of \"Hide and Seek\" was also mentioned, though we're not really sure how this could work. 1 The knights run and swipe at anyone in the dungeons. Just wipe 'em all out. 1 On this level, the floating wizards can be shot into the moat on either side! DUKE WHO? Duke Nukem 3D is finally finished and available, and it's incredible, so why are we still getting excited about Quake? Well, Duke is a sprite-based game, meaning that all of the items and enemies are flat, and need to be animated frame by frame. Quake, however, is totally 3D all of the enemies and objects are solid models and can be viewed from any angle, giving scope for some incredible sections. It's possible to have massive creatures, so big that you'll be able to walk underneath them, something not realistically possible in Duke! Goodness, two amazing 3D shooting games in such a short space of time is surely too much to handle! 1 These slug-like wizards are disgusting! NOOS NINO NEXT MONTH: NEARLY HERE... There's a fair chance that we'll have a new, playable version of Quake by next month hopefully the complete shareware version. Then again, we'd rather id delayed the game for a bit longer and made sure it was totally fantastic, rather than rushing it out. Keep holding your breath... This amazing section looks very tricky to negotiate. Is it possible to get out of this hole? We're not sure, but Quake could do it. 27 "

RELEASED BY SEGA TEL: 0181 996 4620 SECA SATURN This has got nothing to do with a big God carrying a hammer it's about a boy called Leon. Far more interesting. LEGEND OF le covered Legend of Thor briefly in issue 174, but we've now got a near-complete English language version. Here's an update on what could become one of the most popular RPGs around, and a look at how it differs from the Mega Drive prequel. It's an RPG, only without the tiresome «point-and-click» fighting system of many games, meaning that the fighting is all done, real-time. It's all combos and special moves here, but with the usual spells, monsters, puzzles, and worried villagers you'd expect from an RPG... IT BEGINS! THE ANCIENT PAPYRUS SAY... ATTACK! SNUNLIN INN NOLLJY-17V S.VIIS SEGA'S ALL-ACTION RPG RETURNS! Since the last version of Legend of Thor, an introduction sequence has been added. It's a typical RPG story, told with a cartoon of the characters. One of the things that made Story of Thor on the Mega Drive so different from all the other RPGs was the fighting system. The main character in Legend of Thor is very similar, being able to pull off special moves during the game. To begin with, Leon has only got a short sword, but a bow and a cane become available very early on, and there are plenty of other weapons to be found later. SPIN SWORD ATTACKS 1. By rotating the pad a full 360 degrees and pressing Attack, Leon spins right round. It's very useful when surrounded 2. Pressing Attack when running makes Leon thrust forward with his sword, hitting many times. DASH FLIP 2004 3. Tapping Forward, Back, Forward, then Attack makes Leon do a backflip. Tapping Attack more makes him perform three in a row. BOW ATTACKS HIGH SPREAD 1. Holding the Attack button and pressing Back aims the bow upwards, letting Leon lob arrows over objects. NOOS NINO 2. Tapping Forward, Back, Forward, then Attack fires a spread of arrows forward at the same time. CANE ATTACKS SMASH SPELL 1. Tapping Forward, Back, Forward, then Attack makes Leon dash forward and strike with the cane. This attack can destroy trees! The intro hasn't yet been translated into English, so it's a bit difficult to understand, but it's all related to the two magic gauntlets, as in Story of Thor. 2. Leon can power the cane up, allowing magic spells to be cast. The spells can resurrect dead characters and transform objects. 28 "


"computer video games WHAT'S NEW? We covered an early Legend of Thor in issue 174, but the game's come on quite a lot since then. For a start, Yuzo Koshiro's fantastic music fits far better with the action now quiet music when nothing much is happening, and loud, triumphant music when you've done something good. Also, the text has been translated into English, meaning that it's possible to actually understand the game properly now. However, in this version the translation isn't too good, meaning that Dytto the water spirit talks about her magic \"babbles\", and characters occasionally don't make complete sense! Hopefully, this will be sorted out in the final game. SEOA SATURN 1 Once you've collected a few spirits, you hardly need to do any fighting just make them do all the work for you! SPIRITS Story of Thor on the Mega Drive had three different spirits who were collected along the way through the game. Legend of Thor on the Saturn has got six spirits in total, and each one's got loads of different uses. For example, Dytto the water spirit can freeze water and heal characters; and Efreet the fire spirit can melt ice and burn things. When you call on her, Dytto can conjure up tornados! SEGAS ALL-ACTION RPG RETURNS! FOR SEGA'S ALL-ACTION RPG RETURNS! 1 This is Efreet's big attack. He just launches masses of flames all over the screen, wiping out almost everything! N000! Where am Po Oh. COMING SOON 0 WHERE AM I? THE LEGEND IS REAL! If you're worried about the not-quite-overhead view making it difficult to see certain objects, calm down. There's a button which shows anything behind the scenery by flashing the items through the foreground, enabling you to see exactly what's going on. The Japanese import version of Thor is out now, but is virtually unplayable due to the Japanese text. It's going to be released soon in the USA as Legend of Oasis, and in the UK shortly after. Of course, we'll be reviewing the British version next month. 29 "

Artdink are the finest purveyors of truly different PlayStation games. After wowing Japanese punters over a year ago with A-Train (build a railway line and then, er... ride it), they took to the ocean and gave us The Aquanaut's Holiday, before beavering away on the remarkably strange Wild, Pure Simple Life. So, what are these off-the-wall releases all about? FLOATING WEIRDNESS... WARNING: ADDICTION GUARANTEED!! his isn't your normal PlayStation offering, and has been backed up by some unkind reviews in other UK gaming journals. However, these other mags have failed to understand the sheer strangeness of this title. «There's nuffink ta KILL!!» they cry, and blub that it's all too weird. Of course it isn't. Let's explain. Everything is in 3D and textured-mapped with total freedom of movement. You start at your submersible, and float off into the deep blue darkness, looking at fish and investigating the ocean floor whilst attracting new kinds of life to your part of the ocean by constructing a reef. Not THAT strange, but it's sufficiently different to dissuade those weaned on normal tedious shoot 'em ups. UK PlayStation gamers can look forward to an official release for The Aquanaut's Holiday extremely shortly (which has been labelled as a stress reliever in Japan), and to get you in the undersea exploration mood, here's a brief glimpse into the world of the aquanaut... CVG has played and completed the Japanese version of the game, and found it to be one of the most imaginative and truly inspired titles we've ever seen. Once you realise the vastness of the ocean, and the weird addictive qualities of the game («Let me find just one more new species of fish!\") you'll be constantly mesmerised by it for weeks. Not one for knuckleheads, but those with a serious amount of aquatic relaxing to do... GOOD COD, MAND CREATURES FROM THE DEEPP COMING SOON DANCE, FISHEES, DANCE! The sheer brilliance of the undersea life is unparalleled, and the number of polygon fish in this ocean is staggering. We counted well over 200 different species; from schools of carp to really scary Angler fish that lurk in hidden depths. That's not all, for there, are super secret fishees to find! Have you discovered the pink shark? Or the space aliens (I kid you not)? What about the gigantic 'Behemoth'? All are waiting in The Aquanaut's Holiday, along with undersea caverns, pyra mids, Greek temples and strange stone heads. Aside from the atmospheric soundtrack, your con tinued enjoyment occurs with the fun you can have with fish. Some are friendly, and flock inquisitively to you, whilst others swim off immediately, unsure of your motives. The more friendly fish can be communicated with using four different types of sonar which can beckon them or scare them off. However, the most fun you can have is by confusing the sea-life; making certain fish spin about furiously, or inflating the heads of certain denizens of the deep! 3 "

This is achieved by guiding cavepeople into new lands to kill beasties and bring back meat. As the tribe ascends through cultural levels it increases in size, builds bigger huts and develops more sophisticated weaponry. If this all sounds a little too normal compared to Artdink's The Aquanaut's Holiday, fear not. CVG has played the finished Japanese version almost to completion, and there are still bits we don't understand. Giant stone body parts are occasionally found littering the landscape, and sometimes your caveperson (the caveladies sport rather attractive leopardskin leotards) will drop dead for no apparent reason. We must not quibble however, for this is a game of huge character and atmosphere. Now if you'll excuse us, we're off to investigate a strange white obelisk... 200 MY STICK'S BIGGER THAN YOUR STICK! 00000H BABY, BABY, IT'S A WIDE WORLD! Wild, Pure, Simple Life differs from Aquanaut's Holiday in one important respect you can kill things. Quite a lot of things in fact, ranging from small monkeys, which squeal piteously and attempt to run away; to woolly mammoths, which roar loudly and then squash you. The simple flint is sufficient to do away with the feeble animals, but only the more advanced axes and spears are deadly enough to tackle an oncoming sabre-toothed tiger! COMING SOON From lush green fields over stone mountains and through dark caves to golden beaches, there is a huge variety of terrain to be explored. As with the Aquanaut's Holiday, the fact that the world is so varied is what makes the game so addictive («Can't come out tonight dear, I'm roaming the frozen wastelands to the north.......). NEXT MONTH... WE TAKE THE PLUNGE! Wild, Pure, Simple Life is currently on release in Japan, with no UK release as yet set.

"computer Video games 59.88 99% COMPLETE RPG BY KONAMI BY KONAMI RPG JUNE RELEASE  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED STORAGE 1CD  RELEASEJUNE  PUBLISHED BY KONAMI TEL: 01895 853000 1 PLAYER Playstation ayStation The last sort of game you'd expect to see Konami release this early in its 32-Bit development is an RPG (where are Castlevania and Contra?), but that's exactly what they've gone and done! 1 A full compliment of warriors do battle! Pick the fighting order of your team! Women at the back! GENSO SUIKODEN IT'S HUGE! t came as something of a surprise to all of us when we heard that one of the first Konami PlayStation games to get an official UK release would be their role-playing debut, Genso Suikoden, but now we've played the Japanese import version, we can't wait! Genso Suikoden features a total of 108 characters that can all join your party at different points of the quest (though you can only control up to six at any one time). As the game develops and you attract more allies, you can also get your own castle, which leads to some epic army-sized battles as you attempt to either defend your own castle or lay siege to an enemy fortress. ONCE UPON A TIME K ONAMI'S 3D RPG! Each member of the team attacks in order. The plot in Genso Suikoden revolves around the mythical kingdom of Redmoon, presided over by the almighty emperor Balbarosa Under Balbarosa's command are five Barons, each ruler of a different area of Redmoon. The player begins the game in control of one of these Barons' sons (you can call him whatever you like), just after he has signed up to join the emperors army in an attempt to please his father. At first you are commanded by your superior officer to perform seemingly menial tasks, but as the game progresses and your party grows, you come to discover some disturbing truths about the Empire, and how its evil intentions are somehow connected to an ancient myth about 27 magical emblems. Classic fantasy stuff. All that text will be in English when it comes out over here! WANDERERS FIGHT FOR LIFE The frequent battle sections are one of the best things about Genso Suikoden and while they offer nothing strikingly new in terms of game mechanics (pick the fighter, pick the attack, then sit back and watch), the way they are executed is unique. A scaling camera zooms in on close quarter combat, or pulls back to reveal the entire battle field, making the sprite-based action seem incredibly dramatic. And the pyrotechnic displays offered by some of the more powerful magic attacks are truly spectacular. The action takes place in the somewhat familiar form of top-down exploration sections mixed with number driven isometric battle scenes. As you wander from settlement to settlement (or around dangerous terrain) you will inevitably bump into one of Genso Suikoden's many hostile denizens, and the screen switch es to an isometric viewpoint ready for combat. Notice the cool warping effect (like a pond ripple) that washes over the screen to introduce each battle. COMING SOON NEXT MONTH.... TO WAR! We're still waiting on Konami for the official word about the UK translation of Genso Suikoden, but rest assured that as soon as we know, you'll know You begin near this waterfall. But by the end of your quest something's gone wrong! 3 34 "

Haha. t sounds like such a tasty game, doesIn't it? Onion Burger. Yum yum. But on closer inspection, this dish isn't quite what it seems. That word isn't onion, and these burgers aren't your usual bacon-double-cheese variety. This is a game about an intergalactic fast food company, and their patties are made from 100% prime cut human being! If, after that chilling revelation, you're expecting some 90's update of Burgertime Deluxe with triple-yolk fried eggs and dalek pepperpots chasing you around, you may be disappointed to find this is a pointand-click adventure. Well, don't be. Developers Sanctuary Woods have taken the usual puzzle-solving fare and turned it on its head with zappy cartoon graphics, a devilish streak of humour and an ingenious plot device that adds a new dimension (the fourth dimension, to be precise) to the gameplay. their patariety. This ter that PLEASED TO MEAT YOU! BURGER TIME! A GAME ABOUT HUMAN BURGERS! All adventures need a hero, and in this case your main man is Wilbur here. Unfortunately, Wilbur isn't your usual sharp-talking sazzy space secret agent. He's just an average joe, and a dim one at that. So when the Orion Burger Corporation abduct him for an IQ test, to see whether humans are too intelligent to be eaten, things don't look so good for the rest of the race. That's when Wilbur falls through a time warp... Seen Groundhog Day? If you have, then you'll have a good idea what Orion Burger is all about. Wilbur is able to relive the day leading up to his alien abduction, over and over again. And this is where the game gets clever. Sanctuary Woods have created a multi-location model of Wil's home town, Boonsville. Unlike most point-and-clicks, where you can only progress to a new location after completing the last one, Orion Burger allows Wil to wander freely around the town, interacting with any events that happen during that time. And he can do this, over and over again. There are parellel storylines happening all over town, and by living each day differently, Wilbur can learn about them all! Some old duffer causing trouble. Like they do. He'd be too gristley for burgers anyhow. That pig on the other hand... The raygun shrinks Wilbur to fit him in that cage. DEJA V FOOD FOR THOUGHT! The puzzles in most adventures often force you into a 'save-your-position-and-retry-if-you-die' situation. Not so with Orion Burger. The whole point of the repeating day scenario is to allow you to experiment. Fail to perform a task correctly and you can get it right next time around. What's more, there's a 'time progression factor to the game. You can, for example, only go to the store during opening hours. And only stop the bank robbery if you turn up at the right time. If, however, you realise how to solve a situation after it's passed, you don't have to wade through the whole day until it comes around again. There's an Abduct Me Now! button that sends you to the end of the day, ready for that alien IQ test or another day on Earth! At the beginning of the game, Wilbur is clearly incapable of passing the alien IQ test. However, with each repeating day he can learn the skills needed. For instance, one test requires him to play the piano. Something he can't pick up in one sitting. However, by practising the tune each repeating day, he can eventually pass the test! 3 . Albo This is Zlarg. The cosmic equivalent of Ronald McDonald. NEXT MONTH.. TUCK IN! OX TALES! We hope to bring you Such a complex twisting plotline isn't what you'd usually expect from a more tasty cutlets computer game. No surprise then, to learn that Orion Burger's script is from Orion Burger. the work of an accomplished TV plotmeister. Lee Sheldon is his name Maybe even the full and he's written scripts for Charley's Angels, a whole season of Cagney meal. Eat Milky Ways and Lacey and a whole season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. And until then, folks. Father Murphy too. Oh well, three out of four ain't bad. y a 38 baste youll NE 1995 SMC STS "

Add a revolutionary 3D graphics engine, a serving of Doom, and bring to the boil on one of the hottest 32-Bit games machines around. A recipe for success? Only time will tell... TUNNEL B1 IS THIS THE BEST 3D SEEN ON PLAYSTATION? DESCENT WITHOUT WINGS Tunnel B1 is a futuristic first person perspective shoot 'em up moulded firmly in the Doom explore and destroy tradition. Unlike Doom, however, Tunnel B1 sees the player in control of a hi-tech ground based anti-grav attack ship (the B1) which must be successfully piloted through a vast network of tunnels, roads and chambers. in order to fulfil the various mission objectives. NEON LIGHTS 99 9S Neon are a production team based in Darmastadt, Germany, who have recently signed on the dotted line to develop several titles for British software giants Ocean up until the year 2000. They have three promising games currently in develop ment, including Viper and Vanishing Powers, but it looks like the first fruits of their collaboration will be the all-action 3D blaster Tunnel B1. GOT A LIGHT? The bigger they, the larger the explosion. Or something. A Now come on. Have you ever seen anything like this? While the graphics are all pretty remarkable, particular mention must go to the unprecedented lighting effects, which include some of the most spectacular and convincing explosions yet seen in a videogame. A similar high standard is also promised for the sound, with the various stereophonic booms and bangs depending on the player's current location (e.g. echoes inside large halls), and a tense cinematic soundtrack (by Chris Holsbeck) to be included in the final version. The craft sometimes blow up in segments. Wow. 42 "


"ITS A REMBRANDT computer video games ENEMY MINE! By far the most impressive aspect of Tunnel B1 are the stunning graphics. Pushing Sony's 3D libraries to the very limit, it is clear that Neon have crafted something of a visual masterpiece. The fluidity and speed of the 3D is more akin to a top driving simulator like Ridge Racer than a straightforward action game, and yet here the player can explore the breathtaking environment at their leisure. Tunnel B1 features a large number of mechanised enemies for the player to abuse, including gun placements, anti-grav tractors, bomb dropping skimmers, helicopters and huge assault tanks. Being a driving game (sort of), nearly all the adversaries you face in Tunnel B1 are vehicle-based. So machine parts and shrapnel (as opposed to blood and guts) are definitely the order of the day. Thankfully, the debris ridden explosions presented in Tunnel B1 are at least as satisfying as the corpse mutilation offered in titles like Doom, and far more spectacular with it. So carnage fans are well catered for. The rendered into is nice, but for once it dosen't actually look as good as the in-game graphics! PlayStation Sass gys A Shoot the crates to reveal weapons and items. 86999 Take that you Muddy Funster! IS THIS THE BEST 3D SEEN ON PLAYSTATION? LOAD HEAVY As with any blaster worth its salt. Tunnel B1 possess a fine range of destructive ordinance which can be collected throughout the game simply by destroying the wooden, metal and radioactive crates that lie dotted about the many landscapes. These take the form of two main weapon types: RED (flare, bomb, plasma blast and mini nuke) and GREEN (chain gun, ion cannon, stinger and 'wideboy' missiles). The green arsenal forms the mainstay of your offensive front, featuring the more commonly used (and located) weapons, while the red arsenal is best reserved for specific occasions. Power-ups for all of the green weapons can also be located, thus doubling (and in the case of the chaingun, tripling) the firepower capabilities of your craft. The 'wideboy' missiles! This tank is among the most fearsome of Tunnel B1 opponents. But its dead slow. So drop a few bombs and run for it! Swish! Kaboom! Tinkle! These grenade turrets lob explosives at a fixed point. So, you know, don't go there. FREEWAY B1? 99 9990 BG 99 99 63 NEXT MONTH... KAB00M Despite Tunnel Bl's distinctive monicker, not all the action takes place in tunnels. In the eight level demo we played, the first two stages revolved around a network of open air streets, with only the more difficult later levels plunging the player into the trademark claustrophobic tunnels. The mission objectives vary from level to level, but normally they involve either the destruction of a specific set target or a race against the clock (or both!). If all goes according to plan (and hey, doesn't it always) we should receive the complete version of Tunnel B1 in time for a full review. After this incredible demo expectations are running pretty high, but for the final verdict you'll just have to tune in... 43 "


"computer video games TENDO 64 Yep, it's Nintendo 64 month folks, as we finally see it launched in Japan. But what good is that to us, with no UK release date as yet announced? Well, if you're anything like us, you may well be considering an import purchase... NINTENDO 64 THE NEXT BIG THING! If you're a regular reader of CVG, you should have at least some clue about the 'import scene'. Months before a game gets its UK release, we often cover the already-available Japanese or American versions of the game. For some of you, this parallel universe of games releases may make perfect sense. For others though, the continual references to NTSC versions, PAL borders and 17.5% slowdown, may well leave you perplexed, wondering what you're missing out on. With a UK release of the Nintendo 64 looking unlikely until next spring (that's OUR expert opinion, anyway), the only option for the more eager N64 groupie is to consider an import one. For those of you who've never entered the 'grey import market before, this might seem like a daunting prospect. So what better time for CVG to offer a guiding light into the world of imports, and, while we're at it, clear up some of the more confusing points about the differences between official and import games. NINTENDO 64 D umpor Nintenste NINTENDO 64 SO 64 Rest assured, right now importers are desperately putting in their orders for Nintendo 64s. As many as they can get hold of! You can guarantee though, they won't get many in, so DEFINITELY expect high prices. We've done some investigating and can tell you that most reputable importers The Japanese N64.

Yep, that's how much an import N64 is going to cost you. We seriously recommend you DON'T pay that kind of extortionate figure. Bear in mind, it was the same story with the Saturn and PlayStation. The first import machines cost between  to . Within a couple of months most import machines were . Two years on, The US N64, set for a you can pick them both up for just under Sept 30th release.

If you spent  on it. Wait a few months. NINTENDO 64 THE GAMES! At the time of going to press, no importers were able to give us a set price for N64 games, although some estimated  (and we'd judge that to be a minimum). At the end of the day, it all comes down to how many they can get and how much demand there is. **KA SUPER MARIOKART R SUPER MARIO 64 LAPI/S DAL 007 TIME 0007 SUPER MARIOKART PUSH START BUTION STARFOX  1996 Nintendo SNES Mariokart is the biggest-selling game ever.

Importers can charge extortionate prices for the latest killer games and you've got to be prepared to shop around for the best prices.

SUPER NES Super Mario RPG   NINTENDO 64 O IMPORTANT! THINGS TO BE AWARE OF! TV COMPATIBILITY! (Nintendo THE COMPLETE IMPORT BUYER'S GUIDE When buying a Japanese or American games machine, make sure you've got an NTSC compatible TV! If you don't understand what we're talking about, all you have to know is what kind of inputs your TV has. If you only have a standard RF aeriel input, it's not good enough. You need a 21-pin Euroconnector socket (rectangular-shaped). Note: a scart socket, which looks the same, is not necessarily correct. It must be Euro AV-compatible. Your instruction manual should tell you this. 2 THE RIGHT LEADS! Japanese consoles come packaged with a TV lead that ends in three seperate plugs (one for video, two for stereo). Some TVs have inputs for these. Most don't. Make sure the importer you buy the machine from provides a lead that connects to a Euro AV socket. Sometimes they wire a ribbon-cable with the plug on, directly into the machine. Providing this is done well, it's fine. puse 1 275 POWER SUPPLY FEATURE KIRBY WAVERACE The Japanese use a different power supply too, so make sure your importer includes a step-down convertor with your machine. This converts the 240V_UK power supply to 100V for the Japanese machine. It nor mally looks like a large metal box connected to a normal 3-pin British plug. Whatever you do, never plug a British power supply straight into a Japanese machine. You'll blow it up! Trust us, we know. NNNNNNNNNNNNNN Kirby is going to be released on N64 after all. This one could be popular. Having undergone a major transformation, this is part of the US launch line-up. "

Japanese games are sometimes too incomprehensible to play! 3. Once the official machines come out, import software gets harder to find. This happened with Megadrive and SNES. Not yet with PS and Saturn, simply because the games still come out in Japan so much earlier. 4. Your machine isn't compatibie with official software (see conversions). 5. No manufacturer's warranty! Make sure the importer gives you at least a one year guarantee.

UK, Japanese and US machines are never compatible with each others games. You can guarantee this will be the case with N64 too. Importers do, however, perform conversions, allowing machines to play all games. There are also Datel convertors which do the same. Note though these convertors do not change the game speed on Saturn, so UK games on a Jap machine run too fast. And Jap games will run slower on a UK machine. Therefore, ask about having speed switches fitted too!

THE ULLIRTE UN DON TECH IN IE FAMILY FUTURACTIVE ENTERTATNMENT.SE ummer is normally a quiet time for new releases, as most software companies have either pushed their games out over Easter, or are holding back for the pre-Christmas build-up. It's all a bit different this sunny season though, as most of said Easter releases have slipped back. Which means we've got a number of exciting titles still to look forward to. Saturn-wise, Guardian Heroes is finally going to hit the shelves. And best of all, Ultimate MK3 is scheduled for release 'sometime' in June. The bad news though, is that we've now got to wait until the 12th of July for an official release of Night Warriors. And that's providing it doesn't get pushed further back! On the PlayStation front, the hottest title has to be Konami's International Track And Field. Take it from us, this game is going to be HUGE! The awesome looking Tunnel B1 is also scheduled for release on the same day. Although, considering only a very early version has been revealed, we can't see that happening somehow. PC owners can finally get their hands on Mircroprose's F1 Grand Prix 2 this month (we hope!). And Bullfrog's potentially incredible Dungeon Keeper (on all formats!) is currently scheduled for appearance. Super NES owners looking closely, may notice Super Mario RPG in there. Don't get your hopes up though. While it is still on the retail release schedule, the official word is that it is DEFINITELY NOT coming out in the UK. June 23rd (Japan) Whilst rumours still abound that the Nintendo 64 is not going to surface until September, the official launch date is still set for this month. LOOK! Here, just to prove it, is the advert currently appearing in the Japanese press. This is by far, the most-hyped, most-awaited console launch ever and for just 25000 yen (-180), you could have this breakthrough machine. If you live in Japan. Importers over here are bound to be charging considerably more. Which is why we've looked into the whole import scene to find you the best deal. Just turn back one page.

"computer video games SURVIVAL HORROR BY CAPCOM  AVAILABLE JULY NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE STORAGE 1 CD  DISTRIBUTED BY VIRGIN TEL : 0171 368 2255 TM PlayStation | .99 (UK) 1 PLAYER PlayStation B. Perhaps when Capcom dreamed up the name for this game, they were trying to tell us something that when you buy Resident Evil, it's as if a thing posessed has been invited into your home. GRENEU RESIDENT EVIL ust know this: Nothing can prepare you for the terror contained in Resident Evil. You may tell yourself that a bunch of zombies and mutants are merely entertaining content for a video game. No doubt impressive too. And from the screenshots the mansion looks \"well drawn», and could be judged as suitably \"atmospheric\". You're a connoisseur. You have a good idea of what to expect from detailed polygon models, brought to life with skillful motion-capture technique. You anticipate that the supporting soundtrack is worthy of the presentation too. In all this your confidence in high expectations from Capcom is rewarded. Yet their game's overpowering strength lies with its power to shock to the core. Fear is intertwined between every twist to this gruesome tale. And as the plot unravels, it gets harder to hold yourself together. Compared to this, Hell Raiser is like a Muppet movie. ........................................ A Shoot this half-dead zombie before he reaches your ankles! WHAT MANOR OF HORROR IS THIS? Resident Evil is described by Capcom as a Survival Horror game. Surviving that horror depends on your dexterity and decision-making skills with one of two elite armed-forces personel: Chris Redfield, or Jill Valentine. They are members of STARS (Special Tactics and Rescue Service), and form part of the Alpha team who are called to investigate a series of bizarre murders that have taken place in the mountains which surround Raccoon City. This is STARS' second foray into that bleak area, having lost all contact with Bravo team in the first instance. ORROR IN RACCOON! MORE VICTIMS DEAD. 1998 JULY A Upon locating the scattered remains of Bravo team's helicopter, and subsequently the severed hand of an unknown victim (still clutching a gun), Alpha team are set upon by wild dogs displaying unnatural strength and chased into an old abandoned house. Raccoon Forest The stories are true... A victims were eaten... Black and White film footage of Redfield and Valentine's party shows the discovery of the wreckage, then the horror of being attacked by the dogs. For the Western market, the copious amount of blood is spliced from the edit, along with the stump of the fallen Bravo agent's wrist. So now you can eat while enjoying the suspense... MORBID MUSOS' FEAR GENERATION Even when motionless, with Chris or Jill standing in an empty room, the terror of Resdent Evil is overwhelming Reason being that the music is clearly saying \"do not go any further if you value your life\". Macabre strains permeate the atmosphere like a foul stench, grabbing players with icy fingers at the back of the neck, and draining the blood from all limbs. Most clever of all is the way Capcom use silence between times, so all that is heard is the drumming of heavy boots on the floor. That and the scrape of a zombie's rotten leg, or ominous padding of canine paws. Outside, crickets chirp in the bushes, and wolves howl in the dark beyond. It's uncontrollable how the sound content in Resident Evil causes fear to well up inside. So much so that there are times when you feel choked by it. Hmm. It looks nice and warm in here... by these dogs! Run for the mansion! 52 "


"computer video games HIT THE GROUND RUNNING TIT FOR TAT OBJECT EXCHANGE If you already own Alone in the Dark for your PlayStation, you have a pretty good idea of how RE is structured-athough Capcom's game is superior in every respect. So for the benefit of all, here's a breakdown of the gameplay. PlayStation BEHIND YOU! ACTION Most of the time that our heroes are wandering about, they're looking for somewhere to deposit some object they've found to exchange it for another, or even simply to trigger a switch that helps them in some other way. The most outstanding examples are the four crests, required to open the doorway to the outside world. Once returned to their place, the catch is sprung. To keep everyone happy, and on a razor's edge, the largest proportion of Resident Evil gameplay is 'Kill Or Be Killed!' Throughout their mission, Chris and Jill are stalked by the monsters created by one huge pharmaceutical disaster. Players must learn what weapons are best used against which foes, while developing nifty footwork to escape when necessary. YOU DON'T SAY! FACT FINDING IMPLELE BADO EXIT Once a safe area is cleared, there is time to make sense of the immediate surroundings. So Chris or Jill set to work rifling through old files, looking for crucial leads that would help their mission succeed, and be compact eneouhg to carry around at all times for reference. Maps fall under this category, as do assorted written documents which are first read then sorted in files. 922 Explored rooms are shown in green and your location is in red. WE ARE S.T.A.R.S. The difficulty level of RE is governed by the choice of character. Players requiring a lot of support tag along with Jill. Those with nerves of steel and lightning reflexes not to mention a great deal more patience adopt Chris. JILL VALETINE You have used the MANSION KEY. Ready armed with Beretta Pistol, and Lock Pick, Jill is ready for action from the start. Though her constitution is less capable of withstanding physical abuse, her wit and popularity with certain team members (namely an over-protective Barry Burton) gives her the advantage over Chris. So straightaway Jill has access to areas, and contents of storage devices that Chris takes time locating the keys for. Also, Jill has room to carry eight items which saves to-ing and fro-ing, and makes room for First Aid of some description A Chris Redfield is restricted at first by having no firearm, or means to unlock doors. But he's tougher than Tom Cox! CHRIS REDFIELD As a member of the Weapons Division, Chris has a better aim than Jill, Which is essential because he has less chance of stocking up an ammo he only has a Combat Knife to begin with! His hardy frame is more resilient to damage, but this braun detracts from his brain power. Consequently this officer is at the mercy of others to perform tasks which involve any complex thinking. Most stressful of all for the player is that Chris only has the capacity to carry six items at one Car is unfortusately car time, which requires a lot of tead unsic. planning ahead. CREVIEW Jill Valantine has the advantage of a good brain, better inventory, and timely assistance from friends! "


"computer Video games UNDER THE SAME UMBRELLA SHOSHAGES It is soon learned that all the diabolical goings on in this place are the work of the Umbrella pharmaceutical company. The mansion, with its extensive grounds, is one big Bio-research centre gone bad. Chemicals used in experiments have had strange side effects on every living thing including plants and animals. Victims fall into two distinct categories: PlayStation RE-ANIMATED IMUTANTS DESIDENT EVIL AUmbrella Employees How they died is a mystery this you can worry about later! Meanwhile just make sure they don't get too close, as they have an appetite for human flesh. Projectile vomiting is another party trick of theirs. A Giant Snake Should the snake get Chris or Jill for good, their final moments are spent being swallowed whole. Thankfully this is not a constrictor, though the huge coils are impossible to step over. Sink bullets into any part of its body you choose. Plants If these things were just bushes, and sat there looking angry, our task would be a whole lot easier. Only they've got tentacles, which reach out to strangle victims. The largest variety are so strong they can pick people off the floor. ASnakes Slither across the floor at speed, and strike out with their venomous fangs at passers by. A Flame Thrower is useful against them, but evasion is a wiser tactic as some are destroyed, more drop down from higher places. Giant Spiders We're sure that there's going to be some people wanting to put down the Sony controller and run upon seeing these move! They're poisonous of course and once they are blown to pieces, tiny babies scuttle from the remains. Yaaagh! Ravens These are fun to destroy whichever method you choose, as they squak to their death amid a flurry of feathers. They attack in numbers however, so it's a mistake to just wade in there. One shotgun blast can take a few down at once. Picture of a newbora MEINE Doberman Hounds These go straight for the throat!. In doing so they scamper around in an erratic fashion which makes them tough to hit. Try to keep them pinned with the Beretta, catching them as they raise themselves from the ground. Lizard Men Encountered once Alpha team have infiltrated the guardhouse. Huge bulks stalking about on tip-toe, screeching and leaping high into the air as they go for the kill. Armour piercing bullets are needed to stop them dead. 54 "

"computer video games VAT OO COMMENT (VALUE ADDED TORTURE) To heighten the drama, video clips are introduced. In the very beginning, a zombie is seen munching on the body of a Bravo team member. Later on, players adopt the viewpoint of SOMETHING as it hurries after your character, across rivers and down corridors at an inhuman pace. Such sequences are rare, but all the more effective because of it. SPURT! PlayStation We got our first look at Resident Evil at the end of last year, when only a few rooms had been programmed in. It was scary even back then! We've been following the new versions of the game right through development, and each time it gets scarier! It's very much like a real interactive movie, and it's far more playable than most of the games that go under that label. Right from the beginning, the slightly dodgy plot draws you into the game, and within a few minutes you'll have been shocked enough to need to take a quick breather! Though some programming teams may just slap a game together quickly to go with the shocks, Capcom have put everything in to make a fantastic game as well as a fantastic experience. Some people won't find the game very hard, as a lot of the puzzles are self-explanatory, but it'll take most people a fair while to do and it's very different depending on whether you're using Chris or Jill. It's more frightening than many films, and it's more fun than many games genius JOMAS Richard from Bravo tean It's Richard from Bravo team. He was a lovely man... Anyway, nick his stuff and go blow up some animals' heads! FRIENDS IN DRIER PLACES REVIEWER Away from the chaos are a series of Sanctuaries, in which players get the chance to breath a huge sigh of relief, and record their character's progress. However to do so requires an ink ribbon for use with a typewriter, and these are on a strict ration. Also there to make good use of is an Item Box. Place anything you wish to store for later use in here, and it is conveniently found to exist in any Item Box located anywhere in the mansion. EXIT RED BOOK CRANK INK RIBBON 2 1923 CLIP A Record your game by using the typewriter. A Store up to 48 items in this special box. This isn't so much a game, or something that you feel comfortable saying you've played. Resident Evil is more of a harrowing experience which you feel proud to have endured, laughing at the face of death all the way. In truth I am at a loss for words to describe the impression this title has made on me. At first I told myself that no 'game' with this quality of content could last beyond a couple of hours before reaching its climax. I was wrong. After the first shocking incident, I thought to myself that I was then prepared for any thing. Then found that I wasn't. Moreover the number of times I have found myself clenching my teeth in real trepidation since that time I cannot count. These feelings you will know all too well once you begin your own trip down RE s corridors. On a purely functional basis, I find that there is nothing to fault this title for. Created any other way, it's hard to imagine how Capcom could have managed the same overall effect. Both Jill and Chris respond instantly to commands, and their restrictions enhance player involvement as opposed to limiting it they walk slowly backward, and take time recovering between gun shots or knife swipes. It all adds to the tension. Every part of this title is created to induce a feeling of terror from the colourscheme, to player perspec tive, through to the unsettling movement of all foes, and the claustrophobic nature of the many puzzles. All the while your mind will be screaming \"get me out of here\", but at the same time you will be wanting for more. Resident Evil is, and will always be remembered as, totally awesome the one game that truly makes you want to scream. PAUL DAVIES REVIEW HIGH FIVE) NI RATING BATING G600 S It's a good idea to kill this guy before he gets on your neck, otherwise you'll end up like Chris on the right. Which isn't good at all. OMOSBE Capcom depart from their usual beat 'em up strategy and deliver one of the most incredi ble gaming experiences ever. Real scary too! It's not worth bothering to shoot the sharks here. Just drain the water out... then shoot them! 56 "

Maybe... ROM uke Nukem may be known by old people as a character from a rubbish Operation Wolf-style coin-op, but from now on he's going to be thought of as the man who took on Doom! The shareware version of Duke Nukem 3D has been available for quite a while now, and the programmers have constantly been adding new features at the request of the fans, meaning that the full, registered version is about as good as possible. And if you don't like something about it, just change it yourself! Using sprites instead of Quake's 3D items may sound like a silly idea, but it means that the game moves faster and smoother than any 3D shooter so far. Wow! ........................................

Once enemies are frozen, they can be smashed with one kick. GO These are thrown and triggered manually. Duke can drop more than one and detonate them all at the same time. 100 43 00 This shrinks enemies for a few seconds long enough for Duke to run up and stomp on them! A tricky weapon to use well.

DUKE NUKEM 3D CREATE NEW WORLDSI REVIEWER Included on the Duke Nukem 3D CD-ROM are a number of applications. One of these is BUILD, the level editor for Duke which enables players to make their own levels from scratch! Another cool program is WAD2MAP, which will convert any Doom level or PWAD into a Duke map! It's a fantastic feature, meaning that your favourite Doom Deathmatches can be played with new weapons, or your homemade Doom levels don't need to be rebuilt from scratch! Every time a 3D shooting game comes up for review, I mention how I think that PC Doom is one of the best games ever, and how it hasn't yet been bettered. Duke Nukem 3D is the first game to make me think again. First of all, the frame rate is INCREDIBLE! On a Pentium P90, it runs at a steady 60 frames per second, occasionally going over 100! Even on a low-spec 486 DX2 66Mhz it runs at around 15 fps, which is much better than Quake is expected to make. By far the most incredible thing is the remarkable level design each level is totally memorable. In Doom there are a few memorable levels (the one with the big, red upside-down cross; the one shaped like a hand) but Duke's are so imaginative that they're all unforgettable (the one on the movie set; the one in the tube station; the one in the cinema; the one in the underwater city). The whole game is so versatile that it can be set up completely for anyone, and there are already level editors and game patches appearing, meaning that it's going to last as long as Doom! The only bad thing about the game is that the enemies are a bit rubbish they're not very imaginative and they look stupid, but the bosses make up for that. Anyhow, I can't find any reason not to totally recommend this to every PC owner over the age of 18. It's incredible! 8 A$ NUM DOOM? oth DUKE NUKEM Here's Episode 1 Map 1 of Doom as it normally looks... And here it is in Duke Nukem 3D after the half-second conversion!

"computer Video games BEHT BY 01 CHALLEINO BEAT 'EM UP BY SNK PANE NELUCE  PRICE: EIMPORT  NEO GEO CD VERSION AVAILABLE  PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE: 1CD + 16MB CART  PUBLISHED BY SNK TEL : LOCAL IMPORTERS SEGAM SATURN OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS SEOA SATURN Looking for more than a Street Fighter clone? Think that's all Neo Geo games are? Well, you may be surprised to find that this is possibly one of the greatest and most intricate beat 'em ups in existence... HEKWOOL s we revealed in our issue 174 preview, King Of Fighters '95 is the first Saturn game to use a cartridge in tandem with the CD. The original King of Fighters on the Neo Geo required a massive amount of storage 361 Megs to be exact!! And the Neo Geo CD version of KoF '95, had atrociously long loading times. However, thanks to this Dual ROM System (as SNK have labelled it) which stores the backdrops and sound effects in the cart the Saturn version's loading times are infinitely faster. What's more, the game is near arcade-perfect. There are some minor glitches, such as when making a massive 7-hit combo with the likes Kyo, but rest assured, it's nothing major. For arcade KoF '95 fans, this is the ultimate conversion of their favourite game. STREET FIGHTER CLONE, EH? P3100 TUE PRESS SHRI 28 A2602 TERRY BUGATE DODGING! Sweets play an important part. Here Tom Cox has a malteser. BY 01 CHHLI SA Sceptics may well be asking themselves, what makes KoF '95 a potential Street Fighter contemporary? More than the average sceptic thinks! Whilst both game have similar features, each has it's own unique style. DODGE! Sick of having endless streams of Hadokens and Sonic Booms fired up your rear? Well, with timing, you can let an incoming fireball pass through you with the greatest of ease. Kof utilises this feature to a greater extent than other beat 'em ups you can even counter whilst dodging! Press the weak punch and weak kick simultaneously to dodge and any one of the buttons during the move to hit with the counter. POW! It was SNK who first employed a power bar at the bottom of the screen for charging up Super Finishes (back in Fatal Fury 2). So it comes as little amazement to find the POW bar in SNK's latest and greatest creation. Unlike SF POW Alpha, the POW is not charged through special moves, but either by blocking an opponent's attack or holding weak punch, weak kick and strong punch at the same time. DIS POSE! Surprisingly, taunts also made their debut in SNK games! Unlike in the Street Fighter and Darkstalkers series, this dis pose' plays an active role in the game's proceedDISP ings, as performing it decreases the opponent's POW bar!!! GUARD REVERSALS Yep, these too! In fact, KoF has possibly the largest amount of guard reversals ever seen. All special moves and super death blows GUARD can be used to break out of a block and immediately strike! It's tricky though. The timing has to be perfect and in some cases, you have to anticipate your opponent's move almost before they've done it! REVIE "


"THREESOME ANYONE? computer video games SEA SATURN What really separates KoF from the crowd is its legendary Team Battle Mode. TBM is a three-on-three battle mode. The first fighter from each team face off against each other, until only one fighter is left standing. Then the next fighter from the defeated side slugs it out against the winner. This process of elimination contiinues until a team is defeated. VF2 and Tekken 2 also have a team battle feature. The difference is, here your team mates can help you! If your fighter's taking a beating, press weak punch, weak kick, and strong punch simultaneously to unleash your team mate's fist-of-fury! Of course, this move only works if there's a fresh fighter on your team. But there's another bonus!! Unlike in the original KoF, individual fighters can be chosen to create a custom-team that centers around your strongest characteristics. So, for example, you can have a fireball-based team, or a throw-based one. Me pointy! She really does say that. CHALLENGER! TI THERN DIE BE Taisen CHALLEDER UFETRO COMMENT Ne morcu . DUL na SORTIDE TIMES MUSANAGE PO And Joe Higashi is enjoying a marshmallow here. Those with no previous experience of playing a Neo Geo title, or who can't break from the Street Fighter mould, would no doubt slap this game as being unoriginal, mediocre, and hard. I love Street Fighter right from 1987 to the present SFA2, but I also like SNK games. For anybody with the slightest interest in the Samurai Shodown trilogy or the Fatal Fury series, this is one of the best 2D fighting games ever devised. Persevere with the game's complex game mechanics and you discover that, in some aspects, KOF '95 requires a lot more technique than the Street Fighter games. All the characters are quite original, bearing in mind some of them were created well in advance of Kofs release (Psycho Soldier team were around way back in '86!!) and they're well balanced too, providing they're in the hands of an expert! With 26 characters up for grabs, there's months of lastability. If you have already become bored of the usual Street Fighter games or maybe want a more complex, technique-requiring game, give King Of Fighters '95 a try. But BE WARNED, this game is for real 2D fighting game technicians, not just novices who are going to wimp away from a challenge. And it's arcade perfect, well almost... YAS HUNTER TIME PRESS START 1261 URE SAKAZAK SYU IN DA BE YOUR OWN BOSS! REVIEW RATING Ah, it just wouldn't be a proper beat 'em up review, if we didn't get the chance to reveal some boss cheats to you. In Kof, said characters are Omega Rugal and Saishyu Kusanagi, and here's how you get them. On the character select screen, hold down START and press UP+weak kick, RIGHT+hard Punch, LEFT+weak punch, DOWN+hard kick. Or you could prove how good you are, finish the game and recieve the additional characters automatically! A spot-on conversion of a brilliant beat 'em up. But unlike SFA, KOF 95 is a very technical fighting game. One for the hardcore gamer, or true SNK fans only. 63 "

As Tom G goes for a final two metre attempt, Jaime starts rapidly pausing the game, victoriously causing Tom to fail. Ed wins (of course) with 2.50m, while Tom C fails all his 1.85m attempts. He just sits there laughing as if he thinks he's won. INNOW 3,80 \"I'm using my skin finger this time!\" cries Jaime, and he does so without success.

Tom Cox again surprises everyone with an even better 15.81, but Ed wins with an offensive 19.04. Tom Guses his shirt for his final attempt, with Ed calling it foul play.

The idea of an oldfashioned sports game of the buttontapping nature just seemed like such a lame thing to bring to the PlayStation. Clearly I'd forgotten all the fun I'd had during my formative years, playing the likes of Hypersports and Winter Olympics. Track And Field captures all the addiction those games had, and has had our office hooked since it arrived. It's the multi-player element that really makes this game. A full four-player TnF tournament has to be one of the most entertaining gaming sessions I've had since the likes of Micro Machines 2 on the Megadrive! And don't let anyone tell you this button-tapping stuff isn't rich in gameplay or skill. Mastering the events requires talent, timing and muscle power!

It sets the scene for what I thought was going to be a graphical stunna' but sadly that doesn't happen. The overall visual feel of this is a not. quite-finished feel with certain sections looking a bit distant, which, after the intro is a bit of a let down. But sticking that into the back of your mind, the playability of Gungriffon will detach from that. The missions are suitably tough, with one or two being easy and others becoming significantly tougher. Despite not a lot of variation in the levels, the simple shoot-everything-insight formula is a refreshing one, and one which provides a good feeling of satisfaction when the levels are over. And coupled with the frankly awesome soundtrack (best through Surround Sound TVs) provides a very atmospheric game. But why did they have to stick in the continuous meep meep meep, meep meep meep?

Maybe it wasn't the best footie game ever, but it was certainly fast, smooth and fun.

"computer video games FIGHTING GAME BY CAPCOM his ficamo  PRICE: ETBA  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE SATURN VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  PUBLISHED BY VIRGIN NO : 0171 368 2255 TM OUT JULY 1-2 PLAYERS PlayStation PlayStation After their undead assault on the Saturn, Capcom's creatures of the night have risen once again. This time on PlayStation. Special Spurting good fun! ep, Capcom's unrelenting wave of beat 'em up releases continues. And whereas in most situations like this, we'd be slamming the company for knocking out the same old game in a different guise, we simply can't do it with Capcom. Each of their fighting conversions X-Men, Street Fighter Alpha and most recently, Night Warriors on Saturn have each proved exceptional in their own right, scoring nothing less than fantastical marks. And each has been a welcome 2D change, both visually and gameplay-wise, from many of the lacklustre 3D offerings we've had to endure. So now Darkstalkers, the predecessor to Night Warriors, has finally arrived on PlayStation. Can Capcom hit the jugular again? 8 The Night Warriors TM TOP 450S THE MUNSTERS TODAY DEMITRI Felicia 7 BISHAMON Well yesterday actually. You see, this is the original Darkstalkers line-up from the original game. Eight classic horror characters, transformed by the warped minds of the Capcom Art Department into their own freaky vision. So much so, that at first glance you wonder what they're supposed to be!. On top of this, there are the two bosses A shape-changing B-movie robot, and his master, a flame-based alien! GALLON FELICIA REVIEWER VICTOR P 118900 Tor 7 Pemiti MORRIGAN ZABEL ANAKARIS This game has been a long time in development. And I can't help thinking the reason behind this, is that Capcom have had trouble with it. Visually, this is a far more taxing game than Street Fighter Alpha and, whilst it may look graphically as impressive as the coin-op, it's clear that a number of animation frames have been lost. Definitely more so than with Night Warriors on Saturn. This does lower the class of the game by some degree. But to be honest, even if this game managed to replicate the coin-op perfectly, I'd still find it somewhat uninspiring. The Saturn already has the sequel in which there are two extra characters, you can play as the bosses, perform chain combos and there's even full arcade animation selection. This seems like a rather poor substitue. Darkstalkers is still a damn fine 2D beat 'em up, better than any other on Playstation, save Street Fighter Alpha and maybe MK3 (although the official version of that is quite poor). But that says it all. SFA is a superior choice and, rumour has it, Night Warriors is coming to PS. TOM GULSE PHOBOS PYRON Sve stutt The characters' moves are unlike anything you'd expect in a beat 'em up. This is a hard punch! VISUAL EFFECTS Feliciez REVIEW Bst môn RATING With the advent of X-Men and Street Fighter Alpha, Darkstalkers may look like just an ordinary beat 'em up (technically, we mean), but when originally released its graphics were phenomenal. The definition of the fighters and backdrops was so clear, they looked like frames from a Disney cartoon. And the sheer amount of animation just emphasised the incredible, inventive movement of the characters. Visually, Capcom's previous beat 'em up, Super Street Fighter 2, paled in comparison. It may not be as ground-breaking anymore, but Darkstalkers is still one of the most visually inventive games around. It's a good beat 'em up. but do you real, ly want something inferior to the Saturn sequel? Especially with Street Fighter Alpha as an alternative. Come on! (72 "

And then we played it all the time, all over again, when the Maps O'Death extra levels came out. You just can't beat a good old-fashioned game of WAR! Zooming about in your military tonka trucks, blowGet the enemy flag! That's all you gotta do. Of course, it's ing the nuggets out of the enemy and easier said than done, as first you have to fight your way into leaving treadmarks in their skull-less enemy territory, and second you have to find the stinkin' flag! inkin' flag! face sacs. face sacs. No better way to kill a few That said, it's not as much of a chore of we've just made it hours. Ahahaha! And now we've got a sound. In fact, it's brilliant fun wiping out enemy property, all the more so in two-player mode, when it's your friend's' base. good excuse to do it all again, thanks to the release of Return Fire on PlayStation and PC. RETURN Now trundle into the wrong area of town and clear a neat path. REVIEWER It wouldn't be a Return Fire review if we didn't mention the music. As with the 3DO version, superb classical tunes accompany the action. Amongst others, there's The Ride Of The Valkyries for the helicopter (naturally), The Flight of the Bumblebee for the jeep, and The William Tell Overture when you get the flag. Majestic stuff! A Look out for the special towers. Inside one of them is the flag. We wouldn't like to trivialise war. Nope, we leave that to the programmers of Return Fire! There are little touches of black comedy that really add to the proceedings. Blow up a buildings and men flee from it, yelling and throwing grenades. No problemo. Just steer in their direction and crush them like ants. Mwa-ha-ha-haaa! One of my favourite games from my youth was Firepower on the Amiga. I don't know if anyone remembers it, but Return Fire is near identical. Not that I mind, cos it's ace! The blend of action, Strategy and thrilling tension as you race for home, is the cause of much screaming and palpita tions in this office (normally from me, cos that little grunt Lomas always wins!). Thankfully, Baron Wolfsheild's 3DO origi, nal has been left untampered for its PC and PlayStation fitting. The simple, yet neatly detailed, graphics suit the game perfectly, as does the thundering music. And I guarantee, you'll play it for hours in versus mode. The possibilities for scuppering your opponent's plans are endless! I've even driven my jeep out into the sea (using its inflatable tyres) to hide my flag there. Not that it worked. Simply one of the best two-player games around. TOM GULSE Look at those little smears on the tarmac. Chortle! Once found, race out in your jeep to get it. And return to base! REVIEW HIG RATING Easily the best feature of Return Fire is the two-player option. The objective is the same as before, only this time it's a race against time to beat your opponent. Rather than just heading for the flag though, you soon find yourself attempting to thwart your opponent, Dick Dastardly-style! The green player's mine-dropping AV has blown up the bridge. Curses! A perfect combination of destruction, filthy cumming and devilish humour make this one of the best two-player games ever made, Ure there with Micro Machines 2 a total classie! 73 "

JOADED ON iolent games seem to do well at the moment. Take a look at Resident Evil in this issue it's gross! Loaded is one of the most blatantly violent games about, involving six disgusting characters who run about blowing people, animals and anything else into piles of bloody mush! The overhead perspective isn't stationary like in Gauntlet or Chaos Engine, the scenery and objects move around in 3D to give the game a real, solid look. And now there's a Saturn version. LOOKS FAMILIAR The PlayStation version of Loaded came out at the end of last year, and impressed everyone with its excellent graphics. There are always slight differences when games are converted from one format to another, and Loaded is no exception. Actually, the only real noticeable difference is that the smoke plumes are slightly grainy, rather than the PlayStation's nice transluscent effects. Thankfully, the sound and playability remain identical something that doesn't happen very often. Well done Gremlin! SATURN PLAYSTATION REVIEW 1. When Vox shoots, the floor and walls light up in blue! INCREDIBLE EFFECTS! 2. When shots hit the walls, the explosions cause red light flares!

The six characters vary quite a lot more in Loaded than in most games of this style, with each one moving at very different speeds, as well as having very different weapons. CAP N HANDS SATURN Cap'n Hands' flintlocks make him one of the best characters. His special attack is also great -a black cloud sweeps over the screen and splats everone! Darn! I'm surrounded! MAMMA Mamma's laser gun doesn't become much use until it's been powered up a few times, but once at full strength it's brilliant! The wobble bomb looks great too! BUTCH Quick! Use the special attack to wipe them all out! Butch is a pretty effective character, but because he uses a flamethrower, all the dead bodies come out charred black. We want blood! BOUNCA Bounca's missile launcher is powerful but tricky to aim at times, and he's a bit slow to move around. His special attack is pretty cool though. LOADED Ugh! Not pleasant! FWANK REVIEWER Fwank's regular gun's not bwilliant, but his special attack launches loads of homing teddy bears who float around for a while. Vewy useful indeed! VOX Vox's voice gun makes an annoying noise but is still pretty good. Her special move covers the entire screen, unlike some of the others. I enjoyed PlayStation Loaded, and the Saturn version is totally identical apart from the graphics not looking quite as nice. One thing about Loaded is that it's very difficult to play through more than one level at a time. You'll find yourself saving the game and switching off after each level is completed because it starts to get a bit boring after about an hour of play. The actual game is spent walking around destroying what seems like an unlimited supply of enemies while hoping to stumple upon a key or teleporter, or whatever, which is what gets a bit boring. Even though the levels have different objectives, they're each played very similarly, which makes the game very repetitive. There's nearly always something going on and the graphical effects are pretty special, so some people are going to love it, but the repetition is going to put many off. ED LOMAS NEED BLOOD! REVIEW Loaded is violent. And that's what we all like best about it. When enemies are killed, they don't just fall on the floor or disappear, they explode and spread blood all over the floor! On the higher difficulty settings, there are so many enemies that the floor can end up looking like a carpet of red! RATING A very fast and violent shooter with lots going on. It can get a bit repetitive, and won't last forever, but is still very good fun. 75 "

The PlayStation version takes a very different approach to the sport, using motion-captured 3D players on a fully 3D court with a selection of impressive «camera\" angles. It's also got a very \"TV-style\" feel to it, as tournament matches are reported on by commentators \"back in the studio\". But will changing the successful playability formula ruin the game? BALL CONTROL SAMPRAS EXTREME TENNIS The introduction sequence is pretty strange. It starts off as an old Movietone News film showing black and white footage of old tennis matches, interspersed with colour film of Pete Sampras. EXTREME TENNIS Extreme Tennis's control method is fairly simple. The four main buttons are used for: Circle lobs, Square drop shots, Triangle slices, and Cross all backhand and forehand shots which means that the Cross button is used far more than any of the others. The movement of the ball is controlled with the D-pad, holding directions aim the ball, and double taps add spin. INTERESTING POINT OF VIEW BRITISH NEWS CRAZY «IN-THE-HEAD» VIEW! EXTREME TENNIS As the game's completely 3D, there are various views from which to choose. Most of them are behind the court, like a TV camera view, but there's one view that stands out in particular.

The Mega Drive Pete Sampras games were great especially in 4-player mode, Like most people, I was expecting this to be a near identical game with improved graphics, but it's a totally different game. The timing of all the shots has changed completely, from having to press the button at the instant you wanted it to hit, to pressing the button very early in this game. It means that players need to get into position quickly and select the shot a long time before the ball reaches them. It takes away some of the feeling of actually controlling the player, but still works well once you get used to it. The animation of the players is excellent, and the movement of the scenery is just as smooth, making up for the not-so-detailed characters. There are three different game speeds, so anyone can set it up just right for themselves, and it's also possible to customise a character to suit you perfectly. It's just strange that all the presentation is very wacky, yet the actual game is fairly serious which is a weird blend for sure.

The player movement's bad too, as the inertia varies from none in some cases, to the player carrying on walking for about five steps after you want him to stop, and it's almost impossible to tell which he'll do next time.

In fact, they're identical, other than the rough FMV cartoon sequences during the game. This isn't really a problem, after all, graphics aren't all that important, but the main thing is that the game is nothing special at all. We've had hundreds of games like this on the Mega Drive and SNES over the last few years, and most gamesplayers are bound to be sick of the sight of yet another average platformer. There are a few good points you get to change characters; you don't have to play the levels in the same order every time but they're not enough to get everyone so excited that they'll buy it.

Some of the FMV sections are incredible, and you'll find that it's more fun to stop playing and just watch instead though you'll die in under a minute. The real problem is that it loses the whole effect that the arcade version had playing with a bunch of friends on a massive screen with really loud sound even in multi-player mode on a 29\" TV with a Dolby Surround system (better than most people will get to play on) it doesn't compare.

"computer Video games NINTENDO 64 putas NINTENDO WIN hile most exhibitors adopted the strategy of covering as much floor space as possible with their displays, Nintendo's 'booth' at the show resembled the entrance to a ride at Disney World. The central unit was accessed via a ramp, which led visitors onto a viewing area for the benefit of a huge cinema screen. Below, numerous booths housed N64s running the initial line-up of promised games. Halfway up the ramp a Storm Trooper costume stood in an annex, with dry ice floating in the air. As people walked by, the suit dived into the way! Yes, there was a joker inside. Yes, I did jump! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.

X6 X 14 314 E3 SHOW REPORT Despite there being at least thirty or forty systems running this software, the queues were long and permanent once you had your place, you didn't move! And once you had the controller in your hand, there was only a limited time before the assistant 'assisted' you off. So my experience with this title is not quite so thorough as I'd hoped to find. SM64 officially now clocks in at 64 Meg, comprises of 25 different areas (15 Worlds, 10 special courses), and is unquestionably one very special game. The analogue joystick is used to direct Mario, and is sensitive to three degrees of force: Push lightly and Mario walks, a little harder and he jogs, full tilt for Mario to throw his arms and legs about and run at full speed. That's the easy part over. Learning to manipulate Mario is far more complex than before. Now for the plumber to stomp on his foes, players are required to first press the Jump button, then the Z Trigger. A few people I noticed had problems with this initially perhaps because the Jump button uses the right thumb while the Z Trigger falls beneath the fore-finger of the opposite hand. Along a similar line, pressing those buttons in the opposite order sees Mario perform a backflip. Mario may also reach three levels of height by pressing the button three times in succession once for a hop, twice for a jump, and three times for a leap high into the air with arms spread to imitate rotor blades. Crawling to and fro is achieved by keeping the Z trigger pressed. Cartwheels are performed by running in one direction, then pressing jump and quickly pushing the opposite direction with the stick. Throughout the game, Mario is said to obtain the strength of eight plumbers. I'm not entirely sure what this means yet. The T1000 style Mario occurs when the plumber dives into a silver pool and emerges coated in the stuff. As for the winged cap, unfortunately I don't know how or where that is found. An easier highlight to find is the cannon which Mario climbs inside to launch himself to higher places. Above all else, the appeal of this latest Mario incarnation is his seeming ability to do almost everything you want him to within his advanced 3D environment. If there's a tree or a wall he can climb them. Where there's water he can either splash around or dare to swim beneath the surface in search of some underwater channel to another location. Enemies are confronted with a super punch, or the trademark stomp. All the while players can casually switch views by use of the yellow C buttons, meaning that you don't suddenly end up staring at the back of a hill when you should be keeping an eye on the central character. And key objects don't fall out of view when you really need to see 'em. 383007 O 390 WEW_GAMES) All being well, by this time next month, CVG will have had opportunity to enjoy a thorough play through of SM64.

"computer video games WAVE RACE 64 2-PLAYER (SPLIT SCREEN) An assistant originally assigned to demo Mario demanded that he switch places with somebody on Wave Race it's that fanatastic. You'd be forgiven for passing this one over if first glances are to be trusted. Yet, just a few moments of crashing the Jet Ski over that water, I found myself screaming the game's praises. Count yourself lucky that you're reading these words, and not hearing them bellowed at 300 decibels from one very impressed individual! The water physics are completely believable. So much so that you just accept that this is water, not some awkward representation. The translucency of its appearance, and the illusion of boyancy is absolutely perfect. Where fences enclose the race course, the water slops up against them. If . you were ever wondering how race games could become more exciting the answer is definitely here. Of course there's no riding up hills, but the tradeoff is much more interesting: Cutting into the biggest waves for tighter cornering, using the analogue stick to adjust the angle with absolute precision. Bouncing off the top of a ramp to make a big splash, then sink slightly into the water before powering ahead. All the while true-to-life environmental conditions such as wind speed and wave direction affect your control. Picture it the entire playing field undulating and glistening as you race. Now try to imagine the feeling of skimming over those waves. It's an extremely difficult sensation to convey, but I absolutely guarantee that any  one who plays WR64 once will want an N64. More than any other soft on show, this title supports Nintendo's claims that \"Nintendo 64 is the only truly new video game experience since the Super NES.\" Absolutely. Those riders balance on the skis with such superb realism, that they can only have been motion captured. How they push forward, lean back. and lean into the turns is spectacular. When they fall off, they carefully haul themsleves back onto the platform, knees first, with hands clutching the bars. Once they're standing again you're away!

As it blasts from the cave, Storm Troopers rush into the enclosure to attack the intruder you. And it's as though you are really there. Classic material all the way, and there is never a thought of how the N64 is achieving all this atmosphere and depth you just seem to accept that the machine isn't about to let you down with some crummy pixellated explosion or dodgy-looking texture map. Star Wars fans will be begging on their knees for this game when it finally hits the shelves, no doubt about it!!! Here's my opportunity to tell you how incredible the N64 sounds. If you thought full-bodied orchestral music was only possible with a CD-ROM, prepare to be amazed. LucasArts have sampled music direct from the master tapes for use as the BGM in Shadows of the Empire, and the result is staggering. At least as clear and authentic as you can get outside of a concert hall and all the work of the N64 SP co-processor. Sound effects too are lifted straight from the library of material used in the original trilogy, with more besides. Feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as the Empire's lasers flash by your head. Excellent! Of course the visual content is aweinspiring too. There are four different types of play area, including flight and Dark Forces style first-person action. The now familiar Snow Speeder section is especially exhillaratingjust ask Dave Upchurch from NMS how cool it is to chance flying between the legs of an AT-AT, exactly as it happens in The Empire Strikes Back.

Feat Hali KILLER INSTINCT 12 E3 SHOW REPORT With all due respect to Rare and Nintendo, Killer Instinct is not the best fighting game out there. And certainly not the 'Killer App' most players would go for if choosing a system on the strength of this particular area. What Ki 64 does portray, however, is how effortlessly the N64 hardware can reproduce an extremely powerful coin-op. As is the case with Mortal Kombat. So while a 2D fighting engine may not have been the perfect choice to showcase a machine so clearly profficient in 3D (If only Konami could get 47-Tek a development system!), this looks to be far and away the best version of Killer Instinct yet. No wonder the boys at Rare sound so pleased with N64 all the time. For the record kl 64 runs at 60 fps, incorporates new moves such as Pressure Breakers and Rock-Paper-Scissor moves, to sit comfortably with the existing but tighter Combo Breakers and Super Linkers. All the characters from K12 are in there, and are HUGE especially when they move together and the 'camera' zooms in close. BLAST CORPS I'll own up to not having much experience on this one, but the word at the show was that Blast Corps is great fun. Especially the explosions! The premise is very simple: wipe out every structure in sight that might impede the progress of an out-of-control missile carrier. Begin the game with a basic dozer, and upgrade to more powerful machines the further into the game you survive. Extra points are scored for powersliding into buildings a tactic which becomes increasingly more rewarding depending on the style of vehicle (we're told some take on the form of giant humanoid robots!!) and of course the size of building. Once again we are reminded of N64's seemingly unfathomable ability to shift around masses of objects in solid 3D, and decorate it all with an amazing array of special effects routines. CRUIS'N USA ETAPSED TIME ELAPSED TIME CHECK (130 SANVI MEN) Perhaps only because Nintendo promised this game was coming, here it is. And in the light of Wave Race, which truly redefines console racing, Cruis'n appears a little dated. It's sharper and smoother than the arcade origi nal, but aside from that there is nothing added. It's another great promotion for the analogue stick however being able to weave and steer through corners makes a huge difference from the slalom-style play offered by standard pack-in controllers. ELAPSED In case you have never played Cruis'n USA, here are some of the things to look forward to. First off there are 14 courses, and players choose one of four custom cars to race them. The biggest draw is that the courses are replicas of monumental areas from across the US. Some places you find yourself avoiding Giant Redwoods, or you could be risking the paintwork by hurtling through Chicago. Just as with the other N64 racers, two-player mode splits the screen horizontally for the competition and there is no noticable loss of detail or speed. Cruis 'n is a safe bet for the American market, but given the choice I'd recommend Wave Race without a second thought. ni MPH Y?

"computer Video games N64 GAMES NOT ON SHOW STAR FOX 64 Still in development, and improving visibly as the months go by. I fully expect to be blown away by this title when it finally arrives. Control over the original ARWING in Super NES StarFox was incredible, and the FX chip enabled some superb characters to emerge remember that huge stomping dinosaur? N64 should effortlessy produce a worthy sequel with the analogue stick in control, and the 64-bit RISC processor taking charge of the many 3D graphics routines. And after what heard on Shadows of the Empire the musical score should be fantastic too. There's no specified release date as yet. 1 Can't wait to fly low beneath those bridges! Expect the animations of this droid to be cool KIRBY'S AIR RIDE : KEN GRIFFEY JR BASEBALL We were originally told that the Kirby game at Shoshinkai was only a demo. Obviously somebody saw greater potential, or took heed of the positive response at that event, because here it is on the official release schedule. Kirby brings with him one of the first four-player compatible games for the system, in the form of an Air Board championship. The idea is to perform as many wild stunts as your thumb will allow by means of the 3D stick-something which is believed to be impossible on any other system. Somehow | suspect Sega might not want to deprive Sonic of a little snow boarding acrobatics... we'll see. To keep players on edge, the game engine randomly generates circuits and obstacles for each race in one of the modes. Should be sensational, and extremely funky! After the initial press shots of Ken Griffey Jr being motion captured, Angel Studios have been unable to release any further details on their baseball game, to star the Seattle Mariners' pride and joy. Four-player, split-screen Kirby! SUPER MARIO KART R BAP8/8 mer om BODY HARVEST GOLDEN EYE E3 SHOW REPORT Super Mario Kart is the platinum selling contender for the best video game ever created. Certainly it's the most competive racing game out there. President of NCL, Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, said that nobody was getting hands on experience of this long-awaited sequel until it was good and ready. And that obviously isn't yet. Once again E3 visitors witnessed tantalizing video footage of the game, and were reminded of the revolutionary four-player mode. Also four modes of play are confirmed: Grand Prix, Time Attack, Versus Match, and Battle Mode. Aieeee! Why must we wait!!! Well, at least we got to see the title screen. Another title that promises a rockin' sound track, amazing sound effects, and even more astounding worlds to admire and then destroy. Actually it's the aliens who are destroying everything this time around, and the player is taken back in time to prevent them from doing so. There's a great deal of strategy involved we are told which is probably borne from the choice of action: 130 varieties of transportation await your steady hand to control, ranging from pick-up trucks to hovercraft; aircraft and tanks. Sounds like there's potentially more destructive power here than even Blast Corps! Due to some difficulties with licensing agreements, Rare's Golden Eye project didn't make it to the show floor. Which is a shame, because Rare claim to have used all the blue prints from the film to replicate the locations, then inhabited them all with characters wrapped in digitised textures of the actors from the film. The game's primary style is a first-person shoot out, much in the style of Virtua Cop or Time Crisis, only with more freedom of movement using the analogue stick in conjunction with the cross key and four C buttons. Sounds very interesting indeed.

As happened with the original Tetris game, a couple of Nintendo suits saw H20's game in development, and saw its potential. Hence the coveted Tetris association and the prestige of being taken on board as one of the first N64 developers. There's unfortunately not a great deal we can reveal at this stage, only that the aim is to \"remove Tetris-style blocks to penetrate the core of a rotating 3D sphere.\" Which is a direct quote from the release handed out at the show.

"computer video games TACK OF THE KILLER SUPER NES GAMES e already know that Super Mario RPG isn't going to make it over here, which only leaves these four titles with overseas potential from NOA. But with N64s running just around the corner, not even the Americans were taking much of an interest in them; however pretty. .................... TETRIS ATTACK DONKEY KONG COUNTRY 3: DIXIE KONG'S DOUBLE TROUBLE! SAATES Evidently Nintendo believe that us 'kids' can't get enough of everyones favourite Donkey Kong Country series. I'm surely not the only person who would have prefered to see K12 from Rare instead. But on that slightly dismayed note, I wouldn't want to detract from the quality of DKDT. This time around players get to control Kiddy Kong, as he and Dixie explore hitherto unseen areas of DK Island. And it looks magnificent. The platform trappings are ingenious as ever, with breathtaking locations (for the Super NES) and suitably cool music. This is almost guaranteed to be the final Super NES DK adventure, so let's hope THE have the balls to bring it over! Remember Panel De Pon from issue #171? Well this is it, only with Yoshi and pals taking centre stage where the Leaf Fairy and her folk took off. Now it's okay to enjoy this game if  you're a boy, I think, is the strategy. Anyhow, bear no mind to the Tetris in the title, as this has almost nothing in common with that game. Instead of slotting shapes together like a jigsaw, patterned blocks are matched to have them disappear. It's great fun and requires skillful thinking to progress. The two player mode, in which chain reactions can be used to obstruct a competitor's progress, ranks among the best games we've ever played at  CVG. Please Yoshi, ask Nintendo nicely and they might let you go to the UK. (PS Tetris Attack is also scheduled for Game Boy). : KIRBY SUPER STAR KEN GRIFFEY JR'S WINNING RUN E3 SHOW REPORT Seeing as we haven't seen the first Ken Griffey game on these shores, it's unlikely this will ever make it. Once again the Seattle Mariners' Baseball Superstar lends his expertise to help develop the ultmate hardball game on a 16-bit system. This time around it's Rare who have been handling the programming and design (Software Creations worked the original). Using similar techniques to their DK games, Rare have produced an attractive-looking sim, which allows players to build their own teams and compete in a spe cial MLB challenge. Which all sounds superb, but is almost 100% guaran teed not to find a place in any UK player's Super NES 'control deck'. Though it may look like a platform game, Kirby Super Star (aka Super  Deluxe in Japan) is full of cool surprises. HAL Laboratories who developed the game have built eight different games into this 32 Meg cart, through out which Kirby transforms into 24 character forms. The two-player game is simultaneous, seeing Kirby joined by a sword weilding helper. Soloists  may even choose to have the CPU control this partner. Just like all the best Nintendo platform variants, Kirby Super Star is riddled with ook secrets. ENEN VIRTUAL BOY GAME BOY ow that Game Boy Pocket has arrived (see news) these two Nintendo titles suddenly become more interesting I thought so anyway. intendo's 32-bit, monochrome (red on black), 3D portable for those who don't already know. I like Virtual Boy, and find it a shame that the system didn't get the titles it deserved. After the initial batch of three great games Mario's Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer things just seemed to dry up rapidly. Only two VB games were on show at E3. KIRBY'S BLOCK BALL BOUND HIGH ORE 0101300 Whatever this Kirby fellow does is fine by me. Especially in the puzzle/ action category where nobody can convince him of being responsible for easy games. This is breakout with several cool twists, first of all that Kirby is the ball. Just like in Kirby's Pinball in fact. Here though, Kirby's special abilities are used to help him rack up the points and clear all ten stages. Look, it's brilliant! You should just buy it! The gimmick here is to have players feel like they're falling down, then bouncing right back up again the whole time... Somewhere along the line Chalvo your character is to eliminate alien monsters from the grid below. The illusion of depth is great. That duck-billed fellow is King Dedede. (Rotter!) (NEW GAMES REM DONKEY KONG LAND II: DIDDY'S KONG QUEST DRAGON HOPPER Didn't play this one, sorry. But I wish I had as Dragon Hopper derives a lot of its ideas from the Zelda series of games. In fact, as soon as it comes out in America I'm going to buy it. I'm not joking! Diana, here I come! I won't let Faeron hurt you! Who could have guessed, eh? Well no need to get too sarcastic, as the first DK game translated extremely well onto the tiny screen. Somehow Rare's ingenuity with platform games suits the Game Boy arguably better than the Super NES clever secrets, and tricky obstacles just perfect for passing a train journey or whatever. Don't let the crumby screen-shot put you off. This game looks quite amazing in motion. 88 "


"computer video games SEGA t Sega's E3 party/ product presentation, President Tom Kalinske's message was very positive indeed. Worldwide Saturn sales are now exceeding PlayStation, and Sonic the Hedgehog is back on all Sega's platforms to lead the assault against Nintendo. You could almost hear the rings chime in celebration as that particular announcement was made. Promises of great things to come in the form of faithful Fighting Vipers, Virtual On, and (gulp) Virtua Fighter 3 conversions were all taken with a pinch of salt however. I especially wondered about that VF3 claim, as did most peo ple. Potentially Sega have a rock hard software line-up for 1996/97. Potentially. Whatever your doubts, it cannot be denied that Sega as a whole are a broadthinking company and their success with the Pico is testament to that. Plus the Net Link (see news) is an attractive proposition for American homes. After some difficulties Sega are very much in control of their own product now, which can only be worrying for the opposition. SATURN 2 NiGHTS What the feature beginning on page 22 can't tell you is how E3 responded to Yuji Naka's wonderful Saturn game. Especially with the new Saturn controller (see news). Compared to Nintendo's Mario set-up, the NIGHTS enclosure was miniscule. But it housed a mighty rival for sure. With the 3D control pad, NIGHTS takes on a magical new feel. The freedom of movement seems to loosen the NIGHTS character for more daring acrobatics, and exploration with the two children is more exciting. Unlike the Super Mario 64, however, the 3D pad does not influence the speed of the characters. Overall the impression is one of fluidity. The hottest rumour surrounding NIGHTS at the show is that, early on Thursday morning, Mr Shigeru Miyamoto was spied trying his hand at the new game. Of course this doesn't mean any thing probably he liked it, then again he may have dismissed it as no competition. Good rumour though. E3 SHOW REPORT 1 With the analogue pad in control, NIGHTS soars!

"computer video games SONIC X-TREME GAMES The original Sonic games on Mega Drive turbo boosted that machine's reputation by pulling off impossible stunts. Now the creators of all the bestselling sequels turn their attention toward Saturn. And they have everything to prove, as the young producer Mike Wallis knows too well. As you can see, the game is represented in full 3D, with the play area designed to rotate through 360° almost constantly. Sonic is now a beautifully rendered 3D model which, along with all the Badniks, is presented on screen as a sprite. The powerful display is handled through a similar technique used by AM2 for their conversion of VF2, with video display processors VDP1 and VDP2 working in tandem. Sonic runs into and out of the screen, in addition to left or right, and can roll all around most terrain taking the rest of the screen with him most of the time! Cool new abilities include throwing rings, along with the Spin Slash (mid-air 360° attack) and Sonic Streak (dunno). The Spin Dash is also back. Bonus rounds are guaranteed, but most exciting of all is that Sega are keeping certain aspects of the gameplay completely secret. It looks to me like Sonic could do it all over again for Sega. 1 Wooo-aaaaa-uuuurrgh... 1 ...aaaaa-eeeeee-o0000... 1 ...still want 2D Saturn Sonic? VIRTUA COP 2 SEGA COIN-OPS E3 SHOW REPORT ah!

"computer Video games Ma SONY ravado in the face of Nintendo's huge E3 presence wasn't reserved to just Sega. Sony were laying claim to being the market leaders too. True or not, their E3 stand oozed success and promise. A casual glance in the direction of SCEA's huge banks of monitors immediately registered \"Eye Candy\" a marketing term applied to great-looking software. Almost without exception, the PlayStation games looked fantastic. *AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, WE WERE THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK. NOW, WE'RE LEADER. SHIGEO MARUYAMA, CHAIRMAN, SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT AMERICA TWISTED METAL 2: WORLD TOUR E3 SHOW REPORT Another title to advocate PlayStation's tremendous 3D muscle was another Single Trac project: Twisted Metal 2: World Tour. The vehicles now appear almost twice as large as before, and give the impression of being twice as detailed. The environments are more solid, with the two-player hunter-killer theme enabling the gameplay to hang together much tighter. There's less time spent driving around in circles with nothing to do. Vehicles come heavily armed, and even when the opponent isn't crossing your sights the interactive environment is available for target practice. New vehicles include a bulldozer, a race car, a hearse, and some bloke named Axel who's trussed up between two huge wheels, and armed to the teeth. Look forward to obliterating all of these, plus the old favourites, with new weapons such as remote controlled detonating bombs, napalm, ricochet bombs, and group missiles. Sony are lucky to have Single Trac Entertainment as developers their attitude and their skill. Though basically a platform game, the 3D slant enables Crash to run around certain obstacles such as this pirhana plant. CRASH BANDICOOT Naughty Dog's PlayStation debut looks like a dream and plays like an Australian Marsupial. Just how good or bad remains an open question thus far. In the meanwhile I'd like to join in the praises for this game's magnificent graphic appeal. To the casual observer, Crash looks for all the world like it could be an N64 game. In fact you could forgive most PS fans for stepping out to say it's even better. The 3D is rock solid, and the textures are incredibly fine. Cast an atmospheric light over the Bandicoot's outback territory and it really comes alive. The game play is divided into two styles: sidescrolling platform, and second-person perspective platform. In either situation CB depends on the time honoured foot stomp/ bottom bounce technique to knock out enemies and crack open crates. You think that sounds familiar? Well, there's Bandicoot-eating Piranha plants too. So, the mechanics aren't revloutionary at all. But the setting is a marvel to behold. Not as alternative as Sonic X-Treme, nor ground-breaking as Super Mario 64, but SCEA's new mascot is arguably more sumptuous than either to behold. Between now and next issue we'll try to get more 'hands on' for a fair report on the gameplay. CEEEE 5 EMPTY 1 Twisted Metal 2 is looking extremely hot, don't you think? Can't wait to get on it again! JET MOTO SIWV9 MON Of all the SCEA titles at E3, I found this one to be uncharacteristically refreshing. Jet Moto is a hybrid of jet ski, motocross bike, and rocket. Because it hovers above the ground, it's unrestricted by terrain so can motor across anything land or sea. Although the nature of the surface area does affect speed. Survey the geography, put the pedal to the metal, and away you go. The idea is to navigate the quickest, safest possible route between the start an finish gates. It's an ambitious title, but that's only to be expected from Single Trac Entertainment; the same people who developed Twisetd Metal and WarHawk. America gets Jet Moto in time for Christmas, which means Europe may have to wait until early next year. 1 I'm looking forward to this one almost as much as Wave Race. The variety makes it exciting. 92 "

"MARVEL SUPER HEROES computer Video games KONAMI PROJECT OVERKILL CONTRA: LEGACY OF WAR Possibly the most violent shoot 'em up ever written. Like Contra, Overkill is isometric 3D, and uses some clever special effects to keep the action moving. It's a fastpaced one-player infiltration mission, in which players kill or be killed in the most horrible ways imaginable. Close range attacks see enemies bashed over the head until their skulls crack. Further away and a single gun blast will blow a hole right through an assailant's body. Not pretty. The play area is a labyrinth of corridors accessed by doors and blowing holes in walls. To keep everything in full view, transparencies replace walls when your character approaches them. Also rooms don't appear on screen until entered, which adds to the suspense. Overkill incorporates 51 missions, spanning three alien worlds. A behind-the-scenes report next month. MAJOR DAMAGE All that Capcom had running at the show was a video tape of the game running on a booth which had Sega Saturn written above it. But judging from the smooth animation, I, DEVELOPERS FOR: SATURN, PLAYSTATION, PC CD-ROM along with everyone else, am certain it was arcade footage. Still Capcom are promising perfection with Street Fighter Alpha 2, so I suppose we'll find out the truth in August. A special effect unique to PlayStation Contra is a 3D mode, allowing certain stages to be viewed through 3D glasses. Unfortunately the Saturn cannot achieve this affect. Still the gameplay remains the same in both versions: one or two players choose between four mercenaries, the new characters are a female cyborg and a para-military robot. They're armed with flamethrowers, pulse rifles, homing lasers, and rockets to name some of many. To further aid them the vehicles are back with a vengeance! The tank is here, alongside jeeps, helicopters, planes, tanks, hoverbikes and hovercraft. Bundle this all together in a number of so far unspecified exotic locations, and As Slasher Quan pointed out last month, Major Damage is you have mayhem on a scale that most other devela two-player take on the Gunstar Heroes/ Contra theme, opers seem incapable of imagining. The only bad with Captain Quazar look-alikes instead of Anime style gun news is that the game isn't due even in America until slingers or mercs. Personally I'm not sure about the graph: early 1997.

Basically what this means is that fighters may choose to step toward and to the side, or vice-versa, when attacking or defending. X-ing is inseperable from any martial arts technique, and as keen practicioners themselves, 47Tek made sure this was one of the first staples to be included. Also revolutionary is the ability to change course mid-technique: most, if not all, moves per character share a common lead point. So a side kick can be switched to a front kick in the blink of an eye. Just like real martial arts. Yet another unique feature is the possibility of injury which affects performance. I'll let you into that secret next month, as it's very clever indeed. Kumite is currently eight fighters strong nine if you include the boss character. However Konami the final version could boast around twenty.

Final Doom is based on Doom Custom Play Edition, and is said to include a further three \"horrific\" episodes, featuring terrible scenes unavailable in any other version of the game.

Presented in real time 3D, the action is slick and fast with the N64 hardware showing no signs of strain as the virtual camera pans and zooms to capture all the action. The C buttons enable players to view the rink from any angle through 360°, while the camera closes in on specific action scenes to highten the excitement. The solid 3D models ar individually based on Stanley cup hockey athletes. Wayne Gretsky-proclaimed as \"the best skater on Earth\" no less became personally involved with the design and mechanics of the game. The N64 enables greater depth of play than any other ice hockey simulation, while providing enough pazzazz to satisfy thrill seekers in the arcade. No doubt the NHLPA license will work wonders for sales, though anybody will appreciate the digitized MIDI music, and crystal clear sound effects comprising of fog horns, crowd rumble, and, of course, much grunting and crashing into barriers. The NHLPA Presents... should be available for N64 at launch in the US. WAR GODS Play as Rain on an MK2 background! No compromises were necessary at all!

Project leader Jim Gentile was at the show to promote his game, and the Digital Skin technology which characterises the look of the game wrap around textures of digitised actors. As reported from teh ACME in America, War Gods' gameplay is close to Mortal Kombat's, with the addition of a huge green 3D button to enable specific 3D manoeuvres. The cheesy plot is being developed into a comic book series as a promotion for when the home versions are unleashed. CVG's coverage of War Gods should continue apace as of next month.  This historic, hardcore shoot 'em up lives again this time in 3D. At the show, Williams weren't sure if Robotron X was PlayStation exclusive or not, though they had a Win '95 version up and running, plus there was talk of an N64 translation. Whatever, Robotron X  recaptures the spirit of the original arcade game, which spawned such games as Smash TV and Total Carnage.  The sound effects especially are pure analogue distor tion delight! Two joysticks are used to control the main character one for movement, the other for indepenident directional fire. The idea is to shoot everything  except the hostages, a task which causes the entire  play area to erupt in a constant shower of multicoloured particles. There are over 100 levels of this thing, plus three styles of bonus rounds. It may look  pretty basic, but this game is the coolest thing since Tempest 2000. Possibly even greater.

"computer Video games INDEPENDENCE DAY EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS, THIS SUMMER... The plot is not unlike that of War Of The Worlds aliens attack Earth, the American military fights back and interplanetary war takes place in all major American cities. The special effects however, promise to be truly out of this world! Independance Day is coming and it's being touted as the hottest of this year's summer blockbusters! Picture if you will, 15-mile wide motherships casting massive shadows over the 30 biggest cities in the World. Picture airbases being destroyed by swarms of foo fighters. Picture tidal waves of fiery death ripping up streets like they're mere tablecloths. Picture the White House being OBLITERATED! RESISTANCE IS FUTILE, PUNY EARTHLINGS! Inside are gross cashew-nut headed alien monsters (see Paul's editorial pic for details). Yeh? Well, you've just pictured a few of the scenes that punctuate Independance Day, so called because the invasion begins on the Fourth of July weekend. This apocalyptic rehash of the classic sci-fi B-movie is the brainchild of the boffins responsible for last year's intergalactic action spectacular, Stargate. At a cost of over $60 million dollars, the film stars such luminaries as Will Smith (the Fresh Prince, who else?) as a US soldier and Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park, The Fly) as your stereotypical quirky scientist. As in Jurassic Park though, the real stars are NOT going to be human. So what do the aliens look like? Well, you can guarantee that's going to remain one of the film's biggest secrets. Perhaps right up till the very end. But to give us a clue, the film's creators reckon the plot ties in neatly with all the modern-day mythology about the Roswell Incident, crop circles and alien abduction. So perhaps we can expect the currently fashionable 'greys' to make an appearance. Or ET. But not ALF. The invasion force is set to hit the UK on August 9. MEANWHLE, ON THE DARK SIDE OF MARS. UNITED STATES OF AME The 'alien invasion' movie is obviously the current in thing, because famed bizarro film director Tim Burton (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas) also has one up his sleeve, in the form of Mars Attacks! A film based around the popular 1950's Topps trading cards. If you've ever seen the cards (they were re-released two years ago, complete with 90's update cards by the likes of 2000AD artist Simon Bisley), you'll have a fair idea what the film is going to be like. Skull-faced aliens in goldfish bowl helmets, armed with disintegration rays, perform all manner of dispicable acts on the human race, even going so far as to enlarge Earth's insects. Some of the cards were so gruesome (most notably 'No.36 Destroying a dog') they were actually banned in the 50s! Expect plenty of tongue-in-cheek B-movie weirdness from this one! On O ITS NOT OVER YET! And, just to round of this month's alien invasion madness, Fresh and The Fly. Groovin' coolsters! Midway have just released an Attack From Mars pinball table. The name should give you a fair idea where the table gets its inspiration, as bubble-headed aliens deck out the set up, as do flying saucers, US air bases and giant insects. Great stuff!

Yet more of your cravings. Nintendo 64 is once again the hottest object of your desires, unsurprisingly. But all things Street Fighter seem to be consuming your waking moments too. THIS CENTURY Although nothing new on VF3 has surfaced this month, it was still the most technically impressive thing seen at the E3. So imagine our shock (make that palpitating fear) to hear that Tekken 3, currently in the works, is claimed to be even more technically impressive than VF3! Naturally, to match (or even better) AM2's new Model 3 technology, something a good deal more advanced the Namco's current 1 NINTENDO 64 2 QUAKE 3 VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 4 MARIO 64 5 KILLER INSTINCT 6 STREET FIGHTER 3 7 STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2 8 VIRTUA COP2 9 SONIC PLATFORM GAME 10 SUPER STREET FIGHTER ALPHA ARCADE N64 SNES ARCADE SATURN / PS SATURN SATURN DAYTONA REMIX IT DOES EXISTI top-end System 22 board is needed. Enter System 33, rumoured to based on the new Power VR graphics acceleration technology on PC. At its most basic level, Power VR is claimed to be 30% more powerful than the PlayStation with all the PS's effects in use. However, multiple Power VR sets can be linked in parallel, to create enough power to generate two million polygons-per-second. If true, that's twice as many as Model 3! Gulp. Power VR has yet to be released in commercial form, Heihachi in fully-rendered glory. If VF3 is anything however, it's true to go by, Tekken 3 should look as good as this. that Namco are involved with the new chipset. In immense Model 3 would be something fact, they've already created a else entirely. Tekken 3 isn't going to be highly impressive running demo of ready until early 1997. In the Rave Racer on it, which looks meantime, We're going to take a particularly awesome. hands-on look at the Power VR board Of course, a conversion of System next month, which, it's claimed, will 22 Rave Racer is one thing. sell for only ! And we'll have Actually outshining the frankly Rave Racer on PC too! Other Most Wanteds that just failed to make the chart are VF Kids on Saturn, Daytona Remix again, Sonic 4 on Megadrive, a 64-bit upgrade for PlayStation, and the new 32-bit Nintendo handheld. And one that touched our hearts Sega and Nintendo joining forces! Keep sending your Top 3 Most Wanteds, in the order of importance. Do that for us and we won't bin your mail straight away. Contents Page Ves, while the game failed to make the show, we've heard from an extremely reliable source that it is DEFINITELY in the works. The name has yet to be revealed Daytona Remix and Daytona Deluxe are the two current favourites but it's known the game is being coded in Japan. NOT however, by AM2. Don't fret though, because it's in the hands of the more-than-capable CS Team the people who worked with AM2 on Megadrive Virtua Racing, 32X VR Deluxe (hence the Deluxe moniker again) and Saturn Sega Rally. Daytona Remix is claimed to be graphically superior to the Sega Rally conversion, with two extra courses included. Also, the Sega advertising for the game is going to feature the yellow and red manual-transmission Hornet as its main image. Of course, the biggest question, and it's the main reason people have been demanding a Daytona Remix, is over an arcade-perfect translation. When Sega improve that clipping and hopefully (just as important) the resolution, we hope they leave in an authentic arcade mode, before adding the extras. Arcade-perfect Daytona, that's what we want! Possibly more next month. NAMCO PLAYSTATION LIGHT GUN COMING! 1 News/Readers charts 2 Official Charts Retro Computer Cabin 4 Tel's Tips | 6 Night Warriors 8 Drawins wot you dun 10 Tekken 2 guide Word has it, Namco are currently making their own light gun for the PlayStation. Unlike the Konami light gun already available, this one will have kickback in it, meaning that it will shake with recoil whenever a shot is fired, just like Namco's arcade light guns. To do this it needs to be either battery-powered or run from the mains somehow. Having recoil in the gun is a good indication that Namco have finally decided to make the excellent Point Blank and possibly the System 22 game Time Crisis for the PlayStation, something many people thought would never happen. With the gun having costly moving parts and also running from batteries or the mains, it's likely to be expensive maybe up to -. We're big fans of Point Blank, and an arcade-perfect conversion of this, complete, with the excellent gun will be brilliant! Details are still very vague, at the moment, so we don't have a release date, but we hope that the gun and at least one game will be out by the end of this year. 15 Classified ads 15 Fanzines 16 Reader ad form "
