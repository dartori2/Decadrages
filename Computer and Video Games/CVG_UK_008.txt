"ITIONCOMPETITIONCOMI NEXT CRUNCH Can you Beat The Bug on our give-away front cover puzzle and win a BBC Microcomputer? A much-sought-after BBC micro will be despatched to the winner of our Beat-the Bug competition. The puzzle can be done with out a computer. Just punch out the small tokens on the bottom of the card and place them on the puzzle as indicated. Then the task is to move the data from computer Z into computer A and replace it with the data from computer A. But there is a Bug floating about to make things awkward. The rules of the puzzle are: Move two pieces of data first, then move the Bug.  From here data and Bug are moved alternately. Data can only move towards its destination. Only one piece can occupy a location at any time. The Bug can move in either direction. Moves are along the lines to neighbouring locations. It may look deceptively easy but it does take some careful thinking to work out the answer. More importantly it should take a good deal of careful thought before attempting a program to solve it. It is more difficult than the four octagons puzzle we set you with in our first issue. The response to that first puzzle took us by surprise we weren't expecting 800+ solutions but this time we think we're ready for you. We are working out a reasonable time to solve the puzzle so please write on your program how long it takes to come up with the answers. The objectives are first: to produce the best program to solve the puzzle; to find out how many solutions there are; to find out how many distinctly different solutions there are (discounting reflections and rotations) and what the shortest solution is. Finally to discover if it is possible to get the Bug to end up in the middle or not. The program will be judged on the following criteria: Does it run correctly (bug free)? Does it find the solutions? How fast does it find a solution? Does it find all solutions and how quickly? Concise programming. Good use of memory space. Imaginative algorithms. Is it self contained? Presentation. Write the program on any sort of computer, or just in plain Basic and send it as a listing or a cassette to us before June 16. We will include a way of solving the puzzle next issue -just to prove that it is possible. Send it in to Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8, Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JB. The judges' decision is final and no correspondence can be entered into. Make sure you include a name and address and the time the program takes to find one solution. Also be sure to let us know what machine it runs on. Pacman gave arcade managers plenty of food for thought. In America it was the first video game which proved attractive to women and brought a family touch to the video industry. In such a male-oriented world as the video industry we wondered if British arcade owners will follow the American business thinking which has since spawned Ms Pacman! Are women worth exploiting? We find out in July. Imhotep the pyramid builder is our featured game next issue. Upon the desert of the east, the first pyramid was raised and the strain on the entire country was great indeed, can you guide your workforce of 1000s to success in the desert?

"CPGTOB: tests whether any pieces are constrained by the Pawn structure The initial version of the program was written in RT-11 Macro for PDP-11 computer and occupied approximately 5K words of memory. A much improved and extended version in POP-2 for a DEC-20 computer is currently being developed. Neither program is commercially available. As an example of the program in action, here is how it solves last month's second challenge problem. In figure two, the rightmost Pawn has been carelessly placed between squares g2 and h2. Where should it be? It is White to move and you know there have been no underpromotions. There is more to chess problems than: What Happens Next? It is also possible to ask: What Has Happened? I left you with two \"retrograde analysis\" problems last issue with an invitation to look back into the history of the position. In figure one, the problem is which side made the last move? As with many retrograde analysis problems, the key to solving it is to ask what was the last move. If you try this you will find that white has no legal last move e.g. Pawn from b4 to b5 is not a possibility why? But Black has several e.g. Kd4-c5. So Black moved last. It might seem that programming a reverse move generator for Chess is straightforward, but in fact it is extremely awkward. Suppose that White has a Bishop on c8 say. It could have reached there by an ordinary move or by a capture. Alternatively it could have moved to c8 as a promoted Pawn from c7 or as a capture with promotion from b7 or d7. A Black Pawn on g6 might-in general have reached there from f7. g7 or h7 but the one on g6 in figure one has obviously come from f7. How can this obviousness be programmed? As part of an artificial intelligence (A.I.) project, a researcher in Britol, Brian Alden, has recently written a program which reasons out the solutions to quite a number of retrograde analysis problems. Among the routines used by the program are the following: PCMOV: generates possible reverse moves for a specified side LEGCHK: checks legality of reverse moves ISKCHK: tests whether a King is in check KCHECK: identifies moves which could have placed a King in check WHPCAP: determines which men could have been captured on a specified square such a check could occur. The White Rook could have moved to b5 possibly with a capture. A White Bishop or Queen could have moved from b3 to c2, to uncover check, and then be captured by the Black King. A Knight move from b4 to c2 is impossible, since two White Knights are still on the board and there have been no underpromotions. The Queen moves from b3 to c2, Rook moves from b3 or b4 to b5 and non-capturing Rook moves from c5, d5 or e5 are eliminated, since in each case ISKCHK returns the information that the Black King is still in check. This leaves only a Rook capture from c5, d5 or e5, or a Bishop move from b3 to c2 as explanations of the check on the Black King. Next, WHPCAP is used to determine which Black men have been captured on b5.  The captured man cannot be the Black Queen's Rook, since that piece is found by CPGTOB to be constrained to move on squares a8 and b8 only. It cannot be the King's Bishop, since that piece moves on the wrong colour squares. It cannot be a Queen or a Pawn, since either case White would have been in check and there is no previous legal move by Black which would eliminate this check. This exhausts all possible captures on b5. This leaves only one possibility: Black's last move was with the King from b2 to c2, capturing a White Bishop which has just moved from b3, discovering check. The home square of this Bishop is fl. If the carelessly placed White Pawn were on g2 the Bishop would be constrained and unable to leave fl to be captured. The White Pawn must therefore be on h2 in figure two! LA Fig 1 Fig 2 To arrive at a solution the program performs the following chain of reasoning. Since Black moved last, PCMOV generates all possible reverse moves for Black, namely Nbl-a3, Nbl-d2, Ndl-b2, Ndl-e3, Kc2-d2 and Kc2-b2. LEGCHK now checks the legality of each of these moves.  The Knight moves all place the White King in check, so these moves are eliminated. Kc2-d2 places the Black King in check by White's Bishop on el detected by routine ISKCHK. Routine KCHECK cannot find any legal way in which White could have delivered check, so the check is imaginary and Black's move is eliminated. Kc2-b2 also places the Black King in check. This time KCHECK returns the following possibilities as to how By Max Bramer "

"UC GO BY ALAN SCARFF BY ALAN SCARFF GO TO WORK ON THE ZX81 adjacent to the last stone played. The subroutine can detect when it should stop and return to the main routine by using a repetitive process of \"sweeping\" its capture array. At each sweep it will either find another adjacent stone to extend the group, or it will not, in which case it can stop! Having used the subroutine to detect a captured group, it can also be used to check if the last move has attempted to capture itself. Such a move is illegal. This can be indicated by generating a noise or whatever else you consider appropriate! Go is in essence very simple. It comes as no surprise therefore that the basics of the game are easy to program. The short ZX81 BASIC program shown allows you to use your T.V. screen as a Go board. The program is no advance on the traditional board. It is merely a starting point for better things to come! The most obvious extension is to add in the rules of play. A A B C D E F G H major element, capture, takes Fig place when stones are closely surrounded by the opposing force. Wouldn't it be nice if we 8 could make the program remove captured stones automatically? 7 At first sight this seems straightforward enough — the 6 program must check that a single stone or a group adja 5 cent stones of the same colour has no further liberties adjacent vacant points. But as with many programming exercises, there are logic traps just waiting for the unwary! First, we must consider moe than one group, each independently.

Figure 3 shows the order of detection of the stones in one of the captured groups. STEP 1 puts stone 1 on the capture array. STEP 2 places stones 2 and 3. STEP 3 sweeps the capture array to find and place stone 4. STEP 2 then places stone 5. Finally STEP 3 fails to find a fresh extension to the group and so returns with the list of captured stones. "

"Adventure DIAMONDS AND CLAWS Scott Adams' adventures are always full of mystery and excitement, and have set something of a standard on the Micro Adventure scene. So it's about time we had a look at another of his works. Savage Island, part one, is one of the most devious games that I have played. The object is not to collect treasures, but to obtain the password needed to commence part two. Who could resist buying the sequel after such a struggle? At the outset, one finds oneself on a deserted beach on a tropical island. A stroll around reveals an impenetrable jungle, a plain, a shark-infested ocean and an extinct volcano. It all seems like a very routine exploration job. Even after working out how to keep at bay the bear who inhabits the cave at the top of the volcano a problem that you will spend hours sweating over-things seem to be going quite well... except for the lingering sense of Now that we have covered the basics of Adventure programming pardon the pun! — we are ready to have a look at some of the intricate parts. When you first started writing your game, no doubt the word SCORE seemed very remote from your problems. Nevertheless, most Adventure games have a SCORE feature, the score usually being based on the number of treasures deposited in a special treasure storage location. Let us code a score feature awarding say 10 points per treasure deposited in location LT. First it will be necessary for the treasures to be recognised and not confused with \"ordinary\" objects. If obvious descriptions like DIAMOND or GOLD BAR are used, the player is probably in little doubt, but the computer won't be terribly impressed. Therefore, all treasures in the object array should be grouped together in a block, say from 0$(n) to O$(n+m). The command SCORE can then execute a routine like: SC = 0: REM SC is score zero to start count FORE I = (n) TO (n+m) IF P(I) = LT THEN SC = SC +10 NEXT Q1$ = \"You have scored\"; SC : GOTO (start) If the treasure descriptions are less obvious, like AMBER CLAW, then even the player may be in doubt as to its value. A way round this is to identify each treasure with a special symbol such as an asterisk or a diamond alongside its description, for example * AMBER CLAW* Thus, treasures no longer have to be grouped together in the array, although doing this will still help to reduce the scan of the object array. We can now have: SC = 0 FOR I = 0 TO (n) : REM Object array has (n+1) elements IF P(I) = LT AND LEFT$(0$(I),1) = \"*\" THEN SC = SC +10 NEXT Q1$ = \"You have scored\"; SC : GOTO (start) No doubt you are wondering if you will now have to type ** DIAMOND*\" to reference a diamond that's a treasure. You don't, but I will explain the way round this next month. A couple of points to beware of. The treasure stores will be frequently visited once discovered, and could well become a depository for all sorts of rubbish as well as treasures. When this location is visited and the objects present are displayed, towards the end of the game the display variables may not have sufficient capacity to contain all the objects, or the amount of string space available for the concatenation of these objects may be insufficient. This may result in truncation of the object/treasure list, or cause the program to \"hang up\" whilst the machine searches for free string space, possibly breaking with an Out of String Space error. If the variables won't hold all the objects, establish more variables, then work on the string space problem increase it by a hundred or so. This may now lead to an Out of Memory error, in which case revert to the working version of the string space, and restrict the number of objects that can be deposited at the location by limiting them to treasures only. To do this you will need to modify the DROP routine to detect the asterisk, and if not found reply with a message like \"SORRY, ONLY TREASURES MAY BE DROPPED HERE\". Meanwhile, to round off the SCORE routine, don't forget to bring the game to an end it all treasures are home, by following the NEXT line by: IF SC = 100 THEN (clear screen): PRINT \"Congratulations, you have won\" : END unease after having examined the stone head back on the beach. But it's easy to forget about that, trying to survive hurricanes and investigating bangs and bumps in the night. Is the island all it seems? Where are those vital tools we became certain we needed some two months ago and still haven't found? There is indeed something very sinister afoot, and it seems our old chortling friend from Pirate's Island is lurking around somewhere. So startling is the finale to this first part, that having been clever enough to get the password, I can't wait to find out what happens in part two. Savage Island is published by Adventure International and versions are available for TRS-80, Video Genie, Apple, Exidy Sorceror, And Atari computers. BY KETH CAMPBELL "

Keep a close check on which of your players seem to lose possession and play badly, these are the one's you will want to substitute. A good substitution will improve your play a bad one will give the opposition more chance. Also watch for which team is gaining the most possession in midfieldyou may need to change your formation or tactics here. Check on how the goals are scored it could be important to tighten up your defence to certain situations or to find out which of your own attacking ploys is paying dividends. Half-time comes around and this is your chance to change your tactics if you have noticed things going wrong. At the end of the day, win, lose or draw, you will have to sit back and watch the other results of the day being typed out and see if your predictions are coming true. And on you go, hopefully towards a place in the final. The game is run on exactly the same lines as the World Cup with the winners of Group 1 going into Group A and the runners-up into Group C; Group 2 winners into Group B and runners-up into Group D; Group 3 winners into Group A and runners-up into Group C; Group 4 winners into Group C and runners-up into Group A; Group 5 winners into Group D and runners-up into Group B; Group 6 winners into Group B and runners-up into Group D. The first semi-final is between the winners of Group A and C and the other between the winners of Group B and D. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 35 "

"S.P.E.E.D.B.0AT FINDING the source of the Mackenzie River by speedboat can be a real challenge in the logging season. A lot of lumbering is going on and the thoughtless treefellers are sending their timber down river with little regard to life and limb. The Mackenzie River follows the usual watery logic, being slow and sluggish at first but speeding up as you approach its source and after a score of 2,500 has been reached it narrows, becoming faster and more difficult for would-be discoverers to negotiate. Another 1.000 points and it is still more difficult. A good boatsman will spot the most favourable currents and steer for them. These are shown as bonus points on the river. The game is simple but it will suit the dexterous and those who can look ahead. It is for one person to steer the boat up-river, trying to miss the logs and hit the bonus scores as they flash upon the screen. To steer the boat use the two cursor keys for left and right. The program runs as fast as it does because the river is printed onto the screen in a fast working statement and as the boat is poked onto the very top of the screen, each print statement pushes it totally off the screen, so only one poke statement is needed. A graphically exciting and neatly playable game, difficult enough to become addictive. BY STEVEN HOLLIDAY The variables used are: MS is high score. T IS tab distance for river. M is the car position. VV is the position ready to add to Y to create the trees. S is the players score lis general for next loops X is random number to create the logs' numbers and tab value Y is position of trees VX is colour position from trees. A$ is boat movement. D$ is Y/N to play again variable. AE$ is the name of the person with the high score. T$ general get statement variable. V is volume controller. S2 is sound generator. RUNS ON A VIC-20 IN 3K 50-160 is main body of program. 7000-8000 is music routine. 5000-6000 the instructions. 8000-9000 is the medium width river. 9000is thin river. 6000-7000 is data for music. 1000-2000 is high score routine. 160-1000 prints score and asks if another go is required. 82&83 makes the trees grow. 120-137 checks next position of craft.

"SAVE THE PRI N AD Baron Megabyte has imprisoned the beautiful Princess Minnie on the top floor of his nine storey castle. She is guarded by his minions who have orders to trample any intruder to death. Armed with your magic crossbow, you, the brave knight Gothur Lothur Botha, hate find the keys to release her and then guide her to safety for a fairytale ending You will find one key hidden on each of the lower nine floors of the castle. On each floor there are four hiding places. One of these contains a key, two are empty, and the last one could be empty or contain a sleeping enemy — who will not like being Woken up. Obstructions to your quest are scattered around the castle, but you can blast your way to safety or kill an enemy with one of your nine magic crossbow bolts. During your search for the keys an enemy might pop up suddenly when you have just mounted the stairs to the next floor. And the Bad Baron tends to move the keys around when you are not looking. You use the keys I, J, L, and M to make your moves and press CTRL and one of those keys to fire in a certain direction. The program was written in Acorn Atom, BASIC, and this should help in translating for other machines. For example, the Atem's screen consists of 16 rows of 32 columns, and the second row starts at 8020, so change lines 15, 121, and 125 to suit your own machine. The program should then run. The characters used to represent stairs, hiding places and other features are defined at the beginning and you can change them easily For those with Microsoft-style BASIC, use eg D$ \"D\". Line 30 provides an INKEY$ FUNCTION, so for other BASIC's change line 100 to 100 K$= INKEY$. After defining variables, line 35 GOSUB's to the end of program text, so you can expand your introduction as much as memory space will allow. Lines 40 and 50 reset variables at the beginning of the game, Line 40 starts with a function which ensures a random value for an address within the screen's limits. Line 50 uses a byte array and can be replaced by G$=\"0123456789\". New floors start at line 60 with a bleep and one second wait, followed by a row of information written to the top line of the screen. Line 65 POKE's obstructions are the random locations. Lines 75 and 80 place the hides on the screen. Line 82 puts a key in one of them and gives a 1 in 4 chance of an enemy sleeping in one of the other hides. The array EE allows this extra one. Line 85 and 87 invert the floor numbers where you have found keys, and also puts your player onto the screen. Lines 110-115 convert the up-down-left-right choice to a screen address increment. Line 130 checks to see if a move would go off the screen. Line 145 reads the \"fire\" button so the same information is available to set direction of fire. Before making a move the program looks at what is already there. If it is a hide a \"W\" character replaces an \"H\" character. If it is a key line 195 does a computed GOTO on an integer division on the floor number by nine. The program then branches to line 100 for all floors except nine, when it branches to line 3000. By changing an enemy's character from \"H\" to \"E» for hide characters you will have to step aside to avoid being trampled if you find an enemy. The enemy move is made in lines 300 to 350. To make the lower floors easier on your way up the number of enemy is kept constant — line 310. But the enemy move is only made if the character at the specified address is \"E\". The routine only moves them up and down the screen but it is possible to make them move sideways. If the enemy does get you your remains are marked with a cross in line 340. Program variables: A own position. B bolts. C change of address. D Cown stair character. E enemy character. EE9 enemy address. F floor number. G9 byte array, 0?9 if not got key. H hiding place character. HH3 hiding place address. I loop variable. K key pressed number. KKO lable for assembly code. L key character on screen. M Mecharacter (O=dead). N address of speaker. O obstruction character. P Princess rescued. Q quickest time. R random choice. S start of second row of screen. T time taken. U upstair character. V enemy killed. W3 what's in the hide. Y previous best number of kills. Z last address of screen. 50 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"sinclair selection Computer and Video Games proudly presents two more exciting games for your Sinclair ZX81. Beat off an unearthly attack from the stars in War of the Worlds and win yourself a small fortune in Bet, a racecourse gambling game. We aim to cater for all kinds of Sinclair user so we've chosen one IK epic and one 16K special for you to play. So keep your finger on the laser fire button and don't lose your shirt... Those nasty Martians are at it again. This time they are swooping from the sky to attack your laser base and smash it into the ground. You can fend them off by firing an invisible laser beam at them. The laser base is printed at the bottom of the screen. You can move it left and right using the 'P' and 'A' keys. The Martians appear at random positions on the screen and move down towards you. You must line up your base below them and use the l' key to fire then. If they land on top of you the game will end. If you manage to score 1000 the scoring rate will be doubled and the Martians will mutate into another form.

The horses are represented by the inverse graphics characters 1-5. If you win your stake is multiplied by the number of the winning horse. If you lose the computer will subtract your stake from your total. Then you have the opportunity of betting again on another. The variable M sets up the value of your money.

"DOC STAR ADVENTURE The evil General Doom is holding Princess Leya, the leader of the Forces of Freedom, captive on his ship. He captured her ship-bound for a secret command centre on the planet Harris Seven. He has also captured her entire treasury of Melidium Crystals, the currency of the galaxy Princess Leya is wearing a Shinestone necklace. Encoded in one of the stones is the location and strength of her Freedom Fighting Force. Through the medium of your computer you can roam the ship and attempt to rescue the Princess. Even if you do not manage the rescue you must try to disrupt Doom's plans for the galaxy. There are guards all over the ship and you could be easily caught and imprisoned e computer understands several ordinary English commands such as GET and DROP. Other words that you can use are HELP, INVEN, LOOK, and SCORE. There are more but you must discover these yourself RUNS ON A TRS-80 BY LANCE MICKLUS 150 CLEAR200: RANDOM: DEFINTA-7 200 GOSUB30300 450 LC-2:SL=64: BL = 4:6F=50: Ry=16396 600 60T010300 2125 IFTC250RRND (GFX<>1 THEN2425 2150 IFTC=300LETOF=20 2175 IFLC<3ORLC=90RLC-260RLC=360RLC-37THEN2425 2200 IFLCY26ANDLC<31 THEN2425 2225 PRINT\"Holy saokes.

"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING REPEAT update display handle input UNTIL game over. THE WAY TO BETTER PROGRAMS the body of the loop must be performed at least once. 5. WHILE condition DO procedure. Test condition; if true perform procedure then loop back to test condition again; if false continue with the next section of the program. Note that here the test is performed first, so that the body of the loop need not be performed at all. 6. CASE i OF procedure I, procedure 2...., procedure n. If i is 1 perform procedure 1, if i is 2 perform procedure 2, etc, The essential property of these structures is that they each have a single entry point at the beginning and a single exit point at the end. This makes it possible to write a program outline where the logical flow proceeds straight through from beginning to end. It is not possible to write Basic code like this because GOTO statements make the logical flow of the program jump around all over the place. SIMPLE GAMES Basic was designed to be easy to learn, so that people who are not professional programmers can write simple programs for themselves. It is not easy to write long, complicated programs in any language, and is particularly difficult in Basic for several reasons, the main reason being the lack of suitable control structures. In order to write a Basic program that works properly it is necessary to begin by designing the program carefully, and producing a detailed specification before beginning to write the code. Top-down structuring is a method of program design where we begin with a general description of the program. Step by step. we add more details of the procedures the program must perform until we have a description that is sufficiently detailed to allow us to specify the data structure and write the code. We need to use only a few simple structures in the description: 1. A sequence of procedures that are executed one after the other. 2. IF condition THEN procedure. If condition is true perform procedure, otherwise continue with the next section of the program. 3. IF condition THEN procedure 1 ELSE procedure 2. If condition is true perform procedure 1; if condition is false perform procedure 2; then continue with the next section of the program. 4. REPEAT procedure UNTIL condition. Perform procedure, then test condition; if false loop back to procedure, if true continue with the next section of the program. Note that the test comes at the end, so that BY TED BALL 66 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES To illustrate top-down structuring I will show how a simple game program can be developed. The game is one that has been published in various forms, sometimes in the simple form described here, but usually in a more sophisticated form with extra features. The object of the game is to shoot down a plane which moves across the screen. The gun is fixed in the centre of the bottom line of the screen and is fired by pressing a single key. We begin with a trivial description of the program: REPEAT play game. UNTIL game over. To elaborate this we take the procedure \"play game\" and note that it can be divided into two parts, updating the display and handling input from the keyboard, so the description becomes: \"Update display\" involves moving the plane, moving the shell if one has been fired, and taking appropriate action if there is a hit. At first sight it may appear that we can expand it to: move plane IF shell fired THEN move shell IF hit THEN plane destroyed But if we look more closely at the possible positions of the plane and shell we see that we may have the shell immediately to the right of the plane so the plane will run into the shell. Or we may have the shell one place to the right and one line below, in which case the hit will occur after both the plane and the shell have been moved. Our next expansion of \"update display\" could be: move plane IF hit THEN plane destroyed IF shell fired THEN move shell IF hit THEN plane destroyed Before continuing with this part of the program we need to look at the \"handle input\" section. The description of the program says nothing about when and how often the gun may be fired. Program descriptions are often inadequate but top-down design will reveal where the deficiencies are. If the gun could be fired continuously there would be no point to the game, so we must introduce some restriction. Two possibilities are to provide a limited supply of ammunition, or to allow the gun to be fired once each time the plane starts on a new line. If we provide a limited supply of ammunition and allow the "


"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING Listing 1: Intermediate Program Description gun to be fired at any time while there is ammunition remaining, there could be several shells in motion at one time. To keep the program simple I will use the second possibility. The \"handle input\" procedure can now be expanded easily. We have to first check that the gun can be fired -which means that it has not been fired since the plane started on its present line and if so check for a key and fire a shell if the key has been pressed. The expansion may be written in stages as: IF gun enabled THEN handle input IF gun enabled THEN check keyboard IF key pressed THEN fire shell and finally: IF gun enabled THEN check keyboard IF key pressed THEN set initial shell position write shell to screen set \"shell fired\" flag clear \"gun enabled\" flag REPEAT move plane IF hit THEN plane destroyed IF shell fired THEN move shell IF hit THEN plane destroyed IF gun enabled THEN check keyboard IF key pressed THEN set initial shell position write shell to screen set \"shell fired flag clear \"gun enabled\" flag UNTIL game over. IF end of run THEN set up for new run. and expanding \"set up for new line\" and \"set up for new run\" we get: move plane position one place to right IF end of line THEN set plane position to start of next line decrease score value set \"gun enabled\" flag IF end of run THEN add 1 to plane count set plane position to start of screen set score value to initial value set \"gun enabled\" flag \"Move shell\" is expanded in a similar way, but remembering to delete the shell when it reaches the top of the screen: write blank to current shell position move shell position up one line IF off screen THEN clear \"shell fired\" flag ELSE write shell to new position \"Plane destroyed\" appears in two places and in the final program we will obviously want to implement it as a subroutine. To indicate this we will replace \"plane destroyed\" in the body of the program description by \"subroutine (plane destroyed)\" and put the expansion in a separate section at the end. The expansion of \"subroutine (plane destroyed)\" is straightforward: clear \"shell fired\" flag simulate explosion on screen add score value to player's score set up for new run with \"set up for new run\" being expanded in exactly the same way as before. This leaves the final test \"game over\" to be expanded. Since the game consists of shooting at a fixed number of planes \"plane count more than number of planes\" Putting these latest expansions into the program description of listing 1 gives the final program description shown in listing 2. This final description gives almost all the detail we need to write the program. THE LISTINGS Collecting together the sections that have been developed so far gives listing 1. From this we can see that the procedures we need to expand now are \"move plane\", \"move shell\" and \"plane destroyed\". When we expand \"move plane\" we must remember to check for the plane having reached the end of its run halfway down the screen or having reached the end of a line on the screen. Thus the first step in the expansion is: write blank to current plane position determine new plane position write plane to new plane position and for the next step we introduce the checks by expanding \"determine new plane position\" to: move plane position one place to right IF end of line THEN set up for new line Listing 2: Final Program Description REPEAT write blank to current plane position Imove plane position on place right IF end of line THEN set plane position to start of next line decrease score value set \"gun enabled\"' flag IF end of run THEN add 1 to plane count set plane position to start of screen set score value to initial value set \"gun enabled\" flag write plane to new position IF hit THEN subroutine (plane destroyed) IF shell fired THEN write blank to current shell position move shell position up 1 line IF off screen THEN clear \"shell fired\" flag ELSE write shell to new position IF hit THEN subroutine (plane destroyed) IF gun enabled THEN check keyboard IF key pressed THEN set initial shell position write shell to screen set \"shell fired flag clear \"gun enabled\" flag UNTIL plane count more than number of planes Subroutine (plane destroyed): clear \"shell fired\" flag simulate explosion on screen add score value to player's score add 1 to plane count set plane position to start of screen set score value to initial value set \"gun enabled\" flag COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 67 "

"THE IMPORTANCE OF CURVES... x-axis across the middle of the screen, so we place it along row 95. Assigning 90 dots vertically to the full amplitude of the sine wave gives the final, tided-up. Atom program 10 %S = 4 *PI255 20 CLEAR 4 30 MOVE 0,95 40 FOR I = 1 TO 255 50 %X = 1* %S 60 %Y = % (90 * SIN(%) *EXP ( %X/B)) + 95 70 DRAW I, %Y 80 NEXT 90 END If you want to produce interesting displays for your video games then it is essential to be able to draw curves. Straight lines tend to be characteristic of man-made structures and not of natural objects. Most high resolution graphics systems on micros have commands such as DRAW or PLOT for drawing straight lines, but do not have commands for drawing curves. For this reason, a curve has to be approximated by a series of linked line segments. The shorter the segments are, the more a realistic the approximation to the curve becomes. The limit to which this can be taken is determined by the resolution of the display screen. With any system having a screen resolution of, say, 256 by 192 or better, convincing curves can be drawn by joining points in adjacent screen columns as long as their vertical separation is not too great. These thoughts naturally lead to the problem of scaling. The basic idea with scaling is that when a particular curve is to be drawn it must be scaled magnified or diminished in such a way that it fits on the screen, and is also displayed to best effect. This is probably best illustrated by an example, so let us examine how to draw two cycles of a damped sine wave on the Atom's screen, which has a resolution of 256 by 192. With a damped sine wave, the size of the oscillations decreases as the waveform proceeds. The equation of the curve we shall plot is: Y = SIN (X) *EXP(X/8) Now two cycles are obtained by letting X vary from 0 to 47. To plot the curve across the screen with full resolution, we start with a dot in column 0, on the left of the screen, and repeatedly draw a line to a dot in the next column, doing this 255 times until we get to the right hand side. To make X increase from 0 to 47 in this pattern, it must be repeatedly increased by increments of 4 m/255. Thus the kernel of the program becomes FOR I = 0 TO 255 X = 1*(4 *PI255) Y SIN (X) *EXP(X/8) DRAWI, Y NEXTI However, the vertical axis still needs to be scaled. The curve shows to best effect with its Experimenting with this program by changing the numbers in it will give a further feeling for how the scaling, positioning and damping are achieved. To illustrate how simple matters such as scaling and positioning can be made, consider the drawing shown in the figure, which includes not only our curve, but also two axes and a label. It was drawn using a Hewlett-Packard HP7225A graph plotter attached to an HP 83 personal computer. The program that produced it is: 10 GCLEAR 20 SCALE 0, 4 *PI.-1.1 30 XAXIS O P12 40 YAXIS O 0.5 50 MOVE 0.0 60 S = 4* PI/255 70 FORX = S TO 4* PI STEP S 80 DRAW X, SIN (X) * EXP(X/8) 90 NEXT X 100 CSIZE 6, 0.5, 0.25 110 MOVE PI, 0.2 120 LABEL \"DAMPED SINE WAVE\" 130 END In this program the SCALE instruction in line 20 gives the lower and upper limits of the X values to be plotted and also of the Y values. All plotting can then be performed using the actual values to be plotted since the system can then automatically position them correctly. Of course, the HP personal computer is a sophisticated and expensive system, but its capabilities illustrate what can be done, and also the direction which graphics facilities for micros are likely to take.

"BY KEITH MOTT THE POWER OF THE ATON The only real way to extract them otherwise is to force the plastic moulding off and to remove the pins individually. You will have to replace the holder then, of course. The same applies to the larger sockets, although these are a little easier to differentiate between. One major point that does worry me about the Atom is the way Acorn have arranged the keyboard, however smooth it is to operate. Acorn recommend a quite simple way of installing it in the instructions. They also state that insulating washers should be used with the steel It is refreshing to see, in these times when the reliability of some newer machines has yet to be proven, an already well established product which can be expanded from a useful basic kit to a powerful multi-program microcomputer. I have been looking over a kit built Acorn Atom and found it to be just that. The Atom is a single board layout, measuring 14 by eight inches. The basic kit has an 8K BASIC and 2K of RAM but can be expanded to 12K RAM. The MPU is the trusty 6502 running at 1MHz, although there is a second crystal to run the Motorola video chip. Make sure which is which, as they are both the same size and shape. Only the numbers are different. The full QWERTY keyboard is mounted on the other side of the board from the components as is the speaker. The power supply is entirely separate, however. The Atom has an advantage over some of the smaller and more recent machines in that it has the facility for a 6522 Versatile Interface Adaptor (VIA) on the board. The Atom also allows for other input/outputs. There is a printer interface, which uses one half of the VIA, a standard CUTS interface for the recording or playing back of programs, a composite video and T.V. output. Not all of these are fitted as standard to the basic model, so find out which ones you are going to need before buying as it will be slightly cheaper. As there are 52 potential IC sockets on the board it is worth mentioning that 14 pin sockets will go into 16 hole sets, as will 14 and 16 into 18 hole sets. If you do solder in the wrong size it is often impossible to retrieve it unless you have an IC desolder ing tool for your soldering iron. silk screen overlay to help place the components. There are a few components, however, which have to have their legs bent quite considerably to get them positioned correctly. I am sure that some of the capacitors and especially the crystals could be damaged easily by this action by an overzealous assembler. Everything else seems to go in quite neatly even though the voltage regulators do look a little hidden from view by their common heat-sink. As is usual with the better designed kits the holes for the transistors are laid out for insulating pads although these are not included. Thankfully these transistors are of a larger body type than the ones which started off my campaign, and should tolerate a little more heat than those could. As all the IC holders are supplied take care that you insert the right chips in the right sockets. Fortunately, all the chips are orientated with pin one towards the top or right of the board, which helps considerably. Another point about orientation is the electrlytic capacitors which are used to smooth the power supply. They are scattered around about the regulators and vary in their direction of polarity. Each is marked with its own polarity as is the board where it resides, so there should be no excuse for getting it wrong. The Acorn Atom comes in a very sturdy case which is the size of many machines' keyboard alone. Even though not all the possible options are included in the basic kit the back panel is already cut out to accept them all. It would be a good idea to block up the larger holes to prevent dust and dirt from getting into the machine, so long as the regulators do not get too hot. The power supply, as I said is separate from the machine, and plugs into the back of the box. It is heavy enough to power all of the options and more. External power is available from one of the back connectors if required. screws to prevent shorting out of the keyboard matrix. This is because all but one of the screws falls between two adjacent pads. Although the model I was appraising did not have any washers, with the length of connector wire on each of the keys it is possible for them to short out despite this precaution. They also suggest that you do not sol. der each of the connections too heavily as you may break the plated through hole. It appears to me that it would be as easy to fracture the lead as it would the pad when the solder contracts as it cools. This would lead to an almost incurable fault as all the keys would have to be removed before repairs could be effected. I am sure the solid contact type would be preferable. The board has been constructed well on thicker-thanusual piece of fibreglass with "

"DOWN TO BASIC STORING AWAY YOUR SCORES examples of statements containing subscripted variables: 10 INPUT A(2),X,L1(10) 30 LET S = A(1) + A(2) 40 PRINT B(6) 25 IF A(1) = A(2) THEN 10 30 FOR I = A(N) TO AN+6) GETTING THINGS IN ORDER ... Sometimes it is necessary to store a set of related data items while processing them in a program. For example, you might want to store a set of game scores and then sort them into order. To do this you can store them in a list or, as it is sometimes known a one-dimensional array. To create such a list, you must first of all inform the computer of the name and size of the list. This is done by using a DIMension statement which takes the form (line no.) DIM (array-list) For example, 15 DIM A(30) would set up a list called A which could hold up to 30 data items. It is possible to declare several lists in one DIM statement. 20 DIM L1(5).L2(5),L3(100) In general, the rules for forming names of lists will be the same as those for forming names of variables. To refer to a particular item of a list, use subscripts enclosed in brackets after the name of the list. The subscript indicates the position of the item in the list. A(6) refers to the item in position 6 of the list called A. A subscript may be a constant, variable or any other valid arithmetic expression. If the value of the subscript is noninteger, then it will be truncated to an integer value. The value of the subscript should lie in the range: 1 -> (size of list) In some systems, the subscript may also take the value 0.) Elements of lists are sometimes referred to as \"subscripted variables\", and may be used in a manner similar to ordinary variables. The following are all BY MOIRA NORRIE 76 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES LISTS, STRINGS AND CHARACTERS It is also possible to have a list of character strings e.g. a list of names. Such a list may be created in a manner similar to a list of numeric values except that the name of the list is followed by a \"5\". 10 DIM A(10),N$(5) would set up a list A, comprising of up to 10 numeric values, and a list N5, comprising of up to five character strings. The subscripts of a string array follow the same rules as those of an ordinary onedimensional array (list), and the items of a string array may be used in a manner similar to string variables. A very common operation in computing is sorting a list of items into order e.g. sort a list of heights into ascending order, sort a list of names into alphabetical order. I will now look at a program that could be used to sort a list of 10 numbers into ascending order. I should point out that the method I shall use is only one of many sort methods. It is a fairly simple method but not the most efficient. The choice of a sort method depends on the number of items to be sorted and the attributes of these items. Many commercial applications involve sorting very large numbers of items in which case efficiency becomes very important. The method I shall describe should suffice for the most simple applications. This method basically consists of working through the list comparing pairs of adjacent items — "

The best way to understand the program is to work through it using pencil and paper with some sample data. In the worst case, all cycles would have to be performed before the numbers were in order. However, in many cases the numbers will be sorted before the last cycle. For this reason, a count of the number of swaps in any cycle is included. If in any cycle there are no swaps, then the numbers are in order and there is no need to continue. It is possible to have an array with more than one dimension. The commonest case being the twodimensional array — a table of related data items. Next month, will describe the use of these twodimensional arrays and I will also include an example showing the use of string arrays.

WILSON, (Dept CVG), 9 Cotswold Terrace, Chipping Norton, Oxon. The prospect of a low-cost colour computer supported by a company of Commodore's pedigree was the rich promise offered to the personal computer public last summer. The promise was some time being fulfilled as a large backlog of orders built-up while the bulk shipping of computers from the German factories was delayed. But the personal computer user is used to frustrations of this sort and waited patiently. Now the VIC is rewarding that patience with a quickly growing range of games and game peripherals and a sales figure of 15,000 a month. For your .99 (after VAT) you will receive the VIC computer complete with a QWERTY keyboard, a lead to plug into a home T.V. and a power supply lead. It comes complete with 3.5K of usable memory. The VIC's bright colours and graphics are well suited to gaming and a dozen firms are producing games software for the machine. The peripherals come from just a few firms but there is already a wide range. Names and addresses are laid out belowif an address is missing it will be included elsewhere.

Cassette Price .00 TLDIS & DLDIS You've bought a super maching-code program, but now wonder how it works. Maybe you even use a quick peek routine to glance through it when it was in memory If so you definitely noticed the complete lack of com ments in the code making it almost impossible for you to decipher and understand it. Well Instant Software's Labelling Disas semblers are the answer to your problem. TLDIS Tape-based Labelling Disassembler and DLDIS (Disk-based Labelling Disassem. bler make three passes to assign labels where appropriate to the routines in a machine language program. Their Output is almost identical to that of a hand-assembled source code. You can send the disassembly to a lineprinter (Radio Shack parallel port) for either TLDIS or DLDIS (The difference between these utilities is the storage mode of the disassembly) TLDIS can send the disassembly to cassette tape. DLDIS can send it to disk: both send it to the video monitor. The stored disassembly from TLDIS may be reassembled with Radio Shack's EDTASM the disassembly from DLDIS with Apparat's extension of EDTASM Because of the use of labels it is a simple matter to change any object code program by disassembling it and then making changes to the resultant source code without losing track of jump load addresses Labels start with \"AADO\" and increment up in even numbered steps (AAD2AA04, etc.) The odd numbers (AA01, AA03 etc.) are left for you to use for the source code during reassembly The printing of the disassembly may be temporarily halted by using (SHIFT(just as in basic) or it may be ended by pressing the BREAKI) key. It also has a comments column to display ASCH characters used in a LD or CP opcode TLDIS and DLDIS may be relocated in mem. ory to avoid conflict with the program you disassemble The next time you need to climb inside machine code program take TLDIS or DLDIS with you.
