It's a magical adventure into the world of computers — and includes sequences animated by computer. We asked our American friend Fred D'Ignazio to give us the run down on the movie which will rank with Star Wars and Star Trek as a sci-fi classic. His detailed article on the making of Tron appears on page 70 of this issue. There are some exciting stills from the film to give of taste of what you'll see on the big screen.

"INNOVATIVE TRS 80-GENIE SOFTWARE from the professionals JUMBO Fantastic new flying simulation Occasionally a program comes along of such magnitude that it is hard to describe it, especially within the space allowable in an advertisement. Jumbo is such a program. There have, of course, been flying simulation programs before, but they have all rather fallen into the trap of trying to produce a graphic representation of the ground at some stage or other in the program, thus taking up space, and/or they have concentrated on the single act of flying. In other words, although one gets the feeling of flying a small aircraft, one is not going anywhere. Jumbo is a fantastically accurate simulation of flying a Boeing 747. These planes are not small, and are not flown by eye. They are flown by eyes and instruments, and the instrument graphics in this simulation are really first class As you may know the primary instrument of an aircraft is the artificial horizon. This is simulated very well, and includes instrument landing approach indicators Graphic maps of very high quality are produced and it is possible to fly in all of the British Isles including Southern Ireland, and to New York on the Eastern U.S. seaboard. The actual airports are at London, Birmingham, Manchester Prestwick, Edinburgh, Belfast, Shannon and New York The program was written by two authors who combined their joint skills to produce a unique piece of software. The programmer got the last byte of performance out of the machine and the pilot the last drop of authenticity out of the simulation. Other simulation programs produce at best a similarity towards flying With Jumbo you really feel that you are behind the controls The authors have used a number of gimmicks and programming techniques. For instance, it is possible to switch on an automatic pilot and to jump forward in time in increments of one minute or one hour otherwise of course a flight from London to New York or vice versa would take some 8 hours to simulate. Whilst in this time skip the various controls are left as they are but fuel consumption and distance to go are taken forward at their correct rate. A chart is supplied containing various items of data which you will need, including the take-off data for a 747 with various take-off weights, flap retractions, climb and cruise speeds and descent distances Realising that not everybody can fly a 747 and that there is even a large proportion of the population that cannot fly anything, two important items of assistance have been added. First of all is the documentation. This is split into two parts. The second is a manual on flying the 747. In other words, the instructions for running the program. The first part, however, is what amounts to an instruction manual for flying. It assumes that the user knows nothing about aircraft and although we do not purport that it gets anybody up to any sort of standard after it has been assimilated, the reader should have sufficient knowledge of flying and the theory of flight to fly in the program itself. The second feature of assistance to the novice pilot is a feature in the program which enables the user to practice landings. When the program is started, if one presses the P key, the aircraft is automatically put 11 miles out from London Airport approaching on an instrument landing The controls are pretty well complete, even to dive and wheel brakes. The flying track may be continuously monitored on the map display. Bearing and distance to your intended point of landing are available all the time. The instruments, incidentally, consist of: Artificial horizon Attitude Fuel Aileron indicators Compass Elapsed time Indicated airspeed Turn indicator Distance to landing Power setting Flap indicator Rate of climb Elevators Altimeter Six maps may be chosen, as follows: Scotland, Northern England, Southern England, Ireland, Eastern U.S.A. The whole of the U.K. Route information and present position are shown on the map displayed. It is very difficult to think of any factor that the authors have overlooked. Even the quite meaningful thinning of the air with increasing height, which greatly affects the airspeed indicator in real life is taken into consideration. Rather than having a fixed stalling speed, this continuously changes with the flight configuration, the weight height and power setting again as it does in real life We like to think that we publish good programs. Jumbo is outstanding. It is available on tape or disk for 16K or 32K memory machines.

"What can you do with old copies of Computer & Video MONMA Games& They don't make very good paper hats and are not particularly adept at jamming delinquent Rampacks into place. So why not keep them for future reference in a bright glossy binder complete with a Computer & Video Games logo. Then when you want to look back and relive your favourite Bugs script, or check up on that obscure company which produces a speech-synthesising joystick for the UK 101, which we mentioned in Hardcore, then you will have a ready library of neatly packaged C&VG issues, looking as good as the day you picked them off your newsagent's shelf. More details and a form to fill in on page 17. Don't be ashamed of the bugs that find their way into your programs, take them out with you. Computer & Video Games is the only magazine which can put a Bug on your chest. We have a new line in T-shirts which feature a rampaging Bug, behaving in the manner we have come to expect from Screaming foul-up. Turn to page 17 to see what awaits your chest. Not getting a regular copy of Computer & Video Games eh! How do you expect your micro to work proper if you aren't reading the magazine every issue? And you with a nice little computer like that too. It would be a real shame if anything should happen to it. Vulnerable things computers especially if someone should start poking them around. Spose one day you dropped a line into your computer and didn't get a byte huh? Of course, I can't promise that if you had a regular copy of C&VG on order, your rampack would mysteriously stop wobbling overnight ... but who can tell eh... Just fill in the coupon, right, or I'll let you see your sister again, you know what I mean? To my newsagent: Please deliver/ reserve me a copy of Computer and Video Games every month. Price 75p. Name. Address NEXT you who have read this issue's piece on Tron and can't wait to find out more about this amazing film. All this just one month away... A Sharp Defender game which has produced \"Ooohs\" MONIMA and \"Aaahs\" of delight in the C&VG office when we tried it out, will be gracing our October issue. This is the issue which puts the capital G back in the games section of our magazine and we think we have picked out 10 games which will prove an inspiration to all our aspiring programmers. October is also the last issue of entries eligible for our programmer of the year competition and the standard should prove pretty high. So please write in and let us know which game gets your vote. Also for perusal next month, is Space Watch, a game which takes a very different look at invaders from outer space .. you have to befriend them! Will it ever catch Capital reporter Rob MacKenzie was given the job of running the games through the Sharp and he claims a 75 percent success rate on the results, if not the actual scorelines. \"We took an average over ten games and had a fairly high level of success. Our most memorable success was the Brazil-Russia game when, not only did we get the result right, but we also predicted the late goal.\" How did you fare in our World Cup Competition? To predict a MONMH 1,2,3 of Italy, West Germany and Poland you needed clairvoyance rather than a football brain. But the World Cup Manager game we featured in our June issue did have some measure of success in predicting the results individually as listeners to London's Capital Radio may already have heard. A few brief alterations were made to the game, which runs on a Sharp MZ-80K, to enable it to play any one-off game. Then it was sent along to Capital Radio's Euston offices to have the squads and tactics of each team keyed in and the games played out to give a prediction of the result, the mornings be fore the games were played BUGS BEATEN! A BBC Microcomputer has been won by Kevin Williams of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands in our Beat the Bugs Competition published in our June issue. Readers were asked to write a program to solve the puzzle which was given away free wit the magazine in the shortest time possible. Kevin managed to beat all other entrants with a program written on his Acorn Atom which beat the Bugs in the incredible time of less than one second on? Wild Strawberries is the name given to a version of Alien Panic, Kamikaze send the invaders into shutes but can you keep them bottled up?

Also could you put that into monetary terms after say 1,000 cassettes had been sold. Richard Hessler, Bonnyrigg, Edinburgh. Editor's reply: Royalty rates vary, depending on the software house you deal with, but a reasonable average seems to be 15 percent. If 1,000 cassettes are sold at .00 plus VAT, my calculator works this out at . But a sale of 1,000 is still very rare for any cassette. gotos, and it worked. Another problem I encountered turned out to be a bug in my VIC, where VAL(TI$) was used in lines 50 and 60. An '@' symbol flickered in the top left hand corner of the screen (when the screen colour was black), but this was cured by changing VAL(TI$) to TI and multiplying the associated variables by 60 Giffies). To make the game more realistic, I have used the user defined graphic capabilities of the VIC, with good results, and all that is left now is to program some sounds into it. May I just say how much I look forward to your magazine each month, and hope that the above tips might help other VIC users.

VARIABLE PUCKMAN MORE GAMES ON THE WAY Dear Sir, After playing the excellent Minotaur program on my VIC-20, I decided to have a go at converting the Pet program called Puckman to run on my VIC. A change was made to a few variables, the layout of the maze, and I left out the lengthy instructions so that it would fit inside 3.5K. The program ran, but soon crashed after a few loops of the game, with an \"Out of memory error\" message. On inspection of the original listing lines 250 and 350 use \"go to's\" to exit from a \"gosub\" routine and a \"goto\" is used to re-run the program, to keep the top score intact.

"504 E brod HEA HUSK HINGAMET Music Composer Scram 30 MINT KILOCTEN Graph-it Intro to BASIC1 3.7 million reasons why the Atari Home Computer is something to see. The display screen used with our computers is composed of 192 horizontal lines, each containing 320 dots. Delivering colour and luminosity instructions to each dot for a second requires 3.7 million cycles...a lot of work for the normal 6502 processor. That's why the Atari computer has equipped its 6502 with its own electronic assistant. It's called ANTIC, and it handles all the display work, leaving the 6502 free to handle the rest. What this means to you is uncompromisingly spectacular display capabilities without loss of computer power needed to carry out the demands of your program. That's a quality you just don't find in ordinary home computers. And it's one of the reasons some computer experts say that Atari computers are so far ahead of their time. There's more...which is what you'd expect from Atari Language. The Atari Home Computer uses several programming languages to give the user maximum control of its extraordinary capabilities. PILOT, Microsoft BASIC and Atari BASIC are understood and spoken by the Atari computer. You'll also find our Assembler Editor cartridge indispensable for machine language programming Sound. An Ataricomputer has foursound generators, or voices, activated by a separate microchip. This leaves the principal microprocessor chips free to perform other tasks. And you can take full advantage of this capability which is designed for easy programming, Change. Atari Home Computers have been designed to make change and expansion easy. The Atari computer has a modular operating system that can be easily replacedas new technology develops. If you need it, memory expansion requires no more than inserting additional RAM modules. And the Atari ROM cartridge system also makes it easy to change languages. In short, your Atari computer won't become obsolete by future developments...because it already incorporates the future.

"in one ply by reversing moves in this way is known as \"backing up\". A complication occurs in trying to back up a further stage to positions which are lost for Black in 2 ply. Retracting a Black move from figure three gives two possibilities, the King may have previously been on QR1 (figure four) or on QB1 (figure five). The former is a loss in 2 ply but the latter is not (Black to move does not need to commit suicide by moving to QN1, he can escape for a while by playing to Q1 or Q2). To distinguish between these two cases, a counter is set up initially for every Black to move position of the number of legal Black moves. Whenever a position is generated by reversing a Black move, its counter is reduced by one. Thus, for figure four, the count is initially one; subtracting one gives zero indicating that the position say does not give a win at depth three (since that position is already included in the set of depth one wins), but reversing a King move from QR5 does (figure six). The method continues in this way treating White to move and Black to move cases separately. When retracting a Black move, simply reduce the \"legal moves not yet shown to lose\" counter of each resulting position by one and include a position as lost only when the counter becomes zero. When eventually a level is reached from which no new positions are discovered to be won by backing-up, the process terminates and any remaining legal positions are not won for White (e.g. because the Rook is en prise to the Black King). As an indication of what is involved, a four piece endgame has 16 million possible positions with each side to move and adding each The endgame is a notoriously difficult task for the chess programmer. \"Brute force\" chess programs relying mainly on analysis, usually play endgames very badly. However there is a trick which enables some endgames — those with a small number of pieces — to be analysed out completely. This method, which was pioneered by Michael Clarke, a researcher at London University, is based on working backwards progressively from \"terminal\" positions where the weaker side is checkmated. The analytic power which can make the best programs extremely dangerous opponents in the middle game is hopelessly weak for endgame play. As an example, figure one shows an apparently innocuous position in the King and Pawn against King endgame. White's only winning move is K-QB2. Whatever Black replies White can now eventually promote his Pawn and thus win, but to demonstrate this involves an analysis of no fewer than 27 ply ahead (14 White moves and 13 Black)! The strong player does not even attempt such analysis. He simply recognises figure one as an example of a class of positions in which White needs to play his King to the far side of the Pawn and selects the right move immediately. I will illustrate Michael Clarke's method using the endgame King and Rook against King, assuming that White is the side with the Rook. Figure two is a terminal position referred to as a win for White at depth zero. It is obviously possible to write a list of all such positions -or generate it by computer. Now, for each such position in turn, retract all possible legal last moves for White. In figure two, White has seven legal \"reverse moves\", i.e. he may just have moved his Rook from Ri, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 or R7. All these positions are forced wins for White in one ply (all White to move of course), of which one is shown in figure three. Finding wins abcdefgh abcdefgh Fig 5 is lost in this case at two ply. However, for figure five, the count is initially three; subtracting one gives two -indicating that there are two legal \"antecedents\" (with King on Q1 and Q2) not yet shown to be losses. Figure four is included in the collection of losses at depth two ply, and the algorithm proceeds by now reversing all legal White moves to reach that position. Reversing a Rook move from R2 additional piece multiplies this by 64. This number can be reduced by taking advantage of symmetry, but even so it is not likely that endgames with more than five pieces will ever be solved in this way. However, the potential \"targets\" include a number of interesting endgames, particularly the classic endgame of King, Rook and Pawn against King and Rook. BY MAY. BRAMER "

Then program in this listing. It explores one of the mysteries of the universe antimatter. DAVID LANGFORD braves the dangers and brings you a rundown on how to make space travel with your micro more realistic. You are invited on a deadly mission to the heart of the asteroid belt... SF buffs will be well aware of the perils of antimatter, that stuff whose atoms consist of positively charged anti-electrons circling nuclei of negatively charged anti-protons. In tiny quantities it's an interesting scientific curiosity; a large piece would be sudden death. When matter meets antimatter they annihilate one another, converting mass to energy with near 100 percent efficiency — as compared to 0.5 percent maximum efficiency in a hydrogen bomb. One kilogram of matter plus one kilogram of antimatter would annihilate with the explosive force of nearly 43 million tons of TNT. Naturally such lethal stuff would have uses in weaponry and power plants, and if it could be found floating free in space, people would soon be taking risks to \"mine\" it. The classic approach is found in Jack Williamson's SF novel Seetee Ship. With little electromagnetic coils you entice meteoroids of anti-iron towards you and tow them through space making sure they never get too close! "


"Illustration: Terry Rogers Antimatter: In tiny quantities it's interesting larger amounts can cause a few problems This could be the basis of many nerve-racking computer games. My sample program printed here gives a fairly simple version. As usual in this column, it's not offered as a perfect and polished game but as something to set you thinking about your version. So although the listing is for a TRS80, the idea is transplantable to any machine. In this version, meteoroids appear and move with random speed across the screen. At the bottom, a solid white line represents the hull of your spacecraft if the antimatter meteoroid should even touch it, multimegaton disaster follows. In the hull is a cargo hatchwhose width depends on the \"difficulty level\" chosen and beneath are numbers corresponding to the positions of your electromagnets. Pressing one of the keys 1 to 9 causes the appropriate magnetic coil to be turned on-only one can be used at a time and pressing the zero key turns it off. If the meteoroid can be guided into the hatch, then automatic magnetic fields will store it safely. What's interesting is that these electromagnets don't operate, as you might think, by the inverse-square law meaning that the pull drops by a factor of four when the meteoroid is twice as far away. It's more like inverse-fourth-power, with the magnetic pull dropping by a factor of about 16 when the distance is doubled. This makes it deadly dangerous to try last-minute course corrections if the meteoroid is near the relevant electromagnet it'll dive-bomb it at once thanks to the huge pull at close range. My approximation of the magnetostatic equation is spread through lines 4040-4060; all the boring factors like current and number of windings in the electromagnetare bundled together as K in line 120. Make K bigger and your magnets are proportionally more powerful. If you prefer your meteoroids to be sitting ducks, omit line 2180; if you fancy a little more aggro from them, try changing line 2200 to VY=RND(0) pull into horizontal and vertical components so as to make a crude calculation of the changes in the meteoroid's horizontal and vertical velocity; lines 4130-4140 are equally crude about its changing position in space. You know all you need to know about this meteoroid when you know four variables: horizontal and vertical position, horizontal and vertical velocity. Another couple of variables and you could track it in three dimensions ... but the display would be a problem! Once again, you are challenged to improve on this rough program. Could it be made faster and more difficult? How about inserting a scoring system — perhaps like baseball, allowing you to ignore a certain number of meteoroids which seem too high or fast to be captured safely? What if the electromagnets could be switched to repel? Impossible: but this is science fiction! Or if the program dealt with more than one meteoroid at a time? Give it a try; let your imagination run riot; and let's hope all those multimegaton antimatter explosions won't be injurious to the health. The sample program doesn't contain much else that's abstruse. The machine-code whiteout is straight from the Tandy manual. There's a bit of elementary trigonometry in lines 4070-4090, splitting up the magnetic "

It can outwit the most experienced pack of hounds and baffle the farmer who keeps loosing chickens to this swift and silent hunter. Now you can attempt to trap the elusive animal in this original game for the Sinclair ZX81. You are the master of the hunt, in charge of a ferocious pack of hounds. All you have to do is manoeuvre your hounds into a position to catch the fox around a chess board style display. There's just one problem. The fox is virtually invisible. It only appears briefly at the start of the chase, when it leaps over one of the pursuing hounds or when a hound attempts to move into the same square which the fox is occupying. The program includes an easier version of the game for beginners which allows the player to see the fox whenever it moves. But we know Computer and Video Games readers don't like things too easy do you! Although the entire program is written in Basic the response time is rapid. Slow mode is used apart from the initial setting up of the board, giving a constant and flicker free display. The game is won once the fox is trapped. Out you lose if the fox escapes to the bottom of the screen. As master of the hunt you can choose how many hounds you wish to use in the chase any number from three to eight. This gives a considerable range of difficulty. The program inputs are error trapped, and non-valid inp simply result in the input being requested again. 2 I 3HJ003WHHOJLLOJ: UC CLLJLOZZZO ELLE UL XIXHXXXH # IVOODOOL DOMOF @ Na D EPOM ZH  Dm ZIOD 0000000OOOOHOO A 9009090109000X  +)  ZACE --{ADEN NH45gjpy) COUNCION TUIAAAAAAAAAAWWUomwww00:01GIONO IONIO NON DONDP DUD DIXX 73                   11 IMDU-+ U DO Uporrrozzorrrr HHTITUZZMH TMD ERVE NO LINES FOR ME DISPLAY BOARD B*-*INT (A/2)) 8 PRINT TABB+C+6); \" ; NEXT C NEXT NEXT A PRINT AT 3 2,25; \"FOX AT\"; TAB ; TAB 26; DUSK TB 25 REM PUT B'S INTO NON-PLAY 1 TO 8 FOR B=1 TO 8 +B)/2< INT ((A+B) /2) T (A ,B) =\"B\" BY GORDON STEVENS EL IN LOVER RVE LINES FOR BASIC REEN 154 18,2 m 40. :PZOP OOO 00000000000000000000 EM SET UP HOUND POSITIONS OR A=1 TO 2 OR B=1 TO 8 F NOT H THEN GOTO 490 A$ (B,A) =\"B\" THEN GOTO 47 ET A$(B,A) =\"H\" ET H=H#|| || UB 1250 PRINT TAB 10;\"\"\"FOX AT DUSK ,\"TRAP THE FOX SO IT' CANNO T MOUÉ.

"Illustration: Dorian Cross BOMBER RUNS ON AN ATARI 400 IN 6K WITH JOYSTICKS Beware the bouncing bombs! They'll get you given half a chance. And contact with one of these hopping horrors is decidedly lethal. But you can protect yourself with a blast from your cannon which destroys the bobbing bombs. Your cannon is situated on the right hand side of the Atari screen and the bombs bounce at you across the screen from the left. You control the firing base using a joystick So keep ducking and weaving -and stay alive!

"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING 1000 CLS 1010 PRINT \"THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS...\" 1020 PRINT.. THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD COMMUNICATION Communication and interaction between the program and the user is a particularly important subject. In most cases all the user will see is what appears on the screen, and the program will be judged by how helpful the instructions are and how easy they are to follow. Instructions should always be included in the program, even if you are going to be the only person using it. It is surprisingly easy to forget how to operate a program when you have not seen it for six months. Where the instructions are long and complicated full instructions may have to be provided separately, as text accompanying a listing in a magazine or as a printed sheet or booklet accompanying a program sold on tape. However, even when a complete set of printed instructions is available the program should still include some instructions and helpful prompts. It is useful to include a HELP function in your programs, and this can be done quite easily if the instructions are contained in a subroutine. For example: 1100 PRINT 1110 PRINT \"PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE 1120 GET A$ 1130 IF A$=\"\" THEN GOTO 1120 1140 RETURN The program can begin with the usual: 10 PRINT \"DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS? (Y OR N)\" 20 GET A$ 30 IF A$=\"Y\" THEN GOTO 60 40 IF A$=\"N\" THEN GOTO 70 50 GOTO 20 60 GOSUB 1000: REM PRINT INSTRUCTIONS gram will already know how to play the game. Even in a simple and well-known game you may sometimes want to include full instructions; for example, although you may think that no one needs to be told how to play Noughts and Crosses it would be advisable to include full details if the program is likely to be used by young children. With lesser-known games you will need to provide full details of how to play the game, even if the game is described in easily available standard books. There are many people who will type in a long program if the instructions are complete and the description makes the game look interesting but will not bother if they have to go to the trouble of getting a book before they can play the game. 70... The HELP function can then be implemented by testing for the user typing \"H\" or \"HELP\" whenever an input is being processed. For example: 100 GET A$ 110 IF A$=\"H\" THEN GOSUB 1000 120 IF A$=\"L\" THEN GOSUB 2000 130... This allows the user to see the instructions again at any time. Of course, you must remember that printing the instructions will destroy the display, and you may have to add extra instructions to restore the display afterwards. Another point to remember when the instructions are long and need to be printed in two or more blocks is to allow the user to go back and re-read earlier blocks. If the instructions can be divided into sections each of which applies in only one part of the program it is best to arrange HELP so that it gives only the instructions that refer to the part of the program currently being executed. The amount of detail you need to give in the instructions depends on how well-known the game is and how complicated the instructions are. For example, in a chess program you only need give instructions on how to enter moves into the computer and how to use any extra features like recording a game, as anyone wanting to use a chess proDESIGNING THE SCREEN LAYOUT Screen layout is another feature that should be designed carefully to make things easy for the user. Although the type and amount of information you need to display depends on the program there are some general principles that should be kept in mind. The current state of the game should be displayed prominently and the screen should not be cluttered with subsidiary information that is not of immediate use. The best format is usually to have the main action in the central part of the screen and put any numerical or textual information at the top or bottom. With action games of the space invaders or asteroids type the main problem is producing the moving graphics. The only other information needed is the player's current score and the best Score to date, and perhaps the number of laser bases or spaceships the player has left. In this type of game the scores, etc., are not essential to the player but should be displayed so he can see how he is doing. But there are games like Moon Lander where height, speed, etc. are essential BY TED BALL 62 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING tions for the two types of information. In this case the essential information should be displayed clearly and fairly close together on the screen. The player should not have to keep shifting his attention from one part of the screen to another to find the required information, when he needs to concentrate on what should be done. This makes it possible to leave, for example, the inventory on the screen while the player is typing in a number of commands trying to get something to happen. ADVENTURE AND INFORMATION.. At the other extreme we have the Adventure type game where there is a large amount of textual information and there is not room on the screen for all the current data on the state of the game. In such cases it is necessary to separate the information into a number of blocks and allow each block to be called up to the screen whenever it is wanted. Adventure was originally designed for large mainframe computers where the usual input/output device was a hard copy terminal or a VDU that simulated a hard copy terminal Because of this, the information was displayed as text which scrolled up, and on a VDU the old information was lost whenever new information was printed The earliest Adventure games on home microcomputers followed this practice, but with a memorymapped screen it is possible to do better The information provided in an Adventure program generally falls into one of two types: permanent or semi-permanent information like the description of current surroundings or the inventory of the player's equipment, and transitory information like the result of performing an action. The more recent Adventure-type games designed specifically for microcomputers take advantage of the memory-mapped screen by dividing the display into two secDEALING WITH STRATEGY GAMES In strategy games the amount of information you need to display can vary, according to the game, from a simple graphical picture of the current position and a note of whose turn it is, up to complex graphics, several different scores, and a record of all the moves to date. The main point to watch with this kind of game is that the screen does not get filled with irrelevant or out of date information, and also that the player can easily see the latest move and the effect it has on the state of the game. In most cases you only need to provide simple messages, \"MY TURN\", \"YOUR TURN\", \"I WIN\", etc, but it is often useful to provide a little more. For example, in Noughts and Crosses it is more helpful if the prompt says something like \"YOUR TURN: PLEASE TYPE IN ROW NUMBER, COLUMN NUMBER\". You should also try to make the program's responses as fast as possible, as people will soon get bored if they regularly have to wait while the program is working out its move. If an occasional slow response is unavoidable it is best to indicate this to the player with a message, like \"I'M THINKING. PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT\". This will also tell the player that the machine is still working, and he will not get worried about the computer having crashed when nothing happens for a few seconds or tens of seconds. The best way to improve the appearance and usability of your programs is to look at them, and at other people's programs, critically, and note the good and bad features. If you think about what you like and dislike in the programs you use you will be better prepared to include the former and exclude the latter next time you program. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 63 "

Sorceror. TRS-80 and Video Genie There are many different prub machines WATER, WATER, EVERYWHERE! Filling a bucket with water sounds a simple act but can lead to nasty complications in an Adventure program Water is a substance that can make programming a real headache, since it doesn't obey the simple rules that most objects follow. To take any you must be carrying a suitable container. The second complication is that having filled your container, there is still nearly as much water left as before! How can we cope with that? If water is treated as an object in the object array, then when taken it will disappear from its original location. So a way round this is to use a flag, and to include the presence of water in the location description. Let's refresh our memories about our existing TAKE routine: 1100 IF P(K2) LN THEN 3010 ELSE LET P(K2)=50: LET IN = IN+1 We can interrupt this line by inserting: 1100 IF R3$ = \"WATER\" THEN 1234 ELSE IF P(K2)..... etc. 1234 IF LN 14 THEN LET Q1$ = \"I DON'T SEE ANY HERE\" ELSE IF P(12) 50 THEN LET Q1$ = \"NO CONTAINER\" ELSE IF C(12)=3 THEN LET Q1$ = \"BUCKET'S ALREADY FULL\" ELSE LET Q1$ = \"OK\": LET C(12) = 3 1235 GOTO 100 In the above the bucket is object no. 12 and its flag C(12) will indicate jects and 30 nouns in the game, the noun WATER may return a value of 25 for K2. Thus the original line 1100 will bomb, as will our modified version, if another noun is TAKEN. The solution is to first scan the object array for a recognisable object. If not found, scan the noun string. If a valid noun is found, add to its found position in the string the highest dimension of the object array. The noun string is now effectively an extension of the object array, the resulting value of K2 being unique for object or noun. We can now once again modify line 1100: 1100 IF K2>n THEN 1234 ELSE IF P(K2)... whether it is full or empty -3 if full, else 2. 50, you may remember, is the notional location number we assigned to any object in the player's inventory. Water, of course, will have to be a recognisable noun rather than an object, thereby resulting in a value of K2 which when used as a subscript for an object variable could cause a computer error, since it may be beyond the dimension limits for the object-associated arrays. For example, if there are 20 ob1101 REM n = NO OF OBJECTS IN ARRAY HIGHEST SUBSCRIPT TO AVOID ERROR. 1234 IF K2 = (decode no for water) THEN LET ... etc. Line 1234 could have taken the form ON K2-n GOTO which could cater for a number of situations.

The fallacy of that belief is best illustrated by what occurs in Noughts and Crosses. The sum of all choices for both cause they have the wrong values, consider too much or too little data, don't understand what they are doing or fail to pay attention Others lose because they don't understand, don't pay attention, or allow themselves to be distracted and victimised.

What should interest game afficionados is that it is far more difficult to achieve a conscious draw than a victory. Try playing Noughts and Crosses on a 9 X 9 diagram with a winning requirement of 5-in-a-row. Try for the earliest draw systematically, symmetrically and then assymetrically and you'll really have a challenge on your hands, whether you play with a computer or with a human being. These obvious principles should have been understood long ago. But they were only understood in the orient. Most chess championships end up with a long series of draws and stalemates until the required number of games are won by default. The best games these champions play are said not to count. Prize money is only awarded to the \"winner.\" Playing to win solely for the sake of money corrupts. It fools all those who don't understand or don't want to understand. The first can be excused because they have been victimised by wrong beliefs of long standing. They have been conditioned to believe all the wrong things. The latter are simply unprincipled opportunists, people who want to win at any cost. This should not discourage people who play games for fun or to discover the meanings of games. Achieving a draw with an equally matched game partner is a considerable achievement. Games are amusing, fascinating and important, especially now that we have the capacity to model games with precision on any computer or calculator. We can therefore discover the cause and consequences of every move AND of every player's intentions. We can be sure of who plays for the sake of trying to achieve perfection, cooperation and peace and who merely wants to victimise us.

"THE MAKING OF TRON BY FRED D'IGNAZIO One day, just a few months ago, two men were squeezed inside a cramped trailer on a Walt Disney studio backlot in Burbank, California. They were peering intently at a computer picture screen. At first the screen was blank. Then glowing, darting images appeared: Giant, horseshoe-shaped flying battleships. Telephone receivers that raced across a fishnet of pure light. Squat, sleek tanks that fired deadly energy bolts. The inside of the trailer echoed and rocked with the men's impromptu applause, laughter, and sudden arguments. Then silence. One man scribbled notes on a sheet of paper. The other pushed buttons on a keyboard below the screen. The tanks moved forward, then backward, then forward, all in slow motion. The battleships alias Recognizers rotated and approached until they loomed on the screen. The telephones alias light cycles froze in place on the infinite grid, then inched forward and collided in a burst of blinding light. What were the men doing? It appeared as if they were playing a sophisticated video game. But they were not playing a game. They were making a movie. The two men were Jerry Rees and Bill Kroyer, two Disney animators with impressive credits. Both had worked on a number of animated films for Disney and other producers. Rees recently worked on Pete's Dragon. Kroyer helped to animate The Fox and the Hound. Now the two were working on Tron, the story of a renegade video game designer's heroic battles in a microscopic fantasy world inside a computer. In the olden days at Disney the 1930s through the 1950s animation was tedious and time-consuming. Dozens of animators laboured painting endless sheets of clear plastic cells which were later strung together into a featurelength animated film. It became so expensive, in terms of animators' salaries, that high-quality animated films became rare. The field ceased to evolve. The state-of-the-art films, the classics, were produced nearly half a century ago. Then up popped the computer. In the mid-1970's, cost-conscious producers began training their animators on computer graphics workstations. The animators used the computer as a digital paintbrush. They drew a film frame on a graphics tablet with an electric pen wired to the computer. Their picture instantly 70 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES appeared on the computer's TV screen. At the bottom of the screen stretched an electronic palette a row of twenty or thirty blocks, each a different colour. To colour his picture, the animator had only to touch the palette with his pen, then lightly tap the screen. In a few seconds, an artist could colour an entire scene. Animators let the computer do their colouring. They also let it do entire frames. These frames, known as in-betweeners, were mid-points in an action scene. For example, if the hero leaped onto his horse, the animator only needed to draw the beginning and ending film frame. The computer could interpolate all the frames in between and draw them itself. The animators' early programs were known as paint programs. The artists still drew most of the film frames, but the computer helped them work faster. Then computer scientists discovered a way for the computer to grow scenes on its own, completely from scratch. A scientist with no artistic ability could feed the computer a mixture of numbers and complex mathematical formulas, and out would come completely synthesized pic. tures of craggy mountains, crystal goblets, bowls of fruit, Greek temples, trees, the rings of Saturn, or a pair of unlaced, dirty tennis shoes. The texture, colour, light, shadows, and perspective in the pictures were realistic and convincing. The pictures looked like photographs. Yet the objects they represented did not exist, except as 1 minute pulses of electricity inside a computer. In 1977, Steven Lisberger, a talented young director, called on the executives at Walt Disney Productions at their headquarters on Dopey Drive, in Burbank, California. Lisberger had a fabulous movie to propose, and he wanted Disney to produce it. Like fellow director, Steven Spielberg, Lisberger had grown up on magical Disney films like Snow White, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, Now he wanted to bring a little of that magic back to Disney studios where it hadn't been seen for almost fifteen years. Lisberger had dreamt up a story about Kevin Flynn, a maverick hero who sets out to conquer evil in this world and in a surreal world in the bowels of a supercomputer. Lisberger's script began with Flynn trying to crack into his old company's computer to locate evidence that his arch-enemy, Dillinger, had swindled him out of several video games he had invented. Bu the computer is controlled by MPC, an ultra-intelligent \"Master Control Program\". The MCP is hateful, power-hungry, and utterly without scruples. It catches Flynn at a computer console, zaps him with a laser teleportation device, and sucks him through the TV screen into its electronic domain. Flynn materializes inside the computer as an electronic being. MCP's brutal guards shove Flynn into a jail cell. Like a gladiator in ancient Rome, Flynn is forced into frequent combat with his fellow captives programs who re"


"sisted MCP and remain loyal to their mythical human users. At the last moment, Flynn discovers an ally: the valiant program, Tron, champion of the human users. Flynn, Tron, and another program, Ram, battle the MCP's warriors on light cycles. The cycles flash across the game grid leaving multi-coloured energy \"walls\" in their wake. The walls accumulate forming a maze that the cycles must manoeuvre through and around. The cycles travel at blinding speeds. If a cycle strikes a wall, it explodes and it's rider dies. Lisberger told Disney executives the story of Flynn and Tron's adventures in the bizarre world ruled by MCP. He described Flynn and Tron's battle to overthrow the MCP, and Flynn's frantic attempt to escape from the computer. To the conservative executives, Lisberger's film sounded exciting but risky. They were sceptical. They became even more sceptical when Lisberger proposed that the film be completely animated by computer. Lisberger's idea was ingenious: He wanted to use computers to create the world inside of the computer. Lisberger persuaded the executives to let him do a movie pilot. A few months later, the executives saw the pilot, and their doubts turned to amazement, then to enthusiastic support When the film finally went into production in 1980, computers and video games had caught up to Lisberger's amazing vision. People all over the world were snapping up home computers and popping billions of coins into computer arcade games. Also, by 1980, Lisberger had decided not to rely completely on computer animation. He realised that live actors could bring a lot of energy and excitement to the film. He decided that the best combination was a mixture of live action, special effects and animation. The animation would be done partly by computer and partly by Disney animators. But all of the parts live action, special effects and animation had to be blended together into a single film. The live action in the film was shot in just a few months. The post-production special effects took two years. Of the film's total cost of over $22 million, approximately $6 million went into liveaction enhancement. Another $5 million went into computer-generated imagery. Lisberger wanted the final film to look unique, like something no one had ever seen before. Yet he wanted it to be convincing, believable and real. Live action had to flow invisibly into computer animation, Computer animation had to flow into special effects. Human animators painted scenes and backdrops that looked as if they were generated by a computer. Film-making computers created characters and effects that looked as if they were painted by humans. Scenes with live actors on barren sound stages were touched up by animators and reflilmed with crimson and blue \"backlights\" glowing brightly through the actor's costumes, the props and the surrounding geometric landscape. The result is that the live actors seem to be moving through a computer world created totally by a computer. In fact, out of a total of almost one hundred minutes of film, only 15 minutes are computer generated. According to Richard Taylor, director of Tron special effects:\"Creating scenes by computer is like having at your disposal a flawless airbrush artist who can paint thousands of paintings a day with photographic realism, getting perspective and shading absolutely perfect.\" But the computer can't work all this magic on it's own. It needs help. Disney animators Bill Kroyer and Jerry Rees gave the computer the cues it needed to generage the images for Tron. Rees and Kroyer's trailer in Burbank was connected, over the telephone to a high-speed mainframe computer located on the other side of the country, in Elmsford, New York. The computer was run by a team of animators and engineers of the MAGI company, one of four computer-graphics companies that worked on Tron. Back in Burbank, Rees and Kroyer fed the computer with a steady diet of storyboards and scene blueprints. They described every aspect of every frame they wanted the computer to produce. Rees and Kroyer drew upon all their animation experience at Disney to produce the specifications. Computer operators at MAGI then loaded these specifications into the computer as cold, hard numbers. The computer ran MAGI's \"Synthavision\" programs to convert the numbers into speeding light cycles, sinister Recognisers, canyons, bridges and tanks. It created the images out of stacks of 3-D building blocks. The building blocks, known as geometric primitives included spheres, cones, cubes and ellipsoids. The primitives were added together, subtracted from each other, shrunk, expanded or distorted to make complex looking objects. The objects were set into motion and transmitted, via the phone line, back to Rees and Kroyer's trailer in California, The animators watched the scenes in miniature on their computer TV screen. Elsewhere, other computers were busy cranking out other scenes in the film. At Information International, in Culver City, California, a computer was transforming billions of numbers into the jeweled polygons used to build the beautiful solar sailer that carries Tron and Flynn to the MCP's headquarters. Computers at Robert Abel and Associates in Los Angeles were working on the Tron titles and Flynn's thrilling journey from the real world into the circuit world inside the computer. At Digital Effects in New York City, engineers programmed their computer to create one of Tron's most memorable characters, a computer bit. The bit could metamorphose it's shape. Sometimes it was a hovering, spiked sphere, other times a floating octahedron. It acted briefly as Flynn's sidekick but could only supply two answers: yes or no. In the U.S. the film was first released on July 9. Critics of the movie surfaced immediately, decrying it's shallow, comicbook characters, it's weak plot and it's overuse of special effects. According to one reviewer: \"Walt Disney never forgot the importance of plot and of making the audience care about the characters. Lisberger has a great deal of talent, but Tron would have profited from remembering such basics.\" The critic's observation is apt. Tron frequently gets lost in its own wizardry Perhaps the best way to look at Tron is as the grandaddy of a new generation of movies. Tron is the first, bold step to a new era in which computers and humans together produce films more magical than anything we've ever seen. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 71 "

"CHIPS WITH EVERYTHING I have been looking at two particular chips which would suit a number of systems. These are the 6828/8507, a Priority Interrupt Controller, and the 6840, a Programmable Timer Controller. These two chips have been designed for use with the 6800 system but are also equally at home with the 6500 system. It is, of course, possible to adapt the control signals from other systems to comply with those required for these chips. My purpose for using the 6840 was to time the switching the drive signals to a stepping motor to drive a robot mouse. The robot is required to go around corners and by writing different subroutines into the timer the mouse will perform the turns. I have yet to see whether this is a satisfactory method, but even if it is not I will certainly be able to use it in another project. The 6840 is part of the memory map in the system and is directly addressable via the bus. The information is placed in the internal registers. There are three 16-bit counters, which decrement, and a set of control lines for each of the counters. Continuous square waves are possible by using two of the counters. The square waves may be of variable mark/space ratio, but only of one polarity as the chip, unlike some other peripherals, is powered by a single five-volt rail. As an introduction to the exciting field of specialised kit building am looking at the use of the many peripheral chips available for each of the most popular microprocessors. In later articles, I will be looking at quite a few add-ons which you can easily make up yourself with the minimum of effort. Most of the kits will be usable with any of the systems with little or no modifications. This is a useful chip, the 6840, and can be very helpful when the clock of the microprocessor is not of the right frequency or phase. It is very useful when the system is tied up doing other routines and a timing loop of variable frequency is required, which may be difficult to generate by the microprocessor. The 6828/8507 chip, on the other hand is suitable for the inputs to a system, whereas the 6840 is designed for control applications. One use that comes to mind at this moment is associated with game playing. Consider a game with two players. One player succeeds in knocking out the opponent's gun. This would normally mean an end to the game. In more realistic battle the enemy would usually have more than one piece of armament. Would it not be better if the game could continue with the player using a less powerful gun? With the controller chip the actions of one of the players may be slowed or impeded by the routines stored at various locations accessible by the different interrupts whose locations are stored in its registers. The priorities assigned by this chip are, like the timer, changeable directly by the microprocessor so that the program may vary without the players suspecting it. This can add another dimension to games which may not be all that exciting in the first place, especially when there is a possibility of more than two players taking part. The priority chip can, of course, be used for more serious applications which I will outline in the coming months. Also I will be showing you some of the routines which are commonly applied to them. There are of course many more chips which have uses for the hobbyists. It is well worth looking out for generally available chips and also the dedicated ones which are designed for a specific purpose. These can often be adapted for strange and extraordinary uses. I will also be looking at some of the methods of constructions I used in the first few editions so that those who missed them then will not be at a disadvantage when it comes to kit building. I look forward to some of your enquiries on how to tackle problems which have arisen in trying to create new add-ons and other hardware extras. Illustration: Jon Davis BY KEITH MOTI "

"BUYING THE RIGHT MICRO If graphics is one of your main computing interests, and if you are thinking of buying a micro, then deciding which machine to get can be a rather difficult and complicated matter. The expense involved means that, even if you can persuade someone else to buy it for you, it is important to make the right decision. There are so many microcomputers available now that it is almost essential to know what you want to use yours for, because only if you have definite requirements can you obtain the machine which fulfils them. Many people want to play games, but to have the benefit of the best graphic displays. Others want to program graphics themselves: the intended uses typically include illustrating and enlivening the user's own games programs, presenting information and exploring computer art. I would say that for anyone with a serious interest in graphics, the ideal choice lies between comparatively few machines. Of course, the cost is a factor, but even when spending  or less there is a degree of choice. The first decision is to pick the style of graphics that you are satisfied with. The choice is between pixel graphics, block graphics and highresolution line drawing graphics. Pixel graphics, as provided for example by the Tandy TRS-80, Video Genie and ZX81 are the crudest form of graphics available, although they can be quite effective. However, the resolution that can be obtained is usually rather limited (128 x 58 on the TRS-80), and for this reason lines and curves usually have a visibly \"stepped\" appearance while shapes have to be represented by rectangular approximations. With block graphics, which are possessed by the Pet, VIC and Texas T199/4A, images are composed using character-sized graphics symbols. Quite remarkable images can be designed given sufficient ingenuity. With the Pet and VIC a fixed repertoire of graphics symbols must be used, but the Texas machine allows the user to design his own graphics characters: for a particular game or application a carefully thought out set of userdefined graphics can make the resultant programming very much simpler. Systems using block graphics can give what we might call pseudo-high-resolution graphics because by combining graphics characters perfect lines can be drawn, but only in certain directions, and perfect curves can be drawn, but not in the variety that is available with a genuine high-resolution system. This naturally leads us to consider high-resolution graphics, which has to be the ultimate tool for anyone geunuinely interested in graphics. Most machines with highresolution graphics provide a resolution of at least 256 x 192 and, in their Basics, drawing commands such as MOVE, for moving the you want colour or not needs to be made, but since all well-designed games using colour leave their monochrome competitors way behind, this decision should not take too long. The BBC micro, Atari, Spectrum and VIC are all colour machines, although the number of colours that can be used at their highest resolutions tends to be limited because of the amount of memory that is used. A consideration when producing realistic displays is whether colours can be displayed in various intensities because this allows, for instance, shapes to be modelled in the same way as a painter can model an object in pure colours without using sketching. The Atari provides 16 levels of intensity for each colour and the Spectrum gives 2. For those more interested in playing games the amount of software available, and its quality, is an important factor. There is a good deal available for the Atari, quite a lot for the VIC and, at present, relatively little for the BBC Micro and the Spectrum, pictured below. An article discussing the choice of a micro for graphics probably ought to end with a firm recommendation of some sort, and it does seem to me that the Spectrum is a very interesting prospect The BBC micro needs no endorsement from me. The VIC is a fine, proven machine, although its future seems a little clouded. My choice at this stage would be the Atari. The Atari 400 is good value at its new price. The Atari 800 is a much more professional machine but, in my view rather over priced. drawing position, and DRAW, for drawing a line. The highest resolutions available on various machines include 640 x 256 with BBC Model B, 320 X 192 with the Atari 400, 256 X 172 with the Sinclair Spectrum and 176 x 158 on the VIC when a high-resolution graphics cartridge is added to the basic machine.

"E SOFTWARE SOFTWARE SOFTWARE SOFTWARE SI NOT QUITE SIX OF THE BEST FOR VIC ca VIC 6 REVAMPED REVIEWS We have a new broom sweeping through the columns of our Review pages in response to many reader requests for a marking system on which to judge the games we review. We have come up with three areas which we hope will cover every aspect of games software. Our review team can expect to have their noses kept to the grindstone for the next few months, marking up tapes in accordance with our new points system. Each game will receive ratings in three categories.

THE U.K. GAMES LIBRARY The MZ-80K was launched in this country in 1979 the first Japanese microcomputer to be sold in the U.K. The basic package is an \"all-in-one\" unit, with a screen, tape deck, and computer console built into one unit. So you do not have a spaghetti junction of leads worming their way around the living room. The MZ-80K has just one lead which plugs into a normal mains supply The MZ-80K comes with a comprehensive instruction manual which teaches you Basic through a series of examples and exercises Sharp Basic has to be loaded into the machine from cassette tape which is supplied with machine. Loading Basic requires 16K of memory, leaving only 4K of memory for user programs if you purchase the standard ZUK version. However, most of the MZ-8OK's sold were the 48K version of the machine which have 32K of memory for user programs after Basic has been loaded. The tape deck comes complete with a tape counter which is useful for locating programs, and is reasonably fast capable of 1200 B.P.S. The black and white screen is 10' wide and has 25 lines of 40 characters per line. The MZ-BOK also has a built-in loudspeaker to make use of the music and sound facilities which enhance the wide range of games software that are available. Sharp UK sold out of the MZ-80K in April as consignments of its new re-vamped machine the MZ-80A began to fill its warehouses.

You load it into the machine, leave for about a minute and a half and the machine will then tell you that it is ready for user programs. Sharp Basic is very similar to Microsoft the standard language of most microcomputers. For the more adventurous programmer there is an advanced language called Forth which enables the user to impliment his own ideas, within the structure of the language. A new version of Forth has just been introduced by Kuma Computers at .95 including a 32 page instruction manual. Sharpsoft and Knights TV and Computers also sell a Forth package. There are two educational languages available for the Sharp MZ-80K Cesil 3 and Pilot both of which are available from Sharp dealers.
