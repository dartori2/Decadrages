"CVG ED'S COMMENT THE RATINGS GAME ALikely to be a severed head and shoulders above MK and Doom in the blood and gore department is Harvester page 16. Dragon the multiformat review treatment on pages 90-93, as we review the SNES, Game Boy and Mega Drive versions. o much has been made about violence in computer and video games recently that ELSPA has introduced a classification system in order to satisfy the so-called moral guardians of this world; in fact, the system is up and running in stores around the country as we speak, with Nintendo last month announcing that it too is backing the initiative. So what's all the fuss about? The powers that be are picking on games after picking on \"video nasties\" but there's a whole world of difference between the two. A movie is dramatic, real-life' and very graphic. That's the reason why films are classified. Games, on the other hand, are, in relation, laden with cartoon-like graphics (when put up against films), and they're totally unrealistic (since when did you last saunter down the High Street, only to see someone chop anybody in two using a hat?). So why on earth are they subjected to very similar ratings to movies? Yes, with the advent of full-motion video there has to be some sort of system in place so that very young kids cannot get hold of some of the iffier stuff that's bound to come along. But for God's sake, most commercially available video games are no more violent than they were seven years ago! Enjoy the rest of the mag, and happy gaming.

It's not clear what the first game is likely to be as yet, but it now PlayStationTM ommodore UK's parent company, Commodore Interntational Limited, has gone into voluntary liquidation following losses of $336million in 1993. Rumours are rife as to future investors; currently, Sony and Samsung are names being touted. It's unlikely that existing Amiga owners should have anything to worry about as software houses are unlikely to turn their backs on an installed base of 6,000,000 users. As Virgin's Marketing Manager Simon Jeffery says: \"Commodore's problems are obviously tragic, but Virgin sees the the Amiga market to be alive for a good while yet. The Amiga user base is too large to ignore and Virgin will support it fully despite Commodore's problems.\" A The dawn of a new era in videogaming?

"GET YOUR JAGUARS NOW, FOLKS NEWS CVG THE CAT SET FREE AT LAST PREEAT EAST NEWS IN BRIEF TETRIS ON THE BRAIN The Tetris game is currently being used at the University of California to test how the brain responds to complex activities. Scientists have already discovered that good Tetris players have a very low glucose metabolic rate. Does this mean that people who drink Lucozade are crap at Tetris? tari's Jaguar has finally arrived officially, but you'll have to move fast as there's only 1700 in the country, The first batch is on sale at Rumbelows Games Arena for , although it's expected that once they hit the High Streets in earnest the price could rise to something closer to  considerably more than the  price point Atari origimally had in mind. Meanwhile sales in the US are reported to be healthy, with sales in the region of 50,000 100,000. Judging by the mammoth effort and missed launch dates when it came to getting the actuall console out on the shelves here, it looks as though the CD drive could be a long way off indeed. And we're still waiting for wow! games such as AVP. JAGUAR PC BOARD Sigma Designs, the people behind the ReelMagic board for PC, are going to be producing a similar board which will allow PC owners to play Jaguar CD games. This should be released around the same time as the CD-ROM drive for the Jag towards the end of the year. Expect it to cost more than the Jaguar itself! JAGUAR SPLASH ot being the kind of company to miss an opportunity, Ocean is forcing its way into the burgeoning Jaguar market with two new signings. The Manchester-based firm has teamed up with the now independent Bullfrog to release its Amiga and PC smash Syndicate on Jag, along with Theme Park later in the year. This is exactly the kind of software support the Jaguar needs if it's to mount a serious bid to become the number one console in the country. MADNESS FROM THE EAST As scientists continually strive to find an alternative to the silicon chip (which apparently can't be improved any more) a Japanese scientist is claiming success in his experiments with 'humanoid chips'. He's successfully 'grown' brain tissue into a circuit structure which responds to electrical impulses. Unfortunately, his project has been put on hold following the death of some boards. VIRTUA RACING HOT LINE Import copies of Virtua Racing are triggering cordless phones to ring if played near one either that or the Lawnmower Man is back in town!

GAMETEK FOR MOVIES GREMLIN ON STRIKE Gremlin is working on the SNES conversion of EA's top Mega Drive game Jungle Strike. Rather than doing a straight port, the game is being redone from scratch to take advantage of the SNES' extra abilities. The game is currently in line for an October release. ith the PC, CD32 and CD-i now capable of playing CD movies, Gamtek has moved in to the market with a new division dedicated to releasing films on compact disc. Gametek has already signed 30 films including George Romero's zombie masterpiece Night Of The Living Dead and the SF classic Metropolis. DOOM ON MEGA32 Sega will be converting the smash PC game Doom on to its new Mega 32. Expect to see a much improved game. The most notable difference will, be that the sprites don't get blocky when up close, and it should be faster too. As Phillips seems to be dragging its heels in a major way with the release of movies in Video CD format, the news that Gametek has signed up 30 films will be of relief to owners of the respective systems. 'TOO YOUNG TO PLAY SAYS NINTENDO Nintendo, not content with banning gore from its games, has now decided to adopt the industry's self-regulating classification system on all new games from September onwards.

The game that's been a hit in arcades and kebab shops around the world is almost ready to be unleashed, and it looks absolutely brilliant! Converted by original coin-op firm Capcom, Super Street Fighter Il is certainly going to be a big 'un, in cartridge size if nothing else. The SNES game comes on a whopping 32 Meg cart, and if you think that's big, then you'd be right. But that's nothing compared to the size of the Mega Drive version which is an enormous 40 MEGABITS! That's nearly twice the capacity of Street Fighter Il on the Sega system, so it's a fair bet that everything's in there, special moves and all. The big question on everyone's lips, though, is price. With cartridges this size, Super Street Fighter II is not going to be cheap SNES MEGA DRIVE CAP Ben Super Street Fighter II will doubtless be a top coin-op convert on both machines.

Those taking advantage of the Windows 4 (codenamed Chicago) 32-bit toolkit will effectively produce games which should run twice as fast, require far less storage space, and be quicker to develop, much akin to the current new breed of super consoles. In fact, ID Software has already been showing off the system with a 32-bit version of Doom, the basic conversion of which allegedly took just a couple of days work. Both Virgin and Ocean are also working on top secret 32-bit titles, so expect others to follow. Coincidentally, Microsoft is also working closely with Sega in the development of the Saturn's operating system as part of its aim to penetrate the massive games market. Windows 4 should be available around the end of the year and a price is yet to be confirmed. Contact MicroSoft on 081-242 4100. The Colour Game Boy is well into production, with companies now developing for the machine. One of the first titles to appear will be a colourised version of Nintendo's forthcoming Donkey Kong '94, a souped-up version of the old favourite. Nintendo is remaining tight-lipped about the release date of the system there's a possibility it'll be put on the backburner to allow the firm to concentrate on its soon-toappear VR system. earts Leisure, a major distributor of coin-ops, is looking to cash-in on the current demand for Super Gun adaptors with one of its own design. Heart's Super Gun (which allows coin-op games to run on your home television) is built to a standard rather than a price and offers a reinforced JAMMA connector and an audio switch for full stereo compatibility with all PCBs. The package also includes an original arcade joystick (the best!) with the full six buttons. There is also an option for having credit and start buttons built on to the joystick, which is a nice touch. Hearts is asking a very reasonable .99 for the entire kit. Games cost from  for the likes of Double Dragon, and up to  for Street Fighter Turbo and beyond. Call them on 081-889 0811.

IMPORT GAMES PRICE RISE CLAW YOUR 'True' games fans among you who get games first on import will no doubt have been annoyed with the prices charged lately on Japanese titles. Ultraman is a good example (reviewed on page 86) which is going for around , and that's out of order, frankly. The problem is that the pound isn't doing well against the Japanese Yen. Our advice would be to go for American imports which are now appearing very soon after Jap release dates you can read the manuals too! Movies on demand could soon be a reality thanks to a new set-top system from Microsoft. Provisionally called Tiger, the system will let you download videos as and when you want. It should be compatible with all systems which use Full Motion Video. Telecom is already running trials in certain towns, while Philips is reported to be working on its equivalent.

A One of the rooms in The Lodge is called the Bowels of Hell.

What this plot translates into is a mixture of role-playing and arcade action featuring some of the most impressive and gruesome graphics we've seen on any system. Take on a selection of creatures including the town's residents with a variety of weapons from knives to axes to shotguns as you battle to recover your memory and find your gal if she's still alive. Serious attempt at interactive movie-making? Or pure sensationalism? You'll find out when we review Harvester in a couple of issues time.

"CVG FEATURE KILLER GAMES ULTRA Some games make you think, others educate you, some have you helping little furry animals escape from nasty monsters. What are we? Wimps? Mark Patterson takes a look at games that put you in control preferably with a rather large gun... he impending arrival of Harvester, one of the most violent games to appear this year, is set to stir the violence issue up again. Person-ally we've had our fill of the violence debate, and now you've been told that if Doom: more blood than you could shake a death move at. But because there's no media hype, there haven't been calls of 'moral panic'. you're under 17 you can't buy certain games. That's done and dusted. Here at CVG we've nothing against a bit of blood 'n' guts in our games. There's nothing we like more than hacking each other to bits in a net-play version of Doom. Judging by the success of Mortal Kombat last year, and the popularity of Mortal II in the arcades you're not adverse to seeing a few skulls cracked either. The biggest fear is that we start hearing people calling for games to be banned. The violence issue flares up once in a while, but never attracts too much attention. The first time anyone really complained about violent games was when Domark released Friday 13th for the Spectrum (see Back to the Past page 122). Anyone who complained obviously hadn't seen the game, as it was as violent as Mary Poppins. It was more of a gut reaction to the title. HEAD-TO-HEAD: NIGHT TRAP VS DOOM Night Trap was one of the games which triggered the resurgence of the violence debate, and lead Sega to give the game a 15 certificate. We don't think it warranted it, and are certain that the sales-boosting media interest it received as a result was purely a by-product of an innocent piece of self-legislation. Was Sega right? Nobody raised so much as an eyebrow when the exceedingly violent Doom was released. You decide. Doom Fire breathing satans CENSORSHIP Apart from sporadic attempts and self-censorship, such as CRL imposing a 15-certificate on its poor Dracula release in 1989, which was more a failed publicity stunt than anything else, the violence issue has hardly been one of the raging topics, especially when compared to concern over software prices. It was only when the likes of Night Trap and Mortal Kombat hit the shelves that the media, and eventually MPs took an interest. They cited You're armed with guns I Night Trap Men in black plastic macs Unfunny traps that are like something out of Scooby Doo No blood Crap actresses in nightshirts.

The fact is the people making the most noise aren't the people who play the ames, and they tend to be very selective with the topics they bring up, such as the fatality moves in Mortal Kombat, which make up a very Small part of the game and, on the whole, can't be done by most people. However, the call was enough for ELSPA (the industry's watchdog) to bring in a voluntary certification system. In many ways this is a token effort since it doesn't apply to games already released, and with it being a voluntary system companies don't have to adhere to it. Ibelieve that, currently, nearly all games are acceptable and don't need certificating. In some cases a certificate will be required, especially as more and more WHAT NEXT FOR GAMES? t's conceivable that, with many CD-based mes using filmed footage, eventually the Brush Board Of Film Classification will be called in to 'inspect' certain releases.

Here are a few of our faves... PLOT: BRAIN WORK HIGHLIGHTS Doom JPCID It's you, several large guns and all the demons hell can offer in a battle to the death preferably theirs. Minimal. Deciding whether to use your minigun or 'hard-geezer' laser against the Cacodemons is as mentally taxing as it gets. Going crazy with a chainsaw while under the influence of the invisibility power-up, then watching the survivors fire wildly in a blind panic. TECHNOCOP Take over the world's financial corporations by wiping out their execs with your army of trained killer cyborgs. A certain amount of strategy is needed to make best use of your limited supply of ammo as you can't resort to fisticuffs when you run out. Exterminating crowds of civilians with your minigun/flame-thrower/rocket launcher. Politically incorrect, but very jolly. Syndicate C/BullInferno Technocop /Amiga/P Amiga /Psygnosis /Gremlin frog/EA Persian Gulf | /Amiga Technocop gives you the two essential ingredients for dealing with criminal scum: a very large pistol and a very fast car. None at all. Just remember, you're not allowed to shoot the gang bosses, you have to try and catch them with a net instead. The way the low-life scum explode when shot is completely gratuitous, but they broke the law, so they deserve it. DANGER Middle-eastern terrorists have captured a British oil rig in an attempt to deny us our supply of superior Brent Crude. Separate the terrorists from the hostages, then shoot the former. Not taxing. The terrorists shouting in Arabic as they charge towards you only to be cut down by your trusty Englishmade 12-gauge. WOLFENSTEIN Spraying the portraits of Adolf Hitler with gunfire. Wolfen stein PC/ID Stop the Nazi rampage by travelling to Wolfenstein castle and wiping out their high command single handed. Plenty of places to go and people to meet and kill. You'll only be bogged down if you get lost in the huge 3D levels. Prove just how hard you are by taking on the world's top fighters then doing them over. A certain amount of brainto-hand coordination is needed to produce the excellent, but tricky special moves. The spectacular death moves on the uncensored versions. HEALTH ROBOCOP VS TERMINATOR The hardest robots ever to grace the big screen go toe-to-toe, but it's the humans who get squished by all. Nada.

Enter you, in your brandnew Phoenix Thunderhawk Attack Chopper, to battle through over oneand-a-half times as many levels as seen in the previous game.

Some are played by massive, wellarmed slavering beasties, such as the latest violent sports sim to hit the home, Brutal Sports Football and after appearing on floppy, it's set to show its face on the Atari Jaguar. The game is based on American Football, but the players don't use any cop-out wimpish padding; they believe in the old adage that the best defence is a good oftence. That, coupled with the fact there are no rules, means this is one violent sport. This is a first in several ways, it's the first third party Jaguar release, the first Jag sports game (our sources tell us Kick Off 3 on Jaguar won't be out before it) and it'll be the first Jaguar game to enjoy a simultaneous world-wide release.

For someone looking to upgrade to a more powerful system, choosing a machine which enjoys a variety of genres is difficult enough; but for first-time buyers, making that important purchase can be a nightmare. In the early days of the videogames business, it was an easy decision. With the Spectrum and C64 being the dominant formats of the early Eighties, it was more a case of what hardware capabilities you wanted for the money: the C64 was more powerful, but for  more it was a case of 'do I want better colour and sound, or an inexpensive way into gaming?' Plus, in those days, there were fewer genres to choose from, due to the limitations of systems at the time. sims and the kind of point'n'-click adventure games made famous by LucasArts. Cut to present day, and there's a wider variety of machines and games than ever, with systems seeming to have been built specifically to run certain types of game. So why this state of affairs? CVG asked Tom Watson, managing director of Renegade why adventure games and flight sims seem to be the staple diet of the Amiga and PC when there are so many other genres to explore. Says Watson: \"Currently, a lot of product is developed on a 'cross-platform' MORE OR LESS? As the market grew, so did the range of systems, offering more power and a new range of games, such as advanced flight-combat Populous converted well to Sega systems, exploding the myth that only arcade games work on consoles. 42 "


"CAN'T PLAY, WON'T PLAY FEATURE CVG Football games can cross the technological boundaries with the greatest ease, as Sensible Soccer has proved. dictated by market forces; as Jon Norledge states, \"We put a few console-type games on to the PC last year, but only Mortal Kombat sold well. This year we will release Cool Spot and Lion King but we expect most of the PC sales to be from more typical PC games.\" Tom Watson, on the other hand, is more optimistic, especially with CD: \"There are a number of points here. environment where certain styles of product are more appropriate than others.

All of these were big hits on Amiga and contain great gameplay.' Not only that, but all those titles hold up gameplay-wise today. But, as Norledge concedes, \"They are also all at the wrong end of our sales charts, below Aladdin, Cool Spot, Terminator etc.\" So there are diverse titles out there, though, excluding the small amount of companies that attempt to branch out, generally firms are sticking to the Sonics and Streetfighters for console, and flight sims and graphic adventures for the floppy systems. Is it fair to the punter that only certain types of game are available for certain machines? The answer, certainly from Virgin, seems to be played host to one of the best flight sims ever in MicroProse's Gunship. And it's still happening, with the likes of Virgin Interactive Entertainment and Electronic Arts looking to be at the forefront with Mega Drive conversions of such diverse games as Corporation, Populous 2, Theme Park. But, as Virgin's product manager, Jon Norledge, speculates, the gamesbuying public is not totally switched on to certain types of game on their machine. \"I believe Virgin has provided the most varied range of game genres for the console gamesplayer.

Dinosaurs ruled the Earth 65 million years ago but do they rule the 3DO software scene in 1994? he best film ever made, might be some people's opinion of Steven Spielberg's dinosaur spectacular, Jurassic Park. The real hook of Park is, of course, the chance to see what might as well be real dinosaurs walking the Earth again after 65 million years of extinction, thanks to the discovery by John Hammond's InGen Corporation of a technique allowing dinosaur DNA to be retrieved from prehistoric insects encased in amber. That's the plot of the film, and the 3D0 game runs pretty close. Computer technician Denis Nedry has switched off the power to the park in order to escape with a batch of dinosaur embryos which he plans to sell to a rival corporation. Unfortunately, the switching off of the mains results in total system failure, allowing the dinosaurs of Isla Nublar to escape their captivity and roam free. You play the role of a systems supervisor who, using the park's main computer system, must guide the park's guests to the safety of the heliport. Once that's out of the way a distress signal has to be sent to the mainland warning them about the dinos. Sounds tricky, and it was in the movie. What about the CD game, though?

"MORE VERSIONS THAN THERE WERE DINOS! REVIEW CVG SPIT DOO 0.0 * JURASSIC PARK Not only does Jurassic Park score CVG brownie points by incorporating the absolutely brilliant John Williams title track from the movie, it also has a good-looking digitised FMV sequence lifted straight from the movie. Get spat at by the Dilophosaurs too many times and you'll go blind, as indicated by the darkening of the screen, and then they'll jump you. A Play a selection of subgames to bump up your security status. Unfortunately, they're all souped-up versions of very basic games like Space Invaders. VERDICT 1. This will be very familiar to those who have seen the film... 2. Which, considering the amount of cash it took, is all of you. OTHER VERSIONS While Ocean's Nintendo versions were worth a look, Sega made a hash of the Mega Drive version, which ended up a basic platform game with scruffy sprites. JURASSIC PARK 3. Taken from about a quarter of the way into the film... 3DO While there are some interesting sub-levels to tackle and the basic gist of Jurassic Park is sound, the whole thing's badly implemented. It doesn't feel like you're playing a game, more a compilation of titles which don't hang together well. The best part has to be the Doom/Alien v Predator race against the Velociraptors, but even that gets dull because there's so little to do. A great idea, it just hasn't come off. Stick to the movie you see more dinosaurs. PAUL RAND MEGA DRIVE ISSUE 142  65% SNES ISSUE 144  87% NES ISSUE 144.82% GAME BOY ISSUE 144.89% AMIGA ISSUE 144 89% 4.

It's all quite jerky when it's running to be honest... 6. And there's no dinos to be seen either. Boo. The 3D0 version of Jurassic is an interesting enough departure from earlier versions of the dino epic, and the intro is reminscent of the film; I say 'reminiscent' because you don't actually get to see any of the beasts in all their FMV glory. The amalgamation of games help sustain your interest, but their whole does not a full game make. The shooting and driving elements are tool ordinary and the Doom-like walkabout section is the only noteworthy and atmospheric moment.

You could create a new plague which wipes out the population. You could destroy a block of buildings in a huge explosion. Or you could, as has happened to one Lester Chaykin, rip a big hole in the fabric of space/time and find yourself trapped on a hostile alien planet. Another World should be familiar to games, players after all, it has appeared on almost every system imaginable. The game was originally written by Delphine, who went on to create the brilliant Flashback, and who are busy putting the finishing touches to Another World sequel, Heart Of The Alien. It was also the first platform-style game to use poly gon-based characters instead of sprites, it's gone down a storm on every machine it's been released on. The 3D0 version is pretty much the same as the others bar a few cosmetic differences, so you're guaranteed an enjoyable game.

"STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND REVIEW CVG 3DO INTRO A GO-GO Surprisingly, Interplay has kept the original polygon-based animated intro. Mind you, that's no bad thing in itself since it's excellent, and the addition of a CD soundtrack adds even more to the atmosphere of the world. The big difference in the 300 version compared to the others is the inclusion of hand-painted, digitised backdrops to add an eerie, alien planet-type feel. The alien in the fore ground is Buddy running away from his enemies. 1. Park your Porsche... 2. Sit down to work... The alien death sequences are neat. Shoot them once and the flesh is stripped from their bones. Shoot a second time and the skeleton explodes! 3. See lightning strike your building... 4. Watch the lightning rush up the wires.. SECOND OPINION VERDICT The most challenging game on the 3DO. That's not to say that it's difficult because it isn't just challeng ing. As one of the first games to use rotoscoped animation you can expect some very realistic movements on your character. It's basically identical to all the other versions, but there are backdrop graphics and an atmospheric soundtrack to compliment the action. It's a fine game, but Interplay should have added a bit more to the challenge. I expected more. DENIZ AHMET 5. And get blasted to Another World! THE BEGINNING BIT The start of the game takes a little time to get past, so here's a quick 'n' easy CVG lesson... UCE 3DO Another World is a brilliantly playable game on CD, possibly the best 3DO game available. Full of beautiful graphics and stunning sound, and the gameplay isn't as linear as you'd expect. On the other hand though, the game doesn't last it's challenging enough, but you'll find that it'll be a title quickly completed because there aren't enough screens — you'll probably get a fortnight's play at best.

MEGA DRIVE KIES DE TEE THEZ MEGA DRIVE Like Aladdin, Jungle Book has vibrant graphics with lots of great little touches like the way leaves fall off the trees when you brush against them. I think the SNES graphics are better, although the sound is much stronger on the Mega Drive (I love that rag number!). As a game it plays along a similar line to Aladdin and unlike many others, there's a great sense of freedom in the levels and a large variety of objects to collect. Overall it's great fun but a little too easy. RIK SKEWS VERDICT Ooh, it's just like reading the book. After each level, another chapter of the story is revealed. MEGA DRIVE The holes in the trees act as a lift and each one transports Mowgli to a different part of the level. SNES Like Cool Spot and Aladdin, Jungle Book benefits from a versatile central character. It's polished in every area and the structure of the levels gives you plenty of routes to discover. Like Aladdin however, I would stress that JB is on the easy side and once completed there's no reason to go back again. It would also have been nice to see more use made of collectibles. Still, I prefer this to Aladdin and that was a chart topper, and this could go the same way.

Now, in grimy old 1994 comes the latest instalment and with big cartridges being all the rage. this one weighs in at a hefty 24Meg. We're often told that size isn't important though, so apart from the large variety of graphics and the seemingly endless range of techno tunes what's new this time round? Well, Axel and Blaze are back, but there's no sign of Max and Adam. Instead there's Zan, a self-built research scientist (bet God would be interested in that) and Sammy, a skating whizkid. The gameplay remains much the same though, with plenty of horizontally scrolling beat-'emup action to plough through. A Axel Stone dishes out some anger and bloody noses to the bad guys. VERDICT MEGA DRIVE As with the Sonic games, Sega has managed to find a winning formula and stick to it. Thankfully the new characters are fun to play (especially Zan) so you shouldn't find yourself relying on your old favourites. The graphics and sound are well polished, as is the whole game but I don't think Sega will be able to get away with a fourth game unless it's radically overhauled, it's just too similar to the previous versions. Good stuff but Streets of Rage 2 was better. RIK SKEWS A First seen in the original Streets of Rage game, the ability to grab someone and throw them has been reintroduced. Watch out though, because the enemies can do the same to you! You can also grab each other, which is useful for dishing out more damaging moves. They look smart too! New boy Zan seems to be getting trashed in most of the pictures! A researcher who has cyborg and supernatural powers, he's a great character to play, so you won't find yourself resorting to the old characters after a few games. It's not all mindless beat'em-up action you know. There's sections when the aim is to avoid rather then destroy. 85 GRAPHICS 84 SOUND PLAYABILITY 80 VALUE 81 OVERALL ALTERNATIVE SNES Final Fight 2 Capcom/.99 The Streets of Rage series is clearly influenced by this arcade classic and this fine conversion is also a great tribute to that excellent beat'em-up, and no mistake! ISSUE 140: 83% Streets of Rage 3 is 24 Meg so you'd expect graphical variety and boy you get it. The effect is partly lost though, because most of the characters fight in the same way. The evil dragon guards seem only too happy to let you try out your extensive range of fighting moves. GAME BY SEGA CONTACT SEGA (071-373 3000) FOR MORE INFORMATION 55 "


"CVG REVIEW SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES MEGA-CD SHOOT-'EM-UP UNCONFIRMED OUT NOW TOMCAT NO OTHER VERSTONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED The Mega-CD gets its second video shoot-'em-up, but has Sega cracked the playability factor? Technically this is the most impressive Mega-CD game we've seen yet, it's just a shame that it suffers from the gameplay faults that plague almost all FMV games. ake this as your scenario. You're at home, you've had a hard day, you bung Top Gun in the video, watch it for 10 seconds, rewind, watch it for 15 seconds, rewind again. You'd probably be bored within a minute. Tomcat is pretty much like that, only you can't just hit play and watch the rest of the movie, you need to apply some reflexes first. The interactivity in this case is shooting down other planes and attacking ground targets. This is done in a very similar way to Sewer Shark, the other FMV shoot-'em-up on Mega-CD. Choose where you're supposed to be going, put the cursor over the thing you want to kill and hit fire. That sounds like the staple fodder of any shoot-'em-up, but the enemies are few and far between in this. I Am The Combat Master Technically Tomcat is pretty impressive. The Mega-CD may not have enough colours and a high enough resolution for real FMV, but Tomcat's programmers have done a fine job in making the footage almost full screen. 1) OK, the airforce have given you a shiny plane with plenty of missiles and a Texaco card for unlimited petrol. It's time to suit up and kill something. 2) Watch your backs boys, bandits in-bound at the rear. The enemy is slippery and would test your flying skills to the limit if you actually flew the plane in the game. 3) But unfortunately you don't get to fly it at all. All you do is move the cursor over the plane you want to shoot and press fire. 4) To give you a bit more to do, you're occasionally called on to hit the panic button to avoid the enemy missiles and change heading to find other enemy aircraft. The enemy has a seemingly expendable supply of pilots and aircraft; just as well really since the game would be over pretty quickly if it didn't. PLANE SAILING?

"SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES REVIEW CVG When you shell out for this game the one thing you don't pay for is acting talent, all you can really say is they learned their lines. SECOND OPINION For once the FMV sections don't impose on the game play and actually serve some purpose other than to fill a CD. The film footage really generates tension, especially when a missile's been fired at you and you can see your pilot frantically searching the sky for it. There's plenty of decent sound too, and although I'd agree with Mark that it's not worth the money it does deserve about 10% more for its frantic pace and non-stop blasting action, basic though it is. A The action is gripping for the 15 minutes or so, but once you've seen all the different explosions and bits of flight footage it really becomes irritating. VERDICT MEGA-CD I believe that the arrival of games like this has done the Mega-CD more damage than anything else. Anyone with more brain cells than they have fingers knows they don't play well or look good compared to real FMV, or watching a video for that fact. While Tomcat offers a few more choices than the average 'interactive' movie, it's still well off the mark compared to proper playable games. The game's enjoyable enough, but it's most certainly not worth the money. MARES PATTERSON Like most of these games, actors have been brought in to provide the plot between the action. Spot any familiar faces? We didn't either. I mean, you really have to be desperate to appear in the game equivalent of a straight-tovideo release. Because of the linear nature of the game, watching the same film clips over and over again soon becomes boring GRAPHICS 81 SOUND 85 PLAYABILITY 63 VALUE 47 OVERALL The combat effects work really well, apart from one or two cases when the exploding planes are clearly part of the Airfix airforce. If there's one positive thing you can say about this game it's that the presentation is excellent. The plot footage works well with the action, as do the mission briefings and the access time is negligible. ALTERNATIVE PC CD-ROM Rebel Assault LucasArts/.99 Easily the best CD shoot. 'em-up available: the use of video footage is really excellent, the action is varied and it's incredibly playable.

"WHERE'S MY LEGO? REVIEW CVG GAME BOY PUZZLE UNCONFIRMED TOUT NOW ISNES VERSIONS ALSO AVAILABLE im NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED TETRIS 2 The best puzzle game of all time finally gets a sequel. Can anything be added to this famous puzzler though? For Tetris pros you can crank up the level of difficulty right at the start of the game. SPEED LON MÉB I even years on and Tetris 2 is here, so what's new? The gameplay's essentially the same (if it's not broke why fix it?), but this time there's different patterned blocks that have to be matched up before they disappear. A number of patterned flashing blocks at the bottom of the screen also have to be got rid of. It's a good idea to make these your priority before the screen starts filling up. And to make everything that little bit harder, some random blocks have already been deposited on the game screen before you start, while the blocks that fall down are much more irregular than before. Trust me, it's much easier and fun to play than it is to describe! BOD KURIT MUSIC PA BO EFF  The block shapes are much more complex than they were in the original Tetris. This means if you're not careful the screen can fill up very quickly. LES In Tetris 2 get three of the same pattern next to each other and they'll disappear. I VERDICT ET MO1930 GAME BOY Like the Crash Test Dummies, Tetris 2 leaves me going 'Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm'. You see the original Game Boy Tetris is one of my five alltime favourite games so I couldn't see how Nintendo could improve it. To be honest it hasn't really been tampered with, and that's the game's main fault. Essentially, this is just a tougher version of the first game that isn't as much fun to play. Sure, it'll occupy you for ages, but you'll play the original for a lifetime. RIK SKEWS Animations like these crop up from time to time. They're pointless, but make a change from looking at endless blocks I suppose.

Kipper an eye out for it! The world's most famous fish secret agent returns in a fourth game. Is it any cod? hings are starting to change in the Amiga market. Take James Pond for instance.

This time round he's been sent to the moon to sort out old enemy Dr Maybe. Maybe's come up with a plan to grab up all the world's dairy produce in an attempt to get control of the world milk market. If you'd haddock enough with the fish jokes then prepare for plenty of milk related puns with levels like 'Garden of Edam' to contend with. There's 111 levels to bounce through with all the usual power-ups and secret rooms to discover. And for added value Millennium is even giving away a Fish secret agent pack worth  with each game! ICENCEN TO Each level has its own pun-related title which gives some clue as to what lies ahead. VERDICT MUSH-BEAST A1200 Essentially this is the Mega Drive game with enhancements like Pond's punch ability. If you've played a Pond game before you'll know what to expect, there's little innovation here. Still Pond 3 is beautifully presented with great graphics and chirpy ditties. It's good fun, and better value than the Mega Drive game, but the idea has been taken to its limit. If there's to be any more Pond games I'd like to see more imagination used, as was the case in The Aquatic Games. RIK SKEWS Throughout the game you'll come across numerous items to collect and manipulate. Wondering what they are? Don't because a text box will reveal all the first time you come across something new. There's an option to play the whole game as Finnius the Frog. His superior jumping ability can make things a lot easier. The third Pond game looks more like a console product than ever. The fact that it originated on the Mega Drive probably accounts for this. 81 GRAPHICS 82 SOUND PLAYABILITY 83 VALUE 89 A A turbo mode is activated by pressing the spacebar. This gives Pond Sonic-like speeds which help him run up those steep sections.

"CVG REVIEW CREATURE COMFORTS ISNES PLATFORM .99 OUT ON IMPORT SUPER METROID NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED The Japanese have gone totally mad over this, one of the first big 24Mb SNES games and strangely it shows... f the term 'immersive entertainment' had a translation outside of the Virtual Reality domain it would snuggle up nicely with Super Metroid's cinematic style of gameplay. This SNES upgrade of the ancient NES version is the latest in Nintendo's unofficial tribute to its older games, as seen recently with Mega Man X. If you've played Super Turrican and Aliens on the SNES, you'll have a good idea of the maze-like structures which you will be investigating, here. Yet Metroid is much more than a maze game, for it's quite unique in the delivery of gameplay. Lots of games hold surprises but few build up the tension like Super Metroid does. It starts off tame enough one might even say boring but then you perform a set task and everything goes mad: doors close behind you; enemies suddenly infest your escape route and you find yourself in desperate need of power-ups. The quest for these then becomes critical, and as you gather them you think back to earlier regions, and those inaccessible places which your new ability might just help you get to. It's all too complex to describe without you looking at the pictures, since Super Metroid certainly isn't a linear game. It isn't even just a platform game. It's an event. A Different coloured portals require different reactions to open them. That blue one opens with one shot of your basic weapon, but to get through the pink one you'll need to use your rocket power-up. The first bit of the game involves you in a mission to collect the Metroid Lava. You can see the process here as Samus dashes to get the lava jar and then has to make his escape amid crumbling rooms and Mode 7 rotating shafts. Then you go off to another planet. INSANE IN THE Our adventurer can collect a grappling hook to help get across areas like the one shown here. Good timing is essential to avoid falling off. This golden dragon is an important part of the game; each boss you defeat will place a jewel on this statue, and when they're all in place it crumbles away to reveal a new stage.

"CREATURE COMFORTS REVIEW CVG OOO A Enemies attack you from below so what you have to do is jump up and shoot down. You can't fire directly down if you're standing on something though. A There's a lot of going up and down in platform shafts. Most baddies infest the sides of the screens so try to occupy the centre where possible. Sometimes the portal is infested with a monster which needs to be blasted, and you have to use one of your more potent weapons to clear a path. VERDICT You can save up to three positions during play. You use this pod to do it. Needless to say it's worth doing very often. SECOND OPINION SNES There's no way you're going to appreciate Super Metroid by a five minute demo in your local store, as like Zelda this has depth. Strangely enough, it gets you thinking not as a player, but as if you are the main character. The atmosphere is stunning (helped by eerie music and the cleanest vocal samples ever on a SNES) and some nice use of Mode 7 special effects. The best SNES game for ages, and the only reason it hasn't scored higher is that it's rather easy. DENIZ AHMET MEMBRANE Deniz makes a good point when he says don't judge Super Metroid on a five minute demo, since it starts off quietly, with little to do except run around looking for new places to explore. The reason for this though, is to let you collect and learn the many abilities available to you. And believe me you're gonna need them 'COS Super Metroid is a whopper game with strikingly orig. nal graphics, movie style soundtrack and plenty of depth.

In fact, both these versions are almost perfect conversions of the console and Amiga games. The action's still platform based with Spot flipping himself around the levels trying to rescue other members of his clan. The basic gameplay is intact, along with the graphics and level designs.

I'm pleased to see that this conversion has come up trumps. Cool Spot has been a popular game on many formats and I'm not sure why it isn't an original game in any way.

The in-game graphics and parallax backgrounds are incredible and what's more there's no slow. down. Prepare yourself for some of the most amazing graphics ever to grace a 16-bit machine... he great thing about the Amiga is that it attracts gifted programmers, much like the C64 machine did before it. Usually they're the arrogant and highly talented sort who've messed about on the demo circuit. And for some reason they usually come from Scandinavia. So enter stage left from Finland developers Terramarque and their beat-'em-up Elfmania. Elfmania seems to have been floating about in development land for ages, and was previewed in CVG as long ago as issue 144. It certainly looks like plenty of time has been spent on the graphics, they're simply beautiful and yes these really are A500 screenshots you're looking at. With quick loading times, and a novel non-violent theme, you can't fault the presentation. Can the gameplay possibly match up though? ELFMANIA Elfmania's main problem is the lack of contact feeling you get when hitting an opponent. It's hard to tell whether you're inflicting any damage or not. 68 "

It's fast, the controls are responsive, and the ball doesn't blur out of existence when the action speeds up ISSUE 151: 87% A One of the highlights of Elfmania is the artificial intelligence which doesn't let you perform the same move over and over (say a leg sweep) like many other beat-'em-ups. NBA JAM/GAME GEAR/ACCLAIM/PRICE: .99 While losing a little to its 16bit brothers when it comes to controlling the basketball players in the game, Gear NBA still retains most of the playability. The graphics are large and clear making this an all-round good egg. ISSUE 148: 82% VERDICT There's some strange samples in the game. When a character wins they don't say things like 'I am the master'. Instead comments like 'Excellent' and 'Rock me baby' are common. KIRBY'S PINBALL/GAME BOY/NINTENDO/PRICE: .99 Kirby's rapidly taking over from Mario as the premiere Game Boy star, especially after this excellent outing. It's the best pinball game on any handheld and it's a right bargain as well!

"CVG REVIEW PAPUWA DON'T PREACH (SORRY ED.) SNES PLATFORM .99 OUT ON IMPORT PAPUWA NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED From the makers of ActRaiser comes a manga and anime licence which isn't an RPG... 3230 f you see yourself as something of a platform purist, then Papuwa should bring a contented smile to your boat. Why? Well here's a game which adheres firmly to the law of platformers (which, for the uninformed, states that the personality of the central character should be proportionate to the content). So if we tell you that the content here is awash with new ideas, all of which gently whets your appetite and bit by bit accrues your affection, instead of just soaking you at the beginning then you'll soon realise that the central character is tops and that Papuwa is a game with an honest challenge. While the bashing of opponents and collecting items concept is a now static theme, Papuwa manages to give everything a purpose, avoiding those lazy gameplay tactics which have been around ever since it became more fashionable to reach the next exit, as a pose to earning a high-score. Papuwa might not keep you coming back for more but it will do what it's supposed to, and that's entertain. Those conveyer belts make it difficult to avoid the falling dangers, but make it to the blob and you'll get power-ups. You freed this snake earlier so now he returns to help you. Bounce off his head and you'll spring up to a new platform. 5290A WORD IN YOUR EAR In Papuwa you have lots of animal friends who help you out if you ask them. Here's the first batch. 23 NIE 1. This walking fish will let you climb on to its back... 2. ...together you'll dash through stomping crabs and spikes in the water... 3. That frog is your next point of call.. Most of the biggish silly creatures can be used to kill the smaller ones. If you punch these snails they'll roll across the screen crushing others. This is a rather angry bloke whose only friends seem to be animals. Just as well that there's plenty of animals to get on with in Papuwa. Smashing rocks and boulders will usually reveal new power-ups. You need to explore to find them though.

"PAPUWA DON'T PREACH (SORRY ED.) REVIEW CVG 59502012 12029330 an Here's the game map and the stars indicate various stages. The game's bigger than it looks. VERDICT The bosses get bigger as you go along. This one does its best to land on you before chucking out spinning blades. You have to bash its body. SNES A pacy platformer thanks to a central character that blends responsiveness, speed and agility into an appealing sprite. Papuwa, like Mystical Ninja 2, has that subtle blend of the unexpected which is found by accident rather than being unavoidable. There's plenty of imaginative touches in here, but Papuwa is rather easy and there's too much story-telling text breaking up the momentum during play, which would still be annoying even if it wasn't written in Japanese. DENIZ AHMET A Things like to drop in front of you suddenly. Move slowly if possible. 4. Jump on his head and he'll spring you up to the top platforms and the end of the stage. Your special weapon does major damage to anything on screen. As always, save it for the bosses. These nasty pulsating blobs will suck you into their gobs if you get too close. To kill them wait until they deflate and then bash them. SECOND OPINION COMING SOON MEGA DRIVE Spark Sega Japan This new 16 meg game could be a major new platform character. He seems to be Sega's version of Nintendo's Megaman, offering loads of power-up features and hispeed platform action. GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 68 PLAYABILITY 80 VALUE 60 OVERALL This game reminds me of Ranma, but in a platform mould. The little characters are very well animated with stacks of attention to detail, like the little puffs of smoke which blow up as you skid to a stop. The way you interact with different animal characters is a real challenge and the game has a sense of 'fun', which has been somewhat lacking lately in other platform games. Nothing new, but very accomplished. GARY LORD Here you meet one of your foes. He dashes around trying to avoid you while a cloud chases you striking you with lightning. Quite tricky.

"IT'S JUST NOT FOOTBALL REVIEW CVG ISNES SPORTS SIM .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Another SNES attempt at the Americans' rather fey version of rugby. Does it match up to the great John Madden series? or all their country's size, the Americans have never been too hot on joining in the rest of the world's team games. While other nations participate in events such as soccer, rugby and cricket, the boys from over The Pond decide to stay in their own back yard and play baseball, basketball and American Football. If you're a fan of the latter and there must be a few of you (immigrant Americans, maybe?) then you're likely to own a copy of John Madden's Football. SNES-Owning Am' Footy followers, however, now have another option in T-HQ's latest. The firm has received less-than enthusiastic reviews for most of its earlier products, but the last release, Total Carnage, was quite good. Can All-American keep the funny-shaped ball rolling? ALL-AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL VERDICT SNES I didn't think anything could surpass the Madden series in terms of gameplay and graphics, and I guess I'm right. AllAmerican Championship is a solid game, with plenty of plays to satisfy the most ardent gridiron fan, and the forced-perspective view is an original twist in what is slowly becoming a tired genre. However, against JM the game doesn't compete. All-American is enjoyable enough, but why get this when, in Madden, you can have the best? PAUL RAND 20 You've four goes to move the ball forward 10 yards. If, by the fourth, you haven't managed it, punt into the other half of the pitch. The now-familiar feature of sports sims, the action replay, makes an unsurprising appearance in AllAmerican, giving you the usual forward and reverse, fast or slow replay options. The plays screen gives you the options of 51 offensive and 45 defensive setups. WORLD BEATERS John Madden Football '93/94 Electronic Arts The best simulation of the sport available on home systems.

"CVG REVIEW DON'T RUFFLE HIS FEATHERS CD32 PLATFORM | .99 OUT NOW AMIGA VERSON ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED DONK An oriental duck who's a dab hand at being a samurai! Whatever next? o you're not going mad, this really is a game about a samurai duck. Sadly the novel idea has been wasted in another run-of-themill platform game. Once again it's simply a case of running around numerous and rather similar looking levels collecting the jewels and killing the baddies by jumping on their heads. Heck, never seen that one before eh? Oh, and of course all this action is set against the clock. To avoid nasties there's a neat but pretty pointless option where you can push down on the joypad and turn Donk into a tiny duck (duck down, geddit?). A friend can join in the proceedings (if you can find another joypad that is!) for which the screen will split just like in Sonic 3. The gameplay idea in Donk is hardly inspired, it's simply a case of running around platforms and looking for jewels. VERDICT CD32 Donk is a case of been there, seen it before and better. OK so the graphics are fine and the sound and music are excellent, but the gameplay is uninspired. It's irritating in places too, with some lengthy disk accessing and pointless animations, notably when Donk dies and spends ages running down a corridor before you can choose whether to continue or not. It's a shame since there's clearly talent behind this product, I hope they make more use of it next time. RIK SKEWS Pull down on the joystick so you can 'duck' the baddies. Stay in this position for too long though, and there's a distinct possibility that Donk will explode. Once all the jewels have been found find the exit quickly before the place self destructs. Although the level map is useful, the in-game icon is difficult to avoid so you keep finding yourself running into it and selecting it by accident.

"ILLEGAL ALIENS REVIEW CVG GAME BOY PLATFORM .99 OUT NOW SNES VERSION AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED The two biggest movie aliens come to the smallest handheld.. or sheer potential Alien vs Predator is one of the hottest licences around at the moment, But the trick is realising this potential and producing a game which reflects the licence well. Getting it right isn't easy, and obviously a task which was beyond the ability of this game's programmers. They've opted to play it safe by making it a platform game. And why not? It worked with Alien 3. It doesn't work here though. It's as basic a platform game as you'll find anywhere. The action's limited to finding your way to the end of the stage, punching out a few aliens on the way, with the challenge coming from the aliens materialising out of thin air every time you try to go back the way you came. ALIEN VS PREDATOR VERDICT PRUSES ENE A The graphics are nice and large and, well, that's it really. The backgrounds are dull and there's nothing in the way of special effects. A The ultimate addition to the Predator's arsenal is the invisibility shield, although it doesn't last for very long, so you can't reenact the kind of wholesale slaughter from the movies. GAME BOY A decent licence at a decent price, it makes a nice change. Well, it would, except this isn't nice, it's like opening a big bag of sweets and only finding furry mint humbugs inside. Get past the lure of the licence and what's left is a very poor platform game. If a company's going to do a game like this it has got to do it well, or not at all. After playing this, I wish Activision had stuck with the 'not at all' option, despite the game's low price-point. MARK PATTERSON PAUSE HP -700 A Levels two and five require you to explode bombs underneath the Predator, these enable him to get up to otherwise unreachable platforms. I mean, is that crap or what?

"WHAT A SPECTACLE! REVIEW CVE ISNES SHOOT-'EM-UP . 99 OUT NOW MAC VERSION ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SPECTRE Shoot-'em-ups; are they all a load of mindless violence? Apparently not, as GameTek releases the game for the more intelligent blaster... xperienced gamesplayers among you will no doubt remember a crumbly old game called Battlezone, from that games industry stalwart Atari. Said game had you rushing around in a tank blasting various vector objects. Now if you do recall this game, it won't be due to the graphics, but because the gameplay was rather addictive. And we'd say it's very much a similar story for Spectre. Players have to glide over a Mode 7 surface in a strategic game of hide and seek trying to destroy the enemy. The object, in one player mode, is to try and kill all the enemy's craft, or you can simply collect scattered flags in order to progress onwards. The tension soon builds, though, as you start to relinquish energy and ammo, and finding fresh supplies adds another dimension to the gameplay. Of course, as Mac owners will tell you, Spectre really comes into its own when you play against a friend on a network; and for the SNES version there's four different variations on the basic game in 2up mode. And don't let the simplistic graphics put you off, Spectre offers solid gameplay. Amma? E sore: goo The quickest way to complete a level is by collecting the flags which are always in the same place.. VERDICT Dames Erore. 8800 Bonus: Score: Damese: Ammo : SNES Spectre is an old Mac game, and its appeal lies in playing a number of opponents via a network. So the problem here is the two-player limit, but hey, it works well. The new \"jump' function adds to the challenge, and the split-screen doesn't slow down the Mode 7 effect. Spectre is a lesson in proper gameplay and is very addictive, but it's tedious in oneplayer mode, and if you decide to play by collecting flags, you'll not be impressed to see them always in the same places. DENIZ AHMET SPECIRE Split screen mode is the best way to play Spectre. You and a friend can play four different variations of the Spectre game. As seen here, you can use the objects scattered around as a shield from opponent fire. SFS BE008 On later levels the enemy will become far more aggres. sive, often grouping together and even surrounding you, as seen here. Those yellow tanks are also far more durable to your attack There are three defined tanks for your use, or you can define one yourself allocating a set number of units between shield, ammo and speed. GRAPHICS 70 SOUND PLAYABILITY 87 VALUE 65 OVERALL One new ability on this SNES version is you get the opportunity to jump.

"CVG REVIEW BROTHERS IN ARMS ICDPLATFORM .99 OUT NOW HOTEL MARIO INO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED It's another big licensed character for CD-i. So is it worth sending the kids for a frolic at Hotel Mario? ario is an incredibly important licence for CD-i to have, but rather than producing a pseudo Nintendo Mario game, Philips has produced something that's such a departure from the norm that real Mario fans probably aren't going to feel at home. Hotel Mario is somewhat reminiscent of the boardgame, Snakes and Ladders and offers the same simple fun. The aim is to close all the doors of the hotel before time runs out, and while you're doing that all manner of woodland creatures pop out of their rooms just to get in your way. Lifts teleport to random doors on the various platforms, giving you no indication as to where you're going to pop out. As soon as you do a new set of nasties will tend to do the same from their rooms so it's not the easiest game to plan ahead in. If you've got a good sense of timing this game is very straight forward, as you'll see if you read on. You can use doorways to hide in when there's too many dangers on a platform. Use this strategically to learn the speed and movements of the enemy. In later levels you get these tricky ghosts which can float around the screen freely and kill you very easily. VERDICT The caterpillars are annoying since they go around opening doors behind you just as you're running out of time. To kill them you have to bounce on every segment of their body. CD-I Let's clear one thing up this is not your standard Mario game and it seems to be aimed at younger players, if you're not one, you'll find this tedious. Considering this, the formula for gameplay works well and Hotel Mario is surprisingly challenging. With around 85 stages it'll take some beating and new baddies ensure that your strategies have to evolve as the game progresses. However, it's not very rewarding for youngsters, so you might want to pass this over. DENIZ AHMET The doors with arrows on them signify which direction Mario gets moved to when he enters. The brown doors are the ones which have to be closed to complete the stage. SO X3 5 TIME OBR VA The only way for Mario to kill opponents is by jumping on top of them (yawn). You have to be careful though, as you might hit an enemy on the platform above when you do this and kill yourself! GRAPHICS 74 SOUND PLAYABILITY 70 VALUE 69 78 Try to keep away from the edge of the platforms. It is possible to be forced off them to your instant death.

REVIEWS CVG A 500/A1200 O UTNOW ISIMULATION I.95 LOUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED ON CARTRIDGE And this month's cartridge kings of the shelves are... SOCCER STAR WORLD CUP EDITION The creators of a highly successful Play-by-Mail sim unveil their world Cup management game, FIFA INTERNATIONAL SOCCER / SNES / OCEAN PRICE: .99 The SNES finally gets its version of this Mega Drive smash and it's a real net buster. It's not the most realistic footy game on the market at the moment, but it's certainly the best looking and the sound of the crowd, it has to be said, is just amazing. ISSUE 151: 90% he first thing that strikes you about Soccer Star World Cup Edition is the amount of accurate statistics on offer here. Just about every country in the world has its team represented, complete with the correct players, what position they play in, what foot they prefer and so on. Take it from us, it's very comprehensive. There's no league option (being able to choose Spurs, Liverpool etc), but you can create and edit your own teams and leagues so that isn't really a problem; just a niggle. There's an arcade option too, but to be honest this isn't much cop, despite having all the usual options like aftertouch, substitutions, bookings and sending, offs. It's slow, not user-friendly and I'd suggest you stick to the management side of things. PRINCE OF PERSIA / MEGA DRIVE / DOMARK PRICE: .99 The Mega Drive may have been one of the last machines to get a version of this game, but that doesn't devalue it in any way. This is still one of the most solid and engrossing platformers ever. ISSUE 149: 84% A One of the best features of the game are the goalies. They leap and stretch all over the shop and are very realistic. VERDICT This football team is obviously not doing too well, look at the lack of advertising boards! PAC ATTACK / SNES / NAMCO / PRICE IMPORT This is a really strange combination of Connect Four, Pacman and Tetris which works really well. It's surprisingly addictive considering the strangeness of the gameplay, and well worth investigating. ISSUE 150: 87% A500/A1200 For a game put together without a big development team it's very professional. The management option has a staggering amount of info, there's a lot of fun to be had. The arcade option is poor though, both in presentation and to play. Not as polished as Premier Manager 2, but worth a look for the comprehensiveness of the management side. RIK SKEWS TEMPEST 2000 / JAGUAR / ATARI / PRICE:  This may be an updated version of a 10 year-old shoot-'em-up, but it features enough new facets to make it one of the best blasters of the year. It's also the best Jag game so far. ISSUE 151: 84% Here's the good old Blighty team in their glory. You can tinkle with absolutely stacks of options so stat heads should be kept happy. BULB THE AWARD FOR THIS MONTH'S CARTRIDGE CALAMITY GOES TO... AVOID GRAPHICS 30 SOUND 34 PLAYABILITY 64 VALUE 71 OVERALL ALTERNATIVE SNES Player Manager Imagineer/.99 This blends the Kick Off 2 game engine, and a great management option, with curly Kev Keegan effortlessly and rather brilliantly. ISSUE 142: 95% PINK GOES TO HOLLYWOOD / MEGA DRIVE TECMAGIK / PRICE: .99 The Pink Panther marks his Mega Drive debut with a highly uninspiring release. The sprites and animation are generally good, but the dull platform gameplay really sucks eggs. ISSUE 151: 48% Goal Lasso!

"GO!ING, GO!ING, GONE.. REVIEW CVG SNES RACING GAME .99 OUT NOW ASTRO GO! GO! NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED 00 2121 Hold tight, it's apparently time for another Mode 7 racing game. Let's hope those pretty graphics aren't hiding a polluted game... h, those screenshots look mighty tasty eh? Which is exactly what a number of import dealers probably thought when they put the word around that this game was hot stuff. But is it? Astro Go! Go! is clearly an imitation of Nintendo's early racing game F-Zero. There are different sets of courses and different futuristic cars to bomb round in, and like any racing game proper you need to finish in a qualifying position to progress onwards. Each track has a theme to it, and within that are appropriate dangers scattered throughout the course: the Pinball track for example is littered with annoyingly placed bouncers and missable accelerator wheels. On other tracks there are even holes which you can fall in if you don't activate the appropriate switches. You get the idea. After each lap you get a token which you can use to activate a shield, or if you save up a pair, a burst of extra speed. But is it us, or are those opponent cars never around to make it worthwhile using them? Let's see... The perspective in this game makes it very difficult to see what's coming up, so when the screen suddenly starts scrolling backwards you're bound to crash. VERDICT DODA On this stage there are fans which elevate you allowing you to hover around. Keep away from the edges or you'll fall off the track. SNES Lavish colours; some of the smoothest Mode 7 around (which don't require a special chip), but when you start playing you realise it's sadly dull. There's hardly any interaction with opponent racers, none of that excitement you get from battling for track position. The perspective is too high, so you never get to see very far ahead on the track which results in plenty of crashes. You'll play this briefly for its bizarre appeal, but Nintendo's ancient F-Zero is better. DENIZ AHMET You have to be quick to dodge these holes but if you pass over the switches (skulls) they'll close up. GRAPHICS 81 SOUND PLAYABILITY 60 VALUE 50 68 00.33916 A lot of tracks involve jumping from one part of the track to another. You can steer yourself while jumping so it's not difficult. Doooooooo OVERALL ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE Micro Machines Codemasters/.99 An addictive overhead racer with different vehicles and loads of themed tracks, crammed with dangers for you to dodge. Great fun. ISSUE 135: 89% Like all tracks, this one has a theme to it which in this instance is a pinball table. Bounce off the bells and hit arrows to go faster. The ribbed areas, found on corners and edges, slow you down; so try to stay central if you want to win. GAME BY MELDACCONTACT PLANET CONSOLES (0272 413030) FOR IMPORT COPIES CART SIZE 8MEGS 83 "

"0% NYLON. 100% COTTON REVIEW CVG SNES SHOOT-'EM-UP .99 ION IMPORT PC ENGINE ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED COTTON A blast from the past and no mistake. One of the best shoot-'emups on the PC Engine has been enhanced especially for the SNES... T seem liker a 1. Having wasted a boss, what better way to relax than with a cup of tea? Yep, it's tea time and that means collecting as many falling tea bags as possible for big points. here are four ways to make a violent game seem like it isn't: you can take away the gore for starters, make the graphics cute, and compliment the entire event with silly fairground music. Oh, and you can give your game a silly name, like Cotton for example. Like most shoot-'em-ups, Cotton rides along the same theme of shooting enemies for no apparent reason other than the fact that you might be lucky enough to get a power-up as a result, and so repeat the procedure more efficiently. Having sussed the lack of originality then, it's pleasing to know that Cotton's old-fashioned play values pay dividends, and the vulnerability induced by riding a broomstick injects a degree of panic lacking in space-based games. The most notable addition to the SNES version, apart from speed, is the lavish parallax backdrops which lead you along from left to right and occasionally up and down. Bosses appear during, and at the end of, each level and in response to that most important shoot-'em-up query nope, there isn't any slowdown. Want to know more? Read on... VERDICT 2200 SNES Cotton is the most lighthearted shoot-'em-up since Pop 'n' Twinbee, and it has much of the same cutesy appeal, albeit without the twoplayer option. It plays and handles well, and is a good challenge. The problem is originality; ie there isn't any. And as a conversion of the PC Engine, it can seem outdated in places, especially with the rather crude bosses. Cotton isn't bad at all, but brilliant it isn't, and it's not exciting enough to be overly impressive. DENIZ AHMET For head-on firepower you just can't beat this plasma-type device which releases a continuous beam of energy. Each broomstick has a variation on this, as shown here with fire and ice. 55 You have three special weapons indicated at the bottom right of the screen. You'll need to collect tokens to boost your supplies of each. The best weapon slings a large lump of cotton around the screen killing all. GRAPHICS 86 SOUND PLAYABILITY 75 VALUE 67 OVERALL The bubble around you is one of your special weapons. Obviously it's a shield, and as such doesn't last forever. Save it for the bosses if you can. ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE Grind Stormer Tengen/.95 Import There aren't many good vertical shoot-'em-ups on Mega Drive, so this one is definitely worth checking out. Fast, hectic action all the way. NOT PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED The bosses are difficult to beat if you haven't got any special weapons with you. If you do though, you can usually kill them with one shot which is a bit on the disappointing side. 25 GAME BY DATAM POLYSTAR CONTACT PLANET CONSOLES (0272 413030) FOR IMPORT COPIES CART SIZE 16MEG 85 "


"CVG REVIEW KILLS ALL KNOWN GERMS DEAD 3DO BEAT-'EM-UP -100 OUT NOW SNES VERSION ALSO AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED He's a real man: brave, strong, plus he packs a rather tight leotard; and huge, towering Godzilla-like creatures absolutely cack themselves when they see him... ULTRAMAN This is the first of the baddies you'll battle with in the game. It likes to grab you and spit in your face. Do flying head kicks to finish him off. Itraman is the strange superhero of the majority of those cheap Japanese B-movies. Despite resembling something out of Mork and Mindy his main purpose in life is to protect the population from 50-feet tall monsters. And here there are 10 of these monstrosities, and as you battle the screen zooms in and out on the action in a similar fashion to SNK's Art of Fighting game. Now what does it take to be a superhero? Well apart from apalling taste in lycra, you need a special power; and Ultraman has at his disposal five different types of magic (just like a special move really). And that's it. This is a beat-'em-up, and you know the score. Of course there's a two player mode in there, but the problem with beat-'em-ups themed on one character is obvious there's no other characters to play as. ULTRAMAN BALTE ULTRAMAN TELESDD The only really impressive thing about Ultraman is the introduction. Here's a selection of shots. As in the game proper, whenever the pilot crashes he'll turn into Ultraman. This nasty doesn't appreciate getting trapped. He digs himself underground and pops up elsewhere on the screen. The green energy bars allow you to perform a special attack when fully charged. There's also a time limit, as usual. There's a great library of film stills, for the real diehard Ultraman fans. 86 GAME BY BANDAI CONTACT RAVEN GAMES (081-663 6810) FOR INFORMATION ONE OR TWO PLAYER GAME "


"KILLS ALL KNOWN GERMS DEAD REVIEW CUG This is one of the harder bosses to contend with. She'll blast you with electricity if you get too close. Moves a bit quick too. SECOND OPINION This game has all the things to impress you until you actually play it. I'm fed up with long FMV intros especially when I can't understand the Japanese words, but then again it is on import so I can't really complain! But the problem is the gamplay, apart from being easy, it just isn't compelling enough to make me want to spend any time with it. You'll play it to see all the fancy graphics but that's about it. GARY LORD VERDICT In these flying sequences you get two chances to blast the baddy before he hits you and you crash and turn in to Ultraman. ULTRA VIOLENCE WITALULIRA MAN 3DO For the first beat-'em-up on 3Do this isn't that bad, but the programmers seem to have forgotten about the gameplay in making the game look flash with unnecessary FMV clips. Basically, there aren't enough moves in the game to justify it being a beat-'em-up, and as I got through six of the ten opponents on my second go, I'd say there's little lastability. Ultraman is too shallow. All Bandai has done here is upgrade the graphics from the fouryear-old SNES version. DENIZ AHMET OTHER VERSION GRAPHICS 85 SOUND PLAYABILITY 70 VALUE 20 This chap is nifty with the old combination attacks against you. His main attack is the leg sweep. 68 The story and theme are the same, but obviously there isn't any of the FMV footage, and the flying bits are missing too. Good then, but dull by today's standards.

"CVG REVIEWS DOESN'T LIFE DRAG-ON SNES/MEGA DRIVE/GAME GEAR BEAT-'EM-UP .99/.99/.99 TOUT SEPTEMBER MASTER SYSTEM VERSION ALSO AVAILABLE JAGUAR AND 3DO VERSIONS PLANNED Back in the Seventies, people flocked to the cinema to see martial arts legend Bruce 'Dragon' Lee; Brucie is now having somewhat of a Nineties revival, but will people be flocking to buy Virgin's videogame in similar numbers? GAME GEAR Each level ends, as you would expect, with a boss. This particular one has a thing about chains and wrapping them around your head. he mystery surrounding Bruce Lee's death is probably only rivalled by the mystery that surrounds the death of his son Brandon's, on the set of the film The Crow. You see no-one knows how Bruce died, but many, including the Lee family, firmly believe that it had something to do with supernatural causes. If you've seen the film Dragon then you will be familiar with the masked, figure which had supposedly haunted martial arts supremo since his childhood. Not surprisingly, Virgin has made its official Dragon licence a beat-'em-up, and has adopted some of the Lee legend in that the ultimate foe is the aforementioned masked spirit. The game revolves around the combat scenes from the movie of the same name, and the unique thing with Dragon is that it gives you the chance for two players to fight the same opponent simultaneously. Whether this is a sufficient enough novelty is debatable, and with just one character to play it might lack staying power... There are over 2,000 frames of animation in the Mega Drive game, and although it looks good it's not quite in the same league as the SNES version. V MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE SNES A Dragon is compatible with ALL the multi-tap adaptors available which enables a three player beat-'em-up like the old C64 hit International Karate Plus. GAME GEAR MEGA DRIVE Sie Bruce proves that jogging bottoms aren't the best bit of kit to out scrapping with. Here, appalled at their offensive colour and design, the villains gang up to give Bruce a fashion lesson. A You fight the masked spirit once you've lost all your lives. If you beat it you get a life back. cm Each level is accompanied by some decent scene setting stills that are digitised from the film.

JELIGHEI Dragon isn't a game for those of you who resemble a pair of old boil washed Y-fronts. No sir, it's real men that are needed here and you can see why when you take a look at some of the wincesome things that happen to fough as nails Bruce. We wanted an ice pack and packet of plasters after looking at these shots! As to be expected in videogames these days there's plenty of bonus and secret rooms for you to try and locate. There's also a neat training section where the boy Bruce can get in a few training rounds. These drunken sailors will resort to anything to deck you. This chain in your neck works like Scorpion's in Mortal Kombat. Fighting two opponents at once isn't easy. Best keep jumping around or bring in another player. HYARR! HAI KARATE! POW! TAKE THAT!

"DOESN'T LIFE DRAG-ON REVIEWS CVG GAME GEAR SNES VERDICT SNES The criminal genius out to stop Bruce isn't all that smart. Sending fat beardy old people to tackle a karate master isn't a good move unless it's pension day; I mean have you seen the way they get to the front of the post office queue? I VERDICT A You can throw an opponent to the ground if you get close enough. SNES The SNES version is much better than the Mega Drive one in every sense. The graphics are sharper and smoother, the opponents are harder and in TURBO Mode it's almost as fast as Streetfighter 2 Turbo in 10 star mode. The problem though, is the lack of moves available for Bruce, since you can't put together any real variety in combo attacks. Given this, and that you can't select any other characters to play as, it doesn't offer the lastability of SF II, but it is very good. DENIZ AHMET A In Match mode you fight yourself. If you lose the other Bruce will jump and crush your ribs. This was a favourite Bruce 'death move' in his movies. GAME GEAR RADARI As well as fighting, Bruce also has to avoid hazards such as this utterly unrealistic buzzsaw. VERDICT MEGA DRIVE Good stuff but nowhere as good as on the SNES. Whereas the SNES game plays like a one-on-one beat-'em-up the Mega Drive game seems much more like a Streets-ofRage type affair instead of a one-on-one fighting game. The graphics, while good, are not in the SNES' league and the sound is also a pale imitation. It's a great film tiein though, with some excellent cutaways and if you're a Lee fan you should be satisfied with this. It's a bit easy though. RIK SKEWS GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 84 PLAYABILITY 82 I VALUE 78 MEGA DRIVE OVERALL R4 GAME GEAR Virgin has opted to make the handheld version a platformer, rather than take on the tricky task of producing a beat-'em-up. As such they've created a game which is nothing special. Bruce can take on his enemies with combinations of punches and kicks which are accessed by pressing B and direction, which makes them difficult to use when you're surrounded. The action's limited, despite the programmers' best attempts to spice it up. Not a patch on its 16-bit cousins. MARK PATTERSON GRAPHICS 76 SOUND 74 PLAYABILITY 74 VALUE 71 10 levels, 30 opponents, 40 attack moves sounds great eh? Unfortunately the gameplay is average and too easy.

We can't remember Bruce fighting these girls in the movie but you have to do it here anywhere. Kick 'em where it hurts! To get close to this opponent you'll have to smash through blocks of ice which he pushes your way. Try and jump over them it's quicker. 60 A When Bruce dies he has to fight Death and if he wins he gets his life restored!

"CVG REVIEW GET THOSE PORK SCRATCHINGS OUT! AMIGA ARCADE POOL SIMULATION .99 OUT NOW instor REDIC NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE PC, CD-ROM VERSIONS PLANNED Will Team 17 be able to make a splash with the latest Pool simulation to hit the Amiga? A Look smug when you've potted a classic shot by using the instant-replay option. couple of years back who would have thought that we'd ever see a decent 'cue-based' game. That was before veteran programmer Archer Maclean and his awesome Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker game though. Later of course we got Archer Maclean's Pool and were equally blown away. Now Team 17 is hoping to make similar waves with its own pool-based game. Options a-plenty await you, including UK and US 8 Ball, 9 Ball and Speed Pool. Don't worry if you've never played these before though, the rules are simple enough to pick up. Apart from this there's also a custom option (so you make your own settings), a trickshot table (where you can set up neat tricks) and a survivor option where each player has a number of lives, one of which is lost every time you fail to pocket a ball. VERDICT The controls at the bottom right of the screen let you position your cue on the ball (by moving a black dot around the white ball) and alter how much power you'll apply (by increasing or decreasing the red bar). Player One FOUL Dover Che cosate opponents boti le SIL On the easier levels a white line shows you the predicted path of the cue ball exactly once you've struck it. O AMIGA All the options offer a sound game while the computer's difficulty level is well set. Even better is the two player mode, especially when playing Survivor. The Sound FX also deserve special praise, it's good to hear pool balls that sound like the real thing instead of someone kicking a cat (or something)! The only real complaint I have is that the overhead perspective is not as realistic as the many views in Archer Maclean's Pool, but at  this is a bargain. RIK SKEWS A Don't worry if you're not used to the rules of Pool. Not only are they simple to pick up, but the computer will give you an info box should you foul. The trickshot option is great fun. You can set the balls up in any way desired before attempting that breathtaking shot. Steue Heley Speed POOL GRAPHICS 83 SOUND 80 PLAYABILITY 84 | VALUE 90 ALTERNATIVE PC Archer Maclean's Pool Virgin/.99 We much prefer this to Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker since it's easier to get into and has a wealth of options. Yummy. ISSUE 142: 89% OVERALL Here's the speed pool option. As you can probably guess you've got to pot balls as quickly as possible. On the A500 the computer can take too long to make a move, in which case you can force it to play its best move at that time. 83  GAME BY TEAM 17.

"CVG REVIEW HIT THE ROAD JACK, AND DON'T YOU COME BACK. IPC-CD ADVENTURE GAME .99 OUT NOW PC DISK VERSION AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SAMAS MAD Ace Venturer the Pet Detective has got nothing on the antics of this unlikely duo. Time for walkies with Sam & Max... he most important aspect of a good adventure game is the script, and for a CD version the usual way to improve on this aspect is to have a 'talkie version. And that's what US Gold has done with this overdue conversion of the floppy original. Sam & Max work as a team through their journeys to tourist camps as they try to solve a succession of disappearances. You control Max (the dog) for most of the game, but you have to switch to Sam for some of the tasks. The appeal of Sam & Max is the twisted sense of humour which comes from its bizarre cartoon animations and nutty dialogue. Assisting this is humorous animation sequences which activate at key points to shift the pace of the game and reveal clues a kind of reward for your efforts. The challenge on offer is excellent, but considering there is no extra gameplay over the original floppy version, is this a bit of a slack conversion? CONE I VERDICT WAK untuiz PC-CD The addition of speech is a huge improvement to what was a top game anyway. The jokes work much better when spoken rather than written, and generally the game is far more involving. Sam & Max have excellent personalities and the use of two simultaneous characters works really well. The best thing is that Sam & Max gets you straight into the action with none of that rubbish about gathering important items before you can start solving the plot proper. DENIZ AHMET In the fairground Sam and Max go for a ride on the rotat. ing swing, and the game kicks into an animation sequence. There are lots of these animated sequences.

ES round 100 million Mario games have been sold worldwide thanks to their gobsmacking playability. Put simply the Mario games are the best platformers created and many people would argue they're the best games ever. Still, the idea is getting on a bit, so what new angle could Nintendo take? An excellent one as it happens, because this time round you get to play Mario's enemy Wario. It's not Mario you're up against though, there's a whole host of pirates and critters out to thwart you in numerous platform levels. You see Wario's attempt to pillage enough coins from numerous platform levels to build a castle that will out do the one Mario built at the end of Super Mario Land CHETE There's three different hats to pick up and they do the following: As you'd expect from a Mario game there's a great stack of bonus games to play. VERDICT 320 728 BULLUse this to break through blocks with just one dash. A A map shows you the entire level you're currently on. Each level has plenty of courses to explore. GAME BOY Surprise, surprise, Nintendo comes up trumps again with a Super Mario game. It's slightly weird playing the nasty character, but you're stunned by what's on offer. Graphics, sound, playability: it's a joyous overload everywhere you bounce. The only complaints I have are that sometimes the Wario sprite proves too big on the cramped screen and overall it's fairly easy. Still, there's a lot of secrets to discover so lastability isn't a problem. Another Nintendo cracker. RIK SKEWS There's two pots here. One contains plenty of money, the other a 10-ton weight.

"CVG CVE REVIEWS REVIEWS AND HERE'S THE REST EVERY GAME REVIEWED We have to play every game released, regardless of format; and that's why we know what's what when we say a game's perfect or just a pile of poo... GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL Arcade perfect. That is, extremely basic and very flatlooking indeed. Blip, blip, blip, woo, woo, woo. Sounds akin to a very old fruit machine. Very basic and extremely repetitive. Fun for about half-an-hour at the most. A great leap backwards in gaming thrills. For mad people only. PACMAN (NES) RATING: 42% MS PACMAN (GB) Not much blur, but not much anything else, either. Simple to the point of laziness. Classic sound effects ie quite crap. Guaranteed to annoy you after about five minutes. Scrolling maze means you can't see what's coming up, leading to much frustration. A very bad idea indeed, this. A dull old game is made worse by a stupid conversion. RATING: 36% doo Plenty of variety and some absolutely gorgeous sprites particularly the bosses. While the effects are good, the tunes don't really carry any atmosphere. Nice and simple to get into, although this simplicity does occasionally lead to repetitiveness. Some good original ideas here, but the game isn't really captivating RATING: 76% The crowd is certainly excited about the game, but the organ music might get on your wick if you have any taste. Certainly easy enough to get into, but it's all rather limited and repetitive. Big, detailed and well animated sprites, but only one (rather bland) backdrop. OK if you're a baseball fan, but this isn't going to turn anyone on to the sport. RATING: 70% ALCAHEST (SNES) RBI BASEBALL'94 MEGA DRIVE (SNES) SUPER MAGIC BOY PUYO PUYO (SNES) TIME TRAX (SNES Nice and cute, but obviously styled for the Amiga. Plus, the animation is a bit cack. Boy are those tunes catchy. The effects aren't bad, but they're sometimes lost in the music. Niggling frustrations soon add up, and there isn't enough originality to keep you interested Uninspired and uninspiring platformer which is inoffensive enough, but not really worth investigation. RATING: 68% Quite basic, really, what with the sprites just being little lobs and everything. Very Japanese cutesy tunes which sound like something off a test card. Very addictive Tetris-style play, although lacking somewhat in the originality department. A splendid puzzle effort with a lot of personality which is overshadowed by Super Mega Bomb Gun Tetris 7. RATING: 89% Very busy, with small but perfectly formed and well animated sprites plus good backdrops. Spooky tunes add a lot of atmosphere and the speech and effects are top notch. Tonnes of moves, plenty of originality and a good sense of tension to keep you going Challenging, absorbing and loads of fun to play one of the best platform beat-'emups on the SNES. RATING: 89% 98 "


"AND HERE'S THE REST REVIEWS CVG GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL Spectacular by Master System standards, great sprites and serene backdrops. Also great by the usual MS levels, the music and effects are rather soothing in a way Deep and challenging gameplay, you'll be hooked after the first couple of levels right through to the end. An absolute must-buy for all Master System owners, whether you like the sound of it or not, you'll love it. RATING: 94% ECCO THE (MASTER) CARNAGE DOLPHIN TOTAL AMIGA Blocky sprites and much slowdown in effect here. Ick central! Absolutely dire. It sounds not unlike the torture of small furry animals in the pits of hell Slow, sluggish, unresponsive choose your least favourite gameplay attribute and it's here. Total rubbish! Boring, frustrating and just plain very very bad indeed. RATING: 21% Very pretty with an enormous wealth of detail, just like one of them Constable paintings. Atmospheric, if a little slow on the old uptake. Sounds as you'd expect. Not exactly an original format anymore, but there's a lot of new puzzles and fun to be had. If you can put up with 10 disks, you should like this: although not as much as Beneath a Steel Sky. RATING: 84 % Lovely polygon mapping and some very detailed sprites make this v. good-looking. Nice booming effects add to the aura of violence permeating the proceedings. Takes a bit of getting used to, but once you've got the hang of things this is highly absorbing. Not one for those without patience, this is a very rewarding title should you stick out the learning curve. RATING: 89% Tiny little horse sprites which, to be frank, aren't going to get any one excited. Whinny! Parp! Wow! What a complete aural feast! I don't really think so, somehow. Know anything about horse training? Then stick to training real horses. At least you'll make some money out of that. Full of absolutely no variety, and only of interest to your actual real horse experts. RATING: 42% KING'S AMIGA 2 GEDDON 2 QUEST VI ARMOUR AMIGA MASTER AMIGA SEVEN PC WOLFPACK CIVILIZATION STARLORD CORRIDOR STABLE PC FOR WINDOWS PC-CD It's those DOOMish graphics again. Smooth and atmospheric, but not as good. Not much in the sound effects depot 'fraid. The odd sound keeps you awake at least. It's a cheap alternative to DOOM, but no where near as impressive. There's some good atmosphere to be experienced here, but there's not enough things to kill. RATING: 39% Not baaad, but you've seen this kind of thing a million times already. Absolutely hideous, turn down the volume quick or you're going to die! The strategy has some major flaws in it, and the 3D shooting bits are slow, badly programmed and dire. Oh gosh, as if there aren't enough space trading shooting games already, here comes a v. bad one. RATING: 46% Vastly improved over the original Civilization, dead ace and smooth a real atmosphere boost. Not exactly enthralling, but perfectly adequate for the game in hand. Completely absorbing. Kiss goodbye to having any friends left as soon as you buy this One of the most in-depth games yet programmed, and an absolute if you don't have the original. RATING: 90% Primitive looking, certainly takes no advantage of the CD capabilities on offer. Ditto here, a few hissy samples where there should have been a catalogue of real booms. Simplistic compared to the majority of CD simulations. Quite sparse on the action front. Not worth the money when you think you could get hold of Silent Service on budget, which is better. RATING: 41% 99 "


"CVG REVIEWS AND HERE'S THE REST GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL Extremely basic sprites and backgrounds. Very Play School in atmosphere. Equally kids' programmelike in their bouncy jolliness. Could get annoying for adults. Plenty of puzzles here, but they're all a little on the simple side. Not much arcade skill required. A very good game for children, this should get their brain working. RATING: 78% Nice graphics, plenty of new scenes and some gorgeous still screens. Hey! Surprise surprise! Exactly the same as the original Privateer! Well, there's some new scenarios and a few new power-ups if that makes any difference. Liked the original? Then this is right up your street. Not worth buying the original for, though. RATING: 72% Not unlike a poor Commodore 64 8-bit game with all the charm removed. Fitting rendition of 'What a Friend We Have in Jesus' for this Christian game but very poor quality. Far too simplistic to be fun, and far too frustrating to hold your interest for more than a couple of goes. Brings new meaning to 'arcade conversion'. Will have you praying for salvation from the horror. RATING: 10% Looks like an Eighties Amiga game all raytraced backdrops and the like. Not exactly on the wrong side of bad, but this isn't going to win any awards for audio excellence. Limited and extremely frustrating, not to mention a million years out of date. No new ideas, no fun factor. This is really rather dull and shows a chronic lack of imagination. RATING: 26% Some nice effects, but the majority of in-game graphics are of a low quality. Desperately average. So average, in fact, that the sound is actually abnormal. That's a paradox, that is. Terrible player interface, and the access time is ridiculous. Learn to program, dolts! A potentially ace adventure totally spoiled by poor mechanics and a lack of playtesting. RATING: 41% WARFARE RIGHTEOUS DIZZY PC FIRE PC PC PC PC-CD SPACESHIP IN EXTREMIS GREAT NAVAL SHADOWREUNION RED HELL DOOFUS SPIRITUAL PRIVATEER: FANTASTIC PC PC BATTLES 2 CASTER CD PC WARLOCK CD PC Quite average to be honest, nothing in the realm of 7th Guest, that's for sure. The PC equivalent of supermarket music; it's there in the background but you never really notice it. Incredible depth of play, although it may be a little hard going for lightweights. Definitely one for strategy buffs. Be prepared to invest a lot of time, though. RATING: 89% Great, detailed and very imaginative sprites create a lot of atmosphere. Groovy choons and atmospheric FX. Banging, nice one, top one, sorted. A fast-moving and exciting RPG without the attendant baggage you'd expect from this genre. This should appeal to most arcade fans, but RPG purists will come to curse the lack of depth. RATING: 80% Not too bad until you zoom in on your periscope block central! Alee! Atmosphere-boosting effects abound here. Great if you can hook it up through stereo speakers. A perfect mix of strategy and planning with enough shooting, bombing and death to satisfy action types. Whaddya know, they are great naval battles and all. A superb purchase for everyone. RATING: 90% A nice, grainy movie quality prevails, but the aliens are of a laughable B-movie grade. Perfectly adequate, although hardly the spinechilling stuff you need for this sort of game. PC Good enough for a short while there's plenty of gore. But it's all too slow. Waaay toooo slow. A sub-Doom effort destined to languish in the shadow of the superior demonbuster for all eternity. RATING: 54% More gorgeous than the lovely Paul Rand. Except they actually are gorgeous. The sort of sound that says 'Hey let's just enhance that atmosphere and chill out, huh?' Intuitive, addictive and thoroughly enjoyable but waaaay too easy. You should finish this in one sitting In you've just had a frontal lobotomy and can't play games, you'll love this. If not, you won't. RATING: 26% 100 "

He has got a nice new white jacket that you can't move your arms in.

Have you heard that scientists now believe that it is possible to live without a brain, thanks to Simon? TOMMY SPENCE, East Linton, Scotland YOB: And thanks to you, Tommy, for being the first guinea pig to prove the scientists' theory.

Is there a SNES CD unit coming out? If so, when? And for how much? 3. Is Return Of The Jedi coming out for the SNES? If so, when? 4. Is the Game Gear TV Tuner any good? In issue 149 you got a letter from a guy in Germany asking 'Why are the mountains so high?' and you said Haven't you noticed the country you're in doesn't have any'. Well Germany has got mountains, there's the Hearts mountains and some in Bavaria, the tallest being the Zugspitz. I should know, I've been to them. Apart from that I'd like to say the mag is well sorted, so keep it up. GARETH MCGAW, Laarbruch, Germany PS Before you insult me for being German I would like to say I am 100% British. I only live in Germany because of my Dad's job. YOB: That's as may be, but you sound like a bit of a smartass so that's good enough for me. Send 'em all to Germany, that's what I say it's the only language these people understand. 1. Some High Street stores are reducing cart prices by up to  because they've overstocked on crap games. 2.

F1GP has extensive car set-up options, but for the most part you can leave them be, and real klutzes can get the computer to show the best racing line then keep the car more or less on it, and also suggest gears, get the car out of spins and make it indestructible.

The game starts in your garage where you get to whiz around your rotating 3D car, fixing up your tyres, setting the angle of your wings and adjusting your gear ratios before you take to the track where legions of other IndyCarmeisters are waiting to beat you into last place. The first thing that strikes you as soon as you hit the track is the game's graphics everything is texture-mapped, so you get billboards around the circuit, adverts on the bridges and the cars' engine cowlings and air intakes, and even the wheels appear to have aluminium-spoked hubs. This makes even F1 GP look simplistic, but the payoff is speed; you really need a powerful 486 PC to get IndyCar running smoothly, whereas F1GP will quite happily run along on a 386. The other thing about IndyCar is that it really is for players who are well into motor racing.

Bring us as many of your problems along and we'll sort them aaht. Guaranteed completely safe. No danger to small animals or the environment. Now do I have any takers? Le kn S kenh\" SPESIS BAD DAY AT BLACKROCK I recently splashed out on a copy of Ultima Underworld Il: Labyrinth of Worlds. It's a stunning game, but it's got me completely stumped. I'm sure I've explored everywhere in the castle, but I can't seem to find anywhere new to go. None of the other characters want to give me any clues, and I seem to be wandering around in circles. What am I supposed to do next? Laurel Taylor, Basingstoke Frontier dilemma: to make money FINANCIAL FRONTIER you need a bigger ship. To get a bigger ship you need to make money. I've been playing Frontier on my A1200 and I think it's ace, except that it's taking me ages to get any money together to buy a decent ship with some smart weapons. I've been wasting my time carrying little parcels around Formalhaut and Ross 154 for ages and I hardly seem to have made any progress. Where can I get some big wodges of cash without using that passenger cabin cheat (I haven't got enough money to actually buy a passenger cabin yet anyway!). P Beaumains, Leicester ANTE Find the small blackrock gem which is knocking around in the lower levels of the castle basement. Take It to Nystul the magician who will energise it, then take it back down to the lowest level and use it on the large blackrock gem which is surrounded by water (It looks like the one in the picture on the game box). The gems should fuse together and one of the faces of the large blackrock should change colour. Now you can travel to a different world by walking into the large blackrock, on the side that's just been altered. When you find other small blackrock gems, repeat the process and other worlds open up. One of the best trade routes we've found for a starting-off Frontierperson like yourself, P, is one between Barnard's Star and Sol not far away from where you are now. So get yourself over there and ferry luxury Items from Sol to Barnard's Star, then pick up elther computers or robots (whatever you can afford, but you can earn more profit on robots) and take them to Sol. Once you've docked in the Sol system always check the bulletin boards before you sell your wares, since there's sometimes someone willing to pay a very high price for computers or robots. That way you can make a killing quickly, so invest in a larger ship with more cargo space as soon as possible and watch your cash go through the roof. When you've made all the money you want you can trade your ship in for a trusty Cobra Mk III, fit it out with plenty of weapons and then take on loads of military missions to bump up your ratings.

"CVG FEATURE GOLDEN OLDIES OR MOULDIES? BACK TO THE PASE 'They don't make 'em like they used to,' apparently... but Rik Skews has been compiling some evidence to the contrary... ostalgia stinks. Don't you hate it when your parents tell you music is nowhere as good as it used to be? And something similar is happening in the games industry at the moment; journalists and programmers believe the 'golden age of games' has passed, and now all we get is endless variations on the same themes. And who are we to argue? Unlike old albums or TV programmes once a game has passed its sell-by date it's gone forever. That's when nostalgia rears its head. Thing is, if you get a chance to look at something you loved a few years ago and haven't seen recently, chances are you'll be disappointed. Anyone who's watched the reruns of Doctor Who or Grange Hill will know what I mean. That's the position 1 found myself in when I visited the Computer Cavern a shop with a vast back catalogue of long-forgotten computer and video games. Stocking copies of virtually every game ever released, once I started playing some old faves ! was soon amazed at how dated some of them seemed. I'd forgotten how grim it is sitting Computer firms should take note of what they call their products. Here's two previous failures with the titles Lynx and Microcosm! It's a never ending Christmas for Rik as he ploughs through thousands of old games gathering dust in the Computer Cavern. 104 ET on the Atari VCS probably the worst game ever. Atari manufactured millions of ET games and legend has it that they're now buried in a desert somewhere. around for five minutes waiting for a game to load, and hoping that it was going to work! Hurrah for hard drives and carts! Something else touted by 'golden age' zealots is that games today don't offer the value they used to. Well, I completed Commando on the C64 in under five Some REALLY crap old games! From left to right: Sammy the Sea Serpent, Paul Daniel's Magic Adventure (nice hair Paul), Jeffrey Archer's Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, Sea Horse Hide 'n Seek. Seek and Find. Don't Buy This! (a collection of crap games) and Math Fun minutes. It might have been  but that's still a lot to pay for a day's gaming. I don't mind paying  for a game if it's going to last me years like NBA Jam or 122 THE COMPUTER CAVERN IS IN MARLOW.

"GOLDEN OLDIES OR MOULDIES? FEATURE CVG CONTROVERSIAL GAMES Computer graveyard. The dreadful Sinclair QL and Commodore Plus 4 and a couple of MSXs. MSX was intended to be a global standard for computers but flopped. Here are two games that the censors would be complaining about long before Sega's NightTrap or a Mortal Kombat death move came along. Barbarian was a violent game that had a welldodgy decapitation scene and Sam Fox Strip Poker was about as PC as Bernard Manning. Ecco and Chaos Engine things are changing. And the argument that there's no originality in games? Well what may seem like 'another plat. form game' to older gamers could be the greatest thing ever to new gamesplayers. And anyway what about games like Theme Park, Doom, Mean Bean Machine and ideas like hidden moves? Don't get me wrong, while I was at the Computer Cavern I saw numerous classic games that have stood the test of time well. I just wish that people would realise that there's plenty of great games around today that will be regarded as classics. these game have been heavily hyped but they're all brilliant products too. Old games were often offensive too, with many featuring sad storylines about maidens needing to be rescued. Combine this with sad covers like Maria Whittaker on the front of Barbarian and it's no wonder that to people outside the industry, gamesplayers were and probably still are thought of as anorak-wearing nerds. The current controversy about violent games ignores the fact that violent games are nothing new. CRL's Jack the Ripper was an early game to feature an age rating long before Sega's Night Trap; and in the beat-'em-up Barbarian the finishing move involved the loser's head being chopped off before being kicked off-screen by a goblin! OK, so the graphics aren't as good or as graphic as in Mortal Kombat but the intention is the same. One thing that hits you when you play this veteran software is how good the music used to be. A fierce and biting Rob Hubbard soundtrack or one of Martin Galway's tuneful numbers sounds better than ever. It seems incredible that seven years ago Rob Hubbard could get quality 20 minute soundtracks into 4K, when programmers today can't get half the results with over 1mb. Luckily with the advent of CD and CD games like CRAP LICENCES (Below) A View to a Kill was so bad there wasn't even any shots on the back of the box, while the only scary thing about Friday the 13th was the dreadful gameplay. Sensible Soccer. And it's usually only the quality titles that prosper. At random I picked the Mega Drive chart from last month, the top five were: FIFA, PGA Euro Tour, NBA Jam, SubTerrania and Sonic 3. Admittedly all five of WA RILE COMPUTER This is a shot from the original Streetfighter arcade machine. It was appalling compared to Streetfighter 2 because there was little gameplay, you simply had to hit pressure pads as hard as possible to beat opponents.
