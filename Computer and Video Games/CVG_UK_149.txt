"|| the usual new games news, NEWS AND plus Amstrad's venture into the CD-i market, the latest on JVC launching a rival to the Mega Drive, games certification and a chance to win Empire Strikes Back from JVC! FREE 4-WAY MEGA DRIVE PLAY FOR MICRO MACHINES 2! AMSTRAD SET TO BOOST CD-i PHILIPS hilips' CD-i format is set to receive a massive boost later in the year, when Amstrad launches its own version of the machine. Nothing has been confirmed by either party yet, but CVG understands that Amstrad is particularly keen on the notion of the interactive CD market and has been looking for a way in for some time. Rather than develop a completely separate technology of its own, which is both costly and time consuming, it will licence the technology from Philips and manufacture a machine bearing the Amstrad brand name. The firm's director of international marketing, David Hennell told CVG: \"We're a firm believer in the notion of the magic black box under the television that plays games, videos, music etc. It's a market that interests us a great deal and there are a number of routes we could take -3DO, CD32 or CD-i and others as well. Most importantly, it's not the greatest idea to go out with your own standard. It's very costly and you can't do it quickly because you have to drum up support from the software houses and create a buzz surrounding the format. \"I definitely think we could make a market, certainly in Europe and Australia, with the reputation and brand that Amstrad has got for making stuff that goes under TVs.\" The talk is that the firm will be able to produce a model that would sell for as little as . Such a price point would suddenly make CD-i technology a much more attractive proposition, providing it with a much needed boost, just when the market has reached its most competitive level for some time. fter the success of the Game Genie, Codemasters is planning another Mega Drive hardware coup-games with built-in multi-player adaptors. The new J*Carts, as it calls them, have an extra two joypad ports built-in to a standard sized cart, so up to four players can get to grips with a game at once. Best of all J*Cart games won't cost a penny extra, with prices starting at .99. The first release will be Tennis AllStars which is pencilled in for May. But best of all, later this year, we can look forward to Micro Machines 2, which promises to be every bit as good as its predecessor, but with the added benefit of a fourplayer mode.

While it has yet to decide what the 30 will be, the choice is immense. Philips has access to all 16 James Bond movies as well as classics such as A Fistful of Dollars, Rocky, Raging Bull and newer films like Thelma and Louise and Benny and Joon. Definitely on its way is Sharon Stone's Sliver, which Philips is gearing up to be its biggest release this year. Even though Philips has signed ever let it be said that Sega and Nintendo are above 'borrowing' ideas from each other. Currently under the development microscope is Sonic Drift, a Game Gear cart starring the spiky one himself and all the other heroes and villains from the platform games. The bad news is that Sega currently says it has no plans for a Mega Drive or Mega-CD version, but we think that it'd be such a big seller, it's almost certain to appear on the 16-bits.

"NEWS X'EYE-MENT MOUNTS AT JVC AS WONDERMEGA HITS US SATURN SETBACK ord has reached our ears that Sega's new super console, the Saturn, isn't to appear in this country until Christmas next year. However, we've also heard that the machine is due for a simultaneous world-wide launch. And, as the general opinion in Japan is that the machine is to be released early '95, someone, somewhere is telling porkies. Another rumour we've picked up on our substantial grapevine is that Sega is already working on a portable version of the Saturn, provisionally called the Jupiter. If this is true it's likely to appear 6-12 months after the Saturn machine itself. The machine has been re-christened as the X'Eye for the US, something which often happens to machines when they are launched into different parts of the world (as we know, the Mega Drive is called Genesis in the US). It retails for $499 and can play audio CDs, CD+Graphics Karaoke, Electronic Book, CD-ROM, Mega-CD and a selection of Mega Drive games. Although there has been no announcement as to when, or if, the machine will find its way into Europe, this must surely be a sign that the firm has designs on the bigger picture, and with the European video games market currently worth close to  billion it would be hard, if not foolish, to ignore it. VC's Mega Drive compatible Wondermega took a step closer to a European launch when it was announced that the machine will become available in the US in April the first time it has been on sale outside the Japanese market. GUNHED VIDEO FOR UK BRITAIN A BRITAIN A TROLL ARMY NATION OF COMPUTER SADDOS unhed, arguably one of the most successful Japanese sci-fi creations since Godzilla, is set to appear on video over here in June. Basically Gunhed's are giant super robots, similar to the Hunter Killers of the Terminator movies, only far larger and much more dangerous. The film has overtones of Aliens, with a group of futuristic troops infiltrating a deserted base, only to come under attack and be helped out by two children. The effects are decent, the action enormous and we think it's ace. If you can't wait until summer, you can check it out when it hits these cinemas: March 18-24 A recent Key Note survey has found that just 21% of British adults reckon that computers are easy to use. Meanwhile 68% think kids spend to much time using computers. Considering the average under-18 year-old has practically no trouble using the latest computer technology, maybe its time the 79% of adults who struggle with computers took a lead from the youth they accuse of spending too much time at the keyboard. ametek is changing direction somewhat following the monumental success of Frontier. It's next release will be Trolls for the SNES, a licence of those little placcy creatures with the big hair. It'll be predominantly platform-based, with some puzzle elements, which are based around you controlling one of four Trolls, each of which have different powers. If the game sells anything like as well as the trolls do, it's bound to be a massive success. Other versions are planned, and we'll bring you more news of them as, and when, we find out.

The lure of free coin-op games is enough to tempt any arcade pundit to the Arcade Trade Exhibition International, but more importantly is whether once the free play switch is flipped to pay are the punters going to be enticed back into the arcades. Certainly, this year's ATEI show has looked far more promising, mainly because it has moved to the spaciousness of Earls Court 1, and with it have come over 230 exhibitors. Even so, there seems to be very little on show to be impressed with. Sure, there's Virtua Fighters, Mortal Kombat ll and Ridge Racer (reviewed on pages 85 & 82), which are without doubt the most desirable games around at the moment, but the fact remains that most decent London arcades already had these machines before the show. So there are no big games debuting at ATEI. AIR COMBAT This time last year It was a different story last year though, especially with the exclusiveness of Virtua Racing and Streetfighter || Championship Edition. Perhaps the industry has squeezed itself dry. Too many coin-op developers are playing it safe by sticking to established game genres, and the result of this is that improvements tend to end up purely in the cosmetic department, with additional enhancements, like wide screen and digital surround sound. What the industry needs is a revolution in game design not an evolution, and that could come from something as simple as more creative programming. Virtual Reality is still a long way off from being the industry saviour some speculated it would be. The enhanced hardware route is one area where Capcom at least has plenty to shout about with its new CPSII hardware platform (see opposite), predictably shown-off with a convoy of Super Streetfighter Il machines. Two new CPSII games have also received a showing in the shape of Eco Fighters and Dungeons & Dragons. Virtua Fighter, Sega's graphical masterpiece has wowed the crowds, but the gameplay is worryingly slow and shallow. Another graphics feast from Sega, but Jurassic Park looks like a run-of-the-mill Operation Wolf clone gameplay wise. Bigger than life Art of Fighting 2 from SNK is a damn sight better than most of the sad Streetfighter II and Mortal Kombat II rip-offs that are doing the rounds at present, thanks to heaps of special moves and combos. (AOF2 on the Neo Geo is reviewed on page 64.) The best stands at the show however, belong to Namco. Its Ridge Racer setup shows three different machine configurations from the standard single screen cabinet to a life-size projected version which must be at least 20 feet wide! Air-Combat and Cyber Sled also seem to have received a lot of dealer interest plus also on show has been the familiar looking Suzuka 2. Arguably the most visually impressive graphics at the show have been at Sega's stand. The Daytona demo certainly is a real crowd puller with its startling vector-based graphics. But what has failed to impress is Sega's Jurassic Park game, which just looks like another mindless Operation Wolf clone with up-to-date graphics. Virtua Fighters has also been attracting the crowds to the Sega stands, with its awesome graphics, which look stunning on the deluxe large monitor version. Still, once the crowds actually start to play the game their interest wanes when Virtua's shallow and slow gameplay becomes apparent. We've even discovered the special moves, but believe us, these don't do much to enhance gameplay either, and are frustrating and difficult to pull off. "


"THE EASIER WAY TO BIGGER AND BETTER GAMES Capcom's CPSII hardware encloses the PCB mother board in a case which enables new games to be slotted in with ease much like a cartridge. Apart from being more economical, the hardware also provides protection against pirate PCB boards. The CPS II has communication abilities for link-ups, and with its enhanced chip-set offers a faster CPU, better image resolution and the exclusive QSound 3D audio system. The unit itself is about the size of a video player. The games shown here are a result of that technology Dungeons & Dragons is a Golden Axe type game for up to four players offering an awful lot of healthy hack-and-slash action for your money. Another of the new CPS II games. Need we say more? SAS24/4. Oh dear. Although groundbreaking at the time this Hard Drivin' style of game from Atari doesn't cut the mustard any. more. Airborne's graphics are slow and lacklustre compared to other racing games like the sexy Ridge Racer. The first Suzuka game was a deserved top seller for Namco with its brilliant handling, but this sequel is much of the same, but is good fun. Who said originality was dead? Namco obviously. Eco Fighters is a predictable shoot-'em-up with an environmental stance. Quite good fun but hardly inspired. Boxing clever The most unmissable stand at the show has to be the huge Virtuality stage though, where visitors have been playing some much improved, but still simple looking, games. Best of all being VR Boxing. So that's ATEI for 1994, and although CVG has been lucky enough to play everything on 'free play' we haven't forgotten that these games are increasingly costing too much to play. Coin-ops seem to be turning into an over priced luxury rather than an inexpensive extravagance, just look at the deluxe version of Ridge Racer with its genuine strapped-on Mazda sports car as a prime example. Essentially, novelties like sitting in a real car to play a racing game does not a good game make; especially not a long lasting one that will keep arcade addicts high on their addiction. And sadly there doesn't seem to be a new coin-op that's going to generate the income that SFII and Virtua have managed to over the last year. At the end of the show the sentiment seems to be: 'less gimmicks more gameplay'. Hyper Dunk is not a cheesy game but it's sadly lacking in the gameplay stakes compared to Midway's NBA JAM. Much the same could be said of the home conversions too. Konami's arcade products in general have been disappointing and not a patch on the many classic games they've released on console over the last year like Tiny Toons, Turtles Tournament Fighters and Rocket Knight Adventures.

"SHOW REPORT 31 04/13, 434 he ultimate arcade driving experience is what Namco and Sega are aiming for with their Ridge Racer and Daytona racing games, but can the gameplay match the impressive arcade machines and stunning graphics? RIDGE RACER NAMCO Custom hardware, top notch graphics, explosive sound. Ridge Racer is a dream for your average technophile. 38 072133 21 Certainly the highlight of an otherwise disappointing ATEI show has to be Ridge Racer, since its graphics just ram the competition off the road. Based on Namco's new System 22 3D-CG board, it's a 32bit CPU running a custom Namco texture mapping graphic engine. With awesome draw speed calculations System 22 has blessed Ridge Racer (and will no doubt bless future releases) with Gourad shading and depth cueing for every polygon on screen. There's a very realistic steering wheel with positive feedback, (none of the silly vibrating effects you usually find), six-speed manual gearbox plus clutch, accelerator and brake of course. The game comes in the usual sit down version but far more impressive is the Full-Scale system which incorporates a real Mazda MX-5 and a curved 20 foot screen, which is reminiscent of Namco's other biggie FULL SCALE machine Galaxian 3. Ridge Racer offers all the usual playing modes for beginners to experts and the game itself takes the familiar route of requiring checkpoints to be reached for the game to continue. (Turn to page 82 for the full review in Arcade Action.) 16\"SSY namco is 26 The attention to detail in Ridge Racer is stunning. As the game progresses the sky darkens to represent the march of time. You could be forgiven for thinking this was a photograph if it wasn't for the on-screen dials and information, eh? DAYTONA SEGA The only other racing game from the current crop that can match Namco's beast in the graphic stakes is Daytona. At present this game is only about 70% complete and the version we saw was simply running from videotape, so comparisons with Ridge Racer are unfair. However if Sega can get the finished game running anything like the speed we've seen it running here, and with the same breathtaking graphics, not to mention some gameplay then this could be the one to watch for. Daytona, Sega's graphically awesome racing game is shaping up to be something special. Watch out for more news soon. 18 "


"VIRTUALITY Donning his headset Rik Skews launches himself into Virtuality's latest arcade experiences The Virtuality stand at ATEl has been showing off three new gcoin-ops. These look a heck of a lot more interesting and detailed than other VR games in the arcades which is probably due to some major advancements in the hardware being used. Those ugly head-sets have also been slimmed down they're a more comfortable and compact size. The new buzz word for Virtuality at the moment though, seems to be 'immersive'. This word is supposed to convince you that virtual reality has finally reached the stage of interactivity, which it was supposed to offer at the outset. Even so, the gameplay on all machines still seems annoyingly sluggish and rather mundane; which begs the question: can the VR approach offer enough of a tease and excitement. This is particularly true with the Virtuality Boxing game. The problem with punching into air is you get no sense of impact, which makes it difficult to judge how much effort you should be putting into your punches. Anyway, the moves available are plentiful and there are some nice effects like swollen lips, bent noses and flying gumshields. Looking to lower your credibility rating? Then try wearing one of these VR helmets. Check out the realism of the hills in the background. VR games are rapidly losing their polygon look. VANY Although the graphics and The most playable game has to be speed of the new generation Zone Hunter, a futuristic commando of machines has been improved dramatically it's still type affair where you battle through a \" city in search of a genetics laboratory hard to believe you're there where you have to dispose of mutatwith a ton of plastic and glass ed life forms. This game has a very on your head. nice feel to it, and there are hefty weapons to be discovered too. What seems a bit unfair however, is that there are set time limits in the game, which could be frustrating when you're paying a lot of money for each go. The last machine we managed to climb aboard, X-Treame Strike, is a Star Wars type game where you fly across a planet surface taking out defences and other craft en route to destroying a core reactor. You're given unlimited firepower but you'll spend a lot of time searching for fuel. This game is smooth and fast with its graphics handling, but some of the terrain could be a bit more detailed, VIRTUALIT) Look at the detail on the face. Makes Virtua Fighter look pretty tragic don't you think? 19 "

FIFA Soccer. Super Soccer. Virtual Soccer. Everybody knows the names of these fine football simulations. But there's one game which shall stick in the minds of all who have played it and loved it, and it doesn't even have the word 'Soccer in the title Kick Off. Released in 1988 by a small software house called Anco which had before then made its coin from such niche products as strip poker games Kick Off became one of the biggest selling floppy titles ever seen, notching up figures of To be available on most popular formats, Kick Off 3 has been in production for over 12 months, and has been the topic of rumour for some considerable time too, the most popular piece of hearsay being that the game would never appear after the departure of Kick Off 1 & 2 programmer, Dino Dini, from Anco to Virgin. As it happens, the finished product bears almost no relation to any of Dini's previous football games, including the VIE-published unofficial Kick Off sequel, Dino Dini's Goal!. As you can see from these ouch! hot screenshots, taken from the beta test versions of the game given exclusively to CVG, Kick Off 3 has undergone some serious cosmetic surgery in comparison to its prequels. Whereas the originals were vertically scrolling, bird's-eye view affairs, Kick Off 3 is depicted in horizontally scrolling, pseudo 3D, very similar to the Manchester United games of four years back. That, however, is the only similarity between the two titles Kick Off 3 promises to be one of the biggest names in the computer football arena. hundreds of thousands. A phenomenon was born, as was a string of follow-ups Anco brought out a management game based around the Kick Off engine, followed by the now-legendary Kick Off 2 and an array of expansion disks to complement the product. Since then, Anco has jumped into bed with massive Japanese firm Imagineer who released Kick Off on SNES, NES and Game Boy, and they also sold the Kick Off licence to US Gold who promptly put out versions of the title on Mega Drive, Master System and Game Gear. Now, fresh from the successful SNES launch of Rough tackling on SNES. (SNES) Not so lucky this time, as the Argie goalie makes a relatively simple save in the six-yard area. Sliding in on the goal. ANCO Play the game A loose ball run for it! Produced by Steve Screech, who was also heavily involved in all of Anco's previous football titles, Kick Off 3 is geared for release just before the World Cup finals in July this year, and the game will have a World Cup tournament in which all the teams that actually qualified for the event will appear. Unlike other soccer games however, which usually field sides that bear no relation to their real-life counterparts, Screech has devised a system that allows the computer to play in styles very similar to those which international teams ENGLAND GERMANY-0 (Mega Drive) The KO3 crowd on Mega Drive is more advanced than its SNES counterpart, but has yet to be animated. A great stop. 23 "


"COMING SOON TO A COMPUTER NEAR YOU! Floppy disk versions of Kick Off 3 are still in the relatively early stages of development so there's nothing to show you as yet, but just so's you don't feel left out, here's a shot of Kevin Keegan's Player Manager. Converted from SNES, this fine football management game endorsed by the Keeg himself was a cracker on cartridge, and there's no reason why it shouldn't be at least as good on disk. Completion times willing, we'll be reviewing Kevin Keegan's Player Manager next month, so make sure you don't miss the May issue of CVG! A yellow card for the naughty German. (Mega Drive) And it's a goal! England walk the ball over the line, while the keeper just flaps on the floor. MD Kick Off 3 should be out at the same time as the SNES version, so Anco tells us. actually play. 'Playmakers' have been included in the sides, and these lads behave very differently to the normal, run-of-the-mill Johnny Scorer. 2 (CCT ES LIGHT A nice knock-on. ANCO UNITED MAKE VERY HEAWY WORK OF A WEAK OPPOSITION THE LATEST INTERNATIONAL SQUAD HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED Kevin Keegan's Player Manager is nearing completion on Amiga and PC look out for the reviews soon. The keeper throws out. England 1 Germany 2 When a playmaker takes possession of the ball, he won't just knock it on to the nearest player. What he does is look at the position of the boys up front and attempt to open up play by making a telling pass, with a view to a goal being scored. This is not only a revolutionary concept in itself, but these types of players aren't ten-a-penny in the real game, so don't expect Kick Off 3 sides to be jam-packed with them. England, for example, has Paul Gascoigne controlling the play from midfield, so you'll find the Kick Off 3 version of the team will have its playmaker in a similar position to that which Gazza plays in. And we know that England didn't qualify for the World Cup, but Screech says he's putting them in anyway. Germany, on the other hand, has two playmakers who, unlike England who pass the ball out to the wings, prefer instead to pass straight forward in order to break quickly. Brazil has three playmakers to accentuate their flair play, while the South Koreans, who try to play in a similar style to Brazil's but end up sorely lacking, have no playmakers. Because they're poor. 3190 Sounds smart on Jag Of the versions we've seen, the SNES game is the most complete. All the gameplay is in there, and in fact all that needs to be added is the sound, as well as a few little cosmetic tweaks such as the inclusion of an animated crowd and the like. Penalty to the Irish! We'll be bringing you a full review of the game in a very short while as it stands though, it looks like an absolute winner especially as the game is being released before EA's SNES conversion of FIFA International Soccer. On the Mega Drive front, things are moving at a fair old rate; the graphics are completed and the gameplay is similar to the SNES game, although there are a few bugs lurking around which still need to be ironed out before release. Floppy disk versions of Kick Off 3 are still in the early stages of development, but perhaps the most exciting version has to be on Atari's 64-bit monster, the Jaguar. Using a similar but souped-up engine to that used in the other versions, Kick Off 3 on Jag will feature stunning, almost photorealistic player sprites and incredible CD-quality sound effects and because of the data compression technique used on Jaguar cartridges, there should be much more in there than you'll find on the current crop of consoles. Oh yes it's also set to be the first Jaguar release from a third party software company, which is a bit of a coup in anybody's book. D BODODO 0002 An obvious freekick, there.

Anyway, Acclaim's entry into the field is this little number, programmed for them by Canadian programmers, Park Place (of John Madden/EA Hockey fame), and endorsed by the Manchester United winger, Ryan Giggs. It takes the form of a pseudoWorld Cup competition between 24 international teams, very roughly based on their real-life counterparts. So the Germans are poised for world domination, while the 'Great Britain' team (which should really be the England team) aren't really up to much the programmers obviously set Common view The game takes the scrolling grandstand view of the action, with you controlling one of your lads at a time. Slide tackles, shots and passes are all a button-press away, along with newer moves such as jinking to dodge defenders and putting on a burst of speed to outrun the defence. Naturally, there's a player radar on screen, so you can tell whether the keeper should boot the ball straight up the centre or lob it off to the wing, and there's an instant replay function which lets you run through those impressive saves and see all the frames of animation on the detailed player sprites. There's nothing very new here, but will the touch of 'The Giggster' bring football fortune to this title? We'll be taking the game out on the field for a good kickabout next month, so join us after the break. OD BD Action replays are absolutely tremendous, aren't they?

The making of a gamelights, camera, action; luvvie It's early days for 3DO, and if the software situation picks up things will be looking very rosy. As Hugh Martin, Chief Operating Officer at 3DO explains: Â«Never in history have so many companies committed to developing software for a platform in this early stage of its consumer availability.\" But then again, quantity doesn't necessarily mean quality. Watch this space. The new generation of interactive games can soak up some of the biggest budgets. Many of the games EA is working on use expensive movie production techniques, and so the company is currently investing heavily in this area. For Road Rash, EA had to bring in professional stunt directors to choreograph the crashes, which were then filmed and incorporated in the game. While in Shock Wave, actors had to be filmed against blue backgrounds, scanned into a development machine then dropped in against computer-generated backgrounds. Once you filter out the computer graphics, the FMV sections in these games work out as one long series of special effects. That kind of stuff doesn't come cheap. ffering real life in a box'. That's Electronic Arts' way of introducing the 3DO, the 'wonder' machine they're pouring so much time and money into. It started with their founder, Trip Hawkins, forming The 3DO Company in 1990; in pulling together giants in the media and electronics industry, Hawkins vision was to establish a universal hardware platform, reflecting the success of one of its partners, Matsushita, in pioneering the acceptance of VHS in the film industry. EA has over 10 years of software experience, and if they can't get it right the future's not going to look healthy for 3DO. As EA's European Marketing Manager David Wilson points out: \"There's been a lot of people misinformed about 3DO. There's no way it could have lived up to its media hype, but now it's time to get some real games out there.\" This year alone, EA is estimating to release an ambitious 35 3DO titles with its affiliated label partners. Hopefully, we'll see some top games in there, which is essential if 3DO is to compete in a market which will soon be seeing the likes of the Jaguar, Saturn and Sony PlaystationX. In fact, the Jaguar's delayed UK launch has come as good news for the 3DO. Ear to the ground, EA's David clarifies the advantage of 3DO over other consoles: \"It's likely that by the end of the year there are going to be four different 3DO machines on the market, offering choice and price preference with full compatibility with each other.\" preview JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL Software counts Four years later, and the hardware is with us in the shape of the 3DO Real Multiplayer. But software sells machines', so where are the discs? Well, there may not be much on the shelves, but the figures on paper look good. Currently there over 219 titles being developed among some 500 3DO developers worldwide. That alone should signify healthy competition and so, better standards. Yet, most people will be looking closely at what EA has to offer. Possibly the strongest sports title on the 3DO, this new version benefits from exceptional digitised graphics. There are different weather conditions to contend with which effect the play and there's lots of attention to detail; like the colour of the sky changing to indicate the state of approaching weather. In replay mode you can now take control of the cameras and zoom about or even lock on to a specific player to follow his tactics. There are will be over 100 plays to choose from and 1,300 plus player ratings. To brush up on your opponents there are over 100 video clips from the 36 NFL teams in the game, which should be enough to keep every NFL nut happy. While you play you get a useful running commentary from Madden First and last? EA accepts 3DO is the first of its kind, and when you're as successful as EA, the industry takes you seriously. The 3DO is not dead, and with rumours going round of a potential 3DO deal with Capcom, plus a big price drop, this isn't something you can write off. 28 "

"EZ -bil TripA , preview Build a ride and then climb in! FIFA This is a very, very early version of the game. So early, in fact, that it uses the player sprites from the Mega Drive version, not the neat digitised players that will appear in the finished item. Even so, it still looks blindingly good. Gameplay wise it's just like the Mega Drive version, but on the 3DO you get control the cameras too. So, you can play from any angle, zoom in and out, and actually take the perspective down between the players to get a view from behind them. Theoretically, you'll be able to follow the player with the ball as he dashes for the goal. Given this, you get an incredible sensation of space on the field, it's a bit like watching the game from the referee's viewpoint one who isn't blind though. Another nice touch is the addition of the players' shadows which actually animate and reposition depending on where your view point is. Highly realistic and the best shadow effects in any sports game to date. As could this turn out to be the best American football game anywhere, until the almost inevitable Madden's 95, of course...

"WORD UP WITH PAUL ast month it was the monopolies commission, this month it's certificates and censorship. If anything, all the recent media attention only goes to prove how large the computer industry really is. But now the issue isn't price, it's preventing you from buying games. If you've already flicked through the news section, you'll see that a set of movie-type certificates are being imposed on new games. Anyone over 18 can buy any games, but 17 and below will be split into three categories: 0-10 11-14 15-17. The worry for me is that some games might be treated unfairly. Mortal Kombat II, for instance, is pretty bloody, so can we expect to see a 15 certificate there? If so, it seems a bit pointless that home versions will be restricted while anyone can pop down to the arcades and play the real thing, blood 'n' all. At the end of the day, certificates are a good thing. Games like Voyeur on CD-i aren't really suitable for younger gamesters. However, the whole certification system is voluntary, all it takes are a few of the big companies to pull out and the whole thing falls apart. Whatever happens, you can be sure of keeping up to date with the latest news by getting your copy of the galaxy's greatest games mag every month. SPOT THE SHOT! COMPETITION Groove on people.

Because of traffic congestion in west London, top star Deniz was late in his meeting with his pop idols Right Said Fred. Although the Freds were disappointed at having to wait so long to meet De smiles all round as the Freds proudly displayed their new single (previously a big club hit) that's been remixed to tie-in with the new Sonic 3 Mega Drive game. Music whiz Deniz proclaimed it to be 'monster, a surefire hit!' and made sure he had two signed copies of the single before he left. One of these he's stored away safely while the other one is being worn out in the office where Deniz makes an effort to impress everyone in the office on a daily basis with his boogie skills.

"I REVIEW SNES by CAPCOM  Out now. Contact Machine Shack (081-769 6401) for information. A MEGA MAN Eight years down the line, and Capcom's original flagship character finally makes it to the SNES. Is this 16-bit revamp any good then? from earlier Mega Man games have been include, like acquiring the weapons and powers off each of the bosses. STAGE MAP riginally a NES game in 1987, Mega Man (or Rockman as he's known in Japan) was followed closely by eight sequels, occasionally delving into Game Boy territory too. For his SNES debut Mega Man is again offering more of his well-thought through platform action. Here in fact it spans across eight levels with some incredibly smart graphics and adventurous platform layouts, reminiscent of the coin-op classic Bionic Commandos. Elements Looks can kill So there you are with a broad selection of weapons, but unlike some games, it's not just a case of picking the best looking shooter and sticking with it for the remainder. Each weapon has its own particular use, and there's sufficient difference between what's available to make making the right selection an intricate part of the game. All your weapons are also capable of being charged up to intensify the damage they cause. You can start on any of the eight levels in this game. When you defeat a boss you get their weapons. HAVEN'T WE MET BEFORE? VERDICT Before Streetfighter had even been thought of by Capcom, Mega Man was its flagship tile. So when the first game appeared (surprisingly titled Mega Man) back in the late Eighties on the NES its phenomenal sales ensured a hefty flow of cash for future sequels and merchandise like sweets and toys. Since then there have been nine more games in fact, making it one of the longest running game sagas ever. Here's the catalogue: 1987 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 Mega Man Mega Man 2 Mega Man 3 Mega Man: Willey's Revenge Mega Man 2 Mega Man 3 Mega Man 5 Mega Man 4 Mega Man 6 MEGA MAN X NES NES NES NES GB GB NES GB NES SNES This is not just another platform shoot-'em-up. Oh no, the graphics are well structured, practical and good looking. Your power-ups are varied and you'll find weapons from one stage useful in another. Mega Man's main drawback though is lastability, which isn't helped by a password system which remembers your weapons and order of stages visited, plus you can start on any stage... These gripes aside though, Mega Man X is lavish and cunning while it lasts, and well balanced throughout. 1994 DENIZ AHMET 34 "


"SNES VERDICT PER Famicom I've nothing against platform shoot-'em-ups, but I'm more than a little disappointed with this. There aren't that many original features, especially when you compare it to Super Contra, and Gunstar Heroes on the Mega Drive. I particularly despise the way you can play any level right from the start. What's the point? There's nothing to look forward to if you can see every level at the touch of a button. I don' want to take anything away from what is a decent platformer, it's just that there's not much lasting appeal. PROS: Great graphics and well thought out levels and weapons. CONS: Fairly straightforward and lacks an incentive to carry on RIK SKEWS Shoot aliens as soon as you see them or they will suddenly charge at you, leaving you no chance to attack effectively. Some nice parallax effects and great animated sprites with detail. The problem is that Mega Man's eight levels really don't present much of a challenge. None are larger than the usual platform game length, and more to the point, most are fairly straight forward. There are tactics to be learned like going back over easier stages to recharge energy and weapons, but you can start on any level and play in a non-linear fashion, which doesn't give you an incentive to play on. Obviously, this destroys the graphical pull of the game because you can see it all at the out set A bit shallow and lightweight given the action, but not annoying. It's what you look for. Tense, dramatic and heaps of hectic fun. Never stay on a moving ramp for very long because it will run out of track. Always shoot when you jump off too, then you'll avoid dangers like this. Fresh faced Mega Man X retains your attention because it's lovingly crafted with real challenges and no silly stuff like having to re-kill baddies you've already disposed of. It's also fresh to see power-ups which can alter your approach to a level. For example, one stage may have you doing the usual awkward negotiation of platforms, but load-up in the prof's capsule and you can dash and leap through at ground level, which will allow you to avoid many dangers and collect a nice bonus from left over time units. Nicely done. Eight levels isn't a major challenge, but they're crammed full. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 101 TITUTUL ONWU ml Visually very smart, but this level is repetitive in structure, 30 @ @ @ OK 85 Never walk into a baddies with a spikey ball or this will happen.

The graphics are detailed; there's heaps of variety; lovely parallax effects; wonderful sound and the wacky tunes complement the action perfectly. Gameplay is initially strong as there's little standard platform action and lots of new ideas. Unfortunately though, first impressions wear off. The game is too easy, primarily because there's little going on onscreen.

BARKLEY ate your power by shooting a three point basket Four's more fun The game does provide full support for four player adaptors and this obviously makes it more challenging. However, the main thing in Barkley's favour is that there are no refs, so anything goes on the pitch, subsequently you can punch and kick your opponents to the ground and steal their ball. It certainly makes a change from normal hands off basketball. Playing basketball without a referee may sound like a heap of fun, but does Barkley offer sufficient scope for bad behaviour? BESES E SEEISS Left: Make it to the end and you get to play in front of a crowd. SPORT HOUSE The backgrounds are quite pleasing but the action on court is a bit dull by comparison. These fancy moves look nice, but they often seem to have a few animation frames missing. Some are also tricky to perform and it's difficult to judge their working distances.

STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES, 10 VERDICT cclaim's NBA JAM (last issue) has already set the standard for other basketball games to follow. So when something like Barkley comes along so soon afterwards to challenge it you wonder if it's a rushed job. If Barkley arrived before Acclaim's NBA JAM there would be a reason to buy it. However, it hasn't and NBA is the better game. In Barkley the animation is slower and you occasionally have to wait for the screen to scroll and show you where the ball has landed. This is clumsy, but basically the promise of a more fun game thanks to the lack of real sport rules hasn't been lived up to. Yes, it's got fancy moves like NBA, but it's difficult to get a chance to use these since your opponents are always knocking you to the ground. ONWAGOVO Shut up and tell us about the game For a start, the game is slower on the move, and the animation appears to have the odd frame missing when it comes to slamming home the ball.

It's not just a matter of waltzing along the platform, picking up the invention and nipping off to the next level, though. For some reason, these lads can't climb up on to ledges, so you have to climb on to the shoulders of your mates and use them as a ladder.

VERDICT Doug Mclure It's a simple affair, in theory. You control a tribe of cavemen who are on the road to homosapienism. It's your task to teach them how to make fire, how to throw spears, that sort of stuff. You do this by leading them through the platform-based levels (there's a surprise, eh?) to the various new inventions which can be used to complete tasks on later stages.

While fun in the short term, Humans soon becomes repetitive walk along the platform, climb on a caveman's back and grab the invention, and that's about it. If you're a puzzler fan then you might go for this game, but you'd be better off checking out Lemmings and seeing whether you can handle the fiddly controls on this format, because it is the better game.

Lillehammer 4 4 KM 1994 Olyr SE RIK 0:10:48 Here I am going for gold and remarkably there's no sign of Henry Kelly. s I write this people outside are seizing up and turning blue as snow tumbles down. To say it's cold would be like saying the Pope's religious. Add to this the fact that the Winter Olympics have started in Norway and it seems like the ideal time to check out US Gold's official tie-in. Winter Olympics offers you (and up to three friends in the Amiga version) the chance to compete against each other as well as, or with up to 15 computer opponents in the following chillsome events. YE OLDE OLYMPIC GAMES The earliest recorded date given for the first Olympics is 776BC, although historians, large brains that they are, believe the games started long before then. Staged during midsummer at Olympia, the festival became a regularly scheduled event in pre-Christian Greece. They were held in honour of Zeus, the most important God in ancient Greek mythology and all wars would cease during the contests. Like an England football match it must have been rather unexciting, as records suggest the first games consisted of just one event, a 183m foot race. competitor who has the fastest aggregate time after two runs. Last of the ski-based events is ski jumping. Two jumps are required, with points being awarded for style, technique and distance achieved. You want slow, tedious and very boring gameplay? Then try the downhill event on the Amiga. Cor, bit chilly! Biathlon's first, a combined sport of cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, it takes the form of a link event between the other games. The downhill event is based on one of the world's toughest downhill courses with the winner being whoever completes the course in the fastest time after one run. You can continue to complete the course, but no result will be given. Super-g is another alpine event and set on a shorter track than the downhill. Again the winner's decided after one run. On the giant slalom the winner is decided after two runs with the lowest overall time winning. Slalom's much the same, other than the victor is the Ooh, isn't it cold! Bobsleigh next. Expect to push your competitors to 4G as you hurtle down the course's 1,365 metres. Coming in to the home straight and we greet the luge. This is where one or two people hurtle around the track bobsleigh-style in a light toboggan (unless you've got a Game Boy 'cos it's not in that version), the winner being the person who has the best aggregate time over two runs. Lastly (for Amiga owners anyway) there's short-track speed skating, where you hurtle around an icy track with a group of similarly clad skaters. The Game Boy's last event is the strangely titled freestyle moguls where you bounce off snow mounds in an artistic way for points.  AIR 0:12. 9 138 KPH The speed and sound FX on offer in the Amiga bobsleigh event combine to make an enjoyable and highly realistic section. 46 "

With strong graphics and gameplay the biathlon is the best event on offer in the Amiga version. VERDICT GRAPHICS LAY Hmm. On the one hand this is like Epyx's classic Winter Games, which will please nostalgia heads; on the other games have come a long way in 10 years and joystick waggling affairs are not really acceptable any more. The graphics and sound are OK and all the events are playable, especially the biathlon and bobsleigh. The downhill can become boring though.

You don't get that in the Amiga game. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT Speed skating is the most difficult event to master, but it's worth persevering with as it's fast and great fun, especially with a friend. Game Boy Winter Olympics throws up no surprises either. Graphics are OK and are blur free. There's also a rather decent ski track effect left by your skier which isn't on the Amiga version. Sadly the biathlon event is nowhere near as good as the Amiga's, but events like the bobsleigh and speed skating benefit from the Game Boy's small joypad and allow for some serious speed to be built up. It's good fun and like the Amiga version this is hardly essential but I've found myself coming back for more and I suspect you will too. ONWAO Un Here's the Amiga's closing ceremony. There's an opening one too, as there is on the Game Boy, but to be honest it's rubbish on the handheld version. 75 PAUL RAND 47 "

Malthar the Mage Anyway, to cut a long story short Gildorn wasted the dragon but was banished from his own race for interfering with human There's some highly realistic sounds like bird noises to be found on this level. VERDICT I'd be lying if I said I liked arcade adventures but Darkmere goes a long way towards changing my mind. Graphically this is a treat and reminds me of Heimdall, Core's classic arcade adventure. The detail in the backgrounds creates an intense atmosphere, as does the superb music, the sound FX are a little disappointing though. There's a lot to do in this game and although it's unlikely to convert anyone to the arcade adventure genre, as the reviewing cliche goes 'if you're a fan of the genre then you'll love this'. PAUL RAND To be honest the fight sequences are a little disappointing and it can prove difficult to line yourself up with an opponent. 50 "


"VERDICT AMIGA INTROMATION The game's introduction tells the complete story behind Darkmere, a time when darkness hung over the kingdom until Gildorn banished Enywas, the evil dragon. It then goes on to tell how the darkness reappeared as Gildom got old. Now it's down to Gildor's son Ebryn to clear the evil that has spread over the land again. Is Enywas behind it once more? That's up to you to find out... Darkmere's presentation is great and similar in style to the excellent Heimdall, but more gloomy. Martin Iveson's score adds further to the game's mystical kick and thankfully the gameplay matches up to the audiovisuals. There's a double-whopping amount of stuff to explore and solve. It never becomes frustrating thanks to the decent control method and logical puzzles. Gripes? The fighting is rather hit and miss and there are few new ideas, but overall it gets a swollen OK from me. PROS: Superb attention to detail and classic gameplay.

The interface, which can make or break these games, is smoothly handled and movement is achieved by pointing to the area you wish to move to on-screen and clicking. Combat takes place by standing near a baddie, pressing fire and moving the joystick different joystick combinations give different attacks.

You simply click over the desired item and a range of options are presented to you; examine, eat, that sort of thing.

However, you soon guess that this is going to be a simple shoot-'em-up ! the moment you launch off your carrier, having done little more than crank up your speed: since when has a true flight sim made it easy for you to take off? the other limiting factor is that you're stuck with one type of aircraft, and likewise the same weapons for each mission.

You way which requires you to travel can start on anyone that you wish, through five space temples gathering but you must visit all of them to finfive items of symbolic relevance ish the game. Below are the temples which are then grouped together to in order of difficulty: complete your mission. 1 Dodge-'em-up You can start on any of the temples so there's no linear route to follow. First thing you do is fly through a 3D maze course which is a dodge-em affair. This is easily the best part of 1. TEMPLE OF HOCHMAT Kether shows that the GD-i doesn't need an FMV board to offer a decent game. But how well does it handle action without one? Apart from the linear gameplay the other problem with CD games is that your craft never seems to be part of the action. Instead it always seems more like a cardboard cut-out. 2. TEMPLE OF GEBOURAH ether is a strange game, as you would expect from a French company. It merges fancy flying sequences, which look like something out of Sega's Silpheed, with puzzle tests and maze levels. RIGHT: Is it us or does this pass more than a slight resem blance to Star Wars? 3. TEMPLE OF NETZACH BELOW: One of the many impressive scenes from the intro sequence. I wish you could hear the voice that accompanies this section. It really is tragic stuff. 4. TEMPLE OF HOD 12 Despite the impressive background scenery the bullets' graphical effects are disappointing. 5. TEMPLE OF MALKHOUT 54 "


"ILLULIIIIII VERDICT The dialogue in Kether is hilarious, unfortunately I don't think that was the intention it sounds like something out of a school play. The dodging flight sections are stomach churning, but it is still good fun in a Silpheed kind of way. Unfortunately, the other elements like puzzles and mazes spoil the game and aren't challenging enough. However, I do like the way you can start on different stages since this gives the game some depth. All in all though, it's another typical CD game with decent audiovisuals but fairly shallow gameplay. Kether plays like a cross between Microcosm and Silpheed. This tunnel sequence is very similar to Microcosm. RIK SKEWS One of the baddies. Blast him quick or you'll die! If you make it through you then have to crack a simple puzzle. It's not always clear what to do, and the clock is against you, but you can ask the computer for help if you need it. Seek and you shall find maybe Finally, you enter the labyrinth of that temple. It's here where you have to seek out five stone symbols, find the exit and receive a message about Kether which is important to your quest. If you pass all of the tests you can exit the temple and return to the galactic map, where you head for another temple to continue the quest. GRAPHICS SOUND Despite the fact that Kether runs without the FMV board there are some quality graphical touches to be found. GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT Although Kether succeeds more than most CD products, gameplay wise it's still too linear. You'd never choose the dangerous routes that the computer forces you through in this level for example. . What a strange game. There's lots of smart graphics as you'd expect, and the flying sequences are quite fun, however, these are the same each time. But what makes you laugh is the over acted Doctor Who-type voice of the computer commentator which never seems to shut-up. The puzzles you face are too easy to be challenging and the maze sections really let the game down. Why these don't scroll is beyond me, and the creatures in them are rubbish. Even so, at least it doesn't need an FMV board to run ONWAUOVO TTTTTTT the game, but it's damn hard to steer through because the control pad isn't very responsive. Try and collect green pods while you're flying as these replenish your energy, though you lose it quickly when objects bash into you. The clever bit is that you can fly anywhere and hit anything, which isn't usually the case in games like this. 75 DENIZ AHMET 55 "


"FIREVIEW .99 Out: March. Contact Philips (081-781 8251) for information. CD-i CD-i by PHILIPS by PHILIPS .99 Don Bluth presents ACE Having misjudged your move, you receive a new animated sequence showing your death. Problem is, you never know if you're doing the wrong thing until you've done it.. Visually, It's the most action packed game around. But the gameplay seems to be the complete opposite. Eh? What's a bit of a waste, is that there are more animation clips for the wrong moves than the right ones. No doubt because the game is hard. You become stronger as Ace. -ROM may be being hailed as the interactive saviour, but Space Ace is no more g interactive on CD-i than any other format it's appeared on. The prob lem you see, is inherent in its design.  As a coin-op game it was designed to turn heads and lure you into haying a go for curiosity's sake. child form at some very awkward moments. Should you miss the chance to energise, gameplay continues but you have to follow a more challenging route. Certainly, it pulled the crowds, but gameplay wise it was no winner. What you get is a story, a cartoon which unravels in scenes where you have to make well-timed predictions or it's curtains. The problem is that you never really know when you should be playing or watching. Given this, the gameplay becomes highly experimental and each puzzle is a matter of trying each of the five possible reactions on your part. Size isn't everything In Space Ace there's no choice of difficulty levels and your three lives run out drastically, plus it's frustrating with when you die at the end of a scene and have to restart. There's also a slight delay in registering your moves from pad to software which doesn't aid the interactive feel of the game, especially during those hectic flying scenes. Big boy The firebutton can be used to for shooting and to metamorphosise the wee Dexter into defender of the world Ace: a muscular handsome sod who can wrestle with creatures and perform heroic acrobatic feats, plus he's a darn good shot to boot. Just be prepared to revert to your  1993 Philips Interactive Media Intemtational Limited.  1993 Don Bluth Limited. Licensed exclusively to Superclub. VERDICT While you may have seen Space Ace on other formats, you perhaps won't have clocked it in the arcades as it first appeared in 1984. The laser disk version wowed the punters with stunning cartoon graphics, but annoyed them with almost no gameplay whatsoever. The CD-i version is the same the Digital Video cartridge shows off the visuals perfectly, but no attempt has been made to improve on the simple reaction-test gameplay. Good to show off the DV cart's capabilities, but ultimately a waste of money. Flight sequences are always tricky. Be impressed if you get it right first time. PAUL RAND 56 "


"CD-i VERDICT For what it set out to achieve, which is an accurate conversion of the coin-op, Space Ace has come out admirably. The introduction is fully engrossing and it's certainly a lot more feasible than buying a laser disc player to get to play the game in full. For the on-looker, Space Ace looks brilliant. The sound and graphics are outstanding and it all moves smoother and faster than any other CD-based game. However, nothing has been done to improve the gameplay from the coinop it originates from, and so you're left with a game that involves pushing the joystick a few times each minute. Once you've learnt the combos, the game isn't going to take more than a couple of hours to complete. A superb conversion of a dull coin-op. PROS: Stunning graphics and sound. CONS: Gameplay is non-existant DENIZ AHMET It's not always obvious what to do. However, as there are only five possibilities, try 'em till one works. GRAPHICS Awesome use of digital video and brilliant definition. Loads to see SPACED OUT Excelent synchronisation and crisp stereo sounds. Funny too. The bike is just one of the few machines our pal has to use. This fast, so harder to jusge. GAMEPLA Child's play. Shallower than a paddling pool As you probably know, Space Ace is the sequel to Dragon's Lair. When first released, Dragon's Lair was yonks ahead of the competition in terms of technology, and remains one of the few games to run off a laser disc. Predictably, it's also one the first game releases on the American LaserActive consoles. Despite the fact that Dragon's Lair and Space Ace presented an identical gameplay interface, and got criticised for it, creator Don Bluth went on to produce yet another coin-op to follow on from Space Ace. Entitled Super Don Quixote, punters finally received a more real and playable game with more options and paths open for progression. Unfortunately, few arcades invested in the final instalment and so Super Don Quixote remains something of a best kept secret. How about digging it up, Philips? There's no game here, but it's a good conversion; hence, some marks. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 MONWOOD IIIIIIIIIII MISS OK! HIT 57 "

Can you stop the brutal terminator rampage? TARGET. ID Time to kill Rampage is the sequel to the old flick-scrolling shoot-'em-up Terminator 2029 and the plot is as tangled and tortuous as the movie.

However, just as it exploded Skynet cleverly launched a modiTONS OF TERMINATORS TO Even the top-of-the-range Terminators are no match for an Uzi 9mm and some gritty determination. Look what those machines did! Not only do they hate mankind but they hate flowers and bunny rabbits too. amage, mindless violence and big guns have always been good ingredients for a computer game and with Doom currently the hottest, bloodiest slaughter-fest on the PC, Bethesda has come up with Terminator Rampage, a smoothly scrolling 3D shoot-'em-up with violence, robotic death machines and loud explosions in generous abundance So, you're a Terminator fan huh? You want to save mankind and battle indestructible robots against overwhelming odds with little more than a peashooter? Well you got it. Apart from Terminator Rampage here and the original Terminator 2029, the Terminator nuts among you can also get your future-fix from Virgin's T2, a faithful coin-op conversion that has everything bar the cabinet-mounted Uzis.

You have been sent back in time to stop the Meta Node interfacing with the Cyberdyne computers and to save the future of mankind. Got all that? Good. Let's move on. "


"VERDICT Rampage is a highly atmospheric game the 3D graphics technology and the sound are pretty darned good. Sadly, however, the gameplay is a bit dull and if you're a Doom fan like me, you may find the whole thing a bit too slow. Although Rampage can certainly be fast and furious, there isn't enough ammo' dotted around to make staying and slugging it out a really viable option. But despite this, Terminator Rampage grew on me in a big way. It's an awesome challenge and will take you a hell of a long time to beat. PROS: Superb, speedy graphics and very tough to beat CONS: It's been done before, and better, by Doom. GARY LORD Morality? Pah! GRAPHICS Superb 3D routines but still not a patch on Doom. Using a variety of weapons including your humble handgun, the M-16, the Uzi and a rather impressive minigun, you must prowl the corridors of the Cyberdyne Labs searching for 16 gun pieces that will enable you to construct a huge ultra cannon and thus destroy the Meta Node. Yes, what it all boils down to is three main things: walk along dark, moodily lit corridors; shoot robots and search rooms; and finally construct the gun, destroy the Meta Node, torch the building and escape heroically through the nearest window. Simple really The Terminator theme tune pounds away and the guns go bang. SE PISINE GAMEPL It's involving but sometimes there aren't enough enemies. It's a very difficult game which won't disappoint Terminator fans. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES If you grab hold of the minigun you can cause A1 havoc. On the later levels you need it, believe you me. 45 LOL.ESLIDE  Check out the superb 3D Gouraud, er, light-source shaded corridors. WIMMITT VERDICT ONWA MSS OKHIR Rampage is one of the toughest games I've played in a long time. OK I admit it, I'm a Terminator fan, but Rampage is not only damned difficult it's beautifully presented with great music and light-sourced, texture-mapped corridors that are incredibly detailed. You really must have a top-notch 486 machine for this one, and if you want to get the whole experience try playing it in the dark with the sound cranked up. It's not a Doom beater, but it's a much harder game and I think you'll have a lot of fun with it. Eat lead and die If you're familiar with Doom, Wolfenstein or even Ultima Underworld you'll have an idea of how Terminator Rampage moves. It's silky smooth and highly atmospheric; the corridors are eerily empty and the Terminator 2 theme tune plays along in the background. If you ever get bored with Doom (!) or if you're just a rampant Terminator fan, Terminator Rampage is a challenging shoot-'em-up and, apart from Doom, it must be the most atmospheric 3D game around.

BLOODNETE Watual succumb to your greatest enemy math. IT'S CYBER BloodNet draws its inspiration from cyberpunk. Pioneered by William Gibson in his novel Neuromancer, cyberpunk is a place where chaos, poverty and disease are rampant and street gangs prowl the street. All information and business is carried out electronically in a computer generated world known as 'Cyberspace' and hackers use sophisticated equipment to break in and steal it. If you fail to cure Stark, or get killed by a street punk, you'll end up looking like this. You're still attractive but only to other vampires. The world of Cyberspace is a gateway to information, confacts and most importantly al vital source of clues. he future is going to be bleak. Take New York in 2094: society has collapsed and street gangs, computer hacking and drug abuse is rife no change there then. In the midst of this urban nightmare wanders Ransom Stark, a one-time computer hacker with a brain disease brought on by too much time spent in virtual reality. you can only visit a limited number of locations, but as you piece together the complex plot, new ones will present themselves. Your quest won't just take you around Manhattan either; Stark can also access or 'jack into Cyberspace, a computerised world of VR. Oh and there's combat here too, both in the real world and the cyberspatial one, along with puzzles, sub-plots and red herrings. It's like Blade Runner right? No, it isn't quite like Blade Runner, but if you've seen the movie you'll have an idea of how BloodNet looks and feels. There's a whole world to explore and somewhere in the middle is the cure for Stark's vampirism. But be warned, to stave off the disease you'll have to feed on human blood. This ain't nice so if you've got any concrete morals put them back in the cupboard next to your copy of Syndicate. BloodNet is brutal. Someone doesn't like Stark and he's started telling him by leaving messages in er, blood. Vampires & GRAPHICS ANNOS With the aid of a brain implant Stark can live a normal life, but he is being stalked by Van Helsing, an undead vampire lord.

BloodNet is stunning. With its dark, oppressive mood, combat, puzzles and cyberspace sequences, it's one hell of a challenge. But it must be said that this game isn't going to appeal to everyone. Remember it's more of an RPG detective game than a graphic adventure, and at times it's so weird and complex I just haven't a clue as to what is going on. But hey, if you fancy a challenge and you don't mind a bit of gratuitous killing and bad taste, then pop out and buy BloodNet. It's simply superb.

CAMEPLAY 69 STRATEGY SKILL ACTION ou'd think that the Pink Panther would be an ideal culprit for a game, especially for a character who doesn't need to talk but relies on visuals gags to cause a chuckle. Looking at it like that, Pink certainly makes his mark in this 14 level spoof of Hollywood movies. Titles like Honey I shrunk the Pink, Pinkin Hood and Pink Beard, all provide familiar environments for our friend to get through. While offering nothing in terms of platform originality, Pink somehow manages to capture the feel of his character precisely. The first thing you notice is the rather large and brilliantly done panther himself. Even that expressionless, casual stroll has been perfectly animated. That alone doesn't make the game, but Pink can sprint and spray his limitless supply of Pink paint at the few infesting creatures that are on each level, or sling a movie prop from a safe distance. If all that fails you can always jump on their head (yawn). REFLEXES There are secret platforms to be found everywhere. VERDICT Good structure in a platform game is vital, and what's also important is that there's plenty to do. Pink scores on the former but not on the latter. And if that doesn't annoy you the suspect sprite detection will, or the fact that there's no restart points. It is easy progress through though because the baddies are always in the same place and lack any sort of intelligence, which is unforgivable. The only saving grace for Pink Goes To Hollywood is that it is actually a quite funny game, but gamers can't live by humorous platformers alone.

Does it really matter if it's as good as this?  low he original Art Of Fighting was one of the most popular Neo Geo carts ever, so SNK has really pulled out the stops for the sequel. And it shows. The initial spec is one of the most impressive yet for a beat-'emup on this system. With 12 characters, each featuring at least three special moves, full camera-style zooming when the fighters get in close and new backdrops, AOF2 clocks in at an incredible 130 plus megs! plenty of fireballs and near-dragon punches, but this is offset with lethal rapid fire punches and kicks, the likes of which have never been seen in a combat game before. Some of the joystick combinations for the special moves haven't appeared in combat games before, so it takes hours of practice just to master just one character.

Apart from the stunning graphics and excellent action it's also very, very difficult. Fighting your way through the last four characters takes nerves of steel and the kind of reflexes you get from drinking coffee by the bucket load.

"VERDICT NEO GEO NEOGEO NIO SNK It sounds strange talking about a game which, to all intents and purposes, is actually better than Streetfighter II. Art Of Fighting 2 has everything in its favour, amazing graphics, stunning special moves and a difficulty level that's enough to stump most beat-'em-up fans. The story element makes the single-player game almost as playable as the two-player mode. What more needs to be said, other than I hope we get some good conversions soon. JACKANORY A particularly original feature of the one-player is that it actually follows a storyline. The characters are still thrown at you in a random order, but as the game unfolds you find out more about Mr Big's evil empire and that there might be a thirteenth fighter lying in wait for you. As you progress your character also learns super-powerful special moves, which are essential since the game is incredibly difficult from the seventh round onwards. PROS: Easily the best beat-'em-up around. It's got the lot. CONS: It's only on Neo Geo and coin-ops, so not everyone will get to play it GARY LORD Loads of excellent animation and smooth scaling. GRAPHICS : MOVBE SHOULD HAVE BECOME TEACHER. GETTINO BORED The power of the special moves depends on how powered-up the character's rage gauge is. the downside, though, is that you can't block while psyching. Battles are settled mainly with special moves, this means the battles tend to last a lot longer, so if you're playing the game in the arcades you get good value for money. Like the first game, the screen zooms in when the fighters come together, although this time the effect's a lot faster a smoother, so it doesn't detract from the action as it did before. Decent soundtrack, but excellent, over-the-top effects. The excellent Manga-style graphics make for some of the best visuals seen in any coin-op. Who needs polygons when you've got sprites like these? Simply the best Neo Geo beat-'emup that you will ever see. Probably. A bizarre multiple hit which does vast amounts of damage. A bit pricey as Neo Geo games go. THE CHALLENGERS Art Of Fighting 2 now boasts 12 characters, including the original heroes and villains.

VERDICT onsidering that there's little cen sorship of software on the PC it's strange that a decent beat-'emup has yet to arrive on that format.

EXCELLEH 100,000 Streetffighter Il on PC raised questions about the machine's ability to handle heavy action games. Kombat on a 33mhz 486 PC though, is faster than on the SNES, and it is more than a match for the coin-op if you have Local Bus graphics too. Unlike other conversions, the difficulty level is much harder here and you can't get away with using one move to beat everyone. Admittedly, it's a bit unresponsive at times and fiddly to play with the keys, but it will support two-button joysticks. A fan tastic conversion for a PC.

The gameplay has been carried over well too, as coin-op tactics are fully useable. The best thing about the PC version however, is that it has corrected the problem found in all the other conversions one character being able to beat the others by using just one move. DENIZ AHMET Intelligentsia Here your opponents fight a more intelligent fight, so it becomes more playable as you progress and it's even equal to the coin-op on the hardest setting. Graphically, MK is excellent for a PC action game. Some magazines have criticised the game because it slows down in Local Bus graphics mode.

CLAY TIME There are eight different and unique characters to play with or against in Clayfighter. So what can they do exactly? The blob character has som However, it takes a while tog when you play, it all comes together well. Point of view Each character has a range of special moves which gives the game those vital combo possibilities. The controls are the same as Streetfighter BAD MR FROSTY: Not very agile, but Frosty can launch a hefty barrage of snowballs at opponents. Strong, but has limited reach. BANG! TAFFY LIKES = SHEETS ou'll no doubt remember the Electricity Board's 'Creature Comforts' commercials, with those Aardman created plasticine bears, turtles, parrots, cats and dogs. Yeah? Now, although being animals, they had human like characteristics which made them both funny and believable. So why am I telling you this? Basically, because Clayfighter has very much the same appeal with its pliable characters. Clayfighter takes the mickey out of beat-'em-ups with its comedy violence. The eight characters you can select for combat cover the most unlikely and mismatched range you could possibly think of. Yet, HH cu Ac Oz D. o HUSZZ HELGA: She's a hefty lass and tends to scream in your ear, which is not a pleasant sensory experience. Occasionally, she'll lunge towards you; mind that helmet! L-AZH LUNCH ZO A very nice character selection screet very different at first, but in play, the ICKYBOD CLAY: Pumpkin head blasts you with bits of his soggy head. His arms have an unpredictable reach and may even try to hug you to death. Worst of the lot. 72 THE BLOB: Blob can morph into a boot, fist, or hammer and he spits gunge too. When angry will swallow his opponent or chop them in half. Our favourite. TAFFY: A piece of candy who looks like a rubber band. As such, Taffy has a long reach and can wind himself up to spin across the screen. Fast, unpredictable but a bit weak. TINY: This guy is actually huge, and while limited to an unspectacular dashing punch, spin, and belly splat he's strong and durable, so he's a good all-rounder. "


"VERDICT Clayfighter tries to impress, but it's a bit clumsy, which is mainly due to some iffy sprite detection. Essentially, the game doesn't feel right since everyone moves with suspect momentum, and Tiny is stronger than anyone else. On 'easy' you can clock the game in about 15 minutes without a single death, while 'hard' is like level six on Streetfighter II. Also, there are more stages than challengers so you have to fight some characters more than once. Even so, Clayfighter is very funny and enjoyable, just not spectacular. This is the fighting map. Each character has their own place, and here you see the last lot. DENIZ AHMET VERDICT me wonderful morphing abilities. to get used to his striking distances. moves, and each character doesn't necessarily do the same thing with each key. A hard kick by Blob for instance would be a leg sweep by Mr Frosty, so there's quite a lot of player tactics to learn, which increase the game's lastability. Unfortunately, when it comes to the interaction between opponents, something isn't This game has been attracting interest for ages on import mainly because of its graphics. Indeed the backdrops are great, but it's the sprites that grab your attention. I don't think I've seen anything quite as well digitised as is on offer here. Sound is equally excellent, with crazy FX and some excellent vocal effects. The game itself comes as something of a let down. The moves are Streetfighter rip offs, but you don't have much of a feeling of contact and the game is too easy in one player mode. It's fun, but a bit of a disappointment. RIK SKEWS Grabbing opponents is a difficult act to perform, but it drains their energy quickly. GRAPHICS 92 COMPUTE quite right. Unlike Streetfighter II, opponents in Clayfighter don't often react intelligently, and this means you can get away with the unforgivable tactic of relying on one move to kill everyone. On harder settings, all opponents seem to do is block more often so the problem still exists. In two-player mode Clayfighter is a strong product and players can handicap each other for added lastability. Streetfighter II it's not, but Clayfighter has tried to offer something different to the genre and Special moves use Streetfighter type controls, so it's easy to get the hang of. on that has to be a good thing.

Shouts things like 'Wowa momma' to make you laugh while his telescopic hair stabs you senseless. Silly, but a tough opponent.

Take Jaki Crush, hidden extras all over the place. SNES Dreams, though, skimps on table quality by going for quantity, and it doesn't work. The tables are basic, and the ball doesn't move well at times. If you're a pinball fan who can't find Jaki Crush, Dreams will keep you occupied, but it's a game which could have been a whole lot better if the programmers hadn't stuck so rigidly to the Amiga original.

"GAME GEAR by CODE MASTERS .99 Out In March. Contact Code Masters (0926 814132) for information. Beware the typical Englishman's deadly flying brief case. Hey, Egypt! You can tell it's Egypt because the screen is full of pyramids and mummies. CJ runs into this speedy soldier boss at the end of the England zone. Three easy bombs finish him off. CJ. ELEPHANT FUGITINE Who can she be, this dusky maiden of The Mysterious East? Falling from great heights presents no problems to our trunky pal, who comes fully equipped with his rainbow-striped umbrella-parachute. Cute Jumbo comes jumping, cavorting, comically jiving... er, that's enough C and J words. Let's just get on with the review... R GRAPHICS QNNOS ETTRAPERICE Loxodonata Africana Fortunately, CJ is able to protect himself by blowing peanut projectiles out of his trunk, a couple of shots being enough to cause foes to explode into a pile of bonus-points fruit. Better still, the diminutive oos, yeah? They're, like, a bad thing, because it's just not natural to capture wild animals and keep them locked up in cages for people to gawp at. Well, if you think so, Columbus Jumbo the baby elephant would certainly agree with you. There he was, locked up in a zoo in rainy, snowy, windy England and homesick for the savannahs of Africa. Enough was enough, and disguised in a stolen baseball jacket (XL size of course) CJ has made his bid for freedom. GAMEPLAY VALUE Snails? The Eiffel Tower? But of course it's Paris! Loxodonta Africana also carries a bag full of bouncing bombs which are even more effective when it comes to dynamiting the enemies of elephantkind out of the way. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES! 5 VERDICT There's hardly any originality on display here, but what really crocks CJ: Elephant Fugitive are annoying features like his peanut-firing ability, which isn't worth spit, because he shoots a quarter second after you've pressed the fire button. Also, the fact that the baddies sometimes take three hits to kill and other times one is confusing. Surprise deaths are common, which is presumably why the programmers give you nine lives to play with, but I'm afraid they just prolong the agony. Bring back Micro Machines. ONWAGON TITUTIIL Cosmopolitan elephant Lacking an air ticket, CJ has to walk (and jump) from London, through France, across the Alps, south to Rome, then across the Mediterranean and down through Egypt, before finally reaching his herd in Kenya. That works out to 18 levels of platform-type action, throughout which CJ is beset by elephant-hating armies of pigeons, rats, the Mafia, yodelling girls, mummies and witch doctors. 55 GARY LORD "


"ARCADE ACTION RIDGE RACER You'll never make it with only one second to go. 02/02 BY NAMCO RACING 1 PLAYER  PER PLAY e RIDGE namco TRIDGEBAC You've heard all hose with their heads stuck in the sand for the past six months will know little about Ridge Racer, the arcade machine sporting revolutionary graphics and a top-ofthe-range car: yes it's an actual Mazda MX5 sports car which you sit in and drive! That's the version we've been playing, costing a whacking  a time! Yes it's expensive, we know, but when you take into account that the machine costs â€” wait for it ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND talk. You've perhaps seen a couple of screenshots. You might even have read a bit of blurb by some one who looked at the machines for 20 seconds. But CVG, as usual, was the magazine invited to spend a whole afternoon playing not only Sega's sequel to Virtua Racing (see page 86) but also the only full-size Ridge Racer coin-op in the country, before it was even opened to the public! namco namco Here's the course layout for Ridge Racer. Actually, this is split into three to cater for all the different tracks. "

Slow down on the tight corners, otherwise you'll run the car right into the crash barrier. Here it is the only full-size Ridge Racer coin-op currently in Great Britain, seen here being put through its paces by CVG Ed Paul Rand at its test site at Fun Land in London's Trocadero. Costing a thumping ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS, this version POUNDS then you can imagine how long it would take to recoup that kind of cash were it 50 pence a throw. There are four levels to tackle in Ridge Racer Novice, Advance, Expert and Time Trial and two different courses to drive on: which one you attempt depends upon the level you select. While the first three levels are difficulty settings basically trickier-to-pass cars and the like the Time Trial option puts you on the open road and lets you thrash round the course, attempting to beat the current fastest finishing time. smoothly as you could imagine, and the cars and roadside objects are equally stunning they don't look quite as real as some would have you believe, but they're not far off. Sound, too, is brilliant, and because you're enclosed in what is almost a big box with a car inside, the noises resonate around you as opposed to blasting out past your ears, making for an infinitely more 24 12 realistic experience CONGA of the machine incorporates a real Mazda MX5 sports car, which is wired to the projection screen and which you 'drive', using all the actual features of a real caraccelerator, brake, clutch even the radio and the various dials work! For the price Namco is Real Racing By using System 22 graphics technology Namco has managed to make the courses highly detailed. They scroll as charging, you expect something a bit special and you aren't disappointed. The huge screen fills the whole windscreen, arcing round so that, wherever you look, you can see what's going on around you. An amazing machine. 2 10/1967 Graphics the likes of which you've never seen are what make Ridge Racer so unique. VERDICT GRAPHICS There's nothing like a quiet drive by the seaside. And this is nothing like it. PC 50 13/365 SOUND 05 Ridge Racer is far and away the most realistic arcade game ever seen, but it does have its drawbacks, and they do take the shine off what is otherwise a superb (if expensive, ride. The screen can be relatively devoid of cars at times and the sensation of speed really isn't there when you're blasting along at 160km/h, although when you enter into a sideways skid it really does feel as if you could total that expensive car if you're not careful. Plus the car seems to lack any hydraulics. Still, this is an experience which everyone should try at least once, if only to get a look at those gorgeous graphics and sit in the Mazda!

"MEGA DRIVE HSAT SHINOBI 3 MEGA DRIVE ZOOL A game that's starting to creak gently, but it's still good enough despite its age. If you want INFINITE SHURIKENS, go to the options screen and set the number of shurikens to 00. Whistle for a bit and an infinity symbol will appear. Play the game and huzzah, infinite shurikens are yours my friend. Now for a cheat that could have been thought up by staff writer Rik who, it must be said, does like his game music. Play each of the songs on the sound test in the correct order, and you should find old Joe-ninja boy completely invincible. Blimey, I wish I'd thought up the idea of this ant, sorry I mean ninja, from the Nth dimension, but as Nirvana once said, 'Oh well, Nevermind'. Anyway this list of cheats will make all you Zoolies happier people, believe me. When punching in these cheats hold down the START button while you press the following combinations: D, U, L, L, A, R, D: Extra life SNES SNES C, R, A, B, B, A, L, L, A, D: Level select. Release start and the first two numbers are alterable. Change them to alter the world and level numbers. Once you've selected a level hit A, B and C together. The game should abort. Restart the game and you should find yourself on the level that you selected. SUPER EMPIRE STRIKES BACK WING COMMANDER: THE SECRET MISSIONS R, A, D, A, R, B, L, U, R: Rewards you with 240 energy points (although you'll only be able to see three). This will also set the timer to 999. That's all folks. SNES HPSE THE LAWNMOWER MAN This game is a fine tribute to the film. It can prove a trifle sherry difficult at times though. To swing the odds in your favour try this sassy little cheat. While playing the game press and hold Y, B, X, A and DOWN. Keep holding them and press START to access a sound test screen. Press START again to return to the game and then do all the above once again. If you've done this correctly then you should notice that the message under the sound test words has changed. Now, by entering Y, Y, Y and Y on the title screen you'll be able to rotate the Empire logo by pressing the Land R buttons. A much more useful cheat though, is achieved by holding X, Y, A, B and X on the title screen. This will give you seven credits. Oh, by the way, tum the machine off and on to get these cheats to work. Going against tradition of tuming good films into mediocre games those talented perkins at the Sales Curve produced an excellent game out of a mediocre film. Anyway enough of this idle banter. To access the cheat mode, start the game, pause it, and type B, R, A, SELECT, SELECT, Y, A, B, Y, A and B. Then simply unpause the game. To access the cheat menu screen, PAUSE the game again, and type A, L, L. Unpause the game and you should now be presented with the menu screen. For infinite lives, PAUSE the game and type R, A SELECT and y. Unpause the game and you should now find that you'll be invincible. To skip through a Virtual World, PAUSE the game while inside it and press A. Unpause and if everything's fine and dandy you should find yourself whisked to the exit. SCORES SABE This conversion is a bit of a sad attempt at emulating the legendary PC original, but that's by the by. Anyway if you've bought the game here's a cheat that should allow you to access a hidden options screen. Press L, R, SELECT and START on controller two. If everything's worked the music should drift away into nothingness and in its place you should be presented with the aforementioned options screen which allows you to become invincible, choose missions and fiddle with the sound. 92 "


"AMIGA WE NEED YOUR CUES AND 'EHs Yes, we do because next month we're starting a special Q&A (that's questions and answers for the acronymally challenged) section, which is going to be divided into two. Q&A (Games) will help you if you're stuck in a game or if you're after a particular cheat, whereas Q&A (General) will throw light on any technical posers you have or if you want to know what the best shoot-'em-up is on the SNES is. So send those quezzies in now! ELITE 2: FRONTIER MEGA-CD MEGA DRIVE SONIC CD CHUCK ROCK 2 Bit of a learner in Elite 2 huh? Well here's a tip that should make you Elitist. Start trading and saving your money until you can afford a passenger cabin. Pick up some people and go to the BUY and SELL section and take a gander at the new and used ships. Keep looking until you find a ship with a minus figure in the part-exchange column and attempt to sell your ship by pressing 'buy'. A message will inform you that you can't sell a ship with people on board, but you'll still be given the trade-in value. Then simply set your firebutton to 'auto', repeat the process and you'll have enough cash to pay Gillian Taylforth's legal bills! Here's that long sought after level select that loads of you have been phoning up enquiring about recently. On the title screen simply press UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, B and START. Have fun! The original Chuck Rock game did a heck of a lot to zoom Core into the big time and this decent sequel will no doubt do very well too. To advance a level pause the game and press B, A, RIGHT, A, C, UP, DOWN and A. Restart the game, pause it again and PRESS A and RIGHT to advance a level, or A and UP to skip the zone entirely. SNES SNES TURTLES TOURNAMENT FIGHTERS Despite having the pick of the games industry's finest in front of us all day, every day, there's some carts that we just can't help going back to, and Turtles Tournament Fighters certainly is one of them. It also fits into the 'hmm, it's all a bit Streetfightery isn't it?' department too. And not only that but Konami has also included a turbo speed option just in case you were thinking of buy ing SFIl instead! MEGA DRIVE On the title screen use the second control pad and press UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A. You should hear an aggressive cry and find that there's now a third speed setting on the option screen. MICRO MACHINES A big slap on the back is I think due to Codemasters for proving that you don't need decent graphics to sell a game, just decent gameplay. To make the game even more excellent however, why not try these crazy cheats while playing the game: MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE GOLDEN AXE 3 Press UP, DOWN, A, B, LEFT, RIGHT, C and START to speed up your car. RANGER-X Press A, UP, B, DOWN, C, LEFT, START, and RIGHT to increase your car's traction. Press LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, START and DOWN to make your opponents really tough. Finally, press C, UP, LEFT, RIGHT, A, B, A and C to dish out mega damage to opponents when you crash into them. Good graphics for sure, but I thought this one was overrated. Still, if you liked it and are looking for extra levels then you've come to the right place squire. Now not a lot of people know this but there's a level select on this game. EIS Go to the options screen and press A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B and lastly C. Select EASY level, start the game and hey nonny nonny, a new area is all yours. Simply go to the character selection screen and place the cursor over your character then press A four times, START and then C six times. Easy when you know how. DURNAME SINGLE RACE 93 "

Skeleton Krew, as you can see from these screenshots, looks very impressive indeed, with big, meaty sprites and highly detailed backdrops, and it's the sort of gun fest shoot-'emup that'll keep you up until the wee small hours while you waste a few more mutant mothers, if the version we've played is anything to go by.

"Olde worlde of objects to pick up and use, and a full cast of characters to talk to and glean information from. This is a simple yet useful excuse for giving this vertically scrolling shoot'em-up a look similar to the Victoriana used in The Chaos Engine. You (and a friend, if you desire) take to the skies in your Banshee fighter plane and blast your way through six levels of adrenaline-pumping action, taking on nuclear submarines, huge aircraft carriers and, of course, an array of airbome adversaries. There are the usual icons to collect which will give you power-ups such as special weapons, fuel and extra lives, and there's a big boss baddy at the end of each stage to take on. DARKSTONE AMIGA CORE ETBA Zelda-style RPG is coming to the Amiga! PREVIEW urrently one of the busiest software houses around, Core has over a dozen different titles in production at the moment. Darkstone is just one of them and it's a role-playing game in the Zelda mould, in which you play the part of either Aelphric or Freydian in a quest to find the Crystals of the Bright Trinity in order to rid Midworld of the scourge of Myrdir, the Great Dragon. It's a big 'un At present there are four huge levels planned, but when we spoke to the programmers of the game at their Derby headquarters, they were pondering over whether to include a fifth stage, which would be set on a giant ship that takes you over to the dragons' base. This kind of adventure game is usually guaranteed to have players burning the midnight oil for some considerable period of time just ask SNES-owning Zelda fans and by the look of things, that should be true of Dark Stone. We'll be keeping a watchful eye on its progress, and reviewing it in the near future. The skull and crossbones insignia indicates that this gunboat docking yard isn't on the friendly side. 144042 BANSHEE A1200 ONLY  CORE  ETBA A reworking of an old arcade favourite, courtesy of Core n this reworking of the 1942 coinop formula, the world has evolved differently to that which we know. The two World Wars never happened and technology has been slow to appear; indeed, people still sit and stare at black-and-white TVs. That's until Blardax Maldrear, leader of the Styx Republic, decided to take over Earth and, in the space of five years, devised an assortment of frighteningly powerful war machines. And invented colour telly. Sauted soldiers With 1994 shaping up to be a year of blasters, Banshee looks perfectly placed to take its share of the spoils. Graphically it's great, with touches such as fog effects that make your enemies more difficult to spot adding to the already excellent stylised visuals. Worth a special mention are the patrolling soldiers who die in various different ways our favourite has to be when they catch fire they run around frantically, engulfed in a ball of flame. Looking something of a winner, check out the review in CVG soon. Inside one of the houses, this old crone could well be stirring up trouble for you. Adventuring ahoy you get the general idea. Dragon Stone is in the relatively early stages of development, but Core hopes to have the game ready in time for a June release. Travel through forests, towns and cavems, hunting for the crystals which, when joined together, will banish the dragons from Midworld and allow you to live in peace and harmony. There's a variety Step into my parlour, said the spider to the bloke with the rather large sword. The effect of the submarines rising from under the ocean is particularly impressive.

But this isn't destined to be the usual platform type of thing, instead Hotel Mario is going to have a puzzle-based theme. What's apparently happened you see, is that Bowser has gained control of all the hotels in Mushroom Kingdom and kidnapped Yoshi. Controlling Mario, you'll rush around each hotel front closing all the doors to complete the stage.

As you dash around the 85 stages you can collect coins for extra points, or discover secret shortcuts. Also, Hotel Mario isn't going to require an FMV cartridge to play its animation sequences and well produced music and effects. Although childishly simple, Hotel Mario seems quite addictive, although it could well turn out to be a bit on the repetitive side. You'll just have to wait for the review to find out. Test of time The key element of the game will be timing. Some baddies move fast, some slow, while others go round opening the doors you've just closed.

Who knows where you'll find yourself in Ishar 3. It's just a nutty kind of game. Stage of Development 75% Completed Dragons, dungeons, an evil wizard called Shandar. The latest instalment in Silmarils' Ishar trilogy has it all ooks pretty, this, doesn't it? It's Ishar 3, which will be entering the 3D role-playing game fray some time this spring, going toe-totoe in a savage, swords-and-sorcery, blood-and-snot battle with the likes of Ultima Underworld. Let me take you back... Appropriately, the story follows on from Ishar 2, which, as you no doubt remember, culminated in the destruction of Shandar, an evil wizard who He even Gates was making trouble on the planet of Ishar. Well, Shandar's back, or at least his soul is, and it's looking for a new body to infest so that it can resume its quest for Ishar domination. Trouble is, he wants to return in the body of Wohratax, the last survivor of the Black Dragon race who, apart from being immortal, is also the single hardest creature roaming the world of Ishar with excellent fighting abilities as well as magic. Which explains why Shandar's after him. There's still time to stop Shandar before he takes the dragon's form. The only way to do it, though, is to travel through monster-packed scenery looking for time gates which take you and your gang of mystical mercenaries back in time to kill Wohratax before the start of these shenanigans. 100 characters, all with different abilities and personalities. The game uses a 3D viewing window (which flicks like Eye of the Beholder's rather than scrolling) to display indoor and outdoor locations, and as in Ishar 2, you get day and night-time lighting effects. It also features animated film sequences and real-time fights always preferable to those dull, old, combat-by-rounds systems. It certainly sounds good, but with so many similar RPGs knocking around and good ones they are too we can't help but wonder whether all these features will be enough to lure us away from the likes of Underworld. We'll find out, as will you, next month when we get our hands on a review copy. Ad. BA BA BA BA.

"MEGA DRIVE es, this is a game based on The Nutty Boys (as they were known circa 1984) who made themselves famous with the likes of House of Fun, Baggy Trousers, It Must Be Love, Night Boat to Cairo and One Step Beyond, to name just a few of their classic tracks. Let's hope that this is not the slippery slope, though, to less reputable bands signing up games licences, ie Bad Boys Inc the videogame! by GREMLIN TBA PREVIEW The reflections on this tower are a graphical feast I can tell you. OUT TBA Stage of Development 65% Complete Here's one of the typical guardians you can expect to come across. They're not exactly difficult to beat. Watch out for this baddie, 'cos he won't stay in the bubble long! My name is Michael Caine Madness House of Fun stars a character called Mr Smash (who is based on Carl from the group), and is another platformer with the key feature being a large selection of the tunes which are supplied by Suggs and Co. There are 14 levels, each with its own set of enemies, puzzles, powerups and hidden rooms, played out against what are shaping up to be some decent looking backdrops. A clue system has been woven into the game to hopefully prevent novices getting frustrated by not being able to progress through the game. HOUSE OF FUN Some of the later level graphics are particularly well detailed. Night Boat to Cairo Game veterans will recall this game is based on an old Amiga platformer called Harlequin. Despite being a decent game at the time, it didn't sell well. The game on offer here is essentially Harlequin with Madness based sprites. Keep an eye out sometime around the middle of the year to see whether the game reveals its age or not. Can the Harlequin game return with the same vengeance that Madness managed to a couple of years back? SEGA Not exactly a subtle piece of sponsorship, eh readers?! You'll need to discover a nearby pick-up to breathe in the water. Like Cool Spot, some of the points are invisible. Make sure you run everywhere to gather them all. 103 "

Throw the roll at the rat and it'll pull the lever, releasing you from jail. Into the Hall of World fleste If you can solve an earlier puzzle then one of these chaps isn't as dead as he appears. CVG manages to avoid any 'Core blimey' intros as it takes a peek at the impressive looking sequel to Heimdall Simply walk over objects to add them to your inventory. fter the enthusiastic welcome the original Heimdall received by journalists and punters alike, a sequel was just a matter of time. Well, fans of Core Design's brilliant graphic adventure will no doubt be pleased to know that there isn't that long to go until the release of the imaginatively titled Heimdall 2. Hit are loads of incidental background animations and 'nice touches' popping up all over the place, giving the game a unique cartoon feel. Combat will also play a huge part in the game, meaning this shouldn't just appeal to RPGers. Keep an eye out when it's on the rampage around Easter time. Simon Byron Here's someone's daughter who needs to be rescued. This is obviously not one of the more complex puzzles in the game... or is it? ry that you were capture Erik the Viking Once again Loki, the first game's villain, is up to his old tricks. Since his original run-in with Heimdall, he's been walking the land, building up an army of vicious Hakrats. Fortunately the gods have learned of a special amulet which is powerful enough to trap the evil god but surprise, surprise â€” this weapon has been spilt into six segments which have been scattered throughout the land. So Heimdall has been called upon to reassemble the shattered amulet and capture Loki, while avoiding the general traps and defeating the hideous creatures most self-respecting heroes take care of before breakfast. All in a day's work, really makes Heimdall 2 substantially different from its prequel is the background animations and smaller playarea. Although there are significantly fewer locations in Heimdall 2, there are more puzzles so there won't be lengthy periods of wandering around, looking for something to do something which the first game was occasionally criticised for. There Pippa Longstocking Good story, huh? Like the original game, Heimdall 2 is an isometric arcade adventure. But what really Interaction with other characters is not that good. Here, for instance, you've simply got to sit and listen to the king waffling on. 104 "

A veritable horde of nasties just itching to be given the gas but it's not the sort that'll make them laugh. Stage of Development 90% Completa It's back to the heady days of cute coin-op action with Thalion's first CD32 title! as though it has farting connotations, but you'd be wrong. The two main characters, Puff and Blow (whoever came up with those names remembers the Seventies a bit too well Ed), are stars when it comes to firing gas clouds at baddies from their special methane guns, and they put their skills to the test over level-after-level of arcade action. The idea is to blast the enemies with your gas guns, catch them in the cloud of methane, pick them up and throw them against a wall, at which point they'll release a stack of goodies which you can pick up. Clear a level of nasties and you'll move on to the next, more difficult level. Quack Bubble Bobble and Parasol Stars were both hits and Super Methane Bros derives much of its gameplay style, and look, to those two classics. More and more quality product is being released on CD32, so let's hope Super Methane Bros keeps up the tradition when we review it soon. More introductory shenanigans abound. Could we have another Bubble Bobble on our hands? .the bus hit a large rock, and with a crash and a bump they were catapulted from their seats Puff fires a blast of methane it's just a pity there's nothing around to be caught in it!

And what better way to conform to the ELSPA directive than to release a cutesy caper that owes Parp Super Methane Bros from Thalion, the company which brought you the excellent No Second Prize and Lionheart (which, are both appearing on CD32 in April at a scandalously reasonable .99 each), may sound 105 "

"SORRY SCOUSE SCRIBBLINGS Dear YOB, I am writing to complain about your rating system. When you review games that are sequels, such as Streetfighter 2 and Super Streetfighter 2, why don't you give two ratings? The first one would compare it to the first game, so people who bought it can tell if it's worth getting the follow-up, and a second rating for all those who don't have it. This way people would know if they were being ripped-off by a game which is essentially the same as one they already own. Anyway, answer my questions. 1. When will the Jaguar be coming out in Britain? 2. Will there be any Streetfighter games coming out for it? 3. How much will the Jaguar cost? 4. Have you got any news of Akira on the Amiga? 5. Why did you suddenly raise the price of your mag? PAUL DONNELLY Wirral, Merseyside PS Keep up the good work. PPS Who does all the great pics on the letters page? PLEASE GIVE ME MY 15 MINUTES YOB: Yeah, right. Then we'd get loads of letters from sad-cases going 'I think you reviewing system's too complicated' or 'why to did this game get 60% and 90% on the same review?' Games should be reviewed on their own merit, and if we think they're too similar to a previous incarnation we'll say so. 1. There are some import machines available at the big games stores. 2. Nope. 3. A little bit more than a little bit less. 4. Nope. 5. Because Paul Rand needed the cash for the solar-powered haemorrhoid ointment applicator recommended by his GP. With the price of batteries these days, it's the only machine worth considering for long-term use. PS Of course. PPS Some bloke called Stuart we found hanging around Farringdon Lane tube.

If the Jaguar is going to be , will the Mega-CD be cheaper also? LEE CHESHAM Melksham, Wilts. Dear YOB, The price for computer games are cack. Well some are. For instance Streetfighter II for the Mega Drive.  is a load of crap. Sega is really sick. They haven't made a decent game yet. I should know because I have a Game Gear. I can complete all the games. I completed Streetfighter II for the Mega Drive the first time I played it. The other thing that bothers me is that some games are going to have certificates which makes me really mad. I think they should stick to 16-bit graphics platform and beat-'em-up games. STEPHEN HUTCHINSON Carlisle SEGA HOT m YOB: 1. Your mate is about as much use as an eggy fart in a submarine and he's talking out of his backside as usual. It so happens that the winner of the 1992 Capcom World Streetfighter Championships in Japan used Dhalsim throughout the contest. 2. It's OK. 3. They're basically the same, although Turbo on the SNES is harder to complete. SCE was so-called to get around Capcom's Turbo contract commitments with Nintendo. So there you go. 4. Why should I? The Mega Drive may be technically superior, but if you want my opinion the NES has better games. Ooh, controversy! 5. Highly likely. 6. Because nobody bought the Lynx. Forty quid is a bargain, and I'd suggest you buy one now. Then get Klax if you know what's good / SEGA UH-HU... for you. 7. I called Sega on the special Yob Inside ial Yob Inside ( THE MESSAGE is Hotline number known only by myself, and they asked me to pass on this personal mes'SOD OFFS sage, specially for you: Sod OH. THANK YOU. 8. If Melksham was blown up, who'd care? M HELLO... YOB: Er... fine. Glad we cleared that one up. Show this copy of CVG to the doctor and he might knock a couple of months off your treatment programme. Then again, he may add a few... 2009 MOST POINTLESS QUESTIONS EVER? Yo YOB, I think your idea is cool. I have been dying to ask you some questions. 1. Which computer costs the most? 2. Which is the best computer game? 3. What is the best fighting game? 4. Is Mario better than Sonic? 5. Which computer is the best? 6. What is your favourite game? 7. Which game got the biggest rating? 8. What was the first game made for the Jaguar? 9. What was the first home computer named? 10. What is is worst game? 11. What is the most funny game? 12. What is the most expensive game? Please give me the money because I want to buy all the CVG mags aso that I get to see your cool comments. Thank you for listening. RICHARD SANDERS Somewhere remember CVG once rated Chessmaster on the Game Boy at 98. However, that doesn't really count. 8. Cybermorph was the first complete game. 9. The first affordable home computer was the ZX80, a black-and-white machine built by Clive Sinclair, which came out about 1980. You bought the thing in a kit which you had to build yourself with a soldering iron, the entire machine boasted 'Ik of memory and by today's standards it was completely and utterly crap. (Today's Game Boy cartridges have about 2,000 times more memory). A year or so later Sinclair came out with the ZX81 (still 1K) and in 1983 built the Spectrum the computer which kickstarted the video games world as we know it. Here endeth the history lesson. If you lot want to know more about the (quite boring really) history of computer games, bung me a letter with your questions and I might even bother to answer them. 10. In my opinion, the Worst Game Of All Time is a complete draw between three games. The Great Space Race on the Spectrum was megahyped and sold squillions on its release before punters realised the whole thing had been written in BASIC and was a steaming great turd. More recently, Dark Castle from Electronic Arts lifted the crown of crapdom on the Mega Drive thanks to its absolutely appalling playability, graphics so bad they defied belief and baddies that went Nee Nee Nee Nee' like demented dwarves with piles. Lately, though, the honour of Worst Game In History goes to Ferrari Formula One on NES and Game Boy with its unique 'road moving steering system. The game is so bad it defies belief. 11. Dark Castle. 12. Virtual reality games which can cost FOUR QUID a game probably take the biscuit. What a rip-off. YOB: 1. It's probably the one that leaves you with the least change, but that's an educated guess. 2. Which one? 3. Samurai Shodown on the Neo Geo. 4. Depends. He's not as fast, but he's better at filling his trousers. 5. What a stupid question. 6. At the moment it's NBA JAM in the arcades. 7. Can't remember offhand. Probably Super Mario World, which would have got about 96 per cent. However, I do 110 "
