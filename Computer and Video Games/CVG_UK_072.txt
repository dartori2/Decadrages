"C+VG Bubble Reviews this issue Bubble Bobble dragons Bub and Bob, water shoots, magical objects, fruits and treasure. You start at the bottom of the screen and the monsters race down from above. Your only weapons are bubbles which you shoot at the oncoming nasties. The bubbles surround their bodies and they start to float to the top of the screen. After a few moments they'll be released but if you get to the bubble and burst it first they fly around the levels and turn into fruits. If they manage to escape, the bubbles turn red and you'll have to go after them again. If you're slow at completing a level, and catching all the bullies on it, Baron Blubba, a fishy fellow, appears and he chases you round the screen. The screens get more complex as you move downward from one to another. Sometimes you'll drop down a random number of levels but you can take some comfort because the first moves of the bullies on each level are always the same, so you can easily build up strategies for avoiding and bubbling them once you Druid 11 B24/Apocalypse Tube/Baseball  MACHINES: C64/128/ AMSTRAD/SPECTRUM/ ATARI ST  SUPPLIER: FIREBIRD  PRICE: .95 VERSION TESTED: CBM64/128 REVIEWER: JOHN Bubble up that gum and prepare to take on the evil Baron Von Blubba and his cronies.

"GVG MIIATS Conflicts 1 This is the first of two compilation sets released by PSS both of games only a year or so old (all have been reviewed in C+VG in the last 12 months). Look carefully before you buy, since the versions for different machines DON'T include the same games. The Spectrum and CBM64 versions of Conflicts 1 contain Battle of Britain, Falklands 82, and Theatre Europe but the Amstrad version substitutes Tobruk for Falklands 82. Whether you think this price for three games is a bargain depends on whether you need more than one of them. My own difficult for a beginner and not view is that PSS put together very appealing to someone who what they had available rather just likes arcade games. than choosing three games for The Tobruk of the Amstrad the same sort of player version is too limited as a Whereas Falklands 82 is a strategy game of Western child's game that barely Desert warfare, but includes a qualifies as a wargame or as good tank simulator.

Along with Battle for Midway the Spectrum version has only Iwo Jima, a 2/27 game using the same mechanisms, and of the same quality, as Falklands 82.

Perhaps the best way to describe these two games is as slow-moving shoot-em-ups. Battle of Midway, however, is one of the best wargames that PSS have so far produced, despite being over two years old.

These include radar, compass, altitude and fuel and velocity dials, a messages screen and weapon selection. You also have control over engine power and must return to base if your fuel and weapons are running low. Now for the weapons. These are: Cannon--for use at a range of less than one mile. Heat-seeking missiles can be used at distances of up to eight miles. Radar-guided missiles these are for real long shots from up to 25 miles. Air-ground/ship missiles can be used at altitudes of under 2,000 feet and at speeds of less than 500 knots. Hitting the V key will bring up a map of the battlezone. Useful if your enemy seems to be staying away. I quite like flight simulations providing they are fairly easy to get into. Nothing annoys me more than having to read a flight manual which seems just as long as the real thing and then having to spend what seems like hours getting the right engine thrust, flap setting and rudder control correct before being able to take off. And even then I always end up raising the undercarriage before I've taken off! Well with Ace 2 there's none of this to worry about. The fiddly controls are kept to a bare minimum and when you hit the fire button the action starts. Ace graphics and ace sound from music man Rob Hubbard ensure Ace 2 is a worthy successor to Ace.

"MATT TRAKKER REVIEW SHA AGE :28 OD OD VERBA HORFERME GREMLIN is behind the kidnappings which are further attempts to de-stabilise world peace and may signal the start of a massive global crime spree. Your mission is to track down the missing agents and destroy as many of Venom's cohorts as possible. There's not much you have to go on. The agents have disappeared into a vortex which has taken them into one of four fantasy worlds. Don your mask, the trademark of your organisation, and remote controller of all the weapons, communications and equipment at your disposal, and take to the skies in your Thunderhawk pursuit craft. Once you've found and entered the Venom vortex you're dumped on one of four fantasy worlds-Boulder Hill, Pre-historic, Far Future and Venom Base. You'll find two of the six agents in all but the first of those, and at Boulder Hill you have to find your own mask before you can start your rescue mission. The landscapes are finely detailed and the terrain is natural enough until you come across the five symbols which mark the locations of useful objects. There are bombs and repair kits for your Thunderhawk, as well as security keys, scanners and masks which'll help you to locate your missing buddies. Just scoot through them to pick them up and they're entered on your ship's control at the bottom of the screen ready for use. To find an agent you've got to go through a search and pick-up sequence which is unnecessarily complicated but which lengthens the game. First you've got to pick-up a scanner and find the four keys, amongst many, which will activate it. Once found, pick up the agent and go in search of his mask and collect it before going off in search of the next agent. Each of the four locations contains a scattering of deadly fanua, aliens, monsters and high-technology weapons all aimed at you. Boulder Hill is sweet with its helicopter bombers, jeeps, tanks, boulders and freight trains, compared with Pre-history which hurls Pterydactyls, Snapping Turtles, dinosaurs, volcanoes and lava at your Thunderhawk.

"ATARI ROUND-UP REVIEWS the wildly imaginative graphics. It's been rated a classic in every other version, and all I can add is that XL and XE owners really must have this in their collection Overall Rating: A school report for the Atari XL/XE series would probably read 'late starters'. Somehow they failed to attract the public when they were first flocking to buy C64s and Spectrums. But the story has a happy ending. Discount prices led to a solid user vase which Atari, much to their credit, continued to support. So did the software manufacturers, some of whom were in from the start, others arriving rather later when they saw an untapped market. The result is that the machines' capabilities are now being exploited by some excellent full price games, balanced by a brilliant budget selection.

Unfortunately, this of the law refused to show itself during several hours of play, can only assume they were avoiding me! During play, the screen is divided horizontally into three windows, Ollie and his immediate surroundings at the top and Stan likewise at the bottom. In the middle of the screen is a green strip containing a pianist more of him laterand icons to show the status of both characters. To carry out any action you must first stop moving. You then press fire and move your joystick up or down to choose an option. These come in the form of silent screen \"captions\" which appear in your playing area and give you a description if sometimes a little cryptic of what you can do. These are a nice idea, but they're hell to use. It is very easy to select the wrong option because of the awkward way you have to choose. The skill in this game ought to be your ability to collect a pie, lay traps for your opponent, catch him off guard and siap him right in the mush while avoiding a similar fate yourself. If you could actually do this, not only woud the game be fun, but it would also capture the slapstick style that Advance has tried so hard to create. Instead, you spend ages trying to achieve what should be routine tasks in the game. In the game's favour I have to say the animation is brilliant, especially in the way that is used to bring Stan and Ollie to life, but this alone cannot save the game.

Anyway, our true-blue hero commander John Stryker is back, this time to tackle the mysterious planet Volga. His mission is to penetrate the underground defence systems to locate and purloin a new secret spacecraft. The nice thing about the Superior at its best is that storylines actually mean something, thanks to the usually excellent graphics. Codename Droid is no exception.

All the original Mercenary fans will be pleased to hear that you can load your status from a previous game this will give you a flying start in the new adventure. The scene is set, Damocles is a massive comet racing towards impact with the planet Eris, the fifth in its solar system. Your point of arrival is in orbit around Eris and you have a few hours left before the planet is destroyed. The game is played out in real time so the heat is on the solar system is vast and has nine planets, 19 moons and space stations galore to explore. The game is not finished but I was able to see some of the space and planet sequences. Just what can I say? It is so atmospheric, the light and shading effects from the central sun on to the planets makes me swoon. MORE, MORE, MORE! Forget NASA. Forget flight D A MO CLES sims, forget sci-fi movies. This is as close as you will get in your lifetime. You can fly through the crescent of a moon, ease through the back of an eclipse, zoom at heart-wrenching speeds into a planet, only to see its buildings slowly take form below you WOW! The final version will have a starfield and the space stations will be wireframe. Again the emphasis will be on arcade action AND strategy thus satisfying both urges. It is being written on the ST (priced .95) with conversions to Commodore/Spectrum and Amstrad 8-bit machines to follow. Damocles has still got a fair bit of work to be done on it so it is unlikely to be ready for the PCW show, more likely around Christmas time. So you will just have to wait eagerly for it. It is actually worse for me, I have SEEN it, but I cannot play it. all I can do is D-R-E-A-M. Hurry up Mr Woakes, we are waiting for you ... DAM OCLES D A MOC LESUID A MOC LES "

"IDEASI CENTRAL EAGLES NEST Isn't it typical! After thinking Summer has arrived, what happens ... rain for three weeks. Never mind, just think of me as I'm laying on some sun drenched beach for the next two weeks ‚Äî 'cos I'll be thinking of you. But just because I'm off for my annual hols, it doesn't mean you have to stop sending in your maps tips etc. Keep sending them to Melissa R, I.C. HQ, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London; EC1R 3AVU. ATRIST Someone who heard my plea for help was The Falcon. He sent in some tips for four games on the ST. Arkanoid: when the game loads, press CAPS LOCK and the type the word Deathstar. Start the game and now you can simply press the S key to jump to the next screen. You can do this right through to the final screen. Rogue: when your saved character is loaded in, quickly remove the character disk and put a blank disk in. This prevents your saved character being deleted from the disk after it is loaded in. Saves time loading, too. Ultima: when you first starta character, allocate most of you points to Agility. Then you can steel most of the useful equipement-phasers and food without being caught. Airball: The spellbook is in the room with the candle. You have to pick up and remove the blocks to get it. Take the Spellbook back to the start screen and drop it in the top left corner and follow the instructions to get the ingredients to complete the game. But, where's the Budha and the beads. Stuart Henny and Garry Sinclair of Fife have these tips for Micronaut One and Star Raiders II. First up is Micronaut. Collect the small clouds with float about the tunnels as they increase your energy. Destroy all of the webs. This is done by shooting the grey blob at the base of each one. Don't shoot the eggs.

POTW II is a graphically intensive adventure similar in style to the original, but with a brand new series of episodes, and some new features.

The game tries to reproduce the format and appearance of the original books, while taking advantage of the computers added flexibility. Some people, especially given is correct, you can go on to the next section. If not, you know you have missed something.\" Latest in their detective mystery series, L'affair is a graphical adventure set in western Europe.

By moving a cursor around each screen, you can talk to different characters in each city, game, from movement within a location to interaction with other characters in the game, and assembling the parts of your bike that you've already found. You will also need to have found various spanners, and screw drivers to be able to assemble the bike!

"FANTASY Byran Talbot's The Adventures of Luther Arkwright was hailed as the first and only adult British graphic novel when it was launched five years ago.

Following a favourable reaction to this, Arkwright reappeared in a much longer, more complex, story serialised first in Near Myths, then in Pssst! This serial was gathered together in 1982 as Book One of The Adventures of Luther Arkwright. The book was hailed as the first and only truly adult British graphic novel. As a confirmed Arkwright enthusiast (which you'd probably guessed by now), I can't wait to read Book Two. Talbot's artwork, from the pages I've seen, is as finely-detailed as ever, and he promises a gripping story in which the cold, calculating super-agent undergoes a dramatic transformation. In fact, we will see Luther Arkwright die a symbolic death, whereupon he is reborn as a messianic, almost Christ-like figure. In the outside world the Battle of London rages, and all the while a doomsday device is ticking away... So, where can you find Luther Arkwright?

Arkwright will also be appearing in a nine-issue comic book, published every two months starting in August 1987 by Valkyrie Press at 60p per issue, and reprinting the story from Book One. The attraction here is that Bryan Talbot has prepared a series of attractive new covers and frontispieces guaranteed to enhance your lifestyle. Sul "


"FANTASY You always see it in the movies. Some Mad Scientist attaches himself to a computer and is transformed into a monster or superman. Forget about the monsters, but why not try to become supermen? It may not make us all men of steel but Bodylink can help you improve your lifestyle using a personal computer. Bodylink harnesses the electrical energy in the human body and turns it into information that can be monitored and learned from. This can help you learn to exercise more effectively, even control the old rock and roll of daily stress. The module plugs into the cartridge slot of a Commodore 64/128 computer. The Bodyscope cartridge is then used to create a personal record based on such factors as sex, age and weight. This information is then saved to the disk drive for use later on in conjunction with the other plug-in programs. A special graph monitors in real time, and let's you customize the upcoming workout for the desired performance, and amount of difficulty. The module receives its information from a series of sensors which are attached to your body The headband, for example, uses three electrodes which conduct body electricity from your forehead into the computer How about a cardiovascular workout on a stationary bike? Of course you could just run on the spot if you like. Strap the electrodes on the leg band along the muscle area of your knee, plug it into the EMG sensor cable and into the module. A pulse sensor attaches to the handle bars, and a finger clip grips your index digit. Then pop in the Ride For Your Life cartridge. Start pedalling as your little onscreen buddy weaves through city traffic. Meanwhile Bodylink is looking at your speed and heart rate, measuring calories burned and the time and distance of your jaunt. When you're done, the program will display a graph showing the results, as well as comparisons with previous efforts. This can be printed out as well. Let's work on better muscle coordination Attach the sensors to your wrist and practice swinging (golf club, cricket bat, tennis racquet). The Bodyscope program will display the characteristics of your swing so that you can work on improving Dixon Miniatures are famous worldwide for their top quality metal gaming figures.

"AKUA CROSSFIRES FLAK ATTACK Arcade ace Clare Edgeley checks out Once you get the hang of it, and it is definitely more fun playing with Devil World Exterminator, Crossfire, a partner, you'll be able to whizz Flak Attack and Black Tiger. All this and high scores as well onto the more interesting ones later in the game. You may have been wondering what the jump.  DEVIL button is for as in the early levels almost identical to those found in you don't need it at all. Just wait till WORLD Gauntlet. Destroy the cairns and you get to the river of lava over you'll stop the flow of aliens. It's not which you have to cross by leaping difficult to see where the idea from plate to plate of unstable, Konami's latest offering, Devil came from. Some monsters weild unmelted lava crust. At the same World, is hardly original but it is axes which they'll use to hack at time, you've still got the monsters to highly playable. you if you're within range or throw contend with. And if you're playing Arcade addicts will recognise at you. Either way, they're good a two player game you must make the hybrid immediately. Devil shots and this particular breed is sure that you keep up with your World is based heavily on ideas highly dangerous. partner. It's nerve-racking stuff. taken from both Gauntlet and the Power balls litter the screen and One scene which sticks in my relatively new Alien Syndrome. It's you should pick these up whenever mind as a test of endurance o two player game where you play possible. These give extra concerns the rope ladders. These either a man or a woman and, like weapons like machine gun, laser, link three islands together, and you con guess where the key and exit is 156700 to be found. Trying to cross o swinging rope ladder with a bunch of baddies breathing down your neck and having to concentrate on jumping over the gaps left by rotton planks is not my idea of a quiet Sunday walk. One false step and you plummet to your doom. Another scene has you wading through a plain of waist high grass which catches fire and sweeps out of control blocking you off from the exit. And then there's the dragon. It's a one screen scenario with no scrolling and you can't get away until you've zapped him on the head a few times. It's this fight in a confined space that really eats away at your health and stamina. There seem to be masses of screens and all of them with differing landscapes to negotiate Alien Syndrome, the playing areas bazooka, crossbow and so on. All before you can pick up the key and are many, but each is very small. of which are more deadly than the hotfool it to the exil. The graphics Put in a nutshell, you must fight peo shooter you're given when are large and clear though not as your way past the monsters on you first start the game. neat as those in Alien Syndrome. each level, find the key and take it to the exit where a stairway is 56700 SO STORT revealed leading down into the next level. Very simple, but very tricky. The playing areas are islands floating in a sea of nothingness. Fall over the edge and you're a gonner. A map button (again like Alien Syndrome) reveals the whereabouts of the key and exit, though each time you start you ought to check their locations as they have an annoying habit of shifting position. The monsters are suitably ugly os well as being dangerous and the sprites are surprisingly large if not particularly brilliantly drawn. Shooting a monster tends to phase it out, but more are regenerated from small stone cairns which look When a whole spate of games appear all based on the same theme, it has got to be said that the coin-op manufacturers are jumping on the band wagon of one or two success stories Take for instance, the Gauntlet games of a while back, or more recently the Commando and Nemesis lookalikes. We've already seen 1942, 1943, Flying Shark and this month there are two more to add to the already full list. Crossfire by JKL Corp and Flak Alack from Konami. Perhaps Flak Attack is a more accurate clone and to be fair it is more addictive and exciting than Crossfire. But that is because Crossfire is more of a cartoon based game and no attempt at realism has been made. I'm not knocking Crossfire because of its lack of realism, it's still an exciting game to play though it's easier all round than its rival. You take off from a landing strip in the normal manner and immediately squadrons of enemy planes zoom in for the attack. The planes come in a multitude of different sizes, shapes and colours, some attacking in formation, others flying in silently alone for the kill. Watch out for rocky outcrops in the sea, they look harmless enough, but back slides a panel and out pops yet another cannon These are fairly easy to douse before they create too much havoc. What you do have to watch are the planes which fly up from the bottom of the screen behind you. If you're in the wrong position, and they suddenly appear on your tail, you've no time to manoeuvre and you'll collide. One large plane always appears towards the end of a level and this needs to be pumped full of cannon fire if you're to blow it up. Especially difficult as it is well protected by its own cannons. Still, you'll quickly learn where to find extra weapons. Four blue planes randomly appear in formation, zipping in and on and off the screen almost before you have a chance to react. Shoot all four and a capsule drops into the sea cycling through a range of colours. Shoot it and fly over the remains and you'll have got yourself another weapon. The landscape changes as you fly on, but the enemy attacks don't "


"11E ACTION 324001501200 EXTERMINATOR -27540 HIGH SC diminish they just get more ferocious. Volcanoes and hover craft are added to the list of undesirables, ground based canons are a pain and the aircraft at the end of each level are larger and more difficult to kill Crossfire is fun, fast but not instantly addictive and I'd only play it for a spot of light hearted relief. For a more serious game of blowing up the baddies I'd turn to the screaming, roaring engines of the fighter jets in Flak Attack No one could accuse Konami's Flak Attack of being unrealistic with its super fast jet aircraft engaged in a series of bitter dogfights. In fact the opening sequence is superb as your single fighter takes off with its engines roaring to take its fighting position in the skies over some helpless city. Although you start off over a city, the fight swiftly moves on over a number of landscapes and in each area it becomes more difficult to make headway. The city area is relatively easy. Just blast the enemy and avoid the pink mushroom clouds which spring up from the city far below. Initially these aircraft attack singly, though there are many on the screen at once and it's impossible to get to them all. They also travel at a greater speed than your craft, making it difficult, on occasion, to dodge them. And, they re just as likely to turn a swift 90 degrees and fly over the screen in your direction, so ignoring those aircraft that are not diving directly overhead is a big mistake. Soon the city is left behind and a rugged terrain appears guarded by uncannily accurate ground to aircraft missile launchers. These missiles fill the screen with a blanket of enemy fire and to get through safely you're going to have to take some of them out. It's tricky and gives you a great feeling of satisfaction should you manage lo hit the target without getting yourself killed. Eventually though, you'll have to run the gauntlet ihrough a long line of these cannons virtually impossible to get it right first time as the skies are filled with a thick blanket of missiles. The enemy now attack in formation, and though they are easier to kill when grouped together there are now many more jets to contend with. Flak Attack is very noisy, realistic and addictive enough to encourage you to put in just another 20 pence. It's very similar to the other games of this genre, but is still an exciting shoot-'em-up in its own right Exterminator by Taito is really self explanatory. Just blast everything in sight and you should make enough headway up the screen to take on the massive three-headed robotic cyclops. This is one of those games where playing in the two player mode adds enough excitement to want to continue playing. So to the start. The first wave of mutants descend from the top of the screen flying eyeballs, swamp monsters and killer millipedes do their best to stun you. Touch one and you'll be thrown back a few feet while your life span gets that much shorter. When your life points reach zero you die only to reappear for a second shot at the mutants. The pace is quite fast and you'll have to zip niftily round the screen to avoid a collision. Boulders litter the area shoot these and, as they disintegrate, you might find a hidden stairwell leading to an undergorund cavern. As soon as you leg-it underground, your LIFE partner will automatically follow. Once there, you'll find some metal caskets and if you blast these open some bonus goodies will be revealed. Perhaps an aura capsule which protects you for a short while, or armour, a psycho helmet, even a search goggle Search goggles are greatthey allow you to detect the rocks which conceal the hidden staircase. And when the millipedes swarm, the time stopper stops them dead, allowing your escape. If one of these dear little creatures get you then tend to hang on tenaciously chomping away at your legs. There's no shaking them off either. Rows of blue aliens are pretty helpful though, once they're dead. They'll occasionally leave a pulsing blue all behind which, if you pick it up, will dog your footsteps while giving extra fire power. A string of these, each firing upwards, can do lots of damage to the descending enemy forces. Other items seem to fall at random from laser frazzled aliens INSERZNUE 2 and these include the ability to fight and fire in formation, extra speed calibre that'll have you coming and more weapons. So if you've back for more and more...

"AKCAE AC IN BLACK TIGER and there are columns you can he UK COIN-OP HIGH SCORES JUK HALL OF FAME ages. Black Tiger is weird. With a deep and dingy colour scheme, a strange subterranean atmosphere and characters which have stepped straight from the dark When I first saw the game it wasn't fully completed, so this is very much in the way of a preview. The reason the colour scheme is in varying shades of purple and black is because the land is doomed to eternal darkness, thanks to three unwanted dragons who descended from the once clear skies above the planet. As usual you've been cast in the role of hero and it's your unenviable task to get rid of the dragons and so lighten the atmosphere. Garbed in armour and equipped with a business-like chain with a studded ball of cast iron at one end, you tread warily to your doom. Peering ahead you can just make out the shape of what looks like a giant ram in armour. But as you creep closer the shape turns into that of the shield and huge torso of one of the dragon's guardians. Clutching your shield you leap forward into battle, swinging the ball and chain for all you're worth. If you keep your distance you should be able to knobble the mighty warrior with no trouble. The idea is to keep out of reach of hid deadly double-headed axe. Get too close and you're likely to lose your armour and shield which leaves you feeling very vulnerable. Black Tiger is played in tunnels use to jump up, leaping from one to the other to get to higher playing areas. Arrows point in the directions you can travel and often there are junctions where there is a choice of paths leading perhaps to the dungeons or up to a higher level. Prehistoric bats flap into your face while you're clinging to the columns and these are just as likely to kill you as the warriors. Floating blue orbs should be avoided at all costs. You'll stand a much better chance of winning if you manage to find the power box. Catch the item coming out of it and you'll be awarded with a variety of extras like the ability to become tranparent, to speed up, or you'll be given piercing bullets, rapid fire, poison or a time-stopper. Some of which will be very useful when fighting your ultimate opponents -the dragons. Black Tiger looks very interesting even though it is rather gloomy. And the music doesn't helpill strike doom into the most cheerful of souls! Still it's got a lot going for it and it'll be interesting to see the finished game.

And having experienced a couple of superfast stomach churning flights, I can see why the game's being heralded with such excitement. The first five levels are fairly easy to get through with automatic refuilling on the third level. The only difference in these early scenes are the numbers of enemy fighters and the background colours of the scenery. The sixth level is a real killer and consists of high brick walls in a mazelike formation. You've got to fly between these walls to get to the open spaces outside. After Burner is definitely the best game I've seen this year and if you can afford a pound orten give it a go. F AFTER BURNER "

"C+VG's Hot Gossiper Tony Takoushl has the biggest eyes, nose and mighty mouth in computer games. He sees all, hears all and he then shouts about it each month exclusively in your favourite computer mag. So read on for the man who shoots from the lip at the good, the bad and the ugly in the software world. ust recently there has been fan increase in the number of ads which feature various parts of women's bodies. There is a time and place for everything. I pick up computer magazines to read about computers and games and NOT to have huge breasts thrust at me! What is even stranger is just WHY this has been happening... There was a time, a few years ago, when the now defunct mag, Home Computing Weekly, started to display models on its cover holding computer peripherals. This did lead to protests and the idea was dropped. Mark Cale of System Three probably has the dubious honour of the worst sexual exploitation with his exploits at the PCW Show of too suggestive... Recently this sort of exploitation has increased with the ads getting even more daring; the one for Game Over really did take it to the extreme. Ocean was not the only one, Mirrorsoft with its Defender of the Crown and Palace with its promo of Barbarian with a raunchy cover featuring Maria Whittaker also got in on the act. Of course it does get the game coverage for better or worse, all software companies are allowed artistic license to plug their games, it really is just a matter of degree. In our society sex is generally acknowledged as a selling point, but being honest, to my mind crude sexual artwork has NO PLACE in computer games. ST WARS 1985, he was due to release a be described as \"very game called Twister Mother physical\" to dance on his of Harlots, and hired a dance stand.

The last couple of scenes are fun, the obstacle room is exactly that and you have to steer around obstacles-a really strong 3D effect here -and then blow up the power generator, if you manage to do this you leave through the trench again and fly off into space to see the planet explode. The variety of scenes makes this game entertaining, and although it is weak in parts it does generally satisfy. Indeed if you are a fan of the arcade Star Wars games then this is for you. "
