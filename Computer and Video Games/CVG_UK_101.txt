"THE RATINGS When a game is reviewed, we give ratings for five different criteria: GRAPHICS Does the game look good? Is the scrolling smooth? Are the sprites flickery? Is the animation realistic? This mark covers all visual aspects of the game. SOUND Sound and music that enhance a game are given high marks. The sound rating is low if the soundtrack or effects are inappropriate. VALUE Here, we take into consideration the price of the game, the amount of entertainment it offers and the quality of the packaging. In other words is it worth the money. PLAYABILITY This tells you how addictive and enjoyable the game is the higher the rating is, the more playable the game is. OVERALL The most important rating of all.

The Master System version is a two player game, but from what we've seen the game is looking absolutely fantastic! So too is impossible Mission, with the player taking on the role of Agent 4215, a James Bond-type hero who enters the fortress of the evil Dr Elvin Atombender in an attempt to shut down his operation. Graphically it's a vast improvement over the C64 original, and all of the speech from the computer game is to be included in the 128K cartridge. Both games will hit the streets later this year, but you can see them first if you read the exclusive reviews in the Complete Guide To Consoles II, which will be available in mid-April.

Sega are releasing the RPG game Ultima IV on the Mastersystem in America sometime in the Spring, while Megadrive owners can look forward to such big names as Crackdown and Michael Jackson's Moonwalker (June), Super Monaco GP, Hard Drivin, Roadblasters and Klax (Summer) and the odd-sounding Tongue Of The Fatman in Autumn. PC Engine owners can expect in the coming months: Bonk's Adventure (April), RBI Baseball II, klax and Xybots (Summer). Nintendo, though, have by far the longest release schedule, with a host of promising titles including Asty, Police Academy, Super Mario Bros 3 and Xybots (Spring), Roadblasters (June), and Mission Impossible, Mad Max, Nightmare On Elm Street and Maniac Mansion later on in the year. ADVENTURE STORIES COMPUTER ADVENTURES The Secret Art Gil Williamson mazon systems NEC GET ENGINE RUNNING Writing successful adventure games these days is a tricky business, but if you think you have the design for the next Magnetic Scrolls hit buzzing around inside your head, you might try reading Computer Adventures The Secret Art, by Gil Williamson. In it, Williamson provides a thorough analysis of the design techniques used in all the best adventures, so that you can use them to turn your home-grown romp through the haunted forest into something quite special. The book is published by Amazon Systems at .95 quite pricey for a 128-page paperback, but novice RPG programmers are sure to find it invaluable. At last! NEC appear to be doing the sensible thing by officially launching the PC Engine in Britain. It's still early days yet, but they've touted the machine around various retail outlets, all of whom have expressed their willingness to stock the console; and who can blame them, considering the price which NEC seem to be settling on a staggeringly low .99!

E COOK GROSIAS G COOK DONE What seemed like just another humdrum fax quickly became one of the hottest news pieces to come our way for a long time. Dev Tek Co, a Japanese hardware firm have revealed a brand new device which lets Megadrive owners download Amiga software to their machine using special battery-backed D-RAM cartridges The A-miga Drive, which slips comfortably into the expansion port of the Amiga consists of two custom chips and a special translational maths coprocessor which converts the Amiga 68000 code into a form which the Megadrive's own 68000 processor can understand. To get this amazing piece of hardware to work the user simply has to plug it into the Amiga, switch on, let it boot into the operating system (it takes about 3 seconds), then, when prompted, place a game disk (only games on one or two full disks work any more than that and you get a memory overflow error) into the Amiga the AmigaDrive does the rest by pulling the code off the disk and squeezing it into a 2-Meg battery backed RAM cartridge, which can then be plugged into the Megadrive and played just like any other Sega cartridge. The sound is exactly the same (both machines use FM Sound chips), and the graphics are virtually spot-on, apart from some degradation on HAM mode pictures. This means that if you have an Amiga-owning friend, you can increase your collection of Megadrive software from dozens to as many games as you can RESTAT 0:00 #POSTALE RIS FRESH FRESH T.

Then all you've got to do is add together the numbers that have a 1 underneath them and the proper number is revealed! Now you can see whether it matches your personal Megacomp Number. Still confused? Well, let's take an example. We're using the first T-shirt number: You put the code in like this... 1241816|3264128/256 51210242048 4096|819216384 3276865536131072 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 lololol lololo lo Now add up those numbers with 1 under them, so that's 2+16+128+2048+16384+131072 And that equals... er... 149650.

Mustering your unarmed combat A Stealing the car means getting rid of this guy and his anti-theft device (an AK-47!) first. Every item of vindicating evidence you come across has to be photographed so that it can be shown to the Police. Other items are of more immediate use, such as a car which gets you between the game's five levels via a 3D driving section. The car is armed up with machine guns and rockets to see off hostile helicopters and cars, but you'll also need a map to save you from getting hopelessly lost on the highways. Remember, time is against you, and a wrong turn could spell doom, not just for your brother but for the whole Free World! iit IIIIIIIIIIII C64 .99 Last Ninja returns but instead of being a Ninja, Vendetta's hero is a sort of embittered, Ramboesque Vietnam vet in an action-packed hunt for justice with so much blood and blasting it makes Last Ninja look like a walk in the park. Of course that means there's plenty of pixel-punching thrills to be had with a hero who won't walk through a door without well and truly booting it in first (just in case the handles are boobytrapped, presumably). When you've had lots of violent fun slapping the bad guys about, pick up an UZI and spray some bullets about the place! Collecting evidence provides the essential modicum of brainwork, and the \"puzzles\" aren't too demanding at all, because the collectable items in a room flash as you enter. The driving subgame is a fun addition and though it doesn't look particularly sophisticated, its race 'n' blast action is more entertaining than many standalone auto games of recent. All this gameplay (and a free watch!) in one package makes Vendetta the best Commodore buy I've seen in ages. Kidnap a copy today!

ETBALL There I was, joystick in hand, brain in neutral, thinking, \"Ooh dear, this is a bit over-difficult,\" when, as if by magic, an instruction manual appeared and explained away my problems! Like TV Sports Football, Basketball is a full simulation of the sport, so to play it successfully you really have to get to grips with the tactics of offensive and defensive plays. To begin with it's best to play either against an equally inept friend or with two small teams to keep things simple, then move on to the full game after you get the hang of things. Once in full control of the team you can set up some blinding attacking plays, and every shot imaginable (lay-ups, pivots, jump and hook shots and, of course, slam-dunks) is depicted with beautifully detailed sprites. Numerous additions to the gameplay such as time-outs, foulouts, full team-editing and league saving, and even an instant replay (with rewind and fast-forward!) make this the complete Basketball simulation. An absolute must for anyone remotely interested in team sports. PAUL GLANCEY (21I IIa Irvin goes for a field goal! Will it go in!?

You then launch from Solbase, select your destination planet or star on the naviga tion computer's chart, and en gage the Quadspace engines to flip the ship across the void. The FOE-57's armament depends on the mission, but normally its main weapons are a set of Stinger homing UPDATE Work on ST and PC Warhead is already proceeding at warp speed, and they are scheduled to dock with your local software station by mid April.

IIIIIIII VIIIIIIIIIID AMIGA .99 I've been a big fan of simulated space combat ever since Elite, and though always keen to boldly go where no man has gone before, I've often been disappointed by games which try to be \"Elite with extra bits.\" Warhead is Elite with most of the shooting and none of the trading, and the action is spread over 39 missions compared with Elite's five. The cockpit and space station graphics are excellent, as are the ship's computer displays playing around with the 3D galactic maps is like watching one of NASA's Voyager mission films. Having said that, the 3D ship models are an unelegant bunch, and look about as spaceworthy as your average paper dart. The other fly in the ointment is the amount of time it takes to get accustomed to the control system. Learning the keyboard commands isn't so bad, but the mouse control is difficult to gauge, so a nudge too far can leave the FOE-57 rolling out of control, and the \"speed dots\" which indicate your velocity just become a spiralling blur, making it difficult to recover control. The lure of the missions make it worth persevering though, and snippets of information picked up in the later sorties lead you into the next ones, so you just have to keep going till the final menace is destroyed and the galaxy is once again safe for children and small furry animals.

Donning his EVA suit, one of the party, a rookie merchant-marine, floated from the Princess' airlock toward the smaller vessel. Inside, all was silent, but there were no signs of damage, and as he flicked the power switch on the main console the craft came alive After deactivating the distress system the marine prepared to make his way back to the Princess Blue when a vast explosion rocked the Jolly Roger, hurling him to the deck with such force that he blacked out.

But after playing Space Rogue for some considerable time, I have to say (and I'm putting my neck on the block here) that we now have, at the very least, a true contender for Elite's title and, at most, a game which beats the allformats classic hands down in terms of graphic excellence and general playability. Where Elite fell down was the fact that there was no real conclusion, apart from gaining Elite status. Space Rogue, on the other hand, has a definite quest involved which, in my mind, makes for a much more enjoyable game. But what really makes Space Rogue something special is the ability to land and walk around in the space stations, interacting with the various people stationed there. As with the Ultima games from which this section is obviously derived, it's very enjoyable as well as being necessary to completion of the quest which makes up for the slightly disappointing in-flight combat which, although nicely done (with its spectacular external views) pales somewhat in comparison with Elite's dogfighting.

"POT CORNERS Before we had computers to play games on, the best shoot 'em ups around were hand-held Space Invaders machines with two invaders.

What they produced were three brilliant games, Thunderin' Turbos, Shark Attack and Sky Attack, three futuristic-shaped machines with impressive stereoscopic three-dimensional colour displays! Even though the gameplay is, as with most handhelds of their era, limited, the Tomytronic range is still surprisingly addictive today. 77 "


"GarCATISTGE THE FUTURE Golf Challenge This month saw the announcement of arguably the ultimate hand-held the portable PC Engine. It has a colour screen, with the option of linking it to a conventional monitor, and is compatible with all current and future Engine software. Like the Lynx, battery life is limited, but if the designers can find some way of rectifying that problem, then the portable PC Engine will be THE portable console of the early '90s. Of course, that's always supposing that NEC get the machine out on the streets before Sega and Nintendo hit back with their own products (Nintendo are rumoured to be producing a colour Gameboy, as well as one-off versions of current Gameboy hits like Tetris and Super Marioland). Whatever happens, it's looking as though the hand-held revolution of the 1990's will be as hard fought as the home computer war of the past decade. Golf Challenge 999 GOLF CHALLENGE SYSTEMA Sports games are a favourite of hand-held manufacturers this one, Golf Challenge, is a one or two player game with a variety of options, including a full set of clubs changing weather conditions and four skillevels.

PATRICK 01.& 2 UPDATE ST and Amiga versions are due on the market, priced .99 and .99 respectively. The controls are the same as the Spectrum game, and the graphics are far better than those reviewed here. As soon as we receive the games we'll include them in the Update section. I for one am a great fan of Romero's Zombie Trilogy, so you can imagine my delight when this game came into the office. Zombi captures the mood of the Dawn Of The Dead movie perfectly it's a suspense-filled romp through a deserted shopping mall, just like its bigscreen counterpart, and while the graphics aren't fantastic, they portray the action to a tee (although / was dismayed that the baldie old zombie from the film doesn't feature in the game!). Sound effects are what you'd expect from the PC limited beeps and squawks but that in no way damages the player's enjoyment of the game. The icon controls are initially confusing and do take a while to get used to, but once mastered you'll be using them without thinking. Altogether, Zombi is a first rate adaption of a classic horror film, which catches the mood perfectly even before you begin (you get a scene-setting \"comic book with the packaging) and will keep your interest until completion.

But that's exactly what E-Motion The game consists of fifty screens, each containing a number of coloured spheres and, sometimes, a solid structure. The idea is to obliterate all the spheres on screen by using a spaceship (or two if you're in dual-player mode) to bump like-coloured ones together. When different-coloured balls collide, another smaller ball appears which can be picked up and used to replenish the ship's energy.

Or at least that's what the programmers, Assembly Line (they did the smashing Interphase) thought, so they added the structures which need to be worked around, making things even trickier. They've also linked you to some of the balls via elastic bands, which calls for pixel-perfect maneuvering if you don't want to create more spheres. After a predetermined number of levels, one of three bonus stages can be tackled, allowing you to bump up those points before attempting the next screen.

First impressions are, as with most games of the genre, very misleading the screen looks bare and things seem somewhat boring. However, that first burst of movement and the eventual collision with the wrong sphere causes you to sit up, panic a bit, reevaluate your entire thoughts on the product and from that moment you're hooked. Like all the true greats, graphics are above average as opposed to spectacular, although the use of raytracing on the balls and structures is pretty impressive in itself. Similariy, sound is \"nice\" but the plinkety-plink tunes and spot effects will soon have you twiddling your volume knob.

The sheer amount of features present in the game is unbelievable pots of digitised graphics, from the crisp photos of the Man Utd team to the dozen or so action replays which are shown when a goal is scored (they're taken from real matches, the most appropriate one being shown for the goal scored), brilliantly animated selection screens such as the Fitness icon which shows a player hobbling off the field, assisted by two others, and oodles more besides if I were to list them all, I'd need an extra page or six and that's only the management side of the game. The match section is a brilliant and incredibly playable football game in its own right. For instance, there's a referee on the pitch, running around doing what refs do (apart from being insulted by the fans). The strips change colour depending on whether the game is at home or away, and as far as I can see, all the team colours are faithful to their real-life counterparts. Playing the game is true to life too, as each team is graded on past form, so you may beat a team like Shrewsbury 8-0 one week, but end up falling flat on your face against Liverpool the next.

"SEGA He scores!! MACHINES SLAP SHOT SEGA .95 BY SEGA lapshot is a simulation of Ice Hockey, a sport of tricky stick work and much ungentlemanly conduct! One or Iwo players can partake in the action, and the object is simply to slap the puck into the opponent's goal, strike attempts shown via an impressive close-up animated action replay, with the puck whistling into the back of the next, being saved by the keeper or flying wide. Like the sport, play is tough and you can rough up and knock over opponents with your stick but be careful, if they dodge past you, your flailing attempts could leave you sitting on the deck looking stupid and getting a very cold bot while play whizzes upfield! Slapshot is an admirable rendition of the fast and furious sport, and features great graphics, especially the excellent close-up replay screen, and a decent control method, letting you switch between players when you see fit, rather than the computer. The inertia effect is great, so you feel like your players are skating around on ice, and the option of being able to knock over opponents adds a whole new dimension to the game. As with most sports games, it's most fun when two players are battling it out-especially when play starts getting rough! But even in one-player mode, Slapshot is brilliant fun and is highly recommended to fans of sports simulations.

"MEGADRIVE MACHINES HERZOG ZW BY TECNO SOFT The Herzog, in case you I didn't know (to be honest I didn't know till the Ed told me) was one of the Panzer range of tanks during World War Two. But Herzog Zwei isn't just a game about tanks It's actually a game of conquest played between two commanders in real time on one of eight variously tortuous terrains. Dotted around each landscape are eight or so bases and the objective is to capture all eight by building and deploying a robot army of soldiers, tanks and other vehicles. Each commander starts the game with one of the bases as his command centre. Other bases are empty, but the ones on specific order, and that canthe far side of the map be not be changed after conlong to the enemy. struction has finished.

Robots can only be programmed with one A pitched battle VIIIIIIIIII MEGADRIVE .90 Console strategy games like this are as rare as one-legged fish, which is hardly surprising considering the triggerpumping tastes of most console owners, but Herzog Zwei should hold the interest of all but the most mindless of blast-fans. What sets it apart from other strategy games is the fact that everything happens in real time. Both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken so you have to think on the move, or die. The computer is a ruthless, unremitting opponent even on the lowest difficulty level, so you won't stand much of a chance until you've fully got to grips with the different control modes and the command icons (they're fairly easy to grasp, even without English instructions). With two players, Herzog Zwei is very playable, though, and it's good to see another game that helps establish the Megadrive as a \"real\" computer, not just a machine for immobilised arcade players.

Shoot the attacking robots, picking up bonus items as you blast, and destroy the large mother-droid at the end of each area. Simple. The level one boss a bit of a pushover, this guy. IIIIIIIIIIII SEGA .95 At first glance, Assault City looks, to be blunt, a bit naff. But play it for a while and you'll be able to overlook the average, garishly-coloured graphics and flat sound effects and get into what turns out to be a very tough, challenging and surprisingly addictive shoot 'em up. I liked the idea of having the target practice difficulty selector at the beginning so much more enjoyable than picking a number from one to nine. The end of level baddies are a bit of a pushover but, having said that, you need to be a bit of a whizz just to reach the first guardian on the most difficult skill level. Admittedly, there are better shoot 'em ups on the Sega, but that's not to detract from the pleasure I had playing Assault City, a solid, honest-togoodness killing spree in the true sense of the phrase.
