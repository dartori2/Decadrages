Hope the .50 entry helped*. We're celebrating our 16th Christmas on CVG, it would have been such a shame to exclude you. So, hello to the new guys. Keep the noise down everyone else! But there's a lot to get rowdy about what with Louise (aah...) getting friendly with PaRappa (Lara ain't the only babe who loves PlayStation we discovered). Then there's the biggest Christmas games rallying to draw your attention away from her. Which one of the Nintendo 64 racers leaves the others behind? How fast will Sonic and pals have to run in order for Saturn to catch up? What happened to this year's great PlayStation racer? And where does Quake 2 fit in to all of this? We're gonna answer all those questions and more inside this special issue of CVG. In fact we care so much about all our readers having a great time out there that we've put together a 24-page Christmas buyers guide. Course, all you wanted was the free Virtual Pet book right? Well, you have fun cleaning up all the cyber crap. We're off to have the kind of senses-shattering fun that only video game masters are capable of. Join us if you're up to it!

We invited her along for a few reasons: a) we like her, b) we like her, c) we like her, and d) games aren't just for boys. Yes it's true. Which means, like it or not, there are a lot of girls out there who are salivating as much as the guys do over video games. Used to be a time when inviting the opposite sex round to your gaff required some hasty tidying away of evidence (we're on the subject of video games, remember!). But now, it's prac tically essential to have a PlayStation kicked under the TVkicked, thrown, dropped... whatever, it has to be casual right? So great. Let's play lots of games with girls okay! But wait! What does this mean about the kinds of games being developed right now? Scoring points for gossip? Mix and matching fashion accessories what? WHAT! Gentlemen. It is our duty to ensure that video games remain true to their roots. And that our female comrades learn to appreciate video games as we have before them. We're onto a good start: Louise loves PaRappa. Lessee now, a few carefully chosen steps on from there and over a period of a few months, involving a fair few private sessions one of us could easily have her going crazy over Street Fighter EX Pus Alpha! Write in and let us know what you think about the Louise story. But be careful what you say, because she's our mate!

Computer and Video Games uses DOLBY SURROUND to bench test all the latest games. It's almost a year since Paul returned from Japan with a couple of Tamagotchis in his suitcase. One for himself. One for Ed deemed strange enough to understand the idea without instructions. Now Tamagotchi is so popular in Britain, you can't buy them anywhere. Amazing how such a weird little toy can get a nation so fired up. This has caused us to think. A painful process, but here's the payoff: We guess CVG is on the brink of including more off-the-wall stuff like Tamagotchi. We set out to bring you the best representation of video game culture there is, and the box sitting under your TV (PlayStation, Saturn. N64...) is only a part of it. Since we love being a part of the whole video games thing so much, we trust you'll accept some of the funky new directions CVG is about to take IN ADDITION (we wouldn't lose the hard-core information) to the usual.

Apparently, so long as we put this little box here, CVG can get away with saying exactly what it likes, when it likes, in the manner it likes, and forever! Just to make it clear that everything written in CVG is based on our own personal opinion. Fact boxes which head the reviews comprise of information from the relevant companies, or is to the best of our knowledge. Also the news section of the magazine is full of information which we have found to be true, and is correct at the time of going to press. Basically if we say it's good, we think it's good. And when we say it's crap, we honestly think it's crap. We don't have any big organisation breathing over our shoulders influencing review scores or anything sordid like that. We're clean! Long live the truth! STEVE KEY f human life can be compared to cars, Steve Key is the kind you'd see in Max Power. Impressive then, always well presented. Fast, he's usually at work on time with time to spare. High fuel consumption, especially at office par ties. Popular with the women, speaks for itself.

Dear CVG I am intent on buying a Sony PlayStation, but I am not sure which games to purchase. I have selected a few games I am interested in and would like to know which games you recommend. Two games which I am not sure on which to buy are Area 51 and Crypt Killer. Could you please suggest one to me as I am worried that I will make a mistake on a purchase. Lately, I have been arguing with my brother about Tomb Raider, because we have both read the review of Tomb Raider 2 in #189 and both want to buy it. The only problem is that he wants to buy it on the PC and I want to buy it for the PlayStation when it's released. I am desperate to stop him from buying it when it comes out. Yours Sincerely Grant Bush, Chipstead, Surrey. Dear CVG, I would like to say something about Edward the Freak who said that he had a dream about the Spice Girls making a game in Issue #191. Because in issue #190 on the Freeplay section they were saying that there was talk about a Spice Girls game. Do you agree? Well tell me this. Why did the little liar get a free software prize? I want one for spotting this. P.S. What kind of name is Edward Yau and what kind of place is Hogganfield? Alan. SENSIBLE QUESTION SHOCK! Dear CVG. I been thinking about Oasis being made into a computer game. III William Curtis, Chesterfield. THE VOICES OF TORTURED SOULS Dear CVG, I'm glad to see that my favourite mag (you) has been covering Final Fantasy VII so much. However, I've just one small question which I'm sure other readers have on their minds (and it's been bugging me since I read in a rival mag last year that FFVII will take up over two Sony memory cards for just one save). I want to know how many blocks it takes up? Thanks for answering my question. I can now be prepared for the release of this legendary game. Chris Hinkley, Peckham. Dear CVG, I had a dream that I was stood on a cliff with a handglider, then I skipped to my school sports hall, then to a motorway where my dad was after this guy who had nicked off with my jackpot-winning lottery ticket. Then I was in Final Fantasy 7 as Barret, weird huh? Kyle A. Walker-Booth, Oldham. CVG: Just count yourselves lucky you don't have to deal with people like this every day. CVG: Hahahah hah ha! Maybe we could recommend some more games for you. How about The Fantastic Four? Iron Man XO Manowar? Oh wait, forget all that. Hard Boiled is the one for you! OK, all joking aside. DON'T buy either Crypt Killer or Area 51. If it's a gun game you want, get Time Crisis or Point Blank instead, as they're what we really recommend. Or you could stop the squabbling with your brother and let him buy Tomb Raider 2 and you buy Final Fantasy VII as well! It's easy when you think about it. Strewth! one for you! OK, all joking aside. CVG: We tested out a couple of cards in the office and you'll be pleased to know that for every game you save, it only takes up one of the fifteen slots. Two whole cards? Rubbish! BLOOD AND GUTS ROCK! Barret Dear CVG, I think PlayStations are utter s***, but there is one game I love and that is Resident Evil 2 (including the Directors Cut). I own a Saturn but I am concerned that neither will arrive on the Saturn. Also, when is Fighting Force coming out? Sean Edgeworth THE PHANTOM COMPO TO A CONCERNED BANK MANAGER.. CVG: Neither Resident Evil 2 nor the Directors Cut will be coming out on the Saturn. The DC is just a stop gap for all those PlayStation owners waiting for RE2. Fighting Force will be publishing before Christmas by Sega. LETTERS EXCLUSIVE: THE NEW SONY GAMEMAN Dear CVG, Bank Manager An Apology My bank manager is ripping out handfuls of hair and dropping kittens all over the place at the thought of Tomb Raider 2, Final Fantasy VII, Colony Wars and Time Crisis all being released in the same month. So to compensate Mr Tinklebottom, I just want to reassure you that neither the Walthamstow Dog Track, Jack Daniels or that massage place we both know will be getting any of my cash during November and December. Neil Stewart, Welwyn, Hertfordshire. Dear Sir, I've sent you this design of what I think the new Sony GameMan will look like because you're the best mag by far on the market. Dave Phillips, Pembrokeshire Answer = correct jeff goldblum starred as Dr lan Malcolm in Jurassic Park. Paul Carroll, aged 12. CVG: Yeah, right. We're the best mag on the market.

"NINTENDO IN BANKRUPT SHOCKER computer video games STAR LETER * HUMOUR! WE APPROVE! First off. I have to say that CVG is an excellent mag, but I heard a very startling rumour the other day. Last week my brother came home from college where he had heard from a friend who works in computers that Nintendo may be going bankrupt in the next year because the N64 is not selling well enough. Due to them going bankrupt, they will not be producing any more games for the N64. If this is so, what will happen to all the gamers who bought the N64 as there is not much point in having a games console with only six or seven games out for it? I am saving up to buy an N64 but was told to wait until about Christmas '98 to see if the rumours were true. But in '98 the new Sega machine will be out and may look better than the N64? Please find out if this is true as I have nearly  sitting in my bank waiting to be spent. Alan Inglis, Co. Kildure, Ireland. CVG: Nintendo are NOT going bankrupt. Fact. This mean they'll be keeping up their steady UK release schedule of one game every three months. But with an impressive Christmas line up Goldeneye, Lylat Wars and Diddy Kong the N64 could be for you. Oh and don't bother waiting for the Dural, it's going to be ages before it comes out over here. Dear CVG, I am writing to complain, not about the magazine which is great, but about E R Barwell. In issue 191 he sent in a list to get all the secrets and a few tips for Vandal Hearts. Well in the bottom left it says (under the address) not to send in anything copied from other maga zines, but guess what he's gone and done? The sad, pathetic *l#Censored#!* loser has read through issue 13 of Powerstation and copied the Vandal Hearts solution word for word and he's going to get a game for it! OK, if that's the case how about this groovy cheat for Sonic the Hedgehog on the Megadrive? On the title screen press: Up, Down, Left, Right, hold A and hit Start. You will now get a level select. Can I have FFVII for this incredible cheat which no one knew (and I didn't copy it from any other magazine)? SCORE James Scutcher, Exeter, Devon. 200 TIME 0:24 RINGS 31 CVG: Aahhh humour. Something we rarely see on these pages. And an absolute ly fantastic cheat as well! That deserves the star letter award in our opinion, so we'll get you a UK copy of Final Fantasy when it comes out. Cheeky sod. THE HEDGEHOG PIRACY IS COOL? SEGA 1991 Dear CVG, About Gusto's letter in issue 192. Why do you think Piracy is such a bad thing? Especially when you get dead cheap games. My mate has just got Micro Machines V3 for . OK it's not really fair on the publishers, but they make loads of money anyway. What's more he wouldn't have bought it at the current price of . Software distributors make millions every year and a CD only costs them  to make and that's steep. So what's the harm in buying in buying pirated CD's for ? In addition, why are CD recorders available for the relatively cheap price of  considering the amount of money that can be made from them when it is obvious that piracy is the main use for them. Visit a computer fair, enquire about CD recorders and they will tell you that it can copy up to three CDs an hour. Then they ask you what you want it for and you should say to copy games. They then go and find you one that can copy four CDs an hour. It appears to be a booming business at the moment. My friends can get me illegal CD's for my PC containing about 200 software packages zipped, including Win '95, Windows NT, Microsoft Office etc along with 100's of games for about . It seems the Government isn't too bothered either. Rarely will you hear about somebody actually being caught. Finally, in Spain I bought a 32-in-1 Game Boy cartridge for  in a shop that openly displayed different cartridge types including 500-in-1 Super NES carts. There doesn't seem to be any laws against it, so why is there in Britain? If you hadn't already noticed, I think piracy is a good thing. Please give me your view. Simon Waterhouse, Manchester. RANDOM MAIL BAG DROPPINGS THE VOICES OF TORTURED SOULS Dear CVG, Doom 64 is a good game and it is Doom. I've played it on PC, 32x, 3DO and PlayStation. N64 Doom is the best. N.Jobling, Glostershire. CVG: It's not often that we receive letters like this, which is a good thing. Sure you can pick up games for a fiver, but you run the risk of it not working on your machine, or even damaging it. We often review gold discs given to us by software companies, and they've damaged the laser inside normal PlayStations, even \"chipped\" ones. Gold discs can only be played safely on special blue PlayStations supplied by Sony, which are only available to for developers and reviewers. We do not condone piracy. Piracy damages revenue from games, which affects the companies who make them, and ulti mately raises the price of legitimate software. Not only is software piracy illegal and will get you into a lot of trouble should you get caught, but you could find yourself thousands of pounds out of pocket. Piracy sucks and we hope that most of our readers have the sense to understand that too. Dear CVG, Will Duke Nukem 64 include swearing, naked women etc? David Palmer, Derbyshire. CVG: No. Pervert. Dear CVG, Hey, you forgot there's already an official Spice Girls game for the PC and Mac. A spice Odyssey can be found at: http://www.pepsi.co.uk/promo. Syzygy by E-Mail BLOW UP YOUR PLAYSTATION CVG: Even better, why don't you try the following address for the shockwave game, Slap a Spice Girl! http://www.urban 75.com/Punch/spicebelt.html I am a PlayStation owner and have become interested in the new dual analogue pad, particularly the rumble pak. I was planning on getting Ace (or Air) Combat 2 with the new pad when they both come out over here. But I recently read that the English version of the pad will not feature the rumble pak. If so should I forget about the rumble pak and be happy with just analogue? No, my friend has a Japanese Pad and Japanese Ace Combat 2 and he says the jolt makes it much better. If I was to buy a Japanese pad, would it work on British games? And if the PAL pad won't be able to rumble, will the PAL games send out information to Japanese pads? I don't want to pay  odd to have my PlayStation chipped because I am just a poor boy. Barry Rimell, Brentwood, Essex. Dear CVG, The fools. They all said that CDs were superior to carts. But in the end my insane ramblings proved them wrong. AGAIN! Lylat Wars should shut everyone up about how crap carts are. Hoards of speech, loads of kick-ass cinema sequences, hundred ship dogfights. Square, take a page out of Nintendo's book. You don't need CDs to make a cinematic game. So you better make RPG for the 64DD... or else... James Kenny by E-Mail. SUIT CVG: The PAL PlayStation does indeed send out a signal to the Japanese pads. And that is \"Errr, don't understand must blow up.\" This is a warning! Japanese pads can blow up British PlayStations. DO NOT TRY TO USE THEM! The bad news is that the PAL pads will not have rumble paks in then, but to be honest,= they aren't that much cop anyway. CVG: Can you imagine FFVII on cartridge? It would take over 200 Mario 64 carts to make a game the size of FFVII. Sure there are loading times, but they are getting shorter all the time as programmers get to grips with the systems. 15 "


"computer video games What would you do if you had pop's sexiest super-crumpet, Louise, all to yourself for a whole day? If you're CVG, you make her play Parappa the Rapper. We sure know how to impress a woman... W SOUISE COVER STORY 6 "


"computer video games JOE CHIN t's like an alignment of the stars. On September 26th, PaRappa the Rapper arrived on PlayStation and went to No.6 in the all-formats charts. When released in Japan, it transformed people's perception of videogames. Beyond the gaming elite, suddenly everybody wanted a goschoolgirls, couples, toddlers, even your Aunty Gertrude. Why? Because Parappa is a music game, a simple rhythm toy that anyone can understand. And with its colourful cartoon characters, its appeal is universal. SUNNY FUNNY In the same week, Louise's new single, Arms Around The World, entered the charts at no.4. Her second album, Woman In Me, followed two weeks later. She was on the cover of FHM magazine for the second time (her first cover issue sold out), was voted fourth sexiest woman in the World, and launched her own book. On November 20th her No Sweat UK tour kicks off. A week after this issue of CVG hits the newstand. Yep, some events seem to transpire for a greater purpose. And with PaRappa paving the way for PlayStation to become more than just a games machine, we were presented with a golden opportunity. To team up Louise and Parappa the two hottest upcoming stars of the here and now. Could PaRappa seduce Louise with his musical charms? And would her obvious rhythmic talents meet his challenges? The chance to find out personally, while shooting our sexiest ever cover and getting all the latest gossip straight from Louise's lips... why you'd think it was Christmas. Ho ho ho! > HP HPE MASTER ONION MC KIMEKONG O   PHOTOGRAPHY: AMANDA SEARLE 17 "


"computer video games The game starts with PaRappa learning karate. So, have you done karate or martial arts? There've been times when I was twelve and watched Karate Kid and I'd wanna do it, you know, but I've never really done karate. What about at school. Were you picked on or anything like that? At school I kept myself to myself, nobody ever picked on me. Maybe if I was picked on I might have done [karate), but I was always my own person. 24A FUJI RHP \"Td like to do kickboxing. It's good for a woman to hold her own\" UUUUUUUUUUUUUUU D25A FUJI Think you'll need to learn self defence to protect yourself from mobs of fans? I'd like to do kickboxing or something, but as a form of keeping fit as well. I wouldn't do it seriously or take it up as a hobby. I think it's good for a woman to feel confident that she can hold her own if she was attacked. If I had the time I'd do something like that. What do you do to keep fit? I ride my bike a lot. About an hour at night if I can. But I'm going on tour on the 20th... What? On your bike? Haha, yeah. With a couple of big speakers on the back... Haha. Well I've got dance and band rehearsals in the next month, so that's how I'll keep fit. Have you been on tour before? In Eternal we did a tour, but this is my first solo one. Was there not a Naked tour? Not a big one. Just a few private shows. So are you nervous? Very nervous! It's nerve-wracking, especially in the pop industry and the part I'm in. You get to the stage where you've really got to prove yourself or people start questioning how good your vocal talent is, do you really sing your records and all that kind of crap. Everybody forgets that I was in a band for five years that was based on gospel harmony. What reaction have you had to your latest album? The album came out on October 6th and the single a few weeks before that. It went in at number four in the charts and I couldn't really have asked for more than that. People say you must not get nerves anymore, but with every single I release I get nervous, because you want to know how the public rate you. You were up against some big songs. Elton John and Oasis both had singles out that week. Yeh, I was in the best company. What about the weeks leading up to it? Did you have to do a lot of press events and stuff like that? Yeah loads. I mean the album was finished two or three months ago and it's been constant since then. A few TV shows, some magazines. It's important to keep your profile up. Do you find that you and Jamie [Redknapp) have a lot in common because you're a high profile couple at the moment? We don't talk about work and I don't go to football games. So he doesn't come home and talk about footy? Not to me no. I'm not really interested in football, he doesn't talk to me about it. As you've become more public have you had to become more aggressive or watch your image a lot more? No, I've never been told to be any way. The only advice Was it a tough school? No, I went to a stage school [Italia Conti School) so everybody was pretty dedicated to what they wanted to do. Nobody got involved with anybody else, you had your mates and you got on with it. I went to a really good school actually. It's pretty expensive isn't it? I had a scholarship and I had to work hard for it. A lot of people think if you go to a place like that you must have a lot of money, but 10% of people who go to stage school pay to go, the other 90% work hard and earn scholarships. What did you have to do to get the scholarship? At the age of eleven l auditioned with about five or six hundred other applicants. I had to read a poem, act a small scene, that sort of thing. In front of a big group of judges? Yeah, and because it was a scholarship from the council they only gave out one or two a year, so I was very lucky. Surely it wasn't luck? It was mostly, because at eleven you can't really tell can you? Have you always wanted to be involved in music? Yeah. What about getting into acting one day? Yeh, haha, a Kung Fu film. And you have to fight a big onion as well... A big-headed onion guy! Yeh, maybe I'd like to, one day. It depends. Right now I've only been away from Eternal for two years and it's going to take me a long time to establish myself as Louise. And also to reach the standard of music that I want to be at.

"computer video games like Fish and Chips. With mushy peas? How about jellied eels? Ooh no. I'm a vegetarian so I don't eat meat. I only eat fish when I really have to. Fish and chips just for a bit of protein. Vegetarians always eat fish... I wouldn't eat it on a regular basis. I would never just go and order fish in a restaurant. Say I'm going on tour... You hunt it. Haha, no. Once every now and again I'd just have a bit, because when I get tired my skin gets really bad. It gets dry because there's no protein in it. You should eat your mushy peas then! Yeh maybe! Orepis GOOD C BAD SCORE 20 I'm glad you know which way to go together? Only if we were in another country. If we were in Europe we might have all gone out. In the last year, my personal life has become very settled, so when I get time off I enjoy just going to dinner and spending time with people. Because if I go to a nightclub, I don't really see any of my mates. You just have an early night. Sounds like I'm really getting old before my time! (CRUNCH CRUNCH) So did you have a launch party for the album? I did for the last one but this one, no. You see, we were going to ask you if we could get tickets to the party if you were having one... Haha, if I have one, I'll send you tickets! And to your concert at Wembly? Yeah not a problem. If you could get backstage passes as well, that would be brilliant... Yeah no worries.

I got the Funky Flow Erm, we have to ask you about one particular level of the game. Basically, Parappa has baked this cake for his girlfriend, he's gone out on a date, he's just looking forward to getting that first kiss from her, when the cake upsets his stomach and he gets caught short. He races to the petrol station to use the toilet, but has to rap his way to the front of the queue... Hahaha. ... and we were just wondering, err, if you've ever been caught short? Come on guys! I want to be looked at as a lady! Do you honestly think I'd tell you if I've ever been caught short? So have you ever been caught short? NO! O B R RELY XCOREG U rapin BAD Crack, break, fix the door. you know PaRappa: tried and tested 100% successful on women. As proven by our flimsy excuse to meet Louise. Going back to the game, PaRappa bakes a cake for his girlfriend. Ever baked a cake for anybody? When I was younger I loved to bake cakes. I'm a useless cook, I could never cook you a dinner, but I could cook a really good cake. When I was about thirteen, fourteen, on a Sunday I'd be at home, and my nan and grandad would come round and we'd make a cake. I can make all cakes. Chocolate cake, carrot cake, fruit cake, everything you want. Do you still bake cakes? I really like making cakes, so if I had a day in and my boyfriend was in, I'd bake a cake. Does he cook? More than me. For you as well? Occasionally, if we're together. What's the best thing he's cooked for you? Pas... Pasta yes, haha. Pasta and sauce. He does a better job of it than I do though. What would you be doing if you weren't a singer? Not a cook obviously. Haha, no I wouldn't be a cook. I'd like to be a director. A film director? A music video director. With my own production company. Is that like a clue to an ambition you've got? Mmm, very much so. Are you looking into that? Yeh, it's hard to look into it right now, because I'm so busy with my own thing that trying to build up a company, have it in control and do it the way I'd want it to be done, I just don't know enough about it now. Do you find yourself saying \"I don't like that,\" or \"I do like that,» on your own music videos? Oh yeah, I get really involved in directing. With every director work for, the most important thing is that meet them and we get on really well. I can say \"Ooh really don't like this,\" or \"I really would like this, but at the same time I'm not one of these people that thinks my ideas are always the best, because they're not. If someone said to me \"Oh Lou that would look really crap,\" it would look really crap. What's the video you're most proud of? I think Naked was the strongest video. I used a guy called Jamie King for it and it's all done in a warehouse with dance routines, really strong dance routines. It wasn't a beauty video you know, because a lot of beauty videos are so easy just to take as an option and put a really nice light on you and sing. I like a little depth to a video, so that it means something else. Do you ever go to clubs and want to have a good dance, but think everybody is expecting a flashy dance routine? I never dance at a club, because of that reason. I really think one of two things. They'll think \"Oh look at her, she loves herself,\" and I would never dance outrageously, only bop! And two I can't really be bothered. Did you go to clubs with Eternal while you were LOUISE SHIRTS AUTOGRAPHED BY LOUISE! WIN 'EM!! Garments blessed by the hands of a goddess and they could be yours!

Answers on a postcard only to: Louise Is No.1 In My Books Comp. at the usual address. First two correct answers wins! What did you think of Parappa the Rapper then? The music rips off a lot of old skool hip hop tracks. Yeh. I think having the rap made it more interesting, because it was making me laugh. Knowing my brother, that would make him enjoy the game more. It makes it more fun. A bit of yaah, haaa, heeee, hoooo! So do you think anyone with a vaguely musical background, once they picked up the basics, would be away? Oh yeh, it's easy to get into. Do you think your musical talent helped you or do you think any old fool could get it? I think my musical talent did nothing for me there at all! It did. We showed it to the photographer and the rep from EMI and they both gave up as soon as they had to press more than one button! I think you just have to have a little bit of rhythm in there. Apart from that... You obviously play games a bit... Oh yeh! My brothers play all the time, so I'm always with them playing Virtua Fighter. I'm good at that. I can slaughter anyone at that! Seriously, I can! Which character do you play as? I play as the women! Especially the one with the really quick kicks. You mean Pai? She's just so quick. I can jump on everybody with her! Haha! That's your violent streak coming out now! That's how I relieve all my stress! Parappa's not really a game, more of a musical toy. What's your thoughts about future things like that? A musical interactive CD toy? Because I like music so much, something with a musical edge makes me more interested. If that game was just me driving around listening to the driver with no songs, I'd get bored in minutes. Because of the music I was enjoying it, listening to the songs I think most people in this day and age are into music of some sort. Do you think there's a scope for that kind of thing? Yes, I think so. Would you like to have your own videogame? Yes I'd love to. I could make all my dancers follow my steps!

"computer video games ARCA13 S JAMMA SHOW: TOP TEN ased Japan's leading arcade specialist magazine, GAMEST, polls we've compiled the definitive TOP 10 for what was hot at this year's JAMMA show. Other big announcements at the show included CAPCOM revealing that they are working on Vampire Hunter 2, Street Fighter EX 2 and Star Gladiator 2. Konami showed a 5 min animation sequence introducing the characters to a new fighting game called Battle Tryst. They also previewed a 42 inch Plasma Display cabinet, an industry first and possibly the future of arcade gaming!

Powered by the 1,000,000 polygon/sec Model 3, VO O.T has the most spectacular graphics ever seen. As before, all the stages are rotated in 3D, and the animation is unbelievably smooth. We expect even more details to be added to the stages as development progresses. Besides graphics, there have been some major changes in the controls: (i) The Dash Button has become the Turbo Button and is activated by pressing only ONE button! (ii) The Guard is no longer activated with the levers, instead you press BOTH Turbo Buttons. (iii) You can throw your opponent by getting in close and pressing BOTH Triggers and BOTH Buttons. (iv) By pressing both Turbo Buttons and operating the levers when close to your opponent you can perform a \"QUICK STEP\", where you can dodge their attack. (v) By pressing the Turbo Button and the Attack Button at the same time you can increase the strength of your attack. VO O.T will have 12 VirtuaRoids (the fighting robots), and each will have even more unique characteristics to enhance the game play. All have been redesigned and upgraded. New stages are also being planned with maybe even one underwater stage. SEGA want to increase the game's realism by having more interaction with the stage, for example, running through water will slow you down. Even the cabinets come with special 1P and 2P seats. On the 1P seat \"DNA\" is written, on the 2P seat \"RHQ\" is written. Rumour has it that these marks may indicate the different Virtualoid makers and so the game will feature different scenarios accordingly.

Konami are hoping to add another game to this list come January, with the release of Nagano Winter Olympics, featuring the official Olympic licence which allows Konami to use recreations of the real locations, including stadiums and mountains.

Snowboarding is a different kettle of fish, it's an all year round sport, because there's always snow in some part of the globe. A fact which Steep Slope Sliders hopes to convey, with their snow boarding party embarking on something of a world tour. Even if you can't afford to do it for real, you really shouldn't miss out on the fun of console-boarding. STEEP SLOPE SLIDERS She CAN YOU DO A FAKIE STALEFISH? BOARD AROUND THE WORLD It wouldn't be a snowboarding game without cool tricks, and Steep Slope is no exception. As well as getting huge air and turns off ramps, rocks, cars and houses, it's also possible to perform railslides on logs and fences around the courses. You can also perform tricks without even jumping. Mistys, Indy grabs and even Chicken Salads are all easy to pull off. Another unique feature is the control over your chosen boarder. You can move the board with the shoulder buttons, but the actual turning is made by shifting the weight of the rider. This is done with the use of the D-pad, and is just like steering. With this control method, it is easy to pull off a wide range of tricks. THE SATURN SNOWBOARDING CHAMPION There are four extreme courses to compete on. Where points are awarded for the best times, best tricks and best all-round score. Taking place in Russia, America, Japan and Italy, these courses are big. The best thing about Steep Slope Sliders, is that you have a fair degree of freedom. There are course boundaries, but not as restricting as you'd expect.

And it's twice the game its ancestor was. Yontside A1124-O0P360 Shift op HIIT ool boarders was something of a surprise hit at the beginning of the year. It was a good game, but we never expected so many of you would want to go out and buy it. Its makers, UEP Systems, obviously knew what was going to happen, for once the game was released they listened to all the criticisms and went back to the drawing board. The result is Cool Boarders 2: Killing Session, a game that is so improved upon the original it's really quite staggering. If you don't believe us, just look at what it has to offer. ONE MAKE JUMP HI I'M YAGGI, RIDE ME BIGGER, BADDER, BETTER COOL BOARDERS RETURNS While the original was a one-player only affair, the first improvement for the sequel is the two-player mode. With the help of a split-screen you can now go head-to-head in a number of different game modes. The first of these is Snow Boarding Combined a kind of snowboarding F1, where eight players compete to be the best. There are nine courses to survive through, for if you don't get enough points for the next round you're out! The races start similarly to a rally, with boarders setting-off at separate intervals. These places are determined by a jump contest that precedes each course, hence the event's name Snow Boarding Combined. This year, instead of merely selecting a male or female boarder, you now choose an actual rider. From here you can choose their clothes and board. Each rider has different attributes some better at tricks and jumping, others with better balance and speed. These same attributes are then given to the variety of boards on offer. There is even an option similar to Rage Racer, that allows you to design the graphics of your board. RECORD 1. 3 103 WEERS B3 BALANCE NNOT9&91 ECCANICOLE QUICKNESS PIWER KURSPEED Part Mid?

If you don't have them, run away and hide! quaresoft are known for their magnificent RPGs over the years, especially their fantastic Final Fantasy VII. Recently they've managed to gain respect in Japan for creating some of the best and most original fighting games in Tobal 2 and Bushido Blade. The latter is now coming to the UK, and has loads of interesting features for us to tell you about. If you thought that Soul Blade was as realistic as fighting games got, you were very wrong. BUSHIDO BLADE 00 ONE HIT WONDERS! REALISTIC SWORDFIGHTS FROM SQUARESOFT! The combat in Bushido Blade is completely different to other console fighting games. The characters don't have energy bars and there's no time limit. Instead, a fight finishes when a character takes a fatal blow to an important part of their body or surrenders because they are too badly injured. Limbs that have taken hits can't be used if your left arm is damaged you won't be able to throw your second weapon, for example. DON'T LOOK AT THE FINGER... As the fights are more realistic than other fighting games, defence is very important a single hit can kill, remember. You have four main buttons which let you block (a brief defence which lets you counterattack quickly) and hit at high, medium or low level. You also have buttons to change your centre of balance so that your character holds their weapon above their head, in front of them, or while crouching. Each position has its own moves and techniques, so it takes ages to master everything. REALIS 00 If both your legs are injured, you have to fight lying on your back! Like that bit in Reservoir Dogs. CRANIUM INTERNAL! COMING SOON There are a few different ways to play Bushido Blade. As well as the usual side-on 3D view, there's a mode where you view the action from your fighter's eyes. This makes the fights more intense as you can't see when your enemy is behind you. As it's possible to run around the giant arenas in Bushido Blade, this does happen quite often. You can also link two machines to have fights from the first-person perspective. 00 THE FIGHT OF YOUR LIFE! Bushido Blade is certainly very interesting. It's not the kind of game that anyone can play by bashing the buttons, but is going to be perfect for serious fight fans. We hope to have a final UK version for review very soon. so be ready for it! Before a fight you must choose a weapon. Each one makes your fighter play completely differently, so make sure you learn them carefully. 32 "

"omputer video James WAR/STRATEGY BY WESTWOOD STUDIOS  PC VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 2 CDS COMPLETE TM PlayStation NOV RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS  RELEASED BY VIRGIN TEL 0171 368 2255 PlayStation ommand & Conquer is one of the biggest PC games ever. It took war simulation games from being slow turn-based things into being real-time battles that anyone and everyone could get into. It's simple enough to play point at someone or something, then point where you want them to go, or what you want them to shoot. This sortof-sequel-but-not-quite, Red Alert, is now coming to PlayStation, and is looking as though it could be pretty much spot-on. More seat-of-your-soiled-pants battle strategy, as the sequel to Command & Conquer comes to PlayStation! COMMAND CONQUER REPEATERT $2400 OPTIONS ADOLF HITLER? NEVER HEARD OF HIM ENEMY EEK! A MOUSE! COMMAND & CONQUER SEQUEL HITS PLAYSTATION! Red Alert comes on two CDs, just like the original Command & Conquer. One is dedicated to the Allied Forces, the other is for the Soviets. The game is set during the Second World War, though there have been a few changes made. A scientist constructs a time machine to travel back in time and remove Hitler from history. As such, World War Two is between the Allied Forces (including Germany) and the Soviets! The technology is also less advanced than the first C&C which was set in the future. ENSTEIN TO HELICOPTES OPTIONS The PlayStation version of Red Alert includes features which were, to its fault, missing from the first console C&C. You can now use the PlayStation mouse, which really helps you to play quickly. And the best thing is that a link-up mode is included. Although not many people get around to playing link-up games, Red Alert is certainly worth the effort as it's one of the best multiplayer games on the PC. $0 FIND EINSTEIN OPTIONS UNIQUE UNITS COMING SOON There are some excellent units in Red Alert which weren't in the original C&C. There are now lots of different flying vehicles including choppers, bombers and paratroopers. There are some great water-based vehicles too, like submarines, battleships and small craft which carry vehicles and troops across water. One of the best new units is the spy. To you he shows up in a tuxedo, but to your enemy he looks like one of their troops! Make sure you avoid the alsatians though, as they can smell you straight away! Curse those evil Lada drivers! PLAYSTATION PLUS CODE RED! Red Alert comes on two CDs one for the Allied and one for the Soviet missions. Each one has loads of different missions with alternate routes through them. And on top of the original PC missions, a load of extras from the add-on packs are being included! We're big fans of Red Alert on the PC, so we're looking forward to the PlayStation version. Hopefully we'll get a finished version (or two) for review in time for next issue.  "

That's the simple reason behind Sensi. Made by fans, for fans. Now the original team have moved on a step further with Sensible Soccer 2000, which could be the last word in football games. The biggest change to this compared to other versions, is that you can now play the game as a coach as well as a player. Virtually every sort of option a player has, can be tinkered with. Whether they pass the ball sideways or through the middle. Who takes corners and who goes up for them. It may sound anal, but to real football fanatics it gives you the opportunity to customise your team completely to your needs. Get ready for another Sensi explosion. SENSIBLE WORLD OF SOCCER 2000 TIME CERLLES SONTE SE AWESOME NEW 3D SENSI SOCCER! DIY HEAVEN These are the replays that automatically appear once a goal has been scored. The camera position can be altered too. And here we see the player 'rounding' the goalkeeper. People who used to watch Fantasy Football will get that joke. As mentioned previously, 2000 can be customised to unimaginable levels. All of the comedy' custom teams (Kebab Shop, Essex Boys and Slagheap are some examples) are back, but these can be completed renamed to feature all of your own players. Player ratings, numbers, position, even hair type and colour can be changed, so your local team can be completely recreated. You can change cup options, like golden goal, penalties, replays, number of byes... We think you get the idea! FIELD OF DREAMS The game still features the same overhead view of the original, but this time it is slightly slanted to compliment the new 3D players. If anything the camera position is slightly further back because more of the pitch is in your field of vision. This makes for more intricate passing movements as you can see more of your players, and have more outlets when trying to knock the ball about.

The last of their current biggies is another meaty shoot-em up. SHADOW MASTER echanical Monsters. In Shadow Master they're everywhere. Scuttling around, dropping from the sky, even teleporting in-front of your face. It's all part of the Evil One's master plan, to drain the planets of the solar system of their natural resources. Of course, your mission is to stop this dictator. While the game may look like a corridor shooter, you're not on foot or in a spaceship. Instead you're behind the wheel of a massive buggy. This vehicle provides minimum protection, but offers a little more help. We can't figure out why the buggy is able to side step though. WU TANG KILLER BEES HEY, PRETTY BOY PSYGNOSIS TAKE US TO STRANGE ALIEN WORLDS Attack is the best form of defence. So you are shipped to the alien worlds the Evil One has already taken over. He's already turned the inhabitants of each planet into his bizarre mechanical monsters. The more menacing creatures possess a grotesque humanoid form. The really creepy ones resemble insects. Giant spiders and flies scurry around the levels. There are even tryphid plants and dragons thrown in for good measure. The first thing that grabs you about Shadow the business. Enemies shatter into hundreds of Master is the graphics. With some mean looking pieces, and there is dynamic lighting throughenemies and some of the best explosions seen out. Fire off your weapons and the whole screen in a game. There is no denying the game looks lights up in a blaze of neon coloured glory. This guard is enjoying a quiet stroll... ...and then boom! He is out of there. RODNEY WHO? There's no time to admire the fancy lighting, \"cos this bunch of misfits are rock hard. Hit 'em with everything you've got, and then some. The look of the game is based on the fantasy worlds created by respected artist Rodney Matthews. His work is heavily catalogued across the internet and much respected by fans. Matthews has illustrated over 70 album covers, including bands like Thin Lizzy, Magnum, Nazareth and prog-rock king Rick Wakeman. If your Dad had long hair and a handlebar moustache in the 70's, chances are some of these albums are in his record collection. WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL LURKS? This alien spider looks fierce. Once you blow it up there's another creature inside. Smaller inhabitants even run away in fear from this guy. Shame it's not a match for your weapons. With the hundreds of games out there this festive season, Shadow Master may have a tough time making a name for itself. It's looking good, but it's still too early to comment on the allimportant gameplay. More soon. 38 "

Responsible for a huge list of classic games, among them Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy and Guardian Heroes. There is no denying their skills at original character design and strong gameplay. What is even more surprising is their reluctance to make sequels. Every game they make introduces us to a whole new set of memorable characters, and they always manage to include a new twist in game design to keep you hooked. Mischief Makers is no exception. The main character is a robot maid out searching for her master. Her weird abilities include hovering around and baking weapons. TAKE A CHANCE ON CLANCE CLANCOIL WARNING: GAMING ORIGINALITY ON DISPLAY! You play Marina Liteyears, a robot maid and assistant to Professor Theo. Leaving the Earth they chance upon an SOS signal being emitted from the planet Clancer. Thinking the planet may not be safe, Marina has been sent to scan the planet. When she returns the Prof has been kidnapped. A large group of Clancers, the inhabitants of the planet have abducted him. Marina hears the cries for help in the distance, and so the adventure begins. THINGS TO DO IN CLANCER BEFORE YOU'RE DEAD There are many strange and bizarre inhabitants during Marina's quest, and lots of things to grab and jump on. Ms. HINT Fint!! If you give me 10 , I'll teach you something good!! These are springs that allow Marina to jump from platform to platform. They can also be positioned diagonally, to fling Marina across the stage. ROLL CLANBALL I've been captured by the Evil Empire? What are you gonna do to me? THE LAND OF MAKE BELIEVE The planet Clancer is split into five levels, each made up of ten stages. On each stage Marina must complete a specific objective. To finish a stage Marina must locate a blue star that warps her to the area. The stars only appear once your objectives have been completed. The first level is fairly straightforward, and acts as a training mode for the adventure ahead. Also hidden on each stage is a gold gem. In what is becoming the norm in Nintendo games at the moment, the gold gems, offer you a new surprise when all are collected. This friendly face will offer advice on how to complete a stage, or reveal new tactics. Her advice is yours in exchange for 10 red gems. Here four Clanballs are shaped like a windmill. Marina can grab onto a ball, and spin herself round. Each ball can also be stretched so you can get to new areas. COMING SOON talls MARINA MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND HEY GOOD LOOKING WHAT'S COOKING We can see why the Japanese have been raving about this game. Mischief features lots of ingenious new ideas that are surely gonna be imitated in the future. It's heading your way soon. Marina isn't equipped with special powers to protect herself, instead she has the ability to grab items and other characters. Shaking enemies often reveals bonus items. Being a maid has given Marina the ability to cook up new items. When you locate a Clanpot, items can be placed inside. Once there are enough items in the pot, give it a shake and new items can be produced. Mixing four bombs can produce a much larger Clanbomb. 40 "

"SONY PLAYSTATION computer video games \"Do not underestimate the power,» is what we were told. Those who did could be kicking themselves. The PlayStation has gone from strength to strength in the last year, and the titles lined up for the next twelve months don't look too bad either! TM PlayStation * FIVE GOLD RIN RESIDENT EVIL 2 Resident Evil 2 features amazing graphics and some genuinely scary moments. If you don't own the original, get the Director's Cut now or wait for the Platinum version in the spring. This game is going to be so good, you'll need incontinence pants to play it. If you're gagging for it already, there's a superb demo bundled with Resident Evil: The Directors Cut, which will give you just the teaser you need. Here's what to expect: Zombie policemen; zombie civilians, and zombies on fire! And the zombies twitch when they're on the floor. At one point you go into a gun shop to stock up on ammo where the owner gets munched by the undead who come smashing through the window! It really doesn't get better than this. tin 2 TEKKEN 3 Namco roll out the punches and get ready to smash everything else away with their home conversion of the arcade hit. Rumours about whether the PS could handle the size requirements of the game have been flitting around for ages now, but it's now almost certain that Tekken 3 is going to be a stand-alone product. All the characters will be included, all the moves and combos, and all the secret bosses. With this scheduled for a spring release in the UK, you may even see this on import by the turn of the year. SON METAL GEAR SOLID Konami are keeping this one firmly under wraps (all we've seen are a couple of promotional videos) and it's little wonder why. Their espionage spy thriller looks set to take the gaming world by storm when it's released in the middle of 1998. From the videos we've seen Metal Gear Solid looks set to exceed even Resident Evil in terms of atmosphere and graphical quality. Every last detail looks as though it's been covered, with characters' breath becoming visible on the colder levels. Look out for this, it's going to be featured very heavily in the next few months. WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? WEBURU GRAN TURISMO TELE The jewel in Sony's crown over the next year will be Namco. With releases like Time Crisis and Point Blank getting gamers stirring around the globe, the news that Tekken 3 is well into development will have people wetting themselves with delight. With Sega's AM divisions making some of the greatest driving games seemingly at will, Sony throw in their penny's worth with this racer developed by Sony Japan. The graphics are some of the most amazing on PlayStation, which you may think is a load of publicity waffle, but having seen pictures it certainly looks like a valid comment. The vehicles you drive are all real as well, so don't expect to climb into some supercar that travels insane speeds. We'll be featuring this in more detail in a couple of months, so keep your eyes peeled. PARAPPA THE RAPPER 2 Sony have also done a superb job of keeping the cool image of the machine intact. The PlayStation Skate Park, Even though Parappa has only just hit the shelves over here, Sony have confirmed that a sequel is in the works. As yet no details have been released so everything we have is just speculation. Parappa is still in the Japanese top thirty games, a year after its release and not even FFVII is in that chart now. In fact, Parappa has sold five times more copies than Biohazard! It just goes to show that original games sell, so support Parappa and buy both versions! And remember, \"Money, money, money is all you need!\" sponsoring the Premier League and Champions League football competitions A LOVELY BUNDLE! mean it's reaching homes in one form or another. Whatever happens, one thing is for sure If you're getting a PlayStation for Christmas, or are thinking about getting one, make sure you shop around. Such is the popularity of the machine at the moment, that companies will be falling over themselves to offer the best price. The machine still retails at  with one pad, so if you can get a 'Station with two pads, and one game for , you've got a good deal. Bundles with Parappa should be cheaper because the game only costs  anyway. Look out for offers with Time Crisis, FFVII or Tomb Raider 2. All fantastic games, so if you can get 'em a bit cheaper... PlayStation is here to stay. (50) Computer & Video Games Christmas Buyers Guide "


"SEGA SATURN computer video games al TM TM With stories about Blackbelt being the hottest info doing the rounds on the net at the moment, the web sites have turned their attention away from possibly the hottest line-up the Saturn has ever had! SEGA SATURN FIVE GOLD RINGS HOUSE OF THE DEAD  More blood, guts and gore arrive courtesy of House of the Dead. As light gun games go, you won't get any better! The good news for Saturn owners is that it's Sega only! Awesome! Sega came up trumps again with another gun game in the form of House of the Dead. The gore factor plays a big part, because this is overflowing with mucus, blood and bits of zombies once you've unloaded a few rounds into them. You also have a say in what routes are taken, as how quickly enemies are shot or whether hidden panels are removed, effects the path you take. If you haven't seen this in the arcade yet, walk in and it'll be the one that always has people playing it. That's how good it is. YUN 232800 2 STREET FIGHTER 3 The umpteenth Street Fighter game, but it still manages to provide that same classic gameplay you got with all the others. Only with a few more tweaks. A completely new set of characters with Ryu and Ken of course give even old pros someone new to master and it has the most comprehensive animation engine on any 2D fighting game. It will definitely need the RAM cart, but you can rest at ease because a game of this size would have tremendous difficulty working on a PlayStation. Street Fighter never dies, that much is certain. SHINING FORCE 3 Shining Force games still are some of the best RPG's on the Mega Drive. It came as no real surprise when this 3D version was announced to go head-to-head with Zelda 64. Those that remember the predecessors will be familiar with the view change that took place when you attacked an enemy. This has been suped-up to the max, and rotates and pans in and out in all it's polygonal glory. It's gameplay that really made these games and from the shots we saw, the characters and enemies all look like beefed up versions of their counterparts. Cool! BURNING RANGERS WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? It's the diversity of the Saturn that makes it such a good machine. We've already seen the potential the RAM cart has, with some The new game from Sonic Team is their true successor to NIGHTS. It features the same graphics engine, but is a totally different game altogether. The basic game sees you as a fire fighter of the future, a Burning Ranger. With high-tech armour shields adorning your body, the heat isn't a problem for you. People trapped in buildings need to be rescued before the structure collapses. The cool thing is that their location is completely random, as are the effects on the burning buildings. Ceilings, floors and walls all cave in, but you don't know when! absolutely fantastic 2D conversions of Capcom's fighting games. Marvel has all 5 VAMPIRE SAVIOUR the frames of animation and background details thanks the the memory device. With the AM departments releasing quality titles HIT left, right and centre and the first home Another Capcom arcade conversion. Well the chances are that if you own a Saturn it's these sort of games you bought it for! If Street Fighter is a sensible punch feast and Marvel is a simple action packed one, then this is plain insane! It features more characters than in previous outings, and a ton of new moves for each fighter. And it contains possibly the coolest fighting game character ever in the form of Jedah. The winged demon not only looks top dollar, but he also has some awesome Super EX moves! In one of them, he signs the opponent's life away! version of Quake set to appear on Sega's black box courtesy of Lobotomy, things are looking very LOVELY BUNDLE rosy. And maybe a proper Sonic platform game as well? Please! Some of the bundles the Saturn has had over the past months have been very impressive. Just before the last price drop, you were able to find a Saturn, two pads, VF2, Sega Rally and Virtua Cop all together! This year, with VF2 being eclipsed by Fighters Megamix, and Cop 2 stealing the limelight from its older brother, they are the games you should look for in any special deals. Res Evil, Duke and Quake would be a cool blood bundle, should anybody sell that. If you can get a light gun thrown in as well, then you have the ultimate Christmas package! (51 Vid. CL . B. Guide "


"NINTENDO 64 computer video games NINTENDO 64 After the initial worry about the time it took for official releases to hit the shelves, THE have finally got their act together and the run-up to Christmas with a quality line up. And they've lowered the price of games by ! Excellent. FIVE GOLD RINGS ZELDA 64 >If Nintendo can get the balance between the all new, superb 3D graphics and the same classic gameplay from the SNES version, then Zelda 64 is a guaranteed hit. And we can't wait! 40 This game will be the final arm-twisting decider for all those still wary about buying an N64. Link returns to Hyrule in what promises to be his biggest adventure yet it's going to be the first ever 32MB cartridge! Again, it doesn't look as though they've tinkered with the gameplay much, just given it a complete graphical overhaul! Those familiar with the older versions will go mad as all of the normal enemies have been included, right down to the skeletons and bomb spitting munchkins. It's a safe bet we'll be giving this loads of pages during next year! 2 SUPER MARIO 64 2 It's been confirmed that it's in the works, but other than that details are sparse. Something we do know is that it could well appear on 64DD only, but with the DD rumoured to be less expensive that won't matter too much. It will also feature the return of Mario's intrepid sidekick and brother Luigi, so can we assume that it'll be a two player game to boot? Whatever happens, people will be falling over themselves to get shots of this, so as soon as anything concrete is released, you can expect to see it in CVG. Cintredo 3 YOSHI'S ISLAND 64 Something of a surprise to the people who saw this, the newest version of Yoshi was the fact that it was 2D! But Nintendo have still managed a bit of graphical trickery as it pans in and out depending the action and what Yoshi is up to. There are a total of six different Yoshis to play as, each will have special abilities. For instance in Mario World when you had the Red Yoshi, it spat fire. It's these multi-coloured dinos that hold the key to game, as certain shades will be needed to get past certain levels. This looks lush, and promises to play just as well. 4 TUROK 2 Paved the way for third party licenses, Turok was the first decent game not to come out of Nintendo. The second game was confirmed almost as soon as the first touched down on these shores, but as yet no images have been released. We do know that the rumour suggesting it will be played looking through an over the shoulder view (Tomb Raider) is false, and it will retain the through-the-eyes-view of the original. We can also hope that the dinos manage to get into the city, and that Iguana can make it like the Lost World should have been. Fingers crossed. CASTLEVANIA 3D WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? Many people feel that the potential in the N64 still hasn't been utilised yet. As more and more programmers get to grips with the tools and machine itself, the titles are improving. For a start you have possibly the greatest game of all time available in Mario 64. Next came ISS 64, the most realistic football game on any system. A reworked classic in Lylat Wars and the simply awesome Goldeneye are also up for grabs officially. Then you have the 64DD on the horizon, with games already in development for it and the following five titles available next year. The future is most definitely bright for Nintendo Konami's newest Castlevania could well turn out to be what PlayStation owners thought they would be getting. Again, the processing speed and power of the N64 becomes apparent as Castlevania gets the 3D treatment. Once again the Belmont family are at the centre of attention, and Dracula has reincarnated to reek some havoc. There are a load of new characters in the game, one of which Corler, is the first to carry a gun. The standard whip weapon is back, and this can now be used to swing across divides as in pitfall. LOVELY BUNDLE! Well anything with Mario in it is OK, but they have been around for so long now that you should be looking for other stuff. Try keeping an eye out for a Lylat Wars and/or Goldeneye package or even Diddy Kong. If you can get two of those games in a pack, you're guaranteed good value. Sports fans should definitely get hold of ISS 64 whatever the costs. Because of the severe competition from Sony. Nintendo should be knocking out some really cool bargains this Christmas so keep those pinkies peeled. They've already knocked a tenner off games. A machine price cut next perhaps? "


"PO computer video games With the added power of 3Dfx, the PC has become the most powerful machine on the market. If you have the money to spend on a top-of-the-range model, do so, you won't be left feeling disappointed. ROM FIVE GOLD RINGS BLADE RUNNER > If you want a game that will amaze friends and family alike, then Blade Runner looks like the perfect candidate. It left us gobsmacked when we were treated to a video screening at ECTS, so who knows what's going to happen when the real thing arrives? Soiled pants perhaps? It made its debut at E3, and wowed punters even more at ECTS. The film was a huge success and has developed a cult following, and the game promises to be the same. It's the first realtime 3D game, which means stunning visuals to the nontechnical out there. The Al on the game is also superb. In your quest to find the replicants, questioning the citizens too strongly in crowded areas causes other people to listen in and get suspicious. Word of mouth spreads and the replicants want to kill you to save themselves. Cool 2 DAIKATANA LATIHAH SUTI It's John Romero's first game since he left id and it's the game he wanted Quake to be. Having created one of the most played games ever, he is hoping that Daikatana will follow in it's footsteps. The game will take place through four different time zones, from Ancient Greece to 500 years in the future. Each will have varying weaponry. You also go through the game the first time with two sidekicks and once it's been completed, your partners become playable. This will increase lastability as you have practically three different games to play. 3 POPULOUS 3 The original god game returns to install that feeling of power into everyone. Again, the 3D effect has popped into the proceedings, as Populous is now all polygons and flashy effects. You can now rotate and zoom the camera into all positions and get right into the action, and spells like volcano now happen in realtime. In other words, the molten mass rises from the grounds before unloading the lava. All very flash you understand. All new spells, and terrains to play on, this could prove the be all and end all of god sims. WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? The internet basically. AOL is really taking off in the UK now and with the prospect of free FORSAKEN local calls (as it is in America) it could We don't want to harp on about corridor games too much, as the PC is overflowing with them. But occasionally one comes along that demands attention. Forsaken is one of them. Imagine the scenario of Descent but with stacks of weapons and all the addictive qualities of Quake. The levels won't be restrained to space either, with rumours of even flying and underwater levels. It's also coming out on N64 and PlayStation, so it has the potential to be one of Acclaim's biggest titles ever. This could be the one to knock Quake of its high horse! become even bigger. Of course you have Quake and all the various servers you SOCCER NATION can play on around the World, which are always a superb laugh to play. And amous A football fan's heaven! That's the best way to describe Soccer Nation, the game that is set to revolutionise Internet gaming. This will be the first management game that you can play over the net. Potential Mr. Hoddles can log on and enter their team in a league You compete with other players for transfers and swaps, just like a real manager! You can customise your own players as well, and train them up over seasons to make them into new superstars! Nation will have a huge lifespan to it so as long as there is the Internet, there will be somebody playing around the globe. you have the original versions of C&C, which were always meant for PC. Then there's the future. At A LOVELY BUNDLE! first glance you have loads of corridor games, but dig a bit deeper and you'll find more than It's hard really to recommend any particular packages for the PC as there are so many to start with. Obviously money will dictate how much you're going to buy, so we'll have to assume that you've got a 3Dfx machine at least. If that's the case look for Hexen 2, Quake 2 or Grand Theft Auto packages. Anything with those in it will be well worth a peek. Also, try and get Internet connection because AOL and IRC are a really good laugh and can often provide hours more entertainment than the best games. Expect a sky high phone bill for the first couple of months though! that. A hell of a lot more... "

Only to do this he needs to becomecool by learning kung-fu, getting a car, learning how to drive, how to cook and so on. To do this, he seeks out masters in their field and they teach him the ropes through rap music. Each level is like an amazing cartoon with full 3D graphics, only the characters are paper-thin. Similar to the old Simon Says game, you have to match the rap of the master, by hitting the correct buttons. Get the raps right and you pass each test. Improve on them and you get the chance to freestyle rap on your own. Mess up though, and the music gets weirder and your master gets angrier. PaRappa is excellent fun for anyone of any age. And the music based on real old skool hip hop is the coolest ever heard in a game. This game will, without a doubt, open doors to new forms of mass-appeal videogame entertainment.

This is an excellent conversion of the original looking, sounding and playing superbly. And the arcade feel is brought home perfectly thanks to the inclusion of Namco's own PlayStation light-gun which matches the arcade for accuracy (there's a button for ducking, or you can step on a second pad). But, best of all, there's a completely new eight-level PlayStation game, which beats the arcade mode!

The multi-player mode is missing, but then it was always the one-player game that made Duke Nukem so addicitve and that has been perfectly reproduced. You play the Duke himself, a sleazy drawling bounty hunter who has to save Earth from aliens who've stolen our women and it all takes place in high-paced gory fashion. Each of the levels is filled with superbly constructed set-pieces, from peep shows and filthy magazine shops, to the set of the Duke Nukem movie (complete with cardboard scenery of an earlier level). There's also a excellently cheesy sense of humour throughout Duke can pay dancing girls to flash their breasts, to which he mutters \"shake it baby!\" Saturn Nukem even has new lighting effects, with rockets and explosions illuminating the walls. A brilliant showcase of the machine's abilities. And to top it all, there's a hidden multiplayer game called Death Tank which we've been playing non-stop in this office. In all, an essential Saturn title! 20010 LOGO The Saturn excels at fighting games, and Fighters Megamix is the number one choice to get simply because It's been designed so clearly as the ultimate two-player beat 'em up! Made by Virtua Fighter creators, AM2, it has over 32 fighters, including all eleven Virtua Fighters. Add to this the eleven fighters from another AM2 hit, Fighting Vipers, and it would seem you have two top arcade beat 'em ups in the ultimate crossover! The truth though, is that you're getting far more. There are TEN extra fighters that you earn by completing single player challenges. Stars from other AM2 games Virtua Fighter Kids, Janet from Virtua Cop, and even the Daytona car! Better still, the Virtua Fighters have most of their VF3 moves, and Janet plays near identically to Aoi from VF3! With its over-flashy Vipers style combat (which is still dominant even in VF mode) it's a weaker fighting game than VF2. And the computer Al is embarrassing. But the multi-fighter mayhem makes it an everlasting two-player experience. And surely that's what fighting games are all about. Computer . Vid. . . CL . R. G.. . "

Taking the tried and trusted Street Fighter gameplay, you can perform super hero variations of fireballs, dragon punches and counters (finger lasers, spider-stings and the like). However, the 'powered-up' nature of the characters makes battles more 'luckbased'. It also makes them incredibly spectacular. An amazing experience! in the arcades SNK's fighting games are recognised as the finest by the hardcore gamers. And in the home, only the Saturn caters for them. King Of Fighters '96 is currently only available in Japan (with the new Sega RAM cart which also works with Marvel Super Heroes). However, Sega have released King Of Fighters '95 over here, and both are spot-on conversions that are truly excellent. Although dedicated fans can tell you the differences, the bottom line is this you get loads of characters, the chance to edit them into excellent teams (for awesome multiplayer battles) and the gameplay is as skilled as it gets. If you want to master fighting games, and you know Street Fighter, it's time to learn King Of Fighters.

But with 007 back on the job this Christmas, we're all Bond bonkers anyway and Goldeneye is gob-smackingly brilliant. It's exactly what you'd want from a Bond game. The chance to play the suavest secret agent ever, through his eyes, on covert missions. Fans of the film will recognise the stages the bungee jump off the dam, the facility where you meet 006, you even get to drive a tank. There's a excellent selection of weapons, from Bond's trademark Walther PPK (with silencer), to a KF7 Soviet machine gun. Shooting people willy.nilly though, isn't what it's all about. The computer-intelligence is very clever, and you'll have the whole army gunning you down. Silenced shots to the head take out guards, hit them in the legs and they stagger. Hit their comrades and they run off for help! Harmless scientists sometimes turn on you if you try killing them too. On top of all this, they all have textured-mapped faces, including the main characters. So 006 is Sean Bean, Valentin is Robbie Coltrane and Xenia Onatopp is Famke Janssen.

Lylat Wars features some epic missions. The most impressive featuring a massive ID4-style with swarms of fighters spilling out of it. It's challenging too, with different routes and fantastic-looking warp levels. Plus there's a super-addictive four-player battle mode.

Perfect for Christmas, and for life too! mong the many soccer games out there, the N64 has two. FIFA 64, which has to rate as one of the worst, and ISS 64, which is possibly the best, alongside its PlayStation brother. What makes ISS64 shine beyond even the PlayStation ISS Pro, is its awesome graphics. The motion-captured players (while a bit blurry) move with amazing realism. They look toward the box before crossing, stagger after being shoulder barged, even pull the ball from the back of the net while looking dejected. It's not like this animation slows the responsiveness either. There's an amazing amount of moves, from overhead flicks and dummies, to humiliating the opposition by playfully keeping the ball up with the analogue control too, you can swivel your players about with perfect precision. 3 :00 There are a few minor faults, mainly that you can slip some cheesy goal scoring techniques in. All-inall though, the computer's artificial intelligence is very impressive, providing some super-realistic pitch situations. Superb fun with four-players too. Make sure you get this, not FIFA!

In single player the story follows that Hitler didn't exist and the Russian's and Allies have been fighting ever since, thus allowing for decades of hardened weaponry to evolve. In multiplayer though, it really comes into its own. Building war factories, developing nukes, sending your tanks against enemy Tesla shields, or using a spy to enter other player's bases. It's as cunning challenge and as awesome as games get!

Although the 97/98 pack is labelled as an add-on, it's a self-contained game allowing you to control the most up-to-date teams and player set-ups. This is as realistic as you could imagine team management could be. It's so detailed. There's infinite ways you can set up your formations, including the Christmas tree variation. And your players suffer from so many real problems injury and fear. Faced with a good opposition, their abilities can plummet. You can also get lumbered with dirty players, continually fouling. Hell, you can even be sacked and look for new vacancies as the game continues! Top stuff!  PLAYSTATION VERSION  PRICE 299.99 AVAILABLE  STORAGE 2 CDs  NO OTHER VERSION  RELEASED BY VIRGIN PLANNED . TEL: 0171 368 2255 SO veryone would love the chance to pilot a space fighter in the Star Wars Universe. Lucas gave PC owners a chance previously with X-Wing and then TIE Fighter. This is the culmination of the two, where you can finally set yourselves up in multiplayer squadrons and face real human foes, for Rebel vs Empire battles. Unlike the previous two, the presentation is spartan and there's no involving plot. This is far more of a network game, but in that respect, it is brilliant. A range of oneon-one, deathmatch and full-on space saga scenarios are available. The graphics too, are as impressive as you could hope to see right now, especially with the new 3DFX version. Definitely recommended for network or modem players.

Perhaps, but this time the battle ground is history itself. Again you control a group of units, gather resources, fight battles, research new technologies, and try to win the game, but this time it's over periods of centuries, not turns. You control one of twelve civilizations, each with its own technological advantages. Age of Empires uses 3D terrain, meaning height affects movement speed. There are campaigns based on fact and mythology too. Take control of Alexander the Great or Jason and the Argonauts. Special mention must go to the various death animations, as horses rear back and throw their riders, elephants get toppled, chariots upended and bodies get tossed all over the screen. lying Corps is a realistic simulation of air combat, set during World War One. Due to the basic nature of the craft, controls are relatively simple. Engagaing in combat is where the real skill is involved, and keeping Von Richthofen off your tail. Basic training gets the beginners airborne and barn-storming in no time. The game really comes alive in the campaign sections. Here the player gets the chance to rewrite history by taking part in the Great War's more famous moments. The graphcis are very realistic, with the aircraft supposedly handling just like the real thing. The game comes packaged with terrain maps and a complete replica pilots manual! For flight-sim enthusaists this games seems heaven sent. Amazing!

This time from the makers of the hugely succesful Warcraft, and this time set in space for ultimate cosmic warfare. There are three races to choose from the humans, of course, in the form of the Terrains; the Zergs, which biologically hatches new technologies, and the Protoss, a superadvanced race with awesome technology. Fans of Warcraft will be familiar with the gameplay, but get to use all new space-age vehicles and weapons. And of course, the terrain is, more often than not, the infinite void of space! There's a number of reasons PC owners should reoice at having this game. Number 1, this is only machine except PlayStation that's ever going to get it. Number 2, it's totally brilliant. And Number 3, it looks even better on PC if you have 3DFX. All the awesome features, levels and animation of PlayStation Tomb Raider 2 are here (read about it earlier in this guide), which means you're getting one of the best 3D platform games in existence. 3DFX owners though, get added lighting effects, awesome translucency on the water and brilliantly smooth textures, matching the boastful Mario 64 at its own flashy game.

LucasArts' authority on the genre. Tentacle is the superior sequel to Maniac Mansion, and really has some of the best puzzles to be seen in any game. Sam & Max is just oddball, and it knows it.

Only earlier this year have they managed to catch up, hence the imminent Unlimited '98. In it's day this was revolutionary, and is still a joy to play.

"DEAR SANTA Vou've got your games machine, and now you need some extras to enhance your gaming. Here's a selection of what's available on all the main formats this Christmas, as well as all sorts of games-related goodies which you can get your hands on. Look carefully this guide will be invaluable when writing your letter to Santa. ATARI SHIRT .99 Featuring the excellent original Atari logo in shiny silver. The best Atari-related thing for the last 10 years. ATARI WIPEOUT 2097 SOUNDTRACK Lots of tracks by top dance artists from the game, plus some extra tracks including a few from the first WipEout. The biggest downer is that Firestarter is the in-game instrumental version which is incredibly boring when you're not racing. WIDE SCREEN VIDEOS These should be easy enough to find. Double Dragon is also available on rental only, but we wouldn't advise watching it. It's really, really bad. TOP GEAR STEERING WHEEL SYSTEM: SATURN, PLAYSTATION, NINTENDO 64 BY: LOGIC 3 PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 0181 902 2211 NOTANG IN THIS WORLD HASTALARID YOU TO THIS STREET FIGHTER (Cert 12) Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Raul Julia and Kylie Minogue. Cheesy acting, cheesy plot, cheesy everything which makes it kind of funny. Worth a laugh, especially at Carlos Blanka. Ha ha. MORIR KOMBAT You can tell that the Top Gear is quality straight away. It looks excellent, it's solid and the steering wheel's got a mock-leather grip for heaven's sake. As well as pedals, it has a gearstick to add to the feeling of driving. Fantastic, and not overly-expensive! MORTAL KOMBAT (Cert 15) Starring Christopher Lambert. The plot is ripped off from loads of martial arts movies, and is as corny as they come. Most of the movie is intensely boring, but it's worth watching for the Scorpion/Johnny Cage and Liu Kang/Reptile fights. And to laugh at the terrible Goro monster. PUMP ACTION GUN SYSTEM: SATURN, PLAYSTATION BY: ACCESS LINE PRICE: .99 CONTACT: www.guillemot.com/uk/ YOSHI COOKIES The food of the game! Very hard to get hold of (you'll need to try proper Japanese shops like those in the Yaohan Plaza in Colindale). They cost around .70 a box and are very tasty indeed. Made with real Yoshi dinosaur eggs. The main novelty of this gun is that you can reload by pumping the front of it like a shotgun if you want. The gun itself is very accurate and fast, and the autofire and auto reload modes work brilliantly. Definitely one of the best guns you can get. "

It also has a recoil feature, though when playing it basically just means that the gun rattles and clicks REALLY LOUDLY! It works with Time Crisis as well, though it doesn't fire rapidly as you'd expect from the noise it makes. An interesting novelty rather than a brilliant gun. Comes with a set of decent foot-pedals and the ability to reconfigure any button any way you want. The Nintendo 64 doesn't have enough good driving games to make the V3 essential, but it's fun if you've got the money. PLAYSTATION ANALOGUE PAD SYSTEM: PLAYSTATION BY: SONY PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 0171 447 1600 SONY Playstation ANALOG SELECT The original Japanese version shook and rumbled with certain games, but this has been removed for the UK pad. We don't recommend buying Japanese import versions for the rumble, as they've been known to blow up UK PlayStations. The pad has all the features of the standard Sony PlayStation pad, only with the extra two analogue sticks. Driving games and flight sims work especially well with the analogue sticks. A great pad. PREDATOR SPACE HVADERS PREDATOR SYSTEM: SATURN PLAYSTATION BY: LOGIC 3 PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 0181 902 2211 SPACE INVADERS SHIRT The Predator is an impressive looking gun, with red lights along the side which flash as you play. The trigger moves too far, so it's hard to shoot quickly and the thing itself is too heavy. It's also not always 100% accurate which will ruin any gun game. .99 The name of the classic game on blue. Not very exciting, but cool in a sort of not-cool retro way. And it's nice and cheap. "


"HOT GEAR PS ARCADE STICK SYSTEM: PLAYSTATION BY: INTERACT PRICE: $44.99 CONTACT: www. interact-acc.com PROGRAM PAD SYSTEM: PLAYSTATION BY: INTERACT PRICE: .99 CONTACT: www.interact-acc.com The see-through casing makes the Interact Program Pad look pretty uncool, but it works perfectly especially with fighting games. The button layout is more arcadey and the D-pad itself is very accurate. The program feature works well, letting you put special moves onto a single button (as long as you remember to program the diagonals). Definitely one of the best third-party pads you can buy. The PS Arcade has a solid heavy base which is just the right shape for resting your right hand comfortably while playing. The microswitched stick (the loud clicky style) is accurate and tough enough to put up with most people's stick techniques. The eight buttons work well and have a decent autofire option if you want. Excellent for arcade fighting games. SHARKPAD PRO 64 SYSTEM: NINTENDO 64 BY: INTERACT PRICE: .99 CONTACT: www. interact-acc.com As with most N64 pads, the SharkPad Pro looks like a jellyfish. The C-buttons are bigger than the standard Nintendo pad, making it better for fighting games, but in analogue mode it's not so good. The Z-trigger is an awkward shape and the pad design means that it isn't comfortable to use. ARCADE SHARK SYSTEM: NINTENDO 64 BY: INTERACT PRICE: .99 CONTACT: www.interact-acc.com The Arcade Shark has two stick bases and comes with one detachable stick which can be screwed into either place. In digital mode (the far left stick) it works well, but in analogue mode (the way most games play) it's not great. Good for Mario 64 though. HYPER DRIVE SYSTEM: PLAYSTATION BY: FIRE PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 01302 325225 (www.fireinternational.ltd.uk) MODE SELECT START A standard pad with slow motion, turbo fire and a steering wheel around the outside of the pad.

"HOT GEAR computer video games OFFICIAL SATURN PAD SYSTEM: SATURN BY: SEGA PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 0181 996 4620 SEGA SATU STAFET The pad which comes with all new Saturns is a thousand times better than the terrible spoon pad Sega US came up with in the first place. The shape is just right, and the D-pad is completely accurate. The button layout makes it great for fast arcade games and the Land R buttons on the top are great. It's not as cool-looking as the PlayStation pad, but it's one of the best console pads made. Get one. TRIDENT PRO PAD SYSTEM: NINTENDO 64 BY: LOGIC 3 PRICE: CONTACT: 0181 902 2211 ASCII GRIP SYSTEM: PLAYSTATION BY: ASCII PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 01923 202097 TRIDENT PROPAD The underside of the Trident is cut away, making it very uncomfortable to hold after a while. The 3D Stick is very bad, often moving to the left or right on its own. The L and R buttons are badly placed and the C-buttons are too close together. Don't bother with it. Designed for use in just one hand, the Ascii Grip has the buttons surrounding the D-pad and on the underside. It's practically useless for fast-paced games, or anything requiring more than one button to be pressed at once. It's okay for slow things like RPGs, but is otherwise only worthwhile if you break an arm and want to still play games. FIGHTER STICK SYSTEM: PLAYSTATION BY: ASCII PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 01923 202097 ASCII OFFICIAL PLAYSTATION PAD SYSTEM: PLAYSTATION BY: SONY PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 0171 447 1600 Obviously designed for arcade fighting game conversions, the Fighter Stick has a decent microswitched stick and big buttons. The base is solid, but not a brilliant shape. Okay, but a bit pricey for what it is. The standard PlayStation pad is still one of the best things for the machine. It's perfect for games made for the PlayStation like WipEout, but isn't too good for arcade conversions like Street Fighter Alpha 2. The D-pad itself is extremely accurate but the lack of diagonals can make playing some games a bit fiddly. Everyone's got at least one of these, and it's an excellent choice for an allround second pad. VRF IX-CELLERATOR SYSTEM: SATURN, PLAYSTATION, NINTENDO 64 BY: FIRE PRICE: .99 CONTACT: 01302 325225 (www.fire-international.Itd.uk) ON The buttons on the X-Cellerator wheel are very big. It makes them easy to use while playing, but they don't look particularly cool. The pedals are too light and are designed so that they often tip over while you're playing. The wheel itself is good though. (67) Computer & Video Games Christmas Buyers Guide "

The top L and R buttons are also a slightly fiddly shape. The D-pad is accurate and the pad works well enough, but it's just not one of the best. It doesn't look very good see-through casing with nasty tan plastic inside. It works well enough with platform games and the like, but fighting games normally require all six buttons to be on the front of the pad. There are better pads available. SWIFTPAD JAPANESE GAME SOUNDTRACKS Hard to get hold of, but are available from some big music shops, including Tower Records in London Games like Final Fantasy VII, Tekken 3, and Street Fighter 3 all have decent CD soundtracks with both game music and remixed instrumental tracks.

The connections are fairly solid, but if someone trips over the cable there's a chance it'll come loose and disconnect you. Remove any big pets from the room before use. The standard Nintendo 64 pad is perfectly designed for games such as Super Mario 64, but the button layout (and tiny yellow C. buttons) makes it pretty bad for arcade-style games. Most Nintendo 64 games are designed with this pad in mind, making it the best thing you can buy as a second pad. And as an added bonus, it's available in loads of lovely colours CYCLONE BD SYSTEM: PC BY: INTERACT PRICE: .99 CONTACT: www.interactacc.com EASY 64 SYSTEM: NINTENDO 64 BY: ACCESS LINE PRICE: .99 CONTACT: www. guillemot.com/uk EASY The Cyclone 3D has more buttons than most joysticks 17, in fact. They can all be programmed to do whatever you want. The stick itself moves strangely, and takes a bit of forcing to get in the full lock position. It's not bad if you can afford it. The Easy 64 is a really bad shape. It's uncomfortable to hold in any position and feels cheap. The main buttons are bigger than usual but have to be pushed right down to do anything. The 3D stick is very bad as well, as it's too sensitive with small movements and inaccurate with large ones. Very bad. (68) Computer & Video Games Christmas Buyers Guide "

It's ideal for 3D games, especially corridor games where you can imagine that the big rubber ball is your character's head. Pushing and turning it in any direction moves your character, placing both the keyboard and mouse control onto one hand. It's not going to suit everyone, and takes a lot of getting used to, but is fantastic for those with enough finger strength. The shape is almost the same as the standard Sony pad, only with a different D-pad, smaller buttons and a slow motion button. The buttons are slightly too small, in fact, with a big space between them. The D-pad isn't very responsive either, making it bad for quick action games. Not good.

Sonic's already had a go at fighting, and now he's taken up track racing! SONIC RS RINGS 00:12.40 here was a time when Sonic The Hedgehog was one of the most well-known people in the world and he's not even real! His Mega Drive games did brilliantly, leading the boost in video game popularity at the time. After a break from the limelight, Sonic reappeared with a bunch of new games as part of what Sega call «Project Sonic\". The latest of these is Sonic R-a racing game starring the Green Hill Zone favourites around familiar locations in complete 3D! 00:12 10 00:1 2ND 3RD 4TH RINGS 85 02:49.23 88a SKO SEGA EUROPE LIMITED SPECIAL THANKS NDREAS VON GLISZCZYNSKI THORSTEN MOE TINA SAKOWSKY RICHARD LEADBETTER PAUL DAVIES TOM GUISE ED LOMAS DANIEL JEVONS JOSE ALLER RING-A-DING-A-DING! PONOS Complete the game and watch the end credits for some surprise names in the \"Special Thanks\" section! RINGSO 00:25.93 Sonic's trademark gold rings are dotted all around the race tracks, and they're not just for decoration. On the floor you'll notice the occasional silver speed-up arrow with a UFO hovering above it. Running over the arrow shoots you along the track with an orange trail out the back, a bit like the stunt ribbon in NIGHTS. The arrow also steers you along the track during the speed burst! Each go on the speed-up costs you rings, and the more you have when you touch it, the further along the track you go! There are also locked yellow doors which can only be opened when you're carrying at least the number of rings shown on the screen at the top. The doors with higher numbers are worth going through, as they often lead to good shortcuts and bonuses. N 01:03.80 00 00 00 A MATCH MADE IN LIVERPOOL! SPEED-UP Although Sonic R is a Sonic The Hedgehog game, it's not been entirely developed by the original Sonic Team. They came up with game idea, designed the look of the game, the characters, the course layouts and pretty much everything about it. But it's Traveller's Tales who programmed the game-right here in good old Britain! Sonic Team were impressed with their work on Mega Drive games such as Mickey Mania and got Traveller's Tales to do Sonic 3D for them. They've really shown how good they are with Sonic R though, as it shows loads of fantastic new graphical effects on the Saturn, many of which Traveller's Tales say would be impossible to do on the PlayStation. Nice one! 00/5 Collect all five Sonic coins on a stage then go on to win the race and you get... we're not telling! It's a surprise!

"Fids 72 SD 00:19.2 THE MOBIUS GRAND PRIX! * computer video games To begin with there are four race tracks set in areas based on classic Sonic game zones. Each one has loads of different routes and shortcuts, shown on the map in the bottom corner of the screen, as well as different hazards and features which match the style of the graphics. RESORT ISLAND RADICAL CITY SATURN 00:32.86 00 32. 86 00 00.00 00:00.00 2NE As with every Sonic game there's ever been, the first part is set in Sonic's jungle homeworld. Hills, loops, waterfalls, palm trees and everything else you'd expect to find are here. The big expanses of water can be used as shortcuts with certain characters (the ones who can drive on water), while the others need to find the water barrier power-up. Strangely, this is one of the tougher tracks to learn as there are lots of places where it's possible to run off the edges of the main track. A Sonic game wouldn't be right without a night-time casino level. Radical City is set on lots of sweep ing aerial tracks which go in and out of massive gambling machines and an enormous pinball table. Neon lights flash everywhere you go, and there are plenty of opportunities for collecting valuable rings. 120 RINGS RINGS 23 00:39.96 00:01:33 23:20 OD 0220 00 00 00 00:09. 96 00:00 00 00:00 00 02:23. 40 BE 01.57.23 00 26. 16 00.00.00 15T 2ND BRE AGUS 13 00-88.26 RINGS 33 01:23.03 01.06.10 00.91.50 OD D5 26 00 OD OD REACTIVE FACTORY SONIC R Lots of high-tech fast runways around pools of chemicals. Multiple routes on ground level often involve jumping through cone barriers and over the liquid to reach new areas. The coolest part is a long sweeping banked corner towards the the end of the track. You need to make sure you've got quite a bit of speed up when running around it or you could end up dropping off. REGAL RUINS RADIANT EMERALD 00:26.66 00:26.66 00.00.00 OD OD. OD Lots of sharp right-angle corners with steep slopes, sets of steps and loose pillars to dodge. Learning routes through the course so that you can avoid the slower, tighter parts is essential if you want to do well in races here. Also, character selection is important as some racers are better at getting up and down the large staircases around the Regal Ruin. At the end of the four original tracks you get to take on Radiant Emerald. The track is made out of a beautiful translucent material, and runs around through space. The graphics here are especially impressive, with some of the best transparency effects yet seen on the Saturn. It's reminiscent of Mario Kart 64's Rainbow Road circuit, only Radiant Emerald is a hundred times more interesting that that boring heap of crap.

"computer video h YOU CAN GO YOUR OWN WAY Although Sonic R is a track racing game, it plays a lot like the 3D Sonic World section of Sonic Jam. The main circuit is marked out but there are lots of alternate routes to take in the race. Some are obvious where the course simply splits into two, but there are lots of hidden shortcuts which can be taken as well. Most of the routes are shown on the map for each course which is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the screen while you're racing. Some routes are better for collecting rings, some are better for getting quick lap times, while some are better for different characters. It takes a while to find your favourite way through a race. SATURN D 00:38,76 RINGS 13 00:13.10 0868 00 00 00 CO DO 80 THE GREEN HILL GANG THE LORDS OF CHAOS! ** You start with a choice of five characters, each with their own abilities and racing style. As well as the characters you start with there are a few secret ones which are worth finding. We don't want to ruin the game for you, but we'll let you know that they're all fairly familiar in a kind of robotic sort of way. One of the many challenges you need to complete to get all of the bonuses in the game is finding the famous Chaos Emeralds. Finding them can be tricky, but the real challenge is in keeping them once you've got them. Normally you'll need a certain number of rings to access the area containing the Emerald, meaning that it takes a few laps to get to it. Simply collecting the Emerald isn't enough you need to get it, then win the race for it to count! It takes a while to master the best route through the race, but it's worth it. Try getting two Emeralds in one race! SELECT CHARACTER (To be read in sarcastic tone) \"Who on Earth could this hidden character be?

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG The hero of the game! Although everyone is likely to pick Sonic as their first character, he's not the easiest to play with. He's fast and can perform a double jump for extra height, but he slides a lot on corners. MILES TAILS PROWER KNUCKLES THE ECHIDNA AMY ROSE Sonic's freaky two-tailed fox Knuckles is probably the best Sonic's admirer drives around friend.

"EV RYBODY S SUPER SONIC RACING! MOST IMPRESSIVE... computer video games As well as the usual Grand Prix mode, Sonic R provides a selection of one player Time Attack modes. There's the standard timed laps on each track in either normal or reverse, plus Balloon and Tag modes. In Balloon Mode, you need to find five blue balloons hidden around the course and burst them all in the quickest time possible. This plays a lot like the Sonic World games in Sonic Jam. Tag Mode is an interesting variation on the usual game. At the start, two characters run off ahead of you and two run the other way. Your challenge is to find and \"tag\" all four by touching them as quickly as possible! The map in the bottom-right of the screen becomes essential for locating the other characters, but only quick reactions will help you tag them. Traveller's Tales, the coders of Sonic R have pushed the Saturn to new limits in terms of graphics. The scenery is very detailed and moves at high speeds very smoothly plus it's all light-sourced! The water around the tracks looks great, with ripples and reflections of background scenery visible in it. To avoid noticeable pop-up the scenery slowly fades into view. Instead of the usual fogging, objects in the distance appear translucent and slowly become more solid. It's a great effect. Another impressive trick is making real-time reflective 3D models. The \"R\" in the logo on the title screen can be moved around with the d-pad, reflecting the background in its shiny surface just like the T-1000 in Terminator 2! Very clever.

"computer video games RIGGS 22 00:47.70 CAN YOU FEEL THE SUNSHINE DOES IT BRIGHTEN UP YOUR DAY! 00 17.98 00:00 OD Sonic R's music has been done by Sega Europe's Richard Jacques, the man responsible for Sonic 3D's tunes among others. Yuji Naka (the genius creator of Sonic, in case you didn't already know) loved Richard's previous work so much that he asked for him personally. The music fits the Sonic style perfectly, and is very reminiscent of the excellent Sonic CD tunes. Each track has singing on it (another request of the almighty Naka), but there's an option to turn it off if you're not keen on it. We reckon that there are quite a few people who will go straight for this option after playing the game once, but we like the cheesy Japanese dance music and singing ourselves. SING-A-LONG-A-SONIC R! Robotnik doesn't need to worry about falling off the bridge he flies over the water! THIS GAMES CALLED SONIC R BECAUSE MY SURNAMES ROGERS. 2ND OPINION GENIUS, PURE GENIUS. Here are some samples to give you an idea of the kind of lyrics you can expect to hear in Sonic R. RESORT ISLAND \"Can you see, The sun is shining on me, It makes me feel so free, So alive, It makes me want to survive\" RADIANT EMERALD \"C'mon run away, You don't have to stay, We're nearly out of time, BEAUTIFUL SUCH POWER. But you're doing fine\" The first Chaos Emerald is easy to find. It's in a cave on Resort Island. FUNGS 23 1)2:35. U I'm still Sonic's No.1 fan. And I'm still wait ing for the true Saturn sequel to the Sonic games that got me into games and working here. Sonic R isn't that game, but at least it's something. I wasn't too sure about the racing theme, but after the initial confusion (and there's a lot of it) has passed, this is good solid fun. A shame though, that the pick-up-and-play nature of previous Sonics isn't there. I'm dubious of anyone but Sonic Team working on Sonic titles, but it's clear they had a lot of input on Traveller's Tales game. The game engine, the graphics, the stages, the sound (perhaps not the music) are all official Sonic Merchandise. Certainly worth having (Sega fan's have got to have Saturn Sonic game), however hope this isn't the final step in Mr Naka's Project Sonic. I don't want to wait until the upcoming machine to play the next true Sonic platformer from Sonic Team. Ya hear me Mr Naka? TOM GUISE Sonic R's theme tune is one of the most annoyingly catchy things you'll ever hear! \"Ev'rybody's super Sonic racing, try to keep your feet right on the ground... da da da daaa!\" 01834.76 O EDS. 86 0000.00 SONIC R CVG OPINION ELD 4 GG:27.20 TOTAL TINE OI:19.92 1402 00:26. 16 LAP RECORD 00:25.60 D3 00:26.56 COURSE RECORD OI:19.99 This giant pinball table looks totally fantastic! ALSO FOR TWO PLAYERS! Sonic R features a two-player split-screen mode in this, both players run off trying to find floating which works a lot better than most other games' blue balloons, and the first to get five wins. This at the moment. There's the usual one-on-one is a good alternative to non-stop races. The race option as well as a balloon collection game. graphics are reduced slightly for two players. I love my Sonic games, except Sonic 3D. I didn't like that much. While Sonic Rs not the game I've been wanting for the last few years, but it's still a lot better than first thought. The graphics are definitely some of the best on the Saturn so far, with lots of excellent effects that we've not seen anywhere before. When you first play, the tracks seem far too fiddly and complex to be any good for racing, but after experimenting with different characters and learning the best ways through they make a lot more sense. The real challenge isn't simply winning the races it's collecting all the hidden characters and Chaos Emeralds by playing a lot. Although there's a lot to do on each track, a total of five locations isn't going to last as long as I'd like, but the excellent Time Attack modes give you something to work against once you've finished everything else. Sonic R's not another classic Sonic game, but it's extremely enjoyable. After Sega Rally and the original Daytona USA, it's probably the best racing game on the Saturn. OD LOMAS 32 FGS 22 02.04.89 The scenery builds up very close to the characters. Learn the courses well before playing 2-player mode. *3/5 RINGS 68 02:30.33 REVIEW The balloon game is a lot of fun in 2-player mode. You can really drive your friends mad.

"computer games ATION ADVENTURE BY CORE HIGHES  PRICE .99  PREDECESSOR AVAILABLE  PC VERSION SOON  STORAGE 1-CD  RELEASED BY EIDOS TEL 0181 780 2222 TCVG BS TM PlayStation OUT NOW 1 PLAYER layStation The most anticipated game of the year starring a little known character called Lara Croft. Sequels come and sequels go, but judging by this Lara's gonna be around for a lapplad up long time to come. TOMB RAIDER 2 ast year gamers across the country spent the winter months wrapped up warm, playing with a scantily-clad female. Lara Croft was her name, and her appearance upon the game scene was legendary. In the year since Tomb Raider was released, she's gone on to become a household name, and is now the face you genuinely associate with video games. Her popularity and exposure has eclipsed the previous heavyweights of Sonic and Mario. Of course Lara didn't get where she is today by starring in a second rate game. No, the original was an absolute classic, that has redefined gaming boundaries and people's expectations of what a game can be. The only remaining question is can she do it all again? LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH & FAMOUS Those that played the first game know that the best place to start your adventure is at Lara's mansion. Here you can get to grips with exploring and pressing switches, visiting all the rooms in the mansion and even going for a quick swim. For the sequel Core have really gone to town with Lara's home. There are more rooms and things to do and they've even thrown in a puzzle for you to try and solve. TOMB RAIDER 2 THE NEW HMV/CVG TOMB RAIDER 2 CHALLENGE A huge assault course what's this doing in Lara's backyard? Lara tells us at the start of the game that she had it built to help her get in shape. Featuring lots of crates to improve jumping, cargo nets to climb up and even a death slide to finish off, this is fun. Core never told us about this a month ago, but we're so impressed with the assault course that we've scrapped last months HMV/CVG challenge and come up with a new one instead! It's simple, complete the course without falling off any crates and touching the ground (otherwise you'll have to start again). Aim for a time beneath one minute fifty seconds and Bob's yer Uncle. (See our News Section on page 9 for details on how to enter the Challenge). The butler is so thoughtful. Even bringing drinks to the loo. How long did it take us to get this shot? Too long. Was it worth it? Yes. Are we sad? .......hmm REVIEW 1:53.4 1:48.0 78 The start of the course, and the butler brings a nice little refresher. Now make a dash, and no mistakes. Or you'll have to start again! "


"HOME IS WHERE THE PATH IS computer Video games Further exploration of the home of Croft reveals a huge maze built in the gardens. Find the secret inside and a door opens up within the mansion. Lara must sprint back through the maze and into her home to solve a cool puzzle. The best thing about the maze is that the bushes that surround it are really tall, so you can't cheat by pressing the look button, to try and peek over the tops. PlayStation THE NEW LOOK LARA Damn those breasts, getting in the way of our cool screenshots. Lara is looking a lot better this year, complete with new outfits and a new 'do. She's even got a different voice that's slightly posher than in the original game. The khaki shorts and skimpy blue top have returned, plus that body that fits them so well. Yet Lara's picked out a few choice accessories to compliment her trademark attire. She wears a leather winter jacket to prevent the chill in Tibet, and slips into a wet suit for some underwater adventure. Then Lara does her best Mel C impersonation and goes round her mansion in sweat pants and skimpy top. As for the ponytail, it's almost got a life of its own. Blowing around in the breeze, and moving when Lara starts her tumbling. Put simply, this year Lara looks great. Lara chooses her new wetsuit from the shop, very carefully. THE ADVENTURE BEGINS. TOMB RAIDER 2 Last year it was the ancient Scion that you had to hunt down in the large levels. For the new adventure Lara is searching for the legendary 'Dagger of Xian' an artifact that is buried deep within the Great Wall of China. Legend tells us that whoever plunges the dagger deep into their heart will gain the power of the dragon. The dagger is believed to have once been used by a tyrannical emperor, before it was seized by Tibetan warrior monks. Not only is Lara searching for the artifact for adventure and profit, but also several other interested parties, who will cross your path on the journey. IT'S THE NEW STYLE Not only is Lara going on her new adventure armed with a bunch of new weapons. She is also better equipped for the physical challenge, with a host of new moves. The most obvious of which is the ability to climb. Ladders, bookcases, grating and some walls can now be scaled and traversed. All Lara needs do is get a hand onto a ladder, and she'll hoist herself up. More is made in the sequel of the back flip. Lara will use it more to reach new heights, it is also useful for dismounting ladders. Additionally Lara's learnt two new rolls. An underwater one is very useful for evading unwanted predators, and a mid-air one serves a similar purpose when jumping around. SHOOT FIRST, ASK QUESTIONS LATER Lara goes back to her RSPCA loving ways. Ignoring the big guy, and shooting the dog. REVIEW Less animals and more humans pose a greater threat for Lara in her new adventure. You'll need to keep a careful eye on ammunition and medi kits, to survive the numerous encounters. Tigers are the first new foes you'll meet on the journey, plus spiders and crows, though none pose an immediate threat. What is tricky is when a rat or spider start biting around your ankles, and you're perched on a high ledge. The human enemies like to travel around in groups, or accompanied by packs of Dobermans. Usually the dogs will attack you first. When you think all's clear, some great big bloke with huge muscles will leap out from nowhere. 79 "


"computer video games ALL AROUND THE WORLD Lara's not confined to searching dark and dingy caves and tombs. For she is now allowed to venture into the outside world. This offers a major contrast, with the brightly-lit outdoor locales, to the dark and shadowy interiors. Just when you think there's nothing left to see in one location you're whisked off to another more mysterious than the last. Lara is a bit of a globetrotter, and the only thing preventing her from being the female Indiana Jones is that red line that accompanies Indy on his travels to new exotic destinations. Lara does have a theme tune though, that familiar four note opening motif keeps appearing throughout the game, plus some variations to keep the whole thing fresh. ayStation Pretty impressive eh? Don't worry you'll get to go for a fly in it. And swim underneath it, and jump on the wings, and fall off the top! LARA CROFT'LL MAKE YOU JUMP, JUMP SIMPLY WONDERFUL DAHH-LING If you played the first game, you may have been left wanting more, in the way of a story to keep the whole thing going. More FMV rendered cut-scenes keep you informed of developments, plus there are certain scenes where the polygonised Lara is out of your control and interacting with other characters and items. Using these two methods, Core have created more drama, and more to be excited about. As you genuinely anticipate the next level and the surprises that it will provide. TOMB RAIDER 2 One minor detail that annoyed players of the original was Lara's running and jumping. Basically, you had to wait for certain animations to finish before you could perform a new move. For example: making precise jumps of ledges was extra tricky, because you had to leave the platform in exactly the right place. This has now been changed because Lara can break animations at any point. This results in perfect control, and is extra effective in combat when a roll can result in you popping up behind an enemy. The only way Lara can get to the next platform here, is by doing a backflip and then a forward jump! Using the Lara polygon model, these cut-scenes are generated realtime. Lara gets whacked, she does a John Woo style dive & shoot, and she questions a big thug. 80 "


"THE LARA CROFT PIZZA computer video games You want to know how famous Lara is? Apart from a range of action figures that will be in stores early next year, Lara now has a pizza named after her. Available for a limited period only, here's a first look at the pizza to get your mouth watering. For a chance to get money off, check out the news section this issue. PlayStation LARA PIZZA! IT'S HURTING MY BRAIN The original game was a classic mix of puzzles and action. The makers of the sequel knew that the balance between these elements could not lean too far either way or the feel of the game would change. The problem with puzzles are that you don't want to repeat them too much. So Core have come up with some familiar to Tomb Raider veterans, and some which are completely new in design. Expect more pushing and pulling of large blocks, pressing switches and finding keys. The only thing is, there are many more switches and things to do in the sequel. For those that don't like things too tough, luckily you can now save anywhere in the game! No more searching for elusive save crystals a stress free sequel. What next? Final Fantasy VII burgers from McDonalds? Or even PaRappa Buckets from KFC? What are the limits of video game related food products? We're really excited at the prospect of a CVG gourment fudge cake. Suggested by Tony, who even puts sugar on his Frosties in the morning. Seriously, this guy eats more sugar a day than Ed. SCARY! TOMB RAIDER 2 Now in her speedboat, the girl takes it out on the tourists and their horrible gondolas. Ah, isn't Venice so romantic? REVIEW WANNA RIDE MISTER? As hinted in our August issue, there are vehicles in Tomb Raider 2 that Lara can 'borrow' and use. We don't want to spoil the surprise too much for you, but being as the first vehicle is at the start of level two, we just had to tell you about it. The first mode of transport Lara finds is a speedboat, and it helps her a great deal around the dirty canals of Venice. The boat is controlled with the D-pad, and a further speed boost is yours by pressing the X button. Lara can exit or leap out of the boat by pressing square. The only thing she can't do is shoot enemies whilst in the boat. If you want proof that Tomb Raider 2 is better than the original, the vehicles are an obvious starting point. Travelling around the canals is much more fun in the boat. Loads of puzzles, including the feared return of the fire walk! @ 81 "


"computer video games GROOVY FLARES Atmospheric lighting plays an important part in making the sequel look and feel different. Shoot a gun and a dynamic flash will appear from the barrel. When Lara literally can't see her hand before her eyes, you have to light a flare so she can find her way. Certain clues are given on each level as well, with the help of spot lighting, which highlights specific areas. The game also features far more texturemaps than in the original game, which offer all the levels and buildings greater variety. Underwater sections look better than before, with new effects being utilised. In some scary situations Lara will even have to light flares to find her way underwater. PlayStation 2ND OPINION What a fierce little kitty. Lara the supervixen goes out all guns blazing! THE MAKING OF TOMB RAIDER 2 I love this game! Better, tougher and a lot more challenging than its predecessor. Hell, the mind-boggling starts even before the real game at Lara's house. Things get more difficult with each level, but don't despair, you'll have plenty of weapons to deal with the enemies. My personal favourite is the M16, fast and very efficient. The new locations are great. Venice in particular, where you ride a speed boat just like the one Indiana Jones in Last Crusade. If you already have the first game and think the sequel won't take you any further, you're in for a big surprise. If you haven't played Tomb Raider yet what are you waiting for? So it's been a year since the last game, but you've been waiting for what seems like an eternity to play the sequel. Rather than take the easy option and just offer a rehash of the original with different levels. Core have gone back to the drawing board and redesigned everything. Boasting a new and improved game and graphic engine means the sequel looks better. What's more amazing is that the team has delivered the sequel in under a year. 94 IRENJA POGARCIC TOMB RAIDER 2 CVAOPINION Places to go people to shoot. Some things never change. Quick on the draw and an itchy trigger finger, make Lara a real handful. I'm a big fan of the original Tomb Raider, and have been waiting patiently for this sequel all year. I'll say this straight away to put you out of your misery Tomb Raider 2 is better than the original. It may seem like more of the same, but it's not. Everything about the sequel is tighter, the levels are designed much better, and offer more variety. They're bigger and provide more surprises. Just like in the original, you are filled with the same amount of wonderment, as if you are really there exploring ruins and solving puzzles. Vast open spaces provide some awe-inspiring visuals, and when high up there is a genuine sense of vertigo. If there is one flaw it has to be the save game option the ability to save anywhere relieves the frustrations that many had while playing the original, but for veterans it makes the game a lot easier. Big games and sequels almost always get buried under mountains of hype, so when a game actually delivers the goods you know it has to be something special. Tomb Raider 2 more than delivers everything you've expected. ALEX HUTALA 253 REVIEW MUGHINJVE AVIS RATING From simple building blocks to the finished article. The end result is an awesome game. The biggest sequel of the year and it doesn't disappoint. If you've been waiting to play this, you've got the all clear from our end. Now go buy it and enjoy. 82 "

Rare spring a fast one and slap Diddy Kong Racing on our desks. Awesome! e don't care what the other mags said, or what your mates said. Mario Kart 64 is a let down. A testament to that would be the fact we now play the SNES version a great deal more and the supposed 'better' version gathers dust. Which is why when a finished version of Diddy Kong Racing landed on our laps, we were more than surprised. Why are Nintendo releasing this so soon after Mario Kart? Perhaps they are admitting to a bit of bodge job with the Italian plumber? Whatever your opinion, the basic facts are that Diddy Kong makes the final golden jewel in Nintendo's frankly awesome Christmas crown! DIDDYKANG TO RACING / outs 2 is ex .7.95 4 7 00 z 2 DO13990 E17 FIND THE BALLOONS DIDDYK NG RACING The whole game centres around balloons in much the same way as Mario 64 revolves around stars. The game begins with you having no balloons and access to none of the levels. Race Taj and beat him (this is so simple it's untrue) and you can enter Dino Canyon. You'll notice that on the door is a number, and that tells you how many balloons you need to be able enter the level. This is where the fun begins. DIDDY KONG BUSTEDT HAUNTED < FINISH EACH RACE IN FIRST Once you have collected a balloon you can enter the first stage, which houses the racing action you've been waiting for. Inside the level, your objective is to simply finish first. Beating all the other competitors results in another balloon for you and access to the next level. Until you win each race once, you cannot enter the boss stage so you have to keep trying until you make it. REVIEW 10 MECHANICS OF DK RACING 02:20:91 Diddy Kong is much, much more than just a standard racing game. There are two gameplay modes to choose from, Adventure and Tracks. The former is the better for one player as it features an incredible amount of variation on the stages, all of which serve as mini games in their own right. In order for you to get the most from your game as soon as you play it, we've provided a little break down of all the different gameplay styles to get you started. 84 "

Exit the arena and you'll be challenged to another race around the island by Taj, but this time on a different craft. Winning this gives you the last sphere you need. If you still need more, have a fly around the island as some are hidden there too! The second main play mode called 'Tracks'. This should be fairly self explanatory, as it lets you select any of the tracks to race as a single game or in multi player mode. In order to make this linked to the Adventure mode, you cannot race the tracks you haven't found yet, thus making more of an incentive to play this mode. And of course you can have up to four player battles on any of the tracks too.

Get anywhere near the boss and you'll be instantly flattened, losing valuable seconds. You can shoot them with rockets to slow 'em down and use the speed bursts to nip past. Oh, and if you don't get a turbo start you can practically kiss your chances of winning goodbye. NY 00:02: STARTED LIKE LIGHTENINGI Getting a decent start in a game of this nature is crucial for success. Which is why Rare have added not one, but two turbo starts to Diddy Kong. For the purpose of this, we'll call them the blue and red starts. RED START BLUE START <5<TAKE SILVER COIN CHALLENGE Just as you think you've done that stage, the boss springs a surprise on you. You're informed that you can now partake in the Silver Coin challenge. Now you have to race all of the tracks again, but collecting eight silver N64 coins becomes an additional priority to that of just winning. The placing of these coins means that you may have to get some of them on your second lap, but try to get all of the coins as quickly as possible so you can concentrate on racing. This is the easier of the two to perform so as a result doesn't give you as much of a boost. Once the Get Ready logo appears wait until it has just begun to fade and then hit the accelerate button. If you've done this correctly, as small plume of red fire will appear at the back of the craft and you'll get a mini boost! This is the faster start, but one which requires perfect timing because if you leave it too late you'll end up with no kick at all. Again wait for the Get Ready logo but this time you have to wait until it has virtually disappeared before hitting the button. The blue fire, that is being emitted from your vehicle shows it's worked. RACING DDDYKENG (20 00:00:26 00:00:73 8TH 0832789S 263 RACE BOSS AGAIN! Then you're onto the boss again!

THE TT CHALLENG unenda NOW Each level has a set vehicle which you have to race under...but only until other stages have been completed. Once they have all been negotiated, you can return to most of the stages and select the craft of your choice. Not only can this be good for multi player modes (because the scenery will adapt itself depending on a hovercraft or plane for example) but is also vital for finding all of the secret parts of the stages. Also, if you're stuck for balloons, or cannot find the entrance to the next world, visit Taj in the centre and toot your horn to call his attention. Then he can switch your vehicle for you to help you refresh the parts other cars cannot reach. Every world has one, hidden in one of the four tracks. It is the key to the TT Challenge course. Usually, finding these keys will not be possible until you are able to change cars, because they will not be accessible as the standard craft for that race. Once you've located the key and driven into it to collect it, you can exit to the lobby there and then (the chances are you'll be trailing near the back anyway) to see the new stage straight away. Head for the newly opened door and a new surprise awaits! 113 * 00:39:21 FROSTY VILL 'TT' is the watch that wanders around each world, giving you the chance to practice levels, and giving record times for the circuits. The TT Challenges are slight twists on a battle mode game. You and three other competitors are put into an arena then given a set of instructions, something like Last One Alive Wins for example. All that's left is for you to go a-hunting and find those racers. Each character has eight bananas to their name and every time yourself of one of them get shot, two bananas are lost. Lose all eight and you're out. Another variation of that is where you have to hatch three eggs on your nest to win. Eggs are dotted around the scenery and can be picked up by flying over them. Once resting on your specified nest, they the enemy has about twenty seconds to grab them before they hatch and place them on their own resting place. These are even better when you're playing as four human characters and can last for ages! VEHICLE The keys aren't tough to find, you just need common sense.

A small fly-by of the circuit will also appear in the window as well. Playing in three player mode will bring up a map in the fourth window so you can see just how close people are, and in two player you can have simple split screen. Cool! Icons giving you temporary speed boosts are all well and good, but there is a way of getting a generally quicker car all round. That is done by collecting Diddy's favourite food: Bananas. For every ten of these you collect, characters are given a slight increase in speed. Likewise getting down to zero results in you crashing. It gives you something extra to think about while racing.

Diddy Kong is the same. The top right shoulder button is the skid, which on it's own is often enough to power through corners. But for really tight U-Bends, utilise the brake as well.

And now I get to do Diddy Kong as well! Now I know you'll be thinking this, but Diddy Kong really is what Mario Kart should have been! For a start, it's an amazing looking game. Elements of Wave Race are visible on the water stages and the snow levels particularly the village are amazing! But it's the playability that really makes this. The feeling you get is exactly like that from SNES Mario Kart. Two-player battles and four-player races are quite intense and will waste away hours of your time. The one player game is 'rock' as well. Rare pull one of their classic tricks and make you think that just as you've finished everything, another world opens up! Those who thought Mario Kart was crap will find sanctuary in DKR. Go and get it now. It's flippin' awesome! STEVE PES CAMERA ANGLES Something which may prove useful to some of you are the four camera angles in the game. The top C button switches the view from a standard Kart to behind the shoulder cam.

Get used to it Dead Or Alive is here to stay! DE ALVES Ihe arcade version of Dead or Alive didn't get the attention it deserved. Tecmo created the game using Sega's Model 2 technology to give it a wonderfully smooth and solid look, as well as some of the best fighting action ever seen. Although in many ways it's similar to Sega's fantastic Virtua Fighter 2, there are lots of ways in which it even betters what some see as fighting perfection! Tecmo's Saturn conversion is available now in Japan, and has everything you could want from a home arcade game including the bouncing breasts! Yeah! LEISERING 2 HIT COMED '* A BIT OF ALRIGHT Enak Dead or Alive's graphics are astounding. The arcade, version looked fantastic, as it was running on Sega's immensely powerful Model 2 board, but Tecmo have managed to translate it to the Saturn brilliantly. Everything runs in the Saturn's high-resolution mode, and at 60 frames per second (like Virtua Fighter 2) only there's little or no glitching whatsoever.

The female characters in Sega's Fighting Vipers had breasts which moved subtly for extra realism. Tecmo have taken this a stage further in Dead Or Alive, with the most mobile breasts you'll ever see! The slightest movement is enough to set them off, swinging and bouncing around in a most comical fashion! Take a look... Ouch! Tina's got some nasty hold moves, and this is one of the more painful. The noise isn't very pleasant either. 90 Look closely at the chest on the left over the three pictures. Wooooow! "


"EXPLOSIVE COMBOSI video computer video games YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE DANGER ZONE! One of the things that sets Dead or Alive apart from Virtua Fighter is the way the rings are set up. Around the edge is an area known as the Danger Zone, Standing in this area is fine, but get knocked down and an explosion fires you back into the air doing, extra damage. It's possible to get a Ring Out victory, by forcing your opponent out of the Danger Zone, which adds all sorts of new strategy and techniques to the fights. Forcing your enemy into the Danger Zone, then knocking them down is great for extra damage, but is also very useful for setting up vicious floating combos. If, for example, you do a 3-hit combo to knock someone down in the Danger Zone they'll land on the ground, get knocked up by the explosion and enable you to continue the combo. Mastering these combos is the key to victory in Dead or Alive. Tina takes extra damage and gets knocked into a dangerous position, all because of the Danger Zone! 2 TCUMEO HOLD ITI HOLD ITI The controls for Dead or Alive are very easy to get to grips with. It uses three buttons -Hold, Punch and Kick, which will be instantly familiar to Virtua Fighter or Fighting Vipers players. The big difference though is that it's not possible to simply hold a button to defend all the time. The Hold button does a lot more than just block. 2 COMBO DEFENSIVE HOLDS Tapping the Hold button makes your character do a quick waving block which you need to time, just right so that you counter their attack! It's not as hard as it sounds. If you time it right, you'll push your opponent's attack away and hit them back, staggering them for more possible hits. You can counter punches or kicks at any level if you get it right. 1 Zack times his defensive hold so that he pushes Hayabusa's punch away, then hits. pen OFFENSIVE HOLDS The Hold button can also be used to attack. Each character has some simple throws that are initiated with a basic pad motion and a press of the Hold button, but some have more complicated attacks. For example, Bayman has a three-part hold combo similar to King's throw combos in Tekken 2. CVG OPINION 1 Lei-Fang grabs Bayman's hand, twists him around and knees him in the gut! WHAT A DELIGHTFUL OUTFITI To begin with each fighter has their standard arcade costumes, but playing through in Arcade, Mode reveals more. And more. And more. These, costumes get weirder each time, ending with some of the most bizarre outfits you've ever seen! The female characters have some very risqué outfits as well. ending with truly minuscule bikinis! A single go on Dead or Alive in the arcade was enough to convince me that it was brilliant. Initially it just seems like a slightly confusing Virtua Fighter 2 rip-off, but it's really so much more than that. The Hold button adds a lot to the fights, making them faster and more like \"real\" Kung-Fu movie scraps. The characters are all unique and grow on you after a while providing loads of moves, combos and techniques to learn. The Saturn conversion is far better than I expected, with some of the best graphics we've seen on the machine, The detail on the characters is fantastic and they move super-smoothly. If you own a Saturn, chances are you appreciate the magnificence of the Virtua Fighter series. That means that you'll love Dead or Alive to bits, no doubt about it. This is an essential buy for import Saturn gamers, and hopefully Acclaim's UK version will be great too. You won't be disappointed with this fantastic game at all. ED LOMAS SINGING IN THE RAIDOU REVIEW NIG'NIVE! RATING The boss of the game is Raidou a demonic lightning master. He fights a bit like Akira in Virtua Fighter 2 and looks like an older version of Akuma from Street Fighter Alpha.

"TAKE THE LOW ROAD LAP 1/3 computer Video games TOTAL TIME 2'40\"53 LAP TIME 2'40\"53 Alternative routes are becoming essential in modern racing games, and as in MRC, Top Gear Rally's courses all feature shortcuts that you can take if you need to shave seconds off your time. Some of these are signposted. Others you have to discover for yourself, but they're not so hard to find. Watch out for gaps in fences or low verges that will let you drive straight across a bend. Most shortcuts are off-road though, so if you haven't come equipped with the right tyres or suspension you'll need to drive carefully or risk losing more time than you gain.

If you get the hang of a course in normal sunny mode, next season around you may find that you have to race the same course in driving rain, snow, fog or even at night. The fog and night effects aren't too drastic, but the rain and snow can significantly affect the race. Not only is visibility reduced dramatically, the road surface is much more slippery racing the jungle circuit in snow is very tricky!

MRC has a wide variety of gizmos you can tweak to tune your car. Top Gear Rally only has a few, but they're about all you need. Handling, suspension and tyres all have three settings and they all have a notice able effect on the car's performance, so it's easy to experiment and determine exactly how it needs to be set up for a particular race. You can also give your car a new paint job on the decal screen, where it's taken apart panel-by-panel for a full respray or so you can paint your favourite rude slogan up the side. TOP GEAR RALLY TP à TOTAL TIME 995093 LAP TIME 1050 PAINT SHOP SOMPH om SS Snow is even worse than rain. Use your slippy tyres and take the corners extra-slowly. While I've been playing this I've been proper narked with people walking past me, stopping and saying, «Uh-hur-hur! Is it as rubbish as it looks then?\". Imbeciles! Have they no eyes? Okay, so some of the scenery on the early tracks looks spartan to the spectator, but this is such a pure racing experience that to include cardboard crowds would be a pointless distraction. If you try this in a shop, don't base your opinion on a race in the first cars. These feel slow, but that's because they're realistically modelled rally cars that do 80mph over rough ground, not Ridge Racer fantasy cars that top 200. From the second season onward the cars get gradually faster and you get a real feel for the power of the vehicle when you're struggling with the controls, sawing the steering, pumping the gas and sliding through corners especially if you've got a Rumble Pak plugged in. This is one of the best console rally games I've played, with a superb feel, great tracks and weather effects that actually have an effect. It's a much more challenging drive than MRC and when you've seen what it has to offer you'll realise it looks better too.

Steal an unprecedented amount of cars. Run over anyone who inhabits the pavements, or just shoot them. BAND HUTNIH lhe moral brigade beware. All those lifeless, shockable people who jump on the 'ban this now' bandwagon are going to have a field day with GTA. Quite right too games that are this good, are truly obscene! If only these shockable people played the games, or watched the films that got them so worked up, they might suddenly realise that they're quite good, and change their minds. Placed in a huge sprawling city, with the aim to work your way up the criminal underworld career ladder. Starting as a lowly street hood working for the mob, you're trying to impress the local crime bosses, eventually being promoted to The Don, but that's just the start of it. WELL, LOOKY WHAT WE HAVE HERE serer THEFT UHEL GTA is a driving game like no other, and with a bunch of cool extras bolted on. Instead of trying to beat a lap time to progress to the next level, you have to make a set amount of money. You do this by completing missions for the local crime bosses. There are around four missions to complete a level, but when you discover GTA has over 200 missions in total, you realise this game is big. Of course, each mission is totally illegal in its nature. Killing the police chief, robbing banks, transporting people, chasing other gangs and making drug runs are all in a days work in the world of GTA. GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES, YOUR BOOTS AND YOUR MOTORCYCLE The real beauty of GTA is the ability to drive any car that takes your fancy, anywhere you want. If you're zooming around the city streets and suddenly see a car that looks like it could be a bit faster, go and get it. Each car also handles very differently, with some getting up to uncontrollable speeds, others with expert cornering and amazing braking. Stealing cars is simple: just go up to the drivers side of the car and yank out the driver. Expect to receive an ear ful of abuse, but that's a small price to pay for a free ride.

"STREETS LIGHT A JUNGLE computer Video games There are three very large cities to cruise around in GTA. Liberty City, San Andreas and Vice City (or New York, San Francisco and Miami for arguments sake). The game features 6000 scaled miles of roads to explore within these cities. The action is viewed from above, courtesy of the DMA news-copter. The view zooms in and out depending on the speed of your car. Of course being cities, the streets are full of traffic. The amazing thing is how they behave. Each car has a high level of Artificial Intelligence. Pull in front of a computer-controlled car, and it will brake to avoid crashing. Start a fire or kill a pedestrian and emergency vehicles rush to the scene. Drive on the pavements and people run in different directions for their lives. These cities are almost real. 44590 If you want a change of pace, try riding the subway. Or alternatively just blow the sucker up. HIGADOTTAG QILD AW, NOT PUFF DADDY AGAIN! IT One of the coolest features of GTA is the music. DMA have gone to great lengths to complete the feel of the cities by adding radio stations. All the different cars in the game are able to receive several of the stations. Every time you step out of a car, the music stops. Every time you step into another the music starts up again. The radio stations almost work like theme tunes for the different cars, with different styles of music immediately being recognisable to particular vehicles. Jump into a beat up pick-up for example, and you're guaranteed Country & Western. A jeep and you'll be zooming round to jungle. All the American muscle cars play pure rock. If any particular music doesn't take your fancy, just press F5 on the keyboard to retune the radio. Sorted! 6470 DE here CVG OPINION It doesn't play music, but if you hit the special key when riding a cop car, you can turn the siren and the lights on. Cool! Trucks play music loud, plus you get to use a huge horn. They also produce a beep when they reverse to warn other drivers. CAUGHT BY THE FUZZ Your one-man crime spree doesn't go unnoticed by the boys in blue. A bar at the top of the screen, displayed as police heads, indicates your wanted level. One head and you get lone squad cars chasing you. Next, two cars could be on your tail. Three and police road blocks are set up on bridges. Four and it's like Smokey and the Bandit with hundreds of cop cars and roadblocks all over the place. Police may be alerted to your activities by killing one too many pedestrians, stealing cars right under a cop's nose, or even ramming right into a squad car. Certain missions that see you having to deliver a very hot car, will mean the police are all over you. Same if you've got to drive getaway on a bank job. 871870 I had to be dragged kicking and screaming from this game in order to review it, addictive is an understatement, but so is the fun level. Ever since playing APB in the arcades nearly a decade ago I've been waiting for this game. I'm only surprised it hasn't been done before. The idea, design and look is all very simple, but it plays like a dream. The overhead view is classic, the music and sounds are all excellent and the humour spot on. Cars handle superbly, and the Al is great. The satisfaction of braking into a narrow alley whilst being chased by the cops is gonna be hard to beat. There's only one word of warning if you haven't got a 3D card it looks rough. If you've ever played a game and thought, 'wouldn't it be great if you could...', I urge you to play this, it has it all. Screenshots, reviews, even watching the game don't do it justice, this is something that just has to be played. ALEX HUTALA REVIEW RATING YY5 ET MITT Trying to break-through this roadblock our driver was sadly squished. A driving shoot 'em up with a dark side, and all the better for it. There's so much involved, it's almost impossible to categorise. Yeah, we vouch for this! Keep the cops off your tail by changing the plates or respraying the car. 95 "

So good that we expect LucasArts were starting to worry that their crown was about to be stolen. Hence their dusting down their most famous pirate, Guybrush Threepwood, for the timely next instalment of Monkey Island. Revolution, guessing they were onto a good thing, quickly started work on a sequel to their hit. George and Nico are back, this year embroiled in an plot that takes them to South America a land full of crime syndicates, drug smugglers, poison darts, and Mayan temples. We know there's a game in that lot somewhere. T his und ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS I wouldnt normally call you: NOT JUST ONE ADVENTURE BROKENSWORDII MOKING Mikk For those who didn't play the original, the concept is simple.

There is a mystery to solve, lots of clues to find, and people to question. Plus lots of puzzles to slow you down. A new feature is the ability to play as George's lover Nico during certain sections. This is because George and Nico realise the fruits of their efforts can be doubled if they split-up. There are also certain points in the game which affect the outcome. The choice you make has a direct effect on the subsequent adventure, offering the game some replay value as you search for all the different variations. Players of the original should recognise these characters. Thal area is prtuale. DEJA VU? CVG OPINION George explores some crates, ooohhhhhh!

"NOW IT'S UP TO YOU! computer video games The best way to play TOCA Touring Car is in the full Championship Mode. Here you race through the tracks in order, with two rounds at each visit to a venue instead of just the one in Formula 1 racing. Before a race you get three timed laps to determine your position on the starting grid pole position is especially precious as it's worth a bonus championship point. At each location your team give you a number of points that you must achieve before you leave. If you don't, you're OUT! This feature adds to the tension, but can occasionally be very annoying. There's no way that a team would fire someone who was second in the championship simply because they came seventh in a race, for example. PlayStation Your car's not looking too good.

Practicing the courses carefully before each race is essential as a wheel out of place could easily put you into a slide or spin.

WRAPUP WARM CVG OPINION As TOCA Touring Car Championship is set in Britain, there are some pretty varied weather effects. When racing on a very sunny day drivers need to worry about lens flare (PlayStation version only, as far as we've noticed) while fog, snow and heavy thunderstorms cause bigger problems. Stormy races look particularly good as the car's lights reflect off the wet track. Very cool. championship TOURING CAR LAF TIME -38 POSTO 2 :**: FORG WRONG WAY ULTRON MANO-A-MANO If you've ever watched a real Touring Car race you'll know how exciting the races are. Thankfully Codemasters have managed to capture all of it in a game. The graphics are impressive but a little sparse, and don't always give a good impression of speed. But although it doesn't look like you're driving at 140mph, the car really feels like it's on the edge one tiny mistake at that speed and you'll go spinning into a wall! The championship races are fantastic, as you're set targets by your team meaning that you MUST do well. The computer-controlled cars have excellent artificial intelligence they really fight hard for positions and occasionally make mistakes to take each other out of the race. You can't fiddle with the game settings as much as you can in other driving games, but the handling is a spot-on balance between realism and fun, making the races the most exciting in any PlayStation or PC driving game. It's true that TOCA looks a bit dull when you're watching someone else play, but get on it yourself and you'll realise just how great it is. Much more fun than Formula 1 '97 and V-Rally put together, reckon. Magnificent! ED LOMAS TOCA's two-player mode can be viewed with either a horizontal or vertical split-screen, much like many other driving games at the moment. While you can only have head-to-head battles, they're still more fun than most split-screen driving games. The races are closer than most other games like this, but the one player championship is still the best way to play. GO EASY ON THE PAINTWORK! REVIEW To add to the realism of the racing, lots of little touches have been included. One of the cool features of the PC version which is more useful than you may think is that lights from other cars shine on your windscreen. When playing from the in-car view, you'll occasionally see two white dots on your screen, meaning that there's someone right behind you. Your car also takes damage during the races, with bits of bodywork flying all over the place. If you take a light hit from behind, the red plastic around your rear light can break off, exposing the white bulb inside! RATING RATING 0 0 Captures everything that's great about Touring Car racing. Codemasters have made a real edge-of-theseat racing experience that every fan should get. 99 "


"computer video games SMASHER Jedlo TROUBLET FIGHTING GAME BY CORE  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY CORE DESIGN TEL 01332 297797 OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS ROM PlayStation SATU Sandwiched between Tomb Raider 1 and 2 is Core's next big title: Fighting Force. But does this 3D beat 'em up five up to the already high standards set by Lara's blockbuster? PlayStation ROM ith Core now established as major players in the games industry, thanks in no small part to a Ms Lara Croft, their games command a lot more attention than a couple of years ago. Fighting Force is their next biggie, and the amount of money they have been, and still are, putting behind it shows they have high hopes for it. The basic game is a scrolling fighting affair, where you travel through various locations in New York in a bid to stop the evil Dr Zen from taking over the world (cue booing for bad guy). You choose to fight as one of four characters, each with the differing abilities you come to expect from a title of this nature. Basically you beat up loads of enemies, and that's it! FIGHTING FORCI 9 DESPERATE TIMES.. OG To save you taking a pasting at the hands of enemies, the game has one special attack for each character that catches any person within striking distance of you. By simply tapping punch and jump in quick succession, your fighter performs a move which causes them to spin around through 360°, or in Smasher's case whack the floor to create a mini earthquake! The only downer is that this takes a small bit of energy from yourself as well. O O PICK 'N' MIX O INTON HANK HAKT ORG 6100 TROUBLE As you wander through the Big Apple picking off the various bad guys, numerous objects can be picked up and used to aid you. Guns, knives, and crates (for smashing over someone's head) are easy to come by, but some items are a little more hidden. For instance, if you smash the fire box on the lift stage, the axe will fall out which kills weaker enemies in one chop. TV screens can be knocked down and thrown. Smashing up cars causes the tyres to fall off, and even road signs can be smashed to whack over Dr Zen's henchmen. HANA 00 CVG OPINION The PlayStation is crying out for a decent scrolling fighting game. And coming from Core, whose recent track record has been more than a little impressive, you'd have thought they would have done a superlative job. Not so I'm afraid. The characters you control have quite a few moves to their names, but they are the same for every fighter. I don't think it would have taken too long to make specific attacks rather than generic ones for the Fighting Force. The graphics are pretty good, and the presentation is also impressive, but the game just seems too similar and repetitive to make it a real stunner. STEVE tib9 BUS.

BLONY WARS LIITTI THURN 191 ITTHUI HILLHANLILTI ore bad news from the future. The human race is spread out in colonies across the galaxy, all of them under the cosmic thumb of The Tsar. However, some freedom-loving souls don't care for The Tsar's thumb and have formed a rebel group, The League Of Free Worlds. Unfortunately for them, and indeed you, The Tsar keeps a vast navy of heavily-armed battle cruisers for the sole purpose of reducing rebels to their component molecules. Hence, there's some starfighting action on the cards, and it's up to you to show The Tsar where to stick his thumb! STAR BORES IO INFINITY... AND BEYOND! SZIMANO903 With so much story-telling to do, Colony Wars is even more FMV-heavy than most Psygnosis games. In fact there is a total of 15 minutes of video in the game, which takes the form of progress reports and plot updates that appear after every few missions. The pre-rendered graphics are good but a bit blurred in places, and most of the videos aren't so cool that you want to see them twice. The sombre orchestral music and the slightly sappy storyline (read by American actor, James Earl Jones) about discovering the identity of The League's hidden leader doesn't make for enraptured viewing either. Colony Wars comprises 70 strike and defence missions in which you do battle with various representatives of the Imperial Navy, either in their diddy starfighters, their medium-sized cruisers or their massive Dreadnoughts and Super Dreadnoughts. The missions don't all run in sequence from 1 to 70, and your skill as a pilot determines your route through the game to one of six different endings. If you're some kind of star-spud you'll send the entire League of Free Worlds to an early grave after about nine missions. but straight-shooters should eventually topple The Tsar and re-establish freedom throughout the galaxy.

We probably still had the briefings from PC games like TIE Fighter in our mind, but instead all you get is a bit of text that teletypes out, letter by letter, while a bloke with a voice like a sedative reads it out. It's informative, but it doesn't really gee up for the excitement to come. Kind of making up for that, though, are Colony Wars' database screens which let you check out ships from both sides and read up on the star systems and planets that are in the game. They're pretty much irrelevant, but they do look quite pretty. If you destroy the League you can go back to an earlier stage to fix things.

"GUNS AND ROCKETS SPACE CADETS computer video games If, unlike any of us, you're the cautious type and don't want to steam straight into the anti-Tsar campaign as soon as you load the game for the first time, you might like to get the hang of things on the training missions. There are six of these, three of which teach you how to handle your ship by guiding it to a warpholes or through a course of rings, and three which concentrate on using weapons by sending you into battle against target drones and a cruiser. You get to fly several different ships in Colony Wars, ranging from pantsy little rocket ships with next to no armament, to meaty starfighters, bristling with exotic winglets and weaponry. Once at the controls your objective is usually to destroy whatever gets in your way, but to do that can require careful use of weaponry. To destroy some ships, it's best to start by stripping their defences with your anti-shield laser or an anti-shield missile. If it's a smaller ship you can then rip it to pieces with your regular lasers, the more powerful scatter guns and plasma guns, or perhaps a nice homing missile. With bigger ships, though, it's wiser to disable your target first with an EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) cannon which disrupts the ship's systems. When it's finally lying prone, deliver the final killing blow as quickly as possible. If you dawdle, the crew may repair the damage and blast you to bits. THEN you'd look stupid.

That cruiser must be saved, SZEMANO993 CVG OPINION HILLI PLASMA GUN NOW WE'LL SEE SOME FIREWORKS! Ah, now. Here's where Colony Wars really scores. Once you actually get out there and into battle you get to see some pretty fancy sci-fi blockbuster-style special effects. The weapons look really cool; lasers all have an extra glow on them and the missiles look like sparkling Star Trek photon torpedoes, and leave brilliant trails behind them. Watching a homing missile loop through space after its target, then blast it to smithereens is very satisfying. And as for the explosions! A bright shockwave expands outwards from the stricken ship just before it disintegrates into a streaking shower of triangles. The larger ships are even more spectacular. When they're just about to blow, white beams split the seams between the polygons, then the whole thing explodes in a burst of light. Mmm, yes. Nice. Colony Wars easily outclasses some of the duff 3D space combat sims on the Playstation of late, but it's still not perfect. Aside from the boring briefings and tedious movies, the problem is that the missions are either too short or too difficult. With the short ones it feels like you spent almost as much time in the briefing as you did in space, and when I say too difficult I'm thinking of one mission in particular which I'm sure is impossible, or at least unfathomable. I suppose playing LucasArts' PC titles has spoiled me on these games, but even X-Wing had more intricate and interesting missions than these. Colony Wars' best feature saves it though. Even if the ship design is often derivative and clunky, the graphics are superb, and when they're hooked up to a smooth dogfighting engine like this one you feel like you're playing in some hot new sci-fi movie. Rarely has spacebourne blasting been this spectacular, and if you've always wanted to be Luke Skywalker, or a cheaper facsimile, you should enjoy this. REVIEW PAUL GK Alices MENU inn MET RATING The tedious plot and the missions let it down a bit, but the blasting action looks excellent and plays very nicely indeed. 103 "


"computer video ganes PC ACTION AND ADVENTURE BY BLUE BYTE  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY BLUE BYTE TEL 01604 232200 1-4 PLAYERS OUT NOW ROM ROM Time is indeed running out! Blue Byte's latest addition to the Battle Isle titles arrives with a wealth of excellent review scores from PC mags. Is it as good as people say? TIME IS RUNNING OUT Ihe smaller PC developers must be pretty gutted at this Christmas' lineup. Quake 2, Tomb Raider 2, Sensi 2000 to name but a few, and all of them established names. And while some of the more 'aged' gameplayers may argue that Battle Isle is also a successful brand (which it is) it still doesn't have the same «Cor blimey\" appeal as the others. Incubation should change that. Because it's a turn-based game, a lot of emphasis is on you to plan ahead. Simply moving characters where you feel like they should go, will result in your imminent death. You also have to plan ahead, and try to anticipate where enemies will appear from. So basically, you need to use your brains and intelligence. If you have any. LES TIME IS RUNNING OUT SHUT YOUR NORTH AND SOUTH! The basic moves a character can do are as follows. Once you have control, a number of dots will appear to let you know the positions the person can move to and the number of steps they'll use getting their. Then you choose in which direction to face them in. For instance, you don't want a marine to have his back to a door, because he won't be able to react to the enemy coming through it. Players can also be set to react to any enemy movement, so they'll blast away whenever a baddie moves. THIS IS A WARNING! CVG OPINION One important thing to remember is that your gun can overheat if you fire too many times too quickly. Once a character is highlighted some bars appear at the bottom of the screen which show energy and the temperature of your gun. Once the gun overheats, you cannot fire for a couple of goes and you're a sitting duck. It took me a little while to get into Incubation. Once you have learned that wading in with all guns blazing may be fun for a little while but means that you don't last for very long then the real pulling power of Incubation comes through. Trying to come up with the best positions for you troops, deciding whether to send the jet pack guy off alone or defending a last gasp ambush. It's so compelling that you feel as though your a real life soldier. The only gripe is that I did find the controls a little confusing at first, and not having the instant accessibility may put some people off. But those with patience will love it! STEVE LES REVIEW RATING BATING The Blue Byte portfolio is looking very healthy at the moment, and Incubation is the most compelling release to date. Top stuff!

What do you have? Marvel Super Heroes! PlayStation Marvel characters & 1996 Marvel characters inc. All rights reserved.  Capcom Co Ltd. All rights. COMICS hey said it couldn't be done. Marvel Super Heroes is Capcom's most MARVELTM advanced 2D fighter to date. The original arcade game features the best animated characters and most packed backgrounds ever featured in a coin-op. In spite of this, Capcom have prevailed with a stunning conversion. The basic premise is Street Fighter 2, with outrageous extras. The game features the same wear-down-the-energybar gameplay but with a highly advanced, yet easy to get into combination system along with Infinity Gems power-ups that can tip the balance of power in any given situation. But the premise of this game just the thought of pitting Spider-Man against Wolverine or Iron Man against Doctor Doom is what provides unparalleled appeal! Excelsior! SUPER HERAER 19200B6 500 DERBY GAMMA CRUSHA MARVEL 1p46200 PRESS START SATURN PLAYSTATION IRON MON Marvel Super Heroes isn't a totally perfect conversion on either Saturn or PlayStation. Both versions are missing some animation e PlayStation game in particular loses lots) and there is some slowdown too. Here are the pros and cons of each version: SATURN PLAYSTATION PROS  More animation than the PlayStation version.  Overall it's a fair bit faster too.  Compatibility with the 1MB RAM cart for near arcade perfect animation. PROS  The fact it's there at all after the cancellation of X-Men:Children of the Atom! More intelligent computer controlled fighters in one-player mode.  It's the only 2D fighting game in its class worth buying. Hulk's double uppercut can be used repeatedly on stupid people! I CAN DO ANYTHING A SPIDER CAN OH NO, THAT'S NOT ME.. CONS The computer players in the one-player mode are very easy to defeat There is some slowdown when certain characters are played on certain backgrounds. CONS  The amount of slowdown with the big characters is a lot more intrusive on this version. You can't really use the basic Sony pads with a combo system this intricate. .There is a lot of player animation missing. 1pNEW HERO \"RICHARDS! CURSE YOU RICHARDS!» ROOM MIMO There's no doubt that Marvel Super Heroes is a finely tuned gameplay experience, with some of the greatest of Marvel's heroes (and indeed villains). But one question haunts the CVG Hive Brain: where are the Fantastic Four? What on Earth are Blackheart and Shuma Gorath (nobodies from the Marvel Universe) doing here when Mr Fantastic, the Thing, the Invisible Woman, and the Human Torch would be so much better! After all, having Doctor Doom without Reed Richards just isn't... right. SOEL 106 What defence does a slimy purple squid have against Dr Doom's immense power? None. "


"AERIAL RAVE! computer Video games Aside from speed, the one thing which sets MSH's gameplay apart from the Street Fighter series is the Create-a-Combo system. This allows for some of the most incredible multiple hit attacks ever seen! X-Men: Children of the Atom was cool, but MSH really scores with its Aerial Rave system. Certain moves power your opponent up into the air... and you can follow them up and continue the combination carnage! Ten hit Aerial Raves are commonplace, but some characters (such as Wolverine) take the system to the limit! TpNEW HERO NEJ AERO 522 FIRST ATTACK! HIT PlayStation NEW NERO 07700 TE PRESS START. BLACKHEART 2ND OPINION 2NEW NERO SPERTE Marvel Super Heroes initially seems like a basic fighting game, simply because it's so easy to get into. But play it a lot and you'll find that it's one of the most intricate around, as well as one of the most fun. The graphics are astounding, especially on the Saturn with the RAM cartridge, though I was surprised how brilliantly the final PlayStation version turned out. Awesome game. 2 LOMAS Expect a fight between Blackheart and Thanos to make your console creak under the pressure! Nyaaaaaah! Spider-Man is one of the best characters for speedy chain combos like this. CVG OPINION \"NEED? DOOM... NEEDS... NO-ONE!\" 35 PRESS START SUPER HERAES PRE ICT OY If the ten standard characters aren't good enough for you, Marvel Super Heroes also features two boss characters to get to grips with (and you can play as them if you know the code!) along with a further secret fighter!

DOCTOR DOOM THANOS The greatest super villain in the The main villain in Marvel history of comicdom Doctor Super Heroes, Thanos intends Doom is a frankly stunning to wipe out all life in the character. Capcom have universe. And why not? He's modelled all of his moves on got a huge range of special technology the character has moves (some activated just by used in his many battles against using normal button presses), the likes of the Avengers, but the real power behind Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Thanos is that he has a Four. In human hands this devastating array of supers ruthless dictator is unstoppable! one per Infinity Gem! 2725883 SAT 0300 PRUSSIAN I love Marvel Super Heroes (it's easily my favourite fighting game) and these conversions are frankly fantastic. Senses shattering, even. Capcom have done a marvellous job in bringing the coin-op's stunning visuals to the home machines and the gameplay survives 100% intact. There are some problems with both versions of the game look at the Saturn vs PlayStation box for the full monty but you can't fault the overall experience. In fact, having played the coin-op recently, it's a wonder that ANY translation of this standard-setting game was possible at all! While the Street Fighter Alpha games are brilliant, I prefer Marvel Super Heroes' overthe-top approach. These iconic characters, combined with Capcom's beat 'em up knowhow, are the basis for what is undoubtedly one of the greatest 2D fighting games EVER! To be frank, it's an affront to your console if you don't buy this ace game. RICA HEAVBETTER 66800 PRESS STARI IRON Mid-air combos like this are known as Aerial Raves. ME HULK. MY OWN GAME MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ONE HONEST HUCEREVET VIA 1 RATING SATURN ANITA Donovan's friend from Night Warriors also makes an appearance in Marvel Super Heroes. Considering how tiny she is, she really looks out of place in the huge sprite festival that is MSH. She readily summons demons to do her bidding, including Gouki (Akuma) from the Street Fighter series. And she has a 98 hit super! Capcom achieve the impossible in bringing this brilliant coin-op to the consoles. The Saturn version is better overall, and stands besides SFA2 as the best 2D fighter. REVIEW 19. 281000 oC RATING RATING PlayStation LOVE FOR YOU Still a monumental achievement. Whereas the Saturn version is a match for SFA2, the slowdown and lack of animation makes Sony MSH second best to Alpha. 107 "


"computer video games 3D SHOOTING GAME BY LOBOTOMY  PRICE .99  PC & MAC VERSIONS AVAILABLE  N64 VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY SEGA TEL 0181 996 4620 SATURN DEC RELEASE 1 PLAYER TH SATUR Over a year after its release, PC Quake remains CVG's most played game and now the first console conversion has arrived! But can the Saturn's three-year-old technology are the ground-breaking graphics handle the power? In a word: YES! U henever you first load up Quake on PC, the first thing to grab you are the ground-breaking graphics the stunning animation, the lighting, the shadows... it's amazing! Get into the game proper and you find a really cool survival shoot 'em up. Then play it multiplayer and prepare for your life to change forever! The thrill of one-on-one battle or the bloodbath of a 16-player DeathMatch that's why we're still playing the PC version now. That's why the phrase \"gunned down like a stinking pig» still holds relevance in the CVG offices, even today. The Saturn version of Quake is a miracle. It has everything you'd want from the PC version plus new lighting... All the graphics, all the monsters, all the levels, all the blood it's got the lot. EXCEPT the multiplayer mode. So how good is it then? QUAKE QUAKE ( MONSTER IN MY TROUSERS The issue of the enemies in Quake has dogged the Saturn version throughout its development. Now the game's complete, it's easy to see where Lobotomy were forced to make a compromise. To keep the speed up, monsters teleport in to replace fallen comrades, or appear suddenly out of the shadows, that kind of thing. We played an older version that didn't have this \"feature\" and sometimes the slowdown was unbearable. Teleporting monsters keeps the speed up and introduces a much-needed element of surprise to keep you on your toes. It works fairly well actually. BR 12 + You can see here how the enemies teleport in to save processing power.z 7 Make sure you gib the zombies with a grenade or they'll keep getting up! REVIEW When they get this close, the ogres use chainsaws to hack at you! 1 The vores appear later in the game and are particularly nasty. Firing a rocket too close to your target is a bad idea. The explosion flashes the screen red and doesn't help your health and armour ratings. 108 "


"Computer GLOBOTOMY'S SECRET video games you GOT THE RUNE: Just as in Duke Nukem 3D, Lobotomy couldn't resist implementing some of their own fearsome designs into this conversion. All of the original PC secret levels have been removed, replaced with Lobotomy-spawned creations. This means we miss out on the smart low-gravity Ziggurat Vertigo level from the PC game, but trust us: Lobotomy know how to get the very best out of their Quake engine and what you get to see are some pretty senses-shattering levels. Oh yes. SEA SATURN This is Chthon, the boss at the end of the first episode. As soon as you grab the rune, he appears out of the lava and throws things! 2ND OPINION @_AND REMEMBER Quake is definitely one of my favourite games of all-time. It may not have loads of innovative features or anything particularly original, but the gameplay is tuned to absolute perfection. The way your character moves, the weapon design, the whole look of the game is magnificent. Although the Saturn version is a fantastic conversion (better than any of us ever thought possible), it loses a lot of the feel of the PC game. The \"enemies teleporting in\" trick works well, but is fairly noticeable in the earlier levels. Quake was never as good as Duke Nukem 3D in one-player mode, and it really shows when you play the Saturn versions of the two. Although Quake's more, impressive, Duke is faster and better value for money for the single player. If you're a fan and have the money, get both and you won't be disappointed. The easiest way to get to play Death Tank (Lobotomy's incredible SEVEN-PLAYER Saturn multitap game) is to buy both Quake and Duke Nukem 3D. Once you've saved your game in Quake, load up Duke and you'll see the Death Tank option on the title screen. ED LOMAS QU GOT THE ROCKETS QUAKE (2) CVG OPINION LIGHTING GUN O The lighting in Quake is one of the features of the game that actually improves on the PC version. Coloured lighting (which is in PC Quake 2 if you have a 3Dfx card) is the main area of improvement. Muzzle flash lights up the surrounding scenery and enemy fire does likewise. The most spectacular effects you get are from the power-ups such as Quad Damage and the Pentagram of Protection. Sometimes it all seems a bit too much for a dark game like Quake, but technoheads are bound to be seriously impressed. Last issue CVG rightly proclaimed that Duke Nukem 3D was the greatest possible, conversion you could have hoped for... Saturn owners really have been spoiled rotten. And the spoiling continues apace with this awesome Quake conversion. Just seeing the Saturn handling graphics of this quality is cool enough, but the really great thing is that this game actually PLAYS like PC Quake. You can even perform the useful Rocket Jump (looking down, jumping and firing a rocket at the ground the blast sends you flying much higher into the air than usual). The overall experience is just uncannily similar to the PC original, it's er... uncanny. The fact that there is no DeathMatch (which makes the PC version the best game ever) is a bitter blow. The Saturn could have handled it with a link-up cable and without it, it has to be said that Duke Nukem 3D is the better buy. But look it's Quake on the Saturn it's a bloody miracle it's even here in the first place! And yes, the single-player mode is good enough to warrant purchase. So be my guest. Buy it... and feel the power! 148 MASTER REVIEW RATING Amazing graphics, ace gameplay and cool sounds. Only the lack of multiplayer counts against this otherwise mind-bogglingly good game. 109 "

BOMBERMAN 64 omberman has had a busy year! The updated version of the ever popular SNES game took a long time coming, but when it finally did, it was in all shapes and sizes. First we had the excellent Saturn version, then the not so cool Atomic Bomberman on PC, there was even a key ring game for the hardcore fans. This latest Hudson offering sees our cute little hero in 3D for the first time, ready to take action and save his home planet from the assortment of baddies yet again.

Each world of course has its own boss, each boss has numerous minions. Some of them are very cute, like butterflies, penguins and squishy jelly things that merely knock you unconscious, which can be potentially dangerous (when you're on the edge of a cliff and this SC00022CNE happens). When you complete the first level of each world you have to defeat the sub-boss to continue. Sub-bosses look like full-armoured robotic knights and are fairly easy to defeat.

NINTENDO 1930 00016 0001203 Bomberman is an old formula: take an appealing little character, give him some bombs and some bricks to explode and have fun. Could this be interesting again? Well, Bomberman 64 has got some news for you: first of all, our hero can use his bombs to jump across platforms, much like a trampoline. He can also stack them on top of each other to reach obstacles and power-ups that are normally too high. You start the game with two bombs instead of one, and you don't need a glove in order to pick up, throw or kick bombs, so this saves you a lot of searching. There are standard black bombs and red nuclear ones for more impact. You can hit your enemies with a bomb and knock them unconscious for a few seconds. Just enough time to pick them up and do with them as you please. In the battle mode you can pick up and pester other players. 00017769 1 A tree, but where is the B-man hiding? 1 He was there all along. Stupid camera! Hurrah, for the big yellow bird and his help. C00023.178 KRA 01 DOD 10 DALLJENI The best part of previous Bomberman games was always the battle mode. In this N64 version more attention has been paid to the game mode, so there are only six different battle stages and a four-player game here. If you've played the High Ten Saturn B-Man mode you might think this isn't much, but the battle stages are all 3D and feature multiple levels. Once someone is killed, they can come back as ghosts and try to stop the other players from winning. You can also team up and fight only against the opposite team. In this mode you have an infinite number of lives and the aim is to explode all of the other teams' crystals. And don't forget that the bombs don't explode in squares anymore plenty of nasty surprises there! L00033559 L 00021713 BOMBERMAN 64 CVG OPINION Pretty gardens, but not much space to run or hide. Oil Rig. It looks cool though it's far too small. 01:08 0 00 00 00 Bomberman 64 took some getting used to it's the same concept as the previous games but it lacks some of the simplicity and gameplay. Since Hudson have done such a good job on Saturn Bomberman earlier in the year, I found myself comparing the two and Bomberman 64 doesn't live up to it. The graphics are good, but the fact that you have to change the camera angles your self all the time, just doesn't help the game. The battle mode, my favourite Bomberman part, is far too short and the battle stages too similar to Mario Kart 64. Still, after the initial disappointment I enjoyed the game, not as much as I expected, but it's still fun.

Stalinism BY BERKELY SYSTEMS 1-3 PLAYERS ou Don't Know Jack is a quiz game for up to three players. You each have a \"buzzer\" on the keyboard and go through various rounds answering all sorts of questions. Although they're all of a comical nature, they still require you to have a fairly well-tuned brain. Most questions are multiple choice, but there are quick-fire bonus rounds and some where you must type answers. The voice of the presenter is done by Paul Kaye (used to \"do\" Dennis Pennis) but the sense of humour is really forced on you the whole way through. It's also the kind of humour that will only appeal to 35 year olds who think Hale and Pace are funny. YDKI would make a great after-pub game, but there aren't going to be many people who will want to bother setting up their PC after a drinking session. It can be a lot of fun, but isn't worth the money for most people.

PS CORRIDOR ROM JEDI KNIGHT: DARK FORCES 2 OUT NOW BY LUCASARTS 1-8 PLAYERS edi Knight is a game I've been waiting for since the first Dark Forces came out. Although it was excellent, there were so many possibilities for a Star Wars corridor game. The enemies are now properly 3D instead of the sprites in the first game, but there's something very unstylish about some parts. Kyle's hands when he punches, and the passive computer characters who slide around like Weebles are very strange. The later levels look a lot better especially when running on 3Dfx, and the third-person view also helps the look of the game. To begin with, the game seems pretty poor, but as you play and gain more Force Powers it gets a lot better. The plot draws you in and the levels get more and more imaginative (and bigger and bigger), and it becomes far more \"Star Wars\". There are better corridor games on the PC, but Jedi Knight will certainly keep fans happy.

PlayStation RISK NOV RELEASE @ MINI REVIEWS BY HASBRO 1-4 PLAYERS he classic board game of world domination with loads of new bits. As well as the original modes, there are plenty of options which you can change to customise the game completely. You can play on more local maps, like Europe, which is divided into loads of separate areas for variety. Or you can play in the excellent new mode, Ultimate Risk, which adds things such as varying terrain, generals who can command more men, new weapons, and more, making it more of a strategy war game. Also, instead of the Ultimate Risk battles relying on dice rolls, they are won or lost depending on your strategic position, terrain, battle techniques, etc. The graphics are very basic but stick to the traditional Risk style well. PlayStation Risk is most likely to appeal to big fans of the board game who want something more, rather than those who've never played before.

"computer video games BOARD GAME $ MONOPOLY PlayStation NOV RELEASE 1,040 1.200 BY GREMLIN 1-4 PLAYERS veryone knows Monopoly it's one of the best board games ever. Unfortunately, this is completely the wrong way to make it into a video game. Unlike Risk there are no new game modes, only options to let you set up whatever rules you're used to playing (including the Free Parking gets all paid fines rule). The game looks rubbish, as you'd expect, but it's also really badly worked out. All the menus take ages to go through, and setting up deals is such a boring process you can hardly be bothered. The computer intelligence is the one thing they needed to get right, but it's rubbish. I bought Park Lane for  then got offered  straight after by a computer player. He then went on to lower his offer every go from then on. There's no reason to buy this over the board game whatsoever.

CUTE RACING PlayStation MOTOR MASH OUT NOW (907 BY OCEAN 1-4 PLAYERS nother pretender to the Micro Machines throne. Motor Mash borrows from all the similar titles but offers nothing new. The game looks great with some very nice graphics, but excitement is nowhere to be found. We've seen and played this type of game many times before that you always know what's coming next, so there are no real surprises. The usual range of courses are on offer including the Wild West, the frozen Arctic and the Amazon jungle. The fact that races are viewed from an isometric angle, which results in the race often being obscured by track side objects, does not help proceedings. The selectable drivers themselves are the usual bunch of stereotypes, including a soldier who drives a tank now there's a surprise. Motor Mash is a good example of a game that could have been great, because the groundwork is there. What we're left with is a pale imitator of what is one of the best games on the market.

PlayStation NHL 98 OUT NOW BY EA SPORTS 1-8 PLAYERS 've always been a bit partial to the latest EA Hockey installment, and can safely say that the '98 incarnation is the best for a long time. First off, and most importantly EA have had the good sense to ignore the pressure from the NHL, and have put the fighting back in. The speed of the game is the best since the introduction of polygons to the sports range, and the camera angles work. Angles and indeed coaching options can also be changed during play, so there's no having to pause and access numerous menus to get the results you want. Instead these commands are now a simple button push away. Everything about this game is better than last year's offering, with lots of new options including shorter seasons, plus commentary that actually seems to work for a change. If you haven't enjoyed a hockey game since the first EA Hockey sequel, then I suggest you seriously take a good look at this you'll be surprised.

The classic Sega coin-op-cum-hugely popular computer game of the 80's. Now it's back, but on PlayStation bizarrely, not Saturn. And things have changed a bit too. In fact this is more like Super Frogger. For a start all the graphics are now 3D, although the action is still viewed from above. While the game opens with a series of stages built around the original 'cross-road-use-logs-to-cross-river' levels, it soon transforms. Before long you're hopping up hills, down fast flowing rivers, through dog-filled kennels, over clouds and through factories. Risky tampering, but the result works. Fortunately Hasbro have kept the gameplay much the same you're still dodging everything and finding Frogger's kids. Four-player mode adds new techniques, like standing on other players so they can't move. Good solid fun, the only thing is, it's very tough!

"computer games HIGHWAY STAR W TOADTOURING CAR championship Just how accurate is Codemasters' TOCA Touring Car Championship? \"Dangerous\" Ed Lomas went to the fantastic Brands Hatch racing circuit to find out. CP Mobil VECTRA The beautiful Kent countryside. Twittering birds, mooing cows, fluttering butterflies AND NOISY HIGH-SPEED CARS SCREAMING ROUND BRANDS HATCH! Ed was at one of the most famous race courses in the country to find out how close to the real thing TOCA Touring Car Championship is. The Slalom Course 1. PREPARE TO QUALIFY! | 2. THE SLALOM \"The first challenge of the day was driving a BMW around the Brands Hatch Indy circuit the short version of the track used for most races, including the Touring Car ones. After being harnessed into the driver's seat, I thought it only fair to tell the expert next to me that I hadn't driven for over three years. The expert didn't care. He only started to care when I nearly drove into the pit lane wall. After a few laps of tuition, learning the braking and turning points of each corner it went a bit smoother, gradually picking up speed each time round. It's simple really brake in a straight line, turn into the corner later than you'd expect, clip the kerb at the apex and accelerate through. It's also a lot of fun. After thinking that I was driving around the circuit as quickly as was possible, was proven wrong by the poor expert who had been stuck in the car with me. He took control and went round so quickly my guts nearly came out of my ears. Even better fun!\" \"The second 'event' involved a small car with a bowl fitted to the front. In this bowl was a ball. If the ball rolled out of the bowl while driving around a slalom course, you had to stop the car, get out, put it in and get back in the car. The idea was to drive smoothly, keeping the ball in the bowl. My incredible lack of control was demonstrated as I shot forward past one cone, dragged the next one under my rear wheel, then stopped suddenly to get rid of it firing the ball off my bonnet. After spluttering around losing the ball many more times, I got back to the start with the worst time of the day. It was good fun though.\" Who put that cone under my wheel? How inconsiderate. TOCA TOURING CAR CHAMPIONSHIP FOR REAL! The Pit Lane Why didn't someone tell me my ball was hanging out? This is where Ed nearly drove a BMW into a wall. A speedy Formula First car. Ed wasn't allowed to drive these. SLALOM 3 4. THE GAME 3. THE AUTO TEST \"After a hard morning of speeding around in real cars, we went to the trackside York Suite for a go at Codemasters' simulation of the course in TOCA Touring Car Championship. Though I'd not played the game before, the driving technique and braking points I'd learned out on the track worked perfectly in the game, allowing me to get round the virtual circuit with no bother. Unfortunately, although I was hoping to save myself from complete embarassment by doing well at the game, I didn't win it. Fun, but no banana.\" \"Similar to the 'ball-in-bowl-on In fact, I missed first gear on bonnet' thing, this involved two attempts as I rolled backdriving a cooler, faster car wards towards the thin fence around a more complex slalom seperating me from one of the course. After chugging away fastest parts of the circuit. 1 from the start and going eventually found first gear and through the cones, I reversed sped up the hill with my tyres quickly through some more and screeching, clouds of smoke put the car in first gear. Nearly. billowing off them. Great fun!\" The York Suite FEATURED TODJE OB DOST THE VERDICT Ed's rubbish at driving, and Touring Car Championship is extremely close to the real thing. Simple. 114 "
