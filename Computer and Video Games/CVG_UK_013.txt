In the ROM are lower case letters, bombs, bullets, rockets, tanks, a complete set of invaders graphics and that only accounts for about 50 of them, there are still about 400 left that may give you an idea as to the scope of the new ROM).

"YULETIDE INVADERS This here's my newsagent NEXT The world of electronic toys and games comes to Computer & Video Games. Still in time for Christmas we'll be sifting through the latest bleeping, burping and talking creations which are chipping away at the established toy market. For the chess enthusiasts amongst you, we'll have a rundown on the chess machines which are expected to sell this yuletide. From the expensive coffee-table versions, to the travelling companion sets, we'll find out the advantages these dedicated machines have over microcomputer chess programs. And completing Santa's shopping list will be a pick of the software selection for TV Games Centres and the more popular computers. Me 'n my newsagent are real close. His name's Bill or Fred or something... Anyway we got an arrangement. Every month, you know what he does? He looks out my copy of Computer & Video Games and keeps it, just for me. So none of the other punks on the street can get hold of my copy. And that's important to me. Mebbe it's important to you too. So go n' see your newsagent with that coupon below all filled out. If he's like Harry here, you're gonna like him. To my newsagent: Please deliver/ reserve me a copy of Computer and Video Games every month. Price 75p. Name Address.... THE SHAPE OF THINGS NEXT end of its run. And Keith Mott will be writing his last piece for us under that banner in this issue. Then he is being rested for December before returning in January with a projects page which will help you to get more out of your computer. Star Guard sets you the task of preserving fuel pods from a MONT fleet of attacking saliens. Granny is probably not in the best of taste but its heart is in the right place so we published it anyway. GAME WITH A DIFFERENCE The more observant among you may have noticed a few changes taking place among C&VGs more regular features. The disappearance of Down to Basic is one example. In this issue you will find no Brainware as this has been replaced by our Puzzling pages. And other changes to the format are coming soon. Down to Basic will be replaced next month by a column more suited to most home computer owners and especially the games players. Machine code is already understood by many of C&VGs readers (especially the younger ones it seems) but for those of you who have not yet grasped the fundamentals we are starting up a column to help you get to grips with it. The column is being written by Ted Ball and since we don't want to overload him too much, the December Practical Programming will be the last in the series. Our machine code series will quickly be followed by an article showing you how to put your newfound knowledge to good use in setting up a wargame format, but more of that at a later date. Kit Korner is also coming to the HIS PRIZE The Seventh Empire was the rebel which challenged the stable rule of the known galaxy and set a pattern of warring confusion which holds sway to this day. Piracy became commonplace, no planet was safe from the threat of invasion and whole star systems changed allegiance as the tribes fought for the raw materials on which galatic fortunes rested. The Seventh Empire is the name of a computer game so different it will take us three issues to get it started. December sets the scene of the game which can even be played by those without a home computer. Winner of our Beat-the-Bugs Competition, Mark Williams from Sutton Coldfield in Birmingham came down to visit us and collect his BBC Model B machine. Mark was also given a selection of Acornsoft cassettes to go with his machine courtesy of Small Enterprises and Acorn. But his success did not stop here, for a local businessman, who heard of Mark's programming expertise has asked him to help set up a microcomputer system for his insurance broker firm.

Minimum product of node sums = 25625600 3. Maximum sum of node products = 2925 4. Minimum sum of node products = 1212 The solution to October's Nevera Crossword is printed right. Confessions of a Bug In the realm of fantasy, one computer has to stand out. I refer of course to the Dragon 32 smoking away quietly in that dark corner A Dragon microcomputer will go to the winner of our fantasy ideas competition. So if you could find room in your house for a well-behaved Dragon then read on... or better still read the feature on page 24 first. If you've digested the tips on building your own computer fantasy game we now want you to dig deep into your imagination and come up with just such a game. You can either go back in history (or even pre-history) to set your game against a backdrop, like Gladiator. Or you can go forward into a distant future. But fantasy should put no holds or bars on your imagination and perhaps you would like to set this particular adventure in a time that never was. Your entry should include: The idea: not just a title but a description of how you think the game would work and how it would be operated The algorithms: the basic functions which would form the core of the program and determine the outcome of conflicts. Practicality: a paragraph outlining why you think the game would be commercially viable. The entries should be sent to: Fantasy Competition, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal hill, London ECIR 5JB and reach us before 16 November 1982. They will be judged by Mitre The Welsh Dragon has made a fiery entrance to the microcomputer market Styling itself the \"family\" microcomputer, it is selling well at its  price tag and looks set for a good Christmas. The winner of our Fantasy Game Competition will have a Dragon on his hearth complete with 32K of memory and a screen size of 16 lines by 32 characters. It plugs into the common domestic television and uses a household cassette recorder to save and load programs. It already has several fantasy adventures in its software range and with independent software houses now producing games cassettes for it, the machine should soon have a comprehensive library of games software behind it. So no dragon feet, get those imaginations working overtime and those entries off quickly. Wargames, whose Mark Blundell wrote the article on building a fantasy game and if they are sufficiently impressed, Mitre have undertaken to try and turn the winning entry into a computer moderated game and invite the prizewinner to help produce and market it on a royalties basis. Employees of EMAP, Dragon Data and Mitre Wargames and their relatives may not enter the competition. The judge's decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into. There's nothing we Bugs like better than a good Atari program to get our teeth into. T. Hitch has run up an Atari bugging routine so sophisticated and subtle that it defies solution. Take Wild Strawberries for example: never in the history of this magazine has a readership been so split over a program. Half of them seem completely unable to get the game running no matter what. The other half are phoning up to congratulate C&VG on producing such a good Atari game which runs first time on being entered. Even better, the ones who have problems all claim a different line as being the culprit. You should see the poor editor tearing his hair out trying to understand what's going on. The only piece of advice he can offer is to check all the 0 and Os in the program carefully Vic owners may have had some difficulty with Brick Blaster as the cursor control symbols have printed up badly. If you have had problems with this game please ring or write for a correction sheet. COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPET "

"It is ironic that one of mankind's most practical and logical 20th Century tools should provide so many opportunities for fantastic and historic escapism. Many computer games indulge us in our quests for myths and legends on exotic planets and more romantic eras. We asked Mark Blundell of computer moderated gaming company, Mitre Wargames, to explain how to map out computer controlled worlds and times as the fabric for a fantasy game. BUILDING A COMPUTER WORLD BY MARK BLUNDELL Illustration: Jon Davis A hot, dusty afternoon. The crowd was impatient, chanting and jeering, when suddenly there was hush: two tough, wiry figures strode into the arena, armed and ready for combat. The tension broke, and wild cheers rang out — some for one, some for the other. Who will triumph in this deadly tussle of strength, wits and fortune? The Gladiator combat has begun... You may remember reading about computer-moderated playby-mail games in May's issue of Computer & Video Games. A new addition to this field is Gladiator which is particularly close to our hearts, being not only British, but also entirely our own creation. I have set down here the background to the game, for those of you who are interested in play-by-mail (P.B.M.) games or who are thinking of creating one of your own. One advantage of computer moderated games is that a large number of players can have their moves processed quickly and cheaply. It can also cater for complicated interaction between rival players without deluging them with extensive rules or requiring detailed analysis of a player's movements. Lastly the computer acts as an unbiased and unmovable authority on the interpretation of the rules and how they are carried out. The biggest drawback is lack of flexibility as the programmer is unlikely to predict every possible development of the game he has created. When we first developed Gladiator we tried to produce a game which made the most of the computer's strengths. Having established the need for the game, we looked for a suitable subject, one which readily lent itself to computerisation. Many ideas were considered before we decided on the excitement of combat in the ancient arena as the ideal choice. In the system we have developed for Gladiator there are a limited number of variables, all interacting to produce results the prime requisite for a computermoderated game. Gladiator meshes in very well with one of our existing games, The Tribes of Crane, so that players from there provide a basic nucleus for the game, giving a full number of gladiators eager for combat from the very start. For a game set in the sword-tosword combat of the arena, we clearly needed a blow-by-blow description of the fight and of the moments when the telling strokes were made. To generate this, we would need to input a number of variables supplied by the player, and let the computer \"play\" with them according to a suitable program to generate the result. Variables such as these are an essential ingredient of any computer-moderated game. In the arena we decided that there would be three broad categories of variable: the ability of the gladiator; his tactics; and luck. We allocated these groupings to the three types of variable we wanted to input into the program. First, there were variables which were constant for each individual gladiator in all of his flights: his experience, special skills, and so on. Second, factors that varied for each gladiator, fight by fight choices of tactics, special weapons or special plans. Finally, there are variables generated by the computer itself the inevitable random element. As all of our other games are role-playing games, where the player assumes the persona of a tribal chief or planet ruler, we naturally felt that the character of the Gladiator should be important. The whole of a player's first turn is spent in creating his fighter. The player has a number of points which he can allocate to the various attributes of the warrior, like strength, speed and intelligence. This choice is crucial as each attribute will have a different effect on each of the different kinds of stroke available to the gladiator in all his fights. Tactics are devised by the player for each individual fight in which his gladiator participates. There are six basic strokes from which to choose, 24 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"1. Variable value eg. y ax Variable value og v ax 5. Vanable value eg: y 2. Vanable value og: y 3. Variable value egy = a VX and the wise gladiator will concentrate on those where his natural abilities are most powerful. The opponent's previous fights will be studied, in order to plan the best tactics against him. 30 consecutive strokes are chosen on the turn sheet, and these are processed in order by the computer, simultaneously with the strokes of the opponent. The gladiator's basic details his main attributes and special abilities are input when the gladiator is first set up, and stored on a floppy disc. Whenever a turn for that gladiator is processed, the tactics he has chosen are input and the attributes recalled from the disc. These attributes are then used to modify the percentage chance of scoring a hit with the tactics chosen. This modification system is the core of the program. Graphs were drawn to show the shape of the effect which we wished each attribute to have as its strength (the points allocated to it by the player) varied; and then functions were devised to achieve the desired patterns. The gladiator's attributes are compared with those of his opponent to determine the chance of hitting on any particular stroke for each gladiator. This involves crossreferencing the two strokes with each other, as there is a matrix for the chances which different strokes have against one another. Random numbers are then generated by the computer and compared to the modified base percentage chance of a hit to see if one has actually been achieved. This is the luck element. If you decide to devise your own game, the functions and algorithms which are the core of any game program, should have considerable thought devoted to them. The way in which you want each variable to affect the result is crucial. I have shown some examples of functions (above) but there are obviously many others, as well as other variations of these, which can be devised to give an infinite range of effects. You may need to talk to a friendly mathematician to turn the graph or diagram into an algorithm the computer can use. One last important consideration is the gradient or slope of these functions. These will determine precisely how much each change in value of the variable alters the effect it has on the result. These are crucial to play-balance and the only 1. This is a straight line function where the effect of this variable on the result is directly proportional to the value of the variable. By inverting the graph (downward sloping linel you would achieve an inversely proportional effect. 2. Bell curve. In this graph, the mid-range of valves for the variable would have the most effect. Obviously you can think of your own applications of all these curves, but this one would lend itself well to the application of luck in many games the extremes having a markedly different effect to the majority. An inverse bell curve (upside-down!) might be even more appropriate here. 3. Diminishing marginal returns. With this function, each amount added to the value of the variable has less effect than the previous one. A useful function in the allocation of scarce resources if you feel they should be evenly spread between variables. 4. Increasing marginal returns. This function is the inverse 3. Here each increase in the value of the variable produces a greater effect than the previous one. Here you would be encouraging a greater divergence of values on variables, and more varied results. 5. This graph shows the mirror image of 4. Here each increase in the variable produces reduction in its effect on the game, with each fall producing a lesser decrease than the previous one ATTACK TACTICS Fast Early Slow DEFENCE TATICS Break Cross Build-up Shadow Attackers 15% 30% Intercept Passes 30% Use a sweeper 5% 15% 30% 6. A simple matrix from World Cup Manager where the percentages indicate how team tactics influence a scoring chance in this particular situation. So playing a sweeper proves the best defence against a fast break way to achieve a good balance is through rigorous play-testing. It may sound dry stuff but this is the crux of the game and the most exciting part of seeing your creation come to life is seeing how the algorithms respond to a set of circumstances and then tuning them to achieve believable results. Don't make the mistake of choosing an all-powerful tactic which will win no matter what, players will quickly find it. Instead produce a matrix where the tactics entered by either side are compared and the results taken into account when finalising the outcome. A simple matrix of the sort used in World Cup Manager (C&VG June) is also illustrated above. To add to the personality and excitment of the game various wrinkles and tweaks should be added to the basic algorithms. In Gladiator, for example, the combatants may elect to begin with a spear cast before closing in or can fight to the death instead of just until first blood is drawn. In the army chieftain type of P.B.M. it is possible to account for such things as lowering morale following a defeat or a long route march. In individual games like Gladiator exhaustion during a fight is catered for, as the combat draws on the fighters become more vulnerable and less effective. Can they summon up those extra reserves of strength to deliver that crucial blow. Often disregarded by the amateur who gets bogged down in computer code is the presentation of the game. Writing up games rules in an easy-to-follow, and imaginative way is part-and-parcel of producing a good game. If you are asking players to fit into a world of your making then you must bring that world to life for them. Don't skimp over the rules you had to compromise your ideals on, every part of the game should be fitted into the context of the world and the rules and customs by which it works.

"Why can't a computer think like a man? Even the best chess-playing machines searching huge trees of variations have still not reached master standard and only a few are good enough to trouble the strong amateur human player. Might it not be better to approach the problem another way how do grandmasters think? All the grandmasters mentioned from an unfamiliar game, but only for a few seconds. The task was then to recall the position, for example by setting it up on an empty board. The results of this experiment were intriguing, grandmasters and masters recalled approximately 93% of pieces correctly, experts recalled 72% and lower-level players recalled about 51%. However, when the same experiA common myth — particularly among non-players — is that grandmasters look at every possible variation for many moves ahead. A little calculation reveals that this must be false. Suppose each side had 10 legal moves at every turn, then to look ahead three moves for each side would involve considering a million positions. A grandmaster may well need to look ahead at least 6 or 7 moves for each side during the course of a game and cannot possibly process all the necessary positions in the time allowed. In any case there is no evidence that they even attempt to do so. There is a famous remark attributed to the grandmaster Reti. When asked how many moves he saw ahead, Reti is alleged to have replied: \"only one move the right one\". The Dutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made a study of what factors determined chess skill in the 1930s and 1940s and published his findings in a classic work Thought and Choice in Chess. To do justice to this book would require many articles, but a few examples will give the flavour of the work. In one experiment, de Groot showed a series of unfamiliar positions to chess players at all levels of skill from world championship level (Alekhine, Keres and Euwe were all included) to club players. Each player's task was to choose a move and think out loud while doing so. De Groot recorded their verbal statements and used them to estimate how much searching each player carried out in finding a move. Figure 1 shows one of de Groot's positions, with White to play. You may like to try it yourself before reading on. The results cast an interesting light on grandmaster skill particularly in relation to the nearest group of lesser players, designated as \"ex perts\". There were five grandmasters tested and four of them chose the correct move in Figure 1. None of the five experts tested picked it. their analysis, but only 2 of the 5 \"experts\" did. Measurements of time taken to make a decision, number of moves considered etc. did not convincingly differentiate the two groups, with one exception: the \"value\" they estimated for the chosen move where the grandmasters were much more accurate. Revealing the average depth of search for both grandmaster and \"expert\" on Figure I was much less than some might have expected, a relatively humble seven ply-four moves for White and three for Black at -WA000 mised possibly illegal — positions of pieces, the grandmasters! advantage vanished. All the subjects performed equally badly, recalling only 3 or 4 pieces correctly. It is reasonable to deduce that on the former task (recalling \"genuine\" positions), the grandmasters were recalling not individual disjoint piece positions, but clusters of pieces or significant patterns. To illustrate this, consider Figure l again — although it was not, in fact, one of the positions used in the second experiment. A cursory inspection shows a King-side castled formation for both sides, Queen Rooks opposed on an open file, two knights on \"Bishop 3\", an isolated Queen Pawn on Q4 supporting a White Knight on K5 and blockaded by a Black Knight on Q4. There is a White Bishop on KNS pinning the Knight on Black's KB3 which is defended by a Bishop on K2. Black has a fianchettoed Bishop pawn formation (KB2, KN3, KR2) although his King's Bishop is out of place. These are all features which occur in innumerable positions, but would not be recognised by the beginner — or the computer. Where does all this leave us? Grandmasters seem to analyse no better than experts, but recognise more features of a position which somehow prompt them to find good moves. How many features are there altogether? If we could identify them and put them into a program, would we have a \"grandmaster program\"? I will return to this topic next month. 2 A1 i 1 i Fig 1. a b c d e f g h The \"millions of variations supposedly explored had also shrunk to an average of 35 moves in total. It seems clear that the grandmasters were able to perceive some feature of Figure I which the experts could not, even though they were able to analyse just as well in every measurable way. In case you have not yet found the correct move, it is BxN(Q5)). A second experiment reinforced and clarified the importance of perception in chess. This time de Groot again permitted his subjects to look at a position again permitted his subjects to look at a position BY MAX BRAMER "

"55 MORREES MET a Music Composer Scram Graph-it Intro to BASIC1 3.7 million reasons why the Atari Home Computer is something to see. The display screen used with our computers is composed of 192 horizontal lines, each containing 320 dots. Delivering colour and luminosity instructions to each dot for a second requires 3.7 million cycles...a lot of work for the normal 6502 processor That's why the Atari computer has equipped its 6502 with its own electronic assistant. It's called ANTIC, and it handles all the display work, leaving the 6502 free to handle the rest. What this means to you is uncompromisingly spectacular display capabilities without loss of computer power needed to carry out the demands of your program, That's a quality you just don't find in ordinary home computers. And it's one of the reasons some computer experts say that Atari computers are so far ahead of their time. There's more...which is what youd expect from Atari Language. The Atari Home Computer uses several programming languages to give the user maximum control of its extraordinary capabilities. PILOT, Microsoft BASIC and Atari BASIC are understood and spoken by the Atari computer. You'll also find our Assembler Editor cartridge indispensable for machine language programming Sound. An Ataricomputer has foursound generators, or voices, activated by a separate microchip. This leaves the principal microprocessor chips free to perform other tasks. And you can take full advantage of this capability which is designed for easy programming. Change. Atari Home Computers have been designed to make change and expansion easy. The Atari computer has a modular operating system that can be easily replacedas new technology develops. If you need it, memory expansion requires no more than inserting additional RAM modules. And the Atari ROM cartridge system also makes it easy to change languages. In short, your Atari computer won't become obsolete by future developments...because it already incorporates the future.

Well this is the game for you. But you'll have to be a real cool customer to become a top ice-cream vendor at Microville-bythe-Sea. Up to four players can take part in this buying and selling game. Each player runs a van selling ices and lollies at our favourite seaside resort. You are in charge for just seven days and each morning you must buy up stock keeping a careful eye on the weather forecast as the number of customers you get will obviously vary according to the variable sunshine factor and if it's a weekday or weekend. So check out your chimes and start praying for a heatwave! The program will work for both Apple II and Pet, the only difference in the listing being line 700 which is a subroutine for clearing the screen.

"URANIUM It's the 21st Century and man can travel all over the galaxy, has learnt the secret of virtual immortality and how to use an electro-static toothbrush in a weightless environment. But things haven't changed that much, there's still a fuel crisis going on... and the present state of the interstellar recession... Well, who knows where you'll stand one millennia to the next? The Klingons have put up the price of uranium rods again and here you are stranded on planet with a great stack of the fuel which the known galaxy is crying out for and no easy way to get it on board your ship. The problem lies in the dreaded anti-matter rods which are mixed in with the uranium, a false move and you could see the whole lot disappear into limbo. If you could just master these paddle controls... The instructions are included with this simulated computer reconstruction of the dilemma. Good loading.

"ROADA OLUL RUNS ON A SHARP MZ-SOK IN 4K Kerrinch! Skerrape! Ouch! Driving your Sharpmobile can be a tough business. Your only aim is to keep bumping the computer controlled car before it bumps you! You score a point for each contact with the computer's car. But you must avoid the unwary pedestrians who cross you path. If you hit one the computer gets a point. It also scores if the computer car hits your much dented vehicle. You can select the speed of the cars and the number of pedestrians at the start of each game. The score and time are displayed throughout the game. Be warned, the computer's car is difficult to catch! BY FRANK ROONEY Illustration: Terry Rogers 28 REM *** FR.

"REVERSI MIRROR ON MEMORY I have indicated the basic strategies for playing the game of Reversi, also known as Othello. There are three basic \"Rules of Thumb\": (1) Aim to capture the corners, while avoiding playing near the corners for fear of giving your opponent a chance. (2) Capture as few pieces as possible early on, as it ironically weakens your position to capture too many. (3) Avoid taking sides unless you are running out of options, as they are a liability at the end. These three 'thumbs' can be carefully balanced to form an effective algorithm for playing Othello. Obvious exceptions can also be added, such as take maximum pieces near the end. But no general \"thumb package\" can always find the best play, without a detailed list of exceptions to mirror the way a skilled human selects moves by experience. The ideal would be a massive memory bank of all possible positions, to tell a computer the best move in each case. You would need to use the whole planet earth as a store for that massive job, and hitchhikers won't always find the answer is 42! Human beings manage with their limited memory by being very selective in what they learn. We can do the same with a computer, because the symmetry of the board combines nicely with the fact that BY JOHN BALL It is surprising how we all assume certain abilities in human beings. For example, I covered many important side positions in my book Key To Othello with the assumption that my readers had the ability to spot mirror images elsewhere on the board in real games. Computers do not have this in-built pattern recognition, so have to be taught. most vital plays are on the side two rows of the board. If we work out all the positions for one side, that our Thumbs have missed, we can then describe a mirror image for that same side to cover positions that are the same but the other way round. The same patterns can then be repeated for the other three sides. This provides a memory hall of eight mirrors for the computer to reflect on. To save memory space, a system of labels for just one \"set\" can be re-used eight times for the mirrors, by suitable computer loops. Then any additional positions you discover need only be written in once in the mirror section How does this mirror system work? Basically, you are putting special attractive values to a square if the position around it fits a certain shape. For example in figure 1, there is a hole in a side at \"A\". If as Black, you don't play there, your opponent will, gaining an option as well as a solid side. Othello is all about fighting for options choices of moves So such spots should be pounced on. Simply tell the computer in the mirror section that if b, c, and d are occupied, then play at A, or at least make A highly attractive. A more complicated item is shown in figure 2. Your opponent has played a terrible move near a corner. To exploit this fully you must play first at F, then at G, then at H, all the time watching out for any replies that should evoke a different response. The end result should be a captured corner, and an easily won game. So put lots of ifs and buts in the memory mirror, to make sure that the computer plays in the correct sequence. Watch out for cracks in the mirror. In figure 3, playing as Black at I is obviously essential to save the corner at J. So you describe the five pieces in between, and say that I is massively attractive. But what if white had a piece at J? Then it becomes essential to avoid I, as it would give away the whole side and next corner. So make sure that you specify all the relvant squares. Once you have a mirror system establishedevery time you discover a weakness in the computer's play you simply add another line to the mirror memory, saying \"stop playing that rubbish move in that position, play this instead\". It should remember more consistently than you so watch out. Figure 1. Figure 3 OHF G O A cd OOI Figure 2. "

"Graphics de Figure 2 PATTERNS AND PROGRAMS Constructing patterns is a good way to illustrate how to build programs. Just as a complicated pattern can be developed using simpler sub-patterns, so a complex program can be developed from simpler sub-programs In dealing with graphics programming there is direct correspondence between the way in which a pattern is built up and the way the program to draw it is constructed. For this reason a pattern can actually be seen as a picture representing the structure of the program that drew it. Making patterns with a micro is also a fascinating way to use it and to show off its graphics capabilities. Random patterns can be generated quite easily, and introductory manuals for many micros contain such programs. Patterns generated in a systematic and non-random way can also be attractive and interesting. Whether or not patterns have a random element they can be informative, arising as they do in the simulation of such things as the growth of living organisms and the development of economic systems. The first requirement in displaying a pattern is to describe it to the computer, and this requires the use of a computer language. It is possible to describe patterns using Basic and the plotting commands it possesses, but other languages can be more suitable. For example, a square can be plotted using Basic with the following instructions (or with something very similar involving PLOT). 10 MOVE 0,0 20 DRAW O, 10 : DRAW 10,10 30 DRAW 10, 0: DRAW 0,0 In LOGO (or using \"Turtle graphics) a square is produced by: REPEAT 4(FORWARD 10 TURN 90) You may agree the Logo description is more natural, giving as it does a direct set of instructions for the following a square which you could actually follow yourself, whereas the Basic description requires a knowledge of where the points such as (10,10) have, perhaps arbitrarily, been placed. In any event, if you consider how to generate Figure 1 in Basic using a Figure 1. subroutine for drawing a square as the fundamental building block you may decide that it is none too easy. whereas in Logo it is quite simple. To build the pattern in Figure 1 from a square, we need a sub-program to draw a square, and in Logo this can be defined by: TO SQUARE REPEAT 4 (FORWARD 10 RIGHT 90) END Using this program, Figure 1 is generated by REPEAT 6 (FORWARD 3 RIGHT 60 SQUARE) In addition to its simplicity, the construction of this program exactly reveals that of the pattern. The Logo program uses its subprogram in exactly the same way as a Basic program can use a subroutine. However, Logo can also support recursion, so that sub-programs can call themselves, whereas most micro Basics do not. (Atom Basic and BBC Basic are notable exceptions.) The pattern of Figure 2 can be constructed using recursion. The rule for making the pattern is: Take a large triangle, and at each end of its corners construct a new triangle with half its height, then do the same for each of the new triangles and so on until the triangles become so small that we can halt. The process has been carried three times in the figure. The pattern was produced by defining TRIFILL as TO TRIFILL : SIDE IF : SIDE 5 THEN RETURN REPEAT 3 ((TREFILL( : SIDE/2) FORWARD: SIDE RIGHT 120) END and then executing TRIFILL 24 BY GARRY MARSHALL "

These may have you reaching for the trusty computer to help you through some laborious number-crunching. On some occasions, (the Mastermind puzzle) you will be invited to send in your answer to try to win a prize. Others we expect to be solved quickly. The resident puzzle master will be Trevor Truran, and we invited him to write a small biography to explain his credentials. He did! It started: \"Age: In three year's time my father's age will be double what my age was two years ago ...\" And then Trevor's natural modesty took over, so we thought we'd better take a hand. Trevor is a former puzzles editor of Games & Puzzles magazine, he now edits Top Puzzles. If you have any ideas for computer puzzles yourself, please send them in to us and we will pass them on to Trevor, he pays  for each one published. Apart from the Mastermind competition, all other puzzle solutions are printed on page 11. The answer to each clue is a sixletter word and sometimes that word is to be entered clockwise in the cells of the hexagon -starting in the numbered cell. On other occasions, though, the word to be entered is an anagram of the clue word! (Entered in just the same way). To help you decide which to use when, the answers have been so arranged that touching cells of neighbouring hexagons will both have the same letter. One pair has been filled in to give MASTERMIND COMPETITION a peg is not the right colour. For example: if the hidden code was: red, blue, blue, white. And you tried: red, white, black, blue, the line would show a marker for the No, don't panic! We are not going to strap you into an overgrown black leather chair and grill you for two minutes on Pre-Dynastic Etruscan Pottery. All you have to do is crack the codes hidden in these examples of Invicta's classic peg puzzle. Each picture shows you the position in a computer generated game just before the hidden line is correctly formed. There are six colours to choose from and they may be repeated though there will be no blanks in the code. Each attempt has been scored at the side a black marker indicates that a peg is the correct colour in the right hole; a white marker shows that a correct colour peg is in the wrong hole. A blank shows that red and two white markers representing white and blue. When you have used the clues given in each picture, write your answers to the codes on a piece of paper (make sure each answer is correctly labelled A, B, C, D) and send it to: Mastermind Puzzle, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8, Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JB to reach us before 12 November 1982. The first three all-correct entries drawn from the postbag will each receive an Electronic Master Mind game, donated by Invicta Plastics. This competition is not open to any employee of East Midlands Allied Press or of Invicta Plastics or their families. The judge's decision, as usual, is final. 72 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

For a start you have to be in long trousers and not speak in a piping treble. And, if you visit the newsagent run by Chas Hands, you would need the mental agility of a man seen in a night club from a distance by his wife. As Chas cheerfully explains: \"I sell two boxes of fireworks, each containing 41 items. The first has a mixture of Rockets, Silver Serpents and Thunder-Claps and costs exactly . \"In the second there are as many Rockets as there are Thunder-Claps in the first. And likewise as many Thunder-Claps as Rockets. Both have the same quantity of Silver Serpents. The second one Just a little over . \"Oh, by the way, five Rockets here would cost you the same as 17 Silver Serpents if you could buy them separately which you can't!' How many fireworks of each type are there in the first box and what did each cost? IAN PEDDER Constable Paynting heaved a long sigh and reached resignedly for his notebook. It was just his luck to be on duty at the town roundabout when stolen goods were on the move. An informer had called the station and an inspector had called hima vehicle worth investigating had, sometime that afternoon taken the Lead Lane turning. What, he was asked, did he know about that? Not a lot, it seemed. The traffic had been heavy, the sun bright and hot. As he struggled to recall the recent past, he made notes of the vehicles and locals he knew well who had been in the area. 1. Mr Turner, who did not drive a Rolls, exited down the road immediately to the left of the one he entered along. 2. It was a woman who met the roundabout from Gold Hill but the Mini which left at Brass Street but the Estate turned off at Copper Row. 4. Mr Price, in his Maxi, took the first turning off, which wasn't Lead Lane or Copper Row. 5. Neither Mrs Downs' Van nor Mr Lucas used Copper Row or Silver Street. Here Paynting paused and reluctantly prepared himself for an apologetic meeting with his superiors. Perhaps you can do better by naming the driver of each car, the road it arrived by and the one it left by and so be able to say which car and driver should be investigated. To help you sort out the facts, the grid can be used: enter a/for a positive piece of information and a X for a negative one. Of course, no driver arrived and left by the same road.

"GOODBYE TO ALL THIS. As this is going to be the last time that Kit Korner will appear in this form I will use this opportunity to review the previous 12 issues and to relate to you some of the points I have learnt from writing them. It may come as a surprise to know that I have probably learnt more than anyone who has come to me with a problem will ever learn, in the last year, about kit building. I should therefore like to thank all of those people who made so many blunders and kept me busy trying to solve them. From the very beginning I assumed that most of my readers knew little or nothing about construction as this was the best way of reaching everyone. I progressed as time went on to consider some of the more complex aspects of the art. These I tried to explain in the simplest terms so that they followed through from the previous articles. From the limited response I have had this worked quite well. Some readers and friends, however, who already had considerable experience in this field were only really interested in the specific hints I had to give. So, altogether it worked quite well. Now here, and hopefully not in list form, are some of the more important points which I learnt from writing this page. As a result of reducing production costs the difference in price between kit and ready built models has been reduced to a point where, to a kit builder, it is tempting to buy the ready built model. I would still not do this, as to reduce the cost involved it appears that the manufacturers have failed to maintain quality. This is apparent in many of the newer models. It is therefore a great pity that so few micros are offered in kit form. Even when complicated modifications are required for, let us say, a screen memory expansion I would prefer to buy the circuit diagram from the company involved at the modification price and do the work myself. I feel most strongly that it is essential to know how your machine works if you are going to use it to the full Also, I would not undertake to build a kit with only assembly instructions. As shown with the early ZX8ls the instructions were at fault, at one point, whereas the circuit diagram was correct. I am very fortunate in having access to a complete tool kit and workshop which I have found indispensible when it comes to construction. This is also part of my job function anyway, so I am doubly fortunate. At one stage I outlined the minimum tool kit and later went on to fill it out somewhat. I discovered later that I should not have recommended the minimum version but should have gone for something a little larger. I hope that if some people did try to build a kit with the minimum of tools that they managed. I have heard no complaints. Another field that I am fortunate to be a spectator in is that of addons. Although I have not built many of these they are usually so simple as to draw no comment. The kits that are more complicated normally arrive with wellwritten instructions and are so numerous that it would require the whole of this magazine to list them, let alone review them all. The only point that comes to mind here is to make sure that the kit does come with a full set of instructions and diagrams. If they do not you should ask for them as a condition of purchase saying that you do not consider the kit complete without having them. Be a little wary of kits that either originate from abroad or, worse, are mailed from overseas without there being an office in this country. Not all, or even many, are pirates but someone will be unfortunate and find one that is. The only thing to do is to inform the Director of Fair Trading and all the magazines you care to. You may be lucky and with the possible help of others be able to salvage something from the kit. I sincerely hope that no one does discover a pirate the hard way. I did not, at the very beginning, believe that I knew it all\" and did consult as many of my friends and colleagues as I could to find out their opinion which has proved useful in many instances. Unfortunately many of the mistakes I have come across could have been avoided so easily if the offender had consulted someone with a little more experience for just five minutes. I have stressed the point in the past that if you feel uneasy about some aspect of kit building, stop and consult someone about it. Even contact the suppliers if need be. They will be only too grateful to you for bringing the difficulty to their attention. I am afraid that this will not be the last time I will mention this though. I hope that this page has been of some help to those who have begun kit building and that you have enjoyed it as much as I. BY KEITH MOTI "

"I've been telling you over the past year. All the questions can be answered by reading the Adventure pages in the past years' issues of Computer & Video Games THE YEAR OF ADVENTURE Well, here we are one year later and still going strong! Adventure is as popular as ever, with an increasing variety of games on the market for every conceivable machine. In the course of the next year 1 hope to tell you what it is like to play Adventure on a PDP-11, introduce you to Captain 80's Book of Adventure, and give you an assessment of what appears to be the Adventure programmers \"last one\". In the meantime here's an \"endof-term exam to see whether you've been paying attention to what ADVENTURE QUIZ 1. What advantages does a machine-code Adventure have over one written in Basic? 2. In what Adventure might you find patches of oily slime? 3. What could give you heartburn if your stomach was grumbling? 4. Who are you likely to find following you around in a pyramid? 5. Why would a telescope prove useless on Wizard's Mountain? 6. If you were a Hellfire Warrior, name two monsters that might trouble you. 7. IF: Black Rod = Sceptre AND: Small Bird = Bird Statue THEN: What is equal to Wicker Cage? 8. What often covers you at the top of an extinct volcano? 9. What keeps falling on my head in the Asylum? 10. Who have delicate ears? 11. In what Adventure would you find yourself in the role of a journalist? 12. What words would you use to get through a hole in the wall in an old Manor House? THE NOT SO INSTANT KARMA ... Having treated my micro to a memory upgrade recently, I was quite impatient to try out a big Adventure on it, so I decided to see if I could lose my way in \"Lords of Karma\". The game opens in the city of Golconda which is surrounded by mountains and forests. Sunlight filters softly through the leaves of Aspen, Oak, Redwood and Pine, to help guide you through the paths and clearings that abound. You will have a long journey, for I estimate that there are upwards of 100 locations in the game. Your aim it to collect as many \"Karma Points\" as possible. These are obtained by carrying out brave and kind deeds. Some deeds, of course, are braver and kinder than others, so you might be easily misled into thinking that because you had gained points, you had performed the right deed in the right place with the right equipment. This is not necessarily so, and a similar act in a different scenario might have proved more fruitful. Therefore, to achieve a high score, once you have made an initial exploration, the game is best played in sections before tying the whole thing together. For instance, today you might try to collect a few goodies together and spend your time in retreat at the Chapel of Prayer, whilst tomorrow you might feel fit enough to take on the Green > Giant -is he the jolly one or not? play was the lack of a cursor. It is impossible to tell whether or not you have hit the space bar during input, whether deliberately or accidentally. Since the game is so large I know not what the highest score is, if indeed there is an absolute maximum. The highest I know of so far is 887, a total reached by Duncan Wood of Chatham, a friend who helped me cover the ground in time for this review. If you've achieved a score higher than that let me know, and I'll keep a high-score tally running on this page! Lords of Karma is supplied on a cassette containing a separate recording for each of the four machines. These are listed together with the memory requirements of each, in fig. 1. The game is published by Avalon Hill and is impressively packaged in a deceptively large box. It is available from Calisto Computers, to whom I offer my thanks for the review copy.

"| PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING THE STONE, PAPER, SCISSORS GAME We can now imagine the games being played by A choosing a row from the table and B choosing a column, the result being determined by the entry where the chosen row and column intersect. Taking this view of a game we can start by drawing up a table at random and defining a game by the table. Consider the following table: Table 3 w A 3 If A chooses row 2 and B chooses column 1, A wins 1; if A chooses row 2 and B chooses column 4, B wins 2, etc. In all these games, A and B make their moves without knowing what the other is going to do; if either player knew the other player's move before making his own he could always win. For example, in Matching Pennies, if A knew that B had played heads, A would also play heads and win. In the last 40 years or so there has been a great deal of work done on the mathematical theory of games. The interest in the subject is due mainly to applications in economics and warfare, but the theory does have applications in game playing, and the ideas and terminology came mainly from such games as chess, bridge and poker. Although the theory of games involves some very difficult mathematics it is possible to understand and use some of the simpler ideas without any knowledge of advanced mathematics. Let us begin by looking at two very simple games, Matching Pennies and Stone, Paper, Scissors. In Matching Pennies the two players, A and B, simultaneously lay down their coins; if the two coins both show heads or both show tails, A wins; if the two coins show different sides, B wins. In Stone, Paper, Scissors, the two players hold out their hands simultaneously, with a closed fist for stone, a fully extended hand for paper, and two fingers extended for scissors. The winner is determined by the scheme Stone blunts Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, Paper wraps Stone, while if both players show the same the game is a draw. We can represent these games by the following tables: Table 1: Matching Pennies Heads Tails Heads Tails Table 2: Stone, Paper, Scissors Stone Paper Scissors Stone 0 -1 A Paper 1 0 1 Scissors 1 The entries in the tables represent A's winnings, so that a positive number means that A receives a payment from B and a negative number means that A makes a payment to B. BY TED BALL give himself a better chance of winning. Suppose that player A chooses heads twice as often as tails; if B discovers this he can win by choosing tails twice as often as head, since in this situation, out of every nine plays we will get, on average, two heads twice, two tails twice, one head and one tail five times. Thus B will win five times for each four times he loses, and in the long run will come out ahead. In general, if A plays heads and tails at random, but with different probabilities, B can win in the long run by using the same probabilities but switching them from heads to tails and vice versa. Program 1 plays Matching Pennies in this fashion. The variable Q is used for the probability that the program will play \"tails\", and is initially set to 1/2. The program keeps count of the number of times the player has chosen heads and tails in the variables NH and NT, and after 10 games Q is recalculated and set equal to the probability that the player has been using for \"heads\". Of course, playing at random with probabilities different from 1/2 is not the only way of deviating from the best strategy. If you play heads and tails equally often but in a regular sequence, such as H,T,H,T... or HHT,T,H,H,T,T ... your opponent can win by learning the sequence and playing accordingly. The program could be modified 5 REM MATCHING PENNIES 20 mg 40 LET PSE MAKING RANDOM CHOICES WORK In any game, we expect that there is some \"good\" way of playing that will give a better result than uninformed play. In Matching Pennies and Stone, Paper, Scissors, it is clear that if our opponent knows what we are going to do we will lose, so we must make some random choice; it is also fairly easy to see that in both these games the best way to play is to make all the choices equally likely. For example, in Matching Pennies the best strategy is to play heads 50% of the time and tails 50% of the time, at random. If one player does this he will, on average, win half the time and lose half the time, regardless of what the other player does. However, if one player deviates from the 50-50 random play and the other player catches on to what he is doing, he can adjust his play to B HHIHHHHHHHH 0002runan Nama QOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO9G9060000008SGGGG 0 00 de PRINT YOUR HOUE: HORT\" INPUT P$ IF ( P H \") AND (PS) \"T\") GO TO 100 IF PSE\"H\" THEN LET NM NH+1 1 THE L NH ET NONNT RINT YOU PLAY ** THEMES RINT \"yox SCORES GO TO 90 BEM COMPUTER VINS PRINT I WIN LET CSECS1 REM PLAYER WINS PRINT \"YOU UIN Le PSP3.1 999 REM COMPUTERS MOVE 800 IF N10 THEN GO TO 1100 1040 LET O ENHAN TO THEN LET CO\"T\" 80 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING ROBOT RULE OK to handle this situation, but it would be very difficult to write a program capable of detecting more than the simplest sequences. If we return to the game defined by Table 3 we find a completely different situation. In the case of Matching Pennies and Stone, Paper, Scissors, we could work from the original forms of the games, or from the symmetry of the tables, but here we have an apparently random collection of numbers and no \"original\" form for the game. There is a way of finding the best play in this particular case, and to understand how it works it is easiest to start by imagining that B plays first and A plays knowing B's move. If B chooses column 1, A will choose row 1, because the 3 in row 1, column 1 is the largest entry in column 1. If B chooses column 2, A will choose row 3, because the 4 in row 3, column 2 is the largest entry in column 2. If B chooses column 3, A will chose row 4, because the 3 in row 4, column 3, is the largest entry in column 3. If B chooses column 4, A will choose row 3 because the 1 in row 3, column 4, is the largest entry in column 4. B can work this out in advance, so he will know that if he choose column 1 he will lose 3, if he chooses column 2 he will lose 4, if he chooses column 3 he will lose 3, and if he chooses column 4 he will lose 1. From this it appears that his best play is to choose column 4, as this gives him the smallest loss. If we now change round and image that A plays first and B plays knowing A's move, we can go through a similar procedure, but this time B will be choosing the column containing the smallest entry. Summarising A's strategy, if he chooses row 1 he will lose 3, if he chooses row 2 he will lose 2, if he chooses row 3 he will win 1, and if he chooses row 4 he will lose 2, so it appears that his best play is to choose row 3. In both cases we end up with the same choices, row 3 from A and column 4 from B. This does not Next month will be the last time you will see Practical Programming. Our expert programmer Ted Ball is not leaving us however — he is simply turning his typewriter to other things. He is going to write features on machine code, the first of which will appear in our January issue. WHEN THERE IS NO SIMPLE WAY The two games we have looked at that lead to a mixed strategy are easy to solve because of thetr-symmetry. However, in more complicated cases it is not possible to find a solution by simple inspection as we were able to do with Matching Pennies and Stone, Paper, Scissors. Table 4 DOW happen with every table (see what happens when you use this procedure on Tables 1 and 2). The reason that both ways of working towards the solution give the same result is that Table 3 contains an entry that is at the same time the largest number in its column and the smallest number in its row. In the terminology of game theory, an entry in a table that is the maximum of its row and the minimum of its column is called a saddle point. Thus, Table 3 has a saddle point at row 3, column 4, while Tables 1 and 2 have no saddle points. In the situation of Table 3, where the best play is always to make the same choice, this choice is called a pure strategy, in the situation of Tables 1 and 2, where the best play is to make a random selection among the possible choices, the play is called a mixed strategy. Table 4 has no saddle point and there is no simple way of finding the probabilities that give the best results for A and B. There is a mathematical method that can be used on tables of any size and shape, but it is not easy to understand. However, the mathematical method is not the only way to find the solution, and I will be continuing next month, describing a game which leads to Table 4 and explaining how to write a program that will \"learn the best solution.

" A specially commissioned ,000 prize provides the best evidence that computer gaming has come of age. The Golden Sundial of Pi is the prize destined to grace the mantlepiece of the first person to solve an elaborate computer adventure, Pimania. TERRY PRATT tried his hand at Pimania and from his report his mantiepiece is likely to remain bare. Pimania is an aptly named computer adventure game. It sends players around in circles and quite probably turns them manic. But with a specially commissioned gold and diamond sculpture-valued at ,000 on offer as a prize, it is well worth the risk of trying to discover its secrets. The adventure comes in cassette form for the 48K Sinclair Spectrum although there are plans to put it into other computers in the new year — and is the brainchild of Porstmouth-based software house, Automata Cartography The idea follows the formula of the successful Kit Williams' book, Masquerade, which challenged readers to use clues in the book's illustrations, to discover the whereabouts of a jewelled hare which the author had buried at a secret location. Automata's prize is the Golden Sundial of Pi and although it is still in the designer's studio, we will bring you a photograph of it in our next issue. The sundial will not be hidden away but would-be solvers will have to sift through the numerous clues in Pimania to discover the \"time and place\" where it is metaphorically hidden. The first person to get in touch with Automata and give the correct solution, wins the Golden Sundial. But the company's managing director, Mel Croucher is confident that it will be several months before anybody cracks it. He told us: \"You go through a series of Gates of Pi and the last one reveals exactly what we want by way of a solution. We are not encouraging people to start digging things up but hope they will meet us at the correct time and place.\" Purchasers of the .00 cassette face their first puzzle almost as soon as the game has loaded-how to get started? The computer screen explains that one key will activate the game but then it's up to the player to press the right combination on the keyboard. I ended up going through the keys systematically before the obvious struck me. He is also responsible for some ingenious graphics routines and sound effects which chart the player's progress through the Pimania realm. Acting as the guide is a cartoon character called the Piman. I couldn't work out whether he was a friend or foe. He has a good line in merry quips, a penchant for collecting some bizzare items and the ability to double up as a very able chorus girl. The program is written mostly in Basic and there are no elaborate precautions to prevent people listing it. But Mel Croucher is convinced that there are no short-cuts to the solution in doing this. He says: \"If people want to work out the puzzle by wading through masses of code, they are welcome to try. Part of the charm of Masquerade was Williams' insistence that the clues were just as accessible to a child's mind as an adult's. Croucher claims that this holds true for Pimania and another important criteria is that even after the competition has been solved, the owner still has a playable and well-presented game for his money. Automata launches the game in mid-October and will be displaying the Golden Sundial at computer exhibitions. Despite my own failure to discover the solution, I am keen that Computer and Video Games should share in the glory of winning the Sundial. To this end we will be referring readers' Pimania letters to Automata and hopefully printing any tips or helpful hints in our Mailbag section. So please write in if you think you can pass on something useful and perhaps the combined might of the C&VG readership can resolve the puzzle of Pimania. The only tips I can offer are: Look for clues even in the instructions.  Take a pencil and paper around the maze with you and map it out. Dismiss nothing in the program even the music should be noted down it could be significant Good luck and watch out for red herrings! But after that hints and clues are liberally scattered in an Adventure enthusiast's dream of frustrating mazes, unlikely treasures and abrupt dead-ends. Every time you stop and start again the treasures will be redistributed around the maze but you can save the game during a successful run. There is also an entertaining array of responses to the sort of desperate drivel which adventure games usually reduce me to, the: \"Help! I can't take any more! Let me out!\", variety. The sense of humour is strong throughout and belongs to programmer Christian Penfold. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 85 "

With the disappearance of Bug Byte's excellent version of Pacman for the Vic20 under the threat of legal action from Atari the owners of the Pacman copyright we review another version of the game with the little yellow gobbler. Puckman has all the principle features of the arcade game. The ghosts chase you through a maze full of dots which you must eat up as you go along. If you eat the power pills in the corners of the maze you can then eat the ghosts for a brief few seconds to score bonus points. Every so often a bunch of cherries appear in the centre of the maze which, if you can manage to eat them are worth a lot of extra points. The graphics are surprisingly clear considering that the game is written for the unexpanded VIC My main criticism is that the Pacman is difficult to negotiate through the maze as IMPORTANT NOTICE the keys that move him tend to stick Once you press a key to move him he will continue in that direction even when you take your finger off the key Puckman is available from Mac games of Port Talbot at .50 Getting started 8  Value  Playability To all owners of the following games:RADOFIN 1292 & 1392, AUDIOSONIC PP1292, PRINZTRONIC VC6000 and ACETRONIC MPU 1000 microprocessor DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE OBTAINING CARTRIDGES FOR THE ABOVE GAMES?

The idea of the game is to shoot as many of the advancing Black Riders as possible. To kill the riders you must release a thunderbolt by pressing the shift key. You must quickly release the key again when the bolt is centred on a Black Rider. This will cause the bolt to explode killing the rider — which will then glow red and gradually fade away. If you fail to release the key quickly enough the bolt will pass through your target and leave him unharmed. But it's the graphics on Shadowfax that are truly impressive. The horses look and sound most lifelike. My one criticism of the game is the lack of variety in terms of opponents. It would have been really nice to have a few Orcs and Elves to deal with as well as the dark riders Despite this — my overall impression was of a most enjoyable and compulsive game.

Pirates are mentioned on the packet: \"You are thrown overboard from a Pirate ship\". I was expecting pirates to appear on my TV screen with a look in their eye as if to say: \"Watch out you pesky VIC owner we're going to throw you to the sharks\", But alas, no pirates. The sharks were pretty disappointing too. If they resembled any sort of swimming creature at all I would say a tadpole was the nearest.

Spectral Invaders was the first game on the market for the Spectrum and marked another first for the Liverpool firm Bug Byte The game is a fairly authentic version of the arcade classic. It loaded without difficulty and started according to the instructions. The main drawbacks were that the gun can hardly fail to hit something once you get a missile in the air The mystery flying saucers didn't look too much like flying saucers and moved so slowly they could be picked off with ease. About the only department in which the Psion game beat the other two versions was sound. The Spectrum produced clear well synchronised bleeps as the ships exploded.

The missiles were also slow moversjerking awkwardly skywards. The Invaders themselves did not explode immediately they had been hit either causing you to hesitate, unsure if you had hit them or not On the plus side Spectral Invaders was the only game of the three we looked at that offered a two player game. It had the fastest and most authentic mystery flying saucers. It also had the best score board, flashing to indicate player one or two. Despite its faults, Spectral Invaders was the only version that looked and felt at all similar to arcade Space Invaders. Psion Software the official Sinclair software writers entered the field with Space Raiders, the slowest version we tested The Invaders don't move down the screen in vertical columns in this version making them particularly easy to hit. Their side-stepping motion means that the gaps between the columns are blocked so you with other Spectrum games. Southampton firm Quicksilva were hot on the heels of Bug Byte with their version of Invaders for the Spectrum Space Intruders. This was the fastest of the three games So fast in fact that it detracted from the playability of the game. Not because it made it impossibly difficult, but because you had such a speed advantage over the advancing fleet that you could shoot them down with ease. The missiles could be fired far too fast and furiously. You could kill a whole column of Invaders in a split second, sometimes without dodging right or left, which in turn made the fleet relatively easy to defeat. In fairness to Quicksilva their version does have a number of features which the others do not Most useful of these is a hold button which enables you to answer the phone or make a cup of tea and then continue where you left off when you are ready. It also has a high score facility which enables you to 2 100 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

PE21 OJX Defender is not a game you can pick up in five minutes before leaving for a dinner party.. Three hours later you will be cursing the anxious would-be host for phoning to interrupt you while you still had a smart bomb and three humanoids left on wave three. In the arcades, Defender players earned their expertise through a mint of 10p's. On the BBC Model B Microcomputer, you have to be prepared to sacrifice time lots of it to enjoy the satisfaction of smart-bombing the Pods at the start of wave three. A lot of people are put off Defender by the vast range of control buttons. There are seven of them: Up, Down, Thrust, Fire, Smart Bomb, Reverse and Hyperspace. At the start you doubt that you will ever master them but slowly the game starts to make sense. Up and Down come first, then remember not to Thrust too quickly and don't spare the Fire button unless the humanoids, you must defend, are climbing into dangerous positions on the mountainous scenery. Soon you will have cleared the first wave of 15 Lander aliens and found your self just starting to gain confidence in Reverse and thumping down on the Smart Bomb in tight situations. For the uninitiated, Defender puts you in a craft above a bumpy landscape, charged with the task of stopping aliens kidnapping humanoid figures from the surface. The most dangerous opponents are the Mutant, Baiter and Swarmer craft but you are responsible for the appearance of all of these. Mutants only appear if you let a Lander craft steal a humanoid to the top of the screen Baiters, only if you dally too long on one wave and Swarmers only come into the game when you blow-up a harmless Podso only do it when you are ready to deal with them. In Defender you are responsible for everything that happens to you. And even the \"easy\" first wave is crucial to your future survival in the game so treat it with due respect Extra lives are awarded every 10,000 points, an extra Smart Bomb too, but a new batch of humanoids is only given to you each fourth wave. And if you lose all your humanoids, all hell is When you have just flown your last man into a pack of Swarmers, quite forgetting that you still had another Smart Bomb left and the split second the machine takes to set up a new game seems like a frustrating eternity, you'll realise why Defender has enjoyed such a long reign as king of the arcade games.
