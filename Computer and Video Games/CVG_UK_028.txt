"martechames...a spectacular range of software BLASTERMIND! The Quest of MerravtaN Dear I hav critic Cole price At first glance this might SPECTRUM 48k .50 seem to be just another version of a very popular game. How wrong can you be!!! True, the start is simple enough. The Spectrum picks a code of numbers or colours with a selection of levels of difficulty — and invites you to do the same. You then take it in turns to guess each others code from the clue supplied after each guess. An extremely well written, fast and very clearly displayed game, with almost inevitable defeat. This was exactly as intended but unfortunately something went wrong. During the programming strange uncomplimentary messages began to appear on the screen. At first they were so few they were not taken too seriously, but soon they could no longer be ignored. Somehow the Spectrum had been given a personality a rather devious, supercilious dislikeSide B contains a version of the game able, hateful, horrible mind compatible with the excellent Currah Speech unit even worse!! VIC 20 (16k) .95 or Commodore 64 .95 A really challenging and enjoyable adventure, written by a confirmed adventure addict who grew tired of the ease with which he solved other adventures himself. Will accept and act on sentences containing up to nine words. The adventurer becomes Merravid, charged with the task of finding, taking and then returning the magic Firestone of the Dwarves. However, overcoming the many novel and original hazards is no easy matter.

"You can all stop holding your breath now! The moment you've all been waiting for has ar rived. Yes, we're ready to announce the winners of our Computer and Video Games 1983 Golden Joystick Awards. These are the awards that we hope will become a symbol of excellence in the software industry a measure of a good software company and good products. We know that many software houses work hard producing top quality software and provide good after sales service to their customers. This is what Computer and Video Games hopes to reward by asking you, our readers, to vote for your top game and favourite software house among other categories! Since we first announced our Golden Joystick Awards several other award schemes have sprung up but accept no substitutes, C&VG's joysticks truly reflect popular support for a game or software house because YOU have chosen the winners. Throughout the year the C&VG office has been flooded with nominations for our various Golden Joystick Awards. A large variety of personal tastes and personal preferences came to light as we analysed the results proving that one person's favourite game was another person's bowl of cold porridge! Literally hundreds of games for all the popular micros were nominated. But despite the number of home computers on the market and the amount of software around all our award winners were clearly head and shoulders above their competitors. All the Golden Joystick Awards were presented at a special dinner held in London. Representatives from all the top software houses were there to see Radio One DJ and computerbuff Dave Lee Travis present the Golden Sticks. We'll have a full report on the celebrations and the names of the winners in the next issue of Computer and Video Games. Don't forget if you missed your chance to vote in 1983 why not get in first for our 1984 Golden Joystick Awards? Make sure you have a say in the awards next year by filling in the coupon we'll print in our next issue. We're also keeping the names of our winners secret until next month too — but all will be revealed in our March issue. Unless you are one of the lucky people with an invitation to our grand awards dinner that is. Remember we are also taking this opportunity to launch our search for the software stars of 1984. Competition is bound to be even tougher this year with more and more great games on the market for the new generation of home computers so we hope you'll help us make sure that the right people get our awards. We pride ourselves on being the top reader friendly magazine so that's why we let YOU, our readers, select the winners. And this is why we feel that the C&VG Golden Joystick Awards are the only true reflection of what's best in the British software industry. Simply because YOU, the games player, choose the winners! And who can know better what makes a good game? Meanwhile, thanks for joining in the voting for our 1983 awards and if you think we've missed out a category for 1984 why don't you drop us a line — we're always open to suggestions! There are a few surprises in the award line-up but we're keeping up the mystery until next issue! So don't forget to rush out and get your copy of C&VG on February 16th. 1983 GOLDEN JOYSTICK AWARDS COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 19 "

"ICOMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETI TERRAHAWKS LEGGIT FOR MORE LEGGITS! WINNERS! What's happened to all you eager Atari owners in the Portsmouth and Southampton areas? We've still got some free Leggit tapes to give away, courtesy of Imagine Software and, to give everyone a fair chance we've decided to go nationwide and offer the tapes to all of you! So, calling all owners of the Atari 400/800 and 600XL, fill in the coupon below and rush it back to us --it's first come, first served -and the first ones into the C&VG office will be the lucky winners. Send in your coupon, marked Leggit, to Computer & Video Games, 8 Herbal Hill, London, ECIR 5EJ. Name .......... Would the winners of the Atari/Dixons competition, featured in the June issue of C&VG, please get in touch with Clare Edgeley on 01-278 6556? There are five winners in Trevor Truran's Ostentatious Pyrotechnics competition featured in the November issue of C&VG. All five winners have been announced in the January 84 issue -would they please get in touch with Clare on the same telephone number? Address ............. --HANDS ACROSS THE WATER ... Flaming Thunderbolts! When we announced our Terrahawks contest we never realised we'd start an invasion of letters and postcards which almost swamped the C&VG offices! We had to call in Tiger Ninestien, Kate Kestrel, Zero and the rest of the Terrahawks team to help us get through the mounds of mail. They managed to come up with two winners out of the pile and very soon Miss C. V. Gibson of Lancashire and Donald Glose from London will be the lucky owners of a Philips G7000 video games centre complete with Terrahawks cartridge! Your prizes are on their way. POT THE BLACK No sooner had we cleared the giant pile of Terrahawks mail another huge flood of competition entries swamped the office this time it was Pot the Black which caused all the excitement! We asked you to help Freddy Frinkle, the man with the Golden Cue, clinch the world snooker championship by solving an a-maze-ing snooker puzzle. And hundreds of you took us at our word. After we called in a JCB earthmover to help us get through the mail, we finally managed to pick our 25 winners of Snooker games tapes, autographed by Snooker star Steve Davis and produced by new software house Visions. We asked you to solve a maze and also if there could ever be a \"break\" of 162 in a game of snooker. And the answer is yes. Here's how it works. Your opponent gives you a 159 start. You break off with a foul shot which gives your opponent four points, but leaves him snookered. He nominates a colour for red, pots that for 1 and black for 7 then scores 147 the normal maximum break in snooker. He then wins the toss, pots the respotted black making a total \"break\" of 162.

You've probably noticed from our Mailbag pages that Computer and Video Games refreshes the parts of the world that other computer magazines just can't reach. And recently a few of our overseas readers have been asking for a competition which runs for a bit longer than just a month to give them a chance to enter. Many of our overseas readers don't get their issue of C&VG until well after the rest of you simply because of the vast distances involved. So we've decided to run a competition just for them. OK overseas C&VG fans here's what we want you to do. Send us a good games program -that's all. We know there must be some great games writers lurking in the far flung corners of the worldand we want to find you! Make the game as original as possible that's our usual plea to programmers but we're always interested in a top quality conversion of an arcade favourite or computer game. We've got three Sinclair Spectrum computers up for grabs, plus some software from C&VGs vaults thrown in, for the top three programs selected by our team of reviewers. Runners-up will receive Computer and Video Games Year Books and The Champ t-shirts. The winning programs will be published in C&VG and you could find youself receiving an extra  if we vote your program a Game of the Month.

"COMPUTER CHE Thinking of buying a chess program for your micro? Don't know what to expect or which one to buy? Then read on... Whether you're a chess fanatic or you just know the rules, you will probably at some time want to set a chess program for your home computer. With the great number of programs now available, it may be a difficult decision to choose the best one for your micro. In this article Chess programmer Martin Bryant looks at the standard of play and the features you can expect from the best modern home computer chess programs. players can't beat the programs on their lowest settings. These modes allow the program to quite deliberately try not to win! Instead it either tries to gradually lose or stay roughly level. These modes can be of enormous help to the beginner or very weak player. As the player improves, the program magically improves with him, always challenging him, but not totally smashing him so he just gives up. The ability to quickly and easily set up different positions is essential. The program should also check that you don't try to play on with an illegal board position. For example, having P's on the first rank, more than one king for each side etc. Standard of play Which Program? The very best programs can now play at a fairly good club level, from around 1600 to 1800 ELO (125 to 150 BCF). The standard of play can vary greatly from game to game depending on the type of position encountered and the stage of the game. Modern programs also usually have a much fuller understanding of the more obscure rules of chess such as underpromotions, draws by repetition, draws by the fifty move rule and chess clocks. The ability to step backwards or forwards through the entire game. Older programs would allow you to take back only a couple of moves, but with new techniques the whole game record can be stored and scanned with small memory overhead. The oreintation of the board should be reversible. That is the board should be displayable with white or black at the bottom of the screen. This allows you to play black \"up\" the board, like a real chess game, instead of having to reverse your way of looking at it. Several \"modes\" of play can add a great deal of flexibility to a program. The old fashioned eight \"levels\" can be vastly improved upon these days. Some of the sensible \"modes\" are: (1) \"Tournament\" mode: Full tournament parameters can be set up, to make the program play within any specified time limit. An easy to use version of the full mode is helpful as well, where you can just specify the average move time you wish the program to take. This can range from one second to 99 hours, effectively providing thousands of \"levels\". The program automatically ad justs its \"lookahead\", to play within the required time. (ii) \"All the moves\" mode: Chess clocks are used, where you must play all the moves of the game within a specified game time. If you play too slowly, you lose on time! Club players often use this method in \"five-minute\" games where both players have five minutes each to play all their moves. (iii) 'Problem\" mode: The ability to solve chess problems of the type in many newspapers is good. Beware however of the programs which claim they can solve mates in five or more, but then take a week or so to do it! If the program averages more than a few seconds on any mate in two it is likely to be horribly slow on deeper mates. (iv) \"Losing\" and \"Equal\" modes: Many TUTI Features Here's what you should look for in a good chess program. The most recent programs are provided with many more features of a much higher quality than their older counterparts, such as: Move entry by a cursor positioning method. Why should people have to turn their thoughts into an algebraic form, just because its easier for the program to understand? The cursor method allows you to move the piece on the board, more like a real chess game. The best programs can accept both methods. The best programs for playing strength are usually the most recently released. Any program which has been around for over a year without an update, is probably totally outdated as far as its playing strength goes. A year is a long time in computer chess, as can be seen from the results of programs which compete in recognised tournaments, such as the European Championships at the PCW show each year. A chess programmer may achieve glory one year, but has to work very hard on new ideas/techniques to improve the program, so as not to be leapfrogged by other programs by the following year. You should try to go for recognised quality programs, which have competed in many tournaments. There are several reasons for this. Some of the programs have obviously proved themselves by actually winning some of these tournaments. Others will have at least performed reasonably well. The ones that don't enter at all, would probably be smashed out of sight! Also the programmers behind these programs are dedicated and Sur WWW WIN WA LLLLLLL L S CRITE METALL TUNDUH HA 38 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"EQUE-MATES knowledgeable enough to really write a quality program, rather than just another software \"rip-off\" as are many chess programs. The same arguments really apply to the features as well. A \"real\" chess program will have most of the best features as a matter of course. COMPUTER CHESS COMPETITION TO Reviews I'll now take a brief look at two programs which are probably the best available. They are White-Knight Mark II for the BBC Micro and Cyrus I.S. Chess for the Spectrum. Cyrus was originally written in 1981 by Richard Lang and won the European Championships in the same year. It has competed in several tournaments since, with varying success and has been adapted for several micros. The Spectrum model is not the latest version of the program, but can still beat almost all other programs. It comes in 16k and 48k versions. The 48k version has more features and also uses an openings book. It contains a wide range of features, including set-up position, saving to tape, printer output and full game take-back. The bottom of the screen shows the various features available as single letter commands. The display is clear and the programs cursor move entry easy to use. It allows user underpromotions, understands draws by the fifty move rule and some draws by repetition. It has eight levels and can solve problems up to three moves ahead. White-Knight was originally written in 1977. Mark II won the home computer section of the European Championships in 1983. It is certainly the strongest home computer program available at the moment. It runs on the BBC model B and like Cyrus, comes with several excellent features, including set up position, whole game takeback/replay, orientation, play-self, blindfold and even volume control. When it computes its move, it displays the best line it has found so far in its search. This can be used to provide a \"hint\" move as well as an indication as to what \"White-Knight has \"seen\". Again the display is very clear and the program easy to use. You can use cursor positioning move entry or algebraic notation. The program can easily be set to play within any average move time you require of it, thus providing thousands of potential \"levels\". It can also solve mates up to five moves ahead. Its problem solving speed is phenomenal. It examines around 1,200 positions each second and when compared to the Program Power chess program was found to be around 200 (yes, two hundred) times as fast! It was recently used in a study of several hundred chess problems and found that a dozen of the original problems were in fact in error! In a series of sixteen test games between the two programs on various levels, White-Knight beat Cyrus I.S. Chess by twelve games to four. For other micros there is a wide range from fairly good to appalling programs. Cyrus is also available on the Dragon. Not as good as the Spectrum version but still a good buy. WhiteKnight is soon to be released on the Electron. The Atari cartridge I tried was horrible and at  has got to be one to miss. For the Commodore 64 comes the Grand-Master. It didn't offer many real features and I beat it twice with no real trouble and wasn't very impressed. At  I would also give it a a miss. A new program called Collosus, which won second amateur prize at the European Championships is soon to be released on the CBM 64 and Atari micros. This program promises to be one of the best around. For the Apple, Sargon 2 has had its day, but Sargon 3 is now available. BBC Publishers are offering a super prize to the lucky winners of our Computer Class Competition three presentation copies of White-Knight, autographed by the author. All you have to do is answer the following questions about computer chess. So have a go at winning yourself one of the best chess programs around! (1) What was the name of the computer chess program which won the first Computer World Chess Championships in 1974? Was it: (a) CHAOS (b) KAISSA (C) CHESS 4.0 or (d) OSTRICH? (2) What processor did the original Cyrus program run on? (3) Which program won the 1982 European Micro-Computer Chess Championships? (4) The fastest chess program in the world, called BELLE, uses special hardware to achieve its phenomenal speed. Approximately how many positions per second can BELLE examine? Is it (a) 500 (b) 8,000 (c) 75,000 (d) 160,000 (e) 470,000 or (t) 2,000,000? (5) Describe a new feature which you would like to see included in the next generation of chess programs. You'll probably have to be a professional chess programmer to answer all these questions, but the competition isn't open to them. Just answer as many as you can. In the event of a tie, the answers to question five will be used to decide the winner. Closing date for entries is February 16th and the usual C&VG competition rules apply.

"TIPS FOR THE ATARI defined graphics characters that's what all those DATA lines are for. The solution is simple. If, when typing a Spectrum program, you see a PRINT line with some lower case (small as opposed to CAPITAL) letters in speech marks, these are probably user-defined graphics and need to be entered in graphics mode. To do this, type the line in as normal but when you get to the letters, enter graphics mode by typing CAPS-SHIFT with 9 to get a G cursor. Enter the characters and then get out of graphics mode by typing CAPS SHIFT with 9 again, and finish typing the line. TIPSTERS PAY RISE On seeing that Seamus is paying  for hints and tips which reach his Program Extra page, I've been saving up especially, and can now afford to do the same. So from now on, any letters, hints or other tips which make the Bug Hunter page will earn  for their authors. And talking of Seamus, I'm currently training him in the art of Bug Hunting and I assure you that he's very nice to talk to. So next time you have a problem and I'm off fighting the Bugs, ask for him. Here at C&VG we've come up with a clever idea to keep calls evenly distributed between myself and Seamus. Next time you have a problem, toss a coin before you telephone the office. If it's heads, ask for me and if it's tails then ask for Seamus! And if it lands on its side, phone the Guinness Book of Records! Now, back to the serious stuff. GO FASTER DRAGONS Dragon users will probably be aware that some Dragons can be speeded up simply with a POKE. Not all machines will allow this. But now, courtesy of Bug Hunter Enterprises (with a little help from Ahlan Davison-Grey, our Dragon software reviewer), here's why, or why not. The central chip in the Dragon is a 6809E, where the E means that the chip gets all its timing signals from an external clock. The clock takes the form of a crystal, and the frequencies it produces are handled by another chip. However, you can alter some of the registers in this last chip to alter the speed of the clock which drives the 6809. This has the effect of speeding up the computer so that some games will run twice their normal speed. However, the 6809 was not designed to run at this speed, so don't be disappointed if yours doesn't. But, says Here are a few useful tips for the Atari 400/600/800 from Christopher Roche of Sutton Coldfield. To disable the break key, type POKE 16,64: POKE 53774,64. To disable the system reset button, try POKE 580,1. Now, if anyone presses it, the machine will erase all its memory including the program. To destroy all variables try FOR X=PEEK(130)+256* PEEK(131) TO PEEK(132) +256* PEEK(133): POKE XO:NEXT X. After entering this, when LIST is typed the program will be listed in an unreadable form. Also for Atari owners who keep having occasional errors with the 410 cassette recorder, try typing LPRINT before CSAVEing. This will produce a harmless error message, but just continue as normal. Thanks go to Donald Dods from West Lothian for this. WILD WEST — VIC 20 Vic 20 owners may have been surprised by the Wild West program from December's issue. Even though the program needed a super expander cartridge, there were still three commands in there that the machine did not understand. The problem stemmed from the fact that we haven't saved up enough for a Vic printer yet, so I loaded it into our Pet to be listed. However, because you can't get a super expander for a Pet, some of the tokens from the cassette were misinterpreted. I can now put you out of your anguish by revealing that BACKUP should be COLOUR, APPEND should really be SOUND while SYNTAX should actually read RJOY. You will now be able to get the game running perfectly. I am still getting letters about bugs in professional software for micros. With Christmas just gone, there must be quite a few micro owners who have bought software with bugs in it. The latest batch comes from Peter Lee of Ilford, Essex. Peter talks about problems with Psion's Flight Simulation, Ocean's Kong and has also told me of a problem in Valhalla which causes the program to return you to BASIC, able to LIST the game! unter tribute to Motorola, the manufacturer. ed Winite to me at Bug Hunter, computer and Video Games, hlan, the fact that so many do, is a urant House, 8 Herbal Hul, nothing wrong with London, ECIR 5EJ.

CHEQUERED FLAG PSION RABBIT RAID — SPECTRUM James Alston from Bromley, Kent, writes to tell me of what he thinks is a bug in Chequered Flag. At the end of a race, he says, the computer is supposed to print the fastest lap time. In fact it prints up the time taken to complete the last lap. Has anyone else found this problem? If you managed to get the graphics correct in Rabbit Raid for the Spectrum from November's issue, then here's how to add some sound to it, courtesy of lan Lewis from Lewes, East Sussex, who's the first to earn the new improved sum of  for his efforts. On line 30 after RAIDd\": and before GOSUB add BEEP 3,7: BEEP 1..7:Beep 3,7 and at the end of line 330 add :BEEP .05, 14. lan also suggests that a more realistic score system is made by changing line 250 from S=S+100 to S=S+250. Well, that's it for another month. Don't forget that you can always talk to me about your computer problems on 01278 3881. I've just had one of those posh answering machines fitted to the bug, phone so if you are suddenly struck by a bug in the middle of the night or at the weekend you can leave me a message.

"mo MADVENUR BY KEITH CAMPBELL KEEPING MARY AMUSED! And now for something completely different! A graphics adventure where the action is played out before your very eyes! Valhalla loads in a Spectrum under a striking title page and offers you six quests. These are to find special hidden objects: Ofnir (key), Drapnir (ring), Skornir (shield), Skalir (sword), Felstrong (axe) and Grimnir (helmet). These obnirs can only be discovronged in the above ordir The gameworld has a cast of dozens, and at any location you may expect to meet and perhaps cross swords with a range of gods and goddesses (includ. ing Mary), giants, dwarfs, wolves and dragons, of varying temperaments and abilities. In search of the foreign objects, you move around by issuing the usual Adventure commands, but may also play a 'wild card' by jumping on to a ringway if one is present. This is a magical method of transportation rather than a continuous urban dual carriageway, and to travel one you must be carrying, of course, a ring! Where Valhalla is different from other graphical Adventures is in its display format — the screen is split into three bands. On arrival at a location, the top half displays an excellent hi-res picture, drawn very quickly. I got the impression that these graphics were composed of modules, re-arranged to give many combinations of picture from the same blocks. Next, the lower 25% shows the text replies, whilst the final band rather too slowly draws the characters and objects present. The centre band therefore appears to form a continuous picture with the top band, like a stage. In some ways, this game is like Hobbit, for all the characters have a mind of their own, and appear, disappear, drop things and attack you and each other according to their whims. But unlike Hobbit, they actually move. Their little legs walk, they jump'about whilst fighting, and lift their wine to their heads when they drink. As this happens, so a text commentary is written below. If you want to pick up an object, then your figure will walk across the screen and get it.

"ADVENTURE C G HELPLINE Every now and again one of those desperate people trapped in small room with a calculator write in. The fact they are not in an asylum yet is a tribute to their tenacity. Has ANYONE got out of there since I last wrote about Deathmaze 5000, a couple of years ago? Mr. Poles of Lutterworth will be disappointed to learn that the general consensus of opinion is that the Philosopher's Quest lamp cannot be lit. Congratulations to Robert Davidson from Macclesfield, and Colin Bignell down in Littlehampton, the only readers so far to lay claim to completing this game. In a long helpful letter, Robert suggests that Mr. Poles must have been sleeping with the lamp on, for the game can be completed without relighting it. Colin Bignell says it cannot be relit, and warns Mr. Poles to be careful in its use especially when talking to the old sailor. James Frost of Windlesham agrees, and suggests using matches for extra time. But what's this? Karl Howard writes from Rochdale and says the lamp CAN be relit type RUB LAMP. I suspect the confusion is because Mr. Poles did not state whether or not he had run out of fuel. Shaggy dogs, cheese and albatrosses are among the favourite subjects of all good Philosophers, and clues have arrived from numerous sources, including Roger Durrant, Mark Chaffey, and C. M. F.

So if you are looking for a value-formoney game that will keep its challenge, stay fresh and challenging as the day you first loaded it into your micro for months and months, check out those tapes with a C&VG sticker about their person first! Meanwhile, if you think you qualify as a top scorer on one of our Hall of Fame Games listed elsewhere on this page then fill in our Hall of Fame coupon, get it signed by a witness and stick it on a postcard. Then all you have to do is mail it to Hall of Fame, Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ. In the New Year we'll invite some of the best top scorers along to a grand finals to prove their skills in the spotlight. In the meantime we'll be printing the top five scorers in our Hall of Fame selection each issue. And each month we've got a C&VG \"The Champ\" t-shirt to give away to the top scorer on each game featured on this page. Your score doesn't have to be better than the one we printed the issue before-it simply has to be the highest we've received in time for our current issue's deadline. We'd also like to hear from you if your favourite game isn't included in the Hall of Fame line-up. Maybe you'll persuade us to squeeze it in! PARSEC 1) C.

"Vio RUNS ON AN ORIC-1 IN 48K BY MICHAEL RUSSEL Can you avoid the giant charging Rhino as it chases you through the forest? Well, if you can't, don't program in this game because you'll soon be in trouble! The object of the game is simple dodge the Rhino! You'll find yourself in the forest with a fierce horned animal bearing down on you -how long can you stay out in front?

Santa has chosen some really awkward spots to drop off the gifts so you'll have to brave the dangers of the planet in order to complete your task. There are few landing sites, gravity is extremely strong and you are running low on fuel. Something Santa never had to bother about! You'll score more points for a landing in a really difficult spot so experienced pilots will score well. Full instructions are involved in the program.

"Whooooosh! Hi there. This ski-ing lark is good fun isn't it! Now, thanks to Mark Vasey, you won't even have to get out of your armchair to enjoy the thrills and spills of this most popular winter sport. All you have to do is ski down the mountainside avoiding fallen skiers, trees and spectators who have gathered at the edge of the track to laugh at you when you fall over. After 200 metres down the slope night will fall and you'll have to use all your skills to stay upright! The same thing happens once you've managed to ski 670 metres down the slope. At the end of each game the distance you've manage to travel and your high score will be displayed. Full instructions are included in the program.

"ALIEN ATTACK Earth is under attack! Not again, I hear you groan. Well it is, and it's up to you to stop moaning and get out there and fight those irritating aliens who keep causing so much trouble around the galaxy. Your city is defended by three laser bases these are activated by pressing the \"1\" \"2\" and \"3\" keys. To kill the invaders, you must position your sight on target and fire away in a similar fashion to that arcade favourite, Missile Command. Your city is also protected by a. force-field — which is gradually worn down by alien fire. If they manage to get through the force field and reach the city then you'll.. be destroyed!  A new force field is generated after every third wave of alien attackers has been destroyed. Also after every third wave, the speed and numbers of aliens increase but you do get bonus points for every three waves you manage to wipe out. Full instructions are included in the program.

"BY DAVID WATERFIELD RUNS ON A BBC IN 32K REVERSI Reversi, like chess, is one of the most popular board game conversions among micro owners. The rules for the Beeb version are exactly the same as the standard game the difference is that in this version you are up against the computer and not a human opponent. The rules of the game are very simple. You cannot place one of your pieces next to a counter of your own colour. Each player takes alternate turns to place a counter on the board. If any player can't move or doesn't wish to move for tactical reasons, the play can be passed to the opponent. The object of the game is trap a row of your opponent's counters between your pieces. If you succeed, all the pieces that have been captured change to your playing colour. The best winning tactic is to occupy as many of the corner squares as you can. This puts you in a powerful position, allowing you to attack the computer's pieces without endangering your own counters. At the beginning of a game, you are given the option of moving first or allowing the computer to do so. To enter a move simply press the number of the square you wish to move followed by the corresponding letter. Illegal moves will be rejected and if you cannot move you should enter \"I\". At the end of a game, when the board is full or when neither player can move, the score is added up and the winner announced. 10 MODE 1: MV=4:PMX= 20 PROCarrays 39 PROCboard 49 PROCUmove 50 IF A$=\"\" THEN PRINTTABC 7. 29 )SPC30; TABC 7.29)\"\"; : PROCrandom GOTO 520 60 IF A$<>\"4\" THEN 40 70 GOTO 90 80 PRINTTAB(8.29 SPC10; TAB 7. 29) \"Move illegal!\"; : T%=TIME: REP EATSOUND811, -15,51-.25*C TIME-T%) 11:UNTILTIME-T%>2010: *FX15,1 11:46 PRINTTABCO, 29 )SPC5: TAB 18, 29 SPC29; TABC 7.29 )\"Your move?\"; : Y$=GETA:PRINT; Y$;\",\"; X GETS:P RINT; CHR$(CASCXX$ > DOR32); : Y=VALC Y!):X=CASCOX$ DOR32-96 100 IF X=0 AND Y=D THEN 90 110 IF X-9 AND Y=9 THEN PM%=1: GOT0350 120 IF X>8 OR X<1 OR Y> OR Y 1 OR INTCXX>X OR INTCYX>Y THEN 90 130 REM .. .

"Briky is a happy little bricklayer. He's never more content than when he's got a wall to build. But there are things that upset him bombs and moles. Both are capable of destroying his carefully constructed walls. You can help Briky build a brave new world by guiding him around the screen. You cannot stop-so you have to be careful not to bump into your own walls. Occasionally those moles and bombs appear at random on the screen. If you build your wall over a mole, you'll get a bonus of 10 points. If you hit a bomb, you'll lose two of your five lives. After every 100 points you get a bonus life and a new screen to play in. But each screen gets smaller making Briky's life harder.

Program Extra has two tips for microprogrammers and a new feature, Down to Basics, but let's kick off with a look at David Waterfield's game for the BBC Reversi. 120PLOT85,X+T,Y+T:X+T 130NEXTC 140Y=Y+T:X=150 150IFR MOD2=1 THEN A=0 ELSE A=1 160NEXTR 170ENDPROC Write to Program Extra at Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ. Please mark your letters \"Program Extra\". Remember we'll pay  for any tips or short programs we print. n our last issue, Down to Basics discussed the merits and demerits of Basic and its rivals. This month we'll be taking a closer look at Basic's structure and hopefully get a greater understanding of how it operates. First of all we should take a look at the heart of all computers, the microprocessor. avid Waterfield's game Reversi is a very good example of a well written program, tackling difficult problems with excellent ideas and short snappy programming. This is highlighted by David's approach to solving the problem of drawing up the playing board without having to write a game the length of a novel. Using FOR NEXT loops and lots of variables, David has managed to write a really compact little routine to do the job. IT 1 his has inspired Program Extra to encourage you to get programming. So we have come up with a short procedure to create a chess or draughts board on the BBC computer. The program can be easily modified to suit your needs. And if you feel like creating a brand new board game of your own it will help too! his short program for the BBC demonstrates how it's possible, with a good programming style, to write short listings to solve problems that appear to be complex and tiresome. Drawing a chess board is an excellent exercise to attempt, because it involves some tricky problems, but also requires the programmer to structure the routine or else succumb to writing reams of code and end up with a very messy game. The program uses two loops, one to draw each row of squares and the other to draw each column. The IF... THEN statements are used to decide if a row begins with a black or white square and variables are used throughout to carry the drawing co-ordinates and the colour to be used for filling. Furthermore, the entire routine is held in a defined procedure which can be easily incorporated into any program with ease. 10MODE4 20Y=150:X=150 30A=1:T=100 40PROCBOARD 50END 60DEFPROCBOARD 70FORR=1 T08 80FORC=1T08 901FC MOD2A THEN GCOLO,OELSE GCOLO,7 100MOVEX,Y:DRAWX,Y+T 110DRAWX+T,Y+T he microprocessor is the most important chip in a computer. If you've ever seen inside a micro, chances are that the largest chip in there would have been the microprocessor itself. It is also known as the Central Processing Unit, or CPU and this name helps you understand what it does. The CPU is the chip which controls all the others and which actually does the work when you run your program. If a calculation needs doing, which happens hundreds of times every second, the numbers are brought from the memory chips into the CPU which does the work, and then places the answer back into a memory chip. Whenever you see something moving across the screen in a game, it is the CPU which is controlling that movement. The way it's done is to put the character you wish to move at a point on the screen. Then, after a very short delay, erase it and put it slightly further along. If you keep doing this fast enough the object will appear to move. The important thing to realise about the CPU is that, although it can work very fast it could easily handle many thousands of long multiplications in less than a second), it can only do one thing at a time. So if your computer is playing a game of Pacman, the computer can't move that ghosts around the screen, make the sound effects and check to see what keys you're pressing all at the same time. Programmers get round this problem by making the CPU do each job for a short time in turn. If the program is well written, this should happen fast enough to give the impression that all is happening at once. PROGRAM EXTRA hat about winds it up for this issue except to remind you that if you have any problems with the listings in C&VG, or just want to learn more about how the games work, drop Program Extra a line to Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ.

"the lar JAPAN 16 Once upon a time, Namco was a rather obscure company which manufactured small fairground rides which were placed on the top of department stores to keep the kids happy while their mums went shopping. The turning point came when Namco bought up Atari Japan Inc. in 1974. Although Atari was the world leader in the video game industry at that time, it did rather badly in Japan due to lack of experience. Despite some financial difficulties at the outset Namco went on to do some basic research into the American video games technology. So it was not until 1977 that their first product, Galaxians invaded the Japanese arcades. The timing was just right. People were getting fed up with the original Space Invaders and wanted something new. Galaxians did exceedingly well but their best seller was still a gleam in a hungry software experts eye. When Namco released Pacman the company's profits rocketed. The idea of Pacman was devised by one of Namco's software specialists. One day he was so hungry that he imagined himself eating a pizza. This train of thought led him to picture a pizza with a piece cut off, looking as if the bigger portion was trying to eat the smaller one. Then he thought to himself: \"Why not write a game about eating?\" From this bright idea Namco's development team added various ideas such as the ghosts and the power pills and unleashed a little yellow monster on the world! Contrary to the popular belief Pacman is Japanese; Atari merely holds the rights to produce the home computer and home video versions. All in all the game took about 12 months to develop. The name Pacman derives from the Japanese word \"paku paku\" which describes the movement of the mouth when eating. The reason for the great commercial success of Pacman apart from the originality of the game is attributed to Japan was the only country in the world which had to mint more coins in order to satisfy the enormous demand created by the arcade boom caused by the original Space Invader machines. The company which created those first Invader machines made a huge killing while arcade centres and even Space Invader coffee houses sprung up like mushrooms. People queued for hours to play the Invaders. All this led to the creation of more than 200 companies trying to cash in on the very lucrative arcade industry. This is a story of one such pioneer of the arcade video games, Namco. Virtually unknown in this country, Namco is the most exciting arcade company in Japan. When the Space Invader boom began to wane, the game was quickly followed by the Galaxian. This development of the alien invader theme was an instant success. Galaxian was Namco's very first video game and since then the company have gone from strength to strength. Tom Sato looks at the Japanese video boom. ore and others over breach of copyright of Pacman is simple. While Atari paid millions to Namco, Commodore and the rest of the copycats didn't pay a cent. But the licensing of Pacman didn't stop at the video games. Soon, there was Pacman sports gear and Pacman toys everywhere. It is said that Namco earned more than three times as much from royalties generated by the Pacman character than from the actual video game! Time magazine commented, in April 1982, that Pacman's income will exceed that of the movie Starwars! Apparently, one cornflake manufacturer put a Pacman picture on the packaging and the sales took off. However, all is not well for Namco. In Japan, there are people who pirate arcade games. Although it may appear to be rather difficult to produce \"clones\" of sophisticated arcade machines, there are a number of technological pirates about in Japan. Namco has no less than 20 full-time detectives investigating piracy, using sophisticated spying equipment to catch the pirates. Last year, Namco developed the now hugely successful Atari game called Pole Position. The development of Pole Position cost the company well over three-quarters of a million pounds and has some of the most convincing graphic 3D effects so far seen on an arcade machine. It incorporated some custom made integrated circuits in order to prevent the pirates making \"clones\" using commercially available micro-chips. It sounds incredible but within two months, there were pirated Pole Positions available on the black market at half the price of the original! This time Namco was determined to catch the pirates red handed so they sent out all of their detectives to monitor known secret laboratories and hide outs. The whole operation came to a dramatic Hollywood style end when they tailed a truck believed to be on its way to pick up a consignment of illegally produced Pole Position machines. They eventually reached a secret factory 1,000 miles away from Tokyo and apprehended several pirates and confiscated 20 clones\", renamed Top Position. Sounds like something out of The Sweeney, doesn't it? So how do the pirates make these \"clones\"? As soon as an original arcade machine is released they get hold of one and disassemble it, obtaining photographs of the printed circuit boards and names of the chips it uses. The custom-made chips are opened the fact that Namco licensed two American companies to produce Pacman for the U.S. market. Thanks to Atari, the U.S. market is about five times that of Japan and about 10 times that of Europe. Namco licensed Midway to produce the coin operated arcade machines and Atari to sell the home video game versions of Pacman. Atari splashed out on a national T.V. advertising campaign and soon Pacman became a household word. The sales of the Pacman cartridge can only be described as explosive! Namco earned millions from the royalties. The reason why Atari sued Commod152 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"al of the rising clone  up and analysed using micro-photographic equipment. Once they work out how the chip works they then produce a circuit to do exactly the same thing. This process is called \"reverse technology and the ironic thing is that much of Japanese industry started off using this technique. The pirates who analyse the originals are quite skilled, and are sometimes engineers working for large computer manufacturers and moonlighting. They are equipped with mainframe computers and electronics equipment costing hundreds of thousands of pounds. They see creating a \"clone\" as a challenge. They pass on the information to other pirates whose exclusive function is to set up an overnight factory in a remote part of Japan and mass produce the \"clones\". The marketing is handled by other pirates who specialise in this field. The whole operation is master-minded by organised crime syndicates. They regard arcade piracy as being safer than drug trafficking. Namco has just released a sequel to Pole Position called Pole Position Pt II. It gives you choice of four racing circuits and the backgrounds are more detailed than before. Most arcade players in Japan really go in for convincing backgrounds and in Pole Position Pt II, there is one circuit which has a multi-level crossing and a fairground with a big wheel and rollercoasters! Also the car crashes in a more realistic fashion. You see the car break up into bits while the wheels bounce away from the crash if you are unlucky enough to go off the road. Just recently, two companies released laser-disc motor-racing games and it looks as if Namco could have been outsmarted by them. Taito's Laser Grand Prix (C&VG, November) uses Laser vision which provides actual scenes from Fuji Speedway. The visual and sound effects are superb. Tazmi has a Pole Position-like game with no less than three screens to fill the whole of your field of view! But one arcade fanatic commented that Namco always comes up with something really original. I think he is right. In 1984 I believe that Namco will release something extraordinary using laser technology. The current trend in arcade games in Japan are sport simulations. There are now arcade games which feature anything from water-skiing to women's volleyball! It is very likely that there will be convincing flight simulator game next year. Another trend is towards micro computer software. Due to the fact that Sinclair's cheap micros never reached Japan and Atari's absence from Japanese home video game system market meant that the games software industry for home micro is relatively new in Japan. Since there is a law in Japan to protect arcade games there is a lack of computer games converted from the arcade favourites. There is an awful lot of illegal stuff about, though! Sega Enterprises they made Frogger, Zaxxon and Buck Rogers, Planet of Zoom-have produced their own micro called the Sega 3000 to sell their original arcade games. Namco too has joined forces with one of the leading software distributors called Dempa. Their first offering was, predictably, Pacman! COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 153 "

You can store between 85 and 100k on a Microdrive cartridge, and a 16k program will load in about 10 seconds. Microdrives are fast, but they're not really discs. Inside a microdrive cartridge is a loop of high quality tape, and the drive itself is just a very accurate (supposedly) cassette recorder. If you've got a BBC then you'll need a disc interface fitted, which costs around . ITL has no intention at the moment of producing one, so you'll have to use the BBC one. MORE MEMORY The size of the largest program which you can fit into your machine is governed by the size of the area of memory in which the computer stores it. The problem is that although memory chips are now quite cheap, some micros still have very little RAM, as it's called. One of the first enhancements which a computer owner will make in such a case is a memory expansion. The ZX81 although very popular has only lk of RAM. (lk is about two screenloads of program.) It's very easy to expand your ZX81's memory. You can buy a 16k RAM pack which just plugs into the back of the machine and costs around . You may have heard of the much-feared contemporary disease known as \"RAM pack wobble\", caused by Sinclair not putting the edge connector on their RAM pack in the right place. This disease can be fatal to a program, as a slight wobble at the wrong time can erase a whole afternoon's typing. One cure is a blob of something sticky under the machine, although a less messy solution is to look to a different company. You can also get 64k RAM packs which allow for even more storage of data and programs. Upgrades for the 16k Spectrum are available from Sinclair for , but you'll have to send your machine back to Clive, and you know how long that takes, don't you? Alternatively, you can buy a ZX81-like RAM pack which sits on the back of the machine, or some companies sell chips which you can stick inside, as long as you didn't really want the guarantee anyway. If you're going to upgrade your Spectrum, check that the company's product will fit your particular machine. There are currently three different versions of the Spectrum in circulation and although they all look the same from the outside, there are some small variations inside which may make a difference. Expansion for an Atari is easy; the memory comes in chunks of plastic which you install by removing the cover on top of the machine. Newer machines come with 48k but some old 400's still have only 16k. Your local dealer should be able to tell you how to improve this. To expand a Texas TI99/4 or 4a you'll need a peripheral expansion box. This takes the form of a large aluminium crate about the size of the small freezer compartment in a fridge. (I don't know why, but everyone seems to measure the size of computers in relation to parts of fridges.) Inside this you can then put disc drives, memory expansions and anything else. Retail price for the box alone was around  but that may drop now that the Texas micro is no longer being made. Memory expansion on a Vic is peculiar. It is in the form of plug-in cartridges and comes in four flavours, which are 3k, 8k, 16k or 32k. The annoying thing is that because the cartridge overwrites that part of memory which used to hold the contents of the screen, the screen RAM is moved to a different place. The problem is that each cartridge puts it somewhere different, so programs written for use with an extra 3k will not necessarily run directly on a 16k machine without minor alterations. This is very inconvenient, especially for magazines who publish program listings! If you're tired of having to do octopus impressions to play your favourite computer game a joystick interface is called for. This allows machines which normally have no provision for such a gadget to have one, and very useful they are too. The most popular machine, which lacks a joystick interface, is the Spectrum, and there are now quite a few companies who will remedy this situation for you. The official way is by use of the Sinclair Interface 2. This costs just under  you get 5p change! and allows two standard Atari-type controllers to be used. You can then write your own games using the joysticks to control the The byte-drive 500 is a 3' disc drive from ITL. The small discs are endlosed in rigid plastic and currently cost over  each. The clever part is the cable which links the drive to the micro. This contains all the electronics, so if you change micros, you just change the cable but keep the same drive.

"ABF PROGRAMMABLE JOYSTICK 22.95 INTERFAC MICRODRIVE COMPATIBLE ONLY 32.95 +xOpp for 990 Spectrum or ZX81 ABOUT OUR INTERFACE The AGF Programmable Joystick Interface is a unique design offering the use of any Atari compatible joystick with absolutely all software, whether it is cassette or ROM cartridge, with the Sinclair Spectrum or ZX81. The hardware programmable interface re. quires no additional software and accurately replicates the keys of the computer in a manner which is responsive to absolutely ALL key reading methods, both BASIC and Machine Code. The interface does not interfere with key operation and can therefore be used simultaneously with the keyboard. There is no need to remove the interface once fitted as the rear extension connector will accommodate further expansion, ie printers or RAM packs etc. This important feature avoids excessive wear to the expansion port. The key replication principle pioneered by AGF means that your own programs can use eight directional joystick movement by utilising simple key reading BASIC. Two joystick sockets are provided which share the same keys, for use with the majority of two player games. Several interfaces may be used on the same computer for multiple joystick applications. The interface is programmed by a two digit code, which is looked up on a programming chart supplied for each direction and firing button. The two numbers are then selected on a pair of leads which are clipped onto appropriately numbered strips on the interface. Once configured this can be marked on a Quick Reference Programming Card for storing with the game. As the programming is not power dependent the interface retains the last configuration made and can be immediately used when next switched on. PACKAGE CONTENTS SUPPLIED  Programmable Interface Module as illustrated, complete with clip-on programming leads. Self adhesive programming chart detailing how to define which key is simulated by UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and FIRE. This can be fixed on to the case of your computer or if preferred the protective backing can be left on. The chart is made of a very durable reverse printed plastic and is extremely easy to read. One pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards for at-a-glance setting to your games requirements. The card allows you to mark the configuration in an easy to read fashion with space to record the software title and company name. Video Graffiti demonstration program which is written totally in BASIC to illustrate how all eight directions and fire can be read. This is also a useful high resolution drawing program.  12 months guarantee and full written instructions.

"SiX Spectre PLANETOIDS action, or buy commercial software written for use with the device. Interface 2 also allows you to use plug-in cartridge software, although these retail at  a time. The problem with all the different joystick interfaces is that they use their own systems. So a program written for use with a Kempston joystick will not run on an Interface 2 unless the program contains a routine for each and you are allowed to select which one you want. One way round this predicament is by a programmable joystick interface. Such a beast is the one from AGF. This comes with a grid of small holes and a set of five wires. The wires are labelled with the functions of the joystick (up, down, left, right and fire) and the holes are labelled with the keys on a Spectrum keyboard. If the game which you want to play uses the K key to fire, then you plug the 'FIRE lead into the 'K' hole and so on. Such a device is very useful. BETTER KEYBOARDS When you finally tire of the piece of dead flesh known as your Spectrum's keyboard, there are a number of better ones around. The best are quite expensive at around  but they allow the whole machine to fit inside and look rather smart. One of the most popular around is made by Fuller. Kempston is also about to launch a high quality keyboard for the Spectrum, as demonstrated recently at the ZX Microfair. You'll also find replacements for the touch-sensitive keyboard of the Atari 400 from about . If you have an Atari VCS and feel like getting into computing, you can now buy an add-on keyboard from Vulcan Electronics, which is made by Spectravideo. It sits on top of the VCS and plugs into the joystick ports and the main cartridge slot and you can then program your VCS in Basic. It costs . Mattel Intellivision owners can also do the same to their machine. Mattel offers a similar device, as well as a music keyboard to enable you to compose music on your machine. I don't reckon Bach would think much of it, but it's not bad. SOUNDS AND SPEECH If your idea of a good evening is being locked in a quiet room with a micro, then you could always get more friendly with it by talking to it or having it talk to you. But before those nice little men in white coats come to take you away, let me explain. If you have a Pet, Vic, 64, Spectrum, ZX81 or BBC and need someone to talk to you then you could always try a Chatterbox. This costs  from William Stuart systems and you can program it to say anything you like. From the same company comes Big Ears which, for another , reverses the process and allows you to speak to your computer. Say the word through the microphone a few times, and the machine will then remember it. If you then say it again, it should recognise what you're saying. If it's a Spectrum you've got then the Currah microspeech is another possibility besides a Chatterbox. It works on the same system and sells for under . BBC owners can also choose the official Acorn speech system, which is a computerised version of Kenneth Kendall. Personally I can just about recognise him, but many say that it might just as well be Moira Stuart. (In fact, I wish it was.) If you prefer noise to plain speech then there are a couple of units available to improve the sound of a Spectrum by providing it with the same sound chip as the BBC and Oric. WHAT'S LEFT OVER Finally, we come to the rest of the oddments which space did not allow separate headings for. If you own an Aquarius, then this year should see the introduction of the home controller unit. This plugs into the machine and allows you to control household appliances by using special plugs which go into the wall and receive messages from the computer. Such a system is also planned for the Electron. If you have an Atari VCS then you may already know about the super expander. This lets you load games from cassette, and also improves the quality of the graphics slightly. Printerface is a mixture of interface and printer and is a device to let you link a printer to a micro. DAMS office systems supplies an IEEE cartridge to allow a Vic or 64 to connect to any Commodore printer (or disc drive for that matter.) The Spectrum will only work with a ZX printer, but you can use the RS232 connection on an Interface 1 to link a large range of printers. If you have a Centronics-type printer then Kempston will supply you with a suitable interface for a Spectrum. If you own a computer other than a Sinclair machine but would be perfectly happy to use a cheap () Sinclair printer, you can get a suitable interface for many popular micros, including the BBC, Dragon and Vic, from Microtanic Computer Systems of London. LIGHT SENSORS Another way of controlling a game is with a light sensing device. Usually mounted in a pen-like barrel (and, therefore, called a light pen) these allow you to draw patterns on the screen as though it were a piece of paper. Recently launched is the Light Rifle from Stack Systems of Bootle, Merseyside. It comes with three demo games where you have to shoot at targets on screen, just like those old TV game machines, but these games are better as they rely on all the facilities of the micro. You can also write your own shooting-time programs. The light rifle costs just under  and versions are available for the Spectrum, Vic and 64. ABITS! COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 159 "

"GRAPHICS By Garry Marshall MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR 64 255 255 195 195 231 102 231 231 Over the next few issues, I shall be looking at the graphics capabilities of the Commodore 64. This new computer has very impressive graphics facilities, which I'll be helping you make the most of. I'll begin by looking at the way that user-defined characters are created. In fact, the entire keyboard is \"soft\" in the sense that it is possible to redefine the character that is associated with every key. This is possible because the Commodore 64 really does have 64k of random-access memory. All the ROM, including the Basic ROM, the operating system ROM and the character generation ROM, is covered by RAM, so that ROMs can be switched out and the range of characters that they provide supplied instead by RAM. Because of this, the characters that are stored in the character generator and printed from the keyboard can be copied from the character generator ROM into RAM so that all the characters are available when this ROM is disabled. Then we can change the characters associated with any key as we wish. To write the program to do this, all we need to know is the addresses of the registers that control the operations involved. The characters themselves are based on an 8x8 dot matrix. Each dot can be on or off, and the resulting character is defined by using a 1 for a dot that is on and a 0 for a dot that is off. Then each row of the character is represented by the decimal equivalent of the binary number for the whole row. This is illustrated in figure 1. In this way, we could design a completely new style for each letter of the alphabet or a set of graphics characters for a particular application. The program I shall give allows the character in the illustration to be assigned to the key associated with any letter of the alphabet to that, when that key is pressed, it gives this character rather than the letter The program starts by setting the contents of location 53272 to make the video chip take character descriptions from the area of RAM The program is: 10 POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272) AND 240) + 12 20 POKE 52,48: POKE 56,48: CLR 30 POKE 56334, PEEK(56334) AND 254 40 POKE 1,PEEK(1) AND 251 50 FOR K=0 TO 2047 60 POKE K+12288, PEEK(K+53248) 70 NEXTK 80 POKE 1,PEEK(1) OR starting at the location with address 12288, rather than from the character ROM. Line 20 prevents this area of RAM from being overwritten by a Basic program. Then lines 30 and 40 permit the character ROM to be assessed so that its contents can be copied into RAM with lines 50 to 70. Lines 80 and 90 then return the computer to its original state. Lines 100 and 110 request that a letter is entered from the keyboard, accept an input and check that it is a letter, before allowing control to pass to the remainder of the program which assigns the character in the illustration to the key for that letter. If you run the program, you will notice that all occurrences of the letter on the screen are replaced by the graphics character straight away. This is because the screen refresh circuitry now refers to the area of RAM prescribed by the program rather than the character ROM for character descriptions Also, of course, pressing the key for the letter given to the program now gives our character rather than the letter itself. The program can be used as the basis of a scheme for changing the characters associated with any and every key on the keyboard. More on the Commodore 64's interesting graphics capabilities in the next issue. 90 POKE 56334, PEEK(56334) OR 1 100 INPUT \"LETTER\"; LS 110 I+ASC(LS) 64: IF (I<1) OR (1>26) THEN 100 120 FOR NEO TO 7 130 READ X: POKE 12288+8*I+N,X 140 NEXT N 150 DATA 255, 255, 195, 195 160 DATA 231, 102, 231, 231 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 161 "
