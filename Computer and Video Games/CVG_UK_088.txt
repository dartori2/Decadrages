"Best Actor Oscar with himself. But as for Cronenberg getting Best Director I doubt it. This film is just too uncomfortable! If only Manhunter (18) was as starkly chilling in its portrayal of madness. It uses the promising premise of an FBI man called out of retirement to help track down a serial killer who only murders at the full moon. He has just four weeks to stop the next death. But his method involves getting inside the psychotic's mind, putting his family's safety and his own sanity at risk. An interesting starting point but director Michael Mann is best known for creating Miami Vice and uses the same sort of designer settings, flash camerawork and rock promo music in a tale which would be best told in a more restrained fashion. Manhunter is a reasonable two hours but should have been better. January is obviously the month for style because Heart of Midnight (18) also wears its art on its sleeve. Jennifer Jason-Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis' sister) is the frail young girl with a history of breakdowris who inherits a run down nightclub in a seedy area of town and uses it to break from her oppressive mother. Almost immediately she's moved in things start to go wrong. The rooms above the club appear to have been decorated by the Marquis de Sade and there are strange noises in the walls and ceiling.

Once he's collected all of the medallions, nothing can stop Dracula and his supernatural cohorts from creating terror on earth and generally having a good time. Of course, standing in his way are the usual Van Helsings, armed with bows and arrows and deadly stakes, guaranteed to give any vamp a coronary. The game features loads of sampled spooky sounds, including a pretty grisly blood-slurping effect which chilled the more sensitive members of the OVG staff to the marrow.

"Stormlord, and the accounted for about half of the total toy sales in the USA last year. According to certain sources, this is because toy distributors are very wary about handling anything which might be connected with computers a market which experience has taught them is very volatile. Similarly, the series of light phaser guns (Lozer Tag, Photon Warrior, etc) won't be making an appearance of the show. Allegedly this type of toy has been avoided by distributors ever since the tragic Hungerford massacre of Summer '87 which made parents stop buying guns and other \"violent\" toys for their kids. This has also meant that the motorised water pistols which were such a big hit last year have adopted a much lower profile, to the extent that manufacturers have been painting their fake UZI 9mms in a less aggressive shade of yellow, rather than khaki.

The 1989 show stopper will be Texas Instruments' Voyager. The Voyager is a microprocessor-operated intelligence' buried within a pair of headphones connected to a wrap-around microphone. The computer talks to the player through headphones, asking questions and playing word games, but the really whizzo thing about Voyager is that you can talk back to the game, which understands a grand total of four words! Now that might not sound a lot, but this is the first toy of its kind to feature such a form of interaction, and Texas Instruments, are already trying to upgrade the system to understand 16 words. And if the technology is developed to its full potential it could change the face of all forms of computer gaming...but we'll just have to see, won't we?
