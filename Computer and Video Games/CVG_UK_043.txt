"Instead of computers catc) technology now has to cat ENTERPRISE The way we see it, technology has suddenly got quite a race on its hands. There's no other home computer in the world that's so expandable or so updatable as the new Enterprise 64. And if you're wondering quite how we've managed that, kindly take a closer look at the outputs on our remarkable new machine. You'll notice that amongst all the usual sockets and terminals, we've gone and incorporated a special 66-way expansion port. This will accept a whole range of new peripherals that are in the pipeline. Including those that are a mere twinkle in the eyes of our hardware designers. We thought this expandability principle was such a good idea, we applied it to the Enterprise's memory, too. Even in its most basic 64K form, this puts more user RAM at your disposal than almost any other competitor. But plug in our special Rampacks to the base unit, and you can progressively increase that figure to a truly extraordinary 3,900K. "


"ching up with technology, atch up with a computer. NTLIKS TAMINS  BIL Not that that's the only challenge we present to today's ambitious programmers. With a screen resolution of up to 672 x 512 pixels, 256 colours and a high speed video processor, the Enterprise will outgun all but the highest quality TV monitors. And the sophisticated sound chip generates no fewer than 4 voices across 8 octaves in full stereo. Combine the two and you can create effects that leave today's games looking like pub video tennis of the mid-seventies. For anyone with literary aspirations, the Enterprise also comes complete with an integrated word processor. Whilst the really serious user will be delighted to discover analogue RGB and TV outputs, as well as parallel, RS423 serial and network ports. Both Cobol and C will be available with CP/M running, and you can even use Lisp, Forth and Z80 assembly language on cartridge without encroaching on user RAM. The new Enterprise 64.

The laser towers are multidirectional and totally featureless when viewed from the outside. Fortunately, your Hedroid is armed with radar and it can check out which way the tower is likely to be pointing its deadly weapon. You can either destroy the tower or make it turn by zapping it with the Hedroid's laser. The screen display shows a main view of the maze plus an image of the Hedroid itself which changes colour as you progress through the various zones of the maze, a \"viability\" or energy indicator FIRE programmers, two mathematicians and two computer boffins, have developed a neat way of moving things behind other things on screen â€” if you follow me! Just watch the giant robot rovers and you'll see what I mean. Once you've got the hang of driving the Hedroid around the maze and it does take a bit of getting used to you'll be hooked.

"The BOND DIARY COMING SOON TO A C&VG NEAR YOU! \"My name is Bond. James Bond...\" How many times have you thrilled to these words! They mean that action and adventure are just a few short film frames away. Now Bond is back in town and soon to be seen saving td world again in a brand new 007 epic called A View to a Kill. And, at last nere's a Bond computer game to go along with it! Yes, 007 comes to e small screen thanks to the people who brought you Eureka! Over the next couple of issues C&VG will be tracing the development of the Bond game bringing you all the inside information on how it came to be in THE BOND DIARY. It promises to be just as intriguing as one of the Bond plots. This issue we'll be telling you a bit about the background to the game. Next issue we'll bring you exclusive screen shots of the game itself and then in July C&VG will proudly present an 007 extravaganza with competitions and much more. Bet you can't wait! In the meantime, on with the main feature ... T all started when Mark Strachen and Dominic Wheatley. the people who master-minded the 125,000 prize adventure game Eureka! began looking around for a follow-up. They learned about the new Bond movie A View to a Kill and immediately saw the great potential for a computerised version of 007's adventures. But this time they wanted an arcade game -not an adventure. After all Bond movies are packed with action! They set about acquiring the licence to the movie for an as yet undisclosed fee and began looking around for a software company good enough to come up with the goods. They chose Softstone, a relatively unknown company with the advantage of having a team of very talented programmers. Another company, called Special K who specialise in game design and production, created the storyboards for the game which Softstone then began to turn into data and graphics. The brief to Special K and Softstone was to produce four arcade style games based on stunts featured in the movie. Domark struck lucky when they discovered that a friend was a film editor actually working on the Bond movie. He was quickly snapped up to help make sure that the games look as dose to the film as possible. Meanwhile, that supergroup Duran Duran had been chosen to write the theme music to A View to a Kill and Domark decided that they wanted to use the same music on the game and set out on yet another quest for a licence. It proved successful and the Duran Duran sound will be featured for the first time on a computer game. Another first for Domark is that the game will be released at the same time as the Bond movie hits the cinema screens. The Ghostbusters game came along sometime after the movie. And talking of Ghostbustere!, ace programmer and head of Activision, David Crane, has seen storyboards of the game and loves the look of it! Activision will be handling the game in the US. The A Tew to a Kill game is being written for the spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad and MS9| and an Enterprise version could be on the cards. The royal premier of the movie will take place in London on June 12th. What would Bond think about all this? Well, according to Mark and Dominic, the current James Bond in the elegant form of Roger Moore enjoys playing computer games. We hope to bring you his vieux of the 007 game! Next issue well bring you some exclusive screen shots of A View to a Kill plus an inside view of the programmers at work. Don't miss it! 25 "

"NV. GAME OF ? THE  MONTH Sgch 118 Tom Sato, the man behind the MSX supplement in our December issue, has turned his hand to programming the BBC computer and has come up with some pretty amazin' results. Smarty Berty is Tom's adaptation of the successful arcade game Q*Bert. Tom's game differs from the original in that, instead of having the same shape to jump across a pyramid in Q/bert's case, the program presents an ever varying selection of different shapes which you must cross changing the colour of the squares.

"MOUNT CHALLENGE SURVIVE THE JOB JUNGLE! I PRACTICAL GUIDE TO SURVIS DREBBINGIE The story so far: 48K SPECTRUM Earth, 1987. A strange protrusion emerges from shark infested waters amidst a group of islands in the South Pacific. Nobody has yet reached this object, which is possessed by an evil force and guarded by deadly plants, murals, pigmen, chasing ghouls and yellow horned demons. Prof. Burk arrives on the scene, resplendent in his newly invented space suit and jet pack able to withstand the forces emanating from the green and red blocks which cover the Mount. He intends to be first to the summit. Woefully the jet pack cannot withstand all of the effects of the coloured blocks and therefore great care has to be taken when jumping from block to block, so as to ensure correct coordination of the ENERGY LEVEL (On/Off) with the coloured block being stood on. Ignoring all advice against attempting his objective, the fearless mountaineer states, \"people risked their lives to conquer Mount Everest, why not this challenge? Your mission is to help guide the determined Prof. Burk to the top of Mount Challenge (you'll need to draw a rough map as you go along). Good luck!

SMITH Atari software produced by ENGLISH SOFTWARE. (48K Disk 32K Cas But Atari owners used to be a funny lot, being heard COLOSSUS CHESS 3-0 to utter such gems as: \"It can't be any cop, If it costs less than \" Honestly, that's what they used to sayl Anyway, in the face of this rather strange attitude, we went 48K Disk) ahead and committed the ultimate sin: ATARI GAMES AT .95! .95 We expected some slight resistance to these 48K Cas .95 .95 prices from Atari owners who only equated high BBCBI Amstrad Electron CBM64, 68CBI quality with high prices, but we were wrong: Everybody thought the prices were great, and the .95 N NEW! games too!

Today is the final part of your assessment exams and is the final, and hardest, hurdle you have to clear to claim the famous red beret. Strapped into the gunners' seat, you must destroy a mock up of a small village in central Europe. Your ultimate target is a large house on a hill overlooking the village which has been taken over by enemy troops, and is being used as a permanent headquarters. Your job is made more difficult by the changing speed of the wind. You must work the target and take into account the wind before you fire the shell, because the wind speed and direction can change so rapidly. There are two levels in level one there is a constant wind speed and direction and in level two there is a constantly shifting wind speed and direction.

"PYRA On an archaeological expedition in North Africa you were separated from the rest of your party by a huge sand storm. After several days of stumbling through the desert on the point of dying of thirst, you found a small oasis and, after drinking as much as you could, you slumped to the ground in a deep sleep. The dust cloud had cleared when you woke and you are now facing three enormous Pyramids. These Pyramids are, as you have recognized from your training, the lost Pyramids of Aaron. No one has seen them for over four thousand years and legends circulate through the whole of North Africa that one of these three pyramids contains the Aaron diamond, a perfect gem the size of a child's head. Fame and fortune will be yours if you can search each of the pyramids in turn and recover the diamond. Unfortunately, the pyramids contain many devious traps and you will have to use your ingenuity to survive. Full instructions are included in the listing.

"SPRING INTO ACTION FOR TODOH :ZEM Z Welcome to Blabgor, home of Gribbly Grobbly, one of a race of peaceful creatures who have developed their brain to such an extent that they can move around entirely by thought power alone, their intelligence or Psi being stored in their Psi banks which must be topped up regularly The hills around them are infested with more primitive creatures who are out to attack and carry off the younger Blabgorians, known as Gribblets. In this exotic world the Gribblets lead a carefree life and can be found playing behind rocks, over the lakes and on mystical floating islands.

"Verb Aridis, a planet on the far side of the Milky Way, has slowly, over the last hundred years, been becoming drier and drier. Almost the entire planet's surface has now become inhospitable desert and scrub land, and the Aridians are now threatened with extinction. Desperate to save their race, they launch into space on a mission to invade Earth known throughout the galaxy as the \"ocean planet\" -and resettle the population of Aridis. Obviously, the governments of Earth are less than happy about this arrangement and have banded together their defence systems in an attempt to stop the advancing Aridis squadrons. You have been drafted in to handle one of the laser gun turrets based on the ground. Your job is to destroy all the Aridian ships which escape through the first lines of defence. But you will have to be fast because they are only in range for a few seconds and, even if only one ship touches down, Earth will be finished. Full instructions are included in the game.

The natives are hostile, the army corrupt and the volcanoes erupting. The action starts at NSRT headquarters in Washington, where you are just in time to watch the last transmission from the beleaguered team. The satellite transmission is just coming in and you are invited to tune it in using your joystick. The screen changes to display a receiving screen, with interference and a hissing noise. Movement of the joystick changes the tone of the hissing and eventually you get clear visual reception, alternating with spells of interference. You are then summoned to the boss's office for briefing and a text conversation follows, in which you are asked your name. I called myself Supremo, of course! At the end of this session, you are asked if the assignment is OK-if you answer NO, the game ends with you getting booted out.

All sorts of pitfalls confront you and, if you make the wrong choice, it's curtains from getting beaten up in a parking lot to making a tasty casserole for cannibals.

It left me feeling that, with the apparently limited choices open to me, I would have been just as well off reading the game in book form.

"SUPER SKETCH A Remarkable Innovation in Video Graphics RAINFALL AND LANDUS Until now, creating computer graphics in colour has been both a demanding and expensive endeavor. The Super Sketch Graphics Tablet provides a totally unique and simple medium for creating video graphics at a surprisingly low cost. By simply moving the stylus control arm, as you would a pencil, Super Sketch reproduces the movement on the video screen. Four control buttons at the top of the tablet assist in operating the graphic functions of the software. Graphics may be created by \"free hand\" or by \"tracing\" from drawings clipped to the pad. Compared with other computer graphic products, it is much easier to use than keyboard controls, does more than joysticks, paddle con trollers and mouse controllers, and is less expensive than touch pad products. A brief demonstration instantly proves the remarkable features of Super Sketch. This product makes an excellent \"Demo Display\" in retail stores because anyone can immediately produce graphics with little or no instructions. SIPASTUR TIL MONTHS OF YEAR S OTHER SUPER.
