"ED-FIRST DOUBLE PAGE BONANZA SPECIAL Liya! I've got a couple of things to tell you about this month. And, er, well, here they are. HOW TO GET A JOB WITH CVG Also this month we wave farewell to little Rob Swan who is leaving our happy band to become even more famous and earn even more money than he is already. In his time with us, Rob has provided many a smile, a song, and occasionally, an ulcer. But that's all in the past now, because he's setting up his own programming team (Steel Developments watch out for their first blockbuster, COP, starring a robot that transforms into a Lambourghini), and his own freelance wordsmithery with fellow metal-merchant and ex-CVG reviewer Tony Dillon. In whatever free time he has left, ultra-entrepreneur Rob also plans to write a best-selling novel, based on his, no doubt, best-selling game. He's always been good at story-telling, so he is assured success, and we hardly need wish him good luck. Luckily, he's promised to make some time to make the occasional appearance in the review pages. Still, eh? Anyway, this leaves us one man down, as it were, and we need someone to fill Rob's seat. So, I would draw your attention to the advertisement on these very pages. If you think you're the person for the job, send in some reviews and a CV, but I would warn you that it's not all playing games. In fact it's a lot of hard work and a fair few late nights, but the rewards are more than just financial. HOW TO USE YOUR FREE GLOW IN THE DARK STICKERS TO WIN A SUPER FAMICOM irst off, have you checked out your free glow-in-thedark stickers on the cover? Leave them in the light for a minute, then close the curtains or switch the lights oft, or stick a coat over your head, and scream in horror as those ravenous teeth or zombie-like eyes light up! Not only can these stickers put the wind up your feeble-minded enemies, they can also win you a Super Famicom! There are four sets of stickers in total. Two come free with the June and July issues of CVG, and two come free with the June and July issues of MEAN MACHINES On each set, there will be a competition token sticker, and all you have to do is collect all four stickers, then attach them to the competition entry form which will be printed in the July issues of both magazines. Then, answer a simple question or two and send in your completed form and you will be entered for the competition to win one of four Super Famicoms two of which will go to CVG readers, and two of which will go to MEAN MACHINES readers. So, make sure you get hold of the next issue of CVG and the June and July issues of MEAN MACHINES and one of these raunchy consoles could be yours! Rob climbs aboard his Robmobile for the last time, waves a cheery farewell and pulls off in the direction of Chatham. "

"NEWS Commodore's latest wonder-machine is the first product to be officially launched in the UK to use CD-ROM. Based around existing powerful Amiga technology, the Commodore Dynamic Total Vision (CDTV) could turn out to be best thing for the games player since the Super Famicom, or could it? Richard Leadbetter takes a look. SPECI 0:46 THE WHAT IS CD-ROM ANYWAY? The ideas behind CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Mem. ory) aren't really that different from the principles involved with floppy disks, it's just that far more information can be stored on a compact disc (about seven hundred disks worth of data can be crammed onto one CD). In short, programmers are no longer limited by the amount of memory they have to spare when programming games. This in itsell should revol utionise the games we play by providing massive amount of le vels. CD quality sampled sound and almost unlimited game play. Well, that's the theory anyway sound), as well as MIDI ports, printer ports and joystick/mouse ports. There's also capabilities to make use of a standard Amiga external disk drive. There's even a stereo headphone socket for private listening. can even turn your CDTV on and off with this useful little gadget. Commodore also want to release an infra-red joystick and trackball for the new machine. THE CDTV UNVEILED Although the casing may Amake the CDTV look more like a CD player than a computer, the CDTV is in fact based on existing Amiga technology. This means that technically speaking, the CDTV is no more powerful than a bogstandard Amiga 500. The CDTV has the same processor (a 16-bit 68000 with a speed of around 7.1 MHz) running the show, and the graphic capabilities of the machine remain unchanged. Without special programming, most games will run with 16 or 32 colours on-screen at once from a palette of 4,096. The CDTV comes with a megabyte of memory as standard. The CDTV becomes far more impressive when its CDROM is unveiled. Each disc can hold around 550 megabytes of data, and at its fastest, up to two megabytes can be loaded in one second (that's four times as much data as the average singleload Amiga game). The CDTV also doubles up as a normal CD player, and also has capabilities for playing CD Video discs. INFRA-RED CONTROL Dather like your TV or video, the CDTV is controlled via an infra-red control unit. Along with numeric keys, the control unit also doubles up as a joypad as sorts. All of the CD-audio commands (for playing, pausing, altering volume levels and the like) can also be accessed with this pad. You SMART CARD CITY There's only one problem with CD-ROM. Unlike floppy disks, you can't actually save data on a CD. So, like the Neo-Geo, the CDTV has the option to use personal smart cards. The main use of these cards to games players will probably be to save your position in a game. Personal smart cards hold up to 64K of data. INS AND OUTS The CDTV has built-in I ports that enable users to connect the machine to their stereos (to gain maximum benefit from the CD-quality 008 "


"Commodore's Daring Techno Venture grammers are very familiar with the Amiga, so they shouldn't have that much difficulty getting to grips with, and making the best of, the new system. THE VERDICT POTENTIALS UNLIMITED Decause of its large storage capabilities, the CDTV has D great potential as an educational tool, and the first products available for the machine will be encyclopedias and other educational programs, so the CDTV could well turn up in classrooms before too long. Lucasfilm are one games company expanding into CDTV territory. The new Indiana Jones adventure title (Indiana Jones and the Fates of Atlantis, due out later this year) is a much bigger game than the first, and features perfect reproductions of the brill John Williams movie scores, and a lot of very effective incidental music. Their other graphic adventure games make heavy use of the CD for storing vast amounts of hand-drawn. then-digitised scenery. The CDTV has also attracted a lot of interest among British software companies. Mirrorsoft are promising to release Defender of the Crown (ageing strategy game). Falcon (great simulation of the F16 fighter) and Xenon 2: Megablast (the Bitmap Brother's superb shoot 'em up with a CD-quality Bomb The Bass soundtrack!). Psygnosis, too, have a CDTV game in production, which goes by the working title of Planetside. The vast amount of storage space on a CD has meant that their graphics artists can really run riot on the sort of astounding ray-traced scenes that have featured in the intro sequences of many Psygnosis games. What makes development easy is the fact that most proThere are only two problems with this potentially superb ma 1 chine. First of all, Commodore are branding the machine as a home entertainment device, rather than just anoinr com puter, and the expected price tag is .00, which puts it out of the reach of most people who would use the machine for leisure purposes. Secondly, the Amiga heart of the CDTV is six-year-old tech nology and although the Amiga is a good machine, it has been technically surpassed by the likes of the Megadrive and Super Famicom. both of which have CD-ROM drives on the way which will be far cheaper and potentially even more impressive, However. Commodore see the CDTV as a tool for use in education. The whole of the Encyclopedia Brittanica can be stored on one CD and many education products are lined up for release. The CDTV could also come into its own in busi ness, with the unique remote control interlace allowing immedi ate access to massive databases But for most home users, it's the games that count and it remains to be seen how the CDTV will measure up in this area and how it will compete with the console-based CD systems, "

"MICROPROSE TEE-OFF NEWS M icroprose are currently beavering away on a potentially IVI stunning 3D golf simulation for the ST and Amiga. The action takes place on a realistic polygon-drawn 3D course, which the player can view from almost any angle. When you hit the ball, rather than see the little white object zoom into the distance, the viewpoint actually follows the ball as it flies through the air. Here's some preview shots of the game in action. The main player sprite has yet to be added, but Microprose want a fully animated digitised image to be included. They also have plans to incorporate four 18-hole courses into the final product. From what we've seen, the game has the potential to top PGA Tour Golf as the definitive golfing game. Stay tuned to a future issue of CVG for the definitive review. SALES CURVE STORM NINTENDO he Sales Curve (the people behind such hits as Silkworm, Ninja Warriors and the brilliant SWIV) have announced their acquisition of a license to publish software for the NES, Game Boy and the Super Famicom. \"Wahey!\" The only question now remains which will be the first Sales Curve release? We're plumping for SWIV. ourselves, but as soon as we have any concrete news, you (as always) will be the first to know. US GOLD TO KICK OFF, TOO ega Master System owners hankering after a bit of soccer action can now take heart in the knowledge that US Gold will soon be releasing Super Kick Off for their machines. Anco, publishers of the original Kick Off games, are certainly set to hit the heights of superstardom, what with the Super Famicom version (entitled Pro Soccer there's already a game called Kick Off in Japan) about to emerge in Japan, courtesy of Imagineer. If Tiertex (the team working on the Sega game) can produce a version up to the high standards of the Amiga version, then this should definitely be something worth shelling out the shekels for. Super Kick Off should be out and about towards November as soon as we can, we'll bring you the detailed pre view. ELITE ACTIVITY EXPLOSION SEGA TO TOUR WITH BY CHARLTON! 100 Clite have been a little quiet of late; only Gremlins 2 stands out as the most recent major release from the Walsall-based softco (World Championship Soccer and Tournament Golf didn't really cut the cheese).

"IZ REVIEW AMICA SPECTRUM $24.99 .99 HOMARD POMEL BY US GOLD HE HRR MADE THE LEADER OF RAPECIRE TERRORIST IN 1SAR The unthinkable has happened the President of the United States has been kidnapped! The fiendish guerillas have taken him to the African country of Zutula and due to the delicacy of the situation (and the bad US relations with Zulula), no military action can be taken against the terrorist organisation. However, the Secre tary of State has called in the MERCS a two-man mercenary outfit with years of combat and espionage experience. Their task is to travel into the heart of the terrorists island hideout and rescue the President, whilst wiping out as much of the organisation's military muscle as possible! This involves one or two players batlling Commando-style through eight levels of action, blasting ground soldiers, gun em placements, lanks and aircraft as they go, whilst collecting more powerful weapons, power-ups, missiles (which cause widespread devastation, but are limited in number) and food. At the end of each level lies a large enemy attack vehicle, which will try to halt the mission in ils tracks. When destroyed, the two mercenaries con tinue on their mission. If they fail, the President is doomed! I definitely agree with Rob on this one. MERCS is a great blast whichever way you look at it with big levels, big guns and massive explosions! The Commando theme may be quite a tired genre, but it's one that hasn't exactly been done very well on the Amiga. All of the features of the arcade have been successfully translated, even down to the massive gun turret that the Mercs can commandeer and use to their great advantage! The eight-way scrolling playfield works well and is a nice innovation. The graphics themselves are as close to the coin-op as can be expected and there's a nice variety in all of the backdrops and sprites. For the most part, the sound and music fit the bill perfectly (though the music at the end of each level is a bit lacking) with nice raucous explosions and hard tunes to accompany the frenetic action. MERCS is a nice conversions that fans of the coin-op original will love to bits. RICHARD LEADBETTER 018 "


"REVIE UPDATE MERCS should be blasting onto the ST (.99), C64 and Amstrad (.99) very soon now. Keep your peepers on the relevant Bytesize sections for an update. A Flame-throwers and missiles make this baby deadly! JUNGLE JEEP JAPES On your journey into the terrorist-infested jungle, there's a chance you'll come across some abandoned vehicles. Our mercenary heroes can commandeer these vehicles and use their destructive firepower against their owners! In twoplayer mode, one Merc drives while the other controls the guns! Jeeps, tanks and boats are all available for use by our gun-toting chums. Watch out for enemy fire though, because each vehicle can only take a certain number of hits before it explodes! BAD GUY BALLYHOO At the end of each level, a massive assault craft appears, and does its utmost to put you into an early grave. These include a massive jet fighter on level one, a flamespewing tank on level two, and a deadly helicopter gunship armed to the teeth on level three! These are certainly no pushover, and take all the firepower you can muster to annihilate them! 019 "


"MERCENARY COIN-OP CAPERS Capcom's MERCS was the first Ikari Warriors-style game ever that enabled three players to play simultaneously. Indeed, Capcom were fouting MERCS as the coin-op that would out-sell the massive Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles! Although it didn't do quite that well (Turtles was the biggest-selling dedicated coin-op of 1990), it was very well received and was awarded with the title of Best Combat Game of 1990 by the American computer magazine industry! Here's a few arcade screen shots to show you how US Gold's conversions compare with the coin-op original. A Our MERC hero torches all who cross his path! GUNS 'N STUFF The Mercs can collect various forms of firepower along the way, with which they can inflict more damage upon the enemy FLAME THROWER: Probably the deadliest of the weapons available, this fries everything in its path! MACHINE GUN: The standard weapon, this can be enhanced up to four shots at the same time. MISSILE: Widespread annihi lation in a nutshell! Not only that, but food can be collected along the way to top up the Merc's energy bar. This appears in several forms, including chicken legs, a cheeseburger, and even a can of spinach! Watch out for the evil dangers of cigarettes though, as these drain our heroes' energy. MERCS is a fun coin-op to play, and is certainly addictive enough playing brought back old memories of blasting away on Commando for hours on end. Tiertex, the team behind the Amiga conversion, certainly have to be commended upon this the graphics are brilliant (if a tad small), but still retain the feel of the arcade, and move rapidly enough to keep the adrenalin pumping pace intact. The gameplay is the main thing. however, and this has been captured perfectly naring around the screen, guns blazing, is certainly as much fun here as it is on the coin-op. MERCS is by no means easy, but with either one or two players, it's a real hoot. If Commando-style action is your bag, go forth to your local softshop, and get this now!

Jonathan Clive, Saffron Walden, Essex YOB: It's not surprising that you write \"in shame\"! If I wrote a letter like that I'd be pretty ashamed too! First of all, thanks for slagging the mag off when you seem to think so much of it is \"excellent\", and illustrating your arguments with out-of-date facts! Haven't you noticed that for three months now the reviews index has appeared in large print on the Contents page. Whether or not high scores are \"as crap as ever\" is a matter of opinion. We changed it to stop it looking like reams and reams of numbers which weren't very interesting to look at, and since that change the amount of post from potential highscorers has increased dramatically. Surely that suggests the popularity of the section has also increased? As for the reviews have you seen a recent issue of CVG? The extra pictures, the information boxes and the extra comment make CVG reviews more detailed than EVER! Cover games always get at least three pages, usually four, and most Hitls get three as well. By the way Oz sends his regards, but says that it's Gary Harrod who illustrates MEAN MACHINES, not him. Nothing like getting your facts straight to strengthen your argument, is there?

I'm afraid that CVG will no longer be the bestselling computer mag for long if it stays like the first overpriced pamphlet. The front cover and contents pages still give the mag a good start, but then you come to \"Ed First\", giving you a tiny month's reviews instead of the reviews index, the results, and a stupid piece of text not worth reading. News is still brilliant, but could do with more pages (as could the excellent Mailbag). The competitions are excellent as usual, and Cheat Mode is much improved. The charts are better, too. High scores are still as crap as usual, and what really gets me is the reviews, which haven't enough text, and most can be crammed into Bytesize with about one sentence to review them in. The part that makes me want to throw up is the stupid pictures of the reviewers, and the rest of the artwork. If you ask me, and I thought you might after that, you should get Jazza and Richard to do the reviewing, and Oz Browne to do all the artwork with his gifted skill in cartoon style.

"ONE OF NORWAY'S FINEST IS THE LYNX LOSING OUT? I might have given you a prize of some description if you had provided some kind of \"photograph of your sister. I think we both know what I'm talking about (wiggles eyebrows suggestively). THE HANGING QUESTION Dear YOB I think there is a distinct lack of originality in the software industry. The games are all very similar, and when an original concept is made, soon others are made in the same style. I'm not saying that I'm tired of playing games (I never will be), but games for my computer are very expensive, varying from  to . That's why I think the computer industry should be a little more inventive, and try to think of some new ideas. I've got an original (but very boring and crappy) game concept you're controlling an animated person trying to sleep. He'll stay asleep as long as you don't touch the joystick. Brill, eh?

And why should they when everyone is paying between  and  for 1,001 horizontallyscrolling-shoot-'em-upswith-extra-weapons. Coming up with something which is entirely new and which is good enough to haul the game-buying public out of the rut they're in isn't easy. So it's up to you lot to get onto your favourite software company and encourage them to do something new or even send them your ideas.

"IETTER FROM THE EDITOR YOB: Just tell them that it's probably the best C64 game you'll have bought for ages. And it will keep you going for ages and ages. And you'll shave the dog If she doesn't let you. There, how's that? tities of games being imported into the UK, but there are two problems with these: 1) Only a quarter of them are any good. 2) All the games seem to be on the same lines, eg horizontal shoot 'em ups. Can't programmers do any thing about this? As I'm only 14, games are hard to come by (due to my small wage), so it's horrid to see that games which I fancy, such as John Madden's Football, Strider, Golden Axe and Shinobi are all out of my grasp. Do you think budget games will be introduced? You may think me a cheapskate, saying all this, but believe me, I reckon ace games are worth every penny of +. it's like having an arcade in your own room! Judging by your ace reviews, it seems that the Super Fami com is going to take the console world by storm, and knock the Megadrive into orbit. Is this true? If it ever makes it officially to our shores, I fear the Megadrive is in deep trouble. I think Sega will have to reduce the price in order to compete with the Famicom, either that or release the rumoured Megadrive II. Do you think the Megadrive can compete with the more superior Famicom? Shaun Preece, Wyesham, Monmouth I think the Megadrive will be able to compete with the Super Famicom for as long as it is significantly cheaper. At the moment, an official Megadrive is half the price of an imported Super Famicom, and has a lot more games available for it, and those terms are good enough to keep people buying it. If the Super Famicom was officially released at about , then I think Sega would have something to worry about. Exciting, this consoles business, isn't it? an Amstrad CPC464, and am desperately in need of some decent games. Problem is, no half-decent games have dared to enter the Amstrad shelves. So please, please, please could you give me a few games that are worth at least picking up off the shelf? I've had a glance at the Amstrad chart, but nothing seems to apply, especially number one (which, surprisingly, is the Turtles). I wish they'd just \"rock steadily\" away to the sewers, never to return! Mark Wilson, Danbury, Essex It's true that as more people abandon their Spectrums, Amstrads and C64s for 16-bit machines and consoles, software producers have also started to concentrate on the newer machines, simply because that's where they can make their money. bviously this is a right cactus-in-the-trousers for all the Amstrad, etc, owners out there who have to make do with budget games and rereleases, but then that's the price of progress, and the only solution is to eventually move on to bigger and better machines. Is life a bitch or what? THE THIRD MAN Dear YOB, I think the high score pages should be scraped (scraped? YOB), because not many people are taking part, and the prize for winning is merely wiggling joysticks with the weeds of CVG, and it's easy to cheat with a little arithmetic. In your review of Final Fight, only Haggar and Cody appear, but on the arcade game there is a third fighter. Am ! mistaken? Michael Raz, Pollockshields, Glasgow Dear YOB, I was just wondering the other day, what game the readers are most looking forward to, or whether there's some unlicensed coin-op or film they'd like to see turned into a game. Then we can get on the blower to the software houses and say, \"Oi, why don't you produce a game based on whatever, because that's what the punters want\". Am I full of good ideas or what? By the way, why don't you cheer up and stop being such a sarky git? The Editor Who Pays Your Wages, Don't Forget. Would I forget? What a stunning idea, Paul. I've noticed a few of you readers are a mite keen on WWF Wrestling, but are there any other films, TV shows, coinops or sports you'd like to see on your computer?

For some reason the programmers of the Super Famicom version didn't include him in the conversion. For some other reason, the dopey CVG reviewers didn't mention it in the review. They won't make THAT mistake again. YOU LYING GET! Dear YOB, My brother Kevin has been telling me about a new type of Amiga. Is this true, or is he telling me a load of bogswallop? \"Muggins' Matton, Tuckhill, S Yorkshire YOB: Well, ask him if he means the CDTV (a \"home entertainment system\" which consists of an Amiga with a CD-ROM drive attached). But if he doesn't mean that you have my permission to put his fingers in a toaster. AMS-SAD Dear YOB It's okay, you can stop chucking crinkled bits of recycled paper into the waste basket. I'm not going to ask you 101 questions about stupid remarks like \"does it take a lot of practice to become an idiot\" by Mike All-Stupid (oops, my mistake) from issue 112. Anyway, why do you bother printing crummy bits of rubbish like that? Anyway, enough of that I'll get down to the point. I own Dear YOB Let me start like this: I own a C64, and am trying to get another game. When I heard about \"Last Ninja 3', 1 thought about getting it. This is the problem: my mum and day say that Ninja 3 costs too much! I thought about killing myself by watching \"Home and Away\". Couldn't you explain: 1) Why can't get this game when i'm paying with my own money? 2) When they say it costs too much, like this is only one game for , when nearly all the Amiga and ST games cost that or more?

"Welcome to the latest CVG challenge, my way of exposing the cretinous CVG reviewers as the bunch of complete incompetents that they truly are. My latest challenge revolved around the latest bunch of Electronic Arts titles released on the Sega Megadrive namely, Battle Squadron, PGA Tour Golf and Budokan. My objective was simple: to Inflict maximum humiliation on my Sworn enemies! THE CHALLENGERS M y chosen CVG-reading joystick warrior was one James IVI Davis, who hails from Isleworth in London. He'd proven his scoring worth with the aid of his Amstrad, and seemed keen to pummel his opponents into the ground. Gary Harrod (MEAN MACHINE's drawing person and current holder of the 1991 Smugness Award) was my next participant and he too seemed confident of victory. Electronic Arts provided a worthy challenger in the form of the mysterious Scott Probin. Well known to MEAN MACHINES readers as the winner of their John Madden Challenge and highly reputed for his dirty tactics just what I like! Last, and definitely least, entered CVG's Managing Editor, Julian Rignall he of the ridiculous mange-ridden hairstyle. His proven record in these competitions makes sickening reading, but I was sure that rancid Rignall and Mr Puniverse Harrod's disgusting self-confidence would be reduced to a wobbling mess, and so officially opened my challenge. TE CHALLENGE WITH GAME ONE: BATTLE SQUADRON SADIE Battle Squadron never really appealed to me. Although there's lots of explosions and napalm death, the ships' weapons just don't seem to inflict the massive amounts of pain and destruction required in games today. However, both smarmy Rignall and farty Harrod seemed rather happy about playing this game and it was quite an effort for me to keep their clammy hands away from the joypad while James practiced. Scott spent his practice-time moaning about the game confessing that he was \"crap\" and wondering why he couldn't play John Madden's instead. I threatened to introduce the toe of my boot to his tender parts before he wisely decided to shut up. I decided that the winner of this round would be the person who scored the most points in a three-minute game. A Harrod's amazing Jack Nicholson impression. "


"seconds. However, the Gods were with Scott and he finished the round with 60,750.750 points more than James. Bah! The odious Rignall, MEAN MACHINES mega moron, took his turn in front of the Megadrive, extremely eager to let the digital carnage begin. His smug over-confidence was only boosted by his performance on this game. Since this was a timed game, Rignall made excessive use of his smart bombs, deliberately dying on purpose in order to regain another complement of these lethal weapons. \"Adapting tactics within the Here's Julian's impersonation of Gary Harrod. Heroic James played a pretty boring game, taking out a good deal of the enemy fleet, but losing too many lives for comfort. He also missed a few of the vital green crosses that dot the landscape. He finished his game with a poor 60,000 points. I had expected more from the lad. Gary Harrod, friend to the tramps, arrived next at the joypad, the unhealthy toad-like one more than ready to take on the enemy empire. He bemoaned the power-up weaponry, proclaiming that he \"got the crappest weapons ever made!\". According to Jaz, it's all in the wrist action. A A pensive moment for the thickie twins. Unfortunately, Harrod's shoot 'em up skills proved to be marginally more effective than his slender grip on the English language and he was rather pleased with his 80,400 performance. Thinking that he'd won the round, he merrily shambled back to his drawing desk a sickmaking smile of smugness spreading slowly over his pasty fizzog. A The action's too much for Gary, who dozes off... boundaries of the rules\", the vile one called it. Plain cheating more like. I seethed with anger as the hopeless hypochondriac took the round (and the lead) with a nauseating 82,050 points! I felt physically sick as he made many feeble revolting noises of jubilation. The challengers commence combat. Scott's enthusiasm for his own shoot 'em up skills was completely non-existent and as he approached the Megadrive he made many apologetic noises to his EA boss, Simon Jeffrey. His performance turned out to be predictably flaccid. At one point only three bullets were on-screen, and Scott managed to park his ship right on top of one! Doh! He followed up this feat of incompetence by losing three lives in a mere 20 seconds. Just when he thought it couldn't get any worse, he developed the interesting habit of mistaking his pause key for the smart bomb button thus losing precious ...Prompting a friendly prod from the warped Jaz. "


"ZTHEZ CHALLENGE Blundering through Budokan's complicated control method, Julian managed to pummel James with his big stick but his luck didn't extend to his duels with Scott and Gary. He lost both of them and seemed rather annoyed. I laughed a lot at his ineptitude and his misfortune, but the man with less charm than a a Zambian Stink Pig with BO problems swore revenge in the next game, PGA Tour Golf. Harrod meanwhile, lost only to Scott surprising, because CONTINUES... GAME TWO: BUDOKAN h! This is a bit better! The one-on-one close-up violence of Budokan is more my sort of game, and for this round each challenger would take on each other. There are four weapons to choose from, and I decided that for this challenge his usual rod-wielding is about as limp as a lettuce in a sauna. He therefore equalled Scott's achievement of two wins and one defeat. Julian and James came joint third with one win and two defeats to their name. The challenge broke up for lunch, whereupon the simpering Paul Glancey arrived to take the assembled players out for a tasty omelette at his favourite omelette emporium. GAME THREE: PGA TOUR GOLF the Bo (big pointy stick) would be used. This seemed to be a point of much hilarity for the non-participating Richard Leadbetter, who likened the Bo to a broom handle an item of which he has particular affection for, it would seem. James seemed a bit under-confident after his defeat in PGA Tour Golf is a strangely relaxing game, which generally involves hitting small white balls with a large club (sounds like my sort of game). Scott wasted no time in spouting forth his own playing tips. He refused to begin the golfing action before he'd had the opportunity to rearrange his caddy and swap some of his clubs about, much to the bemusement of his challengers. And so the last round began, and Gary seemed confident on winning this game and thus clinching the contest. I could only hope that Gary could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory Battle Squadron, but was more than pleased when he decked the moaning Scott (who actually play-tested the Amiga version of the game). Scott, or should that be Scrote, made many excuses about his lacklustre performance, saying that it's nothing like the Amiga version\". His whinging noises were beginning to annoy me. Thankfully they stopped after this defeat, since he managed to deck both Julian and Gary quite effectively. 032 MEGA PRIVA "


"SADIE'S SCOREBOARD BATTLE BUDOKAN PGA TOTAL SQUADRON TOUR GOLF SCOTT 26 GARY 10 JULIAN JAMES 10 22 16 HOLE ONE Scott managed to hit the par level with little effort, but this cunning course confounded the other assembled cretins who all managed to get one over par. What a bunch of imbeciles! HOLE TWO Gary, Scott and Jaz managed to get one below par on the second hole making the contest rather more even. James needed one more shot. HOLE THREE A hole so easy that even Gary Harrod managed to reach the par limit with little effort or brain-power. Everyone else followed suit. HOLE FOUR Oo-er! James didn't do too well here, needing eight shots before he completed the hole. Scott and Jaz made the par limit, leaving Gary to get a birdie (the only birdie he'll ever pick up! HOLE FIVE Both Gary and Scott got a birdie on this simple hole, leaving spazmo Jaz to completely muck up his chances he needed seven shots to finish the hole! James only needed four to do the same job. HOLE SIX Scott and Gary made another birdie (what a bizarre term). Julian needed five shots and James used six to hole that peculiar white ball object. SADIE'S SUMMARY The equally repellent Scott Probin and Gary Harrod proved to be joint winners in my challenge. Scott seemed very annoyed that he couldn't test out his John Madden skills on the challengers, and Gary couldn't figure out how Julian had managed to beat his score on Battle Squadron. Cretin-boy Rignall seemed quite happy with his humiliating defeat (with a hairstyle like that, he's used to humiliation) and James seemed quite happy with the Megadrive and free games that EA kindly supplied him with. So, everyone seemed happy in one form or another! Don't you just hate a happy ending? AND FINALLY... THE PROFESSIONAL'S JOHN MADDEN BONUS PLAY-OFF HOLE SEVEN The hole had a par of four. Scott and Gary used up all four shots. Jaz made up for his previous disappointment by getting a birdie, but poor old James needed six shots to finish the hole! Bah! HOLE EIGHT A par of three here, but Scott managed to tuck the ball away with only two shots! Jaz and Gary used up three, and James used up five. I wasn't enjoying this. HOLE NINE A par of five shots for this final hole. Scott used all five shots, Julian used four (damn him!), Gary had six (ha!) and James used eight! What a contemptible performance. PGA TOUR GOLF SUMMARY Jere's the PGA Leaderboard. The scores speak for themIselves. Scott (the game's playtester, I might add) used the lowest number of strokes, followed by Gary, Julian and finally James. Confusion infested the minds of these brainless creatures, as they didn't have a clue what the final standings were. It was with great reluctance that I showed them my scoreboard, explaining what it all meant in words of one syllable. cott Probin is a bit of a reckoner when it comes to John Madden Football, and indeed, when he first visited the CVG office, he proceeded to pound Mr Rignall into the ground (a spectacle I watched with much pleasure). Not surprisingly for such an egomaniac, Scott was extremely keen to show off his skill on this occasion, and was most distressed when he discovered JMF wasn't one of the challenge games. After several hours of his moaning, I was forced to give in, and offered to pit him against the office champion, MEAN MACHINES' own Gary Harrod, a man (roughly speaking), over-brimming with confidence at the prospect of beating Scott on the game. The first half of the match proved to be most satisfying as EA's boy blunder led the bumbling MEAN MACHINES lad by 14 points to 6! Harrod couldn't even get the extra field goal point, such was the ineptitude of his abilities. I looked forward to the bearded one suffering eternal humiliation as the second half begun Unfortunately, by some mysterious fluke, all his footballing power returned to him and he managed to almost level the score, much to Probin's (and my) incredible disgust. Drooling Harrod used up all his time-outs to stop the clock and stay in the game, but eventually his stalling antics came to an end. The match finished with the score of 42 41. Harrod's kickIng ineptitude had lost him the game (hal), and to this day, Scott still infests the corridors of EA headquarters with a disgusting, Inane smile distorting his grotesque features.

"REVIEW NINTENDO .99 BY ACCLAIM HEADour reputation as a fine swordsman and all-round hero has spread into every corner of the realm of Sindarin. Your immense skill and resourcefulness in dealing with the twisted Malkil has earned you fame and glory everlasting. Sounds pretty good, eh? Well, it would be were it not for the fact that Malkil has used his evil, satanic powers to cunningly resurrect himself. Once again he is defiling the land with his powerful minions and evil magic. What this is all generally building up to is the fact that Malkil must be stopped and you are the only guy with the qualifications to do the job. This involves traversing the eight-way scrolling landscapes, collecting miscellaneous mystical items and spells ready for the final confrontation. The only problem is that Malkil has split himself into four Elemental Guardians (Earth, Wind, Fire and Water) and unless you can find the correct elemental annihilating spells, the Land of Sindarin's days are numbered... WIZARDS WARRIOR S PRESS START TO PLAY A Here's the map. 1988 RARE LTD IRONSWORD WIZARDS AND WARRIORS II WHATS YOUR PLAS QUIT INN TIME FOR TROUBLE Smart cookies who've collected a lot of treasure should make all haste to the inn, where extra weapons, spells and food can be purchased. Unfortunately, the prices tend to be rather high. If your a bit short of cash you can enter a bonus gambling game to boost your funds. Choose one of the four bowls and then wait for the skull to fall down. Should it fall into your chosen bowl you're rewarded with 290 coins! You're more likely to lose though, and your stake each time is 100 coins. Nintendo platform games are as common as muck, and to improve on the likes of Marlo and Mega Man, any new effort has to be pretty damn good. Wizards and Warriors 2 turns out to be an above average effort that lacks the edge in playability to make it a real classic. What I don't particularly like is the fact that the warrior can't attack whilst jumping, and until you've got the headbutting helmet on level two, this leaves you defenceless. What I do like about the game is that it is very challenging. It took me around forty-five minutes just to get off the first level, and level two's even tougher. Surprisingly for a Rare game, the graphics are quite dull and the sound is only average. If you're after a platform masterpiece, go for MegaMan 2 or Mario 3 (when it comes out), but if it's a challenging game you're after, take a look at this. ODOBE RICHARD LEADBETTER "


"REVIEW D525 ap THIS SPELLS TROUBLE Spells can be purloined from Malkil's meanies, found in chests, or even bought at the local shop! Here's a quick guide to the spells available in our hero's repetoire. FAMILIAR: (As in \"witches familiar\") This guys buzzes around our hero, turning enemy sprites into coins. DRAGON TOOTH: A bit like the familiar, but all the enemy sprites change into tasty food. Yum, yum. ASP TONGUE: Cast this spell at an inn at recover some energy VEIL OF SLUMBER: Slows down any enemies onscreen. FLEET FOOD: Makes you run faster and jump further. Good eh? SILVER FLEECE: Shields our hero from any enemies that dare attack. WATER SPOUT: A column of water shoots up (where does it come from?) enabling our hero to reach previously unaccessible platforms. Entering the treasure room. OPE GOLDEN QUEST The object of each level is quite simple. Your best bet is to search the platform levels with extreme care, collecting as many objects as possible. Keys come in handy for opening chests thus revealing a lot of useful items and treasures. If you're lucky you'll come across a golden relic. Take this to the end of the level and one of the animal kings will offer you help. And when you're up against the maniacal minions of Malkil, you need all the aid you can muster. Our hero dies rather painfully. Cor! INGENIOUS ITEMS Along the path to Malkil's eventual destruction, there are plenty of useful items that our hero can use to his advant age. Along with the vast amounts of gems and treasures that swell his coffers, some items boost the warrior's abilities. For example, the helmet protects the sword slashing hero's scalp from unwelcome creatures landing on his head. It also enables him to headbutt nasty creatures! If you think that's cunning, there's plenty more where that came from. Platform games on the NES are like shoot 'em ups on the Megadrive there are a hell of a lot of them, and most are pretty average. The original Wizards and Warriors was okay, but was lacking in the playability department, and unfortunately, the same has to be said here. The problem lies in the level of difficulty as Rich said, it's certainly challenging enough, but as time passes, frustration has a nasty tendency to set in, making you want to turn off the machine and play something else. The audio-visual as pect is a little disappointing, considering what Rare can do with the Nintendo (just look at Snake, Rattle and Roll, for example), and overall, you feel that a little more could have been done. Again, if you're after a platform game that'll have you glued, look elsewhere. ROBERT SWAN GAME BOY WARRIORS Check out your local Game Boy stockist for Wizards and Warriors X, a horizontally scrolling platform romp rather like the game reviewed here. Like this game, there's loads of keys, chests, and nasty enemies and a whole heap of enemies to chop to bits. Although the scrollings a bit blurry and the sound effects sound suspiciously like The Amazing Spider-Man's, Wizards and Warriors X is still a rather playable game.

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .00 BY DECO arth in the far future a weak, defenceless world, ripe for conquest. Enter the despicable King Crimson, one-time ruler of our world, and leader of a race of bio-mechanical warriors, with which he has levelled most of Earth's major cities. As is the case in these situations, a small band of souls has formed the Midnight Resistance in order to stand up to the despot, but as is also the case in these situations, most have been killed in bloody skirmishes. Only one man survives (his brother from the two-player coin-op hasn't made it into this conversion), and he's out to finish Crimson and his forces once and for all! There are nine levels of horizontal and vertical scrolling action, blasting adversaries and collecting the keys they leave behind. At the end of each level, these keys can be traded in for bigger and better weapons, before moving on to the next bunch of psychotic cyborgs, and eventually, Crimson himself! THE GUNS FULL AUTO: Power-up for the standard rifle. 3-WAY: Same power level as the standard rifle, but fires in three directions THE KEY TO SUCCESS After torching the boss at the end of each level, you reach an armoury. The walls are lined with cabinets holding weapons, but they're all locked! If you have enough keys you can keep opening the cabinets to equip yourself with a more powerful gun, and a secondary weapon system which fires when you push up on the joypad. Here's a complete list of the items on offer: THE SECONDARY WEAPONS DDR2 FIRE: The most powerful weapon, this fries anything in its path, but the range is limited SHOTGUN: Limited in speed, but devastating in effect! NITRO: Flames spread eight ways from the top of the screen. Pretty lame. SHOWER: Drenches adver saries enemies with lethal spikes. HOMING MISSILES: When fired, eight missiles lock automatically on the nearest enemies. BULLET: 500 extra rounds for the selected weapon. BULLET UPDATE Midnight Resistance has been out for some while for the ST, Amiga, C64, Amstrad and Spectrum, courtesy of Ocean AUTO "


"REVIEW LEVELS OF RESISTANCE Midnight Resistance is set over nine explosive levels, each packed with a full complement of Crimson's biomechanoid goons from Hell! LEVEL TWO: Conveyor belts, tight crawlways, a massive tank and gun emplacements cause aggravation for our hero before he can stock up at the next armoury. LEVEL THREE: This forest level is infested with Crimson's troops and massive laser emplacements, along with an enormous laser-spewing mechanism at the end! LEVEL ONE: Simply blast away at the enemy base's entry chambers and dispose of the garrison of troops to gain access to the first armoury. LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLS SUPERCHARGER: Powers up the selected weapon to its full capabilities especially useful with the flamethrower. BARRIER: Limited shield protection. Midnight Resistance was always a blast I enjoyed in my local arcade, but I was disappointed by Ocean's computer conversions which had a very dodgy control method. This version also suffers from this same flaw, although having three buttons to control your matey (rather than just one) makes things a little easier. Graphically, Midnight Resistance is almost coin-op perfect, even down to the intro screens at the start, and the sprites and backdrops are true to their arcade counterparts. A special mention must go to the sound -excellent adrenalin-pumping soundtracks, along with some loud, raucous explosions, and if you whack in a pair of headphones and push the volume up to the max, you really do get the full effect (that's right, the effect of permanent deafness -ED). Overall, Megadrive Midnight Resistance will not only appeal to fans of the coin-op, but to all lovers of things that go boom. Check.it out immediately. ROBERT SWAN "


"ROVE MIDNIGHT RESISTANCE RESISTANCE LEVEL FIVE: Inside Crimson's base keep your eyes peeled for the deadly helicopter gunships cruising about. LEVEL FOUR: Massive tanks bristling with lasers attack in this rocky level, with aid from Crimson's airborne shocktroopers. LEVEL SIX: The rock walls peel away to reveal some formi. dable resistance-crushing weaponry! Keep an eye open for Crimson himself, who taunts you by parading his prisoners on a nearby monitor. The swine! LEVEL SEVEN: The shortest level set by the sea, a vast battleship does its utmost to blast you to kingdom come! LEVEL EIGHT: A lethal fire-spitting serpent tries to toast your buns on this hellish level. LEVEL NINE: Finally the showdown with King Crimson! This game would be great if it wasn't for one problem. I found the controls difficult to get to grips with the rotate-the-gun one especially), even though the programmers have let the player select one of four ditferent systems! Several other players in the office had similar problems and that kind of knocked the enjoy ment on the head for me. What I liked most about Midnight Resistance is that it's quite an unusual shoot 'em up for a Megadrive, ie. there are no spaceships and not hardly any multi-level parallax scrolling. That and the fact that the graphics and music are both very good indeed made this a game I came back to several times, but every time! was cursing that control methodl Lovers of the arcade game would probably have enough enthusiasm to per severe with it, but if that doesn't include you, try to have a go before spending the money. PAUL GLANCEY MIDNIGHT IN THE ARCADES Data East were the people behind the Midnight Resistance coin-op which was released early in 1990 and achieved moderate success amongst arcade players. DECO, who produced this conversion, are Data East's home conversion's division. What they haven't been able to include in the Megadrive version is the simultaneous two player mode, and they have tried to simulate the rotational joysticks (which controls the direction the player points his gun) with four different control options. One simply aims the gun in the direction the player is moving, and the others turn the B button into a cycle-through-the-eight-positions control.

As far as all you 8bit race fiends are concerned, sorry, but there are no plans for conversions to your machines. AMIGA .99 BY GREMLIN Back in the latter part of 1989, Gremlin released the original D Super Cars, a viewed-from-above race game in the mould of Super Sprint but with the added bonus of an eight-way scrolling track, a range of cars and various weapons with which to take out your opponents Now Magnetic Fields (the programmers of the orig inal and the cracking Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge) have produced this sequel. The player starts each racing season with a set amount of money, and a Super Car. Of course, winning's the name of the game but the money you make has to be spent wisely on upgrading your car and its weaponry to ensure your place in the championship.

"REVIEW SPACE PL PC .99 BY SIERRA ON-LINE Doger Wilco, sanitation expert, part-time hero, and star of the three previous Space Quest adventures is back! Having rescued The Two Guys from Andromeda (the authors of the Space Quest series) from the diabolical clutches of the Pirates of Pestu. lon, our hapless hero is out for a little Rn' R on his home planet of Xenon. The problem is this the dreaded Sequel Police have had enough of Wilco and all this Space Quest nonsense, and are delermined to make sure that Space Quest V will never see the light of day! Saved only by the timely intervention of a squad of rebels from the future, Roger finds himself hurled into a hole in the time-space continuum only to find himself on his now-devastated home planet in the scenario for Space Quest XII. Vohaul's Revenge ll! Can Roger find out who wants him dead? Will he find a way back into his own time? Will someone tell me what's going on? Who knows? Who cares? Find out, same time, same channel, next week! AND THE RIPPERS GOT THE RIGHT TIME? As someone who enjoyed the first three Space Quest games immensely, I can safely say that part four not only matches the hilarity and insanity of the series, but excels it! SQ IV is not so much an adventure, but a mass of hilarious problems which the hapless Roger Wilco has to make his way through. The VGA graphics are absolutely gorgeous, with some of the most detailed backdrops ever seen in a game of this type, and if you've got a sound card for your PC, you can really appreciate the terrific soundtracks that make SQ IV more like an interactive movie than an adventure. The sheer amount of depth is enough to have even the most experienced ad venturer stuck to his machine for ages, and the puzzles are enough to have you pulling your hair out-once you've solved one, you're confronted with another almost instantly! Quite frankly, if you're a PC owning adventure nut, then there is absolutely no excuse to go out and buy this immediately. Now you'll have to excuse me, the Sequel Police are after me again... ROBERT SWAN To get back from Space Quest XII to his rightful place in the Space Quest IV scenario, Roger is obviously going to have to find some kind of time machine, then find the required co-ordinates to zap him to the correct location in Space-Time. Luckily, if Roger can hop a shuttle to that large structure outside the city on Xenon, he will find a Timebuster 2000 SUX, and after working out that the symbols on the control pad look a bit like letters, he just has to find a likely set of six letters which the timedrive computer will accept as co-ordinates. Unfortunately, the first string of co-ordinates only gets him as lar as Space Quest XLatex Babes of Estros, where the Sequel Police will soon catch up with him. If he wants to stay alive, Roger has to find his next set of coordinates and get to the next scenario FAST! Those Sequel Police tend to shoot first and say \"halt\" later! 052 "


"QUEST IV REVIEW D525 Space Les VEU A 3-D ANIMATED ADVENTURE GAME ROGER, WILCO, AND OUT Roger Wilco's three previous adventures would be enough to drive anyone nuts, let alone the Sequel Police. The original Space Quest saw Roger, then a lowly janitor aboard the space lab Arcada, foil the evil Sariens plot to steal the Star Generator and thereby single-handedly save the planet Xenon and the entire Earnon star system from a fate worse than death. Part two saw the Sariens' leader, the vile Sludge Vohaul, intent on conquering the galaxy with an army of genetically-engineered life insurance salesmen! Again, our bumbling good guy was able to save the day (more by luck than judgment!). The third chapter, The Pirates of Pestulon, saw Roger's \"cre. ators\", the Two Guys from Andromeda, kidnapped by a band of outlaws out to flood the galaxy with a load of substandard software once again, it was down to Roger to save the day! Now Space Quest IV is here can Roger save himself? As the green slime dissolves the flesh from your bones, y think, \"Hey! This stu consumes 47 times i weight in acid!\" SP.DASPATCHA ICON-TROLS Unlike the previous Space Quest adventures, part four in volves absolutely no lyping whatsoever. Now it's just a simple case of point and click with whatever option you have selected. Pressing the right mouse button cycles through seven command icons (walk, look, action, talk, smell, laste and inventory), or you can select one directly by moving the cursor to the top of the screen. 053 "


"REVIEW SPACE QUEST IV. SPACE QUEST IV UPDATE Space Quest IV should be emerging on the Amiga and ST real soon, but no release dates or prices have been set. Be warned, though that the Amiga game requires one Megabyte of memory and two disk drives or a hard drive to run! The ST version also requires either two drives or a hard drive, but it has the added feature of being able to use any attached MIDI device to produce enhanced music. CEC... SE33ES DDDDDDDDDDAH ESSERE ACESS33 HARD DRIVIN' Unfortunately, all these luvverly graphics (which were hand-drawn then digitised, actually) take up a lot of memory and hence, disk space, so you won't be able to play Space Quest IV unless you have a hard drive in your PC! Aiee! Oh, by the way, the game supports MCGA and VGA graphics, mouse, joystick and keyboard controls, and PC, Adlib and Roland sound. Just thought we'd better give you all the facts. Unlike Rob, I've never really been a big fan of the Sierra adventures because of the rather ugly graphics and those annoying guide-theman-through-the-maze-of-t ight-gaps bits. However Space Quest IV is one of Sierra's new-look games so it certainly doesn't suffer from any ugliness problems (if you've a VGA card the digitised graphics are superb) and the mazes I came across weren't as intolerably difficult as they were before so I really enjoyed myself. The other attraction is the unusual storyline, the jokey scenarios and the oddball predicaments which are actually pretty funny, and keep you playing the game just to see where the next laugh is. The new command system is, I suppose, less daunting to a novice than the old text-entry system, but seven icons seemed pretty restrictive to me, and it reminded me somewhat of all those old text adventures with tiny vocabularies which forced the player to word commands strangely so that the computer could understand. The system Lucasfilm used in Indiana Jones and Monkey Island is far more flexible. That gripe aside, I was very impressed with Space Quest IV, and I'm sure any Wilco fans out there won't be disappointed by this installment in the series.

"REVIEW SUPER FAMICOM .00 BY TAITO  A Vicious alien empire, armed to the teeth and out for blood, has invaded our system. Earth Defence, in a last-ditch attempt to protect our beleaguered and battered world, has created the Da. rius starfighter . a super-fast vessel with the latest developments in combat firepower. All that's needed is a pilot brave (or mad) enough to fly it, so guess who's just about to get their call-up, papers? Either one or two pilots (you can both play simultaneously) blast their way through twelve increasingly difficult alien-infested levels, in an attempt to reach the vile alien leader and utterly destroy him The usual mixture of power-ups are available (more on that later), but the malevolent xenomorphs are out to make sure that nothing on Earth will survive the coming conflict... THE FUTURE OF SPACE ENFORCEMENT When a set of six \"box\" aliens are destroyed, a crystal is left behind. The Darius fighters collect these to enhance their firepower in the following ways: RED CRYSTAL: Increases forward firepower, from the initial weedy popgun, up to a massive, energy-ball spewing cannon! BLUE CRYSTAL: Bestows the ship with a protective energy field, which can be made more powerful with more crystals. GREEN CRYSTAL: Increases secondary weapon's firepower, from a single missile to four-way lasers up to massive energy blasters! YELLOW CRYSTAL Acts as a smart-bomb, annihilating everything on screen! UPDATE Darius has already appeared (in one form or another) for most machines; the rather dull Darius Plus (from The Edge) for 16-bits, Darius (also from the Edge) for the 8-bits, Taito's own conversions of Darius on both CDROM and cart for the PC Engine, and Darius 2 for the Megadrivel Phew! Although I enjoyed playing the coin-op, Darius never really had anything (apart from the three screens) to make it stick out from the rest of the crowd. Darius Twin is okay as blasters go, with some excellent graphics (the end-of-level monsters are as exquisite as their arcade counterparts), and the sound is enough to have any shoot 'em up freak gibbering like a loon, with lots of rough and raucous explosions. The only problem is the game itself even on a difficult level, it doesn't take long to get right to the end. If you just can't wait for a shoot 'em up on the Super Famicom, try it out but if I were you, I'd keep my money safe, and wait for Super R-Type. ROBERT 056 SWAN "


"REVIEW THE BOSS FROM 20,000 FATHOMS At the end of each stage, the giant end-of-level guardian emerges emerge, intent on the Darius fighter's utter destruc tion. The funny thing is, each has the most ridiculous name imaginable! These include the Dual Shears SP (a giant mechanical lobster), Killer Hagia, (a large metal fish), and Dark Coronatus (a deadly robo-sea lion)! Of course, given enough firepower, these can be done away with... GAME 261208 THANKS Thanks to ConsoleConcepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the cartridge used in this review. Everyone was disappointed with Darius Twin when it first arrived in the CVG office. The graphics and sound are both excellent (as usual for the Super Famicom), but it's gameplay that's important in making a shoot 'em up stand out from the ordinary. It's in this sense that Darius Twin fails. The same old enemy attack patterns coupled with the end-of-level bosses combine to make a game that simply doesn't excite. The power-ups give the player no real sense of destructive prowess either. What Darius does have in its favour is the excellent simultaneous two-player mode, which no other Super Famicom title has. Some degree of strategy is required to decide which power-ups are better suited to which players and co-operation is essentail for success. If you want a two-player blast, then this is probably the best seen outside of an arcade. Solo shoot 'em ups fans should save their money, though.

"REVIEW ST AMIGA AMSTRAD SPECTRUM BY KRISALIS .53 .53 .23 .23 SRA ahanghir Khan, world champion in the sport of squash six times, has lent his name to this, a simulation of the most exhausting of ball sports. Squash offers the chance to play one or two players, or simply sit back and spectate. There are two types of play, the Club Tournament (league), or the World Championship (knockout). The former is organised as a series of up to 8 \"rungs\", with each rung containing four to six players. At the end of the league, the top two players are promoted, the bottom two relegated to the next rung down. The World Championship is simply a case of defeating each opponent in order to make it to the Final and take the trophy! JAHANGIR WHO? One of the world's most successful sportsmen, Khan has been World Squash Champion six times, and winner of nin successive British open squash titles. Born in Karachi, Pal istan in December 1963, Khan learned to play squash at age of seven a natural step for the son of a former British champion, Rossan Khan, who took the title in 1957. At the age of 15, Khan won the World Amateur Squash Championships, and at 17 became the youngest ever professional World Champion. Since then, he has wo every squash title in the world, and over a six year period played in over 500 in ternational matches witho a defeat! To this day this re mains an achievement unique in world sport. ANGIR KHAN Champion22 PT SQUASHTHE RULES The rules of squash are reasonably simple the court is rectangular, with the back half divided into two areas. In this half are the two service boxes, where each player stands whilst serving the ball. The wall at the front is marked with a horizontal line (known as the \"cut\"), with another line just above the floor (the \"board\"), and below this is the \"tin\". When the ball is served, the ball must bounce off the wall, above the cut, before landing in the opponent's half of the court. The ball can bounce any number of times off any walls before or after hitting the end wall. But it can only bounce once on the floor before being returned. A rally is won if the ball bounces more than once on the floor before your opponent can return it, or if they fail to hit the end wall in the required area. Service is awarded to the rally winner, or if they're serving already. they get a point. The first one to 9 points wins. Easy, eh? HHHHHH TT IS V Someone looks happy. SERVES Having played squash a few times (don't laugh!), I can tell you that there's one word to describe the sport knackering! Anyway, Jahangir Khan's Squash is certainly an accurate simulation of the sport you have to wrench the stick like crazy in order to get to the ball. In fact, the first few games may be quite off-putting, due to the amount of effort required just to hit the ball, but practice makes perfect, and with a few games under your belt, you'll soon be getting into the swing of things. The match itself is extremely competitive, and exciting in one or two player modes. The number of options available is very impressive, making it a game you can come back to for quite a while. If you're a fan of the sport, or just after something a little different, then you'd be well advised to have a peek. ROBERT SWAN El BT 060 "


"REVIEW has of nine Pakn at the British X Here's the main selection screen. Nice, isn't it? won quash at 17 That's a V nice shirt ever amas won I've never actually played Squash, but after playing this game it's hardly surprisIng that it's an after-hours favourite of hard-dealing businessmen. It's extremely competitive and the speed of the game makes each match a frenzy of action. The control system takes some time to get used to, and I spent an inept few games running after the ball and swiping at it when I was in the wrong place. However, I quickly learned the skill of hitting the ball so that it bounces around, but never actually straight at the opponent. As usual, playing against another person is preferable to the computer opponents, but having said that, the computer's players are pretty good and even though they vary in skill (they're modeled on professional players) even the weakest can give the novice a run for his money. An unusual but well-executed sports game. PAUL GLANCEY wear 500 inwithout mis reEL ROBBO N VARL FOLLES A A nice collection of trophies.

"Richard Pascoe and Paul Sargent from Colchester (where I do a lot of my shopping) win my special tips prize of .00 for this large amount of LEMMING AID (their joke, not mine). If you reckon you can come up with anything worthy of .00, send it in. You might be lucky. So, erm... let's get on with it. LEM PAWS FOR THOUGHT The pause key is your best ally in Lemmings (make sure you use the P key and not the PAWS icon). You can still select Icons and reposition your cursor on any Lemming that may be in trouble. Unpause and you're away! CLIMBING AND FLOATING For CLIMBERS and FLOATERS click as far in advance as possible, because when they're moving or falling they're a tad hard to select. As you will no doubt know from the manual, CLIMBERS and FLOATERS cannot be changed, unless one Lemming owns both of these attributes. He's an ATHLETE. These guys are \"rock hard\". BUT, If you can only create one ATHLETE send him over the block and make him build into any stationary Item. When he hits the object, he'll turn around and dig through. If it looks like he'll hit the exit make him build over ithis time for freedom will come (maybe)! DANGEROUS SITUATIONS So what do you do when you're at the wrong end of a one-way diggable block? Simply make two ATHLETES. Make the first one a BLOCKER. This'll turn the second one around, and he'll dig through. You are building up to the door of freedom and you suddenly hear the cry of anguish. Those Lemmings, bless their hearts, can't fall too far. Simply build another ladder parallel to the first as shown. Easy when you know how! | | | | "


"MIAAID SO If possible you should avoid traps (although only after one Lemming's bit the dust), but if you can't then here is a tip. The observant amongst you will notice that Lemmings are killed one at a time, so compact them into what looks like only a few Lemmings using a BLOCKER or two and only a few are You might just want to slow down the Lemmings whilst one suicidal maniac builds the path to safety. Digging in a variety of ways does this. When falling a long way, make sure there's a step for the Lemming to land on. This way the poor little blighters won't fall too far. lost. All your Lemmings are walking forwards towards a quick dip in the lava but you haven't got a BLOCKER! Argghh! One could build over it, but it's not quick enough and the other perish! To solve this problem, get one to build and another to dig (and when deep enough, build). This makes a pit that will save your Lemmings! Finally, if you need to get past a BLOCKER then you can build over him or blow him up. Another method (especially if you need 100%) is to dig away from under him. This makes him a WALKER again. Good eh? AAAAAAAA "

"NINTENDO GOLDEN AXE Still riding high in the charts and it's been out nearly a year! Lee Hayes has revealed another in a long line of cheats. When you die, press both fire buttons as if you were using magic, and as if by magic, you can carry on where you left off! TETRIS On game type A, just as a block is about to land, hold down SELECT until you've heard the thud as it hits the blocks. Just for that you'll get a gargantuan 10,000 points! On game type B following the same procedure produces the word \"SUCCESS!\", which means you don't have to get all 25 lines. Mark Woods from Clwyd came up with that. Ever been in that situation where you need one of those stick like straight blocks but the game refuses to \"give you one\" (as the saying goes). Well, D Bedford from Australia says you should pause the game and press UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT. B. and A. A long stick-like block is now yours for the taking. The problem is, you only get one per level GAME BOY Tota\" \"16746 SUPER MARIO LAND Riaz Pathai from Stevenage sent in three helpful tips for this excellent Gameboy cart. Take it away, Riaz! 1. Before entering a pipe, collect all the coins on the screen, When you come up again all the icons will be replaced! 2. At the end of the Birabuto Kingdom you will meet King TO tomesu (Riaz describes him as, and I quote, \"a poncey lion that jumps up and down spitting fireballs\". Charming en?). TO destroy him, jump over him when he's on the ground and 11 you have a Superball Mario turn around and tire. If you haven i gol Superballs just jump on the lever and blow him up that way 3. When you reach the end of the Muda kingdom you face up, to Dragonzamasu. This is easy. When he is up, destroy the blocks at the bottom right corner of the screen. Once you have done that go up to the lever and touch it. BOOM!!! Ghitam MEGADRIVE GHOST 'N' GOBLINS Jonathon Carr from Solihull sent in these codes to enable you to start on any level you wish. Hold down RIGHT and push B three times. Then push UP and then press B three times. Push LEFT and push B three times. Finally, push DOWN and press B three times. Now just push START and you're away! Hurrah! ESWAT On the mission start screen where you see your adversary for the mission hold down A. B, and C and press down on the joy, pad This accesses the round select screen where you can se lect any mission by moving left or right. The only problem is, you have to complete the game first! Nice one, Neil Collman from Hemel Hempstead. PAUSE SEGA COLORIERBEGEE LORD OF THE SWORD If cunning double bluffs are your game take a look at this tip from David Clough of Australia. If a snake, vermin, giant spider, centipede, eyeball or straw fly crosses your path, just run away until the creature is off the screen. Retrace your steps and the creature will have gone! Worral has come up with this tip to help you out if you're having a problem gaining some ground. First of all, before you even turn the power on, put the cart in and hold down both buttons on your joypad. Turn on your Sega and immediately push up on your pad. The game will appear to start as normal, but then the screen will blank and the Special Mode will be activated. This enables you to se lect any stage and play the game with infinite lives! Cor! DARIUS 2 We thought this was pretty duff when we first saw it, but a couple of months on, it's beginning to grow on us. Jonathon Breaks from Arthington provided this comprehensive set of cheats (that we saw a few weeks ago in a Japanese mag). Invincibility can be yours can by pressing A, B, A, C, B, C, C, B. C. A. B. A on the title screen. The words NO-HIT should ap. pear. Infinite continues are yours by pressing B, B, C, A, A. A, B, B. C.C.C. The words FREE PLAY should appear. For the SPECIAL MODE (this lets you fight all of the guardians one after the other) press C twelve times!

"AMIGA BYTESIZEH Biffa Bacon, Buster Gonad and loads of other familiar faces make their way into this month's Bytesize. Our not to get too close to Bertie Blunt's parrot... VIRGIN GAMES .99 It states quite clearly on the box that you'll never play'a bigger load of crap'. Well, Viz isn't that bad, but it's not far off it. The graphics and sound are good, but the different events which make up the game are very basic, and the only possible attraction is the sniggervalue of the (sometimes filthy) comments from Roger Mellie, et al. If you're old enough to buy the game, you'd get more laughs by spending the  on a subscription to the comic and a couple of pairs of boxer shorts instead. OVERALL 59% PLESNE 10 INE HIGHLIGHT OF * COMENTATING 27 @CONAD 175m INTERNATIONAL ICE HOCKEY IMPULZE .99 Keep on pucking with this not-too-bad-actually Ice Hockey game, featuring single and dual player modes, pretty decent graphics, and lots of sampled speech. The only real problem is the finicky control method which does take a heck of a lot of getting used to. Fans of the sport, check it out why don't you? OVERALL 77% MONSTER PACK 1 PSYGNOSIS .99 This pack-o'-three contains Nitro (good), Infestation (not quite so good), and the infamous Shadow of the Beast (which is pretty but boring). The games aren't exactly outstanding, but for less than  this compilation is well worth a look if you haven't got the titles already. OVERALL 79% ...NEWS FLASH... ...By the time you read this Domark's strategy epic, 'Nam should be out and about. In it your task as either a combat soldier or President of the United States is to change history by winning both the war and the favour of the American people... SKULL AND CROSSBONES DOMARK/TENGEN .99 The Amiga conversion of Atari's buccaneering coin-op is no better than the ST one. But then the arcade game was no classic so this further demonstrates that you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Pirate-lovers may see the attraction, but others would probably prefer to feed it to the sharks. OVERALL 57% ...Wing Commander, the spectacular space combat sim from Origin, is in the process of being converted to the Amiga for release some time later this year. The PC version was only worth playing on machines twice as fast and with twice as much memory as the Amiga, so we can only ponder on the potential of the conversion. What will they have to cut out? Or are the Origin programmers such a talented bunch that they can cram the whole game in? As soon as we know, you will too... THE FAMOUS FIVE ENIGMA VARIATIONS .99 Enid Blyton's foursome of annoying brats and their dog aren't really the most inspiring characters to turn into a computer game. However, if you're very generous and have a little brother or sister or something who is actually into 'The Five\", this type-in graphic adventure might make a good birthday present. OVERALL 70% 2016 prpartent of a stean train. sitting on very plush seats in here. here, carrying some sandwiches. at dick "


"BYTESIZE ATARI ST Toilet humour, coin-op clones and conversions, futuristic action, the Vietnam War Robert Swan takes a look at the latest Bytesized bundle to hit the ST, and wonders where it'll all end stuck in the U-bend, perhaps? VIZ VIRGIN GAMES .99 Almost identical to the Amiga version, ST Viz is okay in the audio-visual departments, but a bit yawnsome as far as gameplay is concerned. Diehard Viz fans might love it, but as with the other versions, this isn't half as entertaining as a copy of the mag of the same name. OVERALL 59% CHOOSE YOUR PLAYE .99 SKULL AND CROSSBONES DISC LORICIEL Hands up, all that remember the old Discs of Tron coin-op? Well, Disc is practically identical to it in most respects simply try to de stroy your enemy by hitting him with a disc! Anyone yearning for nostalgia will enjoy this but, alas, not for long. OVERALL 74% DOMARK/TENGEN .99 The totally abysmal STUN Runner conversions blotted Domark's Tengen copybook, and this one doesn't clear up the mess. poorly animated sprites, awful sound, and little or no gameplay whatsoever. Leave it alone, unless you're mad. OVERALL 57% ...NEWS FLASH.. Coming soon to an ST near you, courtesy of Entertainment International Volfled, a conversion of a little-known Taito coin-op, which involves flying around a screen full of aliens, covering up parts of the screen as you go, a la Qix. The PC Engine and Megadrive versions were a hoot, so the ST game should be a real doozy... MASTERBLAZER RAINBOW ARTS .99 The Amiga version got a very healthy 89% back in issue 110, and I'm happy to say that the ST version is just as colourful (well, almost), playable and addictive. Gamers with a taste for hard 'n' fast action would be well-advised to add this to their collection. OVERALL 89% NAM 1965-1975 DOMARK .99 Out of all the Vietnam games ever made, this has to be the most complex of all. With detailed maps and a massive number of tactical options, and the option to become two of America's presidents (not at the same time, mind), this is a must for all lovers of military strategy even if it is a trifle expensive. OVERALL 90% Core Design are busy beavering away at the moment on their first flight sim, AH-73M Thunderhawk, based upon a fictitious combat chopper. Also on the boards is Warzone, a two-player blast in the Commando mould.. 2:00: Psygnosis are about to unleash the ST version of their graphically stunning Awesome, Apart from a small loss of speed, and the obligatory colour and sound differences, ST Awesome should be just as smart as the Amiga version.. 080 "

"REVIEW .99 SEGA BY US GOLD If you like a bit of golfing action but don't fancy all the exertion of I walking around a massive 18-hole course, then this Sega version of the classic World Class Leaderboard could well be the one for you. The aim of the game is remarkably simple. Just drive the little white ball down the fairway, and use your skill and judgement to putt the ball into the hole at the centre of the green. Up to four players can take part, and the winner is the person who takes the least shots to put the ball in the \"cup\". Each hole has a par limit and this is the recommended number of shots needed. Beat this limit and you're obviously pretty hot (or lucky). All of the golfing rules and action have been incorporated into this Sega cart, and there are four massive courses to test your skills against. Expect glory everlasting should you succeed. On the other hand, your Sega has been programmed with loads of intimidating sampled speech should you make a complete pig's ear of it. FORE-PLAY If you're a bit wet behind the ears when it comes to teeing off, and putting the little white ball into the hole, then your best bet is to use the practice options. Il whacking the ball a great distance is a bit of a problem for you, the driving range, should be your first port-of-call. Should you be a bit oi a qui fer with the old putter, the putting green is the place to be, Altacking the hole from various angles enables golfers to build up an understanding of how a sloping green affects your shot. SKILLFUL COURSES Four 18-hole courses are included in this cart. Three of them are based on courses located around the globe. The fourth is The Gauntlet a course specially designed by the Access programmers, and criminy, it's tough. ST ANDREWS: Take a trip to Scotland and have a few rounds on one of the world's most famous courses. This is probably the easiest course in the game, with little in the way of trees or lakes to get in the way DORAL: Doral is a potentially terrifying course, with loads of trees and large bunkers hampering your progress. It's a good thing the par limits are pretty easy to beat. Golfamania was quite a nice golf game for the Master System, but it's nothing compared to World Class Leaderboard! The game oozes quality from the word go with nice presentation screens, and a fair few options. The game proper is better still with excellent animation, very detailed backdrops and some of the best sound on the Sega. The spot effects have been sampled, and Tiertex (the programmers) have even added in some sampled speech (prompted only by your golfing ineptitude!). A fierce competitive spirit is induced when you invite a few more players to share a round and the four courses offer more than enough in the way of lastability, If you're on the lookout for the best Sega golf game, look no further. World Class Leaderboard is it. CYPRESS CREEK: The pleasant greenery turns out to be a golfer's worst nightmare at Cypress Creek. The low bushes don't really cause much of a problem, but there's loads of high trees that cause plenty of problems. A real expert's course. THE GAUNTLET: The Gauntlet is only recommended to golfing stars who can handle the preceding courses with ease. Probably the most demanding set of 18 holes ever created for a computer golf game. RICHARD LEADBETTER 086 "


"REVIEW DORAL udd Class EADER OARD CLUBBED SENSELESS Every golfer carries a number of clubs around in his caddy bag. They vary in length, and in the shape of the heads, give ing them different distance capabilities. The distance to the green is always displayed and by using your own calcula tions (or the chart supplied), you then judge which club to use. On novice level, the computer caddy chooses the best club for you. SCORES E MOM LEADERBOARD: A HISTORY Leaderboard first appeared on the C64 way back in 1986, where the computer world was amazed by the realistic 3D graphics and the fact that it played a damned good game of golf, too. All it lacked were obstacles such as trees and sand-traps, but the original was soon followed by the Leaderboard Tournament Edition which added those details to the courses. The Sega version is based on the most recent Leaderboard game, World Class Leaderboard, which featured the same four courses. 231 YDS CLUB SH EUNCH POHER + NOOEE 087 "


"REVIEW WORLD CLASS LEADERBOARD WORLD CLASS PLAYER GAUNTLE FARE 32 SCORES ISP UPDATE World Class Leaderboard has been out on the 8-bit budget labels for quite a while now and is highly recommended. The same goes for 16-bit Leaderboard, although golfing Amiga fans should go for PGA Tour Golf for the best digital rounds of golf. DEDDIEL 47 YDS DO ELNEH PH 160 YDS EINEN 61 POWER DIEE Leaderboard is an outstanding golf game, easily surpassing the standards set by Great Golf and Golfamania. The crisp graphics and sampled sound are both excellent, and the control method is superb easy to get to grips with, but subtle enough to allow experts to Swerve the ball left or right. The courses are very challenging especially the Gauntlet and it certainly takes a lot of practice before you get around on par. The great thing about Leaderboard is that unlike most games which lose their appeal once they're finished, you go back to this one time and time again to see whether you can beat your course record! So if you're after a high quality sports game with masses of lasting appeal, make sure you take a good look at this!

"REVIEW AMIGA BY GREMLIN .99 It is two hundred years since Hiro, last of the Bladeknights, rebuilt the shattered Fireblade and defeated the evil Havok and his Undercity minions, thereby restoring peace to the cyberworld of Thraxx. Life went on as before with the people safe in the knowledge that Havok and his forces of darkness were dead and gone forever. Or so they thought. Now, two centuries later, the evil one has resurfaced, and once again shattered the powerful Fireblade, scattering it over the planet's surface. Hiro's great-great-grandson, a Bladeknight in train ing, has taken it onto himself to follow in his ancestor's footsteps, defeat Havok and free Thraxx from his insidious grasp once and for all! LI 00 HI 036050 INSTRUMENTS OF DESTRUCTION Our hero has quite an arsenal at his disposal. To begin with, he can only slash at enemies with his blade, but along the way, the following weapons can be collected or purchased from a shop: PLASMA GUN: Fires single bursts of destructive energy FLAME THROWER: Emits a powerful burst of napalm death, frying anything in its BEAM LASER: Fires a searing laser bolt which annihilates everything in its path. Slow fire rate, though. path The depth and sheer addictiveness of the original made it an instant classic, and Switchblade 2 automatically falls into the same category. The first thing that grabs you by the throat is the stunning consolesque graphics beautifully designed sprites blast around the screen at a hectic pace, in front of some of the most superlative backdrops yet seen in a game of this type. The sound's nothing to sneeze at either, with lots of loud sampled explosions and blasts it's enough to make you turn down the TV to save your battered eardrums! And Switchblade 2 is definitely no one weekend wonder. The sheer size of the game ensures that even the most battlehardened gamester will have more than enough to deal with, and the whole thing's so addictive, you won't want to play anything else. If you're a fan of the original, or enjoy an excellent mixture of exploration and blasting, then there is no alternative Switchblade 2 is a must. Buy it now, or forever hold your head in shame! ROBERT SWAN SPIN BLADES: One of the faster weapons, this lets you hurl deadly throwing stars at anything stupid enough to get in the way HOMING MISSILES: Lock in on any enemies in the vicinity and destroys them all. Definitely the most useful weapon but not easy to come by. "


"IREVIEW DS25 UPDATE Switchblade 2 will be hacking onto the ST real soon, for the same sum of .99.

DITT LIT D DICI DE A lot of people said that the original Switchblade was rather too similar to Rick Dangerous for its own good. I actually thought it was a whole lot better. The platform puzzles relied more on skill than luck and the emphasis was on the arcade action. The same can be said of this superlative sequel. The blasting action is pretty enjoyable and there's some really devious puzzles thrown in for good measure. My only whinge is that there isn't really enough enemy sprites on-screen at once and the power of the weapons is toned down accordingly. In its favour, Switchblade 2 has some superb graphics and super-smooth scrolling and all of the levels are huge, with some secret rooms as well! I would've liked to see a bit more in the way of reaction-testing but as it stands, Switchblade 2 is an essential purchase for arcade adventure fanatics, with bags of lasting appeal.

"REVIEW PC ENGINE .00 BY MASIYA Enter the road warriors! A/elcome to the future of road racing, with the Motoroader 2000 V World Tournament. The aim of the game is simple win by whatever means possible! Of course, this isn't all as easy as it sounds you have the choice of three vehicles to race with; a ground car (which is nippy. but not too rugged), a tank (heavily armoured, but slow and difficult to manoeuvre), or a hovercar (which floats above the other ve hicles, but is even more difficult to control). These difficulties can be easily overcome by buying better parts for your vehicle if you can afford it! To earn prize money, you need to complete each treacherous course in one piece (how much you win depends on your final position). Of course, the other drivers have the same ambition, and they'll bump or shoot you off the track given half the chance, leaving your vehicle a smoking ruin in the gutter. Every time your car is left be hind it has to be flown back into the thick of the action, using up some of your precious supply of fuel. If this runs out, you're out of the race. Up to five players can take part (with a Multi-Tap and enough controllers), so get out there and burn rubber (or something like that)! WE'RE THE BOYS TO TRUST Don't bother taking your racer round to Kwik-Fiteach vehicle can be enhanced in the pits, but only you've got the ready cash is pay for it! There are three grades of equipment, which in practical terms, means that it isn't wise to race with a weak grade one engine under the bonnet of a large grade three bonnet. Similar ly, it would be difficult to co trol a car with a grade three engine and grade one tyres TYRES: Increases your ve hicle's road-holding capabilities. On a hovercraft, the equivalent pieces of equip ELE HOVER ment are different types of fan. ENGINES: More expensive engines are more powerful and hence make your ve. hicle faster. No surprises there. BODY: Each body makes the vehicle selected that bi more sturdy, so it'll take more knocks before becom ing scrap ironl Also, more e pensive bodies are more streamlined, providing an edge in the speed stakes. You can sell unwanted parts as well, but just remember because they're now second hand, you won't get as much money for them! The racers line up for the of There are quite a few PC Engine race games of this format, but Motoroader 2 is definitely one of the few that is worth getting. Handling the cars is a little tricky to get to grips with the hovercar is particularly tough to handle) but perseverance is the name of the game, and with a little practice, you'll be hacking around the treacherous circuits like a seasoned pro. The add-on parts make things that bit more entertaining, not to mention frustrating there's nothing more annoying than having another player come up behind and blast you in the reari Overall, a highly-charged, not to mention highly competetive game that's enjoyable and fun to play and that's what counts.

"MOTOROADER II The cars jostle around the track. ESPEROUP IROTE HOWER HANDLE OPTION-1 OPTION-2 EXIT NITRO: Gives a single burst of acceleration, to help take you to the front of the pack. WING: Similar to the Hopper, this allows short bursts of flight to take you over the rest of the field. OIL: Straight out of James Bond, this spills oil puddles onto the track, sending anyone behind you out of control! DRILL: Spinning spikes appear from your hub caps to scrape the fancy paintwork on those other cars. FREEZE: Brel This icy blast freezes the steering controls of other racers. BOMBER: Releases landmines on to the track When another racer hits one, BOOM! CANNON: This front mounted machine gun allows you to spray the opposition with molten lead! LASER: Another handy weapon with which you can blast the others and it does a lot of damage! MISSILE: Depending upon where the other racers are, missiles will fly from the front, side or rear. DEF HENRIN MISSILE 12222232 Check out the stats here. Missiles away! I really went a bundle on the original Motoroader it was definitely one of the best games to buy if you had a joypad tap. At first I wasn't too excited by this sequel because apart from the graphical changes, there were no vast improvements. However, a few games were all it took to change my opinion, and I find the action as enjoyable as ever. The choice of different vehicles adds less to the game than you might expect because the hovercar and the tank don't have many advantages over the car. It's the extra weapons that spice the game up a lot that, and the multi-player option which bumps up the fun factor about twentyfold. Zapping two human co-racers with a laser or zipping over them with wings spread is just great, so, like I said, if you've got a multi-tap and a bunch of mates to play against, this is a game you must buy.

"REVIEW SUPER FAMICOM .99 BY BANDAI tra-Man is a strange metallic creature from the planet M-27 whose sole purpose in life involves protecting innocent lifeforms from lowering hostile creatures intent on world domination, He has one infallible method for dealing with these beasts. Relying on his powerful lists, feet and magic, he simply beats the seven, shades out of his assailants until they finally bite the dust, There are ten adversaries for Ultra-Man to annihilate and none, of them are less than fifty feet tall! All of these monstrous demons have their own methods of attack, including fire-breathing, lasers and good old fisticuffs. However, later demons are a bit more cun ning in their approach, using magic to do over our metallic hero When our hero eventually conquers each toe they can only be i nally despatched with the aid of the most potent magic that Ultra Man has available... THANKS Thanks to ConsoleConcepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the cartridge used in this review. ULTRA-TACKY Ultra-Man is the star of many cheap B-movies fom Japan and secured himself a cult following in Far Eastern shores. One of his films was shown in a recent Channel Four cheapo movie season. But did you know that UltraMan is in fact a member of the Ultra-7, a band of dogooders intent on ridding the cosmos of everything evil? Each member of this Ultra family has its own Ultrapowers, and this Super Famicom game replicates all of Ultra-Man's powers. Good eh? Ultra-Man is not going to win any prizes for using the Super Famicom's advanced hardware. The sprites are large and well-animated, but even the PC Engine has matched this (remember Drunken Master?). The parallax backdrops are quite nice, but not spectacular. The sound is great, with bizarre Japanese-style melodies that suit the B-movie atmosphere perfectly and there's some excellent effects too. All of the monsters make their own individual noises, and Ultra-Man's chest panel starts beeping alarmingly when time starts running out (and his chest light flashes too!). The beat 'em up gameplay is pretty simplistic, but it's very enjoyable and addictive. Throwing all manner of prehistoric beasts around the screen has never been so much fun! Although the action becomes a stale after quite a while, Ultra-Man is well worth looking up. However, if you're after the ultimate beat 'em up, Final Fight still rules without a shadow a doubt.

"REVIEW 255 DNS1 ULTRA-VIOLENCE As well as having fists and feet of steel, Ultra-Man has five different types of magic at his disposal. Simply wait until the required power level is reached, and then press the backright button to select a power. The green button on your Famicom joypad activates it. SUPER LASER One point from Ultra-Man's magic fingers results in these laser bolts being fired. Not that powerful though. LASER HOOPS Far more powerful than the Super Laser, but this weapon uses a lot more energy. LASER SAW-BLADES Yikes! A powerful saw blade is thrown at the foe, and boy, does this cause damage! SUPER BOLTS These powerful bolts can reduce the enemy energy bar in seconds, and are also used to finish off the enemy and move on to the next level. SHIELD Use this to halt your enemies' blows and reflect back their lasers or fire. An essential aid in later levels. Ultra-Man has a bit of a job deciding which Baltan to attack first. Oh dear. GOMORAH Yet another dinosaur decendant and like LED King. Gomorah swings his tail at Ultraman, but he also wraps it around his foe to squeeze the life out of his circuits! Eep! ALIEN MELIYAH This foureyed monster has the same abilities as Ultraman, and can even use the same magical weapons! Meliyah cannot be killed, but once beaten he escapes, warning Ultraman that now he's really in trouble! GERONIMONA brightly-coloured lizard beast, Geronimon can send Ultraman reeling with his Earthquake Waves, and shoots poisonous spines from his back! Z-TON Not even Ultraman's most powerful magic can de stroy this mightiest of monULTRA-HEAVIES Ultra-Man has ten heavies (Telesdon weighs 120.000 tons! to deal with in the game, all of which he's done battle with in his movies, and they are... BEMULAR This GodzillaSTAGE 02 alike breathes fire, but is the JERES weakest brute in the whole game. Easy! TELESDON Another dinosaur descendant, this guys combines fire-breating with a HEIGHT: lethal line in head butts. Ouch! JAMYRA Lethal claws and a vicious kick combine to make this guy Ultra-Man's first real problem BULLTON This strange spikey spheroid fires out strength-sapping energy bolts and floor-hugging fireballs at our silver-eyed hero. Tough with a capital T. LED KING Mistakenly dubbed Red King in the game, this jumped-up slug from outer space is even more powerful than the mighty Bullion, He's one of scariest things yet seen in a rubber suit. ALIEN BALTAN As well as shooting fireballs from his claws, this guy projects hologramatic images of himself anywhere he pleases, so KARTISTS After the initial batch of superb Super Famicom releases, we seem to have come to the more mediocre stuff. Ultraman is one of the most entertaining titles in the recent bunch, but it's not one of those games that persuades you to buy the machine. The monster sprites are nicely animated, and are very accurate to the original characters the dinosaurs even look like they're men in rubber suits! The sound effects are good too, but the tunes are really corny and naff. Ultraman's only real weakness is that the gameplay is rather limited and not at all fancy. Once you've fought your'way past Z-Ton, there's no real compulsion to play it again, so unless you're a major beat 'em up fan who already owns Final Fight (or indeed an Ultraman fan, though that seems unlikely), you'd be better off saving your money for Super R-Type.

"S25 REVIEW .99 BY VELOCITY/US GOLD man F-14 TOMCAT There can't be an Amiga owner who hasn't heard of F/A-18 Interceptor. You haven't? Where have you been? Interceptor was the first Amiga flight sim which was more of a game than a simulation, and it was also notable for the fact that it was the first flight sim in which the \"pilot\" could view the action from outside the plane. Anyway, Interceptor was converted onto the PC and released as Jet Fighter, but it was only ever available on import. Jet Fighter Il is, not surprisingly, the sequel, and is being distributed by US Gold, so it should be much easier to get hold of. Jet Fighter 2 is pretty similar to Jetfighter, featuring the F/A 18 based around the fictional Northrop F-23D Advanced Tactical Fighter, nicknamed the Black Widow. This amazing supersonic stealth fighter-bomber has a top speed of Mach 1.5, and can literally fly circles around enemy aircraft. If you feel that all this is a little too much, you can always choose to fly a Grumman F-14 Tomcat, a General Dynamics F-16 Falcon or instead. Each mission involves the pilot taking his selected aircraft into the wild blue yonder over the west coast of the USA (which has been invaded by terrorists, believe it or not) and eventually blowing the heck out of something. Ground bases, SAM sites, tactical targets, convoys, enemy patrols and MiG fighters all come in for a pounding! Once the primary and secondary target have been eliminated, it's back to a friendly airbase in time for a cold one... 14 675 NDER Range Multi-Role AR HENS THE NORTHROP F-23D ATF This brand new aircraft is as deadly in action as in looks extremely agile in high-g flight, capable of speeds up to MACH 3, and coated with the same radar absorbent materials as the F-117A Stealth Fighter. A US Navy aircraft, the F-23D is fully enabled to launch and land aboard sea-based carriers, and is equipped with a General Electric F-120 engine capable of 35,000 pounds of thrust! Add to that all manner of Sidewinders, AMRAAMS and other air/air and air/surface missiles, and you've got yoursell one deadly plane! For once in my life, I'm lost for words! Why I enjoy flight sims so much is the feeling of being there, and in that respect, this has to be one of the most outstanding simulations ever seen. Jet Fighter 2's 3D graphics are slick and very realistic, and the sheer attention to detail is incredible especially the shaded VGA horizons when you're flying a night mission! The sounds that emerge from an AdLib card are pretty damned good, too, and only serve to enhance the game further. In fact, the amount of missions and options available is enough to have flight 'n' fight fans reduced to a gibbering wreck! If you're the proud owner of a suitably powerful PC then you couldn't do better than to take this out for a test flight. Now I've got absolutely no excuse not to go out and buy a fast PC...

"REVIEW JETFIGHTER 2 JETFIGHTER 2 EJECTION PROBLEMS Another feature which is rarely found in other simulators is soon as the a crash seems imminent, hit CTRL and E, and the cockpit suddenly drops away as the plane plummets to the earth. You can then switch to an external view and watch yourself floating gracefully down on your parachute A ZOOM WITH A VIEW Like it's predecessor, and many other recent flight sims, Jet Fighter 2 doesn't limit the player to a straight-ahead view from the pilot's seal. From the cockpit, you can pan the view and look directly past the tail of the aircraft, and if you hit the key on the keypad, the view switches to an absolutely any-anole external view, with zoom control. There are also options for a view from the control tower at the airstrip where you took off, and if you have a missile in the air, you can watch it streak toward its target! I like having a nice big PC on my desk, because I can crack the whip at my lackeys and when nobody's watching I can have a go at a fab flight sim like this. Amiga Interceptor was a game I liked because it was spectacular without being complex to play, and this updated version is similar in that respect. It's dead easy to get into, and easy to get a lot out of. Unlike Interceptor, there are more than five missions to play a lot more! In fact there are about 130 different sorties to fly, some of which are quite unusual, such as the Cruise missile interception, and airstrikes with a wing-man flying alongside. The graphics are nice, and even without a sound card the effects and music aren't bad, but the only problem is, as usual, you do need at least a 12 MHz AT to play. The only other negative thing I could say is JF2 Isn't quite as technically polished as Red Baron, but then that's asking a lot. But there's no faulting it's playability, and as ever that's what counts. Nice going, Velocity. PAUL GLANCEY CARRIER LANDINGS Jet Fighter 2 is one of only a few computer flight simulators which can station the pilot on an aircraft carrier. Taking off isn't much of a problem, but landing on such a small runway is something else! Use the instrument Landing System to line the plane up on the glide slope, then gradually take the power down. Deploy the landing gear and the arrestor hook, then gently stall the plane onto the deck. If all is well the arrestor hook should stop the plane immediately, but any mistake and you'll have to open the throttle to full, take off and try again!

"REVIEW CE NINTENDO .99 BY NINTENDO the prospect of zooming around Daytona in a batlle damaged INASCAR automobile sounds remotely appealing, then this NES conversion of the notorious Tom Cruise movie could be the one for you You adopt the role of Cole Trickle (?), who drives around the major NASCAR circuits in the USA with the express purpose of in ishing the race in front of all the other participants, thus winning This is achieved by driving around the sprite 3D track, overtaking as many other cars as possible before the end of the race (Nothing like spelling it out, is there?  ED) But remember, this race is very gruelling and arduous so you can't to keep your car going on the same set of Tyres. Therefore, an occasional visit to the pits is in order, where your car can also re ceive a number of other benefits including extra luell Along with the racing action. There's also a low animated screens based on scenes from the movie. just don't expect a sam pled NES rendition of \"Show Me Heaven\".. CRUISIN' FOR A MOVIE Released in the latter part of 1990, Days of Thunder was given a unanimous thumbs down by the vast majority of critics the world over. Described by many as \"Top Gun with cars\", it cast Tom Cruise as Cole Trickle the Top Gun of the NASCAR circuit, aided and abetted by his sexy physician (Nicole Kidman). The wafer-thin plot generally involved Cruise winning a few races, losing a few races and getting to grips with Miss Kidman before winning the big race at the end hurrah! Who said that thought-provoking plots and sensitive screenplay were a thing of the past? A WORD FROM YOUR SPONSORS Keeping your sponsors sweet is the only way to get to drive your high-powered speed machine in the first place! Since they've invested good money in your abilities, they're expecting the best from you, so don't expect them to be very happy if you come last in all of your races! If luck isn't on your side and you lose a good few races, your sponsors may arrange a time trial. Fail this and you lose your backing. Lose your backing and your racing career is as good as over. YOUR POOR PERFORCE PVILL WITHDRAV 288 YOU IMPROVE INC STOP YOU MU PLETE TIME TRIAL H AN AVERAGE LAP OF 15:0 BECOM HOGGE XX Hardees. Nicole Kidman gibber, gibber! LUMINE Days of Thunder ranks as one of the most pitiful NES carts I've had the misfortune to review since I started at CVG. The 3D effect is quite pleasing, but the sprites are small and ill-defined, ruining the effect altogether. Since NONE of the tracks have any right-hand turns at all, they're all tedious beyond belief! The only difference is the colour of the sky and the stripes on the track. Boring! The speed of the game makes it about as exciting as an eight-day opera and the action itself is monotonous in the extreme. The sound consists of very dull and uninteresting tunettes and some sampled speech. In fact, I'd go as far to say that the best thing about the game is the intro sequence. There's some sampled thunder and streaks of lightning before the game opens proper. Other than that, Days of Thunder is a complete travesty that must NOT be purchased under any circumstances whatsoever. RICHARD LEADBETTER IT'S THE PITS If your car looks a bit the worse for wear, entering the pits at the beginning of each lap is probably the best way to get your car working again. Here, new tyres can be bolted on to your speedmobile and extra fuel tops up your tank. If your engine is completely exhausted, a new one can be added. But remember, time is ticking away and a fast pit-stop is essential to maintaining a good overall time. 106 PLACE TOP "


"IREVIEW 2525 And he takes the chequered flag almost.. YB OF T UPDATE Days of Thunder has been out and about for quite a while now on the ST, PC and Amiga. These polygon 3D games are a tad better than this effort, but none of them are really worth the .99 price tag. There's also a Gameboy cart of Days of Thunder (programmed by Argonaut software) which should be available before the year is out. Please pass driver running in... QUALIFICATION CHAOS Before each race can begin proper, your mettle is tested in a qualifving race. Here the objective is simply to reach the lowest possible average lap time. This then dictates your starting position on the grid. FORCE QUALIFYING MUS IALS LAP CONDI xxx THE TRACKS A lot of the tracks used in actual NASCAR racing are represented in this NES conversion of Days of Thunder. All of the tracks have different lengths and surfaces and affect the car in different ways. Some tracks, for example, are more wearing on the car's tyres. What is quite interesting though is that there is not ONE track in the whole game which has a right-hand turn. Spooky, eh? I agree with Rich entirely not only was the film a complete disaster, but the NES game is about as much fun as sticking your head in a bucket of dung. The intro's okay, but the rest of the game is a total drag duff sprites juddering around naff tracks to the sound of thousands of angry bees! Days of Thunder could have been quite entertaining, given the amount of scope available, but quite frankly, this follows in the movie's footsteps straight down the loo. Quite frankly, how this could ever merit Nintendo's seal of approval is utterly beyond me, as this has to rank as the worst NES games I've ever played. Unless you're either two tins short of a six-pack, mad about Tom Cruise (and who is?), or just plain stupid, leave this miserable effort alone.

"REVIEW PC ENGINE .00 BY IREM Vou'd think princesses would have better things to do than be I kidnapped by evil emperors and whisked away to far-off lands. But that's exactly what's happened (surprise, surprise), and it's down to little Tonma, the princess's beloved, to sort it all out. Tonma has to get through seven wild and wacky levels of scrolling platform action, blasting the emperor's mutant minions (using his magical gloves) and collecting keys, power-ups and shields along the way. Also, bags of loot and treasure chests lie scattered about, which boost Tonma's bank account. At the end of each level lurks an evil demon, summoned by the emperor to stop our diminutive do-gooder in his tracks. Blast that to shreds, and it's on to the next level. At the end of the seventh level lies the chief meanie, the emperor himself. Succeed in destroying him, and the two love birds are reunited. Fail, however, and the princess will be subjected to watching \"The James Whale Radio Show\" for the rest of her days! ME THE EMPEROR'S PERSONAL GUARD At the end of each level, massive demons summoned from the pits of Hades emerge, and try to do Tonma some serious bodily harm. Here's a list of who will do the dirty deed: LEVEL 1: A giant skeleton, with an enormous blade faces up to our hero. Watch out, though, as this demonic scum spits out a ball of energy which chases Tonma around the screen! LEVEL 2: A giant scaled serpent will fly around the screen, and must be blasted loads of times before he turns Tonma into a charcoal briquette! LEVEL 3: A strange plantlike creature spurts out minicreatures at you, intent on your doom. LEVEL 4: Two powerful trolls rise up from a terrifying statue, firing many deadly bullets at our hero. 110 "


"DD REVIEW LIB OF HERO Having never played Legend of Hero Tonma in the arcades, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I can safely say now that this has to rank as one of the most entertaining platform games I've played in many a moon. The graphics are great, with bright, cutesy sprites bouncing around all over the screen, and some really tasty backdrops, and the sound is full of bouncy, Jolly tracks and explosions that are a treat to the ears. Playability-wise, Tonma is really addictive, and easy enough to get into, but is challenging enough to keep players going for a long time. The only gripe I have with this is that there are infinite continues, so anyone lacking in willpower can simply cheat his way to the end. This aside, Legend of Hero Tonma is fun, entertaining, and a real laughand that's what a game should be. PC Engineers are advised to add this to their collection at once. ROBERT SWAN 111 111 "


"REVIEWT LEGEND OF HERO TONMA G-LOVELY POWER-UPS Tonma's magic gloves are a bit weedy to start off with, but by collecting the power-up crystal balls that lie around, his firepower can be increased to enormous proportions POWER-UP Increases firepower progressively: NORMAL: Fires single bolts of energy PLASMA: More powerful blasts, and more rapid. FIRE: Emits bouncing fireballs, which destroy anything in their path. Probably the most useful weapon. FIREBALL: Watch those fireballs hug the ground and annihilate all of Tonma's foes! SPHERES: These babies arc upwards, hitting any nasty that may be lurking above. BARRIER Collect this icon, and a ring of spinning spheres appears, which protect our hero from damage. Don't get too excited though, as the balls vanish one by one as Tonma takes hits, so be careful! IREM? WHO THEY? For those of you who've never heard of Irem (shame on youl), you may be interested to know that they were the company behind what is regarded as the best arcade shoot em up of all time R-Type. This slice of classic coin-op action started the ball rolling for blasters to come progressive firepower, massive end-of-level guardians, and an addictive quality that grabbed you by the throat and wouldn't let go. Of course, a sequel emerged (imaginitively titled R-Type ll). which will be soon appearing on computers, courtesy of Activision. Irem themselves have already launched R-Type on the Game Boy, and will be producing Super R-Type, which will appear on the Super Famicom later this year. Legend of Hero Tonma is quite an entertaining slice of platform excitement with excellent graphics that are pretty close to the arcade original. For a platform game, the concept of progressive weaponry is quite novel, and Tonma's magic finger arsenal builds up into quite an impressive fighting machine (which unfortunately vanishes when Tonma bites the dust). The gameplay itself is really challenging, and completing even the first couple of levels is quite an achievement. Unfortunately, as Rob said, the inclusion of infinite continues means that the most determined gamesplayers will be able to complete the game in one sitting. Normally, this seals a game's doom, but Legend of Hero Tonma's exciting gameplay means that it still gets the thumbs up from me. PC Engine owners are advised to check this out as soon as possible.

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY SEGA Aaabli Twas a dark and stormy nightstormy and dark it was 18 years ago when the peaceful kingdom of Excalabria was in vaded by Cartahena's foul despot from Hell, Lord Tsarkon. The armies of King Erik were all that could save the land from him, buli alas they were overwhelmed, and just before Erik himself was slain, he bade Blade, his bravest warrior, escape, taking the King's infant son with him so he could be raised in safety Eighteen years later Blade is dead but on his death bed he in formed his adopted son of his royal heritage and destiny. The Prince vows to avenge his father's death and reclaim the Kingdom that is his by right. But it will not be easy. Tsarkon possesses the eight Rings of Evil, and the only things that can match their power are the eight Rings of Good. They are scattered throughout the kingdom, and to regain them the Prince must pass through many countries, facing Tsarkon's army of demons and archmonsters, and undertaking many other quests which will test his kingly virtues After recovering the eight Rings of Good, he must find the single person who can craft for him a mighty blade, the Sword of Vermil lion. Thus armed he is ready to destroy his ultimate enemy; Tsar kon himself Talk Magic Item Equip Str Seek Open Take Talk Magic Item Equip Seek Open Take A treasure of 15.000 kiss is hidden in the Cave of Bursands to the southweste You opened the chest. There's a Bap inside It's funny, I never used to like Role-Playing Games, but recently there have been a load of good ones appearing on various machines, and Sword of Vermillion is one of the ones I've been playing most (Prince Paul is on level 16, and still only halfway through the game, would you believe). I think what I like about it most is the fact that the combat (which constitutes most of the action) is in an arcade format. It's not a particularly demanding arcade format, I admit, but it's such an improvement over the sort of combat system which appeared in Phantasy Star II where each character had to decide what type of attack they were to make in the next round of combat, take their turn to attack, and see the outcome only in terms of numbers. The game's plot is engaging and easy to follow . in fact it's made more interesting by the packaged hint book which coaxes the player through, getting rid of all possible annoyances without giving the game away entirely. The only thing I would draw attention to is the sound effects and the superb music, which is amongst the best I've heard in a Megadrive game. It's worth following the hint book's advice and buying a cable which hooks the Megadrive up to your stereo. Overall, then, an excellent RPG, which even those indifferent to adventures should enjoy.

"REVIEW RS29 HACIO. Corneros MAGIC. GETTING THE SHOW ON THE ROAD Woe betide any traveller who ventures outside his village without a map! The Prince will find most folk know the perils which lie beyond the gates of their townships, and at least one person will be generous enough to provide him with a map giving directions to the nearest village. Once on the road, this appears in the top right of the screen, next to a 3D view of the road ahead, which also shows the monsters which ambush any unwary traveller! KIH 111194 GOING TO TOWN There are 14 towns in Excalabria, and to complete the quest the Prince has to pass through each of them. Within a town's walls he can seek in formation about his quest, restore his tired body in an inn, then enter the church to save his progress in one of the three battery-backed saved position slots Most towns also have three different types of shop which will buy and sell equipment. Weapons shops deal in swords, shields and armour. Equipment shops stock such items as medicines and magical treasures which can save the life of beleaguered adventurers. Finally, the town's magic shop is the place to go have orders not to let anyone escape! Talk Magic Item Equip Str Seek Open Take ORD OF ATLJON LEVEL HEADED By killing monsters and completing subquests, the Prince earns cash, and also experience points. The experience points add up until, when they reach a certain figure, the Prince moves up a \"level\". This increases his maximum health and magic points and improves his intelligence, dexterity and luck, making him a better warrior and giving extra effectiveness to any spells he casts.

"REVIEW ORDER ARCH MONSTERS OF CARTAHENA Ik received fra elece utte DUNGEONS, DRAGONS AND DARKNESS At the end of many of the subquests, an enemy unexpectedly transforms himself into one of Tsarkon's huge archmonsters! When this happens, the screen again changes to give a side-on view of the action, with the Prince on the left and the archmonster on the right. The archmonsters are usually skilled in destructive magic, but the Prince can only use his sword to try to cut the archmonster into diabolical kebabs while dodging and blocking magic fireballs! Don't panic, though, because some of the monsters aren't as tough as they appear, and if the Prince has replenished his strength before going into battle he shouldn't have too much trouble seeing at least the early archmonsters off Throughout the quest, the Prince has to enter multi-level caves which may contain some treasure or an archmonster which must be defeated to allow further progress. Travelling underground is dangerous simply because there is no light, so the Prince must remember to bring a supply of candles, a lantern, or a book of light spells. The first thing to do is hunt for a chest which contains a map of the cave, then search all dead ends for more chests which may contain money or the treasure he was searching for. Naturally, roaming the catacombs are lots of monsters which have or ders not to let anyone escape! MAGIC 36:37 119.159 MAGIO. INTO BATTLE! After leaving the safety of a town, it's not long before the Prince runs into trouble. When monsters appear on the road, he must stop and confront them. At this, the screen changes to display a bird's-eye view of the road, the monsters and the Prince. Drawing his sword, the Prince leaps into battle, running around the screen slashing at his foes and dodging their blows or magic attacks. If he has readied a book of combat magic before the battle, he can use it. These attacks cost magic points, but magic fireballs, electrical blasts, homing boomerangs and huge flumes of water can save the Prince a lot of his magic points, particularly when he starts to run into tougher monsters later in the quest. Of course, if things get really tough, he can always leg it off the screen, although of course he misses out on the experience points (and money) he could have earned by fighting Sword of Vermillion is a simple, yet highly compelling arcade adventure/RPG. I find that a lot of Megadrive games prove to be very short-lived, but Sword of Vermillion offers a vast, sprawling adventure that'll have you up burning the midnight oil for many a month before the quest is finally complete. The hint book proves to be a worthy tool, providing an excellent guide to the land. The combat screens may not be that complex, but it's great fun whipping out your sword, chopping up all-and-sundry, and testing out your new magical powers as well. Graphically, Sword of Vermillion is a mixed bag, with the 3D screens looking decidedly rough, but this is more than made up for with the excellent town graphics and detailed sprites. It's the sound that lends a perfect atmosphere to the proceedings, with some of the best music ever heard on the Megadrive. With its intriguing plots and subplots, there's loads to keep you occupied and plenty of nasty surprises lying in wait for the hardy adventurer. Even if you're not that keen on RPGs, Sword of Vermillion is well worth the .00 price tag. RICHARD LEADBETTER MEGADRITE GRAPHICS 88 SOUNDS 94 PLAYABILITY 90 LASTABILITY 95 OVERALL 91 116 "

"0 N GHES The only thing that was remotely interesting about the original Street Fighter arcade machine was that the deluxe cabinet featured massive rubber punch buttons which you hit as hard as you could to inflict maximum damage on your opponents. Otherwise it was a fairly run-of-the-mill one-on-one beat 'em up with little in the way of thrills and spills. This sequel is another story... Boasting massive, beautifully drawn and animated sprites, tons of speech and the most exciting, action-packed head-to-head conflict yet seen in an arcade game, Street Fighter 2 is a beat 'em up classic. In single-player mode the objective is simple: choose one of eight fighters and then travel the world kicking the living daylights of the remaining seven opponents. The idea of each one-on-one CAPCOM 1991 ALL RIGHTESEF battle is to wear down your opponent's energy bar by either kicking or punching him/her into submission. Each fight is the best of three With two players, each person chooses a fighter and the battle rounds so two wins means promotion to the next round. Failure begins. The tournament is played over the best of three rounds, means game over (or shovelling more cash into the machine beand the winner goes on to fight the computer opponents (unless fore the timer reaches zero)! the loser puts more cash into the machine, whereupon the fight continues). Once the first seven opponents are defeated, the player moves onto characters that are otherwise inaccessible at the start of the game. There are four of these mega-tough guys including Balrog, a massive boxer, Vega, a very fast Spanish matador and Bison, a huge Russian wrestler. Beat him and you become Street Fighter champion but that takes some doing! TAL I didn't like the original Street Fighter game it just didn't have enough original features to make it worth playing. This sequel, however, is absolutely packed with new ideas and special moves, and the end result is one of the best fighting games yet seen in the arcades. With six buttons combining with 8 joystick directions to provide more moves than I've ever seen in a beat 'em up, this takes quite some time to master. But it's well worth practicing especially when you discover a devastating new move to baffle opponents with! The computer fighters are very tough and provide plenty of challenge, but it's with two people where Street Fighter 2 excels especially when the players are evenly matched. Street Fighter 2 is a brilliant coin-opjust make sure that when you start playing it, you've got a pocketful of cash. JULIAN RIGNALL RYU A martial arts expert from the original Street Fighter game. This time he's learned several new moves, including Hurricane Punch, Dragon Kick and Fireball. He's agile and strong and is a brilliant all-round fighter. This competent combatant moved to America so he could train with tougher opponents, and he can now match Ryu blow for blow, even Hurrican Punches and Dragon Kicks. "


"Urusi 552393 01300 25 $ $ PUSHER KO BONUS ROUNDS There are three different bonus stages breaking up the fighting action. First of all is a car-smashing feast similar to the one in Final Fight where the object is to reduce a car to scrap metal within the quickest possible time. Next is a barrel-breaking extravaganza where you have to break falling barrels before they bowl you over. Finally there's a blazing oil drums session where punching and kicking skills are re. quired to destroy a lottering pile of incendiary storage devices within the time limit. RIGHTS RESERVED PHera 1P RYU BEYKEN BLANKA A wolf-man from Brazil who looks and fights like an animal. He can body dive, electrify his opponent, chew their faces and punch with incredible strength. He's very fast and is great with twoplayers, but not quite so good with computer opponents. GUILE This mean GI is as tough as they come. His Somersault Kick and Sonic Boom are deadly offensive moves, and his mid-range and closequarter combat abilities make him a fearsome adversary. CHUN LI The prettiest fighter and the one with the biggest hips! Chun Li is very fast and has some great punching and kicking moves including the deadly Spinning Bird Kick. She's not very strong, but she's by far the most agile fighter. DHALSIM A true rubber man! Dhalsim's stretchy limbs means he can inflict massive long-range damage on opponents, but his close-range combat isn't so hot. His specialist moves include Yoga Fire, Fire Blast and a spinning, floating kick. Recommended. "


"JARO ARCADE ACTION 2 HOW MANY BUTTONS? The amount of controls looks bewildering at first, with three punch and three kick buttons as well as a joystick used to control your fighter. However, it's not all that tricky to get to grips with. Each button represents a strength either weak, medium or strong. Strong punches knock great chunks of energy off your opponent, but the penalty for using a strong punch is that if your opponent hits you while you're making the move, you lose more strength. Each fighter also has a series of special moves, accessed via a variety of joystick directions and button presses these are tricky to learn, but the end results are well worth it! SALS ZANGIEF This big, fat Russian wrestler is very, very strong. His deadly spinning punch knocks masses of strength out of an enemy, and his pile driver can finish them off in seconds. The penalty for all this strength is that he's very slow. HONDA Another slow, but strong character. Sumo wrestler Honda has many tricks up his sleeve, including nerve pinch, hundred-hand punch, headbutt, bear hug and knee slap. His weakness, however, is in his lack of kicking range.

"HPREVIEW VERSION DATE PRICE MEGADRIVE SEPTEMBER .99 onic the Hedgehog must rank as one of the most eagerly awaited Megadrive cartridges ever! Sega are touting this game as more than a match for Nintendo's Super Mario World on the Super Famicom. Boasting super-sonic platform game. play and stunning graphics, it's guaranteed to sell bundles by the time it's officially released in the UK (around Septembertime, but probably available a couple of months earlier on import from the USA). There are fifteen sprawling platform levels, each split into five acts. The object in each is simply to guide our turbocharged hedgehog through each scene, in search of a special flag. But there are plenty of obstacles including spikes that shoot out of from the walls and the floor, collapsing platforms, and lakes of water and fire. But there's plenty more besides, including some of the meanest (and cutest) little villains yet seen in a home video game! THE HEDGEHOG SEGA RESS-START BUT SONIC BOOM BOY There are loads of icons dolled around the scrolling landscapes, and these have different effects on our prickly hero One type gives him a temporary shield which protects him from some of the evil sprites. Another type gives Sonic a brand new pair of running shoes which make him run at incredible speeds (hyper sonic?). If you're really lucky you'll find a very special icon that gives Sonic both powers at once. Yikes! SCORE TIME 0:39 RING 9 TOPSY-TURVY BONUS BONANZA This bonus screen involves Sonic careering around a rotating maze, desperately trying to find a way out on the way, there, are different tiles to bump, and each may spang Sonic in a dil ferent direction.

Sonic builds up speed by running down hills and provided he's fast enough, he can travel around the massive loop-the-loops. Some of the tunnel levels see Sonic rolling himself up in a ball and then speeding down the tunnels double-quick! So, not only is Sonic brilliantly fast, it's original too!

"PREVIEW VERSION NINTENDO DATE AUGUST PRICE   WZAR WARS I'LL FLY you out of here for a price. LUCASFILM/JVC uite some time ago, in a galaxy not too far away, a man by the name of George Lucas dazzled the world with a film that was to set standards of believability for years to come. That film was Star Wars (or, to give it its proper title, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope). Now Lucas's software arm is giving a new breath of life into the Star Wars saga with the release of this, a version of the movie for the NES. The player has three primary characters to control: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, but will also have to manipulate Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 as well, over six action sequences, including driving a landspeeder through the canyons of Tatooine, piloting the Millennium Falcon through an asteroid field, and hurtling down the Death Star trench in an X-wing fighter! As you can see from the screenshots, it certainly looks interesting we've had a sneaky peep, and we can tell you it certainly is impressivel Star Wars will be released on the NES in Britain at the same time as it hits the shelves in the USA, which will be in August. As we get our hands on this one, CVG will bring you the full review, Reperea 124 "

Well, in that case, TurboCharge is the one for you. System 3's new racer pits you at the controls of a \"unique Italian sports car\" (which bears a remarkable resemblance to a Lambourghini, don't you think?). Your task is to rip up the road, guns-a-blazing, in order to catch the dealers before they reach the border. According to the blurb, TurboCharge features a unique driving control which effectively puts the player in control of the road! Apparently, this \"adds so much more to this product\", and we look forward to testing this claim when we review the game, hopefully in the next issue of this very magazine! 125 "

Add to that the fact that your gas is running out all the time certainly make the situation all the more unpleasant... ICE (the team behind the 16 bit conversions of Turbo OutRun and SCI) are the guys on the job, and from what we've seen of the Amiga version, the whole thing is coming together nicely. The one snag lies in the coin-op: the original wasn't exactly the hottest thing in excitement, which doesn't bode well for the home versions.

"PREVIEWH VERSION AMIGA (1 MEG) DATE JULY TBA TBA PRICE  29.99     ST BIRDS OF PREY ELECTRONIC ARTS After four years of development, Argonaut's mega flight sim, Hawk, is now ready to be unleashed upon a not-so-unsuspecting world. Now titled Birds of Prey, this massive game features 40 different aircraft to fly, including Soviet-built MiG-298, European Saab and Tornado fighters, and the very latest in US warplane technology, including the Rockwell B1 and the F117/A Stealth Fighter! Ooh! Argonaut have also kitted out Birds of Prey with the latest in 3D graphics technology. Each object is individually lightsource shaded (as the hanger doors open, the interior becomes progressively lighter!) and highly detailed. Argonaut have also included ellipses in their graphical routines, so wheels are actually circular in shape rather than being made out of squares or hexagons. Rather than restraining each aircraft to strict performance limits, Argonaut have implemented a more realistic system where each aircraft's performance is altered by the plane's weight, ordnance and payload, the plane's aerodynamics, and so on. Thus, a fighter that has used all its available weapons and a great deal of fuel will be able to return to base at a higher altitude, and a much greater velocity! Twelve mission types are available, including aerial interception, bombing runs and troop drops, as well as aerial recon using laser-guided cameras, and test flying experimental aircraft, such as the X-15. All the missions are open-ended, which gives the player unlimited variations. Both sides are constantly active, and set in a real-time environment, with real constellations emerging when the sun sets! Phewee!

Programmed by Brent Iverson (who did the job on the brilliant LHX Attack Chopper and the not-quite-so-brilliant Stormovik), this features a brand new graphics engine, utilising 256 colour VGA graphics and allowing 20 (count 'em) external viewpoints! Over 50 missions are available, in three of the deadliest combat theatres in modern history namely, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Both Allied and opposing aircraft can be flown, including the P-51 Mustang, the F86 Sabre, the MiG-15, the F-4 Phantom and the MiG-25. In addition to that, there's a nifty custom mission facility, allowing the player to select type of plane, altitude, tactical situation, skill of enemy pilots plus the number of enemy aircraft from 17 possible types! Add to that General Yeager himself giving comments on the player's flight techniques (through the use of graphic windows and digitised speech), and you've got yourself a flight sim worth checking out. Look for the review in a future issue of CVG. 127 "

Along the way, such items as magic flowers, bombs, bullets, and ice crystals can be collected, which in turn will aid the two on their quest.
