"Instead of computers catc technology now has to ca ENTERPRISE The way we see it, technology has suddenly got quite a race on its hands. There's no other home computer in the world that's so expandable or so updatable as the new Enterprise 64. And if you're wondering quite how we've managed that, kindly take a closer look at the outputs on our remarkable new machine. You'll notice that amongst all the usual sockets and terminals, we've gone and incorporated a special 66-way expansion port. This will accept a whole range of new peripherals that are in the pipeline. Including those that are a mere twinkle in the eyes of our hardware designers. We thought this expandability principle was such a good idea, we applied it to the Enterprise's memory, too. Even in its most basic 64K form, this puts more user RAM at your disposal than almost any other competitor. But plug in our special Rampacks to the base unit, and you can progressively increase that figure to a truly extraordinary 3,900K "


"Whing up with technology, atch up with a computer. NEUSE Not that that's the only challenge we present to today's ambitious programmers. With a screen resolution of up to 672 x 512 pixels, 256 colours and a high speed video processor, the Enterprise will outgun all but the highest quality TV monitors. And the sophisticated sound chip generates no fewer than 4 voices across 8 octaves in full stereo. Combine the two and you can create effects that leave today's games looking like pub video tennis of the mid-seventies. For anyone with literary aspirations, the Enterprise also comes complete with an integrated word processor. Whilst the really serious user will be delighted to discover analogue RGB and TV outputs, as well as parallel, RS423 serial and network ports. Both Cobol and 'C' will be available with CP/M running, and you can even use Lisp, Forth and Z80 assembly language on cartridge without encroaching on user RAM. The new Enterprise 64.

"VD Dear BH, I am thinking of buying a disc drive for use with my Commodore 64. But the Commodore drive is so slow. Is there another one I can buy and how much is it? Andrew Wood The Commodore 1541 disc drive is slow. Even Commodore admit that which is why they almost brought out the 1542 to replace it. But high production costs mean that no 1542s will arrive over here. The 1541 drive is actually slower than turbo-loaded cassettes! Ram Electronics may have come up with the answer, though. They have a cartridge called the 1541 Express which speeds up loading and saving by around three times. The black box costs  and Ram are in Fleet, Hampshire. Dear BH, Please can you tell me if there are any graphical Adventures available for the BBC? Many of the popular Adventures are text only. Richard Russum As you know, the Beeb only has 32k of memory in which to store programs. Drawing pictures takes up a lot of space in the program and using the high resolution screen takes up even more. So, until the new Beeb with more memory comes along, there will be very few good graphical Adventures for the machine. The Hobbit, as you know, is text only although it has full graphics on the Spectrum. One program worth buying is Underwurlde, though. This has all the graphics of the Spectrum original. Dear BH I am writing to ask you if you could give me a list of the modems available for the Spectrum and approximate prices. Gavin Walsh To get into Micronet and Prestel, you'll need either a VTX 5000 modem from Prism or the acoustic modem from Protek. The Prism version costs  and plugs into the user port on the Spectrum (16k or 48k). All the software is built in. So you just turn on your Spectrum and a menu appears. You press one button for Micronet and another if you want to use the Spectrum as normal. The Protek modem is an acoustic coupler. This means that, instead of plugging the modem straight into a phone socket, as is the case with the VTX 5000, you plug the telephone handset into the coupler. This coupler is battery operated and comes with software on cassette. However, the quality of the software leaves a lot to be desired and I'd recommend that you go for a VTX 5000. If it's 300 baud bulletin boards that you want to contact, you'll need a full RS232 interface on your computer. The one on the Interface 1 isn't good enough. Then, any modem will connect to the interface. Once again, you'll have to buy some special software on cassette. Dear BH, I hope that you can help me with my problem. I wish to write a very short program which will predict a future event from a list of possibilities. One of four choices would be selected at random, with each being used only once. I can't seem to generate a random choice. Can you help? PJ Bradley What you're after, Mr Bradley, is a way of picking things from a list at random without repetitions. The long way round this problem is to keep a record of which ones have been picked. Then, after a random number is generated, check to make sure that that number hasn't been used before. There is a quicker way, though. Just imagine that the list of events is a pack of cards that we want to deal from. The way we'd handle the cards is to shuffle them first. Then, just take the top card from the pack each time we need one. So, back to your problem. First, store all the possibilities in an array numbered, perhaps, A(1) to A(10). Then use a FOR-NEXT loop and an RND statement to shuffle the array. Go through the loop a few hundred times. Each time, generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is 0.5 or less, swap a couple of elements of the array. After the loop has finished, the array will be totally shuffled. Then, just pull off the elements in order. You'll find that they are totally random and that you won't get any repetitions. Hope this helps. Dear BH, I am writing to ask whether it is possible to insert the TV aerial lead from a computer into the back of a video recorder so that a game can be played and recorded at the same time. Mark Laing Yes, Mark. Normally, the TV aerial goes into the back of the video recorder, and the recorder is then connected to the TV. Pull out the TV aerial lead and plug the lead from the computer into the back of the video. You can now play your favourite game and watch it as normal on the TV. Dear BH, I have a Spectrum with Microdrive. I normally buy games on cassette and transfer them straight to Microdrive. Transferring BASIC games is OK, but I have problems with machine code. It is easy enough to find the starting address, but is there a simple PEEK which will tell me how long a program is, or where it finishes? Alan Harbour When you load in a program, be it from cassette or Microdrive, the program first loads a header which tells the computer how long the program is, whether it is in BASIC or machine code and where the program starts. Also included is the auto-start line number for BASIC programs. What you need is a program to read the header from a tape. This will then tell you the start address and length of the machine code, so that you can save it to Microdrive. However, long machine code programs can't be transferred to Microdrive directly as they take up some of the memory that the Microdrive system actually uses. The way round this is to load the program in two parts, or load it to a lower address to the place where it will actually run. There are various header-reading routines around. Keep an eye out for an advert in the back of C&VG. OOO OOOO! 20 Actua "

"THE DRAGONTORC OF AVALON When sons of Troy did win this land There lived a mighty king called Bran. He carved a realm from shore to shore, Strong in peace and feared in war. But all things change. All men must die As time and seasons pass us by.

One night, not long after the night of the long knives, Maroc sat gazing into the glowing embers of his camp fire, hypnotised by the dancing patterns as the cold night wind fanned the ashes. As he watched, a strange numbness overcame him and he felt touched by some magical presence which faded away as quickly as it had come. He started, thinking he had heard a voice, but no-one emerged from the gloom. He lay down to sleep but he was restless and could not settle, feeling as if someone or something were trying to break into his consciousness. In the cold hours before the dawn, he surrendered to the alien disturbance, packed his sack and started walking. For many days and nights he travelled, sleeping and resting little. The giddy alien sensation grew each day. He did not know why or where he was going. He travelled until he came to a clearing deep within a great forest. He sensed power emanating from an old tree stump. It was hollow, filled with the sodden leaves of autumn. He dug amongst the leaves and his hand touched metal, not cool dead metal, but warm vibrating steel with the unmistakable energy of magic. He stared at the artifact he had been drawn to and trembled. It was the great seal of Merlyn, last of the Lore Lords, guardian of the Dragon heir. As he peered into the emblem of the great Dragon, the power passed through his shaking arm, stirring his nerves until it seemed as if he were floating on a bed of warm air. Again he heard a voice. This time it was recognizable, though faint.

"N GAME OF THE MONTH. WMN o Clingon destroyer ships are cruising at warp speed to a cluster of inhabited planets in a remote quadrant of the galaxy. Their aim is to decimate the major cities and take over mining of the valuable mineral ores that only occur on these four planets. If the Clingons succeed in capturing the planet, they will have sealed off the Federation's only supply of Cyanite crystals, an essential component of warp drive engines. As captain of the Federation's Special Emergencies Squadron, you have been sent to intercept the attacking forces and destroy them before they capture the planet system. If you become hopelessly surrounded, you can hyperspace your ship out of trouble, although the hull of your spaceship can only take the strain of five hyperjumps. Control keys and instructions are included in the program.

"A message from ENGLISH SOFTWARE to all owners of ATARI, COMMODORE 64, BBCB, ACORN ELECTRON and AMSTRAD Computers... of the Nick Hole 5.8.95 Software companies grow on trees ... at least that's the way it seems from the number of new companies springing up every ATARI week! SMASH HITS NATARI ENGLISH SOFTWARE was launched three years ago with a SMASH HITS SATARI SMASH HITS smashing little game for Atari Computers called AIRSTRIKE 1, which quickly became one of the most popular U.K. programmed games for the Atari. Then, as now, Atari Computers were amongst the most advanced on the planet, but they were a TRIFLE expensive! But we knew that prices would come down, and that more $14.95 people would soon appreciate the great range of 32K Cas .95 EACH 48K Disk Atari software produced by ENGLISH SOFTWARE. EACH But Atari owners used to be a funny lot, being heard to utter such gems as: \"It can't be any cop, if it costs less than \" Honestly, that's what they used to sayl Anyway, .95 in the face of this rather strange attitude, we went 48K Disk) ahead and committed the ultimate sin: ATARI GAMES AT .95! .95 We expected some slight resistance to these 48K Cas prices from Atari owners who only equated high .95 quality with high prices, but we were wrong: CBM64 Everybody thought the prices were great, and the games too! We even produced the fantastic ATARI CASSETTE ENHANCER at .95, a superb utility program for Fortune BASIC programmers. So now, for those of you who might have missed out on all our excellent Atari titles, we are releasing something very, very special: ATARI SMASH HITS Volumes 1, 2 and 3 from ENGLISH SOFTWARE. .95 .95 .95 Five great games on one cassette for only .95, auf14 95 CBM64 CBM64 CBM 64 or on disk at f17.95! Each cassette features our top-rated JET-BOOT JACK plus four other popular titles. So now you have no excuse to miss out on the best range of U.K. produced Atari 400/800/600XL/800XL software for 32R machines. If your dealer does not yet have them in stock, ask him to order them from his nearest Atari wholesaler. It will be the best Atari buy YOU will make all year! We have also just released COLOSSUS CHESS 3.0, the best chess program available anywhere for Atari 400/800/600XL/800XL computers with 48K.

"RUNS ON A COMMODORE 64 A massive disaster on one of the North Sea's largest oil rigs has endangered the lives of hundreds of men. One of the superstructure's metal legs has already collapsed. and a second is almost at breaking point. As the pilot of an air-sea rescue helicopter, it is up to you to fly into the disaster zone and airlift the men to a waiting cargo ship, which will then take them back to dry land. Gale force winds and huge waves make flying difficult, and landing almost impossible. One wrong push of the joystick can send you, and your passengers, crashing into the sea or the bridge of the ship. Full instructions are included in the listing.

Wait for it to come down, enter and then go up the screen firing all the time. On Alpiner, if you want to stop, but don't want to lose any time, try stopping and pressing the fire button.

Your mission is to locate and safely store the treasures of the dungeon. To help you achieve this, I shall act as your puppet and tell you of all that I see and hear around me. You can tell me what to do by using simple two-word commands like GO NORTH or READ BOOK. If you should at any time type a command which I do not understand, try rephrasing it using a different verb or noun. Before entering this program type POKE 82,0:POKE 38,39 and then press RETURN. Also, to enter some of the longer logic lines it will be necessary to use the abbreviation for commands shown in the Basic Reference Manual. It may, in some cases, be necessary to close some of the gaps between command statements to get the program line to fit. Lines 580, 2430, 20000,200020, 20050, 20070, 20090, 20100, 20110, 20130, 20140, 20150, 20160, 20180, 20190., 20230 and 20265 all start with clear screen commands. The text in lines 470.610 and 20,200 should be typed in inverse video. When entering line 600, type the following between the quotation marks, press the ESC key, then hold down the CTRL key and press key. Then hold down the CTRL key and press the R key 40 times. To save both programs on tape, use SAVE:C, saving the title programs first, then to load and run this Adventure from tape, type RUN\"C:.

Apples, mushrooms and other vegetables abound in their hundreds. It looks like Creepy Crawly is in for a feast fit for a king this lunchtime. There are, however, a few teeny weeny problems that might give Creepy Crawly more than a touch of indigestion. Skulls and rocks are strewn all over the garden and if Creepy, in his confusion, swallows one of them he'll die. The same is true if he runs into his own body or the wall surrounding the garden.

"Herbie Briggs has just destroyed the myth that all floppy discs are created equal. floppy stiffer. Stronger. And your data safer. To resist bulging, warping, puckering, or opening up. MEMOREX SOLID-SEAM BONDING: Every inch of every seam is sealed shut. Tight as a drum. They seem equal. Until you look at the seams. That's where equality ends. Most companies seal their discs with a spot here, a spot there. Leaving most of each seam not sealed at all. Sooner or later, the seams might do what comes naturally: they bulge. Warp. Pucker. Open up. Pens, pencils, fingernails-even a fouryear-old's, like Herbie-can catch and snag in those wide open spaces. That's sloppy. And dangerous. Because if you put a sloppy floppy into your disc drive, it can jam your drive. Ruin your drive head. Lose your data. So much for their seams. Ours are different. THE SLOPPY FLOPPY: Sealed with a spot here, a spot there. Leaving unsealed seams everywhere. To resist all the things that can jam your drive, ruin your drive head, or lose your data. Which proves that a Memorex floppy disc isn't equal to all the others. It's better. Solid-Seam Bonding is just one example of the extra care that goes into every Memorex floppy disc. Be it 8 524\" or the new 372\" Extra care that lets us guarantee every Memorex disc to be 100% error-free. The next time you're buving a floppy disc-or a few hundred of them-just remember this: It's always better to be safe than sloppy.

Such a move would turn the clock back 130 years the last tax on the Press was repealed in 1855.

"RCBUSTERS! 1000 Â«There's something strange in your neighbourhood. Who you gonna call?\" \"ORCBUSTERS!\" This is the story of how the C&VG Adventure Team entered a dank and gloomy dungeon and were confronted by some of the nastiest creatures known to man Orcs! In the flicker of candlelight, these Orcs looked remarkably like 10-year old boys, making them even more deadly. Before attempting to tackle these vile Orcs, we had to be briefed in swordsmanship. So trying to act like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Conan films, I set about swinging my sword round and promptly hit myself in the face! (Well, Arnold has had more practice!) My mother did tell me that there would be things in this job I wouldn't like but, before you read the full account of our ordeals, I want once and for all to squash a rumour. It is not true that when Keith and I were put in the front line, even though having the advantage of height, we knelt down and said: \"Look, we're shorter than you lot!\" (OK Keith, you can stand up now!) Every adventure has its heroes and what better account of courage and bravery than when Tim and I, heavily outnumbered, charged in pursuit of three Orcs? How were we to know that there were 15 more lurking round the corner? With amazing speed and dexterity we turned around and Tim passed me at about Mach 1 as we made our retreat! Treasure Trap is an excellent place to visit if you're a budding warrior. Watch out for the monsters though and if you get into a tight spot, call us! We're experts now! We are ... THE ORCBUSTERS! Simon Marsh malevolent odour of an Orc's pharrt. Since by now three of our number had been badly wounded and were weakening to the point of death, we had to use our logic and cunning to decide which jar held the cure. Thus, all members of our band of Adventurers restored to full health, we puzzled awhile, and discovered the secret of escaping the room, using the power which we, and we alone, possessed. But we still lacked the wand of Prospero! Further down the endless corridor Encounter with a Zombie! we came across a room with a deep pit, a narrow and precarious route leading across it and down to an alcove from which came the faintest flickering of light. Tim led one of the maidens across, but their passage dislodged the bridge and they became stranded on the other side. But they had discovered a hidden room, where the poor miller's son was imprisoned. Tim freed the poor lad for the price of the scroll the miller's son had Simon searches a dead Adventurer. Supremo and his band. spotted something. But it was too late, for charging down the almost endless corridor now before us came a large band of Orcs, brandishing their swords. From behind they came, as well, and we fought bitterly on two flanks, trying at the same time to examine the magic object and determine whether or not it was safe to handle. At length we came upon the Alchemist's room, its decor completely black save for a red drape across the ceiling, a pentagram and strange runes written on the walls. As we entered, a strange throbbing could be heard, at some times almost inaudible, at others nearly deafening. Here we found the Alchemist in the company of Prospero's daughter and her handmaiden Within the room were two large jars, each filled with a murky liquid, one red, the other green. Wisps of mist were rising from the necks of the jars. \"Therein lies a cure and a poison â€” which is which we know not,\" explained the maidens. Sniffing the contents revealed that whilst one had a sweet, intoxicating fragrance, the other had the COMPETITION If you get your hands on a copy of Macbeth you could win a very special prize.

"STAR SYSTEM PROCYON GROUTH CENTRALIZATION : STRENGTH BEING STAR STARS RULED ACNOU SOCIOTYPE ZERO NORMAL  IMPERIAL PHASE 6 STAR SYSTEM SCORPIUS changes during the course of a game but what \"epoch\" it is governed by does change. A Zero Normal star, for instance, can be in one of two epochs, Imperial or Communal. The key point about an epoch is that it directly influences the way a star's growth rate and centralisation factor change over time. In the next 5th Column, we shall see how changes in epoch occur in accord with sociotype. This month, for simplicity, the epochs are constant. Your brief is to explore the intricacies of galactic power and to observe how a star's epoch is crucial to its rise or fall. You might also pause to consider an interesting question: which of the two epochs has the best chance of seizing ultimate power, Imperial or Communal? I'm sure the Kremlin would like to know but, failing that, you can always send me the answer don't forget to say why!

The Spectrum listing printed here is to be added to the listing provided in the last 5th Column, so you should take care to get the line numbers exactly right or nasty things may happen! The new routines allow you to check the vital statistics of individual stars as the game progresses and also enable the calculations which influence a star's growth rate and centralisation factor. The game has now been limited to 26 stars (one for each letter of the alphabet) to make star identification simpler. Now, however, you must enter a random seed number at the beginning of the game. This should be between 1 and 65535. Use the same number again and you will get the same galactic set-up. Enter 0 for a truly random set-up. During processing, the border colour becomes red when it turns black again, you can check on individual stars before initiating the next phase. Press \"1\" to label each star by letter on the galactic map. Press \"l\" again to redraw a label-free map. Press any of the letter keys to access details of an individual star. Press \"O\" to initiate the next phase of the game. These key presses are valid in galactic map mode or individual star mode. A star's read-out gives you its name, its growth, centralisation, strength and power, its ruling star and the code letters of the stars it rules. Also listed are its sociotype and its epoch. However, if the star rules other stars, its power may be swelled due to the centralisation factor. Centralisation indicates what proportion of a subordinate star's strength the ruling star takes to add to its own strength and use as power. A star with a centralisation factor of 0.9 will grab 90% of the strength of the stars it rules, all of which will go to swell its power. Finally, we come to \"sociotype\" and \"epoch\". For this month, I've give all the stars the same sociotype Zero Normal. More types will follow soon!

"SUPER SKETCH A Remarkable Innovation in Video Graphics Until now, creating computer graphics in colour has been both a demanding and expensive endeavor. The Super Sketch Graphics Tablet provides a totally unique and simple medium for creating video graphics at a surprisingly low cost. By simply moving the stylus control arm, as you would a pencil, Super Sketch reproduces the movement on the video screen. Four control buttons at the top of the tablet assist in operating the graphic functions of the software. Graphics may be created by \"free hand\" or by Â«tracing\" from drawings clipped to the pad. Compared with other computer graphic products, it is much easier to use than keyboard controls, does more than joysticks, paddle controllers and mouse controllers, and is less expensive than touch pad products. A brief demonstration instantly proves the remarkable features of Super Sketch. This product makes an excellent \"Demo Display\" in retail stores because anyone can immediately produce graphics with little or no instructions SUPER SKETCH  Cassette Software Includes Printer Utility and Starter Art Programs  Tracing & Free Hand Drawing On One To One Ratio To Video Screen NOW f4995  Four Easy To Use Menus: Main, Brush, Design, Expert  Custom Brush & Design Capability  Keyboard Text Entry Capability  Easy To Use Push Button Controls  Graphics Can Be Saved To Cassette And Reproduced On A Printer  Zoom Window  Creates Super Video Graphics  Absolutely Simple To Use  Cassette Software Included Printer Utility Included  Starter Kit Included te 9 Compatibility Screen Resolution Color Selection Unit Dimensions (In Gift Box) Commodore 64 160 x 200 16 16/\"x124\"x21/2\" ANIROG Trade Enquiries Unit 10 Victoria Industrial Park, Victoria Road, Dartford, Kent DA15AJ Tel: 032292538 "
