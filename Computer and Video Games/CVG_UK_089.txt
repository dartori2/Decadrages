"Titus Titan It's futuresports time again, thanks to Titus, who take us to Vegapolis in the year 2114 for the first game of Titan. The man behind Titan is a certain Professor Hybris who has invented something called a leisure axle, which is apparently fundamental to this rather deadly sport. What it all boils down to is steering your power ball across 80 huge scrolling playfields using a magnetic racket to avoid death-dealing icons. It's fast, it's funky, it's available in reputable software retailers from February on the ST, Amiga, PC, Amstrad and C64 with a Spectrum version to follow. Review next month.

If you're one of the lucky ones and haven't actually seen the film, here is a brief synopsis courtesy of the FAX Brief Synopses Inc (Limp Movies Dept.). Nasty Mr Big is out to wreck the lives of children worldwide, by getting them addicted to dangerous drugs, but luckily, Michael and the Under Eleven World Saving Team are on the case. Impowered with astral inspiration by a passing meteorite, the heroic Mr J transforms himself from multi-millionaire pop star to a rabbiticarlspacecraftirobot and saves the day in the process. Darn, we've given the ending away. US Gold are convinced this is perfect material for a computer game and are planning un unprecedented marketing campaign to lead up to the Moonwalker launch in the autumn. Will it be a \"Thriller\"? Will there be anything on the market to \"Beat It\"? Or will it be totally \"Bad\"? for a computer "

If not sooner, even! While the West German authorities are willing and able to ban games like Silent Service and even mags like (gasp!) C+VG because of the corrupting influence they may have on their children, they are unfortunately powerless to stop a more sinister form of computer entertainment. According to a recent report in that prestigious journal, The Independent, there is a network of neo-Nazi hackers in Europe who produce blatantly Fascist software then circulate it via MODEM operated mailboxes and bulletin boards. The perpetrators are then untraceable, and are free to watch their software being circulated via electronic mail and even playground disk swapping. The software usually takes the form of strategy games with a strong anti-Jewish tone, one such going under the title \"Hitler Dictator\". This nasty bit of propaganda asks the player such questions as \"'Should your SS carry out a crackdown on the Jews?\" and \"Do you want to put 10,000 marks and 1,000 burnable Jews into your ATARI STITOP TEN Falcon Mirrorsoft.

"being Defended Crown stil Tanks a lot -10002001-WINDICATORL-10003001ZAP SHOT Canon TO Zappy Shaos This little baby is the Canon Zap Shot, a revolutionary new camera which has just been launched in America. Instead of forcing the amateur David Bailey to fumble with his film, the Zap Shot stores up to fifty Images on a special video floppy disk, just over two inches square. So how do you view your pics? Just plug the camera into your TV and you can flick through the disk-based album at your leisure. Then, when you're tired of your old photos. Just wipe the disk and start again. The fact that the pictures are stored digitally also means that, if you have the necessary hardware, you can fiddle around with them and use them in home video productions, print personal messages on them, or even print them out in full colour! The Zap Shot is priced at around $200 in the USA, which should translate to just over  when it gets over here. The C+VG camera klutz squad just can't wait. The first in Domark's series of Tengen licenses due for release soon is the scrolling tank shoot 'em up, Vindicators. You and a partner take your little tanks through fourteen heavily defended space stations, knocking out gun emplacements, mines and, of course, enemy tanks. Like all the best blasters these days, Vindicators has facilities for customising your fighting machine with such wonders as speedups, extra armour, bomb cannons and smart missiles. All the conversions are being programmed by Consult Computer Systems, who worked on the Return of the Jedi license, and judging by our screenshots they have exercised a little artistic license, providing a radar scanner on the Amstrad version, and some slightly altered graphics on the ST game. Still, hopes are high in the C+VG office, especially those of a certain Julian Rignall, who claims the world record on the coin-op. Quote: \"I can't waitl\": unquote. Thanks Jaz. "

"Telles MACHINE: C64. SUPPLIER: ACCOLADE.  PRICE: .99 CASS. VERSION TESTED: C64. REVIEWER: TONY DILLON. 123) ili A Fists up seconds away. To win with style is to win a knockout, and to get a knockout, you have to completely eradicate your opponent's energy level by laying on blow after blow in quick succession. This is a very, very hard thing to do nearly every punch you throw, provided you throw punch after punch without stopping has to hit with maximum power and accuracy. The only other way you can win is to win by points, getting in more successful punches than him each round. The graphics are quite nice. Large and colourful, the way the boxer's hand grows to huge proportions and then receeds to give the impression of punching out of the screen works really well. When you knock down a man, you get a short scene of that player on the floor. desperately trying to climb the ropes while the referee looks on. This looks like a digitised shot that's been coloured in. So, back to the opening question, does it work? It's a new twist on an old theme, and granted, it plays quite nicely. The problem is, the novelty wears off too quickly and you are left with an essentially boring game. The gameplay dies within the first round and any feelings of 'one more go' are begging for mercy inside of three. Not a TKO for Accolade. In fact, I don't think they've managed to get through the ropes. Mane: Boxer 4 POMS Hand Lett Risht Risht Weakness! Fati 2000 Well, it's original, I can safely say that much: two-player Punch Out, first-person perspective and split screen. Not a bad idea but the question on everybody's lips is, does it work? Play either one-player against a series of opponents of increasing difficulty in a bid to win the title, or two-player with no aim other than to knock the socks off your opponent. Before the fight, you have to build a boxer. This is done by using a number of slide markers, each representing a different balance. You can decide between left and right stances, a hand with the most punching power, best punch (body or head), and balance out between speed of punch and power and choose your boxer's weakness. Once you've created your boxer and called him a suitable hard man tough guy name like Tony, Eugene or Cecil, it's into the ring you go. The screen is set up into a number of windows. On the left hand side of the screen are two large ones (phwurr). Each is a boxer's eye view of the other boy as he (yes, it is a he, I'm not being sexist) bobs and weaves around the ring, more often than not taking pot shots at your head. Controls are fairly simple up and down raise and lower your boxer's arms, effectively raising and lowering his guard as well as selecting between body and head punches. Left and right select between left and right hands and fire takes a swing. Get a hit, and your enemy's head rolls back with pain. eece Mex Oppone 40h Contender Stancet Right Pove Hand: Right Body Power A Stacks of strategy.

"Peviews SUPPLIER: SILMARILS. PRICE: AMIGA $44.95. REVIEWER: JULIAN RIGNALL. In 1983 the first laser disk arcade game appeared Sega's Astron Belf. Its mixture of real-life images, computer graphics and CD sound was hailed as revolutionary, even though the game wasn't particularly brilliant. A few months later laser disk technology was used to produce the first interactive cartoon game, Dragon's Lair. It looked and sounded incredible, Dirk the daring... Don't get slimed. There's singe! but unfortunately the gameplay was restrictive. All the player had to do was push the joystick in the right direction or press the fire button at the right time to continue to the next sequence; failure to do so resulted in an often humerous death sequence. Still, from this beginning It was hoped that the format would produce great things. Sadly this wasn't to be. William's Star Rider, a fabulous motorcycle race game, certainly showed what the laser disk was capable of producing, but the incredibly expensive machines were prone to frequent failure (especially in seaside resorts, where sand getting into the scanning equipment caused nothing but problems), and the format died out. Now Don Bluth, designer of the original game, has got together with Readysoft to produce an Amiga version of the game which fully captures the "

Awlright darlin' spirit of the classic arcade game. Unlike Software Project's version of Dragon's Lair(and the sequel Escape From Singe's Castle), where the game was recreated in a series of arcade-style screens, Readysoft have produced the game as you'd see it in the arcades like a cartoon! For those who never saw the arcade game, Dragon's Lair casts the player as Dirk Daring, a courageous knight out to rescue a beautiful princess from the clutches of Singe, a giant green dragon. And he's not jolly. The mission of mercy involves entering Singe's castle and avoiding a variety of hazards and monsters before finally confronting "


"VINSDRAGON'S The gargantuan price tag is also a major gripe. Even though there are six disks, the amount of actual gameplay is minimal. Dragon's Lair is a superb demonstration of the Amiga's graphics and in this vein, some scenes requiring multiple actions, and others just a well-timed press of the fire button. To squeeze a little more out of the game, some scenes are played twice, one normally, and the other a mirror image, so the opposite moves have to be used. Although Dragon's Lair looks and sounds absolutely incredible it's by far the most visually impressive computer game to date it has one serious flaw: it lacks lasting appeal. I admit that I thoroughly enjoy playing it, but the game is the same every time you play it, and once you know all the moves required to go through each scene it all becomes a matter of strict routine. Working out how to do each scene is a process of elimination, rather than skill, and it doesn't take very long to go all the way through the game. A Dirk's reward. sound potential It's just a shame that there isn't much of a game to play. AMIGA GRAPHICS 98% SOUND 94% VALUE 25% PLAYABILITY 36% OVERALL 51% UPDATE... There are plans to produce an 18-cassette Spectrum version... No only joking. An ST version might see the light of day, but otherwise there are no plans to produce Dragon's Lair for any other machines. If you want a version of Dragon's Lair, look up the old Software Projects game, especially Escape From Singe's Castle, which is particularly good. A Will true love prevail? "

"Mean Machines At last it's been revealed. Rumours suggested that the Konix console official name the Multi-System would be something special. But nothing could prepare us for how special! What Konix has done simply re-defines the idea of video games. Forget all those anonymous black and grey boxes with their bland joystick ports. Konix has listened to what games players and software houses really want and head man Wyn Holloway admits that he got a lot of input from letters to magazines, so somebody is listening Then he decided what price people would pay and told his engineers to design something that would meet all his criteria. The result is, quite simply. the answer to every games player's dreams. The Console The Multi-System looks more like a glorified joystick than a console. A horseshoe shaped base supports a tilting panel with a hub. You can attach a steering wheel to this or handlebars or a yoke control, of the sort found in helicopters whichever the game demands. But novel control doesn't stop there. On either side of The Konix hydraulic chair. Under the watchful eye of Julian Rignall, the Mean Machines column continues to get bigger and better. No less than six Sega games are reviewed, including R-Type, Rastan and Rampage, there's exclusive news of torthcoming Sega tities, and John Minson checks out the new Konix Multi-System console and gives his verdict. What more do you want? Konix Stripped the main unit are levers, to serve as accelerators, gear shifts and the like. And a separate unit contains twin pedals, so you're feet will have something to do while your hands are frantically steering your car, boat, plane... Of course there is a joystick port for traditionally controlled games. Another socket allows you to connecta key card, which supplies a total of thirty possible options. This means that the Multi-System is suited to everything from shoot'em ups to complicated simulations. Impressed? We've only just begun. The console features tactile feedback'. Put simply, that means that if your on-screen car rides into the rough, the steering wheel will shake about in your hands. Now that's something your C64 or even your Archimdes can't provide. And the cost of this mind boggling basic system. "

There are also some very nice set pieces, such as the scrolling 3D mazes which run under some cities. The save game facility comes in very handy during play, especially at the start of the game when Alis' feeble weapons are poor protection against some of the nastier beasts. On the whole, Phantasy Star offers pretty much everything a role-playing enthusiast could ask from a Sega. It has puzzles, battles, lots of interaction and a fair bit of depth. My only reservation about recommending it is its monumental price tag forty quid seems a lot to pay even if you do get a big game and a battery-backed memory system.
