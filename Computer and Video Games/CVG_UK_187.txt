"computer video games PAUL LAVIES CVG RATING SYSTEM 5 EXCELLENUE Bredeme aul is absolutely 'made up' at the moment, because one of his heroes has joined CVG. Also featuring in Paul's couped-up-in-a-bedroom lifestyle cur rently is a renewed love for classic old games. The Namco Museum series, and the Sega Ages CDs, have been in and out of his PlayStation and Saturn like cold toes at the seaside in Bridlington. Working in London's Docklands is a major exciting thing when you're Paul Davies too. The place is just like Space World and just as hard to get to. EIVE! Pure magic, enough to make a grown man cry. Every game which hits the High Five is essential. Let there be no doubt, this is depth and vision beyond belief. EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  FINAL FANTASY VII VAMPIRE HUNTER TEKKEN 3 PAC MAN GENE SHPIN RECO 4 ... VERY GOOD TO GUISE Usually the highest we feel confident awarding a game. Ranks among the best in its field, or surprises us with elements of well implemented originality. Something you may want to own, as opposed to renting out for a couple of days. Here is a quality, entertaining game to suit most tastes. Good, but not great. henever there's a craze for something, you can guarantee that Tom Guise is first in the queue for whatever this may be. Star Wars is the latest flame for CVG's Deputy dog, and he's been munching crate loads of Walkers crisps just for the Tazos. There's also a sticker book somewhere on his desk, in which Tom has placed all the right stickers in all the wrong places. Now the most memorable scenes in Star Wars have taken on a humorous new meaning but only if you're being really sad. DEP EDITOR CURRENY FAV GAMES: -3...GOOD $ 0 12...

You'll be wanting to exchange this for something else straightaway. Save yourself the bother by avoiding in the first place. gnoring the fact that Jaime Smith now attends Quiz nights on a regular basis... Lots of respect is due to our premier design god this month of June. It may still be a mystery how our words and pictures somehow thrill the knickers off you each issue, but it's mostly due to the improbable artistic talent of the Smith. Hard Work is no stranger to Jaime either. In fact he has been known to join Jaime for tea and biscuits on occasion. Sometimes even staying the night, while Jaime finishes another masterpiece.

Oz is the closest thing there is to Disney incarnate he loves all types of games, and his sole purpose in life is to make children happy. Now you may think that there is some cruel joke on its way now, but it just wouldn't stick Oz is too nice a guy. That said, playing Follow The Leader with Oz at parties is not a safe idea. CVG'S EFFIN H-CORE INNIT!!! ASS. ART EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  TEKKEN 3  X-WING VS TIE FIGHTER QUAKE DIE HARD TRILOGY  SOUL BLADE Only those who know Ozmond Browne well will appreciate that headline. And you will get to know Oz well, because he is now a full-time member of CVG! Yes the man with a mouth big enough to swallow our entire solar system is Jaime Smith's right-hand man from now on. Which is awesome, and we'll tell you why. Oz Browne created the look of the original (and best) Mean Machines magazine, back in 1990, and continued to modify its visual clout throughout the magazine's heyday, until Mean Machines split to become Nintendo Magazine System and Mean Machines Sega. Oz stuck with Sega, helping sell Sonic to the masses. A worthy cause. Recently Oz has been involved with the launch of two PlayStation magazines, but fate has decreed, that CVG (the place where Mean Machines grew up) gets Ozmond Browne at his peak. We're ecstatic to have THE AMAZING NEW CONSOL him on board! Just wait and watch CVG evolve some more into someMACHINES thing beyond incredible (Jaime handled the incredible part, MEGADRIVE with Mike's help). Becoming skilled at competitive games like Quake, Virtua Fighter, and Rage Racer takes a lot of practice. There's a marked difference between a pro' and a novice. If video games were to become a recognised sport, this could lead to more meaningful Coverage on TV and a better image all round. Good idea? Bad idea? If you think Video Games should become a sport send a postcard to this address: I'M A CONTENDER FOR THE GOLD MEDAL EL LOMAS ecently acknowledged as the crowned Princess of CVG, due to his beautiful flowing locks and beguiling facial expressions over breakfast. Ed also has a new name Wendy. This makes little sense to any one outside the nightmare world of CVG production, but when you're on the inside it's a scream. Mind you anyone can appreciate that Ed is quite beautiful. Some days he looks like a young Barbara Streisand, around the time she did Funny Girl.

"THE BIRTH OF A CRAZ TWISTEN TAP TWISTED TAM-TP GOTCHI ID computer video games Hungry DO Tamagotchi is the brainchild of one Aki Maita, an employee in Bandai Japan's toy division. Exploring ideas about combining pets and toys, she became influenced by the popularity of miniature electronic gadgetry such as cellular phones and pagers, and came up with the idea of the hyper interactive digital pet! From there, it took two years to create the concept and another again to program it. Surprisingly, she says the most difficult part of the development process was designing the egg-shaped casing. Bandai put together 30 different prototype designs and polled high school girls in Shibuya, Tokyo's main shopping and entertainment district. The simplistic, stylised look of the on-screen creature is intentionally clumsy looking, designed so that young kids can easily draw and adore their own pet. When Maita presented the finished Tamagotchi to Bandai's sales division, they found it unattractive and raised concerns over its appeal to the targeted youngsters Since its unanimous success though, they're now pleading for an increase in production numbers!

"computer video games NEWS O NINTENDO CO 2 64-BIT SEGA CONSOLE L TO FEATURE 3DFX? (64DD WILL HAVE MODEM! ith speculation rife about Sega working on a new console, latest evidence points to the possibility that it could feature 3DFX hardware! In April the 3DFX company filed a report to the Security and Exchanges Commission (the US equivalent of our Stock Market), asking permission to be turned into a public company. In simple jargon this means they want to sell shares of the company to the public. Naturally, in order to draw interest from potential investors, 3DFX needs to sell itself to its best capacity, and as such revealed some incredible information on its current projects. Among them is a reference to the company's Banshee project, a new high-performance single chip 3D/2D graphic accelerator intended for PC and coin-ops. However, the most fascinating reference was to their involvement with Sega. As quoted by Next Generation Online, the report to the SEC says \"Voodoo Graphics technology is also the graphics architecture for the 3D media processor chipset that the company is developing for license to Sega Enterprises Ltd for use in Sega's next generation consumer home game console.\" A indication of some definite involvement with a new Sega console! We've spoken to Orchid (who distribute the 3DFX board in the UK) about this turn of events and they can neither confirm or deny the information, because they know nothing about it! Sega however, openly admit they've talked with 3DFX, as they have many other companies with regard to licensing new technology. However, they stress that any finalised plans about any future Sega console are way off, assuring us that no news will emerge in this year or even this financial year. In conclusion, they stated that anyone expecting an announcement at this year's E3 is going to be disappointed! WIN POD PRIZES/ SEGA & 3DFX in our Freeplay rumours this month, we mention the possibility of the Nintendo 64DD add-on having a phone-link. Now there's more information to substantiate that possibility. The word of Nintendo Company Ltd president, Hiroshi Yamauchi himself! In an interview with a weekly Japanese magazine, he talks of how the 64DD \"will allow users to replace the original characters in their games with new ones via modems and later, satellite communications. This is one reason why we chose to continue using cartridge as a medium, instead of CD-Rom which cannot be written over.\" With online gaming clearly the next step for mainstream gaming, the idea of a one-to-one phone linkup facility for the 64DD would seem perfect sense, adding new appeal to the N64 add-on. An option that Sega too is exploring with its NetLink. However, the concept of actually adding new sections to console games via a modem is also an exciting idea. And one that Nintendo are already implementing with their Satellaview link-up for the Super Famicom in Japan. Gamers can actually download new sections of Zelda 3 which are slotted into the game. A feature like this, with the huge writeable cache of 64DD has awesome potential, especially with DD Zelda currently set for release next March!

So please, no SAEs. o intendo 64 is the new machine on the block, and the mailbag has gone crazy with opinions either for or against. This is a telling period for dedicated players who may already have shelled out for a PlayStation or Saturn. So we're interested in what you have to say on this subject, having given N64 the time to form a qualified opinion. Also it's nice to know that our April Fools gags suckered so many readers. There are far too many boys out there who wanted the naked Lara Croft thing to work. We're embarrassed for you, we really are. Don't forget that a software prize of your choice goes out to the sender of the Star Letter each month. So always remember to include the name of the game and system with your mail. ANOTHER BORING LETTER SPICE GIRLS SHOCKER Dear CVG, There's something I don't understand. Mario is a great game. A 'Revelation'. You called it that yourselves, and I agree (I own it too). So how come on the month you got it it was your third favourite game of the month behind Quake and NIGHTS. You may as well have forgotten about it since. Only Jaime voted it the best game of 96, and that was joint with SF Alpha 2. Why is Quake always first on your most played game list since then? wouldn't think there was anything wrong with you liking Quake more than Mario 64, but if you do prefer it then why is Mario the revelation? Of course I may be completely wrong. Dan Miller, Chester USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES * Dear CVG, First of all, congratulations on your excellent magazine. It is by far and away the best source of information on video games money can buy. Now that the formalities have been done I'd like to get on with what I've really written to you to say: ARE YOU BLIND?!!! How dare you put Mel C in front of Victoria in your CVG survey of the Spice Girls. I almost died when I saw this! Have you seen the state of Mel C? I've seen better looking camels than the thing you placed in front of the sexiest woman on the face of the Earth. Her nose curls up to such an extent when she smiles that even pigs get jealous. I'm sure that there are many people who like Emma and Gerri and that's fine but Mel C. There's nothing wrong with any of the others it's just that I can't think of any one sane person on the face of this planet who would find her even slightly more attractive than Posh spice. I'm not normally the type of person to write letters that sound like something from a kids magazine because I'm huge video games fan but it's just that I find Mel C completely disgusting. Was this a misprint? Keep up the good work as I am sure you will. Mr Bus, Area 51 PSI strongly advise that you get some taste in women before you try anything like that again. Thank you and have a nice day. CVG: Mario 64 is a revelation, as it changes so much of what we previously expected from video games. As a one-player experience it has no peers. But as a group of people who spend a lot of time playing video games, the CVG staff find the competition element of games more appealing. This is why Quake and NIGHTS are so popular. The Score Attack feature in NIGHTS is almost endless, so is always a fun challenge. Quake death matches take up too much of our time. CVG: We'd just like to stress that (00 the opinions of Mr Bus are in no way similar to those of our own. Does anyone else have something to say on this matter? OVER EXCITED WRITES  Nintendo HURRAH! HURRAH! HURRAH! SET Dear CVG, Three cheers for Nintendo for making not only the best games machine ever but also the best game ever: Mario 64. If I was to review it I would give it 99%. Everything about it oozes with quality. The graphics are coloured and detailed. The sound is excellent, especially the speech of Mario. And as for the gameplay, it's as perfect as a video game will ever get. There are loads of simple moves to do, the ideas are excellent and original from racing Koopa, to turning into a T-1000 and taking a baby penguin to its mother. The game is huge and it will be staying in my N64 for a long time. Shigeru Miyamoto should be bloody proud of such an excellent game. And if there is anyone who doesn't own it, go out and buy it fools!!! Andrew Martin, Woking, Surrey Dear CVG, I am writing in response to the letter you published in issue #184 by Oliver from London. Why not take the \"Your Game\" idea a step further? As well as suggesting amendments to games to be included in their sequels, people should be encouraged to put forward whole game concepts. Admittedly some people may feel reluctant to share a potentially marketable idea, but the laws of plagiarism guard against their exploitation. Anyway, how likely is it that such ideas will ever otherwise have a chance to be presented to the game designers? Plus, in the long term, this is the best way in which we, as computer and console owners, can help ourselves to get games which we want, not the games which the designing firms think we want. Don't get me wrong Tekken 2 and Quake are all-time classics, but surely we are reaching the stage where, no matter how realistic the graphics, no matter how funky the soundtrack, we need original games. A continual rehash of one-on-one beat 'em ups, first-person perspective shoot 'em ups, racing games et al will not suffice. Eventually, the ultimate game for each of the (somewhat limited amount of) typical existing genres will be born: there will be no need for any more games of that ilk. The computer and console games markets will stagnate. I say: go for this opportunity to express our ideas. Seize the day! The future is now! Now is the time to break the shackles which ensnare the games market! We shall unite, and overthrow the despotic overlords of the silicon empire! We shall... Sorry. Most importantly, take note of what I'm saying. Express your opinions; the computer/video games market is there for us. Sam Giddings, Croydon CVG: Ahh, the voice of a satisfied games player is always a pleasure to acknowledge. The world needs more Andrew Martins. (OO CVG: There are original games out there, Sam. Just that the mass market keeps most of them at arms length. NIGHTS should've been a million seller, but too many people didn't take time out to understand it. Blast Corps for N64 is original. Let's see what you make of that. 14 "


"LESS IS MORE computer Video games BAG I think Oliver's idea about a \"Your Game\" section is brilliant. I'm sure that anyone who plays a game thinks about what could make it better. In Soul Edge why have two character endings when you could have six, one given for how well you completed the game. Why have eight weapons per character when you could have 16 or even 32? That would keep you playing the game for longer. They could also put in that when you get the lost weapon you get to play a demo of an upcoming game. As well as just games you could tell a company what they're doing wrong. Like telling Squaresoft to release their games over here without us having to wait a year or longer, otherwise we'll go and bomb their headquarters. We could tell Nintendo that we want to play their games without having to wait ridiculously huge amounts of time. We could tell other companies to do competitions like Namco did which let people design a costume for a character. Another thing. David in the last issue said that Wipeout 2097 is the only good game on the PlayStation. He's either plain thick or has only played Wipeout 2097. Mustapha Abbas, Ilford ...................................... STAR LETTER MONEY TO MAKE A BONFIRE! CVG: Doubt that Squaresoft would respond favourably if we bombed their HQ. Show some 00 respect, Mustapha! It would be nice for overseas publishers to consider the rest of the world when they run design competitions though. Finding the right balance in a game to make it play well is not as simple as adding more features. Action movies wouldn't be any better if they lasted for six hours instead of an hour and a half, and would get confusing if there was more than one super villain and twice the number of heroes. Same goes for video games. COPYRIGHT ED LOMAS THE EAGLE EYES OF A TRUE CVG READER Dear CVG, Ha! Well done. I must admit that your April Fools jokes are very good this year! Firstly the Tomb Raider cheat. I mean, wiggle the pad to \"Wannabe\"! How stupid. I bet you just got the pictures off the internet, as you can. I hear the \"Make Lara Croft Naked\" cheat was something that Core removed, and didn't leave in for the actual game. Secondly your Ultimate Fighting Universe game. As good as it sounds there was one flaw, which I assume you put in. One of the characters of the many seen is 'Pedro'. He was supposedly the secret character that Gamesmaster reported last year that appears in Mortal Kombat. And as there are no other people in the screen I reasoned that this was an April Fool. I should like to say well done thought as the screen shots are cool and well mixed! Andrew Nicholas, Herts Dear CVG, You have my commiserations on your failed April Fool attempt that was Ultimate Fighting Universe. Nice try, you had me fooled for a while long enough for me to write to Sega Saturn Magazine and ask if it was true. I'm going to look a bit of a tit if they print it. Thanks. What gave it away? Pedro, your hidden Mortal Kombat character from last April. It wasn't until I saw him and then checked when the next issue was out (I thought it was too early for an April Fool) that I realised. Better luck next year. Gavin Bleasley, Belle Isle Dear CVG, I was one of the few people who managed to buy an N64 on March 1st without having first reserved myself a machine in advance. I bought Mario 64 with the machine, and after playing it I've got to say, \"believe the hype\". Mario in 3D is truly an exceptional experience. Soon afterwards I rented Turok from a video store and again I was amazed, no other machine I've seen can come close to the graphical capabilities of the N64. You would expect that I am more than happy with my purchase. Wrong. What the heck are Nintendo and THE Games playing at! Look at the prices of N64 games:  Mario,  Shadows Of The Empire, and the most ridiculous  Turok! Do Nintendo expect their machine to be owned only by lottery winners? Sure, I forked out sixty quid on Mario 64, but it seems that most games will match or exceed the  price of it. Console owners have always had to pay high prices for their games. Yes I think that  (the average for a new title) is expensive, but at least it is expected. Of course 1 realise that cartridges are more expensive to produce than CDs, and I don't expect Nintendo to be able to match Sony with its Platinum range of games. All I expect are reasonable and affordable prices for my games. If prices stay this way, the next time I'll be buying another game it'll be from the bargain buckets when the N128 supersedes the N64. I hope CVG shares my view that N64 owners are being asked to pay far, far too much and will print my letter to highlight this problem. I have written to THE Games to complain about the N64 game prices and I would ask that other disgruntled N64 owners do the same. It is now possible to buy a PlayStation with NINE (Platinum Range) games for the price of the N64 with Mario. Slightly Peeved, Crawley Down, West Sussex * USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES CVG: Aw, shucks. You're just too cool to fool Andrew Nicholas. By the way Pedro was invented by Ed Lomas, not some guy on Gamesmaster magazine! CVG: We got you Bleasley! Why don't you just admit it! ULTIMATE FIGHTER SELECT 200 BUM Were you one of the brain-dead people to have fallen for our blatant April Fools gags? PAUL PEDRO Woah! Can't wait to play as Pedro in this new Ultimate Fighting Univer... Hey! OBVIOUSLY SOME KIND OF MISTAKE Dear CVG, What happened to the 32-bit handheld thing from Nintendo? Everything's gone quiet on that front. Please, please, please tell me I wasn't dreaming when I saw the news about Ultimate Fighting Universe. If it's true I'm going to bet it'll sell amazingly well. In fact I intend to buy a N64 to play it.. I'd like to say to anyone who thinks this mag's biased then don't buy it. The reason you buy a mag is because you want an opinion from someone who knows their stuff. Ed Lomas and Jaime Smith know more about games than anyone else in England so I think they should be joint Editors of the mag. Liam Irving, St Leonards-on-sea Stal137 CVG: Liam Irving's opinion lost its integrity quite early on in his letter. Can you spot where, readers? Would you trust CVG to these people? They wouldn't trust it to themselves! As for Nintendo's 32-bit handheld, we're just as baffled as you. More news on that if and when it happens. 15 "


"computer video games AND THE MORAL OF THE WARM. WARMER. HOT! STORY IS...? HOT! HOT! Dear CVG, I am writing to inform you of the terrible marking system of Blockbuster Video on their games in the Spring 1997 edition of \"Take One\". I was looking on the inside back cover and reading about the PS/Saturn game Area 51. This game is world-renowned for its overall crapness, yet Blockbuster gave it a whopping 91%! This must be a crime, giving a s**t game an excellent mark just for their own financial gain. They shouldn't be able to get away with misleading the public without whom they wouldn't be a leading video chain. Chris Reynolds, Broomhill HEALTH AMMO 100 193 2002 Dear CVG, I love video games. Let's get that one thing straight. But I have a few concerns regarding these big PC to console conversions, ie Quake and Duke Nukem 3D. One of the main reasons that these games are so popular is that they are almost completely customisable and get loads of add on packs to go with them, like level designers and shareware demos, etc. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but won't they lose some of their appeal in the conversion process? NIGHTS went some way towards bridging this gap with Christmas NIGHTS although it's not so much an add on as a spin off. So then, what say you on this matter? I'd like to know if the companies have any plans to release costume customisers with these releases and the like. Please find out what you can. Craig Ward, Woodhall Spa Duke 3D is coming to the consoles, but will it offer the same excitement as on PC? 16 35 2110 10x2 CVG: Suppose this is Blockbuster's way of convincing you to \"Try it, before you buy it.\" RAW UNEDITED COMIC GENIUS CVG: Patches used to expand games like POD and Quake are the internet's reserve. They require a PC to happen, unfortunately. Console versions of Quake require 'modifications' to be effective and not all of these are good news. Ahh, Christmas NIGHTS! Genius incarnate. Dear CVG, I've got a new idea for a computer game. It is about a yellow boy who is skinny and is bald. You have to shoot him. He has no friends and people beat him up. It has two players. Thank you very much! John and Rog (he is my friend) PS My friend Rog loves you and if you don't put this in your mag I will get my big dog to eat your legs and bite your face. Will you be my friend?

USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES * Dear CVG, The point I want to comment on is the new 'retro' craze. Like all old gamers I'm always referring back to old games, but I'm sorry, time goes on and old games get crapper. Admittedly they can be good starting points for new games, but I think 'The Shady One' is going a tad OTT. Still plays on his C64. Hmm! Have you played a console game in the past 10 years? Games do get better. In terms of retro gaming the memory is much, much better than the reality. Lee Toboln WHY WOULD WE MAKE THIS ONE UP? And we'd just like to thank Craig Ward for another excuse to feature Christmas NIGHTS! CVG: Sometimes. WHAT DOES BANDAI BODE FOR SEGA? Dear CVG, I used to read you magazine back in the early 80s (amazing Spectrum coverage) and unfortunately I stopped buying it when the 16-bit consoles took off, however after buying a PlayStation I picked up a copy from my local newsagents and took a look inside. One thing amazed me almost immediately. It wasn't the quality of the reviews, nor the news section, not even the twisted sense of humour. The thing that impressed me the most was tucked away inside the grubby-looking (yet still high quality) FreePlay section. Of course I am referring to Dave Kelsall's Retro Computer Cabin. Since then my PlayStation has remained practically untouched as I have been scouring the junk shops in search of old systems, and my wages have been blown buying Intellivisions, 2600s, Vectrex's, PC Engines, Spectrums, Master Systems, and all sorts of other cak from my misspent youth. I would just like to say thank you for rekindling some forgotten memories and ask if it would be possible to print some of the old cheat codes or these games as some of them are impossibly hard. Finally there is a lot of argument over which is the best console at the moment. Well this is an easy question as anyone who has played River Raid or Keystone Kapers on the VCS will know. It has the added advantage of being cheap as well. Mine set me back just  and it had 16 games with it. Keep up the good work. Chris Cartland, Radford Semele Dear CVG, What have Sega done to us? I know the losses of the past year are many, but they could get up again by themselves. And how can Sega possibly have a good 1997 since they don't have the upper hand in this whole merge. Although Bandai is the dissolving company merging into Sega, it's their president that is appointed president of the new formed company while Sega's leader Nakayama is vice president. Also on the shares deal Sega is losing again. And how about those ridiculous but strong rumours that want Bandai producing a game they've always wanted to do on PlayStation and N64 Virtua Fighter. Can it be that Bandai, now having Sega's license, start making games on other formats except the Saturn? Please, as always, tell us what you know. Anastasis Antoniou, Cyprus SUT CVG: Far be it for us to predict the future, but the chances of Virtua Fighter appearing on anything other than a Sega machine are nil. Some properties are sacred, especially when they are First Party titles. The VF series is as at least as precious as Sonic to Sega. CVG: How many more retro gamers are out there? We need to know! 16  Sega "

"computer Video games CESA PRESENTS SEGA FOKY GAM1997 If you could only visit one booth luno at the Tokyo Game Show it had TILSEUM to be Sega's. They had much to prove in the light of Sony's increasing success, and fortunately had the most to say. Throughout the day some of Japan's greatest game designer/programmers were live on stage to talk about their latest projects. And what a line up they had! Without a doubt some of the most impressive games coming out this year in Japan will be on the Sega Saturn. Just like Sega's stage theme said «THIS IS COOL!\". The even better news is that Sega Europe have the choice of these releases planned for UK before Christmas. These were the main game announcements 1997 PROJECT SONIC: (SEGA) Release June This was the biggest news at the show. Despite gossip that Project Sonic was the name of Sonic Team's next game, it is in fact something much bigger! Project Sonic is a major project throughout the whole of Sega and will involve much more than simply just another new game. Mr Yuji Naka, creator of Sonic, was at the show to explain a little about this new project. SONIC JAM! TOKYO GAME SHOW '97 REPORT! TOKYOGAMESHOW Our ever-lasting quest to find the greatest games in all the world led us to Japan once more. Who has the coolest titles of them all? The Tokyo Game Show report has the answers. he Tokyo Game Show Spring '97 was held at the \"Tokyo Big Site\" from Friday, April 4th to Sunday, April 6th. As possibly the largest computer game show in the world there were over 100 companies exhibiting a total of 500 titles. Of these almost all were playable on the 1,200 consoles available for those lucky enough to get in. Over 120,000 gamers managed to make it despite the pouring rain and the mile-long queues. Phase one of Project Sonic is Sonic Jam a compilation of the original Sonic games, pre sented with a new 3D Sonic World. The games included are Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic and Knuckles. However these aren't simple ports, there have been several improvements. For example there is a Time Attack on every stage. The Spin Dash can be done even on Sonic 1, and there's a cool option where you can just play the special stages. Sega's innovative \"Lock-On System\" (which used the extra cart to add more stages to all the Sonic games) is also included. SEGA TOURING CAR CHAMPIONSHIP: (SEGA) Release Autumn CULDCEPT: (OMIYA SOFT) Release Autumn FEATURE An new original board-game gets a new lease of life on Saturn. LOL This was not playable at the show as it's only 5% done. Sega claim it should be ready for the E3 show in America. Though it isn't known who is doing the Saturn conversion, we know that the assistant producer in charge of the project is from AM ANNEX, who did the original. So that bodes very well indeed! Culdcept is a fantasy boardgame based on the increasingly popular trading card system for 1-4 players. With over 300 cards available, eight computer controlled opponents with Al, beautiful animated graphics, and full orchestral score, this game has been well received by Japan's gaming community. Though the game is quite involved, the basics are simple: Three types of card; creature, spell, and item. By \"rolling the dice\" you move the required number of squares until you land on the final square. You either fight, trade, or some other action depending on the type of encounter or event you are in, and type of square. FR: 20 (c) SEGA ENTERPRISES 1997 "

This was about 88% complete at the show. Two towards the end of the year. Can Sonic renew the excitement the world once had about Sega? We believe that he can. But it's going to be another lo-ong wait! Expect more news at E3. A 30% playable version was available for lucky gamers willing to battle their way along the queues. For those who couldn't, an equally exciting live action video featuring all the game characters battling using real weapons on the screen, main stage. Even at this early point the Saturn conversion is progressing excellently. Up to now AM3 have been concentrating on the visuals and complex algorithms for weapon collision. They have stated that there will be original SS modes, though they have yet to decide whether they wish to include any new characters.

"computer Video games AZEL: PANZER DRAGOON RPG: (TEAM ANDROMEDA) Summer -Release SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT The third part of the epic Dragoon trilogy is coming and it looks like being the best yet! Although not playable at the show, Azel (it's gonna be called Panzer Dragoon Saga in the UK) was one of the most eagerly anticipated games there. Crowds watched in awe at the incredible video sequences on the running demo stand. Though all the pictures that have been released show mostly fighting scenes, this is because the developers are concentrating on this part of the system at this time. However this game is a true RPG, with various items to collect, problems to solve, and multiple plots to follow. GAM997 Straight from winning his CESA Academy Awards, super star Parappa was joined by Crash Bandicoot for an allstar line up of celebrity Intelligent Cube! Long after their games were released SCE are continuing the promotion of these two in the hope that they'll one day rival Mario and Sonic. Certainly you get the feeling that they just might succeed when you see the crowds cheering them on! Besides the cuddly twosome, SCE had some topnotch games lined up as well: GHOST IN THE SHELL: (PS) Release Summer This was the biggest game for SCE at the show. Queues were deep as could be, and filled the booth to the extent that you couldn't get to play some of the other games! Based on a very popular Japanese animation OVA, this game is bound to do well over here, but unlikely to be released outside Japan. In essence it's just another 3D action shooting game with loads of original digital anime sequences thrown in. However this license alone is practically permission to print money! We're not certain whether players will have full control over these sections. The full majesty of the awesome Panzer series should be realised in Azel! . EEE TOKYO GAME SHOW «97 REPORT! Team Andromeda are concentrating on the flight sections at the moment. Wonder where this is leading? Panzer Dragoon had a scene like this... BELUDESELUBA WAR CHRONICLES: (PS) Release 18th April It appears that exploration sections are presented in real time, just like Shining The Holy Ark. The Panzer Dragoon world' is extremely vivid. Fans will soon be able to learn its secrets! You can almost breath in the atmosphere of this small town. Or perhaps it's just dragoon poo... It has been in the making for quite some time, but War Chronicles finally made it to the finish line. It has been worth the wait. With an interesting mix of 2D RPG action and 3D flight sequences (this kind of style has become quite popular in Japan), Chronicles has a lot of variety in the gameplay. But unless you like both styles you end up with the feeling you only have half a game. Chronicles includes a lot of anime sequences too. FEATURE The battle system in Panzer RPG is rumoured to be turn based, like FFVII. Footage not shown here suggests that the berserker attack is included! LIBERO 22 (C) SEGA ENTERPRISES 1997.

"computer SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT video games Now that Kowloons Gate has finally been released, all eyes were on SME to what their next offering would be. Of course we all knew that it would be something special, but as always SME manage to surprise us with their ingenuity! KOWLOON'S GATE: (PS) Out Now Japan  199 An extremely dark, mysterious combination of realtime with point-and-click adventure. Kowloon's Gate is set in the future, and centres around the complex workings of the Kowloon Net a jumped-up version of the internet. Hours of incredible CG movie footage, and a scary plot are the two biggest draws. The fantastic Kowloon's Gate soundtrack is released on April 21st in Japan. 1 Hardcore internet 1 «Cor... hope nobody's users in future Kowloon. monitoring this stuff!\" GO FOR IT MORIKAWA-KUN NO.2: (PS) Release 23rd May Not quite sure whether SCE's new character is capable of making the grade compared to Parappa, but if raising a baby robot in the Tamagochi style is your thing this could be the game for you! There are different worlds and robot personalities available and that all-important Artificial Intelligence. Who knows? 1 Does his mother know how long he spends on this thing! LAGUNAKYULU: (PS) Release Summer TOKYO GAME SHOW '97 REPORT! SEL BABY UNIVERSE: (PS) Release 20th June This is one hot RPG we've been keeping our eye on for some time. Everything in the game is generated by polygons, scenery, objects and characters. This means you can freely rotate the screen around as much as you like, to get the best view to explore with. The beautiful graphics are very realistic and the game scrolls in all directions with unbelievable smoothness. The attention to detail is also incredible with all sorts of moving objects on screen such as the blades of a wind pump turning around. All the characters' movements were constructed with motion-capture, so whether your character jumps, runs up the stairs, or fights they always look life-like. 1 Come Summer, gamers in Japan will have access to this awesome world. This is even weirder than Depth or Parappa the Rapper (which is really saying something). This 'game' is basically a 3D kaleidoscope generator. The most appealing aspect is that once the game is loaded you can open up your PS and stick in your favourite music CD, thus messing around with visuals to your top tunes! The main feature of Lagunakyulu is the Memory-card Battle System (MBS). With this feature you can save your characters to your memory card, fight with your friend's characters, and even swap characters. Each player builds up their own characters in their own way. While one person may have a great Wizard and a poor Thief, your friend may have a weak Cleric and a powerful Ranger. By swapping your characters with your friends you can build up the strongest party possible. Though you may clear all the stages the game never ends. DAM DAM STOMPLAND: (PS) Release Autumn FEATURE ALUNDRA: (PS) Release 11th April Japanese gamers have been building up to this release for quite some time. Despite the FFVIIs of the world, you can't just beat a good spite-based RPG for that authentic \"ancient quest\" feel. Boasting a map over 7,000 screens in size and over 1,400 different motion patterns this is one for serious RPGers out there! Jump on somebody's shadow to make that person fly off to never-never land! Whoever does the stamping gets larger, making it easier for people to jump on their shadow. According to SME this is a first in gaming history, and we're inclined to agree. Action takes place in Stomp Land where the jumping makes the \"DAM DAM\" noise of the title. There, are a variety of strange places such as a factory, a sweet country, or Mars! Some of your opponents are robots, but there's also the deadly Mr. Yamada as well (?) so you better take care! You really need to play this game to appreciate its finer qualities. 1 You wanted original. Dam Dam Stomp Land is it! "


"OCKMA computer Video games * CAPCOM SOHALARDALES BIOHAZARD: SS Summer Release ERSARY A 50% complete version was on display and it was looking pretty hot indeed. SS owners shouldn't have anything to complain about when they finally get hold of this! bo Capcom's booth was the second best booth at the show (nobody was going to beat Warp's booth this year!). Designed around the theme of Rockman, Capcom payed tribute to their star character's 10th Anniversary SLY GAM4.997 HOMAGE TO ROCKMAN! Rockman first debuted way back on December 17th, 1987 on the Famicom. Since then he's spawned several series: Rockman World and Rockman X, along with various special Rockman games such as Rockman's Soccer, and Rockman Battle and Chase. He's managed to make a name for himself from the arcade to home console, from the Famicom to the PlayStation and although there's still no news on when or how he may make it to the N64, Capcom are making sure he's kept busy with a stream of new PS and Saturn releases coming soon. ROCKMAN X4: (PS, SS) Summer Release No visual difference between SS and PS Resident Evil. Gameplay is expected to change slightly though. BREATH OF FIRE III (PS) Release Schedule Undecided The best Rockman game yet. Incredibly detailed back grounds and super smooth animation really make this some thing special. There are two characters to choose from. 'X' and 'Zero'. Depending on your choice the story, action and ending are different. Choose from two types of 'Ride Armour': 'Fighter' and Air Bike'. BOF3 finally makes it to the PS with major improvements in every area! Sound, graphics and action have all been upgraded to make use of the PS's superior hardware. As a result BOF3 comes with spectacular textured-mapped 3D polygons which can be rotated in real time with a dynamic view-point camera. This is one summer release all RPG fans in Japan should be looking forward to. TOKYO GAME SHOW -97 REPORT! And you thought it was all over! No, Rockman is back, with all his old friends! > Colossal Bosses such as this one make you glad of 32-bit power. Breath of Fire III has a great storyline. A mine cart section? Surely not, Capcom...?! ROCKMAN BATTLE AND CHASE: (PS) Out now in Japan BIOHAZARD 2: (PS) End of year Release All of the most popular Rockman characters are back for a fighting race game where attacking rivals is just as important as overtaking them. Various tune-up options allow you to upgrade your car's capabilities. Capcom have a special Rockman Grand Prix Challenge competition for those who fancy their racing skills in May! SUPER ADVENTURE ROCKMAN: (PS, SS No new news here we're afraid, though Capcom were running a video showing action from their current version. Most of the action has been seen in the press for quite some time now. Nevertheless, it still drew a lot of attention from the public, as it was the first time they had been able to see it running. And it does look impressive! A combination of high quality animation and gripping adventure game action. There are three stories containing a total of 90 minutes of original anime. Depending on your choices at certain points in the story there are different events and plots. Over 20 boss characters make an appearance!

"BUSHIDO BLADE: (PS) Out Now Japan computer Video games SQUARE Square's excellent sword fighting game was very popular at the show, despite having already been released, so not everyone could've bought copy. Either that or they were only after one of those desired stickers. Once again, Squares booth was hopelessly too small to cope with the masses who swarmed over their games on offer. As queues lengthened it became difficult to work out exactly just which game one was queueing for, as this time Square had six playable games available. Unlike their give-away CD-ROM last time, Square were giving out a special memory card case and seal collection to each person who played four of the six games. All you had to do was play a game and you'd receive a special sticker for that game. Collect four of them and go up to the give-away desk, present your stickers and there you'd go one free case! One wrong move and it's game over in Square's strategic fighter. AIN UWIN TOBAL 2: (PS) Release 25th March 1 WIN COM This is the game everybody wanted to play! With national advertising in full swing most of Japan is gasping to get their hands on one of the hottest games this spring. With even better graphics, new detailed backdrops and smoother animation, Dream Factory have pulled out all the stops to make this game a real classic. In particular, the dungeon exploration mode is now big enough to be a game in it's own right! DWIN O WIE O WIN O WIN O WIN ou Oh W. CO TOKYO GAME SHOW '97 REPORT! Polygon fighters with detail to rival the biggest arcade titles. Recognise that weird yellow bird on the right? Yep, a Chocobo! POWER STAKES: (PS) Release 11th March FINAL FANTASY IV: (PS) Out Now Japan Until Derby Stallion hits the PS you could do worse than this. Power Stakes is the first title from the Aques label. No news on their car racing game though. Despite being finished Square were obviously keeping this game's presence quiet. I'm not surprised as it doesn't really seem to fit in with their other genres! This is of course the updated and improved PS version of the famous Super Famicom (SNES) game of the same name. Although the graphics are nothing compared to FFVII the gameplay is rock-solid, so if you never played the original, give it a go (providing you read Japanese). It has a new opening CG movie as well! PUP 2 7 1099\" 1124 FINAL FANTASY TACTICS: (PS) Release 13th June SAGA FRONTIER: (PS) Release 11th July If FF VII is an action RPG and FF Tactics is a simulation RPG then by rights Saga Frontier should be an adventure RPG. Just quite when RPGs got broken up into all these categories escapes us, but the bottom line is this one adventure that you need to play. As the last release of the big name games we're going to waiting until summer for this one, but it'll be worth it! Square's main stage attraction was the appearance of two of Japan's legendary game pros, Bun Bun Maru and Shinjuku Jacky. They were on hand to show their skills at Tobal 2 during the special events scheduled throughout the day. Square's one major announcement at the show was that of Front Mission: Alternative. The latest in the FM series is set to appear on the PS and features an entirely new look with 3D texture mapped polygons replacing the SFC's sprites. One other major difference is that it is now real-time as well, making it a realistic simulation game. The game is set a little before the previous two FM games and is based on the African continent. FEATURE The opening CG movie alone is good enough to justify the price of this game. However, good old Square have thrown in this simulation RPG as well, just to give something to do afterwards. It's not going to be quite so easy to get into as FF VII unless you're fluent in Japanese, but with any luck there'll be an English version out by the end of this year or the beginning of next. 25 "


"computer video games namco ACE COMBAT 2: (PS) Release 30th May Although Namco have plenty of great PS games coming soon it was obvious that they wanted everyone to know that Tekken 3 is coming to the PS. Several arcade machines were there to play and there were several T3 stage events. However, no firm dates have been set for when it will appear on the PlayStation. Although the game has obviously progressed considerably since our PS Show report there were no major changes in the game play or graphics. However, they've added more planes and missions since we last play tested it so there were a lot more things to play with this time around. It's looking really great and there were quiet a few people crowded around this game despite the Tekken 3 excitement. It's obviously best played with the twin analogue joystick/pad for best results. CSIGAM 1997 TIME CRISIS: (PS) Release 27th June This game had the longest queues of all Namco's titles at the show and was obviously everyone's favourite. It's difficult to see what Namco have left to do on this game before its release but let's hope they're adding lots of great new PS specific features like they did with Soul Edge. Your dream will come true. The plane ahead is ENORMOUS! Expect the terrain, such as that island, to look fantastic!

While Capcom took advantage of the PS's polygon capabilities when upgrading their \"Breath of Fire\" series from the SFC, Namco are sticking with sprites for this latest adventure in the «Tales of\" series. While the loss of dynamic viewpoints may upset some there's no doubting that polygons can never match sprites for beauty and the one thing that Tod definitely is, is beautiful!

It's a gun game (which Sega's Mighty Hits was a poor copy of) with masses of different mini gun challenges. Although it's an arcade port, there will be a PS original mode and a two player option as well. Although not as graphical cool as Time Crisis, Gun Bullet is hugely popular in Japan and the Point Blank machines in the Namco Wonderpark are big favourites of some CVG members.

But having seen the result we now know why. This game is going to be one of the hottest ever! DUNGEON KEEPER GET TUNNELLING! DUNGEON KEEPER THE GAME FOR POWER FIENDS! he last time we covered Dungeon Keeper was exactly a year ago in our June  issue. Back then the game looked set to be completed within the month, with Bullfrog promising a full unveiling at the Summer E3. But the finished game never surfaced, taken as it was, back into intensive development. Normally this is the sign of a game in trouble, but even then Dungeon Keeper looked guaranteed to be awesome. No, in this case the game's creator, Bullfrog supremo Peter Molyneux, wanted to make sure his latest project was perfect... at any cost! That cost has been this extra year of work, and incredibly the already fantastic game has been improved tenfold. Of course after such a hefty wait, people are expecting a lot from Bullfrog. But take it from us, no matter how high expectations are, Dungeon Keeper is on course to deliver. This could prove to be one of the best games ever made! Getting your dungeon started is easy enough. You begin with a single antechamber and a couple of faithful imps. By clicking on an area, you can order them to start mining for gold the currency used to pay the minions of evil! Next you need to get them to dig out a treasure room to store the gold. After this, building a hatchery is important. This spawns cute little chicks the essential food of your servants. The final starting step is an entrance. Now more monsters can start coming to your dungeon! Your beginner dungeon. Before long it'll look like this! Get that hero away from my treasure hoard! ZOUR TICKET TO ULTIMATE POWER! The single-player map. As you progress the realm begins to decay! How many games have you played where you're the rugged hero, breaking into a evil villain's stronghold to steal their treasure, kill their minions and eventually destroy them? Yeh, well this game is different. You get to be the villain, you get to build the underground labyrinth, you get to nurture the minions and you get to kill those stupid punk heroes. That's the concept behind Dungeon Keeper. From a basic viewpoint, this might just sound like a Command & Conquer clone. But in the hands of the man who invented god games (with Populous), it's the ultimate power-lust fix! You really are the master of your own domain! MASTERY OVER OTHERS! Fun as Dungeon Keeper will be in single-player mode, it has the potential for awesome multiplayer appeal. Realising this, Bullfrog are going to concentrate on an online version immediately on completing the normal game. And their plans look set to rival Quakeworld. The chance to construct your own dungeon server and have other players enter it as heroes. Or for each player to build a dungeon, and then dig through to each others to steal kill and conquer. Alternatively just enter a preset dungeon as heroes and play deathmatches against each other! 28 "


"computer video games LOOKS WICKED! ZERO THE HEROK In the extra year of development, Bullfrog have improved the visuals massively. The user interface and menus are now more practical (and with regard to the excellent pointer, more satisfying) than ever. Although the superb 3D caverns were light-sourced before, the effects are even more improved. Sorcerous smoke and coloured fire laps up from newly constructed rooms. Best of all, when you go inside a creature, each one has its own eyesight. Flies see in compound vision, dragons have smoky translucency and dogs see in black-and-white. So when does the hero-killing come in? As soon as one starts digging its way in! You can actually hear the chipping echoing around in stereo, to help you locate where they're coming in. Once they breach your dungeon you need to send your stronger minions against them. Alternatively, you can take them on face-to face... ROM A stinkin' hero in your dungeon, killing your imps. But he doesn't know you are inside one of them! Smoky dragon vision ahoy! And that's your breath! THE EVIL EYE! MINDLESS SERVANTS? One aspect Bullfrog have spent a massive amount of time perfecting is the incredible Al. Each individual creature has their own behaviour. The imps when digging can tend to slack off, even stopping for a smoke. Slapping them around with the evil-hand pointer) soon gets them on their feet again. On pay-day they immediately sneak off to collect their wages from the treasure room. Fail to feed your creatures properly and they start eating each other spiders munching on flies. Of course, being evil you can punish them. Stick an screaming imp in the torture chamber and the others work fearfully. So advanced is the Al, the programmers have even witnessed unforeseen behaviour patterns. When they created hell-hounds, for example, they suddenly found them befriending the wizards, following them faithfully! The greatest single factor that sets DK apart from any other resource management game is the ability to possess any of your servants. Once inside them, you can steer around Quake style and take on the enemy using any powers the creature you're in possesses. Alternatively you can just perform standard duties digging if you're an imp for instance. Some of the programmers prefer playing the whole game from firstperson only, that's how versatile it is! DUNGEON KEEPER THE GAME FOR POWER FIENDS! Your imps have built a library, as you commanded! LOWER THE DRAWBRIDGE! After years of waiting Dungeon Keeper will be ready for review next month. And the sheer genius of it, perfectly executed, looks set to make it a challenger for best game ever. Now might be a good chance to buy that P200! 29 Uh oh, your minions seem to be fighting. Stop!

"computer Video games 70% COMPLETE CORRIDOR CORRIDOR BY KONAMI | BYKONAMI 1 PLAYER  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE I CO TM JUNE RELEASE PlayStation  RELEASED BY KONAMI TEL 01895 853000 PlayStation In keeping with their recent surge of top quality titles, Konami have an innovative new corridor game lined up for PlayStation. FIRMOR BROKEN HELIX DD I'M GETTING VERTIGO CO rea 51. That's where this game is set, though thankfully it's a lot more interesting than Time Warner's travesty which should be avoided at all costs. In Konami's game you control Jake Burton, an explosives expert thrown into the quagmire of Area 51 to defuse a couple of bombs. Little does he realise that he is a completely expendable asset, whose services may no longer be required once the job is done. One of the biggest features of this game is over 60 minutes of audio dialogue stored on the CD. The voice of Jake was recorded by Bruce Campbell, who has starred in such films as Congo, The Evil Dead 1 and 2 and Maniac Cops 1 and 2. His typical actionhero-grainy-type-voice suits the character down to a tee, and adds immensely to the atmosphere. Keep an eye on Area 51, it could be one of the year's dark horses. UUUUUUU FIRST 'SPEAK AND SHOOT GAME ARRIVES ON PLAYSTATION Playing this game needn't be restricted to the one view suffered by other titles in this field. Broken Helix gives you the chance to alter the perspective to more or less any angle that you desire. You can zoom in so that you're looking through the eyes of Jake, and zoom right out so that you can see virtually all of his body. Not only that, but you can move the camera above Jake, enabling a 45° shot pointing downwards. This is especially useful when little aliens are attacking your feet!

Three guesses what kind of Station this is? It's a toughie. If you fancy having a quick leak, why not pop into the ladies! SAY HELLO TO MY ODD LITTLE FRIEND CO YOU'VE BEEN FRAMED Before Jake reaches the end of the first two floors, the security cameras are his biggest source of hassle. Until he manages to escape the clutches of the marines, these cameras constantly alert the enemy of his whereabouts, and attack you just for good measure. Trouble is, even if you completely destroy them your foes know that you're still roaming around in one of the stages and come after you. The trick is to merely put them out of action by hitting them with the standard laser gun, causing them to fall to the ground, instead of explode. Certain tasks in the game cannot be performed by Jake because he is either too big, or the task is too life threatening. For example: Located inside the third floor is a cloud of gas which kills Jake instantly if he runs into it. Jake has to find the control panel which is linked to a robot and take control of it. He then guides the robot through the gas, into a room which contains the protection pills before returning to Jake. Once Jake has the pills he can safely traverse the poison cloud.

Still yearning for NIGHTS Two? Maybe the platform thrills of Pandemonium will keep you happy until Sonic Team deliver their next gem. andemonium proved to be a big game for BMG and Crystal Dynamics at the end of last year. So big in fact that Sega themselves snapped up the rights, just so Saturn owners could get to play what is believed by some to be the best PlayStation platformer. Will the hijinks caused by Nikki and Fargus, manage to weave their spell where Claris and Elliot have already been before? Will Saturn owners have to endure another poor PlayStation conversion? Will we print more question marks just for the effect of mystery??? Hey, give us a break, we're just trying to build this game up that's all! ANDEMONIUM TRICK YOUR EYES! MONDO MEDIEVAL MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR LEVEL 1 COMPLETE TREASURE 43% PASSWORD OOABEBIA THE Pandemoniya! CONTINUES ON YOUR SATURN! While Pandemonium may look like an amazing 3D explore-athon the action is very linear, with game play being strict 2D-style. Occasionally Nikki or Fargus may move into the action, or above and under objects. This is because the game employs a freestyle 3D camera which pans and tracks around the action, taking up the best position to view the player. So, while you may be playing what is a very 2D experience, you are tricked into seeing the game, as a 3D world. Very clever and convincing it is too. So what are Fargus and Nikki doing on this road to nowhere. Well it all starts when a book of magic spells falls into their eager hands. Having not yet received the proper training Nikki experiments with some spell casting, with disastrous results a huge monster and his hordes are unleashed on their local town and surrounding valley. It is up to them to search out the legendary Wishing Engine, earning them a chance to revert their spell, returning things to normality. TO CONTINUE Must find more treasure to access the bonus levels. O TO SWITCH PLAYER The level select screen. Very nice. COME JAPE WITH ME Where would a platform game be without a star? You see, it's all very well having intricate, beautifully designed levels, but you need a character to take you along and share the ride. Luckily Pandemonium has a choice of two. Each with different characteristics and abilities, FARGUS NIKKI COMING SOON These graphics look just as good as the original. Fargus is a court jester, wisecracking kind of guy. He is accompanied by Sid, a talking jester's stick, who manages to out wisecrack Fargus! Fargus' main abilities are his speed and tumble roll attack, which can damage enemies without harming himself. Why Fargus wears baseball boots in this medieval setting, we're not sure. A friend of Fargus who used to be a wizard's apprentice, and also has experience as an acrobat. She is a lot more agile than Fargus, and comes equipped with a very useful double-jump. Obviously Nikki is much more sensible than Fargus. Probably the better choice for the beginner. FUNNY HOW?

Well, turn your power-crazed sights to the stars, o'Mekon! DARK CO L O N Y IT'S COMMAND & CONQUER... ON MARS! ommand & Conquer has definitely started a craze. Suddenly battle strategy/ resource management games (or C&C rip-offs as they're more commonly known), are popping up all over the place! And while most of them use near identical (and therefore excellent) point-and-click interfaces, they rarely prove as popular. Not surprising really. After all, when you've got a realistic simulation of state-of-the-art global warfare, why would you instead want to battle in some hokey future populated by Australian mutants riding giant scorpions? Nope, a good C&C clone needs an equally desirable scenario. LucasArt's upcoming Rebellion battling in the Star Wars Universe is a prime example of a good backdrop. And now here's another planet Mars. With Aliens-style space marines facing off against the current hot extra terrestrials, the Grays. I'd buy that for a dollar! This disgusting looking xenomorph is actually a tank! Certain weapons are ancient alien artifacts, collectable by any team. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? DABK COL ON Y There are two races to choose from and both have equal types of weaponry. However the forms they take are drastically different. Play as the human colonists and you get very mechanical hardware. Your tanks are like futuristic land buggies, aerial scouts take the form of hoverships and you can also set up various automated gun-turrets. All should look familiar to anyone acquainted with the likes of The Terminator. Choose The Grays though and your vehicles are much more... organic. A sort of cross between Giger and Mr Blobby. For example, the humans have a vehicle that anchors in the ground and turns into a cannon. The alien equivalent is a A human attack buggy. The alien bipedal monster that shoves its head into the ground equivalent is there on the right. and fires meatballs from its backside! 992) COMING SOON DARK IS COM GET YOUR ASS TO MARS! That's right, the scenario for Dark Colony is the surface of the Red Planet. Set in the late 21st Century, humans are seeking to colonise Mars. After much exploration they discover gas vents on the planet's surface and build 'exploiters' to convert the gas into energy. Everything seems fine until the ruins of an alien civilisation are uncovered. As the PR blurb says \"The alien ruins would have been one of the largest scientific discoveries of the century, had it not been overshadowed by the appearance of the aliens themselves...\" Cue Holst's 'Mars: God of War' as the fighting begins. Some kind of weird alien stuff going on here. Hmmm. 1 An Earth exploiter, mining gas. Little do they know... 34 An alien base under attack from puny Earthlings. Those intestines are actually factories! "


"INTERSTELLAR VISUALS! computer video games ROM What really makes Dark Colony stand out from the crowd is its awesome graphics. An amazing amount of detail has been spent on the 3D-rendered models that appear on the encyclopedia screens. What's impressive though, is that these same models are also used for the in-game sprites. Excellent lighting effects have also been employed, resulting in some spectacular explosions when the lasers start flying. Even the shadows look cool, matching the contours of any building they fall on. There's also some superb animation as troops splatter, dissolve and rot in sprays of gore. And for a final touch, the terrain has actually been mapped out from NASA's maps of the Martian landscapes. Although, the cucumber vegetation has probably been added for flair. Rendered artwork showing the alien fighters homing in. Captures the spirit well, we think! GAS POWER! DARK COLONY IT'S COMMAND & CONQUER... ON MARS! Awesome explosions, excellent rendered HOLD sprites and NASA map-based terrains. Hooargh! 24,58 The side control panel is stylish and easy to use. However, this is just a pre-production version. Supposedly, the final one looks even better. A MARS A DAY! As with Command & Conquer, Dark Colony's gameplay is a mix of combat strategy and Sim City style management. You can't send your big army into battle until you've built it. And the only way to do that is by constructing a base. To start with, you have to tap into the gas pockets on Mars. Once this energy is being mined, you can construct your war factories. Energy can now be spent making troops, tanks, ships, whatever. The big difference between C&C and Dark Colony is the nature of this resource management. Once you've constructed your base, you can't make any more buildings. Instead, you just concentrate on increasing your forces and advancing their weaponry. This makes the game much faster-paced and more battle-oriented! Dark Colony features a in-game clock that changes between day and night throughout each game. This is more than just a visual touch though. The Grays are better-suited to fighting at night, while the humans have the advantage during the day. Your attack strategies have to be planned accordingly and you have to keep your eye on the clock too. Just when the humans are winning, day can turn into night and suddenly Grays crawl out of hiding to turn the fight around! BERLER COMING SOON WE KNOW OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE! MARS ATTACKS! Although, the terrain looks pretty similar in these shots, the final version of Dark Colony promises to have 45 to 50 different missions taking place across deserts, jungles and even underground! How these single-player battles turn out, depends largely on the enemy Al. Gametek's programmers have spent a lot of time on this aspect. The opposing force sends out scouts observing your strengths and weaknesses. They then build units to attack accordingly, sending them along the best tactical routes and making use of the terrain. The computer plays fair too. Any troops they haven't uncovered, they don't attack! If all this artificial intelligence still doesn't appeal, you can always link up against eight other human opponents! Dark Colony should be ready for review in our next issue. And we're hoping for an alien buttkicking game to match the brilliance of Command & Conquer. If the gameplay matches up to the awesome sound and visuals, Martian battles are gonna get a lot more popular around here! 35 "

One of the alltime great games then followed that, namely Flashback, which was so ahead of it's time it was almost frightening. Their last high profile release was Fade To Blac which again highlighted the fact that whe it comes to PC programming, they are det nitely not to be ignored. Which is why we approached their forthcoming motorbike racer with a certain amount of excitemen Although this a complete departure from what you may call 'Delphine's style of games' namely arcade adventures, you can't help feeling it has the same highly polished graphical feel they work under. The question is, can they keep the playability too? BIKE RACER FROM FLASHBACK'S CREATORS! The scenery and detail for some of the courses is breathtaking, providing you have a powerful PC. GRATUITOUS fra SNOW LEVELI ONE FOR SPEED a FREAKS Once you begin the game, only four tracks can be raced through. To gain access to the rest of the courses (there are nine in total) you have to complete these four first. But that isn't as plain sailing as you may think. The Speed Bay and West Way circuits aren't that tricky once you get the hang of your bike, and they are really for the straight forward races. High on excitement, low on reflexes. Choose Dirt Arena or Snow Ride, and you get a completely different kettle of fish. For a start you switch from Speed Bikes to Motorcross, and once you see the tracks you'll see why. Jumps, hills, slopes and 90° turns that would have been otherwise impossible are now negotiable with the skid bikes, and their improved handling capabilities. Blimey! As mentioned elsewhere, there are two different styles of bikes you race with. You don't have control over which to ride though, as they relate to specific tracks. Having said that, you can choose between eight variations of the bikes, depending on your own personal tastes. It is wise to pick the bike that has good speed and acceleration, and good grip. The brakes get used less and less during the game as you become accustomed to the routes, so a bike that specialises in that area is not really necessary. Other riders are tough to pass. fra INSIDE AND OUT Hugging corners saves time. CRUISIN' DOWN THE HIGHWAY! Racing in just one view is no longer acceptable nowadays, and the same can be said with Moto Racer. It doesn't go quite as overboard with the camera angles against something like Interstate '76. but it does give you a couple of variations. You can play just behind the entire bike so you see all of the rider as well as any competitors who are alongside you. A cockpit style view is also selectable with only the small protective visor on the front of the bike on screen. You can also look behind you, to see those trying overtake but you always end up crashing! EA are hoping that this will become their next Road Rash, and we should have the finished article in in time for next month's issue. Stay tuned. 36 "

And his game is the one which can compete with and ad anyone suggested Duke Nukem maybe even beat the all-powerful Quake! IS COMING TO SATURN! ad anyone suggested Duke Nukem 3D on the Saturn or PlayStation a year ago, we'd have just laughed at the idea the consoles just weren't looking capable of high-speed complex corridor games. Then Lobotomy Software appeared on the scene with an unheard-of game called Exhumed. Not only did it show just how brilliant this style of game could be, it also had one of the best game engines yet seen, running with loads of detail at very high speeds. As you can imagine, console fans wanting their own version of Duke Nukem 3D rejoiced at the fantastic news that Lobotomy were converting it to the Saturn! Hooray! YOUSUCK! COMING SOON DUKEHUKE, ED As far as we know, Duke Nukem 3D on the Saturn is going to be compatible with the console's internet system, the Sega NetLink. At the moment there are no plans to release the NetLink in the UK, but Saturn owners in America and Japan will be able to play Duke Matches (one-on-one battles to the death) against friends on the other side of the country! Hopefully Duke 3D will work with the direct connect cable which is also yet to be released in the UK. This would mean that you and a friend could link machines together and experience the best thing about Duke Nukem 3D Duke Matches! Duke 3D is also brilliant fun in cooperative mode, where players must work together to get through the game. Many people thought that Exhumed on the Saturn used the Duke Nukem 3D level engine known as BUILD, but instead it used one specially created by Lobotomy Software for the game. Known as Slave Driver, it can do everything that BUILD can do, letting the designers create fantastically detailed levels with special effects, levels on top of levels, moving sections, and still keep it moving at a very high frame rate. Another big advantage Slave Driver has over BUILD is that it can produce real-time coloured lighting effects without slowing the action down. Thankfully, Lobotomy are using this fantastic game engine as their basis for Saturn Duke 3D so that the game can look just like the PC version, run at a frame rate comparable to a Pentium, plus it can have all of the dynamic lighting! What this means is that projectiles light up the walls and floor around them, guns cause coloured flashes, and the scenery lighting is more realistic overall than it was on the PC! The pistol has to be reloaded very frequently. The shrink ray lights the area up with a lovely green glow. Very nice indeed. When the aliens shoot, their laser guns cause a bright flare. 38 "


"computer video games I'M GONNA RIP OFF YOUR HEADAND. SATURN With the Saturn version of Duke 3D at such an early stage in development, there aren't very many enemies programmed in so far. There are the LARD cops armed with shotguns who dive down on the floor and shoot while lying down, as well as few varieties of aliens. Some have jetpacks which let them fly around the levels shooting from above, others can teleport behind you, while the standard troopers just have small lasers. As the enemies are all flat sprites, they get a bit blocky when close up but keep the speed of the game very high at all times. And just wait until you see the size of some of the bosses! So isena The high-speed machine gun called the The Devastator causes enemies to Ripper is one of the more useful weapons. explode in a shower of ribs, blood and It gets through loads of ammo though! eyeballs! Just what the kids want! YOUBOTTOM BEATING, SCUM SUCKING ALGAE EATER! At the moment, Saturn Duke 3D doesn't have all of the weapons in place, and those which have been programmed can be found lying around the one level which is currently working properly. The weapons range from the usual pistol and shotgun, through to the RPG (rocket launcher), and onto some more interesting weapons. The shrink ray reduces enemies so that they're small enough to tread on, the laser trip-bombs can be attached to walls so that anyone breaking the laser beam will be blown up, and the freeze gun turns enemies into blocks of ice waiting to be kicked to bits! Of course, the Saturn version will have all of these when it's finished, plus there's the possibility of the extra weapons from the excellent Plutonium Pack being included (like the Expander Ray gun!). Most of the aliens don't take too many hits to kill, but getting surrounded can still be nasty. The RPG creates excellent lighting. That's the alien shrunk! Step on him! Shoot the LARD cops (hilarious pun or what?) and they drop their shotguns for you. DUKE NUKEN E D IS COMING TO SATURN! COMING SOON IS COMING TO SATURN! HA HALWASTEN At this early stage, only the main game engine has been developed with just the first level Hollywood Holocaust working properly. It still doesn't have all of the items, features and enemies of the finished game, but gives a clear indication of how well it's going to convert onto the Saturn. Duke Nukem 3D is well known for having brilliant level design, with lots of variation between the different stages. Many of the levels are set in cities, with lots of bits of scenery to fiddle with. For example, the first level is set in and around a cinema so it's possible to get into the projection room and start up the movie! The second stage has a dirty magazine' shop and nightclub, with a building to demolish! Later on in the game, Duke goes into an infested base in space then back to Earth for the climax, working through such cool areas as an underground train station (with working train between platforms) and a movie set!

A garbled sound effect accompanies the message representing their voice. In the 64-bit update these crude exchanges have been replaced by over 600 recorded messages.

Now  PlayStation owners can be proud of it too! SPIDICATE O THE CORPORATE WARS CE JIVJIELAG THE CORPORATE WARS hen Syndicate Wars came out on PC, it was a hit! Bullfrog's hugely-awaited follow-up to Syndicate, it gave you the chance to control a powerful gangland organisation of the future with horrifying alien weaponry at your disposal!! But, sci-fi angle aside, the game perfectly captured the mobster feel, right down to its calculatingly violent gameplay. With amazingly polished graphics and an impressive depth of gameplay only possible with a keyboard, Syndicate Wars was the perfect showcase for your state-of-the-art PC if you owned one. If you didn't, tough! Until now. Bullfrog have nearly completed the PlayStation conversion. You'd think compromises must have been made, but in fact they've actually improved on the original! DEMOLISH EVERYTHING! BULLFROG'S FUTURE CRIMEWAR ON CONSOLE! Although Syndicate Wars is viewed from an isometric angle, everything is 3D generated. This is for two reasons one, you can rotate the camera around at 360 degrees, and two, everything can be destroyed! Cars, street lamps, trees, even giant skyscrapers. This was one of the main concerns with the conversion. Most PC games of this type always seem slow or juddery on console. Not so in this case though, PlayStation Syndicate Wars runs totally smoothly and incredibly fast. What's more, the graphics have actually been improved. There's new transparency effects, where you can now see through buildings when your agents are behind them. Improved lighting effects (notably with explosions). larger sprites and even the video walls (streaming videos of real movies off CD) have more colour. GAIN CONTROL! The PlayStation gives Syndicate Wars incredible new lighting effects, such as on this police car! Aside from the graphics, the other uncertain area of this conversion was going to be the control system. However, the PlayStation pad proves amazingly functional and versatile for Syndicate Wars, thanks to all-new on-screen indicators. Running around blasting at everything, while switching weapons for each agent, and flipping the screen around. It's all incredibly instinctive. Bullfrog have scaled down some aspects of the PC version stuff like researching for new technologies but they admit that some of these features slowed the game down anyway. The PlayStation version is much more actionoriented. And to back this up, the game is compatible with the steering wheel (for driving stolen vehicles and the Negcon! RE COMING SOON More detailed building destructions (left) and transparent buildings now exist (right). A CUTTHROAT BUSINESS You can take control of all kinds of vehicles in the game. Some of the vehicles are simply huge. Look at this ship! SUN SYNDICATES! In Syndicate Wars you can control one of two sides the Eurocorp and the Church Of The New Epoch. Although using different means, both have the same goal to take control of the World! Controlling your group of agents, each level has different mission goals from assassination and destroying vital buildings to rescuing captured agents. As the game progresses a plot gradually evolves, leading to an epic finalé which puts the future of Earth in the balance. What's more, playing either side gives you a different perspective of the unfolding events. PS Syndicate Wars looks like being an incredible conversion. And it's just the kind of involving game the PlayStation needs. We hope to review this potential smash-hit next month! 42 Video screens play real footage. Look, Elvis! "

Obviously in the space of a month we're near to completing the game. Some of you who have been phoning regularly to share advice have beaten the final boss already. However the majority of UK players are still operating, quite understandably, on a please-don't-ruin-everything-forme-so-soon basis. So we'll continue with our 'introductory' coverage of the game for this issue, highlighting some of the amazing features which make Final Fantasy VII so different and refreshing to most other PlayStation releases. S EXTREME ELEMENTALS FINAL FANTASY VI WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?! Time to introduce some cool new characters, and bring to light some important plot details. Turns out Sephiroth, Cloud's mentor, is manufactured a fact Seph finds hard to deal with, so decimates his 'home' town of Nibulheim! That's only the start of Seph's reign of terror. Underlying everything is the mysterious Jenova Project a process which uses the magical properties of the Materia gem stone to clone and mutate humans. Who you first expect Cloud to be, isn't quite what he actually is and the revelation is a real shock. Meanwhile the subplots unveiled through the supporting characters are just as hard hitting. 3 5692 352 This red dragon is the more powerful version of Bahamut, fea tured last month.

Will you listen to us this time? PLEASE!!! 64 hink back to the days when FIFA was in its prime. The Mega Drive and SNES versions of FIFA '95 had just hit the shelves, and was widely regarded as the greatest football game for a very long time, maybe ever. Since then, however, Worldwide Soccer has stolen the crown from the Sega half, and ISS will steal the Sony market in the Summer. All that is left for EA to grasp onto is the Nintendo sector, but with ISS threatening to do similar wonders there, it looks as though EA are about to slip into the mire. Sure they can point to phenomenal sales figures for just about every version, but many of us have already lost faith in FIFA. This one could prove the final straw for everyone else. FIFA IT'S A BETTER MACHINE, BUT... Just because a game is on N64, doesn't automatically guarantee it being an instant hit. Far from it. And in the case of FIFA, it's miles from it. So we dug out the PlayStation version that props up our wonky table leg to see how much has changed. N64 PlayStation SFERS TEAM MANAGEMENT Sideline Cam W .06 Solstitution FIFAS ENGLAND Name Overall 11 ME FIFA 64 S SIETE $ Cemil C Bart Wams IWO SE Rank Shot Par Shot ACG. SPEEC Jensen Keown M Kiwomiya C Sheringha T Arsenal BROY Ball Cul. 91 ENGLAND Overall Tottenham Rosenthal R Howells D Sabstitution Select Player Sinton A TRANSFERS PlayStation FIFA allowed you to keep up-to-date with all the latest player swaps, by trading between teams. Now it's been strangely transferred out of the Nintendo one! Who said bung? PlayStation N64 MATCH SELECT Scoring from corners and free kicks with headers has been made slightly easier. Yeah, great. Bame su Friendly Player league Rastore A VIEW WITHIN A VIEW Tournament OPTICS Something which has been added to this version of FIFA is the Picture In a Picture camera. Switch this on, and a small TV screen appears in the top right hand corner, showing the action from a different perspective. The view inside this window can be changed to any of the normal game camera angles, giving you the opportunity to see what is going on elsewhere on the pitch. You can also switch it to a Radar, to give you a complete look at the pitch. Anyone who is just watching a game may find it useful, but it obscures so much of the playing arena that the main game is spoilt. And to top it all off, with PIP on, the game speed slows by about a third! INDOOR MODE The five-a-side version of the real thing, where the ball never leaves the arena. And in the N64 version, it'll never leave any pitch because it isn't there! Any Malaysian businessmen here? PlayStation JOLY N64 PLAYOFF Select Team 01:35 1 League Serig REVIEW Scotland Scotland Celtic Aberdeen ANDO England MORE TEAMS Even though you never used any of them, the PS FIFA had all the top teams from 15 countries for you to play as. N64 has a paltry six countries, and they left out Scotland in favour of America! The Picture in Picture can be switched to a radar, so you can see all of the pitch and players... ... Or like this, with another camera in the corner. The action is so small though, it's pointless. 52 "


"computer video games MOTTY, VICAR? NINTENDO You would have thought that EA couldn't fit the numerous quotes and anecdotes from the previous incarnations, but the three amigos of football commentary are back for the cartridge version. Des \"Join me\" Lynam, John \"Sheepskin wearing waffler\" Motson and Andy \"Och aye\" Gray return to offer their unique services. But having said that, in over three hours worth of playing, we've only heard Mr Gray say one phrase. Yeah, cheers Andy, we know he's got \"lovely skill.\" SPOTS ELECTRONIC ARTS A THE NET IS MADE A OF RUBBER COMMENT The first time you pick up FIFA and play with a mate it'll rather inevitably end up in a 0-0 draw. Sudden Death extra time then beckons in which the first person to score wins, before moving onto the penalty shoot outs. These have slightly changed compared to the FIFA '97 versions, with a slightly more isometric view being used. And, when you try to miss, you always end up scoring so that becomes a lot easier too. By the way, check out the net bulging when you score. Maybe it's a new ruling that UEFA have bought in this season, but we don't ever remember the nets having to be made of rubber? Although the behind the goal camera looks good, it's difficult to play under. 04:36 1 Ball Cam This is the most confusing and annoying football game I've played in a long time. EA's sports titles have really fallen from their pedestal in recent years, and this game will go down in history as an indicator to how far they fell. Everything about FIFA 64 is poor, with very jerky animation and horrible motion blur whenever the camera pans. Completing passes seems more of a lottery than skill, with players having the crazy habit of back heeling rather than going forward. How FIFA 64 got through quality control is bewildering. A complete shambles for EA, while no doubt Konami are jumping for joy on the touch line. ALEX HVATALA FIFA Charles Charley Charles from Harry Enfield and the superglue foot gag! REVIEWER 05:23 2 The replay mode lets you switch the camera angle and zoom in and out as you please. ANYTHING ELSE WORTH MENTIONING? There is a new camera view especially for FIFA 64, and it is called the FIFA 64 cam! We couldn't really work out where it was positioned, but it seemed to be somewhere in between the sideline cam and ball cam. Needless to say it's not much use at all. The only other thing that may please you is that all of the player names are as up-to-date as could be. Every transfer which took place about three weeks before its release will have been included. EA pull their FIFA '97 trick by releasing this before any reviews get printed in the games mags. People get hit by a blitz of marketing and rush out and buy it. So this is for the benefit of all the people who are waiting: DON'T BOTHER. FIFA '97 is just a compete bodge job from start to finish. Your passes are far too unreliable, the animation is terrible, the frame rate is jerky, and the controls are too fiddly. Basically it plays like your Sunday morning pub team, with the fat bloke in goal. And why, whenever you go to take a shot does the forward take a step back to start the animation, thus giving the defenders enough time to make a cup of tea and watch Match of the Day before making a tackle? Rubbish. STEVE HEY REVIEW 03 5251 FOTO RATING The people run like they are doing a dance to the birdy song. Will it go in, or won't it. Frankly, do we really care? No. FIFA has sunk to a new low. Quite how an unplayable version like this managed to get through the playtesting stage is beyond us, let alone get a release. Cack. 53 "

"SHOW US YER SKILLS ISS 64: BACK IN TRAINING computer video games NINTENDO U The animation for ISS is amazing. There are so many tricks and touches that you would only expect to see on a real football pitch, right here on your TV screen. Little things like players looking into the box before they cross the ball to see who is waiting. Also players stagger about after being shoulder barged away from the ball. If you tap run as you're just about to control a pass, the player jumps over it, or does a sly dummy to confuse the opposition. You can also pull off an Ossy Flick (originated by Ossy Ardiles), where you flick the ball over your head. You can stand there and keep the ball up too. All potential humiliation tactics for people you're playing against. Scoring cheesy goals is one thing, but hitting the back of the net with a scorching 25 yard free kick thunderbolt is well worth practising for respect value. This is where the training mode comes in especially handy. There are three situations you can practice under, of which 'Free Training' is the simplest. There's just you, and all 11 of your team mates and that's it. Free Kick and Corner Kick Training speak for themselves. The ball is placed on set points around the area, and you have to decide whether to shoot, cross one over, or do a little tap to the side for on-rushing players. As soon as you score, or the opposition defenders get the ball, the game is stopped and a new set piece begins. MED Costan TRAINING MF10 Costan TRAINING Fejer TRAINING TER PROTECTOR Re: EURO '96 REVISITED BE Les NAJOR Viwal Fuital YC Viwe fullor 10 N W One of the highlights of El me ISS 64 is Scenario Mode, where you get to take over a game in a tricky situation. For example it's 2-1 down in the last couple of minutes, and you have to score the vital goals. Scenario Mode gives a set of 16 set matches, and each is given a difficulty rating of one to six, with six being the hardest. The situations you're placed in, range from being one-nil down in the championship final with over two minutes left (the easiest), to being two-one down with just 30 seconds left and you have to win. All of the scenarios start from a set piece, so using that training mode is essential. REVIEWER This celebration was first performed by Romario and Co. in the last World Cup. CancelStart Button Replay BIN CAR Over the years, football games have spent more hours sitting in my CD drive, or cartridge slot than any other type of game. Now ISS has come along I can comfortably say it has provided me with the most fun. ISS may not look much from a static image, but wait until you see it moving. Top notch animation coupled with intelligent Al and realistic game situations make i5S 64 the most convincing soccer game I've ever seen. The satisfaction I got from scoring the most spectacular goals was immense, and seeing my crosses sail ing into the box to be met by an incom ing attacker and ending up in the back of the net is something else. It's that old cliché: Once you pick ISS up it's so easy to get into, yet so difficult to put down. Family get-togethers will never, ever be the same in any football loving household again. STEVE PES REVIEW D2 The net bulges under the force of the shot. HIGIENE CSGOKEN RATING EX SUPP If you had tried to imagine the perfect football game three or four years ago, ISS 64 is exactly what you would have come up with. Absolutely awesome!

Far from it. It's possibly the fastest, most exhilarating racing game yet for Sony's grey box of tricks. It was released in Japan towards the end of November last year, but unfortunately, has only just seen the light of day over here. One of the reasons for this delay is due to the name. Namco decided to be ultra-careful and check with all the other software houses that they didn't mind the game being called Rage Racer, and everybody bar Konami said OK. The reason for Konami's strange refusal is down to their own racing game Road Rage, and that the names are too similar. Namco also had similar trouble with Soul Edge (hence the new name Soul Blade). But whatever name Rage Once you've progressed through all of the tracks and reached the infamous sixth class, a Racer arrives under, you can whole new set of cars become available...three actually. These cars have no grade, probably expect a quality title when because they are too good, and look the business! This class is also significantly harder it's released here in June. because there are only five cars including you competing, and it takes at least half a lap before you've even caught one of them up.

B SIDES, FREE RIDES AND FLIP SIDES I have to confess that I never played the original Ridge Racer and I was only introduced to the titles through Revolution. Even that didn't grab me in any way. But Rage Racer is a completely different kettle of fish. It does start at an unusually slow pace though, with the first car piddling along at a feeble speed. Because of this a few doubts crept into my mind, but once you've cleared the first class, and got some of the faster cars, you really notice how this game motors along. It's also graphically stunning and the soundtrack has some awesome tunes which will have you nodding your head in approval as you cruise along the courses. This is so much of an improvement on the RRR. it's almost frightening. Oh, one last tip, buy yourself a crash helmet, so when your brains explode, they don't make a mess on the sofa. STEVE PES Something that has become almost a tradition in racing games these days is the mirror mode, your reward for completing the first five classes in Rage Racer.

No one can doubt that Wave Race, in the home at least, brought its own element of change. When the Saturn and PlayStation were launched, both had a major arcade racer conversion as one of their big release games. Not so Nintendo, Wave Race 64 is true original! QUALE RACE TM Kawasaki JETSKI ERAGUE SWIMMING WITH SHARKS WAVERALD WAVERALD CLAVERACE Kawasaki FETEC In Wave Race, the water is the best we've ever seen in a game, boasting accurate physical properties which brilliantly convey the effect of buoyancy. Plus different wind conditions, which affect the waters. So you can experience riding your craft through a range of turbulence, from calm still waters, all the way to choppy rough water. This is more than just a graphical trick too it's an essential part of the gameplay. Learn to master the timing of leaning in and out of breaking waves, jumping off the huge ones, or simply ploughing straight into them! Like we said, the best we've seen almost real!

In Time Attack or Stunt Mode the course takes on a whole new meaning. The most basic location, but also one of the prettiest. Here's where the Championship begins proper. A simple oval-shaped circuit, two long straights, and two sharp corners. On all the courses the object is to go to the left of yellow buoys and right of the red. So called because of the beautiful sunset, which offers dramatic lighting for the race. The waves break across the run of the circuit, and there's a huge jump off a ramp.

The buoys are placed pretty deviously around the course, with the remains of a wooden jetty to negotiate. Race around the fortress in some very choppy waters. An early trick to learn is using the wave to jump the stone jetty that blocks the first corner. At Hard and Expert levels, a lock gate opens to let riders through a twisty shortcut. Takes place around a very rusty moored oil tanker, with very choppy water. In Hard and Expert classes riders are led through a very tight tunnel that passes through the harbour itself. Kawasaki JETSKI QUAKE RACE WE SEED O'025725112 Wave Race 64 is a totally new experience. Even if you've played jet-ski games in the arcade, the thrill on offer here is much better. Waves are bigger, more varied, and closer to the real thing. Using the wave formations to your advantage requires a lot of skill. One shortcut involves ducking beneath the water, which is almost too incredible to appreciate! Detail only suffers slightly in two-player races, and the racing tactics remain the same. Only the most intense players will go crazy with the score attack, but everyone should love the Championship. It's a pity there aren't more courses, but the dolphin cheat is a cool bonus.

COOL WAVE Expert class only. A real struggle to stay on the Ski, with ice bergs presenting huge obsta cles. The trick is to control your sliding across the 'bergs, leaning into corners at the last moment. There are also giant ice-balls to contend with. The final course! Set around the island, but with the tide going out, each circuit is different. A shipwreck is submerged on the first lap, but on the second you have to jump over it! A very sneaky course. 011516 91..... When playing this game, get somebody to splash water over you occasionally, and the effect of racing around on jet-skis will be complete.

Making full use of the N64's analogue stick the control over your ski is incredibly precise, allowing you to take corners at lots of different angles, looking for a way to shave those vital seconds off a lap time.

PAINT THE FENCE, PAINT THE FENC INSTINCTIVE KILLERS MAYA MAYA 100 L 3-3 O Jump in MP As Killer Instinct Gold is a complex fighting game with lots of emphasis on understanding and mastering the combo system, a lot of practice is needed in order to get good. Thankfully, Killer Instinct Gold has a brilliant training mode which takes you from understanding the basic combo ideas (jumping attacks, auto-doubles, linkers, enders, etc) right up to testing you to copy the combos and moves of a computer version of yourself. If the training mode is completed on the highest difficulty setting with a completely perfect score, you get known as Grand Master for that character and gain an extra two costumes for them! Killer Instinct Gold is basically the same as the arcade version of Killer Instinct 2, with all of the same characters. Unfortunately, a few characters from the first Killer Instinct are missing Chief Thunder, Riptor, Cindel and Eyedol with three new fighters to replace them.

"ARCADE-PERFECT? ARCADE-SHMERFECTE computer video games DUH... SO WHAT WAS AN AUTO-DOUBLE AGAIN? ORCHID FULGORE NINTENDO Killer Instinct 2 in the arcade looked mostly the same as Killer Instinct Gold, only the backgrounds weren't truly 3D. Instead they cleverly scrolled left and right behind the fighters to look as though they were models. Killer Instinct Gold, however, uses the Nintendo 64 's hardware to create very smooth real-time 3D backgrounds which move around as the fight goes on, revealing what the area looks like from all angles. Most of the stages have some part of scenery which can be knocked by the fighters normally just for effect, but sometimes to move scenery to extend the fighting area. On Orchid's stage you can knock enemies into the blades of the helicopter to spin them around! OG SABREMULT 27 Maya DORADO HYPER Killer Instinct Gold isn't one of the most beginner-friendly games ever, with knowledge of the complex combo system being necessary to have much of a chance. The controls are the same as Street Fighter 2's three punch buttons (light, medium and hard) and three kick buttons with the directional cross-key or 3D stick to move, jump and block. Most special moves can be used to start combos, with a quick tap of the right button during the move to do an auto-double. This extra attack button depends on the power of the original special move, but will add an extra two hits onto the end of a move. As these two hits connect, performing a special move at the right power will work as a linker to keep the combo going. You can then auto-double from this special move and go into a finisher. These moves, when done after an autodouble will come out as combination attacks to end the sequence. If you think that's complicated, it gets for difficult from then on as you try to work out moves and ways to keep combos going for enormous numbers of hits Killer Instinct Gold makes it possible to perform 90-hit combos for each character! Sabrewulf's stage has a wall on the right which can be destroyed to let you through to the balcony! TJ Combo's new stage has a train going past every now and then. It's possible to hit enemies onto the track! REVIEWER B NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH! As with Mortal Kombat, there's quite a lot of blood in Killer Instinct as well as death moves to finish your opponents in all sorts of fancy ways. Each character has one death move which is performed as a combo finisher and another which is more like a powered-up special attack to end the fight. These moves can only be done when your opponent is almost out of the fight already and their energy bar is flashing red. Killer Instinct games have a big following of fans who love learning and mastering the combos and death moves. To them, KI Gold is perfect a brilliant conversion of the arcade game with excellent new features to give them even more to learn. While the animation of the fighters has been cut down, the graphics are still very good, with smooth 3D scenery and great special effects. The speech and sound effects aren't brilliant but the music is excellent title music and decent background tunes really fit the style of the game. The training mode is the best new feature, giving players a challenge to beat and giving them the perfect place to learn all of the moves and combos (and they do take a lot of learning!). KI Gold certainly isn't for those who aren't keen on fighting games, as it requires lots of patience to get anywhere with it, and won't appeal to many fans of the style as the fights don't flow as well as, say SF Alpha 2 or Virtua Fighter 2. Arcade Kl players should buy themselves an N64 for this, while everyone else should ask themselves whether they want a super-fast memory test. SV LAMASI AWESO VICTO RETIEWS 288 RATIN A brilliant conversion of the arcade game, but it still requires a lot more effort than most people are willing to bother with. 61 "


"computer Video games MORE QUAKE!! BY ROGUE CD  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY ACTIVISION TEL 0181 742 9400 APR RELEASE 1-8 PLAYERS ROM ROM So you've beaten Quake eh? And the Mission Pack too? Fool, you cannot kill what does not live! Quake returns with an all-new Mission Pack. You will accept it! hen Quake first came out, there was no disputing it was an excellent game. One of the best made. But what made it even better was the promise of things to come. Quake's super-customisable qualities made it the most upgradeable game ever. Before the finished version was even released, home-made patches were appearing on the net-new weapons, enemies, and levels most of them excellent. Better still, multiplayer deathmatches have taken on a new lease of life thanks to allnew battle modes. And the evolution of the game continues. Two issues back we reviewed the first Quake Mission Pack, an expansion disk that pushed Quake to even greater levels of one-player brilliance, such that it scored a High Five! Now comes Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity. More levels, more new enemies and more weaponry. More Quake... MISSION PACK NO. 2, DEATHMATCH DELIGHTS The multi-player mode now has a few extra treats too. Nothing we haven't seen on the internet, but good if you haven't got them. Capture the Flag and Three Team battles for example. Random Power-Up Respawning prevents people lingering around the Quad and (our fave) the grappling hook is here! MISSION PAGI 10.2 TWICE THE TERROR! REVIEWER Dissolution of Eternity is split into two episodes. Once past the customary difficulty select room, you can enter two doorways. One leads to Hell's Fortress, which is just that a castle surrounded by a moat and built above a hive of devilish catacombs. The second is The Corridors of Time. These levels switch between medieval castles, Greek temple designs and Egyptian sculpture. Luverly, but they're all still filled with grotesque monstrosities. SATAN'S NEW ABORTIONSI QQQG9 More new monsters await in Mission Pack 2. You can now face electric eels, statues which come to life (and make you jump out of your skin cos you know it's going to happen!), floating Wraths and phantom swordsmen. New hazards have also been included. Multi-directional lightning shooters, buzz saws, pendulum scythes and even earthquakes. For me Quake really is the best game I've played. Internet Quake World and matches against 'The Master'* keep me forever hooked on the game's multiplayer appeal, but if you want to enjoy the brilliant single-player atmosphere, these mission packs are essential. Pack 2's levels are again ingeniously constructed they're extremely tense and the continuous action is really full-on! It's more challenging than the previous pack and proves tough even at normal skill. There's loads of hidden things to find too, making you really appreciate the excellent level layouts. The episodes are perhaps not themed as well as in the first pack. It seems less like a full adventure and more like another gripping chase through QuakeLand, but it's a great chase. Likewise, the weapons, while not very inventive, certainly up the pace. I would say Mission Pack 2 isn't as good as Pack 1, but it's still everything that makes Quake the greatest. Basically, if you have a PC and love Quake you should already have the first Mission Pack and get this one too! POWER UUUP! REVIEW Not so much totally new weapons, but power-ups for your old ones. Lava nails with armour-piercing capabilities, multigrenades and multi-rockets increase your attack range, and plasma cells boost your thunderbolt. They all help step up the action and nothing is more satisfying than hearing your nail-gun hiss after releasing a stream of hot pins! PAUL DAVIES Dodging between these swinging blades can be nerve-wracking. The slicing sound is pretty unpleasant! RATING BATING The multi-grenades hit When a plasma blast the floor and scatter bomb! hits the wall, it channels See that tub of lava nails? into all nearby enemies! Doesn't improve on the Quake formula quite like the first pack, but definitely keeps the addiction going. Vital for the hardcore Quakester! 62 *Regular CVG readers should know who The Master is by now! "

Well, what else was there to do before Star Wars and the height of disco? ou can rely on the PC to do things differently. Until the launch of MMX there was no way that the PC could emulate the consoles arcade titles, especially driving games. So what do they do? Well, it seems Activision have changed the rules slightly. Setting their game in the American Southwest means not much in the roadside objects department because it's all desert. Plus they've given this game a theme and a story. Disguising the fact that this is just driving and shooting, there's all sorts of bells and whistles on top, and you know what? It works! Farstate YOU ARE THE KNIRNT RIDER!

Utilising stunning motion cap ture, polygonised characters and the voice-talent of actors, this is like watching a movie (well, if you squint). Best of all is the attention to detail in these scenes, capturing the feel of the era the game is set in when Taurus leaves a diner he doesn't walk, across the screen, he performs a motion-captured strut!

"TAKING IT TO THE MAINI computer video games Activision claim that all the vehicles in 1'76 behave realistically, and we believe them. All the cars skid and jump with collisions based on vehicle physics. Accelerate around sharp corners and you feel the car lose control. Apply the emergency brake while you're travelling at top speed and you leave some huge skidmarks! It's also possible to flip and roll the cars, but if you do it's game over, because in the process you'll have wrecked your ride. By entering the melee -a mode of play similar to Twisted Metal's tournament mode you're able to choose from 30 different vehicles, ranging from a police car to a school bus.

Hmmm, oil! 30 AMO CONTATT I've been looking forward to this for quite some time, from the first peek at early_screenshots months ago, right up to the moment before we received the finished game. My first fears of it being a Roadblasters clone were quickly dashed, there's a lot more to this game than simply blasting other cars. Essentially that's all there is, but it's disguised by some perfect presentation and story telling. Some of the best features are only discovered by playing, not watching. Driving to where the action is may seem boring to most, but I feel it adds lots. Breaking up the combat element and giving you a feel for the surroundings. The original soundtrack gets you completely in the mood, although Groove looks like he might have preferred some vintage kiss or Aerosmith, funk being better suited to Taurus. The only gripe have is that you're going to need a monster PC to play this. Recommended is a P90 or higher, but we're playing it on a P200 and things are still a little jerky. Of course turning down detail and resolution alleviates this, but that's not why you own a P200 is it! Better presentation than that other 'cinematic' experience Tomb Raider, Interstate  is one bad 'ass mutha of a game. Right on!

Boasting the mighty Pac-Land and Ordyne, could it be the best instalment yet? CREDIT 07 ROUND  MUSEUM olume four, and the end of the Namco lesson in arcade heritage is almost over. Along the way we've been witness to the revolutionary, the classics, the dated, and the bad. Yes we've had some fun down this road, but have also been burned. For every PacMan or Galaga we had to endure a Dragon Buster or Tower of Druaga. We know Namco like to show off their past, and present the museum series for completists, but maybe some of these games would have been better left behind? But enough of our ramblings! Without further ado, for your delectation and enjoyment... here's volume FOUR! VOL. Namco PAC-LAND (1984) . EL.  THE RETURN OF ISHTAR (1984) GENPEI TOH MADEN (1986) Without doubt an absolute classic, and the best game of this volume placing Pac-Man in a sidescrolling platform adventure. Here everything is score based, with lots of hidden power-ups and score-attack tactics to learn. In its day the graphics were state-ofthe-art, and still hold up reasonably well. A huge hit which revitalised Pac's arcade career and even spawned a cartoon series! A sequel to Tower of Druaga and forerunner to Atari's classic Gauntlet. This is a one or two player dungeon adventure. Negotiate the maze-like dungeons locating keys, and amass ing magic and spells. Ishtar also includes a simple RPG element, which of course is practically unheard of in arcade games. This challenging action/platform game could be seen as the forerunner to Sega's Shinobi. Yet GTM probably never made it out of Japan, thus hampering its chance at classic status. You control a Samurai hero who must make his way through the levels, defeating all opponents who dare challenge him. 14 0043 00-300 RUUNG Some of the best game music ever! REVIEWER ASSAULT (1988) ORDYNE (1988) Utilising Namco's then brand-new arcade hardware, Assault sees you at the controls of an armoured tank. Sprite scaling and rotation added some dazzling visuals, hiding the fact that this is basically Commando in a tank. The original featured, a twin stick control method, emulated by the PS pad using both the top sets of but tons with shoulder buttons to fire. An attractive horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up, which still plays very well. Bright colours, melodic tunes and humourous characters made this stand out from the crowd. Although inspired by such greats as Gradius and Fantasy Zone, Ordyne probably convinced Konami to release Parodius. Part four of the Museum series is another mix of classic, good, and not so good. An arcade-perfect conversion of Pac-Land should guarantee a modest demand for the title upon its release. Enough people have fallen under this game's spell along the years, and it's not too late to find out why. Ordyne is a favourite too. The rest I'd never played before, and while they don't stand out as great, they do have some redeeming qualities. If you haven't tuned into the series so far, this is unlikely to convince you. But for those who love all things Namco, enjoy! Alex HUHTALA HIGH SCORE REVIEW verslo 65 To $8235 RATING If you love retro games, Pac-Land and Ordyne are among the best examples you could own.

Announced only a month or so before it came out, no-one was sure exactly what was going to be in it. Megamix turned out to be more than just two fantastic fighting games in one. The characters have all been improved, new moves have been added, new fighters have been created, and the overall gameplay has been fiddled with! The result is the best home fighting game ever! WANNA FIGHT? FIGHT ME! FIGHTERS MEGAMIX Megamix is especially exciting to fans of combat games because it combines the characters from two of the best games around. AM2 really know what makes a good character, and Megamix has all 11 from the incredible Virtua Fighter 2, together with all 11 from the excellent Fighting Vipers. As we've shown you before there are also ten secret fighters from other AM2 games, all of which are great fighters themselves!

In addition to the 10 secret fighters there are a few more hidden bonus features to collect the more you play. Candy has two extra costumes plus her new yellow second outfit, and Kumachan can turn into Mr Meat or Palm Tree. There are also a few cool references to other AM2 games, with the music on the name entry screen coming from Outrun, the records music coming from AfterBurner 2, and a secret command to make the AfterBurner plane fly over the fighting arena!

"WATCH IT, PALI computer Video games Considering that UK consoles run about 17% slower than American and Japanese (NTSC) ones, we always have doubts about how well the UK (PAL) versions of games are going to turn out. Thankfully AM2 have a reputation for brilliant conversions of their games for Britain, as exemplified by VF2. Fighters Megamix is also excellent. But, just like Fighting Vipers, there are small borders at the top and bottom of the screen. Also the action is slower than the NTSC versions, though the difference is slight and doesn't affect the fights once you get over the fact. SATURN COMMENT ONLY A GAME SUCH AS FIGHTERS MEGAMIX LETS YOU PLAY AS A BEAR STATUE AROOGA! MORE MODES OF PLAYI When you see impressive combos in Fighters Megamix, it can ONLY mean that the player is impressive. The extreme styles require a level of dedication unmatched anywhere except the amazing VF3. This is not just a matter of different button commands, you have to complete ly understand each character's style. For example Akira's powerful close-range method is hugely different to Tokio's rapid combos. VF2 is still unbeatable on Saturn, and I would still recommend that AM2 die-hards seek out Fighting Vipers. However this unique Megamix package SHOULD NOT BE MISSED as it allows for you to experiment with the different combinations of styles. All in all another great game to make owning Sega's machine a privilege. PAUL DAVIES SURVIVAL MOCE REITT PE RENTAHERO 20 WINS   EAM BATTLE AGOE REVIEWER As with most good fighting games, Megamix has a team battle mode. Each player selects up to eight fighters and takes on another team. There's an option to have the fighters recover energy after each round if you want. The one-player mode doesn't work in the same way as Virtua Fighter 2's or Fighting Vipers' arcade modes. Instead there are nine 'courses', each with a different selection of enemies to tackle and one of the secret characters as a final boss. These courses include Virtua Fighters, Vipers, Girls, Muscle Fighters, Bosses, and eventually Secrets. Survival Mode has three main settings 3 minutes, 7 minutes and 15 minutes. You simply fight each character in order to see how many you can beat before you run out of energy (you have one power bar which takes more damage than usual) or run out of time. Take a look at the High Scores page in FreePlay every month to see how far other readers have got. ge2 The Training Mode in Fighters Megamix is very useful, with loads of moves listed for each character. Every time you do a move correctly, a little 'OK' is marked next to its name and it gets added to the list in the Book Keep menu. As it keeps track of how many moves you've managed to do, it becomes a challenge to complete all of them, just like we did. Showing off is good fun. XIMUSELU FIGHTERS THE WORLD'S GREATEST FIGHTER SI The Virtua Fighter series is the most perfectly-balanced set of fighting games available. That's why the idea of mixing its characters with those from Fighting Vipers is a worrying one, but thankfully AM2 have done it brilliantly. The standard mode plays a lot like Vipers, with many attacks sending the other player flying through the air letting you do some fantastic combos. Music is brilliant, with remixed versions of the VF2 tunes together with cool tracks taken from the secret fighters' games. The graphics are very similar to Fighting Vipers' with cool coloured light-sourcing and super-smooth movement, though the resolution of the fighters is a lot lower than Saturn Virtua Fighter 2's. Secret fighters aren't just there for the sake of it, as they've all got a fantastic selection of moves and combos to find, giving you loads more to learn after you've mastered all 22 of the 'main' characters. The thing is, this is a game with so much to it that you will be learning for the rest of your life literally. A few little things which made the VF games so good are missing (rising attacks, staggers and so on) but overall this is such a good package it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to miss out on this. If you like fighting games in any way you'll realise that this is the best available by a long way, and if you've never seen the point before this is the game to convert you. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE! LAMACI Although the Virtua Fighter characters look like their VF2 versions, they have lots more moves. The new Escape button lets them dodge around their opponents and throw from the side, plus they've got loads of their excellent new attacks from Virtua Fighter 3! The Fighting Vipers also have a few new moves each. On top of all that, damage ratings have been evened out slightly to give more balanced fights. Starting with one of his new throws, Lion uses a knee to bounce his opponent into the air! To solve the age-old problem of which move to use after Kage's high toss throw, it's possible to knock enemies off the floor and into the air with his dragon punch move!

For those people waiting for head-to-head showdowns the game is perfect, with excellent multiplayer options. However, it's designed perhaps a little too specifically for on-line gaming. The lack of 'any' single player campaign is disappointing. I really wanted an engrossing plot to match that of TIE Fighter. Instead, lone players have to make do with playing random (and sometimes disjointed) battles just to boost their profile. Likewise the presenta tion is 'functional for quick multiplayer access. No cool plot intermissions, lavish Star Destroyer interior options screens, or CG docking bay launches. To be fair though, the demand has been for an on-line Star Wars sim and Lucas obviously know there's a big enough market from people with office networks or modems.

"computer video games FIND IT AND IT'S Not everything the adventurers require is obtained over the counter, or received as a gift. It's often the case that medicinal herbs, protective garments, and even powerful weapons are unearthed by searching an area. In towns and villages this means casting your eye over suspect boxes. In the forests you are advised to rummage around near trees for items. Sometimes objects, or even pixies, are found lodged, between cracks in walls when you meet a dead end, this is usually a clue. This process might seem tedious, but patience and dedication has its own reward. SECA SATURN Melody and Rodie wait on Doyle to open this crypt. Below is a vast network of catacombs! Before fighting the shade which protects the crypt, a cool movie sequence sets the scene. Suche REVIEWER It is accepted that RPG characters develop in terms of strength and skill as they progress. Usually this enabled by collecting experience points. Sega's Shining series, including Holy Ark, adds to this formula by adding a Weapons Repair shop and Promotion system. In the first case adventurers can take any damaged, or worn weapons to a Smithy where they are honed into something more effective. After many battles with new and upgraded weapons, the party may consult any village priest in the hope of promotion. Enough experience points earns you the right to move up a rank. Not only are your skills advanced, but items of clothing are exchanged for more impressive replacements. B-s HP 65 HP63 HP24 It's a bold move creating an RPG that is 100% real-time 3D, and the sacrifices are subtle but obvious to somebody who spends a lot of time with RPGs. Inside the villages and towns there are much fewer characters, and the ground these places cover is smaller than is usual. The upshot of having big CG rendered characters Mi is that they offer enhanced personality, and scope for more dramatic scenes. For example when the King of Enrich is possessed, the fact this scene fills the screen is much more effective than some little sprite with a cloud over its head. The large characters also add more suspense, and a touch of ingenuity to the battle scenes. Here enemies are more terrifying because they are so huge, and animate, so well because of their articulated body parts. Even minor enemies are tricky to defeat as many of them have clever routines to overcome. Finally it's great to find that Holy Ark requires a lot of problem solving, in the form of maze-like dungeons and keen exploration. You need to work at Holy Ark to get into the story, as there are a few technical shortcomings. Stick with it, however, and you will be richly rewarded. The lead magic user in Holy Ark, Melody, summons elementals though they're not quite as impressive as those in Final Fantasy VII. Accasionally during a battle, one or more of the party unleashes an extra-special attack. Here Rodie is performing a piledriver.

Just looking at their forthcoming release schedule (Castlevania, ISS Pro and 64, Metal Gear Solid) would have anybody who's anybody in the games industry quaking in their boots. In preparation for their tidal wave of top titles, Konami are aiming to completely sew up the PlayStation roleplaying market with the imminent arrival of Vandal Hearts. To call this a true RPG would be lying somewhat you don't have the complete freedom to go where you please. The towns and battle areas you visit are all pre-defined and if the game doesn't want you to go somewhere, that's it.

The battle is just beginning... * UP FOR PROMOTION * LE WANDAL HEARTS As is becoming almost a tradition in RPG's these days, you build up your characters    strength by earning experience points. Once you begin your quest, you start on a paltry level three or four and aren't exactly bulging in the strength department. By killing a few enemies, casting magic spells or using items, you gain valuable experience. Once this tally tops a hundred, you increase a level and your hit and magic points (if applicable) rise accordingly. Once levels ten and twenty are reached, you can be promoted to a new class of fighter, giving you the extra ability needed to use the better weapons and magic in the game. 71WILL YOU BE OUR FRIEND? As any self respecting warrior knows, trying to save your entire country single handed, is not the easiest of tasks. Thankfully for Ash, the leading character in Vandal Hearts, help is at hand around every corner. You begin with two other people in your crew, Clint the Soldier and Diego the Archer. These guys are always with you, and the good thing is, they never die. If the run out of energy during a battle, all they do is 'fall back' and join up again once the battle is over.

Although picking one of the good teams from the Premiership means cash, good players and long cup runs, the chairman will expect success and failing to deliver means the sack.

Race around exotic locations in a choice of luxury sports car included to whet your appetite are models by McLaren, Ferrari, Jaguar and Lotus. The spectacular crashes are much more extravagant than before, but unfortunately some of the more appealing aspects of the original have been removed! Gone are the police cars and traffic of the first game, and instead you race on secluded roads. Bummer. The track design is very good, but the lack of speed and many glitches spoil the enjoyment.

"computer Video games ALBA AL UNUM The No.1 game of the 1997 AOU show in Japan recently went on test in Sunnyvale, California. Ace US correspondent, Slasher Quan, was lucky enough to be there! The Lord ota Wanapire ARCADE SPECIAL REPORT apcom's monsters-of-myth fighting games, Darkstalkers (Vampire) and its successor Nightwarriors (Vampire Hunter), have achieved phenomenal success in Japan, and an unfortunate near lack of interest abroad. In fact, Capcom Coin-Op was so skeptical about the chances of success for Nightwarriors that the company chose NOT to release that game at all in North American arcades, except as a small-quantity extended test piece. Instead they focused on the destined-to-fail-miserably Street Fighter: The Movie coin-op. Well, the few scattered fans of the series (such as myself) who were dedicated enough to seek out either a test piece of Nightwarriors or the little-seen Saturn version will be absolutely, positively overjoyed with the third in the series. Once again this is an upgrade, not a full-blown sequel, smartly entitled Darkstalkers: Vampire Saviour. At one time Capcom planned to call the US version Jedah's Damnation, the reason for which is beyond me (story details to explain this Vampire Saviour\" scenario have yet to be revealed), but they finally settled on Vampire Saviour as the universal title, which sounds completely awesome. HITS Anakars HIT ARCADE And it is. This is perhaps Capcom's most dramatic \"upgrade\" ever, at least as revised and feature-laden as SF Alpha 2 was in comparison to SF Alpha 1. The game is still on the CPSystem II board and NOT CP-System III as misreported by web sites everywhere. But, the game's backgrounds are almost all completely new, and some of the best hand-drawn 16bit scenes ever. Further, there are at least four new characters, and the old characters are retrofitted with new moves. Brilliant new sound effects, a new Dark Force mode, and an idiotic (in my opinion) new Killer Instinct-type round system complete the feature list. 3 "


"REGENERATE. THEN DIE computer video games nakara SSC CC104 Let's start out with the worst first. Much like Killer Instinct, Vampire Saviour offers not the traditional twoout-of-three round system, but one long round where each character gets two life bars. When you lose your first bar, you fall over, and then immediately stand up powered by your second bar. While this sounds fine in theory, there's a huge flaw here. The old two of three system ensured that even if you got your ass smashed in the first round, your chances of winning the second and third rounds weren't reduced. Now, quite obvioy6ly, the farther you fall behind, the harder it is to come back. This new system simply ensures that the better players will be that much more likely to win, and discourages new players from getting into the game. Also, timeworn traditions such as giving weak players the second round for free, or just experimenting in the second round after winning the first will never happen. The second alteration to the round system is regeneration. When you take a hit, the damage is represented by a transparent block. If you can manage to avoid any further hits for a few seconds, you can actually regenerate that entire hit back to your life bar. If you do take a hit during the regeneration process, you lose the first hit's damage permanently and the next hit appears transparent. This is actually a very cool idea because it encourages aggressive play and punishes turtling (waiting), but this semi-innovation can't make up for the one round system. GUARO CANCEL ARCADE SPECIAL REPORT Jedah Lilith THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE Q-Bee Bencia New to Vampire Saviour is Dark Force, a super meter-required mode which at first glance appears to be Custom Combos all over again, but thank goodness is nothing of the sort. Activated by a simple multi-button command, Dark Force lasts only a few moments, darkens the screen into a psychedelic swirling background reminiscent of the screenchange during an SF III super art, and grants a power unique to each character. For instance, Q-Bee can fly, and Morrigan splits into twins. With the power of the Dark Force you can get off some crazed combos, but this is not in any way a repeat of the out-of-control destructiveness of Alpha 2's Custom Combo system. PREPARE TO BE SCARED, VERY SCARED ARCADE Vampire Saviour's background graphics are downright gorgeous. All are new or heavily retouched, and Capcom has outdone itself with both spe, cial effects and all-around creativity. One of the most unique backgrounds is a darkened metropolis scene with myriad skyscrapers. It takes a moment for you to realise that the warped view is not of characters standing on top of a building, or below a building, but right on the side of a building! Apparently, Darkstalkers can break the laws of gravity. Another gorgeous one is the new shimmering sky of Anakaris' pyramid-dotted desert. Lilith has a hazy sun-drenched landscape overlooking Castle Aensland. Bishamon hangs out in a fearsome, deserted ancient Japanese village. BB Hood fights near a ramshackle hut in the bad part of town. To my eyes the shading, colour choices, and scenery paint a more luxuriant, interesting picture than any of the old backgrounds from Nightwarriors. 83 "


"computer video games THE NEW CHARACTERS Q-BEE LILITH Lilith is the least impressive new charac ter, as she's simply Morrigan's head swapped, costume-slightly altered sister, but I guess you can't have everything. She is quite cute, as she looks much younger and ditzier than Morrigan. Her moves include a legs-spinning-madly hurricane kick, an uppercut, and a move where she launches the enemy like an arrow out of a bow which springs from her shoulders. We already had a catwoman (Felicia) and a wolfman (Talbain), what other beasts could Capcom dream up? How about a beewoman! If you don't love this character, there is something wrong with you. Sexy in her ultra-cute costume, Q-Bee is just nonstop fun. Her attacks include quick, slashing strikes with her butt stinger, a swarm of bumblebees which descend and sting her foes senseless, a cross-flying, slash strike similar to Vega's old wall-leap, and a variety of command dash throws, which enable her to fly at the opponent and grab them if they don't block. Her super throw launches her at the opponent, and if she connects she wraps them into a giant cocoon hive thingy, which explodes. Her opening animation is hilarious: In bee form, she flies out of a pot of honey and transforms into her normal winged humanoid shape! JEDAH BABY BONNIE HOOD ARCADE SPECIAL REPORT Okay, someone at Capcom is demented. Seriously. Baby Bonnie Hood's not just some sort of kung Fu crusty, she's Little Red Riding Hood with guns. Lots of guns. Short-range sub machine guns, a missile launcher, and a couple of big green army types in fatigues who help blow away her opponents in a super. I kept looking for the button to set off a nuclear device, maybe it wasn't in the prototype. Her normal attacks have very little range, and mostly involve pimp-slapping people with her picnic basket. She also summons her Granny during a super. Are you afraid of the big bad wolf? Whoa, Capcom has created an evillooking, gnarled, razor-nailed (yeah they're at least nine inches), gothic Grim Reaper-type humanoid with a completely unique look, personality, and attacks. He wields a gigantic scythe and uses it in multiple murder ous ways. For instance, he can throw/roll the scythe on the ground, and it swings with unbelievable range, 'If the opponent is unfortunate enough to jump and land on the whirling blade, they'll be slashed and suspended in the air, opening up a possible juggle combo. Jedah also has a variety of hellacious supers, and many of them create literally full-screen graphical effects. In one he sends forth a gigantic purple wave which can engulf the enemy and suck them in for massive damage, and it's completely unblockable! In another, a scroll drops down at the back of the screen, and Jedah signs a decree (presumably for your death). ONE OF THE COOLEST FIGHTING GAME CHARACTERS OF ALL TIME, PERIOD. NEWI hamon Gallon ARCADE 84 "


"computer video games Anar APR 120 Limue382 FCB GOUTETSU, ATLAST? rosa  Capcom has a tradition of including \"location test\" endings in its games. Though test versions never have the real endings (and rarely have final bosses...it's unclear whether Jedah will be the last boss or if some other, even beastlier character will be the boss), all test versions of Capcom games include SOME sort of ending, usually a placeholder graphic with a message such as \"Thanks for playing,\" \"See you next time,\" No Endings yet!,\" or a combination of the above. One of Jedah's INCREDIBLE Super EX moves. Wa-oow!!! Sasquatch demonstrates his new wind-up punch EX move.  Well, the test version of Vampire Saviour featured something REALLY unsettling: a placeholder ending with the usual thank-you text and illustrations of several characters, one of which was...(drum roll)... Goutetsu!  Let me preface this by saying the graphic might simply be a red herring from Capcom intended to torture the minds of players at the test site (the Alpha 2 location test ending wasn't in any way devious, but it was certainly one of the funniest \"fooled-ya, ha ha\" test endings ever). However, the screen I saw definitely, positively depicts either Goutetsu or Gouken. I'm pretty sure it was the former, but I only got to see it for a second. It most assuredly was NOT Akuma (aka Gouki in Japan). True Street Fighter fans, of course, know the obscure storyline: Goutetsu trained Gouken and Akuma, Gouken trained Ryu and Ken. Akuma allegedly killed Gouken and Goutetsu, but maybe one of the masters survived.  Could Vampire Saviour mark the long-awaited debut of Goutetsu as a hidden character? If so, I will be extremely NOT PLEASED because this momentous event should take place in a Street Fighter game, but what ever...why ask why?  The chances that Goutetsu is actually playable in Vampire Saviour, in my opinion, are absolutely minute. However, it's hard to imagine Capcom including this graphic for no reason whatsoever. If this mysteri, ous character does make an appearance in Vampire Saviour one way or another, remember you heard it here first. I don't think any other English-speaking magazine editor has yet bothered to play to the end of the game, nor do I imagine it likely that any other editor could even identify this little known character. ARCADE SPECIAL REPORT Boon (Capcom have responded to the Goutetsu question. In fact it isn't Goutetsu who appears in the end sequence. Goutetsu isn't in Street Fighter III, or Vampire Saviour. This character could still be in the game however, but he IS NOT Goutetsu) CVG LASTCUTS Other things to watch out of for in Vampire Saviour are: a godly all-new intro featuring all the characters; a totally redone select screen; a computer opponent which in the test version) was impossibly hard, maybe the second hardest Al of all time next to only SSF |Turbo (the CPU Jedah could take off 100% damage with two different supers!); spectacular new music, sound effects, and voices (for the first time in years the Capcom announcer actually sounds forceful, dark, and foreboding, the way a fighting game announcer should sound you must hear his insane laugh!). The chain combo system seems basically unchanged from Nightwarriors, love it or hate it. NEW MOVES FOR ORIGINAL MONSTAS Vampire Saviour features a total of 15 characters: the four new Darkstalkers plus Demitri, Morrigan, Felicia, Victor, Jon Talbain, Lord Raptor, Hsien-Ko, Anakaris, Bishamon, Rikuo, and Sasquatch. What about Donovan, Amanda (Anita in Japan...you know, Donovan's little companion from Nightwarriors), Huitzil, and Pyron, you ask? Gone to the monster graveyard in the sky, apparently. Maybe some of these characters will be included in the final version of the game...but I wouldn't count on it. ARCADE SAVIOUR Not to be forgotten, the OMS (as opposed to OGs, or original gangstas, a term for Los Angeles-based hoodlums who've been around a while...I love warping stupid American slang) have all been retrofitted with new moves. The wackiest has to be Demitri's super where he turns you into a woman (even if you're playing as a male), and then sucks your blood. This is appropriately entitled the «Midnight Bliss.\" Other new moves include Victor's dashing giga-headbutt, Bishamon's rock drop, Hsien Ko's bomb toss, and Talbain's enhanced triple-dragon super. Overall, I think Vampire Saviour is shaping up to be a great game. If Capcom would just get rid of the Ki round system for the final version and make any possible hidden characters fit appropriately within the context of the storyline (I'd take Amanda over Goutetsu any day, save the old master for Alpha 3), I'd be more than pleased.

The offensive (DA,UT) super jump is a stan dard anti-fireball move that anyone can use. Some characters can \"two-in-one\" immediately from a normal move into a super jump! Overheads (aka top-downs), which have been around since SSF || Turbo, can hit opponents in the crouching position. Every character now has a standard \"hopping\" overhead: simply double-tap down with punch or kick. 2800 38:00 ORO TECH BOIS Parrying is possibly the most important and well-designed new addition to the Street Fighter engine in years. You can parry any attack except a throw/command throw. On the ground, you press T to parry a high attack (including jumping attacks, projectiles, standing normal moves, special moves, or anything else you would normally block high), or D to parry a low attack (including crouching moves or anything else you would normally block low). In the air, you press T to parry and bounce away from an attack, or D to and drop through an attack. When you parry an opponent's move, you often get the opportunity hit, throw, or even combo them immediately. Parrying is very hard at first and must be learned as a rhythmic movement. For instance, supers which hit multiple times (both of Ryu's super fireballs, Oro's Yagyou Dama) can be fully parried, but only if the rhythm is right. Think of it as: tap..tap..tap, and NOT taptaptap. Practice! Ibuki parries Ryu's punch move, then replies Smack! When you get knocked down, tap D as you're hitting the ground to quickly roll and land on your feet. You won't reduce the damage, but you will be in a much better retaliatory position than if you had been laid out on your back. : STRATEGY GUIDE Alex lands an overhead punch on Oro.

SUPER ARTS CROSS COUNTER T,DT,D,DA,A+P Use this move against opponents who jump often. It does more damage in this case than they'll cause, Wait a minute, Dudley's not blocking...? 6 CORKSCREW DRILL Use this super when people are close to you (i.e., when someone's getting up). COMBOS REVERSAL ROLLING THUNDER This is useful when people miss a move at close range. The range is better than the Corkscrew Drill, but it's got a long lag when you start the move. ROCKET UPPERCUT This is great when people jump at you. It can also be used when someone's close to you and you're getting up, but it's not as invincible as the Corkscrew Drill. It's also great for juggle combos. 1. Jump in Roundhouse, standing Short, chain into standing Forward, chain into standing Strong, chain into standing Fierce. 2. Low Roundhouse (near the corner), Roundhouse Ducking Uppercut, jump up with Fierce, when you land do the Corkscrew Drill. MAXNow we know why! Poor Yun will regret being so confident! SUPER ARTS : STRATEGY GUIDE SPECIAL ATTACKS STRATEGY O FIREBALL DDT,T+P Ryu's standard projectile attack is still very effec tive, but there are more ways for enemies to overcome it than ever, such as the Super Jump. DRAGON PUNCH T,D,DT+P As it has been since SSF II Turbo, Ryu's Dragon Punch is not completely invincible. HURRICANE KICK D,DA, A+K Doesn't travel over fireballs anymore. 6 SHINKUU HADOKEN Same as it's been for the last three versions of SF. Probably the best all-around super for Ryu, it does great damage. Use it in a combo after a parry and watch 'em scream! He now has a longer fireball delay. so the old throw a fireball/hit them SHIN SHORYUKEN out of the air strategy isn't too effecIf they're REALLY close to tive. Your main strategy is to keep you, Ryu will switch arms them pinned down with Fireballs and do ultra massive damwhen they aren't at ideal jump-in age with this move. Try to range, and Dragon Punch or standing pull it at point blank range. Roundhouse if they jump. The standing Roundhouse is also good to push ODENJIN HADOKEN them away on the ground. Ryu's Possibly the most misunderstood super in the game. Do strategy overall hasn't changed the motion, then hold the button down as long as possithroughout the years, but you play ble before releasing it. The longer you hold the button, him much differently depending on the more damage and stun points you'll incur. At max which super you choose. strength you can get them dizzy in one shot, then follow with the combo of your choice! The 1702502 4200 best time to use this super is after you knock them down, throw them, or when you're at full-screen range. Try to get into a mind game. Start it up, and they may jump in an attempt to avoid it. Release it just as they're coming down and they'll eat big damage/dizzy points. Remember, this super is unblockable, so the only way for them to avoid is to jump or use a series of skilled parries. WIND-UP KICK D,DT,T+K This new move is devastating. It's great in combos, after a low Forward or low Fierce. COMBOS ARCADE 1. Jump in Roundhouse, low Forward, two-in-one into Fierce Fireball, super cancel into the Super Uppercut, when they're falling do a Roundhouse Wind-Up Kick to hit 'em while they're falling. 2. Jump in Roundhouse, standing Fierce, chain into standing Roundhouse. 89 "


"IL SEAN 33070 computer video games KEN SPECIAL ATTACKS 81350G =54E FIREBALL D,DT,T+P Ken's projectile is still very effective. you WIN DRAGON PUNCH T,D,DT+P Like in past games, the Fierce version ignites Ken's arm into flames. HURRICANE KICK D,DA, A+K Doesn't travel over fireballs anymore. Ken's dragon is as effective as ever! STRATEGY KEN ELENA SUPER ARTS If you don't know how to play Ken, you're... what... seven versions behind now? Ken plays much like Ryu, except of course with his supers, a couple of fun Forward kicks, and his multi-hit Hurricane Kick. The Hurricane Kick does lots of dizzy points so try to use it at close range. 6 SHINRYUKEN The straight-up vertical Dragon Punch super is best against jumping opponents or when you get up from a knock down. SHORYU REPPA The horizontally-travelling super reaches out for big damage, and can overcome all ground attacks. SHIPPU JINRAI KYAKU This new super is best used after you block an attack which leaves them vulnerable. Also great in combos. POMROS STRATEGY GUIDE 1. Cross-up Forward, standing Strong, standing Fierce, two-in-one into the Roundhouse Hurricane Kick. 2. Jump in Roundhouse, low Forward, two-in-one into the Fireball, super cancel into Shippu Jinrai Kyaku. Ken's end sequence shows his son and wife. I RYUS 103000 FREE PLAYLENE I BUKI 7500 ELENA Prep NON STRATEGY   She relies on her normal moves far more than special moves. Approach the opponent and do her T+Strong overhead, her low Forward, and her low Strong, and occasionally her low Roundhouse. Keep all those moves in their face constantly, they have extremely high priority and are very frustrating. Her low Roundhouse has extraordinary range and can clean-trip a fireball thrower from 1/2 screen distance. If you have the Healing super and time's about to run out, start approaching them as if to attack, then super jump away, land, and heal before time runs out to win! SPECIAL ATTACKS I felt your rhytin! One of our favourite Elena moves. G MALLET SMASH T,DT,D,DA,A+P Use this when you're close. It's an overhead move, so they have to block it high. Think of this as very similar to Adon's Jaguar Kick from Alpha. SUPER ARTS ARCADE COMBOS RHINO HORN D,DT,T+K Use this early so that your foot is extended when the move makes contact. This can counter a lot of ground moves, but it MUST be used early. If they jump in as you start it, they can hit you out easily. Unfortunately, if they block it, you're left vulnerable. HEALING If you can implement this effectively, it's Elena's best super and one of the best in the game. When you knock them off their feet with a powerful move or a sweep, go for it. 1. Cross-up Forward, ducking Strong, two-in-one into the Roundhouse Scratch Wheel. 2. Ducking Short, two-in-one into the Roundhouse Scratch Wheel, super cancel into the Brave Dance. 3. Strong Mallet Smash, super cancel into the Spinning Beat. BRAVE DANCE Elena breaks down a bunch of quick Scratch Wheels. Use this when they jump. O SCRATCH WHEEL T,D,DT+K Use this to counter someone's attacks as you're getting up, or when they jump at you. SPINNING BEAT Elena hops in with multiple kicks to the face. Use it after a blocked move. CAPCOM CO. LTD., 1997 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 90 "


"SUPER ARTS computer video games SPECIAL ATTACKS STRATEGY 6 YAGYOU DAMA Probably Oro's best super, this is very versatile. It has a slow start-up time so don't use it when they're close on the ground, but once it's out, it's a devastating weapon. You can launch multiple Damas on the screen at once. Try to make them land on a Dama and get juggled when they jump at you. Also, you can get them trapped in the corner and use Oro's overhead Fierce combined with the Dama pressure to make them crack. G FLYING PUNCH (ONIYANMA), Charge D,U+P Use this when they jump or when you're getting up. It has a tiny horizontal range but great vertical range. FIREBALL (NICHIRINSHO) Charge A,T+P Use the Jab on the ground a lot, and the Strong version when they jump from far away. Only use the Fierce Version if they're going to jump from point-blank range, It's a really loose comparison, but Oro is sort of the Guile of SF IN due to his charge moves. In fact, standing Strong can advance you while keeping your charge, similar to Guile/Charlie's Forward hop. Oro wants to keep Jab fireballs in the enemy's face when far away, but avoid throwing them when close because the opponent's projectile will come out faster and stop Oro in midthrow. His best normal moves are standing Forward, standing Fierce (overhead), and low Fierce (high damage). His low Strong has surprising range and effectiveness. When they jump at you, jump up with Roundhouse. Standing Strong can juggle them very well. TENGU STONE This unleashes a bunch of random objects which distract the opponent, and they shield Oro from above. Every time Oro attacks, the objects will follow up by forming into a barrier in front of him. Any opponent foolish enough to retaliate will get slaughtered by the objects. HEAD STOMP (JINCHU NOBORI), D,DT,T+K Use the Roundhouse version of this move from within half-screen distance when you sense a fireball. You can two-in-one into the Forward version at point-blank range, which will actually cross them up (force them to block, the opposite direction or get hit). This move can be done in the air, which will often cause them to get crossed up. KISHIN RIKI This super enables Oro to grab the enemy in a super slam simply by touching them. A fun-looking move, but Yagyou Dama simply has more havoc-causing potential. MULTI-SLAM (NIOURIKI) T,DT,D,DA,A+P This is a superb command throw. You can use it in combos. COMBOS 34600 nuntry 520 1 000130600 76 1. Cross up Forward, standing Forward, two-in-one into Multi-Slam. 2. Jump in Fierce, low Forward, two-in-one into Fierce Flying Punch 3. Throw a Yagyou Dama when they're near the corner. A) If they try to jump away, let the ball hit them once and then do a crouching Fierce, they'll get hit by the ball again and you can do another crouching Fierce etc (up to three Fierces total). B) If they don't try to jump, instead try a low Forward if they're going to block high, or an overhead Fierce if they'll block low. Either way, if they mis-block, the Dama will hit, and then you can follow with a low Forward into the Multi-Slam. Play After picking his nose Oro flicks a large 'snotball' at Dudley. II ALEX 53800 ORO SPECIAL ATTACKS : STRATEGY GUIDE STRATEGY G FLASH CHOP D,DT,T+P This can be used in combos or to set up a throw. It has limited range but is effective. Try to get close and use your power hits such as standing Roundhouse and standing Forward. If they're in your face with moves, use the amazingpriority standing Short to counter almost anything. Crouching Strong at close range also counters almost anything and does a lot of damage. Try to get the Power Bomb in as much as possible, and if you're using the Hyper Bomb, be willing to take a few hits in order to get it off (this crazy super will  probably end the match). G AIR KNEE SMASH T,D,DT+K Whenever someone jumps at you, immediately use this move to nail 'em. It's comparable to Rose's Soul Throw from Alpha 2. You can also use this move to grab opponents who are jumping AWAY from you. SUPER ARTS O POWER BOMB T,DT,D,DA,A+P Jump at the opponent without attacking, then do this when you land. Or do it after a Flash Chop. You can also Dash forward and do it which is very effective and surprising. 6 HYPER BOMB This is a ridiculously powerful piledriver which can be imple mented as easily as Zangief's old Spinning Piledriver, but with the added bonus of complete invincibility on activation. It can grab almost any move, even Dragon Punches! Probably Alex's best super. AIR STOMP Charge D,U+K If it connects, Alex stomps 'em into the ground for big damage. As this is a high attack, the opponent must block high. Use this when people are approaching and they want to play foot games. STUN GUN HEADBUTT Like Birdie's Bull Revenger, this sends Alex flying through the air (conveniently, over fireballs), enabling him to grab them for big damage. When it connects, it leaves them DIZZY, setting up a combo. Altogether, you can take off 70% life with this super, plus added combo! ARCADE Alex is one of the stronger fighters! COMBOS HIT SUPER ARTEKISA 52100, BOOMERANG RAID This is used after a missed block attack, and it sets up a grab at the end. Marginally useful compared to the other two supers. 1. Jump in Strong, standing Forward, two-in-one into Jab Flash Chop, Power Bomb. 2. Stungun Headbutt, dash close, Fierce Flash Chop, Power Bomb. 3. Jump in Roundhouse, A+Fierce. 91 "


"computer Video games NECRO STRATEGY Ich WVIDITE Throw out random moves such as standing Forward and standing Strong. If they're blocking high, go for the Rubber Grab. If they jump in from close range, use A+Roundhouse or low Strong to hit them out of the air. He's sort of like Dhalsim... keep them out, but if they get close, go for an EM Blast or Slamdance. 6 ELECTROMAGNETIC (EM) BLAST T,D,DT+P (keep tapping punch) Good air counter, also use it when opponents are close. This has surprising range and does solid blocked damage. I NECNO 06 NECROTIT RISING COBRA D,DA,A+K Try this when they're getting up for a nasty surprise; they have to block high. Also, use it if someone jumps from too far away and lands shallow. FIRST ATTACK SUPER ARTS 415 COPES MAGNETIC STORM Probably Necro's best super, this should be used when they jump or as a super cancel from an EM Blast or Tornado Hook. Be sure to tap the button for extra damage. FANG VIPER T,DT,D,DA,A+P Use this move to go over projectiles and sock 'em in the face and put them on the ground. They must block high. SLAMDANCE This move is used in the instances Necro's Blanka like electricity does little damage. when the enemy is vulnerable, much like Alex's Hyper Bomb. Another good super. TORNADO HOOK A,DA,D,DT,T+P Necro swings his arms around and goes for a very useful triple-hit combo. If the Fierce version connects. you can super cancel from it. The Strong version inflicts solid block damage, plus they can't retaliate. COMBOS STRATEGY GUIDE RUBBER GRAB A,DA,D,DT,T+K This grabs them if they block high, so they have to block low. Decent range, this move will surprise opponents now and then. ELECTRIC SNAKE Used when you think opponents will block high or in combos. It has fullscreen range, but is slow in execution. 1. Standing Strong, two-in-one Fierce Tornado Hook, Slam Dance. 2. EM Blast, super cancel into Magnetic Storm. I GENE1200 901 SPECIAL ATTACKS Seppo STRATEGY SEAN TACKLE D,DT,T+P Hold down the punch button to follow through and grab them, or release it to stop short. If you follow through, it can only be blocked low, but if they do block you are very vulnerable. TORNADE D,DA,A+K Use this in combos or randomnly when close, If it hits it takes off lots of stun points and good damage. Okay, now DON'T call him Dan! In case you didn't know his hilarious backstory, Sean was Ken's student but Ken abandoned him, so obviously Sean is meant to be the weakest (near Dan-like) character in the game...but he's not all that bad, actually. Use his Tornade when close and you think they'll do any standing attack. Use the low Forward two-in-one into the Sean Tackle, but don't follow through with the tackle...release the button, then repeat the Forward two-in-one for an annoying pattern. Only go through with the Tackle once in a long while or you'll get too predictable. Try to get jump-in opportunities for your Tornade combos. SUPER ARTS DRAGON SMASH T,D,DT+P Just an uppercut with an added slam dunk bonus. 6 SHORYU CANNON Probably Sean's best super, this can unleash massive damage and can be substituted for the Dragon Smash in combos. Be sure to jam on the button for maximum damage. FLYING DROPKICK (RYU BI KYAKU) D,DT,T+K This is almost useless, so use it sparingly to surprise them. It can go over fireballs. ARCADE GHADO BURST Very fast, but not much damage. Stick with one of the other supers. ROLL D,DA,A+P Nearly identical to Ken's Roll from Alpha, this move, can be used to advance for cheap throw attempts.  HYPER TORNADE A super version of the Tornade, this move is good after you block an attack which leaves them vulnerable. COMBOS 1. Cross up Forward, low Fierce, two-in-one into Tornade. 2. Jump in Forward, low Forward, two-in-one into Dragon Smash. 3. Jump in Roundhouse, standing Roundhouse, two-inone into Jab Sean Tackle. 92 Sean's 'Dragon' knocks the opponent up then down. "


"20697 IRUKI computer video games STRATEGY AIR STOMP (KUBIORI) A,D,DA+K Use this move at mid-range distance and you think they'll do a fireball. This is a very good move because it's hard for opponents to retaliate against it, and even if they block, you can add on a dagger afterwards for extra blocked damage. Get close and alternate between low Roundhouse, her Triple Kick, jump-in Roundhouse, and the Air Stomp followed by Dagger. Keep the Daggers raining down and throw them while retreating when you have the lead. Otherwise, attack constantly with her high priority moves. G DAGGER (KUNAI) Jump and D,DT,T+P This is a very good projectile, sort of like Rolento's knives. However, the ability to start it any time in the air gives you great control. Ibuki's throws are extremely effective and annoying! 5900 5900 COMROS ELECTRIC SLAM (KOHOU), T,DT,D,DA,A+P This command throw is used primarily in combos, as it's blockable. 1. Jump in Roundhouse, standing Strong, standing Fierce, Electric Slam. 2. Jump in Roundhouse, low Forward, two-in-one into Triple Kick, (optional) after the first hit of the triple kick super cancel into Hasho Sho. TRIPLE KICK (TSUMIJI), D,DA,A+K, then K OR D+K Do the motion with kick to send Ibuki into a double kick move. Hit kick again for a third high kick, or down+kick to go low with the third hit. This is a good ground game pressure move. Sometimes you can get a rhythm going and trap opponents with little way out. SUPER ARTS KE8900 200 ML RISING KICK (KAZEKIRI), T,D,DT+K Use this is an uppercut-type move, used against jumping opponents, or when you're getting up. YOURI DOUSH Can only be used in combos. If you are a master of combos go for it, but as it's blockable, it's not too useful during a normal match. This is her best super if you are good at combos, otherwise go with Hasho Sho. OPEN 194194 TREES SLIDE THROW D,DT,T+K This can only be blocked low and is extremely fast and often surprising. It's great to go under fireballs. However, it leaves her vulnerable if they block it. Do this when they're walking back and forth a lot. KASUMI SUZAKU A very good super, but only if you can get it off when they're fairly close. If they're more than 1/2 screen away, the daggers won't combo and will only take off marginal damage.  CAPCOM CO. LTD., 1997 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED HASHO SHO This can be used for huge retaliation after you block a move which leaves them vulnerable. : STRATEGY GUIDE FINAL BOSS UPDATE AL Gill is the final boss in SF III. He only has one super, but that's more than enough. It's called Resurrection, and it literally brings him back to life after defeat. You effectively have to beat Gill all three rounds in a row, because by the second round he's usually charged up the Resurrection. It's quite worth it though, because SF III displays the finest hand-drawn cinematic ending art ever (through the stories are all generally lame). Capcom has confirmed the existence of a code to play as Gill, but won't say what it is yet. Stay tuned. ALEX 2160311 ARCADE Both Gill's fire and ice sides are equally powerful. 93 "


"CONTINUED FROM PAGE 26 computer video games With the largest booth at the show (joint with Capcom), nobody could beat Konami for the variety of games on offer this time around. With games on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64, it was a gamer's paradise for those tough enough to battle their way through the teeming crowds, waiting to get a go on one of the following. WYGAM 2997 KONAMI. GOEMAN 5: (N64) Release Summer 573 ABY 5973 Our Japan correspondent, Warren Harrod, had a long go on Goemon 5, so he can go into quite a lot of detail here. There were two main options available normal game mode or the 3D boss mode. The 3D boss mode lets you battle the huge 3D robot boss that's been seen in all the mags up to now. The Z-trigger fires some kind of gun while another button allows you to punch. The 3D stick moves a \"gun sight\" around the screen. You are continuously moving forward all the time while the 3D boss is running, jumping and flying around the area in front of you. In the normal mode you can change between Goemon and Ebisu at any time. At first you are in a town but you can also explore a castle and the lands around the town. You can talk to people, collect money and attack baddies. Entering buildings, swimming and jumping from various blocks is also possible. There are two main problems firstly the main game engine is obviously not complete. Not only does the game have a tendency to crash (it frozeup several times and needed to be reset), there are all sorts of clipping problems with the polygons. At one stage, where I fell off a cliff into a waterfall and tried to jump, the screen went crazy! Although I could still control my character he was obviously stuck by some faulty collision detection. In addition there was a beautiful mountain range in the bottom left hand corner (god knows from whence it came!). Another case was where you would walk along and suddenly appear to hit an invisible barrier, only to find (after moving around it) that it was wall or something that just hadn't been drawn. 120 TOKYO GAME SHOW 97 REPORT! 08 % % of 5736 282 Second is the viewing angle. Not only is the camera angle and positioning not adjustable, the computer's camera Al is terrible. Here are some of the problems I experienced: (i) You could walk off into the distance (getting smaller and smaller), then suddenly the camera would rush up behind you and you'd be back to full size again. (ii) The camera would not move in any way. Wherever you went, no matter how far away, the camera would just refuse to follow you. (iii) When turning left and right, you don't always have the camera behind you (usually when you are close up to an object). This makes it nigh on impossible to judge jumps or manoeuvre yourself around. (Not withstanding the confusing mish mash of polygons on top of that.) Other areas of concern are the character movements (Both when walking and swimming your characters move like badly-oiled robots) and the texture mapping (too plain and samey-looking). Generally speaking I'm more than surprised I'm shocked that Konami had the nerve to wheel Goemon 5 out before the public in this sorry state. No wonder most people left it alone or gave up on it in the first 60 seconds. Those who gallantly tried overcoming its problems were rewarded with their game seizing up on them. Yes this game was shown very early in develop ment (it isn't due until August in Japan), but then so was Mario. And that was godly even in November 1995! EN 573 A FEATURE DRACULA 3D: (N64) Release Unknown After the incredible PS Castlevania, it's difficult to imagine just how Konami could make it any better. But after seeing the demonstration video of this game it's just possible that they might be able to do it after all! (c) KONAMI 1997 94 If the in-game characters match Swinging across lethal pits is Dynamic battles too. Will it be these CG ones, it's gonna be cool! gonna be a whole new ball game! pure action or RPG-ish? "

With strategy games in the Populous style booming right now, Bullfrog have taken the game that started the whole ball rolling, and reinvented it to stay ahead of the competition. Rather than using an isometric view, P3 features landscapes more akin to those in Magic Carpet. Each level is now a complete wraparound planet! The control system is also drastically different. Gone is the 'influential' raising-lowering the land concept. Things are much more hands-on now, as you command your shamen to recruit wildmen, then instruct them to construct different types of buildings. Of course, you still get 'divine' powers as you become more powerful. Swarms of locusts and volcanoes being particularly spectacular! The animation on the little people is really superb. You can actually see them building the different houses. Your shamen can even preach to the enemy and they all huddle together and listen allowing you to take advantage and start attacking them! And when they charge into battle it's like a scene right out of Braveheart! Other features include the likes of spies which you can send into enemy followers camps. Should prove excellent for the multiplayer mode! PERREG arvel Superheroes Vs Street Fighter was recently placed on location test in the US. Apparently, Capcom wanted a totally goofy character in MSH Vs SF, so they hired an ultra-popular Japanese comedian named Norio from the \"tonnels\" comedic : team to design the new joke character. Dubbed Norimaro (a result of a Capcom naming contest won by a 13-year-old), he is an otaku (freak, or geek) who looks and acts like a nerdy Japanese schoolboy. He carries a bookbag and throws things like pens, triangles, and balls. He's a fan of Capcom video games and anime, and during his supers he dresses up in Megaman and other similar costumes. He idolises all superheroes, and for his taunt he holds open an  autograph book and asks the opponent to sign it. Charlie and Cammy have been dropped form the line-up and have been replaced by Sakura and Dan from SFA2. The two have been Marvel-fied like their SF brethren, with Sakura receiving a : powerful glowing Shoken (running uppercut). Dan has two new alterations, both  hilarious. For example, his Gadoken (self-taught fireball) creates a massive energy field around him, tricking you into thinking he's about to unleash the  most horrific fireball seen. But the Gadoken he throws is more pitifully small and : useless than ever... it must be only four pixels tall! The lack of new features makes MSH Vs SF pretty disappointing at the moment, but hopefully the finished version will be up to Capcom's usual high standards. 60% ADVENTURE BY REVOLUTION COMPLETE ROM PlayStation SEPT RELEASE 1 PLAYER 102C ADVENTURE BY LUCASARTS ROM AUTUMN 97 RELEASE 1 PLAYER BROKEN SWORD 2: THE SMOKING MIRROR THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND Parisian journalist Nico.

From the screenshots you can see that it looks identical to the arcade version, and will no doubt play just the same as well! Excellent! he return of the eco-friendly game! Survive toxic waste and pollution, plus all manner of inhabitants in the miniature underwater adventure that is Sub Culture. Partly inspired by the classic Elite, and movies The Abyss and Leviathan, Sub Culture sees you at the controls of a miniature submarine. Explore the huge underwater civilisation that you inhabit, searching for food, ore and clues to the existence of life above the waves. You play a prospector who must survive by making a living mining resources and trading. And also survive the threats of the various 'races' who roam the hostile waters. Gameplay is missionbased, with the promise of a very freeform : structure, while the realistic levels and characters benefit from 3DFX graphics cards. Criterion Studios : spent a long time researching (scuba diving) to get the graphic style right. Sub Culture looks like a great : way to cool off during those hot summer months. 96 "

Lobotomy have said that it's not possible to make Quake a link-up game as it would slow the action down too much, but it should include all of the one-player features from the : PC version. Saturn Quake will rule! After Rage's appaling conversion of Doom on the Saturn, id are being very careful about releasing screenshots of Lobotomy's Quake on the Saturn. They don't really need to worry we're played an early version of Saturn Quake and it's already unbelievable how good it is! Using a similar game engine to Saturn Duke Nukem 3D and Exhumed, the levels can be created almost exactly the same as on the PC, with just a few modifications to keep the speed up. On top of the PC features, Saturn Quake has real-time coloured lighting, making everything look even more solid! At the moment, only the start section and the first level have been done, but the latest version of the game has enemies in ast month we showed you the world's first pictures of Duke Nukem 3D on the Nintendo 64. Now we've got the first pictures of the four-player mode! It's been confirmed that Lobotomy AREN'T working on the N64 version of Duke Nukem 3D. It's being programmed by Eurocom (most recently known for their conversion of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on the Saturn). They've already converted many of PC Duke's levels and added a four-player splitscreen mode which will let N64 owners experience the delights of the Dukematch a simple battle to the death! The finished version will hopefully also have some nice lighting effects similar to those in the Saturn version (see page 38 for more details), so we'll keep you updated. 1 Four-player mode! NEW GAMES COMPLETE 3 D FIGHTING FIGHTING   PUZZLE BY GARAGE ASRUPN JULY RELEASE Illation 1-2 PLAYERS OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS 10: INTELLIGENT QUBE SUPER STREET FIGHTER II COLLECTION Super Street Fighter II Collection will include three games on two discs Super SF II, Super SF || Turbo, and a \"surprise\" game \"never before seen in the US\". Unfortunately, the original SF II, Champion Edition and SF || Turbo: Hyper Fighting won't be included. The \"surprise\" is almost definitely going to be Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha it was only released in Japan and included bonus versions of other characters and an excellent Dramatic Battle mode. nurrently at number one in the allformat charts in Japan, Intelligent Qube is a surprisingly good action puzzle game! Blocks roll towards your little character, and you need to blow them up by dropping a blue marker and turning it red just as a block moves : onto it. Bombing a black block will destroy one of the rows behind you, while a green block gives you a marker which will take out nine blocks at once. It's very simple, but gets extremely frantic and addictive before long. Hopefully we'll see an official release soon.
