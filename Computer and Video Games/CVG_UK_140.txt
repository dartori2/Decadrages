"WORD UP WITH GARTH ello chaps and chapesses and welcome to another mind-expanding issue of CVG packed to the HARD core with all the latest and greatest happenings in the world of computer and video game entertainment! Hottest news this month has to be Sega's Mega-CD! Released at the beginning of April, the initial batch of machines have all been sold, meaning that what's in the shops now is all you're gonna get until the Mega-CD 2 is launched in October! Meanwhile, we've got a 16-page CD extravaganza completely devoted to the latest compact disc technology. All the gen on the latest CD GAMES is there and we'll be sticking to CD tighter than a super-glued limpet over the coming months! So if you want to know what's scorching in the CD world before anyone else, stay with us! You want more?! Well, this month also sees the first part of our comprehensive Starwing Players' Guide to help you breeze through Nintendo's super smash hit space shoot 'em up! And, we've still got all the latest reviews of the hottest GAMES on the best machines! So do yourself a favour. Have a wash, go out and meet people and then settle down with the most informative, definitive and above all, greatest gamesplayers' read in the universe CVG! It makes a lorra lorra sense, chuck. See ya GARTH CVG CREW NEWS ALWAYS LOOK ON THE DARK SIDE! Regular readers should know that the only thing closer to Paul Rand than his shades are his Union Jack boxer shorts! 'If anything happened to my favourite specs,' he once said 'I think I might blub really pretty badly, actually.' On a recent midnight reconnaissance mission to a new and rather nice-looking beer garden, the nightmare became a reality and his beloved glasses slipped off his head and into the dense undergrowth. It was all our man could do to hold in the water and screams of anguish. Well, he's been wandering around the office with a face like a crumpled Cortina and no amount of chips or fizzy pop could raise his spirits that was until the CVG Party Hotline rang and those fabulous guys 'n' gals from Virgin invited the crew out to the Cool Spot launch party! And what were they giving away as the coolest accessories known to man? Inflatable beach balls, of course! AND an amazing pair of darkest spectacles! Life is once again complete for Mr Rand and he's started talking to girls, wearing clean undies again and everything! Down at the Virgin bash with our man Rand and his seedy chums. 'It's just fizzy pop Ma honest!' "


"MEET THE CVG CREW: WOOF WOOF! MES AMIS! he team are off for a romantic night out at the huge EMAP awards. They might even get to snog their dream partner against all odds... GARTH Garth's rarely seen with women, preferring the company of his Macintosh and a good keyboard. So, when he said he was off for a bevvy one evening, no-one thought anything of it until he was seen making his way to a gig surrounded by five beautiful fawning Dutch babes! The rest of the crew now have a newfound respect for the old smoothieespecially Gary 'The Book Whitta who's shortened his 'Snogging Stakes' odds to 2-1! GAMES OF THE MONTH: Starwing (SNES), WWF Royal Rumble (SNES) It may be a dog's life working on the world's biggest and best computer games mag, but we do get our perks. The lads and lasses on CVG work more late nights than Cynthia Payne in order to make sure that you don't miss one single scrap of detail and information in CVG's pages. So, when top softco Infogrames sent out invitations to travel to France for the launch of their next huge game, Asterix on SNES and Game Boy, the crew dispatched Steve and Paul, post-haste, to cover the fun. They didn't do much work and they didn't even bring us back a prezzie, but judging by the pictures taken at Asterix park they had a ball! Top marks Infogrames and the game looks the business! The boys fight over an Infogrames lunch! PAUL Mr Rand is disgusted with the whole team this month because whilst he was on holiday they decided to run bets to see who would get a snog with a girlie at the forthcoming EMAP Editorial Awards. He said running a book was a, \"..childish, immature and potentially hurtful thing to do.\" We think he'd have moaned less if he hadn't found out that his odds on a snog were calculated at an ego-crushing 20-1he didn't half waltz, though! GAMES OF THE MONTH: Final Fight 2 (SNES) Starwing (SNES) Spot the bozos who sat at the front DOH! One-way ticket to spew city! Paul strapped in, colostomy bag secured and sorted! GARY Bashful 'Snogging Handicap' bookie Mr Whitta may not be pop, ular with Paul, but he's certainly got some secret admirers at work! When he announced his own odds in the forthcoming 'Night of a Thousand Snogs', several people jumped at his modest 7/1 odds and placed  on him in five minutes! He used to be wary of girls but now he's terrified! One bout of tonsil hockey could end up costing him ! (No surprises there, then! -Ed) GAMES OF THE MONTH: Arabian Knights (Amiga) Starwing (SNES) JON Mr B is no stranger to the ways of lurve because his mum told him all about that 'frightful nastiness' when he was just a young scallywag. He's the most street-wise and sleazy when it comes to playing tongue tennis! However, his charming boyish looks, flowing girlie hair and lack of height have served to shorten his odds to an amazing 2-1! Won't his mum be proud! GAMES OF THE MONTH: Starwing (SNES) Tazmania (SNES) Wow! Gnarly MAN! The fastest, twistiest rollercoaster in Europe! d to shorten mum be proudNES) Tazmania No wonder Obelix has trouble walking! EARLY TO BED, THICK IN THE HEAD Steve wasn't going to go to the EMAP awards party cos, \"It's just not my thing manloads of suits, not enough rock babes and too many Barry Manilow records, you know!\" But when he heard that Gary had put him as a rank snogging outsider, he immediately placed his bet and got a ticket. We don't know why though, because he's always been fairly rank and only ever gets to kiss girls when they're outsideof their heads! GAMES OF THE MONTH: Starwing (SNES) Prince of Persia 2 (Mega CD) OCCOOC Continuing Mr Anglin's never-ending tales of Monday morning woe and his late-to-work shenanigans, we have exclusive proof that the man is a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic hamper! It's a familiar sight. 10am Monday morning and Garth, Steve, Gary and Rand are all stuck behind their computers, noses to the grindstone and there's not a single member of the Anglin species in sight! Then, with a sudden crashing of swing doors the young lad steams round the corner dripping wet, panting and gasping with yet another tale of train treachery and traffic tardiness! Garth's got so fed up with the lamer's excuses he's hired a top private eye to trace Anglin's footsteps on a typical journey to the office... 7am Paul's bedroom light comes on in Canvey Island's lighthouse. 8am Paul steps out the lighthouse door and stands in the rain for 20 minutes with his thumb in the air, waiting for a passing canoe to give him a lift to shore. 8.45 am He's still there! 8.46am Looks at his watch and decides to swim for it! 9am Finds a faulty orange traffic light and starts to dry his clothes! 9.30am Saunters off down the road and suddenly starts flapping his arms furiously, bird fashion, hopping in the air and squawking what sounds like; 'It's quicker as the crow Paul's sand pit sadness. Canvey Island's a oneflies!' 9.45am Collapses horse town! exhausted in a kiddies' playground and eventually hops on a wooden horse in the sand pit. 10am Arrives at CVG towers, still damp, on the back of a milk float and skips up the steps. (And if you believe that... You should be working here instead of Garth! Paul) JULIE Fresh-faced new girl, Julie has only just joined the ranks of the Crew but already she's sent the boys into a romantic frenzy. So far, the seat next to her at the EMAP party is selling for up to  but it's early days yet. However, the boys haven't yet realised that her boyfriend is 6\"2' tall and plays a mean game of Rugby. Needless to say, if any of the boys do try to kiss her, it's odds on that they may be playing with odd-shaped balls for the rest of their lives! ANGLIN Top, good-looking, ruggedly handsome superstars from Canvey Island are few and far between as Mr Anglin bears testament to. However, if he turns into his alter-ego, Shop Kid, at the award ceremonies, then all will be falling at his feet! Not to get to grips with his savage tongue though, but to place orders on the next run of microwaved pasties and cans of pop! The food at the awards is truly dreadful! GAMES OF THE MONTH: Lords Of Thunder (PCED) Super Mario Kart (SNES) STEVE Steve's been working overtime on his reputation as CVG's Mr Moonlight! It seems that Mr James is basing his life on JRR Tolkien's fictional character, Bilbo Baggins, in that he can't remain at any party for longer than 60 minutes without slipping on his invisible cloak and striding out into the night to party with persons anew! He was recently spotted by Jon in his blue VW staggering down Camden High Street at 2am Thursday morning. When the designer called out, all Steve could reply over and over again was; 'Leave me alone! So many parties, so little time! "

Arnie kicks ass in Last Action Hero this Summer Mega-CD owners should start wetting their pants now, we hear...     V. KNOW 3 AM Ed ALL-FORMATS SONY fter months of rumour, it's finally been confirmed that Sony Imagesoft has bought UK software house Psygnosis for a Imulti-million pound sum. The top-level deal's been on the cards for ages, but it's only been made official this month and the announcement paves the way finally for the release of games like Dracula, Cliffhanger and Last Action Hero, which Psygnosis is developing for Sony here in the UK. Sony's worldwide connections also open the door for Psygnosis games to appear on many more formats we've already heard that the 3DO version of Lemmings is now in development. The biggest title in the Sony/Psygnosis line-up for this year is undoubtedly The Last Action Hero, based on the BIG Arnold Schwarzenegger movie for Summer in which movie bad guys escape into the real world via a magic cinema ticket and are pursued by Arnie. The game's due to appear on every major format, from NES to Mega-CD and 3DO, with Arnie stepping in to film exclusive extra scenes for the CD versions.

"QUICK NOTES A TEENY WEENY WESTERN TEENY WEENY WESTER know that Street Fighter II on Super NES was one of last year's biggest games, but do you have any idea how many copies it actually sold? How about SIX MILLION copies worldwide? That's twice the amount that even CapCom expected to flog, making it one of the most successful console titles ever... SHOW fans will be pleased to hear news of the International Computer Show to be held between November 19 and 21 at the Wembley Conference Centre. Amiga and PC fans in particular should find it a treat, as the organisers say there'll be extra emphasis on leisure ie games this year. Might be a good place to pick up a bargain; call 081 549 3444 to find out more information. O VIDEO games, in particular CD titles like the controversial Night Trap, may have to carry a moviestyle age certificate awarded by the British Board of Film Classification, if plans for new guidelines go ahead. Sega has already agreed to put age ratings on its games in America, and if the media hysteria over here continues, 15 and 18-rated games could be on our shelves by next year... Yee-hah! Rootin' tootin' darn shootin' action, coming your way with Teeny Weeny Western. By the way, Rand just told me to make sure this caption fits. What does he know about anything? He can't even write a caption without using the words \"ahoy\" or \"hilarity\". Both, more often than not. RE has yet again slashed prices across its Amiga range. Now you can buy a standalone A600 for just , the \"Wild, Weird and Wicked\" bundle for  and the A600HD Epic pack for . If you're looking to upgrade to the new 32-bit A1200, you can now get a  discount by trading in your old A500 or A500Plus. Well, what are you waiting for...? f you haven't heard of Teeny Weeny Games before (and you probably haven't), it's a good bet you will have after the Summer, as the fledgling firm has a sackful of top products lined up for 1993. One of the biggest games in the TWG melting pot is Teeny Weeny Western, a SNES title described by the Teeny team as \"a cross between Monkey Island, Zelda and Carry On Cowboy.\" It's a full simulation of the Wild West where the player, as a rootin' tootin' cowboy, can go cattle rustling, buy and sell horses, gamble in the local saloon and even get involved in a drunken punch-up basically everything the real western heroes used to get up to. \"We are aiming to make the game as real life as possible,\" says TWG boss Angela Sutherland. \"At least as real as you can be with berserk cartoon characters.\" These exclusive CVG pictures are the first you'll see anywhere for a while, as Teeny Weeny has the game well under wraps, and it's not due out until Christmas. In the meantime, the company has a few other secret projects in development, including a VERY big licence to be revealed next month. Stay tuned... ACCLAIM'S conversions of Midway's Mortal Kombat aren't out yet, but we can reveal that the coinop company is already hard at work on the sequel, to be called wait for it Mortal Kombat 2. More news as and when... IT'S CES TIME AGAIN! A NEW SUPER SCOPE GAME! \"We sail into history,\" says Sean Connery in the film, which is quite good. We hope the game will be quite good as well, but we haven't been able to look at it yet, because Steve Keen's been playing Final Fight 2 all day. Zzzz.... s Martha and the Vandellas put it, Summer's here and the time is right... for going to the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. Well, they didn't put it quite like that, but you get the general idea. The point is that it's time once again for the UK video games industry to take a week off and fly out to the USA for a week for the bi-annual CES. where the yanks take the wraps off the very sexiest hardware and software, Previous CES's have seen the launch of products like the Super NES, Starwing and 3D0, so who knows what this summer's expo will throw up? Well CVG does for one! We'll be there, reporting from the Windy City for a Stateside special in next month's ish. Don't miss it! If you bought that Nintendo Super Scope pack and are now starting I to feel a bit of a wally because there aren't any games for it, fear not! There's at least one new title due on the shelves v soon. The long-awaited SNES version of The Hunt For Red October can be played with the bazooka-like peripheral as Captain Marko Ramius (that's you) defects to the US in the world's most advanced submarine, then takes on everyone from nuclear terrorists to environmental outlaws. As you've probably already guessed, it's a shooty-shooty game, with torpedoes, SAMs, bombs, electronic countermeasures and the silent \"caterpillar\" drive all at your disposal. Well, it's a start we suppose. All we need now is a steady flow of Super Scope games to follow this and it might have been worth buying one after all. In the meantime, there's a full review next month. This brings back memories of that classic blaster Sub Hunt, where you had to blow up all the boats and things to protect your own ship. With SNES SuperScope power behind it, this one should be just as playable! "

With rental games finally making the move out of rinky-tink video shops and into the big-name chains, it looks like they're here for good and Nintendo might at last be forced to finally swallow its pride and release its titles for rental too if it wants to keep up with market leaders Sega. ental games are here to stay and that's official.

"NEWSTE WO MORE big Summer movies get licensed... strap yourselves in for blasting action, Eurostyle... the MARIO movie... and some Super NES biggies from down under... VIRGIN SCOOPS MOVIE DOUBLE! O VIRGIN O 081 960 2255 O eise 993 is without doubt going to be THE year of big move licenses with Jurassic Park and Last Action Hero already signed up, Virgin Games has swooped on two more of this year's cinema blockbusters. The big story is Demolition Man, Sylvester Stallone's futuristic action movie in which he plays a top cop brought out of cryogenic freeze to hunt down a psycho killer. Both the movie and Virgin's game are due out at the end of the year, although an early 1994 release looks more likely for the game. As well as Super NES and Megadrive, Virgin is also producing a 3DO CD version, with Stallone being brought in to shoot extra scenes especially for the game! Then there's Dragon, which you might already have heard a bit about. It's the story of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, so it's no doubt choc-a-block with fightin' n' fumpin' action as Bruce slaps his way through all those classic chop-socky flicks. The movie's due out this Autumn, and the game is, unsurprisingly, a beat 'em up in which the player, as Bruce, takes on 12 different opponents in fights to the death. Bruce's mentor Yip Man is on hand to train you, and as you learn, more fighting moves are added to your arsenal, up to a maximum of 36 killer blows. Megadrive and Super NES versions are due out in the new year with, the programmers claim, advanced compression techniques squeezing over 30Mb of game onto a 16Mb cart!

LaserBeam, as the company is now known, has two Super NES games for release later this year, with the big-name Choplifter III leading the way. Following on from Beam's Game Boy stunner of last year, Choplifter III is a multi-directional scrolling blaster that should open the eyes of anyone who remembers the original classic. Fly your helicopter over a series of apocalyptic warzones, rescuing the hapless hostages and razing the enemy defences and installations to the ground. Still in development but already looking right smart (check out our exclusive piccy), Choplifter III is due out towards the end of the year. Another LaserBeam pot-boiler is ShadowRun, a futuristic graphic adventure with the player cast as a mercenary trying to recover his lost identity. Smart isometric displays are being used to give the game a look all of its own, and with proper icon control and pull-down menus, ShadowRun might well be the first real graphic adventure to appear on Super NES.

It looks as though the company will be coming out with a Super NES Starwing pack for around -a rumour which, at time of writing is still unconfirmed, but Nintendo has a reputation for releasing products with little or no warning, so it might even be on the shelves by the time you read this! We also hear that the Game Boy is due for a sudden price drop, perhaps to as low as .99 for the standalone handheld and .99 for the Tetris pack.

Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park is coming to cinema and computer screens this Summer after 65 million years in the making! In another mega CVG EXCLUSIVE (we said EXCLUSIVE), Gary Whitta reports on why Ocean's game is going to be every bit as big as the movie...) By the time you read this, Jurassic Park will have just opened in cinemas across the USA, and unless something has gone terribly wrong, it will already have broken just about every box-office record in the book. You see, we're talking about a film that's a monster in more ways than one. Directed by Steven Spielberg, it's a creature feature to make the likes of Godzilla and Jaws look like your average home video. The movie, which has cost Universal Studios over a hundred million dollars to make, comes to Britain on July 16th, and Ocean plan to launch their Nintendo and computer versions shortly after, alongside a tidal wave of other official Jurassic Park merchandise, from toys and T-shirts to coffee mugs and pencil sharpeners. This one is going to be BIG.

No less than TWELVE top coders, artists and musicians were drafted in to create the Amiga and PC versions at Ocean's HQ in Manchester, while across the Atlantic in California, a crack team of seven have been working on the SNES, NES and Game Boy adaptations, Despite the amazing secrecy surrounding the film, Ocean's developers have had top-level access to movie material, including the shooting script, pictures of the dinosaurs and characters from the movie and even a meeting with SFX wizard Phil Tippett to discuss how the in-game dinos should look and move! you swear blind that the dinosaurs you view on screen are real. Sound like a tall order?

But when the electric fences that keep the dinosaurs penned in are knocked out by a power cut, the giant lizards go on the rampage and the defenceless human visitors have to fight for survival. promote a film that promises to show the audience dinosaurs so lifelike you'll believe they're the real thing! WHAT'S THE PLOT? So what's the game all about then? For a while now Ocean has been promising that it'll be a film licence like no other. It's a cross between the eight-way blasting action of Gauntlet and RPG adventuring Dungeon Master-style. The player is cast as dinosaur expert Alan Grant, stranded in the middle of Jurassic Park when the dinosaurs bust loose. The idea is to stay alive long enough to find the dinosaurs' underground breeding ground and destroy their eggs to wipe them out. «The game developed from the idea that the real stars of the film are the dinosaurs that's what the gamesplaying public wants to see, say Ocean's US developers. «They want to blast the heads off a few and run away and be chased by a pack of them. The game is not all shooting, though there are large elements of strategy.\" In fact, in the first part of the game the player won't be able kill the larger dinosaurs, like the giant Tyrannosaurus Rex, at all the idea is you'll feel hunted and have to rely on your wits to find the means to fight back. «What we have VIRTUAL REALITY A multi-million dollar mix of hightech science and prehistoric peril, Jurassic Park tells the story of a revolutionary island safari park where genetic boffins have managed to recover dinosaur DNA from prehistoric times and use it to bring them back to life 65 million years after they became extinct! The cloned creatures are to be the main attractions in the world's most \"What's interesting about this project is there is as much science as there is adventure and thrills,\" says, Spielberg. «Jurassic Park is a cross between a zoo and a theme park. It's about the idea that man has been able to bring dinosaurs back to earth millions of years later, and what happens when we come together.\" What promises to make Jurassic Park so special is the amazing special effects that are being used to recreate the \"live\" dinosaurs that populate the park. Oscar-winning FX men like Phil Tippett of Star Wars and T2 fame were brought in to build the towering dinosaur models, and Industrial Light and Magic has used the latest computer animation technology to make GAME DIRECTION With a project as massive as Jurassic Park and Steven Spielberg, overseeing every aspect personally, the video game versions are expected to be every bit as impressive as the movie, which is why Ocean has assembled two of the largest programming teams ever to work on the games on "


"JURASSIC PARK Pterodactyl laughs in Jurassic Park! OOOTO Inside the storeroom. SIX THINGS YOU (PROBABLY) DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT JURASSIC PARK Production on the movie was halted after the Hawaiian island of Kaui, where the location scenes were filmed, was blasted by Hurricane Iniki. Although the book is very gory, the film's been toned down to allow for younger audiences. Jurassic Park might even become part of school lessons as it's being used as the basis for a whole course of learning about dinosaurs, using special study packs for schools, which includes a trip to the cinema to see the film. The only other films we can think of with dinosaurs in them are those ones like The Land That Time Forgot and One Million Years BC, which all had stupid rubber models and iguanas with toilet rolls stuck on their heads, not fabbo ILM computer graphics. The Japanese are going bonkers for Jurassic. They love Godzilla and all that guff, SO JP is right up their street. Over 10 million Jurassic Park battery testers have been handed out to the Japanese public to promote the movie! It's got some of our fave actors in it, including Sir Richard Attenborough (who was tops in The Great Escape), Laura Dern, who's a bit fit and Jeff Goldblum, who plays a mathematician ranting on about Chaos theory. Probably been drinking too much of the Holsten Pils that he advertises. avoided doing is taking the original plot, chopping it up into little bits, and making subgames of each one,\" says Ocean's British develop ment team. \"We have practically ignored the plot and just recreated the situation that Grant finds him self in. From there on you create your own plot.\" From the screenshots here, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Jurassic Park is a straight Gauntletstyle arcade adventure rip-offbut players are in fact in for a twoin-one treat, as the game changes dramatically as you reach the closing stages in the story. In the movie, Dr Grant and his pals discover that the dinosaurs have been breeding in underground hatch'eries, and have to venture into the gloomy caves to hunt them down. 'In the game, the viewpoint switches to a first-person perspective for an atmospheric adventure through the nest network. «As in Ultima Underworld, here we have really drawn on the scary ZX81 classic 3D Monster Maze, but taken one step further in the ability to retaliate,\" says the UK team. For the Super NES version, the atmosphere is expected to be particularly tense as the game uses Dolby Surround Sound to create three-dimensional sound effects. Don't play with the lights off! WHAT ABOUT THE REST? Ocean Software is taking care of all floppy and Nintendo versions of Jurassic Park, but the Master System, Mega Drive and Game Gear versions are being done by Sega themselves T-Rex laughs ahoy! and you know what they're like for secrecy, so unfortunately there's nothing to show on the Sega versions as yet. There's also a Mega-CD version which uses digitised sound and video footage from the film on the way and, perhaps most exciting of all, a 3DO version using the latest animation technology to recreate controllable characters that look like real people!

I MICHAEL CRICHTON HIS ELECTRIFYING BESTSELLER TURASSIC SEE THE FILM, PLAY THE GAME, READ THE BOOK Long before it was a potentially blockbusting film and game, Jurassic Park was already busting blocks on the bestseller lists as a novel by Michael Crichton. A bit of a sci-fi top 'boy, Crichton had already written an armful of SF novels (including the Andromeda Strain) and directed movies like Westworld and Runaway. Jurassic Park, though, is reckoned to be his best work yet, and we'd recommend you read it as it's bloody excellent. There's rather a cooky sub-plot about chaos mathematics causing the dinosaurs to escape, but if you can get your head round that it's a top read. Spielberg apparently jumped at the movie project immediately after having read it, so there you go. LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE BOY! Normally you'd read about this sort of thing in GO!, but we thought we'd keep all the Jurassic stuff together for one big lovely CVG feature. The Game Boy version is basically a carbon copy (apart from the colours, of course) of the NES version, which in turn is a slightly simplified version of the Amiga, PC HE and SNES games.

THE CHALLENGE D ack after last month's humiliating defeat at the hands of Big Breakfast n Zag, CVG's Gary Whitta was nevertheless excited by the prospect of taking on some of the top stars in the Premier League \"I'm match fit,\" claimed the bullish Whitta. \"I'm just glad to be here, and MATCH ONE I'll be giving 110% to make sure I don't let the boss down.\" (You're damn right! -Ed) Appropriately enough, the challenge game was to be Nintendo's Super WHITTA US Soccer on the Super NES played, thanks to the help of those ever-nice people at Nintendo, on a five-foot Game Boy with a colour screen hooked up to a SNES! Due to the rest of the CVG team playing an away game at Disneyland in France, it was up to Whitta to swallow his pride as a life-long Tottenham fan and travel to Arsenal's top-secret training camp to take the team on alone! alie THE PRELIMINARIES Ithough their on-pitch antics may suggest otherwise to some supporters, Arsenal FC is a team with a lot of pride and they weren't about to send just anyone into the Killing Zone to take Whitta on. So, before the gauntlet was picked up officially, the squad gathered round the gargantuan Gameboy to find out who was the most worthy challenger. A few decisive kickabouts later and it was decreed that team captain Tony Adams and goalkeeper David Seaman England regulars both were the most worthy challengers. So, one after the other, up they stepped up to take on Whitta and find just WHO really is the Pride of London!S nter the towering Arsenal captain and top England defender Tony Adams for the first round, to be played over a single five-minute match. Showing the same resolute demeanour and nerves of steel as he does on the pitch, Adams picked up the joypad and promptly asked «what button does what, then?\" Whitta, however, resisted the temptation to tell him all the wrong controls and thus gain an instant advantage and instead gave him a quick crash course in how to kick and dribble properly what a sportsman! Once the soccer school was over with, it was time to pick teams naturally, Adams went straight for England, with Whitta content to settle for the powerhouses of Italy. A titanic match-up if ever there was one. So, with the pre-match formalities Gon on son! "


"MATCH Two Nintendo WHITTA VS Nintendo stranded and taking the score to 10. Whitta thought about celebrating with some kind of comical donkey chant, but Adams looked a bit big and hard, so he decided against it. What followed was a rather dull affair almost as boring, in fact, as the real FA Cup Final that was to follow with both players locked in a tight midfield battle for the remainder of the first half and much of the second. But with time ticking away and Adams desperately in need of a goal to salvage his team's pride, the big man took the gamble and pushed everything forward in an eleventh-hour attack. In the end it proved to be too much for the tired Whitta, who made a grave defensive error just by the penalty spot and let Adams slot the ball into an open goal. The final whistle blew just moments later and the draw was secured. Metro, Nintendo's champ, has a bash. over with, it was time to take to the pitch and get down to ACTION! Adams kicked off and immediately took control of the game with his manager looking on and still to pick Saturday's Cup Final squad, he couldn't afford to put in an off-key performance. Within the first twenty seconds an Adams attack resulted in a thundering shot on goal that Whitta had to stretch to save. Ooh, so close! Whitta was knocked off kilter by this initial display of Gooner magic, but he could give as good as he got. From the goal kick he roared down the wing like Roberto Baggio after a vindaloo and had the England defence in tatters with a succession of silky passes around the box. Finally, when a suitable opening had appeared in Adams' back four, Whitta took the opportunity and shot into the top corner of the goal, leaving the keeper hings were looking bad for Whitta as the Arsenal crowd gathered behind goalkeeper David Seaman for the crucial second round. With the Adams clash ending in stalemate, it was all on this second game and Whitta faced the near-impossible task of getting the ball past England's Number Two goalie! Gulp. Too late now, though, for lastminute nerves. The crowd was getting impatient, and the time had come to do the business on the pitch. There was no surprise as Seaman also selected England, but Whitta, obviously in need of a tactical change, tried his luck with Germany, the World Cup holders. Game on! Early on, it looked as though Whitta would be taking the game to Seaman. The moustachioed maestro may be a brick wall in front of the old onion bag, but like all goalkeepers he's not so hot when moved into an outfield position. With Seaman's midfield hopelessly neglected, Whitta was able to slice through it like a surgeon's knife BANG! But as suspected, when it came down to a one-on-one situation with the keeper, Seaman's manually-controlled goalie was equal to everything that Whitta could throw at him. With Whitta unable to get the ball past Seaman's Number One shirt and Seaman's lack of outfield skill making him no problem for Whitta's defence, it looked as though a 0-0 bore draw was on the cards all the way into the second half... ...when Whitta, visibly frustrated by Seaman's catlike skills in front of goal, decided he was having no more of it. He knew Seaman had no chance of scoring all he had to do was get past the keeper to secure an overall Victory. And with a minute on the clock he did just that, finally prising open a hole in Seaman's last line of defence with a thundering shot into the corner that no keeper in the world could have done anything about. It had come from nowhere, but that one shot catapulted Whitta and CVG into the annals of soccer legend by securing an incredible 2-1 aggregate win over one of the most prestigious teams in English history! CVG! CVG! CVG! nado Mazza, Gazza and Gooner go gaming! OLIIIIIIIIIII Ninten Nintendo IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII Here's Whits with a famous personality. But who's the other feller? Why, it's Tony Adams! Meet the gang 'cos the boys are here! FINAL SCORE: WHITTA 1 — ADAMS1 FINAL SCORE: WHITTA 1 — SEAMANO (Nintendo Intendo intendo (WHITTA WINS 2-1 ON AGGREGATE) 25 "


"COMPUTER COMPUTER AND C C D E HEELEBR HAMLENGE (DEO GAN WINAN EXCLUSME NIENDO SHIRT ARSENAL! Credo WINNERS fith the challenge over and CVG's recentlydented challenge pride restored, Arsenal beat a hasty retreat to secret training rooms at an arcade somewhere in Brighton. The Gunners, so used to victory by now, were completely inconsolable. They may be able to beat Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 in an FA Cup Final but they decided to put in some practise before they took on the world's greatest games mag again! Hya V le kid you not. In between giving Arsenal a very comprehensive run for their money on the Super Soccer pitch, we also found time to get the squad to autograph an XL Nintendo T-Shirt for us. Just before they had to pop off for a session of top TV and newspaper interviews, they huddled together to EXCLUSIVELY scribble on this top-quality garment. All the top names are there, including Tony Adams, David Seaman, Alan Smith etc... in fact it's probably worth a few quid, so it's a prize well worth winning even if you're not an Arsenal fan. To win this UTTERLY FANTASTIC and BRILLIANT (not to mention PRICELESS) prize, all you have to do is complete this sentence in no more than 25 words in the most amusing manner possible. The entry that makes the CVG team laff the most will be bagging the shirt. Simple, eh? And if you think THIS is good, just wait and see who we've got next month! I THINK ARSENAL ARE GREAT/CRAP (delete as applicable) BECAUSE.. Nintendo Respect is, as ever, due to Nintendo for helping to get this month's challenge organised and for bringing Mario himself out for a rare public appearance to tread on people's toes and walk into walls as usual. Also thanks to Metro, Nintendo's 21-year old UK Champion, who came along to preside over the event and ensure fair play. He did offer to give us a game of Super Soccer after the official challenge had ended, but he looked a bit too good for us, so we ran away. Once you've come up with something hilarious, send it off on the back of a postcard or sealed envelope to I WANT TO GRAB A GOONER GARMENT, CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU, to arrive no later than 15th July 1993, 'cos that's the closing date. Don't forget that if you work for EMAP, you're not allowed to enter. So go away. 26 "

"REVIEW SUPER NES by ACCLAIM .99 | OUT: June. Contact Acclaim (0962 877788) for information. ME Shawn Michaels gets pancaked as The Undertaker looks on-ouch! ERET HATT Six-man action in the ring! NA ROYAL RUMBLEE Mr Perfect's about to be Mr Flat! CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR WWF Super Wrestlemania stood alone as the only SNES wrestling game, but now Royal Rumble's in town to take it on in a real Battle Royale. ho'd have thought that a bunch of fat, sweaty men in tights could make millions of dollars by just running around a ring and pretending to hit each other? Well, Macho Man Randy Savage, The Undertaker and the rest of the boys are once again taking the world by storm. The action in the ring is really hotting up, with Hulk \"I'm a real actor, honest\" Hogan making a dramatic return to the ring and the terminally sad Wrestlemania album riding high in the charts. So what better time for Acclaim to release another WWF fest on the SNES? One-on-one is a slightly more sedate way of displaying your grappling techniques. Two combatants enter the ring to do battle to the end. All the standard rules of the WWF apply in one-on-one matches. One pin decides the match, but it can often take ages to get, so there is generally a maximum time limit of 20 minutes and after that, the match is declared a draw. In WWE Royal Rumble though, there's no time limit; it's \"Winner takes all», as that oncegreat comic Jimmy Tarbuck said. THE UNDERTAKER MR PERFECT HE CAME OUT THE BACK DOOR These guys ain't no overweight grunters with girls' names! The stars of the World Wrestling Federation are many and varied, each with unique backgrounds and history. There's twelve of 'em to choose from in SNES Royal Rumble check out the list of grapplers you can select from! RANDY SAVAGE \"MACHO MAN\" Height: 6'2\" Weight: 237 pounds From: Sarasota, Florida. Special Move: Flying Elbow Drop. Height: 6'10\" Weight: 328 pounds From: Death Valley Special Move: The Tombstone. Height: 6'4\" Weight: 257 pounds From: Minneapolis Minnesota Special Move: Perfect Plex. 30 "


"VERDICT At first glance, WWF Royal Rumble looks disappointingly similar to the original Super Wrestlemania. But don't be fooled although Acclaim have used the same viewpoint as their previous title, the action in this little baby is streets ahead of its predecessor. It's the new options which make Royal Rumble stand out the three-man tag team matches are a hoot, and as for the no-holds barred Rumble itself it's a blast! Presentation is tops all round, with detailed and well-ani mated characters, each with their own sig nature tunes, and joypad control that's a cinch. It's just a pity that the long-winded grappling has been included, as it only serves to annoy. This is the best wrestling game I've seen — the WWF should be proud. Yokozuna thinks he's Dancin' Homer! SUORE PAUL RAND Gruntin', groanin' grapple action! SAD FOLK START HERE IT'S A REAL DING DONG BATTLE WWF Royal Rumble, as it's called, focuses on the wondrous once-ayear event of the same name. As well as this, you and a mate can also grapple in anything from a one-on-one match to a triple tagteam brawl with any of your favourite 12 wrestlers. The main selling point of WWF Royal Rumble, is the Rumble itself, which in real life is one of the biggest draws on the WWF calendar. The rules for a Rumble are simple: before the match, the combatants all pick a number out of a hat and numbers one and two enter the ring togeth, er. When the bell rings a timer is started and every two minutes from then on a new participant enters the ring until all thirty fighters have joined. The last man left standing in the ring is the winner. The only way to eliminate a wrestler from the Rumble, is to throw him out over the top rope, which can prove difficult when there's a fat get like Yokozuna in the ring. In the SNES Rumble, the rules are pretty much the same bar a few details: There are only 12 wrestlers in all who enter the ring at regular intervals until there's a total of six. Then a new wrestler enters the ring each time one has been disposed of, until all 12 have entered. The Rumble (both real and on SNES) is a free-for-all in every sense of the word you have to keep your beady eye on the bloke you're controlling because there's plenty of dou'bling-up action going on and you could be caught napping. So, you can only get to round 2 of the Championship Tournament eh? We frankly can't believe it, but If you're really that sad, try getting hold of an autofire joypad and turning all the switches on; that should help you win a few grapples and flatten the odd baddy. NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER TED DIRIOSE GARTH Up and over! Aiieeee! Round 4, eh? Don't get too cocky 'cos this is where you really need all your concentration to win. Make one mistake with these boys and it's all over. If you want to really wear down your opponent's enersy then try taking him to the outside of the ring that'll teach him. AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! Marvellous! Round 5 just one round away from that coveted WWF title. Don't go for the bodyslams straight away. Instead, use kicks and punches to soften up your opponent first and then chuck him to the ropes and use dropkicks and clotheslines to set him up for the biggie. 3-2-1 he's out!

"PUT THE FORK IN HIM HE'S DONE All the different characters in WWF Royal Rumble have their own signature moves with which to finish off their opponents, ranging from the Banzai Drop to the Million Dollar Dream. Here's a full list of all the moves and how to execute them: SPECIAL NOTE: You can only perform your special moves when your opponent's energy meter is in the red. THE NARCISSIST: Lex Luger uses the running forearm to knock his opponent out. Simply throw a sucker to the ropes, bounce off the ropes and press R. YOKOZUNA: He may be a fat get, but he can certainly knock the wind out of opponents with the Banzai Drop. To use this, knock your opponent down in the top half of the ring, go to the turnbuckle as though you were going to climb it and press R. This takes practice. MILLION DOLLAR MAN: Ted Dibiase is the richest inhabitant of WWF town, and tells everybody so. His signature move is aptly named the Million Dollar Dream. To perform this, walk up behind a stunned opponent and press R. RAZOR RAMON: To perform the Razor's Edge, Press R when you hook up in a grapple with your opponent it's a real killer! RANDY SAVAGE: To perform Macho Man's flying elbow, knock your opponent down near the turnbuckle, climb the turnbuckle and press Ryeah! MR. PERFECT: The perfect one has developed the \"Perfect Plex\" with which to finish his opponents. When your opponent's energy is low enough, get him in a grapple and press the R button to pull off the Perfect Plex. THE UNDERTAKER: The morbid maestro's obsession with death has led him to perfect the Tombstone Piledriver. Press the R button whilst in the grapple to see it. BRET HART: The Hitman uses all his excellence of execution to catch napping opponents in the Sharpshooter leg lock. When your opponent is down walk to his legs and press R. TATANKA: Mr Latin America finishes his opponents with the Reverse Fallaway Stun. To execute it, throw your opponent to the ropes and then press R as he comes toward you. CRUSH: To use the \"Cranium Crunch\", stun your opponent (this can be done by using the Atomic Drop) and press R while standing behind him. RIC FLAIR: He may be nearly as old as Garth, but Ricky has mastered the extremely painful Figure 4 leg lock. To hook it, stand at the feet of a fallen opponent and press that magic R button. SHAWN MICHAELS: The self proclaimed \"sexiest man alive\" has mastered the devastating Back Suplex. To perform this, stun your opponent, walk up behind him and press the R button. SHAWN MICHAELS YOKOZUNA TED DIBIASE \"THE MILLION DOLLAR MAN Height: Height:   6'0\" 6'3\" Weight: 234 LEX LUGER \"THE NARCISSIST\" Height: 6'6\" Weight: 275 pounds From: Atlanta, Georgia.

"SUPER NES FUPER Famicom intenaro.com SUPEA MENTENGO RANDY SAVAGE MB. PERFECT PROS: Superb graphics, great sampled tunes and absolutely frantic gameplay. THE VIEW YOU'LL NEVER SEE! CONS: The grapples really slow the action down and it can get a touch repetitive. Just look at them all, milling around and kicking each others' heads in while the referee's not around. Unfortunately, you'll never see a shot like this in Royal Rumble as we just pieced it together to show you the overall picture but it looks good, doesn't it! ON THE OTHER HAND GRAPHICS Superb digitised sprites with incredible animation give this a really authentic look. WWF SUPER WRESTLEMANIA HE'S A RING VETERAN Brawl is by far the most enjoyable option in WWF (apart from the Royal Rumble that is). Basically, rather than having to attempt to pin your opponent to win, you simply have to kick him in until he can no longer stand! Sounds fun? It is. It's even more fun when you've got a three-man tag team and you can take the action to the outside of the ring and seriously reduce your opponents' energy. The railings make a good weapon for throwing people into, as does the side of the ring. The chair is always good for picking up and hitting, people with but the best thing about brawl matches is that there's no referee to get in the way, so you can fight outside the ring without the worry of being counted out. Incidentally, in a normal onefall match you can whack the referee and knock him to the ground if you like; there's no real advantage to doing this, other than it's a bloody good laugh! One of the earlier games on the SNES, WWF Super Wrestlemania is still a fine cart. The digitised sprites are superb and the gameplay's intense. It's not quite as much fun as Royal Rumble, but it's certainly cheaper give it a blast! ONDOS Very satisfying \"oomphs\" and \"ahhs\" and great samples of the fighters' theme tunes. REVIEWED: CVG No 136 VERDICT GAMEPLI Great at first but the grapples take a lot of fun out of the game. The boys from the ring are bigger and badder than ever! Bodyslam, hit people with chairs and even Tombstone your opponents into submission. And when you've finished doing that why not take on all comers in the Royal Rumble? 12 wrestlers, one ring and fistfuls of fun. The Rumble is an absolute riot with one player, but get two along and it's mayhem beyond belief. The grapples can go on for absolutely ages and get incredibly tiresome, and at  this is one overpriced cartridge. But it's a good 'un, no doubt about At  you could be a bit peeved at the amount of action you get.

"REVIEW S NES by KONAMI .99 OUT: August. Thanks to Konami (081 429 2446) for the review cartridge. IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THE CRAZIEST GAMES WE'VE EVER SEEN. AND WE THINK YOU'D BE MAD NOT TO BUY IT! Iverybody lived a peaceful existance in Mad Land (actually it's not called Mad Land at all, but that's las good a name as any). The birds sang, the lambs leapt and the rivers flowed: that was until the evil Dr Mapdock took control of things. In one fell swoop the Doc invaded ) Mad Land and took everyone hostage, except for two youngsters by the name of Twin Bee and Win Bee. Twin's the snobby young lad who's got more morals than a high court judge whilst Win's the high spirited, reliable girlie who helps her brother along the way. Take your choice or play as a team; whichever way, you're sure of a cracking time! HELLS BELLS! 2P $) ORANGE The most boring pick-up. Purely for bonus points. BLUE Turbo boost! If you speed up past the 4th level you'll return to the first. The keys to the duo's success are the bells that can be shot from beneath the clouds. Blast the happy faces and the bells fly out of the top and drift down towards you. Whenever you hit them with a shot they'll change colour and move a few paces backwards. The trick is to change the bell to the colour you want and then snatch it up. Unfortunately the bells seem to edge towards you at the most inopportune moments and, just when you think it's safe to grab them, an enemy sprite zips in and takes your life! With practice you'll become just as nippy and have enough bells to start a campanologists fan club! GREY A powerful cannon shot to rip those fluffy pests to pieces! PURPLE Welcome to cloud nine well six'll do for now Three way multi directional shot. AWESOME! LEVEL THE TOWN Pick this up for a impenetrable shield. 11 GREEN When you transform, this icon adds one extra piece of equipment. FLASHING Yes! Seven stages of cute, mega action-packed kerrrazy Jap cartoon madness awaits visitors to Mad Land! Every level throws up a monstrous end-of-stage guardian who must be duffed up before you can get on with your journey. Some critters can only be defeated using special attacks and more often or not you'll have to get in real close to thump them on the nose before they'll give up and buy the farm! Try everything you've got until you find out what works best. If you're playing with a friend it's best to use a different weapon to that which your chum is battling with to find what works quickly. Unleash a huge barrage of bombs enemies and become untouchable! Attack ground-based enemies to release the heart which will restore your energy. Looks like the prickly guys have got some backup! 34 "


"LET'S FIGHT Twin Bee does the biz! Melons take a hell of a punch. 5200 Both Twin Bee and Win Bee have four modes of attack. Shooting blasts all the enemies that fly through the air the fastest and is the best way to get the bells. By holding down the Y button you'll build up the 'punch' to incredibly powerful levels and you can then release it at airborne enemies for a huge kick. The Y button is also used for throwing bombs at baddies on the ground but it's quite awkward to use and doesn't always target too well. The final attack can only be used when two players are on screen at once; the first player to press R will swing the other around and throw him. The player who is thrown then whizzes around the screen, knocking off enemies left, right and centre! Is this all a bit surreal or what? Cor blimey, guvnor! WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? VERDICT Centipede things! Aargh!! I was a great fan of Parodius, so I've been looking forward to this one for quite some time. Twin Bee is one storming shoot 'em up, incorporal ing lots of ideas from Parodius and spinning them through 90 degrees to give a top-to-bot tom blast par excellence. The enemies in this game never let up to such an extent, in fact, that if you're new to gaming you might find yourself getting a bit cheesed off after you've died straightaway for the umpteenth time. But don't let that put you off. Stick at it, and you'll find out just how good this is. Two players have never had so much fun with a simultaneous shoot 'em up. A second warrior can join in the jollies at any time with the second character, providing there are enough credits left. With the aid of 'Transformation', the Twin Bee and Win Bee can pick up various bits of equipment to beef up their pods at any time. You can select which of the three transforming modes to use at the start of the game. By selecting \"Normal, our heoes will be able to strap on extra bits and pieces etc when a player pauses. On the other hand, 'Surround' lets you strap on the hardware and attack forwards when spinning, while the 'Engulf' option will allow you to bend and morph across to the edge of the screen. When you release the button you spring back to your original position. PAUL RAND Big and blue and scary, too! S868 2P ONTINUE Ooh look! It's Mr Happy Cloud! ON THE OTHER HAND PARODIUS : :99 Parodius has been available for a while now, first on PC Engine and then on SNES. The action really is as mad as a camel in a wet-suit! Flying Octopi, large, semi-naked ladies and flying pussy cats are all amongst the oddness that is Parodius. A superb shoot 'em up that you simply must own if you're a serious blast fan! More to shoot here than at a fairground attraction, REVIEWED: CVG No 130 35 "


"CONTINUE VERDICT SUPER NES Vintencio SUPER Famicom SUPER MANTENERE Nice backdrops? We told you so! Konami is becoming my favourite software company in Gamesland. Everything it touches turns into a MONSTER! Fans of Parodius will go absolutely ape at the whopping cartoon animations and fabulously freaky sprites! Twin and Win are loaded with humongous power-ups and special weapons. The totally insane baddies come at you in waves thicker than a ostrich-egg omelette! There's hardly a single aspect of the game that can be pulled up, but if I was pushed I'd say it's a little hard for your average gamer, but that's VFM in my book! Get together with a mate and exploit the brilliant two player features and you'll be playing into the daylight hours. Another Japtastic cart from the arcade masters. mocne PROS: Incredible gameplay and more features than you know what to do with CONS: Only one it's damned hard. Younger players beware! STEVE KEEN Well coddle my whatsits! GRAPHICS Incredible! Beautifully drawn sprites and tons of humour. DP 580 CONTINUE TOKO TOKO The meandering pineapples found on the first level. Take 'em out with bombs. ONNOS Comical Jap samples and catchy sound tracks. OKE-DONGURI The paddling yellow pods of doom are also suckers for the big Bee bombs.

STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES KNOW YOUR ENEMY Here's a small selection of the bozos you'll be busting several guts over. They're all as cunning as a weasel with a doctorate in backstabbing, but they can be beaten if you know how!

"LREVIEW by CORE .99 MEGA CD Our: On import. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the CD. WONDEDDOCA PROS: Loads of levels and bonus stages and generally great music. CONS: Once you get the hang of things it's quite easy to complete. Every dog has its day is this Wonderdog's? When the dog planet K-9 was conquered by the evil Pitbullies, the only escapee was a young puppy. Unbeknown to him, his dad had injected him full of a strange chemical designed to enhance his doggy abilities. Now he's faster than a speeding whippet, can leap tall buildings in a single bound, etc etc. You get the idea. Anyway, he's been transported to Earth and has to find his way back to K9 in order to free it from its savage oppressors. Now who said muzzling dogs was a bad idea? 00134-ZZO GRAPHICS Large, colourful sprites and good backdrops. Man's best friend? I'd prefer a Grolsch! Han er landelier s NOOS Jolly CD tunes which sometimes run out of synch. HE DIGS! HE FLIES! HE SNIFFS OTHER DOGS! Well, almost. Wonderdog has many strange abilities none of which are dog-related. First off he has massive Prince Charles ears which, when flapped, allow him to glide gently to earth from any height, thus helping him avoid any embarrassing incidents with spikes. He can also tunnel Mario-style through certain types of ground. This usually takes him to a hidden chamber, although sometimes it leads to hazards, so you need to look before you dig. Wonderdog also has a rather unique ability. Should he collect a smiley face icon he'll sit down, start praying and hundreds of faces fly out of his bottom! Strange, probably painful, but extremely useful as it reveals all the hidden platforms. BUT IS IT MEGA? Go on, Wonder-get it sorted! Nothing original, but is helped by hidden stages. Wonderdog hardly pushes back the barriers of gaming technology. There's the now-obligatory CD intro, which is nice apart from the age-long pauses when it loads in the next scene. The best thing about this game being on compact disc is the music, there's loads of it and nearly all the tunes are fantastic, bar a few dodgy ones which would be more at home playing over the Gallery bit on Take Hart. The only problem with the music is sometimes the Mega-CD takes a few seconds to find it. Consequently, in the case of sections like the scarecrow boss, it's possible to finish before the music even starts to play. Extremely easy to progress once you get the hang of it. Wahay! Who's this cute pooch, then? *0004 BONUS LEVELS APLENTY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES  PODSUSOOD Sep 2* 07 Wonderdog's seeing stars! What's he been on? We should be told... VERDICT ONWOO lillllllll Unlike so many platform games of late, the entrances to the bonus worlds in Wonderdog are far from obvious. Usually you need to position yourself in the right spot on a platform in order to be spirited away. Most of the bonus levels comprise of a boring star world where you just have to collect a few gems and leap suicidally off the bottom of the screen to get back to where you were, but some stages have genuine extra levels attached to them. Beneath the surface of the cheese moon is an even cheesier mine. Down here are bonuses galore, as well as unfunny cheese humour involving fruity fromage and some kind of chedder-excavating machine. Levels such as these crop up throughout and looking for them adds an extra dimension to the playability, which can't be bad. If it wasn't for the music, you'd never know you were playing a Mega-CD game, but then if Wonderdog featured fancy sprite scaling or other such stuff, it would be totally over the top and wouldn't suit the action. Instead what we get is a decent platform game which plays like a cross between Robocod and Sonic. Wonderdog isn't the most versatile of characters, but the wacky, and sometimes sad, humour which runs throughout the game does create enough interest to keep you playing. With the lack of decent platformers on Mega-CD, this fills that gap perfectly. 82 PAUL RAND 38 "

"REVIEW MEGA-CDT by SEGA .99 OUT: On import. Thanks to ACE Consoles (071 439 1185) for the CD. RETUR You've seen it on the Pirate TV advert now play it on your MegaCD! S32 Blast the truck then knock the clowns off the side to destroy it. he Mega-CD's very first game-of-the-film takes us to the streets of crime-ridden Gotham City in the guise of the Dark Knight himself. The plot of the game follows that of the film, with Batman trying to clear his name after being put in the frame for murder by Danny DeVito, sorry, The Penguin. Naturally, the best way for him to prove his innocence is to beat up all the Penguin's henchmen then take on fat boy himself. Things aren't as easy as they first seem though, as Catwoman soon puts in an appearance and sets out to capture the Caped Crusader. WHERE DOES HE GET THOSE TOYS? Obviously, Batman has paid a visit to Home Base before setting out on his latest caper. He's kitted himself out with all sorts of excel lent crime-fighting gadgets, although he only has a limited, number of each. Extra weapons can be found throughout the levels, but they're usually tucked, away in obscure places and can only be found by punching innocuous-looking walls. Check out what you can grab! Regular Batarang: The dullest piece of kit, unless you happen to be on the receiving end of one. The Caped Crusader fails miserably in his attempt to rescue the Ice Princess, thus making it look as though he is responsible for her death. Smoke Bombs: These can't be thrown as far as the Batarangs, but they paralyse any character they land near. THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS \"AAARRRGGGHH'! Where would Batman be without his cape? Not only does it look good, it also doubles as a handy parachute, allowing him to glide menacingly onto criminals. To prevent him divebombing everything in sight, the cape also has a power level, which decreases when he uses it. Overuse can lead to embarrassing falls which don't exactly leave his enemies reeling in fear at the sight of him. Bat Swarm: Activate this and, Batman unfolds his cape, releasing a swarm of killer bats which home in on the nearest enemy. Grappling Gun: Fire this at a hapless foe and you'll knock him for six. 3918 Lucky for Batman that Alfred Turtle waxed the car to prevent scratches while driving fast through low tunnels. Homing Batarang: Does the damage of a normal Batarang but homes in like the Bat Swarm. 40 "


"VERDICT MEGA-CD Looking for top action on the Mega-CD? Look no further than Batman Returns! I flipped when I saw the driving section of this game it's truly fantastic. Combine that with the excellent sound effects, music and cut-scenes and it seems like Batman Returns is a real winner. However, I do think it's a bit of con that Sega haven't changed the platform sections, but it you haven't seen them before, you'd never know they'd come from the cartridge game. If haven't already got a Batman game, this is a fantastic combination of platform and driving action and you'd have to be completely out of your free miss it. HAVEN'T I SEEN THIS BEFORE? If you're feeling a sense of deja vu while reading this review it's probably because you've seen parts of this game before. The platform section appeared on the cartridge version of the game and is reproduced exactly here. The only difference between this part of CD Batman Returns and the title on cart is the CD-quality music, which adds to the atmosphere but doesn't do anything to alleviate the feeling of having been ripped off. The game can be played in three different modes, either with all the levels together, or just the platform or driving stages. This will be some comfort for anyone with the cartridge game who's been suckered into buying this one as well — but not much. PROS: Good mix of game styles and awesome graphics and music. CONS: The platform levels are lifted straight from the cartridge version. STEVE KEEN One step away from The Penguin's HQ, and he knows it. There are more hazards here than anywhere else in the game. SOIHd789 Excellent 3D and the animation on the platform stages is ace. Incredible soundtrack taken straight from the movie. SHUT UP, YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL! CONTINUE GAMEPLAY Challenging and large, this will keep you hooked for ages. Batman is every bit as hard in the game as he is in the movie. Apart from his groovy weapons, he can also bring his martial arts training into play, unleashing karate chops and kicks. He also has a grappling hook, which lets the cowled one swing from platform to platform in true Spiderman style. He only has a limited amount of energy though, and power-up hearts are few and far between. Fortunately, the levels aren't too massive and, once you find the quickest route, it's possible to get through without so much as a scratch. However, the bosses at the end of each stage invariably dole out a damn good kicking to anything that comes near them, so it pays to keep one of the homing weapons handy as it will locate the vulnerable spot, One of the best Mega-CD titles available. Well worth the price. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 8 Go for the heads, but be careful as they spite fireballs. VERDICT Keep alert when you're tailing this truck as the Jack-in-the-box flips open and dents the Batmobile's armour. WHO'S THE MAN BEHIND THE BAT? When Batman has to travel he does it in style. In this version of the game you get to try your hand, at driving two of his awesome vehicles the Batskiboat and the Batmobile. Both are equipped with turbo engines, machine guns and homing missiles and in the boat he can flip in 360 degrees around the sewer tunnels. Apart from the weapons you can also barge enemy vehicles into the scenery, which is lot more fun and saves on mmunition. These sections look stunning, with sprite-scaled 3D roadside objects and enemies. The bosses as just as good, especially the Clownmobile on level one, which comes complete with a jack-in-the-box that leaps out at the Batmobile. ONWA00= HIT Despite the smart new bits of electronic gubbins to be found inside the MegaCD, nobody's bothered to make any use of them until now. Batman Returns is a sight to behold — the driving sections especially, with their scaling sprites which at least match the SNES's Mode 7. Imagine my disappointment, though, when I got through the driving bit, only to be greeted by the bog standard platform game which appears on the original cartridge. What a rip-off! If you don't have the cart version, you won't be disappointed though this is definitely one of the best games to hit the Mega-CD, simply because there's some gameplay to be had. PAUL RAND "

"REVIEW SNES by CAPCOM .99 OUT: On import. Thanks to Raven Games (Tel: 081 663 6810) for the cartridge. FJAL** FISH FIRST REVIEW FINAL FIGHT IS A CRACKER BOTH IN COIN-OP AND CONSOLE FORM DOES THE SNES SEQUEL BEAT THE ORIGINAL INTO A COCKED HAT? GET TOOLED UP Okay, the guys and lass have meaty moves, but what about some weapons for inflicting proper damage? I'm happy to say that that tired old bastion of beat'em up weapons, the steel piping, has been dropped! What we do have are three beefy pick-ups to crack baddies balls with — the not exactly original, but handy when your back's against the wall piece of plywood, the all-new American nightstick which performs much the same function as the wood, and the trusty old kni you can stab with or even throw at baddies. You can hang onto all the weapons for a whole level, but if you drop them and don't scoop 'em up again sharpish, they'll disappear for good. 15DDU fter first revealing that Capcom are to release Streetfighter Turbo on SNES in the near future, the Japanese fist masters have now dumped their latest outing onto our very doorstep! Final Fight 2 is a cart of whopping proportions and if you thought the original was the best thing since Claudia Schiffer, wait 'till you get a load of this! More moves, incredible arcade graphics, special attacks and two whole new characters! You want more? Plant your backside firmly into your comfiest chair and nestle back for the complete lowdown on the next best thing to Capcom's Streetfighter 2 sequel! LOS 21BDDD 189650 ADREHEN Take that big boy, and have some more! . YAK! A BIN SCROUNGER Oh, so you'd hit a girlie would you?! Give him one in the Hudson Halls! HAGGARWRESYO Just like in Final Fight you can go rummaging around the bins and barrels for pick-ups and special bonuses smash everything that stands out. Sometimes you'll come up blank with nothing to show for your efforts, but usually you'll find something inside the damaged remains. The most precious pick-ups are energy-replenishing foodstuffs in the form of roast chicken, Coke, doughnut, milk, etc. These don't come along anywhere near often enough, so make sure you check every barrel or background object you encounter. The game still scrolls in stages from left to right, so if you're in the middle of a fight don't bash the containers until you're finished or you could be forced past the pick up point and be unable to collect your reward! Flamin' 'eck! High-kicking young lass! 44 "


"JOY'S IN THE PAD VERDICT PAD 118 Use for moving left and right and performing com binations of attacking moves with the buttons. Attack. Jump. Press together for special move. B Y+B We were all getting really hot and sweaty over Final Fight 2; it looked to be Capcom's next stormer. All of a sudden it just fell through the door unannounced and it's easy to see why. As fab and groovy as it may be, it's just too similar to the original to get you very excited. The graphics are an improvement on the original, but...erm.... that's about it, really! Final Fight 2 is just too easy until you get into the last few levels, but it's all a bit late by then. By no means a sad shambles, but not the wonder we were hoping for. FINAL FIT HAGGAR AGE: 50 HEIGHT: 202cm WEIGHT: 121kg PAUL ANGLIN I bet she drinks Carling Black Label! THE BIGGER THEY ARE... The Minister of Silly Walks gets ready to receive a sharp beating. SAD FOLK START HERE You all know the massive mayor from Bash Street. He's the only character to have made it through from the original game and it's only fair, considering that Guy's had his own version of Final Fight and Cody was a bit of a wife anyway! The last time it was the aging mayor's daughter who got snatched; this time... well, we haven't got a clue actually 'cos the copy we've got is all in Japanese! Anyway, Haggar's been completely tarted up and now has no less than seven attacking moves and a devastating special. And big boots. MAKI AGE: 20 HEIGHT: 169cm WEIGHT: 52kg Hurrah! At last, a female Final Fighter! The towering temptress is lightning fast and can whittle down the enemy quicker than any other character. However, she's not as hard as the two blokes and, although she's got eight lethal attacking moves and one special, she doesn't do as much damage per attack. She still kicks ass big time though, and bears more than a slight resemblance to that Chun Li wench from Capcom's other game! The last thing your sad ass wants to hear right now is how easy Final Fight 2 is. Well tough luck, buster! If you haven't got past this point with all your lives intact, stop reading CVG and go get yourself a copy of Sad Man Monthly! NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER PAUL He may look like a dodgy old geezer, but give him half a chance and he'll smack you into the middle of next month! Most of the bosses are escorted by normal thugs and the best thing to do is chuck them at him, then wade in! AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! There are scores of different tough nuts to crack, all with their own ideas on how they're going to bust you up! Here's a few of the real hard men and women and take it from us, some of them are real HARD CORE bruisers! ANDRE Yeah, we know he looks like that guy from WWF and he's certainly a giant. This guy comes in close for crushing bear-hugs and loves to rush up to you for a severe chest barge! MARY She might be a babe, but those boots aren't just made for walking they're there to stomp all over you! Mary and her mates spring in from high and rain down on your head with paddles that they carry in each hand. ELICK Fat boys need real toys when battling in the heart of the city. Elick is about as useful as Mr Bean and McAuley Culkin in a scrap. He powers up two cattle prods with thousands of watts of electricity, puts his head down and charges straight at you, Very shocking! JOE This guy's a red devil. Although his flaming bombs are deadly, when he scatters them about the screen he's more likely to hit himself and his buddies than you! STEVE This guy's rock hard and spins about all over the place. You'll never be able to take him with one life, so get a few free shots in at the beginning of a life when you're invincible and waste his energy with specials. ON THE OTHER HAND AGE: Unknowen HEIGHT: 183cm WEIGHT: 61kg Carlos is a martial artist-cumNinja and with his stealthy tactics he can leap in on the bad guys, kick, butt and then somersault out again, virtually unharmed. Permanently armed, Carlos will only use his sword for his devastating special attack; the rest of the time he just makes do with utilising one of his seven other awesome moves. Fast and furious, that's Carlos. Pity he's got such a crap name, really! STREETS OF RAGE 2 The MD can't match the SNES for sound or graphics, but Streets Of Rage 2 comes very close. The multi directionally scrolling beat 'em up has everything Final Fight 2 has and more. One on one, this comes out tops! 90 REVIEWED: CVG No 135 45 "


"MAKI G aler FIRST REVIEW! MOVES ON UP! Fast jabs and body combo. Standing jump kick. Ok, we know you're gagging to see the moves, so we won't keep you waiting. They start off bog standard and just get better and better. HAGGAR Head smacking elbow. Knee to the face. Rib cracking uppercuts. Ball busting belly flop. Parallel flying kick. High flying kick. Chest stomping flying kicks. Spinning pile-drive. 1V033ds Spinning handstand kick. Skull cracking double handed cosh. Leg-smashing body slam rather him than us! VERDICT One of the best moves, Haggar's combination choke and head bult. Excellent! Those Japanese joy boys have done it again! There's no doubting who's the king of arcade beat 'em ups on SNES; Capcom win hands down! Not two, but three characters all brilliantly animated and enemy characters which are a bit bland sometimes but look good against the plush backdrops as well as the simultaneous two player fun raise this one right up above the normal copy-cat dross.lt this had come out closer to the time of Final Fight's release it would have done a whole lot better. As it stands it's still great, bt this type of game has become just a little stale. Check it out, though. STEVE KEEN "


"VERDICT DOUBLE BUBBLE SNES Nintendo SUPER Famicom Final Fight was THE beat 'em up on Super NES until Streetfighter came along, but it did have its faults, the most obvious being the lack of a two player option. That's been rectified in the sequel and, with a pair of you battling your way through the levels, you get much more of a coin-oppy feel. With the new characters and their wealth of attacking moves, there's more to this game than the bog-standard \"let's rip off a winner and make a few bob' sort of stuff that sequels normally tend to be. Final Fight can be accused of being a little simple in the early stages, but generally this is a worthwhile buy. At last you can team up with a mate and play simultaneously, arcade style! No more arguing over who's going next 'cos you and your pesky little bro can now have a pad each and grapple, thwack and smash violent street thugs together! Get fed up of that and you can turn your attentions to one another and thrash the living jello out of each other! The graphics are far superior to the original and the animation, although not spectacular, far less limited. PROS: Non-stop action of near-arcade quality that's even improved on the original game's incredible achievements. PAUL RAND CONS: The gameplay's nothing new and can get quite repetitive. CARLOS GRAPHICS Arcade quality, very detailed backdrops. Boy meets girl. And what a big girl! Some good sound effects and music. WHAT'S IN THE SCRIPT Slap that face. Standing jump kick. GAMEPLAY Traditional left to right scrolling. Very repetitive. You should know the score by now. Follow the trail across the world duffing up tough guys! There's not much more to it than that. End of level bosses are amongst the biggest ever seen and the best tactic to use with them is to keep your distance and attack in small bursts, dodging their advances. The first you'll come across is the giant Won Won, who slices and dices with a huge chopper! Things then get even worse as the scary frame of Freddie hurtles onto the screen. But it won't be until the third level that you'll start feeling really taxed. Boatken is a complete psychopathic animal and has to be locked up. He breaks out in front of your eyes and from that moment on you know you've got trouble! High power punch. Standing side kick. When your attention wanes you'll still have to see what's next. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 3 2 6 O MONWAU lllllllllll Flying kick. Rolling throw. Ooyah! Bet that hurt! Tds MOVE Super sword slash. 83 Jump 'n' thump action! "

Lots of well-dodgy folk! upraraparaparaplelean enry Stauf, toymaker, puzzle-setter and allround complete weirdo, lived in an old mansion atop a craggy hill. You know the kind of place; dark, dingy and always surrounded by lightning. A bit like Garth's place, only slightly less Texas Tom. Well it seems that Henry disappeared when the children of the nearby town began to suffer from a horrible disease and then started dying. Strangely, a couple of months after his disappearance, six guests were invited to the  house...but none of them ever left. Only you are brave (or stupid) enough to find out what happened.

These sequences are activated when you find a puzzle, but you don't really have to play a puzzle to see one. Some just occur as you come into a room. They're not really frightening, nor are they likely to make you scream, but perhaps the game should be played in the dark, at midnight, with the windows open. Look at these shots impressive enough then try to imagine them moving in silky smooth 3D. E VERDICT RLERER Stop 'coffin'! Sorry, it just 'crypt' up on me! lalalalalalalalalalala B I'm really excited about CD technology and so when faced with what is said to be the greatest development in CD game technology I was eager to see it. Graphically, 7th Guest is stunning and sound is what you'd expect from the most popular sound medium in the world. But running on a PC means that to get the best from it, you have to be using a well-souped PC, otherwise you may feel a little ripped off especially at this price. In terms of presentation, th Guest is indeed the greatest development in CD games technology. But be warned the gameplay's a bit shallow. Bother in the bathroom!

"Dagmargarinagarza zamrzarea apararemerar2222 Blepeegergaardeederer WINDOW DRESSING The big selling point of The 7th Guest is the visual aspect the graphics are nothing short of superb. However, it isn't very interactive as most of the gameplay requires you to solve certain puzzles before moving on to others. You can't really do anything else around the house either you're restricted to exploring, seeing ghosts and solving the puzzles. But you've just got to see it running raytracing has never been used to this sort of scale before and it's incredible. Simply put, these visuals are so good they make everything else look like an old Atari VCS console game. Pros: Murder, mystery and the best sound and visuals this side of a TV screen. Cons: Gameplay is lacking and unless you've got a PC with bells on, forget it. Would you go for a party at this house? Draaraan reiralari agar GRAPHICS Amazing SVGA graphics, smooth 3D animation, video sequences... superb. Another view of the dining room. HELP! I'M STUCK IN THE CHIMNEY If you don't like puzzles and don't like getting stuck then this probably isn't your cup of tea. The 7th Guest is a murder mystery and ultimately an adventure. But deep down it's not cruel to its players and contains a helpful hintbook which can be found in the library. With this you can get clues on how to solve puzzles or if you're really stuck it can even solve them for you. Unfortunately, although it may well solve a puzzle it won't tell you how it's done, so you've still, got to do that for yourself. VERDICT 30 minutes of soundtrack, 76 tunes and 36 minutes of speech. Who could want for more? B   To my mind  is a lot to pay for a house with 23 puzzles in it, even if the graphics are superb. The problem here is that, not only are you going to need a BIG PC and a fast CD drive to get 7th Guest running as it's meant to but, even if you've got such a mega set-up, once you've been astounded by the pretty pictures and superlative sound you'll be quite perturbed to find that there's not a lot of gameplay to be had. 7th Guest is not exactly the bee's knees, more the bee's ankles but what sweet ankles they are! GAMEPLAY It's a mouse driven puzzle game and a difficult one at that. Jer/222Dezers BEBERLER endere Give us a song!

"by ELECTRONIC ARTS .95 SUPER NES as recom OUT: July. Contact EA (0753 466326) for information. SUPERNATUR 45332989 2 3 PROS: Playable and colourful with some good animation in places. CONS: Very simple; there are just not enough challenging bits to make the game last. Alien Ant In Lass Dash Crash Shock! here was Bob (space ant and all-round good guy), ready for a date with a hot girlie when his space Ferrari crash-lands on an uncharted world infested with grungy aliens and psycho robots. Looking at his watch he sees he's got a few hours to go until they're due to meet so, in true hero style, he breaks out his gun and sets about freeing the planet and getting away in time for his dinner date. GRAPHICS Being an agile chap, Bob can climb onto various tubes and pipes which make up some levels. GUNS GALORE For some reason Bob was going to show his bird his latest piece of alien-blasting kit. This multi-purpose assault rifle fires homing missiles, several kinds of laser and energy bolts and converts into a nifty flame thrower which is just the thing for spur-of-the-moment barbecues. Single: Least powerful, but has plenty of ammo. Treble: A moderately powerful shot and quite common. Energy Wall: Devastating but rare. Homing Missile: Also uncommon and it doesn't always home in too well on enemies. Flame thrower: Ultimate excellence. Fries anything, including pork chops. Depending on what you've collected you can switch weapons by pressing the L button. If all else fails, Bob's armed with a mighty punch, which sends the recipient reeling. This is on hand all the time, which is dead useful if you get caught out by a larger creature. Neat character, but some of the aliens are very poor. SOUND Average tunes which annoy throughout and very few effects. Watch out for these pods which spew out baby aliens. The planet is made up from a number of islands, each containing a variety of levels. GAMEPLAY Bob is fun to control and the large graphics make it pleasant to play. 23:333333333333333333 HOW AM I GONNA PLRI SUITY AND SWEEP Four-legged intergalactic ants, were they to exist, probably wouldn't be very effective when it came to a ruck. So it's just as well Bob has decided to wear his best combat suit to go out in. It provides him with protection from many of the nasty things the aliens squirt at him, although it depletes his energy. There are also slots where gadgets can be plugged in. These include a devastating smart bomb, helicopter and a handy instant platform which propels Bob up the screen. That said, it's as easy as it is cute. Gamesters hardened by aliens will go straight through it. Bob torches a robot gun emplacement with his flame thrower. ZONED OUT STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Should Bob buy the farm, you're treated to a 'humorous' death sequence. llllllllllll ONWA mm VERDICT The alien worlds Bob visits are divided up into several zones. These range from high-tech bases, which are nice enough to look at but harbour traps, to the alien caverns. Inside these you find yourself kneedeep in slime. The aliens, funnily enough, don't take too kindly to Bob's presence and will do everything they can to stop him. Early on they take the form of small, slug-type creatures which hatch from pods. These are dispatched with just a few blasts from the flame thrower, but the later creatures require multiple hits, and here's where the problems arise. Each weapon only has a limited number of shots, and as you start with the single-shot gun, you need to be very economic with ammunition. If you just go trigger happy you'll find yourself having to get a lot closer to the aliens than you'd like in order to punch them to death. Okay, I admit it, I've never heard of Bob. It's after home time and Garth's just given me the game to review. It did take me by surprise, though. Most games which appear from nowhere tend to be utter crud, and while this does have its cruddy elements, it is fun. If you're the type who struggles with most games you'll probably have a lot of fun with Bob. On the other hand, if you can vanquish the ravenous hordes of the Planet Quog with one hand tied behind your back, you'll go through this like lan Wright through the Sheffield defence. MISS OK!

TAZ IS TIRED Being a natural speed demon :24 isn't always a good thing. Sometimes Taz can get so carried away with his scoffing pursuits that he'll speed right past his prey!

If this happens it'll eat into Taz's precious time and that makes him MAD! Most of the obstacles can be torn to shreds with Taz's awesome spin, but try it on some of the meatier metal hazards, such as buses, cars driven by Buddy Boar and traffic lights and he'll come away with one hell of a headache! 52 "


"VERDICT TAZ IS MAD! | SUPER NES intendo UPER Famicom -> SUPERANTENDO After a bit of a hard time, THQ has finally come out with a credible game. The game is fabulous to look at, with incredible scrolling and speed, and Taz has got just as much character as his cartoon counterpart. What's lacking is variety. The game just keeps on going down the same route from start to finish. There's hardly any variety and, although the emergence of different characters throughout the game does inject some extra fun, they don't really do enough for a top mark. Great idea without enough meat on its bones. Other kerrazy cartoon characters are shoe-horned into the cart along with the whirling whirlpool! Wendal Wolf is an endangered species and jumps on Taz's back for protection. Unfortunately the wacky wolf covers Taz's eyes and you'll have to shake him off fast. Taz isn't the only devil in the desert and a butch she-devil has taken a shine to him. If she should catch our boy it's game over! Pterodactyls swoop in fast and low. If Taz jumps too high when they're on screen he'll be snatched up and carried way back and dropped on the track. Another wascally duo are Bull Gator and Axl. These two clowns scan the desert for animals that they trap and sell to the neighbouring zoo. They lay down traps such as black holes which Taz can fall into, as well as oil slicks that slow him down. They can also trap Taz in a net and if you don't wriggle free it's off to the zoo with you! PROS: Beautiful to look at, especially the later stages, with lightning effects and the sculptured rock landscapes from the cartoons. CONS: Not enough substance; just jump, run and collect. It's also granite hard. STEVE KEEN Uh oh! The trouble and strife! There's no escaping her now! GRAPHICS Great cartoonstyled animation and landscapes. 2 52 PRESS STA. Nice Taz noises, but music is poor. DE DDON V GAMEPLAY Repetitive and unfortunately unrewarding. There's no use getting in a spin over Buddy Boar. GIT A BIRD IN THE HAND Gives you more than a few chuckles whilst it lasts. SAD FOLK START HERE 'DOH! You can't get a level that's any easier! Now follow this advice; plug in your joypad, press the buttons and steer with the controller! If you really find this too hard then try not to use your 'Taz Spin' too much, (you sad man!) Oh, by the way, don't walk under buses or you'll get squashed!' Pick these boys up to get you through the game. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES BLUE BIRD Replaces some lost energy. NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER GARTH SE270 BONEExtra energy. 'Still not got it, have you? Oh well, take some constructive advice. There's tons of water on this level, including huge floods. The faster you go, the further you'll jump over them. Don't use Taz's spin unless you have to, otherwise you'll end up in the drink! ONWAO 000 LLLLLLLLLLL Q000 KIWI Collect them to get to the next level. ISS OK! AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! PAUL MEATExtra energy. BO, OBO AINY DAZE 'This game is rock solid in the difficulty department. On the latter stages the Kiwis bound all over the place, springing around and emergency braking in a split second.

Those crystals are dead valuable, grab 'em quick COVER UP! WIND A HON Armour comes in handy during your jaunt through the lands of Mistral. You can pick up Earth, Fire, Wind and Water armour and they protect you from different types of enemies. 49HON Gates Of Thunder is getting on a bit now, but while the original is flagging, the sequel has only just begun... In the beginning there was peace. Then along came Zaggart, the Dark One, threatening to destroy everything that mankind had ever worked for. But the Holy God Pharina and legendary hero Dyu imprisoned him in the centre of the six Lands Of Mistral. With Daggart bang to rights, the people of Mistral grew complacent until the evil beings of the Shadow Realm were allowed to return from the edge of the world. Then one by one, the Lands of Mistral fell to these evil beings whose only desire was to restore the Dark One as ruler of the Dark World. Landis is the only man powerful enough to stop them as the direct descendant of Dyu and, wearing the magic armour left to him by his ancestor, he ventures off, 0216 ready and willing to do battle to the end.

"VERDICT PC ENGINE CD Bloody hell! From the minute the title screen appears you're hooked totally for the entire seven levels. It's not just the huge amounts of baddies that come out of the woodwork, or the amazing rock tracks that get the adrenalin pumping, or even the mega hard and addictive gameplay; it's the simple, uncomplicated nature of the gameplay that makes Lords Of Thunder so hard to walk away from. If you like a good shooty, make sure your mind's emptied of all info before you hook up to this 'cos it's guaranteed to blow it! PROS:Immensely hard and fast gameplay and amazing rock tracks that really get the heart racing. PAUL ANGLIN CONS:Graphics are very simple and the concept is nothing new. I'm forever blowing bubbles. A LOVERRLY ASSORTMENT OF WEAPONS GRAPHICS Nothing special at all nice backdrops and some pretty smart end-of-level baddies. Blimey! SOUND ICONS, GET YOUR ICONS HERE The amount of icons that you can pick up and bolt onto your ship in Lords Of Thunder is staggering, here's a rundown of them: Red Crystal: One of these is worth 25 crystals. These will appear when you shoot enemies. Blue Crystal: One of these is worth five crystals. These will appear when you shoot enemies. Level 1 Life Orb: Restores two bars on the life meter. These cost 100 crystals. Level 2 Life Orb: Restores five bars on the life meter. These cost 200 crystals. Max Life Orb: Restores life meter to maximum. These cost 500 crystals. Level 1 Shield: Blocks one hit by an enemy. These cost 200 crystals. Level 2 Shield: Blocks two hits by an enemy. These cost 500 crystals. Max Shield: Blocks three hits by an enemy.

Some of the hardest and most thumping tracks I've heard, bar the new Pearl Jam album that is. What do you do if your raceproven, turbo-nutter ship gets a flat? You could always take it to the interstellar branch of Kwik Fit Fitters, couldn't you? Of course you couldn't, don't be so silly. You could, however, take it to Mrs. Miggins' Delightful Den of Death, Destruction and Deprivation. Okay then, so said shop doesn't actually repair flat tyres at all, but it does sell some great weapons. You can buy everything, from shields to bombs and even the odd continue. Everything has a price and, provided you collect your crystals throughout the game, you'll be able to afford a bit of a spend-up, and then you can really kick some monkey ass. LI GAMEPLAY Very, very hard. Very, very, very addictive. Very, very, very, very brilliant. There may only be seven levels but they're seven very hard levels. SHADOW BOXING These Shadow Realm types are a tough lot and there are thousands of them. Luckily, there are four different types of armour that can be used against them with each suit being named after a different element and comes complete with its own magic. The armour can be powered up during the game by collecting the powerups. Before every stage, you get the chance to choose which you wish to use, it's worth changing your armour around now and again so you can work out which armour works best with which particular stage.

"REVIEW PC by ORIGIN .99 OUT:Now. Contact Electronic Arts (0753) 549442 for information. TRA COMMANDER It's been two years in the making, it's been hyped to hell, but is Strike Commander the ultimate flight sim? t's 2011AD and the world is coming apart at the seams. The Eastern Bloc is no more, the good ol' US of A is going under fast and the skies are ruled by squadrons of mercenary pilots who'll do anything for cash. As a top fighter pilot, you earn your keep by flying missions for the Wildcats, the toughest, meanest and best-looking team in the biz. All you need to get started is a plane, half a tonne of serious weaponry and a few dozen sad characters to use as cannon fodder. Chocs away, laddies! DOG-FIGHT OR NOT JUST ANOTHER FLIGHT SIM, THEN? Strike Commander is a game of two halves. Most of the action takes place in the sky, where you'd expect it to be, but there are quite a few interactive bits where you get to rap with the other members of your squadron. You'll soon find out that most of the other pilots have chips on their shoulders. There are so many feuds, rivalries and personality clashes going on that it resembles a soap opera: a sort of airborne Dallas, if you like. Broad shouldered guys, beautiful women, lots of bitching and a hefty dose of sentiment thrown in for good measure. Let's face it, this game has more corn than the Jolly Green Giant. Get yourself killed and you have to sit through an oh-so-touching funeral sequence where your mercenary buddies stand around telling each other what a great guy you were. Hilarious stuff! As for the end-ofgame sequence, pass the bucket. Okay, so it's quite amusing at times, but once you've coughed up nearly fifty sovs, a bit of humour is only the icing on the cake. GWEN, I've been Meaning to talk with you about our last Ever wanted to be handsome, squarejawed and tough? Now's your chance! Things are pretty relaxed back in the tent. Click on the girl to save your game. One of the main attractions of Strike Commander is that it's supposed to be pretty hot on the dog-fighting action. Dog-fight? I couldn't even kill a ruddy hamster! But seriously, you need quite a bit of practice before you're up there with the aces. If you're as sad as I am, you'll probably find that your wing-man takes out all the MiGs whilst the only thing you manage to hit is the cargo plane you're trying to protect. Still, practice makes perfect and there's nothing quite like the warm glow of achievement that you get when your first kill is marked up on the fuselage of your plane. Hurrah! "


"VERDICT Fillion JONES. -134 Pilotostreported Squadron Leader Stern briefs you on your mission-guarding a cargo plane from enemy attacks. Right, let's get down to the nitty gritty. Strike Commander is a great game, but is it worth having? It's not a hard-core flight sim, but it's certainly a very professional product. If you're after an exciting and challenging flight game with loads of shooting to do but don't want the hassle of having to learn your way around the cockpit, you can't really go wrong with this. It's fast, it's furious and it's full of things to blast. Sound like your cuppa? Way to go, dude! PROS: Action, adrenalin, atmosphere. What more could you possibly want? CONS:Unless you've got a red-hot 486 PC, it's gonna be slow. GARTH SUMPTER Get yourself tooled up with as many heavy duty weapons as your plane can carry... Absolutely stunning: Gourad shaded polygons the works. A bit jerky on slower PCs, though. ONNOS Cinematic music, meaty explosions and, if you've got the Speech Pack, talking characters. ...then check out the mission map. Wouldn't want to get lost, would we? YES, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FLYING BITS? If you're after an accurate flight simulation, Strike Commander is not the game to go for. Although it does involve a lot of flying, it's really little more than a very sophisticated shoot 'em up. You don't have to worry about which key lowers your undercarriage and which key waggles your rudder (hey, I'm talking planes here, folks!) that's all taken care of by the computer. The game can even handle your take-offs and landings so that you can get straight into the action without worrying about crashing on the runway after five seconds. There are also some nice features, such as the missile view, the enemy view and the ability to turn your head and see where the enemies are lurking. So far it's looking distinctly promising. Follow the winding river! SEEN FAMEPLAY A bit tricky to master but enormous fun once you've got the hang of it. Bandits at ten o'clock! And you thought this mission was going to be easy? Think again. It's so quiet, there's not even a waiter! At nearly fifty quid, it's a lot of dosh to shell out for a game which you might not like. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Eat missile, sucker! Another rival merc prepares to die. 8 \"So he's dead anyone want another biscuit?\" ONWOO VERDICT Sit back and gloat as your first kill is marked up on your plane. OK! Strike Commander has loads of action, excellent graphics and a stunning soundtrack. But it requires such a ridiculously fast PC that most people aren't going to be able to run it at anything like its optimum speed. Although it will run on a 386SX, you'll need a 486 with a sound card to get the best out of it. It isn't cheap either, and although it's obvious that a lot of work has gone into the game, whether you rate it is really a matter of taste. Having said that, if you've got the hardware and the dosh, it's great fun. STEVE KEEN "

Things are hotting up in the Gasworks. IT'S OLD MAN WITHERS! ONWAO 00 VERDICT MISS I admit I'm a fan of the Wayne's World movie, but just as with the Home Alone series, T.HQ hasn't made the best of the film material. The movie follows two characters Wayne and Garth and that has good potential for a two-player game, but instead the programmers have concocted a \"Garth kidnap\" storyline to get him out of the way and come up with a much more formulaic platform romp. For what it is, Wayne's World is not bad, and the digitised sound and graphics add to the movie feel, but ultimately it's just not as good as fans of the film had every right to expect. Each of the game's levels is taken, from a scene from the movie, so you start off in Kramer's Music Store before heading off to the Donut shop, the Gasworks nightclub and the suburban nightmare that is Aurora, Illinois. There's no shortage of bizarro baddies on each stage (mostly mutant musical instruments like bagpipes, trumpets and accordions), but Wayne's armed with a guitar that fires laser bolts (eh? Ed) which fends them off, no trouble. Look out for the handy pick-ups that amplify the guitar and make it more powerful. 63 GARY WHITTA 58 "

"SUPER NES by RENOVISION .00 OUT: On Import. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the cartridge. TERUM Yet another Streetfighter pretender on Super NES? This is getting ridiculous... | OUCH, THAT SMARTS KNOW YOUR ENEMY These are the seven members of the Doom Squad once you've selected your character you'll have to take on the other six in turn. But it's best to know a little bit about them before offering them out... h dear. What a gloomy scenario this game's got. According to the manual, a band of alien gits called the Doom Squad have got together to destroy the Earth's natural resources, polluting all the drinking water and killing off the fertile soil. With the planet stricken by famine, governments around the world have collapsed, leaving the dodgy Doom Squad to take over. That is until you've stepped onto the scene to put things back the way they were by, erm... giving everyone a good kicking. As a Doom Squad defector, it's your job to duff over the six other members and restore life to the planet. Etcetera. Doomsday Warrior's rules should be familiar to anyone who's played SFII, Fatal Fury or Tuff Enuff before, but there are a few subtle differences. Scores are settled in best-out-of-three contests, but bouts can go on slightly longer than usual because the fighters' energy levels are slowly replenished while they're not actually smacking each other about. As a result there's no time limit, which gives things more of a relaxed feel. Once a famous athlete and crimebuster (?), Sledge is the goody of the group, and practices his punching power by knocking car engines out with his fists. A well-balanced fighter, Sledge is a bit like that Ryu chappy from SFII, with his own version of the fireball special move called the Magic Arrow Attack. The only female in this devilish band, Daisy is half-human, half-plant chlorophyll flows through her veins. Unlike most greenies however, Daisy thinks violence is great, and likes nothing more than smacking people around with her powerful arm chops and awesome leg whips. You have to be fast to beat her. Amon's fighting skills Nobody knows exactly what improved after deciding kind of animal he is but what to beat people up to force everybody does know is that them to come to his Rock he's well hard. He has lightning concerts, fast reflexes and and he's horns all over his the best of body. He's also got the lot at a lethal tail swish, close-up so he's a bit deadly fighting, so all round, really. keep your The only plus point distance. for his opponents It's a good is that his fighting job he's a style is a tad bit slow. predictable. SLEDGED d V DAISY AMON 60 "


"VERDICT SUPER NES Gintendo SUPER Famicom * SUPER MATERIALE We've had some good laughs with Doomsday Warrior since it came into the office, but I don't think I would be happy about paying forty quid for it. On paper it looks great plenty of options, an original \"build your character\" section and plenty of great moves. Unfortunately the game just doesn't have much character the fighters are really dull, the backdrops plain and uninteresting and the music really gets you down after a while. A good effort, but 'ultimately I don't think this one will win many fans, especially the SFIl die-hards. GET OFF! A nice feature of Doomsday Warrior is that you're able to build up your character as the game progresses. After each win you're awarded a number of \"hit blocks\" that you can use to boost your power in different areas the more energy you finish the fight with, the more hit blocks you'll win. You can increase your kicking and punching strength, enhance your defensive power or speed up your rate of energy recovery. There's also a boostable category called \"Soul Power\" this is a mysterious asset to have, as it allows you to pull off miraculous victories by going berserk and destroying your opponent when you're low on energy and about to snuff it. PROS:Lots of options, nice moves (especially the killer moves) and some original touches. CONS:The characters don't have any and it actually gets a bit depressing after a short while. GARY WHITTA Sledge punches Grimrock, Simple enough, really. DOOOIDEMOOOOO GRIMROCK SLEDGE DOIOVSDC S9IHd999 Average quality sprites and derivative backdrops don't exactly stand out from the crowd. Lots of tunes, but none of them are any good. Plus some OK FX. It's easy to get into... GAMEPLAY Feel the force of P-Lump's flying headbutt. Ow! I'VE GOT A PAPERCUT VERDICT ...and almost just as easy to get bored. Browsing at these screenshots, you may well be thinking to yourself, \"Oh crikey, this looks like the one to knock Streetfighter Il off its lofty perch. But you'd be wrong, because it turns out that Doomsday Warrior is actually rather dull. It looks the part from the stills, but get 'em animated and the battlers don't really look that impressive. And although the programmers have tried to incorporate some new ideas into the gameplay, they haven't really worked. It's cheaper than SFII, but unfortunately it shows in the quality stakes. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Of course in a fightin'n'fumpin' game like this there isn't much of what you could call strategy, but Doomsday Warrior has got a little bit. Whether you choose Normal or Easy modes, in the one-player game you get to choose your opponents in any order you like, so there's a slight tactical element there. We reckon the best thing is to take out the easier fighters first (Amon and P-Lump are a bit sad) to build up your hit power before taking on the tougher characters like Grimrock and Nuform. 10 PAUL RAND ONWAO  KR Almost identical to his pal Sledge in fighting ability and style, Layban is an ex-army sergeant who went AWOL to take up a career as a pro wrestler before being kicked out for dirty fighting (who writes this stuff Ed?). He's a fighter with an attitude and, even worse, incredible power in his legs and arms. A great slobbering Nuform is a bit of a T-1000 ripmass of a man if ever off. Made of a special liquid that there was one, when can shape itself into a variety of he's not eating the food forms, he shuffles along in a stocks of entire kind of puddle and jabs at you villages, P-Lump can with his \"arms\". The lower half often be bound using of his body can be turned into his mystic Chinese an anvil or a spike! powers to inflict GBH on innocent people. He might look like a fat girl with that pigtail, but it is in fact a deadly weapon he spins it around and smacks you in the face with it. 72 P-LUMA UNUFORM 61 "

"REVIEW by GAMETEK .99 SUPER NES OUT: On import. Thanks to Console Plus (Tel: 0532 500 445) for the review cartridge SUPER Picom Cantorado SUPER NINTENDO * * * * * * legend wedloes AMERICAN GLADIATORS The pulling power of Gladiators is legend but does the SNES version have the muscle or is it just a bit floppy? PROS: The game's only redeeming feature is the digitised pictures of lads and lasses at the beginning of the proceedings! CONS: If only we had the space! Dreadful sprites, terrible animation, crap gameplay and awful music you name it. Just sick! GRAPHICS You wouldn't believe they could be so bad on SNES. Even worse than the appalling graphics! ARRRRGHHH! t's taken TV by storm and is swelling the numbers of gym members to breaking point and now American Gladiators is available on Super Nintendo! Wrestle with the gorgeous Ice, Lace, and Zap or pick the men's competition and tough it out with Thunder, Laser and the lads! This is a conversion of the US show, remember, so don't expect to see any of the little weedy types we get on the British version. Plug in your cart, pump up your console and get ready to beat up some beefcake! Don't fancy yours much! GET IN ON THE ACTION So you wanna be a gladiator, eh? Tough luck you'll have to settle for being a competitor instead. Two modes are available; a single match-up against the computer or the full series tournament, with up to 16 human players forging towards the final. There are seven events on the cards. Run and shoot in Assault, swing and pound in Human Cannonball, rock and roll in Atlasphere, jab and thrust in Joust, push and shove with Powerball, ache and strain on The Wall and speed through the ultimate obstacle course, The Eliminator! The easiest event of the lot, but you can't knock 'em off! STAY AT HOME We have to say it early, American Gladiators is the biggest pile of crap we've seen since King Kong was half way up the Empire Sate Building and fancied a cack! The animation of the sprites looks like it was done by John Wayne (not only was he a sad cowboy, but he's dead)! The only two events worth 10p of electricity are Assault and Eliminator. Assault has a nifty option that lets you switch from an overhead view to a full-sized arena shot! Each weapon can be picked up and fired at the gladiatorial assassins before moving on to the next. Eliminator, the show's final event, starts off with the treadmill, hand cycle bars, beam, net and moves on to the death slide, hurdles and a beefy gladiator. But even this event is just a case of pressing Land R as fast as you can until you reach the finishing line. CAN GAMEDAY It's more fun looking for the little blue salt bag in a crisp packet. You won't even be able to swap this cart with your thickest mate. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT The giant Atlasphere event looks more like a game of marbles! O-NW AUOVO LLLLLLLLLLL MUTTTTT I always thought the American version of Gladiators was easily the best so I expected some real joypad pumpin' action from this, but I have to say that I'm more disappointed than a bottle of Grolsch at an AA meeting. I'm certain that this game actually does smell. The game graphics are very poor and are not saved by the digitised pictures of the Gladiators, sound really is awful and gameplay is repetitive and rapidly dulls the brain. This game has no clout whatsoever and you should whack it into the middle of next week before some poor sod decides to buy it! Honestly, get two rubber-bands, fold up some paper and flick the projectiles at inanimate objects. It's cheaper and a lot more fun! Pass the fly swatter and get the Gladiators off my ass. MISS Your STEVE KEEN Inside the arena. Pick your weapons and run like the wind! 69 "

"SUPER NES by OCEAN .99 OUT: Now. Contact Millennium (0223 844894) for information. ROBOCOD IS A REAL FAVOURITE ON OTHER FORMATS BUT HAS HE GOT THE GILLS TO MAKE IT BIG ON THE SNES? S U P E R DO SUPER GAMES2 DUA MALDONDEO CENCED CO TO GILL ow many more of these cutesy video game superheroes do we have to take? I swear, if I see one more pair of big saucer-like eyes and a broad toothy smile on a sprite I'll kill someone. Probably Anglin. Anyway, the point is that I wouldn't mind seeing a few HARD characters in games for a change, tooled up to the teeth and blowing away people left, right and centre. Still, we don't want to go upsetting those nice, sensitive people from the newspapers and TV again, so it looks as though we'll have to play with the likes of James Pond, underwater agent for a while yet. Never mind. THE STORY SO FAR Amiga and Megadrive fans will already be well familiar with James Pond, and particularly his antics as the steel-clad secret agent Robocod because it's considered a bit of a doozy in those circles. The game's gone through a bit of a name change during the process of making it onto the SNES, but apart from that this is a straight carbon copy of the game that most of us know and love. FISH Agent Pond is sent on a dangerous mission to the North Pole after Santa's Toy Shop is taken over by an evil organisation. If all the little kiddywinkies of the world are to wake up on Christmas Day with their stockings bulging with prezzies, Pond had better get his skates on and get it sorted fast! The icemen cometh. oooooo Q0061 "


"VERDICT WORK THAT BODY! SUPER NES SUPER amicom Cintendo SUPER MATERIE Robocod (as it's known on other formats) has always been revered as one of the top platform games around, and seeing as the SNES version is spot-on identical to the Megadrive, this one should climb straight to the top of the heap too, right? Well... yeah, pretty much. Although it hasn't aged that well, it's still a lot of fun, and the tunes and graphics make it a very jolly experience indeed. It might not quite be a classic (it's a little too easy for one thing), but Super James Pond is still one of the best platformers the SNES has to offer. Just like all console superheroes, Pondy can run and jump like a world-class athlete. Unfortunately, however, he doesn't have any weapons (he can jump on the baddies' heads, but that's about it). This is more than made up for, though, by his extraordinary ability to stre-e-e-e-e-tch his body upwards like a telescopic jack to grab onto platforms and swipe objects high above normal jumping distance. Once he's grabbed onto a platform or ledge, Pond can shimmy along it handy for getting over spike traps, acid baths and the like. Don't get too carried away with this impressive bodily feat, however it looks nice but doesn't come into play that often. PROS: Fast, colourful and loadsa fun. It's a real \"feelgood\" game. CONS: Seems a bit simplistic to play after a while. GARY WHITTA BONUS BONANZA GRAPHICS Very nicely defined and brightly coloured visuals make this one a treat for the eyes. The good thing about Super James Pond is that it's absolutely bursting at the seams with hidden bonuses, secret rooms and other mystery bits. Exploring the outside of Santa's grotto (from where you enter the various levels via the outer doors) can lead to all manner of secret stages revealing themselves our favourite is the bit on the top of the speeding train. And you should always be sure to bash as many blocks as you can during play you never know what extra-special goodies may be hiding behind them! ONDOS The tunes are simple, but you'll soon find yourself humming along with them. GAMEPLAY Well, it's not quite Mario, but it's faster and more fun than most others. All aboard for the train of DEATH! VALUE There are loads and loads of levels, but can you be bothered to finish them all? STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 101 More choo-choos on this level only little ones but just as lethal. LLLLLLLLLLL ONWAUO 00 VERDICT P-P-P-PICK 'EM UP If Santa had been kidnapped and his toyshop ransacked, how would you go about putting the matter to rights? Simple! Go around collecting penguins, of course! That's exactly what our Jimmy has to do to ensure Santa's safe return on each of the levels, each one set inside the toy-packed polar workshop, Pond has to seek out the lovable flightless birds and snap 'em all up in order to send the exit gate flashing and gain access to the next stage. As well as penguins, of course, there's no shortage of other goodies to collect, from sweets and cakes to telephones and clocks bash the mystery bricks to reveal the booty, but steer well clear of the bottles of poison. HIT I have to admit to preferring a good blast as opposed to the leapspriong type (yes, I don't particularly like the Mario games except for Mario Kart, of course!). Cute platformen criticism aside, James Pond has all the features of a classic game. It's easy to get into and the graphics and music are reasonably pleasant, and while it starts quite easy found it got much harder later. It's cute, it's cuddly and I personally wouldn't buy it but it's still an excellent game. GARTH SUMPTER "


"REVIEW SUPER NEST by JALECO T.00 i On import. Thanks to Console Plus (Tel: 0532 500445) for the cartridge. [NAME]-HIRD. I [ Gt 1-824 125 DELIC E TO Now what's he got in store for this scientist?

Jaleco storms top-secret hidden research laboratory, onto the SNES protected by a mountain with a fastfortress, has been invaded by aliens. action shootem The robotic mutants want to steel the Subspace up that's a Particle Transfer Project scorcher! information and, although that means absolutely nothing to us, it'll give someone a great excuse to dish out a good kickin'! Rock 'ard geezers come in all shapes and sizes, but this is a special mission for a special guy! After being duffed up beyond all recognition on his last mission, Logan was rebuilt with bioelectronic implants giving him incredible strength, reflexes and analytical abilities. This is a solo mission and Logan's the best are you? 8 WW721222223 He's big, he's blue, but he's easy! 74 "


"NAMEI-HIFO. I [ Gt 1-824 TE VERDICT If Jaleco was a bit more original, it really could be a software company to be reckoned with. Some of the touches in Operation Logic Bomb, like the holographic character used to draw fire and the timed mines that explode in huge balls of flame in whichever direction you choose, are brilliant. But the main gameplay, wandering around corridors and shooting robots, is old hat. It's still a good cart, but the next time the Jap giants think about doing a game, I hope they try and place a few more of their own excellent ideas into the makeup; then we'll really see a monster! IM-9955 = NAME-HIFOI Ha J-HEugs I HK I7a laza TF-1-A24 IPA cw ]-73 1222 [IPIT-73 1226 CG+ )-E24 125 Em ]-435025 STEVE KEEN IDAME1HIFOI RPL-R3 SSLG-R4 TSLG-R2 FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT! Secret agents are never short of a gadget and Logan's got a dozon of the choicest weapons around! You start the game with two standard blasters, but up to five can be found including unlimited supplies of ammo. Also, two extra special weapons can be collected and are essential pick-ups if you want to finish the game. Here's the Crew's favourites and what they do. You can flick between them whenever you want and interchange their uses. Now scan our files for the best around! (Reflecting Pulse Laser) Anyone who knows Gaz realises just how sneaky he is and this weapon was made for him! The orange laser bolts ricochet and bounce off any surface and you can take the most offensive aliens out from behind walls and even outside rooms and they'll never even know you were there! Hurrah! (Single Shot Laser gun) Bog standard blaster, but packs a hell of a punch. Ideal for wasting persistent, fast moving slime balls! If there's more than a couple of enemies coming at you it's best to swap to another weapon, but not only will it split a bad guys atoms it'll force them backwards as well. (Triple Shot Laser Gun) Garth's favourite! By judging your angles you can take out two mutants or more at once, just like he does with his dates! The only draw back is that the pulse is a little slow to charge, giving enemies ample time to gang up on you and rush attack! TDB-MINE FPS-R2 ATMP-R5 PID-R1 SLAN LEUEL EZEL Que (Timed Directional Blast Mine) Just drop this sucker and push in the direction that you want the blast to be forced, step back and watch the action. Not a great deal of timing is needed as the blast radius is pretty large. Just like Jon's! Only use the mines in tactical situations when you have a lot of time. (Ferro-Plasma Spray) This is the boy to have in your arsenal! One of the most powerful weapons around and Rand's favourite rifle. Burn, melt and blast the toughest of enemies with pinpoint accuracy. If you stand right you can even get the flames to gel around objects to hit hidden targets. (Automatic Tracking Missile Pod) This is the ultimate in firepower and because it homes straight in on its victims with no work required by the player it's Anglin's favourite! And why not? You don't get many of these rockets to every shot, but there's just enough to waste those BIG mumas! (Personal Image Duplicator) Just like the gizmo from Total Recall. This baby projects a hologram of the player and draws enemy fire whilst you do the dirty. This is Steve's favourite and it's excellent ideas and gadgets like these that make Op. Logic Bomb such a success! NO CASE 75 "


"HIFC SAD FOLK START HERE SUPER NES GIT and com OPERATION: LOGIC BOMB TWO PEAS IN A POD Get off your fat ass and get those digits into gear! You can't be serious! This is the easiest section in the whole cart. If you're looking for help already, write in to sad Anglin and he can put your pathetic pleas straight into the bin where they belong! KIADO > NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER GARTH PROS: Fabulous effects and lotsa action. Original ideas in the weapons department. CONS: No difficulty settings and no customisation of the joypad possible. Aliens tend, to hang off the edges of the screen waiting to be shot. Operation Logic Bomb follows hard on Tuff E Nuff's heels and continues Jaleco's policy of taking original game formulas and adding new twists. The gameplay's a cross between Alien Breed and Warzone on the Amiga, but owes most of its inspiration to Super Smash TV. With levels and sub-levels a-plenty, Logan must scuttle through countless laboratory corridors, forest terrain and subspace, destroying the invaders. They can leap up at any moment from the blue octagons in the floor to roast your hide! All the aliens follow their own attack pattem and are colour coded for speed and lethality! More deadly than those, though, are the robotic gun emplacements that shoot up from the passageways and the various homing blobs of slime that keep on coming! The bad guys make a dramatic entrance, but they can be shot in the head. Right, you're starting to make some headway. Without giving away the whole solution here's what you should be doing about now. Go back to the teleportation hole and pick up the flame thrower in the previous room. Now go back and use it on the controls, left and right, to open the door. AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! DETERLIBA PAUL GRAPHICS Tops for presentation. Actual sprite graphics left wanting. Yeah, now you're right up there rockin' and kickin' butt wiv da Crew! This is the first big boss that gives any respectable gamer any trouble. Take out his gun claws first and stand as close to his mouth as possible without touching it. Now blast with the flame thrower. Nothing special, but you can get your ears into it! R NOS OLEO NE5949 0006. TERBAG Easy to finish but fun to play. GAMEPLAY SCAN MODE =1 11=UNKNOWN 02=UNKNOWN 03: UNKNOW Average. There are better shoot 'em ups. DIMENSION STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 3 These are the pods that generate the countryside on level 5. Got any flame throwers? Sorted! LLLLLLLLLLLL ONWAUW VERDICT | || | IK HIT Mr Keen's being a little harsh here. So, Operation Logic Bomb's not totally original, but what game is these days? What you've got to remember is that Jaleco has taken a popular playing style and enhanced the gameplay to great effect! Operation Logic Bomb is packed with features and, even though experienced gamers will find it a little easy after time, you'll still want to go back to it 'cos it's so much fun. The only real shame is that the graphics are a touch on the bland side, but generally there's little wrong with Operation Logic Bomb; give it a blast! TRANSFER YOUR ASSETS! With all that's going on inside the complex it's easy to miss things, but you'll get ample time to correct your mistakes. The Particle Transfer Unit which the boffins were working on is still active in the form of scores of teleportation points scattered around the labs and grounds. Often you'll get stuck and have to 'beam' all over the place to pick up a piece of missed equipment or activate an electric switch to open a door blocking your path elsewhere. 85 PAUL RAND 76 "

"-REVIEW by ACCOLADE .99 OUT: Now. Contact Accolade (081877 0880) for information. by ACCOLADE MEGADRIVE SUMMER CHALLENGE PROS: A high number of human and computer players than can compete. USUG Miram CONS: Bad graphics, ropey music and boring gameplay. AURICUR ndarior a Bayer There are three ways to tell when summer's here. The first is that it pours with rain just when you think the weather's getting better, the second's that you can't walk into a London McDonald's without shoe-horning through blocks of multi-coloured teenage tourists camping outside and the third is the annual deluge of athletics games that arrive at CVG Towers! Summer Challenge is the first this year, but you can expect a lot more! Whether or not they'll manage to overcome the button-bashing tactics of every track and field sports sim in the history of gaming is doubtful, but we live in hope! Here's the Olympic stadium. Big, innit! SMEETITOR 372 All guys together, but where are the gals? Pixellated and rough, some nice polygons, but mostly sub standard. FACE UP TO THE CHALLENGE The phrase 'not much cop' comes to mind when recalling the quality of past sports sims. They seem to range from the completely unplayable to the adequately enjoyable. Summer Challenge lies somewhere between the two. There are nine events in the tournament and, thankfully, the option to practise whichever one you want as many times as you want without piling through scores of menus. But it's in the competitive mode that the big boys hang out. You can have up to nine human competitors who can be customised with your own name and nationality. There's even a library of faces for you to scroll through for your competitor! How's that for grouping, boyee?! Average sound effects, terrible music. The anthems are stinky! Nice to compete against friends, but only a few events are enjoyable. Train Tournament Options Going, going.. Gone! There's better around and certainly better to come. OS LEO STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES ARCHERY Ucu Time: 3:08 CYCLING vrnent Record 100 soore 56 Time: 008 10ansat Record 1 20.00 speed 16.27 VERDICT ONWAO TIM TTTTTTT Anyone remember Winter Challenge? Yeah, right! We're still trying to forget it! Accolade's Summer version is slightly improved, but not much. What really makes the game so cack is the graphics mode, a mix of dodgy polygons and normal sprites. The events that stick to a single mode are by far the most playable, but the ones that really go overboard are completely unplayable at first. So what if you do manage to learn by trial and error? You'll be completely bored out of your skull by then anyway. I only got any, fun out of Javelin. Archery, Cycling and Equestrian and that was because I kept being hurled off the horse! Summer Challenge is not recommended! OO secondo con su 20.52 TIME GENTLEMEN PLEASE! Although there are a ton of events, they all use more or less the same control systems a combination of pounding one of the buttons and moving the pad. This may sound easy and such sports as Javelin, Archery and Kayaking (slalom cannoning) are a doddle, but things get as tough as cement chewing gum with High Jump, Pole Vault and the nigh-on impossible Equestrian! The controls are still pretty basic, but the poor graphics on most of the events make it extremely hard to judge distances and time manoeuvres with any accuracy. Of course practice makes perfect, but how long most people will persevere is anybody's guess. MISS STEVE KEEN "

"-REVIEW by KRISALIS by KRISALIS .99 AMIGA OUT: Now. Contact Krisalis (0709 372290) for information. Prince of Persia goes cutesy in ... PROS: Well presented with oodles of options and excellent controls. CONS: Disk access sometimes gets a bit laborious. 2835 GRAPHICS Nothing much to shout about here, but everything is clearly defined and there's a pretty intro animation. lell me if this rings any bells. A young Arabian peasant is in love with a beautiful Princess. Unfortunately, so is the evil Grand Vizier, and so as part of his dastardly plan to rule the kingdom, he casts a spell that spirits the Princess away and chucks the heroic young peasant in prison. Can he lift the spell and rescue the Princess before time runs out? Yep, sounds uncannily similar to Prince of Persia, doesn't it? In fact the game's got more than just a farfetched scenario in common with that old classic, both games being action-packed arcade adventures with more than a hint of platforms. As Sinbad Jnr, you've got to escape from the palace dungeons (easier than making a break from a Group 4 van), take on the evil Vizier's four magic guardians and bring the Princess back home to the palace in time for supper. No sweat? You're kidding! This is where you're locked up at the start but escaping's a doddle. IF YOU'RE SAT AROUND AT HOME There are plenty of text clues and messages in Arabian Nights, so keep your eyes peeled. A lightbulb appears above Sinbad Jnr's head whenever there's a clue or useful object in the vicinity, while many of the game's friendly characters are Woo-o0o-ooh! It's the gloomy forest! happy to talk and trade with you. 18010 Collect as many gems as you can, as they act as trading currency. Most of the game's puzzles revolve around getting an object from somebody to use elsewhere and though they seem pretty simple, there are quite a few genuine brainteasers lurking around. SOUND A jolly selection of arabian-style tunes or, if you prefer, sound effects. All aboard that's going aboard. MUSTAFA NOTHERGO Starting from his lowly dungeon cell with nothing but his gardener's rags, Sinbad Jnr is soon able to tool himself up with some useful gear by examining the convenient treasure chests that are littered about the place. Soon he has a key to open the dungeon doors and a sword with which to battle the burly guards. These may start you off, but they won't get you far, so search every chest you find for extra keys, more powerful swords and those all-important energy refills. It looks easy at first, but trust us this is as tough a game as you'll find anywhere. Laff-aminute antics. Something fishy on the underwater swimming stage. 32580 It's an above average game for a below average price. You'll get weeks of fun out of this baby. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES DINU 10VERDICT Give me those diamonds. They're MINE! Ha ha ha! (Clear your desk Ed) HO 2 7405 NONWAGOO LIMIT LILLED 1111111 I came into Arabian Nights with no great amount of enthusiasm, thinking \"Oh dear, we'll have seen all this before\" but by the time I'd finished playing, I'd decided that it's actually quite a top little game. The original prediction about having seen it all before is true this is a typical \"collect and search\" arcade adventure of a style that dates back to the mid 80s but perhaps that's why it's so much fun. It's simple, unpretentious and bags of fun to play. It's no pushover either, even though the cutesy style and easy first level might make you think otherwise. Don't be put off by the average graphics or the fact it's not a big-name game Arabian Nights is some of the best fun you'll have with your Amiga all year. HIT The ice level no platform game's complete without one. 20 ) 9355 DE VON ET GARY WHITTA "

It works in more or less the same way as most tennis games. The court is viewed from one end, and players change ends every two games. One unusual aspect about the viewpoint is that the near end of the court is about two-and-a-half screens wide, and the screen scrolls to follow the ball. The only problem here is that in scrolling after the ball, your player can get left off-screen. But that just adds to the action. There are plenty of options in the game to keep you entertained. Firstly, you can select between three different court surfaces hard, grass and clay, all of which affect the speed and bounce of the ball. Then you can choose whether to play left or right handed, play a single match or as part of a tournament and finally choose your opponent from a list of fifteen ranging from a 22 seed to a 502 seed. Then it's off into the match itself, and you'll be pleased to learn that it's one of the most playable ever.

First of all, it was invented by a guy who didn't know how to play football properly. Secondly, most people don't have a clue about the rules. As far as I can make out, a large bunch of men who don't wash their knees huddle together in the middle of a muddy field, and then chase each other from end to end carrying a large lemon, and then all dash off to the shower for a good hot rub down. Imagineer's game, while not featuring the rub down, has everything else you want. Full seasons and tournaments, as many human players as you can fit in your bedroom and the option to completely redesign your kit to fit this summer's fashion. The Amiga version played from a top-down view a system that worked well. You had the option of playing with a forced perspective view, but it always hindered the playability for me. On SNES, though, the whole thing is played out in Mode 7. As a Rugby game it works fine, but the colours used in the pitch are terrible.

GRAPHICS ONNOS Arsenal Squad Tras Staf Leag Fixt RCCS Info RSTV AMWA SIDORES STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES DONE DEFS MIDS ATTS IAN SELLEY STA BUY ADD EST The first time I ever saw this game, it was very slow indeed. The reason being that it was originally written in BASIC over a period of seven years not seven man years, but seven long years. By the time Domark had taken its original and paid Inteltek to recode it in machine language, there were a lot of managerial titles on the market, leaving very little room for improvement. The basic stumbling block is that, although there are so many things a manager can do arrange training, buy and sell players, juggle the books, arrange matches and so on, most management games have covered all the aspects, so any new title is going to be very hard pressed to come up with something fresh. This game has nothing new whatsoever, but AVATU what it does have are statistics. Lots of them, from the age and ability of the player right down to the size of their feet and the age of their underpants. At first glance, it looks dull. The only visuals are the the digitised backdrops, and the extensive use of boxed menus isn't exactly thrilling on the eyes. But the secret to this game isn't in the looks, it's in the strategies, and with so many option to play with, you can bet there are loads of strategies to toy with. The nice thing about this game is that your choices affect the outcome in a realistic way, giving you far more control than most games of this type. In short, this is a very addictive managerial game, and I have little doubt that fans of the genre will die for it. ONWAUOVO IIIIIIIIII THIS SEASON 85 Top: Your squad.

"Here at CVG, we've been playing Starwing for ages and have managed to come up with this huge player's guide for it. It's so big we've had to split into two parts. So, if you want to know how to beat Andross and his cronies, get reading... STARWING THE Complete guide. PART 1 FOX MCCLOUD SLIPPY Iveryone's been well and truly bowled over by the excellence that is Starwing, and why not? After lall, the Super FX chip is the most important advancement in SNES games since the joypad. But what good's a great game if you've got all the flight skills of an Emu? Not to worry, because once again CVG has obliged. We decided to send Paul Anglin into the stars in the hope that some other-world life form might make more sense of him than we can, and he ended up coming back with the most definitive guide to Starwing you ever did see. Fox is the leader of the team, he has nerves of steel and never gets hasty with his trigger finger. He wants to see the entire Venom Empire wiped out and will not stop before he does so. Peppy is the oldest of the bunch (a bit like Garth really), but the advantage of his years is that he has a lot more combat experience then any of the other flyboys. Slippy, your wing-man seems to have 'shoot me' painted on the outside of his ship! You're forever having to rescue him; mind you, he backs you up pretty well. Falco: Falco is a bit of an enigma. His superb skills are matched only by those of his team leader. There's no pleasing Falco; take out a bogey on his tail and he'll whinge.

"A LITTLE HELP TO GET YOU STARTED DEATH DEALIN' DEVICES OF DOOM Before we get into the main guide we thought we'd just give you the benefit of all our misspent evenings playing Starwing and give you a helpful little hint to get you started: You'll need some state of the art weaponry to take on the Venom Empire; here are all the different ways to equip your fighter: GARTH: When you're playing Starwing, don't forget to grip the Super Nintendo joypad firmly and have your fingers poised over the various buttons, so you can depress the required buttons when necessary. SINGLE LASERS This is the weapon that comes as standard with your Starwing fighter, and...it's not really very good! It'll do until you get a power-up, but it doesn't have much of a range. RAND: Starwing? Eh? Well, errm...it's umm...great innit? Who's round is it, anyway? GARY: If you're in trouble, don't hesitate to use your Nova Bombs. There are always plenty of spares lying around for you to top up your arsenal. STEVE: It's a lot easier to fly a lot of the levels using the viewpoint from inside the cockpit, but don't try and take on the end-of-level baddies like this, 'cos you don't get a good enough view of the proceedings. PAUL: If you're not very good and keep getting hit, try this simple cheat: to avoid enemy fire, roll your fighter over by pressing the Ror L button twice, and the lasers will just bounce off your ship; good, eh? TWIN BLASTER Hurrah! The Twin Blasters have a much longer range than the standard laser, and they're a damn sight more powerful to boot. But you've got to find them first. FIREBALLS Now THIS is how to kick Andross' ass. Very powerful, very accurate, very long range, very hard to find -gumph! STAGE CORNERIA JON: A tip for Starwing eh? Well, if you glue a crayon to each corner of the cart it makes a nice little food table for your pet Chinchilla. JULIE: Give me a break, I've only just got here, do you really think I've had time enough to play this Starbox, or whatever it's called? ONE MANS LOSS IS ANOTHER'S GAIN HIELD There aren't many pick-ups available in Starwing, but here they are anyway. Here we go this is the second half of this first stage. Don't forget; an extra bomb can be found to the right of the buildings. BLASTER This will power up your fighter's gun. See box on weapons for more info. EXTRA LIFE This will allow you to crash your craft just once more. EXTRA WING If you're not very good, you might find that you end up losing a wing; pick this up for a new one. Now you've got double shots. Take out the walker from a distance. To pick up the goodies you'll have to fly between two towers! SHIELD This will protect your ship from all hits for about twenty seconds. NOVA BOMB This will add one mega-hard Nova bomb to your collection These are incredibly handy so keep an eye out for them. Avoid the huge robots they tend to drop stuff on your head! Here comes the first momma! Position yourself low in the centre. USELESS BUT INTERESTING CHEAT This guide is full of really useful hints and tips, so here's a completely useless CONTOU one: When you reach the continue screen and you see your craft revolving on the screen, plug in controller two and press Y and B to change your ship into any sprite featured in the game.

"SHIELD YEAH LET'S GOR Now you've got some backup there's no excuse for running! SHIELDAn extra pick-up, how splendid! All you've got to do is get it! Negotiating the asteroid belt is easier than it looks! orange asteroids. The next big things that you have to take out are the hourglass ships these appear four at a time. If you shoot the entire group, a yellow ring will appear. You will then fly into a thicker belt of asteroids. The next baddy you see will be a hopper from the first level. If you're careful, you can fly right underneath him and grab the Nova Bomb without getting hit. Next will be the asteroid serpents; these are easily dispatched with just one shot. Next are the spinning chains of asteroids and the entrance to the secret level (see fax box on secret levels for more info). After the spinning columns of asteroids, you will be facing spinning balls that literally spit fireballs at you; the earlier you shoot these the better 'cos they are a right pain. The next thing to watch out for is the area full of orange fireball launchers. This can be a bit tricky. Next you will see the ship that is formed solely of three triangles these are really annoying so you're best advised to take them out straight away; they need three direct hits before they die. SHIELD Don't let the big boys get too close to you. You shouldn't even get damp when taking on this boy! Keep to the right and blast the cargo bay, then move left and take out the illuminated triangles on the blocks. It's dead easy, so what are you doing?! STAGE 2 ASTEROID BELT ROCK CRUSHER One side down, one to go! Watch out for the final ram! MAP SECTORY VENOM . BLACK HOLE SPACE RAMEDR The Rock Crusher is another pretty simple end-level guardian. The weak spots on the Rock Crusher are the four pods which look like lights. When the guard comes off these let rip with your cannon. When you have destroyed all the pods the main body of the ship will break off and fly towards you, to avoid it just fly to one side. You will notice that there is one pod in the centre of the ship; concentrate all your fire on this and it will blow in no time. TITANIR B SECTORX ASTEROID  TORTUFIN FAccTH SECTOR Z The yellow arrow marks one of the weak spots ... CORNERIA ASTEROID SCORE ENEMY E LEVELI The main menu. It's time to choose the path you want to follow in the game. Some are easier than others at the beginning, but they work out about even in the end. Spot the spaces for secret levels! The first thing that you come across in this level are three ships attacking from the right hand side. Next are the spinning top ships that come at you from the bottom of the screen; these are guiding the space caterpillar that comes in from the bottom left. To disperse the caterpillar you have to shoot its head and the rest of its body will fly all over the screen. Now it's into the asteroid field remember that you can only destroy the Space, the final frontier! Well, it's not actually! The Rock Crusher on its last legs; hit it where shown and its goodnight Vienna! "


"SSH, IT'S A SECRET SPACE ARMADA Okay, so everybody knows Starwing features some pretty amazing secret levels, but how many? Where are they? How do you get there? And who exactly bought that crap Bluebells song that got to number one? BLACK HOLE This is by far the simpler of the two to find. The black hole is located on the Asteroid belt stage of level 1. You will notice that there are columns of spinning rocks that fly towards you. OUT OF THIS DIMENSION This is the closest Mr McCloud will ever get to going to Vegas. To get there you have to make it to the Asteroids level on Difficulty level 3. The first thing you'll come across is a rather large cross-shaped craft if you destroy this it will release a blaster power-up. Then three homing ships will appear. Don't worry about these guys, they're real pussies and will fall easily. The next thing you see will be the armada itself! You can take out the main ships by blasting away at the central tower. Soon you will see three spikes hanging in mid-air. Shoot one of them to make them rotate, then shoot each one individually and a ship will appear in the centre shoot this for an extra life. Just before you get to the freighter a group of ships will fire what appear to be glowing Polo mints at you! These are actually very dangerous and need to be shot very quickly. When you approach the freighter, make sure you do not stray from your course otherwise the attack will be aborted and you'll have to go round again. FREIGHTER 1 Inside the freighter is very much like the trench in the Death Star. First of all there will be a ground beam, then a high one. Then there's a doorway for which you must tilt sideways to avoid. Next you must stay low to pass under Keep shooting this tower to the archway that pops up and blow up the freighter. grab the shield after it. Pass under the next arch and and shoot the grey and yellow portal to enter the final section. As soon as you see the core hit your brakes and keep firing at the centre of it to blow it up. If you don't think you're going to make it simply use a Nova Bomb. Then hit your retros and fly out just as it blows. Just like Ooh 'eck, this could be trouble! in Return Of The Jedi. Wait till they get really close and then blast them! Do this with all three sets and... Blast the asteroid and the egg will appear. Shoot the egg and the bird will appear. this will appear. Crash into it and ... SHIELD Fly into the head of said bird. SHIELC Shoot the doors to open them. Shoot the arm of the onearmed bandit to play! SHIELC ... this will happen! Blimey! All of the asteroids will be grey except the middle one this will be orange. Shoot the orange asteroid and the column will break up, then do the same to the next column. When the third column comes along don't shoot it and you will see an asteroid with a smiling face. Crash into this and you'll be in the black hole. Inside the black hole are all sorts of things: wrecked ships, loads of bonuses and, legend has it, this is where your father was last seen. You will notice that there are loads of scaffolds and secret doors that you can fly through in the black hole. All of these conceal goodies galore, so use as many as you can. When you're ready to exit the level, you will find that you will come out at Sectory on difficulty level 2 handy, eh? FREIGHTER 2 The first problem you will have to deal with is a door with two arrows on it. The arrows show you which way the door will open. Next are a series of high and low beams, and then a yellow and black beam which moves up and down you'll have to use your brakes to get under this one. After this there'll be a Nova Bomb pickup. Then there are a series of doors which you must shoot to open and then it's onto a corridor full of hoppers FREIGHTER 3 The first thing you'll see is a door with a moving arrow on it. Shoot the doors to open them and avoid the electrified beams in the tunnel. Be careful the doors open in the direction which the arrows on them point when you shoot them. Then it's onto the corridors full of baddies most of these release loads of goodies so blast them. Then there's a load of sideways opening doors, and after that you will find that your ship will automatically fly to the end of the corridor and onto the Atomic Core. You will see two indestructible asteroids come on the screen, one after another. Ignore the first one, but pump all the plasma you've got into the second. Eventually a huge Eagle will appear and you have to fly straight into its head. Don't hang around after the bird appears because it can move very fast. Once inside the secret level, shoot the paper planes until you reach the one-armed bandit. To play the machine, shoot the handle. If you get three sevens, you'll finish the stage and you even get to see the end of game sequences. The same with this door, but watch which way those orange arrows are pointing. SHIELD No, no, don't go in there! There's baddies in there! Nooo! "


"ATOMIC CORE As you enter the Atomic Base you will see rotating pods in the air. After a few seconds they will become electrified. You will have to take these out first. One is situated on the floor so be ready to avoid it. Now and then the direction of the core will change so get ready for that. Once you have taken out the guard drones the core will be exposed. Blast away at the core whilst dodging its fireballs and victory will be yours. energy power-up, then fly onto the next building and shoot the red door to enter it. This will give you a full energy refill. Your next problem comes in the form of a kind of flat battle tank. To take these out you will have to hit your brakes and shoot them. You have to kill these 'cos they really don't give up. Before you see the next one of these you will spot two red hangers — shoot the first one of these to release a Nova Bomb, then it's onto Mr Insector! ENEMY C Blow away all Insector's legs and then concentrate on the main body. SHIELD DANCING INSECTOR This bloke is a bit of a git! First of all you have to blow off all its legs one by one. Just keep blasting at its legs as it runs all over the ground. Nova Bombs come in very handy here. Occasionally it will spin on the floor; when it does, beware because it will rise up and its flailing arms can often catch you, and they do real damage. When he starts to use his fire weapon, don't worry too much, it looks a lot worse than it is. It moves pretty slowly so just watch carefully and move out of the way. When you have destroyed all Insector's legs, the main part of the ship will just fly around the screen blast away at this. And before you know it, it's dead! Shoot the satellites and then blast the core. STAGE METEOR STAGE 3 ABOVE VENOM Shoot these scout droids in the legs to topple 'em. There's the Blaster power up the Nova bomb appears two towers before it to the left. Ooh, a toughie. The most important thing to remember is to watch out for the homing missiles that are fired from the ground. There's very little real advice I can give you for this level, everything moves so fast that you've just got to shoot 'em as soon as you see 'em. One thing worth mentioning is that at the beginning of the level there is a ring of triangular rocks; don't shoot any of them, fly through the middle and you will get two Nova Bombs. HIELD Fly through the ring for two Nova bombs. Destroy all those ground tanks and collect a yellow power ring. PHANTRON Now things get a bit tricky. The first thing you'll see are two huge scout droids that will come up from behind you; although they're pretty large they only take a couple of hits to destroy. Next you'll have to shoot the big battle tanks these fire off loads of firebombs so it's wise to take them out fast. Then it's maze time. There is a huge maze of pillars and in there somewhere is a Nova Bomb and a blaster power-up (see pics for the exact location). You can just fly over the top of all the towers if you like, but that's a bit of a cop-out. Straight after the towers you will enter a corridor of rocks; stay low and to the right so you can take out the scout droid that appears. When you come out of this passageway, it's open house. There are battle tanks and scout droids everywhere, so have your trigger finger poised. Continue on until you reach the building on your left with four tanks emerging from it, one of your team will have joined you to help you take these out. Shoot the last tank for an Now this guy is punishment. If he hits you with one of his ships that he fires off, it's instant death! First of all the Phantron will move left then right while firing missiles. Keep shooting the side of his ship as this is his weak spot. Shoot the missiles as soon as he fire them. Shoot the head and it will split in three. Then just shoot all of them and it's over, boyeee! HIELD Shoot the Phantron in the side and then blast at the three heads. "


"STAGE 6 VENOM SURFACE STAGE 7 ANDROSS APPROACH The first things you'll face on the planet surface are pylons moving in from the left. These are pretty simple to fly between. After this you will find the first rectangular gate that pivots in the direction of the arrow either fly to the opposite side of the arrow or shoot it to change the direction. Then you will have to fly through a group of steel girder-type shapes, this is extremely hard and it's easier to fly underneath them. After this, you'll be up against some bird ships, these are pretty easy so don't worry too much. Then you've got more of those horrible pivoting blocks. If you pass the second one on the right hand side you'll gain an extra Nova Bomb. Next there's even more pylons sliding in from both sides of the screen. Luckily SHIELD Shoot the eyes until the face crumbles. This one's pretty similar to the Armada level. As you're flying through the tunnels you will notice that the beams that are fired always follow the same pattern, so once you've learned the pattern they're easy to dodge. The grey blocks at the side turn into sliding walls. When these move there's only enough room for you to get past by flying on your side. So whichever wall the block is on, get to the opposite wall fast! When you reach the end of the tunnel you will be automatically transported to Andross himself. SHIELD Shoot this block to change the direction of the arrow and thus the direction which the block moves in. though, if you stay at ground level none of them will hit you. Then there's a quiet spell where it's just bird ships and the odd ground emplacement, then there's some red pylons. These will actually somersault over you to land in your path! If you fly sideways (using the R or L buttons) you'll be able to make it through. Stay in the sideways position to manoeuvre through the poles that fall from above. Then enter the box minefield. These will fall on your ship as you pass underneath them so it's best to just stay high. If you want to collect the Nova Bomb and blaster power-ups you'll have to drop down at the last minute for them and use your retros to escape. Then there's another pivot block and a few more of those damned pylons, but then, it's the Phantron for the second time. SHIELD 30 ANDROSS ERJEHY The first things to attack are the eyes. The bits of rock that fly towards you can be shot. After a few seconds the eyes will close and Andross will open his mouth and try to suck you in. Pull back and right on the pad to avoid this. When Andross spits out all the debris, get ready to move. Then it's back to those eyes. Eventually both eyes will blow up and the face will crack and Andross will be revealed. You HAVE to be quick on the next bit. If you don't destroy the cube quickly it will change back to the face and you'll have to start again, so just fire everything you've got at him, this is why you have to do the face without using any Nova Bombs. When he's dead, hurrah! You've completed level 1! SHIELD 3035 VENOM SUPER-PHANTRON Keep shooting the head until it splits in three. Waste the middle head to kill the first version. When it transforms into the walker, shoot the weak spot in the centre of its head. It will launch fireballs and missiles at you so watch out. Be careful with your Nova Bombs 'cos it avoids them very well. It also creates a mirage of itself so only attack the one that fires at you. His last method of attack is to try and jump on your ship! To avoid it, hit the brakes and turn away. Just before he buys it, the Phantron will throw body segments at you, so watch yourself. If you thought that was tough, come back next month and we'll show you how to crack levels 2 and 3 as only CVG can. Miss it, and everyone will laugh at your Starwing sadness. See ya! "


"CHEAT ) = MEGA CD SOLFEACE TIME GAL Hurrah for overseas CVG cheats! One of the latest Mega-CD games has been completely and totally cracked by none other than jolly Hollander Arm Pimmerman from the Netherlands (I think that's what it says but unfortunately I can't read his handwriting).

So all the boys on the team have been talking about girls, girls, girls! Actually, Steve Keen says very little about the ladies, probably not wanting to give any hot tips away. Meanwhile, Rand and Whitta do nothing but babble about babes and as for Garth, he always says that he's far too old for all that frightfully messy shenanigans' the sad thing being that everyone actually believes him. As for me, I have to spend all of my spare time opening sackfuls of Cheat Mode letters so I won't get a snog this summer. But that doesn't bother me, I just want to receive all your stuff which should be sent to: IF THE ENGLAND SQUAD CAN PLAY FOR ENGLAND SO CAN I CHEAT MODE, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU.

On the GAME START screen push the joypad in the following directions; UP, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP. If you get it right you'll hear a noise and then when you start the game you can choose your level by pressing left and right on the pad. There's also a cheat which will allow you to enter the training mode. When you get killed, press UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and you should hear an explosion.

"Hotter the the next generation of MEGA-CD | ith Sega and Nintendo already pushing the capabilities of cartridges to the limit, it's time for a new breed of machine to take over. CD technology is the next step up the evolutionary ladder of software. Here are the machines that give it to you. Sega's hype machine rolled into action in April with a series of 120 second ads promoting the launch of their new wonder machine. You simply slot your Megadrive into the top, plug in and you're away. The biggest quibble people have about the Mega-CD is its price, . This autumn will see the release of the Megadrive2 and MegaCD 2, which are cut down version of the original machines with the only difference being the cases. Together these should cost around , which is far more bearable. The software retails at around the - mark, which is similar to the price of cartridges. The justification for this is that the games cost a lot more to develop, so although it costs less to duplicate a CD, new games aren't going to be any cheaper. WELCOME TO COMPACT DREAMS A Also planned are memory cartridge MEGA-CD BOASTS Apart from giving you access to the wor own set of hardware chips. A new graphics processor allows SNES-type A PCM sound chip which is based on technology used in Sega coin-ops, sound. Increased processing speed thanks to a second CPU Built-in Just what does CD mean to you? If you think that CD is ideal for putting some Kylie squeaks and mutterings on then you should quietly tear these 16 pages out of CVG now and use them to build yourself a lunatic asylum. If, as I suspect, you knew all along that the power of CD is about to be unleashed, giving us the next generation of arcade quality console games, then this is just the read for you. RE CD. We've all heard of Sega's brilliant Mega CD but that's only the tip of the iceberg! And this guide will slowly melt your brains as you read through it and discover just what's going to be happening in the near future: CD will take over as the only format worth having if you're serious about your games! These come in the form of a stand alone drive which hooks up to your PC. Until recently the software has been limited to business and educational packages, although the release of the 7th Guest could herald a new generation in games software. CD-Rom drives come in two PC CD-ROM Pretty it ain't. types, internal and external. The internal type are significantly cheaper, but you need to have a slot in your machine to fit them in to. They also run at different speeds, with the top of the range fast drives costing more than the older, slower models. So prepare to find out just how hot CD is as we tell you what CD technology can do, what the best games are, what machines are currently available and what new machines you can expect to see in the shops over the coming months. PCs are easy to upgrade, so the system doesn't go out of date. Games use SVGA, which means 256 colours on screen at once. There are many different drives available ranging from cheap, but sluggish, to expensive and superfast. 98 "


"an July CD-I is still waiting to catch on. samins is her THE PACK Philips' entry into the CD market has taken a while to get moving, but it's set to take off like a rocket later in the year. Many new games are planned plus the MPEG-standard video cartridge, which'll give you high quality movie entertainment on a standard sized compact disc (see page 101). Cost is a major factor with this machine, as it retails for around , although you can now hire them from Radio Rentals.. There's no sign of a price reduction yet, so we'll just have to sit back, see what happens and hope. When you pick up your Mega-CD you're all ready to go with their free starter pack of discs. Included is Cobra Command, an all-action helicopter blast with cartoon graphics and Sol Feace, the first ever Mega-CD shoot 'em up. Also included is the Arcade Classics disc, a compilation CD containing Streets Of Rage, Golden Axe, Columns and many other all-time Megadrive favourites. Easy-to-use controller for kids. Good range of educational and reference software. Forthcoming Full Motion Video (FMV) video cartridge for better than VHS quality film. DANGER 10 THE FUTURE OF CDhich will allow you to save loads of data. .09 of CD technology, the Mega-CD also has its fects such as sprite scaling and rotation. technically it can produce arcade quality ery for saved games. CD-I caused a minor stir when it was launched, but its comparatively high price and small software base have so far condemned it to only a few homes. Philips are now putting more money that ever into software and development, and with the launch of the FMV cartridge we could be seeing some red hot CD-I games towards the end of this year. 171900 020000 Cobra Command comes free with the Mega-CD WHAT'S BEST? THE PACK Panasonic Most drives come on their own, with just the software to make your PC talk to them. But, costing , a pack is now available when a drive comes with a Soundblaster card. Without this, or a similar card, you can't access the CDs' sound features, so at this price the pack looks like a winner. Before you by a PC CD-ROM drive, you must have an adequate PC set-up. This means you'll need a SVGA card, monitor, 2Mb Ram, Hard Drive and a 486 processor. Anything less and the games may not run properly, or at all for that matter. CDI Compact Disc Interactive, to give it its full title, is a stand-alone machine which accepts only CDI software. It has arguably the best graphics of the current machines, although software is very limited at the moment. MEGA-CD Technically the weakest, although it stands head and shoulders above most normal machines. The games are getting better every month and with the release of the Mega-CD 2 in September we can expect to see a lot more software. PC CD-ROM While an excellent system, you really need at least  worth of 486 PC to hook it up to. The results are amazing, although games software is still in its infancy. There are plenty of reference CDs available, but these are usually dead boring things such as the Guinness Book Of Records. 3DO What's all the fuss about then? The mystery machine at the moment is the 3DO. With a list of developers including Nintendo, Sega, Electronic Arts and director Steven Spielberg all working on it, we could be in for something special. Details are scarce but what we do know is that it is 32bit, has millions of colours and there are loads of incredible add-ons such as 3D virtual reality-type glasses. Tune in next issue for the low down on the 3DO from ace news hound Gary Whitta in his special CES show report! STOP PRESS CDL ON ITS WAY! With speculation already mounting on what Sega's follow-up to the Megadrive will be, the Japanese side of the company has taken the world by surprise with the launch of a completely new console the CDL. Using similar technology to coin-ops such as Mad Dog Mcree and Dragon's Lair, the CDL has the best graphics and sound of any home machine. The laser disc format of the games means you get moviequality film action and digital sound. This is the first such attempt at a Laser Disc console and initial reaction in Japan seems favourable. But it could be some time before we see it here. 99 "


"COMING SOON ONE MEGA-CD. Now that the Mega-CD is finally with us, we want to know all of the details of what to play on it. Here's a run down of the biggest name games on their way this summer. ECCO THE DOLPHIN INXS MAKE MY VIDEO ALSO ON THEIR WAY...  Dracula: the game of the Ecco's back in action on CD. The game's due for an august release. As far as we know there haven't been any production hitches, so it's looking good A Your host for the game offers technical production advice as well as handy, artistic tips. ased around the Sega smash hit, Ecco CD will retain much of the style and gameplay of the original. On this version, though, you'll be treated to even better graphics, incredible sound and loads more levels. If Sega can do the business with this it looks as though we could be witnessing at one of the CD sensations of 1993. ased on a similar format to Kriss Kross Make My Video, this game stars Australian rockers INXS with you directing their videos. The game is hosted by a fast-talking video jocky and the videos can be composed from the many lengthy clips and soundtracks the game is supplied with. Kriss Kross went down very well, and looks like this will have the same reaction from INXS fans. BATMAN RETURNS TIME GAL film is winging its way from Psygnosis later in the year. It will feature digitised characters from the movie.  Silpheed is an absolutely awesome looking vector shoot 'em up. Again, later this year from Sega. Marky Mark Make My Video is another in the Kriss Kross/INXS mould. Could arrive this summer. Hook, the game of the film by Sony, promises digitised scenes from the film amongst other things. 475.00 A Using sprite scaling with knobs on, the driving section of Batman Returns looks really neat. All things being well this game should hit the shelves in August. Guide Time Gal through a series of zones avoiding cavemen, gladiators and world war two fighter planes. he caped crusaders first outing on CD looks likely to blow the pants of his two previous cartridge adventures. Instead of merely punching seven bells out of criminals, you actually take the wheel of the Batmobile as you steer it through the streets of Gotham in pursuit of the Penguin and his cronies. This section makes full use of the Mega-CD's sprite scaling facility to provide fantastic road-side objects. in typical laser-disc style, this is one of those games where you have to manoeuvre a character out of harm's way. You only have to make one move at a time and the game actually tells you which one to do so it's more a test of reflexes than a game of real skill. But what sells it are its sound effects and incredible cartoon graphics, which have to be seen to be believed. Microcosm, a visually stunning action game, also from Psygnosis. 100 "


"Man, it's for real One of the major selling points of CD technology is its ability to create Full Motion Video, or FMV — video on compact disc, games with that Hollywood touch. IN THE THICK OF IT... Check out a few seconds of video action from the stunning Night Trap Scenone, and the Oggers he in wall behind the front door I wonder what's going to happen next? Tin girl: bolt, the camera pulls back and we see the Oggers going in pursuit of our unfortunat: heroines. The next shot lakes us to the Inp of the stairs, by this point you must have deactivated the star well trap Here come the Oggers. they get their hands on the girlies it's game over otherwise you head lo... ..the bedroom. The girls barricade themselves in while You wonder off and check on the rest of the group. BIG FILMS Games such as Sewer Shark and 7th Guest have proved that in the world of CD actors and actresses are now key elements. Gone are measly sprites, instead companies such as Sega and Virgin are hiring studios, directors and producers to create the key elements in their games. At the moment most games work by replaying digitised sequences rather than true film, but that's set to change. Later this year we'll see the release of the Philips FMV cartridge. This gadget plugs into a CD-I and allows it to play film straight from CD. The quality will be even better than Super VHS, and plans are afoot to include videos on CD singles, so you can watch the music through your CDmachine. TV pictures actually run at 24 frames every second, which is bit beyond the capabilities of most CD machines. At the moment, using the most advanced compression techniques, it is possible, to store 75 minutes of high-quality video on one disc. In the mean time we have to be content with the 10 to 15 frames on most CD-based video, However, Psygnosis think they've found a way to cram full 24 frame-per-second action onto a CD for their latest game Dracula, as do Virgin with the Mega-CD version of Terminator. We wait with baited breath Many film Licenses are also turning to their movie originals for graphics. Dracula, from Psygnosis, features digitised characters from the Francis Ford Coppola movie. Other games such as Terminator and Hook will also feature digitised scenes, sound and music to give the game a more movie-like atmosphere. Arnie and Keanu, two of the bug guns coming to the Mega-CD. Dracula and Terminator both promise stunning full-motion video. In Sherlock Homes you interview characters back in 19th century London. While it looks impressive, it also points toward the problem that will replace bad graphics: bad acting! Blue screen, or chromakey as they call it in the trade, is one of the techniques used to get people into the frame. The actor is filmed against a blue backdrop, then when the scene is transferred to computer the character is cut out and stuck on a background of computer-generated graphics. This was how 7th Guest was put together. Night trap has a massive cast of teenage guys and girls trying to escape the horrors that inhabit a spooky house. Your job is to guide them safely away from traps, while also keeping your agents out of harms way. cplay Seene? 101 "


"Mega-CD games take a leap into the f «Welcome to the next level» is Sega's slogan for the Mega-CD, but what can you really expect from the machine? Here's some of the titles which would be simply impossible to produce on cartridge. THUNDERHAWK O ontact roduced by Derby-based Core Design, publishers of Heimdall and Chuck Rocks 1 and 2, this is set to be one of the most impressive games ever. This helicopter Sim has its roots in the Amiga game of the same name, although fans of that version won't recognise it now. The graphics in this chopper game are jaw dropping. The landscape is entirely scaled along the lines of Mode 7 backdrops in SNES games such as Super Mario Cart. Not only is it stupendously fast, it's also fully mapped out with roads and rivers so it constantly changes as you fly over it. And no, it doesn't stop there, the buildings and enemy vehicles are also sprite-scaled and update smoothly as you approach them. The combined effect makes for 3D-style graphics the likes of which you've never seen before. Rather than make a simulation, Core have opted to make Thunderhawk more of a shoot 'em up. Because of the fast pace of the action, they've had to make the game as big possible so you don't run out of things to shoot. This could be the game to set the Mega-CD alight and have other computer owners staring in envy. Boats are just one of your targets in Core's incredible Thunderhawk. Often alluded to, but never seen, this will be the first game to make full use of the Mega-CD's background scaling. It works by taking an object then mathematically resizing it. Before this hardware was available, programmers often had to include different graphics for each and every size that an object was to be scaled to. Very time consuming indeed. To keep the game at speed, it makes full use of the 12Mhz processor inside the Mega-CD. This means you actually have two 16-bit processors running at once if you count the one in the Megadrive but it doesn't mean the machine is 32-bit. The sprite scaled vehicles and landscapes look completely stunning. We could be looking at the game of the year. SWITCH Utilising hardware scaling, this lift contracts and crushes our hero. urrently on release in Japan, this game shows what CD technology is all about and it's very, very strange indeed. It centres around a boy who's trapped in a bizarre world in which each and every every switch he flicks could take him either one step nearer home, or closer, in fact, to the game over the screen, The game employs just about every facet of the Mega-CD's talents, from sprite rotation to never-before-seen warping effects. In one instance our hero is sitting in the cockpit of a turn-of-the-century bi-plane when it suddenly twists into a corkscrew shape. This is done purely with the Mega-CD's graphics hardware rather than as an animation made up from different sprites, as would be done on lesser systems. This is in addition to hours of music, speech and effects which combine with the game's strange humour to produce one of the most original products ever seen. There isn't any gameplay as such, as you proceed through trial and error, but the sheer number of possible outcomes to an action mean the game is never dull. It's also impossible to see all the locations in one game, which makes it last for ages. Because each action has at least six possible outcomes, the Mega-CD employs direct accessing method where the disc is read at exactly the right location. This works by the programmers encoding a list of CD tracks into each level of the game so it knows exactly where to go at the right moment. This cuts down access times significantly, so there's hardly a pause in the game. A Press too many wrong switches and one of 102 "


"TTTTTTTTTTT uture... FINAL FIGHT Ithough this doesn't make use of many of the hardware features, this game proves that coin-op quality games can be produced on compact disc with ease. Final Fight CD is actually better than the arcade original. It has more levels, better sound and just about everything even the most die-hard fans of the game could ask for. The plot is simple. Mayor Hagger's daughter has been kidnapped by Mad Gear, a gang of no-good SOBs who want control of the city. What they didn't count on was ex-wrestler Hagger hunting them down with his two karate-master mates, Cody and Guy. Yep, this is an ordinary tale of vengeance and justice. There's a two-player mode which lets you and mate take your choice of characters into action, and there are more than enough enemies to keep the most violent of players happy for a long time to come. This is streets ahead of the SNES and Amiga versions and really demonstrates the ability of CD games to recreate the pace and power of the far larger coin-ops. With the storage capacity of a CD loads of frames of animation have been included. Although the coin-op is several years old now, this Mega-CD version shows just how powerful a thing a CD can be. As the programmers weren't limited by chip size as they were with the SNES version, they have been able to include all the levels, bonus rounds and characters of the arcade original, plus many extra features. A Thanks to CD music and the PCM chip, the sound effects are actually better than those of the coin-op. Pok A Because of the additional processor speed, large graphics and plenty of characters can be included. Test your prowess between levels by destroying this gang member's car.   orld's landmarks will explode! 103 "


"LOADS OF INFO We've told you how good CD is, now read on and find out how it makes CD games so hot The biggest thing CDs have in their favour are their massive storage capacity. A normal disc can hold, over 600 times the information of a standard cartridge. The access time isn't as fast, but programmers have got around this by loading the next sequence into memory. That said, RAM cartridges may be coming out on the Mega-CD. These would store information at the start of a game, cutting down on access time when the action really hots up. SOUND 399999999999933 Gone are the days when sound effects fought for space against the music. CD games can employ actually recorded sound effects and sound tracks. This is put to good use in games such as Sherlock Holmes, in which you find clues by listening to what the characters are saying. Because the sound reproduction is identical to that of a normal music CD player, your CD machine can be hooked up to a stereo for even better sound reproduction. What no machine has yet is digital oversampling, the technique which newer CD players use to get clearer sound. But who knows? Maybe the next generation of machines will actually be better than conventional CD players. VIDEO 99999999999999 Apart from the obvious advantage of video and digitised graphics, the extra storage space on a CD allows for far more frames of animation on normal sprites. With near unlimited memory at their disposal, programmers and artists now have an almost free-reign when designing graphics. This could hasten the way for video CDs, compact discs with visual tracks. At the moment these only exist in laser disc form for machines such as the Philips Laser Disc player. GAMES 99999999999999 Once more the extra storage capacity of a CD frees up programmers from limitations. The new capabilities have also lead to startling new concepts for games such as the Make My Video series and 7th Guest. A new wave of laser disc coin-ops are also on their way to Mega-CD. These include Mad Dog Macree and Who Shot Johnny Rock? Many older games, such as Lucasfilm's Loom, are now being rehashed for CD. While the gameplay will remain untouched, we can expect our ears to be treated to hours of speech and orchestral soundtracks, cor! CD-G999999999999999 Another aspect to CD technology is CD-Gs. These are just like normal music CDs except they contain special tracks which can only be read by CD-ROM drives. When played they show you pics of the bands, lyrics and other natty bits of information. CDs EVEN HAVE ROOM FOR THE BORING STUFF... If you want something more than games, there are also things like encyclopedias in which you can not only read entries but see them moving and talking, too. There are also other reference titles such as Treasures Of The Smithsonian, which is a complete CD catalogue of all the Smithsonian Institute's exhibits. Software such as this is only possible on a format like compact disc, and even then some titles come on two or three discs totalling and incredible 2,500 Megabytes of information! WHAT'S NEXT? Because of the amazing potential of compact discs, the next generation of consoles are guaranteed to be CD-based, Commodore are currently working on a 32-Bit CD Amiga console, while Sega are working away on their next big, projects which also looks likely to be a 32-bit machine. Don't expect it to be a souped up Megadrive though, our sources tell us that their next machine is going to be something completely different with features never before seen on a console. They're keeping everything under their hats at the moment, but can expect to see this wonder machine materialising in Japan early next year. 104 "

It's a bargain and no mistake. t may seem pricey, but this game contains all six of the groundbreaking Ultima RPGs. The first three games seem hopelessly out of date at first, but they're still fun to play and you can see how much they influenced the world of RPG software. If you like roleplaying games this is a disc you can't afford to be without. The Zorks are without a doubt among the most popular adventure games of all time, A Classic RPG action in Ultima, as you battle against orcs, orges and other creatures from the darkside. WING COMMANDER 2 AND ULTIMA UNDERWORLD PC CD-ROM PRICE: $49.99 MICROPROSE COLLECTION MIDWINTER AND GUNSHIP 2000 PC CD-ROM PRICE: $49.99 hrown together on this disk are two of Origin's biggest titles. Wing Commander puts you in the hotseat of a space attack craft where Tere you try to bring freedom to the galaxy. Ultima Underworld, on the other hand, sends you into the bowels of the Earth, armed with a sword and few magic spells as you try to slay an evil deity. A One of the best things about Wing Commander CD is that it doesn't soak up loads of hard disk space. This is just one of many discs from Microprose who seem to have released most of their back catalogue on CD. The games are no different from the originals, but are still very playable and good value for money if you haven't got them already Take to the skies in Microprose's classic helicopter sim, Gunship. It's unchanged from the original version, but comes with Midwinter on this disk. MEGA-CD UPDATES 01:01 nother feature made possible by CDs are improved versions of existing games. By far the biggest of these will Sonic CD, which is on its way with more levels and more features. Lucasfilm are also planning to release updated versions of their adventure games on Mega-CD. The first one looks likely to be the Secret Of Monkey island. This version will probably include speech and more sound effects, so keep your ears peeled. BEST 0:00 Golden Axe LEVEL CLASS NOV BUDGET MANIA All these titles come free with the Mega-CD. Revenge Of Shinobi. Ithough there hasn't been anything confirmed yet, Sega look set to be releasing some of their older, classic titles on CD. Although the games will be exactly the same as the originals, they will be significantly cheaper in compilation, giving Mega-CD freaks a chance to boost their collections. Compilations and budget CD are made possible by the relative cheapness of duplicating discs. Despite what anybody says, cartridges do cost a fair whack so it's far more convenient for companies such as Sega to opt for CD. With floppy disks you're limited by memory, with each one holding just under 1.4 Megabytes. CDs can hold over 600 times that amount though, which makes for better and larger games. Hendrix CD-G A keep an eye out for more Mega-CD compilations in the future. 105 "


"Want to know what's worth buying? Here's a round-up of some of the best CD games available. 03 A While it doesn't push the Mega-CD to its limits, Wolf Child does feature some nice CD music and plenty of addictive gameplay. WOLF CHILD JVC MEGA-CD .99 Converted by Core from their Amiga smash of the same name, this version offers a lot more than the original. You are the Wolf Child, an acrobatic hero who's on a quest to save his father from an evil villain. While the game fails to show off the Mega-CD's graphical capabilities, the sound effects and music more than compensate. There are only nine levels, but each one is so vast it'll take you ages to get through. Wolf Child isn't very original, but still makes for some good platform action. 79%% Return to Game? Replay Scene? A Holmes and Watson get down to some serious detecting. It's not quite as good as the TV series, but you can't play that though, can you? SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE COM SIMULATIONS MEGA-CD .99 This is one of the first interactive movie-type games on the Mega-CD, as intrigue and deerstalkers come to the Amiga. Most of the game is made up from live action interviews, as either Sherlock or Watson try to worm information out of the many characters involved in a crime. When you think you've collected enough evidence you 106 "


"can go before a judge and submit your case. While there are three mysteries to solve, the action is limited and the novelty soon wears off. The bad acting doesn't help either. However, if you're a fan of Conan Doyle's classics, you'll no doubt enjoy this. Firstly, the biggest advantage of having the game on CD is that you save about 20Mb of hard disk space. Secondly, the disc contains not only Wing Commander 2, but all the add-on missions. If you like the game there's more than enough action on this disc to keep you playing for ages. 82% 78% I Cance 5 Lyrics BORN 03:12:07 Select the scene you want, cut it, position it then bung in some special effects. When you've done that see what the viewers think of it when they ring in with their instant votes. A Sewer Shark is without a doubt one of the fastest Mega-CD games yet. The action is punctuated by some fantastic video cut-scenes. KRISS KROSS MAKE MY VIDEO SEGA MEGA-CD SEWER SHARK SEGA MEGA-CD .99 Of all the CD games released so far, this is one of the strangest concepts yet. The aim is to create a stunning video for teenage rappers Kriss Kross. At your disposal is a wealth of video clips and special effects along with plenty of music. It's one of those multimedia-style efforts but at the end of the day it's still a game. The game is hosted by a video jockey who rates your performance as well as bringing the whole game together with jokes and intros. Surprisingly, this is actually a very fun game, although it helps if you're a Kriss Kross fan. With plenty more games planned in this series, there should be something for everyone. 4% This is one of the original Mega-CD releases, and still one of the most spectacular. The action is all 'live' as you take to the sewers in order to kill all of the bizarre creatures living there. Apart from the frenetic gameplay, what really helps make the game are the video cut-scenes in which you receive advice from other characters and updates on the plot. The tunnel scenes where created and filmed by John Dykstra, who was one of the brains behind the special effects in the Star Wars movies, amongst other things, and as a result the action comes thick and fast. 83% 0305 APH Another title produced by Core, this is currently the best race game on Mega-CD. It's fast, smooth and well addictive. Wing Commander also looks set to make an appearance on Mega-CD later this year. We'll keep you posted on that one. JAGUAR XJ220 JVC MEGA-CD .99 WING COMMANDER 2+ ORIGIN PC CD-ROM .99 There are plenty of CD-ROM versions of this PC classic, with this one coming out to of the lot. While the basic game format remains unchanged, this disk contains everything a budding Wing Commander needs. The first racing game on the Mega-CD really pushes the boat out. You're given a shiny new Jaguar XJ220, the world's fastest production car, to drive across a number of gruelling courses. All the road side objects are sprite scaled, making for a smooth track and a good feeling of speed. One nice feature is the track editor, which lets you 107 "


"design your own courses then save them to the Mega-CD's internal battery. It. It's got all the thrills and spills of genuine, hell-for-leather racing. It will be a long time before anyone beats this. 85% EB A Most of the platform stages are the same as the cartridge version of the game; however play it on CD and you get awesome music and 3D levels. BATMAN RETURNS SEGA MEGA-CD PRICE: .99 A Colourful, cute and full of action. If you enjoy Sonic-type action you'll flip over Wonderdog. 3 WONDERDOG JVC MEGA-CD PRICE: .99 This was the first game on JVC's Japanese system, the Wondermega (a combined Megadrive/Mega-CD, which won't be released over here), although it hardly puts the machine through its paces. As Wonderdog you have to liberate your homeworld from the evil Pittbullies The graphics are probably the most colourful ever seen on a Mega-CD game, and there's plenty of stages to negotiate. One surprising thing is that the CD soundtrack often gets a little confused and fails to play at the right point, but that can be explained by the fact that the game is one of the first on a new machine. In the meantime, this is very playable and there's plenty of worse things to spend you cash on. Based on Batman's previous cartridge outing, the platform levels are little changed. What this version does offer is several 3D sections including a chase in the batmobile and a jaunt in the batboat. This is the first movie-to-CD game and it does the film justice. Not only do you get more game than is on cartridge, there's also plenty of sampled speech to bolster the action. The gameplay can prove frustrating at times, although once you get the swing of things it becomes bearable If you liked the film, you'll love this game.

Best of all they're also coming out on Mega-CD! THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND LUCASFILM -> CD-ROM PRICE: .99 This follow-up to the highly uninspiring Heavy Nova takes the same Robot beat 'em up action from the first game and gives it a good kick in the butt to provide a far better range of action. The result is a far more enjoyable beat 'em up-cum-arcade adventure. Your robot has plenty of moves at his disposal and more than enough enemies to try them on. As kick-ass beat 'em ups go this is hardly groundbreaking stuff, but it is the only half-decent one on Mega-CD. Not an outstanding game, but if you've already got the original, this is worth checking out. As Guybrush Thweepwood, aspiring pirate, you've got to crack the secret of Monkey Island in order to be accepted as a proper blunderer of the high seas. This game has everything, puzzles, action and humour. If you don't have it on disk, get it on CD, you're missing out one hell of a good game. 75% 93% 108 "


"SAABUSCLE Sammy The only big let-down so far on Mega-CD. With the machine's technical capabilities it should have been child's play to convert this game accurately. Willy Beamish is the first Lucasfilm game to appear on Mega-CD. Keep an eye out for loads more from this publisher in the near future. AFTERBURNER 3 SEGA MEGA-CD PRICE: $44.99 WILLY BEAMISH LUCASFILM PC CD-ROM & MEGA-CD PRICE .99 This game has turned out to be one of the real CD disappointments. Basically it's the same as every other Afterburner game, with you piloting an F-14 against an unknown enemy. It suffers from a complete lack of action and on top of that the graphics are terrible. When you think so much could have been done with sprite scaling and rotation it's a surprise that Sega actually bothered releasing this at all. Don't be taken in by the flashy coin-ops, this is a Compact Disc duffer and no mistake, This game is a bold attempt at creating an interactive cartoon, although it just falls short when it comes to playability. As young Willy, you've got to try to survive the sort of hazards which befall all 10-year-olds, such as school and big sisters. The humour is to be groaned at rather than laughed at, although the impressive graphics encourage you to play on further. All the speech and sound effects come straight from CD and add greatly to the game. Not inspired software, but not bad if you can afford the asking price. 75% Of all the CD games the 7th Guest is the most spectacular. Coming on two CD's it features loads of FMV action. Manga-style cartoon action is the basis for this game, as you attempt to become king of the road by ramming everyone else off it. 7th GUEST VIRGIN PC CD-ROM PRICE .99 ROAD AVENGER SEGA MEGA-CD PRICE .99 This game is yet another attempt at playable Manga-style cartoon games, although it falls short of the mark. It's programmed by the same team who produced Cobra Command, which comes free with the Mega-CD, and you can tell. The graphics are drawn in the same style, although the action plods along and never reaches the level that it did in Cobra. If you enjoyed that game, though, you'll probably like this one too. This is the game everyone is talking about. It's a very basic adventure, but what it does is combine FMV with computer graphics, so you have actors overlaid on top of computer generated images. Such is the size of this game that it actually comes on two discs, which is a direct result of the masses of film-quality animation, speech and music. What the game lacks is playability, what it does have is pose value. If you want to show off your CD-ROM, this is the game to do it with. The graphics are incredible and combined with the CD sound, this title has had jaws dropping all over the country. Full review page 48 this issue. 3 71% 80% 109 "

"NAPOLEON THE TOWN CRIER Dear YOB, I've heard you're so wise and clever, so answer these questions please. 1. Is a PC Engine 8 or 16-bit? 2. Streetfighter's on the Engine soon, but will it be Champion Edition or just the normal version? 3. Will the graphics be as good as the SNES? 4. Were the screenshots shown in issue 138 really Streetfighter on the Engine? MWONG LETCHWORTH YOB: 1.8. 2. Champion! 3. They look awesome. The Engine graphics have been ported from the Champion Edition arcader, which were redesigned and improved from the arcade original. Champion Edition defines the characters more clearly and makes them look even harder, so that will be reflected in the Engine conversion. However, the graphics capabilities of the SNES are superior, so scrolling might not be so smooth on the NES machine, for example. You pays your money and takes your choice... 4. Yup, the very same and if you didn't have a brain the size of a frozen walnut and had bothered to look at them you could have answered 2 and 3 yourself. Micro-C Dear YOB, I am the very proud owner of at least five games for every console you can think of. Sadly I have no actual consoles to play them on, but I am planning on buying some soon. Maybe when the price of a Megadrive and Mega-CD falls below  and the price of a SNES is .99. So until then I guess I'll just have to keep looking at the pictures on the back of my game packs unless you feel like approaching Sega and Nintendo and asking them to drop their prices ever so slightly for me. Well, instead you could say Hello to my friend Chris Clark who lets me read his CVG every month because I am to stingy to buy my own. I'd also like to ask you some questions, so could you please answer them sensibly and \"no crap please.\" 1. Do you know the code to get onto Day 2 of California Games on the NES? 2. Will SF2 ever be available for the NES? 3. Is it better to use a joystick or joypad when playing a game like SF2? 4. Which is better: Super Mario 2 or 3 on the NES? 5. Could you please print a picture of yourself so I can practice for my darts tournament? SAMANTHA BALDERSTON WEST LOTHIAN, SCOTLAND. YOB: 1. Yup. 2. Yup. 3. Depends. Capcom's Arcade Power (Joy)Stick is well wicked on the SNES, although as Amiga and PC owners everywhere will know, joysticks are generally a bit cack with the game. 4. 3. 5. No need. Why not just shove the sharp ends into your ear and shout \"Bullseye!\" if you ever hit your brain. TAP THE MAYOR OF WOKINGHAM (WINNER) HARVEY SMITH Dear YOB, I am a Sega fan. I have lots of games and I was wondering if you could give me a list of cheats? TIMOTHY HALL BILSTON, WEST MIDLANDS. YOB: Certainly. Here's a list of my favourites: 1. Stop the ice cream man and order his biggest vanilla whip special with chocolate sauce, hundreds and thousands, nuts and about sixteen flakes. Just as he hands it over, drop it on the floor and start to cry. Chances are he'll give you another for free, and even if he doesn't you can always scoop up most of the droppie after he's gone. 2. Hide a dead cockroach in your pocket and visit the most expensive restaurant in town. Order their swankiest meal, eat half of it, put the cockroach on the plate and throw the loudest wobbly you can. You'll get the meal for free and they'll even give you cash to keep quiet. 3. Be rather sad, don't be very good at anything, get elected Prime Minister and just watch the cash roll in... Dear YOB Esq, Firstly, thank you for adding some truly original and witty humour into my life through the greatest computer games mag in the world. You guys at CVG really give us everything we could possibly ask for and (THIS SECTION DELETED ON THE GROUNDS OF PUBLIC SANITY YOB). OK, I agree that sounds a bit sad. I would love a SNES with SF2 to listen to the familiar Ha-Do-Ken in my living room, but I'm a bit short of cash (hint hint!) Now please could you answer these questions: 1. When is the Turbo version of Streetfighter 2 going to come out on the SNES? (You know, the one where they can throw fireballs in mid-air?) 2. How much will it cost? 3. Will you ever reveal your true identity? 4. What football team does Paul Anglin support? 5. Which do you prefer: SF2 or Super Star Wars? 6. Who's your favourite character on SF2? 7. When will the price of a SNES drop? Thanks a lot! SARAH MALIAN SUNNY CYPRUS PS Tell Paul Anglin his earring is so cute! YOB: 1. September. Remember, you read it here first.2.

"TOMMY COOPER Dear YOB, I have a few questions to ask you, starting with a real big smegger of a poser. 1. Why do you insist on being a cold-cut turd? 2. When will Streetfighter 2 come out on Megadrive? 3. Why do you say you'll give  away when you can't afford an Oxfam jockstrap? 4. Honestly, what console is best: a Megadrive or Super NES and don't say both or I'll go mad and kill my dog! 5. One remark about my dog and I'll personally see when you go to bed tonight your teddy will be dead with sawdustall over your bed. 6. Last one. Why are you a bilingual git? DAVID ARMSTRONG SOMEWHERE BETWEEN YOU AND LONDON. PS My address for you to send me my money is (DELETED TO PROTECT THE CRANALLY CHALLENGED YOB). YOB: Is it just me, or is everyone called Armstrong a bit of a turd after that bloke wasted all that that fuel to go to the moon, land on the thing and, when he finally managed to get down the ladder, fluffed all his lines? Thought so. Dear YOB, There has been quite a bit of talk recently, and rightly so, about the similarity between the AUSTRALIANS price of Mega-CD games and Megadrive cartridges. The GENERALLY argument has asked the question: why, when CDs cost just ten pence to duplicate, do they sell for the same price as cartridges that can cost a few pounds to make? To quote Sega marketing supremo Philip Ley: \"While the cost of replicating a CD is far lower than that of a cartridge, the actual development costs of a CD-ROM game are far higher. Games like Night Trap have the costs of cast and shooting crews on top of the game's design and data coding.\" MY ASS! Night Trap and Sewer Shark were both written in the mid-1980s for an American CD console called the Nemo, which never got off the ground. You can tell their age because the fit one off Diff'rent Strokes, who appears in Night Trap, still looks OK. The only expense Sega had was paying a couple of programmers to convert it over to their system. Both these games could have sold at a fiver each and Sega would still have made a profit. Most of the other games released so far will have been incredibly cheap to produce. Cobra Command and Road Avenger are arcade port-overs which will have required a very minimal re-programming before they were released. The «Make My Video\" series are just three ready-made videos strung together with a small amount of new material a kind of chop-shop method of programming. Even if a totally original game of the Night Trap-type was made today by Sega it would be infinitely cheaper to produce than an equivalent traditionally programmed cartridge game. OK, so you pay ten out-of-work actresses for a few days' filming, digitise the pictures and string it together with a simple front-end program. Alternatively, to make a standard cartridge game get a team of programmers, graphic artists, a musician and God knows who else, lock them in a room for a year and hey presto it's a bouncing baby game. I certainly know which would be the cheaper to make before we even count the cost of the media. OK, so the first group of releases are way overpriced, but the future does hold some promise. Ignore the shoddy digitised games and look out for future releases such as Silpheed, Dracula and Joe Montana. These look as if they might actually be able to justify their full-price status. MATHEW TAYLOR OLDHAM, LANCS. PS The fat bloke in Sewer Shark's big claim to fame is being a cop in Die Hard II. YOB: AT LAST! A letter which actually makes some sense, and makes it rather well. Dracula and Joe Montana are actually a bit cack, but apart from that I think you're right in just about everything you say. What do the rest of you think? Is an intelligent CVG reader like Mathew Taylor just a figment of my imagination, or should I have him stuffed? Hang on a minute, here comes another one... 3)}; TRAFFIC WARDENS ENGINE Dear YOB, How can you rate the Mega-CD? I've just recently flogged mine to find out that it uses the same 64 colours on screen, which you simply never mentioned. It made me so sick to play Earnest Evans poorly drawn graphics spoiled by the lack of Megadrive colours. The sound is fantastic, but that's what you'd expect from a CD! However, you even rate Night Trap. How can the Mega-CD produce quality video images on screen? It looks grainy with only 64 colours from a pallete of 512 and it's simply not enough. Although there are some good titles available, such as Final Fight, I can't see why everybody should get so excited over it. How can anybody get serious about consoles? They're just stupid toys. If you're serious about making your machine more powerful, buy yourself an Amiga and upgrade it with a hard drive or buy a Commodore CDTV. Maybe it has poor software, but at least it's capable of 16 million colours (with an optional card). Most important of all, it'll be used for Virtual Reality (as seen in Lawnmower Man) in the not-too distant future. I'd laugh my head off if I heard that console CD-ROMS would be used for Virtual Reality. Everybody will be using Virtual Reality in the future and the CDTV is an exceptional head-start! Consoles wouldn't be useful in the future. IF YOU DO NOT PRINT THIS LETTER I WILL UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AGREE WITH ME ENTIRELY. OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE ME YOUR COMMENTS. STEVE PIERRO NORTH LONDON YOB: Maybe I shouldn't bother. If you speak out of your ass | dread to think what you listen through.. 100) POLICEMEN (RUNNERS UP) Dear YOB, How ya doing mate!

Is it Jenny Abrook or sad crying Sadie? 2. Are you a man or a woman? 3. When is your birthday? LOONYPOOL 4. When will these games be SAVE O released: Teenage Mutant Hero, Mario World II, Terminator 3, Robocop 7, Turtles 5, Robocop 6, Streetfighter 4 and Toki 2? 5. Is it true my friend says that he already has Super Double Magilla Gorilla Giant Super X081 Nintendo that gives him a free life game? 6. I heard Streetfighter 2029. Is it any good? 7. Mega-CD have how many games? IMRAN HIDAYAT LEIDEN, HOLLAND PS Print my letter or I come to see you with a baseball bat, a Menacer, a Nintendo gun and also with a tank and I will attack you to pieces like this and I will burn your corner. PPS If I win the  cash hurry like I said in the GO! letter. YOB: 1. I used to go out with this girl who was so ugly she could stop a clock. She had so many spots and boils 1 went round her house once and found a blind man reading her face. 2. If you can't tell the difference I'd seek immediate remedial help. 3. Whenever I walk into a pub where nobody knows who I am. 4. When your mum finally gives up and takes you back for a refund. 5. Yes. If you wait until Christmas Eve, turn your bed due South, write a letter to Santa Claus and sign it Imran Sillyprat, the Tooth Fairy comes and places one under your pillow. Unless you live in Holland, of course, in which case you just get laughed at like those sad Dutch types generally do. 6. Yes. It go \"doo doo dah dah.\" 7. As many as a Dutchman can count. Dear YOB, I have a few questions for you: 1. Is it true that in Streetfighter 2 on arcade there is a Sheng Long? If it is true can you send a picture? 2. Is it true that in Streetfighter 3 you can fight all the Streetfighter 1 characters or what? 3. Is there a Super Mario World 2 on Super Nintendo? 4. Is there a Super Nintendo coming out that is 32-bit? 5. I am poor. Can I have a bit of money, like ? 6. Is there a Sonic 3 coming out on Megadrive? 7. Is there such a thing as Final Fight 2? 8. Are you a man or a woman? 9. Do you go for Wigan Rugby League Club? 10. One more thing: what is the difference between Super Nintendo and Super Famicom? ARTHUR KOUTSAKIS SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA YOB: 1. Nope. The Sheng Long story was a wind-up invented by some sad American mag who mocked up a fake picture by giving Ryu long blonde hair. Their dimwit readers believed every word and swanked about telling all their mates and we even received letters at CVG from people claiming to have fought him by beating every character with Perfects. It was all a load of steaming chihuaha cack and those who were taken in are now the laughing stock of the civilised world. 2. But even the thickness of these sad types was nothing compared to the double-doh stupidity of people who think Streetfighter 3 has already been released. If people are going to believe that sort of thing, they must be very unhappy indeed. 3. And they're all geniuses compared to someone who asks a question like that. However, because I'm feeling generous I'll tell you that there's definitely another Mario game coming on SNES soon. In fact there may be ama more than one and, oh why should I spill Hmmm...3 any more goodies to a psynaptically challenged individual like you? 4. Haven't you heard of the Super CD? 5. I'll give you a pound for every point of your IQ. Looks like you owe me a fiver. 6. Yup 7. Yup 8. Why bother to ask? Australians don't know the difference! 9. Only if Wigan RLC goes for me. 10. One's got a wotsit and the other's got a thing. wwy bomo pod ole Ya, ...02 ROYAL GUARDSMEN Dear YOB, In issue 136 there was this overgrown piece of camel puke called Adam Perkins from Cambridge who was insulting the Welsh. You go and play with your Barbie dolls while I play with my SNES with four games. Please answer my questions: 1. Is there going to be a Super Mario Kart 2? 2. How much will the Mega-CD cost? 3. Is it true that you can be M Bison with the Capcom joystick? 4. Is Probotector decent? PHILIP M TAYLOR WREXHAM, N WALES YOB: 1. If I told you that SFX Game Number Two will be Super Mario Kart Champion Edition would that get you all excited? If I told you the game will feature new Mode 36 graphics and an optional Virtual Reality headset would that have you foaming at the mouth? Well then, it's a bit of a shame I lied. 2. It's in the shops now, you dodo. 3. You can be Larry Grayson if you want. 4. Does a bear sit in the woods? 115 "


"CVG RESULTS SPECIAL*CVG RESULTS Two months ago CVG and US Gold offered you the chance to win one of the most amazing prizes CVG has ever given away a weekend trip for two to George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch in California. All (ho, ho) you had to do is recreate a scene or two from the Star Wars trilogy on home video! This, if you can stomach it, is what happened next... WARS DAVID BROOKES AND JONATHAN GLASS Star Wars Trilogy lo be honest, we didn't expect many of you to enter. In fact, two weeks after the magazine came out we still hadn't received one single entry. But just as the CVG crew started stocking up on beach balls and sun-tan lotion in preparation for blagging the prize of a lifetime for ourselves, what happened? Entries started to flood in. Within a month we were receiving over a dozen entries a DAY until there were enough to keep the CVG boys in blank tapes for life. The reason for the delay was that rather than (as we expected) banging out cheap and tacky movies in a day or so, many entrants were actually doing it PROPERLY, with special effects, music and everything. As a result, some of the films took over a month to produce that's almost as long as it takes to film a real Hollywood movie! Well, almost! As we write this, the compo has just closed and the CVG games room is awash with tapes and honestly, we were astounded by the general quality of the entries. Sure, there were plenty of stinkers (more on those later), but the majority of your movies were surprisingly good, with three or four that were even better than the original! Almost. As a result, we've found it almost impossible to pick a winner which is why CVG will be holding a gala judging night later this month, to which some lucky nominees may be invited. In the meantime, we thought it only fair to show off some of the best and worst) of the entries until we announce the final winners next month. May the force be with you. These two chirpy chaps from Essex took the brave step of recreating famous scenes from not just one but all three Star Wars movies and playing them for laughs. With Chewbacca, played by a cat, a dustbin starring as R2-D2 and a human cast, that were DEFINITELY several cards short of full deck throughout the entire production, how could they go wrong? This was only the second entry we received, and it's still one of the funniest, reducing the CVG staff to lunchtime tears even now. Particular credit must go to David 116 "


"SPECIAL*CVG RESULTS SPECIAL*CVG DANIEL HOLMES Star Wars Brookes' bathtub portrayal of Yoda in the Jedi training scene, We also liked the way the guys destroyed the Imperial shield bunker on Endor by kicking it out of a tree. Stop-motion animation scenes added technical merit, and the whole thing was rounded off nicely when the cast, unsure of how to end their movie, simply decided to have a rave in the front room to the sounds of the Prodigy and the Dollops. Great stuff, and a strong 'contender for first place, After wading through some of the cack entries, we decided that any entry that used footage tom out of the original movies, was a cop-out and wasn't going to win. This entry, however, proved to be the exception to the rule. Probably the funniest of all the entries, this film recreated, the famous Tattooine/Cantina, scene by splicing together old, movie footage with speciallyfilmed scenes. What makes this such a hoot, though, is that all, the dialogue has been totally redubbed, so no-one EVER talks in sync, and the original script is, replaced by a succession of suggestive one-liners and deviant references that would put any of the Carry Ons to shame. A stunning fight scene at the end using Star Wars figures and a seriously manic Obi-Wan rounded it all off nicely, and if this had been a bit longer, it probably would have won outright. As it is, it's still in with a damn good chance on comedy value alone. IAN DYGA AND PETER MCKENZIE Star Wars Two humble farm boys from Fraserburgh in Scotland might just be jetting off to Hollywood on the strength of this entry. The judges were looking for humour and technical merit, and this entry, recreating the rescue of Princess Leia from the Death Star, had plenty of both. You wouldn't think that a barnyard could ever be passed off as a futuristic space station, but these lads made a fine job of it, using computer-generated laser RICK'N'RICK Star Wars effects in the shootout scenes with stunning results. We liked Judge Dredd's cameo performance and the excellent lightsabre fight, but nothing prepared us for what has become the most played scene of all in the office, At the end of the movie a \"live\" stormtrooper is literally blown away by a laser shot in the chest, We've no idea how they managed to make their own explosive \"squib\", but the result is amazing as the stormtrooper is blown off his feet by the force of the armour-shredding explosion. Lots of blood and the guy's even in shock at the end of it. We love it! Early on in the judging, we decided that anyone who used cars as spaceships obviously couldn't be bothered to make an effort and didn't deserve to win. This is why we particularly liked this entry, from a band of likely tykes from Yorkshire, who recreated the Death Star escape and trench 117 "


"CVG RESULTS SPECIAL*CVG RESULTS battle scenes. They built a convincing Millenium Falcon replica cockpit in their garage, using a furry seat cover for Chewbacca etc etc. We liked the crybaby Luke, but weren't quite so impressed by Obi-Wan's terrible acting and the very sad Lethal Weapon references. In the end, though, it was the XWing trench attack that impressed us most, featuring some smart flying and explosion effects. And Jimmy Saville's surreal cameo at the end of the movie rounded off a very pleasing package. Definitely on the first prize shortlist for com'bining fine special effects with some cracking gags nice one! Wan/ader battle and, best of all, the Death Star attack. Filmed late at night in a road tunnel with cars posing as the X-Wings and TIE Fighters, this scene was cut together brilliantly to recreate all the tension of the original, with a few laughs thrown in. But it was when the cars started firing ROCKETS (yes, rockets) at each other in an obviously illegal manner that the judges were most impressed we still can't figure out how they did it. A red hot favourite for the top spot. SAM LANYON JONES Star Wars TUESE CAD The Star Wars Cantina scene was one of the most popular with entrants and Sam Lanyon Jones did a better job than most, recruiting a large selection of mates as extras and using the local youth club/drama hall as the location. The bloke playing C-3PO was a bit crap, and it took a little while to get going, but when, in an excellent re-writing of the original plot, imperial troops invade and a mass battle ensues, the fun really begins. We don't quite understand why the Emperor had a bizarre Turkish accent, but never mind this was more than made up for by some excellent over-thetop special effects and a firefight that would put Mahabharat (dodgy Indian drama epic on BBC2 with incredibly silly battle scenes) to shame. And to round it off, Princess Leia was pretty fit as well. Phwoar! STUART PARKINS Star Wars This was the first entry we received, and if they'd all turned out to be of this quality, we would have been happy for it to be the last. More than anything, this video made us wish we'd never asked for American accents, because they were all terrible and these ones particu'larly so. And it wasn't particularly funny either. Sample joke: «I can see why you call it a light sabre, it's not very heavy.\" Oh dear. Consolation points were awarded for the scene where the sandperson beats up Luke with a broomhandle and gets a bit carried away, and for the battle with the Star Wars toys at the end. But a low production value and distinct lack of funnies means this one will be ucky to win a mask. Nice try though, lads DEREK BOYES Star Wars ROBERT ROMAN DE NIJS Star Wars Purely in terms of professionalism and technical excellence, there was little to touch this film, from Derek Boyes and his pals from Harrogate. Actually, we reckon these guys are film students or something, because it's a bit too good for a bunch of wallies with their dad's video camera. Things got off to a shaky start in the Cantina and Millennium Falcon scenes at the start, but picked up brilliantly in the final scenes, recreating (once again, the ObiBy the time this video had arrived in the office from Holland, the HM Customs and Excise had already opened it and had a good look to make sure it wasn't... ahem... adult entertainment. Amsterdam and all that, you know. All we can say is, we feel sorry for the poor govern ment official who had to watch 118 "


"SPECIAL*CVG RESULTS SPECIAL*CVG this tape, because it's not very good. Actually, that's rather cruel of us it's not bad, but it's a pretty safe bet that these guys won't be jetting off to California at US Gold's expense. And there's no point in them winning a Star Wars mask because they've already got \"em. C3-PO's metallic make-up was quite good, and we approved of the original use of the local air force museum as the rebel base, but apart from that... well, let's just say we've seen other videos from Amsterdam that have better plots. AMANDA CURL Return of the Jedi Originality points were scored early here while most people opted for a Star Wars scene, curvy Amanda from Biggleswade chose to recreate one of the toughest scenes in the trilogy, the Speeder Bike chase. Trekking down to the local forest on their mountain bike, Amanda and her feller/brother/whoever cleverly framed their shots to keep the bike out of the shot (most of the time anyway) and thus create the illusion of being on a real Imperial speeder. Almost. Good use of sound effects and COStume all help to make this an attractive entry. nowhere near as good as Amanda Curl's. In fact this was completely awful, with the only entertaining bit coming when one kid kicked in the spokes on the other's bike, causing him to fall over and hurt himself. CLIVE BILBY Mediocre special effects and bland locations combined to resign this one to the «not very good\" file, although we appreciate the sacrifice he made in burning holes in his Star Wars toys for special effects reasons. Nice costumes in the Cantina scene too, but in the end Clive's dad got dressed up like a wally for nothing. Never mind. DANIEL MCLAUGHLIN After much deliberation, the CVG team decided that, along with Jaz Singh's feeble cheat, this was the worst entry re received. No music, dull special effects and chronically bad action and they all seemed to be taking it sooo seriously, too. This picture is of Daniel's dad, who plays an Imperial Commander scary, isn't he? Note the Strepsils throat lozenges stuck to his jacket. GRAHAM MAWAT To their credit, Graham and his mates did enter into the fun spirit of things but a little too much, we think. Before long, their Star Wars movie had degenerated into a series of bizarre wide-screen Irn Bru ads and shots of people on the floor, laughing. We'll pass this one on to Jeremy Beadle, lads you might yet win something. IAGO WYNN JONES Oh dear. This was more like a video nasty than a competition entry, featuring a woman being hung and numerous scenes of extreme violence, none of which made any sense whatsoever. Sorry lads, but swearing at the top of your voice doesn't count as clever or comical. Or big. IAIN STIRLING We take it all back. THIS was actually the worst entry we received. Not only did the one boring scene (of Luke and Obi-Wan having a chat) comprise of completely crap acting and sets, but it also took us half an hour to find, since it was stuck in the middle of the tape containing a documentary about Orson Welles. Utter poo. Well, that's the pick of the bunch. The winner will no doubt be selected from one of these. But what of the others? Some of them were so bad that we decided we couldn't let the entrants get away with it so brace yourselves as we take a whistle-stop tour through some of the worst movies since Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Hercules In New York'... AND NOW... THE CACK ONES JAZ SINGH We couldn't believe the cheek of this guy. Rather than bothering to make his own film, Jaz simply sent us a copy of his souvenir video from the Universal Studios Tour (or something like that), where you're inserted into a mini Star Trek movie starring the real characters. At least everyone else did the right movie. Go away, Jaz. A FOSTER The only entry we had from Merseyside and, frankly, we could have done without it. The scene where the sandpeople ransack Luke's car was quite funny, but beyond that there was little to recommend this sorry offering B FLETCHER Another attempt at the Speeder Bike chase using pushbikes, but AND SO... Well, you've seen the best and worst of the bunch. All the entries featured here will be viewed at a special CVG/US Gold gala viewing night in the pub next door, where a joint panel of experts will be selecting the winners of the USA trip and the runner-up masks. And, considering we got so many cack ones, we'll also be submitting those to be judged and a winner selected to be awarded a special award for crapness. So tune in next month, when we'll be revealing the winner of the greatest prize in the galaxy! 119 "

It's relatively unheard of in the mainstream and only those with their fingers clamped onto the hipest pulses around know where to get the red hot tapes. A quick call to out pals at Manga HQ revealed that top titles such as Legend Of The Overfiend and Akira can be snapped up at HMV, WH Smith, Our Price, Virgin, Blockbuster Video and an everincreasing number of corner shop stockists. So take your pick! Duo is is a PC Engine with a CD drive strapped onto it! 4. We already have the best reviewers in the business, but if anyone is that interested, try getting some experience with the hundreds of fanzine-type magazines out there and send in examples of your work to bigger mags. Most importantly, study the individual magazines' styles and adapt your reviews to theirs. It's called House Style in case you're interested. 5. Although Paul Anglin sleeps with his Duo and talks to it I can't help but recommend the Megadrive out of the two. The Duo is superior in many ways; CD technology, fabulously fast shoot 'em ups and great graphics for an 8-bit. But the Megadrive is 16-bit and has unrivalled software support with top games coming out of its ear holes and with the Mega-CD, anything's possible. The choice is yours. Just bear in mind that Mega-CD technology is in the very early stages at the moment so hang in there things will get better. I WANT GAMES!

Please put me out of my misery, thanks.

It's not that I don't like the machine, far from it it's the best thing in my bedroom, apart form the 1992 Pirelli Calender. It's the fact that I hate buying import games and having to look at a teetering tower of plastic and carts swaying out of my SNES every time I want to play an up to date game. British releases are so far behind American and Japanese ones and if you look in the shops there are none of the game currently being reviewed in magazines. Surely there must be a better converting system and why do we have to wait soooo long for import games to be released? MICHAEL WATTS, LONDON TALKING TURBO Dear Steve, I own a Mega-CD and a Megadrive and I am really getting bored with them. I am thinking about getting a Turbo Duo and I would like to know a few things before I buy one. So, could you please answer these few questions for me? 1. Is there any way I can get a Turbo Duo and play it without buying a SCART TV or a monitor? 2. Can I use Turbo Grafx and normal PC Engine games on the PC Engine side of the Turbo Duo? 3. Can I use normal CD PC Engine games on the Turbo Duo? 4. I am very interested in being a reviewer for CVG. What subjects in school would I need to take and what qualifications do I need for this job. I am also excellent at art. If it means anything to you I am also good at French and German? 5. Which is better; the Turbo Duo or the Megadrive? P.S.

Dear Steve, I've got a bit of a problem that's gnawing through my senses even as I write. In last month's issue there was an advert for Manga videos. After reading it I immediately dashed down to the video rental shop to see if they had any in store. To my dismay they We agree. On the one hand the converters are invaluable for playing juicy games right NOW, but they look awful. All the actual converter does to work is match your back-up cart's security coded number to the same one held in your machine and then bypasses to the game. You can get this feature put inside the machine by an expert and then just flick a switch concealed nicely on the side to change between Jap and UK carts. This still won't help you with USA games though. As for release delays it's mostly a case of distribution setbacks. We only know of one company, Konami, who are wrestling with the possibility of simultaneous worldwide releases which would be great. However, most companies are so big and have so many subsidiaries they just can't communi cate together enough to work all the details out. Why oh why they decided to try and control the import of carts through grey import areas is beyond me 'cos they get through even now anyway, don't they.

SUMMER RELEASE *** Stage of Development 90% Completed A fistfight ensues when two rival soldiers get within sparring range. Later levels see the armies fighting in the streets. PAST FORM TEL.. PREVIEW CHABA Electronic Arts aren't shy when it comes to producing controversial software. Not too long after the Gulf War ended, amid rumour and speculation as to which would be the first firm to create a software title based upon the conflict, EA launched their Desert Strike game. Even though many reckoned the subject to be slightly taboo so shortly after the war, the game nevertheless met with critical acclaim and has now spawned a sequel, the totally excellent Jungle Strike. orget about the horror of war Electronic Arts' latest makes maiming and killing people a hoot! cal conclusion and beyond with General Chaos, a game that takes war about as seriously as the Krankies. The two warring provinces of Morinica and Viceria have never been able to settle their differences over the meeting table, so it's left to barmy army Generals Chaos and Havoc to get things sorted on the battlefield. Described as a \"killer comedy combat game\", General Chaos puts you in the title role as the army commander who must guide his troops to victory over Havoc's forces through a series of violent armed clashes to advance into enemy territory and eventually take over Viceria. So how's it all done, then? Well, in the most gratuitously violent manner possible, of course! The General's campaign is split into a series of individual skirmishes, with a particular part of land at stake in each. After selecting a small squad of battle-hardened mercenaries from the mean-looking groups available, you send your team, armed to the teeth, into battle to take on the enemy at close range. Battles take place on a single-screen warzone with you, as the General, ordering your troops how to behave where to move, who to fire at, when to lob a grenade, etc. Basically the two forces blast the hell out of each other in a close-quarter firefight that would make Norman Schwarzkopf wince. From the screenshots here and that brief description, you've no doubt sussed that this is no game for the lily-livered but you have to see it run to realise just how out-and-out HARD it really is. Armed with machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers and dynamite, the Chaos and Havoc forces contribute to a body count bigger than your average Annie movie it's a good job medics are on hand to stretcher off and patch up the wounded. But among all this camage and, well, chaos, there's a proper strategic element, EA assures us, so that players with a bit of brainpower will always succeed over the not-so-clever gung-ho, Rambo types. Well, almost always. With its comical portrayal of military violence, General Chaos might even be heading for trouble with the likes of The Sun and The Daily Mail always ready to go berserk at the sight of a slightly \"dodgy\" game, but EA doesn't seem to mind it's all about having fun they say, and having seen some of the hilarious animations featured in the battle scenes, we're inclined to agree. With the US programmers just putting the finishing touches to the game as you read this, it should be ready for review next month. Look out for this we think it's gonna be good. WO 1Svd Chaos works out his \"tactics\" in the War Room. Everybody loves wargames, right? Right. And we reckon that people are going to love EA's tongue-incheek stab at the genre more than most. Time was that the word \"Wargame\" filled most gamers with dread at the thought of little pieces of plastic/sprites being pushed around a board/screen in a dreadfully dull fashion and nothing remotely exciting happening ever. But the image of military gaming's been changing over the years, becoming more accessible and more fun and now EA's taken the genre to its logiEY: F: ROOM 124 "

Also look out for two types of power-up Beam weapons the original laser has been joined by a new «hyper\" shot that simply has to be seen to be believed! The result of all this high-octane shooting power being crammed into the 16Mb cartridge is a game that, potentially at least, looks like it's going to wipe away not just the previous R-Type games but all the other pretenders to the shoot 'em up crown on Super NES. Just take a look at the screenshots here and you'll see why the CVG boys are licking their lips in anticipation of this one dropping through the letterbox! The only problem is we don't know when it'll be, as although Irem were nice enough to sort us out with these exclusive piccies all the way from Japan, they're not saying when the game will be finished and released. It's bound to be sometime this year, but until more details come back from CVG's all-work-andnot-at-all-like-a-free-holiday trip to the CES in Chicago, all we can do is keep our fingers crossed! race yourselves one of the world's best-loved blasters is on its way back to the Super NES. Gary Whitta blasts off to destroy the evil Bydo empire. Again. Just look at the size of that beam! What is there to say about R-Type that hasn't already been said? We don't know, but we'll have a jolly good go anyway. Still regarded as one of the most influential coin-ops of the past decade, Irem's classic stunned gamesplayers with its bizarre biomechanical graphic style (inspired in part by Alien) and has been converted to almost every format imaginable it was one of the first (and best) titles on the PC Engine, and was so big it had to be spread over two sepa rately-sold cartridges. It's still one of the best blasters on Super NES and Amiga, although strangely Megadrive owners are still waiting for their version. In the arcades, R-Type II never quite captured the attention of gamers as much the original, but Activision's Amiga conversion is still one of the best floppy blasters around. Super R-Type III is the first game in the series to be written for a home format first rather than to begin its life as a coin-op, so it remains to be seen if Irem's original work on Super NES is as good as its creations in the arcades. We're all very optimistic down here... If they ever make a list of the top ten best-known coin-ops of all time, it's a good bet that R-Type will be up there with the best of 'em. Inspired by 70s classics like Defender and Scramble, Irem's sideways-scrolling shoot'em up brought the age-old genre back to life and inspired a flood of clones and rip-offs but none that were anywhere near as good as the original. An excellent Super NES conversion and impressive coin-op sequel later and R-Type is back again, with a new look for '93 and a catchy new title Super R-Type III The Third Lightning, no less. Fear not, fans of the original Irem hasn't gone and done anything stupid like turning it into a 3D game or anything. It's the same leftto-right blasting action that arcade fans around the world have come to know and love, but in the grand tradition of sequels there's no end of WHO: 1Svd The title screen in all its glory. 125 "

AUTUMN RELEASE Your pants will fill while the leaves fall when you clock the fab stuff coming in the Autumn! FILA PREVIEWS Oleo 0 0 THE FALL SUMMER RELEASE The sun's gleaming and you'll be beaming! Check out this lot when the weather's hot! WINTER RELEASE Snow's belting down, but you won't wear a frown when you see what Santa could bring! SUMMER TECHNOCLASH GEOTECO MEGADRIVE gana SUMMER well as a few handy non-combat spells like heal potions thrown in for good measure. There are plenty of nice touches the player can choose between two computer-controlled \"bodyguards» to follow him on his quest over seven worlds and sixty levels, and there's an innovative \"living map\", where a magical falcon surveys the entire level from the air so you can check on the position of guards, objects etc. Technoclash is due out this August, and if we're in a good mood we might just treat you to a full review next month. .99 Oh dear. The future's not looking too rosy according to the scenario of Electronic Arts latest Megadrive blast. In the Gospel according to RELEASE Technoclash, all the poor humans can look forward to is an epic battle between the primitive human survivors of a nuclear war and the Engine Men, an army of walking technological terrors bent on snuffing them out. Yeah, it all sounds a bit Terminatorish, but in fact the feel of the game is a strange mix of high-tech sci-fi and dungeons 'n' dragons fantasy. The stars of the show. Turn those Engine Men into scrap at the junkyard. Battling with guards on the first level the casino. It's a bit like Mad Max meets Lord of the Rings. You are Ronaan, the human race's heroic last hope for survival. With a bagful of magic spells at your disposal, it's your job to herd the Engine Men back into their own dimension and destroy them. Basically, it's a blast 'em up with a bit extra, with the eight-way scrolling Gauntlet/Chaos Engine style action combining arcade adventure and puzzle elements to keep your brain as occupied as your trigger finger. The \"spells» are basically power-up weapons, with a few particularly lethal ones among them (check out the lightning bolt) as spends his days eating his way through the menu at various cafes and restaurants around the city, then legging it at high speed when the bill comes. But when he's finally caught, the owner of the restaurant makes him an offer he can't refuse rescue his only daughter Melody (recently kidnapped by the Mafia, conveniently enough) and in return eat as much as he likes for free at the restaurant not be refused. And so a new console hero is born and although there's no shortage of cutesy platform stars at the moment, this guy seems to have more going for him than most. Apart from Billy Whizz legs, Rocky has one important, and very bizarre asset in his battle against the mob his hairdo. Initially he sports a rather unfashionable skinhead, but by collecting cans of hairspray littered around the city, his dull locks can be transformed into a variety of outlandish and lethal hairstyles. His spike cut is so thickly lacquered it can impale bad guys and help Rocky scale walls, while his mohican cut can be removed and thrown at enemies Keep away from the angry chef with the cleaver. ROCKY RODENT SUMMER SNES  IREM ETBA Now this is weird. Rocky is, well, a rodent with a BIG appetite and a turn of speed that would put Sonic the Hedgehog to shame.

"Rocky can run faster than a truck fact. 02270M for more of the same platform fun that's made Pond a household name in the UK, with a few new twists based around the space-age setting. For a start, we all know the moon is made of cheese, so everything in the game landscape is a kind of diary product — there are rivers of cream, butter mountains and even ice cream at the North and South poles! And don't forget that there's not much gravity on the moon, allowing for giant jumps and, if you can find the magnetic gravity boots, the ability to walk on the walls and ceiling! Interestingly, Operation Starfish is being written first for the Amiga 1200 (which makes it one of the first dedicated games for the machine) to make full use of the 32-bit machine's top capabilities, with a cut-down A600 version to follow shortly after. And, of course, Megadrive owners can look forward to their version courtesy of Electronic Arts. Operation Starfish blasts off this Autumn, so keep 'em peeled in CVG for more info soon... We like the snazzy Flash Gordon vest, James. Take out the goo machine for eco-points. He must use more mousse than Paul Anglin! JAMES POND 3: OPERATION STARFISH OD FALL Thank heavens for McDonalds saving our planet. Dig that razor mohawk! like a boomerang! Well, we said it was weird. Although the preview cart has only been in the office for a few days, it's already got the CVG boys under its surreal spell. Rocky's one of the most original platform stars we've seen in ages, and Irem has steered clear of the traditional platform style, including off-thewall stages like an impressive chase sequence when Rocky pursues the Mafia as they drive Melody off in their armoured van. Rocky should be speeding onto a software shelf near you later this Summer, but you can look forward to a full CVG review next issue. That's if we can stop playing it long enough to write it... AMIGA MILLENNIUM  ETBA Console heroes come and go, but like Mario and Sonic, James Pond has proved he's here to stay After successful outings in the original James RELEASE Pond, the sequel RoboCod (reviewed on SNES this month) and the sporty spin-off Aquatic Games, the piscine secret agent has been brought back for his most dangerous mission yet by original creators Steve Bak and Chris Sorrell. In Operation Starfish, FI5H dispatches Pond to the moon, where rumour has it that the sinister Doctor Maybe is once again hatching a plot to take over the world, or something. So, the scene is set On the loony lunar surface. ZIEDOTETOROOON The moon IS made of cheese! GLOBAL GLADIATORS Dare you cross the river of slime? Gladiators have to do just that by you guessed it running and jumping their way through four environmentally-unsound landscapes including that ice world that no platform game would be without. Early impressions of Global Gladiators suggest that Virgin has done a top job of porting the Megadrive version onto the Amiga with no compromises and even improvements in some areas. All the original 1,250 animation frames that gave Mick and Mack their lifelike movement are in there, for example, along with all the enemies and weapons and a «groovependous\" musical score. (This is what happens when you let Gary Penn write your press releases). Here at CVG we're hoping that Global Gladiators will be a hit if it is, it might just open the floodgates for more console-to-Amiga conversions of the sort that Electronic Arts has been pioneering recently. It all adds up to good news for Amiga owners, especially since the Commodore machine proved it can do anything the consoles can when programmed properly. For the moment, though, look out for Amiga Global Gladiators in the shops and CVG next month.

"ALL FORMATS by ACCLAIM Iright, we've all heard the hype. But why IS A Mortal Kombat going to be even bigger than Street Fighter II, as everyone seems to be claiming? What's this game got that everything else hasn't? Why have we had to wait so long for it? And why can't they spell Combat properly? Gary Whitta has all these answers, and more... What is it that seems so appealing about breaking somebody's legs, puncturing their spleen and splitting their head open with a piece of wood so you can watch their brains spill out all over the floor? The truth is we haven't a clue, but what we DO know is that software houses have been coining it in for over a decade by selling you games that pander to your violent tendencies. Let's face it, you must like a bit of aggro to have bought over 6 million copies of Street Fighter II. Price TBA PREVIEW AUTUMN RELEASE Stage of Development 98% Completed MORTAL KOMBAT STREETFIGHTER KILLER 99 But with the game nearly complete and one of the biggest promotional campaigns the industry's ever seen about to begin, the question to ask must be \"What's so bloody good about it, then?\" And more importantly, what makes this better than the current king of the hill, Street Fighter Il? Gary Liddon, the man in charge of Probe's Mortal Kombat konversions, This is the guy you've got to beat the reckons he's got the answer. \"Mortal awesome Goro.

"SUBLEV Ouch! Liu Kang takes a lightning bolt in the head. SOFT OPTION SHHH! IT'S A SECRET As is traditional with blockbusters of this size, everything about Mortal Kombat has been kept as secret as possible prior to the big PR explosion in the months ahead only a few magazines have been granted sneak previews of the game in action (CVG included, of course), and our top spies are pleased to report initially, at least that the conversions are looking surprisingly good; the shots on this page ARE from the Megadrive version, not the coinop. We kid you not. Mortal Kombat will be released simultaneously worldwide on all formats on September 13th referred to by Acclaim as \"Mortal Monday\". According to Acclaim, it's going to be the only game to be seen with this Autumn, and if the finished product lives up to one tenth of the hype, they'll be right. But you know CVG-We don't like to count someone else's chickens before they're hatched, so we're reserving our official judgement until next month's review. Be there. You heard the man. 2635 62 Actually, it's worth noting that, while the coin-op features all this gratuitous horribleness, the home versions aren't quite so bloody not normally, anyway. In the game's default mode, the violence has been toned down, with no visible blood or death moves, so that people like Mary Whitehouse don't get in a tizz about it. But (and keep this to yourselves) if you input the secret cheat, you can switch to \"arcade mode\", which is every bit as bloody as the arcade original. That cheat's going to be hot property once the game goes on sale. P  PAST FORM Scorpion's harpoon move is a killer. MEGA SQUEEZE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION Wow, that girl can jump! TEST TA MIGHT For the Mortal Kombat project, Gary Liddon recruited some of the top proggers and artists in the the country to Probe's Dream Factory in Croydon and contributed some of his own programming expertise too. Liddon's personal past glories are many and varied; a former ZZAP!64 journalist, Liddon co-founded the successful software house Thalamus before working as a programmer in both the USA and Australia. He's now back on his native soil, however, and has since written such classics as Ricochet, The Last Ninja and Loopz. \"It's a puzzle game,\" says Gary, \"The puzzle being 'Why have I bought this?'» Mortal Kombat is Gary's biggest project since he's been at Probe almost as big as he is, in fact, and he's relishing the challenge of his next game. Which isn't about the Incredible Hulk. Honest. But hold on a minute let's not get carried away here. After all, the Midway coin-op is one of the most advanced on the market. Can the Megadrive really cope with the coin-op's digitised animation, sampled sound and lightning gameplay and come up with honours? Well, project manager Liddon is in a better position than anyone to knowhe worked at Midway's Chicago offices while the coin-op was being programmed, and knows both machines inside out. \"The coin-op uses the equivalent memory to a 64Mb cartridge for the graphics alone!» he says. \"Squeezing all them into 16Mb has been a real trial and we had to develop plenty of new programming techniques to make the dream possible.\" \"We're really happy it looks so close to the original,\" he goes on (Yes, he does-Ed), \"but more importantly we feel that we've got the playability spot on. The game code from the original was converted almost line for line, so if you're red-hot on the cart you can go down the arcade and give everyone down there a good pasting, too. I'd say the team that made this game possible is among the best in the country. Megadrive SFill is going to have to go some to come anywhere near the quality of this conversion!\" Players familar with SFIl should have no trouble getting to grips with Mortal Kombat or at least the basics of it. Select your character (there are seven in all, from the metal-skulled thug Kano and super-cool Johnny Cage to Bruce Lee lookalike Liu Kang and Sonya Blade, the kung-fu bitch), then proceed to knock the hell out of your opponent with a variety of kicks, punches and special moves. It's worth trying to find those \"special\" attacks that are hidden behind complex joypad techniques the hooded Sub-Zero, for example, is capable of firing a harpoon into his opponent and dragging him towards him for a close-range attack. Not pleasant. But it's the Death Moves that are most spectacular; with an opponent beaten senseless and on the point of passing out, you have a couple of seconds to perform a final finishing-off move that literally KILLS him or her in the most graphic manner possible.
