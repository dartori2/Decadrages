Originally born without arms in Super Mario World, Yoshi strangely sprouted stubby, vestigal steeringwheel gripping forearms in time for Mario Kart, before losing them again, as seen in Yoshi's Cookie and Yoshi's Safari. A leading dinobiologist says \"It's likely that the stubby arms seen in Mario Kart were merely Yoshi's milk arms, which dropped off to make room for his real arms in the career gap which spanned Safari and Cookie.

"CVG NEWS NEWS the wired-up gaming news section Sony gets ready to take Exclusive news of Indy 500 connecter 2... PLAYST BLAST on hardware games reaches the cvG offices and vets Sega as the some tantalising first pics. Michael JacksonVirgin release some well cool friendly & George games on their budget range, Michael unfriendly SEPTEMBER 29! while Interplay shows off some company launch the Sat and PSX launches... PlayStation! PlayStation September 29th is Play Day. Yes folks, it's official! Sony's biggest venture since the Walkman gets underway this month. Sony announced ambitious plans for its 32-bit entry into the console market, and that they hope to shift a stupendous 175,000 PlayStations in the UK in six months, and 1 million European copies inside a year. It's an ambitious game-plan, especially for a company who have no experience of the rigours of the console battlefield. Indeed Sega, who've fought against the best of them, are experiencing a slow uptake from the great British public, having sold between 7,500-10.000 Saturns(depending on whose maths you rely on) since its launch. Sony will lure gamers towards their PlayStations with prelaunch roadshows all over the UK, comprehensive press advertising and a heavyweight TV and cinema campaign. They also hope to capture lapsed users by promoting such events as club tours in association with dance magazine Mix Mag. Get hip daddy-o. Part of the PSX bundled disc is this T-Rex which was first shown to developers to demo what the machine can do, and it looks These are the demo stations coming to a retailer near you on the 29th! Join the queue man! "


"NEWS NEWS CVG SPANNER ALERT! For the more technically-minded (adjustable tool-boxes) among you, the 32-bit hardware boasts six processors working in parallel at 500 million instructions per second (MIPS), compared to under 200 million for the SNES and Mega Drive. It has 16 megabits of RAM, plus a further 8 megabits of Video RAM facilitating rapid loading of the games. The PlayStation's sound is, naturally, CD-quality, and it functions as a Sony-standard CD player. Some games even let you play your fave music tracks as you grapple with your joypad! s52 06/12 ATION OFF!!! GAME JUNKIES But what of the software, you cry? Sony claims to have the largest inhouse game development in Europe, as well as 400 third party developers creating games for the PlayStation too. These include such well-known names as Namco, Konami, Capcom, EA, Acclaim and Interplay, with many British programmers on the list also. The first batch of games to be released on the 29th includes such 3D blockbusters as the selfexplanatory 3D Lemmings, the slice-'em-up Battle Arena Toh Shin Den (first previewed back in the February issue), and a first-person perspective action adventure called Kileak the Blood. Jumping Flash promises to reinvent the platform genre with depth-cued 3D graphics and six multi-level worlds (more than the import version boasted), while the arcade simulation Ridge Racer will showcase the speed, graphics and impact of the PlayStation. Further titles to be released over October and November include the PlayStation's Discworld which offers enhanced audio, Mortal Kombat 3, Air Combat and CyberSled (all October), followed by Warhawk, StarBlade Alpha and Myst (November). WHAT DO I GET FOR MY HARD EARNED READIES THEN? Well, obviously you get your PlayStation, but unlike the Saturn, there'll be no bundled game. Instead, Sony are packing a disc which features six playable demos, a variety of non-playable demos and a graphics generator for use with your audio CDs. Games should knock you for about - a time, an extra pad should come in at around the  mark and memory cards for saved games will be in a similar price bracket. However, one inspired piece of judgment from Sony is to include both a SCART and RF cable. ova Sony have decided to use the bundled disc to market all the gobsmacking games they have lined up. This offers you the punter plenty of variety, but not much in terms of long term playability that you'd get with Sega's Virtua Fighter. "


"NEWS CVG NEWS connected CHEAP VIRGINS UP FOR GRABS GAMEGUN SHOOTS ON TO PC Virgin's second torrent of budget CD-ROM software has just been released following the success of their first assault on the 'cheapy' market. Last month saw Virgin's White Label range release Day of the Tentacle on CD and floppy and Star Trek the 25th Anniversary solely for CD owners, both at the bargain price of .99. This month sees the benevolent Mr Branson donning a Darth Vadar headpiece as the brilliant Rebel Assault Tie-Fights its way into the shops at the same ridiculously cheap price. To keep its nice shiny box company in the dark recesses of the shops Virgin are also releasing that futuristic gore-fest, Dreamweb, at the same 'much cheapness' price. Virgin promise more next month. Temele SYAIR TACK 23 ANNIVARSARY Calling all potential gun-totting psychopaths who own a PC. Your time is nigh. Yes indeed, all you potential Travis Bickle's out there in personal computer land can now aspire to the dizzy heights that your Mega-CD and 3DO compardrese have escalated to, with the announcement of a PC gun. No, it's not the ultimate deterrent against the errant night call of an IBM thief, but it is a lightweight, durable handgun that allows PC users to play their favourite shooting games without having to use the mouse. Running on the minimum of a 386, the Gamegun can fire accurately from up to 12 feet away from the video target and comes with a 'driver' that grants compatibility with such famous blast fests as Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog II, Who Shot Johhny Rock, The Lost Gold, Space Pirates, Crime Patrol and Drug Wars. European distributors Mirage have also launched the first Gamegun specific title, The Last Bounty Hunter. Shot on location on Western backlots used for such classics as Gunsmoke, you play, believe it or not, a lone bounty hunter chasing wild-eyed outlaws with the aid of your trusty sixshooter. The Gamegun comes bundled with Crime Patrol, a demo of The Last Bounty Hunter and retails for the gun-tastic price of .99. And actually it's very good. Anyone worried about frightening old ladies by brandishing this hostile piece of weaponry can relax, it's bright orange and looks about as hostile as an Opal Fruit lolly. Err, suck it and see. Above: What do we want? Cheap games. When do we want them? Now. And happy to oblige are Virgin with Day of the Tentacle, Rebel Assault and Rebel Star Trek 25th Anniversary. Good eh? SILVER SCREEN FOR SATURN WHAT'S Co Left: Don't worry about prolonged use of the Gamegun, this is only a computer mock-up! Scientists have proved that there's no way that users will ever have the same hair-cut. Psygnosis, one of Britain's best known games publishers, have been officially killed off (sort of). Following Sony's acquisition of the Liverpool based company in 1993, a decision has been taken to shelve the Psygnosis name after some 10 years of games development. Until recently the company responsible for some of the most leading-edge PlayStation software like Wipeout and Destruction Derby were known as Sony Psygnosis. Now they are to be amalgamated with Sony Electronic Publishing to become Sony Interactive Europe. Sega's first wave of TV advertising came under the public eye for the first time in a year this month when their Saturn ad trailered with Bruce Willis. The 60 second ad ran with Die Hard Ill for a fortnight during late August and will run with Steven Seagal's forthcoming Under Siege 2 this month. Running in conjunction with October releases like Virtuosity and Seven in October and Assassins in November, Sega believe that around 20 million potential buyers will see the ad. In addition you can look forward to a condensed version to run on TV from the middle of this month and another campaign of the full unabridged ad to run with a number of November's video releases. 10 "

The second we put the excellent Yoshi's Island down we get news of a new Mario title being developed for the SNES in Japan. Super Mario RPG is still in its infancy but these early shots show you that it's an isometric adventure where you travel around a vast land picking up items and battling with mad insects and monsters. You'll also have a number of sub-games to play and a host of characters to interact with on your journey. It's bound to be absolutely massive as long as they can keep that chirpy-sparrow barrow-boy Bob 'it's good to talk as long as it's not me' Hoskins a phone's length away (which we're sure they will).

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected INDIE 500 AND CASPER GHOSTS THE FATE OF SEGA ON TO SNES 16 Over in Japan SNES owners are having a chilling time as the 16-bit licence for Casper the Friendly Ghost goes on sale. Information is extremely limited at the moment, but as you can see for yourselves, it's an isometric adventure which follows the plot of the film as is the nature of a film licence. The coin-op war just gets hotter and hotter. In fact, there's just no stopping it. Sega's latest arcade offering, developed by Cool Riders developers AM1 (see page 74 for full review), is receiving top reviews in Japan and rapidly becoming known as the second Daytona. Indie 500 is set on the same oval shaped track as Daytona except that this time you compete against 30 cars travelling up to speeds of 380 km/h (that's about 230mph-ish to us who still. know what a mile is). Rumour is also rife thai indie 500 will feature a voice linkup allowing you to insult your opponents as you whizz by them. When will someone invent a 'virtua-flob option which allows you to spit at other punters? Well, wirually. Anyhow, look out for a full review in Videodrome as soon as Indie 500 arrives on test. 318 HULK Sega Rally might be swallowing your pounds at the mo', but Indy 500 looks well worth waiting for. | 19/28 INTO THE VOLLEY BALL More polygon sport from Japan, but this time in the gym. \"Virtual' volleyball is the latest 3D malarkey for the Saturn that'll feature lots of texture-mapped blokes jumping up and down in an attempt to make a texture-mapped ball hit the floor. You'll have all the normal camera angles to view it from and you'll have to agree with us that it looks pretty damn good. Let's hope we get a shot at it over here in Blighty. 25733 OUT! ERR. IN JAPAN ANYWAY COP THIS! 3D polygon gaming in the best Tekken tradition comes to the PlayStation in the form of Ground Stroke. This state-of-theart virtua' camera style tennis title takes sports in shorts to a new dimension. The characters come with a variety of virtual expressions, and, if you do really crap. your player will throw his racquet to the ground in disgust, great eh? If your polygon spazmo doesn't break all the racquets in the place then you can enjoy a variety of two player options and even a quick set of doubles. Ground Stroke looks great so let's just hope that it gets released in the UK. Oh yes, the boys are back in town and we don't mean Thin Lizzy or those steroid-quaffing nancies the Gladiators. Oh no, it's those boys in blue from Virtua Cop we mean. Yep, that's right another chance to roam around dodgy places with a light gun because Virtua Cop 2 is on its way. It's pretty unclear whose in charge of development at the moment, but these shots demonstrate that, while it's still early days, the amount of detail and overall interactivity of play will be greater than the original trigger-happypolice-go-bad-ass-polygon-zapping that we know and love. More as it happens. "

"VIRTUA CITY 24 Hou Virtua City a well of ten million souls, each of them as blocky and squared-off as a plate of oven chips. A place where cubism is a way of life, not just something to hang on the wall. Where even the cool guys are squares. Where especially the cool guys are squares. In fact, where anyone who isn't a square is in trouble. And we're the people you call when you're in trouble in Virtua City. Yeah, that's right, fleshies, it's the VCPDand you'd better start hugging that pavement if you wanna see another bright polygon dawn, scumpup. Yeah, I bet you gameteens think life in Virtua City is one long virtua drive through the leafy suburbs, don't you? Well let's get this straight doughboy life ain't no game when you're pounding the linear sidewalks of Downtown. You wanna see Virtua City? Yeah, we'll show you Virtua City, kid, but don't blame us if you come back one pixel short of a texture map. 2-322 Tilhenuine Sometimes when I go out to arcades, I stand behind a good player and watch him.

Where will the human race go..? Katsuya Terada, AM2 Background artwork  Eggmont Foundation. "


"VIRTUA CITY OUTSKIRTS — DAYTONA USA Daytona is probably the most controversial Saturn title on release at the moment. Is it great? Or is it pants? That seems to be the crux of the debate. Well we think it's great, and we'll deck anyone who says otherwise. Fair enough, it could have been more polished, the graphics might have been sharper and the sound well the sound might not have had any godawful singing on it, but we like it just the way it is. So much so that we awarded it 96% in issue 163. CONDITION ee 1/2 TRADES 30 133 Well here we are on the outskirts of the most polygonated conurbation on the face of the Earth. The wooded scrubland C2 lah AUTO which belies the youth of the town is dissected by uncharacteristically twisty turny roads. And it's here that the famous Daytona rally takes place. No, not in Daytona at all, but over the remarkably Daytona Beachlike landscape of Virtua City. Of course, Daytona hasn't been quite the same since the Saturn came along. Everything's a bit grainier and the cars don't perform in the same way. But it's still the number one favourite pastime of VC residents. That's thanks to the intelligence of the opponents and the speed and sheer gol-darn flickability of the game if you ask us. Fair enough, so the borders visible on the UK version of the game limit it to letterbox vision but quit whining you pussies, it still plays the same. And when we get bored of racing our cars around the track we saddle up our rendered horses and hit the trail. In fact, we don't usually even bother to clear the roads of other cars. Our 32-bit powered gee-gees can outrun one of your Earth sports cars any day. And it doesn't even matter if you prang the mother, thanks to its incredible binary wire-frame skeleton Virtua horses can withstand any impact. 230 km 4917, If you'd like to enhance your enjoyment of Daytona USA for the Saturn may we recommend that you steer well clear of the giant clunky Sega Steering Wheel, available from all unreliable and untrustworthy importers? Yet to appear in the UK this is a cleverly moulded controller in the shape of a kind of steering wheel/yoke thing. It's not a bad idea, and it doesn't destroy your game or anything, but it does feel a bit flimsy, and as such it's easy to oversteer. A bit of an expensive novelty. Or white elephant as they were once known in olden times. WOODS SEGA RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP Of course Daytona isn't the only claim to rallying fame we enjoy in Virtua City, oh no buster. If you care to move a little further off the path you'll find where the real dirt-track racers strut their stuff in the Sega Rally Championship. It's a harder race with tougher controls and a more taxing race environment, but thanks to the cuboid-bashing danger levels not so many lily-livered squarehearts enter the race, so there aren't as many opposing cars around as you'll find in Daytona. What's that you say? You wouldn't mind a go? Ha! That's all you fleshies ever say isn't it? \"Hey officer, hand me that Virtua gun, I'm gonna go waste me some blockheads!\". Well listen good punk, you try that on our turf and you're looking at a twenty stretch. Now get back in the car! 95m 033 93 0 3393 131 1 35 70 116 57 10'33\"93 la OBW95 \" 902022 DOO Sega Rally Championship has proved trés popular in the arcades thanks to its mix of technical realism with arcade-style car handling. The Saturn version currently underway (see page 26) promises to deliver all the gameplay elements which have endeared it to arcade-goers. But will those stunning big cars and sprays of mud and all that stuff survive the transition? Well the shots you here are only the provisional test graphics. Whilst most of the polygon frames are finished the final texture mapping is still to be added using the new SGL graphics library. And it should be compatible with the two-player link-up cable. Or that's what Sega of Japan reckon. And we're sure they wouldn't lie. 4 139.00 @=623232 2.45 90 1.2707 23 867 CO3 VIRTUACHY 15 "


"VIRTUA CITY THE QUARTER VIRTUA FIGHTER REMIX Okay buddy this here's where things start getting ugly. There's this annual martial arts tournament held in this part of town. And tonight it's a grudge match between this race-driving Jacky guy and his sister who's been brainwashed by an evil crime syndicate who tried to assassinate him once before. Only he doesn't know that, and you better not tell him or you'll ruin the plot continuity. Try to act natural it's a newly texture-mapped crowd, so you'll probably fit in so long as no-one sees your lips move realistically. Boy would you have been in trouble if this was last year's bag. Those ninja blockheads don't take kindly to strangers. There's not a lot new on offer this time around. Apart from looking prettier it's the same scene for us old-timers, boy. 160 PAYPT PRONNE CENNY We Brood Type o Hobby Karaoke SG 0310 Virtua Fighter Remix is, play-wise, no different from the old Virtua Fighter Saturn owners will be used to. But that's not the point. The point is that it's been bloody texturemapped, ain't it. And the rather tatty character portraits have been replaced with stunning inked efforts by virtua artist Katsuya Terada. It shows off the machine a lot better (in fact it's now the bundled game in Japan) and makes the game more enjoyable if you're the kind of shallow game-slut who goes for graphics. Although they haven't confirmed it yet, Sega could be releasing this mid-October. AVERA BUND 062 CITY STREETS VIRTUA RACING Han 2 L Okay, time's moving on and we've got a beat to pound. What say we drop you off at the Virtua Stadium? Japan are playing Brazil today and hey! Where does that guy think he's going in that go-kart? Must be one of them damn urban Virtua Racers heading for the bridge. No damn respect these new Virtua Racers. Not like your old Formula 1-only drivers. These new Saturn rich kids have five different cars, from those pesky go-karts through to stock racers. And texture-mapping that's what they want on their backgrounds nowadays. No wonder this city's in such a goddam mess. Yeah, and they've got this new Grand Prix where they compete using each vehicle. Everyone from the 15 teams who wins a race goes through to the next round with a faster machine, racing on the seven new tracks they've devised. And as if that wasn't enough they've gotten hold of a helicopter so's they can get aerial fly-bys of each track before they start, so they know what to expect and can anticipate difficult corners. The gets. START Handled by Time Warner Interactive and not Sega themselves, Virtua Racing should be an interesting Saturn conversion to watch. Instead of just converting the basic and now superseded) VR coin-op TWI have opted to adapt the concept to the limits of the Saturn. The fact that the cars are still polygon only means that the Saturn can shift everything faster than any of its competitors on Saturn or PlayStation (apparently). It also means that those clever programming types have been able to add a split-screen two-player mode the first game of its kind to eliminate those 'I need a mate with a Saturn and a portable monitor' blues. Hopefully there should be a full review of this little number in a very soon CVG. SETE B22 POSITION 99 o "


"VIRTUA CITY VIRTUA STADIUM VIRTUA STRIKER Well here we are kid, the Virtua Stadium in all its angular glory. Given the importance of Virtua City in the world sports scene it's only fitting that all the big international soccer matches should be held here. And anyone who says the Virtua Striker tournament isn't important gets a hot polygon slug in the mouth. You think it takes hard work to make a great human player? Try doing it with polygons man that's maths. Twenty-two fully undulating shorts-clad players hot-footing it around the pitch, all tracked in real time and playing their positions as you'd expect. The only difference is that all the international teams are automatically handicapped on entering Virtua Stadium, so they're all of a roughly similar level. Beats me why you fleshies can't do that. dup depos Bei AUGUHE WICERIA While Virtua Striker is undoubtedly a massively ace soccer game it's still unclear as yet whether AM2 will deign to release it on the Saturn. It might be difficult for the console to handle all the players at the same time without reducing the polygon count. But then again, we reckon they will. After all, texture mapping can do wonders for otherwise sketchily constructed characters. As it is right now the only way you'll get to play Virtua Striker is to visit a decent arcade. Something we'd thoroughly recommend, as this is a particularly fine example of the genre. 1P ARGENTINE 22 BRAZIL ABOVE THE CITY WING ARMS So how was the game, bucko? Didya check out those waving polygon flags in the crowd? Pah! Bet you didn't even notice them you no-good gamesnik! Well look in the air are those WW2 warplanes noticeable enough for you? Yeah, that's the Wing Arms guys doing their stuff. What's that? Isn't it dangerous having madly swooping airplanes dogfighting over the city? Shrapnel's just a way of life in this neighbourhood. If you don't like it buy an umbrella. And what are you complaining for, this is the closest you're going to see to a conversion of the Wing War coin-op, we left that sort of stuff behind in the old Model 1 days with Star Wars. You get just as good a selection of planes, and these mothers have the new texture-mapping too, not like the red and blue efforts of yesteryear. Hey, watch out for that dead pilot! One of the most hotly anticipated Saturn titles at the moment has to be Wing Arms (previously features in this mag under the name Mystery Plane because we didn't know what it was). It's based on Wing War, one of the earlier Virtua efforts and also one of the best coinops released last year (like anyone noticed it even existed). Apart from the quality of the graphics (brilliant) and the speed of movement (flipping fast) it also plays bloody well. We've got high hopes of this being a real killer title. More info next month.

"VIRTUA CITY BACK IN THE QUARTER VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 Okay, seen enough? No, well then you better try coming on the night shift with the Virtua Cops. But seeing as it's on the way back to the pound anyway, why don't we drop back in on the Virtua Fighters again. There's a new tournament going down with a couple of new characters we're still checking out. Not everyone's in it yet only Lau, his daughter Pai, Jacky, Akira the ninja and the new dudes Shun the decrepit alcoholic and Lion the young smart guy have made it into Tournament 2 as yet, but everyone else should be ported over within a month or so. There's a lot of new techniques on show and everyone's costumes have been jazzed up no end. And man is there a lot more strategy in their pugilism now. None of this tappy-tappy punch-and-block sequences anymore, you bet your butt. There's a counter for every combo and a combo for every counter. You'd better be sure of yourself if you want to try and get in the ring. Okay skinboy, this here is our patch. Downtown, where the polygon perps hang out. They're the ones wearing black suits and shades carrying machine guns in case you're wondering. The only language this filth understands is Virtua Gun speak, and we're just the guys to talk dirty to 'em. You're in luck, this here's our Saturnday, so there should be more to see. What it is yet, we're not sure, but we've been warned to be on the alert for non-coin-op elements. All we know is to aim for the head shooting the arms or legs of a villain still only debilitates them, and we want them DEAD. Here, take this unconvincing pink handgun man and start a-shootin'! 33 Definitely the most eagerly anticipated release for the Saturn has to be this here Virtua Fighter 2. They said it couldn't be done (they said it, not us) but it looks very much like AM2 have pulled it off, thanks to the new polygon-friendly Saturn Operating System 2 (SGL OS2 to the initiated). AM2 are concentrating on getting everything moving at the same speed as the coin-op rather than going all-out on the graphics, but even in these shots it's hard enough to tell the difference between the Saturn and arcade versions. All the features of the original should remain intact, along with special Saturn-only improvements and of course you'll be able to play as Dural, if you're good enough to find out how. DETS 18 "


"VIRTUA CITY WHAT SAY AM2? The production head of Virtua Fighter 2, the sinisterly-named Mr Okayasu, recently spoke to big-kahuna Japanese magazine Famitsu Express about the development of the Virtua Fighter 2 coin-op. And now you, the British public, can experience the full wealth of his knowledge. Q How far into development is VF2 so far? A We've just about completed all the characters and the data for their techniques. There's no scoring technique [collision detection on the characters CVG), but you can move the characters and produce their techniques. we have also completed the thinking routines of the computer. And we've also completed on winning pose for each character. These are hot off the press! The camera work and replays are yet to be done. Things will get tough from now on. I WAS LI huic A It's because there's so much data. For example, if we didn't have to consider the speed of the game CVG] we could do the conversion very quickly. But with so much data we can only move slowly. With Virtua Fighter 1 we could use the arcade data for each technique with just a few changes, but with 2 there's just too much data. But we have done well, though how is a secret! O How did you actually perfect the speed? A It's simple. We look at the program we've made and cut out the unnecessary bits. We look again to check... this is the main kind of process. Of course, we have the know-how from previous experience. I just don't think we could have made 2 if we hadn't made the first work. But it's just as tough! We owe a lot to the new SGL OS2 software. WHEN AND WHERE Pencilled in for the earliest release of any of AM2s conversions, Virtua Cop is nearing completion. It'll be compatible with the regular Saturn joypad (obviously) and you could always use the Steering Wheel Controller of Doom if you feel like it (although it's not something we'd recommend unless your arms swings on ballbearings). But truly the best way to enjoy the game is with the Sega Gun, a rather sexy-looking piece of kit which is an almost exact replica of the ones found attached to every self-respecting Virtua Cop arcade machine. The guns will be ridiculous colours over here because of our strange replica gun laws (ie they can't look realistic), but only the terminally fashion-concious should care. Of course this means you might not be able to get a nice black Sega Gun if you've got an import Saturn, or you'll be arrested if you do. Still, them's the breaks eh? So you've read about all this exciting new software, but when's it going to come out? Well most of them should see the light of day in Japan by the end of the year. But officially? Read on...

"PREVIEW  2 PUNCH DRUNK! One of Tekken 2's new moves is the devilish implementation of punches and kicks that are so powerful that they obliterate your opponent in one savage blow.

Namco's new System 22 arcade board helps to do stuff like Law's new costume! TEKKEN 22 "


"PREVIEW DOWN BY LAW Err, it seems a bit unfair but Law's moves now allow you to beat the opposition up while they're down. Hey, we know it seems a little rough, but we don't make the rules and you never know she may have deserved this, well-ish. hen we first saw Tekken we were totally totalled, never had a beat'em-up game so impressed the CVG crew or, for that matter, delayed us for so long from what we should have been doing. Such was the power of Tekken that grown men turned down beer in favour of a joyous bout of polygon pummelling. Lovesick adolescents ignored the doe-eyed advances of their sweethearts, preferring to gaze at the bone-crunching animations that followed a special move, and most curious of all, docile pacifists openly morphed from 'ban the clenched fist' types into twisted halflings addicted to fresh blood and ritualistic self-abuse. Well as if this bout of insanity wasn't bad enough, those workaholics in Namco's Research and Development department have gone and done the impossible improved the original Tekken. Be warned however, all these creamy shots of Tekken 2 came from a development machine that's only 60% complete and the PlayStation version, while a dead cert, won't be released even to Japanese gamers until late Spring '96. Never fear, though, because if you want to play on the best fighting game since the birth of fighting thingies, then come early autumn, you'll be able to fight until your heart's content at your local arcade. ISOLER A PROPER FISTING Here King demonstrates to great effect that two fists are better than one. 23 "


"PREVIEW CVG PREVIEW BACKDROP-KICK OK, so it's not the best heading in the history of titles, but it's better than 'Tekken 'em all on' or some other such dribble, and it conveys the message quite concisely that all the backdrops in Tekken 2 have been changed and improved to make the characters feel more part of it. Jack-2 gets K'Oed by Jun's splits. NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK Tekken's winner from the first tournament was Kazuya. His winnings bought him a life of idling around, gorging on chocolates and swilling beer from a really big bucket. Unfortunately, they also gave him a huge belly and thus he was unable to fit into his texture-mapped pants and fight. So for Tekken 2 Heihachi, the horned boss-man, joins the fray along with two totally new fighters. Lei's the guy with the flick hair-cut and a master of Chinese fist-fighting, while Jun spends her nights practising her limbtwisting Aikido moves. Newcomer Lei gets a good kickin'. *LOO NEW BLOCKS ON THE KIDS In the first Tekken your characters had only one way of blocking attacks. In Tekken 2 you've got the choice of three high, middle and low. These not only make things feel more realistic, but add depth to the game as well. YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND Law's spinning kick's demonstrated here to full effect. Plus take a look at his nice new outfit as he performs yet another hernia inducing kick. "


"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG ROLL ME OVER AND DO IT AGAIN In the original Tekken you could roll forward or backward in an attempt to avoid the savage blows inflicted by fellow fighters. Now your characters can also roll sideways to avoid a painful confrontation. Just time for a quick sit down then. The weird looking masked geezer's still here. 2 TEKKENZ 25 "

Providing you're good at driving, otherwise you'd probably just get yourself stuck in a hedge, surrounded by inquisitive cows. Someone from Sega in Japan obviously thought long and hard about this while watching the Lombard RAC Rally on holiday in Blighty one day, and hey presto Sega Rally was born. It was definitely the Lombard Rally, because it also occurred to them to set the course in slightly more exciting locations than Stoke. Put simply the Sega Rally coin-op is the closest thing you can get to actually driving a Kevin Furry-Dice dream car at top speeds without killing yourself, especially if you select manual gears and have to contend with almost all the real tribulations of operating a motor vehicle. And now, you lucky dogs, a conversion is underway for the Saturn.

And hey! if only Sega don't go and give you a choice of four! Actually, it doesn't. It gives you a choice of two in either automatic or manual transmissions.

Their colossal physiques, their badly animated body movements, the habit they have of creaming whole armies at the tip of a hat... yes, the secret is out! These people are actually living videogame sprites, created by a conspiracy of movie directors circa 1975. Think about it: would real parents christen their sprog Stallone? Or Vanstereotypes or nuking military Damme? And as for dictators. A fully animated 3D Schwarzenegger.... model in a 3D world, he's shot At least Lone Soldier doesn't from behind (ouch) and loaded pretend to act, and you won't with bazookas, grenades and find him waving his rude bits in other goodies. 'The Italian Stallion'. No, he's Lone Soldier's got his work just a common-or-gar cut out, though slogging den megahero, never through miles of jungle and happier than quick sand, dodging snipers and when vine traps, and negotiating a machine tricky ravine or two. Add to that gun rivers, forests, a Middle Eastern ning city (plus army) to take out, and racial throw in an alien invasion force that's come to join in the fun. Lone Soldier's rock-hard... O OOO 30 "


"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG 99COMMANDO-DO Lone Soldier reminds us of the old coin-op classic Commando, except this time it's all 3D and most certainly a product of 90s technology. Just take a look at these tasty pics: Didn't we see this gravel-pit in Doctor Who? TO 099-8 That's a lot of carnage, even in four multi-level scenarios. The folk at Tempest promise lots of lifelike action or should that be deathlike? as you chuck grenades at the enemies and watch them reach escape velocity. Also expect swooping camera movements, nifty character spot effects and the now predictable cartoon interludes. Everywhere he goes, Lone Soldier kicks bottom. NOT FORGETTING... Lone Soldier is only one of the upcoming releases from software publishers Telstar. Here are some other titles you'll ache for in the next few months: Havoc: Race futuristic vehicles on land, underwater or in space, dodging traps and trashing opponents. Fable: Cross worlds of Earth, Wind, Fire and Water in this fantasy/sci-fi adventure. Star Fighter 3000: 50 missions await you as an ace squadron leader in this strategy-action game. 31 "


"PREVIEW CVG 23 FX APPEAL One thing the Scavenger team have cracked is special effects. We're always the first people to say 'gameplay over graphics' but we like special effects and fancy extras as much as anyone, and Amok looks as though it will come packed with them. The two-player mode looks like a laugh. AMOK BONBS Developed by...Scavenger GREENBERE Released by...... Sega Out.. . December 70%. complete 32x version planned No other versions available Samok The status window takes up a lot of room, doesn't it? Ooh, different Virtua view.points. \"Never seen that in a game before. Oh no missus. I used to know a kid in school called Amok, well, Armok, but it's almost the same. IF THERE'S ONE thing the Saturn's really lacking it's a decent shoot-'em-up. While Raiden's on its way, it's not a game most people would regard as typical Next Generation stuff even if it is bloody good. So enter Scavenger, a bizarre amalgamation of Finnish and American program ming talent who are the real y rising stars of Sega's 32-bit operations. Last year they were responsible for a set of mindblowing 32X demos and this year they're about to burst on to the scene with Amok, the first genuine Next-Gen shoot'em-up for the Saturn. Amok is by no means a run-of-the-mill blaster. While there's a nice selection of giant robots, tanks and bases to zap, there are also legions of giant waspy things and diddy little blokes who prove no match for your giant stomping robot suit. After seeing Scavenger's 32x demos we're expecting a hell of a lot from this game, and on the surface it looks as though they're going to deliver As well as adding depth to gameplay through a variety of missions which varying objectives (shoot this, rescue that, etc) they've thoughtfully included a split-screen two-player mode and not taken the easy option of relying on impending link-up cables to do the job. After all, when a machine's new, chances are you'll struggle to find a mate who owns a Saturn let alone another copy of the same game. If Scavenger do come up trumps with Amok, they'll be well on the way to becoming one of the hottest development outfits next year. It's a lot of pressure on a relatively new team, but the rewards could be really huge. "


"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG STITUT T ILES BOMBER? ! HUESILES OS More metal mayhem head-tohead. MISSILES G TEESILI EOMBS PAINT IT BROWN Driving a giant robot suit across an enemy-infested landscape is a little more challenging that careering down the M1 in a Triumph Dolomite, For a start there's a lot of extra controls and fiddly dials and things, although it doesn't get stuck in neutral and the radio can pick up more stations that just Capital Gold. IDUNHORNED MIESILES Below: A little fat bloke heads towards his ultimate doom. Dumb, isn't he? This isn't a muggy shot, it's just one of the game's special effects. 33 "


"PREVIEW CVG ASSAULT RIGS Developed by:.....Psygnosis Released by........Psypnosis Out ..............November '95 55% complete PC version planned No other versions available PLAYSTATION JACKANORY.. It's the future. While Michael Barrymore dies on the set of Cybermarket Sweep and his autopsy reveals him to be totally composed of soft fruit and small furry mammals, networked games have reached cult status and are massive business. Huge corporations sponsor contestants to fight it out in virtual arenas in charge of tooled up 'Assault Rigs'. Millions of punters log into the net to watch the cat and mouse battles between competitors tooled up to the eye-balls. Which is just as well because the system itself is full of traps and defence units and it'll be your turn, soon. Snazzy World War Il tanks like this one are available for your amusement on some of the levels. Psygnosis just can't stop producing games. This time it's large cybernetic tanks batting it out in a virtual arena. Blimey, they've come a long way since Brian The Liosi. 123rios reckon the Psyggies are on to another winner. HANDS UP WHO'S ancient enough to remember the old Atari 2600/VCS system. Not many hmm. You know the one we mean though, that teaky wooden thing that looked like a cross between a Hammond organ and an air-conditioning unit, but had less power. It was the kind of thing you expected Rolf Harris to stroll up to, stroke, and say \"And it plays real good tunes too!\", before whipping out a thin metal rod and breaking into 'Telstar'. The point, if there is one, is that Atari's piece of late 70s technology had one of the most playable two-player games bundled with it, Combat. Combat was simplicity itself; two tanks, two players fighting to the death in 2D. Now Pysgnosis, inspired by the concept, are updating the idea for the 32-bit market, and of course, adding a bit of their own no-how. Assault Rigs will feature 40 texture-mapped 3D arenas for you to battle it out in. Each level has its own theme, whether it be a Tron inspired VR level or a WW2 tank battle where V2 rockets rain down. Although it's only just over half finished the majority of the powerups, traps and secret passages are in place. And, having had a good old mess around on Assault Rigs, we A Bang! Eat my lead you strange thing from a virtual dimension you! On our left we have your choice of tanks. What'll it be? Heavy, medium or light. This has got to be the sexiest tank of the lot with its groovy patchwork quilt-type effect "


"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG Assault Rigs will feature a wide variety of views for you to fight from. HOLAE IT'S ALL CRYSTAL CLEAR NOW Just like old baldy-chops ex-of that crappy Crystal Maze program, in one-player mode you have to drive your big tank around in search of crystals. Collect enough without taking a pasting from the opposition and you can move on. A Hey, if I go to Tronland I want a tank, not a poxy motorbike! A Iced Gems or a PlayStation specialeffect when you drive over a crystal. Ha-ha! Check out my cybertank chics. See that windmill on the back, I got that from Halford's. This little guy could easily pass himself off as one of those lovable little Micro Machines. TUE Hey, isn't that Nintendo's Virtual Boy? OOH, RUBBER BULLETS Talk about re-living a genre. Just like in the classic 70s Atari game, Combat, your tank has a range of odd weaponry including those classic bouncy bullets. Retro or what? Can we also assume that Psygnosis are jiving around their offices in pear-drop collars and flares while chewing a Spangle? 35 "


"CVG BREVIT PREVIEW You get a whole host of close-ups of vacant eyed homocidal maniacs in D. Developed by..........Warp Released by..........Acclaim Out...........November 95 85% complete No other versions planned 300 versions available It's time to do a ScoobyDoo and wander aimlessly around a haunted house with D on the Saturn WHAT IS IT ABOUT attractive young women and old dark houses? | mean, any sensible bloke wouldn't pass the front door without arming himself with machine-guns and a few decent lightbulbs, but your average babe saunters in without turning a hair. Usually to get her head chopped off in the next scene. Unless she's Lola, that is, a rock-hard supernatural investigator who's about to appear on the Saturn version of the 3DO adventure 'D'. As in the original, Lola has to explore a sumptously animated 3D-perspective mansion, keeping her peepers open for assorted death-traps and trying not to step in too many dead bodies. (Always remember, just because they're dead doesn't mean they've stopped moving.) The game promises cuttingedge full-motion video animation, some of the grisliest graphics ever seen on the Saturn and (probably) a 15 or 18 certificate. Spoilsports! A Alright sexy pants, wanna come to a disco and have a snog with me, or are you to wrapped up in this macabre murder mystery? GORE BLIMEY! Remember the fuss the tabloids kicked up over \"Mortal Kombat', with its lovingly detailed scenes of slaughter? If that was anything to go by, we reckon the hacks will have a field-day with 'D', with its numerous piles of gutted corpses smeared in tomato ketchup. Fans of bad Eighties slasher movies should feel right at home... Pint of AB, anybody? It's a bit like Murder She Wrote without that fat old slapper. 36 "

With the V-Boy you're stuck with the your head is positioned right next to them you get maximum sound volume with minimal output. The Virtual Boy is possibly the most irritating console to watch someone play. It's not like a Saturn or spectacle IN THE RUSH OF ALL THINGS Next Generation, most people seem to have forgotten about Nintendo's first console release of since the SNES. There are two reasons for this. First, the Virtual Boy might not be granted an official European launch, and second, while the tech-nology is quite novel the Virtual Boy doesn't have any sexy Silicon Graphicslike visuals. But the big surprise is it's actually a pretty good toy. The Virtual Boy, despite its crimson mono screen, is a 32-bit console. And why does it need such hardware to shift red sprites? Because the screen has roughly 120 layers of 'depth', that's why. This means sprites can be scaled into or out of the screen with very little effort, and as most of the 3D routines are handled in hardware you end up with a more convincing effect that you'd expect. The headset screen adds to this by excluding all vision except the monitor, immersing you in the game environment. There are two speakers at ear level on the headset and since THE HEADSET The Virtual Boy looks like a regular VR headset, but it's mounted on a stand. Apparently Nintendo were forced to add the support to prevent people from wandering round the house wearing the Virtual Boy, falling down the stairs and suing the company. There's a nice squashy rubber visor to prevent light getting to the (backlit) screen and to give you something to rest your face on. There are also focus and contrast controls so you can tune the machine to a non-eyestraining personal perfectness, to find that the Virtual Boy is pretty nifty, has a great 3D effect and already a number of playable games to support it, but unless you're a bit of a rich kid/hard-working wage slave you might be better investing the money elsewhere. someone gazing into what looks like a seaside pier telescope while listening to the Walkman-headphone-leakage sound emanating from the red unit.

Now for  it would be a perfect Chrimbo present-type time waster, but at twice the price, well you're talking proper console priceage. At CVG we're surprised Red Alarm is a sort of wire-frame Starfox. The joypads rotate or slide your craft around 360 degrees in the direction you press. The object is simple negotiate warren-like technotunnels blasting the bits out of wire-frame alien machines. The feeling of depth and space is amazing not a game you could produce on a 2D machine. Luckily, there's not much to let Red Alarm down.

"REVIEW CVG REVIEW PLAYSTATION RACING PSYG/SIE .99 BOWL OVER The Bowl sounds like something from a Hollywood prison drama. \"Any more trouble out of you Sternhouse and you're going to The Bowl\", that sort of thing. But it isn't. It's the name of one of the play areas in Destruction Derby. It's a big round patch of dirt, but the games which take place there are most exciting. Basically it's stock car racing at its most unhinged, as the cars smash each other to bits. There are two ways to play. One where every automobile is after you and the object is to survive for as long as possible in the name of high-scoring. The other is more every-man-for-himself-esque and has an intriguing points-based score system. You score for causing cars to bash into each other (thereby avoiding impact damage yourself), and spin around (360s good, 720s better) and even more for combining the two. If you don't quite get the idea just pop down to your local council estate after pub closing time and pick up some tips from the local joyriding boy racers.

We all had to ride these unsaddled rabid hell-donkeys around the scabby playing field for charity. I was first out of the pack, and in the lead up to the first corner. Then this fat hard kid knocked me off and I got trampled on the head by every single one of the other mules. I came to just in time to see the last (unseated) contestant hobbling over the finish line, and then had to run around to the end, concussed and in pain, in full view of all my assembled schoolmates. And their families. And the rest of the town. Now that's what I call a destruction derby. It signalled the destruction of my reputation, my self-esteem and my hopes of future professional donkeyriding glory. Ultimately the psychological damage to my ego led me to entering the delinquent world of computer games reviewing whilst the eventual winner is no doubt now a Successful financier or something.

And also something which happens to cars when they smack into things, which happens a lot in Destruction Derby. To reflect this fashion in re-sale diminishing, Psygnosis (or whatever they're called this week) have equipped every car with a damage meter. This measures, in tones from green (healthy) to red (knackered) the amount of a bashing each area of your wheels has taken. Once a car region has been completely depleted it blows up which could mean the loss of your lights (not so bad) your side panels (pretty fatal) or your engine (complete and utter doom, game over time). If glancing at the bottom-right corner of the screen is too much like hard work for you don't fret it's pretty easy to tell how shagged your motor is just by looking at it. Junctions are the trickiest hazards. 945-501 RUN OVER A FRIEND Got a friend? You lucky dog. But what about a friend with a PlayStation? And a copy of Destruction Derby? And a swish monitor? And a real car to carry it all round to your house? Well if you can answer \"Why yes! But how could you know?\" to all these questions Destruction Derby has something special just for you. With the aid of a simple link-up cable you can go head-to-head against another Destruction Derby player in any event. An example of how not to overtake. VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE (BUT NOT) Virtua Racing started all this cameraangles nonsense, and at the time lots of people came out with rubbish like 'It's like having four different games, what with four views and everything' and 'That first-person view is just like being there, and is completely different to all the other views', which as any sensible games fan knows is nonsense. But it's a clever idea, and most genre members have copied it, Destruction Derby being no exception. It's crunch time! Ha, ha, ha. 720 "

PLATFORM.. SEGA .99. OUT NOW If he was the only bug in the world and I was the only foot, I'd probably tread on 'im, by mistake of course. or me it's nylon sheets and scratching your toe nails on them, for Mark it's people leaving dirty washing up water in the sink and for Rad it's when we borrow his CDs and put the wrong CD back in to the wrong box (though that one bugs me as well). So that's what bugs us, but what's bugging Sega at the moment, apart from fledgling gamers Sony, is in fact Bug. Yes they've gone Bug! mad down at Sega HQ, as they're hoping that this critter is going to be one popular little platform hero. Or heroine. Or green invertebrate. What we have in Bug is, like Jumping Flash, a new perspective on the platform genre as instead of running along the screen as you would with the Sonics and plumbers of this world, you actually run into the screen. There's a massive 3D environment which means you can see in the distance (so to speak) the rest of the level (well, not all of it as each level's quite huge) and there's lots of other clever little graphical touches that Bug! springs on you which makes you think, that's very Saturn. For example when Bug runs up a vertical bit of the platform your view of him change accordingly so that you basically see an aerial view of him. Bug! is stuffed full of everything that you would expect from a platformer: power-ups, lots of enemies: giant grasshoppers, little spiders, mad bees and some tricky muthas at the end of each level which will keep even the most dextrous of gamer scratching his head.

"REVIEW CVG REVIEW VERDICT. SCORES I AME SATURN Sega US have come up with a formidable platformer in that, unlike Rayman, it makes proper use of the Next Gen machine's graphical capabilities and uses a proper 3D environment. There is also a huge game in here with a plethora of power ups, well drawn characters and lush backgrounds, numerous game routes and some ingenious bonus rounds. My only reservation is that the game doesn't have an immediate hook, you really have to sit down and play it for some time before you become enthralled and begin to really enjoy it. GARY LORD RIHRANERARI REKRE SECOND OPINI SATURN Although Bug! didn't have the same impact on me as Sonic when we first got our hands on a Mega Drive, it's still a bloody impressive game. The graphics are a little too basic in places, but compenstated for by the magnificent bosses. Obviously it's the 3D aspect of the gameplay which makes Bugl so different from everything else. It's uncomplicated, absorbing, challenging and unique. Four things that you rarely see in games these days. MARK PATTERSON JUMPING FLASH BUGI RAYMAN. You know when you're on holiday and there's always that buzzing insect noise. Well that's cicadas that is. Superb rendered characters and imaginative worlds. ANIMATION.

Still, we get the feeling we won't have to wait mcuh longer to see him on Saturn. You'd think with mince pies like 'is that he'd be able to spot any trouble up ahead and take evasive action. HE KNOWS HOW TO MOVE... Well you would hope so because Bug himself has 300 plus frames of animation, in fact he makes Earthworm Jim look possibly static.

"BR 11:26 In British football we sing silly songs at the opposition. But the Japs just make daft ninja noises. FLEVEN PLAYSTATION he world of football games takes another twist as the first of the PlayStation's efforts is released. Konami's soccer sensation uses some highly stylised, but odd-looking shapes to create its players. So odd that last night I had a dream-like vision... The team stumble at half-time, 5-0 down and there's about to be a rollocking when I realise that none of the squad possess any eyes. It's then, glancing down the tunnel, I see 11 little polygon white sticks propped up against the wall. Panicking, I turn to look at what was thought to be a championship winning side, to find all 11 angular players fumbling around the changing rooms grasping for slices of polygon orange with badly deformed triangle hands. Then there's a trickling sound beside me. This trickle is then accompanied by a friendly bark and the warm appreciation of a polygon Labrador waiting for its master to recover for the second half while urinating little golden triangles all down my own polygoned manager's leather trenchcoat. Oh no, we're all polygons in a kind of Bertie Bassett polygon world! Then as it suddenly goes dark the realisation spreads that I haven't got any eyes either. And all this because of Konami's Winning Eleven and 32-bit gaming.L FOOTY SIM KONAMI IMPORT OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS UK VERSION PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE Some of the player's movements (like the bloke running) don't look realistic. STORM WARNING! No this has nothing to do with Dogger or German Bite, we just thought we'd tell you what Konami are doing for the UK version which they're calling Goal Storm: 1) A pitch scanner. 2) Fully controllable action-replay. 3) 36 European sides with accurate kits. 4) Commentary in a language you'll know 5)  cheaper. When the goalie kicks the ball he sounds like a Virtua Fighter. 62 "


"| REVIEW  REVIEW MATCH OF THE DAY Every time there's a New Generation of machines you can expect a whole rook of footy games. We thought we'd give you a little insight into what you can expect on the PSX before too long. (SCORES When you score a goal the players all run around like wildebeest. er den TOTAL ROLES ELITE ON-SIDE This number boasts multiple camera views, various pitches and different weather conditions, and it's going to have a management mode bolstering the arcade action. GREMLIN INTERACTIVE ACTUA SOCCER Gremlin's foray boasts plenty of pitches, weather conditions and views. It also uses motion capturing to make the players look realistic. PLAYSTATION Winning Eleven was a surprise result in many ways. We thought W11 was going to be pretty average and a little uninspiring, but it's quite the contrary. Okay, so it has its little flaws like a few dodgy ways to score, but on the whole it's competent. The graphics are effective, especially when the camera zooms in. there's plenty of animation to keep things fresh, it plays very well and you can score some pretty spectacular and diverse goals. My advice though is to wait a couple of months for the official UK version with all its extra little enhancements. SIMON CLAYS WINNING ELEVEN FIFA (300)... VICTORY GOAL. GRAPHICS Snazzy stylised poly. gon fellahs with detailed kits. ANIMATION... NAMCO J-LEAGUE PRIME GOAL Namco's arcade footy title looks unusually lame for the standards Namco normally insist upon. However, the version we saw was way off completion. A little strange considering the players are motion-captured. a 0-0 MUSIC Decent overall. apart from the supermarket background music. SOUND EFFECTS. 82 SECOND OPINION PLAYSTATION The beauty of Winning Eleven is its playability: getting the hang of the controls is easy and the whole game moves so smoothly. The game's main drawback is that it's on import and you have unfamiliar Jap teams and commentary. Put that factor aside and you'll thoroughly enjoy this excellent footy game. The players move realistically, there's plenty of moves (overhead kicks, sliding tackles, crosses, headers) awaiting to be discovered and it's nailchewing stuff when it's nil-nil after extra time and it's penalty shoot out time. GARY LORD PSYGNOSIS POWERSPORTS Not too much is known about the Psyggie's footy title apart from that it looks really nice and should be up to the same standard as their recent releases. Sounds like a cross between a kung-fu movie and football. GAMEPLAY 85 Immense fun, despite the odd bug or two. VALUE Save yourself  and wait for Goal Storm to come out. OVERALL Considering that WE was developed for the Jap market it's very good. It looks good and feels good but wait for the UK version. THE REFEREE'S A POLYGON! 108 Hey, in Winning Eleven you can't afford to foot-up with the ref. No sooner do you Tony Adams some poor bloke and the ref's over brandishing different flavours of cardboard at you. And don't think you'll be able to get around him by looking sheepish. 63 "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW Five months on and Discworld has proved itself to be one of the most popular PC games this year. But will console owners be as smitten? DISCWORLD AT PLAYSTATION ADVENTURE PSYGNOSIS (ETBA OUT OCTOBER ONE PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED PC CD-ROM VERSION AVAILABLE This bloke's the University's Arch-Chancellor. here hasn't been a series of books like the Discworld novels since Douglas Adams decided to wipe out the Earth in the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. Although it's grossly unfair to compare the two series, simply because Terry Pratchett's Discworld books are just so much funnier. Like Hitchhiker's, the Discworld books plagued the best sellers' list until a nice man with a big cheque turned up to nab the licence. This resulted in the PC CD-ROM version earlier in the year and now this the PlayStation's first English adventure. In an all-expenses spared conversion, Psygnosis have ported the PC original direct to PlayStation, pausing only briefly to re-master the sound. In fact, if memory serves (and it often doesn't 'cos I'm getting old), this is probably only the second true point and click adventure to appear on console with the other being Monkey Island on the Mega-CD. But we don't talk about things like that now. In the meantime, trust us when we say if you're one of the legions of raving Discites or Discettes out there, you'll love this game. The voice characterisation takes a little getting used to, as does some of the character graphics. But there are plenty of familiar locations and situations, even if the plot is drawn from several of the books. fa PlayStation Discworld's graphics are all drawn in a stonking 256 colours. 64 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVE THESPIAN RIGHTS! SCORES PlayStation conversion aren't anything we haven't Like the PC version, the graphics in the seen before, and have been completely surpassed by games such as Full Throttle from LucasArts. What is does have though, is an all-star cast of Brit actors (makes a change). Lining up in front of the microphone are such names as John Pertwee, Eric Idle and Tony Robinson. Not exactly at the level as Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox, but they get the point across well even if Tony Robinson sounds like Baldrick most of the time. VERDICT. PLAYSTATION As with the PC version, my only criticism of Discworld is that you spend a bit too much time listening to dialogue rather than actually playing the game. But it is a good game and that's what counts. The humour frony the books translates well, although a lot of the descriptive comedy can't be translated into a game. The graphics artists have had a bloody good crack though, making full use of the licence and turning what could have been an average adventure into something a bit special. MARK PATTERSON It's Rad. It iiisss. Really. Look at the arms. 0940MISIO FULL THROTTLE... PRISIONER OF ICE GRAPHICS.. OTHER VERSIONS PC CD-ROM... Colourful, well animated and with a sense of humour.

SOUND EFFECTS. 93 itaw The speech really helps set the atmos. phere. GAMEPLAY. It's big and it's tough. Novices might struggle. VALUE The game's plot is cobbled together from various books. Currently this is the only PSX adventure game around. OVERALL A fine adventure. Perfect for ex-PC users who've converted to consoles. GUARDS! GUARDS! Much of the game's dialogue, settings and characters are ripped straight out of the first six Discworld novels. Fans will probably recognise them, everyone else had better be prepared for a surprise. 65 "

And this time they're in 3D! Hooray! LEMMINGS C3 1 Silh EI 21 am Lemming and I am many. That's what the Bible would have said about this game if God was writing it nowadays. Lemmings truly are the emissaries of Satan. There's loads of them, they all look exactly the same and they all follow their orders mindlessly, doing exactly the same thing unless they're told otherwise just like Legion, the servant(s) of Lucifer, if our rusty primary school Scriptures memories serve us correctly. So if that's true, and it probably is, this title casts you in the role of Beelzebub, the fallen angel (a bit like Darth Vader who used to be a nice chap). Your job, aside from scaring the crap out of religious folk, is to guide your little helpers down through the earthly planes to the portal of Hell usually found at the bottom of each level. Woah heavy trip, ecclesiasticly speaking. Is the gaming world ready for such theological responsibility? And how ideologically sound is it? I mean, if you're actually leading the retreat of the devil's forces back to their homeground, fine, but what if this is all part of some preparation for Judgment Day? Is this the sort of example we should be setting Our Kids? Oh well, it's only a game. Or is it? (Cue spooky Twilight Zone music). Check out those scary steps. 09 3 scary steps.

Well obviously you don't need us to tell you what a difference Next Generationism has made to the Lemmings format. You've got eyes haven't you? You'll already have clocked the title, seen the screenshots and come to the right conclusion. But this 3D idea has more to it than you'd think. With a single press of a button you can transform yourself into a Virtual Lemming, VERDICT PLAYSTATION The thing with Lemmings is you either love 'em or hate 'em. No-one ever thinks 'Ooh, I'll just have a go at a couple of levels and then go to the shops'. It's either all-out all-night Lemming-rescue or complete anathematic revulsion. That's the thing with Lemmings 3D. It's harder than normal Lemmings and it takes some time to get into, due to the new camera angles. But at the end of the day it isn't going to convert anyone.

"PREVIEW TOH SHIN DEN 2 ARCADE ACTION Way before the game comes to the PlayStation in the UK, Toh Shin Den 2 should be hitting the arcades, much in the way Namco did with Tekken. So anyone too poor to afford a 32-bit console will still be able to play the game. Keep an eye on Videodrome for more info and the location of the first test machine. Developed by.........TAKARA Released by........SONY Out.............Dec '95 (JAP) 70% complete Coin-op versions planned No other versions available PLAYSTATION Come September 29 you'll all be playing Toh Shin Den. Probably. While we'll be checking out its sequel 'cos we're ace and you're not. th shinen 2 BAYIN HERE ARE THE exclusive first pics of the rather splendid looking Battle Arena Toh Shin Den 2. Apparently it's scheduled for release in arcades as well as on the PlayStation, although whether this is a Jap-only arrangement or not remains to be seen. The basic game mechanics look vir tually unchanged. It's still a oneon-one 3D combat title with swords and spikes and whips and all manner of other martial artstype weaponry. The old cast and crew from the first title, due for official release very soon, have returned, this time with smoother-looking texture mapping and (it would appear) more polygons to their physical make up. There's also a couple of new additions to the cast, principal among these being a giant face-painted barbaric warrior-looking sort with weird Elric-y armour and a massive sword the likes of which you will never have seen before in your life. The basic assumption here is that he'll be the end boss, but as it's early days production-wise that's just an educated guess. This is very new news indeed, so release dates and any real game details are sketchy at best, but hopefully the Japanese team will take a hint from the Brits and leave out the skill-spoiling singlebutton special moves which meant any old gimp could win a match with enough flailing switch-bashing. This is all there is to see as yet, but (furious touching of wood) we should have some firmer information (along with more lovely pictures) in next month's issue. Or the issue after The two fighters blundered around the arena wildly, vision obscured by their floppy fringes. This man is a collection of polygons. Do not try this at home, kids.

The world is threatened by killer toads don't laugh, these things are more deadly than Jeremy Paxman. You are a Battle Beast, a cute 'n' cuddly animal who can morph into a heroic armoured warrior (as you do). As well as taking out the toads and their revolting Toadman leader, you have to fight several Battle Beasts who've been converted to Toady's, cause. What all this boils down to is a wacky beat-'em-up as you and your assorted foes fight through war zones linked by a maze of sewers. You have a choice of six characters, each with their own strengths/weaknesses and 100-fight moves apiece. Said moves include roundhouse kicks, reverse sweeps and upgradable weaponry look out for the hidden arsenal and bonus rooms. After six fight scenes, the winning player progresses to Toadman's lair for a crack at Warty himself. Flee. Flee through the maze of madness Kill the battle beasts. Get lost. Have a picnic, then wait for your mother to come and rescue you. SCORES GRAPHICS VERDICI PC CD-ROM Battle Beasts is one of those rare games which combines the cartoony appearance of Space Ace or Dragon's Lair with genuine playability just about. If you're going to be picky, the gameplay feels a tad sluggish at times (partly because the characters, though great to watch, move slightly jerkily). The fighting moves also take some get ting used to, particularly if you're using a keyboard. That said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning, with oodles of sight-gags that'll have you chuckling at the screen throughout. Beat-'em-up fans should lap it up, especially in two-player mode. ANDREW OSMOND HEADING A picture's worth a thousand words, particularly when it's as good as the ones here. Battle Beast boasts over 8,000 frames of hand-drawn animation, digitally painted by the guy who drew episodes of Ren 'n' Stimpy and Beavis 'n' Butthead.

"ARCADES You lucky sods you. This month we review the first versions of Rave Racer and Alpine Racer from Japan to hit the Western world. Yes folks, these games are as fresh as the proverbial lurking dog poo that has just slipped warmly from its spasming canine owner into the camouflage of the long summer grass. Read on and careful where you stand. VIDEO Rave Racer Rave on! Driving Sim  per play Namco 1-2 Players (Comms link could make that eight) When Ridge Racer first arrived on our virgin shores it shocked the public. Its graphics completely blew Sega's Virtua Racing off the track and, in all its varying forms, it set new standards for coin-op gaming. Things have never been quite the same since with all the key players attempting to outdo each other in the games equivalent of the Sixties superpowers space-race. Not that we mind of course because us gamers have been able to gorge ourselves on a torrent of succulent gaming morsels ever since. Namco's freshest prime-cut is the latest extension to the Ridge Racer series, Rave Racer. But what can Namco add to Ridge Racer? We hear you immediately scream above the shrill screech of psychotic children eager to pump their parents' hard-earned cash into a potential clone rip-off. Well, before anyone thinks about smelling the dubious odour of a rat, let us reassure you that practically everything about Rave Racer is totally new. Even the original 'city' track has totally revamped graphics and a thumping new sound track to beef it up. But while the enhancements, like a faster update and absolutely no visible clipping, are impressive on the city courses, the proof of the gaming pud is in the new mountain track Hard is an understatement. This course is riddled with tight bends, for the main part is only three lanes wide and also features a totally new aspect to Ridge Racer the ability to drive off the edge of cliffs and drop 50 foot in a kind of Milk-Tray bloke-in-a-blacktight-knit-sweater-type-way. Except, you don't get some nice chick 'cos you gave her fancy chocolates for risking your life. No, you lose vital time for being a dill and crashing your car off a precipice. Rave Racer is a great addition to the arcade racing experience. Not only does it look far better than any of the other Ridge series, but it plays much better and has an absolutely thumping jungle and trip-hop soundtrack. Both the link-up and the solo options are top fun and will bring out the true road-rage experience in you from the comfort of a 50-inch screen.

Although your car moves faster and sticks like glue to the bends using the manual box, this is only productive if your timing and line's spot on.

Skiing is no longer a sport limited to divorced royals, hanger-ons with bizarre association to the fifth Marquis of Fartbury, or the stupidly rich with a dresssense by-pass operation. Oh no, now those of us not clad in a glorified shell-suit and antiglare nipple gloss can ski until our little hearts are thoroughly content, courtesy of Namco. Yes indeed, it would seem that Namco can't put a long slat of wood that's been polished with some greasy stuff wrong at the moment because they've actually managed to convert the sport of rich prats successfully into a videogame. The skiing or rolling down a hillside wearing two planks of wood, depending on how good you are, takes place over two events. Mimicking top British athlete Eddy the frozen turkeyeagle you can challenge five other downhill racers to a 'first over the line' competition, or go it alone skiing through the gates against the clock. As with most other Namco products you can select to play at varying levels of difficulty, can race against different classes of opponent and we assume (because we didn't get that far before we died of hypothermia on a frozen slope) access some secret course or other although it's probably not reversed like in Ridge Racer SPRITES ANIMATION REALISM PLAYABILITY V cpu MULTIPLAYER 18 92 19 72 "

While your skier doesn't actually fly A over T and get polygon icicles all over his texturemapped snowballs, he does do a nice line in gymnastic tumbling if you hit a tree or something as equally abrupt. The good thing about simulated skiing is that you don't get slush down yer trousies. LOOK MA NO HANDS! That natty red thing you can see on the shot is your means for controlling the skis. Using the sticks to lean your weight on, the two red foot paddles swivel from side to side depending where you direct your weight. The harder you lean on to the edges of the paddles, the tighter a turn you'll pull. It sounds rather bizarre, but mimics skiing very well and feels quite natural. GATE-CRASHER! Hey, if you don't fancy racing against polygon Austrian blokes then take up a touch of slalom and weave your dizzy way between flags down a frosted hillside. because that would mean skiing uphill! Play also features some rather speedy shortcuts on the tougher levels, some very heavy snowfalls and even a polygon freezing blizzard for you to contend with. Playwise, Alpine Racer is revolutionary. Not only does it look amazing but it also utilises a completely different method of control than joystick waggling promotes. Obviously you still need great hand and eye coordination to follow the best line, but the skill is in the balance. This game will appeal to gamers of all persuasions. But we suspect those who are pretty nifty on a skateboard will be particularly good at this and perhaps savour it a tad more. Alpine Racer will hopefully encourage Namco to use this engine on other snowy type tities. Hopefully there's not much chance of a Torville and Dean simulator, but we might get a snowboarding title or perhaps even a bobsleigh game. 73 "

Sega's Cool Riders works on the same premise as that old classic Outrun. Set against the clock, Cool Riders competitors have to reach checkpoints and select a route. But rather than in Outrun, or more recently Nintendo's Cru'sin' USA, you don't just travel from one side of America to the other, you circumnavigate the world in a kind of Hell's Angel's, nose-picking, litter-dropping, generally-crude, Around-The-World-In80-Days type fashion. Obviously, any serious self-respecting, dandruffshaking bike freak's gonna want the biggest hog on the street to compete on, but strangely the bikes in Sega's oil-'em-up vary widely. From Mods to Moshers there's something for everyone's taste. As you journey around such bizarre locations as Polynesia and the Aussie Outback you're accosted by the locals. For example, while Cool Riders is principally a racing game, when you tank through Hawaii there's every chance that a Great White shark might leap up from the depths. Likewise, there's equal opportunity for your hapless rider to get a hitchhiking Koala from the Outback clinging to you. Cool Riders features some nice digitised backdrops, a thumping range of sound samples and a pretty quick update, but that's about it.

Good news for everybody who loves playing arcade machines but doesn't want to hang around in a gloomy, smoke-infested sweatbox while big kids hassle you off the machines and nick your bus-fair home. No it's not a free big gun to blow dem punks away with, it's a whole new concept in theme parks that's set to change the face of arcade gaming in the UK. The Namco Wonderpark on Great Windmill Street in London is the second of Namco's arcade theme parks to illuminate the streets of the UK. The other casting rays of sunshine are on steely Sheffield. Obviously Namco are more than a little experienced at knocking these concept parks together, having the Wonder Eggs theme park in Tokyo and the Aladdin's Castle site in the States. The  million site boasts a clockwork brass robot who welcomes visitors and a giant steam powered fish that, well, does fishy type things in a very large way. But the real stars of the show are the games themselves and to endorse the concept further all the titles are divided up into areas that reflect their particular style. For example, in the driving area an eightplayer Ace Driver sits next to a full size Ridge Racer complete with Mazda MX-5 and wraparound screen. The other great thing about the park is that Namco's research department test all their latest projects there, so you get the opportunity to play the likes of Tekken 2, Rave Racer and Alpine Racer months before they hit the streets. And don't fret that this cool park's in London and you live too far away, because Namco have plans for similar parks in every major British city. Inspiration for the UK's parks come from Namco's Wonder Eggs and City parks. London's Wonder Park boasts four player Cyber Cycles (above), and an amazing eight-player Ace Driver (below). Left: The giant steam-fish looks the part, but tastes crap with salt 'n' vinegar. Below: Namco's giant footy star. Above: The carnival area is ideal for baby's first gaming experiences.

Can't you just dig those cartoon exclamations! here's nothing like a novel idea to sustain interest in a games machine which has now been superseded. Nintendo manage it with the Game Boy and the likes of Picross, Donkey Kong Land and Wario. And the reason the Big Nin have been able to do it is that these games have a degree of individuality, plus they're great fun and full to the brim with gameplay. Sega now has to do like Nintendo, seeing as the Saturn has arrived and the pressure's on the Mega Drive to come up with something to excite the now lowly 16-bit market. Luckily they've found it with Comix Zone. OK, basically it's a platform beat-'em-up and is not dissimilar to the likes of Acclaim's Wolverine, but it's such a great idea... You play the comic's artist, Turner who is (think of Tron, but this time it's a comic rather than a game) pulled into the very comic strip adventure he's been drawing. He has to beat his way through each picture, fighting off robot-like guardians, hooded ninjas and scorpion-like giant ants. To aid Turner through the strip are various hidden power-ups which restore life or turn him into an all-powerful superhero. 78 "

Then of course last year the game came to console, unfortunately it came to the jaguar and PC Mega Drive 32x, and although they were excellent conversions, not too many people owned those machines compared to the huge number of SNES owners out 32X there.

VERDICT SNES Doom on SNES is a veritable carnage of blood, bullets and guts, that is as frenetic as it is addictable, and the only qualms I have about the SNES version is why did it take so long to come about, that you don't hear enemies firing at you you only hear their effects), and lastly that at 60-odd notes it don't come cheap.

Realising the distress this rumour-mongering could cause my fans, I thought it was time to make a personal statement to set the record straight. It's true that I began my career in games without arms. But the apparently sudden appearance of my diddy little hands in Mario Kart was not the result of cosmetic surgery. The species of dinosaur to which I belong grows arms in a similar way to that in which your Earth antelopes and mooses grow antlers. First, during dino-youth, stubby little arms develop just below our necks. These strengthen constantly from tyranno-puberty onwards. We use these arms in the summer mating season to thumb-wrestle for mates, like deer with their horns. Then, once they've fulfilled this purpose, the arms drop off, ready to grow again the next spring. Which is why I haven't got any arms in this game either. And as for how I can lay eggs if I'm a bloke dinosaur, as a leading dinobiologist asked in the front of this magazine, well that's just as simple. Anyone who's seen the film Jurassic Park can tell you that dinosaurs can change their gender to balance boy/girl deficiencies. Hanging around with Mario has obviously left me with very few opportunities to meet dinosaur babes, and as a result I've become some strange sort of hermaphroditic mutant arms/no-arms dinosaur hybrid from hell.

Pop one out of Yoshi's rear and it'll follow him around, with up to five buddies, until called into use with a press of the A button. This brings the aiming cursor onto the screen, which arcs from straight ahead to directly above Yoshi and back again until stopped with the L or R button. Press A again and off fires the embryo (unless you use Lor R to reaim). One hit with an egg is enough to destroy most foes, and also draws floating bubble-bound Mario a short distance towards Yoshi in emergencies. "


"REVIEW 1990 60?? BE \"CVG VERDICI SNES It's easy to forget in this 32 bit climate just how groundbreaking and stunning each Mario game has been. Yoshi's Island is the perfect reminder. The graphics use the SNES' hardware capabilities to great effect, with lots of scaling and rotation warping the primary. school felt-pen ambience. And the sound's great. The gameplay is superb. Yoshi and Mario have so many abilities all essential to progression it's almost obscene and the levels throw up an equal number of challenges. This is easily the most difficult Mario title yet and the most playable too. Buy it, or kill yourself. RAD Christmas has come early as red and green Santas hinder Yoshi's quest to protect Mario. (Right) Eggs, eh, how do you like 'em? Sunny side up, scrambled or littering your fave Mario character's world. If it's the latter then YIsland is for you. The use of the FX2 chip makes doors and draw. bridges look very effective. SECOND OPINION THROUGH THE KEYHOLE Despite not having any arms Yoshi is an expert at turning keys. In fact, it's his favourite hobby. Which is useful, as (providing he's collected the hidden keys) there's a number of secret doors to unlock. And behind each of these secret doors is a secret bonus game. These battles pit you against an evil Koopa representative in a match of skill. The events range from the simple bursting balloons and collecting coins to the tricky (a memory-match game with an exploding water balloon as a booby prize) via the action-packed, embodied in the triumphant watermelon seed spitting duel. SNES Even to this day I rate Super Marioworld as one of the finest games ever created and I still go back to it even after completing all 96 stages. But Yoshi's Island is really something else. It's totally fantastic and in my opinion almost as good as Marioworld. Then I'm a real spanner when it comes to nostalgia so I'll never admit to any SNES game being better than Mario's first 16-bit outing. What I will say though, is that this is one of the top five SNES games of all time and you'd deserve a good beating for not buying it.

In Asterix and Obelix you control either of them as they wander the world, helping their friends and thumping all and sundry. Fighting scurvy pirates. Traversing slippery mountains.

In its favour, though, it plays pretty well and there are levels aplenty to give you either pleasure or pain plus there are numerous locations to explore, some with multiple routes through them. The programmers have clearly done their homework, with the characters and backdrops capturing the classic strip perfectly. A good licence and a well-made, albeit unexceptional, game.

Top Cat, he was the leader of the pack, but now the pack's getting on a bit... ong before the Power Rangers came along, in fact even before the likes of He-Man graced our humble SCART-socketless TVs, back when Space Invaders was state-of-the-art and Doctor Who was hi-tech, nerdy kids made do with more innocent entertainments. Entertainments like the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, which fell into two categories: the cool ones and the crap ones. In the cool corner were Top Cat (him of the Phil Silvers voice and live-in dustbin) and Hong Kong Phooey (without doubt the greatest superhero in the history of the universe). In the crap corner were all the others: remember Snagglepuss, Quickdraw McGraw or Huckleberry Hound? Nope, neither do we. Turbo Toons the game does though, and it unites cool and crap in a running game where up to five players can compete. Each player controls a different HB character, each of which has different running attributes (speed, balance, etc.). To hamper the competition, just bounce into them and leave them reeling. There are several play modes including four racing leagues of ascending difficulty and a special 'hunt the crystals' challenge. Over 30 track layouts are available for your delectation, most of them accessed by pass codes within the game. TURBO TOONS GRAPHICS ANIMATION. MUSIC VERDICI SOUND EFFECTS.. 58 GAMEPLAY 69 VALUE. OVERALL Al thought we could have all the characters, like, floating. SNES Turbo Toons has the look of a junior game with its bright colours and pint-sized characters, and play doesn't do much to remove this impression. To be fair, the rulebook claims the game's best with a maxi mum five players (linked via a Multi-Tap adaptor, not included), whereas we could only muster two in this office. The main problem is that the single-screen races feel fiddly and restricted and there's not much sense of challenge (no imposed time-limit, for example). If you regularly play games with a bunch of mates then it's worth a look for a bit of multiplay mayhem, but other than that then I think I'll pass.

Only one of these things is represented in ISS Deluxe. And you can breathe easy, because you're not going to be subjected to follicular horrors or a chorus of I Can't Dance by Genesis. But if you're a joypad jessie you might not breathe easy after all, because the overall silkiness level of skills has improved considerably since the none too shabby original.

MR CAN'T WRITE PROPER Dear CVG I'm sick of all these people who keep on saying \"who cares about the graphics it's the gameplay that counts.\" Well all can say to that is... (censored). I have recently dumped my SNES as I am planning to buy a Next Generation console. The major reason for me upgrading is the graphics. After playing Ridge Racer, Daytona, Virtua Fighter and Toh Shin Den I just can't face my SNES' graphics. Although playability is important, I'd rather have my SNES than a Jaguar or 3D0 any day. The point I'm trying to make is that graphics and sound are just as important as playability, but you want good sound and graphics when you're paying -400 for a console. Andrew Spiretos, Leeds This month's topics are: Is new technology too pricey? Virtual Reality good, bad or sad? Why aren't programmers funny? Reasons why Liz Hurley should go out with Mark. PS Why do you slate the Saturn? I found Daytona far more playable than Ridge Racer. CVG Sez: A) You should learn how to communicate properly as all you've done is contradict yourself and, B), We love the Saturn and if you bothered to read our review of Daytona you'd have found that we liked it a lot more than Ridge Racer.

Gameplay and gamestyles do change, for instance Mario Kart on the SNES couldn't 120 be done on a Mega Drive because it used Mode-7, so 3 34 likewise the gameplay will change on these new consoles.

I saw that it was going for  with a copy of Virtua Fighter, one pad and a SCART lead. Horror struck me. My TV is fairly modern, but doesn't have a SCART socket, so I asked the bloke in the shop what I'd do if I bought a Saturn. He said for  he could sell me a PAL conversion lead from Sega. So I phoned them myself and they said would need to send them the SCART lead and  in exchange for a PAL cable. Major rip-off. But down at Tandy I saw that they had a SCART conversion set that only costs .99. Be warned Sega fans, don't go to Sega for your PAL lead. It beats me why Sega didn't bundle a normal Mega Drive-style lead in the first place. Richard Noon, Walsall SEGA SATURN CVG: Who knows?

"HELP CVG HELD SNES STUFF Dear CVG, 1. At the moment I own a SNES with two pads, Smash Tennis, NBA Jam, SF2 Turbo, NHL 95 and Donkey Kong Country. I received my SNES as a present last Christmas so it's quite new. Now want to sell it but don't know how much to advertise it for. What do you think? CVG: No more than  would be about right. Unfortunately second hand 16-bit software and hardware isn't worth much these days. 2. How much will the Sony PlayStation retail at and is it worth it? CVG:  and it is worth it. 3. Which new console's best? CVG: The PlayStation's specs are superior, but you choose a machine on its software, and most of our fave games are on the PSX at the moment, with a few Saturn games coming a close second. 4. Will the Satellaview ever be released here? CVG: Probably not, more's the pity. Paul Lawrence, Bolton MODEL LOOKS BORING CRICKET INFO We've had enough of being mauled down in the lion's den, so us good Samaritans at CVG are taking a break to exercise our brains instead of our legs. How are we going to do that? By answering all your hardware and software problems of course. Mind you, we're finding it quite tough to reply considering we've now got bleeding stumps where our arms once were! Dear Help!, Please, please could you answer my questions about the 3D0 as I plan to buy one soon. Thanks a lot! 1. Which 3D0 is the best machine to buy, because the Goldstar version is  cheaper than the Panasonic one? CVG: Not any more it isn't, they now both retail for . The only differences between the machines are cosmetic so go for the one you think is the best looking! 2. Are Quarantine or Creature Shock any good? CVG: Quarantine isn't bad, but Creature Shock sucks somewhat. 3. I intend to buy Wing Commander 3, The Need for Speed and Return Fire first, which would be the best games to get next? CVG: Theme Park, Cannon Fodder and SF2 Turbo X. 4. Do you think the 3D0 can survive with the Saturn and PSX about? Do you think the M2 will improve 3DO's position? CVG: In its current guise the 3D0 looks a little shaky but the M2 certainly has the power to keep the 3D0 bandwagon rolling, it just depends on whether 3D0 can keep the price of M2 down or not. John H Rolfe, Norwich Dear CVG, Could you please answer the following questions about the Saturn, as I'm getting one soon. 1. Is Premier Manager 3 or any other soccer manage, ment game coming out on the Saturn? CVG: We don't know of any soccer management games being developed for the Saturn at present. 2. Is there going to be a cricket game on the Saturn? CVG: Unlikely at present. Most Saturn software is sourced in Japan or the USA where cricket isn't exactly the most popular sport in the world and so wouldn't be commercially viable. Perhaps when the Saturn is more established an English softco like Codemasters might consider converting Brian Lara Cricket to the system. 3. Is Sensible World of Soccer coming out for the Saturn? CVG: Not as far as we know but it's rumoured to be heading for both the PlayStation and Ultra 64, with enhanced graphics of course. NG   peab 12 min 100 "


"HELP HELP CVG KILLER QUESTIONS PS GAMES Dear CVG, Please could you answer these questions. Thanks! 1. When is Killer Instinct coming out on SNES? CVG: September 22. 2. Do you think the 32X will do as badly as the Mega-CD? CVG: Yep. 3. Will the moves for Killer Instinct and Primal Rage be the same on the SNES as in the arcade? CVG: More or less. 4. How much will the Ultra 64 cost in the UK? CVG: Nintendo haven't said yet but somewhere between -300 seems likely. 5. My friend and I both think MK3 is really good but find the idea of being able to give someone energy back when they are almost dead a bit stupid. What do you think? CVG: It's cool. What better way of humiliating someone than beating them twice in the same round?! 6. Is it safe to use adaptors for US games on SNES? CVG: Hmm, bit of a debatable one this. Technically the answer is no as it puts more pressure on the SNES' innards but we do it all the time at CVG and have never experienced any trouble. We do know people that have however, so the decision is yours, as they say. 7. My friend Rob says that Sonic will come out on the Ultra 64. Is this true? CVG: YES! And you read it here exclusively! Doh, wake up, of course not! Richard Firth, Cheshire Dear Help! 1. What would you buy out of Ultra 64, Saturn and PlayStation, taking the wait for Ultra 64 into consider ation? CVG: Well, we haven't seen a finished Ultra 64 so it's impossible to answer your question properly. We're sure the Ultra 64 will be awesome but at present judge for yourself on the software that's available. 2. If I should happen to buy a PlayStation without a game, what are the first three games! should buy if I want one fighting, one racing and one 'other' game style? CVG: Fighting: Tekken, Racing: Destruction Derby and Wipeout (they're both too cool to choose between!) and 'other': Jumping Flash. 3. Do you think Namco will come out out with a sequel for Tekken? CVG: They already have. Tekken 2 is out in the arcades now and should be released on the PlayStation either at the end of the year or the start of 1996. 4. Do you know if there are any good RPGs coming out on PlayStation? CVG: Arc the Lad looks quite good, although it may be a little statistics and text heavy for some. Christian Adam, Seychelles 01:03., LEAGUE WOME SATURN THE FENCE Dear CVG, Your mag is brilliant. I've just bought a UK Saturn for a steep . So could you answer these questions for me please? 1. Is the UK version of Victory Goal better in terms of gameplay than the Jap version as I heard it was crap? CVG: You heard right. 2. With the AM2 boys bringing Virtua Striker to the the arcades I was wondering if a Saturn version will follow? CVG: No plans as yet, but Virtua Striker seems a definite for conversion to the Saturn before too long. 3. Have you seen anything of Virtua Fighter 3? Is so, does it look good, and are there any new fighters? CVG: We haven't seen anything yet but chief AM2 bod Yu Suzuki is quoted as saying that it will be some thing very special. 4. I want to buy a PlayStation but do you think should wait until the Ultra 64 comes out before deciding? CVG: Oooooooh... Listen right, the PlayStation is very, VERY nice indeed and there's no reason why you shouldn't buy one this instant. However we won't moan if you sit on the fence and wait for the Ultra 64 as it does look very promising indeed. If you can afford both then buy both, if you can wait for Ultra 64 get a PlayStation now and if you can wait for another year then you'll be able to make a much better decision then than we can right now.

Weighing in at 63kg and measuring 175cm on our very big ruler he is one of the best characters for the simple reason that he has a plethora of attack moves. If you're really good at this game then you will have noticed that this guy can pull off some extremely damaging combos. So, you're gonna get Toh Shin Den on your new and spankingly brilliant Playstation eh? Well, for all you rock 'top of notch fighters out there you'll be pleased to hear that all those easy one-button special moves on the Jap version of the game have been taken out of the Anglo PAL Toh Shin Den.

"TIPS TIPS CVG 4200 4410 KAYIN 43 KAYIN  KAYIN COMBO 2 This combo will help you out if you're in trouble and your energy bar is flashing red. And it goes like this: Jump in or walk into your opponent and then: P, K, K, (F, FD, D, DB, B, DB, D, DF, F+High Punch). The combination described in the brackets is Eiji's finishing move and when combined with the combo described above can take away a third of your opponent's life guage. BUT REMEMBER THE FINISHING MOVE WILL ONLY WORK WHEN YOUR LIFE GUAGE IS FLASHING RED! He's aged 22, weighs only 64kg INNON and is 178 cm tall. Strangely enough, even though his name doesn't sound American, his accent is positively Yankee-doodle! He too is one of the better fighters in the game, in fact he is the Ken of the game and Eiji is the Ryu. They both have very similar moves and so logically you can use the same combos interchangeably. So let's move on and see just how much polygonbashing, virtual pain-inducing troub' we can do with Our Kay'. COMBO 1 Go running up to your opponent with the following: K, P. (D, DB, B+K) then follow this up swiftly with a (F, D, DF+P) If done efficiently this should result in a combo, taking off well over half your opponent's energy in one go! KAYIN 0 93 RAYIN Kayin gets knocked out by Eiji's super death fart. Phooah (Left) RUNGO-IRON KUNa 3730400 SININ Next up is 30-year old Rungo man, who weighs in at a fairly hefty 92kg and is 176cm tall. However, let's face it, although he's a spectacularly powerful mutherfunster he's absolute waster when it comes to combos, simply because he is so slow! Anyway try out these moves and you should be amused for a 'hot minute'! COMBO 2 Do the following moves when your energy bar is flashing red for TOTAL DEVASTATION! (This one is strictly for joypad connoisseurs who can do complicated pad moves with relative ease). (F, FD, D, B, DB, B, F +HK and Weak K simultaneously) then after you've recovered from the graphical shock try to follow this up swiftly with the following F, FD, D, DB, B, DB, D, DF, F + HP) finishing move. Again, like Eiji's second combo this can only be done when Kayin's energy bar is flashing red! COMBO 1 F, FD, D, DB, B + P. Then try to swiftly follow this up with F, FU, U, UL, L, R, RD, D + HK + HP. If done correctly, and if it works this should clear a whopping half the energy bar from fresh! COMBO 2 There's not really many combos you can do well with this bloke so instead we'll give you his rather superb finishing move. When your energy bar is flashing red, get close to your opponent and press: B, BD, D, DF, F, DF, D, DB, B +HP -[finishing move] If you like playing as this guy then you'll find 103 "

And follow all this swiftly with F, FD, D, DB, B, DB, D, DF, F + HP (finishing move). If done correctly, this combo can almost kill your opponent from fresh! The next character in the line up is, like, mega old. He's 106! and weighs in at 48kg, and is 154cm tall. He's quite a formidable warrior but you really have to learn to use his special moves well, and only then can you pull off some rather amusing and effective combos! COMBO 1 Try to be really close to your opponent for this 'wicked' combo to inflict max damage: jump in with P, WP, K, Sweep, and then swiftly follow this with D, DB, B + K. This should really give your opponent something to worry about as their energy level plummets to the half mark from fresh. Trust Takara to put some totally unbelieveable and ridiculous moves in this game. Oh well, if anything it makes it totally different from the rest. REPOR 4 SOFIA ARTA COMBO 2 This is the finishing move which can only be done when your player's energy bar is flashing red, it can also, in this situation, be added to the end of combo 1, and it goes a little something like this: F, B, F, B + HP) finishing move. One of the two girlies in the game is Sofia and in true Takara style (the programmers of both this and the Fatal Fury games) she is blessed with the token big jugs. However this does not seem to flaw her abilities as a superb fighter. She is fast and agile and carries a bizarrelooking long whip. In fact her whole outfit wouldn't look out of place at a Soho strip joint. Anyway let's see how well she performs in the ring! COMBO 1 F, FD, D, DB, B +P followed by D, DF, F + P and D, DB, B + P 'SMOKING. The Sofias like nothing better than whipping up a bit of hot fighting action. 104 "

She's the easiest person to pull off flash moves and combos with. So let's take the little girlie for a test drive. Fire up 'n' Fight. COMBO 2 Link this to the end of the first combo if you are in trouble and your bar is flashing red: (F, B, F, B + HP) finishing move. 2192200 COMBO 1 Jump up in the air and do the following in mid air D, DB, B + K. Then once you land quickly do the following F, D, DF +P. And finish this off with FD, D, DB, D, DF, B, F, D +HP & HK. TOTALLY AWESOME 8 HITS!

Well follow this and you're almost sure to be well on the road to victory! Last up and clocking up 29 of your Earth years and weighing in at a slim 75kg (without the armour I'm guessing), and storming in at an impressive 190cm tall. He's gotto be the toughest bloke here, but he is far from exciting to play as. However do not let this dishearten you in any way because these combos make him ace. Try them and see exactly what I mean! COMBO 1 D, DF, F + P and D, DB, B + P This a simple but damn effective combo to help get out of those sticky situations. COMBO 1 B, F, FD, D + P and FD, D, DB, D, DF, D, B, F + WP & HP See what we mean! COMBO 2 The same as above but with this finishing move on the end: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, B + HP (only activated when energy bar flashes red). SECRET MOVE: F, FU, U, UB, B, F, FD, D + HP & HK.

"CVG TIPS TIPS I AMIGA ATR Things look a little less bleak for the Amiga with the likes of Team 17 still putting their considerable weight behind the machine. Here's a cheat for one of their best games from recent months, the racing game ATR. This cheat will allow you to access the tough-as-rock space levels without the hassle of playing through the earlier tracks. To do so, select battle mode and then forest world. Now choose track two and the formula car. Finally select a two player game and let player one win all the races. When you return to the title screen, select the battle mode once more. This time round you should be able to select the far out space world. Ta muchly to Dominic Cahalin from Ealing, London for that. If you're having trouble keeping yourself pale and spotty in this iceberg-melting, seas-a-rising, world's gonna end soon hot weather, then the following four pages could be just what you're looking for. So grab some fizzy pop, a 12 pack of crisps, pull the curtains to and settle down for another collection of up-to-theminute tips and cheats. ICD32 sa sa FLINK Can the CD pull itself back from the precipice of doom and despair? I don't know, but what I do know is that Andrea Huber from Germany has supplied a darn useful cheat for Psygnosis' pretty cool platformer. To access the cheat, start the game as normal and press and hold the pad down then the pause button. Now release the down button but while keeping the pause button pressed hit right, right, right, left, left, left, right, right, left, left, right and finally left. If you've entered that little lot correctly a cheat menu should have appeared. This allows you to reset the level you're currently on with full magic and three lives, as well as allowing you to skip backwards and forwards to any level. I PC ISNES CANNON FODDER This is a similar cheat to that featured in the rapidly approaching crinkledom Amiga original. It comes from Mat Swannell down in Surrey and goes like this. On Mission 8, Phase 2, go right through the forest and cross the river, all the while heading towards the bottom of the screen. Eventually you should reach a hut and once you do kill the innocent bystander (remembering that no one is innocent in war, conscience fans) and go into the bush with just one MISSION 3 man. In the bushes you should find 50 lovely jubbly bazookas just sitting there for the taking. CHRIS 2 WING COMMANDER 3 Reuben Dennis also sent in this cheat for EA's superlative space soap shoot-'em-up which will boost your score with little effort. Go to the options menu during in-game flight and switch COLLISIONS OFF and INVULNERABILITY ON. Return to the game and carry on until you meet an enemy carrier. Use your wingman to cover you and use your afterburner to get close to the carrier and then fly in through its landing tunnel. Once inside the carrier there should be plenty of sitting duck enemy fighters docked in the landing bay. Destroy them, exit and then destroy the carrier too, which obviously is now lacking much of its defence. Et voilà, on return to base your score will be boosted by all the fighters and the carrier itself that you destroyed. Simple huh? HEROES IN VIC 108_ "
