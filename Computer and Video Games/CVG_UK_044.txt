"Instead of computers cato technology now has to ca <? ? ENTERPRISE The way we see it, technology has suddenly got quite a race on its hands. There's no other home computer in the world that's so expandable or so updatable as the new Enterprise 64. And if you're wondering quite how we've managed that, kindly take a closer look at the outputs on our remarkable new machine. You'll notice that amongst all the usual sockets and terminals, we've gone and incorporated a special 66-way expansion port. This will accept a whole range of new peripherals that are in the pipeline. Including those that are a mere twinkle in the eyes of our hardware designers. We thought this expandability principle was such a good idea, we applied it to the Enterprise's memory, too. Even in its most basic 64K form, this puts more user RAM at your disposal than almost any other competitor. But plug in our special Rampacks to the base unit, and you can progressively increase that figure to a truly extraordinary 3,900K "

With a screen resolution of up to 672 x 512 pixels, 256 colours and a high speed video processor, the Enterprise will outgun all but the highest quality TV monitors. And the sophisticated sound chip generates no fewer than 4 voices across 8 octaves in full stereo. Combine the two and you can create effects that leave today's games looking like pub video tennis of the mid-seventies. For anyone with literary aspirations, the Enterprise also comes complete with an integrated word processor. Whilst the really serious user will be delighted to discover analogue RGB and TV outputs, as well as parallel, RS423 serial and network ports. Both Cobol and C will be available with CP/M running, and you can even use Lisp, Forth and Z80 assembly language on cartridge without encroaching on user RAM. The new Enterprise 64.

Hi there C&VG readers! I'm the Blagger and I want YOU to fly with me to Hollywood for the holiday of a lifetime! Hollywood is the movie centre of the world â and all the stars of TV and cinema can be seen in action. If you get to fly with Blagger to sunny California, you'll be able to see the stars in action and have enough adventures of your own to make your own movie! But first you have to help Blagger steal a copy of the latest movie blockbuster in his latest computer adventure, Blagger Goes to Hollywood. Blagger has decided that his true path to fame and fortune lies in the movies not appearing in them but in capturing the master copy of the latest megabuck spectacular now in production. But, when he reaches Hollywood, he soon realises that the heroes of the movies are not celluloid frauds and can put their talents to good use in defence of their reputations. In Alligata's latest hit game you have to assist Blagger through these dangerous movie sets, making full use of the four way scrolling action to find your route to the final film location, the opportunity for Blagger to make his most famous snatch of all. As in every truly great spectacular, the plot isn't quite as simple as it seems and the scriptwriters of Hollywood have set a few brainteasers on the way. Once you've solved a number of them then you'll have the clues to complete and enter the competition for the opportunity of the holiday of a lifetime. 10 RUNNERS UP PRIZES WORTH 250 eebi BLAGGER IS BACK ACTION .95 Allinals jebul i C&VG/ALLIGATA BLAGGER i COMPETITION FLY WITH BLAGGER  NAME ADDRESS Unique Blogger Goes to Hollywood Number:.....

MEMOREX SOLID-SEAM BONDING: Every inch of every seam is sealed shut. Tight as a drum. They seem equal. Until you look at the seams. That's where equality ends. Most companies seal their discs with a spot here, a spot there. Leaving most of each seam not sealed at all. Sooner or later, the seams might do what comes naturally: they bulge. Warp. Pucker.

"GHOSTWRITERS! A couple of months ago we asked you to send in your ghost stories, and 50 winners would win a copy of the Ghostbusters game by Activision. Maybe it was the cold winter nights that got your imaginations working, but for us here in the office it was a scary experience reading them while the winds howled outside and the rest of the building was in darkness. A full list of winners is available from the C&VG offices, but, in the meantime here are a couple of stories to whet your appetite. ELLERY As a chill wind blew over Standton, a frail white sheet blew from a washing line and up into the bedroom of number 54 Ringfield Road. It landed on the chair in the warm corner of the room and it was there that the sheet took on its paranormal shape, a ghostly figure that lay horrible slumped in the chair. It roused to the sound of a computer game. It was intrigued. He noticed at once that the game was Pac-Man. After a while he became bored of playing the game and decided to get in on the act. He slid down in between the holes which were at the back of the television. To his surprise, the ghost found himself inside the maze. He was thrilled until he saw a yellow blob, mouth open, coming in his direction. Then it struck him, the blob was Pac-Man and Pac-Man ate ghosts. The amazed ghost looked at the blob and realised he must move. Jasper, the ghost, shot upwards passing an amazed red ghost, which was then unfortunately chomped by Pac-Man who was in a foul mood by now. Jasper turned the corner just avoiding a power pill. He got to where he had come in, raced out of the back of the television and down the wire. He arrived at the plug, happy that he was still in one piece. At least Jasper was safe!! Paul Hewett It was a quiet evening. I was sitting in my favourite chair, watching my favourite television programme, munching my favourite chocolates. It's a hard life being a student 'specially in the holidays. JR had just been shot again when there was a screech of tyres outside, a burst of disco music and ... and ... Silence. Then my front window caved in! There was a brief pause, then a stocky youth clambered through. He was dressed in black overalls with no-smoking signs stuck all over them and he was carrying a large backpack. The music started up again. There was a pause, then. \"GHOSTBUSTERS!\" he screamed. I choked on my coffee cream. He waited patiently until I recovered, then in a cool, brisk, professional manner he asked me, \"Is this 12 Windmill Close?\" \"No!\" I replied in a somewhat less cool manner, \"It's 173 Hove Crescent\". Another pause. He appeared to be listening for something, some sort of cue. \"GHOSTBUSTERS!\" he bellowed again. \"Oh absolutely\"I commented knowledgeably. In truth I was getting slightly irritated with the conversation. I don't object when people smash in the double-glazing at 8.30 pm on Wednesday evening. but I do get annoyed when they have nothing intelligent to say. We regarded each other silently for a few moments. Something stirred behind him on the sofa. What was it? What could it be? I had just remembered when he spun round to face the sofa and in one smooth, professional, practised movement, he fired ... and blew up the cat!! As the fur drifted down, he turned to face me again. \"Ah well, wrong address. Happens all the time. Sorry about the mess. Nice meeting you\". He disappeared out of the window, then a few seconds later his head poked round the corner. \"And remember: if you're seeing things running through your head, who you gonna call?\" \"Interflora!\" I muttered absentmindedly, wondering how I was f going to phrase the insurance claim. PS Who was the mysterious stranger Richard Stevens who burst in while JR was being ventilated? Did he ever really exist? Was it all just a figment of my imagine ation?

"IS A EUSTON FILMS PRODUCTION Arthur Daley, North London's most notorious small time crook, has turned a once reputable software house into a dealer of rubber wet suits, rat traps and adult magazines. DK 'Tronics have decided to turn their back on the law and launch Minder, a game that lets you take Arthur's place in the shady second-hand car market and dabble in free market trading in other words selling 100 stolen garden gnomes.

Instead, the person you Priestly is quite adamant that he was are talking to will carry on with the right to use Arthur as the central figure conversation and eventually become for the game. \"Arthur is the most more and more tired by your nonT suppose it was inevitable.

Inside Terry's flat on Day 2 of the game. THE GAME The main aim for the player is to make as much money in 14 days as he can. You start off at Arthur's lock-up with ,000 in your pocket and some stock that's in the garage, which can be anything from sheepskin coats to 20 boxes of plastic spots or even Blue Peter presenters. And this is where the skill of the game comes in how much Is a Blue Peter presenter worth From here, you can go to one of a number of places, either the winchester Club, Terry's tat, to one of the dealer's places, back to the lock-up or back home to 'er indoors. The best place to begin is at the Winchester Club. Most of the people you do business with go there for a drink some time during the day and many of the local sharks also pop in now and then to do some business. Each of the people in the club is represented in eight portrait frames on the screen. Each one has a number, the one with the lowest number will be the first person to approach you, although if you're quick you can get to the person you want to speak to without being sidetracked by a stranger or being buttonholed by Detective Chisholm looking for a hundredweight of stolen trouser zips. Each one of these meetings or conversations, no matter how short, takes up an hour of your time. So it's important to plan your day carefully because if you hang around too long talking to strangers the person you came to see is quite likely to have left. Your first aim is to find a dealer who is ready to do business. There are eight dealers in Minder who regularly sell to and buy from you. You'll need to be able to identify their faces because there are so many other people who crop up while you are playing. Minder incorporates a face generator in the game which can create 35,000 different faces, so you are hardly likely to see the same person, apart from the dealers, during the course of a game. This obviously makes it much more difficult, and again prevents the repetitiveness common to most Adventures. CHESTER CLUB OUT 000 a MR DALEY ? R DALE?

"Our man in America, Marshal M. Rosenthal, has been delving into the magical world of computer animation and visited the company who put the word special into special effects for TRON and The Last Starfighter Tused to love making my own Super-8 movies as a kid. My friends and I would dress up and run around screaming and shouting, playing spacemen and gladiators from the future. Sometimes we'd try to do special effects, like turning the camera on and off to make people appear and disappear. Our \"show-stopper\" was the time we moved a set of playing cards from one place to another, while passing coloured acetates over the lens. Shot at single frame, the cards moved all by themselves, while mysterious lights seemed to dance around them. We didn't know it then, but our foray into \"animation\" was a prelude of the future, when not just lights, but entire sets would be created artificially. Animation effects have been used for almost as long as films have been around. Early movies used models, even puppets, for spaceships and monsters the serials of the 30s and 40s could never have gotten along without them! Others turned to the cartoon artist/animator to create that which only existed as fantasy. Animation could be used to bypass a difficult effect such as the flying sequences of the rarely seen Superman serial of the 1930s.

A strange protrusion emerges from shark infested waters amidst a group of islands in the South Pacific. Nobody has yet reached this object, which is possessed by an evil force and guarded by deadly plants, murals, pigmen, chasing ghouls and yellow horned demons. Prof. Burk arrives on the scene, resplendent in his newly invented space suit and jet pack able to withstand the forces emanating from the green and red blocks which cover the Mount. He intends to be first to the summit. Woefully the jet pack cannot withstand all of the effects of the coloured blocks and therefore great care has to be taken when jumping from block to block, so as to ensure correct coordination of the ENERGY LEVEL (On/Off) with the coloured block being stood on. Ignoring all advice against attempting his objective, the fearless mountaineer states, \"people risked their lives to conquer Mount Everest, why not this challenge?\" Your mission is to help guide the determined Prof. Burk to the top of Mount Challenge (you'll need to draw a rough map as you go along). Good luck!

"O 005 EGGS CERERE veesuu RUNS ON AN ATARI 400-16K BY ANDREW BLAKE es Mei This more game for the Atari has you, as the intrepid explorer, dashing around an underground labyrinth, pursued by Oggs (use joystick In port one). To stay alive. you'll have to eat the multitude of nutritional eggs which the Oggs lay, but be wary of their sticky slime which they have a tendency to leave to leave in tunnels. The eggs are worth: Blue eggs 1 point + 1 unit of energy Red eggs 10 points + 1 unit of energy Gold eggs 100 points + 2 units of energy If you have to go through the slime, make sure you have at least 100 units of energy. If things get too eggeiting, then take a rest in one of the safe tunnels at the sides of the screen which the Oggs are too big to fit into. Finally, if all else fails, the fire button drops Ogg Repelant, but this isn't always very reliable. 5 REM OGGS EGGS 6 REM ** BY A.M.

These tips come from an old friend to these pages, Michael King. Michael recommends you go through the Secret Passage, as with practice you can steer your vessels through.

Whichever way the planes move, you follow and ALWAYS keep your guns at 52' 0Â° plus keeping your finger on the fire button as it auto-repeats very quickly. Next thing on the horizon is three ships. DON'T go for the largest 'cos if you do the others will bombard you. Remember to always watch how far you are from hitting the boat. Only aim for the ship which is aiming for you.

Use: CAPS SHIFT for Left for Right for Jump In order to move Hunchy to the right-hand side of 30 different screens to ring the bell. It's all against the clock and everything is hazardous to Hunchy's health. Youll see below a table of all the user-defined graphic characters used in this program. Instead of confusing the listing by leaving them in, we've changed them to underlined upper case letters. So, for instance, If you see 'A' in the listing. go into graphics mode (CAPS SHIFT + 9), then press the 'A' key (you'll see a graphic character), then press CAPS SHIFT + 9 again to return to normal text. Be very careful in lines 1050 and 1060 where graphics characters alternate with the underline symbol. Line 6520 uses symbol graphics (the ones on the number keys). When in graphics mode, type SHIFT+'1', then 3, then 7, to give a table-like shape. If this type of listing is a success, then we'll continue to use it in future Issues, so we would welcome any comments. 155 DATA 0, 32, 32, 36, 84, 74, 149, 1 156 DATA 0,4,20,42,82, 73,149,17 157 DATA 63, 64, 63, 64, 32, 32, 88, 1 35 158 DATA 252,2, 252,2,4,4,26,225 159 DATA 85, 85, 84, 20,1, 85, 85, 85 160 DATA 0, 32, 67,254,67,32,0,0 161 DATA 15, 16, 224, 166, 127, 28,2 4,0 162 DATA 255,0,0,0,255,0,0,0 163 DATA 240,8,5, 98, 252, 56, 24,0 164 DATA 24, 24, 126, 126, 24, 24, 24 , 24 UKS AKA t 1 || + PART 1 1 BORDER O: INK 7: PAPER O: C LS 5 LET t=0 10 FOR i=USR \"a\" TO USR \"U\"+7 20 READ a: POKE i, a: LET t=t+a 30 NEXT i 40 IF t<>9806 THEN PRINT \"THE GRAPHICS HAVE BEEN TYPED IN WRO NGLY\": BEEP 0.5, 0: STOP 144 DATA 56, 116, 126, 96,60, 24, 25 2,124 145 DATA 52,26,29, 28, 36,68,130, 67 146 DATA 14,31,31,31,14,0,0,0 147 DATA 0,127,56, 46, 124,0,0,0 148 DATA 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,255 149 DATA 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16,2 55 150 DATA 0,4, 130, 127,130,4,0,0 151 DATA 28, 46, 126, 6, 60, 24, 63,6 200 REM titles 205 INK 3: BRIGHT 1 210 PLOT 8, 167: DRAW 0,-16: DRA W 16,-8: DRAW 0,-32: DPAW -8,-8: DRAW 24,0: DRAW 0,16: DRAW 8,0: DRAW 0,-16: DRAW 24,0: DRAW -8, 8: DRAW 0,48: DRAW 8,8: DRAW -32 ,0: DRAW 8,-8: DRAW 0,-24: DRAW -8,0: DRAW 0,16: DRAW -32,16 220 PLOT 72,159: DRAW 16,0: DRA W 0,-48: DRAW 8,0: DRAW 0,48: DR AW 16,0: DRAW -8,-8: DRAW 0,-40: DRAW -8,-8: DRAW -8,0: DRAW -8, 8: DRAW 0,40: DRAW -8,8 230 PLOT 120, 159: DRAW -8,-8: D RAW 0,-40: DRAW -8,-8: DRAW 16,0 : DRAW 0,40: DRAW 8,8: DRAW 8,0: DRAW O, -40: DRAW -8,-8: DRAW 16 ,0: DRAW 0,48: DRAW -8,8: DRAW 8,0: DRAW -8,-8: DRAW 0,8 240 PLOT 160, 159: DRAW 8,0: DRA W 8,-8: DRAW 0,-8: DRAW -8,0: DR AW 0,8: DRAW -8,0: DRAW 0, -40: D RAW 8,0: DRAW 0,8: DRAW 8,0: DRA W 0,-8: DRAW -8,-8: DRAW RAW -8,8: DRAW 0,40: DRAW 8,8 -8,0: D 250 PLOT 184,159: DRAW 8,0: DRA W 0,-24: DRAW 8,8: DRAW 8,-8: DR AW 0,-32: DRAW -8,0: DRAW 0,32: DRAW -8,-8: DRAW 0,-24: DRAW -16 ,0: DRAW 8,8: DRAW 0,48 260 PLOT 216, 135: DRAW 8,0: DRA W 6,-16: DRAW 8,16: DRAW 8,0: DR AW -32,-56: DRAW -32,8: DRAW 24, O: DRAW 16,24: DRAW -8,24 999 INK 7: BRIGHT O 1000 FOR i=1 TO 3 1010 FOR j=1 TO 7: PAUSE 2: PRIN TAT 13,0; INK j; D.LYTTLE CO ncepts and program S.

"RUNS ON A COMMODORE 64 BY PAUL HAMMOND You guessed It, It's Pengl the penguin in the ice field. The idea of the game is to guide Pengi around a maze of Ice blocks, avoiding the rampaging snow bees to reach the next level. You can get to the next of the 30 different levels by moving the bonus ice block (that's the funny. coloured one) to the bottom of the screen and by killing the snow bees. You have to kill eight snow bees plus two snow bees per level to reach the next screen. This is done by pushing an ice block onto them, but take care, because as fast as you try to squash them, they'll try to melt the Ice to get at you. You score 20 points per snow bee squashed, and 50 points every time you drop the bonus ice block by one level. Oh, and there's an extra life if you ever have the good fortune to reach level nine. 10 PRINT\" (CLEAR)\": POKE53281.0: POKE53280, The listing will probably look a little unusual this month. Instead of all those confusing control symbols, we've substituted mnemonics inside square brackets. Don't type these in, but press the key they represent. So, if you: SEE PRESS (GREEN) Green key [DOWN) Cursor Down key (HOME) CLR/HOME key Is V] Shift + 'V' IcCommodore key + and so on. Of course, you won't actually see any of this displayed you'll just got those confusing symbols on the screen.

"Bug Dear BH, I was going to type in Gold Rush for the Spectrum from your February Book of Games but there were some characters that I couldn't get on my Spectrum keyboard. Please help. CJ Ackers The characters you mention are user defined graphics, which are used to represent the players and other objects. You enter these by pressing a capital letter from A to U while in graphics mode, which you enter with CAPS SHIFT-9. The problem is that you won't know which characters correspond to which letters until the program is run. So, enter the listing and leave spaces where the graphics should be. Type RUN and, after a few seconds, break in to the game. The characters should now be defined, so enter graphics mode and press the capital letters from A to U. You should find that they produce graphics, so you can go back to the listing and enter the correct characters. Once everything is complete, don't forget to save the game to tape again. Incidentally, Program Express now has a competitor. Soft Store is based on a similar principle, but no modems are used. All the games are held in a special ticket operated machine. You buy a ticket and stick it in the machine along with a blank tape. Rosetech, who make the machines, say that instead of updating by telephone, someone will come round to the shop with a special disk and update the machine whenever new games come out. Seems a step in the wrong direction, if you ask me. Dear BH, Please can you tell me how some programmers manage to make the 64 display a picture while it's loading a tape. Ian Kennedy Computers can only do one task at a time, but they work so fast that it looks as if they are doing more than one thing at a time. For example, if a picture is on the screen while a tape is loading, the computer has to keep reading data from the cassette port and also update the screen at the same time. Obviously, the less things that the 64 is doing, the faster it can complete the one thing that it is actually doing. So, the machine turns off the screen while loading tapes to save time. However, some programs load in a small loader program which actually rewrites part of the routine that tells the 64 how to load a tape. That routine is almost the same as the original, but manages to keep the display alive while loading a tape. I don't know of any utilities that let you do the same with your own programs, though you could try adapting one of the cassettes you already have. Dear BH, Is it possible to save machine code bytes that exist in memory without having to convert them back to data statements first? IR Newton Yes, it is. Use the CODE statement in the SAVE command. Type SAVE \"name\" CODE xxxx,yyyy. This will save the area of memory starting at address xxxxx and continuing for yyyy bytes. The name of the file on tape or microdrive will be \"name\". So, for example, to save a block of 5000 bytes starting from address 30,000 under the name of TEST, type SAVE \"TEST\" CODE 30000, 5000 Dear BH, Last year you wrote an article about buying software through modems. I don't know much about this, so can you please explain it again? Thank you. Asif Khan. Program Express launched a machine in the middle of last year which was based on a system known as EDOS, which stands for Electronic Distribution of Software. The idea is that the micro shop has a machine connected to the EDOS computer in Edinburgh by a modem. If you want to buy a game, you load a blank cassette into the machine, pay your money and a copy of the game is transferred to your tape. This means that the shops can always have the latest games in stock, but never be overstocked, which costs money. Not a lot happened on the EDOS scene and everyone lost interest. But it seems that the company is well and truly convinced of the idea, and they told me at the recent LET show that you will see EDOS machines in the shops any day now. Dear BH, My 64 won't load games. Well actually it will load about half of the games I buy but the rest won't load. They load on my friends' computers. I have had my cassette recorder replaced but still nothing works. Please help. Timothy Miller If you've replaced the cassette recorder, then it probably isn't that that's at fault. If the tapes load into a friend's computer then it can't be that you have faulty copies. Therefore, I suspect that it's actually your micro that has the problem. It's a fairly common problem which your dealer should be able to fix. If the machine is under guarantee then you're lucky. If it's not, then phone around some local shops first and get the best price. And make sure that the shop will guarantee its work. Dear BH, Since I bought a Currah MicroSpeech for my Spectrum, I have had a lot of problems loading programs. Can you give me some advice as to what I can do about it? Brian Thorpe It depends on how bad the problem really is, Brian. If it means that some games will take two or three attempts before they load completely, then I could live with the problem. If it makes most of your software totally unusable then you could contact Welwyn Systems of Tunbridge Wells, who have taken over the Currah range, and ask them for a replacement. That's it for another month. Remember, if your micro's getting you down, we're here to give you advice. Write to C&VG at Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London ECI. Our Micronet mailbox number is 012 786 556. 88 "

"ENTERPRISE The micro's futuristic looks tend to immediately set it apart from the competition. The black moulded case contains a built-in joystick and four-colour keyboard, based on the rubber-mat, Sinclair QLtype keys. A hinged plastic strip along the top of the keyboard holds details of the eight function keys which, combined with \"Shift\", \"Ctrl\" and \"Alt\", allow The first few models of a new microcomputer, called The up to 32 functions. Enterprise, are now starting to appear. Initially launched about 18 A ROM port on the left of the months ago, the computer has been plagued by delays and a machine will initially contain the ISchange of name. Nevertheless, with superb sound and graphics BASIC cartridge, but leaves the way capabilities, the Enterprise should fare well against more recent clear for other plug-in language and arrivals, such as the Commodore 16 and Amstrad. MARCUS game cartridges at a later date. JEFFERY investigates. Along the back are a number of connectors for control of up to two cassette recorders, TV, monitor and hi-fi output, a power socket (for an external transformer), serial and parallel ports, and edge connectors for two joysticks. Unfortunately, the choice of mainly edge connectors, rather than more standard sockets, is probably going to imply the necessity for interfaces, as on the Spectrum. The first interface most people will need will be to allow Atari-type joysticks to be connected. Finally, to the right of the machine is an expansion port for extra memory (up to a staggering 4Mbytes!), disc drives, and the like. The basic processor is a Z80A running at 4MHz. The two most impressive chips on the board are, however, two custom-built chips to handle the sound and graphics. Additionally, the machine comes complete with a word-processor chip. If there are no cartridges plugged into the machine, then it will power up to the word processor. Those people wanting to write their This software has its faults and is own games will find the Enterprise not particularly special, however, it is very helpful.

"The BOND DIARY The game plans followed this scenario pretty closely Bond's computer car could even make handbrake turns to avoid police road blocks! The screen display also included a tracking device based on secret service design. How did these guys get their information! In reality, Bond reached the place where the girl was going to land and captured her. In the game, if you miss the landing, the girl known as Mayday gets into a car and Bond must chase her through the streets with yet more French cobs on his tail! Well, there's one thing they got wrong. Bond ALWAYS gets the girl. Still, in this case, Bond extracted some secrets from Mayday before she escaped him again and as a result he dashed off to San Francisco where more mayhem awaited him. He got trapped in City Hall which had been set on fire by another evil villain! The game got this bit right too. The designers call it an arcade adventure. Bond called it something else afterurards unprintable, of course. The game plan follows Bond's bid to escape from the burning building pretty dosely even down to having him help a beautiful blonde escape from the flames. Programmer's notes say that the girl may well talk. Someone has been talking already! Bond had to find the security code to escape from the building and this part of the game includes that.

"BY MIKE SINGLETON, AUTHOR OF THE BEST STRATEGY GAME, 1985 RASPBERRY SEASON able advice before wasting a lot of time, money and effort trying to promote a disaster. What's worse, they expect Spectrum owners to cough up .95 for something that would have been more entertaining if it had remained a blank cassette! A CASE OF LISTITUS Competition is fierce between the six Weyrs, up to four of which may be controlled by human players. This should make for an interesting game of Machiavellian manouevre but the fact that any of your actions, at best, results in a number or word in one of the many lists dramatically changing to another number or word makes the intrigue about as interesting as dishwater. So little attention has been paid to creating \"atmosphere that you might as well be manipulating school timetables or laundry lists. In fact, you might as well forsake your computer and play the board game Diplomacy, yet to be equalled for back-stabbing intrigue. U.S. MOULD It's quite appropriate that the season for raspberries is almost upon us because this month I have a number of them to hand out. The loudest must go to a game that's grandly called Superpower â The Final Strategy. Foisted upon the unsuspecting public by Howard Marketing, it is without doubt a strong contender for the coveted Worst Game Of All Time award. The principal elements of the game are highly derivative. There are 24 countries, each of which has different numbers of factories, armies, missiles and shelters. The aim is to conquer the lot. Ex-readers of the mourned Personal Computer Games magazine will be familiar with this scenario it's the basis of PCG's Final Conflict, their multi-player postal game. In Superpower, however, all the subtleties of Final Conflict have been lost. With an unfailing knack for tedium, the designer of Superpower has even restricted the orders you can give to one country per turn. Since the orders you can give are simple build armies, missiles, shelters, factories or attack a neighbour (but only one of these) â the player is faced with making a series of Noddy choices. Although Final Conflict's options per country were equally simple, the fact that you had to give orders for all your countries in a single turn presented the player with true strategic choices, for each combin. ation of orders would have a complex effect. Apart from all this, the presentation of the game is awful. The continent you are supposed to conquer is a 4x6 rectangle of squares and you've guessed it each country is a square. No attempt has been made at graphic frills a nice little picture of a missile or factory for example. It's all bare words and numbers. Input of orders is equally annoying; if you make an illegal order, the computer doesn't bother to tell you, it just waits dumbly for you to try again. I do wish people like Howard Marketing would seek some professional or at least knowledg. Now it's the turn of the C64 to have the odour of raspberries wafting in its direction. I speak of the Dragonriders of Pern, released by CBS Software in conjunction with Epyx. It's an arcade-strategy game of the sort where you do a bit of strategy, then you get a bit of action and so on. The arcade section is very well done although it seems to lack the variety a true arcade freak pines for. Perched on the back of your pet dragon, you roam the skies of Pern trying to incinerate the deadly Threads that assail your planet. The Threads, which look like pieces of string to me, are microorganisms that burn flesh and consume all living matter. If you don't manage to stop them, your lands will become a barren waste. High quality graphics and action to be found here. The designer of the strategy section, however, seems to have had a severe attack of lists. To quote, \"a vivid map of Pern is displayed randomly throughout the Negotiation/Intrigue phase\", but since this is used mainly to determine who is going to intercept the latest Threadfall, it has little relevance to strategy. The strategy phase is played entirely by manipulating lists and menus. The event screen is a table outlining the current events associated with each Weyr. A Weyr is a habitation of Dragonriders, so we are told. The action menu/status screen lists eight different actions open to you and gives more details of your own particular Weyr. There is another screen which the instructions simply refer to as the list of major holds, craft halls and Weyrs, and lastly there is the attitude screen which lists the five attitudes you may select during negotiation. The politics of Pern makes the Balkans look like a piece of cake and the strategic options open to you are almost all to do with diplomacy (although you can opt to fight a duel). Battle for Normandy is another game for the 64 from the seemingly bottomless coffers of US Gold. I hesitate to say from the bottom of the barrel because, like most American software, the game is superficially slick and wellpresented. However, it lacks in that most important ingredient, playability. The format is familiar larger than screen hex map in glorious technicolour that scrolls as you move the cursor, coloured squares with a variety of symbols to represent the different units, a small section of the screen devoted to messages and unit data. All this works and works well, looking good at the same time. Unfortunately, it's not so much Rommel's bombardment that makes you quail as the barrage of statistics flung at you by the computer, all in garbage-out mode (you know, so many abbreviations and numbers flung together that it looks like a high-security code). This alphanumeric nightmare occurs every time you look at a different unit. When it comes to giving orders to units, all input is in garbage-in mode. As you might guess, this is the reverse of garbage-out mode; instead of trying to decode abbreviated data, you have to type it in! For example, you may choose a defence level from one to nine. Each of the digits has a different meaning and it's a better memory. bank than I who wouldn't be able to play sensibly without the rule-book permanently to hand. 110 "
