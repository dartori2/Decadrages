"RESULTS! RESULTS! RESULTS! RESULTS! CVG WINNERS GALORE! SV or blimey, guv'nor those CVG boys get everywhere! Yes indeed, the world's greatest games mag doesn't muck about when it comes to telling you what's hot and what's not. Now we're appearing every week in Britain's biggest newspaper and we're on the telly too! Eagle-eyed CVG heroes will already know, Yours Truly writes a regular column for the Mega Guide games section every Saturday in The Sun. It's called The Buzz and it's stuffed full with the hottest games news from Britain, Japan, and America and you're being very sad if you've missed it! But that's not all the CVG boys are appearing each and every Thursday between 4 and 5pm on Sky News Live, so now you can feast your eyes on all the latest gaming goodies while tucking into your tea! And there's more by the time you read this, GamesMaster should be well into its second series, and the CVG boys are on that as well! By now most of you will have seen the new show, and been just as gobsmacked as we were by the well wicked location on which it's been filmed and the slicker format of the show. If that's not enough (and it never is!) ITV are lining up their own games show called BAD Influence, and you might even see a few of the CVG boyos there too! The Yorkshire TV programme (networked to all the stations) will be taking an in-depth look at the world of computer entertainment, with live studio sections to bring you the latest stuff! Don't know about you, but we reckon all this interest is great for games. The world has finally started to take computer games seriously, and all the old guff people used to churn out about consoles being bad for you has been replaced by genuine enthusiasm for an entertainment phenomenon most adults were never able to understand. If this goes on, and all the signs are that it will, more and more people will realise what they've been missing all these years and the games industry will grow and grow. Games will definitely get even better, with more spent on production because more people are buying them, and prices will come down as the market becomes more competitive. Personally I don't think the world of Computer and Video Games has ever been in better shape, and I for one can't wait to see what the future brings. Some of the games we're seeing come through on console are breaking gameplay records left, right and centre and it can only get better. But what do you think? Drop a line to Word Up at the usual CVG address and we'll do a Letters Special soon printing the best we get. See you next month! TIM BOONE Here they are, the results you've all been waiting for the winners of the Streetfighter 2 compo we held a couple of issues ago! The four runnersup, who each win a copy of the game, are in reverse order: Philip Carpenter, Harrow; Simon Hurst, Brighton; Jamie Stokes, w Yorks and Paul Barrington, Dartford, Kent. The overall winner, who walks off with Streetfighter 2 and a machine to play it on is, wait for it, Sean Kelly from Romford! We'll be printing a few of these ace scrap stories in future issues, but meanwhile turn straight to page 20 where we're giving away TEN Super Nintendos and the game! How Do we do it? PS While we're on the subject of winners, loads of you entered our goodies galore compo and CVG heroes Andrew Stacey and Lorraine Marshall have already won a free game for their efforts because they're bags of little treats were top of the lot!

In Cool World, the creator of the comic strip is magically transported to the world of ink and paint but it's not all bad news, because one of the characters in his story just happens to be Kim Basinger! So it's spawny gets and big piles of sweets all round, even if the rumours about the film on which this game is based being so bad it's to be put straight onto video.

Just when you thought you'd heard it all, almong come the Ambassadors of Funk (featuring MC Mario) with a record all about the megastar with a moustache! Called Super MarioLand it's the essential item for Mario-loving ravers everywhere, wherever they are. The word is that this one's destined for the top 20 along with, wait for it, Tetris by none other than Doctor Spin. The CVG boys were going to play both singles and give you the full lowdown on these sound sensations but, err, we didn't. Anyway, Super MarioLand is on Living Beat Records and Tetris on Polydor, so now you know what to ask for, or not as the case may be...

"NEWS AD ENOUGH YEN The original Super Nintendo TV ad was rather poor, we think you'll agree. After all, a few words shooting onto the screen isn't exactly inspiring, is it. But stay glued to your screens, folks, because the new SNES promo is about to launch itself onto our cathode ray tubes and it's mega! It's been created by the team who produced the stunning graphic effects in the Terminator 2 movie, and once again they've used their revolutionary Polymorphing technique to come up with incredible views of people changing into robots and the like. You should be able to see the ad on your telly in the next month or so, but in the meantime here are some shots to whet your appetite. Well 'ard! SCORETAK 12507250 SPIDERMAN AND THE X-MEN SCORE E SILE Spidey makes his debut on the Super Nintendo! In his first SNES outing, the webbed wonder joins forces with the amazing X-Men in a bid to close down the evil operation of the dastardly Arcade. It's arachnid platform laughs and japes galore, as you take control of Spidey and the X-Men in various action-packed levels filled with Arcade's heinous henchmen. Each superhero has his own special powers and, of course, Spiderman makes good use of his web-slinging abilities and Spidey Sense. After a good, hard look at an almostfinished version of the game, we reckon that Spiderman And The X-Men is going to be one massive hit! Great graphics, lots of thrills and a really tough challenge on each of the levels should ensure that, on its release, this should fly to the top of the charts. When will you get the complete lowdown on this hot cart? Next month, of course, when CVG treats Spidey and his pals to a full, definitive Review! Be there. GOING GREAT GUNS. ( 5 Join Riggs and Murtaugh in this ace new tie-in from Ocean, based upon one of the most successful action films ever! We were treated to a very early look at Lethal Weapon 3, a tale of cops, guns, baddies and, erm, more guns and to say it was looking good would be a slight understatement. There's a lot being shoe-horned into the four-meg cart, and it looks like being action all the way. Blast the baddies with your revolver and avoid the nasties which include pistol-packing punks, enemies with flamethrowers and even man-eating sharks!

"ROUND TWOFIGHT! NEWS SPECIAL REPORT STREETFIGHTER The PC version, with it's superior VGA graphics capabilities, looks even better than hoped. Although some low mhz machines will suffer terribly from loss of speed the animation is superb, with some frames that weren't even included on the SNES version! Again playability will suffer slightly because of the lack of buttons, but all the arcade features with 12 different backdrops, individual music scores and the four championship fighters at the end will be included. AMIGA/PC/SPECTRUM/C64 Street Fighter fever is reaching volcanic proportions as the race to get the incredible arcade masterpiece out on every format before Chrimbo gathers steam. The all formats monsters are already guaranteed the hotly contested number 1 slot on the Christmas Charts, even though they've only been in production for a few months with US Gold. Always first with the big news, CVG has gathered up all the information that's currently available for an astounding taster that'll whet your appetites So let's get on with the show! ROUND ONE FIGHT ROUND THREE FIGHT! The good news is that the Amiga version is nothing like the abysmal Final Fight. There's been no sacrificing of characters or animation and every sample that's on the 16 megabyte cartridge has been squeezed onto the floppy disks. As yet the extremely complicated control system employed by the game has not been finalised for the computer versions. One thing that's for sure though is that every one of the eight characters will have at least 15 moves and 223 frames of animation. It seems likely that the programmers will have to opt for a split control system, where your single fire button will either control punches or kicks with the ability to toggle between the two by pressing a button on the keyboard. As for the humble C64 and Spectrum versions, they won't be left out either as huge strides are being made to make them as complete as the rest of the bunch. However tape users on the Specy will only be able to choose one of two characters to fight with and the computer will have to load up the opponents in a set order one at a time, although this won't be a problem for the lucky +3 disk owners! 000000 3 HONDA |882137 boeing JUST FIGHT! As for the big boys, PC and Amiga, the game is being compacted to fit on to not more than three disks and access will be kept to a minimum. So fight fans had better watch this space, because it's only the beginning of the Street Fighter race! CVG 016 "

"ZU WORLD EXCLUSIVE SONO MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BYSEGA TBA 100 UME 6:03 BINES SONIS LES RINGS f you go down to the woods today Lyou're sure for a big surprise, if you go down to the woods today you're in for a BIG surprise 'COS Sonic is back and he's better than ever! Unfortunately, we're not able to tell you exactly what the plot is but there's a very good reason for this. CVG is so hot we scooped everyone to grab the game first, and all the instructions are at this moment known only to the Japanese developers! What we do know is that Sonic's pals have been kidnapped once again, but a small fox named Two Tails has managed to escape the net of the doc and has now joined forces with the almighty Sonic! So you'd better warn air traffic control there are going to be some serious sparks flying soon ONG THE HEDGEHOG GO ON GET IT Most of the items in Sonic 2 are exactly the same as the original but beware, if you're playing in two player mode all the items screens are just question marks, so it's just a case of hit and miss really. The real bummer is that one of the items is a widget which, if you're unfortunate enough to collect it, will dump you right back to the beginning of the level. Watch out for it! ALS\" LET'S SPLIT INTO TWO, *RINGS 25 *RINGS 2 One of the main selling points of Sonic 2 was the two player mode, which from the very start was going to be achieved by a split screen effect one player controlling Sonic and the other with the reins of Two Tails. This gives a real competitive edge to the two player mode and is a real novelty to boot. The computer splits the screen horizontally in two and squashes up the graphics a tad to accomodate all this high speed hilarity, and whilst it does take a while to get used to it really does work! to STUNNING BONUSES The most graphically impressive part of the game is undoubtedly the STUN Runner type bonus stage which has Sonic and Two Tails running down a tunnel at warp speed, collecting rings and generally having a good time. The 3D effect is quite staggering and the screen really shifts at an amazing 3D lick. The best bit is running up the top of a hill and careering down the other side as Sonic World stretches out into the distance! It's an absolute laff riot and some of the best two-player head-to-head hilarity you'll find anywhere! Top marks to Sega for coming up with plenty of original twists and turns to keep Sonic head and shoulders above the rest! The most impressive, not mention enjoyable part of the game is the Bonus Stage those high speed two player thrills and spills are simply amazing and will have you up 'till the early hours of the morning! At first glance Sonic may not look radically different to the original, but it packs a ton more punch than Bluey's first outing. The levels are absolutely massive, with so much to do and so much to find that you'll bust a gut trying! I wasn't really a fan of Sonics first effort but Sega have worked wonders with this and there's certainly enough here to keep everyone happy! PAUL ANGLIN "


" Kweck out: AVC After all the hype Sonic 2 is here at last delivering everything you could reasonably expect from the game. For a start it's all a tad faster, and the addition of Tails is a real master stroke to beef up the gameplay. Graphics are no great improvement over the original, but seeing as the first game's were about the best you'll find that's no bad thing! Sound is ace too the tunes aren't quite as memorable as the first game, but they're excellent nonetheless and compliment the game very well. On first impressions the game won't drop your jaw, but get to the bonus stage and it will! The STUN Runner-type effect is a real programming feat, and luckily you can choose it as an option to play whenever you want! The only thing which lets Sonic 2 down slightly is the difficulty, initially it's not that much harder than the first game, but things do improve on later stages. It's better than the first game, not enough to induce an adrenalin overload, but more than enough to keep everyone happy! A fine game. TIM BOONE STRATEGY SKILL probose it as only thin SCORE19900 TIMES BINUS DID YOU KNOW..2 One feature of Sonic 2 which remains in the sequel is the appearance of those poles with the little balls on top. Just in case you're a sad person and don't know what they're used for, every time you pass one the computer remembers your position and you get to start there should you lose a life. Rather excellent, eh? SCORE SOOG LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT Another improvement in Sonic 2 has been made in the level size and complexity. On a great deal of levels you can swim underwater, fly through the air with the aid of a springboard or just be boring and walk along it. This means there's much more in the way of secret little passages and bonus rooms, and we're certainly not about to tell you where they are!

"GWE WORLD EXCLUSIVE MASTER SYSTEM PLATFORM BYSEGA TBA TM TIS THE HEDGEHOG Sonic is back! And this time, he's got a pal! His name is Tails, and he's a fox with, surprise surprise, two tails. So what's the story this time round, eh? Well, we just don't know this game's so hot that the only folk who currently know the plot are Sega Japan themselves! But what we can figure out is that Tails has been spirited away and it's up to our spikey blue hero to save the day by racing through the many levels, avoiding the baddies as you go! This is the game that Sega-owning freaks have been gagging for ever since it was announced and CVG scoops the lot with the first Review of this long-awaited sequel. Take it away, boys! PRESS START BUTTON  1992 SEGA SO HOW ARE THE OTHERS SHAPING UP? So you've seen the Master System version of Sonic 2, but what's the score on the other versions of the game? Sonic on Game Gear is looking very good indeed. Similar to the Master System game, this one's packed with all the features you loved from Sonic's first excursion, but bigger and better than ever! And as for the Megadrive version cor blimey, guvnor! A complete overhaul of the first game is what Sega 16-bit owners can expect. If you've been reading CVG lately you'll know that there's now a split-screen two-player option in there in which one player controls Sonic while the other takes on the role of his best pal, Tails! It's looking unbelievable, and we'll be bringing you the definitive Megadrive Sonic 2 review next time around! ALL GOOD THINGS COME As in the first game, Sonic 2's levels are split into three stages, with the hard hedgehog having to do the running_around and collecting rings stuff in the first two before con fronting an enemy in the third. Once he's beaten the end level baddy a big metal exoskeleton appears to release the kidnapped woodland animals, which hop away merrily as if nothing has happened. Aahh! SSH IT'S A SECRET didn't really know what to LOAD! xpect from Sonic 2 the first one was an unbelievable feat on the Master System and it was always going to be a difficult task to even match its brilliance. Now we've got the sequel, I can honestly say that this one is even better than the original! Graphics are simply stunning loads of different levels, each one looking as good as the last, and the Sonic sprite has been spruced up and really looks the bizz! Sonic 2 is essentially the same as before, but bigger and more difficult, and the inclusion of such extras as the underground carts and hang-gliders just add even more to the overall package. Sonic is back with a vengeance; grab this one the second it appears in the shops! CVG 024 PAUL RAND You know there were stacks of secret rooms in the first Sonic The Hedgehog spectacular? Well this time around, there's even more! Some of the bricks on each of the levels look different to others, and these are the ones which can be smashed by spinning into them. Do this to find more rings and extra TV power-ups and also to brag to your mates that you've found a section of the game that they know nothing about! FIS Bar BETTI STORIE "


"REVIEW AVC Kweck out! 5 Anticipation has been rising to fever pitch for this cart around the world, but has the wait been worth it? You bet it has! Anyone who thought Sonic 1 was the best Master System game ever and was worried Sonic 2 wouldn't be up to scratch can put themselves out of their misery right now. For a start this is even faster than the first game, a clever screen layout means the fairly minimal number of enemies doesn't hold up the action one jot. Graphics are excellent the main Sonic sprite has been touched up a tad for better definition and the background colour scheme is more impressive than the original. Most important aspect is the gameplay, though, and this is an improvement on the first through the sheer speed of the game and size of the challenge. I did think the idea of rescuing Tails was a right cop-out, but this is an 8-bit machine after all and what you get with Sonic 2 is the best that can be done with the machine. Top stuff. TIM BOONE DASTARDLY DOC IN DO-GOODER DRAMA! Robotnik wasn't the nicest of chaps in the original Sonic game, but it seems that he's gone through a bit of a character transformation in the sequel! The good doctor crops up at opportune moments to help Sonic out in times of stress for instance, just as our hero is about to fall into a quite nasty lava pit in the first level, up pops Robotnik to snatch him away from the danger and carry him to terra firma. What a boy, eh? STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES ALL SORTS 9 BJEG Sonic is one hard and fast hedgehog, sure, but even our spiny hero needs a bit of a helping hand sometimes. Which is why, dotted around the stages, are little television screens which, when Sonic spin-jumps onto them, provide helpful stuff to give our lad a bit of extra oomph! Pick up sparkly stars to make him invincible for a short time; grab Sonic faces to give our boy an extra life; collect TV rings to be rewarded with ten, erm, rings; all this and more can be found if you know where to look!

"3 PAGE REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO 00 PLATFORM BY ACCLAIM .00 ITCHY AND SCRATCHY Dart Simpson doing his homework? Now there's a turn-up for the books! But yes, he's got a project to finish, so he's slaving away well into the night in an attempt to get it done. But the later it gets, the wearier Bart becomes until he slumps over his papers and dozes off into a dream. And what a dream! The pages of his project are blown out of the window and Bart must retrieve them, otherwise it's curtains for young Simpson in class in the morning. So pick up the joypad and become the tenacious ten-year old in what has to be his wackiest adventure yet! Bart has stumbled into an episode of his favourite cartoon The Itchy And Scratchy Show and he's the poor soul attracting the attentions, of the homicidal cat and mouse duo! Armed with a mallet, Bart has to hit the loony toons over the head not easy, as they're both heavily armed with the likes of bazookas, flame throwers and even carving knives! Bartholomew, in retaliation, can attack his foes which also include exploding lightbulbs and fire-breathing vacuum cleaners with an assortment of goodies which include fire extinguishers, sucker-guns and exploding cans of cola! \"THEY FIGHT, THEY FIGHT,THEY FIGHTANDFIGHTANDFIGHT, THEY FIGHTANDFIGHTAND FIGHTANDFIGHANDFIG HTANDFIGHT......THE ITCHY AND SCRATCHY SHOW!\" THANKS... to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the review cartridge. TEMPLE TOMFOOLERY The boy in the hat is back! Except, he hasn't got a hat on! Yes, Bart takes on the role of Indy actually, Idaho Simpson is how he's known to find the missing homework in the Lost Temple Of Maggie! Blue demons stalk our hero, and some of the blocks he stands on crumble away and cause the kid to fall into the fiery depths! But there are eggs to collect which give Bart another go, and the knowledge that, if he gets to the end, he receives another piece of his project and a better grade at school! BART'S TEMPLE OF DOOM! BART'S BLOODSTREAM Now this is weird! You're inside your own body, bursting rogue viruses with your hand-pump and picking up Smilin' Joe Fission along the way, in order to break the forcefield and collect a page of your homework! There are two types of nasty virus the British Tommy Virus and, in the pointed hat, the Von Gut-U Virus. If Bart touches either of them, or should he be hit by their bullets, it's curtains for the youngster. Oh no! Don't have a cow, man, but this latest Simpsons game really is the tops! Bart's Nightmare incorporates a whole load of different game styles and famous Simpsons characters, all of which come together to create without doubt the best Bart license yet! Sure, we've seen it all before, but there are in effect six different games on this cartridge, each one well worth playing my personal favourite has to be Itchy And Scratchy, as it captures the feel of the mad cat and mouse duo perfectly; you'll crease up when you see Itchy run onto the screen with an enormous bazooka! Graphically, Bart's Nightmare is a treat the characters look and act exactly as they do in the cartoon, which only adds to the overall atmosphere, and while sound isn't incredible, it more than serves it's purpose. It might be nightmarish for Bart, but you'll be in a dreamland playing this game. It's just a pity there isn't a McBain game how about it, Acclaim? CVG 028 PAUL RAND "

Thank Groening, then, that this one's totally fabulous! Practically every character from the show appears, to do battle with Bart in his dreams. The brilliant humour contained in the cartoon has been injected into the game in abundance, from the chilling reptilian scenes of destruction with Bart's mum as Momthra a huge flying insect with Marge's head to the toxic belching of Barney Gumble, who attacks you astride a cross eyed flying pink elephant! The whole package is like watching an episode of the Simpsons for real, especially when you get sucked into the Itchy and Scratchy show and the threesome dash around the screen, bashing each other with hammers and bazookas! If you haven't got Sky and refuse to pay a tenner for two episodes of video, Bart's Nightmare is a great substitute! STEVE KEEN BATTY BARTMAN BLUES Mild-mannered Bart Simpson he may not be, but in his dreams the lad becomes Bartman, righter-of-wrongs and doer-of-daring-deeds.

DICKENS (E ALGEBRA After the rather flat Bart vs The Space Mutants / was a little apprehensive about another game starring the yellowskinned underachiever. Thankfully though, this is a totally different story. Bart's Nightmare didn't look too great at first, the stroll-along-the-street-dodgingthings gameplay just didn't really appeal, but that was before I realised that it was only a tiny part of the game. Bart's Nightmare is absolutely stuffed to bursting point with sub-games, some of which could even be turned into their own game especially the Itchy and SHHH...I'M STUDYIN', MAN! Scratchy Show. The hilarious feel of the cartoon has been captured perfectly and the inclusion of all the different Simpsons characters such as Barney Gumble, Smithers and, of course, Itchy and Scratchy, lends a real cartoony atmosphere to the proceedings.

"GG GVE REVIEW CAUTION MEGA CD SHOOT EM UP BYWOLFTEAM $50.00 There's not a lot that hasn't been done or seen in and around the streets of America but helicopter warfare? That's a new one! The good old US of A has been swamped by enemy forces from the Grand Canyon to Easter Island, and all that stands between them and total domination of the world is you and your state-of-the-art Thunder Chopper. It's going to be tough, but being in control of a helicopter the size of a small battleship at least gives you a fighting chance! THIINDERS NEWISNO CHOCKACHO CKACHOCKA There's no denying that Thunder Storm's graphics are well tasty, but what really grabs you by the throat are the incredible sound effects in the game! There's tons of sampled speech which screeches out telling you which way to fly, and the explosions and sounds of the helicopters tearing through the skies are phenomenal! PHUDAPHUDAPHUDAPHUDA Thunder Storm's a hard nut to crack, but you can make things easier by changing the speed of the homicidal attack vehicles. On the other hand, if you then find the game a touch too easy at the bog standard tortoise pace, you can also turn off the automatic sighting and locking system and just fight with the cursor sight. DANGER Thunder Storm FX will blow you away when you see it moving. The scenes are breathtaking as the chopper pivots and swings in all directions. It hovers, moves around objects and turns on a sixpence to squeeze inbetween buildings and down streets. The game is incredibly fast, with loads of craft to destroy including tanks, gun emplacements and bombers. Although FX looks smart there's not a lot in the way of playability. For a start, most of the flying is done by computer and you don't control the helicopter at all you only need change it's direction when told to or when the arrow at the bottom of the screen flashes and points you the correct way all you're really controlling is the cursor in the centre of the screen that directs your fire. Also, the enemy_don't change their attacking patterns, so it's simply a case of learning where the next fighter's coming from and putting the cursor there, ready to fire. As it stands, Thunder Storm FX is a lot of fun, but don't expect to be playing it forever. STEVE KEEN CVG 032 020000 171900 : 1000 5 COFE H: SCOEE "


"CAUTION ! HVE 000 010000 137100 WISSAWISSAWISSAWISSA FX is armed with the latest multi-round Vulcan machine-guns for close quarter blanket firing, and smart homing missiles. When using the Vulcans you'll have to wait till you see the whites of their eyes before shooting, as the guns can only fire a certain amount of rounds before stopping to reload, leaving you momentarily defenceless. There's also a sight that locks in on your targets, turning from yellow to red when they're in range. Well handy, eh? THANKS. to Cambridge Consoles (0223 211733) for the the CD used in this review. TORM Blimey! When I first saw Thunder Force FX I nearly dropped a load in my shorts, then when I played it I did! Graphics are superb you won't believe your eyes as explosion after explosion covers the screen, falling bits of masonry and twisted metal hurtle past your cockpit and flak slices you machine in two, leaving it gutted and crippled on the deck. It sounds just as good as it looks, even though the computer pilot can't always tell his left from his right when he's giving emergency evasive instructions. You can forget about any scoring system with the game; it's so hard you'll be too busy trying to keep alive to notch up points. Gameplay is shallow, yes, but when it comes to the crunch, this is the kind of game Mega CD owners have been waiting for and when you think that Thunder Storm FX only scratches the surface of the Mega CD's potential, the future looks very bright. PAUL RAND STRATEGY SKILL CHOPPACHO PPACHOPPA DANGER The battle kicks of in New York as a whole squadron of enemy helicopters fly out of the sun at you. The first two use the Statue of Liberty for cover before you send them packing with a few well placed rockets. All kills are accompanied by spectacular thermo explosions, and if you should take a hit the computer switches to an outside view and you'll be treated' to a brilliant animation showing the missile ripping through your bird amidst plumes of fire, smoke and debris before it splashes down.

"hymy BLURRRRRRPPPP! Welcome to another slice of life and laughter with Yob's Mailbag, chock full of the upchuck you lot keep bothering me with.

I really love reading all the games reviewed in your mag and hope Dear YOB I think CVG is a cool magazine and read you keep it up.

More snippets whenever I can be bothered. NO, DON'T TOUCH IT THE INHALER KEPT GETTING STUCK THESE ARE HARD THERE! TO SWALLOW Dear YOB Dear YOB, I'm getting really peeved off with Megadrive and Nintendo owners complaining ear Yob, In a recent issue Kwasi Mensah was about whether or not their games should appear on the other format. I would like to think your Mag is the biz. The news, slagging all the Amstrad owners. I own see the likes of Mario and Sonic appearing on the Amiga. It's not as if the Amiga reviews, and competitions are great but both an Amstrad and a Megadrive and I owners complain when games that have appeared on he Amiga come out on a what really does it for me is the design!! would like to point out that some console. Take for instance brilliant games like: Mega lo Mania, Lotus, Utopia, Whoever does it must be an extremely Amstrad games like Laser Squad and James Pond, the list is endless.

"WARM YOUR HANDS FIRST Dear YOB I am at my wits' end with this jerk at school. He's called (name deleted to protect the guilty YOB) and he thinks consoles are going to go \"out\" and PCs will dominate the games market. What a load of dog turd. Sure, they're good for sims, but nothing else. He even thinks your mag is crap and those sad 10493724 page PC mags are good fun and a laugh to read. I would be pleased if you could insult him for me. I would beat him to a mash of blood and tissue but that would prove there was something in it. Now for some questions: 1. How is it Sega keep up their constant amount of crap games? 2. Why don't consoles work after you've taken them apart and put Micro Machines between the circuits? CHRIS GALE Petersfield YOB: 1. Because you don't read CVG enough and therefore couldn't tell a decent Sega game if it hit you between the eyes. 2. Because their inbuilt Cretin Detection Chips register \"Chris Dale Positive\" and the machine immediately shuts down. AND NOTHING HAPPENS Dear YOB What is wrong with games companies these days? I have a Megadrive with twelve games which I think are smashing, but there is one thing which disappoints me about them none of them is original! The programmers should at least put more variety into the games if not originality. They should also make more simultaneous two-player games (wouldn't it be fun to play Road Rash, Zero Wing or Starflight in simultaneous two-player mode)? Just recently I bought Zero Wing and enjoyed it very much, but I bet you that without the addition of the Tractor Beam and the \"collecting-the-same-weapon-icon-seven-times-produces-the-mega-death-weapon\" that I would get bored of it extremely quickly. Couldn't you write to these programmers and explain to them about the case of originality and maybe give them a few ideas of your own? JON DO London YOB: Dear Software Producers, Here's a quick idea for a game. It's an upside down backwards scrollingshoot-em up called Do In Do in which you take control of this sad little character with a made-up name called Do and attempt to get rid of him however you can. Triouble is, he just won't go away and sticks around on the screen boring everyone's pants off all day.

MY TROUSERS WON'T FIT ANYMORE Dear Sadie, Not a high score this time but a letter asking a small favour. As I think you are absolutely beautiful, I was wondering if it would be too much to ask for a few photos of yourself as I cannot appreciate your beauty from the same photos. Thank you very much and I look forward to receiving your reply. OMIR MURAT Hatfield, Herts. PS If you don't mind, would you send me the pictures of you in a swimsuit please.

"EVE REVIEW PVC CHTING NEO GEO BEAT 'EM UP BY SNK  he console world going crazyape-bonkers in a desperate bid to scrape together a Street Fighter 2 clone of their own. After SNK's disappointing copy-cat, World Heroes (reviewed last month),The Neo Geo giants aren't about to give up and have thrust out yet another in Art Of Fighting! To their credit this one's a bit different -but only a bit. DON'T FANCY YOURS MUCH This part is not the place for wimps, and from the eight characters you've got to choose from when grappling a friend you'll find a complete motley crew of wasters and misfits. There's an amateur boxing champ, a gangland boss, a master of Chinese martial arts and the usual assortment of street tough guys. One of the characters is even called Ryo and is a young karate expert, Wonder where that idea came from? ATTENTION TO DETAIL Extra special attention to detail is one feature of this fighting feast. The backdrops are incredibly detailed with loads of atmosphere, occasionally managing to rival those in Streetfighter 2! The back alley scene is especially cool it's lit by a burning oil drum and a sea of fumes writhe about under your feet! CONTINUE 16 MIMO TOMARD ENEMIES' ROCK, PRE BUTTON FOR FLYING BACK KICK. A MOST EXCELLENT (GAME... So why isn't Art of Fighting a patch on Street Fighter 2? For one thing the sprite's graphics, although detailed look like cardboard cutouts compared to the fantastic backgrounds on which they fight. The animation only just covers the basic frames needed to make them look like they're really fighting and when you get down to a bare knuckle dust up it's really quite hard to see who's hit who until you separate and look at the damage meter. When someone lets lose with some magic it's nearly impossible to get out of the way as Fireballs travel faster than an Intercity 125 from Birmingham. Other moves take so long to perform you'll never get them off the ground before the opponent's broken your jaw! So far this is the best clone seen on the Neo Geo, but as we've said before almost no game's worth  and this certainly isn't. STEVE KEEN GRAPHICS % SOUND % GAMEPLAY % VALUE KISSING COUSINS As you'd expect the game is uncannily close to it's Capcom cousin, right down to a vast majority of the moves. Robert Garcia, one of the many Karate characters, performs a nifty flying flame kick ending in a round which sends opponents flying. His other special powers, the flying Uppercut and Red Fireball, are exactly the same as Capcom's Dragon Punch and Fireball. Joystick and button combinations are of the same stuff too.

"LUG REVIEW DOUGD SUPER NINTENDO SPORT SIM BY TECHNOS .99 Je've had every sports simulation under the sun, so it stands to reason that sooner or later someone would come out with a ten pin bowling sim! The rules of the game are simple knock down ten pins at the end of a wooden lane by throwing balls at them. Easy as that. So what's the game got to offer? GAME FOR A LAUGH Probably 'cos they realised that the bowling game would become a bit of a bore, the lads have stuck a couple of extra features on the cartridge to jazz it up a bit. You can practise those tricky shots on a special screen that lets you lay down the pins wherever you want. There's also a hybrid golf game set over ten 'holes', in which the SNES sets down a series of incomplete pins and you've got to smash them down for bogeys and eagles, or at least for the recommended par! A MOST EXCELLENT (GAME... NOT ODIGDIGO WALK BEFORE YOU RUN THANKS. ..to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the Review cartridge. Up to four players can enter the Turkey Bowl tournament and each one can choose from differentlyweighted balls. Not only that, you can also choose whether you're left or right-handed, how greasy you want the lanes to be and either a normal or hard game. Coo! STRIKING OUT If you've ever been ten-pin bowling with a load of mates you'll i know what a brilliant laugh it can be. Mind you, this noble art has been attempted on computer screens before without much success. So why anyone would want to try again is almost as amazing as trying to imagine who would buy it! Playing Super Bowling in normal mode is incredibly easy and you'll get a spare every time, whilst in hard mode the only difference is that the introduction of a meter that gauges the accuracy of your shots. The bowling golf game is a slight chuckle, but only until you realise that for a lot less money than the cartridge costs you could be out doing the real thing. It's presented well enough, but it's just the concept of bowling on consoles that doesn't 'strike' me at all. STEVE KEEN GRAPHICS % SOUND % GAMEPLAY % VALUE % If you want to be a top scorer you'll have to master the spin for those extra-tricky split pin shots. First set your aim, then move your player. Select left or right-hand curl and let loose with the power. After you've sent the ball down the lane there's a smidgen of time left for correcting your aim before you reach the point of no return and the ball slams into the back of the pack.

"EVE REVIEW GVG RAMPART SUPER NINTENDO BATTLE SIM BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .00 edieval England was a pretty violent place what with all those castles, knights, cannons and things. It was the kind of place where people didn't think twice about sticking a cannonball down someone's throat to get their own way and that's just what this is all about. Rampart is one mean strategy game which has you blowing up the enemy's defences in order to take his castle by seige. The game went down well in the arcades and is in the process of being converted to loads of machines. The latest is the SNES version, so read on and find out all about it LOOK AT THIS PLACE READY! AIM! FIRE! Choose your castle and defend it to the hilt against bombardment from enemy ships! After all the destruction has taken place you're given thirty seconds to try and repair all the damage, which can be a bit difficult. To do this you're given stone blocks in a random order (just like Tetris) and you have to try and build your defences with it. You can also rotate them to make them fit. But hurry the cannons are smoking! DEAD AS TWO SHORT PLANKS One of the best parts of Rampart (and certainly the most fun) is putting your opponent to death once he's been defeated. You get to control a pirate with a sword and make your pal walk the plank by prodding him with it until he falls off. Hurrah! THANKS... ..to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the Review cartridge. TO CANNONS AND MORE CANNONS If you've got no friends and therefore nobody to play against, fear notyou can always take on the machine, but it will be a different game. If you play the computer you've got to defend your castle against attacks from the advancing pirates but if you play against your pal then it's castle against castle japery abound. Two player is far more competitive and a lot more fun. I'd actually never played Rampart on anything until this SNES version came into the office and now I can't stop playing it. I'm not usually a fan of self confessed strategy games but this is really enjoyable. There's so much satisfaction in seeing your mate desperately trying to defend his tiny little stronghold against an attack from your Empire then seeing him attempting rebuild it knowing full well that it'll be in bits inside of ten seconds. Graphics are very simple and boring but the gameplay is so absorbing that you don't notice that. Not particularly great in one player mode but get a mate and it's a riot! Great fun.

"EVE REVIEW MEGADRIVE THANKS... to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the review cartridge. SHOOT EM UP BY ARENA .00 THERE'S A NEW PLAYER IN TOWN! NO, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH Harrigan begins his search for the truth in the city streets which, in the year 1997. are crawling with Jamaican and Colombian drug gang members. From there, it's on to the rooftops for more baddy-blasting, then a quick hop back to the city centre. After reports of horrific deaths in the underground system, Harrigan goes down into the subway to practice his shooting aim, before picking up the trail of the FBI who are, for reasons which unfold during the game, are ensconced in an LA slaughterhouse, | 33100 Then Arnie sorry, Dutch Schaefer destroyed the Predator in the jungle, it was thought that that would be the last the world would see of the alien hunters. So it has come as something of a shock to the LAPD to find innumerable dismembered corpses lying around the city streets. The cops think all this nastiness is being perpetrated by drug gangs, but Lt Michael Harrigan has a nagging doubt in the back of his mind. Why, for instance, would the Special Projects Division of the FBI be sniffing around an ordinary narcotics case? Something is afoot and Harrigan wants to know about it. Obviously, the main threat, due to the sheer numbers of them on the streets are the members of the opposing drug gangs. They're armed to the teeth with knives, pistols and sub-machine guns. Most of them are on foot, but some of them bomb around in taxis, on motorbikes and, in the air, in well-armed helicopters. Bad enough, you may think, and you'd be right. But add the Predator, with its deadly array of alien weaponry to hand, and you're looking at a task that's not going to be terribly easy to complete. ) 4240 DECISIONS, DECIS ions. WELL, IFIGURED HE WASN'T A VEGETARIAN! LEVEL 6 THE STREET Whereas the original movie, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers (Appollo Creed from the Rocky movies and Jesse 'The Body' Ventura from WCW Wrestling, took place in the jungle, Predator 2 moves the alien-busting thrills to the heart of Los Angeles. Starring Danny Glover as the unstable Lt Michael P Harrigan, the film is set in the year 1997 against a backdrop of warring drug gangs. Particularly nasty murders are being committed and, although they're generally believed to be caused by the gangs they are, of course, the handiwork of the Predator. Harrigan stumbles onto the trail of the alien big-game hunter via an FBI Special Projects team, discovering in the process that this time, the Predator isn't alone. While not a patch on the first film, Predator 2 is an enjoyable action movie with quite a good twist at the end get it out on video and see for yourself! OK, SO WHO'S NEXT? 5,3740 It seems I was one of the few people to actually enjoy the Predator 2 film everyone else always compares it with original blockbuster, which it's never going to live up to. As far as the game goes, Predator 2 follows the plot of the movie quite closely, turning the action into a shoot 'em up along the lines of Gauntlet and Crackdown. And it's not that bad, as it happens. Graphically the game's something of a stiff, especially the between-level stills from the film which look as though they've been cobbled together by a cack-handed five year old. One 'interesting' graphical feature occurs when the Predator gets a bead on either yourself or one of the hostages they explode in a mass of writhing flesh! Gameplay wise, Predator 2 is quite basic, yet reasonably enjoyable but avoid Easy level like the plague! And it's a bad idea to include a Password system, too. No great shakes, Predator 2, but still worthy of attention. One of the main aims of the game is to rescue a number of hostages on each level, before you're wiped out by the gangs or the hostages are 'got' by the Predator. You can tell when the alien has one of them in its sights the familiar three-dot infra red scanner appears on-screen and travels in the direction of the nearest hostage. Get to him before the lights do, or else he'll go up in a puff of guts! GVG 048 PAUL RAND "


"REVIW.GUE LEA SA ** PASSER CAROUFLAGE PIESNE 10 HOSTASES To be perfectly honest I wasn't exactly impressed when I first saw this game, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Graphically Predator 2 is a bit flat, with pretty boring and uninspiring backdrops, especially those on the rooftop level. But as we all know, the pics don't count for squat if the gameplay is up to scratchand thankfully it is. It's a bit of a cross between Smash TV and Crackdown, with an huge amount of baddies on screen at once. The game starts off reasonably easy, but by level three things start to get tough. The only real gripe is that the presence of the Predator is a bit of a non event a case of shoving him in somewhere to warrant the licence. Overall a good game that compliments a reasonable film very well. PAUL ANGLIN STRATEGY SKILL ONE UGLY MOTHER With all this death and mayhem being created by both Harrigan and the drug lords, the Predator is free to concentrate on collecting his grue some_trophies without fear of detection. However, it makes quite a big mistake by knocking off innocent passengers on the underground, bringing Harrigan into the subway with the express intention of uncov. ering the truth behind the murders. The Subway level is the first time you get to see the Predator and, with the arsenal it carries around, you're really gonna wish Schwarzenegger was back.

"Ryu is the Japanese warrior straight from the streets. His only friend is the ageing martial arts master Sheng Long, who has raised him as his own son and passed on all he knows in the ancient arts of oriental fighting. Ryu is already a great fighter, but he is young and needs to learn to control his awesome powers and not get carried away in the heat of combat. Special combat moves are the Dragon Punch, Hurricane Kick and Fireball.

"KILLER COMBINATIONS WITH TDI RATINGS (Total Damage Inflicted) 1. A flying kick forwards with full power followed by a low kick and powering in at close quarters with a standing axe kick. Best attempt ed at the edge of the screen TDI:53% 2. Use either of Ryu's bone crunching body throws followed by a standing kick, full power. TDI:46% 3. Attack with a high flying kick forwards, swoop down for a low kick and thunder up with an upper cut. TDI:53% 4 Use the spectacular helicopter kick from any distance to score a hit and then foot-sweep. TDI Rating varies with the amount of hits scored with helicopter kick. TDI:45% Ryan 5613 5. Killer attack: Jump over the opponent and land directly behind. As he's disorientated throw him backwards then, as he staggers up, let rip with a ferocious Fireball timed to catch him as he's getting to his feet and jump in with a flying kick. TDI:45% WINNING TACTICS DHALSIM: The rubber devil is useless from a long distance, so launch Fireballs and move in with aerial attacks avoiding his spindly arms. Strike hardest as he retreats, but be ready to do a runner if he unleashes the Yoga Flame! CHUN LI: Upper cuts are your answer. Chun Li likes the aerial attacks, so smack her in the gob every time she comes down. Her only defence against this is the foot stomp, so wait for the right moment and SMASH! These attacks need to be well-timed, though. GUILE: Guile is extremely fast and loves to get stuck in with punches, kicks throws and the whole arsenal. Don't go to him, bide your time and let him come to you. Fireballs, roundhouse kicks catching him in mid air and uppercuts are the best way of dropping him for the count. ZANGIER This man mountain is vulnerable to just about everything except flying kicks forward. Keep your distance until he's seeing stars from your Fireballs then get in for the throws and a big finish. BLANKA: The Brazilian Beast hates flying kicks and is easy to stun with Fireballs. Jumping, HONDA: The fat boy is slow and if you're to and fro over his head drives him wild and leaves quick an easy throw is available at the very start, him open to body throw attacks for full power but after that keep away. Stand jump kick and damage. Fireball him into submission. "

"Blanka is the weirdo in the pack. A kind of yeti of the Rain Forest, he staggered out of the Amazon one day to the amazement and fear of the locals. Being half man and half beast he harnesses incredible strength and aggressive fighting abilities, not to mention the fact that he has managed to harness the powers of the elements with his paralysing bolts of electricity that are thrown out at will. His special combat moves are the Rolling Attack and Electric Shock.

Fly in with a high jumping kick and swivel around for the sweeping kick. TDI:33% 3. Jump in again with the flying kick followed by an upper cut and a sweeping back kick. TDI:48% 24, 4. Standing within range of the opponent, back flip and then crouch for the back kick and move in close for the double head butt. TDI:62% 5. Killer attack: Get in very close and keep pushing in the forward direction. Perform a double knee to the groin and feed on the face. TDI:65% WINNING TACTICS ZANGIEF: Easy to electrocute. Work to the head with flying punches and kicks and then drop to the ground for sweeps. Wait for him to come at you and then attack, or use electricity. HONDA: Honda was born to be attacked with the Rolling Ball. He's so short and dumpy the outstretched Blanka can jump into the air and kick the calories out of the Sumo giant. KEN/RYU: Don't jump towards them, whatever you do. Use double head butts and get in close. Small and medium kicks are useful, but time their jumps to foresee where they will land and head butt there when they come down to Earth. DHALSIM: Cannot cope with being jumped over and attacked from behind. With the back sweep you don't even have to turn around. Make him feel the power of your electricity by letting him land on you. GUILE: Conserve electric attacks because he moves too fast. Keep your distance and move in quickly with random attacks and retreat. Do not fight toe to toe, but wear him down. Jump his Sonic Booms and immediately lash back with kicks. CHUN LI: Let her drop down towards you as you loose off a bolt of electricity and watch her fry. Follow up with a back kick. Use sweeping punches to swat her out of the sky. "


"BALROG Balrog is a bit of a sad case after being a former top-ranking heavy weight boxer. He lost his title on a technicality and was unable to claw his way back into the boxing game's elite. He now haunts his old stomping ground, Las Vegas, where he's adapted his skills to fight dirty. His special combat moves are Jabs, Uppercuts and Rushing Punches. The key to beating Balrog is to capitalise on his mistakes and to make sure you've always got your guard up ready for one of his lightning fast rushes. If he catches you off guard it'll be a one way trip to hospital. KEN/RYU: Unleash Fireballs whenever you can, but in close quarters stand at screen's edge and jump up with a kick. Then drop low for effective foot sweeps. BEATING BALROG NINNI HONDA: Sucker him into GUILLE: Use the occasional using his dashing uppercut, avoid it Sonic Boom, but aim mainly for and let fly with a thumping right hanjumping kicks to the head every time der. Foot sweeps are great, but avoid he advances. Use different combinathe torpedo attack. tions to fool him. ANGER Keep your head DHALSIM: Best attack is and your guard up, block Balrog's the low body sliding technique on attacks an try and suck him into full power. Don't be fooled by it's using one of his turning punches. If rather tame appearance on screen he misses he's left wide open for it delivers major damage and can serious attack. Punch hard. quickly dispose of the boxer BLANKA: Never use the a Rolling Attack as Balrog is far to adept at punching accurately and will flatten you every time. Stand your ground and flatten him with a series of jumping kicks and foot sweeps CASLO CHUN LI: Jump around and smash in with low sweeping kicks and head stomps. Use screen's edge for multimple stomps (up to five can be achieved with practice). STREET GUIDE 6 "

"CHEAT MODE Welcome everybody to the one and only Cheat Mode, which this month reaches giddy new heights thanks to Paul Anglin, who takes over from Rand to deliver this month's selection of top tips, tricks and tactics as only he knows how or doesn't, as the case may be. If truth be told, Half Pint wrote last month's Cheat Mode as well, and got all stroppy because he didn't get the credit. So to shut him up you'd better fire your top stuff off to: PAUL RAND'S WORKSHY CHEAT MODE, c/o PAUL ANGLIN, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. Remember there's  worth of games for the best of the lot, so if you've got the answers we want to hear from you NOW! PARASOL STARS AMIGA No sooner do we start Cheat Mode than some berk forgets to send in his name. Anyway, whatsisname says you should type CYNIX during the game and press these keys for the following effects: C Extra Credits TGo to the final stage D Die G Kill all the nasties X Skip to the next level 1-7 Skip to that stage B Bonus screen F1-F10 Skip to that level M Get all three stars GRADIUS 3 Well done to M Beresford from North Yorkshire. No, not simply for living there but for the following top tip: for extra credits push the X button rapidly on the title screen. ENDO UNSQUADRON Russel Babbington from Ramsgate, come on down! You are our next contestant on Cheat Mode and you're well 'ard for coming up with this! There's a secret level on the option screen. Highlight the difficulty setting using joypad one and hold down A and B on controller 2. Still holding these down alter the difficulty setting on joypad one. A secret level will appear \"Game test your skills.\" Hurrah! PILOTWINGS UNUN SUPER IRVEYE mer TOTA 18480 Good old Johnny Hertford is from Essex. So am I, but that's no excuse. Anyway, he's sent in these topper codes and is therefore a bit of a lad all round! Level 2: 985266 Level 3: 394391 Level 4: 520771 Level 5: 108048 Level 6: 400718 Level 7: 773224 Level 8: 165411 Level 9: 760357 Level 10: 882943 I refuse to make any jokes about the Irish, but did you hear the one about the Irishman who forgot to put his name on this cheat? He didn't get his name printed in CVG. Boom Boom! Anyway, he says in one-on-mode it is possible to beat your opponent with ease. Just get his energy about halfway down and pin him. Then using X immediately press up and Y and he won't be able to budge an inch! "


"NSECTOR X STREETS OF RAGE TWIN COBRA Rather an oldie, but this is an ace cheat for this crusty cart which means its author gets his name right here. And he is...another dohbrain who's forgotten to include his name! When the continue screen appears push diagonally up and left and press the C button. Each time you press C you get an extra continue. Hurrah! A cheat from top girl gamer Rachael Shepherd from Trowbridge, Wilts has provided you with this fabby tip for sad street scrappers.

"ACTRA ASANZ EILLMORE elcome to CVG's complete guide to Actraiser. No sooner does the game come out on official release than Computer and Video Games prints all the answers as only we can. So here's Paul Anglin with the first part of everything you nee. Take it away young man! Are 98.4.wake. GETTING STARTED Right, once you've entered your name and arrived at the Sky Palace, the first thing to do is speed up the text because it moves so slow it's unreal. To do this go to the bottom of the icon panel and select the message speed. Once that's done it's onto battle. Go to the second icon box down, and then go along to the battle icon. The cherub will appear asking you to confirm your decision, and then it's off for death and destruction. ARIMI FILLMORE ACTI The Centaur is armed with two methods of attack he can attack with his lance as he marches forward, and he can also fire lightning bolts from the top of his lance. When he raises his lance, run in and attack him with your sword. As soon as he lowers it back off, crouch, and swing your sword but you'll have to get ready to move, as he can shift pretty quickly. To avoid the lightning, jump away as soon as the top of his lance glows blue. CREATION When the first act is completed, you will automatically be taken to the creation part where you will be given two followers and given the task of populating the area. To get started move to the \"move people\" icon and select and choose it. When you've done this a flashing yellow square should appear around the shrine. Move this in whichever direction you wish the town to develop. You're only allowed to make a certain number of moves at a time. It is better to try and make sure that in the very first move you seal a lair, but remember that you have to have at least ten members of your village to do so. Once your people start to build you will have to burn the bushes, so your people have room to build. To do this simply select the miracles icon and go to lightning. The cherub will ask you if you are sure you want to use it, and then you have to position the yellow square over the trees and press Y. Remember that the darker colour trees cannot be destroyed and that you have to destroy the rocks in the bottom corner to reveal a nice surprise. Once three lairs are sealed you will notice that you cannot get over the river to seal the final one, as you cannot build bridges. To do this get your people to pray for inspiration, and by now (if they haven't done it already) they should know TIME 225 SCO xas TIME 197 SCOI ALE PAKET cvG 068 "


"COMPLETE ISER CUTE GUIDE enough to be able to create bridges. Once they have done that, go to accept creations icon and accept the bridge. Then go to the use icon and use the bridge. Your people will now be able to build bridges and destroy the final lair. Once they have done this it's time for the second act. To start the second act go to the Sky Palace and select the battle icon and then away you go. ACT II Just steam on in! When you first arrive, hit the Minotaur as many ways as you can before he jumps. One he does so, keep moving so as he doesn't squash you. When he lands get as close as you can with your sword and hack away. Although he will hit you once every time you'll be hitting him about four times every go so don't worry just bear the pain. When you've killed the Minotaur you will be instantly transported back to the land to watch over your people. Although all problems will be solved by now and nothing else has to be destroyed, it is worth staying for a while to let your populace grow so that your powers will be enhanced. The happiness of your populace is essential in the arcade section. MONSTERS There are many different monsters throughout the game but the ones on Fillmore are as follows: Bat: This takes one hit to kill and rewards you with one spell point. Dragon: These take three hits to kill and will reward you with two spell points. If you don't stop it quick enough it'll go on and burn down your houses! stands on the bottom platform stand just level with the blue line so your sword is in line with it. This way you will be able to hit him but his lightning bolts will just falls short of you. If he is on the middle platform just move back a little and repeat the process (it may take a little while to get the positioning exact). If he is on the top platform don't bother 'cos he's dead hard to get to. When he changes into the Werewolf type thing just steam on in there, sword flashing. Once the second act is finished, return to the creation and you will soon notice that your people are unhappy. They've been working too hard and are beginning to quarrel among themselves. The only way to stop this is to give them something to soothe their tempers. This is a golden harp that plays calm music however this can only be found in Kasandora! So on you must go to the next level and return when you have it. MONSTERS The only new monsters you will find on Bloodpool is the Devils Imp. These take four shots to kill and award you with three points. If they get to your settlement they will cast a spell on your fields and the only way to break this is to send rain. KASANDORA SUPER LOODPOOL A ACT This Scorpion type creature looks terrifying but is actually quite simple. Slide down the slope and hit him once or twice. When he fires his rocks at you, just place yourself between two of them and once they have fallen clear. Go back up the slope until you see the pinchers come out of the sand and when you do just stay where you are and when they get close jump directly up (DO NOT try and jump in one direction because you won't jump high enough) then just repeat the process until he's dead. This takes practice but is very effective. CREATION When you first arrive in Kasandora make a start in watering the deserts with the rain cloud. There is absolutely tons to do, so you won't be able o do it all in one go. Clear a path from the shrine so that your people can build easier and that by the time you clear enough desert you will be strong enough to invade the lairs. When the man goes missing the only way to get him back is to move the development square over him. He may die, but a man will write some music in his memory and this can be used to calm people's nerves. So take it back to Bloodpool and use it there to increase your level. ACT II This Tutankhamen lookalike is easily defeated. When he stops at his level walk underneath him. The best thing to do is to walk to the far right of the screen, wait till he gets there and just before he gets overhead walk underneath (this is pure timing and will take practice). As soon as he has hit the floor turn around so you are facing him (get a little way away, so the edge of your sword is just touching him) and hack away. You should manage to get about three hits in before he fires his bolt. When he does this simply jump it and run to the far left of the screen but make sure you jump the arrow it fires at you. It will disappear after firing one shot. When you get to the left of the screen repeat the process until he bites the dust. ACT 1 When you arrive at the Griffin, jump over to the far right top platform and go to the very end of it. Stay there, and when the Griffin comes up to your level jump over his firebolt and hack away. You should be able to get in about two maybe three hits per jump. Provided you're in the right position there's no way you can be hit, and the only worry is the time limit. CREATION When you arrive at Bloodpool to start the creation the first thing to do is to dry up the marshes using the sunlight. You won't have enough spell points to do all of it straight away. It's possible your people won't be able to build bridges yet, so just return to the cloud and go to Fillmore. Then go to \"observe the peoESUH BLOODPOOT. ple\" and go to use offering and the bridge icon should be there. Accept it and then return to Bloodpool and go to the use offering\" and they should now be able to build bridges. When Teddy runs from home and you're asked to find him, simply fly over to the cave by the lake and you should see Teddy wandering about. Select the bread and place the circle over his head and press Y. Teddy will receive the bread and come running home. When he arrives, your people will present you with a skull. Go to use offering and select the skull. Then fly to the Devil's Imps base at the bottom of the lake. When you use it a yellow square will come up. Place this over the base and press Y. The base will be destroyed and the lake will turn back to normal. NB: it! is impossible to destroy the lair without the skull. Onto the second Act. ACT N It's possible to defeat this magician without getting hit if you're smart. When you get to him you'll notice that there are two blue lines right down the screen. If he STGEL HERBERTOO NEXT MONTH MORE PERILS IN PART TWO! 069 AVG "

"WHAT A CRACKER! Here we go with the second part of the Complete Solution to Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, thanks to Dermot Smurfit and Tim Boone. So let's get straight into the action, why don't we? INDIANA OK, you're in Crete. Walk left, take the wooden bridge to the left until you come to a surveyor's instrument. Go back across the bridge to the main area of the ruins. One of the buildings to the left holds an interesting wall mural showing how to use the thing. Outside there are several groups of stones around tall horns in the centre. Go around and push each one, eventually two statues should be revealed. Use the surveyor's instrument on each. When on the Bull Head statue align your sights with the left horn, when on the bulls tail align them on the right horn. This should result in X marks the spot. Digging at the X will yield a moonstone. Walk back right to where you first arrived in Crete and use both stones on the pedestal set in the ground. Again look at Plato's dialogue to determine the alignment of both stones. Once you get the combination right a secret door into the Labyrinth will open. Inside, pick up the first two statue heads on the shelf. In the next room whip the last statue head through the door to get it. Walk into the room with the Minotaur statue inside and whip its head. Once down the elevator, take the staff from Sternhart's remains and pick up the worldstone on the ground. In the next room you'll come across a closed door. Talk to sophia and use some underhand implications about her weight to boost her through the crawlspace. Now return to the room you've just come from and look at the waterfall. A chain will be revealed, so climb up it and go left to the closed door. Plonk all three statue heads on the shelf to open the door. Walk up the stairs and to the right to the room with the gold box in it. Use the staff to do away with the chock on the counterweight and go back down the stairs. Carry on to the right and use the staff on the statue's mouth to activate the elevator. Open the box and take it along with the two Orichalcum beads before returning it to Sophia. Place the beads into the gold box. Now walk through the previously opened door with Sophia into the adjoining rooms. Use the amber fish, it will point at Sophia. Talk to her and ask her for her necklace. Tell her you need to hide it, humour her and then suggest BI PO putting the necklace in the box. Let Sophia have her own way and use the amber fish again. In one of those rooms it will point to a wall. Use the ship's rib to uncover a secret door. Going through the door and to the right you'll find yourself in the map room. Use all three stones in the spindle in the centre of the scale model. Yet again consult your DIY handbook to discover the proper alignment of the stones. This will open one of the doors in front of you. Strut into the room ahead of you (don't forget to take the stones) and you'll have a run in with that slimy woofter Kerner. He'll run off with Sophia and the stone disks leaving you to find your own way out. Look at the the rock wall to the back of the room and then use the ship's rib to tunnel out of the Labyrinth. Outside, stroll on over to the Nazi sub and clamber down the hatch after giving El wimpo Kaptain a good right hook. In the conning tower use the intercom and go to the stern torpedo room. Now it'll be safe to descend to the lower decks unseen. Walk left and pick up some bread and cold cut, use them together to make a sandwich and then pick up the porcelain mug on the shelf. Open the trap door in the floor and go down and right to the girlie in the wall behind Sophia talk to her and tell her you have a plan and to distract the guard. Walk slightly left to the brown trickle of battery acid, fill the porcelain mug with it. Now go back up a deck and walk down to the temporarily distracted guard. Talk to the guy about buckets Sophia will do her stuff and lay the guy out cold. Walk right and descend the trap door to the right of Kerner's room. Gain entrance to the box with the acid and take the stones and the key. Use the keys to unlock the padlocked rudder control wheel. Push the wheel to get a glimpse of the sub outside. You still need to identify the other sub controls so walk back up and to the left where the dirty great big brown lever is. Pull OVDIANA TON o and the ERTE OF ATLANTIS "


"and FATE OF the ATLANTIS TRICHT FRANEWS it along with the switch to the left of it. Now only one control needs to be ID'd. Walk to the little space to the left of Kerner's room and take the plunger from the stand. Climb up to the conning tower and push the big lever. It'll break so use the plunger as a replacement. Push it again and you'll have all the necessary controls to guide the sub. Zoom around till you find the airlock it's fairly obvious and easy to get into using the rudimentary controls. Inside you'll be confronted with dark. There's a ladder to the bottom of the screen grab it and use it on the rubble. Sophia will now be kidnapped so open the stone box and take the metal rod from it. Use the Orichcalcum bead. Use the stones on the statue's spindle and align them exactly to what your last alignment was. Align the symbols away from the horns instead of towards them. The statue's mouth will open, stick a bead in there to open the doors. Make sure to take the ladder with you! Now for the fun part. All the dark shaded areas are places to be visited but the room arrangement is random ie: rooms can be in different places each game. In these rooms there are several things you need to pick up and do, some have grates that lead to other parts of the circle. Two such grates lead you to the dungeon where Sophia is being held, one of which will bring you next to a sentry statues head, pop a bead in it's head to do away with the Nazi goon watching her. Other grates will bring you out to parts of the circle sealed by rockfalls. These rooms will contain valuable items necessary to your progress. There is another of those eel figurines to be found along with a spoked wheel (in the sealed off area of the top right quadrant) and a bronze gear. If you come across a room with dismembered robot parts within then search among them for a salvageable piece. Another room has a small statue in a recess in the wall take the fish like head from it. Walking around the very outside edge of the circle will reveal rockfalls which can be visited. At one of these you'll find a skeleton. Take it's ribcage. Fighting the patrolling guards serves little purpose, so avoid them if you can they only yield miserable rations which are not strictly necessary. Once you've visited all the rooms and gained all the items return to the statue room and use the ladder on the hole to get across and grab the cup. Go to the Lava room and use the cup on the pedestal now use the fish head statue on the plaque to fill the cup with lava. Take the cup of lava to the machine room and pour it down the funnel at the top making sure you put the spoked wheel in place to the right of the large dish beforehand. The machine will spew out several Orchicalcum beads, very handy! Grab the beads and take the spoked wheel back before exciting. Head for the crab room once there use the sandwich (or the bratwurst) on the ribcage and chuck it in the pool. A crab should get trapped in there shortly when it does take the ribcage with the crab inside. Now stroll over to the sentry room and whack a bead into the eel sculpture. Whack another one into the fish statue to open the door. Once through, visit the dungeon and pick up the circular statue part from the wreck of the sentry statue. Don't bother trying to rescue Sophia. Go to the canal and give the crab in the cage to the octopus. Swim across and leap onto the raft. Ram a bead into it's mouth to get it going. Open the water gates with the stone disks drifting along will reveal a set of stairs ascend them and take the crescent gear from the open cupboard close the cupboard and look at it. The key to operating the Atlantaen statues is here. Go back to the raft and drift left to the next room. Get off the raft and drift left. Dismount and go through the archway. Use the ladder and open the chest plate. Now place the spoked wheel on the centre peg and place the strange Y shaped statue part over the top of it. Place the crescent on the two right hand pegs and the last sunlike part on the top left peg. Jam the bead down the centre hole. This will move the statue arm making more of the chain available. Now get down and use the chain with the bronze loop on the door. Get back up to the chest plate and open the door. Take the hinge pin from the floor and return it to Sophia in the dungeon. Give her the hinge pin and lift up the cage. Talk to her and tell her to brace the door with the hinge pin. Once Sophia has escaped and you've tickled her tonsils pick the cage up followed by the hinge pin. Return to the massive door via the canal and step through....... Follow Sophia into the first room where she'll be possessed by Nur-Ab-Sal. Talk to her and ask to speak to the mortal woman tell her to throw the necklace away and then look at it and slam a bead of Orichalcum, into its mouth. When she takes it off garb it and put it in the gold box kiss it goodbye Nur Ab Twat! Now saunter up the stairs and take the sceptre from the base of the weirdy skeletons. Exit the room and carry on around the hall. Take the next door along. Walk up to the tractor thingy and feed it Orichalcum. Place the hinge pin the left hand slot and the sceptre in the right hand one. Push them both forward. As you're zooming along the corridor take the lever out of the right hand slot and put it in the centre one. Put both levers in the centre position. Once the tractor has plunged to its doom click on the dark hole entrance just to the right of where you are standing to enter the great lava chamber. Use the diagram to guide your way down to the stepping stones. Here it's mainly trial and error as the stones are again set out randomly. Make sure you take note of the large spindle diagram on the back of the wall of the great chamber this tells you how to align your stones in the next room. After crossing the stones descend the stairs opposite and behold the majesty of the great colossus! Carry on down to its heart and without further ado place your stones on the spindle. Align them as they were shown in the great chamber to start up the machine. Now those Nazi type depraved people turn up once more and take over the show. When Kerner decides to be the first god, tell him about Plato's tenfold error that should take him down a peg or two (literally!) Now for the hard part. You have to convince El Chrome Dome that you really want to be an angry god that will punish him sorely. By doing this he'll get nervous and decide to be a god first. Be very careful not to become a short term god yourself... Good luck! "

"COMPUTER SER AND VIDEO 50 GAM33 O DRIVING GAMES GREATES GAMES GUIDE 1. LOTUS TURBO ESPRIT AMIGA/ST Reckon you're good enough to beat some of the worlds top drivers around some real mean tracks in some of the fastest cars going? Well here's your chance to find out courtesy of Gremlin. Lotus Esprit puts you in control of one of the fastest and most expensive cars on the road today and gives you a split screen rear view of the racing lark. You can race against a mate or the computer and the game can get really competitive, especially in two player mode! Many racing games are let down because of jerky or slow scrolling, but Lotus suffers from no such setbacks. The scrolling is beautifully smooth and the update among the fastest seen on the Amiga. There's a real feeling of big race tension, and the car handles like a dream for super fast driving iapery second to none! A runaway winner. » De VO X1000 RON MOJA BOGAR O 00'OR 2 OFTC 2. TOP RACER SUPER NINTENDO Bored with watching everyone race in their smart souped up motors and fancy a go yourself? No problemo grab this cart from Kemco and get racing! Top Racer gives you exactly the same view as Lotus Esprit, which is hardly surprising when you consider it's essentially the same game. You get the choice of racing four well wicked sports cars around some pretty testing tracks, and nesides being able to race against a mate you can also take part in the World Circuit! Although Top Racer makes no use whatsoever of the Super Nintendo's graphical capabilities, it does combine super fast update with frantically brilliant gameplay so good you'll probably wet yourself! 3. FORMULA ONE GRAND PRIX AMIGA/ST/PC Another top class winner from Geoff Crammond, Formula One Grand Prix puts you behind the wheel of the fastest cars known to man the Formula one racers. This superb 3D racer is stacked full to the brim of amazing graphics, brilliant sound and some highly realistic and incredibly fast gameplay. The sheer amount of alterations you can make to your car is mind boggling, and the attention to detail is truly amazing. One of the best games ever written and an essential buy for race fans everywhere. SEAR: 5 2ND 5. SUPER MONACO GP II MEGADRIVE The Monaco Grand Prix is one of the biggest events of the racing calendar, and here's your chance for the starring role! Super Monaco GP was one of the first racers on Megadrive, and one of the best until this sequel came along. Well, it's not actually a sequel more of an improved version of the original. But if you don't have either then you should buy this over the original the car still handles like a dream, the speed doesn't let up and this time round there's a stack of options to tinker with. Hurrah! 4. JAGUAR XJ220 AMIGA The Jaguar XJ220 is one of the smartest cars on the road, and thanks to Core we can all indulge in some Jag-related japery for a snippet of the squillions a real car would cost! Jaguar XJ220 is one of the fastest racers on the Amiga, and scores high in the playability stakes. The cars are very detailed and move at one helluva pace, with no hint of sprite glitch to be seen. Where this game really comes into its own is realism with stacks of options available to customise the game you want to play. More detailed than Lotus, but just a shade less fun overall. 2078 187 00573 A 123 SWM 2016 1 077\"98 LAP 13 Lun PANOLEGA WELDAMULATORE CHUPIONSHIP cvG 078 "


"I PUZZLE GAMES IUS 2. LEMMINGS AMIGA/SNES Lemmings are daft. Really daft. Well, who else walks off the edge of a cliff just because it's tradition? Fortunately, or not as the case may be, you're given many different items with which to try and save the brainless idiots from certain doom. The graphics are quite nice if a little small, but gameplay is hellishly addictive. Every level taxes your brain in different ways, making this one of the greatest games of all time. If you don't own a copy already you're an idiot who doesn't deserve one anyway. 1. TETRIS GAME BOY The all-time classic puzzler has appeared on just about every machine known to man, but the Game Boy version remains the greatest of them all! This is as near as dammit the PERFECT game we've had our Game Boys years and Tetris is still the cart which sits in the machine! Graphics are simple but effective, and sound nothing to write home about, but gameplay is what counts here and Tetris is probably the most addictive computer game you'll ever see! Worth buying a Game Boy just to play it! 20 20 20 20 20 20 3. KRUSTYS SUPER FUNHOUSE SNES/MEGADRIVE Krusty's house is a legend in its' own time, full of neat tricks and surprises but not any more! Krusty's pad has been invaded by legions of purple rats, and it's up to you to try and get them all out. Basically the game is the complete opposite of Lemmings instead of trying to save the cuddly creatures you have to kill them! Graphically very good, with cartoonstyle well animated sprites and smart backdrops, it's gameplay which really makes this one stand out. It's horribly satisfying to watch the purple terrors die in agony and you just can't help coming back for more. A brilliant game which will keep you more than entertained for ages. 4. YOSHI'S EGG NES/GAMEBOY 5. KLAX AMIGA/ST/ MEGADRIVE 20 CO2 After his Nintendo debut with the megastar plumber in Mario IV, Yoshi the dragon type dinosaur gets his own game at last! Yoshi's Egg is a Tetris done with knobs on. You've got four different platforms to use and all can be shifted around courtesy of Mario who, let's face it, has to make an appearance somewhere! The different types of icons can be arranged in scores of different combinations for stacks of points, and it's fun to learn them all. Not quite Tetris nut a great game anyway. DIAGONALS SCORE 00130 2009 909 0902 More tile arranging here. Tiles slide toward you on a conveyor belt and you have to catch them on a flipper and drop them onto the platform below in a certain order creating a Klax, and the order in which you drop them determines how many points you receive. There are tons of different types of Klaxes horizontals, verticals, diagonals and multiples for the really big points. The game starts off fairly simple but soon becomes very fast, challenging and quite horribly addictive. Excellent! +50 GVG 0 9 "


"DE STRATEG/ADVENTURE 1. ACTRAISER SNES These evil gods really are a problem aren't they? Have they got nothing better to do than pillage people's places all day? Get out there and do something about it then! Actraiser was one of the very first games on the SNES and it's still one of the best. The game is split into two parts a Rastan Saga-type slash 'em up and a smart Populous-type control the people thing. Sounds a strange mix, but it works incredibly well. The creation part is incredibly easy to get into (provided the instructions are in English!) and the game is so involved it's unreal. If you're looking for something a bit different you can't go wrong with this. PAUSE! 2. POPULOUS SNES/MEGADRIVE/AMIGA Here's your chance to do just what you've always wanted to play god. You're given an area of land full of hills ditches and other such hindrances and have the task of building a successful community. To start with you only have the power to raise or lower land but when your power increases you can create havoc with such events as earthquakes, volcanoes and floods or even Armageddon! With plenty of hidden depths and a real feeling of power running thoughout the game this one's a bit of a winner. Check it out! 3. POWERMONGER AMIGA Although seen as more of a sequel to Populous than a stand alone game, Powermoger is actually distinctly different to Bullfrog's first effort. Once again you're given control of a large bunch of people all seeking help but this time it's war! Instead of improving the land around you, it's time to take a quicker route invade and take over other settlements. With even more depth than Populous, and some would say more fun, it's a title which should not be missed. 5. PRINCE OF PERSIA The Grand Vizier Jaffa has snatched your girlie away and is holding her captive in his castle under the threat of immediate marriage. The only way to get her out is to battle your way through the twenty different Labyrinths which lay ahead, packed to bursting with traps galore. Prince of Persia has yet to be converted badly, so rest assured that whatever version you buy you're set for one of the greatest gaming treats around! 90 MINUTES LEFT 4. RAILROAD TYCOON AMIGA/ST/PC Want to build a smart railway empire spanning the entire country and sit behind a desk puffing a big cigar while your trains make millions? It may not sound like the greatest game ever, but Railroad Tycoon is actually one of the best there is. At the start of the game you're given a piffling little section of track somewhere in West Crawley and told to invest smartly, build wisely and create a massive empire of potential Orient Expresses. Will you're fleet be snapped up by Dickie Branson or will it have all the capabilities of British Rail in the Autumn? That's up to you! GVG 030 "


"ARCADE CUE 2. DEFENDER 1. STREETFIGHTER 2 It's still only a new boy in the arcades, but Capcom's Streetfighter 2 has already achieved cult status and been described as the Greatest Coin-Op Of All Time! The concept is very simple eight fighters from around the globe have gathered to beat the crap out of each other until one winner emerges as the grand champion. The reason for the success of this title was this everything! The gameplay reaches a new high, graphics are simply stunning and sound unrivalled. There's nothing quite like Streetfighter 2 and if you still haven't played the game then put that situation to rights just as soon as you can! The original horizontally scrolling shoot em up. Defender launched a lifelong tradition of shooters which is still being carried on today. For the first time, here was an arcade game with real menace. From the moment you slapped in your coins and the machine growled to begin the game, Defender was Frantic Central all the way. This was the first really tough arcader, the type of game which could take months or even years to beat and even today you'll still find people pumping coins into the machine for a blast from the past. Simply brilliant. NIN 3. STAR WARS This was released just as Star Wars fever was gripping the world with the release of the film The Empire Strikes Back. Giving you a view something like that used in StarBlade but a little more simple, Star Wars had you flying around blowing of Tie Fighters, doing away with the Death Star and generally taking on the Empire all over the show. The wireframe 3D graphics were superb for the time and the gameplay immensely addictive. An awful lot of people became an awful lot poorer after becoming hooked on this... 8355 BULUTTALY ITALY DIEM KO 5. TOTAL CARNAGE Another new boy manages to make the grade. Total Carnage is the sequel to Smash TV and manages to keep up an overwhelming amount of mayhem, death, destruction and violence on screen at once. Incorporating all the features of the original with a little more speech, more ! gameplay and, if it's possible, a larger daim on your pocket change, one of the greatest blasters of all time just got better. Grab a pocketful of silver and blast, Blast BLAST! 4. FINAL LAP II Another new boy. A lot of you may be sitting there wondering what on earth this is doing here, but the fact is that the eight player thrills and spills of Final Lap Twin just could not be ignored and so earn the game its rightful place in this most coveted of pullout guides. The action is fast and furious and with all eight players taking part it's an absolute riot which will have you at it for ages. Get that change ready and find a copy now and don't forget to take your mates along for the ride! 081 CV "

"LIETS GO TO THE NEXT CITY GIG REVIEW AVA NEXT VEGAS MEGADRIVE OOH, YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT IT LIKE THAT; YOU WANT TO HIT IT ON THE TOP!! SPORT SIM EMPTY POCKETS BYDATA EAST .99 The Side Pocket coin-op didn't exactly set the arcade world alight, but it can still beseen in a good many arcades today. There were also a lot of spin-off games as well, all invloving plenty of balls and some even some scantily clad lasses. Hurrah! IT'S A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME illiards. Pool. That game where Dthe holes are in the middle of the table. It's all the same innit? Well no, not really. For a start there are only three balls in billiards and you have to richochet the balls around the table like nobody's business. Pool is an absolute riot of skill, tension and top girlies. Whether it's seedy bars or top mansions you want to play in, Side Pocket gives you the choice of both. This is a simulation of Straight pocket Billiards, standard nine ball Pool for one or two players. And if you feel a bit flash you can try one of nineteen trick shots and show off to all and sundry! In Side Pocket you're given a choice of three different types of ball-related japery. There's the straight pocket billiards, which has you bouncing your balls off everycushion in the vicinity. Nine ball Pool quite simply sees you trying to pot all the balls in the fewest possible shots. Trick shots is the most difficult but enjoyable of the lot but one of the most spectacular shot possible and the girlies will go wild. JSCORECO Note Gone PD Poio C Feel 2 otok als de POCK CHALK AND CHEESE From time to time you'll notice that one of the many pockets will begin to flash and words will appeear on them. This means that if you pot a ball in there you'll get a smart special bonus. Don't muck abaat and go for it! HERE'S THE STRENGTH-O-METER This is a conversion of the coin-op of the same name from way back, which swallowed many of my finest pennies and still gets the odd bash to this day. This Megadrive version captures the feel of the original perfectly. Graphics are simple but move along very smoothly and sound is superb (although the music is jolly beyond belief!) The atmosphere of the game and realistic ball movement are both excellent way above any other pool sim I've ever encountered. There's absolutely no boredom to be found here and the trick shots split up the action very nicely. The shot limit is just about right, and fabulous ball inetia makes this a dream to play. Rack 'em up and rock because this game is the biz!

"FUE REVIEW NHI. A 981 MEGADRIVE SPORT SIM BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 THLPA 93? That's a bit of a Imouthful, eh? Well, it stands for National Hockey League Players Association, and this is the game of the name. The rules are very simple: get the puck into the opposition goal and stop them from getting the thing in yours. Simple eh? Not really there are all manner of methods employed to try and put you out of action permanently, so you'd better be on your toes for some top class skate action. It's party time! THE TEAMS IN A STATE If you think this game is EA Hockey 2, think again. The main change from EAH here is that instead of choosing from international teams you can take your pick from a total of twenty different state teams. You can choose from the cream of the crop from St Louis to Minnesota, Chicago to Tampa Bay. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, so make sure you get it right! WOT'S THE DIFFERENCE? PLAY IT AGAIN The question on everyboy's lips is how does this compare to EA Hockey? Well, EA said from the start this was not a sequel, simply an enhanced version a la John Madden 92. There are a number of differences between the two, but not enough to make it worth buying both. TAMPA BAY | | No sports game would be half as much fun without the now indispensable instant replay option. With controls much like a VCR, this allows you to watch that classic goal again and again or, if you prefer, view that vicious shoulder tackle that took Gretsky out of the game. The only thing missing is an option whereby you can save your fave replays. How about it guys? One Home Renter ngth Vancouver 10 Minutes O . Except ishting Right then let's get this straight this is NOT a sequel but an improved version of EA Hockey, and whilst there are a few smart changes here it's definitely not worth buying both if you have the original. Graphically it's basically the same, although the graphics do look a little crisper and the animation is slightly better. Gameplay again has remained the same but with a slightly looser control method (and more goalkeeper movement), slightly faster and more hectic pace plus a stack more options to twiddle. In fact the biggest change in the game has been made in the sound department the effects have really been beefed up to much better effect with a far more violent sound of people eating wall. All in all a brilliant game, but EAH owners should save their cash for the official follow-up.

"BUG REVIEW 000500 000465 Check it out! One of the few hostesses that hasn't wed Brucie.. LAST OFF! No sooner do the DMegadrive and Master System versions of Smash TV leave Acclaim Central than the CVG boys grab 'em both for the full Review! So if you're a Sega-owning shooter fan looking for action then this is the place to be. Take it away, lads! MASTER SYSTEM SHOOT 'EM UP Ooo! It's gift time! Grab as many prize parcels as quick as you can. BYACCLAIM .99 AS, The Number One arcade blaster has made it onto the Master System! Futuristic frolics and manic machine gun antics had arcade freaks foaming at the mouth when the hugely successful arcade monster hit the streets. MUTHERS Want to grapple with some totally over-the-top end of level bosses? They don't come much tougher than those you'll meet in Smash TV! There's Mutoid Man, who emits deadly lasers from his eyes, not to mention other angry assailants such as snakes, not-very-jolly policemen, deadly robots and super-charged tanks. Kill 'em and you beat the level. Don't and you won't. I bet this lad ate his greens when 'e were a lad! Having seen faithful versions on just about every other system, I was quite looking forward to this but as soon as the game started I reeled back in horror. Tiny, unanimated blobs flitting around the screen like demented insects, and the most awful sounds I've heard outside the Peckham abattoir! Control of the main sprite is appallingly slow compared to the speed at which the enemies rush around the screen, and there's hardly any time to dodge out of the way let alone raise your gun to them. Sprite detection is pitiful bullets and shrapnel clearly pass by you, only to deprive you of another life. PATHETIC! STEVE KEEN GRAPHICS % 36 SOUND % 37 GAMEPLAY % VALUE While the coin-op version had you controlling your character using two joysticks, Smash TV on the Sega employs a different method. Choose from three types of control you can have the gun always facing the direction you're standing, keep your weapon pointing in one direction all the time or quickly flick it around in the opposite direction. KILL FOR CASH Being a gameshow, the lucky contestants can collect a horde of prizes as they go! Appearing on each level are such goodies as pop-up toasters, video recorders and cash in abundance!

"REVIEW THE L OL! HODODDI MEGADRIVE SHOOT 'EM UP BY ACCLAIM .99 RBRAND NEW DOOD ERTS A PLENTY Smash TV is the conversion of the stunning Williams coin-op that's been gobbling up the coins of arcade goers around the world for a couple of years. A derivative of the ages-old but immensely playable Robotron 2084 arcade machine, Smash TV has recently spawned a sequel by the name of Total Carnage which looks set to be as successful as its daddy. And if the rumours are to be believed, we could be enjoying Total Carnage at home in the relatively near future watch this space! GET YOUR KIT OUT With all these guys after your blood, it's a good job that you've got some pretty nifty weapons at your disposal. You start off with a slightly cack single-shot weapon, but if you find the right pick-ups that appear throughout the levels, you'll be able able to take on the terrors using anything from a monster-mashing three-way blaster to an all-powerful rocket launcher. Don't miss 'em. Smash TV is the most popular gameshow ever. One or two contestants are placed in an arena with an assortment of mega-powerful weapons and all they have to do is stay alive. Blocking their way is an army of bad guys, tooled up to the teeth with state-of-the-art armaments and they're getting paid to try and stop you winning big money and big prizes. So grab your gun and slip into that natty one-piece cozzie. This is gonna be a bumper episode! Could do Smash TV finally better makes it onto the Megadrive and it's not that bad a job, all things considered. The main worries were how the control method would stand up and could the Megadrive cope with the sheer amount of baddies on-screen? What Acclaim have done in configure the A button to fire in the direction you're facing and the B button to shoot the opposite direction, and while it doesn't have as good a feel as the coin-op controls, it's an adequate compromise. As for slow-down, there is some, but at least everything moves around fluidly. So is Smash TV the top conversion we were hoping for? Almost, but it just fails to capture the feeling of the coin-op it doesn't move at a fast enough pace and, to tell the truth, it's a bit easy. PAUL ANGLIN TODEFELD BIG BOSS BOTHER! Every shoot 'em up has it's own end-level bad boys, but none in quite the same mould as the lads you'll meet in Smash TV! No joke, this show features some of the most horrible devils and creatures since, um, the last series of Every Second Counts! Tangle with Mutoid Man a big fat guy on caterpillar tracks with big guns in place of arms. Wrestle with a batch of snake-twin type things that just keep on coming until they're toasted. And then jostle for victory with the slick but wicked Smash TV host himself. Who said telly was bad for you?

"HUG REVIEW KOEO. cr SUPER NINTENDO SHOOT 'EM UP MIND IF I ZIP THIS UP? BY OCEAN .00 Although Robbie is equipped with some real heavy duty stuff he's still going to need to pick up some more weapons along the way. After all, you can never kill too many OCP agents. There are a few special guns to be found strewn across Old Detroit the three-way shot, useful for taking out aerial targets, the laser to rip through just about anything and the missile launcher, which does everything your hand blender can't. You can also hold all four weapons at once and access your preferred one by pressing Select TIME 256 3:32 SCORE OSS CAN YOU FLY. BOBBY? CP have finally got round to constructing Delta City and it's the first crime-free city NOT! The only problem with construcion is that there are a lot of houses in the way, so what can OCP do? Simple just bulldoze the place anyway. The thing is, Robocop is not about to let that happen so with his new arsenal of weaponry he enters the war against the re-habs (the likes of which consist of ED 209s and the all-new OTOMO) on the side of the people. So get in there and test your mettal, tin boy! Very Poor.) I had really high hopes for this, but unfortunately they were all shattered when I saw what is basically another platform shoot 'em up. This could have been forgiven if the game itself was up to scratch, but sadly that's not the 9900 case. Robo 3 is a frustrating and unoriginal game which could have been special, but a lot of opportunities have been wasted. One of the game's most annoying features is the fact that wherever you die on a level you have to go right back to the beginning, even if you die on the endlevel baddie! Gameplay is very simplistic and there's no great urge to soldier on because all you can see on the horizon is more of the same. Some of the Robocop games have been totally ace, but this just doesn't make the grade. PAUL ANGLIN GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY % VALUE The SNES platform based antics of Robocop 3 are based loosely around the ones of the film of the same name. This piece of movie mastery which is due out in about November time sees our friendly metalhead running around trying to protect the residents of an ill-fated housing estate. But OCP will have none of this and have dispatched some of the toughest guys they've got (and that's tough) to sort out the problem. It all adds up for some smart death 'n violence. Hurrah!

"FG REVIEW 100 SUPER NINTENDO SPORT SIM BY ACCLAIM .00 ROGER CLEMENS\" MVP BASEBALL he man with the funny accent picks up the bat, pulls on his cap and steps outside the door. He strolls over to the plate, ears ringing to the applause from the crowd, steps up and raises his bat. Looking out towards the pitcher, he notes the steel stare of the other's eyes. Moving his cap around he nods to the official, the pitcher winds up and release a fireball of a pitch. \"Didn't see that,\" moans the hitter. Second pitchwinds up and screams one down the centre of the plate. Another miss. It's all too much, and the hitter slams down his bat and storms off the pitch. \"Stuff this,\" he tells the crowd. \"I'm off home for a game of Roger Clemens' Baseball on the SNES!\" OUT OF TIME Your player's just about to pitch the final ball when you remember he's actually a load of old cack and couldn't throw a strop in a supermarket. What do you do? Easy call a time out and change the pitcher. Time outs can be called at any point throughout the game to change either the pitcher or batter, depending on what you're doing. They're also well handy for peeving the opposition by interrupting the flow just as soon as they've started a winning roll. Hurrah!

Quakes Pioneers THANKS... ...to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the Review cartridge. ROGER WHO? This game would be a fine old laugh if it wasn't for the annoying little niggles which ruin the gameplay. For example, how are you supposed to get anyone out when the ball travels slower than the batters running to the next base? And how come your fielders can't catch, when the computer seems to have homing beacons attached to its gloves?

"ARCADE MORTAL ss The world is getting to be a real violent place these days. Just when we thought we'd seen it all, along come these eight geezers from around the globe and kick the crepe out of each other. Why are they doing this? Just because it'll be fun to see who's the hardest, so that everyone knows to avoid him even though they'll all be dead. What do we do about it? Nowt we just sit and watch 'cos it'll be a good laugh, I mean eight of the toughest guys around beating the crap out of each other. Sounds familiar? It is! 3 FRESS START BEEN THERE. As you may have already noticed, Mortal Kombat was designed to be the strongest challenger to Capcom's runaway success, Streetfighter 2. Both have eight fighters all with their own characteristics and special moves. There are also plenty of backdrops and some smart digitised graphical effects. DONE THAT... Considering that Mortal Kombat is supposed to be the challenger for Streetfighter 2's crown, it's quite surprising how much it resembles Atari's recent beat 'em up, Pitfighter. The main reason behind this is the fact the the graphics have been digitised. The animation is very similar, but a little smoother. The backdrops though are not at all digitised. In fact they're boring and rather crap. SEEN THE FILM Ooh cor blimey guvnor, another Streetfighter Il resemblance. Yep both games feature eight different combatants (okay, so do a lot of games but I just thought I'd mention it) all with their own strengths and weaknesses. The fighters range from Cage, a guy who looks suspiciously like martial arts star Jean Claude PREMIER "


"LUB CVG Van Damme wearing glasses, to Kanou a baldy slap head with an eye just like Arnie's in Terminator! READ THE BOOK. As we all know the main success of Streetfighter 2 was the sheer depth of gameplay. The amount of different moves and combinations to discover was massive, so it's fair to assume that this would have to be a big part of Mortal Kombat. There are some pretty good (not to mention violent) moves in there. One which immediately springs to mind, is Sub Zero's harpoon manoeuvre of fantasy and destruction. The only real prob with them is that they're a bit difficult to pull off, and there's no instructions on how to do them. Bummer! Flipping 'eck, the amount of Streetfighter 2 challengers just doesn't let up! This one looked to be the most promising, and for one brief moment people thought it might even be better! Well, don't get too excited because Mortal Kombat is another that falls short of the mark. It was a nice idea to combine the brilliant graphics of Pitfighter with the superb gameplay of Streetfighter 2, but unfortunately it just hasn't paid off. The digitised sprites just don't fit with the backdrops and look as though they've been just layed on top of them. If that's not enough, it gets worse when you come to the moves they're the most important part of the game and they're all crap! Well okay, the uppercut is a bit of a laugh but that's about all. Mortal Kombat is a bold attempt to steal Streetfighter's crown, but better luck next time is probably the best way to sum it up. PAUL ANGLIN MORTAL KOMBAT GOT THE T-SHIRT! As non important as they may sometimes seem, backdrops can play a hell of an important role in a game's success, as demonstrated by Streetfighter 2. The backdrops in Mortal Kombat, as nice as some of them are, just don't have anything like the movement and interest we've come to expect. On one stage there's just a blank backdrop with a few clouds and the moon. Boo!

When they weren't teaching guttersnipes how to speak proper, the Vics found time to build a gigantic machine, a cross between one of the very first Samuel Babbage calculators, complete with spinning weights, cogs and pulleys and Battersea Power Station. Although primitive, the machine became incredibly powerful and went crazy, turning ordinary humans and household pets into razor toothed, armour-platted killing machines. They may have been complete idiots for creating the thing in the first place, but the Victorians now need some help sorting it out in this epic blast 'em up. Enter six hard nailed mercenaries for hire. The Thug, Preacher, Mercenary, Gentlemen, Navvy and Brigand. These ball breakers are armed to the teeth with over 25 weapons and a host of special destructive devices peculiar to their class. You can either play on your own taking two characters into you party or with a friend. The sprawling adventure covers four graphic worlds and 16 levels loaded with fiendish traps, puzzles and secret passages. Get you hands on sawn off shotguns, molotov cocktails and a huge amount of armament and buy, blag or blast your way through the hordes of 40 different monsters to do battle with the ultimate killing machine, the Chaos Engine! The game is due out soon and from what we've seen it's looking well tasty, with well tuned gameplay to match the fab graphics. Exclusive CVG Review soon! 202000170 000170 001 0038000 05 000050 "

"EU HOTSHOTS ROAD RASH AMIGA miga owners are in for some fast highway action with the imminent release of the smash hit Megadrive cart Road Rash. Road rash is almost the equivalent of nappy rash, but on a larger scale. To suffer from this ailment you have to be catapulted off a speeding motorbike and hurled, dragged or thrown down a rough, tarmac cov: ered highway on your bum. And funnily enough that's exactly what happens quite a lot in this ace racer from Electronic Arts! Road Rash is a completely barmy motorbike race across country in a desperate dash for pole position and the finishing line. In this race there are no rules and competitors will do anything to win, including bumping bikes off the road or even punching and kicking riders as they pass! While you're dodging mean machines and their passengers you'll also have to watch out for infuriated motorist, cross junctions, squashed hedgehogs, rocks, trees, barriers and all manner of obstacles including the odd stray cow! Some of the maniacs even carry weapons which you can grab when they're not looking and thump them back with. If you can't keep at least one hand on the handle bars you'll be hurled through the air and sent skidding forwards down the track, but you're bound to run back and pick up your bike for another go. Spawny gets Tim and Randy have already played the game and they reckon it's even faster and smoother than the Megadrive version! PLAYER B BIKE RUDE BOY Watch out for the full Review 100 soon!

"RUE HOTSHOTS LIONHEART AMIGA 03 few years ago Taito released a coin-op which took the slash 'em up world by storm. It was called Rastan Saga and featured a whopping great barbarian with an equally massive sword, which he used to hack monsters to shreds throughout his land. This latest forthcoming release from Thalion, Lionheart, pays homage to that excellent game. You control Lionheart, nasty-slayer to the stars, across eight huge levels of slicin', dicin' action. This lad Lionheart certainly knows his stuff when it comes to swordplay he can swing it in a variety of different ways, depending on the whereabouts of the enemy. He's something of an acrobat too, being able to balance on vines, swing through the trees and generally run and jump with style! We've seen an early version of the game and were dead impressed. Graphically, Lionheart is one of the best examples of the genre with extremely detailed sprites and backdrops and some superb animation of both the main character and the baddies. Thalion are predicting big things for this one and, if the finished product is as good as the pre-production version we got our hands on, we'll not be arguing with them. Watch this space for further info! 200 ADDAMS FAMILY 2 SUPER NINTENDO O a ere's a brand new version of everyone's favourite ooky and spooky saga, once again courtesy of Ocean! The player controls Pugsley around the Addams Family mansion, collecting cash and avoiding some of the craziest critters ever to grace a Super Nintendo screen! Each of the six huge levels is set in a different room in the mansion from the kitchen to the cellar to the toilet and it'll be a real battle to complete each stage! After playing an almost completed version of the game, we were in no doubt that this is even better than the original! Brilliant graphics and lots of humour leave Pugsley standing idle, for instance, and he'll whip out a sarnie and chomp away until you hit the joypad are the names of this game, and we can't wait to get our hands on a finished copy. As soon as we do, you'll be first to read about it right here! GVG 110 "
