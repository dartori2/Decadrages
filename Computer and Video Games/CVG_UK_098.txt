"THE C+VG TOP ARCADE GAMES OF 1989 NEXT 1. STUN RUNNER (ATARI) Atari's fantastic Roadblasters-in-a-tunnel race game a visual and aural experience to be savoured. 2. SUPER MONACO GP (SEGA) The fastest, most action-packed race game yet seen in the arcades. 3. WINNING RUN (NAMCO) Namco's ultra-realistic filled-3D racing simulation is a joy to drive. 4. HARD DRIVIN' (ATARI) Speed and stunt tracks are both part and parcel of this thrilling race game. 5. NARC (WILLIAMS) Ultraviolent and extremely gory but great fun as you and a partner take on a huge drugs syndicate armed with guns and rockets. 2 THE SHAPE OF GAMES TO COME JUST SOME OF THE GOODIES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAMPLE NEXT YEAR... STUN Runner was snapped up by Domark about .0002 seconds after it made its debut in the arcades. They've certainly done the business with Hard Drivin', but how will they get on with Atari's massive 3D monster? Only time will tell... WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR NEXT YEAR GAMEBOY Nintendo's fantastic Gameboy has sold well over 2,000,000 units in Japan, and is released in the UK in the early part of next year. Software is already piling up for it, with 19 titles now available in Japan. Keep your eyes peeled for a special feature early next year. ATARI LYNX The much talked about Atari Lynx will appear around Easter next year. It's certainly a stunning machine, and hopefully there'll plenty of new software to back it up when it goes on sale. We'll be first with the reviews. Activision have two film titles up their sleeves at the moment, Die Hard and The Abyss. Will they appear during 1990? Who knows... Robocop ll is released in the Cinema next year. and Ocean have got the rights to produce a computer game of the film. We can't wait. The computer game of Back to the Future Il should appear sometime during next year. As should the game of Back to the Future III... 16-BIT Another film tie-in from Ocean is Night Breed the film sounds very promising, and the game has already been in production for six months! Arcade conversions coming from Ocean are Data East's James Bond style spy game, Secret Agent and the brilliant two-player Double Dragon type combat game, Shadow Warriors. Battle Command, the follow up to Carrier Command is scheduled for a March release, and it should be a stunner... SEGA MEGADRIVE What more can we say about this great machine that you don't already know? It's going to be officially launched in the UK in April hooray!! SUPER NINTENDO The Super 16 bit Nintendo is released in Japan in July and promises to be the most powerful home machine ever seen, containing an incredible array of custom chips. We'll keep you posted closer to the date... The follow-up to Rotallator is also planned watch out for it. Hard Drivin' extra track disks are re leased by Domark early next year and, later in the year, full track editor disks. "

"PLAYMASTEREO C64 BATMAN THE MOVIE Happy Christmas!! With the Yuletide hols looming large on the horizon, thought I'd try and get together as many tips as possible on new and old games, so you can get out the games you've bought during the year (and maybe even last year) that you might not have played all the way through to the end, and give them another crack. So it's pages and pages of POKES and mini tips all the way! If you've got some tips (I'm sure you will, with plenty of time to play all those new EC1R 3AU. If you're tips are games you'll get for Christ the best of the month, you'll mas), send them in to me at: win 100 quid's worth of softPLAYMASTERS, C+VG, ware for your computer. See PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARyou! And have a happy New RINGDON LANE, LONDON, Year! zombies into giants POKE 7086,28 to make zombies carry you about (hilarious) POKE 2275,252 to make the game really fast (even When you clear the first more hilarious) level, reset the computer and When you've entered your load up the second level. Get POKE, type SYS 2128 to restkilled, rewind to the start of art the game. the second level and press play. The second level loads again, but you have unlimited lives for the rest of the game. Good one that thanks to Gerrard Morris of Belfast for that. SPEC VIGILANTE POWER DRIFT When you're going over a hill, stick to the middle of the road and you won't get hit by other cars as they always stick to the left or right hand side of the road. Here's a useful tip from Marcus Tomlow of Hodge Hill, Birmingham. Start the game in yukky colour mode and commence playing. Then press as many keys as you can at once. This takes you to the highscore table. Wait for the menu to appear, then press 1 to restart the game with infinite lives for all five levels. SEGA ACTION FIGHTER high kick every twelfth gripper you get a 5000 point bonus. If you shake a gripper off he doesn't count as one So make sure you hit or kick eleven men before you high kick. GHOSTS 'N' GOBLINS ST On the title screen, enter your name as SPECIAL and you'll start the game with A, B, C and D and will be invincible to enemy shots. You can still crash, though, so take care when you drive along the ground. AMIGA BATMAN THE MOVIE SNOOPY LEGEND OF ZELDA Danny Stevens of Stratford, London has a neat tip. Just enter your name as ZELDA and you begin the game on the second quest. Grant Maclean from Glasgow has an interesting tip. I don't know whether it works 'cos some smelly git has walked off with the office copy of the game but I'm sure there's no harm trying. When the screen with both the Batman and the Joker appears, type in JAM, keeping each key depressed for a couple of seconds before going onto the next one, and then keep pressing the M key until the screen turns upside down. When you start the game press F10 and you automatically advance a level. Now that this great conversion has been re-released on budget, I thought it was high time i doled out these old POKEs from my collection they're great fun. First of all Having trouble getting load the game, then reset the hold of that elusive blanket. computer (either a reset Well, read the following comswitch, or a cartridge with a plete solution from David reset should do the trick) and Beer who lives in the lovely type in one of the following town of Newquay (great arPOKEs.

While the Japanese EXIT planes are more maneuverable than their USA equivalFROU PROGRAM ents and armed with the deadly 20mm cannon, they lack decent armour and the Kato torpedo-bomber has no forward-firing guns. Bombers are difficult to destroy as they fly in tight formation and concentrate combined firepower upon selected targets. Armed with both front and rear-facing guns (usually!) they are vulnerable to attack from the side when possible. One very effective way of dealing with them is to fly behind and slightly below H ILDERT the bombers if correctly positioned their rear guns will not be able to revolve low enough to return fire and you can shoot them down at you leisure.

They will fire every available gun at you and, although you will have to run the gauntlet of flak, so will any enemy planes which choose to follow you. As the flak guns are very inaccurate, they have a greater possibility of hitting their own aircraft. A good diving technique is to begin the dive as normal but turn to the rear gunner screen. The altimeter will spin around like crazy, much faster than usual (so long as you remain on this screen) but remember to pull out of the dive before you hit the ocean. This is an excellent tactic to employ when avoiding pursuers or if you want to end your dive-bombing run. Unfortunately, trying this technique when climbing simply results in a stall. However, if you fly level and switch to the rear gunner screen, any distant objects which you are heading for will be much closer when you return to the pilot's screen. Therefore any fleeing planes will normally be caught up by using this method until you are within firing range. Japanese pilots occasionally try kamikaze attacks against American ships. These strikes occur if (a) the Japanese are suffering heavy losses or (b) if their warheads have missed the Japanese pilots occasion ally try kamikaze attacks against American ships.

"PEVIEW AMIGA IIIIIIIIII/ 000140dd 031-30 ship is quite a spectacular sight and it can torch more aliens than I've had hot dinners this week, though it's by no means invincible. The graphics throughout the game are nothing short of superb (especially those subaquatic boss aliens, which really are out of this world). Big, metallic spaceships and colourful backdrops pack out the screen. BUT (and this is a very big \"but\") while the sprites are large, the playing area is comparatively minute, which means dodging bullets and beasties AND keeping off the scenery is bloomin' difficult, not to mention being just a wee bit aggravating. Darius Plus isn't a bad game, by any standards though. In fact it's pretty addictive stuff, but, myself, I conguns, a droid which flies in tinued playing more to see front or behind, and two \"out the graphics than to relish the rider\" cannons which can be destructive delights of the powered up into mighty laser gameplay. And that's not beams, a bit like the ones in quite the way it should be, I Xenon II. A fully beweaponed think. PAUL GLANCEY A Neeooww! Karumpha!! the game by every possible route should stretch the game's lifespan a bit. With each new level you get a new set of scenery graphics to scroll over, but BY THE EDGE SCORE 0006700 LIUES 01 TOP 0025 PLUS Taito's three-screens-of-excitement coin-op was never a big hit in the arcades, partly because not many arcade owners could afford such a gigantic cabinet, but mainly because it just wasn't anything special in sidewaysscrolling shoot'em up terms. Luckily for The Edge, the Amiga blaster market is rather less competitive than the coin-op blaster market, so anything with pretty graphics, noisy sound effects and a modicum of gameplay is bound to do well. And that's about where Darius Plus fits into the universal scheme of things. Basically it's one of those mega space shoot 'em ups, with mega weapons making for mega kill factor. Your mission of no-mercy starts in sector one of 28. The sectors fan out and as you complete one you get a choice of two to tackle next, so completing the alien hordes stay more or less the same in their appearance and attack patterns. Taking them out makes very heavy demands on the old fire button finger, but you can kit your ship out with a powerful array of extra weapons. By flying into spiky tokens you can build up four weapon Systems the ship's main UPDATE ST and 8 bit versions should be on the shelves very soon. The ST version is going to look surprisingly similar to its Amiga counterpart, but of the Spectrum and Commodore versions, we know nothing.

Shoot them and the break in half, creating smaller balls. Shoot the halves and they break into two smaller balls, which can be shot and destroyed.

Torching the tanks is a little trickier but not beyond the abilities of an ex-Green Beret like me. I like my work, and my escapades in this game are possibly the most testing and enjoyable combat action I've seen since that last trip into 'Nam. It looks great, the weapons make nice, loud, violent noises, and there are some corking musical scores running in the background (that's not usually a feature of jungle warfare, but, shucks, I'm not complaining) PAUL \"SLY\" GLANCEY POWER IIIIIIIIIII SEGA .90 L ey!

So, off I go, armed with my trusty M-16, my trusty bow and explosive arrows, my trusty sack of time bombs, and my trusty blade between my trusty teeth. The blade is pretty useless, so it's best to hold down the trigger and spray hot lead left, right and centre. The arrows are only effective on inert targets, because for full effect the bowstring has to be pulled right back (which takes time). The time bombs are best kept for blowing up bunkers and machine gun towers. After the first level, subsequent scenes are mazes.

"OFFICIAL Advanced Dungeons & Dragons COMPUTER PRODUCT RAGON ANCE DRAGONS OF FLAME HEROES OF THE LANCE COME FORWARD... THE EVIL QUEEN OF DARKNESS GROWS IN STRENGTH. Takhisis, Queen of Darkness, and her Draconian hordes have overrun much of the homeland of Krynn, even the elven armies of Qualinost, valiant in their resistance to this evil power, struggle on the edge of defeat. It is only the returning Companions of the Lance that can halt this wave of tyranny before Krynn is consumed by evil. Freed from captivity by an elven assault column, the Companions under the guiding direction of the Cleric Goldmoon and bolstered by their success at recovering the mystical Disks of Mishakal, can once again restore a belief in the gods and unify the inhabitants of Krynn against the power of Takhisis. The Companions must move swiftly through this wartorn land, cautious of strangers but seeking compatriots and ever alert to the rapid advance of the Draconian forces. The courageous elves will finally fall, but there is one last chance to free the loyal slaves held in Pax Tharkas and join together to recover the long-lost sword Wrymslayer in that could be the vital rallying point in rekindling resistance to the plague of darkness speeping over Kryn.
