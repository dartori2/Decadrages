The figure of Hari Seldon was crucial to the trilogy the inventor of psychohistory, a sort of super-duper sociology which enabled him to mathematically predict the future course of galactic history and thus make plans to subtly influence it in the hope of shortening the ensuing dark age. Seldon's Game is therefore rather an unusual one. You are not playing against an opponent instead you find yourself matched against the forces of history, The listing I've provided for the Spectrum is just the core of Seldon's Game. It enables a phase-by-phase reconstruction of the changes of power and influence in the galaxy. Each star system has five variables associated with it power, strength, growth, centralization and ruler. The object of the game is to make one star the ruler of all the other stars in the galaxy. Which star rules which is determined by the calculation of the influence one star has over another. The formula is a little complex, but understanding it is vital if you are going to change history! The influence of star A over star B equals the power of star A divided by the distance factor. The distance factor is the square of the distance between the two stars plus the Galactic Interaction Constant, q. All this really means is that a star's influence diminishes rapidly as distance increases. The galactic interaction constant is there to provide a smoothing effect a small interaction constant will mean that distance has a dramatic effect and changes in ruler will be more localized. A large interaction constant means that distance is not as crucial and more wide-sweeping changes of power are possible. The game, as it stands, has one vital element missing star type. A star's type determines how its growth rate and centralization factor change phase by phase and it is by changing a star's type that you will be able to influence the near-inevitable course REM centralizati 9 (ns) REM growth Pins) REH Power REM ruler REM Strength REM X-Coord ins) REM y-coord ains ns): REM distance 1201 REM Random set-UP OR N=1 TOns ET Leg LET hl=h: GOSU  RETURN 100 REM REM Distance squared LET Xdex is 1) -X (52) 120 LET yday (91)-y (2) 130 LET 82 ad +x+yd tyd 140 RETURN 200 REM REM PROCESS NEXT PHASE 204 REMEDIESE BEBE 206 REM Calculate strength 210 FOR n=1 TOns 220 LET ${n} = (n +9 in) 232 NEXT 301 REM Calculate Power 310 FOR N=1 TOns 320 LET Pn) = 33% NEXT 340 FOR n=1 TOns 350 LET P apin sin)+(1-cirin 360 LET pirin) aprin) +5 in) 378 NEXT T 401 REM Appoint new ruler 402 REM ----------410 FOR N=1 TO 15 430 LET i sprin) i din rin) 448 FOR B=1 TOns 470 IFJS THEN LET LET 480 NEXT @ NEXT 495 RETURN 10 REMBO LET LLOC: LET ht=hc: GOSU LET Chera LET TI LET hl=hs: GOSU LET Sini ara rin) un 11 Etx LET ht=hx: GOSU | ity?

At last, Mike Singleton and Beyond Software have released the follow-up to the now classic Spectrum Graphic Adventure The Lords of Midnight. Doomdark's Revenge continues the saga of Morkin, son of Luxor the Moonprince who, in part two of the Midnight chronicles, has been spirited away from the liberated Land of Midnight by the evil Shareth the Heartstealer, daughter of Doomdark and twice as nasty! Doomdark introduces a new character to the Midnight set Tarithel the Fey, a very close friend of the missing Morkin. Luxor and Rorthron the wise are still around and as you explore the Icemark where this Adventure is set you discover many other interesting characters who will help or hinder your quest to rescue Morkin and destroy Shareth the Heartstealer. The game comes with a booklet which sets the scene for the game in a story written by programmer Mike Singleton. As with Midnight you get a keyboard overlay which sets out the commands you can use to move the characters around. Some new commands have been included this time like Check Place which gives information about the character's current location and Check Person, which gives details of each character's physical and mental condition. Check Battle and Check Army are the two other self explanatory commands. Check Person is a useful command as people change as you play! There are underground passages, objects to be found and baddies to be battled with. Unlike Midnight, there is only one way of winning, so Revenge mixes Adventure and strategy in equal portions. Mike has managed to enhance the graphics so the land of Icemark comes clearly to life as you play as you can see from the screen dumps on this page. Watch out for next month's special book of Adventure, free with Computer & Video Games, in which our Adventurer-in-Chief, Keith Campbell, will be bringing you a full review of this exciting new game. And don't forget you can win a copy of the Commodore version of the Lords of Midnight if you enter our great Doomdark's Revenge fighting fantasy competition which concludes this issue. Don't miss out! THE QUILL, NOTHING BUT THE QUILL! After a little detective work, I have discovered the truth about the BBC Quill! For some time now, Beeb owners have been awaiting the release of the_conversion of this masterful program for their machine. It will not exist. Fear not would be writers! All is not lost. Two companies, Gilsoft and Code Writer Limited, have come to an agreement. The latter firm will write the program and market it under their name, Adventure Writer should be available in the new year and will cost .95 for a BBC disc. "

"GAM.E.S NEWS CES THREE FOR MORE CREATIVE SPARKS ADVENTURE THREE new adventures are just about ready for release from Acornsoft of Cambridge. The Seventh Star, Quondam and Acheton are the latest in the ever-growing Acorn range. Acheton, the most expensive, just short of .00, breaks new ground, as it is disc-only with over 400 locations contained on two floppies. C&VG was granted a sneak preview of two games for the New Year from Creative Sparks, the Dangermouse people. There's a Spectrum game based on Rollerball, that futuristici ball game featured in the sci-fi film of the same name. Apparently the programmer went along to his local ice-rink and made a video of skaters in action then he went home and digitised the movement to get an accurate representation of the skating movement. And believe us it looks great. The game looks good too. Ice Palace for the 64 is a graphic adventure game set in an ice kingdom. It's a combination of real-time action and adventure with joystick controlled commands featured on several option screens. Mad Professor, again for the 64, is based on the Frankenstein legend. You play the Mad Prof who is searching for spare parts to make up a monster. He has to make a nice monster however otherwise the villagers will turn against him, so those spare parts have to come from the right places! The game features three-dimensional graphics and loads of locations. To my mind this is the pick of the bunch from Creative Sparks for the New Year. Watch out for it! A LEGENDARY PACKAGE DESIGNER OF THE MONTH NAME: Mike Singleton INGIN BORN: Wirral, Cheshire, 1951 GAMES: Lords of Midnight, Doomdark's Revenge, 3-Deep Space, Shadowfax. The now infamous Great Space Race (TGSR), unleashed on the Christmas market for Spectrum and CBM 64 users, will be distributed solely by Micro Dealer UK in a deal made with software house Legend The .95 game is Legend's followup to their highly successful Valhalla which runs on the same micros. Valhalla was distributed by Legend themselves, so, in effect, Micro Dealer is their first distributor. TGSR will be a complete entertainment package, consisting of a landscaped PVC box with security sticker, a colour poster, cassette and 40-page book inside. Peter Moxham, marketing manager, described TGSR as being in two sections the pre-race section and the face itself. A great deal of hype and pomp surrounded the game's launch and trumpets could be heard for miles around. MSX, however, doesn't look as if it's going to strike lucky with Legend, with Peel launching a blistering attack on the new industry standard. Asked if any games were planned for MSX, he said: \"I hope not.\" When asked why not, he replied crisply: \"Because I hope if fails, totally.\" \"The more machines that are on the market,\" he said, \"the more work it is for us, catering for them. MSX sales at present do not warrant support from a firm like Legend and there would have to be a million units installed before we'd touch it. It's not our job to invest in the success of a particular machine.\" So be warned!

"GA:ME:S NEWS CK FRANKIE SAYS PLAY GAMES! I.N.B.R.L.E.F Anyone familiar with Frankie Goes to Hollywood should be familiar with the proliferation of tee shirts Frankie goes to War, Frankie says Relax, Frankie goes to Bournemouth you name it, they've printed it. But we've never had Frankie going swimming. Or entering the sea, even for a paddle. You've guessed it Frankie and Ocean have got together. In a joint publishing deal which will produce the first Frankie computer game, Island (the band's record company) and software house Ocean have joined forces to produce a .95 game which will run on the Spectrum and the CBM 64. While Frankie gets into software, lurking behind this plot is the Zang Tumb Tuum (ZTT) organisation, Island's creative producers, who haven't yet christened their new offering. ZTT, Island and Ocean will all have joint copyright on the program and the band itself will receive royalties from sales (as if they haven't got enough money!). James Bradley of Island says he feels a record company's marketing strategy doesn't stop at albums and singles which is good news for music fans out there. Out this Spring, the game may be converted for other machines too, so we'll keep you informed. In the meantime, why not tell us what you think of the band's actual music? Is it that good? Some think they're utterly shocking, while others find the band totally boring, so feedback would be appreciated. Write and let us know what you think. BBC and Electron owners are being provided with two \"four packs\" from A&F software, at .95 each. Each pack contains Cylon Attack and that old favourite, Chuckie Egg. The BBC pack will also have Haunted Abbey and 180 Darts, while the Electron offering has Kamikaze and Pharaoh's Tomb thrown in. Century Communications is also catering for the BBC with The Horse Lord, an arcade game for .95 if you want the book/software package, the price goes up to .95). Starfinder, 12.95 astronomy program also runs on the Electron. Skyline Attack, an arcade game for the CBM 64, and Legend, a .95 Spectrum adventure, are also out. Master Adventurer, the new games label from Mastertronic, will give you games priced between .99 and .99. Se Kaa of Assiah and Black Crystal run on the CBM64 and Spectrum, cost .99 and .99, while Volcanic Dungeon and Finders Keepers run on the Spectrum only and are .99 and .99. 1985 is .99 and runs on the Commodore 64. The Commodore 64 has been voted Home Computer of the Year for the second year running by a panel of seven international computer magazines, the UK nomination coming from Practical Computing. Why didn't they ask us? New out under the CBS Software label are eight new games for the CBM 64 Silicon Warrior, Dragonriders of Pern, Impossible Mission, Pitstop, Breakdance. Jumpman, Lunar Outpost and Temple of Apshai. All except the last one sell for .45, cassette version, or .95 for the disc. Temple of Apshai is the odd one out at .95 and .95 respectively, and Ray Bedi, Commercial Manager, says he expects them to be available on the Spectrum and BBC in due course, while Amstrad and MSX machines may be catered for by the Spring. The Commodore 64 looks like being crushed to death by a great avalanche of new software released for it recently. We can't list all the new goodies for you, but here are some of them.... Psi Warrior and Psytron (the latter was originally made for the Spectrum) are out for .95 and .95 from Beyond Software in London. Psytron is an arcade strategy game, while Psi Warrior consists of animation. English Software in Manchester have Henry's House and Witchswitch out, each for .95, plus Soldier of Fortune at .95 while Anirog, in Horley, have released Battle Through Time, Catacombs and PC Fuzz at .95 for the cassette and .95 for the disc. The Amstrad hasn't been neglected by English Software, either. Catacombs should be converted for Amstrad owners any time now, and Flight Path 737 is already out for .95. PIRATES AND PARLIAMENT Anyone out there who enjoys pirating software should take note of the following the law scheduled for next month, you could find yourself in jail or lined a great deal of money. under a proposed change in William Powell, barrister and Conservative MP for Corby, has introduced a Private Member's Bill on Computer Software Copyright. This is the result of a campaign started by the Federation Against Software Theft (FAST), formed in July last year to strengthen the copyright law for computer Software. Donald MacLean, FAST Chairman said: \"A Private Member's Bill strengthening the law on software copyright is a solid step forward in our campaign to fight software theft, which already costs the industry  million each year and poses a direct threat to jobs, investment and innovation He continued: \"We have received enormous support from MPs of all parties and our meetings with Government Ministers make us confident that William Powell's Bill will receive backing from Government departments, As a result of this Bill, the whole computer industry can now feel confident that a solution to the problem of software theft is considerably closer.\" Charles Hendry, spokesman for FAST, confirmed the formalities. The first reading was scheduled for early December, the second in late February and the third reading in March, Describing the Bill as a \"very straightforward piece of legislation\", he said: \"The Bill sets out to establish beyond doubt that computer software is covered by the 1956 Copyright Act. Secondly, by having it covered under this, it would be a criminal rather than a civil offence.\" So, if the Bill is passed and it looks as though it will be pirating software will be a criminal offence instead. The first consequence of this is that the person bringing the action wouldn't pay any legal costs. This means that companies or individuals could take a case to court, whereas they couldn't afford to before. \"The Bill will be a deterrent and more effective penalties will come in,\" said Hendry. Currently, the maximum penalty is  up to a maximum of  for a combination of offences. Un proposed new law, anyone selling, exhibiting or possessing pirated software would face a fine up to ,000 for each offence, or prison for up to two months. For making, distributing, or importing such material, there would be an unlimited fine or up to two years imprisonment, or both. Readers, please take note. The Bill looks certain to be passed at the end of March. If you have any queries on, the Billand how it could affect you or your friends, please contact FAST in London on 01-430 2408, 22 "

"ALL THE BETTER FOR 80 COLUMNS There seem to be more QL monitors than QLs at the moment. Three different companies have launched their alternative to using a normal TV with your new Sinclair micro. If you're using the Quill word processor a lot, then a monitor is essential to read the full 80 columns. And if you're not, you'll still find it a vast improvement. Most existing monitors won't work properly with the QL as they lose the first and last few characters on a line in 80 column mode, as you must have noticed on a TV set. So special QL monitors squeeze the picture a little so that it fits in the screen. This means that using a QL monitor with, say, a BBC micro, you'll get an even more WROMIQL14 squeezed picture. Microvitec's offering (tel 0274 390011) is a 14 inch model finished in black plastic, designed to match the computer. It comes complete with a cable to connect it to the QL and costs . The display is crystal clear and rock steady. The official model recommended by Sinclair is made by Kaga. It costs  and is known as the Sinclair Vision monitor. With a 12 inch screen, it's slightly smaller than Microvitec's but, having used both, I think that the Kaga Prism's low-price monitor for display is not as good. The colours the QL.

True, it looks very smart, but still isn't in the BBC or Commodore league. The manual has been rewritten. It's now thinner, but there's lots more colour and examples. Early versions of the Spectrum Plus were recalled by Sinclair from shops when it was discovered that the keys had the nasty habit of falling off. This has now been rectified, though. In line with the \"old\" Spectrum, you get a 6-pack of free software with the machine, worth over . But unless it's software which you can find a use for, it won't have much value.

"REVlEW. SOT HIGH 05000 B'ZONE/TANK DUEL MACHINE: Spectrum SCORE 00000 SUPPLIER: Battlezone Quicksilva; 3D Tank Duel Realtime PRICE: .95 (Battlezone) .30 (3D Tank Duel) Battlezone was originally an Atari arcade game. You are in charge of a tank and your mission is to destroy the enemy tanks. Like the original, the graphics on the Spectrum version are made up of straight lines which are used to draw all the banks and missiles. Some clever programming means that the objects come towards you in 3D, with the computer performing what's known as hidden line removal. This means making sure that if one side of a tank is obscured by something, the invisible part is not drawn on screen. With Quicksilva's game, the graphics are all drawn in green on a black screen with the background the same colour. At the top, the score panel is in purple but still on black. Realtime's version is called 3D Tank Duel and has different background colours BATTLE ZONE for the land and the sky. The 3D movement is the key to a good version of Battlezone and I found Realtime's the smoother. Both games have blocks which you can use as shields and moving in and out of them produced some good effects. Realtime's also has some special features. Pressing the 4 key will copy the screen to a printer which will give you a print of the high score table if you want one. Control for both games is via keyboard or joysticks. You look at the radar at the top of the screen and manoeuvre your tank accordingly. There are four keys used to move the tank two for each track. Each can be moved forwards or backwards so to turn round at double speed you move one track in each direction. So which one to buy? Frankly, I think that Realtime's 3D Tank Duel just comes out on top and, at .45 less than the official Quicksilva offering, it's better value ENEMY IN RANGE SCORE 5000 HIGHSCORE 10000 3D Tank BattleDuelzone  Graphics 9  Sound 7  Value 8  Playability 8 but transferred to computer useful information. unless you have a match and VOLCANO You move your crudely drawn Make a wrong move and can use it to see the old map character around the you could end up trapped in a you apparently have with you MACHINE: Spectrum \"streets of the city dead end without any A nice idea — but the SUPPLIER: Computer collecting dynamite, eating dynamite to blast your way graphics are crude and the Magic food and and avoiding looters past the rocks which have game eventually too frusPRICE: .95 en route for the boat fallen across the path behind trating to be much fun.

"I Familia Even ace Adventurers have games they just can't get enough of. And C&VG's Adventure Wizard, Keith Campbell, is no exception. He has a passion for the giant Zork trilogy. Here Keith takes you on a tour of the Great Underground Empire and reveals why he thinks the Zork trilogy is so fantastic! Way back in the May 1983 issue of C&VG, I devoted a small corner of my ork is situated in a huge column to a review of a game called Zork. The game was little known at that cavern under a breathtime simply due to the fact that it was, and it still is, available only on disc.

In fact, there is so much text that playing Zork is almost adventures are based.

"partire water now flows over the top. Similarly, the aqueduct is worth viewing, though whether its mighty stone trough is worth inspecting at close quarters is a matter of much debate! So proud were the Dimwits of their achievements that they even built a technology museum. Only three exhibits now remain, but one of them is in surprisingly good shape for its age. Unfortunately, its purpose has long since been forgotten, although many an Adventurer will no doubt discover how to operate it possibly to his cost. These technological marvels were enhanced and augmented with the magic of the day. Many advanced products were marketed by Frobozz, a company specialising in magically operated devices. Some are still to be found lying around and can even be used by Adventurers clever enough to Lord Dimwit Flathead * Excessive. The Zorks had their religion, too, its beliefs now forgotten in the passing of time. However some evidence still remains. For example, their Commandment No. 12592 held a stern warning for those \"... who go around saying unto each other 'Hello Sailor The aristocracy of Zork enjoyed the good life, with well laid out gardens complete with topiary and lawns bordered with roses (some of them perfect). A favourite pastime of the excessively rich and idle was to take tea in the summer house. Such occasions were responsible for the birth of legends, for it is said that more than once a Unicorn had been spotted by an observant Zorker whilst taking tea. The Great Underground Empire is dead. Or is it? In the shadowy hillsides, faint footsteps can sometimes be heard. Lurking in a dark corner is a sneak thief, ready to pounce. A mysterious Viking boat looms silently up out of the mists on the Flathead Ocean. A young girl weeps quietly to herself, imprisoned in a cave. Fresh blood drips from a sacrificial altar J. Pierpoint Flathead. The ** Things are a-stirring down there will YOU be brave enough to enter the Great Underground Empire? PLAYING ZORK discover how. Frobozz products ranged from large devices, such as a Magic Well, to the day-to-day consumer goods like Magic Gunk and Grue Repellent an invaluable aid in failing light. Zork had its economy well organised, the local currency being the Zorkmid. A 10,000 Zorkmid piece was a priceless coin, being octagonal in shape and bearing the legend \"In Frobs we trust\". The fiscal system centred around the great Bank of Zork, where the portrait of its late founder, J. Pierpont Flathead, can still be found hanging above his desk. A somewhat controversial character and endowed with more Zorkmids than were good for him, J.P. wrote an autobiography entitled \"I'm Rich and You Aren't So There!\" Although the bank itself is now defunct and somewhat vandalised, the security system still appears to be operative, as anyone foolish enough to try to remove valuables from the premises will discover Needless to say, the vault was supplied by Frobozz. Exploitation of the man in the street by vested interests doesn't seem to have changed much throughout the ages, as the Adventurer will likely discover that the excessive Flatheads, dimwitted as they were, had a magic swindle going. This had the effect of lining their own pockets at the expense of the Bank's customers. To play the game of Zork gives the Adventurer a chance to visit and enjoy all the historic and beautiful places in the Great Underground Empire, should he be so bold. For the G.U.E. is not for the fainthearted. Not only Grues, but fierce trolls and fire-breathing dragons now roam the land. Many an adventurer running from pursuit, may meet a hungry end lost forever in a maze. An additional hazard is the very weakness of the rock strata in which Zork is situated, being prone to severe tremors. Even a small explosion could cause a major collapse within the cavern, making whole areas impassable.

Zork was written by Mark Blank Wizard of Frobozz. and Dave Lebling, who also wrote Infocom's Enchanter. Sorcerer, the sequel to Enchanter, was written by Steve Meretzky, who has also written three books based on the Zork theme.

Before long there is a blinding flash and ... you've guessed it! A choice of action is offered every two or three pages and the reader is directed to the appropriate follow-on page.

Acornsoft are also planning a tournament for the best players to compete against each other. Watch out for details in C&VG's Games News pages. Hi there, games fans! This is me, Professor Video, announcing the arrival of a brand new feature in C&VG. My very own hints and tips page! Each month Pll be picking out the best of your game playing tips and printing them on this page. The top tip each month earns the sender a crisp  note! So if you can't resist the bribe, send your tips off today to Professor Video's Games Workshop, Computer & Video Games, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. We kick off this first column with tips on Acornsoft's mega game Elite, currently riding high in the charts. ELITE These Elite tips come from G. King from the city at the centre of the universe, Croydon! Mr King is the first C&VG tipster to get the Prof's fiver. He kicks off with a warning about a bug. . Where a trade will net more than 6000 credits, the program grossly undercalculates. While you can carry 199 kg of Platinum, you won't get the price on resale. Hope for 80 credits on resale and buy only 65 kg.  While direct assaults on space stations have predictable results, attacking innocent ships in the safety area can bring the Vipers out too! Even if you manage to wipe out all the Vipers you won't be allowed into the space station. You'll break up when you hit the doors of the docking bay! You should guess this when your docking computers malfunction.  Some obvious points regarding the display. On the short range chart the \"circle\" represents your fuel line. Escape pod pressure is denoted by a shift from green and yellow to blue and white. . If you haven't already guessed, the alien items you \"scoop\" are Thargons from the alien mothership floating around after the mothership dies.  Justice for all! Pirate and police escape pods if \"scooped\" are \"slaves\" but, unlike alien items, count as normal tonnage. TACTICS 1) You are a trader first and foremost so a ship with a large cargo bay is the first priority. 2) Furs, liquor, computers and narcotics are THE items to trade. Precious gems and metals are a sideline. 3) Find a good trade area to work and work it for as long as you can stand it! 4) Mr King is currently working on galactic chart four which includes Qutius, Erlien, Zaonbi, Attendzia. All except Zaonbi are poor agricultural planets. Zaonbi is a rich hi-tech planet. All are fairly safe planets except maybe Attendzia which is in a state of anarchy. 5) To deal only in narcotics is very foolish. Hide it under some furs or computers. 20 tons of narcotics can be moved about fairly easily. 35 tons never arrive! 6) Crimes are soon forgotten and \"offender\" status is normal. But don't shoot at the police until they shoot at you! Thanks Mr King! You can add  to your credit total. Elite players are being encouraged to send their scores to Acornsoft and each month a specially convened Order of Elite committee Following up the map of Avalon which appeared in our December issue, F.R.B. Fearns wrote in with a list of hints to increase your enjoyment of the game.  You may have found a large key in the Gatehouse Level. Use this to open the locked door which leads to the Wayroom. Give the key to the wizard who appears and he will give you a pile of gold coins.  Take the coins to the room in the caverns of doom where you received the Waystone spell and give them to the wizard you find there. He will give you more coins which you need to get another spell once you reach the Mines of Madness. .Next to the room with the energising mushroom is another room with a bottle in it. This bottle can be opened with the axe which can be found nearby. But you could be in for a surprise if you open the bottle! You can also use the axe to open a chest but not in the way you think. some doors will not appear until you have solved a particular puzzle has been solved. . Once Maroc has the missile spell, he can use it to destroy goblins and Guardians. Later you may discover a device that will destroy all your enemies. UNDERWURLDE One of Professor Video's most avid students, known only as Des Claypole from Peterborough, has been hard at work beating Ultimate's Underwurlde and has passed on a few tips to an amazed Prof. Des says that there are four weapons a catapult, a bow, a knife and a burning torch. The Sabreman can only carry three at once but never fear help is here! Des says to drop the catapult as it has no specific purpose. You'll ne the other weapons to deal with specific monsters. In the Underwurlde, you often have to use a rope to descend a long way but never use a rope to go up. Always use a passing bubble. That way, if you get knocked off, you can always grab at the rope as you fall. All the ropes obey the basic laws of physics. A long rope will swing slowly, a short one quickly. You can use this to your advantage. While hanging from a long rope, set it swinging then in one movement shorten it and let go. If you have timed it right, you will be hurled most of the way across the next screen. The various diamonds lying around not only add to your score when picked up but also add to your percentage and make you invincible until the counter on the screen ticks down to zero. The Prof will bring you more from Des in the Underwurlde next issue! GAMES WORKSHOP 60 "

To resist bulging, warping, puckering, or opening up MEMOREX SOLID-SEAM BONDING: Every inch of every seam is sealed shut. Tight as a drum They seem equal. Until you look at the seams. That's where equality ends. Most companies seal their discs with a spot here, a spot there. Leaving most of each seam not sealed at all. Sooner or later, the seams might do what comes naturally: they bulge. Warp. Pucker. Open up. Pens, pencils, fingernails--even a fouryear-old's, like Herbie-can catch and snag in those wide open spaces. That's sloppy. And dangerous. Because if you put a sloppy floppy into your disc drive, it can jam your drive. Ruin your drive head. Lose your data. So much for their seams. Ours are different. THE SLOPPY FLOPPY: Scaled with a spot here, a spot there. Leaving unsealed seams everywhere To resist all the things that can jam your drive, ruin your drive head, or lose your data. Which proves that a Memorex floppy disc isn't equal to all the others. It's better. Solid-Seam Bonding is just one example of the extra care that goes into every Memorex floppy disc. Be it 8\" 5'4\" or the new 32\" Extra care that lets us guarantee every Memorex disc to be 100% error-free. The next time you're buying a floppy disc-or a few hundred of them-just remember this: It's always better to be safe than sloppy.

And the same arcade quality goes into the Wico you take home. Wico joysticks work directly with the Commodore 64, Vic 20,\"all Atari Home Computers and Atari Video Games. Add an interface, and you can connect into a Sinclair Spectrum or Apple II and Ile. If you have a new MSX computer there's the just released MSX Grip Handle for you. What do you get? Aman-sized handle on a virtually unbreakable shaft. Tough, ultra-sensitive Wico switchgear. A heavyweight base. A year's guarantee. And more sheer dodging, chasing and blasting power than ever before. The Wico range includes the famous Red Ball,\" straight out of the arcades. The Three Way Deluxe with interchangeable handles. The light but rugged Boss. And check out the state-ofthe-art Trackball: many owners use it for serious programming, where it gives them effortless cursor control. Ask your dealer to let you handle a Wico. Quality (you'll find) costs money.

"Doomdark's Revenge Part 3 Tarithel rescued Morkin last issue but now he sets off on his own quest across the inhospitable land of Icemark. This is the last in this series of Fighting Fantasy novelettes based on Beyond Software's best-selling Lords of Midnight and Doomdark's Revenge. Can you help Morkin survive the rigours of Icemark...? Turn to Competition page 30 to win Commodore 64 versions of Lords of Midnight. PART 3 MORKIN'S QUESTI In this episode of Doomdark's Revenge you take the part of Morkin, son of Luxor the Moon prince. To play you will need two dice, a pencil and a rubber. You should also take a glance down these simple rules. THE CHART The chart below enables you to keep track of the game. Every time a possession is lost it should be crossed off, every time a man is killed, he must be removed. You should also cross off lost stamina points. BATTLES If you have to fight with Morkin or his 10 Fey Warriors, this is done by using the dice. Battles are fought through a character's skill taking hits against his opponent's stamina. So, if your character's stamina is 8 and his opponent's skill is 7, every time his opponent throws 7 or under with the two dice, your stamina goes down by one point. If it reaches zero, you are dead. Stamina is not replaced. When the Fey warriors go into battle, their stamina is equal to their number. If all 10 are alive they have a stamina of 10. Each drop in stamina means one warrior less. IMORN THE ARCHER Among your troop of 10 warriors is an exceptional archer, Imorn. He may be of great use in the quest and should be kept alive if possible. SKILL Morkin starts the game with a skill of 9 and a stamina of 8. His warriors have a combined or individual skill of 9 and a stamina of 10 (one point for each of their number). Skill can be used in all sorts of situations not just battles. PLAYER CHART Morkin Skill: 9. Stamina: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Weapon: Sword or Dragon Slayer the Axe (which adds one to Skill). Possessions: Axe, Ball of Fire, Cup of Dreams MAGICAL POSSESSIONS Morkin has three magical possessions which he carries in his backpack: an axe Dragon Slayer which adds one to his skill in battles, a Ball of Fire which can give off tremendous heat and The Cup of Dreams which will revive a whole platoon of men. The Fey Imorn: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Skill: 9. 1) Tarithel, aided by her magic and a band of goodly Fey warriors, has rescued the proud Morkin from his imprisonment in the Pit of Alazorne. Morkin learns that his father, Luxor the Moonprince of Midnight, is also in the land of Icemark. Luxor and Rorthron the Wise are even now raising an army to try and defeat the mighty Shareth the Heartstealer, Empress of Icemark, Shareth it was who imprisoned Morkin to tempt Luxor into Icemark, there to trap and defeat the Moonprince. Morkin decides to send Tarithel back to the Forest of Fangrim with most of the Fey troop to rally armies to Luxor's banner. Now take the part of Morkin as he embarks on his quest with the archer Imorn and turn to number 2. 2) Before you rise the great and treacherous peaks and icy passes of the Kahortharg but you have heard tell of an underground passage through caves beneath the mountains which should bring your small party out on the other side. The Pit of Alazorne, where you were held captive, is a small collection of caves cut in the side of a deep chasm. There are passages which lead off from the bottom of the gaping hole, cut by the Dwarves and possibly still inhabited by this secretive race. Looking down into the pit, you notice that there are some small, ill-used steps cut away, leading down through almost sheer stretches of wall. Imorn recommends that you use the ropes they brought with them from the Forest of Fangrim to scale down the depths.  Do you take his advice and use the ropes? Turn to 12.  Do you decide to risk the steps? Turn to 18. 3) Over the next series of peaks and at last you come to the end of the mountains. Beneath you lies a great pass leading out onto the plains of Glormane. On the plains mass two huge armies. From the distance you recognise your father's banner flying proudly on one side with massed ranks of Fey and Barbarians. There are even some Dwarvish contingents pressed in among them. Morkin 101 "


"On the other side of the plains lie the seried ranks of Shareth's armies with Icelords and sparse legions of giants. There too are the Dwarves, ready to fight against their brethren. The two armies seem well-matched. Suddenly you notice a great commotion and the pass below you fills with a great contingent of giants. Many ride the huge elks of the mountains.

"You fans of science fantasy films have had a field-day lately, with numerous different films flooding the cinemas between autumn and Christmas. The science fantasy bonanza started on October 5 when Electric Dreams came out and there were more to come. Conan The Destroyer quickly followed and, by Christmas, Ghostbusters, Gremlins and The Last Starfighter arrived in British cinemas. The last one out was Dune which waited until January 11 before making its appearance. Some of the films have games, some not.

"commodore IN VIDEOLAND NOW ON CASSETTE! PURE MAGIC! Join Alice in her journey through Videoland an enchanted place populated by strange creatures such as bread-andbutterflies and pipe smoking caterpillars, where little girls change size and flamingos turn into croquet mallets! Alice in Videoland is a revolutionary new concept in entertainment for the Commodore 64, incorporating some of the finest graphics ever seen on any home computer, accompanied by a charming musical score. There are four different game scenes involved, and your performance in earlier ones will affect your ability to get through later ones and determine your eventual total score. Scene One Stunning title page graphics give way to the first game scene as Alice falls into the rabbit's warren. Score points for collecting the objects to be found there including keys to open doors, bottles to make her smaller, cakes to make her bigger! Scene Two Out in the garden the Cheshire cat looks on as Alice meets the pipe-smoking caterpillar. Help her to catch the bread-and-butterflies and the rocking-horse flies that change into the balls used in the croquet game in the last scene! Scene Three Alice is a pawn in the chess game where her opponents are the Jabberwocky and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Help her across the board by protecting her with your White Knights! Scene Four The most bizarre croquet game ever! Help Alice hit the balls through the playing-card-soldier hoops before the Queen of Hearts stomps on them! Alice in Videoland is available for the Commodore 64 on disk .95, and now on cassette .95. Alice in Videoland features graphics created with the Koala Pad. Audiogenico P.O. BOX 88, READING, BERKS.
