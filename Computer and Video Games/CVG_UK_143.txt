"MEET THE CVG CREW: ALL CHANGE ON CVG Whoops a lordy! The CVG Crew has shrunk a little this month as some of team have moved on to pastures new. The dynamic ones have all been courted and won by television stations. The rest have moved on to other (rather dull magazines). Regardless, those of us who worked with you, broke bread, laughed with (and at) you, salute you... You were the best! It must be true what we say about CVG having staff who are just the best games players in the world! Why? Well because two of our top staffers have left to go on to two of the best TV games shows around. Steve 'Rock and Rock' Keen has gone on to Bad influence where he'll no doubt fit in with the leather jacketed and ripped denim-wearing presenter Violet Berlin. And what of the boy Anglin? Well, he was ripped away from the CVG nest and his loving mother and cousins by none other than SKY 1's Games World Team. The rest of the team on CVG wish them the best of luck and settling down to watch the new series of the shows knowing that there's going to be a little bit of CVG magic in both of them. GARTH It's been an interesting month for Garth as he's suddnely found himself having to do some of the things that his humble staff had to do. He didn't mind gadding around the country as a top news reporter but becoming shop monitor for the team has really taken its toll! Come back Anglin! FREE KIT CORNER CVG competitions are just the best. And this is the place to scan through to see if you're one of the lucky beggars who's won 'owt fer nowt! Is your name in here? Prizes will be winging their way to you soon... PAUL Paul's month has been full of hardships too culminating with a famidy visit to his grotty Catford garret. Paul promised to go home to tidy the flat every evening for a month! Of course, Mr. Pristine never made it and his 'grim up North' family decided that London was really a dirty, smelly place. No wonder... JULIE Julie's just been appointed Art Editor of CVG (after Jon disappered), and her month has been all hard work too! She's been designing like Leonardo on dynamite, but says that she's doing for her fans. We found out that she does it for .75 per hour and a lift home with Garth every night! Lawnmower Man Compo 1st prize (LM crew Jacket, video and T-shirt): Steve Martin of Munster Gardens, Palmers Green, London N13 5DT Four Runners up (video): Alan Sheppard of Essex, Howard Doupe of Merseyside, S. Davies of Barnsley, Ben Knight of Cornwall. Four Runners-runners up (T-shirt): Kathryn Fairbrother of Portsmouth, Anthony Redden of Derbyshire, Herbert Butcher of Biggin Hill, Paul Jones of Sheffield. Terminator Compo There were only 4 correct entries to win Mindscape's SNES version of Terminator: Richard Higgins of Ayrshire, Jeffrey Knight of Cornwall, Jason Robson of Northumberland, and D.S. Colbourn of Avon. The fifth copy goes to Surrey's John Shearing even though he had Arnie's first words to Sarah Connor as Â«Come if you want to live with me\". A strange boy... French's Mustard Compo Laura Francis of Gwent, and Paul Carolan of Essex both win 4 sets of 4 tickets to see a top ice hockey match (New York Rangers vs the Toronto Maple Leafs) at Wembley. Powerplay Compo Up for grabs were 35 Turbo Cruiser joysticks, 35 Competition Pro joypads for the Mega Drive, and 35 Competition Pro Series II joypads for the SNES.

PAUL Paul had a difficult time this month too! He had SKY TV chasing him for weeks with promises of immense wealth, girls and a pop star status. All was to no avail until Anglin finally gave after they wrote into his contract..\"..and no-one is allowed to send Paul to the shop!\" What a top geezer! STEVE Mr. Managing Editor has had a great time this month! He's watched the team run around, writing, subbing, designing and arguing over who's turn it is to go the shop! Meanwhile, he's been out to lunch with all the top candidates that have applied for the vacent top jobs on the mag!!! "


"intendo release THEUSN details of a brand new super console for Christmas '94 using 64-bit technology and Reality Immersion Technology'... Sanyo tool up to produce UK 3DO... Atari release first pics of 64-bit Jaguar. NINTENDO'S 64-BIT CONSOLE IS REVEALED! KNOW HMV-KNOW GAMES MEGADRIVE CHART intendo have just announced their plans to produce an amazing 64-bit 'Super Console' and what's more, they hope to release it before the end of next year. This new product -a breakthrough in home console technology was announced in the States late last month when Nintendo revealed that they had teamed up with top computer company Silicon Graphics (SGI) to develop a true 64-bit home entertainment system. The new machine, which currently has a working title of 'Project Reality', is to be a joint development venture between US-based SGI and Nintendo and will feature something called 'Reality Immersion Technology', which is probably just meaningless jargon meant purely to impress This herd of Gallimimus from Jurassic Park was created using a the punters. What is impresSilicon Graphics computer system that can make computer animation sive about the system is the look utterly convincing Nintendo's new 64-bit machine is based on technical specification of the he similar technology. machine if it's correct (and at time of going to press, it is) it could mean that the system will turn out to be the nearest thing you'll get to an effective home Virtual Reality kit for a few years. Nintendo have, up until now, been very quiet about development especially concerning CD technology (which is still to be officially confirmed) and its newly-formed link with SGI, the company which created the incredible graphic effects for the movies Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park. If the whole thing comes off, we'll be looking at THE games machine to own. There are some questions to be answered about the machine though as yet, Nintendo haven't said what it will use as a storage device and they have been dismissive of CD based systems. Also, although the announcement will come as a breath of relief for upgrade-hungry SNES owners, the machine is still almost two years away... The Nintendo/SGI machine is due to be released into US stores in late 1994, and Nintendo are stating a ridiculously low price tag for it of $250. 1 JUNGLE STRIKE (Electronic Arts) 2 MICRO MACHINES (Sega/Codemasters) 3 BUBSY (Accolade) 4 FINAL FIGHT (Sega) 5 FLASHBACK (Sega/US Gold) 6 NIGHT TRAP (Mega-CD) (Sega) 7 X-MEN (Sega) 8 THE FLINTSTONES (Sega) 9 PGA TOUR GOLF 2 (Electronic Arts) 10 SUPER KICK OFF (Sega/US Gold) PROJECT REALITY TECH SPEC Processor: 64-bit MIPS RISC. Number of Colours: 16 million colours on screen at once. Screen Resolution: Better than NTSC or PAL TV. Clock Speed: Greater than 100MHz. Processsing Capability: Runs real-time 3D graphics. Sound: CD quality. "


"BRITISH 3DO BEFORE CHRISTMAS? Britain's first 3DO machines could be in the shops in time to make it onto Christmas shopping lists. Sanyo are the latest company to pick up a licence to produce the wonder console, and they're already looking to 3DO TECH SPEC Panasonic Processor: 32-bit RISC. Clock Speed: 12.5 MHz. Number of Colours: 16,700,000 on screen at once. Screen Resolution: 640x480 pixels. Processing Capability: 50,000,000 pixels per second. Disc Access Time: 6 Megabytes per second. Sound: Eight-channel Dolby stereo surround plus Compact Disc playback Proposed add-ons: Mouse, keyboard, full-motion video card, virtual reality glasses. Software: 3DO are promising 80 titles by Christmas, although this is rather unlikely as the sheer size and complexity of the games make development times significantly longer than normal. launch their version in the UK by the end of the year. The Sanyo 3DO is based around the uniform specifications which are laid down by the machine's inventors, The 3DO Corporation, but looks vastly different to the chunky Panasonic version with a sleek slim-line case. This won't make for a vast difference in the price, though; as both versions are manufactured overseas, the retail prices will be affected by the currency exchange rates. Whatever the result, it's likely to be in the  bracket, making it without doubt the costliest console on the market. Panasonic's 3D0 machine... Sanyo are still looking for a company to supply the software that will accompany the machine when it is released. Panasonic are already one jump ahead of them in this area; they've signed a deal with developers Crystal Dynamics to bundle 3D driving game Crash And Burn with their version of the system. A great number of top British software houses are currently developing software for 3DO, so when it's released it won't suffer from the kind of chronic game shortage which has plagued so many other new machines in ...and the sleeker Sanyo version. the past. JAGUAR TECH SPEC ATARI JAGUAR POUNCES INTO SPOTLIGHT Processor: 64-bit RISC. Clock Speed: 13.3 MHz. Number of Colours: 16.7 million. Screen Resolution: 720x576 interlaced. Sound: Stereo 16-bit CD quality sound using a DSP chip running at 27MIPS. Software: Their are 10 titles which, Atari says, will be the first ready for the machine before Christmas, two of which will be ported from other formats, (Alien vs Predator and Tiny Toon Adventures). At last! Atari's 64-bit Jaguar is unveiled! So as not to be outdone by everyone : else, Atari have finally released details of their forthcoming 64-bit console, Jaguar. The machine will feature several custom chips but the heart of the machine will remain a 68000 the same chip as used by the Megadrive. However, the machine does use four other custom chips; one to control 3D objects, another is an object processor, a DSP chip for sound and a Blitter chip (to speed the screen display/graphics up a bit). Atari have been announcing the Jaguar since last year, but it was overshadowed by the release of the excellent but illfated Falcon. This time, however, Atari are far more bullish with their claims for the new machine. \"We believe that we have taken a more substantial jump than 3DO has in bringing a better and more affordable entertainment experience to the consumer market\", said Sam Tramiel, president of Atari. The Jaguar is aimed at the multimedia market, with a CD add-on module planned which will cover all entertainment formats, including computer/console, music CD and, most importantly, video formats via a plug in Mpeg 2 cartridge which allows users to play fulllength motion pictures from CD. Price of the basic system, branded by Atari as a 'home interactive entertainment system', is expected to be around $200 (about  in British coinage) and, say Atari, it will be introduced in New York and San Francisco this Autumn before being distributed nationally next year. Should be interesting to see the battle that eterlilies ensues between these Tiny Toons one of the first converts to the Jaguar! INY TODA PCOST three... "

Called Level One, the new floor of fun can be found in HMV's huge shop in Oxford St. They say that it'll carry over 10,000 titles in stock so it should be a massive draw for shoplifters. Ram Raiders will have a bit of a problem though, as the department will be on the first floor. HMV plan to have similar games departments in over 40 stores by the end of the year, so there could eventually be some scope for low-level attack. However, if you're not a villain, then you're more than welcome to buy some games at Level One when it opens on the 29th September. Happy chappies? Answers on a postcard, please...

"The Advanced Gravis Sound Board. 3D Holographic sound will soon be available on the PCand hopefully other formats in the future. The Sound Blaster. Made better sound available to more PC owners, thanks to its no-nonsense price. SOUND raphics for games have really got hot in the last couple of years but what about sound? Video junkies are banging on about Home Cinema at the moment, and the key to that is quadrophonic sound. But what about aurals in games? The latest technology could bring players just that little bit closer to sonic heaven; Supersonic Garth Sumpter tells all... There has always been sound in computer and video games. Okay, so in the days of the Spectrum, it really wasn't that hot its limited repertoire of beeps and boings hardly set the pulse racing. And it has been rather easy for each sucessive games machine to come up with something a little better. We've seen stereo sound, synthesised sound, sampled sound and now, with CD technology taking off, digital sound. But now there's finally something a little bit different on the horizon which just might change the sound of games as we know them 3D Holographic Sound from Gravis. sound as though it's emanating from four speakers. There's nothing too surprising in that quadrophonic systems have been wrapping sound around our heads for years. The real breakthrough with this system, though, is that it does it all with only two speakers, although the best effect is achieved when you plug your ears into a set of headphones. Sounds move around you from left to right, in front of you, behind and even up and down. But there's more; this system can even rotate around with you as the central point in real time... system could add to games. Imagine playing a horror game, an adventure or roleplaying game, a flight sim or any game where moving sound could add to the atmosphere or even help you to locate monsters, nasties, enemies or even your way around. You could 'hear' enemies behind you, above you and even to the sides and be able to move toward or away from them using the sound that they make atmospheric or what? This is the next step for sound and is certainly essential for the future of gaming as we move towards true Virtual Reality nology, the system is currently only available with the Advanced Gravis PC sound board. But, as with many console features (like CD) they are often developed for PC first and then incorporated onto console formats. Will the same happen for Holographic sound? Currently, there are several software producers that are using the special code developed for Gravis' sound board to incorporate into their PC games. Some of these developers may well begin to use the lessons learnt from this excercise to improve upon the sound that they use in their projects for Nintendo and Sega. In the meantime, all we can do is to sit and wait and keep an ear cocked for any news. But be sure that, if we hear anything (from whatever direction), you'll be the first to know! 3D SOUND In its simplest form, 3D sound simply takes stereo sound and then mathematically alters it to make it BLARINGLY OBVIOUS Once you hear the system, you can't fail to be impressed especially once you realise what this I CAN HEAR IT GETTING CLOSER So, what's next? Well, before you all start lobbying your parents for this latest advance in game tech19 "

Egawa Suguru is presumably some sort of Japanese baseball team manager, or the bloke the programmers got their takeaways from.

To make things a little easier so they don't end up buying you a disc which contains an excellent intro and a mucho-cacka game, why not take a peek at the latest CD releases coming your way in the near future... CYBORG 009 PC CD-ROM MEGA-CD ESRREC SERE 58000 EEDS It's very quiet on the PC front at the moment, with just two games on the way, but worry not because they're both topper titles. With some top-quality software now appearing officially, the import side of things has slowed down somewhat. Here are a few of the discs we've had descend on us this month! RE  ROVER D BE 0 C EGAWA SUGURU'S SUPER LEAGUE CD DUNE VIRGIN The smash hit game of the book is finally coming to a compact disc near you. The game structure is the same as the disk, but with a load of graphical and audio enhancements. Like the Mega-CD version of Dune, it's going to feature oodles of speech and cut-scenes. The biggest concern, though, is that it could be too close to the disk version to warrant buying. We'll see. First impressions of this game were 'Oh no, not another CD shoot 'em up'. Fortunately it plays better than most of its counterparts, with a sterling soundtrack, loads of good weapons and plenty of fodder for your guns. Apart from the music, there's nothing to really set this apart from any other cartridge shoot 'em up, so make of it what you will como 3X3 EYES HOME GROUND SELECT E15 1001 q1122 SCORE 80014900 PLAVER KING'S QUEST 6 SIERRA Although this game has already appeared on floppy, Sierra has really gone to town on the CD-ROM version of King's Quest 6, having practically reprogrammed it from scratch. There's virtually a disc full of music and all the graphics have been airbrushed then scanned into the game. The game is one of the finest adventures ever to grace the PC, and the CD version will make you smile. SCORE OOOO4200 PLAVER 250 250 This game seemingly appeared from nowhere and hopefully it will go back there. Basically it's a platform-based shoot 'em up with you as 009, a cybernetically enhanced special agent.

"CD-32 SOFTWARE UPDATE If you've got your hands on one of the first CD-32 machines, you'll probably be wondering what games are on their way. Here's our pick of the best, although trying to pin people down on confirmed release dates is like trying to get Garth to get his hair cut impossible. AKIRA ICE The licence for the most popular Manga video has been grabbed by Ice. No doubt we can expect to see plenty of clips from the movie in the game. CIVILIZATION MICROPROSE Previously restricted to the Mac, PC and Amiga, Sid Meier's awesome god sim is set to make its console debut on the CD-32. The finest driving games on the Amiga are coming to the CD-32 on just one disc! Video sequences are among the touted extras. R0000 MILLENNIUM Once again Millennium whip out their piscine star for his umpteenth outing. More platform japery and eye-melting colours are promised. ALFRED CHICKEN MINDSCAPE Mindscape's latest creation is set to debut on the CD-32 around about Christmas. That's if Colonel Saunders doesn't get to him first. DRACULA PSYGNOSIS Programmed around the same engine as the Mega-CD version, don't expect to see a radically different game on the CD-32. MICROCOSM PSYGNOSIS People have been harping on about this for ages. It sure looks good, but it's been so long in the making that it might have passed its sell-by date. SANTA LUETINS Credits MORTAL KOMBAT ACCLAIM This looks likely to be a soaraway success on the CD-32. No-holds barred combat and plenty of blood and gore to go with it. SENSIBLE SOCCER RENEGADE One of the finest Amiga games ever. Keep an eye out for the CD-32 version promised early next year. NICK FALDO GOLF GRANDSLAM Massively excellent on the Amiga, it looks likely to be an even better bet on CD. Again, expect to see tons of video clips and radically better animation. ALIEN BREED 2 TEAM 17 The follow-up to the hit Alien Breed promises loads more levels, aliens and the kind of action you can only get on a CD. DUNE 2 VIRGIN Highly rated on floppy, the CD version promises loads of speech as well as stunning music. JURASSIC PARK OCEAN Take the disk version, wang on plenty of extras, and you've got this game. A definite number one in the making. NORTH POLAR EXPEDITION VIRGIN Follow in Sir Ranulph Fiennes' frost-bitten footsteps as you attempt to lead a successful expedition to the North Pole. Looks like a bit of a laff. Honest.. SOCCER KID KRISALIS The Amiga version is reviewed on pages 34/35 of this issue, and the CD-32 version will be following close behind. It should feature Brazil as a bonus country. LEGACY MICROPROSE Converted from the PC where it was a smash-hit, Legacy seems destined for similar success on CD. BODY BLOWS TEAM 17 Rather than a sequel, the CD version will feature much-enhanced graphics, amongst other things. LEMMINGS PSYGNOSIS There's no escape from them, not even on CD. The question is, will we see just one game, or all three on one disc? PROJECT X TEAM 17 This is another seen before title Team 17 are rehashing for the CD32. Extra levels are almost certain, along with new music and tons more speed. LOTUS TURBO TRILOGY GREMLIN 07733130 UNOS07E DO CHAOS ENGINE RENEGADE Despite not receiving the attention it should have when first released, Renegade is pressing on with what could be a top-selling CD shoot 'em up. PUTTY SYSTEM 3 Just out on the SNES, CD-32 Putty is a bit of a dark horse at the moment, with nobody seeming to know what, if any, enhancements will be made. But the game is jolly enough, so it should be a bit of a corker when it appears. SYNDICATE ELECTRONIC ARTS Bullfrog's unique brand of hyperviolence is winging its way to the CD-32 shortly. More gore, more violence and more fun are promised. "

Little do they know, though, that Aladdin has been to the Al-Rhakman School Of Advanced Sword Play, where he graduated with flying colours. Not only is he an expert with curved swords, he's also dead-eye with apples. These ancient and honourable weapons do almost the same amount of damage as sharpened steel, with the added bonus of making some of the targets drop their keks when hit. Apart from his swordsmanship and skill with small pieces of fruit, the only other thing Aladdin has to help him is his jumping abilities. He can also make use of various parts of the scenery to propel himself to otherwise inaccessible platforms.

However, fate takes a hand and Aladdin is recruited by the Sultan's scheming vizier, Jafar, to help retrieve the magic lamp from its resting place in the Cave of Wonders.

"SNES by NINTENDO TBA OUT: Now. Contact Nintendo (0329 822 565) for information. WHAT'S IT GOT? IT'S GOT THE [OT! For Tom SUPER MARIO Mario All-Stars is the perfect game for nostalgia nuts, as it contains all four NES Mario titles. Each one has been brought bang up to date with improved graphics and stunning revamped soundtracks. Apart from that, the maps, hidden warps, bonus blocks and attack waves are all intact. As an added bonus each game has four batterysave positions, so you don't even have to complete them all in one sitting. Mario Lost Levels is the dark horse in the pack and it's a pretty safe bet that almost none of you will have ever seen it, as the game only ever saw the light of day in Japan. ALL THREE NES MARIO GAMES? AND AN EXTRA ONE? ALL SPRUCED UP AND SLAPPED ON ONE SNES CART? BLOODY HELL! nd they said he was washed up! Mario is about to break onto the SNES scene once again in what could well be his greatest outing yet! Before you start filling your jeans, this isn't an all-new Mario game; it's better than that. Mario All-Stars is a compilation of his four NES classics, bundled onto one SNES cartridge with stunning new graphics and incredible soundtracks. This one's potentially the ultimate product for original Mario fans, and seemingly perfect for those who never owned an NES. Is it old hat? Read on and find out! SUPER MARIO BROS: 985 VARIO THE LOST LEVELS: 1986 3083 MARIO BROS The original Mario platform game is a staggering eight years old now, but when you play this version its age hardly shows at all. Basically it's a horizontally scrolling platform SUPER MARIO game, consisting of eight three-part levels, with you controlling either Mario or Luigi on a mission to rescue Princess Daisy from the clutches of the evil Bowser. WELL WARPED Special warp tubes were a major Step 4: feature in the original game, and all When you've the ones you remember are in this got over the version too. They cut out a bulk of novelty of the difficult stuff, like actually havrunning ing to play the game! Here's how around the to find the main warp room on score, head right, pass over the level one. exit and keep going. This game never saw the light of day over here as it was originally released as a disk-only product in Japan. Basically it's the same thing SUPER MARIO as the first Mario game, only much tougher. I mean, this is sooo tough that it makes all the other Mario titles look like child's play. If you think you're ace at Mario One, wait until you cop a load of this. The gameplay is very similar, with Mario having to navigate through a series of horizontally scrolling levels. This time, though, there are more strategically placed pits for him to fall into, as well as a brigade of Bowser's toughest soldiers to overcome. The result is a game whose first level is ten times tougher than the last level of Mario One! THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING MARIO Step 1: World 1-2 and the game hasn't even begun to be tough. It's either breeze through the next few levels on the last train to Dullsville, or skip the lot. Step 5: Voila! Levels two, three and four are at your disposal! There are plenty more! warps like this one, but we're not going to tell you where they are (unless you send us lots of cash). Over the four games Mario comes in several shapes and sizes, ranging from small and useless to totally hard and airborne. All you have to do is collect the appropriate icon and bingo, instant transformation which would turn the Incredible Hulk pink with envy. Fireball Mario: Collect a fire flower and Mario will be imbued with the power to cast fireballs, which comes in very handy for blasting Bowser's troops. Step 2: Get to this stage just before the exit then ride a platform to the top of the screen. Time it wrong and you'll end up playing Mario pancake. Little Mario: Apart from being able to squeeze down small passages, little Mario is a real duffer. 22 Lurking at the end of each level is Bowser. He's not nearly as ferocious here as he is in other Mario games, and it's perfectly possible to beat him using little, un-powered-up Mario every time. Bowser's only attack is a rather feeble fireball, which is easily avoided by the Brooklyn boy. After that, it's just a simple case of jumping onto his head a few times he'll soon give in and let you pass. Raccoon Mario: This is Mario at his hardest. His special raccoon suit lets him fly and swat creatures and blocks with his tail. Step 3: Jump off and into the score display. Big Mario: In this form Mario can merely use his jumping skills to trash his enemies and smash blocks. And if you get these, there's still more to grab, like the statue suit in Super Mario Bros 3! 30 "


"SUPER MARIO BROS 3: 1000 VERDICT The last game in the NES Super Mario trilogy has been widely acclaimed as probably the finest platform game ever and this version is just incredible. Once again the Toad kingdom SUPER MARIO 3 is threatened by Bowser and only Mario can stop him. The lizard king isn't alone this time; he's brought along his seven kids Morton, Larry, Iggy, Ludwig, Lemmy, Wendy and Roy who are each holed up in their own castle. They're just as mean as their dad and particularly despise Mario and Luigi. Mario 3 has more in common with SNES Mario World than anything else. For starters you choose what level you want to play via a map, then there's Mario's new-found flight skills to contend with. Naturally there are also stacks of bonus levels to contend with it's just a matter of finding them. New concepts in platformers may come and go, but this cart proves that you can't beat the old classics almost! Nintendo have not only crammed the first three Mario games into one cart, nor have they only spruced up the graphics and sounds, but they have even added a whole host of levels that never appeared in any of the previous Mario games the Director's Cut of Mario games, it you will. If you have an 8-bit Nintendo with the first three Mario games on it, sell it immediately and buy this cart it's miles better and takes up far less room! PAUL ANGLIN UP, UP AND AWAAAYY! * BONUS og ELS one you get. Additionally there are also power cards which can be used before a level begins to give Mario invincibility and a hearty dose of mushroom power, amongst other things. this is one of the multitude of hidden bonus rooms in Mario One. Keep an eye out for these as collecting 100 coins earns you an extra life. TOADY'S GAMES For the first time in any game, Mario can fly! This is actually a bit weird, as in order to do so he has to collect the special raccoon suit, and as we all know raccoons can only fly if you drop-kick them really hard. The suit also lets him blat the Koopa Troopers with its tail, which is actually quite risky as you have to be right next to them to do so. To take off, start Mario running and the gauge at the bottom of the screen will start powering up. As soon as it hits maximum, punch the jump button and Mario will take to the skies. To keep him airborne keep hitting the button. SUPER MARIO BROS 2 : 1988-1002 SUPERA Every so often Toady appears and tries to con Mario into wasting his time playing a stupid mini-game. If you win it's a case of total luck as you either pick the right chest out of three or successfully match three pieces of a rapidly moving picture. Win a game and you earn an extra card, although it's invariably one you don't need. Moral: don't take any crap from someone who dresses like a mushroom. 1933 IT'S IN THE CARDS Extra lives are gained by collecting special cards. If you get three of a kind, depending on the symbol, you'll earn between one and five extra lives. You gain one card at the end of a level, but it's pretty much a matter of luck as to which fo This game started life as an average platform yomp called Doki Doki Panic, then Nintendo decided they could flog more copies by sticking Mario in it. The result is a game which lacks SUPER MARIO 2 the feel of the other three titles, but is still darn playable. Mario can no longer kill Koopa's henchmen by jumping on them; instead he has to chuck vegetables at them, which are pulled from the ground. He can also pick up the nasties and use them as weapons, as well as grab special POW blocks which destroy any other living thing that's unlucky enough to be onscreen at the time. MEET THE GUYS For the first time in a Mario game Toady: you're given the chance to play Toady's slightly characters other than Mario and more controllable Luigi. Here's a rundown on the than the plumbers, stars and how they rate in the although he's not game. very fast. He can also carry more weight than the Mario: other characters. For some reason Mario isn't at his Daisy: best in this game.

More skill is required to collect coins here, but it's more fun in the long run. "


"SNES IMPORT NADINESSE OSPED TE If you're planning on spending a vast amount of cash getting an import version of the game, be warned; there are some differences. First off, the Jap version will only work on some 60Mhz Japanese machines and it doesn't work with converters. Secondly, the games are named differently, with Mario Two now being swapped for the Lost Levels. PROS: Loads of totally absorbing gameplay and incredible graphics and soundtracks. CONS: Mario Lost Levels is perhaps just a little too difficult for some. Apart from his super-high jumping ability, Mario is also a bit nifty when it comes to scuba diving. Unlike the rest of us mere mortals he dosn't have to bother with trivial things like holding his breath and so can spend as much time submerged as you want him to. HABAR VERDICT Some of the backdrops could have been better, but still very GRAPHICS good. Boobs The giant world takes a new twist here! as it starts to sink into the ocean! Talk about video game heaven! This is probably the best thing to happen to the SNES ever. I suppose being an ancient fart who rants on about what it was like in the good old days has something to do with it, but seeing these blasts from the past has brought home just how many good games there have been in the last ten years. All the gameplay has been perfectly retained and the new graph ics are stunning. Mario-heads, platform freaks and just about anyone who owns a SNES must get a copy of this is quite sim ply the best. ONNOS Many stirling revamps of the original soundtracks and effects. 00 Not content with merely cloud hopping, Mario goes all the way to the Star Zone. GAMEPLAY It's Mario times four! What more could you ask for? Nothing, that's what. GARTH SUMPTER VALUE Excellent, but the games are essentially the same as the NES versions. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Get ready to win with Toady and his smart bonus game! LLLLLLLLLLL 12 SOOS OOOO00 20 Mario gets around in the third game by traversing a Mario World-style map. MISS OK HIT Mario Two retains a couple of features from the first game, but apart from that it's an utterly different pot of spaghetti which doesn't quite match up to the rest. Lost Levels is a real challenge for even the most seasoned gamer! 32 "

SOCCER CHIP This one is a high kick which sends the ball sailing right over the top of obstacles; you probably won't see it again afterwards. OVERHEAD KICK Of all the moves this is the most spectacular. Particularly useful for taking out nasties who attack from behind. Become the world's number one footy fan in a soccer game that isn't PASS The Kid's basic move. He simply hoofs it on the run, which is normally enough to take out the person on the receiving end. KAS isaster has struck the World Cup, and it's nothing to do with England making a shambles of qualifying. An evil alien known only as Scab has come to Earth and stolen the trophy. He didn't make a clean getaway, though, as in his excitement he drove his space ship straight into an asteroid. In the ensuing explosion the World Cup was blown into five pieces which have landed in various parts of the world. Sitting at home in good ol' Blighty is the game's ultimate fan Soccer Kid. Equipped with nothing more than his favourite kit and his ball, he sets out to find the cup and make sure the tournament goes ahead. What a guy! HEADER This is one of the hardest moves to master, and to tell you the truth it's rarely needed, so forget about it. ALL AROUND THE WORLD Bits of the World Cup have landed in five different countries, each of which is full of local yobbos and yokels who seem to frown on football. VERDICT Soccer Kid is, without a doubt, one of the more original games of the last few years, and it certainly makes a change from the haggard old platformers we're used to. The graphics are ace with excellent scrolling and detailed, well animated sprites. The football element makes it more taxing than you might think, as most of the Kid's various moves have to be employed at some stage or another. A few more variations in the gameplay and the levels might have made the game even better, but as it stands it still gets a big thumbs up from me. . England: Considering we're a footballing nation, people don't take kindly to Soccer Kid. He comes under attack from construction workers, pit bulls and, on stage two, he has the weather to contend with Italy: It may be the home of pizzas and blokes on mopeds, but they don't like the English supporters. Even the wildlife's out to get the Kid, as fish join in the fray. PAUL ANGLIN 34 "


"AMIGA PENALTY Thanks to his uncanny footballing abilities, Soccer Kid's ball is the only thing he needs to help him in his quest. Mainly it comes in handy for punting at unruly types who don't appreciate what he's doing for the world of sport. It also makes a handy trampoline for reaching higher platforms. All's not lost if he loses the ball; hold down the fire button for a couple of seconds and another one appears, although you don't get as many points at the end of the level if you do this. On board a Russian battleship packed with tense sailors is no place for a young boy in shorts to be. Don't get too close to this waiter or he'll level you with a flying pizza. PROS: An original and very varied version of the platform genre, with great graphics CONS: The football often complicates things. GRAPHICS The enemy sprites are excellently drawn and animated. Top backgrounds, too. Watch out for the pitbulls, they're not muzzled and go straight for the face. SOUND A barrel-load of suitably boppy tunes to shake your funky stuff to. GAMEPLAY An action-packed and very challenging piece of software. Tough and addictive you'll be working on this one for ages. It's not fun out in the country where the yokels don't take kindly to Soccer Kid Soccer Kid is hard. Forget the terraces at Millwall; try Siberia, in winter, in shorts. Brrr! trampling over their fields. SCHOOL DAZE To cater for those whose joystick skills are as bad as their football ones, there's a special 6 UNDERGI tutorial mode. Admittedly you have to be really crap to need it, but it's a nice touch all the same. Here you're taken through the Kid's arsenal of footy skills and shown how to execute every one with the sort of precision that would have Gazza calling it quits and heading for an early bath. There's also an option to change Soccer Kid's kit, so you'll never be stuck with the colours of a rival club. There are worse places to be than deserted underground stations, but not many. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES NWU  MSSK HIT RUSSIA: These guys aren't as boring as you might think; if the crazy sailors don't get you on the battleship, the gym-nasty assassins will in Red Square. JAPAN: The environment gets the first crack at you here in the form of flying fish and killer insects. After a quick trip on the Tokai Bullet train, you end up in the car factory for a showdown with the sumo wrestlers. USA: This is where it all happens. The final piece of the World Cup is here, it's just a matter of putting the thing together in time for the World Cup finals. 35 "


"LREVIEW_by SUNSOFT by SUNSOFT .99 SNES OUT: On import. Contact Dream Machines (0429 869459) for more information. THE GREAT EIGHT You control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own attacks and special moves. PROS: Varied selection of characters and an excellent battle mode. Hanzo: The karate master with his own version of the dragon punch. CONS: The game is generally rather rough around the edges. Fuuma: Studies the same arts as Hanzo, and so has the same moves. What a swizz! GRAPHICS Large, well animated characters. Some of the backdrops are flat, though. Dragon: Basing himself on Bruce Lee, Dragon is a formidable character Ultimate hardness isn't something you're born with, it's something you have to earn. At least, that's what the organisers of the the annual World Heroes competition reckon. They've taken the roughest, toughest fighters from all over the world and given them the simple task of beating each other into submission. Nine combatants take part in this great global tussle, with you controlling one of the eight main ones. Finally, if you overcome the other seven, you face off against your worst nightmare, a morphing alien with the powers of all the fighters. Aieee! Janne: Not being very good with martial arts, Janne has armed herself with a rather sharp sword. ONNOS Bearable array of tunes and plenty of the usual highimpact effects. J Carn: Carn is the last of the Mongols and is not to be trifled with GAMEPLAY Lots of special moves to master, plus the battle mode. M Power: Despite his strength, M. Power is dead slow and easy to beat. Brocken: Half robot, half psycho, Brocken has a huge array of weapons. VALUE Even with two types of arena, it's not the hardest game to complete. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Rasputin: This mad monk employs mystical powers to help him to victory. Fiery antics with World Heroes hard feller, the Bruce Lee-a-like Dragon. World Heroes' bonus stage requires you to make a dodgy sculpture from a lump of rock. ARENA OF DEATH! 'If beating people senseless in various normal locations isn't enough to satisfy your raging blood-lust, there's a special hyper-violent battle mode. Here the scenic backgrounds are replaced by giant spikes and electric fences, designed to give the fighters an even tougher time. Naturally the winner is usually the person who boots his opponent onto the spikes/fire/electricity most frequently. If you can win in this combat field, then you are worthy of the title World Hero! ( ONWAU = MITTTTTT VERDICT MISS OK! HIT World Heroes failed to make an impression on me in the arcades, mainly because it was right next door to SF2 Championship Edition. However, getting to grips with the SNES version I was surprised to find myself enjoying it. The moves aren't too difficult to master, but the game retains a strange element of unpredictability (probably due to shoddy programming) which makes each match completely unique. World Heroes doesn't even begin to grovel at the feet of Streetfighter, but it's at least worthy enough to scrub the toilets. PAUL ANGLIN They can't hide it. The dragon punch returns, albeit in a slightly different form. 36 "

"MEGADRIVE by SEGA .99 OUT: On Import. Contact Dream Machines (0429 869459) for information. The Supe? SHINOB! BOSS BATTERING One of Shinobi's strong points is also a weak one. The bosses vary from dead impressive to small and extremely poor. Without a doubt the best-looking one is the decomposing skull, but even then, when you destroy it, all it does is sink miserably into the ground. Things do get worse, though; one boss is nothing more than a miniscule sprite which fires easy-to-dodge lasers. nce more the world is Super Shinobi 2 wasn't the threatened by the evil Neo Zeed, and only one cracker it was expected to person can stop them. A quick be, so it's been tarted up call to the Agatha Smedlesworth home for retired Ninja and Samurai and here it is! and we find Joe Mushashi, star of the Shinobi series and all-round superdude. Without a thought for himself, Joe has packed his haemorrhoid cream and truss and headed of for the nearest assassins supply shop. Armed with a large sword, two dozen quality shurikens and an attitude you could break rocks on, Joe's not going to let a few hundred paltry ninja warriors spoil his day. SKULL: It looks good, but it's not that hard. Aim for the eyes and keep an eye out for its hand Neo Zeed's labs aren't a pleasant place, Fight your way through leaping mutant brains and slime beasts. Yuk! ROBOT: The only attack you have to fear here is when the screen goes wobbly. This reverses all your controls, For some reason the Neo Zeed don't want Joe using their lift, and they'll go to any lengths to stop him. This level scrolls upwards continuously It'll cost you a life if you get left behind, VERDICT This guy is no match for Joe's sword, but he can only be hit after he attacks. SURF ROBOT: This guy is so useless it's incredible. A small amount of ducking and weaving coupled with an active trigger finger gets rid of him in no time. Being a fan of the first Shinobi game, which is still one of the best carts ever, I couldn't wait to get my grubby paws on this one. I must admit I was a little disappointed. It's not that Shinobi 2 is a bad game, it's just not as much fun as the first one as it lacks much of the action and the clever touches that graced each level. The animation is great though, and there are stacks of offensive moves. Even on the hard est level it's not that difficult, so if you complete it within a week you can't complain that you haven't been warned. SULU Some foot soldiers, such as this one, can only be hit from above or close-up with the sword. PAUL ANGLIN 38 "


"COULD IT BE MAGIC MEGADRIVE There are some situations where all the combat abilities in the world just aren't enough. At times like these, Joe needs to invoke his special ninja magic which can be used just once per level. W-W-W-W-WIPE OUT! Shinobi 2 may not be the most original game ever, but it does offer one ground-breaking feature surfing! For the first time ever, the ninja warriors take to the beach and battle it out on surf boards. Not only can he employ his vast ninja talents here, Joe can also leap, board and all, out of the water to land on the head of any. one who gets too near. And as if cruising the waves wasn't enough, Joe also takes to horseback on one level. Here, he has to leap over spiky fences and fight off evil ninjas which leap from giant kites. Weird, Get too close and this bloke will toast your butt. Stand back and take him out with shurikens. PROS: Great animation and loads of moves to master. CONS: Although big, Shinobi 2 isn't all that difficult. Lightning: The heavens open and a massive bolt of lightning comes down and strikes Joe. Instead of ending up as a pair of boots with smoke curling out of them, he's imbued with mystical lightning power, making him temporarily invincible. BRAPHICS Fantastic animation, but the backgrounds aren't up to scratch.   ONNOS Plenty of tunes and sampled sound effects. Fire: Invoking yet more strange forces, Joe calls upon the power of the fire dragons to smite his foes with a sticky napalm death. This one looks the best of the lot, which is all the more reason to use it. Joe demonstrates his amazing ninja equestrian abilities as he battles ninja paratroopers on his bullet-proof horse. GAMEPLAY Lots of moves and things to kill make for good fun. Not as hard as it could have been. BOLD THREE Joe Mushashi is so confident of his amazing ninja abilities that he's forsaken the traditional black outfit for a day-glo white and red one. This leads to him being attacked from all sides, which is just the excuse he needs to dish out the kind of extreme violence that Bruce Lee could only dream of. Joe's main armaments are his shurikens, which are basically lethally sharp throwing stars. If he gets close enough to an enemy he'll use his sword instead, which does far more damage than the shurikens. Ghost Joes: When one Mushashi isn't enough, use this power to call up four ghostly Joes! These boys will follow whatever the original does, giving you an added edge in combat VALUE STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES The brains burst out of their special cloning tanks when Joe approaches; luckily, it only takes one hit to kill them. VERDICT KONWU vo 11llllllllll Explodo-Joe: This is the least impressive of the lot. Joe merely puts his hands together and blows himself up. Despite not looking good, this one does inflict a lot of damage so it shouldn't be overlooked. MISS OK! HIE The original Super Shinobi 2 was a little weak, but now Sega has released a souped-up version, is the game any better? Well yes, but not by that much. The in-game sprites are a joy to behold welldefined and superbly animated but backdrops leave something to be desired. Joe has lots of different moves and power-ups, but unfortunately these only serve to make the game a touch too easy. When it comes to the crunch, this is a worthy addition to the Shinobi line-up, but if you're a red-hot player I would have a try before handing over the spends. GARTH SUMPTER "

"MEGADRIVE by CODEMASTERS OUT Now. Call Codemasters (0926 814 132) for info. aking the leap from 3 computers to consoles, Codemasters' very own hard-boiled hero, Dizzy, makes his Megadrive debut. This time his equally eggy girlfriend has been kidnapped by an evil wizard. Will Dizzy crack under Solve the puzzles and get out of there as fast as possible. pressure? Or will he find the fiend who poached his girly? DIZZY WORLD PROS: A good mix of action and puzzle solving. CONS: A bit too easy and very straightforward. Looks too basic for a Megadrive game. GRAPHICS Tiny, but well drawn sprites. Absolutely nothing special, though. EGG NOG game is working out what you should take with you and what should be left behind. Not all the objects you need are close to the relevant locations, so you often have to get a good way into the game before you can solve a problem you encountered early on. people out. Most problems are fairly straightforward, being just a case of hunting down a specific object and using it in conjunction with something else. Rather than make the game predictable, every time you solve a problem a bit more of the game opens up, with new hazards and quandaries to overcome. He also has to collect 250 stars on his travels, which will open the gate to Zaks' palace and lead to the final showdown. INNOS The once-peaceful land of Yolkfolk is in crisis; an evil and quite mental wizard called Zaks has turned all the little animals into evil bloodsucking murderers. Even worse, he's kidnapped Daisy, the girlfriend of the Yolkfolk's greatest hero, Dizzy. The problem for these people is that they were all born with strange birth defects â€” they're all eggs. Naturally, this makes dealing with this sort of trouble a little difficult. Fortunately for the populace, Dizzy was hard-boiled at a very young age, so he sets out to right the wrongs and rescue his one true love. It sounds corny, and silly, but the Dizzy series has clocked up some 3,000,000 sales now across various formats. Someone out there must really like him. Jolly, though occasionally irritating, tunes play throughout. STARS ON 45 Dizzy progresses through the game by solving puzzles and helping GAMEPLAY Enjoyable from the off, mainly because it's not too difficult. VALUE Experienced gamers will find the puzzles a little too simplistic. stle St. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES HAM OMELETTE Being an egg with stubby limbs, life for Dizzy isn't easy. Despite not having any clothes or visible orifices apart from his mouth, he can hold up to three objects at once. One of the keys to getting through the 5 There's plenty of hassle in the street called Castle NO-NWAO NO  VERDICT QILILO MISS OK! HIT Dizzy is a game I loved to hate. I wasn't a fan of it on other formats, and I've hardly warmed to it on the Megadrive. Putting my persona dislike aside, this is one of Dizzy's better outings. There's plenty to see and do, the graphics are small but neat and there are some original ideas. However, it's not overly difficult and it's often possible to work out how to solve a problem before you even know what items are available. If you've never played this sort of game before, Fantastic Dizzy is a good first buy. Experienced adventurers, on the other hand, will breeze through this.

"MEGA-CD by SEGA .99 OUT: On import. Contact Dream Machines (0429 869459) for information. REVIEW ECCO THE PAIN ormally when a human starts ranting on about being kidnapped by aliens, everyone tends to keep their distance. But for poor old ECCO the dolphin it couldn't be any worse. He's actually escaped capture but almost every other sea-dwelling lifeform has been sucked up to who knows where. On his own, it's up to Ecco to sort things out, and not only rescue all his iishy and mammalian buddies, but save the entire planet in the process. No mean task for the animal that made the mistake of choosing water as its home at the outset of the evolutionary race. You loved his aquatic antics on cartridge now get ready to go gaga over Ecco on Mega-CD! DOLPHIN DATABASE One major new feature of this version is a database of digitised dolphin facts. When you reach the great library and tap it for some knowledge, you're also presented with excellent digitised video footage. There's over five minutes of footage in total, all of it ace. The only problem is the level it's contained in is halfway through the game, so you've got a long way to go before you see it. Now who said computer and video games weren't educational? For all Ecco's excellent graphics the octopus looks suspiciously like it's made out of rubber. SOUNDING OFF Sharks are no match for an angry bottlenose dolphin charging at 20 miles an hour Barge them out of the way and carry on with your business. GLYPH-HANGER Probably the most useful weapon in Ecco's arsenal is his voice. By sending out high-frequency signals he can map the surrounding area with a system called echolocation. Ecco also some talent for music and can learn songs which let him deal with enemies just by singing at them. He learns them by completing tasks such as rescuing other dolphins who don't have enough sense to find their own way home. Most other creatures aren't as bright as Ecco and can't answer him when he calls, such as fish who are just there to be eaten. Dotted around the ocean are strange crystals called Glyphs. If Ecco talks to these they'll often give him clues as to how to complete the current level. Additionally certain Glyphs have to be located in order to pass through barriers elsewhere in the stage. Other surviving members of the aquatic community, such as whales, are also on hand with information, which you should pay heed to if you want to complete the level without missing any vital extras. The ocean isn't without its dangers, though; sharks, jellyfish, puffer fish and other far stranger creatures don't like a smartass and will do anything they can to hinder Ecco's progress. Puzzles also have to be negotiated, such as this one: 1) This poor dolphin's lost her mates somewhere in the caverns below the sea and, being the nice lad he is, Ecco's going to help her get back together with them. 2) Your way is blocked by this annoyingly positioned boulder, but fortunately, for some unexplained reason, shells dissolve certain rocks in Ecco's world. 3) Here is the baby dolphin you've been sent to find, but unknown to Ecco that earlier boulder's returned to block his path and cause more pain and hassle. 42 "


"VERDICT Use sonar pulses to view the sur rounding area, talk to glyphs and wildlife and sing songs to distract your enemies. MEGA-CD I was instantly hooked on cartridge Ecco. Like most people, though, I was sceptical about the CD version. I mean, it looks just like the original version, right? Well it does look like the first game, and plays just like it too, but there are several major differences. First there are more levels and the video library, but best of all is the sound. Whoever produced the music was obviously a fan of the Blade Runner sound track it's so weird. If you've already got the game on cartridge this really isn't sufficiently different to warrant buying. If you don't have it already though, it's an essential purchase. PROS: Fantastic soundtrack and unmatched gameplay brilliant. CONS: If you own the cart this version's too similar to warrant purchase. GARTH SUMPTER Zap the clams with a sonar blast 10 make them. release energy-replenishing bubbles. GRAPHICS Stunning backdrops and incredible animation FLIPPING HECK! A dolphin's acrobatic abilities are for more than just going through hoops in wildlife parks. Nobody knows why they do it, but for some reason wild dolphins are suddenly struck by the urge to leap right out of the water. Ecco is no different, although it actually serves a purpose in the game. As well as an energy gauge, Ecco also has an oxygen gauge, which depletes while he's underwater. To top it up he has to stick at least a nose out of the water and into fresh air. It takes a while this way, so if there's enough room you can speed him up and make him leap out of the sea, replenishing all his oxygen in one swoop. If you want to be really flash, hitting C midleap will make Ecco execute a top spinning somersault. ONNOS CD soundtracks which add huge amounts of atmosphere. 9 GAMEPLAY Just like its cartridge counterpart completely engrossing. VALUE Very taxing, with more depth than the Atlantic Ocean. Top view of TV Q's-BAD? Ecco is the first game to incorporate Sega's much vaunted Q-Sound System, which gives a surround sound effect without the need for any extra speakers or hardware! The manual comes with lots of instructions as to how to set up your speakers for best results. It's well worth persevering as the effect is totally stunning! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 6 Find one of Ecco's stranded brouk ers or sisters and they'll gladly follow von until you lead them home.

You've completed your task and now both dolphins are free to continue! What a top dolphin you are! Now move on to the next level... 43 "


"SHIEL aks MEGA-CD by GAME ARTS .99 OUT: On import. Contact Dream Machines (0429 869459) for information. You've heard all about it now find out whether this graphically 0063050 spectacular game really is as good 00.G as the hype! hey came from out of nowhere. A vast alien armada intent on destroying Earth. Little did they know that the year is 3076 and technology has progressed a fair way. The planet is now guarded by a squadron of SA-77 Silpheed attack craft, which are loaded with the latest in weapons technology. The aliens, however, pay little attention to this, and wipe the mat with all but one of the Silpheed squad you. Alone and out-numbered, the future on the planet rests on your slightly rounded shoulders. This is where you need to keep your ears open for messages as you're told which way to go in order to avoid oncoming asteroids. KILRHEED SOUND DEAL LOADED WEAPON 0079200 00-9 The SA-77 can be fitted with a variety of weapons which become available as you progress through the game. The right combination is important if you're to survive the alien onslaught, so here's our guide to what you should take into combat. The CD sound has been put to good use as the speakers come alive with chit-chat from your wingmen. It pays to keep your ears open as not all the chatter is idle talk. You're frequently warned of incoming hazards and told to go right or left. As you travel through the levels and your mysterious invisible companions vanish, most of the speech dies away, leaving you with just the occasional message from your base to remind you of obvious things, such as 'Shoot it! Despite your ship's formidable weapons, there's not much you can do against giant lumps of space rock. Forward Beam: This is your basic weapon. It's quite powerful, but not very spectacular. A second forward beam gives you a very heaw volume of fire. although without any spread, making it very limited. Phalanx Beam: This is second only to auto-aiming as it puts out a concentrated burst of fire that criss-crosses the main beam. Not only is it powerful, it also covers a fair amount of area. OD03850 Wide Beam: Not very powerful, although it covers a wide area. This isn't a very good weapon as the bullets fire sporadically, allowing smaller craft to fly in-between them. Auto Aiming: Get this and the game becomes much easier, mainly because you don't have to worry so much about lining up precisely with your target. Graviton Bomb: Explodes just in front of your ship, taking out incoming ships and bullets. EM Defence System: Sounds good, doesn't it? It's not, though, as it's nothing more than a basic shield. Photon Torpedo: Sends out a burst of powerful shots which tear through alien ships. Anti-matter Bomb. This fires one supermissile at a time. No good against smaller craft but excellent for dealing with bosses. The game starts with you flying over your home world. It's not very taxing here, so take the opportunity to warm up your trigger finger. 44 "


"VERDICT A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A HARD PERSON The third stage is where the action really hots up. A giant armada has to been seen off and you've been assigned to take out the mother ship. I really enjoyed Silpheed; as well as the incredible graphics, it's challenging with loads of action, especially level four where you have to dodge the massive laser turrets. My biggest criticism is that this game will not last. Eight levels is not enough; I made it to the end of the fourth stage after playing it on and off for a few hours in the office. If I'd been at home I'm certain I would have finished it in a day. This is the most stunning disc on the Mega-CD, but don't be swayed by the graphics alone. 1) Level three looks simple enough, doesn't it? A nice little jaunt through open space with lots to shoot at. 4) The small-fry's all out of the way, now you can go for the real stuff. The computer guides you in close to the.. 013291 GARTH SUMPTER PAUSE 0026550 2) Yipes! That was close! You're now automatically flown in closer to the big ships to avoid the lasers. 5) ...trench! This makes everything else look like child's play as you try to avoid walls, bullets and other ships. 10129820 A massive explosion signals the end of one of Earth's last big spacecraft. Looks good, though, wouldn't you agree? QUICK STICKS 0079150 3) Don't panic, that ship's awfully close but you have to be a really bad pilot to crash into it. 6) Fire a few shots here and the ship will reply with a mas sive laser. Fortunately it soon gives up and runs off. Hurrah for the good guys! 00.2 OB310 Level four tests your reflexes to the full as you head at top speed through an alien fortress. Not even the alien craft dare enter this section. As you progress, bits of the ground drop away revealing more of the level while huge pillars rise from nowhere, forcing you to take evasive action. For all this neat inlevel stuff, Silpheed's boss aliens are rather small and pathetic. Most are no bigger than some of the standard ships, which is a real letdown after all you have to go through to get to them. \"He doesn't look like much, but the second level boss is one tough cookie. His main armaments are energy darts that cut straight through your shields. VERDICT 0198 120 01.G \"X's bloody Galaxians with nice backdrops, what a rip off!Â» Well, it seems as though my first impressions of Silpheed were a little harsh there's actually a hell of a lot more to it than that. As well as looking absolutely stunning, the backdrops on some of the levels even play a part in the game, like when you have to attack the spaceship by flying through the trench, just like in Star Wars! As for Rand saying that it's too easy, well, it is if you're playing it on easy level! Crank it up to hard and you've got a disc that'll last ages. PAUL ANGLIN Your skills are put to the test on this level as you're not only required to shoot everything in sight, but steer your way through narrow canyons. 45 "


"ZITII ISI180 VERDICT MEGA-CD BATTLE DAMAGE PROS: Without question, the best graphics we've yet seen on the Mega-CD CONS: There's not enough levels and the game is a bit too easy. GRAPHICS Stunning raytraced craft and vector graphics Backdrops are simply stunning ANNOS Plenty of speech, but some of the tunes could have been better. I didn't say it was easy! What I said was that Silpheed is a Galaxians clone with ultra-smart backgrounds! And I still feel that.

CARTRIDGE CAPERS Silpheed's graphics are nothing short of remarkable.

However, the game needs no such thing, and what you get This boss is a peace of cake. The blue missiles he launches can be on the disc is shot and the bullets easily avoided. incredible to look at. The ray-traced backdrops and intros are jaw-droppingly good, although not all of the nice stuff is interactive. For example, the giant ships on the third level can be shot and crashed into, but apart from that do nothing more than look good. It's often quite difficult to tell what should be avoided and what will pass safely beneath your craft. The best way to find out is by firing straight at the offending object and if your shots hit, get the hell out of the way! Silpheed features several of these excellent cut sequences.

"REVIEW 1 by NINTENDO .99 SNES arcom 3o88243 OUT: October. Contact Nintendo (0329 822565) for information. HEAD TO HEAD The Battletoads usually consist of Pimple, Rash and Zitz, but poor old Zitz has been kidnapped so it's up to the other two to rescue him. Pimple is the best of the pair thanks to his increased speed, Rash is just useless, not being particularly fast or strong. So that you don't end up fighting each other there's a special two-player option which prevents the characters from hitting each other. You'll probably agree that sounds pretty cack when you can go and beat each other to a pulp using the other option. PROS: Nice large bosses and an occasional humourous touch. CONS: Dull, apart from the almost-impossible bits which are just frustrating. GRAPHICS Backdrops are bland and the Toads look like chimps. Generally above average. Get an enemy either side and your Battletoad will execute a smart double punch, taking care of both of them in one hit. Not excellent. The tunes are quite poor and sound effects are pretty drab. SOU TOAD IN THE HOLE Rash and Pimple invade your SNES in a desperate mission to rescue their mate Zitz! CAMEPLAY Unbalanced and very frustrating. You'll get annoyed with it quickly. The Toads take to various forms of transport to help them in their quest. To begin with they start off with normal items like hoverboards and jet skis, but things soon start to go hayhe Battletoads originally started life as a not-very wire when they take to draughts good idea at parodying the Teenage Mutant Hero pieces for a race across a giant chess Turtles.

The two-player option makes cept, they did spawn a couple of rather good games, the game somewhat easier, but then you face a new problem not although they never really earned the success they enough enemies. The only thing deserved. Undaunted, Rare have produced a follow-up which makes the game remotely fun to the first Battletoads is that you can take a pop at each 11 monase blast and, by the look of other when you're bored. things, they've taken the easy route. Battlemaniacs takes the original formula and, somehow, makes it far worse than you could The two-player game is the best fun as you have hoped for. can smack your mate around. Get too close to a flying pig and your toad will end up a little smaller than usual. It's not terribly exciting, but there's a lot of game in there. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 5 VERDICT ONWA00=  MISS OK! HIT When one of your Toads has battered an opponent senseless he lines up one of his big shots. These are executed automatically and are designed to blast your enemy into infinity as, on the final blow, your Toad's hand transforms into a giant mallet to splat your enemy into next week. The Toads' attacks are rather limited though, with just one button to do the job with. This unleashes a volley of punches followed by a kick, none of which look very impressive. Once an opponent is downed he can be picked up and hurled off of whatever precipice you happen to be standing on 48 I really don't know what has gone wrong here. Right from the off you find yourself enduring sporadic action punctuated with bursts of complete nothing. It just goes downhill from there. Level two starts off well, but towards the end your Toad is surrounded by spiky bits of wood as the screen scrolls at several times its usual rate. The only way to make it through is by having all three lives intact as it's impossible to avoid anything. It seems as though the programmers just ran out of ideas and got a bit silly. This is tedious and extremely frustrating in places. PAUL ANGLIN "

Stupidly positioned horse levels. $6280 $31220 PRÃ‰SESTIR h, that wacky wild west! Where men were men, women were all stereotyped madams with heaving bosoms and cowboys wore large purple shirts and fired six-shooters with more bullets than an Uzi. It's this level of authentic realism (!) that Konami has gone for in its conversion of everybody's favourite arcade \"cowboy shoot 'em up that stars three different gunslingers and a Mexican'. So say hello to the Sunset Riders and just pray that they never have to save your town from bandits! GRAPHICS Crisp and clear, although slightly annoying collision detection. YOUTCUT MED ONNOS Music certainly grates before too long, FX are okay though. They're big, they're bad, they're the end-oflevel guardians! GAMEPLAY Like Fred Astair's hair, the attraction wears thin before too long. DETTOISETTSTTTTOISE GET OFF YER HORSE There aren't nearly enough levels to keep you going. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES POSSE-FOOTING AROUND In order to round up every bad guy in the west, you're going to need a posse. Unfortunately, these four guys tend to make it an im-posse Steve and Billy are good with the ol' six-shooters, Bob packs a mean shotgun beneath his belt and Cormano has a hefty rifle tucked behind his poncho. Admittedly there's little difference between the four, but when you start picking up the power-ups, the shotguns tend to have the edge when it comes to letting off the rounds. A couple of levels put you atop your trusty steed to test your horseriding skills. Wagons deposit logs for you to jump over, horsemen fire bullets for you to avoid (unfortunately, due to the large sprites, when the bad guys fire their guns you don't tend to see the bullets until they're right in front o you) and a train rattles by, carrying more unpleasant surprises. Those purple things are actually bullets! Wait a mo: three-way guns in the wild west? Whatever next? VERDICT ONWA000 IIIIIIIIII GOIN' LOCO MISS OK HIT For anyone who's ever envied those stuntmen of old, level five plants you on top of a moving steam train which you've got to run along. Jump those carriages! Dodge those snipers! Get hit in the stomach by those low-level wooden beams! Rumour has it that British Rail is to introduce a similar scheme to help decrease congestion inside its peak-time carriages... 50 I'm not the world's greatest arcade gamer, so when I can get through to the penultimate level after just one afternoon's play, I guess it's safe to question the long-term appeal of this game. Sunset Riders is hardly the most dynamic use of a SNES, but it is quite good fun while it lasts which unfortunately isn't very long at all. It looks a little strange; the graphics are quite blocky and the sprites are picked out in strange colours, but they aren't that bad. No, it's definitely the gameplay that's at fault; it's just too easy and dull to last. 65 PAUL RAND "

"MEGADRIVE by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 OUT: November. Contact Electronic Arts (0753 549442) for information. HAUNTING Scare the willies out of the Sardinis in this 'dead' good Megadrive game! The first indication that something is wrong. 090000 WA000000 STARRING Polterguy oooooo DON'T GO INTO THE CELLARRGGHH The main section of Haunting involves terrorising the Sardini family. This is achieved by jumping into various objects around the house and waiting for one of the family members to activate them. For example, jumping into the sofa will cause it to vibrate, drawing attention to it. As soon as one of the Sardinis go over to it it'll turn into a huge slavering mouth (or perform some other scary routine). The stupidity of the Sardinis is almost unbelievable. After the first few scarings you'd expect them to be wary of anything that starts wobbling of its own accord, but no. Every time something moves, off they trot to investigate. They deserve everything that's coming to them, frankly. MUMMY, WHY HAS JOHNNY'S FACE GONE ALL GREEN? You can possess a family member by casting one of your ghost spells. Inhabit their body then find one of the others and explode in front of them. Guaranteed to break the ice at parties! Other spells include a top-up for your ecto-energy levels, a limited supply of ghostly fireballs and a diversion for the family dog (who can see you, bite you and drain away your energy). ell here's a novel twist. Haunting isn't so much Ghostbusters, more a ghost that's bustin' loose! Take control of the bad guy! Cause havoc at every turn! Be downright dirty, mean, monstrous, cruel, calamitous, unpleasant, unspeakable, deadly, detrimental and deleterious! Take revenge on the family of the man that caused your death. Possess Mr Vito Sardini's teenage son and scare the willies out of the dog. Terrorise his teenage daughter by animating the monsters under her bed. Who says console games all have to be sweetness and light? The last two levels take place in the Sardini's summer homes. Restore your Ecto with a trip downstairs. HE SLIMED ME! Every spell, possession and re-animation costs a certain amount of ecto-energy and once you've run out, you're little more than a hapless otherworld observer. Fortunately, ecto can be obtained from a nasty little place called The Dungeon. Monsters lurk here, all waiting to cause Polterguy unspeakable harm. Your task is to collect as much ecto (and any bonus spells) as you can before finding the exit and returning to the house. 52 "


"MEET THE SARDINIS! OOH, MOTHER! MEGADRIVE It's time once again for the further adventures of everyone's favourite middle-class, eternally victimised all-American family. In this week's episode, Vito Sardini discovers a ghost is haunting his house, with hilarious consequences... Being dead, Polterguy has the power to possess any number of various objects and characters. Here's just a few of the interesting tricks Polterguy can perform. PROS: Very funny (and very disgusting) ghost tricks, and fun cartoonstyle graphics Vito A smile, a song and a quick takeover bid before breakfast. Head of the family, master of the house, wearer of the trousers (until he's scared out of them). The man-eating sofa! The TV presenter! CONS: The jokes wear thin after a while, and longevity is a bit lacking. Flo GRAPHICS The animation can be a bit ropey on the sprites but on the whole they are very funny. The monster in the attic! The bleeding table! Mother, devoted wife, member of the local high school's governing board, chief high coven of the local satanic worship cult. An all-round normal housewife. Tunes are nothing special and effects hardly push the machine to its limits. Tony Fish-tank shark! The haunted helicopter! Typical American high school brat. Into heavy metal, ninjas, model aircraft, pet frogs, mucky mags under the bed, etc. GAMEPLAY Finding out about the tricks is entertaining but the whole thing is a little too easy. Mimi With only four houses and one family to haunt it gets a bit repetitive. The lovely daughter. Into dolls, easylistening pop music and teen idols called Corey. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES The computer mouse! ITTITT THAT'S TRULY DISGUSTING VERDICT ONWO006 nullulii E M MSS OK! HIT Amongst all the many wonderful tricks and traps you can set for the Sardinis, one of the best is situated in the lavatory. Find a spanking new toilet and trap it. Wait for one of the Sardinis to spend a penny and sit back to enjoy the delights of what can best be described as the Turd Monster. As soon as someone approaches it, up pops 'a disgusting brown creature which immediately shoves its hand into the bowl and starts lobbing... ahem... stools everywhere. And I'm not talking about the three-legged wooden variety What can I say about a game that features a turd monster? Haunting is certainly one of the more original games to arrive on the Megadrive and the first few times you play it really is pretty funny. But, as with most comedies, once you've seen the jokes you've seen it all and it soon becomes repetitive. It's also let down by the dungeon sections, which are just plain dull and serve to annoy rather than add variety, and the rather strange control method for Polterguy doesn't help. However, Haunting does provide a few chuckles and a good couple of afternoons worth of entertainment. GARTH SUMPTER "


"LREVIEW MEGADRIVE by VIRGIN VIRGIN .99 OUT: Now. Contact Virgin Interactive Entertainment (081 960 2255) for information.    O2ed POPULOUS ? @ j 2 2222JJURUZZZRCURIO Uneven land prevents your people from building large houses, so flatten as much as possible to help them out.  BAD MANAS  DZIRDRUNJELJOPJOze:220 Sick of God botherers? Pretend you're getting rid of them with this game!  ouldn't it be great if you could just summon up a lightning strike and remove offending personalities from your life? Well, you can get a taste of this kind of power in Populous 2, the sequel to, you guessed it, Bullfrog's groundbreaking Populous. As a minor god on a backwater planet, you've got to ensure your survival by beating off your rivals using a variety of godly powers. Naturally, gods are too aloof to fight themselves, so they take it out on each others' worshippers. When a god loses all his believers, he's stripped of his powers and kicked out of wherever it is gods live. All you have to do is protect your interests and start hurling those lightning bolts. Without believers, your god is as useless as a paper hat in a monsoon. Believers generate the gods power, called Mana, which allows him to do all his wizzo divine-type things. Naturally, you have to protect your worshippers or end up completely mana-less. The amount of worshippers you have is depicted in an area at the top-left of the screen. If your enemy starts getting the upper hand, the only thing you can do is attempt to smite some of his people and level things out.  Tornadoes are one of the excellent wind powers you call on to make life miserable for your rival's people. Lightning bolts are the most precise of your attacks, capable of smiting individual people. Some land is less fertile which prevents populations from expanding. D  EARTH, WIND AND FIRE No, this isn't a box-out on the popular 70s group which none of you will remember anyway; the title actually refers to the many excellent godly powers featured in the game. These fall into four categories:   QUOD  Earth: Rend the ground beneath enemy villages, reducing the land to sea level and seriously annoying the locals. On the other side of the coin, massive volcanoes can be conjured up, complete with lava, to make the land uninhabitable. Fire: For the ultimate in crop and property destruction, use this command. It lets you create gigantic flame columns which obliterate everything in their path. The downside is that they're unpredictable and just as likely to burn your houses and people. Air: Take everyone by surprise on a sunny day by creating a massive electrical storm. These'll zap buildings and ruin land, and the more powerful ones last for quite some time. Water: This isn't as devastating as the other available powers, but it does allow you to place baptismal fronts in enemy territory. Should any of 'his' soldiers fall in, they'll quickly see the error of their ways and change sides!   54 "


"VERDICT MAGNETIC ATTRACTION MEGADRIVE At first glance, at these screenshots at least, you may think \"Hurumph; this is the same as Populous.' It's not, though. One of the biggest failings of the first game was that it soon became very dull. Its sequel gets around this by rationing' your powers, so the really good stuff doesn't appear until you've conquered a few dozen worlds. In fact it's these powers which make for the only real difference between the two games. If you haven't got the first game, this is well worth a look if you fancy dabbling with the lives of mortals. PROS: Excellent godly powers and a huge amount of levels. One key element of the game is the papal magnet. Both sides have one, each symbolising a religion. By clicking the appropriate icon, you can instruct your people to head straight for it useful if you place it in enemy territory, as your followers troop off and beat up the opposition. The other advantage is that, when people meet up at the magnet, they join together to form even stronger folk. When you think the super-person is powerful enough and you've got enough mana in the bank, it's worth turning him into a knight. These ferocious characters are dedicated killers; once called into existence, a knight will head straight for enemy land, killing and destroying everything in his path. He tramples flowers, too. CONS: Very samey throughout, which limits the lasting appeal. GARTH SUMPTER GRAPHICS Miniscule spites and quite dull scenery, but some very impressive special effects. To begin with your powers are rather limited take this puny lightning bolt, for example. But as your population increases so do your abilities. SUUNU Apart from a few unimpressive spot effects, there's not a lot to listen to at all. If you want to be really flash and have loads of mana, try summoning up burning rain, which is always a laugh. BUILDING BLOCKS Easy to learn but difficult to master more than suitable fodder for strategy fans. Unfortunately, the game's repetitive nature kills much of Populous 2's lasting appeal. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES T In order for your people to reproduce, they need smart houses. They'll automatically build a home wherever they find a piece of spare land, but for best results you have to intervene. The more flat land there is around a building, the larger that abode becomes. So, by employing your powers you must create as much flat land as possible. Occasionally it pays to upset a house by raising some land nearby. This reduces its size, resulting in one of the occupants being cast out. Although that might sound like a daft thing to do, it comes in more than handy if you need some people roaming around to fight off enemy attacks. 2 VERDICT OOL IITILILI OY MISSOK HIT Populous II is a big improvement on the original, mainly because, due to the fact that it's not possible to get hold of all your powers in a very short space of time, it takes longer to get through the game and is more involving, hence it's got more of a hold over the player. That said, Populous Il bears more than a few similarities to the original and, as such, if you've got the original you'd be wise to give the sequel a test to see whether it's sufficiently different to warrant purchase. If you're new to Populous, though, go for it! 86 Fire destroys people and buildings, allowing you to rebuild on what was formerly enemy territory. PAUL RAND 55 "

"SNES VERDICT The First Samurai was a great game on the Amiga so it's good to see a SNES version which is even better. There are loads of neat animations, although some of the backgrounds are a little basic and rough around the edges. The sound is also fantastic, with brilliant tunes and some smart samples. And the gameplay is excellent, with dice 'n' slice action galore to keep most people happy for a long time. This is one of the most original platform games in a long time, and the mix of action and problem solving will keep you hooked for ages. PROS: Excellent variety in the gameplay. Looks impressive, too. Most of the general nasties aren't this big, they're just a lot meaner and far harder to kill, so be careful. CONS: A few more levels certainly wouldn't have gone amiss. GARTH SUMPTER DEMONIC DROPPINGS Helpful items are lying around, thanks to absent mindedness on the part of the demons. Collecting these makes your quest a lot easier GRAPHICS Some very nice sprites, but the backgrounds tend to be a little on the grainy side. Mystic Runes: You need to collect five of these to release the big demon boss at the end of a level. Magic Bell: Ring one of these and the Wizard Mage appears Keep back from this guy. It helps to have plenty of energy at this point, as you're odds-on to lose your sword. Warp Lantems Activate a lantern to return to the last force pot. Force Pot: Crouch down next to one of these until it turns blue. It's now a restart point. ONNOS Plinkety-plink Japanese tunes are accompanied by a smattering of good effects. Treasure Chest Collect these to top up your score, not that it makes any difference to the game. Food Basket: One of the most important pick-ups to grab, this replenishes energy Demon Bane: Invokes the power of absolute excellence to splatter all the monsters on screen. 11day There's a good mix of action and problem solving, and it's very addictive. Token: You must collect five of these to summon the boss to battle. CE QU One of the zombies on the train gets a touch of the Blankas as he tries to fry our heroic Samurai. MORTAL COMBAT Despite being taxing, the game is a little too short. More levels would have helped STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 6 The Samurai's main weapon is his sword, but it doesn't stay with him forever. Along with the energy bar is the force scale, and he only gets the sword when the scale is above 70%. Every time he kills a demon the force bar increases slightly. It also acts as an extra energy bar, which allows the Samurai to take a few hits when the normal energy bar runs out. The down side to this is that he also loses his sword and is reduced to fisticuffs until he powers up again. OCO This is the evil Demon Overload you're out to kill. Don't think much of his make-up though. VERDICT o-NWO ULUI Tokyo of the future is infested with zombies and the sewers with jellyfish. MISS LOK HIT Amiga First Samurai was a cracking game. Unfortunately, things got all mucked about when Mirrorsoft (the company that was bringing the floppy version out) went down the tubes. So it's particularly good to see that the SNES version is even better than what was already a very good hack 'n' slay fest. Graphics are polished, sound is a bit tinkly but suitable for the type of game, and the action is unrelenting and very tough. There could have been a few more levels, but what's there is perfectly acceptable and worth any slash fan's attention. 87 Apart from standing around looking mean, this frog puts up little resistance.

"REVIEWSNES SNES by KONAMI TBA OUT: November. Contact Konami (081 429 2446) for information. ZOMBIES Classic Hammer horror comes kicking and screaming to your SNES! un! Run for your lives! The Martians have landed! The undead are rising from their graves! Can't you see, you fool? The aliens have invaded! Whatever the situation, the classic B-movie brigade will sort it out. Zombies takes all the old cliches and bundles them together in one humourpacked cartridge. Basically there's this mad film buffcum-scientist who's created real-life versions of classic B-movie monsters and unleashed them on your home town. Being the only one bright enough to see what's going on, it's up to you to rescue your neighbours before they become lunch! It's Invasion Of The Body Snatchers all over again, as alien pod plants create clones of your character. GHOULS 'N GHOSTS A real rogues gallery of creatures stands between you and victory. Some merely zap your energy, while others slow you down or do loads of damage. The most common creatures are zombies, which are slow-moving and not very bright. Above all they're easy to kill, requiring just one shot from your water pistol. By far the most dangerous character is the chainsaw maniac. The chainsaw he's armed with not only lets him slice up you and your neighbours, he can also hack his way through bits of scenery, so try to keep out of his way. Other nefarious creatures include the Jelly Blobs, whose ectoplasmic offspring attach themselves to your head in order to drain loads of energy. The deadly axe babies appear in the shopping malls, but they're nothing compared to the dangers you face in the factory! 385 The aliens have landed to kidnap Earth's cheerleaders! Watch out for the electricity bolts fired by the mother ship. A CHANGE IS AS GOOD AS A REST Werewolf Kid: In this form nothing can stop you, and that includes walls, doors and fences. Very handy for getting out of tight spots and especially excellent for beat ing the giant baby on level eight. Zombie Child: Green, mean and uncontrollable. Just keep your fingers crossed and hope your character doesn't go anywhere near the neighbours! Ghost: This form is handy for scouting as you can't be hit. On the down side you can't shoot anything either. Being a streetwise kid, no matter how cool, isn't always enough when faced with legions of undead attackers. It just so happens that a bunch of mad scientists were let out as part of a day release program and, during the course of their excursion, left loads of experimental potions lying around. Drinking these can have a variety of effects: here are some of the neatest. 62 "


"GUN-HO VERDICT There are loads of different weapons in the game, but some are more effective against certain creatures than others. Fortunately the manual tells you what's best, so you don't have to expend valuable game-playing time experimenting. Zombies is utter excellence. It's much more than a mere maze game. There's bundles of humour, which is made all the more funny if you actually know the films which are being parodied. The action comes thick and fast as zombies rise from the ground and werewolves leap into the attack you need to keep your wits about you at all times or you'll end up joining the legions of undead. This isn't a remarkable game in any single area, but what there is combines to form a hugely addictive romp that you miss at your peril. Soda cans: Stuns Bruce the chainsaw maniac and blows the demon babies apart! Squirt gun: A useful weapon against zombies, but quite iffy against anything else. Bazooka: Deadly against all life-forms, but even better for blasting away walls. Fire Extinguisher: Freezes enemies. Best against the Jelly Blobs. GARTH SUMPTER OWOWOT Weed Eater: Cuts through mutant plants as if they weren't there. Plates: If there's nothing else, frisbee a few plates at the nasties. Tomatoes: A good all-purpose weapon. Simply throw them at the nasties. Ice lollies: Use these to freeze the Jelly Blobs for a short time. SEEK AND DESTROY Apart from blasting monsters, the bulk of the gameplay is based on exploration. Your neighbour-seeking radar only has a limited range, so you need to check the whole level thoroughly. Many areas are It's forty-feet high and angry! Big Baby is only accessible after you've carved not to be messed with. Can you imagine, your way through fences and what the contents of its nappy look like? walls, and then some locations require specific keys. A detailed search of PLAYER PLAYER each area is LEFT RIGHT important, as objects are often secreted in cupboards, under piles of sand or in treasure chests. Of all the items the bazooka is probably the most useful. Armed with one of these you can blow down doors, walls, packChoose the boy or girl; it doesn't make ing crates and other any difference to the game itself, but it obstructions, as well as any creamakes a nice change! tures which get too close for comKnives and forks: The perfect items to use for getting rid of nasty werewolves. Talisman: Conjures up a spinning ball of fire which destroys every thing it touches. S003 VERDICT EDITI ONEN Relive your favourite scenes from Dawn Of The Dead as you hack your way through legions of mouidy stiffs! Has anyone told a stiffy joke yet, by the way? The biggest problem with Zombies is that many of you will not have seen some of the old movies which it's based upon! It takes elements of games such as Gauntlet and Alien Syndrome and backs them up with lots of humour and, best of all, excellent playability. Zombies doesn't really get progressively more difficult in the real sense; many-a-time, after battling through a couple of ridiculously hard stages, you'll come across a level which is a breeze, before being thrust right back into the thick of things. Zombies is a product which stinks of LucasArts' trademark quality. The stages tend to get a little samey, but you don't notice that too much as you're too busy trying to stay alive! A top quality title that you'll go back to time and time again. PAUL RAND Zombies have invaded suburbia and they're hungry for a barbecue, with your mates on the griddle! Splat 'em with your gun. 63 "


"SNES VERDICT SLEEVRO I hate this game, and I'll tell you why. It's so excellent, I sit and play it for absolutely ages, and then get told off because I've done no work all day Zombies is tops, and even if you don't know all of the movies which it's taking the mickey out of, it doesn't matter because the game itself is of the highest quality. There are loads of weapons to use, and you'll need them because some of the monsters can be a real pain in the ass! There's no one reason why Zombies is excellent, just lots of little reasons that combine to form one of the best SNES titles this year! PROS: Great humour and excellent graphics make Zombies stand out from the crowd. These ugly aliens are armed with special Martian bubble gum guns which trap you in a ball of sticky stuff. CONS: It's a little bit on the repetitive side. PAUL ANGLIN CLOWNING AROUND GRAPHICS Excellent-looking sprites, but some of the backdrops are a little bit dull. As well as the weapons, there are plenty of special items to collect. First and foremost are the medical kits, which replenish your energy. At the other end of the scale you have the magic boxes, which annihilate every nasty unfortunate enough to be on-screen at the time. Another handy pick-up is the inflatable clown. Use one of these and a laughing clown punch-bag appears which immediately attracts the attention of any nearby nasties, giving you time to get away. A good variety of fitting tunes and brilliant sampled sound effects. The evil mummies in the pyramids take loads of hits to kill, so it's best to keep out of their way. When you've rescued your neighbours from the pyramid, stick around there are plenty of extra bonuses to be had. GAMEPLAY Non-stop laughs and action make this game instantly enjoyable. A bit more variety in the gameplay wouldn't have gone amiss. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES This stuff is the pits. It's almost impossible to shift and constantly drains energy. B-AGGRESSIVE Cut through the spiky plants of doom with your handy strimmer. ONWA0000  TUTTI SOK HIT The game is set in a number of typical B-move locations, ranging from the inside of pyramids to a college where Martians have landed to kidnap cheerleaders. As an added bonus there's also a special Day Of The Tentacle level, which features the characters from the fab LucasArts game of the same name (reviewed in issue 141). Each type of stage has its own set of hazards, in the pyramids you'll have to avoid spiked floors while negotiating your way around doors which snap shut behind you, whereas gardens contain mutant plants which have to be cut away with a Black And Decker Trim 'N' Edge. 64 "

Lands of ome with us to a land that's free, where people are good and kind. Then witness as the darkness comes and lands them in all sorts of trouble. Gladstone used to be just like any other country hamlet until a shape-changing hag arrived, causing untold havoc. Things don't look too hot the Ruby of Truth, coupled with the Nether Mask, are the only things that can stop her, and these items aren't exactly in places where you can just put your hands to them. Heroes needed, apply within... A life on the ocean wave, de-diddle de dee de dee. ON THE OTHER HAND LEGENDS OF VALOUR HE The British answer to the Yankee Underworld threat doesn't quite hold its own in the gameplay department. The presentation isn't much cop and the graphics, smooth as they are, don't have a realistic enough feel. ly. Whenever something truly important happens here, the game either switches to a very attractive animation sequence (with only slightly dodgy lip-synching) or a close-up of the characters' faces. The animations vary between simply gorgeous to absolutely breathtaking. Scenes such as the opening sequence or the magical preservation of the King's body are truly stunning and, when combined with the stirring musical scores and digitised sound effects, they make for some wonderfully tuneful computer moments. Lovely! XLI The King's court. He caught what? And is it contagious? REVIEWED: N/A forest of all the bad guys, it's safe to assume that there won't be another bunch appearing as if by magic to take you on again. evil power of Scotia, an 'orrible old witch who has recently found a source of unspeakable power. There are plenty of sub-plots along the way that spice things up and keep the game fresh from one encounter to the next. CLOSE UP Bad guy alert! WANDERING THE RUBY OF TRUTH MEETS THE JOCKSTRAP OF One of the things that always irritated about certain other RPGs was that, whenever anything important happened, it would always take place on the same game screen. The resulting scene was often hard to make out clearTHAT JAZZ! Cunning traps No. 34A. Wait until your opponent is halfway across the drawbridge, then raise it quickly. VERDICT Fantasy games are always chockfull of silly made-up names and legendary 'Items of Power'. Lands of Lore, although guilty in a couple of places, doesn't fare too badly in this respect. The ruler of the land is the sensibly-named King Richard, not Grandalthraxx the Overseer or something equally unpronounceable, and the land is tentatively titled Gladstone, instead of somewhere with vowels at either end and three or more Zs in the middle. The plot, such as it is, sees you initially in search of the Ruby of Truth and the Nether Mask (hey, I didn't say it was completely perfect) in order to fend off the I hate wandering monsters, they're the bane of every adventurer's existence. There you are, happily wandering through a densely wooded area minding your own business, when all of a sudden there's a rustle in the bushes behind you and bingo, four Orcs are bearing down on you from nowhere, with sharp pointy swords in their hands. And what does it have to do with the plot? Nothing. Not a sausage. Fortunately for Lands Of Lore, there doesn't appear to be any 'true' random encounters. The monsters in each section seem to have been pre-placed and then left to walk around at will. Therefore, once you've cleared a Lands Of Lore is everything that Eye Of The Beholder III should have been and more besides. It has an engaging storyline, beautiful presentation, workable controls everything you could want from an RPG (apart from Underworld-style scrolling). The best thing is the magic. Finally, an RPG that has good magic effects. If there is a fault it's that the game is a touch easy you're able to camp and heal after each fight, seemingly without interruptions. Apart from that, Lands Of Lore comes highly recommended. PAUL RAND "


"YOUUTT LIKE THIS NOT A LOT Magic is the ever-important ingredient for any fantasy RPG and Lands Of Lore has a system that's easy to use but comprehensive enough to take care of most tastes. Plus, the graphical effects when spells are cast are much more impressive than the usual text descriptions you have to read in other games. Depending on which character you choose, you'll start the game with different levels of magical ability. Each spell you obtain has four levels of power, selected simply by clicking on the spell icon following the required number. The higher the level of spell the more energy it takes from you. Simple, n'est pas? PROS: Beautiful presentation mixed with a captivating storyline. CONS: Although the storyline keeps you hooked, it isn't difficult to progress through the game. Welcome to Gladstone keep King Richar awaits you in the throne room. Ah, Conrad Because of the threat from Scotia, I now have an urgent need for Ruby of Truth. Please retrieve it from Roland s estate in the Southland and return it to Gladstone. MOP MOP EES ZN17 GRAPHICS Wonderful animations and semismooth scrolling with some excellent spot effects. Â«My man, Richard wants to see me.\" \"Later dudes, the King wants to rap with me awhile. Yo.\" What? An evil witch is threatening to destroy Gladstone? I think I know how to handle a woman. ONNOS Realistic effects and great music, especially when using combination sound cards. Oh, so you come to see Victor! Afraid of Scofia's new toy? Ha Ha! Why atraid? Look at Victor Myself could use a shapechanger! Ha Ha Ha GAMEPLAY A little too easy in places but on the whole, enough to keep you hooked. 1 2331 EKAI Just in case she's immune to my charms, I'd better take along one or two little backup supplies.

Kick Smace Punch Burf waf where's the blood gone Acclam's SNES biggie? ven with Streetfighter Turbo out on import, Mortal Kombat is still the beat 'em up everybody is talking about. You saw the Megadrive version in our August issue where it clocked up a massive 90%; now the SNES version is with us, bringing along with it all sorts of controversy. Nintendo didn't like the idea of having so much blood and gore in a SNES game, so they flexed their sizable biceps and told developers Sculptured Software very nicely that they didn't want to see so much as a drop of claret in their nice beat 'em up, not even in cheat mode form. Does this harm the game? Check out the review and see for yourself! VERSION 1 MEGADRIVE Cage punches the head off his beaten foe, which produces a satisfying shower of blood, making the victory worthwhile. 10B 1000 SUB-ZERO 41 PUSH START CACE CAGE WINS DEATH! DESTRUCTION! SLAUGHTER! One of the hardest features of the game to master are the death moves. These really serve no purpose whatsoever other than to really grind your opponent's nose into the dirt, or blow his head off, depending on the character you're controlling. When you've inflicted enough damage on your hapless foe, he'll start swaying, unable to fight back, and the message 'Finish Him' appears. Just walk up to him, pull off the right combination of Dpad juggling and button pushing and you'll make sure your opponent won't be entering next year's competition by decapitating him in some way. A direct hit to the head produces a spray of spit rather than blood. Urg! VERSION 2 SNES The SNES version, on the other hand, has him simply kicking in the heart of his opponent, with a minimum of blood and only the slightest hint of twitching limbs. Far less offensive, in the eyes of Nintendo. Hurumph. Sub Zero freezes Cage, but if he launches another it'll backfire and he'll be the one who's cold. VERDICT BLED DRY Everything you've heard about Nintendo wanting the blood taken out of this version of the game in entirely true. Blows are exchanged without a drop of the red stuff being spilled. Apart from not looking very pretty, this also makes it very tricky to tell exactly who is hitting who. The death moves are still in, although they have been toned down considerably. Even when Scorpion impales a character on his spear there's no blood. Boo! Just take a look at Cage's death move to see the radical differences What? No blood! I have to admit, I was disappointed to see the lack of gore in the SNES version of Mortal Kombat without it, the game lacks that 'oomph' which makes the coin-op and Megadrive versions such crackers. Having said that, the actual game itself is an improvement over Sega's version, with much better and bigger sprites powering around the screen. Without the blood spattering all over the shop it's hard to make out whether you're actually coming into contact with your opponent at times, but generally, apart from those gripes, this is a solid conversion of the coin-op. A blistering uppercut smashes Sub Zero's jaw, not that you can tell. PAUL RAND Cage uses an extremely below-the-belt move to help Kano in his ambition to become a soprano opera singer. "


"VERDICT UNYA SNES SONYA 2 TIME BOHUS Impressed as I was with the Megadrive version's graphics, nothing prepared me for these! SNES Kombats graphics are almost arcade-perfect. The characters are massive, superbly rendered and excellently animated. Omitting the blood, though, was a major mistake. For me, the gory violence was the main attraction of the coin-op, and this version just doesn't have the same feel without it. That's not to say it's a bad game; the excellent graphics almost compensate for the sanitised gameplay, but at the end of the day I'm sticking with the bloody, violent and depraved Megadrive version. PROS: Stunning digitised graphics and truly excellent backdrops. CONS: No blood! Makes a huge difference to the feel of the game PAUL ANGLIN The first lady of Mortal Kombat proves that you don't need have a fashionable outfit to fight well. KOMBAT KRISES 1024500 30 PUSH STAR RAYDEN REPTILE REPTILE WINS High quality digitised characters which are very well animated Climbing the Kombat ladder of excellence is no mean feat. First, you've got to prove you're a worthy challenger by wiping out every other competitor in one-on-one matches. If you can do that, you're still not worthy to challenge Goro or Shang Tsung, the last two characters; all you've proved is that you could possibly fight your way to the front of the queue in Sainsbury's. You now have to take on the fighters in pairs. As soon as you've flattened one, the second appears, so energy conservation is vital. There's also a bonus fighter who doesn't crop up on the list of entrants. Reptile, as he likes to be known, is a combination of Sub Zero and Scorpion, with both their moves and a green costume. Don't believe us? Well, there he is on the right! Grunts, groans, smacks crashes and plenty of top tunes. SOM Without the blood and gore, it's hard to tell who's hitting who. Jumping attacks are your best bet to defeat him, as he'll use his spear and freeze attacks as soon as you land. Don't get too close to him either, as he'll throw you around the arena before you can lay a finger on him. LARGER THAN LIFE A very difficult beat 'em up with loads of different moves to learn Scorpion's best move is his spear attack which he uses to pull his enemy in close for the kill. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 8 Before you go off crying into your pot noodles at the game's lack of blood, SNES Mortal Kombat does have one significant advantage over all the other versions its graphics. They may not be blood-soaked at the end of a match, but this is the closest thing to the coin-op you'll find. Sprites couldn't be more spot-on quite apart from being massive, they're also perfectly animated and, above all, fast. Goro himself is slightly more convincing than he is in the Megadrive version, although he still looks like a dodgy stop-motion model at times. SCURPLN ONWAU ullllllll 0= MISS OR HIT Watch out of Sonya's energy blast. It travels so fast your best bet is to block rather than try to avoid it. I bet that hurt!

Contact Dream Machines (0429 869459) for information. t's like an episode of The Twilight Zone. Dinosaur Parts of the game have more than a biscuits, t-shirts, gloves, slippers, magazines and Jittle in common with Aliens: things you can't even open a packet of cereal without conreally get stupid when the Compys start chewing Grant's mush in true fronting some kind of prehistoric promotion. Finally face-hugger style. the Megadrive game is with us, and despite the movie's logo plastered all over it, Jurassic Park actually has more to do with the book than the flick. Absent are all the stars of the film bar Alan Grant, the paleontologist hero who makes Indiana Jones look like Emo Phillips, and included are such elements as the river, where Grant has to escape Rex by taking to the water in a dinghy. Triceratops: This guy won't give you any trouble, just jump over him. He'll only charge if attacked. CUNNING STUNT \" DIE habhi Dilophosaur: These lads gob foulsmelling est acidic mucus at you, so take them out at a distance with your dart gun. JURASSIC PARK Grant's various weapons have several different effects. The blue tranquilisers will only stun small dinosaurs, while the red ones are powerful enough to take out Raptors for around ten seconds Additionally he also has a Tazer gun, which electrocutes any dinosaurs that get too close. At the other end of the scale, Grant can tool up with concussion grenades, which temporarily blind the larger dinosaurs, including Rex, making them particularly useful for getting out of tight spots. Velociraptor: The fastest and, bar Rex, deadliest dinos in the game. They chase you throughout the park. Save the red darts and concussion grenades for them. VERDICT Oh dear, the Raptors have escaped and they're hungry. Presumably the kids aren't in the game because Grant's wisely bought himself some time by feeding them to the dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus Rex: Get too close and Rex will gobble you up in one nasty snap, leaving behind just your cap. He can be distracted with concussion grenades. Jurassic Park was a big undertaking for the programmers, and in bringing the action across they haven't done too bad a job. Where they have gone horribly wrong is the gameplay. The controls are really dodgy, and it's all too easy to send your character plummeting to a sticky death. Being able to play the Raptor is a nice touch, but it seems very much like an afterthought, and as such there are all sorts of problems steering the thing through levels which were designed for a character half its size. Plenty of good ideas let down by poor execution. PAUL ANGLIN Pterodactyl: These winged beasties swOOP down on Grant during the jungle stages. They're quite tricky to hit, so try to avoid them instead, He's not so clever now is he? The TRex makes swift work of Grant, who foolishly got too close to its gaping jaws. Better luck next time..... Procompsognathus: These minuscule terrors are the equivalent of the face huggers in Aliens. They'll munch on Grant's face until he shakes them off. Crouch and blast them with the blue darts, T-WRECKS The dinosaurs are everywhere in the park, from the toilets to the power station. The place is in a real state, with cracked pipes and loose electricity cables compounding the natural hazards Worst of all the T-Rex periodically takes an interest in you. The first you know about this is when you hear the rhythmic pounding of his footsteps, then a few moments later his head will burst through a nearby wall. So keep an ear open at all times. 70 "

The map shows your progress across the island. Unluckily for you the docks are right on the opposite side from where you start. I've seen the film five times now, and it still gets the old ticker going. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the Megadrive conversion. The sprites are impressive enough, but backdrops are grainy and a bit poor. It's the gameplay which is the problem, though; controls are awkward, especially when you're controlling the Raptor which half the time seems to do what the hell it wants. The attraction of the film is the fact that you've never seen anything like it. Megadrive Jurassic Park, on the other hand, has been done a million times before. And better. The music is terrible, although there are some good samples. PAUL RAND GRANT VS RAPTOR One novel feature of the game is that you can play the bad guy, in this case the Raptor. While Grant has all his nice weapons, the Raptor employs its razor-sharp sixinch claws and deadly teeth, which makes it an altogether more interesting character. But when it comes down to it who's the best? > 22 Dr Grant has to employ all his Ils as a paleontologist to escape e island, such as swinging from vine to vine and shooting dinosaurs with dart guns.

HIT NAME: Raptor, Veloci OCCUPATION: Dinosaur MISSION: Eat things, then do a runner The Raptor has no need for weapons: simply jumping on his prey is enough to slice enemies practically in half because he's so hard Being the meanest dinosaur in the park means he has very few enemies apart from the same war dens and even then there's not much they can do other than die hombly.

"TREVIEW SNES by LASER BEAM .99 OUT: November. Contact Laser Beam (071 585 5116) for information. BLADE RUNNER ON YOUR SNES? NEARLY! SHADOURI Beam's latest creation draws heavily on the movie Blade Runner while 'borrowing' certain elements from the classic William Gibson novel, Cyberpunk, You're dropped right in the thick of things as soon as the game starts. The opening scene has a pair of mortuary attendants loading your body for storage while going on about how your brain was fried. Next thing you know your limbs start twitching and you're up and about, with no idea who you are or how you got into your current predicament. From this tenuous position you've got to work out exactly what's going on and just where you fit into the scheme of things... YOUR BODY All's quiet on the Shadowrun front, but you can be sure that inings will not up in a short space of time!  :) One main feature of the game is roerspace. In case you don't know what that is, yoerspace was a concept touted around towards the end of the Eighties, mainly by hippies and new-wavers, of a virtual computer generated world. To enter Cyberspace in the game you first have to track down a cyber deck, which connects to a socket in the side of your head! It's not safe, though; yoer-merce naries, called Deckers, prowl around looking for unwary prey. If you're killed in toerspace, you also buy it in real life. Bars like this one are great places to pick up information. Most of the locals aren't very friendly, though. VERDICT It may be the future, but people have learned how to wield magic You start off with less magic talent than Ali Bongo; however, mages can be hired for the right price. These are usually real weirdos who'll perform all sorts of magic feats for an unfeasibly large sum of cash. Alternatively you could always try a bit of spellcasting yourself. There are several secdy shops where you can pick up strange coloured potions which are rumoured to have strange magi, cal properties. Health is another thing that doesn't come cheap, although a good night's kip is usually enough to take care of most wounds, someumes, though, you just can't find a cra, sa trip to the doc's is in order Apart from being inordinately Cloensive, you can't always erozct to leave with the same bits you came in with... The peculiar mixture of action, role playing and problem solving in Shadowrun doesn't seem to gel together at the outset. However, the game soon takes a turn for the better when you discover some jerk's planted a bomb in your head! Shadowrun is very absorbing, although the solutions to some puzzles are a little obscure. My only criticism is that the graphics are a bit rough. More care n this area would have made Shadowrun a classic. As it stands this makes an excellent change from the plethora of shoot 'em ups doing the rounds on SNES. PAUL ANGLIN Hey always use your green Cross code, otherwise your guest will come to a rather sticky end, 72 "


"VERDICT SNES am.com STERENDE Magic shops are run by strange men with starey eyes and big hats. Their merchandise is vital to your mission. I immediately noticed the similarities between Blade Runner and this game; the dark, futuristic streets; the fact that the baddies are called Deckers (the name of Harrison Ford in the film). Shadowrun is a great game, packed with atmosphere and engrossing gameplay. The city seems to go on forever, and there's enemies around every corner and behind most doors. The magic aspect is interesting, and had the graphics been a little better, this would have been a real classic. Shadowrun's still excellent as it is, though; a welcome change from the SNES norm.  PROS: Well executed, if not original, concept. Absorbing gameplay. CHAMELEON CONS: Complicated at times and controls can be a bit awkward. PAUL RAND SOONER THE BERETTA Being a natural hard-nut, your character has a number of skills and attributes which help him through the game. To begin with he has only limited talents with firearms and computers, as well as mediocre strength and stamina. As you progress through the game ou build up karma points, which can then be spent on improving sidills, or alternatively developing your magic abilities. Better skill with firearms, for example, gives you more accurate shots. One sood way to earn plenty of karma, and cash, is in the arena. Here You're simply put in the ring with another person and the last one standing wins. On regaining consciousness your first priority should be tracking down a weapon. Here's how to get your mitts on a rather useful Beretta pistol. GRAPHITI Rough in places and sprites are too small, but they're easy enough to make out. 1 You wake up in the morgue with no idea how you got there. All you know is your brain feels like it's on fire and somebody wants you dead. A host of fantastic tunes combined with excellent sampled effects add atmosphere. 2) The mortuary attendants aren't very pleased to see you, and immediately do a runner. Open the fridge to find a patch, which is the futuristic equivalent of Band-Aid. 3) It's all quiet on the streets, until a punk comes running up to you. Don't panic; he's not going to mug you, just give you some useful advice. GAMEPLAY An easy game to get to grips with while still being suitably challenging. This is where you're taken to keep out of the way of hitmen. It also acts as home to the arena 4) He doesn't have much to say for himself, but the general advice is get yourself a gun. Which is all very well, but he doesn't tell you where to go for one. A massive game that's extremely absorbing it'll take ages to complete. 5) Head down this alley, but keep an eye out for snipers in the building opposite. Even when you're armed they're almost impossible to hit. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Shadew case 10 9 6) You could be in big trouble here if you're not careful grab the gun and blast that crazy Orc to smithereens. If you win, search its body and take the leather jacket. Good weapons are vital as you come under attack on virtually every street. Pay a visit to a gun shop such as this. COOLTO IIIIIIIIII TITUTI SHIT The different parts of the city are linked together by a monorail. The service is reliable, but the food is crappy. "

Aii 35 % 0 Primaru 100% 1000 100% 1000 THUNDERHAWK FREE DEE Iver since the Mega-CD first appeared, people have been waiting for something really spectacular. Well, the wait is now over Thunderhawk is with us! Putting all the Mega-CD's hardware potential to good use, Derby-based Core have come up with some of the greatest 3D graphics to be seen on the Megadrive. As the military's top helicopter pilot, you're sent to various locations around the world to sort out local troubles with maximum aggression. You're briefed on what needs doing, the ground crews load up your \"copter with big missiles and the rest is entirely up to you. AWESOME ARSENALS There's no point in piloting the latest piece of hightechnology aerial death unless you have a good array of weapons to drop on the heads of those who defy you. Missiles: Designed to 155 ILE take out aerial targets as well as ground-based ones, you should always save a few for enemy helicopters. Thunderhawk's graphic excellence is made possible through a combination of the Mega-CD's built-in graphics chip and a special software engine designed by Core. The result is spectacular. The landscape is all scaled, Mode-7 style, but instead of having small areas which repeat, each combat zone has its own map. So the same roads and rivers will be there every time you visit. Not being the types to let a good thing lie, Core are already 8.D. cracking on with their next 3D extravaganza which will be based around the same nucleus as Thunderhawk. Rockets: These ROCHET unguided missiles are one of your mainstay weapons. Just point yourself at a target and unleash a volley. It's vital you listen to what your commanding officer has to tell you. VERDICT RCS: Runway cratering system Use this nifty bit of kit to make a mess of enemy airbases. You only get two shots, so make sure you get it right When you get down to it, Thunderhawk is a very basic game. You're never asked to do anything other than shoot lots of things and survive. In fact, it's got no right to be as playable as it is. Maybe it's because it's so fast, the excellence of the graphics or the brilliant way the tanks explode and burn. Whatever, Thunderhawk is extremely addictive and there are so many missions to get through the disc is certainly value for money. There's room for improvement, but that's not to take anything away from what is undoubtably a fine blast. KILL GORE MAIM DEATH As you experience life on the sharp end of enemy fire you'll need to have all your wits about you. The bulk of enemy forces are ground-based and these come in three types. Trucks are the least of your worries; they can't fight back so pick on them if you fancy pushing up your kill rate. Next in order of hardness are tanks. They can only attack you with machine guns, which tear away your helicopter's armour. Worst of all are the Surface-to-Air Missile batteries, or SAMs for short. These lock onto your 'copter then blast it with deadly missiles. Cannon: The weapon you'll always end up using as it never runs out.

The 3D is awesome, and being able to fly around in it and shoot lots of top enemies too well, what can I say! There's one gripe I do have though, and that's the fact that the missions tend to be a bit samey; that's not really a problem with many flight sims as you've got a lot of keys to contend with and that keeps you busy, but with just a three-button joypad to contend with it's noticeable. Still, this is hopefully the start of good things to come on Mega-CD; buy it!

"LREVIEW PC by KONAMI .99 OUT: Now. Contact Konami (081 429 2704) for information. The Caped Crusader looks down on a quiet Gotham City. ith Batman more than well represented on consoles, it's time for him to strike back on PC! Once again, he's after the nefarious Penguin, but don't expect another action-packed slug fest; this version is designed to tax your brain power. Batman Returns has been programmed by Park Place, who are better known for the smash-hit Megadrive titles John Madden Football and EA Hockey. In-keeping with their innovative image, they've gone all-out to make the break from the platform style which dogs licenses of action films such as this to create a sort of pseudo adventure-cum-interactive movie. Sounds strange? Read on and find out more. BATMAN internet a RETURNS WEATS THE STREETS OF GOTHAM Being an ace crime-fighting weirdo, Batman isn't content to wander the streets with the plebs; 'he takes to the rooftops when he wants to get around. Because of the game's point and click control system, there are a number of ways for you to move Batman around. First you can click on one of his gadgets such as the rope, and he'll put it to use by swinging to a nearby location. The alternative is to just click on any nearby building or precipice which looks like a likely location for a bit of 'swing action and let him go. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT Seeing as prancing around rooftops in broad daylight dressed as a bat would attract a lot of unwanted attention, Batman does all his work at night. Fortunately it's winter in Gotham at the moment, so the Caped Crusader has between 6.00pm and 6.00am in which to perform his crime-busting, activities. Like Dracula, Batman has to return home before light, only in his case he won't turn to dust; he'll just miss his breakfast. Once back at the Batcave, you can feed any clues you've collected into the main computer, then cross-reference them with a database of different personalities and locations around Gotham. Beat the baddies, Batman! VERDICT Out of all the Batman games, this one is without a doubt the closest to the film. The graphics are superb, although I recommend you run it with at least two megabytes of RAM, otherwise you'll have to endure agonising gaps in the action as the game accesses the hard drive. I was quite surprised by the game's lack of action, though; combat is computer controlled, as is the driving section. All you have to do is use the available evidence to nail the Penguin once and for all. This is a stylish game, but direct control in combat would have made it so much better. GARTH SUMPTER I wonder if he can pick up Premier League footy on one of those screens? 76 "


"BELT UP! VERDICT A Batman game just wouldn't be the same without the gadgets, and this one's loaded with them. Simply enter the vault in the Batcave then instruct the Batcomputer to load up the utility belt with the toys of your choice. Batman Returns is a mish-mash of different styles, from Secret Of Monkey Island 2 to Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. And to be honest, it really does play rather well. It looks ace sprites and backgrounds are suitably moody, even though Batman tends to walk like a girl! Being of the point and click variety, Batman Returns doesn't possess a vast amount of real interaction in fact, when the programmers are given the opportunity to have some proper action, ie the fighting section, they blow it! Still, this is a very smart piece of software that I last you a long time AND restore some faith in movie licenses. PROS: Stylish gameplay and graphics plus excellent music. Grapple gun: Lets Batman climb up walls. CONS: There's hardly anything in the way of interactive action. PAUL RAND Gauntlet: Fires two grapples in different directions, allowing Batman to slide down. GRAPHICS Large, well animated characters keep the look close to the movie. Batrope: Gives Batman Spidermanlike swinging abilities. BU N ICATIONSNES TO THE TERE TOLD THAT THE VIOLENCE KILL OR BE KILLED When he's not at home poking into the private lives of Gotham's elite crime lords on his computer, Batman likes nothing more than hit: ting the streets and beating the criminal element to a pulp. Rather than take direct control of Batman in combat, you merely set his aggression level and let him get on with it. The higher it is the more damage he'll dish out, although he runs out of energy faster, while a low setting conserves energy, but Batman will hardly throw a punch. In addition to fisticuffs, you can also get him to chuck Batarangs at his foes, which take out his opponents in one hit. You only get a limited supply of these smart weapons, so use them wisely. UNNOS Constant variations of the Batman theme play throughout. \"The top story tonight Tiddles is safe!' Hmm, must be the regional news... Lock Pick: Opens any door that Batman finds.

We've got our hands on a hot-offthe-ROM-burner pre-production version of Sonic's next outing and it promises to be a real corker! Once inside the needle red-lines, the screen shakes and Sonic blasts out at super-sonic speed. VRINBALL While we eagerly await the release of Sonic CD and news of Sonic 3, those kind folk at Sega have come up with a stop-gap title to prevent Sonic junkies developing lives after they've beaten Robotnik for the umpteenth time. Sonic Spinball, as the title suggests with all the subtlety of a brick through a plate glass window, finds the gallivanting hedgehog trapped inside a giant pinball table built by the evil Professor himself Only you and your skill with the flippers can save him; fail and he faces a molten death worse than anything he's encountered before, Robotnik's been busy since his last thrashing at the hands of Sonic. While on holiday on a secluded island, he decided to buy the place up and tum it into a hedgehog-proof fortress. The Veg-O-Fortress, as he calls it, is home to a massive robot factory, capable of producing enough metal maniacs to conquer the entire world. Being an all-round good egg, Sonic once again sets out to thwart Robotnik's latest crazed plan, only to find himself caught up in the devious one's Pinball defence system.

To operate the tables' various traps, Robotnik has once again captured Get into a loop and you'll be shot out either into another loop or a different room altogether. Sonic, slipping in-between the final set of flippers doesn't mean a lost credit: instead, he ends up impaled on spikes or buming in a massive pot of molten rock. All the traditional pintable features are there as well, such as bouncers, accelerators and sates. They don't just add to your score; as the tables scroll sideways as well as up and down, you need to use these features to guide Sonic to the outer-reaches of the levels. Each table is massive, and at times it seems more like some sort of exploation game rather than pinball. All te familiar elements of the Sonic platform games are here, including ings and emeralds.

Sonic doesn't spend the entire game curled up in an unrecognisable ball. On each table there are several locations where he unwinds into his familiar shape. When in this form your control of Sonic is limited to jumping and sliding left and right, which is enough to get him back onto the table. Sonic Spinball is shaping up to be a real cracker. It's fast, loud, colourful and going to be a mega-smash Watch out for it this Christmas. If you're not quick with the flippers Sonic will come to a rather messy end. 79 "


") by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 MEGADRIVE OUT: October. Contact EA (0753 549226) for info. ou can't help but get the feeling that EA were a little concerned as to how people would receive this game when you see the section in the manual which describes the differences between this and their previous hockey titles. Next to the John Madden series, EA's hockey titles, also devised by top programming team Park Place, constitute some The aim of this bit is to slap the puck of the biggest selling Megadrive games ever. But before your opponent. There's no skill unlike the Madden carts, will NHLPA '94 be big needed, just keep pumping the shot button to come out on top. enough to stand out when compared to its ancestors? PROS: Fast, furious and fun. And compatible with the four-player adaptor. CONS: Not much of an improvement over the previous EA Hockey games. GRAPHICS Smooth animation and good digitised pics of all the different players. some inexplicable reason, EA have removed the fighting and blood which many people (at least us lot) regarded as key elements in the first games. Boo! For Montreal Patrick Boy MATCHUPS UNT DE BOUT zs Bren . BORDROBN COLD 72 organ tunes plus an array of sampled grunts and groans. There's no point in try to tackle the keeper head-on as he's to well padded and very fat The pundits give you a run down on the two teams before a match, telling you who's hot and who's not. FOUR PLAY Hockey '94's main attraction comes from it being the first game to work with EA's new four-way adaptor. If you get your hands on one of these gadgets and the extra joypads, you can try out the excellent two-a-side game and have a crack at performing the excellent one-touch shots with your mates. No more than two players can play on the same team, though, so you won't be able to gang up with your mates to give the Megadrive a good thrashing. Other four-player games on the way include John Madden's '94, EA Sports Soccer and Bill Walsh College Football, most of which should be available before Christmas wahay! GAMEPLAY Highly addictive from the first faceoff, and a dream in multi-player mode. SLAP SHOT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THEN? Chances are you're looking at these screenshots and thinking to yourself 'It looks a bit like NHLPA '93, doesn't it'. You're dead right; it looks almost identical, and it plays similarly, too. It's not all the same, though; EA have added loads of features, although most of them only count for something if you're a fan of the sport who in this country really needs the 1993-94 NHL player ratings? On the other side of the coin, you can now control the goalie, take part in penalty shootouts and execute flip passes. For Great, if you haven't already got an EA Hockey game! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES With the aim being, as with most team sports, to plant one in the net, there's a formidable array of shots open to you. Tapping C executes a basic strike, which is useful for slipping one round the keeper, while holding the button down launches a powerful slap shot, the nature of which depends on the direction the player is facing and his position in relation to the goal, although it's not hard to figure out where the best places to shoot from are. A new one-touch shot has been added to this version which, if you get it right, will blast the puck hard enough to flatten the keeper! The goalies in '94 are a lot better than their predecessors. These guys will now risk life and limb to defend their net IIIIIIIIIIII ONWA0000 VERDICT w $ 206 .. MISS OK HIT Apart from the four-player aspect I can see absolutely no point in buying this if you have any of the other games in the series. In fact, with the fighting taken out there's even less reason for me to play this. On the other hand NHLPA '94, like its predecessors, is still one of the best games on the Megadrive. It seems simple to begin with, but after a few goes you really begin to appreciate the amount of skill required to play it well. If you've got '93, there's no reason to get this other than for the four-player option. If you haven't got your hands on EA hockey yet, what's kept you? G59 Slap shots are the most formidable weapon in your arsenal. Time it right and the 'keeper won't be able to stop the puck for love nor money. GARTH SUMPTER 80 "

"by NINTENDO .99 SNES OUT: November. Contact D&A (071 352 6416) for info. PROS: Fast and smooth, with no obvious design flaws. A solid game... Super Scope game! A Super Scope game! That was the cry we gave when Yoshi's Safari was ushered into the CVG office on a red carpet. Gone were the nightmarish memories of hunting maroon-coloured submarines. Banished were the memories of broken promises by Nintendo, insisting a plethora of games would be released before the year's end. We were happy. Then we played it.... BRING A FRIEND DEPRESS HIM TOO CONS: ...which doesn't last very long and is way too easy. GRAPHICS What you'd expect from a Mario game. Cute and cuddly. And big m ONES UMET All your favourite Mario ingredients, The two-player version isn't much cop either. The premise is that while one player has the shiny complex of molten plastic and infra-red wiring that is called the Super Scope attached to his shoulder area, the second player controls Yoshi's movements with a regular joypad. Here! This is it! This is the moment that the design team should have spotted the 'hidden depth' possibilities by including some serious maze-like malarkey and exploration action to enrich this otherwise shallow game. Instead, all the second player does is swing Yoshi from side to side (if you leave him he still steers himself around the course) and duck his head. Oi, and jump too, and... er... that's it. Sorry. Jolly tunes and suitable effects. Nothing supremely special, though. INOS Decide your route. TIMEDIO 000 Keep your finger on the button and wave the scope around the screen. PONER SEDRE GAMEPLAY 0 THAT HILL, GOING DOWN IT I could go into detail about how Yoshi's Safari fares in the long term but instead let me give you this example. When you start the game for the first time, you're initially holding the scope in the proper way, looking through the eyesight etc. By the end of the game the scope has been lowered to your waistline and you're basically just holding down the fire button and waving the thing around the screen (usually while turning your attention elsewhere reading the paper or looking out of the window or scratching your privates or something). Whereas every other Mario game under the sun has had bumper Christmas-sized bundles of hidden depth, extra levels, bonus rooms etc. Yoshi's Safari is quite simply a 'point at the bad guys and press fire' sort of game. I suppose the Mario licence had to produce a turkey eventually, and this is it in all its gobbling glory. This has as much depth as the baby area of your local swimming pool. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Yoshi receives an unfortunate blow. ONWOO 111111 VERDICT MISS OK! HIT When you get down to brass tacks, I suppose Yoshi's Safari is the best Super Scope game available. That's not saying much though, since the only other one in living memory was The Hunt For Red October and we all remember how 'good' that was don't we? It suffers from being a professional, polished game that is just far too easy (I finished it in one afternoon and I'm not exactly the world's greatest marksman). I suppose it you must have a Scope game, this'll be the one for you, but then it's not as though you've much choice, is it? 58 GARTH SUMPTER A spot of blasting beneath the ocean. 82 "

Erm, wait a minute, no it's not. Better luck next time... I've never been a big fan of this type of football game. To me it's always seemed more like British Bulldog than football â€” the aim being to run past the approaching opponents except here they just try to get the ball off you rather than punch you in the stomach (1 went to a rough school). Prime Goal introduces the world to the new J League in Japan and, to be frank, this isn't a wonderful advert for it. Sure, it has nice moments and there's nothing structurally wrong with it.

The game in question is Qix, and its latest incarnation, Cacoma Knights, does it no justice whatsoever. Regardless of what knowledge you glean from the sad storyline, the 86 aim is to guide your character around the screen drawing boxes. When a certain amount has been covered you progress to the next stage. On paper it sounds like a recipe for cack pie with no gameplay at all, but it's actually proved to be one of the most frighteningly addictive game-styles ever. Somehow Seta have made an ass of this simple format and produced a game not worthy of its roots. For starters there are 21 levels but only seven backgrounds. Only utter sad-cases will fail to see each screen by their third go as the early levels are so easy.

I mean, it's not the greatest thing you're ever going to play, but it's pretty harmless fun and attractively priced. The game's still the same; fly from an overhead view around a battlefield landscape, looking for Marines and blowing things up, then switch to a frontal view for the picking-up of 'Our Boys'. The fact that, despite the high level of action, it's not an out-and-out shoot 'em up (there's a teensy bit of strategic thinking involved and it doesn't move at the pace of Sonic), which means that, in my book at least, it generates a fair bit of interest.

These are two of the biggest stars of Nickleodeon, the American cable and satellite kids channel. Ren is an asthmatic chihauhua, while his sidekick Stimpy is flea-bitten moggy. In the game they've become trapped in their television show and you've got to guide them through the stories and back to the real world. The game certainly looks unique, with the graphics remaining faithful to the cartoon. It plays well too, despite being little more than a bizarre-looking platform game.

The reason why Rocky the Raccoon is so out of sorts is that he's also a goblin. Admittedly, he exhibits certain goblin-like powers in the way he can summon up bizarre magic at will, but his raccoon side also lets him use his stripy tail to blat any creatures which get too close. All this translates into a scrolling shoot 'em up with the two characters facing level after level of magic and danger mixed with the occasional bouts of tedium brought on by repetitive attack waves. If it wasn't for the two player mode, Pocky and Rocky would be a lame title. Even with two players to control, Pocky and Rocky still doesn't offer what you'd call gripping gameplay.

"CHEAT ) WHAT'S BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR? ortal Kombat and Streetfighter II have been slugging it out at the top of the beat 'em up pile for months, neither managing to get a particularly firmer foothold on the ladder than the other. But with Streetfighter I Turbo out this week, and Mortal Kombat on SNES and Megadrive out this month, we thought we'd give you an in-depth look at what the self-proclaimed Streetfighter beater has to offer, and who better to show you than the man with wisdom beyond his years, Paul Anglin. You may have noticed a Green Ninja appearing on the screen from time to time. You know the one; he appears between matches and challenges you with such immortal lines as \"Alone is how you'll find me\". If you've been wondering how on earth you get to this character, then worry no more CVG can now exclusively reveal the secret passage to this lad. All you have to do (I say all) is get two flawless victories and a fatality without using the block button on the pit level, but that's not all! There must also be a cloud across the moon when you start the fight; this doesn't happen very often, but for the amount of points you receive for a victory, it's worth waiting. If you manage this then the Reptile Man, for that is his name, will appear and scrap away. And there's the screenshot at the top to prove it.

You'll then receive a smart Napalm Flamethrower to hang on to for the rest of the game. Wahey!

To perform: Starting with straight down, press kick and rotate the keypad 180 degrees anti-clockwise (so that you finish pressing up). Sagat should shout \"TigerÂ» and hit his opponent twice with the knee. Ouch! What? Wasn't our complete guide enough for you? You've still got to have more? Very well, here's Neil Evans of Oxon to satisfy you. To walk through any wall or door in the game, try the following cheat: Walk up to the wall or door and turn around so your back is against it. Hold down the fire button and tap the stick in the way you are facing. Instantly push the joystick in the opposite direction and release the fire button.

"TWANG! TV2 *] CUU RUP BANG! Welcome to another bowel-bustingly brilliant dose of the greatest literary forum in the known universe the one and only YOB's Mailbag. This is the place you discourse on events of state, pontificate on issues of importance and, failing that, make complete asses of yourselves. Luckily there's somebody around here who knows what he's talking about and can put you straight before you get too sad, So if you reckon you're up to it, fire off those laughingly languid efforts in the direction of: YOB'S OH-SOAMAZING MAILBAG, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 3032 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. There's a quite ridiculously good ONE HUNDRED POUNDS for the best letter of the lot and a boot up the botty for the rest. HOT AND SWEATY Dear YOB, I own a SNES and there is a great selection of games but I find that there are very few RPGs. Please could you answer the following questions: 1. Will Monkey Island or Monkey Island 2 ever come out on the Super NES? 2. What is the best RPG for the SNES at the moment? 3. Which of these is the best game: Final Fight. Final Fight 2 or Brawl Brothers? 4. Is there any news of more Super FX games? DANIEL BATIE Gloucester YOB: 1. Still no word, although Monkey 2 might make it. 2. It's not really a proper RPG, but Zelda still beats everything. Shadowrun is good, too. There are a lot of brilliant Japanese RPGs for the SNES, but nobody's translated them for the UK or American market because the software houses don't figure they'd sell. I reckon the softies will wise up pretty soon, though, and we should see a flood of really good stuff. 3. Final Fight is OK, but dated. FF2 is too easy and Brawl Brothers is cack. Get Streetfighter Turbo. 4. Yup. FX Trax will be the next, and there will be four more early next year although I can't be bothered to tell you what they are. There's also a rumours of an FX Mario game, although his Mighty Yobness has received no confirmation yet. 102 "


"Sweet! ifta SAD POSTERS ON THE WALLS Dear YOB, Before I ask some questions about my commy, I would just like to say that you are very funny and very hard, but disappointingly ugly. Your Mailbag is brill but you are mega shady and you need a good slapping. If you don't answer these questions properly me myself will come down to your Mailbag office and give you the slapping you need! 1. When will Streetfighter 3 be out? 2. Will there be any major changes about the game? 3. Why are you so shady? 4. When will the Amiga console be out? 5. Would you like the slapping or not, you brainless geek? ROBYN LUCAS Burnley PS I'm a girl, by the way. YOB: 1. Not for quite a while. 2. Capcom are working on the game as you read this. They say they're incorporating some \"neat new ideas\" and have hinted that the game will be entirely different to that which you might expect. Some of the characters will stay, but quite a few will be dumped in favour of new ones. There have been lots of rumours about who these new characters are, but take it from me that NOBODY knows because it's Top Secret and Capcom staff are sworn to secrecy. 3. How else would I get info like that? 4. Who cares? 5. It's true that you've got a rather sad boy's name, but you're better off sticking to the stuff girls know about being rather crap, not doing much and cry ing a lot. And playing with dollies. By the way, why do you spell your name with a 'Y'? Did your Mum mix you up with a lad and change a letter at the last minute? 0 $ SILLY SKULL PAUL RAND RAVE 1 Dear YOB, I have found a great hidden game in Sonic 2. First complete the game, then unplug it and plug it into a car ashtray. Then put the joypad into the cigarette lighter, press Start and Hey Presto Sega Really Drive. The system comes with one game Drive To The Shops in which you have to drive to the shops before the radio in your head explodes. The graphics are totally realistic, with great touches like stereo screams if you mount the pavement and blood spraying the screen in you hit someone. There's this great bit at the end where you get arrested and put into a High Security Institution for the criminally insane! GARY CUTLACK Lostwithiel, Cornwall. YOB: Remember those pointy tablets the doctor gave you? You've been stuffing them in the wrong end again. Dear YOB, I apologise in advance for what is going to be a seriously sensible letter. I hope the other readers can appreciate my points while you insultingly call me a festering pig's bladder or something. The issue at hand is the death of the multi-format magazine. I first started reading CVG about four years ago (Censor alert. Most of this letter has been deemed too boring for public consumption. A selection of its highlights will follow, together with a censored reply YOB). Steamroller on ...survived...very well written...witless half-experts...

You don't need to send me the hundred quid, but can I have CVG Towers? 2. When do you suck pumpkins at 2.07 in the morning? SPPOING! Dear YOB, It's me again! Thank you for your generous and most honest reply regarding the facts on how useless the Mega-CD is. Anyway, I'd just like to point out how superior the Neo Geo is to other consoles around today. The Neo Geo is (Censored due to underwhelming apathy â€” YOB). By the way, even though you haven't bothered to review a Neo Geo game for the past five months, how would you rate Fatal Fury 2? It's easily the MOST impressive one-on-one beat 'em up so far, and at a reasonable price of . Anyway, why are Nintendo converting Neo Geo titles? What's the point? It'll be useless compared to the speed and graphics of the Neo. That's about it for now. I'm sure that you agree the point of all this. I wonder if you would print this letter unless, of course, you are simply unable to comment on my facts. STEVEN PIERRO North London PS Another fact: all console owners out there who run their systems through PAL and sound through their mono TVs are sad people. YOB: If there's one thing I hate, it's people who show off. And if there's one thing worse, it's people who lash out loads of cash on a machine and then spend the rest of their lives justifying it to themselves. Let's face facts: the Geo is indeed a fine machine, but the number of truly great games available on this console can be counted on one finger. For example, there are now absolutely brilliant conversions of Turbo on SNES and Megadrive, whilst the likes of Mario 3 are to be found on the humble NES. Can anyone name a single Neo Geo title than comes anywhere close to the playability of titles like these? Of course not. Stevie old boy, if you keep spouting claptrap at this rate your nose is going to grow so long it'll curve round and disappear up your own backside. Oh, I see it already has... 3.

TO So HALF-EATEN SARNIES A Dear YOB, In your May issue you printed a letter under the heading Homework Schmomework. It was about a child's concern over his parents not buying him a Megadrive. In your reply you referred to \"Stupid ParentsÂ» saying that their reproductive organs should be removed. I am very concerned with the disrespect you displayed in this letter. For years I have taught my children to love and respect their parents and peers. I respect my children and wouldn't dream of talking to them as you insight (sic) them to talk to us. Don't you feel that you have a responsibility to help teenagers to communicate with respect to their parents and others? Parenthood is hard enough without your letter, which invites disrespect and rudeness instead of the loving, caring attitude my children show toward us their parents. Yours Sincerely EJ COPPING Martlesham, Ipswich. YOB: Are you by any chance an Old Woman? Were you born that way or did it just sort of happen? Were you out having a laugh one day when sadness crept up on you, or did you have to train for years? Are your children Old Women as well, or do they still have a chance?

"MEGARACE PC CD-ROM MINDSCAPE ETBA Life is more fun with a jetpack. PREVIEWS PREVIEWS heap of flaming metal faster than it takes a seven-foot ostrich to bang its head in a six-foot room. Scavenge the wreckage of anyone unfortunate enough to cross the path of your high-calibre automatic weapons during their ritual gunfiring session. Featuring fully-rendered threedimensional graphics and what Mindscape describe as two-dimensional morphing, MegaRace is designed to really make use of a CD-ROM, including over half an hour of digitised video animations. It will be coming out at more or less the same time as Cyberdreams' CyberRace (why do all these games have to have capital Rs in the middle of their single-word titles? Why not just make it two words and be done with it?), a game that deals with many similar concepts, so it will be interesting to see which of the two comes out on top. Whatever happens though, it certainly looks like this coming winter is going to be a very fast, and very lethal, season. Look out for a full review in the future but not too far into the future! Speed. That's what you need for Ja decent racing game. Unfortunately, speed and CD-ROM drives have never really gone hand in hand. MegaRace from Mindscape aims to change all that, however. Combining high-speed precision race driving with out-and-out violence and large guns, MegaRace puts you in the hotseat on a virtual racetrack belonging to the Virtual World Broadcast TV Corporation (it's a bit like the BBC but with snazzy VR headsets). Imagine taking the cast of Wacky Races, giving them all suits of body armour and weapons and then putting them slap-bang in the future. Deal with a whole host of very bad guys with names like Mothrax and Eviscerator, all with individual personalities and racing traits. Dodge hastily constructed obstacles that appear from nowhere and then turn you into a The famous inflating man routine. _WINTER RELEASE Save those wacky time-travellers. EVOLUTION AMIGA/PC  IMAGITEC  TBA Comic platform puzzlers ahoy! From the team that brought you The Humans comes Evolution, a tale of seven men, an alien city and a time machine. Kidnapped by a timetravelling alien collector, six of the world's most notable figures are being held in a state of suspended animation. All looks fine for the alien equivalent of London Zoo until they try to pick up a caveman to finish off their journey. Using a subtle blend of violence and stupidity, the caveman overpowers the aliens and frees the others, paving the way for a problem-packed game of exploration, puzzle solving and cartoon antics. The seven characters are Robin Hood, a Viking, Merlin, Ramasese the Egyptian, a ninja, Confucius and the caveman, each with their own special abilities. The player's task is to combine these abilities to overcome the obstacles in their path, eventually finding the aliens' time machine and returning home. On the way plucky band will stumble across various danger-filled objects such as rocket packs, freezing rays and flying disks. Evolution is filled with cartoon style graphics, 'humorous' music, digitised speech and spot animations for discovering new objects. Using a similar interface to Imagitec's previous puzzler, The Humans, Evolution takes place over five different 'worlds', as well as hidden bonus levels such as the Green Cheese world. Humour is definitely the driving force behind the game, as is evident from some of the animations. Take the discovery of helium gas, for instance; the caveman inhales a lungful, inflates to the size of a balloon and starts to float away, only to be shot down by Robin Hood. As soon as the arrow hits, the caveman starts whooshing around all over the place as the gas expels from his body. Sounds fun. n one of the tracks of MegaRace, and Mindscape confidently predict that they'll be around for years to come. The caveman discovers the wonders of anti-gravity. 9 WINTER RELEASE Beam me up, Uggy. One of the many strange tracks used in Mega Race. 106 "

To vanquish thine enemies is thy task and none shall oppose we brave fellows until thy task is at an end and thine enemy's very life blood seeps from their bodies, casting their souls into the very pits of hell.\" That's likely to be the cry heard when Might and Magic II hits the shelves of your local games store. Either that or Â«Oh Christ, it's another of those role-playing things. Give it to the anorak brigade and give us all some peace and quiet.\" Aye, the noble task of converting the much-loved series from PC to SNES hath befallen Elite and a finer job they could ne'er have done, with a staggering 16,000 locales to visit, 250 animated monsters to combat and over 96 magic spells to play around with. Using an 8Mb cartridge this is billed as the biggest role-playing game ever created. Elite reckon this'll be big and who are we to argue? Following hot on the heels of the previous game, MMII finds the world of Cron in the midst of turmoil. Its leaders have started to vanish, being replaced with chaos and havoc. Sword and sorcery has taken over from law and order and the noble citizens have begun spreading rumours of death and destruction. 'Tis not a good place to be any more. Your task is obviously to find out what is happening and how to rid Cron of its evil curse. Along the way you'll find yourself embroiled in many a sub-plot, rescuing fair maidens from evil and ridding villages of terrible monsters.

Accompanied by a trainee agent and with the chance to rescue and team up with three other F.I.5.H. agents, Operation Starfish boasts new levels of gameplay.

"OSCAR AMIGA  FLAIR SOFTWARE ETBA Frankenstein's monster and witches with broomsticks are just some of the nasties waiting for Oscar. Is anybody ever going to use the Iword 'prehistoric' again? It seems to be Jurassic this and Jurassic that; what's wrong with the Mesozoic era or Cretaceous period, huh? Still, 1 guess it would have to be Jurassic for Oscar since, just like The Last Action Hero, the likeable young chap has been sucked into the world of movies, literally. And it's not just dinosaurs Oscar has to contend with. Cartoon capers, Wild West shoot-outs, The Horror Channel and War Games are just some of the different worlds you'll have to contend with in this forthcoming action platform romp. The basic premise is that Oscar, having been truly immersed in a particular film, has to collect a set number of golden statuettes (let's see if you can guess which ones) before leaving through the exit. After passing through three levels he can progress to another world, chosen by entering Oscar's local cinema multiplex and selecting the desired screen. Waiting for Oscar on the other side of the celluloid are all sorts of nasties, monsters, creatures, elephants Dressed as a vampire, Oscar puts the bite into the Horror Channel. SimCity reaches new heights with version 2000. and rabbits. The last two are actually helpful, acting as game-saving points and awarding extra lives. Oscar will be familiar to anyone who's played Trolls as it uses a very similar engine to that fast and furious title, but with added extras such as underwater sections to each level and much faster graphics. What's more, Flair are working on a specially upgraded CD32 version of the game as well as standard Amiga and PC versions. Expect to see something around the end of September or thereabouts. SIMCITY 2000 PC MINDSCAPE ETBA used to create some truly stunning architecture and design effects and a full music track is being used to heighten the atmosphere not something the original ever had a problem with, though. The control system is remaining the same in order to allow seasoned players straight into the game's new features without delay. Newcomers will also be able to take it on at an easier level, dealing with just the original features first, and introducing the new ones as and when they are ready. With SimCity 2000 leading the way, the original game will be re-released as SimCity Classic The Original City Simulator, and will be packaged with terrain editors and brand new musical effects. AUTUMN RELEASE Cartoon capers with Oscar. Did you ever fill in one of those customer registration forms that came with the original SimCity? If so, did you put any suggestions in as to how to improve the game? If you did then chances are that you're going to be very pleased with the forthcoming SimCity 2000. Incorporating the suggestions made by customers for the past four years, Maxis have taken the original game system for Sim City and turned it into something that not only plays well, but looks pretty special too. Using a brand new viewpoint (one similar to Populous, fuelling more rumours about that SimCity-Populous link-up project that Peter Molyneux of Bullfrog was supposed to be working on), SimCity 2000 includes all the features of the original plus new ideas such as underground railways, eleven different types of power plant, schools, prisons, museums, libraries, angled roads, bus depots, tunnels, waterfalls, mountains and a built-in terrain editor. The graphics are the key difference to the new game, with the ability to zoom in and out and rotate the view to see exactly what's going on. 256-colour graphics are being 1000090 sau Er... the packaging!

"anny'S STOVE 11 SPACE JUNK PC CD-ROM IMAGITEC  ETBA W hat would you say if we were W to tell you that the hero of Imagitec's forthcoming CD-based adventure game was a Rastafarian dog? Yes, that's exactly what we thought you'd say. It's unbelievable but true. And what's more it's not a hand-drawn Rastafarian dog, but a prosthetically made-up Rastafarian dog. Space Junk is possibly the world's first computer game to use latex rubber face masks (like those in Spitting Image only with people inside), and what a difference it makes. Now, when you see someone talking to you, it's no longer only their bottom jaw that moves but their whole body, coming alive with expressive gestures, nervous twitches and exaggerated hand gestures. But what of the Rastafarian dog, mon? Space Junk tells the story of Randolf (the dog), a laid-back trader in search of his missing ship and missing partner. Set against the world of the Federation, a galaxy containing many weird and wonderful creatures (cue Imagitec's rubber mask department), rife with governmental bureaucracy and corruption, the majority of the game is played in a Sierra/LucasArts adventury style, cutting away to the prosthetic close-ups when something interesting happens. Space Hulk certainly sounds like it's one to watch for, and with a release date of around February 1994, you won't have to wait too long.

All that remains to say is, don't miss the full review next ish! rank Herbert's Dune trilogy is widely recognised as one of the greatest works of science fiction this century, which is probably why Virgin took the shackles off the company cheque book to pick up the licence and make loads of cash in the process. While the movie belly-flopped into the pool of great loss-makers of our time, the games have gone from strength to strength on the PC and Amiga. This latest incarnation, on Mega-CD, promises to make the other versions look like the sad impoverished relatives of mad old Twitter McPennyless, the world's poorest man. The plot's a very complicated affair, involving several warring factions, a precious substance called Spice, and a desert world populated by mile-long worms and people with blue eyes.

The film continues to smash all box office records, the book by Michael Crichton is an international best seller and just about anything to do with dinosaurs is now selling by the skipload. So shouldn't the game be the same runaway success? Ocean has a chequered reputation with its film licenses but this time, they seem to have got it absolutely spot-on! MEG-A-SAUR-US DON'T TELL ME THE PLOT! Logos on tubular tunnels seem familiar... By the time you read this, everyone who's anyone will have already seen the film and, as the game leans heavily on the plot, you don't need to hear it all over again. With an all-new in-house programming team not only coming up with the goods gameplay-wise, but stopping off on the way to put together some of the best 3D graphics ever seen on a PC or even the Amiga 1200, it's that part of the game we're concentrating on here. Ocean's new boys over 20 of them have been working on the project since November of last year and in all that time, what's the result? A 3D world, populated by eight different types of dinosaur, all fairly intent on making your life a complete misery and rather short to boot With eight different types of sauropod stomping around the gameworld, you can bet that at some point you're going to get your ass kicked. Luckily there are several weapons that are scattered around to help you not only shorten the odds a little but also carve yourself up some Dinoburgers! You start off with a very limp-looking electro prod called a Tazer â€” which takes time to charge up but has the benefit of being able to stun dinosaurs through walls. There's also a rifle to grab early on, but once you get into one of the 3D sections, you're rewarded with a meaty-looking shotgun. There are also pick-ups scattered around the levels too. A first aid kit will replenish your health, the toolbox contains a crowbar which you need to accomplish various tasks, and security boxes and shotgun shells are available, too. Heads up! This is too close for comfort. Your trusty shotgun is you your only hope. 112 "


"SOUNDS GOOD In As with the film, in-game sound has had a lot of time spent on it. Tunes and FX play throughout, with the music not only being atmospheric, but also changing as the gameplay unfolds the pace actually alters if you are getting a bit too close to having your legs ripped off. And once a dinosaur attacks, the music takes on a murderous tone that would scare Norman Bates out of the bathroom and make him leave skid marks on the towels! Death is just a bite away with Mr Rex. Background details on the PC are extraordinarily good on faster machines. The movie-like intro scene flies you around Jurassic Park to classic effect. Head-to-head with the Amiga dino! JURASSIC THE PICTURE STORY Jurassic Park the film has some of the best computer animation scenes ever seen and the game follows suit. TWIST IN THE TALE The 3D levels of Jurassic Park were always going to be a tough job, so Ocean enlisted the services of professional animator, Craig Whittle. Apart from being very artistic and rambling on about the dynamic equilibrium between the work of the preRaphaelites and today's postmodern realists, he's actually quite down-to-earth something he no doubt picked up when he worked for Cosgrove-Hall on such postRenaissance projects as Count Duckula and Danger Mouse, with his name soon to appearing on TV screens once more when Hell's Penguin is released this autumn. mers all moaned at him to use less frames but Craig stuck to his guns like Danger Mouse on the trail of Baron Silas Greenback. And we're glad he did the finished animations are excellent; and it's all thanks to the pre-planning pencil sketches you can see at the foot of the page. SHOCKING STUFF! The 3D levels that lie between the eight different paddocks really show just what the programmers and artists have achieved. On both PC and Amiga versions you can swish around accurate sets that depict locations from the film. The viewing room and the inside of the labs are accurately rendered. There's even the dinosaur mural which you can look at from the gallery. On the PC, if you're not content with just side to side movement, you can even look up and down and at the moment) change the height that you're viewing from so it's even possible to get a worm's eye view of the world! SCANNERS Craig's work shocked the graphic The line drawings were scanned artists and computer animators at into a PC where they were scaled Ocean. When asked to draw anito the right size, then anti-aliased mated sequences for a Raptor (a process that smoothes out any being shot, turning and running as harsh lines) and finally coloured in viewed from the front and D Paint. Sounds easy, eh? Not behind, he turned out over 50 quite it took four artists a whole frames of animation, with 17 month just to get them just right! whole frames taken up just for the Then they were all programmed shooting! Normally, programmers into the games, on PC, Amiga would have done the a similar job 1200 and even the A500; talk in about 20 frames, so Craig's about a monster of a job! really gone to town. The programAnd here they are in all their glory! The 17 frames of 'death whilst running'animation showing the level of detail that Ocean's new programming and animation team have put into the game's main stars. RELATA PELITA 113 "
