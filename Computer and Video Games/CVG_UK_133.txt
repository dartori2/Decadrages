This is the place to find out why! 10 NEWS Oooh, you'll never believe all the fab and groovy stuff that's been happening during the past month.

Blast the hoods and drive about very fast in this conversion of the hit Taito coin-op! 78 PITFIGHTER It's the PITS! One of the worst conversions you're ever likely to see staggers its way onto the Master System. It's sad, bad and not at all rad and we tell you why in the full CVG Review! 86 LEMMINGS When they're not hurling themselves from high cliff-tops they're being converted to every home format under the sun! They're the Lemmings and they're appearing on a Master System near you! EDITOR TIM \"NOT NOW\" BOONE What really winds me up is nosey neighbours, people who faff and fart around and every single thing about Challenge Anneka. Also, I hate it when people insist that just because you're leaving you have to tell everyone your middle name when nobody ever got it right and now there are TEN free games up for grabs to the first person who does... DEPUTY EDITOR PAUL \"NOT SAD\" RAND What really gets me is people who throw away your collection of used ketchup bottles after you've spent ages building it up. I had seven empty Heinz bottles and one day my sad Irish flatmate just threw them away. Did he think to ask me? Oh no. He just chucked them out and now they're gone. ART EDITOR JON \"NOT AVAILABLE\" BILLINGTON I can't stand it when you've got two Fourth Floor flatmates and one never washes up and the other never washes his feet. Also, I hate finding hairs in the plughole because I always think they're mine and I'm turning into a sad slaphead and if it gets any worse I might actually BE Paul Daniels. STAFF WRITER STEVE \"NOT FAIR\" KEEN I hate it when drunks fall asleep on your shoulder and people click their knuckles and think it's hard and come up to you in the street and talk to you as if they've known you for years. People I really can't stand do all three at the same time... STAFF WRITER PAUL «NOT NICK\" ANGLIN What really winds me up is playing Paul Rand at Streetfighter 2 because he takes it much too seriously and threatens to sack me every time he loses. What's worse, whenever anyone comes up to watch us play he goes into a sulk and sends me down the shop so no-one will witness his complete sadness. DESIGNER JENNY \"NOT AMUSED\" ABROOK What really winds me up is people who wear their watches the wrong way round, especially if they set their alarms to go off on the train and can't be bothered to turn them off. Another thing I can't stand is people who mash their dinner up and then say they don't want to eat it... MANAGING EDITOR JULIAN \"NOT SLOW» RIGNALL Gatso speed cameras really get my goat because they won't listen to any of your excuses, however hard you shout at them. Also, I can't stand people who hog the centre lane and drive with their fog lamps on. People like that ought to be kneecapped, and then something really horrible should happen to them...

Quite frankly, our jaws have never been quite so utterly dropped as they were when we first saw this, and you'd be sad indeed to miss it. So pack up your R2 unit and scuttle on over to the top secret viewing of what could be the best flying blast EVER! LAST MINUTE COMPO: CVG has a new Publisher, but can you guess his weight? Is it: a) Not inconsiderable, b) Quite a lot actually, or c) Bloody enoooormous!

"WORD-UPIN PSSST! Want to know a secret? This is going to be my last issue as Editor of CVG (gasp!) and after 18 months putting up with this lot, who can blame me? Yup, after a year and a half in the CVG hotseat yours truly is moving up two floors and into the even older Editor's chair on EMAP's rather brilliant Nintendo Magazine System. Hurrah! As I write this a CVG successor has not been chosen, but fear not I'm leaving you in the more than capable hands of Rand and the crew, who will doubtless continue to do, er, whatever they've been doing so well all this time to keep CVG the World's Greatest All-Formats Games Mag. And there's more! CVG also has a new Publisher Garry Williams. Now publishers are by nature quite shy individuals who like to stay out of the limelight, do their accounts and be nice to everyone. Luckily for us, The Wodge does not fall into this category and rest assured that the new man at the top has already proved himself a top roistering CVG Boyo! It's been a hoot and a half over the past 18 months, 78 weeks, 547 days, 32,820 minutes, 1,969,200 seconds we've all been putting CVG together and watched it soar while other mags came and went, all asking the same simple question: How DO we do it? Well, we're still not telling so sit back, enjoy all the goodies crammed inside this incredible issue (what about that Mega Games booklet fab, eh?) and then fill out the Word Up! competition form you'll find at the bottom of this page. Right, that's it. Boone's Away. BYEEEEEE! TIM BOONE WIN!  FREE GAMES FOR YOUR MACHINE! IT'S THE GREAT WORD UP! GIVEAWAY! COR BLIMEY!

Cor blimey, what a spawny so-and-so! I wish I was you, but seeing as I'm not (and I want to win that WonderMega) here are a few of my suggestions for the mag!

"NEWS THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK ega and Nintendo might rule the roost in the gamesplaying world, but Commodore have shown that they mean business this Christmas, with the launch of a brand new member of the Amiga family! Dubbed the Amiga 1200, it's a home version of Commodore's incredibly impressive and recently released 32-bit monster, the Amiga 4000 and, at a price of only , this could well be the computer to put the keyboard boys back in business. STEVE KEEN'S yer man to tell all... IT'S GOT THE POWER Computer giants Commodore have jus launched their latest piece of techno-wi ardry, the awesome Amiga 1200, at a sta spangled press extravaganza. Every big nob in the computer world piled into th secret back rooms at Commodore HQ t see the incredible beast unveiled for th first time. The new computer is stuffed wit the kind of high-tech features that woul make a nuclear physicist go weak at th knees. The new A1200 is twice as fast a the current Amiga, with 2MB of 32-bit RAM which can be expanded up to 4MB and i their first venture into the massive 32-bi range. IN : AT: UUTTO COLOUR ME GOOD! BAP OKTAT Although you'll see some incredible game appearing on it soon, Commodore hav spent a whopping .5 million on TV an press ads making sure that punters realis that the A1200 is more than just a game machine. It can handle 256,000 colour on screen at the same time from a palle of 16.8 million roughly 16.76 millio more than the Super Nintendo! And with 32-bit processor running at twice the speed of the old Amiga, backed up by a array of new custom chips, the 1200 makes a lot of PC's look like crumbly ol Spectrums! You'd think that with this sor Would-be-buyers will be pleased to know that software for the machine is already pouring in, with super-souped versions of Zool, of spec, you'd have to sell your granny': Lethal Weapon and other such titles getting ready to fill up the shelves by Christmas. Every product seems to have the kind of bonds to afford one; but at a paltry  mouth-watering graphics only ever seen in the arcades, making the A1200 the first of this new breed of machines to give the cononly a hundred quid more than the bog soles a real run for their money in the games department. However, the bad news is that old software for use with the A500, standard 600 you can bet that thi A500+ and A600 machines will only be about 60 percent compatible, meaning that if you were to upgrade from your existing mighty machine is going to be at the top o machine the chances are that only half your software will work. Boo-Hiss! a lot of prezzie lists! SAD BUT TRUE HOT NEWS FOR HEROES! After the mammoth success that was Hero Quest, gamesplayers everywhere have been screaming for a sequel. Hero's Quest II The Legacy Of Sorasil on the Amiga and ST. Well, rest your aching throats and scream no more, Hero Quest llis on its way! It's called The Legacy of Sorasil and, as you have doubtless already noticed, the graphics have been given a huge kick up the cat flap. The plot, as is the norm with RPGs. is thicker than Mrs Miggins Aberdeen Porridge and it's guaranteed to take you months to complete. The main quest is made up of ten smaller scenarios and every character found has a specific task and purpose no hangers-on here! Sounds like a right treat for one and all, and of course CVG will bring you more news as it comes. D800 OK GVG 012 "

Oh, and remember to mark on your entry whether you want to win the trainers or the cart! ANOTHER ANOTHER WORLD! Following hard on the heels of Out Of This World, reviewed this issue and recipient of a fine and dandy CVG HIT!, comes Flashback, the stunning sequel to the equally impressive original. Research scientist Conrad Hart makes an astounding discovery late one night. Working in his laboratory, the egg-head discovers that certain well-todo members of the community are not what they seem and are in fact aliens from another galaxy! Before he can break the story to the world the extra-terrestrials get to Conrad and imprison him in a high security hospital on the planet Titan to erase his memory. However, Hart escapes and, while makign a dash for freedom in a handy spaceship, is shot down in a swamp-like jungle region in the middle of nowhere. Lost and dazed, the man with no memory must find an identity and his way home. Flashback utilises the same incredible graphics system of its predecessor, with fully animated cinematic effects and five sprawling levels of adventure. Each frame of animation has been created by video-taping real actors, turning them into graphics to achieve some incredibly life-like scenes. Conrad can walk, run, jump, climb and perform scores of other tasks such as throw objects and hang from ledges. Zooms, animated close-ups and flashback sequences are just a few of the effects incorporated into the game and some extra stunning surprises await those who take up the challenge. So what formats is this winner-in-waiting appearing on? Expect to see Flashback on Amiga and PC first and expect to see a mega Exclusive lowdown on the almost-complete Megadrive game, which we've seen and can tell you it's incredible in the VERY near future!

"HVG W PREVIEW SUPER SUPER NINTENDO SHOOT EM UP BY ARENA .00 old onto your underpants and I don't bother to mop up the puddles still covering your boots after last month's bowel-breaking look at X-Wing, because this time we've got a scoop to make Super Nintendo owners really mess their keks! JVC, with the assistance of Lucasfilm themselves, are putting the nuts and bolts into their SNES version of George Lucas' epic space, extravaganza, calling it Super Star Wars and if you read on and try and study the screenshots instead of falling off your seat as you first clap eyes on them, we'll tell you all about it! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING Super Star Wars is JVC's first foray into the world of the Super Nintendo, and This game is huge 8 whole megabytes to be exact and is full to bursting with some of swankiest graphics and audios the Super Nintendo has ever put on show. By stretching the machine's Mode 7 capabilities to the limit, the programmers have produced some of the most astounding scrolling visuals we've ever seen. One stage sees Luke and C-3PO cruising through the desert in a Land Speeder, towards the Jawas' Sand Cruiser at such a rate you'll swear that the wind is actually flowing through your hair! The programmers have made full use of artistic license. You won't recognise some of the monsters because they were never actual ly seen in the film and only mentioned by name! So the curious creatures Luke, blasts in his back yard are Womp Rats! 4832 085235BD GETS JABODO 1223 BEAST JSD "


"PREVIEW RS THAT'S NO MOON Special effects aren't just reserved for the movies; Super Star Wars has more than its quota of huge, animated mon sters, high-speed scaling coupled with 360 degree rotations in the comba sequences, as well as accurate depths of field on parallax scrolling, creating the effect of a real 3D world for you to react in and space flight simulations to make Captain Kirk drop his load! THAT WAS ONE IN A MILLION I'M ON THE LEADER With all the stunning visuals shoved onto the Super Star Wars cart, it would be easy to let the sonics slip but no! The original Star Wars tune has been recreated almost note-for-note, instrument-for-instrument, which plays away as a backdrop to the intro story and logo which scroll off into the distance, exactly like the beginning of the film! In fact, the game is flooded with movie-like sound scores and the actual sound effects are digitised straight from the film! Smart effects such as the blaster fire, explosions, TIE Fighters, Light Sabre sweep and even Chewie's growl have been squeezed in so as to make the game as close to a movie experience as possible. So as to keep you in touch with proceedings during the game, each level is linked by stunning animations that act as updates to the action and tell you what's going on. They also serve to link all the different tasks of each level to further the feel of you taking part in a real film. Sounds good so far? We've seen a 99% finished version of the game and we can tell you that you ain't seen nothing yet we haven't even mentioned all the monsters, pick-ups and weapons available! We'll be bringing you the full Review of this could be classic in a CVG near you very soon until then, may the Force Be With You! IT AINT UKE DUSTING CROPS, KID Super Star Wars gives you the opportunity to take on the roles of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker or the 'walking carpet' Chewbacca in your quest and enter into tons of different game styles spread over fourteen gigantic levels. Cross the desert on foot, toasting Womp-Rats with your blaster: pick on Jawas as you race across the sand in a speeder: navigate through the trash compactor to disable the Death Star's tractor beam; and take on the elite TIE Fighters in a space battle to end all Super Nintendo space battles. The whole film's there to be played out in full the only thing stopping you is the limitation of your skills!

"GW PREVIEW STAR PC+IBM(C) BATTLE SIM BY LUCAS ARTS & JVC RIKEY_Just-when-you-thought that your trousers had reached maximum capacity and couldn't expand any more, along comes XWing to stick a hat-pin in the seams and spread the contents all over your mum's living room floor! Last month we gave you an exclusive Hotshots insight into the way the graphics are coming along and now we bring you the latest update with a secretly filmed video of the game in motion, smuggled out of Lucasfilm laboratories through a blanket of security men so thick you could stand a needle up in them! FAB FILM FROLICS Awesome is the only way to describe the footage as the titles and prologue scroll into the background just like in the film and a huge Imperial Battle Cruiser slides into view amidst a wave of laser fire and spiralling fighters. Huge balls of fire rip into the darkness as lumps of Tie Fighter career through space as the rebels claim another victim. It's unbelievable, just like watching a bit of the film that accidentally landed on the cutting room floor! You can choose to be the hot-dog pilot of one of four Rebel Fighters the s-wing, A-Wing, Y Wing and of course the X-Wing. Each one has it's own battle advantages and disadvantages and it's up to you to pick the best bird for the mission at hand. MANIC MUSIC MAYHEM And just to confirm that this will be the most sought after game the PC has ever seen Lucasarts have included full screen cinematic action sequences and their incredible IMUSE sound system that allows the pitch and type of music played to change at a moments notice to suit the nature of the action on screen! Although the game is able to carry music 100 percent of the time during play, sampled sound effects and speech have also been crammed in so you can hear the roar of the Tie Fighters screaming overhead and even Darth Vader's mechanical breathing system! If ever there was a time for your Dad to get a PC, THIS IS IT! "


"PREVIEW ling Level 1/8 WARS LASER LAFFS AHOY The best way of describing the game is a Star Wars sim. You can enter into all of the films most memorable star battles and a host of others. Try your hand at negotiating the 'Maze' in the pilot proving ground, join the rebel fleet and act with an entire squadron of fighters on three tours of duty, act alone on hit and run raids on Imperial cargo ships or fighters or get in on the film's most exciting battle, the attack run on the monstrous Death Star. There are over 50 amazing deep space and Death Star surface missions and everything can be captured on video replay to play back again and again in fabulous 3D from 17 different view points. PROBLEM CORNER Capture/Recovery of INCOM Engineers IMPERIAL SHATILES In the true tradition of Lucas Film, pre-production of the mammoth game included hundreds of drawings all painstakingly hand-drawn for the graphic artists to work from. The spectacular artwork took months to put together, but is nothing compared to the original film's story-boards which had to made from scratch and often required single elements, such as a Storm Trooper's outfit, to be drawn hundreds of times until it reached perfection! One of the hardest parts about preparing a game such as X-Wing is the incredibly complex mathematics that have to work out in a split second what the action will look like from any one of the 17 different camera angles that must be accessible instantaneously!

"HUF CVE REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM PLATFORM BY SEGA $27.99 Vou get some funny animals down under. Australia has their kangaroos, New Zealand's got their kiwis, and Tasmania has the Tasmanian Devil. This mad little feller has been immortalised in cartoon form and now he's come to the Sega! This whirling dervish of a creature spirals around the world, chewing through anything in its path and generally behaving rather badly. During one of his more peaceful moments, Taz hears from his dad about a Lost Valley containing hundreds of rare and undiscovered animals, one of which is a massive sea bird which lays huge eggs. So, probably because he's got bored of munching through his own neighbourhood, the little devil heads out to find the hidden valley and sharpen his fangs on pastures new... TECHNICOLOUR DREAM The first thing you'll notice are the spunky, colourful cartoon-like graphics. However, you won't be able to tell how how great the animation is 'til you see the game in the flesh. Little pink mice carrying spears roam the jungles with snakes, fireball spitting fly traps all laid down onto Tex Avery esque backdrops. Taz loses energy fast, but fortunately there are platters of roast chicken everywhere which our boy scoffs down whilst licking his lips and rubbing his tummy, as you do. Taz Mania looks great on the Master System and it's just the kind of game the machine needs to lift it out of the doldrums. The pick-ups are in huge supply and the gameplay moves along at a right old speed. Unfortunately the whole thing comes a cropper by being much too easy. There seems to be a plate of chicken to top up energy after every nasty, and none of the platform baddies provide any real challenge as all you have to do is run into them and shove them off the screen with the typhoon. That being said, it's great fun especially for fans of the cartoon who will be glued to the game for hours. Hardened Master Systems veterans, though, will complete it fairly quickly, but it's brilliant fun while it lasts! STEVE KEEN I'LL EAT THAT FOR A DOLLAR! 03 Guzzling is what Taz is best at. He just can't help himself, which can be a bit of a problem as the levels are carpeted with bombs positioned at strategic places around the platforms. If Taz lands anywhere near one he doesn't stop to think, but gulps it down and then realises that it's too late and it explodes in his stomach, nicking some energy and becoming a bit of a bummer. cvG 024 "


"REVIEW GVG ANIA WACKY WHIRLWIND WONDERS There's no way you can compare the Megadrive version with the Master System, but what made Megadrive Taz such a hit were the graphics and the fact that there were piles of sprites, places to explore and things to do. The Master System has the looks, but without the depth it stands out as a good old romp which could have been a monster. Don't get the wrong impression the game is fab fun and the caverns, jungles and other levels are a great laugh, but in the end the whole world seems a little empty. Give me small sprites, a ton of quirky monsters to splat and a heap of addictive gameplay and I'll take that every time. There's no substitute for substance and Taz Mania proves that. If you haven't seen the cartoon, you won't know just how nippy the Tasmanian Devil is. The real creature, which lives in...wait for it...Tasmania, is not nearly so colourful a character. In fact, it's a rather sad little creature which doesn't do a whole lot, but thankfully Sega's creation can either amble around the screen slowly or screech across the platforms in a spiralling whirlwind, smashing everything which stands in its way! This effect makes the devil immune to attack, but only lasts a few seconds as Taz has to catch his breath and wait for the power bar to top up again. IS IT A BIRD? IS IT A PLANE? PAUL ANGLIN Taz Mania's speed is not the only similarity with Sonic The Hedgehog. There are also masses of spring-loaded platforms which send you flying skyward to discover previously unreachable platforms in the clouds and treetops. These are great for helping Taz sniff out an extra lives or more plates of nosh to throw down his neck! Don't get tempted to spring off in unknown directions though, as you'll tumble down pits or get impaled on unsociable spikes. Ouch! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE CVG % 89 % 79 % 78 % 70 BIG BOYS DON'T CRY Although energy boosts are plentiful and pick-ups such as invincible stars are around every corner, they won't help you with the end of level boyos! In Taz Mania these are a very mixed bunch, with the first being a rather tame bull and moving on to a young lad with a bow and arrow to a boomerang throwing croc! The only weapon Taz is armed with is his whirlwind, so you'll have to suss out a good attack and retreat plan to beat the big boys before getting in too close. CVG câG 025 "


"CVE REVIEW OUT OF THIS SUPER NINTENDO PLATFORM BY INTERPLAY .00 verything was going well for CLester Knight Chaykin he'd just bought himself a top Ferrari F40 and his reverse particle acceleration project was almost complete. After hours of painstaking lab work, his calculations added up; the particle accelerator was ready for its first major test. Lester hooked everything up and, despite the rather severe storm that was brewing up outside, he began the experiment. Lester leaned back in his chair, opening a can of cola to ease the tension. But the trouble with lightning bolts is they always end up where you don't want them to go; this particular one shot straight down the wire to the particle accelerator. The next thing Lester knew, he was immersed in thousands of gallons of water along with his machine. This was not his lab this was Out Of This World. TOP GUN ANTICS As well as being able to kill people with your gun, you can also create a shield with it. Keep your finger pressed down on the fire button until a little blue ball of energy appears, then release the button and a wall of energy will appear although not indestructible, this will protect you for a while. Also, if you keep your finger on the fire button for ages until a big blue ball of energy appears, you will be able to blast away stuff like doors and other peoples shields. A very useful piece of kit and it impresses the ladies, too. SCREEN SCENES I was one of many to be absolutely blown away by the Another World on the Amiga, and I'm happy to report that the Super Nintendo version is even better! Amazing is not the word the game has such a cinematic look to it you'd swear someone had forgot to plug the Super Nintendo lead in and you were still watching your favourite sci-fi show. The sound too is on a par with something straight from the recording studio. Mind you, we've seen plenty of games with fab graphics and zero playability. Out Of This World, thankfully, is not one of these. Things start off tough and get difficult almost to the point of frustration, but the game's so good you just keep coming back for more. What more can I say? Nothing simply that this is an incredible game that should be right at the front of your cart collection! PAUL ANGLIN As well as an astounding intro, Out Of This world also provides a host of superb animated cut-scenes during the game to delight and amaze. Take, for example, the first level wrongly time your jumps over the strange, crawling animals on the floor and the scene switches to a fullscreen view of the creature extending a venomous sting which it strikes your leg with, ripping your trousers. Later on, you'll come frighteningly face to face with a hideous, razor-jawed monster; meet for the first time, through glazed eyes, your new-found alien companion; be gobbled up by a savage pit creature; all these and more serve to create the nearest thing yet to an interactive movie on consoles.

"HVIEW HVA OVER LAD U SNES\" fabled WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR? When Another World hit the streets I was quite simply astounded by its playability and unbelievable graphical effects. All 10this has come to the Super Nintendo in Out Of This World, an incredi* ble adventure using polygons in such a way that they rival even the SNES' fabled Mode 7 in the Wow! stakes. From the incredible intro to the plethora of cut-scenes to the game itself, it all just comes together so brilliantly, combining to form possibly the first 'interactive movie', certainly in cartridge form. Out Of This World isn't a massive game, but it certainly isn't easy. There are so many different twists and turns and tasks to accomplish lots of them pretty way out, such as having to blast a light fitting so that it falls down onto an enemy a storey below you in order to pass through that screen later on in the quest that you'll be at it for an age. Mark my words Interplay are going to make a lot of dosh out of this one and, quite frankly, they deserve to. PAUL RAND Complete the first level and you'll wake up in a cage with a hideous-looking creature. Don't worry he's friendly. After you've escaped, your alien buddy assists your progress throughout the game; quite handy, considering he's knows the ins and outs of this strange world. There's just one problem he hasn't got any weapons (Lester finds a gun early on in the quest) so its entirely up to you to protect him. It's vitally important that you do, for he's essential to your eventual escape from this world. But don't worry too much if the pair of you become separated along the way; complete the required tasks and you'll eventually get back together. ANOTHER WORLD, ANOTHER FORMAT As games gurus like us will know, Out Of This World started life on the Amiga under the title of Another World. This version, while no different in terms of gameplay and presentation, runs at a faster frame rate than its floppy based forefather and, because the Super Nintendo joypad has a plethora of fire buttons, removes much of the fiddly control that slightly hampered the game on home computer format. And there's more if you think this is something special, just wait until you see the sequel! Flashback is its name and in gameplay terms its even better than this! Unfortunately, it's only available on computer formats at present but watch this space for some top console-related information! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE MOVIES GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE CVG % 96 % 91 % 94 % 04 The sound of jaws dropping will literally be heard for miles around when you clap eyes on the stunning intro for Out Of This World. Created entirely using polygons, this ultra-long cinematic sequence depicts the events leading up to Lester's little accident. See our hero pull up outside the lab in is Ferrari and take a stroll through the dark corridors to his lab, where the scene switches to the experiment and its untimely conclusion. The effect is absolutely incredible; you could honestly believe that you were watching a movie and that's no chin-spinner. HIT CVG 027 "

If travelling at 270mph isn't fast enough for the speed freaks amongst you then, with the use of one of your precious three turbos, you can boost your mileage to an obscene 380mph for about five seconds. These can be very helpful in terms of making up lost ground, but beware the car tends to wobble a little at speeds approaching 400mph! BY SEGA .99 There are high speed chases and there are outrageously high speed chases and SCI is, well, a bit swift! Basically you're a top boy in a well-nippy murter, racing around the streets of America in search of villains who have managed to escape the clutches of the authorities. However the baddies, rich from all their crooked goingson, can afford some pretty speedy automobiles so, leaving aside their sad Fiat Pandas, the local rozzers have climbed into a top-of-therange speed machine in the hope of catching them. Mind you, psychopathic killers are none-toopleased at the prospect of going behind bars, so don't harbour any thoughts of gently persuading them to pull over. DEATH ON WHEELS The baddies you need to nick are very naughty crims. These boys aren't wanted for parking on double yellows robbery and murder are their game. The more dangerous the hood, the faster their cars go as you progress through the game; they're not bad drivers either, so make sure they don't knock you off the road! 90 HT DOHOGE WATCH UUT EUR LOIDSL IDE ? demanda STAGE COMPLETED BONUS TIME 88X I 0888 TURBO 8x30880 SCORE 1384828 CATCH THE COIN-OP DECISIONS DECISIONS I did enjoy the Master System version of Chase HQ, but it's looking quite dated these days. Now here's the sequel and, while SCI does manage to generally improve on the Chase formula it still leaves a lot to be desired. Graphically it can't be called stunning; everything jerks along and the roadside is very sparse the road itself is quite smooth though. I found it rather offputting, being able to drive straight through cars, but apart from that gameplay is fair enough, although it does get samey. SCI isn't what you'd call a great game, but hey, it's not terrible and you get to shoot hell out of baddies! PAUL RAND GRAPHICS % As regular arcade goers will know, SCI is the sequel to Taito's hugely successful coin-op Chase HQ. The original had basically the same plot chase a villain through the streets and apprehend him by crashing into his car. The sequel wasn't nearly as successful due to the fact that, apart from the addition of guns, the game was exactly the same. If you liked the first game, you may be interested to learn that it's been available on Master System for some time but it's a bit old and sad these days. WEAPON OF WONDERMENT In order to get rid of the bad guys quickly, you're given a number of different weapons to dispatch them with. You start off with a rather poor pistol but, thanks to that great police helicopter that flies overhead, you can receive some top hardware ranging from rocket launchers to machine guns. The problem is that you only get a certain amount of shots five to be precise. Use them wisely. CVG STRATEGY SKILL 62 SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 65 % % 61 ACTION REFLEXES CVG CVG "

"GE 3 PAGE REVIEW CVG TH 06 MEGADRIVE DEZA QUOQD) DDDDDD LAT BY EGA World of lllusion S T A R R I N G he life of a magician can't be easy. I mean, having to make people believe that you are really making things disappear and that you're not just spinning their chin. Mind you, Mickey and Donald have got bigger problems. It all started when Donald discovered a strange box during a rehearsal for the big magic show. Donald turned to Mickey and in his duck-like manner said to the mouse \"Hey look at this. Let's have a go.\" With a slightly higher tone Mickey replied «Gee I don't know Don, it could be...\" and before he could finish the curtain had closed and Donald had disappeared! Mickey ran over and was drawn in to the box by some kind of magical force and whisked off to the World of Illusion as laughter filled his (rather large) ears.. wir MICKEVA DONALD DOUBLE THE FUN Remember Fantasia? Most of us would prefer to forget it. Thankfully, we're more than assisted to do just that, thanks to Sega and their perfect pairing of Mickey and Donald in World Of Illusion! The superlative sprites and backdrops of the previous Disney licenses are back in abundance in fact, they're even better, containing some brilliant animation sequences such as those of Mickey pulling Donald through tight places 'cos he's too fat! Sound is fairly weak, but the overall package just reeks of quality. This is a massive title, consisting of not one but two games. Not the most difficult cart ever to grace a Megadrive, but without doubt one of the classiest hurrah for Mickey and Donald! Mickey and Donald has been very much geared around the idea of some real two-player action, and all the levels feature little changes depending which mode you play in! Not only that, Mickey and Donald will take a different route through the game depending which you choose. Some of the other two player laffs include Mickey having to pull Donald through gaps 'cos he's too fat to get through himself and a rail car where Mickey and Donald have to jump alternately to get the thing to move! A Q10 D 220201 CVG 032 PAUL RAND "


"WRICS 05 VAN DODO = = GUG HUE KEY NOTES One of the more interesting features of level 2 is the huge piano in the sky. There are a few bonus points in there if you hit the right keys, but get it wrong and you'll produce a bomb! There's no real gain in this but it's a good laugh to run up and down the keys and create some well weird tunes. 03 SUPER SMASHING LOVELY As you may have gathered from the intro magic spells play quite a large part in Mickey and Donald. Whenever you kill an end-level baddie you'll be given a new magic spell which you will need to do the next level. These vary from a magic carpet to a bubble which lets you breathe underwater, and even a giant bottle cork. But undoubtedly the best thing about the magic spells is hearing Mickey mutter those magical words \"Alakazam\" in his usual high pitched manner. If you're playing in two player mode Donald gets the honours and you can hear just what a British Rail train announcer sounds like. D 0202020 Sega needed something pretty drastic to rescue the reputation of their Disney games 'cos Fantasia pretty much wrecked it beyond belief. But by thunder me trousers they've been and gone and done it! World Of Illusion starring Mickey and Donald retains the graphic look of Fantasia, but manages to, steer clear of that game's tawdry gameplay, excelling itself in the playability department. The inclusion of both Mickey and Donald isn't just a gimmick it actually adds something to the gameplay, with different levels depending on which character you play. The three different mode are Mickey and Donald, Mickey or Donald. There's also a real emphasis put on the two player aspect. There are loads of little bits which will require team work to navigate, all of which is designed give the game longer lasting appeal. And it works because there's a real compulsion to see the differences between every type of game. There are a wealth of very good platform games on the Megadrive, not least the first 16-bit Mickey Mouse spectacular and, although this doesn't quite manage to steal Castle of Illusion's crown it does run a very close second and is well worth getting. Recommended. PAUL ANGLIN  MICKEY YOU'RE SO FINE Mickey Mouse has become quite a fixture on the Megadrive. He first appeared in Mickey Mouse Castle Of Illusion just over a year ago and the game was hailed one of the best Megadrive platfomers ever. Then Fantasia attempted to recreate this genius about six months later, but the game featured lots of horrible gameplay quirks and niggles. Since then the Sega world has been waiting for more top-class mouse malarkey and here it is! A 0000000 Doods TRIES 06 AVOMIMO D 22000 A VQQ CLOT D 2200mm TRIES DROP IT One of the main two player features is the use of the rope, with which Mickey or Donald can hoist each other up to higher parts of the level. To perform this amazingly simple task you simply stand above the player at the bottom of the screen and hold down button A. The climb will be automatic. There are a ton of different places to use it so you'd better get the hang of it quick, or you'll stay sad forever! CVG 033 "

"CVG SUPER NINTENDO SPIN THAT WHEEL RACING BYNINTENDO .99 Rest assured that the spirit of Mario is alive and kicking, even if the game is very different. There are still tons of pickups available in Mario Kart, gathered by driving over the question marked boxes which appear just after the starting line. When you drive over them the box in the top right hand corner flashes with all the different icons and you have to stop it by pressing the A button. Here's the full list of what's available: ario's back! And best of all, he's brought all his old pals with him! But forget jumping japery and secret room malarkey, because everyone's taken time off from their usual platform antics for a day at the races! That's right, Mario and pals have put aside their differences to work on their handling of hairpin bends, with four different courses to race and five tracks on each course. If that's not enough, there's even a head-tohead battle mode for those starved of some Bowser killing fun and frivolity. So stop messing about, grab your kart and RACE! Coins: allow your kart to take hits. If you have no coins and are hit you'll spin off the track, but collect ten of them and you'll speed up a tad! Mushrooms: give a handy short burst of speed, best used just before the finish line. Green Shell: allows you to propel a shell forwards in the hope of hitting someone. Best used when an opponent is right in front. JU1' 33321 Red Shell: much better than the green, this little baby is virtually a guided missile and almost bound to hit the car in front. Hurrah! FINAL: LAP Star: invincibility. When you have it, crash into as many people as you can! He might have a large nose and wear dungarees, but Mario is the hottest property around and now he's taken a break from platform romps to star in his very own racing thrash! Super Mario Kart is the name and the game borrows lots of features from the Mario Bros series and shoves them into a variety of racetracks riding over question-marked blocks gives you various bonus items pick up coins, grab stars to become invincible and even receive Koopa Shells to hurl at your opponents. And what opponents! All your favourite Nintendo characters appear, from Princess Daisy to Donkey Kong Jr, all burning up the tracks as they try to outdo each other for the points. One player mode is a treat right enough, but grab a friend and play split-screen racing or go for the one-on-one death duel track and Super Mario Kart really comes into its own! Graphics are gorgeous Mode 7 really kicks some ass as it creates the brilliant array of tracks, and all the characters are instantly recognisable. This isn't just racing it's Super Mario Bros on four wheels get it before your friends laugh at you for being a sad, non-Mario Kart owning man. Feather: super high jumping laughs ahoy! Great for jumping enemy shells and even finding short cuts on some levels! Banana Skin: drop one of these and if it catches anyone out they'll spin off the track. Best used when there's someone directly behind you. Lightning: the best of the lot. Using this will shrink all you enemies down to thumbnail size AND you can run them all over! 100' 56°45 00\"56°45 CVG 036 CVG 036 PAUL RAND "


"THE WHACKY RACERS ICK RACERS REVIEW GUCE HA B100° 46'89 MARIO: Mr Dungarees himself doesn't find much time to race, so most of his talents are fairly average. Perfect for the beginner, but you'll find it hard to progress far with him. Special Power: Invincibility Stars. 100° 46\"87 LUIGI: The rather more neglected of the two brothers isn't too great either and his skills aren't really any different to that of Mario's. Special Power: Invincibility Stars. TOAD: He may have a mushroom on his head, but Toad can sure mix it with the best. His speed and road handling are up there with the best of them, but his road gripping is a bit poor to say the least. Special Power: Shrinking Mushrooms. The distinct lack of high-powered racing cars made a lot of people a little wary of this, but what a mistake! Mario Kart is the absolute biz! In true Mario style the massive depth of gameplay far outweighs the brilliant (not to mention speedy) Mode Seven-orientated graphics and superb sound. At first play this seems no more than your average racer, but it's not until you get into it that you realise quite how much there is. For one thing, mastering all the eight characters will take ages. Then there's the inclusion of the coins. At first it seems as though they've just been put in to support the licence when in fact they're a crucial part of the game. Learning where to use certain power ups will also occupy many a late night, and trying to complete the special cup in 150cc will take ages! The one player mode doesn't provide an unending amount of fun and frolics, but get a few mates and you can form a Mario Kart league in no time at all. Overall, another superb Mario outing. Can this guy do anything wrong? PAUL ANGLIN 100' 51\" 317 : Due to his distinct lack of size, Koopa is the fastest on the track. Handling's good too, but his road grip is really rather poor. Special Power: Shells. JOOP 5260 BOWSER: The biggest and baddest of the lot, but that's not really good news. Bowser's size slows him up horribly, but the extra weight does provide some brilliant road handling. Special Power: Bowser Bombs. 9.6 00° 5258 000 515 396 01\" 2318 04 | DONKEY KONG JR: Baboon boy's weight means he sticks to the floor like glue but it doesn't do much for his speed.

"GUA REVIEW HORSES FOR COURSES Not surprisingly the three different courses vary hugely in the difficulty stakes. The first is the Mushroom Cup, which is a good laugh but won't provide much challenge for long. Next up comes The Flower Cup, with some really dodgy tracks to negotiate. Then it's on to the outrageously hard Star Cup, which will have you tearing your hair out. If you can manage to grab a gold medal in all leagues then you will be able to race the Special Track the ultimate in Mario-related driving experiences. But that's not all come first in all races you'll be able to race 150cc machines. 100° 29\"94 101° 1969 **7 ST 30 1 What an incredible laugh this cart is! Basically Mario and pals have taken time off from their usual antics for a day at the antics and turned in one of the most compulsive racing games I've ever seen! There's a real competitive element as you race hell for leather round the twisting tracks, desperately trying to knock out your pal using every trick in the book! Everything in the game looks very Marioish, complete with mushrooms, coins and all the usual tomfoolery. But that's where the similarity ends because this game is wicked! With loads of tracks and eight different characters to select (all of whom handle completely differently) you won't be bored with this in a hurry! This is one of those games where hours fly by like minutes and on no account have the cartridge anywhere in the house when you've got something important to do because it just won't get done! BSS SA TIM BOONE ING IT OUT The second type of game in Mario Kart is the Battle Mode, which puts you and a friend head to head in a battle to the death! Both players Karts are surrounded by three balloons, and to burst these you must hit your opponent with one of the weapons that can be found in the bonus boxes laying around the track. But make sure you don't pick up anything crap. I mean, how are you going to dispose of Bowser with nothing but a mushroom? It's just not done!

Firstly all the stupid gets who write to you and say how their consoles are excellent and everyone else's are crap! Well I haven't got a console at all and I think they're all brilliant! Secondly people in this country are being completely ripped off by the console manufacturers. I live in Hong Kong and over there you can buy Game Gears for  and an SNES for around  and neither of them are made there. If they sell so many in Europe why don't they have factories over here which would allow them to cut their prices by at least 30 per cent. But oh no! The reason they don't have them over here is because they make a packet from the dozy Brits who are willing to pay mega high prices for their stuff. They should keep prices universal all over the world so that we don't have to pay higher prices than the Yanks or Japs. ED HOWSON, NFA YOB: You unbearably sad man.

"THE GUIDE TO THE STREETS LO ADVANCED STRES TM STRATEGY MANUAL PART 2 Your wait is over! Part two of CVG's incredible streetfighter Guide is right in your hands, just waiting to share all the secrets of the streetfighter pros so that you too can kick the crap out of everyone stupid enough to get in your way! We're now halfway through this most awesome advanced guide to the greatest console game yet seen, and this issue we take Chun Li, E Honda and Vega apart with strategy tips to end them all! There's never been anything quite like it before, so read on and enjoy the FULL lowdown on the game everyone's going barmy about! CVG 05 "


"Chung Li is the only woman in the bloodthirsty Street Fighter Tournament. We use the term 'woman' lightly as this flower of the Orient is barely old enough to be out of school. However, she has broken away from the system in search of a mafia crime boss who is rumoured to have killed her father. The mysterious criminal is none other than M Bison, who has entered the fighting arena to quench his insatiable thirst for blood. Chun Li has inflicted years of hard, backbreaking training on her body to hone it in the deadly ways of Wushu, one of the deadliest martial arts.

"KILLER COMBINATIONS WITH TDI RATINGS (Total Damage Inflicted) 1. Swoop in with a flying kick forwards and just skim the top of the opponent's head to land on the other side, then hit them with a full force double handed power punch whilst standing. POIZOO 2. Stand your ground and deliver a good volley of Hundred Foot Kicks and when the opponent is stunned, backwards jump over their next desperate attack and land a flying kick. TDI:50% 3. Duck down low for one of Chun Li's incredible double foot power driving kicks and, when the opponent is on their back, quickly get up and move slightly closer for another one. Finish with a totally unexpected flying kick for maximum effect.. TDI:64% 4. Nip in for a super fast ground shoulder throw then stand upright for a double handed power punch. A somersaulting kick forwards over their heads will work wonders. TDI:55% 5. Killer Attack: when your victim is positioned two thirds of the way across the screen drive him back with a flying kick and then a full force double handed punch. He should now be well and truly blocked into the corner in a perfect position for you to wind up the Hundred Foot Kicks for total devastation. TDI:70% WINNING TACTICS DHALSIM: Chun Li makes mincemeat of Dhalsim, and it couldn't be easier. Whenever old rubber legs attacks with Yoda Flame or Fire he's totally open to attack for a couple of seconds. Just keep jumping about the place kicking and punching and he'll be reduced to a sack of broken bones! KENRYU: The Karate boys are Dragon Punch junkies, so stay well away and time your punches to hit them where they land. They are also very vulnerable directly after a Fire Ball attack so keep at one end of the screen and wait for one to come along and jump towards them with a flying kick. Get in for very close attacks they hate it! GUILE: As ever Guile is the boy to beat. It doesn't matter how many times you hit him he never seems to get stunned. Attack him from very high in the air with somersaults, kicks and especially throws BLANKA: The green monster is surprisingly at his most vulnerable when attacking in the air, where you should always come off best if you time your attacks right. Get a good start with an easy throw at the beginning and remember he recovers very quickly. E HONDA: Eddie uses his Hundred Hand Slap with alarming regularity, so always time your jumps to fly over it, even when it's not in evidence. Aim for his head and never land directly in front of him. Use Chun Li's toe tap on the big boy's bonce, somersault kicks and full power punches to flatten him ZANGIER You shouldn't even break a nail when fighting this bozo! He's so slow and Chun Li's so fast he'll be flat on his back before he's had time to pack a change of leotards. Assume a standing position and just jump straight up lashing out with your leg every time he comes close. "

"Honda has been trained in the art of Sumo wrestling from birth. Just like a prize bull he has been worked, trained and fed with the sole purpose of obtaining the title 'Yokozuna' (Grand Champion), something that he achieved by the time he was 21. After single-handedly wiping out the rest of his country's wrestlers year after year he has entered into the Street Fighter tournament to prove the worth and superiority of the Japanese giants and their fighting skills.

"KILLER COMBINATIONS WITH TDI RATINGS (Total Damage Inflicted) 1. Stomp in with a flying foot kick and follow up with a massive crush. TDI:55% 2. Another flying kick attack sets the victim up perfectly for a standing chop, full power naturally, and then finished off with a crippling foot sweep. TDI:53% 3. Use Honda's forward jumping swat bouncing up and down as you cross the screen towards your adversary. Carried out correctly you can get three or more hits in with good timing. Kick out or punch as you retreat from a hostile attack and sucker the opponent into a Hundred Hand Slap as you reach the edge of the screen. TDI:54% 5. Killer Attack: a quick crush delivered from Honda's mighty arms followed by two successive chops will set your enemies up for drastic damage loss. TDI:75% INNING TAGTIG IZANGIEF: These two really pack the screen. Zangief is very slow but has an incredibly long reach that can catch you unawares at inopportune moments. However he's as predictable as Chun Li and will jump/walk into Hundred Hand Slaps no bother. Smack him about a bit and then jump in with a kick and a throw. BLANKA: The two are very similar in their methods of attack. Blanka is thwarted by the Hundred Hand Slap, he can't get in close and can't use his electricity or Spinning Ball attack as it'll stop him in his tracks. The only thing he can do is jump up and kick you. This can be stopped if you see it coming in time by jumping up and getting a slap or kick in first. DHALSIM: One of the only characters Dhalsim can trouble is Edward Honda. Blubberbutt is as KEN/RYU: A good combination of chops, sweeps and Hundred Handers slow as the sinewed Indian in the should sort these guys out. On level 7 they're incredibly hard to get in the air, so the best tactic to use is to crush, so don't even bother. Instead, throw them to the ground with the blue stand your ground and let him come button and follow through. to you then swat him from the air with a chop and couch down with GUILE: Once you've begun to kicks for ground attacks. Defend all attack don't give Guile the chance to the time as Dhalsim tries to rub use any Sonic Booms. Honda has a berise you with blows. surprisingly long reach with his kicks and Guile likes to get down low for his attacks so a swift combination of low and high attacks coupled with some throws will send him reeling. It's best to avoid using the Hundred Hander as it takes too long CHUN LI: Chun Li may be one of to warm up. Jump over Sonic attacks the most useful characters to fight and attack with the blue button. with, but as an opponent she's as predictable as the inevitable arrival of Christmas. The wench attacks you with alarming regularity by jumping into the air and trying to land a kick. By simply waiting for this and jumping on the spot you'll rob her of 80% of her damage with a kick before she knows what year it is! "


"Vega's garb of metal face plate, armoured arm and steel claws make him look like he's just stepped out of a gore fest horror movie. The former matador has given up his bullfighting days in order to take on more challenging prey humans. He's incredibly agile and leaps about all over the arena in a blink of an eye, making him extremely hard to hit. However, his vanity is often his downfall as he likes to hang back and show off rather than getting stuck in and finishing the job in one go. The secret to taming him is to anticipate his every move and make an attack before he does! BEATING VEGA BLANKA: Vega gives a hard GUILE: Very tricky, but it can be time to everyone who takes him on, done. When he jumps towards you, especially Blanka. Electricity is use try and gauge where he's going to less and you'll soon realise that land and upper-cut. Jump towards you're really up against it. You can him with a series of flying kicks and lob him one by hopping around and with good timing you'll get in at least hitting him with medium punch. four hits before he can react. Retreat When retreating jump backwards backwards spinning and jumping and kick and you might be lucky and and then repeat the process. score a hit! ZANGIER You can forget DHALSIM: With Vega's about beating Vega on any of the incredible speed in the air this is a higher levels Zangief's just too case of the turtle and the hare! Stay crap! However, try standing still and on the ground and slide boy! Slide! grabbing him for some pile driving Cover long distances with rubber antics. Pixel perfect timing is the arms, but remember they are just as only way to succeed and it's guarvulnerable as your body to attack, anteed to take you days before you can beat him. KENRYU: When the Spaniard is about to spring off the wall, go to the far edge of the screen and somersault backward and kick followed by a close upper-cut and retreat fast! When not In this mode of fighting stay away or it's curtains for you. CHUN LI: Protect yourself from attack with the Hundred Foot Kick, especially when the boy drops in on you from above. Chun Li is quite well, matched to Vega as they are both fast in the air. Although she can dodge his attacks it's quite hard to land a hit. Punching will get you nowhere, even shoulder throws and aerial throws only come off by fluke. Stick to kicking and remember to keep on the move! BLANKA: Vega gives a hard ime to everyone who takes him on, especially Blanka. Electricity is useess, but you can lob him one by hopping around and hitting him with medium punch.

"CHEAT MADE WELCOME one and all to another slice of the greatest games hints and tips section in the known cosmos, courtesy of the cheekest little tyke in the western world. That's right, PAUL ANGLIN has finally pulled off his long-standing CVG coup and taken over Cheat Mode! And that's just the start of the changes you're going to see to Britain's brightest cheats section. With loads of goodies going on and even more planned for the future, you're going to be sideswiped by the superbness of these very pages soon!

There's a staggering ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS worth of games for the best of the lot so get to it sharpish! GOLDEN AXE II STEEL EMPIRE Galsgow reckons he's done it. To enter the secret level, go to level three and grab yourself a pair of Icarus Wings and fly to an island in the bottom left hand corner of the map. Fall down the hole in the middle and Paradise awaits you. Hurrah! Trish hero Bob Mooney has managed to deliver this top tip all the way from the Emerald Isle, so the least we can do is print his top tippery: When the Sega logo appears keep your fingers on A and START. You will now be on stage two! This hack and slash fest may be exactly the same as the original, but that hasn't stop Jim Lendall of Watford finding a top cheat. To get bonus magic when you reach a boss monster, follow the following: hold down the A button and fight the battle. After you beat the boss release the A button when you enter the bonus stage. Don't attack any of the wizards and when the next level begins you'll have full magic! More Bob Mooney malarkey, this time, on the so-so Jacko game. To start on any level except six hold UP, LEFT and A then press START on controller one. When the words stage one come up use the pad to pick a stage.

"JERRY BOY JERRY 50880 Jeremy may be a rather strange blue blob, but Darren Wymer from Mill proves he's more than a match with this tasty tip! For a level select screen when the game says Push Start, try this instead: push UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, SELECT and START. Good, eh? ARA PAUSE UNDER CONSTLUCTION SUPER NINTENDO MAGIC SWORD One of the more, erm, varied games on the SNES is subjected to Mark Eustace from Slough, Berkshire and the result is this: to get an extra option screen both controllers must be plugged in. Go to the option screen with controller one and highlight Exit but do not press anything. On the second control pad press and hold L, R and START. With all of these held, press START on controller one. Now you'll be taken to a new option screen where you can select your vitality and game level! The rather excellent Leon Woodley from Sydney sends greetings from Australia and this fine tiplet to boot. For an unlimited amount of continues select a two player game and play as the red car. When the race ends you'll be third and the blue car now has unlimited continues! than to bash out some cheats on Rival Turf and that's just what Alex Heffer has done here, so over to him: there is a secret warp which takes you to the end of level four. To use this you must have thirty or more defeated enemies represented by small heads which appear above your energy bar. When you get to the part of the fourth level where there is a door, press UP at the first door to go into it. If you don't have thirty or more enemies shown at the top of the screen when you get here the cheat will not work, so make sure you do. RIVAL TURF What better way to waste away your hours at Hodcerill Boarding School ................................. .... ASTERIX Dickie Carter from Clitheroe, Lancashire, has found a great cheat for this game starring the rock-hard gaul. On level 3-3 whilst you're on the moving platform, you'll see three gold coins. Get them. Now instead of jumping back onto the platform, jump up so Asterix is off the screen. Walk right, pick up the bags, go through the door and bash the pot for bonuses galore! MASTER SYSTEM XENON 2 John Lim Eng Hooi wins this month's Flip Me Where's That Then? Award for the furthest distance travelled by any tip this one comes all the way from Selangor, Malaysia!

PRINCE OF PERSIA Crikey! Young Johnny doesn't hang about, does he? Not one but two mentions in the greatest tips section of them all!

"TWO BEE Oh what a great cheat this one is! Coincidentally, it was found by yours truly. Who says I play games all day?

DEVIL CRASH JACKIE CHAN Peter Hartigan has manages to grab two Cheat Mode-related celebrations thanks to this little number: to see the end sequence simply type DAVIDWHITE as the entry code.

"ACTRA ere it is! The second and final part of the complete CVG Actraiser guide, put together by none other than sword wielding CVG half-pint Paul Anglin. So without further ado, and more jokes at the expense of his rather sad double earrings, let's invite the lad to take it away! ACT II Firstly, if you haven't got the crescent shot thing you're well and truly stuffed, but you'd have to be a bit of a sad man to miss it anyway. When you get to the Serpent's lair, jump across to the third platform and stay there. You can only be hit by the monster's head his tail will not harm you. One of, if not the easiest guardian in the entire game. MARAHNA SUPER NINTEDO ACT 1 One of the most complex guardians in the game. He's hiding at the far right of the screen, so walk straight over there. On your way the monster will fire a jellyfish-type thing. Kill this straight away, as the longer you leave it the harder it will get. You will notice that there are two pads in the middle of the stream; these are very useful for killing the jellyfish. You will also see that, sticking out of the main part of the monster, there is a beak this is what you have to hit. The other thing to avoid is the tentacle which will cause you endless problems. Stand just in front of the beak and jump and hit it. When the tentacle gets to you, walk to the far right of the screen, wait until it stops and then jump and attack. The key thing is to do this slowly. AITOS CREATION As soon as you arrive in Marahana, cause an earthquake. This will join the small island at the top of the screen to the main one. You must do this before you start building because an earthquake will destroy any buildings that have been put up by your people. Then begin to destroy all of the palm trees so that your people will have enough room to build. This Catherine Wheel look-a-like requires precision and skill to defeat. This guy bounces around the screen so much that it's impossible to find a working strategy for him. The first thing to do is, as soon as you start, jump onto the platform that you're directly underneath and hack away. You'll be able to get in about five or six hits before he moves. When he does, just stand your ground and he will roll into you keep hitting your fire button and you'll hit him. He will then drop onto the floor, roll to the other side and come back over to you. Simply repeat the process until he dies. This will take a bit of your energy down but it's very effective. ACT II This Voodoo child is pretty easy, provided you don't get too close. The way to do it is to edge toward him until you see the spikes come out of the base. This means that he's going to drop down on you, so move back a little and, when he drops down, you should be able to get a few hits in but be quick. His energy bolt is dead easy to jump and you'd have to be a bit of a sad man to get hit by it. If he throws a platform down at you, get out of the way and jump onto it let it take you up so you can get a few hits in. NORTHWAL CREATION There's only one thing that you have to pick up on Aitos and that's the sheep's fleece. Make certain that you pick this up, because it is essential when you get to Northwall. Firstly, clear all the rocks around the shrine to reveal the skull-head lairs. Ensure these are the first lairs that you seal as they are by far the most dangerous. When the people get unhappy about the lack of wind, just send the great wind and they'll be over the moon once again. ACTI This flying terror doesn't have a strict attack pattern as such, which makes life somewhat difficult. When he flies overhead he will drop rocks and although they don't harm you, it's the water they splash that you must watch for. Avoid the GVG 070 "


"JSERS COMPLETE GUDE PART 2 splashes and, just before he drops a rock, he becomes immobilised so hit him quickly. When he swoops down there's no way to stop him from hitting you just hack away and you'll hit him more times than he hits you. DEATH HEIM CREATION When your people moan that they're cold, use the sheep's fleece that you picked up in Aitos to warm them up. Hang around for as long as you can on the Northwall creation, because you'll need to get your level up nice and high to get through Death Heim. ACT NI Big Bird is the last guardian before you reach Death Heim. To defeat him, run to the left of the platform and wait until he stops, then get behind him and use your jumping attack while he's firing rocks at you. As he swoops down use your magic on him. When he's moving around the screen there's no way to stop him hitting you, so just swing your sword in his direction. First thing you'll notice is that you don't have to fight every end of level guardian just one from each area. You must have three lives when you reach Death Heim, otherwise you'll not be able to complete the game. The final guardian comes in two parts the first is the head of doom. Dodge the shooting stars, making sure you're not positioned too close to the enemy (you'll be able to see it above your head). When he fires if you're positioned right you should be right in the middle of the two shots, which won't come into contact with you. Fire off as many shots as you can before he FARA ASE comes again and repeat the process. The second enemy is a large yet surprisingly easy-to-beat dragon. When he fires twin shots at you, position yourself in the middle of them. This will take some practice before you find the right spot. When he fires coloured stars (he'll fire them four at a time) shoot them as soon as possible, otherwise they'll catch up with you and cause all sorts of problems. You can only hit him when his brain is exposed, but it's possible to get about three or four hits in before it goes back in.

Now I know that no one's scores are higher than CUG's readers, but who's going to know about them if you don't tell me So get 'em down on paper and send them in to: OFFICIAL UK HIGH SCORES, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE.

"000000 TIN AVA CVE REVIEW 000 BUZZ EXE CRATING MASTER SYSTEM BEAT EM UP BY SEGA .99 The organisers of the Pitfighter tour nament are a thoughtful bunch to save you from having to continuously use your fists and feet to beat the other guy, they've placed weapons on various levels to help you get the job done quicker. Grab knives. shurikens and even big wooden crates to hurl at your enemies, then punch them in the face while they're unconscious on the floor to whittle down their energy! PITFK It's a sorry old world, but you just I can't help but come across folk beating seven shades out of each other these days. Three of the hardest lads around have gathered together with some of the meanest battlers in the city for a scrap which makes Streetfighting look like a walk in the park! These boys and girls settle their differences in ultra-violent, underground tournaments for cash and glory. You become one of these fighters in Pitfighter, the Master System version of the top-rated Atari coin-op. One or two players go up against the creme de la creme of the town's fighting stock for vast sums of money, not to mention the accolade of victory over the big bad baddy The Ultimate Warrior! Very poor.) We've seen conversions of Pitfighter on Megadrive, Super Nintendo and Amiga, and only the Amiga version has come anywhere near the standard of the excellent arcade original. We weren't really expecting the Master System incarnation to fare much better than the other console versions but never in a million years did we expect it to be this bad! I'm frankly appalled that Sega have the nerve to put this trash out on the streets, never mind charge money for it everything about this game smells of something particularly unpleasant. Graphics are nothing short of a joke: tiny little figures with animation that looks as though it's been ripped out of a fourpage flick book. Sound fares little better effects are paltry and music offensive to the ear. And as for gameplay Sega have obviously forgotten that they're supposed to put some in. Pitfighter? Swap the P for Sh and you're somewhere nearer the truth. ONE OR TWO? IT'S UP TO YOU There are a trio of Pitfighters to choose from at the start of the game Buzz is a muscle-bound hardman who uses his brute strength to defeat his opponents. whilst Kato and Ty are trained in martial arts and rely on skills to overcome any foe. Choose one play er mode and you go up against one baddy at a time, but plug in a second joypad and two fighters can take on an equal number of enemies beat 'em both to move to the next stage. BEARING A GRUDGE After every few fights, a grudge match is called to sort out the men from the boys. If you're playing in one player mode, you effectively take on yourself, while when playing with a friend you get to kick him in. The object of this is to knock down your opponent three times achieve this before he does and watch that brutality bonus soar. GVG 078 PAUL ANGLIN "


"REVIEW CVE AVA --CHTER Oh dear oh dear. Just when you thought Master System games had started to get so much better, along comes a cartridge catastrophe so completely crap it almost defies belief. To call this shambling sad effort a game is an insult to decent software everywhere, and this pathetic excuse for entertainment must rank one of the most dire abrasions on the backside of the console world. There's absolutely nothing to recommend about the game, except that you can always turn it off. In fact, don't ever bother turning it on. The shambling graphics are so poor that one of those game and watches could do better, sound is so bad you'd rather play in silence and as for gameplay, well, there isn't any! Somebody obviously decided that since the game had done so well on Megadrive they'd shove it out on Master System and watch it soar to the top of the charts. Well, not while I've got anything to do with it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETE CRAP. Simple as that. TIM BOONE WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 19 % 11 % CVG SAD SCRAPS This is a big tournament, so it stands to reason that there are going to be lots of opponents for the pitfighting boys to smack. Some are sad, but on later levels they get more difficult to beat. That's the theory. In this conversion, all of the characters are a doddle to kick in and anyway, you'll feel so nauseous upon powering up the cart that you'll probably switch off half way through the first battle!

"ReVIEW SUPER NINTENDO ART PROGRAME By NINTENDO .00 e's everyone's favourite Italian plumber and he's a bit of a boy as well! Not only can Mario do away with Bowser and race little Karts really fast, he can paint as well! Yessiree Bob, the Brooklyn boyo is destined to follow in the footsteps of the greats Picasso, Da Vinci, Renoir and Billington! Now you can take part in some painting antics of your own on your Super Nintendo with Mario Paint, Nintendo's answer to Sega's rather tawdry Art Alive. This has to be the strangest Mario licence to date, but can the moustachioed megastar do it yet again? Let's take a look! ooooo0o00ooooo Review design by Jon Billington and Mario Paint. Copyright Computer and Video Games, 1992. No rights reserved. DESODEOD THE FLICKS OBNO DOBILI DOMON BOBO ODIE DI 33 DROB BOB Even the most incredible piccy can get a bit dull but just think what it would be like if you could give your art a bit of life. In Mario Paint you can! The special animation feature allows you to put up to six frames of movement into your creations and they are surprisingly good. It's best to keep the movement simple because with only half a dozen frames, you can't do anything particularly spectacular but we've had stick men doing some very odd things indeed! HO OBDOMIL DUONDON 13303 RESIN SUPER NES DAMN FLIES MOUSE Nintendo had their work cut out for them with this. They could have just turned in a reasonable effort and it would have still stood head and shoulders above Sega's rather poor Art Alive in every department, but instead they've turned in a brilliant little art package that would excite even the saddest of artists amongst you. As simple an idea as it seems, the inclusion of the mouse and mat is the main reason why the package is so user friendly and, although it may put the price of Mario Paint up a little, it's a real boon to budding Super Nintendo Salvadors. Many Mario trademarks crop up in Mario Paint and the subgame is the best example very simple but a real good laugh. The music mode is a real treat, giving you the opportunity to make your picture stand out, and the animation option literally brings your art to life. Tons of fun! Even Picasso took time out from painting pretty pictures and, in Mario Paint, so can you! There's a separate little game in there to keep you amused, in the form of a fly-swatting bonanza. You control said insect repellant and you've got to kill all the flies and other nasties which swarm onto your screen. Boring and sad it may sound, but it's actually a good laugh, providing a bit of a breather while you're waiting for some divine inspiration to create your next Old Master. SQUEAK SQUEAK Unlike the tragedy which was Art Alive, Mario Paint comes with a mouse to help you create your piccies rather than relying on the morethan-inadequate artistic capabilities of a joypad. Most of you will have used a mouse before, and you'll know that it's a comfortable piece of equipment to work with and the word is that it will be used in certain other games as well, the first of which is probably going to be King Arthur's Quest! INNANZONI PAUL ANGLIN "


"BEVIE W BUG 1000000000000000* Right, let's face it this is the sort of cartridge your parents are going to buy you for Christmas because you're a bit crap at drawing and they think it'll do some good. Well actually they'd be right, but luckily Mario Paint is also an excellent laugh! Mario's all over the place to help you along, and some of the effects you can create on your SNES are superb. Initially I found it quite difficult to get into, but Mario Paint grows on you and the better you become the more you want to learn. Sound is very jolly and graphics, well, as good as you can make them! The addition of the bonus game is icing on the cake really, and you'll need it when you're trying to work out what to draw next. Mario Paint is one of those carts you don't think will ever come out of its box, and before you know it you're using it all the time! One of the best \"edutainment\" packages around. TIM BOONE PD HIT THE RIGHT NOTES PAINT BY NUMBERS 15 o If you get tired of drawing, or wish to spice up your masterpiece with a few, er, sonics, why not take advantage of Mario Paint's incredible music feature? There are around twenty different sound effects to use, and once they've all been placed on the scoresheet you can change the tempo, put your tune on a loop and save your faves. And who plays the music for you? Mario, of course! Added to that, there are three pre-set tunes which you can jive to. These include a variation of the Mario theme and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Thankfully there's no mention of Tetris by Doctor Spin, for this alone would have wiped 20 per cent off the score... If your drawings aren't particularly good then you can always opt to colour in some that Mario and pals have already created for you. There are four different drawings a pic of Yoshi and his pet plumber, an underwater paradise of mermaids, fish and other such aquatic life, a sketch of a top birthday present and a nice educational picture with lots of different animals accompanied by their names. The fun thing is that you can change the pics a little, so you can have all manner of strange yet colourful incidents bursting out of your screen!

"GG REVIEW HVA MEGADRIVE 3-D STRATEGY 1718156 17196 IDEMENTIAL BY VIRGIN .99 RECEP echnology has allowed mankind to achieve many wonderful things space travel, satellites, wall tellies and, er, a genetically engineered killing machine. Universal Cybernetics Corporation were actually designing a domestic robot to do all the jobs you and I hate so much. But something went horribly wrong, or did it? Now there's speculation about the original purpose of the machine due to the ease with which it eliminates people. So the government has sent you, CyberCop, deep into UCC Headquarters to see what exactly is going on and pinch the mutant robot for a closer look. GET YOUR KIT HERE BOYS WILL BE BOYS Your agent may be a real tough guy, but you can't expect There are a total of six different pre-generated characters him to stuff everyone with his bare hands. Once you've to choose from in Cybercop two men, two women and selected your character you are given the choice of what two cyborgs. All have their own extensive list of statistics, equipment to start with, and won't even be offered stuff with attributes ranging from manual dexterity to skills you can't afford or carry. The list of equipment is endwith an Elastoplast. The more standard characters are less, everything from the obligatory weaponry to a rather better for learning the game, but once you've worked out obscure power lead. All are essential, but only on certain the way it all works you'll be able to build up a specialist missions. We'll leave you to work out which! with your own modifications. DON'T I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE? DamaGE EQUIPMENT POWER If CyberCop looks a little familiar, you'd be right. The game originally appeared on the Amiga and ST about two years ago under the name of Corporation. It was a huge success and now looks set to do the same on the Megadrive. Many people thought the game could not translate because of the constrol method, but it works well on Megadrive and there's very little difference between the console and computer versions. L2E2AXEZO I have to admit I'm not usually a fan of this type of game there's usually too much work involved and not enough death and destruction. It has to be said, however, that this is a damned good example of a 3D strategy blast fest. Provided you've read the manual and persevere with the control method, it won't be long before you're hooked. There's no way you're going to get through this one in a couple of weeks, and some of the levels will have you tearing your hair out. Graphics look very good and sound is pretty limited but provides some smart little effects. The main worry was how the control method would stand up on a joypad. Designers Core have solved the problem with a nifty control method and this is a well decent cart if you prefer games which require some thought.

"GVE REVIE BVB SRL MASTER SYSTEM PUZZLE BY SEGA TB COT emmings are small, cute, rodent-type creatures with an irresistible urge to throw themselves off tall objects or dispose of themselves in some equally gruesome way. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to use each Lemming's particular skill to save the numskulls and guide them safely through the 100-odd assault course-styled levels and safely to the exit. It's nowhere near as easy as it sounds! \"ORRIBLE OBSTACLES You'll never get through all the levels first time, and on some you have to rescue 100% of the rodents to move on. But don't worry, you get as many chances as you like and there's a full password system to let you turn off and come back at a later date. The wealth and variety of the obstacles and graphical backgrounds will amaze you and you won't be able to put the game down! What a brilliant conversion of a classic game! The key to success is to use the limited amount of skills from the bank on offer at the beginning of each stage. You are only given a few of each of the different \"workers' and with these you have to plan which ones are needed in each particular field and while that might not sound too daunting, it gets a little hectic when you're given the bare minimum of goodies to use. Forward planning is vital as more often than not you'll find your self in a jam with none of the Lemmings needed for the job at hand. It's cliche now, but it really is the most addictive game you've ever come across and more fun than a day trip to Disney Land. Regardless of what system it's on Lemmings is such a great concept it just can't fail, and on the Master System it's fab! LOADS OF LEMMINGS INSTON 2011 O NE. 4. 2 MIELI LIST TRICKS AND TRAPS There are eight Lemmings to choose from diggers, builders, tunnellers, blockers, floaters, exploders, climbers and pickax wielders, but you can make any single Lemming a super dude by giving him more than one skill. They enter the course by a trap door at the top of the screen and drop down towards the ground at a variable rate. The best thing to do is slow them right down until you've got a safe path constructed and then let the followers flood out! It's not just bottomless pits and precarious ledges that the little blighters have to be led over. Later stages include tiny traps such as guillotines, hangmen's nooses and exploding pressure pads! The animation on the tiny sprites is brilliant, and although they only stand a few pixels high they ooze more charm and character than Bob Monkhouse on Full STEVE KEEN CVG STRATEGY SKILL % GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 92 % 04 GVG 086 ACTION REFLEXES HIT "

"GIE REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO STRATEGY BY KEMCO .00 15 13 BUCUS 03 L 0000001 0 1 LES BODAS DOO Chat? A Super Nintendo game that doesn't put you in the cockpit of the galaxy's niftiest battlecruiser? You don't need any of that, because this is the world of Ka-Blooey, where the action really is explosively charged. Become Spud, whose sole task in life is to toddle around, blowing up bombs. Big bombs, small bombs, some as big as yer \"ead he's got to get rid of them all without blowing himself up. Not the best existence in the world even worse when you discover that, when a bomb is exploded, it takes with it a chunk of the playfield. Help m'boab! DETONATION'S WHAT YOU NEED Bombs come in all shapes and sizes in Ka-Blooey, and it's in figuring out which order to blow them up in that makes the game so bloody difficult. Each different bomb destroys a certain number of tiles which go to make up the playing area the smallest device removes the least tiles, while the biggest one wipes out a large expanse of the screen. Not only that, but if other bombs are in the radius of an explosion, it too will go boom, taking yet more tiles with it. The trick is; where to stand and which to detonate without being either blown to bits or left with nothing to stand on? BLOB-A-JOB I wasn't too excited by the prospect of a rather dull-looking strategy game featuring a blue Mr Potato Head blowing things up, but I have to admit this is actually very good! Ka-Blooey's graphics, although simplistic, are nice and large and the 3D works well. There are some reasonable tunes in there, complimented by lots of pleasing spot effects. But the real winner is KaBlooey's high addiction level. The game get ridiculously difficult on later levels and, by the time you get to level twenty, you'll be tearing your hair out and there's still one hundred and ten more to go! A cart that deserves to be ranked up there with classics like Lemmings and Tetris! As if things weren't difficult enough, you've also got a few bad guys to get rid of. Take, for example, the marauding gang of yellow blobs which shuffle around the tiled play screen in a set pattern they're rather sad and can be easily avoided. Not such a pushover is the rampaging red blob which bounces around the screen in a random pattern to get a fair impression of its actions, try getting a look at Rand at around nine 'o' clock on a Friday night! TILES AND TRIBULATIONS There are an absolute mass of different tiles to step on and fall off of in kaBlooey, from the standard tile which will blow up in an explosion, to those which allow you to transport bombs around. There are indestructible tiles, icy tiles which will have you slipping all over the place, as well as tiles with special powers such as teleports that transport you to other parts of the level, switches which will produce new blocks and even a spinner that hurls you off in a random direction! 265000 UREL WU10 UUR VUNUS 06 UROS DE DAS DUUUUUUU STRATEGY SKILL CVG PAUL ANGLIN GRAPHICS % 78 SOUND % 80 GAMEPLAY % 89 VALUE O9) CVG 088 ACTION REFLEXES HIT "

"EVE REVIEW MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BYSEGA .99 BATMAN Now get a grip! The movie BatIman 2 was given so much hype that even the Turtles turned blue with envy! And lets be honest, if it wasn't for the pulling power of Catwoman in her bin bag, the film would have been in trouble. The plot was thinner than Paul Daniels' hair and the action about as dramatic as a Roger Moore acting lesson! However, the film made huge amounts of green backs and Sega are hoping that our generosity in paying out to see such a pile of trash will extend to splashing out for a copy of the game as well. Make no mistake Batman 2 The Return is as close a film license as you can get, so expect to see all your own favourites and a few more besides. A MOST Lawks! Batman's a EXCELLENT far cry from the grey (GAME...2 tight-clad Adam West NOTI of my day. He's looks like he's thrown away his Man From C&A catalogue and now does all his window shopping in GQ and Esquire! The thing about this game is that it's so tame. Mis Batman's got a ton of fab weapons, but there just aren't enough badies to use them on. The sprites are huge especially the end of level villains, but most of the levels only have a couple of goon types to kill and the platforms are very bland. This would be forgivable if the game-play and controls weren't such a chore. The character just doesn't do what you want when you want him to and when you're jumping precariously from roof top to window ledge the last thing you want is to perform a double salco on the joy pad to get you safely across! All the potential for a great game is there, but instead of packing the action in the dweebs have made a grey day in Dartford look like a weekend in Vegas with this. Nice sonics though. GVG 090 STEVE KEEN "


"LLLL REYTE THWACKI! Not everything's perfect in Batman 2 a couple of gripes are the grainy graphics and lack of detail. Some platforms are so badly defined that you'll walk right over them only to fall through the floor back to where you started. The first stage is set on the window sills and ledges of Gotham City's skyscrapers at night and if you can get through that without a single blunder you're a better bat than me matey!  Bruce Wayne's a bit of a stiff in real life, but once he slips into his designer rubbers he's as flexible as an Access credit card! He bounds all over the screen, jumping from platform to platform kicking and punching anything that gets in his way. If things get too far out of his reach a quick stab on the joypad and the winged wonder flys/swings through the air just like his Marvel bunk-mate Spiderman! I hate games that cheat. You know the type, when you clearly do one thing and the computer does another. Well this is just such a game. It's not that the control system is complicated it's just that it's fiddly. The platforms are positioned in such away that one small mistake at the wrong moment and you lose a life. In order to get across extra large pits you have to jump up and extend Batman's cape to glide over the hole using two separate buttons on the pad pressed quickly in succession. Naturally, once you're over the pit after the first press there's no t ing back and if your second stab is not spot on it's back to the beginning and diced bat for tea! Some of the effects are great, though the animation of Cat Woman and the subtly lighted street backdrops are brill. Also when Batman dies he pulls his cloak around him like a cocooned bat and disappears in a puff of smoke. It was all there for the making, but somewhere along the line the programming fell apart. Not bad, but it could have been a lot better. TIM BOONE STRATEGY SKILL ZOCK!!! Fans of the old Batman and Robin TV series will be more aware than most that the caped crusader carries a huge amount of gadgets in his 'Utility Belt. By pressing Start you can dive into this belt of tricks and pull out a crazy combination of paralysing bombs, homing Baterangs, standard forward flying Baterangs, horizontal grappling hooks and the incredible Bat Release which lets loose a swarm of little blood suckers that latch onto an enemy and rob them of their juices! WHAMID ACT 1 GOTHAM CITY Familiar faces rub shoulders with the more obscure villains. Gargoyles, jesters, machine gun totting clowns on unicycles, flame haired knife throwing women and baseball-wielding cronies bounce the Bat from scene to scene whilst the more infamous characters like the Penguin and Catwoman are reserved for the end of level battles. Catwoman tumbles onto the screen with her acrobatic flips and gives the masked crusader a good lashing, whilst the Penguin attacks from above on his helli-umbrella. ACTION REFLEXES SMASHT! GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 80 % 87 % 72 % 70 Batman is incredibly tough and if you don't collect plenty of pick-ups to refill your belt you won't see the night out. The options screen makes life easier with up to seven lives per game and a choice of control methods and there are unlimited continues, but you can still expect to be cracking your joypad on the side of the console in frustration after running dry of weapons and being left totally defenceless.

"GVE REVIEW PEE EEEEEEEE. MASTER SYSTEM BACK PASSSAGE PLATFORM BY SEGA .99 New Zealand Story's far from easy, but just to make it a little different you can run riot throughout the levels via tons of secret passages and teleportation holes. The holes aren't always there, they'll only appear if you kill the cretinous critters bombarding you with flack in a particular order. Be quick or be dead! HEADEDOOD AEEEEEEEE If there's one thing which really upsets New Zealanders it's being mistaken for Australians. If there's another, it's people not knowing what a kiwi is. Well, in case you're still in the dark, a kiwi is a sort of little yellow thing with wings and it's a really important bird because it can, well, run around and flap them a lot. The game features tons of little kiwis which have been kidnapped by a evil walrus and caged up all over the place. But help is at hand, because Tiki has managed to escape and now he's out to rescue his pals. NEW ZEALAND STORY 2626 New Zealand Story on the Master System really stands out as a champion laugh. The creatures are well weird and thanks to some great graphics and animation you can't wait to see what's lurking around the next corner. Gameplay proves a bit lame at times as you tend to get stuck on one particular section that robs you of all your lives and chucks you back to the beginning, but then again you wouldn't want to finish it first time round would you? Nicely presented and, for such a simple game, surprisingly addictive. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in fun. STEVE ARMED AND READY ANSWISATOHY DHUN MONSTERS AHOY! Quite how a fuzzy puffball of feathers is able to handle a thermo nuclear laser bazookoid is beyond me, but handle it he does and a whole host of other weapons and equipment to boot. The platforms are riddled with puzzles and quite often you'll come to a grinding halt with the solution to your problem in front of your nose. The Kiwi can pilot rockets as well as hovering trans portation pads that can be flown around the worlds. Chocks Away! All the worlds have different themes and the monsters change accordingly. Early levels are a cinch, with little birds sliding around the platforms easily dispatched with a single shot. Later on you'll have to cross arrows with flying bears, bomb throwing blobules and even smack haddock submersed under water with the walrus's terrifying aquatic agents. 000-er!

"ARCADE ight now there's a huge resurgence of interest in Star Wars memorabilia, games and stuff. So, what better time for Data East to launch a pintable based on one of the greatest films of all time? The movie's is now more than 15 years old, and pinball technology's come a very long way since then! Bloody good job too, because now they can start to do the movie justice and here's the first one to prove it! ACTION! A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY WARS DC BATA cVG 098 "


"Garante como FIRE JOIN THE SPACE RACE This new table is a space age feast for the eyeballs! Almost every character from the film can be found amongst the detailed art work on the play field and the incredibly colourful painted back glass, although a lot of the images are in fact from the other movies. There's also a big moulded plastic head, modelled on Darth Vader, on top of the cabinet with flashing eyes to attract players! Data East are an American company and as yet there are only two machines available in the country, and both of those are currently being shown to trade and press members only, but advanced orders are set to rocket through the roof and Star Wars has become the first pin-table to include the facility to take notes as well as coins into its belly. Naturally the game is crawling with sampled sound effects and speech, so expect to find the game calling to you with classic lines like \"May the Force be with you and Watch your back kid!' from the corner of an arcade near you very soon! Check out this table as soon as you can, and if you're a Star Wars fan play it NOW! DOWN WELL CONNECTED The ball enters the play field via a shaft at the side and a curious lever which looks like a gear stick with a button on the side. The stick actually raises and lowers the Death Star, which houses a hidden hole inside it just big enough for an eagle-eyed young Jeddi to shoot a ball into. The Star has to be raised for the shot to be a success and if you achieve the task the ball will get caught in the tractor beam and you'll be rewarded with an incredible amount of multi-ball antics, as silver spheres judder and ricochet all over the table at once! STEVE KEEN STAR WARS PINBALL by DATA EAST 30P PER PLAY STRATEGY SKILL BONUS BONANZA! The table is packed with features and bonuses. You can collect Jabba's bounty by smacking the ball into the right hand panel or send it on a rollercoaster ride by shooting it straight up the middle of a ramp placed at the top of the play-field. The more points you get the faster the R2-D2 model in the corner jumps up and down and the quicker he rotates his head. Keep on going and the his frenetic beeps and blips become louder and louder INSERT BILL AS SHOWN ACTION REFLEXES 15 2 PLATS BEST VALUE! $1.00 3 PLAYS 89 91 GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % % % % 89 87 DOUBLE THE FUN Most tables have LED graphical displays, but Star Wars goes one stage further and actually incorporates games with asteroids and a Tie Fighter shoot 'em up, with you controlling the laser targeting system of an X-Wing Fighter with the left and right flippers! All the usual bumpers, chutes and light combinations beef up the score, but it's no substitute for getting at those special effects. CVG CVG CVG 099 "

"GU HOTSHOTS A F-15 III NES Zip into your full combat flight suit, fire up the afterburners and rip into the skies with Microprose's latest release. F-15 Strike Eagle is a fully controllable 3D combat aircraft sim that'll have you pushing the G-forces through the roof! Microprose have long been known for their incredible state-of-the-art simulations on the Amiga and PC computers, and now they're all set to dive into the console market as well. F-15 has appeared on most home computers already, but the cartridge version will be the company's first venture onto the NES. One of the most popular fighter sims of all time gets the overhaul treatement soon with the latest in the F-15 series on the PC and from what we've seen of the game it's already looking a winner. Players can choose the targets they want to lock in on and perform all kinds of aerial stunts and manoeuvres whilst embarking on seven different missions. Amass points by destroying aggressors and proving your worth in the combat zone. The game will contain revolutionary polygon and bitmapped graphics and incredibly realistic dog fighting action! There will also be a two player mode allowing two players to fly side by side in the same mission! REX NEBULAR AMMO HOO AMMO OPC PC More PC madness comes in the form of Rex Nebular And The Cosmic Gender Bender! A futuristic adventure set on a distant fictional planet somewhere in our galaxy. Rex is a brass balled interstellar traveller and womaniser extraordinare, who crash lands on a planet entirely populated by bizarre alien women! Sounds like a dream come true, but Rex is no way near prepared for the adventures that await him. The game features stunning graphics, lip-synched digitised speech and tons of animation, puzzles and mysteries to solve. Check it out! HARRIER JUMP JET O AMIGA/PC Furthering their reputation as one of the greatest flight sim creators, Microprose release Harrier Jump Jet for the Amiga and PC. Again the game will feature detailed 3D effects, but this time the programmers have made use of Gouraud shading, a process that smooths out the rough edges of polygons to create incredible new shades and realism. You'll be able to fly over beautifully contoured landscapes, between mountains and through valleys as well as enter into combat in the game arenas of, Hong Kong, The Falklands and the fictitious Nord Kapp, dog-fighting with the best the enemy can offer. Sounds like a blast! 915 098 evG 104 "


"HOTSHOTS TU GLOBAL GLADIATORS MEGADRIVE cDonalds isn't the first company that springs to mind when it comes to the ecological state of the Earth although they have stopped using CFCs in their polystyrene burger boxes but hey, they're making an effort to promote the cause of the Greenies in conjunction with Virgin, in the form of Mick And Mack Global Gladiators. These two hip 'n' trendy kids have appeared in cartridge form before, in the Nintendo game McDonaldland, but now they've crossed the great divide and here they are, coming soon to a Megadrive near you! The object of the game is to take control of either Mick or Mack and systematically destroy the pollutants on each stage. Collecting the little McDonalds logos littered around the screens give the boys bonus points and, at the end of each three-stage level, there's a bonus game to tackle. The CVG boys have already had a good old blast on pre-production versions of the game and already we can tell you that this is a great title. Graphics, as you can see, are fab, with loads of excellent animation and some of the tunes are incredible! A surefire hit when it hits the streets early in the New Year, we'll be bringing you the full Review in a not-far-away issue of CVG! CVG 105 "


"HOTSHOTS STREETFIGHTER AMIGA O PCC64 SPECTRUMO AMIGA treetfighter Il is, quite rightly, causing a commotion all across the world and, with everyone literally foaming at the mouth at the prospect of the game of the millennium coming to their machines courtesy of US Gold, what else could we do but bring you the latest up-to-the-minute info on what on promises to be the conversion of the Nineties! IT'S NIPPY, IT IS AMIGA Seeing as none of the sixteen bit computers can match up to the power of the Super Nintendo's turbo nutter custom chips, it would be fair to assume that Streetfighter ll on these machines won't be as fast and furious as the console version in terms of gameplay or so you'd imagine. Although there's some degradation in speed, there's no way this baby can be described as slow. Programmers Creative Materials have slaved long and hard to get the gaming fairly zipping along and, although there have inevitably had to be some graphic omissions, such as the animating backdrops, at least there's no horrible, jerky scrolling in sight. AMIGA WE JUST CANT WAIT! The CVG boys are drooling at the prospect of Streetfighter Il on home computer formats every new demo that comes into the office looks better than the last! With the game scheduled for release in time for you lot to drag it out of your Christmas stocking, there's not much time for Creative Materials to put the final touches to their masterpiece we'll be giving the completed versions the CVG treatment as soon as it's finished, in the form of an all-formats Review Miss it and we'll send Tim Boone round to your house, complete with his Edmond Honda sumo jockeys! YOU'VE GOT THE LOT! GET A GRIP The most welcome news will undoubtedly be that all the characters appear on all the formats even the Speccy! There was a worrying whisper going round that some of the battlers would not make into the final version, or that shock horror one of the four bosses would be left out. But fear not no such travesty is likely to occur and you can expect to see all the street fighters in there. The most frequently asked question pertaining to the home computer conversions of Streetfighter il must be how all the moves can be accessed using just a single button joystick. There were many rumours that US Gold would introduce a special six-button stick to cope with the task, but that idea was eventually chucked out of the window. There are currently a number of different methods under development, all designed to make play that much easier. Some methods will have the player using keys as well as the stick, while another allows sole use of the joystick with some of the moves omitted to compensate. AMIGA PC PC SVG 106 "

"ZU HOTSHOTS DUNGEON MASTER O SUPER NINTENDO O Sword and sorcery slashes its way onto the Super Nintendo in the New Year, when JVC complete their cartridge conversion of the hit computer game, Dungeon Master. This is the game which changed the face of role-playing games and earned its programmers a mint. First-person perspective 3D graphics portray events as you take on the persona of four fantasy fighters in a massive, multi-level labyrinth full of monsters and mayhem. The name of the game is experience accumulation almost every action earns your characters experience points, and the more points you gain, the more powerful your party becomes. There's a wide variety of characters to select and control, from fighters who are, by their very nature, rather handy with a range of different weapons, to magicians whose spells become more and more powerful the more experience they receive. And they'll need all the power they can get once they start delving deeper into the game, for down in the later levels are all sorts of weird and not very wonderful creatures to destroy. It's kill or be killed in Dungeon Master from the outset your brave battlers must deal with monsters such as mummies, wolves, skeleton warriors and strange blobs of jelly and these are the softies! But don't worry too much previous parties have left behind a wide array of objects for your bunch to pick up and use to assist them in their adventures. Super Nintendo owners will be pleased to note that, after a fairly in-depth playtest of a nearly-finished cart, the CVG boys found little difference between this and the original Amiga and ST versions. What that should mean, when the game is released in the first quarter of 1993, is late nights ahoy for weeks, nay months, at a time. Don't go away CVG will be bringing you the full review of Super Nintendo Dungeon Master just as soon as we can!

"PUE HOTSHOTS NO SECOND PRIZE AMIGA otorbike games aren't the ten-a-penny titles on Amiga that car racers are Super Hang-On and EA's brand new Road Rash are the only ones that immediately spring to mind. Perhaps it's because software companies don't think that this fast-paced sport can't be recreated well on computer. Not so, according to Thalion, who are just about to unleash their polygon-based sim No Second Prize onto a speed-crazed public and what a top treat it is! The somewhat flimsy plot has you racing against five other bikers from around the globe, each hoping to win the one available prize of the only motorbike of its kind in existence but the sto ryline takes a back seat to the game itself! We are talking fast 3D graphics here, with you controlling your machine around a huge assortment of tracks. Four different cameras relay the action back to the player in replay mode and, although the game is mouse-controlled only, it's surprisingly easy to ride. Keep an eye open for No Second Prize in the shops it's the game real racers have been waiting for! tome 2 RI MASTER OF DARKNESS MASTER SYSTEM ampires are rather nasty things aren't they? I mean, helping themselves to peoples' blood, just because they can't be bothered to get to the local Arkwrights. Mind you, they have inspired some top films I mean, where would we all be without The Lost Boys? Anyway the story to this latest piece of cartridge crackery goes like this; one hundred years ago a young student was sitting around playing with his ouija board when he received a strange message, instructing him to go the Thames to meet the killer Dracula. Doing as he was told, the young one trotted off to the riverside, unaware of the dangers that lay ahead. As you might imagine, this excit, ing plot translates to a platform-based game of monster mashing, but from what we've seen it isn't too bad. Do battle with the Dark One's minions, from hounds of hell (there's another top vamp film Zoltan, Hound Of Dracula) to undead servants of the neck-biter (while you're at it, try catching the Dead trilogy by George Romero fab stuff). Master of Darkness could be every Drac-fan's dream when it's released in the New Year the moody graphics are looking very good indeed and gameplay is tough and challenging. We'll bring you the full Review the second the game leaves Sega HQ in the meantime, get yer crucifix out and chew on a few cloves of garlic. HISe sa —00 DEE WRON oo ar -VG110 "

If you are currently using your Amiga or ST with a domestic television set, then you are missing out on picture quality. Unfortunately, because your TV is used to receiving inferior UHF transmissions from the airwaves, it only has a UHF socket. So, your computer has to downgrade its high quality digital RGB (Red, Green, Blue) signal to UHF to enable your TV to receive it. However, because your TV can only display using RGB, it has to convert the UHF signal back to RGB before it can put a picture on the screen. Of course, every time you convert from one signal to another, there is a loss of quality which means that the final picture on the TV is not as good as the original signal from your computer. You can overcome this with a monitor, which has an RGB socket, not UHF. Your computer will recognise this, and send its original RGB signal to the monitor which will display the image directly to the screen with no loss of quality. The Philips 8833 is the best selling colour monitor for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Ideal for game playing, it offers excellent colour graphics and has stereo audio speakers for enhanced stereo output from the Amiga and ST-E. The performance and reliability of the 8833 is exceptional, which is why we are confident to offer 12 months ON-SITE warranty with every Philips 8833 monitor.
