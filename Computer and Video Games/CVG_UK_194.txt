Obviously you're about to discover you're wrong (anyone who voted N64, or PlayStation), since we have a huge photo of Game Boy printed next to this box. Yes the accolade of coolest console goes to Nintendo's pocket-size portable. Game Boy. Eight years old. A monochrome green. Should be crap, but it supports the world's biggest-selling game, and is still selling more in a year than Sega's total installed base of Saturns (according to last year's sales figures). More surprising than that, Game Boy's most popular Mario title Mario & Yoshi sold almost as many copies as Mario 64 (100,000 and 125,000 respeo tively). Puny figures, we should add, compared to Pocket Monster on Game Boy, which is selling in excess of 40,000 a week, bringing the current total to 4.5 million! The gaming world is still sold on Game Boy. This makes us feel very happy, since it confirms our belief that the most influential players out there still love videogames. Over three million UK players own a Game Boy. Together you account for over m spent on GB games each year. In 1998, THE Games plan to release at least two major games for the world's smallest console Goldeneye and Warioland 2. But you need to demand something even greater from Nintendo. You need to demand that they release Pocket Monster here in the UK Because if they do, you'll be responsible for starting a craze so HUGE it will eclipse anything that has gone before it.

MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR SENIOR STAFF WRITER CURRENT FAV GAMES:  DIDDY KONG RACING  ACTUA SOCCER 2  GRAN TURISMO  QUAKE  ULTIMA ONLINE ALEX HUHTALA Blue pad users are calm and loyal, but tend to be sensitive. \"Crying when they are happy or sad, blue choosers leave themselves open to others\". They like multi-player games, especially ones with clearly defined rules. Every month CVG gets sent the E latest control-pads. Many fail to grab our attention. However Interact have taken a novel approach with their pads, commissioning a scientist to reveal what a coloured joypad says about its owner. We thought the results might interest you. \"The sensation of colour is a primitive one,\" states Professor Jack Sanger. \"Reaction to it, recognition of it, requires little effort of intellect or imagination. Colour conveys moods that affix themselves quite automatically to human feeling.\" So to round up this flatulence, here's what Prof Sanger reckons each coloured pad says about its owner. BLUE:LOYAL lex's favourite ever Christmas present was the Millennium Falcon he got as a kid. As the gripping tale goes, it was what he wanted more than anything in the world, but after opening all his presents it wasn't there. However his folks had hidden it until last, so he did get it after all. In fact, we often find him sitting inside it, beside the hologram chessboard, eating half a pea, one crumb and a drop of lemonade. STAFF WRITER CURRENT FAV GAMES:  GRAND THEFT AUTO  MONKEY ISLAND 3  QUAKE  GRAN TURISMO  OPTIMUS PRIMAL Those who prefer black pads are loners who reject establishment values. \"Black has an association with saying no. Finding others' mistakes brings out BLACK:NO! their tenacious spirits\". Black users also like god games, where the orthodoxies are overthrown via fantasy. JAIME SMITH Red pad users are impulsive, sexy and have a strong will to win. \"However it can also have a darker side. Red personalities feel invincible and others tend to think RED: SEXY they are. They're quick-minded, who may not be well-educated but are quick with answers because they have lived the circumstances.\" They prefer shoot 'em ups, beat 'em ups, fast platform games and sports sims. aime describes his favourite ever Christmas present as sad, Sad as in pathetic. It was Pac-Man on the Atari VCS. And the reason it was great was because it was his only VCS game. Except Combat, which you got free. And so this simple gesture of festive generosity pushed Jaime into the heady world of videogaming. He also modelled himself on his gaming hero, as you can see from this photo. Finally the transparent pad. Users of these are scientifically minded. They are obsessed by technology. The postmodern element also appeals to would be designers, architects and such like.

"computer video games FINAL FANTASY VII BREAKS ALL UK RECORDS [ THE KING OF VIRTUAL PETS new breed of Tamagotchi has been revealed to us by Bandai. A virtual pet based on none other than Elvis Presley! The Elvisgotchi has all the functions of the original Tamagotchi with a few twists. Food is now represented as a big hamburger. Eat enough and your Elvis grows from his raw '50's lean look, into an overweight lounge singer who can't stop sweating. The peek-a-boo game is replaced by a guitar. Please your singer by performing some meaty rhythm and blues, with a tinge of gospel. The duck that used to clean up your pet's mess, has now been replaced by a more acceptable toilet. Discipline is now represented by some army stripes. If your Elvis doesn't perform to a Vegas standard, give 'em some army training. Neglect Elvis and he demands attention indicated by an adoring female fan. Or perhaps your pet wants young female flesh! Finally, the needle to inflict medication, should Elvis get ill, takes on a bizarre new twist. Rumours that combined button presses of medication, food and toilet causes Elvisgotchi to overdose, explode and die are unconfirmed. This incredible new addition to the growing Tamagotchi range is still only a concept. However, if there's enough interest in Elvisgotchi, you never know, it may appear at a local toy shop soon. To voice your approval, call Bandai on 01489 790944, and demand A-hunk-a-hunk-a-burnin'-love. In an egg. Elvisgotchi be granted life! inal Fantasy VII hit the UK on Friday November 14th. And in a repeat performance of its Japan and the US releases, it beat all previous sales records on PlayStation, Saturn, PC and N64, selling 48,000 copies in only two days! This figure took even Sony by surprise. According to their estimates, the game has made .2 million in retail revenues, which almost beats the figure from the first two days sales of the Spice Girls new album. Meanwhile, the game has passed the three quarter of a million sales mark in the United States, where its opening sales made more money than the number one filmGI Jane at the American boxoffice during the same weekend. 22 COMET CHARTS!

We have to mention a big thanks to all the HMV staff, who in the line of fire had the bright idea to still hold the challenge using a demo disk of the game, so the show went on. We guess this time the challenge game was just so hot, Eidos couldn't get it to the stores in time. As a result of these snags, qualifying times were very mixed. Excellent times of just over 1 minute 45 seconds were common, but so were times closer to three minutes, for those stores where they weren't playing the assault course level. The fourteen qualifiers will meet in the final that takes place on Saturday 24th January at the London Trocadero HMV branch. Giving those competitors who now own the game, the chance to hone their skills, and really go for the record on the assault course. See you there!

Dear CVG I would like to know why there is no HMV/CVG Challenge in Ireland. The third one is approaching and still there are no signs of the two stores in Dublin and Belfast holding heats. Why don't you run a separate final over here because there are a lot of decent gameplayers in Ireland and it couldn't cost that much to fund. I would also like to know which is better and worth the money out of Goldeneye and Final Fantasy VII. D. Kavanagh, Dublin, Ireland. Dear CVG, Is there anyone left in the world who hasn't seen Star Wars? Who hasn't tried to do Chewbacca's strange voice? Or indeed, put a bucket on their head and stomped around the house in a cloak shouting \"Bring me the Princess, I want her alive!\" Or waved a red broom around, shouting at your little brother: \"Your powers are weak old man, now I am the master!\" No? It must be me then. But what would it be like without George Lucas? Without Star Wars?!? I'd better stop right there because I'm scaring myself. Grant Bush, N.Jobling, Gloucestershire. Dear OVG, How about making a Rage Racer type game for the Saturn, but instead of just having loads of rock soundtracks and 2-4 cars like Sega Rally and Manx TT (both still good games), have sound tracks from dance outfits like Sash, Puff Daddy Inc, Dave Angel, Goldie, Roni Size and LTJ Bukem? David Palmer, Derbyshire. THE VOICES OF TORTURED SOULS CVG: Challenge locations are up to the stores themselves. So, unless you can go along with a big group of mates and change the manager's mind, the challenges will stay to mainland Britain. Sorry. As for the games, Final Fantasy VII will last you a lot longer than Goldeneye, and is a great experience. On the other hand, Goldeneye amazes just about everybody who plays it. Hard decision. Wouldn't want to make it for you. I'M HAVING A TIME CRISIS! CVG: Can you imagine hurtling round a corner at over 150 mph in Rage Racer, cutting up a rival as the G-Force kicks in with 'Every step you take' by Puff Daddy blasting in your ears! What an anti-climax. Maybe you could get Elton John, Spandau Ballet and A-Ha as well! THE ALEX HUHTALA FAN CLUB Dear CVG, After reading in issue 190 a 'new games look at Time Crisis', I became very distressed. Yeah, I can hear you now, laughing at this statement, but I noticed something which may apply to a lot of people with newly bought PlayStations. This is that the newer PlayStations only have a port for an RFU adapter. I believe this to be because Sony took out the video out port from the first PlayStations so they could bring the price down to . Basically, my point is you showed a diagram with the Gun-Con plugged into the video out port (so that it had better accuracy), and my machine doesn't have that socket in the back. Does this mean that I can't play Time Crisis, as I was so looking forward to it, started saving the  ages ago. Richard Brookes, Cheshire. Dear.CVG, Computer and Video Games is a saviour to many, many people. It's the best there is and if you don't realise that, then you should wake up and smell the Tamagotchi turd that you shuffle! John Hagen, Elton, Chester Dear Feeble Midget, I am sorry that you cannot reach the door handle to your house. Maybe you should carry a ladder around with you. I own a Saturn.

Where did you get Ed Lomas, surely he can't be real? Xena. No fixed abode. CVG: We tried to get Alex to reply to this letter, but he couldn't reach the keyboard. Poor little fellah.

"computer video games looking in another mag, and there was a woman who looked like Lara Croft. Is there a movie coming out with her in it? Oh, and one other thing: when is Resident Evil 2 coming out as I can't wait for that to come to Scotland? Derek Cairns, Knightswood, Scotland. STAR LETTER SHOULD YOU TRUST THE HIGH FIVE CVG: Both of the games you mention will be made into movies. Res Evil already has Jason Patric cast as Chris Redfield, and if rumours are anything to go by, none of the gore from the game has been lost. As for Tomb Raider, Liz Hurley and Demi Moore are apparently the two favourites to play Lara. And the women you're referring to is Rhona Mitra, who Eidos hired to act as a real life Lara. Mideo DATION SHSIH DEAR DEIRDRE IT ISN'T! SPEE HUISE Dear CVG, I have a few problems with your issue 192. 1. Why the hell were the Spice Girls featured on the PLAT WITRUSI front cover of the magazine when three games, namely FFVII, Time Crisis and Goldeneye had reviews inside. These three were some of the most important ever created (FFVII is a revolution, not a semi-revolution as \"The Mana Hero\" says in #192). The Spice Girls game is an embarrassment for the PlayStation and magazines as big as CVG should not be advertising it on such a big scale. This is not what the PlayStation was made for give it to the cartoony, childish and generally inferior N64. 2. Why does G-Police only deserve a four out of five when it is such a classic game (what is the big problem if any, when it comes to giving G-Police a four)? By the way, have I made the correct choice to save my money for Time Crisis and FFVII instead of G-Police, Tomb Raider 2 and SF EX? Henry Harker, North Yorkshire. Looking at the current performances of the Saturn and the PlayStation, the enormous gap in sales is a total contrast to the quality of the games on each system. The PlayStation has a far greater quantity of games being released, but isn't the quality more important? The public have been convinced by the huge variety of PS games, while the Saturn's limited software library has been its greatest weakness. Obviously the PlayStation has far more third party support, but why is this the case? From looking at the sales chart in Freeplay, it is obvious that it is not the quality games which are flying off the shelves. All we see are endless 'Platinum' games, which have only sold because of the fancy tag. Some of these games are truly dreadful by today's standards (Alien Trilogy, Rayman, Worms), and this shows the ques tionable tastes of many PlayStation owners. Most old Saturn games can be found for under , but because that fact is not advertised, they are ignored. This is another triumph for image over substance. I think that the PlayStation is an incredible machine with a strong future, but this is no reason for 3rd parties to ditch the Saturn so quickly. Just ignoring it because of the low financial return is not good enough. Maybe if they worked with the machine for a while, they would discover its true potential. Sonic Team and the AM departments are continuing to produce stunning games for the Saturn, and there is no reason why others cannot do the same. Their lack of effort is the main reason why such a great system such as the Saturn has failed to penetrate the mass market. P.S. I like the way you have a High-Five celebration when four of them appear in Issue 186. Then seven more come along in issue 192, and it doesn't seem strange. Could it just be the super quality of the new PlayStation releases, or is the High-Five not the accolade it used to be? Gavin Woodworth, Penrith, Cumbria. CVG: You're damn right they are some of the most important games ever created, which is why two of them got covers and Time Crisis was flagged heavily on two covers as well. We're sorry if you didn't like the Spice Girls cover, but the issue completely sold out so somebody did. DEARLY BELOVED THE VOICES OF TORTURED SOULS Dear CVG, I've got an idea for a pedal you could use for Time Crisis. Place a light and fairly large book over the buttons of the joypad in port two. Then simply press on it with your shoe while playing to duck undercover. This is much Y'know that stuff about easier and more hygenic method than cheese coming from milk? Lies. using cheesy toes P.S. Please pray for my cyber-dog, Snowy, who was murdered at 46 years of age by a bastard who pressed the reset button and whose arms are now broken. RIP Snowy (Sniff). Robert Bui, London. CVG: Cheesy Toes. This letter was OK until we got to that part TAMAGOTCHI HITS HOLLYWOOD Dear CVG, You may already know this, but there is going to be a Tamagotchi movie. As with any craze in Japan, an animated feature wasn't long in coming. The Tamagotchi movie begins with \"Dr. Bonzo,\" an unfortunate man who has struck out on his one hundredth \"marriage meeting\". Being dumped for the 100th time seems to have been the last straw for Bonzo and, feeling depressed and lonely, he goes to sit and think by the riverbank where he sees a UFO land. Rushing to the location, he finds the residents of the saucer to be the mysterious Tamagotchi. Dr. Bonzo then decides to investigate the mysteries of the Tamagotchi, which assume are revealed in the film. Tamagotchi: The Movie was released in Japanese cinemas this summer and should be out on video in America now, though I doubt it will ever come out over here. If it is, then it will be released by Anime Projects, AD Vision or Anime Pioneer, and considering the film's nature, certainly not Manga Video. I was thinking you could buy the film on import and review it in the magazine. Andy C. CVG: We all know that the Saturn is a cool machine, but the fact is developers outside Japan will not make as much money from Sega's machine as they would from Sony's. Sony learned from the mistakes they made in marketing Walkmans and Discmans and used that to their advantage by making the PlayStation the first console it was 'cool' to own. As it becomes more and more mass market, so the bulk of the owners is made up of more casual game players. The real fans bought the machine ages ago, and they know what to avoid. Everyone else who is just entering the market sees the prospect of cheap games as much more appealing than those priced at -plus. As for your comment about the High Five, our standards haven't changed one lota. Of the seven games you refer to, four were on PlayStation. Final Fantasy VII and Time Crisis cannot be disputed. SF EX Plus Alpha is one of the best arcade conversions ever, and Castlevania is an all time classic 2D platformer. Remember that the High-Five is given to classic games, and all of those fit into that category. LETTERS CVG: Our hats go off to the mysterious Andy C as there was indeed an animated Tamagotchi Movie. It's success in Japan must have been limited due to the lack of coverage it received, but needless to say, we're tracking down a copy at the moment and as soon as we have one, you'll be the first to know. 17 "


"computer Video games SURVIVAL HORROR BY CAPCOM  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD COMPLETE PLAYER SPRING RELEASE 1 PLAYER TM PlayStation 16  RELEASED BY CAPCOM TEL IMPORTER NELIMPORTER PlayStation Resident Evil 2 takes the now-famous \"world of survival horror\" to the next level, with graphical environments, storyline, and character design that utterly smash the original. t's hard to say the words \"Resident Evil 2\" without a tremble in the jaw, a quivering of the bowels and a clenching of the gut. Capcom fanatics have been waiting for this game nay, not just a game, an event for what seems like an eternity. We've waited and waited, through delays, through a graphically inferior Saturn version, a graphically superior PC version, through rumours of Resident Evil Dash, through a barely-worth-mentioning remixed original (Director's Cut, minus uncensored video sequences), through a complete revamp from scratch of the sequel's game design, and through more delays. Finally, the event has almost arrived, and guess what? Resident Evil 2 was worth its wait... in entrails! R.P.D. RESIDENT EVIL ? WORLD'S FIRST PLAYTEST! SATISFYING STORYLINE A frozen secret laboratory! Wes Craven (director of Scream) would be proud of Capcom's script writers, as the postmortem Resident Evil 1 story follows one of the great tenets of any real horror movie: no one believes the heroes. Despite Chris and Jill's best efforts to warn the Raccoon Police Department (R.P.D.) about the horrors they barely survived in the mansion at the edge of town, their tale gets laughed off as so much hallucinative rubbish. It's now two months later, Chris, Jill, and Barry are gone (Where to? You'll find out in the game), and Raccoon City has been completely overrun by zombies. How did this happen? Gee, could it be some nasty virus from that pesky Umbrella corporation? Experiments gone wrong? Nahhhh. Those policemen should have listened to Chris and Jill's warnings. Now look at them. All they can do is scratch, bite, sniff, chew, eat, and slop. Not to mention itch. (If you didn't play the first game that last bit probably has you wondering...) Claire Redfield, Chris' scantily-clad and vivacious sister, hasn't heard from her brother in months. (By the way, Claire even sports the exact same \"Made in Heaven\" bomber design on the back of her jacket as her erstwhile bro. And hey, look she's got that combat knife holster on her shoulder, too! Makes you wonder, don't it?) Lovely Claire rides into town on her Harley searching for her sibling, but instead finds nothing but good ol' American apple pie. Not to mention flesh-eating zombies. At the same time, Leon S. Kennedy, a new out-of-town recruit to the recently-beleaguered R.P.D., hasn't heard from his new employers since the interview but shows up for work anyway (fully clad in uniform! What, like they gave him one once he'd been approved for him to, like, practice feeling cop-like in?) Bad decision; always check with your new boss to make sure he hasn't become one of the undead since he offered you stock options. Thus the stage is set for RE 2. Search Chris' desk and check out his diary. You'll get a clue about the current whereabouts of the S.T.A.R.S. of Resident Evil 1. The words \"Europe\" \"Umbrella headquarters\", \"secret laboratory\", and \"Resident Evil 3...?\" somehow spring to mind. (COVER STORY 18 Leon and Claire are the heroes of Resident Evil 2. Say hello! "


"video games CASTING CALL SS RE 2's cast of characters is much more diverse, American woman who is looking for her missing well-written, and developed than RE 1. What a boyfriend, John... but does she have other concept, characters with personality! The two motivations? (By the way, original Resident Evil primary supporting characters are Ada Wong and fans may remember the passwords from the Sherry Birkin. Ada is a beautiful Chinese \"R.O.P.L.S.\" computers in the mansion lab: ADA and JOHN. Simple coincidence... or does Ada have some connection to Umbrella?) Sherry Birkin is a little 12-year-old girl wandering through the hell of the R.P.D.; you must protect her from anything and everything. SHERRY ADA PlayStation ENTRANCE Sherry's frightened and she needs a nice adult to help her in this world of terror. Claire's not into baby-sitting, but today she'll make an exception. Ada wants your help finding her boyfriend, but there may be more to her than meets the eye. Admittedly, what you can see of her is pretty nice! Sherry's survival isn't much of an issue with four health sprays, but all the same you might not want to pat the doggies too much. And don't go talking to strange men with their faces hanging off. At this ventilation shaft, Leon boosts Ada up and then you take control of her in a brief section (much like with Sherry). She's not much better than Sherry with only a pistol at her disposal. RESIDENT ET 2 WORLD'S FIRST PLAYIT 1 When you're in control of Sherry, you'll have to solve a puzzle for Claire to be able to advance. Rule number one about the R.P.D.'s morgue: the dead don't always stay dead. Stay alert! RE 2 is filled with mini-story events where the screen goes letterboxed. Notice the gaping hole in this cop's chest; the next time Claire sees him, he's gonna be hungry.... O The amazing part is that you can actually play as these supporting characters at certain points in the game. These points are fairly brief, but add an unexpected and thrilling change of pace. It's especially cool to play as Sherry, as she's too small of a lass to carry any weapons of her own. Your only chance is to run for it! Fortunately, she's ready with four health sprays, and can take more damage than the adults. Seems strange, doesn't it... perhaps Capcom wants to avoid scathing letters from overzealous mothers about the graphic death of a 12-year-old girl in little Nigel's new PlayStation game by making it next-to-impossible to kill her! There are other non-playable characters including the scoop-hungry reporter Ben Bertolucci, chief of police Brian Irons (who bares a striking resemblance to Mike Haggar, former mayor of Metro City) and the husbandand-wife scientist team William and Annette Birkin. With its great complement of characters, RE 2 offers more intrigue and suspense than RE 1 ever had. Reporter Ben Bertolucci would rather stay locked up in his cell then risk his sorry ass trying to escape the R.P.D. To be honest, we don't blame him. R STORY Annette Birkin is a brilliant scientist who wants her husband's work to live on at any cost. She doesn't care about certain other people living on though. Chief of police Brian Irons is hiding out somewhere deep within R.P.D. Will he help you? And who's the gorgeous corpse? 19 "

THE BOSSES RESIDENT EVIL 2 WORLD'S FIRST PLAYTEST! RE 2's designers have gone overboard on the enemy design in this game whereas the original sported a total of three different zombies, the sequel has more than eight, including a truly distressing, scantily clad female zombie, and zombies engulfed in flame! Producer Shinji Mikami has even gone on record saying he wanted to include child zombies... too bad he didn't. Woulda been juicy. Other returning enemies from the original include the Cerberus, the Web Spinner, and crows, but most have been replaced with equally terrifying new deviants such as scuttling red monstrosities that are long of tongue, leaving behind puddles of drool as they go, incredibly hard to kill plant-based fiends, and a lovely new If you played the demo, prepare for a shock menagerie of new bosses these zombies will bust through the chain link fence. 1 You know it's Resident Evil when the bosses have gross red eyeballs growing out of their sides. 1 Are the croc's eyes larger than his stomach?

All characters gnawed on giving a manly shove, breathe convincingly now, but the they hurl zombies across the real attraction is the new limping screen, which will also knock system. As you get beaten down by adjacent zombies down. Let's see foes, Leon and Claire will notice those wimps Chris Redfield and Jill ably slow down, first clutching their Valentine try that, eh?! PlayStation The area of sound has been just as greatly improved on as everything else, if not more so! \"How can this be?\", you may be wondering, «RE 1's pseudo-musical, ambient soundtrack provided a perfect accoutrement to the horror theme, adding an underlying, subconscious feeling of foreboding desperation to the already bleak situation before you.\" Then again, maybe you weren't. But in any case, RE 2's soundtrack is just that a soundtrack. The PCM (music playing on the internal sound chip. rather than from CD) quality here may even surpass that of Final Fantasy Tactics until now, the best chip generated music heard on the PS. What about the voice acting? Is it as ridiculously slow and cheesy as the first game? Almost. Would it be Resident Evil otherwise? Because of the unbelievably corny way she says it, Sherry's \"I don't know, the door won't open!\" is notable. Listen for it near the end of the game when playing as Leon; it's just S00000 bad. The game's other sounds, from some truly disturbing zombie moans to the rat-tat-tat of an Ingram sub-machine gun, are quintessential Resident Evil. Most impressive is the range of sound effects Leon or Claire's feet create, from crunching glass to clanging metal catwalks. 1 Shake out when you're being bitten. If they're gnawing your ankle, it's head smashin' time! RESIDENT ETI 2 WORLD'S FIRST PLAYTEST! 1 If they're biting your shoulder you'll shove them away. 1 The heroes grab their stomach or drag their leg when injured. When they're in really bad shape, they'll use a weapon as a crutch. HORRIFYINGLY FAMILIAR GAMEPLAY Key items can be in hard to reach locations. You've got to figure out a way to lower this ladder. Puzzles require you to push objects around, just like RE 1. Search everywhere for secrets; some aren't so obvious. Play mechanics remain largely similar to the first RE. There are the now-standard item boxes, limited ammo, ink ribbons, typewriters, health sprays and tricoloured herbs. There's even a throwback to the four Crests of the original Chess-themed Plugs (Rook Plug, Bishop Plug, etc.) The puzzles remain similar too; pushing stuff around, pulling levers, and using the right item at the right place are generally the name of the game. There's some new stuff, like blowing walls up with plastic explosives and augmenting your weaponry, but we're talking mostly standard Resident Evil ness. COVER STORY The fireplace plays host to a fairly obvious puzzle. You have to roast a pig (not really). If you're stuck on a puzzle, clues are usually right around the corner. Make sure you explore everywhere thoroughly before giving up. "


"computer video games RESIDENT EVIL 2X4 * * * GUNSHOT WOUNDS PlayStation The main addition to the gameplay is the too-cool-forwords Zapping System. This somewhat mysterious gameplay improvement centres around beating Leon or Claire's basic quest, then saving to memory card. You're then able to play an alternate, totally different game of RE 2 that's adjacent to the original scenario, so to speak. We won't reveal too much, suffice to say that RE 2 hasn't really begun until you've beat it once. This means that if you beat the game with both Leon and Claire, you'll have access to four different RE 2 scenarios, complete with different locations, items and enemies... that's four, four, four games in one, people! Is that a megabargain or what? The RE 2 arsenal has also been increased dramatically. I'm going to list every weapon in the game, so if you don't want to ruin this part of the adventure, by all means skip this section... NOW. Returning from the original game are the Combat Knife, Handgun (an 18-round HK-22 Viper and a 13-round Browning), Shotgun (now a sawn-off Remington Bulldog). Grenade Launcher, Magnum, Flame Thrower and Rocket Launcher. Added are a Bowgun, the Calico 950 a The man behind the counter is holding a shotgun in Leon's game, rapid-fire rifle with a rotary clip, the but a bowgun in Claire's game.

Yeah that gun. But the real excite ment of RE 2 weapons is the ability to upgrade them with various customised parts you'll find lying around Raccoon City. For instance, you can upgrade your handgun to rapid fire or increase the length of your Shotgun barrel, giv Claire Redfield models her Here, Ada bandages Leon up ing it enough power to rip a zombie's new devastating, multi-ammo and his costume changes!

RE 2 is maybe 80% done, and key elements (such as the opening and ending FMV) have yet to be added. Also, the game seems a bit easy in its current form, mostly because you get three ink ribbons per pick-up (RE 1's English version limited you to two). Assuming the wizards of game balance at Capcom get it right, RE 2 will be an event no PlayStation owner will want to miss. C "

We've got Irally games, Formula One titles, high speed thrills with the likes of Rage Racer, and even aeroplane racing. So what are Sony going to do to make everybody go and buy this one? Strictly speaking, that's something we're not going to be able to answer until we have a completed version, but the demo we've played has given us a fair idea. Gran Turismo is going to feature cars galore, all based on real vehicles which can be customised to suit your driving needs, and all of which have to be earned by skillful driving, as in Rage Racer. It certainly looks as though Sony of Japan are spending the time with this, and we'll have a bigger update next month. SONY TAKE ON NAMCO WITH GRAN TURISMO! DO YOU KNOW WHY WE STOPPED THE CAR? TEST DE * 3rd MEN AND THEIR MOTORS A big selling point for this game is the number of cars available for you to race. There are ten different makes to choose from, and for each make of car, there are five different models to choose from. If you fancy following in the recent footsteps of Keith Flint from the Prodigy and hopping into a TVR, then this game lets you do that. Also selectable are Aston Martins, Chevrolets and Hondas, And if you can't afford a brand-spanking-new car, the game offers you the chance to buy second-hand models, but you then run the risk of buying a really clapped-out motor that falls apart on the third bend. One of the novel things about Gran Turismo is the driving test facility that lets you get used to the way the game handles. The lesson begins with a simple task, such as an emergency stop, where you have to bring the car to a standstill at an exact point on the circuit. Complete that and a new task is assigned, like taking a corner at a certain speed. The further in you get, the harder the tasks get and eventually, an entire lap is set before you, where you have to finish all of previous objectives in one go! Cool. The competition gets tough as the other racers try and do a 'Schumacher\" on you! Dirty gits.

This version however, is something completely different! 194/ 200 200 200 SPANZER DRAGOON he programmers behind the Panzer series, Team Andromeda, have to be applauded for trying something different. It would have been quite easy for them to make the third Panzer Dragoon game another fantasy shooting epic. But they've proven their ingenuity as developers by taking the best elements of Panzer, and incorporating them into a role-playing game. To their credit, Andromeda has decide to keep the outstanding visual style of the previous games in Panzer Dragoon Saga. Even in the early demos we were treated to, the graphics were nothing short of stunning. All the light-sourcing, animation and shading are superb, and all we have to wait for now is an English text version so we can tell you how it plays! SAGA ISO PANZER DRAGOON GOES RPG ON SMACK MY DRAGOON UP! The combat interface in Saga is a little different to any previous Dragoon games. There's a group of icons to the left of the screen, and each one is a different attack or spell you can cast. You can attack a single enemy with a group of laser shots or fire a big ger but weaker cluster of lasers at multiple targets. You can cast spells once you have learned them and heal yourself as well. Anyone who forks out for the Japanese version will have problems getting to grips with it because of the Jap text, but there is a training mode inside the game which should get you going.

When you're walking around the houses, villages or towns you come across, the view shows the hero, Azel, strolling around chatting to people, buying items, etc. Travelling between towns is the second style, and that is the most reminiscent of the old Panzer games because you're shown riding on the back of your dragon. When enemies pop up you can fly into them to activate the combat mode. This being an RPG, the combat is more reminiscent of that in Final Fantasy as it relies on an energy bar being full before you can attack. Shooting baddies drains the bar, and you have to wait until it has filled itself back up before you can attack again. As you can see, the bosses are nothing short of amazing.

The reason for these particular letters is that the evil Dr. Knarf has decided to take over the world using vegetables blah blah blah. The way to find these is usually a lot more complicated than just smashing open a crate, as there is a strong puzzle element to this as well. If the crate doesn't reveal a letter, then you're more than likely to get a pumpkin. Collect one hundred of these and guess what? You get an extra life. 100 SPIN SPIN SUGAR The 3D glory of this game comes into effect with regard to the camera angles. At any point in the game, you can spin the view round 360° to make tricky jumps that little bit easier. This can also reveal hidden bonuses that are at the top of otherwise obscured trees or ledges. Simply whacking either of the shoulder buttons moves the camera in the same direction. COMING SOON Jump into the fountain and it will shoot you skywards, and into this letter. Only another four more to go. Once they are found, then you can... BETTER THE DEVIL ...enter the doors marked K. They are usually tucked away some where, and there will be more than one door on the level. Start hunting people. Jersey Devil should be in the shops very soon, but even so, we'll be giving our opinion on Ocean's big Christmas title next month. 'Til then readers. "

"computer Video games 80% COMPLETE BY EIDOS D E8 PlayStation  PAPERBACK BOOK VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD 3D ACTION FEB RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS  RELEASED BY EIDOS TEL 0181 636 3239 ROM PlayStation The game isn't even out, but already Deathtrap Dungeon has sold in its millions and jump-started a worldwide craze. And that was fourteen years ago! AN LIVING STONES ROM an Livingstone is the head of multiDE ATH TRAP an Livingstone is the head of multimillion pound games company, Eidos. And his success is largely due to a collection of books he co-wrote back in the Eighties. The Fighting Fantasy series allowed the reader to take part in adventures, making choices by turning to different pages of the book. The concept was a huge success, with kids reading the books in schools everywhere (with their fingers marking about eight different sections). To date, the Fighting Fantasy series has sold 14 million copies in 23 languages, and the best-selling of the bunch is Deathtrap Dungeon. Livingstone always planned to turn the books into videogames, and now he has the chance. The technology is available, Livingstone is in the right place and Deathtrap Dungeon is coming! IT'S A TRAP! LOOK, THERE'S SOME MORE! The left pic features deadlier weapons. DEATHTRAP DUNGEON. NOW MINUS FIDDLY PAGES! YE OLDE RENTOKILL. To help flesh out his vision of the Deathtrap Dungeon videogame, Livingstone has called on the talent of some age-old colleagues. Assisting with the game design is Richard Halliwell who designed the Space Hulk and Warhammer tabletop battle games for Games Workshop (a company that Livingstone also founded). Together with Jamie Thompson editor of Whie Dwarf and creator of the Way Of The Tiger books they've created what they promise are some of the most fiendish traps ever seen. DUNGEON RAIDER The plot to Deathtrap Dungeon is classic fantasy stuff, and fans of the book will recognise it instantly. The city of Fang has become the residence of a red dragon, who has forced the citizens to build a deep labyrinth around him. With the people gripped in fear, the city's ruler, Baron Sukumvit, has offered a reward of 10,000 gold pieces to anyone who can slay the dragon. Many have attempted 'The Walk', all have failed. Now you have arrived to face the challenge. Or as the dragon calls it, sport! Deathtrap Dungeon's structure is very similar to Tomb Raider's. Playing as either a barbarian or scantily-clad (and fashionably large-breasted) female, you view the action from a third-person perspective. You can also spin the camera around the main character, or stop and survey the area through their eyes. There are ten levels, with ten more sub-levels. These take you from the dungeon's entrance, through such colourfully-named areas as the Snake Girls' lair (complete with aforementioned scaly wenches), The Hive, The Sunken Castle, and finally the Dragon's Lair. Fine examples of Paul's 'facing north' dance. Must have followed my trail of smarties! COMING SOON IF I C-CAN JUST R-REACH M-MY... PIG BOMB The dreaded Breakfast Table stage TIME STANDS STILL DUNGEONEERS... There's a huge range of weapons in Deathtrap Dungeon, and some of them demonstrate the twisted sense of humour that's gone into the game. Close range weapons come in the form of swords and hammers. And magical versions like the Black Spiritsword are awesomely wieldy blades. Slashing combos can be pulled off too resulting is some excellent decapitation. For true pyrotechnics though, you have to find the long-range weapons. Blunderbusses, flamethrowers and most bizarre of all, a pig that homes in on the closest creature. Throw it badly though, and it goes for you! Fighting Fantasy fans are drooling over the prospect of a brilliant Deathtrap Dungeon videogame. And with the original creator taking such a hands-on approach, it's all looking, highly promising. A review next month, and if things go well, other FF games are promised. 32 "

Buckets of it! MYTH BLOODTHIRSTY MEDIEVAL BLOODTHIRSTY MEDIEVAL BATTLE IN MYTH! yth may look like another reworking of Command and Conquer, but it isn't. You don't erect buildings, you don't make your own troops and you don't have tanks. It's your warriors against the enemy, and last man standing is the makes his team a winner. It sounds simple, but the best games often are. The key to being successful in Myth is to try and plan ahead. Ploughing in with all weapons slashing and hacking is fun and funny, but more often than not leads to your death. Enemies appear half way through the level just when you think you've got the existing soldiers licked. Scenery has an effect too, with archers often found waiting at the top of steep cliffs to have a better chance of picking you off. Then there's the of blood too loads of it. Arms, legs, heads, gut and entrails all litter the battle arena once the action has died down, so don't play it eating your dinner. THE KNOCK ON EFFECT SMALL BUT PERFECTLY FORMED The undead are almost defeated. Keep the village secure to win the level. Dwarves are the most important characters to have in your team. They're physically weak, which is why you mustn't let them get exposed, but their offensive talents are not to be sniffed at. They have two forms of attack which involve bombs. The first is a simple petrol bomb-style affair: an explosive is hurled into the air and explodes on contact with the ground anything in the vicinity will instantly turn into a mess of giblets. The second sees the dwarves lay small packages that act as mines, and erupt once somebody touches them. Members of your own team can also detonate them, so beware! Laying multiple mines is also a good way to get a group of enemies killed in one go. Once each of the mines are close enough to each other, they explode in a chain reaction. An arrow is often a good way to start one of these, as a well placed spear is enough to trigger the sequence. If any weapons or shrapnel dropped by dead soldiers are lying around as well, they fly off in all directions. These kill enemies, but more often than not just cause wounds. THAT CINEMATIC FEELING The 3D engine enables you to have complete control over the view of the game. Everything in the game is a 3D model, so rotating and zooming around is 'meat and drink', especially under the influence of 3Dfx PC's. COMING SOON The guy throwing lightening is called a Fetch. Getting close is the only way to kill them quickly. MAGICAL MYTHERIES With a February release looming we'll have the full review next month. This could be a big title, so keep an eye out for it.

Nothing like 'western' golf games that concentrate more on simulation, this one just sets out to be fun and easy to play.

Press once to set the power meter moving. Press again to set the strength of the shot, then, as the meter comes back to the start, you need to press the shot button again when it reaches an accuracy mark to send the ball 'straight down the middle'. Miss the mark and your ball veers off to the left or right when you hit it.

"BETTER RUN HOME TO MOMMA NOWS A PINK JACKET WITH THOSE SHORTS!?! computer video games The main criticism aimed at the first game was the fact that you tackled each slope alone. The only way to really race was against your previous best times, and the ghost data of your best attempts. Well, Snowboarding Combined gives you seven more riders to compete against, but best of all is the new two-player mode. Now with the aid of a split-screen, you can race a friend over the Free Ride courses. You can only race one-on-one, and not against the other computer riders, but this is still a brilliant addition, PlayStation A minor difference from the original, but one that works well is the character select option. In the original game you had the choice of a male or female rider, and then you had to decide on what they wore on the slopes. For the sequel you must choose a character to play as. At the start of the game there's a choice of four two male and two female. Again you can select their fashions, and what board they'll be riding. The difference however, is that each character has different abilities, some are faster than others, better at turning, able to perform better jumps or have greater balance. The trick is to select the character that is right for the style of course and game you are playing.

There are no clocks, no other competitors. Just you, your board and some obstacles. The idea here is to have fun, just jumping over barrels, performing rail slides and leaping over abandoned cars.

The number of moves you can perform is impressive. Tricks are put together with the use of the four shoulder buttons. Performing combos with these, it is possible to string long lists of moves together, which is essential if you want to get the really big points. The one thing to remember is to keep your momentum going while in the half pipe.

The engine used to drive the game is very impressive, using a similar approach to the one Travellers Tales used on Sonic R, where objects 'mist' into view, rather than just popping up. Another neat lit tle trick is the way the lower sections of the courses are a lot dirtier. Here the snow is brown from 'overuse', and of course there's not as much virgin snow as at the mountain top.

And there's lots more secrets available after this lot that we're just not going to tell you about yet. The controls for Steep Slope are quite different for a game of this type. Moving the D-pad shifts your weight and changes direction, and you can pull off tighter turns by jamming down the shoulder buttons.

Play Goalies in attack, defenders in midfield, midfield and forwards in defence, and your star striker in goal. It may sound dumb, but it can make some games a lot more exciting. We've called this game Tekken Twister, but it works with any fighting game. So we've chosen to play the awesome Fighters Megamix using the same rules instead. You'll need two teams of three to partake in the ultimate battle mode. Start a normal battle mode with each team selecting their characters. Now the real fun begins. Each team of three has control of one pad, with each player controlling buttons A, B and C respectively. Player A also controls the D-pad. While whoever is using C, can also operate the shoulder button. When battles commence, each team must shout out combos and commands to give them a chance of winning. Alternatively, teams just bashing the buttons should produce some bizarre results. MUST PERFORM COMBO URRGHHHH! GOLDEYESE TTLE OF THE BONDS GUARANTEED TO BREAK THE ICE AT PARTIES CHOOSE YOUR STRAWS MR BONDS, SHAKEN NOT STRED THE GAME'S BOND!' AND I'M BOND! ME TOO! HAHA! IM SEAN COMERY AT THE VERY TDP OF THE BOND PROXNG ORDER w Those are our favourite games to play at the moment, but we know there are loads more out there just waiting to be invented. Instead of retiring your old games to the bottom of your 'played that a million times' pile, try thinking up new ways to play them. You may be surprised to discover a completely new game. Of course these games aren't restricted to the originals that we've selected here. Try playing Sega Rally Buckaroo for instance, or a Quake Battle of the Bonds. The choice is yours. If anyone thinks they've come up with an original way to play a chosen game, please send us in your suggestion, if we like it enough, we might just put it to the test. THE NAMES BOND, JAMES BONDI You need four people to assume the role of the different James Bonds, then battle it out in a multiplayer game. First of all you'll need four straws of varying length to decide who is which Bond. Argue amongst yourselves to decide who was the best Bond, down to worst. You'll probably find yourself eliminating George Lazenby or Timothy Dalton out of the game, as we can only accommodate four Bonds. The current running order of Bonds here at CVG are (in reverse order); Timothy Dalton, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery. The short straw gets to play as the elected weakest Bond and so on. When the game begins you must remember these simple rules each Bond can only use specified weapons, which are as follows. The worst has to use the Hand Chop, third can only use the Walther PPK, the second best is allowed the Silenced Machine Gun and the best Bond has the power of the Moonraker Laser. Play until there's only one Bond left standing. If the Bond with the Moonraker Laser defeats everyone,everything went against our plan. If a lesser Bond defeats a higher Bond, the higher Bond must perform a forfeit. To add extra excitement players must perform impressions of their selected Bond, adding a quip when killing another player is extra stylish. At the end of each game the straws are drawn again, so everyone gets to be the different Bonds. HELLO LADEST SPARTY GAMES THIS NEVER HAPPENED   JUST KEEPNG THE BRITISH END UP SRI "

However, this is the successor to Track & Field. We don't PlayStation, Konami have been pret. mind wrapping up warm for this one! D: love aving won back all our hearts with the brilliant Track & Field on the PlayStation, Konami have been pretty busy of late. This year has seen them release updates to International Superstar Soccer, and the latest instalment in the Castlevania series, but next year sees them all guns blazing. Goeman and Metal Gear Solid are going to be two of the biggest games of 98, but before these two comes another biggie the sequel to Track & Field. Now with added snow and ice, and an official licence to make everything seem even more realistic. Strap some planks to your feet, and prepare to become number one in the world. NAMCO WINTER OLYMPICS '98 NO JOKES ABOUT MUESLI NAGANO WINTER OLYMPICS '98 There are two events under the Alpine Skiing banner. These are the downhill and Giant Slalom. In both you have to ski down a course of flags as fast as you can. Miss one flag and you're disqualified. The Giant Slalom actually has the shorter course. The Slalom is a tougher challenge, as you need to negotiate tighter turns and more of the alternating coloured gates. To control your Skier you just have to steer and use button A to apply your ski edges. This results in a loss of speed, but a much tighter turn. While Downhill sees you make one attempt at great ness, Slalom requires two, with your score being calculated from both runs. 16 9 BOP 76 9828.63 nter GOTTA GO FASTER! THE KIDNAPPERS ARE GETTING AWAY!!! THE NINTENDO TWIST 31002 271 Oxalisme 10. 15 Nagano sees the debut of the Hyper Sports formula on the Nintendo 64. However, instead of using the traditional button-bashing control method to increase your athlete's performance, Konami decided that a simulation and simplification of events and joypad techniques was more appropriate to simulate sports which are more dependent on grace and style than sheer power. Another difference is that you can't play all of the events as a competition. Instead only seven of the twelve available make up the fullon tournament. I FEEL A FREEZE COMING Co 9 REVIEW This console reproduction of the Winter Olympics is made up of twelve different events with one thing in common there's a lot of white on screen! To get you better acquainted with what to expect, we'll look at each event over the following pages. We don't want this to sound like an instruction manual, but because all of the events have their own unusual control methods we'll be filling you in on those too. 52 "


"FLY, EDDIE, FLY!! computer video games 1012.05 Tolattame BOVO 216 1823.63 PlayStation There are two classes in the dreaded Ski Jump event, with the K120 being the big cheese. K90 is the easier of the two, mainly because the jump is shorter and there is less wind to fight against. The way it works is, you ski down the curved slope, building up as much speed as possible before the takeoff. Once you're in the air you need to maintain your balance and a good posture, then control your landing. It sounds easy, and after a few hours' practice you'll find that it is. Until then you'll be pulling your hair out in frustration! To command your jumper you have to hold the control stick down before the jump, then press A to send him on his way. When he gets to the edge of the ramp you have to quickly snap the stick up, then back down again. Once you're airborne, wrestle with the stick to your skier balanced in the windy gusts, then when the altimeter bar on the right side of the screen reaches green, you have to press button A to land. It's a lot to get to grips with at first, and also a little difficult to get your hands in a comfortable position around the pad. CANO NAGANO 16 Di Love The courses are apparantly just like the real thing. Except here they are covered in toffee! PN16 0833.63 SLOW RIDE, TAKE IT EASY Erastof The first Snowboarding event is another Giant Slalom. Unlike Alpine Skiing though, Snowboarding is a little more laid back. Your run down the hill is slower, and the gates are easier to pass. The triangular flags that indicate the gates here must be passed in order, red gates on the left, blue gates on the right. The gates are pretty much placed in a straight line that goes all the way down the course. The controls are the same as the skiing sections, with A again used to perform sharper turns. Bespotre I WANT MUSTARD ON THAT 1693 Dr Love NAGANO WINTER OLYMPICS '98 REPLAY 16 XZD love PY 16 In reality, Hotdog Aerials is not an event for the weak-hearted. Contestants ski down a very steep slope, straight into a jump and perform tricks before landing safely again. Once they've done that and escaped with their lives, they've got to do it again, for this is another event where scores are determined from two attempts. Judges look for manoeuvre selection, form and landing. Like the Half-Pipe event, before each go you must select the tricks you plan to perform from a selection of eight. Once you've done that you have to press the A button frantically to build up enough speed to perform the trick, then after completing the manoeuvre, a welltimed press of the B button saves you the embarrassment of landing on your arse. 16.3 ALLEY-OOPS UPSIDE YOUR HEAD Another Snowboarding event but this one's got tricks. Each contes tant must perform eight preselected manoeuvres before the panel of judges. There are over twenty different tricks that you can select, so for max points you should include a wide variety of different skills in your 'act', alternating between turns, twists and huge air. Each move is performed by executing a combo of button presses and control stick commands. The more skilful the trick, the more complex the combo, but the computer steers you through the half-pipe so you can concentrate on pulling off the moves. The judges' scores are based on standard techniques, rotation, amplitude, landing precision and execution. Which is just like the real thing.

"computer Video games PUT SOME PROPER SHOES ON Power Bestue 101231 Totaltisme 1:04.058 If you're thinking 'this isn't like Track & Field', then you're right. However the next event has more in common with the original. Welcome to Speed Skating, home of button-bashing or rather 'button-stroking'. There are two different races a 500 metre sprint and a 1500 metre endurance race. Both use similar controls. A power bar that sits in the top corner of the screen swings left and right and to build up and maintain your speed on the ice you have to press the left and right shoulder buttons in time with the bar's swings. Keeping your presses in sync witht the bar makes your skater go faster, while missing a beat slows him down. In the 1500 metre race you also need to keep an eye on a stamina bar, and if it reaches zero, pray you're near the finish line 'cos Mr Skaters legs will simply refuse to work.

SORE ARSE A contender for one of the most dangerous sports ever invented, the Luge sees you hurtling down the bob sleigh run on little more than a dustbin lid. The event starts with a quick bash of the shoulder buttons to build up speed. In reality this is the part where the Luge rider is clawing his way to the first bend, with some specially spiked gloves. Once you're on that course you must steer your way safely to the bottom. To go faster you'll need to steer higher on the banked sections, but then you run the risk of flipping over and being disqualified.

"WHO'S THIS BOB GEEZER? computer video games Just like the Luge except here, the four riders have the knowledge that they're hurtling down the course in a fibreglass torpedo. The four man team means this event starts off faster than the Luge, but turning can be a bit more sluggish. The sprint at the start is controlled with repeated pressing of the A button, followed by four presses of the B button, which command each team member to get into the bob sleigh. Once they're safely in you have to steer them safely through the twisty course.

He must be Stretch Armstrong's cousin. Besi TIGHT, WAVY OR A KEEGAN PROTO-MULLET? Total time Last month we told you this was the potential joker in the pack. This month we can confirm how awesome it is. Curling, along with bowls which it resembles, may be one of the most boring sports in existence to actually watch, However, playing it is a different matter. Teams compete against each other in a knockout elimination contest played on an ice rink with a large target painted at one end. The idea is to 'curl' stones towards the target. with the winner being the team that gets their stone closest to the centre of the target. The game is played over four separate rounds, in which four stones are curled by each team. One team member throws the stones while two more hang around looking kind of dumb, then start polishing the ice like mad with brushes to spin the stone and make it go faster. The controls are simple, but Curling is more reliant on skill and tactics than the other events. The control stick is used to aim and select powe? for the throw. The B button selects left or right spin and the A button sets the stone in motion. To get the guys with the brushes to start polishing the ice you have to press A repeatedly. No kidding, this is the best event in the whole game, and a lot of fun to play. Curling is the sport of the future. 16 BD Love It's not much of a view unless you're sitting in the front. Next time bring a book. MACANO CVG OPINION NAGANO WINTER OLYMPICS '98 STEAK DO LOVE 1 TURN Have you ever thought, I'd really like a glass of milk', then poured it out, taken a huge gulp and gone, 'EUURRGGHH!' because it had gone sour? Good, because you'll understand how I felt after playing this game. There I was, looking forward to a fine winter sports game in the Track & Field style, but I came away with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. The problem is that this game isn't quite sure what it wants to be, and a lot of this confusion is down to the control methods used for each event. While one event may have some button-bashing, the next requires a different approach. There doesn't seem to be much consistency, and what was wrong with button-bashing in the first place? Of the events themselves, half of them are too dull and similar to each other. Where's figure skating and the biathlon? Historically, that's always been the case with simulations of winter sports, there isn't a great variety of events and unless they're done in a pure arcade, or simulation form they're all very samey and boring. If the numerous skiing events had the pace and style of Namco's Alpine Racer coin-op, Konami would have had something to shout about. Instead, what we have here is a game that only the Ski Sunday groupies will enjoy. ALEX 4WATALA 7STE DI Love 1 TUAN SE West CPV1 TURN STED: Love og REVIEW 'A TALE OF TWO CONSOLES RATING As we mentioned last issue, Konami have. another version of Nagano up their sleeves. The PlayStation edition includes the same events and we'll be reviewing it next issue. It promises to have more in common with Track & Field on the PlayStation than the N64 game, which means button-bashing will feature more strongly too. Which will be the better of the two?

OLT24 OLI Ide o cuch reka SAMSEY 62 ULTIMA ONLINE THE MIRACLE OF BIRTH Once you've logged on to your internet connection and started the game for the first time, you need to create the character you are going to be playing as. Give yourself a name preferably something that fits in with the epic medieval feel of the game, rather than the unimaginative \"Randy Savage\" that we've come across a few times. Now choose what your main line of business is likely to be. You can either distribute your skill points yourself, balancing out how intelligent and physically strong you want to be as well as setting your main abilities, or you can use one of the preset templates as a guide. Then you get to choose how you're going to look. Choose your hair and skin tone, your hairstyle and take your pick of a wonderful selection of beards. Once you've done all of this, it's into the alternate universe of Ultima Online. REVIEW When you're killed you get two choices restart immediately with penalties to your alignment and skill ratings, or become a ghost. As a ghost you must find a friendly wizard who'll bring you back to life. THE PRICE OF A LIFE SRR Even though you're paying top dollar for Ultima Online you're only buying the game (complete with cloth map and pewter pin badge) and a month's worth of play in the Ultima universe. If you want to continue Origin charges a monthly subscription fee of $9.95 (about ). As we write this, EA are importing the game from the USA but they aren't supporting it and they aren't running any servers in Europe, so you have to pay your sub by credit card directly to Origin in the US. Oh, and let's not forget you need your own internet account to play too. So if you really want to spend a whole alternate lifetime in Britannia it could run expensive.  56 "

You just type in whatever you want to say and it appears above your character's head. Anyone who can see you can also hear you. To trade items with other players you just drag them out of your backpack and drop them over another person's head. A box appears to show what each of you is offering, and once you are agreed the items are exchanged. Many of the inhabitants of Britannia are computer controlled NPCs (Non-Player Characters) who have their own artificial intelligence. They react to certain keywords that you say to them, and respond accordingly, though it's always obvious who is a real person and who isn't OLTIma OnLine In certain buildings you can find bulletin boards where players post messages and warnings. This really is the ultimate game idea. It has a completely different feeling to any other game I've ever played, and it really seems completely limitless. The scope for developing your own character is unbelievable, and the skill system is worked out in such minuscule detail that you can be anything you want. The NPCS (computer characters) are often just a hindrance, but have lots of useful information which you can get out of them if you ask the right way. The graphics are just right for a game of this style, but move very jerkily even when you install them to your hard drive (the minimum install is around 300Mb, and the maximum is nearer to 500Mb!). The interface is a bit fiddly and it takes a while to learn how to use each character class, but once you know what you're doing it's not so bad. The biggest problem by far is that there are currently only American game servers, and there are no plans to start any in the UK. This means that everyone will have to put up with games jerking around and freezing up all the time, and that is EXTREMELY annoying. Ultima Online is a unique experience, and is certainly one of the most ambitious games ever made, but (as a lot of American players have already been complaining) it all feels slightly unfinished. It takes ages to get your character anywhere, but if you're willing to put up with the connection problems you could find yourself falling in love with the Ultima Online universe., D JAMAS Don't waste your time making jokes with the NPCs they haven't been programmed with a sense of humour, just like the Americans. Naaaaaaaaaargh! No! No! No! Come on, you damn thing! Work! Work! Let me in! Aaaaaaaaaaaah! MASTER YOUR TRADE REVIEW SKILLS Every character has a large number of skills, each with a rating number next to it. For example, a bard has a high \"musicianship\" rating, but is terrible at stealing. Your distribution of skills is essential when setting up your character, as a warrior who is good at making jewellery isn't going to get very far. Some characters use their skills to make objects which they then sell, such as tailors and bowyers, while others are more useful for defence or attack. Wizards can create spells, and bards can pacify or anger people with their music. Practising a skill increases your rating in that area.

Now that we've finally managed to play the game ere at cvG we're all great admirers properly we can reveal that Mischief Makers is full of surprises! of Japanese developer, Treasure. Their Sega titles, on both Megadrive and Saturn, have all been must-haves, so you can imagine how eagerly we were looking forward to their first N64 title. But when we got our Japanese copy of Go! Go! Troublemakers back in August we plugged it in and oh calamity! how our jaws dropped in dismay. It was a 2D scrolling platform puzzle game with baffling, frustrating action and complicated controls! Had Treasure gone off the boil? Had some key game designer departed? Was the World about to end? Or was it just that the in-game text and instructions were all in Japanese and we didn't understand what was going on? Well, er, yes. That was it. Now that we've got hold of an English text version of the game we've finally discovered the truth about Mischief Makers (as its called in Europe). And here it is! Meet the characters Marina, Professor Theo, and the villains. ALIEN ABDUCTION! HOW TO DRIVE A MARINA Apparently, British industry is in decline because no-one wants to be a scientist these days. Hardly surprising though, what with the ever-growing threat of ALIEN KIDNAPPING. Take Professor Theo, for instance. He's a top man in robotics, and he gets abducted by extra-terrestrials on a regular basis in this game. He and his cybernetically-enhanced chum, Marina Liteyears, have followed a cosmic distress signal to the planet Clancer and when they arrive the Prof is promptly (and repeatedly) shanghaied by the locals. It's all a plot concocted by the local evil Emperor who wants to conquer Earth and has enlisted the help of the easily-led Clancers. Controlling Marina, you have to rescue the Prof, wipe out the Emperor's minions and generals, then confront His Excellency himself for a telling off he won't forget! Mischief Makers is unique among N64 platform games insofar as it has a traditional 2D, horizontallyscrolling playfield and only occasionally uses the machine's 3D graphics capabilities for minor effects like moving floors. It plays almost the same as old-fashioned 2D platformers, and some of Marina's moves, such as the ability to grab and throw enemies, are straight out of Treasure's first game, Gunstar Heroes. Mischief Makers is also unusual in that it doesn't use the 3D Stick. This is so that you can use the D-pad for movement and the C-buttons to fire a quick burst on Marina's rocket thrusters, boosting her left or right (for extra speed), up (for extra jumping height or to hover) or down (to slam whatever she's holding into the ground). There are so many functions on the controller that learning them and managing them all in the midst of a frantic battle is one of the toughest challenges you have to face in this game. REVIEW I've been captured by the Evil Empire? What are you gonna do to me? After a while Professor Theo becomes resigned to the fact that he's going to be kidnapped every few levels. @ "


"SC Imperial HQ * SHAKE IT ALL ABOUT * games 5-51 NINTENDO 64 5-215-5 5-6 Marina doesn't start the game with any weapons at all. Very occasionally there are guns or missiles that she can pick up from fallen foes, but for the most part the only way she can defend herself is by grabbing her opponents and throwing them at something hard, or each other. When she's fighting larger bosses, you have to work out where and when you can catch hold of them with the help of a flashing grab cursor. Before you do smash them into the floor though, try pressing down twice on the D-pad to give them a shake. Sometimes this can empty their pockets of life-giving crystals or other useful items. Try it on the scenery and you might find new areas open up! PHOENIX Y Once a level is completed you can go back and do it again later to stock up on crystals, or find the yellow crystal. When you're in a battle zone like this, the challenge is simply to survive! Get stuck in a puzzle level and it's a good idea to give everything a shake. Here you just have to run for it before the scenery collapses beneath you! RUN! FIGHT? THINK! Listen for the sound that tells you something new has appeared elsewhere in the level. Sasa The action in Mischief Makers is spread over five 'worlds', each made up of between ten and twelve distinct levels. Some of these are more battle oriented, with Marina having to fight her way through crowds of enemy Clancers or take on a single, tougher enemy. Others are puzzle based and they involve exploring the level to find particular objects (ghost, lost children, whatever) or finding a route through the level using teleporter stars, floating Clanballs, Clanballs on rails, bombs and whatever else comes to hand. There is a third breed of level, the Oh-My-God-I've Got-To Keep Moving level, that forces you to move fast to outrun disappearing scenery or tumbling rocks. These will be familiar to any one who's played Konami's old platformers, such as Castlevania IV or Bucky O'Hare, but then that's hardly surprising seeing as many of Treasure's team are ex-Konami staff. That's it, mate, just cough up all of them luvverly crystals. Jump and grab the Clanballs to reach higher places. Marina can bounce herself off Clanballs in any direction. Dig in 'suspiciouslooking places to get a surprise. Often the only way to deal with foes is to grab and slam them. Boost-sliding like this is the fastest way to get around. Crouching and rolling gets Marina through the tiniest gaps. Jump then use Marina's booster to reach high ledges. 59 "


"computer Video games * THE CRYSTAL MAZE Crystals are what keep the game going and they're to be found lying on the ground or floating in hard-to-reach places. Sometimes if you grab a Clancer and shake him, a load of crystals fall out of his pockets. They come in four colours. NINTENDO 64 agaa Blue crystals increase Marina's health slightly and green ones give it a larger boost. You can keep collecting both until you have a maximum three energy bars worth of health. Press IT NOW!! CATCH A FALLING BOMB. 0136 TIME 13:60 For the most part Marina's only weapon is her grab-and-throw technique, but she can also capture heavy artillery such as machine guns and rocket launchers from certain enemies when they die. One other technique that's particularly useful against bosses is Marina's ability to grab enemy shots and throw them back. Missiles, rocks, laser beams and even giant fists can all be 'returned to sender' like this. Which is cool. 10 Normal Continue 30 Life Up Continue 100 Max Power Continue -I'm Done Red crystals don't have any effect during the game, but if Marina runs out of health you can trade them in for extra credits. 100 crystals buys you back into the game with full health.

There is one yellow crystal hidden on each level and the only way to complete the game fully is to find them all. Sometimes they're hidden out of the way. Sometimes enemies have them. MWING IT UP DOWNTOWN Here, Marina grabs the missiles, powers them up with a shake, then sends them straight back! (REVIEW Remember the mix-'nmatch weapon system Treasure used in Gunstar Heroes? Well, there's something similar in Mischief Makers. On some of the later levels there's a Clanpot which you can use to collect and store items such as time bombs and shurikens for use elsewhere. You can also use the Clanpot to create more powerful weapons by dropping objects in it, then giving it a good shake. For instance, if you put three flowers in the Clanpot and shake it you get a shuriken. Mix three shurikens together and you get a boomerang! Pick three flowers... Mix 'em up in the pot... Hey presto! A shuriken! 60 "


"* BOSS OVERLOAD! * computer video games RDE EM CYBOT These springy fellows appear in several levels. Jump on and let him sproing you to new heights. NINTENDO 64 Treasure never skimp on the bosses in any of their games, and Mischief Makers is no different. In the early levels you get simple but nonetheless dangerous foes to deal with at the end of each world. On later levels, minor bosses turn up in every other level, and as Marina proves to be more of a threat to the Emperor's plans, his generals start turning up in their powerful mechs, and even if you defeat them once they may well be back a couple of levels further on for a rematch! When mere running and boosting about aren't enough, Marina has to climb aboard whatever mode of transport is handy. SVO CLANCER WORM A fire-breathing worm that turns up in the Clancer Desert. Just grab its head and keep slamming! Marina has to boost to power the tricycle, but her Clancer stand-in, Teran, can pedal like crazy. Cat Clancer works for the Emperor until Marina beats him at Dodgeball and he agrees to help. BEE CLANCER Bee-ware its powerful sting and when it conjures up a swarm of bees, punch them all to swat them. MIGEN AND MGEN R Jr is the big guy. Grab his fists and throw them at dad, then make him smack himself in the gob. Like Cat Clancer, this ostrich-thing is a good runner and can flap over the Clancer mech's lasers! After this minor boss is defeated in the second world he returns in the last world to help Marina. GENERAL LUNAR CVG OPINION Lunar attacks twice, with bombs and guns, then with his missile-and-laserarmed mech, Cerberus Alpha. GENERAL TARUS Treasure have built a reputation for ingenuity, so expected their first N64 title to be a mega-game with original gameplay and 3D graphics to die for. It came as a shock to find they had stuck with what they know, a scrolling 2D platform game. Worse yet, for the first ten or so levels Mischief Makers provides little to occupy your attention apart from the annoying controls. Whether this is some test of faith to discourage all but Treasure's most devoted fans I don't know, but once through these early levels the quality really shines through. Mischief Makers is like Treasure's Megadrive games unusual action, lots of variety and special effects, a versatile character (once you've mastered those controls), and excellent bosses. Once I'd got into it, I was unable to stop until I'd finished the next level. For a while it looked like Mischief Makers was going to be quickly finished, just because you end up playing the whole thing in one all-night sitting. By the fifth world though, that's clearly not the case. It gets really tough from there on, and even if you do eventually beat the Emperor you still have to find all the secret yellow crystals to finish the game properly. So don't be put off by those first impressions this is a game you'll be playing for months to come! PAUL Gil. Asce9 First time around, Tarus attacks with fists and rocks. Next time he brings his giant tank mech, Sasquatch Beta. GENERAL MERCO REVIEW RATING Armed with a lance, a shield and his mech, Phoenix Gamma, Merco is a mighty tough customer. What initially looks like Treasure's first duffer turns out to be one of their finest. An excellent old-fashioned platformer with loads of action! "

Let's kick ass and chew bubblegum! 40 100 uke is going for complete world domination. PC owners are currently looking forward to Duke Nukem Forever while Saturn owners have been enjoying a fantastic version of Duke Nukem 3D for the last few months. Now we've got Duke Nukem 64 and Duke Nukem on the PlayStation the original game, minus the \"3D\", plus a load of new levels. And for those of you with friends and lots of money, there's even a two-player link-up mode. Holy cow! I AIN'T AFRAID OF NO QUAKE WEETABIX GOGGLES ACTIVATED The PlayStation version of Duke Nukem is basically a straight port of the PC game. Instead of using a real 3D game engine like the Saturn version it uses a similar \"2.5D\" one, meaning that fancy effects such as real-time lighting aren't possible. All of the levels are the same as they were and all the speech is in, but the game runs very slowly and jerkily when compared to other games like this PlayStation Duke Nukem has all of the levels from the PC game as well as a load of extras. One of the two new episodes is for single-player games while the other is a collection of Dukematch levels, including some all-new ones. The new levels aren't as good as the originals, but are a bit more varied. The first one, for example, looks like the start of Tomb Raider! It'll be interesting to see how id Software react to one of the new Dukematch levels it looks very familiar... Anyone who's played Quake before will recognise this as the first room of the start level! DUKE KUKEN BOLERO E There are some very strange sections to the new levels. And new enemies! DUKE VS DUKE CVG OPINION A split-screen multi-player mode wouldn't have been possible on the PlayStation, so Aardvark have included a link-up mode instead. You need two consoles and two copies of the game, but it's certainly better than nothing. We had quite a few problems when testing it, with connection troubles and so on. Still, at least it's there if you want to try it out. Pons S a EXTRA HARD SUB GAME: MEMORISING THE CONTROLS Saturn Duke Nukem 3D got me right back into the game. It's so fast and smooth that it's a joy to play. PlayStation Duke Nukem is enough to put someone off the game for life. Developers Aardvark have gone for a straight conversion of the PC game with extra levels, which is fair enough. The problem is that their game engine is terrible. Everything moves really slowly and jerks about all the time, and the textures look more blocky than usual. Even the simple gun animations are cut so they look stupid. But the worst thing is the control system. There are three settings, all of which are awful, making the game impossible to play quickly. The PlayStation has got some decent corridor games, including the fantastic Exhumed, so Duke Nukem really isn't worth having. Too jerky and too fiddly to play. And the music.... agh! ED LOMAS 2 2 2 2 2 REVIEW One thing that made Duke Nukem 3D so good to play on the PC was the way that the controls worked. Unfortunately the PlayStation version has an absolutely terrible control system. The default mode doesn't have strafe buttons (to sidestep left and right) so you need to hold a button to move sideways. There are three different settings, one of which is called \"Doomed\" and is based on Doom's controls. Trouble is, looking up and down is essential in Duke CONTROL LAYOUT DOOMED Nukem and it's so fiddly to do here that it's not worth bothering. The controls completely ruin the game. RATING RATING OU SYNE A terrible conversion. The bad graphics and stupid controls 'make it no fun to play at all. 00 O 1 3 a 15 Duke Nukem on PS has terrible dance tunes.  "

This is Duke Nukem 64. 3. KEMUKET fter the astounding Saturn version of Duke Nukem 3D, you'd expect a fantastic Nintendo 64 conversion of the same game. But that's not happened. Instead we've got Duke Nukem 64 an upgraded version of the game featuring new levels, new weapons, new graphics, new speech, and none of the risqué jokes. The story is the same, as Duke is shot down by aliens (\"Scum\" this time, rather than the more offensive word used in other versions) over L.A. and needs to work his way through the city, then figure out how to save the Earth's babes from a fate worse than death! Go Duke time to kick some alien buttock! DUKE NUKEM MUST DIE! NUKE 'EM DUKE CVG OPINION Duke Nukem 64 looks very different to the other versions of the game. All of the weapons have been redesigned and some new ones have been added. Normally at the start of the game there's a hidden rocket launcher, but in Duke 64 it's a new grenade launcher. You can also get double sub machine guns and expander crystals for the shrinker weapon shoot someone and they grow until they explode! There's also a powerful plasma cannon that can be charged up to fire an extra-powerful shot which blinds you for a few seconds! This is the plasma can non. Hold the fire button to built up masses of power. Be careful when using the grenade launcher, as it's easy to kill yourself. UKER ML RIP YOUR HEAD OFF AND... GIVE YOU A NICE FRIENDLY KISS Nintendo don't think that nightclubs are suitable for gamers, so you get a packing yard instead. Captured babes are now covered up and need to be rescued instead of put out of their misery. I really don't understand what's happened with Duke 64. If all the risque stuff had been removed that'd be alright, but everything that was funny has been taken out and the gore has been increased! It's not the funny gore either it's the dead bodies, and they're just plain disgusting now! The graphics are great. The 3D engine is smooth and moves pretty quickly, and the new 3D explosions and bosses look quite good. The new weapons don't really seem to fit in with the rest of the game, and effects like the mirrors have been left out. The control system is good, using both the 3D Stick and the cross-key to keep the game moving quickly. New sections have been added to some of the levels, but they really don't match up to the rest of the game. All the original areas a very cleverly designed giving you something to do in every single room, while still looking like they could be real buildings. The new sections don't fit in with the whole idea that made Duke Nukem 3D such fun. Also the grenade launcher is badly thought out the grenades bounce too quickly and too far, making it too dangerous to use often. Duke Nukem 64 is certainly very good, but little details could have made it much better. CD LOMAS Duke Nukem 3D is known for having a risky sense of humour. Duke swears, goes into some sleazy places and blows enemies into chunks of body parts. Nintendo weren't too happy with many of the things going on in the game and have had a lot of them removed. New speech has been recorded to replace the swearing, new sections of levels replace anything that might offend, and some of the gore has been toned UP! Nintendo seem to think that corpses hanging by hooks through their heads are less offensive than a statue without a top on. The new dead bodies are pretty sick spines poking out of chests, etc. No rude book store for Nintendo owners just a gun store instead. REVIEW FOUR DUKES ARE BETTER THAN ONE RATING Duke Nukem 64 has lots of multi-player options. You can choose either co-operative or deathmatch games, and play with up to three other people at once. If you haven't got enough friends you can add computer-controlled Dukebots to make up the numbers. As well as all the one-player levels there are a few deathmatch-only stages designed especially for Duke Nukem 64. A disappointing translation of such a great game. It's got most of the important elements, only without a sense of humour. @ "

Well you'd better be, because here he is. ach console had a platform star to wow the public last year. Mario and NIGHTS were locked in a fierce battle, while PlayStation's contender was of course Mr. Bandicoot a good game, but up against two of the greatest ever, the marsupial fell unceremoniously flat on his face. That's not to say that the game didn't sell, because it did. So while Mario and NIGHTS take a breather until their inevitable sequels Crash spins back hoping to improve on his last attempt. Though how will he fare against another bunch of challengers, namely Diddy Kong and the return of Sonic? THE NUTTY PROFESSOR You may have tried your hardest in the original game, but there's just no stopping an evil villain. Hence Dr. Neo Cortex is back with a new dastardly scheme, and he's tricked Crash into being a part of his grand plan. Dr. Cortex requires 24 crystals scattered in each of the stages of the game for his new scheme, and Crash has been handpicked to go out and collect them. Will Cortex be thwarted again, and will Crash save the day? It's up to you. VE TORTLE HOODS SNO Alfa ticHT WALK BEFORE YOU CRAWL? 95 Crash is totally bewildered to face a hologram of an aged Tom Guise upon his travels. REVIEW Some new features have made their way into the sequel. Namely Nitro crates and Crash's ability to crawl and slide. Just like in the first game each level is littered with hundreds of crates for Crash to bust open. Bouncy and Standard are the most common, plus the dreaded TNT crates and the rather nice 1UP, which gives you an extra Crash to play with. The new Nitro crate is just like the TNT-style except without the countdown. Touch one of these and it's instant destruction. Crash's new crawl and slide is activated by the circle button. It is very useful for getting through narrow gaps, and sliding into enemies who inhabit such places, especially on the levels that are viewed from the side. It can also be used to simulate interference with baby polar bears. Crash slides under this electric fence while being chased by a snowball. KOMOOD Nitro crates are dangerous, especially when placed on ice. @ The Komodo brothers, a tricky pair of bosses, one spins around and the other throws swords. "


"WINNER TAKES ALL computer video games CRASH BANDICOOT ON ICE Just like the original there are bonus levels to be found, but they play a little differently in the sequel. Now any bonuses you collect in these sections remain unclaimed until you reach the end of the bonus stage. Failure to reach the end means you get nothing, Crash doesn't lose a life, but if you want all those extra lives and apples you have to enter the bonus stage again. PlayStation BONOS To add variation to the formula of entering levels and clearing them of all crates, a hog was intro duced that Crash raced on We thought polar bears in a couple of were supposed to be fierce, levels in the this one's way too cuddly. first game. For the sequel the hog has been replaced by a polar bear. These levels still play exactly the same, except you are now placed in some snowy environments, where the real danger is some icy sections to negotiate. Even more hazardous are the Nitro crates that are left in dangerous positions for you to crash into. In the original there were also levels where Crash rode around on lily pads and jumped on logs. These have now been changed to a jet-ski that Crash surfs down the river, while hopping onto logs and the backs of hippos. If you want to get all the crates on a level, you have to enter the bonus sections. 98 2nd OPINION A slippery eel has discharged into the water, and zapped Crash. IN SPACE NO-ONE CAN HEAR YOU SPIN When the first Crash Bandicoot came out, I found it entertaining, the levels were challenging and Crash himself was mildly rib-tickling. However, it just lifted ideas from other games and lacked any real soul of its own. Crash 2 goes further, by duplicating its own predecessor! Unlike masterpieces like the Sonic series, Crash 2 doesn't refine or build on the first game at all. Nonetheless, I did chuckle at his wacky Bandicoot antics. But not to the extent that I'd buy this game. TOM CASE Look at that, the Jimmy Hill twins! Whereas the last game was set across different islands, each consisting of several stages. Crash 2 is set in a tower, much like Bruce Lee's last film Game of Death. Crash must work his way up the tower. Each floor contains doorways to that level's stages. Complete each stage and step on the lift that is at the centre of the room, to be transported to the next level. Before you enter the next level however you must defeat a boss, each as colourful as the last. The levels are surprisingly similar to those found in the first game, except for levels that see Crash flying through a spacestation strapped to a jet-pack. Here you must apply careful thrust and brakes to avoid the usual pitfalls, including some rather mean lasers that take some perfect timing to negotiate. CVG OPINION . As sequels go, this is deja vu city. I found myself rubbing my eyes in disbelief, and had to quickly play the original game again, just to check this wasn't just the same thing with a big number 2 slapped on it. Upon closer inspection there are some marked improvements over the original. The graphics are bet ter, and even more colourful (if you can believe that). Getting a perfect score on each level now takes a bit more work, and the jet-pack sections do add a bit of variety. The big question is how much did you like the original? If you thought it was the best thing since sliced bread you'll love this. It's more of the same, better designed and perhaps longer lasting.

But he manked up his ligaments, so they got Liverpool's rising young star Michael Owen to do it instead! The end result is completely the opposite to EA's titles, i it's a good game. EA tried the 'celeb doing motion capture' angle with David Ginola, but, frankly, the fat bloke who plays in goal for your local Sunday team could have done the job for the last couple of FIFA games since the end result was crap. Actua Soccer 2 is such an improvement over the original that it's frightening. Everything from the feel of the game, the look and the pace have been bettered and Gremlin now have one of the most playable footie games on any format. Fact. E8 OUT NOW 1-4 PLAYERS While you're waiting to see if Shearer gets fit for the World Cup, hold a home version of the tournament for the Jules Rimet trophy in Actua Soccer 2! actua SOCCER 2 THE FREEKICK SPECIALIST Scoring from free kicks is another excellent way to score goals that even your opponents will recognise as having a pinch of quality to them. Hold down the shoot button and a power bar appears. If you have a free kick just outside the box, letting this run up to full will always result in your shot ballooning over the bar. Aim for three quarters to get the perfect power. Secondly, it's always useful to remember that holding up-right to try and place the ball in the top right corner will p ut loads of backspin on it, after which the ball ends up in row Z! Keep the down right diagonals on the D-Pad held and hitting the target won't be a problem. The same thing applies to penalties, incidentally. 15:52 B12EL ACTUA SOCCER 2 BACK DOOR BACK DOOR! One thing that makes games like ISS Pro and Olympic Soccer so good is the ease with which you can set up chances from crosses, corners and free kicks. In the original, players could cross the ball when a square appeared as the icon underneath them. While the same applies here, the triangle becomes a dedicated cross button which will always go towards a man in the box. Holding square makes the striker on the end of the delivery perform a diving header, volley, overhead kick or whatever shot is applicable. Scoring from these is difficult, but you are guaranteed some good goal-mouth scrambles and panic attacks once you get into those positions. The view for these free kicks stays like this until the ball hits the net... ...or is saved by the goalkeeper. The wall even jumps up to block the shot. STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE 32:11 HEGERI 10 BOLLAND 98 LEEDUMBRO MERO mare ESB The through ball is fast becoming an integral part of soccer video games. It adds loads more goalscoring chances for a start, but also allows for a greater degree of realism when playing. Slipping a ball between defenders isn't as easy to do in Actua 2 as it is in, say, ISS 64, but you can still carve open defences with a well-timed pass. Tapping X is a normal short pass to a team-mate's feet, but if you hold it down for a second or longer, then release it, you unleash the through ball. Even when you do manage to get through to the goalkeeper, beating him is far harder. UMBRO Cresta REVIEW 66 "


"\"HE WAS ON THE NEXT PAGE... computer video games UMERO Barry Davies grabs the mic once again to front the ups and downs of the beautiful game. But he has been joined by his Match of the Day partner-incrime Trevor Brooking. Barry still gives his opinions on the bulk of the game, but after nasty fouls, goals, or half-time intervals, Trev nips in and summarises the play for us. And it is always relevant to what's going on. If you're playing a tricky away match and go in at half time one-nil up, Mr Brooking remarks on how the visitors must be very happy with their performance so far. Cool! PlayStation 12 ROM Aim for the player nearest the keeper, and press X. Hold square, aim for the net and wait for the goal. ISS PRO VS ACTUA SOCCER 2 Finally, a game has come along that can challenge ISS Pro as the king of PlayStation footie games. In fact, in our opinion, Actua 2 has dethroned ISS and rightly wears the crown. Ignore the review scores and listen to the facts: Actua is a much more playable game. It's easier to pick up, and scoring goals is much more realistic in that you can actually picture some of the goals being stuck in the onion bag in real life. The players' Al is very good too, and something which proved difficult in Pro was the through ball. Actua's is far from perfect, but seems easy to pull off. Congrats go to Gremlin then! 16 PETUGALO ERCLGD GAA Just don't use all the hot water OK? ACTUA SOCCER 2 THE PC VERSION CVG OPINION With both versions of Actua out before Christmas, you PC owners may want the lowdown on your version, especially since it's better than the PlayStation title! For a start the PC has a Scenario mode which lets you take over situa tions from classic games. There's also an Editor CROATIAD PARAGUAY EMN to customise teams, etc, plus a multiplayer LAN option (should you have access to that as well). the PC version offers superior graphics, with the close up animation and stadium detail benefiting too. If you're faced with the choice, go for the PC version, as it seems more polished overall. CROATIA O PARAGUAY O 14 MIN TUAH UMBRO Our summary box says why Actua 2 is better than ISS Pro, So I'll tell you why this game is good in it's own right. The whole game engine is a massive improvement over the first it's quicker and has a lot more action. Goalmouth incidents are common, and once you've grasped the basics, goalless games become non-existent. The thing which impresses me the most though is crossing and scoring from corners. You swing a ball over, and a player runs to get on the end of it, before unleashing awesome volleys. They're not guaranteed to score, but they look cool. There are a couple of flaws, though. The offside rule is very strange and doesn't play as in real life (a player can still be offside when he's received a ball, even if, when the ball was played he was onside very frustrating). Some of the tackling seems to be a bit weird too, as taking people out from behind often goes unpunished. Still, Actua Soccer 2 is very cool, and well worth getting if you want an ISS Pro beater. STEVE tebe GAME PAUSED The players in the PC game are more detailed and the animation is smoother. Spot the ball! Send your answers to the usual address, on a ticket to the World Cup. CROATIA O PARAGUAYO 29 MN LIHIZI Wir REVIEW RATING DEAN MONROE STRUWAY Improves a hundred per cent on the original.

Hold tight! Annama BUGGY G lhe trouble with motorsport today is it's all rules, rules, rules. No speeding in the pit lane. No ramming the competition off the road. No Uzis. Extreme-G puts the danger back into racing in a futuristic setting. Eight riderless bikes (driven, in true Cyberpunk fashion, by the brain impulses of spectators) go head-to-head on a collection of outlandish extra-terrestrial circuits. Each bike is equipped with a laser cannon, a nitro-booster (good for three uses) and an engine that can take it to rocket speeds. To make things more interesting, there are especially devastating weapons to collect along the way. So if speed and skilled driving aren't enough to get you to the front, perhaps a well-aimed rocket will be! 6002 1-48-15 1-25-48 UDE THE LONE BIKER OF THE APOCALYPSE There are four options for the solo player in Extreme-G. The main action is in the Extreme Tournament in which you race three increasingly difficult competitions at three increasingly difficult skill levels. As you go through the circuits in this mode they become available in the other game modes. Choose Practice and you can drive a friendly' race on any available track. Time Trial, as the name suggests, pits you against the clock as you attempt to smash the best recorded lap and race times. The fourth game mode is Shoot 'Em Up, in which you pick a track then race around it behind a bunch of target drones, blasting as many of them as possible during the course of three laps. A bit unusual, but then Extreme-G is almost as much about blasting as it is about racing. in 8-21:46 ROLLER COASTER E RIDES 8-85-26 ULE V RECORD SCORE (16 kills) Enter Player 11 lane REVIEW There are a total of twelve circuits in Extreme G, but the only way to see them all is to complete the Extreme Tournament at Meltdown level. It's worth the effort, because Extreme G contains some of the most amazing circuits you'll see in any racing game. It starts off sedately enough, with the bog-standard desert tracks, then moves on to more industrial settings before heading into Mad-Dog Fantasy Land. As you progress you notice new things being added to the circuits: pipes (drive up the walls and over the top), alternate routes, loop the loops, vertical straights and finally, gravity-defying roadways that head one way, then double back so you're driving back the way you came UPSIDE DOWN! These roller-coaster rides account for a lot of the thrills in Extreme G. Our advice is to play the game on as big a screen as possible. And if you're prone to motion sickness keep a bucket handy.

"BIKER RIOT! computer video games HE $1748 All the bikes come with a laser fitted as standard. Some are better than others, but they're of little consequence because for the most part you'll be using the one-shot weapons that you pick up as you go. As in WipEout, these spring from certain points of the track in the form of icons. Drive through them and the weapons drop from the sky, either mounted on a saddle that sits over the bike, or on a truck that follows 18 93 it. There are four basic varieties, HEN as follows...

DEFENCE There are two shields avail. able, one that makes you impervious to weapons, and another that repels other bikes, allowing you to barge through the pack. MISSILES You can get explosive rockets that fire forward or backwards, homing, in threes, four or packs of five which fire one at a time or all at once. MINES Proximity mines are most common, but you also get laser limpet mines which explode when a bike breaks the beam between them. SPECIALS Tractor beams that drag back your rivals, white-out flares, and flame exhausts all become available by the time you get to the more advanced races. 1-81-56 TETE 8-39-88 WEB Even on the hardest level, Extreme G isn't that difficult to beat, but to keep the thrills going you get a password whenever you win a tour nament. These earn you a more advanced bike, or activate crazy features. One of these is a fish-eye lens effect which exaggerates the perspective, making it look like you're going even faster than you are. Another transforms the bikes into boulders (a bit crap really), while another turns all of the tracks upside down and reverses the controls. The best we've seen is the infinite-nitros mode which gradually activates the fish-eye mode as you accelerate, giving a cool warp-speed effect! 9awana 45 Roach Better call in Rentokill. Tracks set in Satan's bowel! Look at those curves coming up. GEL 8:58:56 DLE FUN WITH MOTORCYCLE GANGS CVG OPINION 175 Extreme-G's multiplayer options are extensive, and we were pleased to see that they could all handle up to four players in the now standard quarter-screen format. There's the usual Head-To-Head race as well as a Cup Challenge in which up to 16 players compete in a knockout tournament, racing two at a time. The Flag Race is a witty variation on the Head-To-Head, in which the winner is the one who drives through the most flags on the track, rather than the one who finishes first. Lastand least exciting is the Battle Arena, a last-man-standing shoot-out which takes place in one of four tiered arenas. While this worked wonderfully in Mario Kart 64. Extreme-G's super-fast bikes don't handle well in such confined spaces and getting another bike in your sights is a frustrating process. 1 discovered it was a big mistake to approach Extreme-G expecting an N64 version of WipEout. WipEout is a real racing game. Extreme-G's entertainment experience breaks down into 20% racing, 20% blasting and 60% Wow-That-LooksAmazing!. In Extreme-G you don't worry about learning to control your bike because you just bounce through the corners, leaving you to concentrate on blasting your way through the opposition. It's not bad, but it's shallow. Having said that, by the time you get to the super-fast, mega-twisty, cool-looking circuits on the Extreme level you don't care because you're getting such a buzz off the speed and the awesome visuals. My reviewer's common sense is telling me not to be fooled by the pretty graphics, but there's no denying that once you get into Extreme-G it is really good fun. To me that's how games are supposed to be. PAUL Gil Ace9 Clearly modern motorcycle sport has some way to go before we see races set on tracks like this. REVIEW Pomara Coc RATING A real tart of a game all looks and hardly any brains. A great ride though. Extreme-G isn't WipEout on N64, it's something very different. "

SEGA TOURING CAR GRAND PRIX While Sega's arcade divisions have spoilt us rotten in the past, the first half of 1996's titles were not the best they've produced. Unfortunately for Saturn owners, we're only now seeing the end result of this poor period. This year's Saturn arcade conversions have offered us nothing new, and nothing that is better than the games we've already got. I can understand the reasons behind converting a hit game across to a console, but a poor game and the feeling is \"why bother?\" There were great expectations from many that Touring Car would finally prove to be a Rally beater, but I'm afraid that couldn't be further from the truth. The effort has been made in the Saturn extras department, but the game itself is really disappointing. Every cloud has a silver lining, and judging from this year's arcade titles, next year should be very good indeed. ALEX 4WTAA REVIEW Another new feature is the option to drive longer races. A good idea, since the arcade races are often over far too quickly. In this new grand Prix mode, you'll have to pay attention to damage inflicted on your car and tyre wear. Should your performance drop because of the extra burden placed on your motor, you'll have to make full use of the pit.

And we're not talking Star Wars THE CURSE OF here. The Secret of Monkey Island was called \"the best game ever\" by many until the release of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, which took the title away from it. So it's no surprise to find that the third game in such a highlyregarded series is in such demand already. The Curse Of Monkey Island follows the hero of the series failed pirate Guybrush Threepwood on his crusade to win back Elaine Marley, the love of his life. Normally that wouldn't be too much of a problem, but this is a Monkey Island game, remember. TM Tri The said AAR, IT BE DEAD SIMPLE TO PLAY, AN' RIGHTLY SO ONKEY The game interface has been simplified from the first two Monkey Island games, making it less annoying to play. Previously you had a selection of actions in the bar at the bottom of the screen which you selected along with items to make an action sentence. Now it's a lot simpler, with an interface more like Lucasarts' other recent graphic adventures. I'S BEEN HEARIN' STORIES..... 3. PIECE OF EIGHT THE CURSE As you move the regular mouse pointer around the screen it changes red to indicate items that can be used. Pressing and holding the left mouse button brings up a gold coin with three actions on it. The hand lets Guybrush pick things up, use, take, push, open them and so on. The eyes on the skull in the middle are for examining and reading things, and the parrot head is for talking. eating, and even blowing things. The fantastic hand-drawn introduction sequence begins with our hero, Guybrush Threepwood the young pirate that we led to stardom in the previous two games, floating lost at sea in a dodgem. Play Monkey Island 2 if you want to know why. Just as he's giving up all hope of surviving he drifts right into the middle of a battle, which coincidentally involves the evil undead pirate LeChuck attacking Governor Elaine Marley's fort on Plunder Island! Naturally, LeChuck isn't happy about Guybrush killing him twice and locks him up in the hold of the boat. Your first task is to escape from LeChuck's boat and save Elaine before the zombie pirate can steal her away forever! DEAD MAN'S CHEST REVIEW Pressing the right mouse button at any time brings up a big wooden chest containing all the items you're currently carrying.

The hand-drawn backgrounds and characters are easily good enough to feature in a proper animated movie, and the amount of detail is truly astounding. The in-game characters look identical to those in the video sequences, making the whole thing blend together perfectly. The cut-scenes are magnificently drawn and really show off the amount of character that everyone in the game has. There are also some great 3D rendered models which blend into the cutscenes just right. ROM THERE BE LOADS TO DO IN THIS 'ERE GAME At the tots.

As well as the usual point and click sections of other graphic adventures, The Curse Of Monkey Island also has the occasional alternate section to break things up a bit. The biggest of these sections is Chapter Three out of the five in the game. Once you've assembled a crew (and managed to stop them singing sea shanties!) it's off to do battle with the evil Captain Rottingham. Your map shows the location of nearby ships, and getting right next to them takes you into battle mode. Use the wind to get next to the enemy ship, shoot them with your cannons and get on board! Here you must swordfight with the captain using clever rhyming insults and retorts which you need to learn on the way.

Some are carried across to the third game, making cameo appearances that fans will especially appreciate. One new character who appears right at the start is Murray an evil talking skull who has recently lost the rest of his body (it was your fault). Every now and then he turns up with another fiendish scam to take over the world which is obviously not going to work because of his lack of body. D'oh! The mad owner of the fried chicken shop on Plunder Island is another favourite. Aaaah. Monkey Island. Brings back memories of swapping 13 Amiga disks backwards and forwards for months on end. The first two games are magnificent and even though the original creator, Ron Gilbert, wasn't involved in the third, it's still fantastic! The graphics are certainly some of the best 2D we've ever seen, with amazing hand-drawn animation for all of the excellent characters. The sound is particularly brilliant as well, with Lucasarts' IMUSE music which changes as you play something noticeably lacking from Jedi Knight. The sense of humour is as great as ever, with tons of little details that prove the dedication of the designers. And the game is bigger than most other adventure games, with five sections which get bigger as you go on. Each of the sections has different objectives, locations and even little sub-games to keep your interest up. There are masses of fans of the series like me who will go crazy for The Curse of Monkey Island, but it's not essential to have played the other games to be able to get into this one.

Now, in a fraction of a replicant's lifespan, comes the review. BLADE RUNNER A NEW LIFE AWAITS YOU... Ihree years in the making Blade Runner has finally arrived. Though the word 'finally' may be inappropriate. Until this Summer nobody knew the brains behind Command & Conquer were working on a top secret game that would revisit a classic movie from 1982. If we'd known about the game back at its inception, the anticipation would surely have been too much. As it's happened, the announcement of Blade Runner has been one of the best surprises of the year. The finished game plays like a sequel to the movie. With all the familiar scenes, and characters being revisited. All that you need to play it is a monster PC and plenty of popcorn. Los Angeles 2019. You are Ray McCoy, Blade Runner, assigned to hunt down illegal replicants (androids that are prohibited from Earth). You have orders to shoot to kill any replicants. This is not called murder, it is called retirement. Your first job is to investigate a vicious case of animal murder. Real animals are a rare luxury, replicants may be involved. WAKE UP. TIME TO DIE BLADE RUNNER Perhaps the strongest part of the game is its feeling for the original film. The designers have got the look, and sounds spot on. The familiar Vangelis music plays at key moments. You get the same opening sequence, except here it's all done with rendered graphics, and even cast members from the film have returned to provide voices. Much like the movie Back to the Future 2 where Marty McFly returned to events that we'd witnessed in the original film, the same happens in Blade Runner the game. It's set at the same time as the movie, so you'll even bump into Leon and Rachel, Chew and JF Sebastian, all voiced by the original actors. Westwood also contacted Syd Mead who contributed much to the look of the film, and provided designs for the game. Try out this target range before heading into the streets for real, in the game that is! EYES. JUST DO EYES The look of Blade Runner is simply astounding. The designers have used a similar approach to that which Squaresoft used in Final Fantasy VII. Renders, fullmotion video and a large amount of polygons have all been mixed together to give the game a definitive look. Rain and lighting effects are then added, as well as moving parts to backgrounds. The police spinner (flying car) is used to get around the town. When the spinner arrives at a location the camera' moves around as if this were a real film. This feeling for the film and even the novel it was based on pops up again and again while you're playing. The end result is hard to criticise. The ESPER finds more clues. This guy's thespian delivery is very funny. REVIEW zo SUV Is she a replicant? The map from your spinner. Chew is a tough cookie to question, but if you tell him he's in danger, he'll soften up.  "


"computer YOU KNOW WHATA ORTOISE IS? games ROM As in the film, there are a number of machines to help search for clues and detect replicants. The Voigt-Kampf is a machine which measures emotional responses to tricky questions. All Replicants are planted with false emotions, so the VK is like an emotional lie detector. The ESPER (don't ask us what it stands for) is a photograph analyser, that allows you to search pictures for clues. It is possible to zoom in on images and also to pan around them. Often the clues will be hidden behind other objects, or you may just want a better view of a suspect. KIA is short for Knowledge Integration Assistant. Basically this is a computer where all your clues are stored and arranged. Not only information that McCoy has found, but all other Blade Runners. By downloading information from the mainframe at police HQ, you can pick up clues you may have missed. Eh? It's the batcave! TOO BAD SHE WON'T LIVE... McCoy goes sniffing around for clues. There are over 70 characters in the game. All of them have their own Artificial Intelligence (AI). Questioning certain characters triggers off events later in the game and at specific moments the story can split into many different paths. Failure to retire a replicant in one scene will result in an encounter with the replicant later. In the meantime though, that replicant may pass on information to other characters in the game. Because of this Al, it is actually possible to trick replicants. In one game we played, McCoy killed several humans, tricking the reps into thinking McCoy was on their side. Then we went and retired the replicants as well. BLADE RUNNER CVG OPINION Westwood have done the unthinkable. To take one of the best films ever made and turn it into a game that is worthy of the title is no small feat. However, their obvious love for the movie may have harmed this 'game' in a way. It seems that Blade Runner may have been too big a license to tackle and what we are left with is more a companion to the movie than a game. The result is mesmerising and immersive. Once the game is finished however, you are left yearning for more. Not in terms of story, this is the game's strongest part. But, the gameplay is little more than asking questions, in the right place, at the right time. Throw in the occasional shoot-out and that's the game. The fact that it's all over (bar different twists, replicants and endings) in the first day is a shame. I still love this game, but I can't say \"you must get this', as I know many will feel let down. Westwood may have come up against too big a mountain with the license, but I can't think of anybody who could have done a better job. ALEX TALA McCoy does his best Columbo impres sion while with this potential replicant. REVIEW RATING Now he's tied up with a gun to his head. Whatever next? You'll be both impressed and disappointed in that order. An amazing display of graphics, story telling and use of the license, but way too short.  "


"computer games NINTENDO 64 NINTENDO 3D FIGHTING GAME 6 5 MACE: THE DARK AGE DEC RELEASE BY ATARI 1-2 PLAYERS he Nintendo 64 has a 100% disappointment rate with fighting games so far. Not one of the fair number that have been released is good enough to be worth buying (except maybe killer Instinct Gold) so no-one's really expecting anything from Mace. It's got a great selection of characters a Viking, an executioner, a samurai, a skeleton, a knight, something that looks like the big bug from Men in Black... and a hidden chicken. It uses similar controls to Soul Blade, only with Away on the d-pad being used to block. Some cool combos can be worked out if you put in the effort, but the game itself just isn't balanced enough to be worth getting right into. Mace is very pretty-looking and can be fun, but you'd be much better off renting than buying.

As such it has loads of new vehicles, structures and tactics to go with it. This conversion of last year's PC game is practically spot-on in terms of graphics, with the added bonus of translucent menus and explosions. The PlayStation game even features extra levels not in the original PC release, as with the first C&C. A link-up two-player mode and PlayStation mouse support are now available. If you haven't got .

BATTLE GAME ROFESSOR Shaker Pod Dropped PlayStation CRITICAL DEPTH DEC RELEASE 12330 gts BY SINGLETRAC 1-2 PLAYERS he easiest way to describe this game is as Twisted Metal with submarines. The idea in the main game is to collect a set number of pods, then go to the exit. Thing is, the other characters are trying to do the same. Shooting someone enough times makes them drop the pods they are carrying, ready for you to pick them up. You choose your character from a wacky selection, ranging from the CIA in their futuristic stealth submarine to something that looks like the robotic fish from Stingray. The full-3D movement is good fun, as you can swim straight up and jump out of the water, then dive down on top of battling enemies below. The most annoying thing when playing the computer is that as soon as you collect a pod they're onto you, chasing you to the end while battering you with shots. The game is pretty ropey overall, but has some highlights including the two-player mode.

Wrong. For once, a movie tie in comes along that doesn't have characters running through a scrolling city beating everyone up. Instead, Men in Black goes for a Resident Evil style style affair, and manages to pull it off quite successfully. The backdrops are very well done indeed and don't require any flash 3D cards. The animation suffers a little however (the characters walk like they need the toilet), but you do get used to it. You track through the streets of New York, before being entered into the world of the Men in Black, and the game really starts. Over 200 locations are there to explore, loads of puzzles to solve and a rock hard difficulty setting, which can also be frustrating. It's a very smart movie tie-in and one I can recommend.

Yes, what's the point of a beat 'em up set in a free roaming 3D environment if the game suffers from poor controls and a dodgy combat system? Both available characters offer nothing radically different, as you roam the Victorian streets in search of the demons of the night.

"computer Video games PlayStation ROM TOMB RAIDER I per fer una pis PLAYERS GUIDE If you thought finding The Lost Valley, lead bars and fuses in the first Tomb Raider was tricky, this guide is for you. ore have made Tomb Raider 2 much more challenging than its predecessor. To help you battle Mr Bartolli and his henchmen; find artifacts, forever lost burial sites, and shipwrecks, read on. If you've practiced the Assault Course in Lara's garden, you're already familiar with some of Lara's new techniques. During the game you discover even more. Here's a recount of them all. NEW MOVES TOMB RAIDER II When fighting the enemies, the roll button (0) becomes very useful, as the enemies can't get a lock on Lara and she can be in a better position to shoot them. The roll button is great when Lara is doing certain difficult jumps too: if you press circle just after the jump, she turns mid-air. Some rooms in the game will have spikes or broken glass on the floor, Lara can get through it if you hold the walk button. Climbing ladders a technique Lara uses a lot is simple, but dismounting can become tricky as you won't always be able to go up or sideways. While holding onto a ladder Lara can do a back flip to get onto a platform behind her. SAVING THE GAME PLAYERS GUIDE It's advisable to save the game regularly, after you've killed a couple of enemies or completed a series of difficult jumps for example This way you'll also save your health, as you don't get many medical packs on later levels. Climbing onto slopes, then jumping forwards or backwards while you slide is another technique you'll find very useful. DRIVING Once Lara arrives in Venice, she gets a speedboat. Driving it is pretty easy, the important thing to remember is how to get out of the vehicles quickly, which is done by pressing square and left or right. On a later level there is a snow bike. Driving it is the same as the boat, but you have to be pretty careful not to crash too often, because Lara loses health. With both vehicles you have to watch out when you jump over objects or gaps, as they are likely to explode if dropping from a height. 3 "


"WEAPONS THE LOST WORLD TWO computer Video games The first level The Great Wall, is very short, but it does contain a very cool secret! Get to the Cave from which you descend a long way down, on a zip line, but before you do that, turn around and face away from the edge of the cliff. Jump back and hold onto the edge. PlayStation As in the first game, you start with a pair of pistols and a shotgun. You also get a box of flares, which prove useful as there are lots of dark places Lara visits. Your arsenal builds up fairly early in the game automatic pistols, Uzi's, and a Grenade Launcher. However you lose everything at the start of level five when you find yourself imprisoned on the Offshore Rig. Don't despair you get to pick up the rest of your old weapons plus a harpoon on the same level. The amazing M16's can be found on the Wreck of Maria Doria, and there's a Grenade launchher on The Deck ROM 4 LARA'S HEALTH Some of Bartolli's men leave a gift when you kill them, either medical packs or ammo. As the levels get more difficult, the henchmen get tougher, and you need to use a lot of med packs to recover after encounters with them. You have to be cautious on later levels, as you won't get as many medical packs. Sometimes you'll find a med pack in an empty room, with no sign of danger. Chances are you'll have to use it immediately because you never know what lurks around the next corner! There are also a few devious sections where the only way for Lara to progress is by falling from a great height. Lara will only survive if her health bar is full. (1). Slowly manoeuvre to the far left then drop down. Just above you there is a crack, you can grab it and shimmy until you have enough space to climb up (2). Go to the end of the room, then down the ladder (3). You will end up at the bottom of the cave. By the way, there is a T-Rex waiting for you (4)! The secret can be found at the far end of the opening (5). But once you collect it, there's another surprise outside... VENICE: THE BOAT Once you get the boat and successfully navigate through a maze of underwater canals, you find your selves in a similar maze, only above the water. What you have to do is open a couple of gates and explode some underwater mines in order to get through the main gate. The main gate stays open only for a limited period of time and by opening side gates and exploding mines you are creating a shortRAIDERII TOMB aut SECRETS Each level has three secrets, in the form of small green, orange and white idols. Only when you have all three on the same level will you get more ammo and/or medical packs. Not being able to reach the green idol on The Great Wall level (it's tricky!) probably made you wonder if you'd just missed a key to the next part of the game. Well, yes but it was 'only' a secret.

All you have to do is move some boxes about to create the quickest way out for Lara (1) the door is again timed. When you get out, an alarm sounds and some goons will start to chase Lara. Unfortunately you have no weapons, so the only thing to do is to escape into the water. PlayStation ROM 5 Be careful not to be pulled into the giant fan (2), but you'll need to pass this obstacle to progress. Next thing to do is to climb inside the the plane to retrieve your confiscated pistols (3). Before you can get to them, though, you need to switch off the engines (4), then jump and grab the wing above the right propeller (5 and 6). From here walk along the top of the plane and you'll fall through to the room where your trusty shooters have been stashed. OFFSHORE RIG THE DIVING PLATFORM INOL RAIDERII Some enemies you encounter on this level leave colour-coded passes to open doors. Obtaining the green pass is a little more difficult than the rest. It involves finding and crossing this big square Toom with water on the bottom and gantries close to the ceiling without getting killed. Here's how to do it. If you look into the water below you, you'll notice two divers. Lara can get a lock on them without getting into the water. Once you dispose of the divers dive into the water, swim to the nearest platform to the right (2) to get a secret (be careful, the henchmen will try to shoot you as soon as you're out of the water). Now swim to the top left corner of the room where you'll see a ladder (3). From here you can climb up to the gantries. Jump across to the other side of the room (4) where you'll see a passage (5). Leave it for now and head the other way (6) to get the green pass behind the glass (7) first. Now go back to the passage. LO 40 FATHOMS PLAYERS GUIDE In the middle of the ocean with no way of getting up to the surface? No problem. Swim to the left of the small yellow submersible, then forward until you see the remains of an old ship (1) (you might find lighting a flare useful at this point). There are two sharks in the water with you, but you can worry about them later, first you need to get some air. Follow the wrecked hull of the ship to the left until you see the anchor (2). Above it is the way inside. As soon as you get some air, the sharks come after you, so be ready with your harpoon gun you should have enough harpoons to get rid of all of them. Proceed into the second underwater chamber and find an entrance to the third on your top left (3). The fourth chamber will have a switch on the bottom left corner which opens a hatch. From there you'll be able to get air again. DIVING AREA 1 When you've killed the two dogs, and four of Bartolli's henchmen, here's what you need to do next. Jump to the platform in the middle of the room which contains the giant, moving hook (1). Jump from the edge and grab onto the side of the middle platform (2). Then you can climb up and you won't get hurt (3). Now you need to do a running jump onto the next plat. form (4), then grab it and clamber up it in the same way. Then do a running jump to the other side of the room. 82 "


"1 computer video games 40 FATHOMS THE DOOR BEHIND THE FLAMES PlayStation Your timing needs to be perfect here, and you have to move fast. As you enter the long corridor you will see a switch to your left (1), it opens a door to a secret (3). You will have to run to the end of the corridor and turn left, and jump across the low beams to get to it (2). ROM Now you're in the water with the sharks again! So long as you change direction while you're swimming, you'll be all right. After you get the secret, go back to the long corridor and turn left. This bit is quite dark, so you might need to light a flare to see the ladder. Climb it and you're inside a room with a switch (4). SNOWMOBILE JUMPING The snowmobile is a real pain to get to. More likely than not, you'll end up in the water after desperately trying to get across the ravine that stands in your way(1). The switch opens another room at the far right of the map, where you find another switch (5). This one will extinguish the first two flames so you can get to the switch (6). Now you have to hurry as the flames reappear in a short while. This switch will open the room next to the secret door. The switch in that room (7) will extinguish the other two flames, but only for a short while. From here run to switch the first two flames off (5) again, then head straight to the final door (8). Save the game before you do this bit, because you might need to practise it first. The give-away in this case is the medical pack nicely resting on a rock just above the water (2). Get to it and from there all you need to do is go up (3). You will end up in front of the snowmobile and some very tough enemies. Again that medical pack was a warning of certain injury just around the corner. LARA EXITS HERE 5 RAIDER II SECRETY LARA ENTERS HERE SHARKS! tec 17 PLAYERS GUIDE WE'LL REVEAL A LOT MORE Like the first game Tomb Raider 2 is massive. So much so, that you may need a bit more help. We didn't want to give everything away in just one issue, 'cos we know how annoying that can be. This guide was intended to get you on your way. Should you have any more difficulties along the journey, then please write to us, telling us your problems, and we'll bring you another guide soon. Once you're on the snowmobile, you'll very soon come to a dead end (4) so you have to dismount and remove the two big bricks blocking your way (5). Then you just have to rev up and jump the snowmobile through the clearing (you can do the rest of the journey on foot, but the snowmobile does make it more fun). The only way to do this is to drive carefully around the room (6) and get enough speed to carry you over (7). 83 "


"computer video games SELECT CHARACTER 1 SONIC R SAT PEOR SUPERSONIC RACE GUIDE Find the hidden features and Chaos Emeralds with our full-on guide to the hyper-hedgehog's racer! GOLD CUPS GOLD COINS CHAOS EMERALDS You get a Gold Cup next to the name of a course once you've got first place on it. Get cups on the first four courses to open up the final Radiant Emerald course and be able to play as Dr Ivo Robotnik. There are five Gold Coins on each of the first four courses. If you can collect all five then go on to finish in first, second or third in a race you'll get challenged by a secret character. If you beat the secret character in a three-lap race without any of the usual power-ups (all the shortcuts are open from the start in these races) you'll be able to play as them from then on. Once you've collected a hidden character, they'll often replace their original counterpart in future Gold Coin races, making it harder than usual. Make sure you do the course you find hardest first, and the easiest one last. CNCRALUD There is one Chaos Emerald on the first course, and two on each of the next three. You need to collect an Emerald during a race, then go on to come in first place in order to keep it. Collect all seven to gain access to Super Sonic and get different music on the extra track. It's possible to collect both Emeralds in one race and keep them if you're good enough. (EXT. DATA 1 2 AB Y DINOS RESORT ISLAND A simple enough course made fairly tough by the water surrounding the whole thing. Using either the flying characters or Sonic's doublejumps it's possible to shortcut across most of the water, which can save large amounts of time. COIN 1 Run up the grey rock face at the first bend, then go onto the roof over the track. Don't turn too early or you'll fall through the scenery. COIN 2 After the corner with the rock roof (with Coin 1 on it) turn off to the left and run through the cave behind the waterfall. The coin is at the end. 50 22 PLAYERS GUIDE COIN 3 Following the path after Coin 2 you reach a door requiring 20 rings to open. Go through it and the coin is sitting in the middle of the cave. 02/5 COIN 4 At the tightest corner on the course, run straight off and onto the series of islands in the water. The coin is on the island at the far left. COIN 5 After the speed-up you reach a split in the course. Take the left route up the hill and the coin is in the middle of the track. PREPARE TO CHALLENGE. MECHA-SONICI BLUE CHAOS EMERALD Robotnik's evil metallic version of our hero isn't all that tough to beat. He collects lots of rings and always uses them on the speed-up at the end of the track to whizz around the last few bends. Master the shortcut through the trees before the final loop as this saves lots of time, and use Sonic to double jump across the water for the first two main corners. Mecha-Sonic is strangely one of the toughest hidden characters to beat, so don't worry if it takes a few goes. The first Emerald in the game can be found in the second locked cave. You need 50 rings to open the door, but if you avoid the speed-up toward the end of the lap you should be able to save enough up for the second time around. * "


"computer Video games RADICAL CITY It's not possible to fall off the track in Radical City in most places, but if you make a mistake you could easily end up getting lost in the middle section. The coins and Emeralds are mostly out of the way of the race, so learning their locations is quite important. 33:21.02 3 50 COIN 1 Follow the course around the from the start and as the track splits off to the left, drop down to the lower level (not the left-hand piece of track). The coin is right against the wall behind you. If you do this on the second or third lap, you should have enough rings to be able to run through the 20 ring door to get the Green Emerald straight after. COIN 2 From the first split in the track, take the left-hand road, making sure that you don't fall off the track towards Coin 1. Keep to the main path all the way without taking any of the shortcuts and you'll come to the Gold Coin in the middle of the track as you go under a flyover. COIN 3 Take the lefthand route from the first split in the track and follow it around until you see a barrier on the edge of a righthand bend. Jump through the barrier and you'll land on a ledge with lots of rings and a Gold Coin. If you fall off the far side of the ledge, you can turn around and jump back up when playing as Sonic. 20 RINGS 1:31.28 COIN 4 If you follow the main track all the way around from the start you'll find a barrier on the right of the track. Jump through it and you'll fall down onto a giant picture of Sonic which is covered in bumpers. In the middle is a Gold Coin. Run through to the far side of the Sonic picture and you'll come out by the giant fruit machine. COIN 5 Not long before the end of the course is a 20 ring door on the right of the track. Get enough rings to open it and there's a Gold Coin waiting right on the other side of it. Slow down through the door as you don't want to miss it. The track is shorter this way but you don't get to use the speed-up on the main part of the course. 2/5 PREPARE TO CHALLENGE... MECHA-TALSI GREEN CHAOS EMERALD PINK CHAOS EMERALD Mecha-Tails is probably the worst character in the game. If you've managed to get all five Gold Coins you shouldn't have any trouble at all beating him in the one-on-one race. Remember that the ring doors are open and it'll be a doddle, even though you'll never want to race as MechaTails himself. At the first split in the track, drop off to the This is easy enough as long as you've left as with Coin 1 and run straight ahead to got enough rings. Following the main reach a 20 ring door. Open it to find the Green track around, you'll reach a 50 ring door Chaos Emerald. Instead of carrying on, turning on the left before you reach the section left and rejoining the track with the giant fruit back near the start, it's machine. Go through quicker to turn around and it and the Emerald is go back out through the in the middle of the ring door. Turn left from track just after the here to get back on the bend. track at a later point. SONIC R REGAL RUIN One of the more confusing tracks because of the large number of steps and water sections. It takes a few goes to get used to the layout of the course, but whatever way you go you'll need to make lots of sharp turns. Also, you NEED a character who can jump. RINGS 00:12.52 AIMESSI 01:41.96 20 PLAYERS GUIDE @D/S COIN 1 From the start of the COIN 2 If you take the normal course, run up the ramp to the left of route from the start line and turn the first straight. Simply follow the right at the first wall, you'll end up line of rings and collect the Gold facing a medium-sized hill. Run to Coin at the top. From here you need the top of the hill for a Gold Coin. to jump off to the right unless you have over 50 rings to open the door. COIN 3 After the first few bends you'll reach a steep ramp which leads up to the main section of the course. Instead of going up it, run to the left and jump on the spring right next to it. The Gold Coin is in the air above the spring. 85 REGAL RUIN CONTINUED OVERLEAF "

MECHA-ROBOTNIKI 01:04.76 FINGS 38 03:07.24 ca SATURN COIN 4 After the down slope where you turn back and forwards on yourself, turn around and go down the hidden passageway next to the barriers. At the end, turn right up the slope to find a Gold Coin. Make sure you learn the course well before taking on Mecha-Robotnik. He knows the shortcuts and uses them all the time. If you make more than two mistakes you're likely to be beaten. From the start/finish line, go up the left-hand path as if you were collecting Coin 1. Run past it and open the 50 ring door to find a small pyramid containing the Emerald. Be careful not to fall off the ledge and you can jump along the pillars to save more time when rejoining the main course.

After travelling under the bridge, turn left and go up the ramp to get the Following the major route through the course, go through the 20 ring door instead of turning right along the backwards/ forwards slope. Jump up the steps, collect the Emerald, then run down the side and around the loops to rejoin the track. Coin. REACTIVE FACTORY Another track which can be extremely confusing when you don't know it very well. There are lots of routes through the course, many of which are pretty much useless, so stick to the ones that you know work. 50 SONIC R 50 COIN 1 From the start of the race, head straight off the first corner through the cones. Turn right at the end of the path and jump or float (depending on your choice of character) over the water onto the top of the submarine to get the Coin. COIN 2 As the first straight goes to the right, look for a small barrier with arrows on it at the right edge of the track. Turn off here and jump or float over the water to find a Gold Coin. Go round the back of the pillar and inside to get back onto the track. COIN 3 Just as you reach the start of the main flyover (with the magnetic section at the top) turn off to the right. You really need to slow down to make the turning, but there's a Gold Coin down the path. From here you can quite easily go to Coin 4.

As you get to the open area, skid around to the left and you should be able to see the Gold Coin by a big pillar. Get the Coin and rings and carry on around the pillar to save time. COIN 5 Take the main route around the course (don't turn right to collect Coin 3) so that you go over the big flyover that leads to the end. Just after the section that magnetises you is a 20 ring door which leads to a small room with a Gold Coin in it. 2/5 PLAYERS GUIDE PREPARE TO CHALLENGE.. MECHA-KNUCKLESI PINK CHAOS EMERALD WHITE CHAOS EMERALD Mecha-Knuckles is a cool character to play as, but he's not as tough to beat as he may seem. If you take some of the shortcuts and don't make any big mistakes you should be able to stay ahead of him without too much trouble. Sonic is the best character for this course. Immediately after the loop, and just before the big banked right-hand corner, you must turn sharply to the right. Go through the 50 ring door and the Pink Emerald with be fired out of the pipe so that it lands just in front of you. After the big banked right-hander, turn left so that you run off the track next to the speed-up arrow. Go along next to the water and go through the 50 ring door from the left side.

"computer video games 57 Til 273 7 01:15:21 DIDDYKONG NINTENDO GUIDE Rare's 'proper Mario Kart game will no doubt be filling many a stocking over the festive season, and with this CVG Guide To DKR Mastery you'll be able wipe the floor with your least favourite cousin when he turns up to challenge you on Boxing Day. THOSE EXTRA BALLOONS X 36 DIDDY KONG RACING As well as getting balloons for finishing the levels, there are a couple hidden in the main map screen as well. If you find yourself short by a single number, have a Scout around outside for the four extra ones that you need. The most hidden ones are shown here, and the other two are really obvious so you don't need guidance for those. Now, let us begin... GENERAL TIPS There are a few important little pointers that could make the difference between first and second place. SPEED BOOSTS You don't get the full effect from a boost if you have your finger on the accelerator when you activate it. You can tell whether you've got maximum acceleration by the colour of the smoke that spews forth from the back of your vehicle. Balloon-enhanced boosts give a blue plume and ground based kicks are green when they are used at full power. These tricks are best for use against the bosses, as they give you that extra little boost needed to cross the finish line first. SKIDDING The normal skid may not be sharp enough for you to take corners at the tightest angles, so using the brake mid-skid is a useful way of cutting down recovery times. Whichever way you're sliding, the back end of the vehicle will swing out in that direction while the front locks up. Holding the brake for too long will cause you to spin out, and lose you valuable time. Using the brake like this can be used to hit speed-boosts on the track, and reach tricky silver coins. STORING POWER UPS Keeping hold of certain power-ups is a good tactic to bear in mind, particularly in boss encounters. When you come to face the Octopus, try and pick up three red balloons so that you have ten rockets. Keep up with him until halfway through the final lap then unload them all in one go. You'll reduce him to a virtual standstill and can overtake on the line. If you're second in a normal race, having a homing missile is always a good weapon, but only if you can see the leader to shoot at! MIRROR MIRROR! PLAYERS GUIDE Yes, Diddy Kong does have the obligatory Mirror mode, meaning that once the game is completed you can do it all over again to find yet more hidden delights. Finish every every level, recover all of the pieces of amu all the gold trc and beat Wizp twice. Now, when you select a character, Adventu 2 appears as option and the is the Mirror mode. tui: HE0 t 1) TO EYE A bit of a spoiler here, but if you're using this guide, the entire game is going to be ruined! This picture shows the end sequence...or does it? And just when you thought you'd finished everything, old Wizpig comes along and does a runner again! Another world to do yet! "

After hitting the first couple of zippers, keep going straight, towards the pool of water. Another booster appears in front of you, release the accelerator and let it power you over. SHERBET ISLAND: WHALE BAY (21.00-17.30 This one can really shoot you up the leaderboard once you've got the hang of it. After the first bend, use the boost and head straight for the pirate ship.

ACCESSING THE TT CHALLENGE The TT Challenge is the first real 'secret' part of the game you find. Every world you have to visit has one key located inside it which opens up that world's TT Challenge door. Win the four player game inside these levels and you're awarded one quarter of the TT amulet. Once you have a key, you can simply exit the level and the game still registers you as having collected it. Here are the locations of each: DINO DOMAIN: ANCIENT LAKE SNOWFLAKE MOUNTAIN: SNOWBALL VALLEY The programmers were obviously being kind as this is the easiest of the keys to find. As you approach the first bend, the key is sitting on a small ledge in front of you. Simply drive up and collect it. Pah! At the very start of the stage, don't bother going forward. Instead turn left straight away and you should see a small passageway. Drive down there and the key is set back into the ice.

From the start, take the left-hand split and drive into the water. Keep going further out and you should see it resting inside a small cave in one of the cliff edges. Make sure you have a triple speed boost saved and drive up to the bell. Drive past it, the turn around and hit it so the drawbridge raises.

The second time your paths cross things are a lot tougher. This time, you have to collect nearly all of the power ups.

Samurai Shodown 64 is almost complete and proved highly popular at the JAMMA show (it rated as fourth most played game there in last month's chart). To find out the story of this incredible game and the creation of the Hyper NeoGeo 64 hardware that runs it, we spoke to those responsible at SNK's development centre. CVG: When did development start on the Hyper NeoGeo 64? SNK: The first conception stage began in the spring of 1994. from theirs it's just not possible to make a simple comparison of the different hardware capabilities.

"computer video games SNK: Depending on the stage of development the number of people working on the development is different but on average there are about 20 people. under a lot of pressure to produce an even better fighting game? SNK: We weren't really under pressure because of the success of other fighting games, rather we felt pressure because this is SNK's first shot at a fighting game on the new Hyper NeoGeo 64 board. CVG: With regards to game features, were you influenced by Sega's Virtua Fighter 3, Namco's Tekken 3 or Konami's Fighting Wu Shu? SNK: There wasn't any game in particular that we had in mind but from the point of friendly rivalry then maybe the Tekken series. CVG: Were the characters' movements created using motion capture? SNK: Yes, they were. CVG: Were there any special features you knew you definitely wanted to include when you started the game design? SNK: We wanted to capture the game character of Samurai Shodown. CVG: What percentage of the Hyper NeoGeo 64's true power potential does Samurai Shodown 64 use? SNK: I think it uses about 60 to 70%. SAMURAI SHODOWN 64 SNK / Hyper NEO GEO 64 / Nearly Complete OSNK LTD.1997 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED JAMMA SHOW VERSION. SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME. CVG: With regard to creating a 3D version of Samurai Shodown, what has been the greatest challenge for you? SNK: The main point is that we have to create 3D versions of characters that have already been fully designed. With revolutionary game play features such as the 360-degree battlefield, free-dash and multiple battle zones along with stunning 3D graphics and 2D animation this series has reached a new level of sophistication. CVG: Besides being a 3D version, what are the greatest differences between Samurai Shodown 64 and previous versions of Samurai Shodown? SNK: We wanted to evolve the combination attack even further beyond the typical standardised element that it's become in current 3D fighting games. With simplicity being the key, we are going to introduce a newly conceived system where it is possible to change your offense and defence during the combination. Another easy-to-understand feature is that, in order for the players to enjoy the real taste of a fight in the 3D environment, we've added a special button for the 'FREE DASH' movement. With this you can now run around and chase or be chased within the battle area. This noncombat strategy nature to the game is an important element which will add a wider variety of tactics for you to use during the fight. CVG: Is it difficult to maintain the character's image and appeal when you change the character from a sprite to a set of polygons? SNK: This slightly overlaps with the previous question but trying to represent a 2D character depicted by a fine and elaborate design with a limited number of polygons is a very difficult achievement. CVG: Why did you choose Samurai Shodown 64 as your first Hyper NeoGeo 64 game? Did you ever consider KoF or Real Bout as well? SNK: We did think about KoF and Real Bout as well, but we chose SS64 because we believe its widely appreciated originality will have the most impact. CVG: When did development start? SNK: The development groundwork started over a year ago but full time development began from around November of last year. CVG: The game appears to allow you to move about more and interact with the scenery. Were you influenced by Square's Bushido Blade? SNK: There were areas that we used as reference. CVG: Can you tell us about any interesting features in Samurai Shodown 64 that aren't in any other fighting game? SNK: I think that as a 3D fighting game that uses weapons, a major feature of SS64 is that the area of fighting tactics have been represented perfectly. As mentioned earlier, S564 is not simply another 2D game that's been converted to 3D. With regard to the method of representing the 2D sections appropriately! positively believe that the Hyper NeoGeo 64 has superior capabilities. It has the image of being the right board for the right job and we've used it represent everything in just the right way. CVG: How big is the software development team?

The version of Ehrgeiz on show at JAMMA was only 15% complete and was only just playable but the public reaction was nevertheless very favourable. Too many fighting games are big for a while but become tedious once they've been mastered.

HOSPITAL SIM BY BULLFROG ommandos is the latest in a long line of C&C challengers. Here the gameplay is set in World War 2. You take control of allied commandos, who must complete successful missions against the German army. As you command only a small complement of men, you'll have to be a master strategist to get your men through the missions alive. Keep an eye on terrain, and the enemies movement, then launch your attacks. Each of your commandos have different skills that you'll have to make full use of.

As conversions go, this one is looking very good indeed, but the real challenge for the programmers is getting the controls and playability just right. The basic aim is simple. You are manager of a struggling hospital and you have to turn it around, using limited resources and loads of patience.

The game is apparently a huge step forward from Command & Conquer and could be the new war sim to which others are cloned. It retains a lot of links to the film, with Matthew Broderick's original character now employed by the government to prevent another Wargames scenario. Hacking is still an integral part also, as it allows players to gain cash, power ups and some vital clues along the way.

V-Max is the clear source for Cloud's bike in the game with both machines boasting a 'see-me-and-weep' vee four liquid-cooled motor, distinctive air-guzzling intakes and urban street styling. The first time CVG takes you for a ride... The game was designed in Japan, but Yamaha called on the Americans to deliver the concept of the V-Max. Bike industry observers say Yamaha in Japan was unlikely to have created such a overdose of form-overfunction. For the V-Max became an instant legend, a big, bad, asphalt-chewing ass-whupping drag bike that had no aspiration at all to go around corners. For a start, that distinctive engine says it all oh sure, it might be stacked with four camshafts, 24 valves and four carburettors to shovel gas into the 1,198cc holes deep inside those black and polished casings but ultimately its sole (soul?) purpose is to shorten a straight line from A to B incidentally, the engine has now ended up in one of the most over the This guy wears a crash helmet and leathers for safety.

The telltale signs are shaft drive, not chain, a l-o-n-g wheelbase of 2.3 metres and a sewer busting weight of 262kg. Taking one of these on a race track is about as sensible as wearing trousers made from pasta. So what's it like to ride? Well, whap open the throttle and the bike hits 60mph in under three seconds. Keep it open and it shovels your frontal lobe into your throat as the bike tops out a few seconds later at 156mph. This is a bike that begs for some US blacktop, not the roundabouts of Surbiton. Throttle off too late as you rocket towards a bend and trouble strikes with a capital T. The soft suspension squats like a coward in a boxing ring and the raked out front-end and lardy rear tyre struggle to work out what the hell is going on. Nerves of steel are needed as are butts, elbows, knees and fingers of iron falling off is the crock of poo at the end of the 138bhp rainbow. The game costs .99, the V-Max a cool ,359. Enjoy the game first as it costs less and hurts less. Then start saving for a bike licence and V-Max, and start ploughing up the planet!
