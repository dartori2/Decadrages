"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETI GAME OF THE YEAR WINNER Those ravenous little devils, the Nibblers, which appeared in the very first issue of Computer & Video Games, have finally done some good. They have won their inventor, Paul Jay, a trip to Paris for two, complete with spending money, courtesy of Computer & Video Games. After careful consideration and much heart-searching by our panel of judges, Paul's Nibblers was voted the winner of our first Games Program of the Year competition. Nibblers won because it was a simple but original idea, which included different levels of difficulty. sound and graphics. It ran smoothly and proved easy to key-in but compulsive to play. So congratulations to Paul and commiserations to all those of you who held out high hopes of Paris in the Autumn. And for those of you who have not yet had a chance to meet The Nibblers, we will be printing a Vic20 listing we received which was converted from Paul's game.

COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPET/ Take to the War Path in the new year with wargames auMONIMH thor Ron Potkin. Ron was the writer of our April issue star game, Kriegspiel, a chance to take your computer's Panzer divisions in a tank battle scenario. War Path has a Wild West theme which gives the Indians every chance to reverse history. It also maps out Ron's unique Big Screen approach to computer war-gaming. Instead of printing out the listing for one machine, Ron will be taking you through each part of the program, month by month, explaining how the Big Screen technique works and showing how it can be utilised on many different computers. War Path kicks off our new year and provides some marvellous les sons in making the most of computer memory and TV screens. The Seventh Empire rules are printed in the January issue. So all you budding fleet commanders should pick up a copy to find out how to partake in galactic warfare, make piracy work for you and playoff one warring empire against another. The latest news from the C&VG special Starweb game comes from one of the more threatening of the galactic races, the dreaded Gzinti berserkers. Mark Woolwich who has been following the growth of the Gzinti empire closely managed to intercept the following transmission on its way to their home world of Gzin. The rate of expansion mentioned in previous reports has slowed greatly due to conflicts with other races on the thrice removed frontiers. The powerful and hostile Pirate 1 is being kept out of Gzinti territory. His scout fleets are detroyed by our border fleets who are taking minimal damage. Artifact Collector 1 has proved to be non-hostile and information received from him concerning Pirate 2 has resulted in our strengthening of the border between Gzin and Pirate 2. Furthermore a large force has been mobilized with the intent of destroying Pirate 2. Artifact Collector 2, after being initially hostile, has retreated, as large force is pursuing him with the aim of neutralizing his threat. A time and labour-consuming job, but vital to ensure continued expansion and replacement of lost ships. The fleet drawn into the black hole has remained silent and must be considered lost. However, the black hole provides a barrier to attack from regions beyond it. The prime directive is never forgotten, non-robot population is destroyed wherever ships can be spared, though the needs for our survival and supremacy often conflict with it. End of report.

"Endgame is the part of chess where precision is most important one slip here can throw away the benefits of hard-won advantages and victories secured in the middle game. Computers generally play endgames badly and yet it is endgame play which is widely believed to be the best mark of a good human player A well known example of King and Pawn against King (KPK) is in figure 1. White's only winning move is K-QB2, not K-Q2 or K-K2. Yet to discover this by searching involves looking ahead 27 ply. If KPK is so difficult, it is hardly likely that a program would find the best move in a complicated endgame such as, King, Rook and two Pawns against King, Rook and three Pawns. How can the grandmasters' endgame knowledge be captured? An obvious approach is to turn to textbooks such as Basic Chess Endings by Reuben Fine. To a precise reader, textbooks turn out to be full of errors, ambiguities and obscurities. The rules given are unvariably vaguely worded with numerous exceptions. Despite this there is the remarkable fact that textbooks are genuinely useful to the reader and in the case of endgames such as KPK seem to show how to play almost perfectly. A possible explanation is that chess players have some \"internal model\" in terms of which a piece of advice such as, \"develop Knights before Bishops\" can be interpreted without its meaning being precisely specified. For instance, \"Knights before Bishops\" is subordinate to \"Do not lose your Queen for nothing\" and this is considered too obvious to be worth stating. Finding all such hidden exceptions to rules is difficult for the programmer but simple for the textbook reader to do. Often there is a conflict of objections. How does \"advance the Pawn\" rate relative to \"take the opposition with your King\"? People seem to resolve such conflicts without even noticing them. The art of chess playing is often sacrificed on the alter of chess programming The usual way of writing chess programs is based on generating huge trees of variations and assigning each position a fairly crude numerical value. This is geared to what computers can do well rather than the special difficulties of the game itself. Human players do not analyse tens of thousands of variations before making a move. As I showed last month, grandmasters do not analyse much more than ordinary mortals, but they are much better at recognising features of a position which suggest good moves. Conventional chess programs have achieved surprising success in recent years, but to advance to grandmaster level may require building in expert knowledge as well as deep searching. Artificial intelligence (A.I.) researchers have devoted considerable effort in the last few years to identifying the form which expert knowledge might take. The restricted nature of endgames has made them a frequent vehicle for such research. Even elementary endgames such as King and Pawn against King are remarkably difficult to program in the usual way. One of the most important skills which humans exhibit is the ability to generalise from specific examples to a large number of equivalent positions while also recognising exceptions. In figure 2, White's only winning move is K-N4. Giving this information to a human player immediately gives him a great deal of other information. For example, if the whole configuration of pieces were moved to the left or the right or up or down the board, the same White move (King one square forward) might well still be right (you might like to check whether this is really true). And with the White King on N4 and the Pawn on B2 initially, the move P-B3 is also correct, since it transposes to the same winning position. K-N4 would still be the correct first move, even if White's King were on R3 or R4 instead of N3 in figure 2. There are clearly many different situations represented by the one diagrammed example and the chess player can make this generalisation easily while appreciating that if the White King were on QB4 in Figure 2, K-N4 would 03 Inoy be the correct move. Playing K-Q5 then gives a position which is more favourable than taking the opposition. Given an endgame programming environment, which allowed one example position to stand for many, where unspoken objectives (such as \"avoid losing material\") were automatically included and priorities among goals were easily specified, it might indeed be possible to program the endgame by giving little more than the examples from a textbook. This sort of approach has been tried in different forms several times in the last few years. As an example of what benefits may be gained, it turns out that to program KPK for the stronger side to win in every winnable position requires only the specifying of 20 simple patterns, plus a suitable \"environment\", not the 38 ply search needed by a conventional approach.

The display screen used with our computers is composed of 192 horizontal lines, each containing 320 dots. Delivering colour and luminosity instructions to each dot for a second requires 3.7 million cycles...a lot of work for the normal 6502 processor That's why the Atari computer has equipped its 6502 with its own electronic assistant. It's called ANTIC, and it handles all the display work, leaving the 6502 free to handle the rest. What this means to you is uncompromisingly spectacular display capabilities without loss of computer power needed to carry out the demands of your program. That's a quality you just don't find in ordinary home computers. And it's one of the reasons some computer experts say that Atari computers are so far ahead of their time. There's more...which is what you'd expect from Atari Language. The Atari Home Computer uses several programming languages to give the user maximum control of its extraordinary capabilities. PILOT.

"Tandy/Genie software catalogue is free! UNDESCRIBABLE! UNBELIEVABLE! Cosmic Suam Having to wait four months for his BBC Micro was hard luck for top programmer Mike Chalk. but it was certainly good news for Tandy/Genie owners, for he spent the time creating his last Arcade game for these machines, and of course exclusively for Kansas BBC MICRO and COLOUR GENIE programs Ask for catalogue It surpasses anything. anywhere! Two entirely different screens provide action and variation the like of which has never been seen on a computer screen before, and certainly not in any 'arcade game! First you have to beat the astroids. Easy at first but when hit they split and multiply, then split and multiply yet again before they can be completely killed off. But as they split, so they come in at entirely different angles... As the game progresses more and more appear. If you survive the astroids, down swoops the swarm! These horrors move about relentlessly, then without warning two, three or even more suddenly break away and attack, raining down bombs. Then its back to harder astroids...and so on... There are bonus scores and extra lives, and sound of course. and see the difference! VISA We welcome MIKE CHALK'S GREATEST EVER. For the Tandy and Genie .50 Vat and post paid.

"ecce A roll of the dice will decide your destiny. Will you be a winner or a loser? There's only one way to find out try this game! It is based on the well known game, Yachtzee, and the standard rules of this game apply with the addition of a 50 point bonus if the subtotal reaches 60 or more. Once you have decided on the number of players up to four can take part each player is given three throws of the dice. A player may decide to stick with the first or second throw by simply pressing Newline. Otherwise he will select individual dice to be thrown by typing A, B, C, D, or E in any order and in any combination. After the third throw or when a player has decided to stick the player must select an option from 1-12. The appropriate score is then given and the next player takes his turn. The game ends when all the players have taken all their 12 options. The one with the highest score is the winner. Will it be you? Roll those dice and find out! RUNS ON A ZX81 IN 16K BY C. J.

"40 SPACE ROLLER RUNS ON A SPECTRUM IN 16K BY DAVID HOUNSLOW W Painting white lines down the middle of the road has never been an easy task. All those motorcycles, cars and juggernauts racing around are hardly an ideal environment for the creative white line painter. But now things are getting even worse. I suppose it had to happen in the era of the microchip. Someone carrying out one of those time and motion studies has come up with the idea that white line painters would work quicker if missiles were chasing them. A fair point I hear you say. Anyone would work quicker if a highly explosive missile was coming their way... This is a mixture of two arcade games. You have to guide a white line painter along a road eating dots and painting lines at the same time. You must also remember to avoid the heat seeking missile which chases you. Keys 5, 6, 7, 8, control your movement. Pressing 1 will double your speed pressing it a second time will return you to normal speed. However this uses more fuel and should only be used in emergencies. When you manage to clear a screen another will appear with two missiles one of them travelling at double speed. There are a couple more features of the game which must remain a mystery but computer and Video Games readers like mysteries — don't you! 1 DIM 25 (2): DIM 0 [2): DIMF $ 12): DIM X 12): DIM y (2): DIM st 2 LET 1$=\"0\" LET 9$=\"*\": LET dots=0: LET SCO re=: LET Y=20: LET X=25: LET =\"5\" 3 LET O : LET ET 123 =56: L (2) =23 LET 3822 =2: LET *2) =29: LET 9 4: LET S13 =1: LET $12) =2 19 LET Fuel =528: RESTORE E ER 7: BORDER 7: BRISHT 2: IN INVERSE 1: DUER 3: FLASH : 20 FOR = TO 7: POKE USR \" 59: NEXT 30 FOR E= TO 7: POKE USS \"6\" + IF 31 PMD 15 THEN POKE US 1255 NEXT 52 EOS 14.79 136 FOR TOZ READ 3: POKE USR CHRS i + NEXT = 93 NEXT 102 DATA BIN 30211822, SIN B0811 010 10 .

"\"You youngsters don't know how well off you are! It's not easy being an old-agepensioner you know. Take my trip to the post office to get my pension for instance. I have to cross an extremely busy road dodging the big lorries and cars because they haven't put in a crossing yet. It's lucky I'm still quick on my pins otherwise I wouldn't be talking to you now. I've had several close shaves I can tell you! But that's not the end of it. After the road comes the river and as I never learnt to swim as a girl I had to devise a special way of getting across. It took me weeks and weeks and several loaves of Mother's Pride to get the ducks to help me out. Now they let me use them as stepping stones to get to the other side. I bounce off their backs like water off a... well you know the rest of that old saying don't you! The only trouble is that sometimes one of my feathered friends decides to take a quick dip just as I am about to step aboard. So far I've managed to avoid a ducking! Just my little joke. But I'm sure one day I'll end up in the drink. Anyway this nice young gentleman has just offered to take me across the road so I'll see you again soon — as long as the ducks are still friendly by the time I reach the river. Byeeee!\" As you may have guessed by now this game is a version of that arcade favourite Frogger. In this version the frog is replaced by a granny and the frog's nests by several post offices. You are given four minutes to get seven grannies to a post office so you have to move fairly quickly. When the seventh granny reaches her destination she gets a double pension and you get another chance to help seven more old ladies across the road. The game starts slowly but speeds up. When a score of 2000 points has been reached the game is at its maximum speed and will prove difficult to even the most avid Frogger player. Variables. A$(1-8), BS(1-16), CS(1-8): car, log and duck strings. A$: General get statement variable. H: Number of grannies and post offices. TI$: Time. Y: Distance down the screen.

If that had you tearing your hair out wait until you try this new one from the devious mind of Stephen Shaw. This one does not involve squares just rings and it's sure to have you going around in circles. The puzzle may be imagined as a disc with an outer ring of six colours and an inner ring of two colours. It is double sided and the outer and inner rings can be rotated. There is also another vertical-axis of rotation at right angles to the screen. This gives an almost 3D effect to the puzzle. You are given the option of either manipulating the puzzle, or allowing the computer to jumble it up and attempting to restore it. Four skill levels make this brain twister a lasting challenge will you take it up? Remember, the Cube has got nothing on this! Happy puzzling ...

This version features a moving horizon, and realistic aircraft sounds plus an altimeter which appears on the left of the screen. The joystick is used just like a real aircraft stick and the player has to fly his aircraft toward enemy planes and shoot them down. You get two minutes to shoot down as many enemy aircraft as possible. But remember to keep an eye on the altimeter. Too high and the engine will stall, too low and you will crash into the ground. So off you go into the wild blue yonder-and watch out for bandits! 53 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 63 "

"GLUTTON When there's a glut of dots around the screen you need to be feeling pretty hungry to munch your way into the clear. Glutton is probably not a game to be played between meals. You take the part of a Billy Bunter character and are awarded points for the most dots you can eat. These are laid out in a Pacman type maze and of course you soon realise that you are not alone in the labyrinth! There is something spooky in there with you, actually there's three of them and they are as hungry for you as you are for the edible dots. When the player eats one of the larger dots on the course, he is transformed from the hunted to the hunter making his pursuers change their shape and run away. Fortunately, for the hungry player they also revert to half their normal pace. But watch out when they start to flash it's a sure sign that your meal is about to leap off the plate and start to feel a little hungry itself. It's time to start running again. The program keeps a high score which is stored, allowing the program to be re-run without clearing the high score memory. And it also makes use of a short machine code program which loads the contents off the screen so the maze can be drawn from memory rather than the tedious reading DATA. So if you're hungry for competition ... start here. RUNS ON A TRS-80 IN 16K BY JASON MACHIN 10 CLS:PRINT' 15, CHRS (23) GLUTTON\":PRINTTAB(B) STRINGS (7, 131) IPRINT! PRINTTAB(5) \"BY J.

"THE SANITY CLAUSE My sanity now partially restored with some help from our readers, I feel it is about time to tell all about Asylum. This game by Frank Corr, like Deathmaze, features a graphic maze with movement through it controlled by arrow keys, combined with typed commands in English. However, there the similarity to Deathmaze ends. Asylum accepts whole sentences rather than two-word commands. The corridors are lined with doors which can be seen to be open or closed Most of the doors are locked. Some locks can be picked, others unlocked by a specific key. Guards can be seen barring the way at strategic points try to pass them at your peril! When the game commences the player finds himself locked in a cell with nothing but a hand-grenade to keep him company. Yes if handled wrongly it WILL blow up!. There is nothing for it but to find a way to escape from the cell. Should the player be recaptured, he will find he must escape again, this time by a different method. Then what? How is it possible to break further into the game with those guards on each corner? This is the point at which I nearly went mad a few months ago! I was not the only one Steve Gamble from Sheffield wrote in desperation asking me to pass on any useful tips I might receive from helpful readers. He even offered to take out an additional mortgage on his house to pay for such advice! Fear not, Steve! Computer & Video Games readers have come to our rescue! R. W. Patterson of Sitcoates School in Wrenthorpe suggested that the guard should be approached with the contidence of a hedgehog trying to overturn a speeding juggernaut. Tiptoe, turn and face the guard and punch him, was his advice. Then frisk him, he suggested, and watch the startling metamorphosis as he turns into a box containing useful objects! Well, the last bit was OK, but the first few moves didn't quite seem to work out. Mr P. A. Ellis of Wrexham was more explicit in how to get to the frisking stage. For readers who are as desperate as Steve and myself, I have encoded the instructions to protect those of sound mind in a Basic program listing. Type it in and run it to obtain the tips. Having successfully got past the guard and armed with a brass key, I managed to free an inmate who proved to be an expert locksmith. The trouble is, he was also a chain smoker, and got quite nasty without a regular 'fix'. I was getting on reasonably well with my new found friend when suddenly and without warning he pushed me into a maze. Mr. Ellis has obviously got beyond this point as he ended his letter with meaningless questions like \"How do you get the hanger off the inmate after the second maze?\" Never mind the second maze, Mr. Ellis, how do you get out of the first one? Mr. Ellis didn't tell me any more for fear of spoiling my game!!. Eventually I found my own favourite ending! Try this one Steve, and your worries will be over. Go into the first door on the right from the left-hand entrance to the guards quarters. There you will be welcomed in for a lobotomy. Before you can decline, the screen will clear with a message: 'You are now very calm'. Asylum runs on a TRS-80 or Video Genie in 16 I often get desperate letters from readers for a solution to a particular problem in an Adventure which is baffling them and preventing further exploration. Whilst I am happy to help if I can! no doubt many readers would rather not see the solution, preferring to battle on themselves. Therefore I have written some tips in code to help solve the problems that seem to be bugging most Adventurers who write in. To decode the solutions, type in and run the decoding program provided. The program will call for lines of coded text to be input. When this has all been entered, type 'E'. After a short delay, the message will be displayed in clear language on the screen. 100 REH COMPUTER & VIDEO CARES 110 REN ADVENTURE TIPS DECODE PROGRAM 120 REH BY KETTH CAMPBELL 130 CLS PRINT TYPE EN DATA ENTRY 140 FOR TETO 10 156 PRINT 'ENTER LINE NO.IL \"ETHEN 190 170 IF ANI) 180 NEXT 190 FOR I TO 10 220 MOCCHIDS CAST) 230 IF ZE59 THEN 308 PRINT BSI) HEXTI BEAT THE GUARDS IN ASYLUS In suggesting ways that an Adventure buried in subroutines, but the extent to might be programmed, I have quite which you can get away with it will also frequently used FOR-NEXT loops to depend on which machine you have scan strings and arrays to identify For instance, the BBC micro will not words.

"MACHINE CODE TRY THE GO FASTER CODE Home computers are designed to make it easy for us to type in, list, edit, save, load, and run Basic programs. It is so easy to use Basic on these machines that we need a very good reason to take the trouble of using any other programming language. The most common reason for getting away from Basic is that it is too slow for some applications; moving We can use the same idea with other numbers than 10; if we use 2 instead of 10 we only need two digits, 0 and 1, and the positions of the digits, counting from the right represent units, twos, fours, eights, sixteens, etc, each position counting for twice as much as the position immediately to the right. Thus, the binary number 11001011 means one 128, plus one 64, plus no 32s, plus no 16s, plus one 8, plus no 4s, plus one 2 plus one 1, which works out to the decimal number 203. We can convert numbers from binary to decimal as in the example Reading the column of remainders from bottom to top gives 11001011, the binary equivalent of the decimal number 203. These strings of binary digits (or bits) are not easy to work with; we generally need to use binary numbers 8 or 16 bits long, and it is very difficult to remember them and to copy them correctly. To get numbers that are conveniently short we generally use hexadecimal or base 16 numbers. In base 16 we need 16 digits, from 0 to 15, and we use the letters A to F for the digit values from 10 to 15. The digits have positional values as in decimal and binary, but this time the values are multiplied by 16 as we move to the left. To take an example, the hexadecimal number 1A30 means one 4096 plus ten 256s plus three 16s plus no ls, which works out to 6704 in decimal. For numbers up to decimal 15 we can convert between binary and hex (short for hexadecimal) by a simple table: Decimal Binary Hex 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 13 1101 1110 15 1111 We can also use this table in converting larger numbers between binary and hex. To convert from hex to binary we simply replace each hex digit by the four binary digits from the table, for example, hex 1A30 becomes binary 0001101000110000. To convert from binary to hex, we divide the binary number into groups of four digits, from the right, and replace each group by the corresponding hex digit, for example binary 11001011 gives the two groups 1100 and 1011, so the hex equivalent is CB. EGO NOWO mu NOWO-OO 12 graphics in interactive action games, the calculation of the computer's move in complicated strategy games, and the searching of large amounts of data in Adventure-type games are just a few examples. The fastest response that can be obtained from a computer comes from machine code, but before we look at what this means we need a little background information on number systems and the internal organisation of a computer. With ordinary decimal numbers, we use a positional principle in order to represent numbers of any size by combinations of 10 different digits, 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. The amount a digit contributes to the number depends on the position of the digit; the rightmost digit represents units, the next digit to the left represents 10s, the next digit to that represents hundreds, and so on. The decimal number 203 thus means two hundreds plus no 10s plus three units. BY TED BALL above, by adding the position values for the ls in the binary number. To convert from decimal to binary we divide by 2, recording the result and remainder, and repeat the process on the result until we reach zero; the remainders in reserve order give the binary number. To illustrate this, let us look at the conversion of decimal 203 to binary: 203 divided by 2 gives 101, remainder 1 101 divided by 2 gives 50, remainder 1 50 divided by 2 gives 25, remainder 0 25 divided by 2 gives 12, remainder 1 12 divided by 2 gives 6, remainder 0 6 divided by 2 gives 3, remainder 0 3 divided by 2 gives 1, remainder 1 1 divided by 2 gives 0, remainder 1 78 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

If we now look at the way a computer system is organised we can see why binary numbers are used. Figure 1 is a simple block diagram of a computer system CPU which stands for Central Processing Unit. This is the part of the computer that does all the calculations and in a microcomputer the CPU is a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor operated by the presence or absence of a voltage. We can thus represent the data bus by an 8-bit binary number and the address bus by a 16-bit binary number, where a 1 means there is a voltage on the line and a O means there is no voltage on the line. Machine code programs are actually patterns of ls and Os in the memory, which we represent as binary numbers (or in abbreviated form as hexadecimal numbers). The processor can only work with these binary numbers, but it is almost impossible for human beings to do So.

RAM stands for Random Access Memory; the name does not describe the most important point, that it's possible to write new programs and data into the RAM. I/O stands for Input/Output, the connections between the computer and the outside world: keyboard, TV display, tape recorder, printer. The various parts of the computer are joined into a single system by three sets of connections, the Control bus (which we can ignore as it cannot be affected by programming), the Address bus, and the Data bus (a bus is just a group of connections). The home computers we are dealing with have eight data line and 16 address lines which are We actually write our programs in a language that has meaningful names for the machine instructions and allows us to use meaningful names for our data, then we translate into the binary numbers the processor needs. The meaningful language is called assembly language or assembler, a program written in assembly language is called source code and the translation of the source code into binary or hex is called object code There are many microprocessors, each having its own machine code and assembly language, but only three are used in home computers: the 6502 (Pet, Apple, Acorn, Atom, Vic-20 and BBC Micro), the 280 (ZX80, ZX81, ZX Spectrum, Sharp MZ8OK, TRS-80), and the 6809 (so far used only in the TRS-80 Colour Computer and the Dragon). We will be looking at all three in detail later. are, let us look at a simple program to add 2 and 2. The object code (in hex) is on the left and the source code on the right. In all three programs the same principle is used: load the number 2 into the processor, add 2, and finally store the result in memory location 1000 hex. There are, however, several differences in the details of the source code. Because the assembly languages are so different you will have to stick to learning just the one for the computer you have. You will need a text book to refer to the precise details of the assembly language and the corresponding machine code. There are many books available, some dealing with a particular mod el of computer and others dealing with the microprocessor without reference to any particular model. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 79 "


"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING THE SEARCH FOR A GOOD STRATEGY I have been looking at a table for a simple game. The game consists of two players, A and B, independently choosing one of the numbers 1, 2, 3. If they choose the same number B wins the amount of the chosen number otherwise A wins the amount of his number. This is equivalent to A choosing a row and B choosing a column from table one. score is better than with any other probabilities. Program 1 has been written to demonstrate the principle. In order to keep the program simple and avoid obscuring the principle I have used a simple method for adjusting the probabilities, which will not work correctly all the time, and I have omitted any checks to prevent the probabilities from becoming greater than l or less than 0. The probabilities are set at 1/3 to begin with, and the subroutine beginning at line 500 selects a number 1, 2, or 3 with the appropriate probabilities. Lines 140 and 150 call this subroutine to obtain the moves and in line 160 the score is found from the array s(i, j). The subroutine at line 700 is used to update the probabilities and records the average scores to use in the updating. a(u) records the overall average scores and g(u) records average scores over 100 games. Line 705 calculates the adjustment to be made to the probability for the last row or column selected, and in order to keep the total probability always 1, half the adjustment is subtracted from each of the other A 2 2 -2 -2 2 3 3 -3 There is no obvious way of finding a good strategy for playing the game, and the mathematics for solving the problem is quite complicated. However, it is not difficult to write a program that will learn to improve its performance. The best way of playing this type of game is for A and B to select their numbers at random, with probabilities chosen so that the average two probabilities, in lines 740 and 745. In the games we have looked at so far, each player makes only one move, and the two players make their moves simultaneously, without knowing the other players move. In most real games, each player will have to make several moves, and the players make their moves alternately and know all the previous moves. However, it is always possible to reduce an extended game to the simple form of one move for each player, although in the reduced form a \"move\" actually consists of a strategy for playing the whole game. To see how the reduction can be performed, consider the game of Nim. In this game we begin with several piles of matchsticks or other objects, and at each turn a player may take any number of matchsticks from one pile, the winner being the player who takes the last matchstick. Let us take a very simple game of Nim, which begins with two piles, the first having one match and the second having two matches. We can work through all the possible ways of playing this game, as shown in figure 1. The boxes show the position after each move and the numbers above the boxes can be used to refer to the moves. There are only three ways for the first player to play, because after the second player's move either the second player has won or there is only one match left and the first player has no choice for his second move. There are four ways for the second player to play (these are plans for the whole game, not single moves) as follows: 1) If player 1 makes move 1, make move 1,1 If player 1 makes move 2, make move 2,1 If player 1 makes move 3, make move 3,1 2) If player 1 makes move 1, make move 1,1 If player 1 makes move 2, make move 2,2 If player 1 makes move 3, make move 3,1 Figure 1 Pile 2 Pile 1 Pilet Pile 1 Pile1 Pile 1 Pile 2 2nd player wins 2nd player wins 1.1.1.

If we look positions and with the numbers more moves, and this procedure is at the lowest entries under each along the bottom showing which really of importance only in the branch we find, under branch 1 a player has won. mathematical theory, where it is win for player and a win for player If we look at the final positions convenient to be able to treat any 2, under branch 2 only wins for following move 1 we see that in game in a completely abstract player 1, and under branch 3 only a some cases player 1 wins and in fashion as just a rectangular array of win for player 2. some cases player 2 wins.

"LOOK MUM, NO WINGS Any changes to the display occurs, in human terms, instantaneously due to the combination of the display technology and the powerful controlling computer. Carefully designed visuals to indicate the artificial horizon or the weather pattern ahead are readily comprehensible to the layman, and must be invaluable to a trained pilot. More immediately appealing are the visuals in flight simulators. One simulator being displayed by Redifon Simulators gave wide-angle visuals, so that a simulated view flying requires detailed and realistic images as are technically and economically possible. A program for a personal computer could be highly effective while falling well short of the quality of flight simulator graphics. In any event, the display must be of very high resolution with access to a full palette of colours all of which must be available in varying intensities. This implies that very large screen memories are necessary — larger than can be addressed by eight-bit microAlong with about a quarter of a million other people, I went to Farnborough last month to see the flying display. The planes and the displays can provide the inspiration for computer games and a wealth of ideas for graphics — both static and mobile. Being able to see the planes, whether in the static display or in the air, reinforces very strongly the importance of being able to see a complex object from many different points of view in order to be able to appreciate its overall shape and structure, and hence perhaps its function. Only the combination of several rather special views of a plane such as the Rockwell B-1 can reveal the way in which its shape has been designed to reduce its visibility to radar systems. This kind of experience should inspire anyone to polish up his program for displaying three-dimensional shapes and using hidden line removal The exhibition of aviation hardware is vast, and it is surprising although perhaps it should not be to come across the names of firms familiar to users of personal computers — Thom-EMI to name one. What is particularly striking is the number of manufacturers displaying computers and video displays. The graphics capabilities being demonstrated by various manufacturers were quite remarkable, particularly by comparison with what is available for video games and personal computers. The major applications for graphics were in instruments displays and simulation. The most advanced instrument panel systems for aircraft cockpits all include a cathode-ray tube on which any individual instrument display can be shown as required. Raster-scan technology is naturally used to generate the display on the C.R.T., and the visual display is composed of dots, just as on a personal computer. However, liquid crystal display technology is used for the display surface. from the cockpit is provided for all the windows. The visuals representing airports in all conditions from daylight to darkness, and including in between, dusk and foggy conditions, are realistic and convincing. If personal computers are to be able to display the sort of graphics used in flight simulators advances are needed in both hardware and software compared to what is generally available now. This begs the question of whether it is necessary to reproduce the graphics precisely on a personal computer. To convince a pilot in a simulator to take his experience seriously and make him believe he is actually processors — So that a 16-bit machine is needed. It would be needed to produce realistic mobile graphics with such images. The programming expertise necessary to write programs generating such graphics is mostly contained within the companies involved in making the simulators. The only program known to me that has graphics remotely approaching the level of flight simulators is a Jumbo jet landing program for the Atari. The Atari machines, incidentally are probably the only current personal computers able to display the necessary images. As all this graphics capability and technology already exists in the aviation world, there is no reason why it should not be borrowed and adapted by the games and computing sector, as long as it can be delivered at the right price. illustration: Jon Davis BY GARRY MARSHALL "

The computer provides information on the current rates of inflation, unemployment, dollar exchange, and the balance of payments, as well as details of current wholesale prices, average income and the retail price index. You have a number of policies at your disposal as you wrestle with the gloomy downward spiral in the country's economic performance. Various forms of taxation can be tinkered with in an attempt to reduce inflation and unemployment. As if the country's economic problems were not enough for the hero of our game to worry about there are also a number of unforeseen catastrophes which could up set public opinion anytime.

The game may be good training for future Chancellors of the Exchequer or to shut-up that drunk in the pub who always claims that the country's problems would be over if the government would abolish all taxes, but I found it far from addictive and somewhat simplistic.

SHOOTING ARCADE USBORNE It's all the fun of the fair in this amusing new arcade type game for the 16K Atari computers. The idea of Shooting Arcade is quite simple all you have to do is shoot all the targets before your ammunition runs out. At the start of the game, you are confronted with six rows of different targets which criss-cross in front of you. The first row consists of a row of pink elephants which stomp their way across the screen. Above them is a row of waddling ducks opening and closing their beaks. Next is a row of hopping bunny rabbits. After this things begin to get a little more difficult with revolving faces changing from happy to sad. Hit a sad one and another bunny rabbit will appear. The next line is a row of targets which when hit will reverse the flow of fairground invaders. The top row of diamonds are valuable targets worth bonus bullets. CAN YOU WRITE GAMES PROGRAMS?

Jenny Tyler, If you can write fantasy or adventure games, invader games or race games, write to London Usborne Publishing Ltd, 20 Garrick Street, On clearing the entire screen, the player is confronted by a huge bear (wearing a hat) which dodges from left to right when hit. The game uses high resolution colour graphics making good use of the machine's colour and graphical capabilities. Despite the game's excellent graphics found the game rather unimaginative and the sound effects were particularly disappointing.

Mind The Meteors challenges you to steer your spaceship safely through a meteor storm. Trouble is the meteors are not meteors at all but simply a number of stationary asterisks dotted around a rectangle which occupies exactly half of the screen. The spaceship is pretty unimpressive too. Just a tiny little arrow. This game was so easy I mastered it on my fifth go and found it so boring from then on that I quickly loaded the second game on the tape Daylight Robbery to see if it was any better. Alas no. The game offers an interesting idea you have to raid as many safes as you can and get away with the cash escaping through the maze exit, before the guard can grab you. As with Mind The Meteors the game was spoilt by hopeless graphics. The safes are dollar signs, you are represented by the letter 0, the guard by an I, and as with all four games there were no sound effects. This was also a frustratingly slow game to play. Battleships is a good game, but I did not feel that this computer version was any ZX81 1KON CASSETTE ADULT GAMES !! better than playing the game with a pen and paper. The submarines, destroyers, cruisers, and carriers were all represented by the letters 'S','D', 'C',A' — a bit disappointing considering the exciting comicstyle illustration of a submarine on the cassette inset The final game on this cassette was Invisible Invader which enables you to draw long lines of asterisks across the screen. Again the graphics are disappointing-your \"spacecraft\" is an asterisk. The \"Invader\" as the title suggests is invisible, which is just as well really, for if it had been visible I feel sure it would have been an asterisk too.

Strange then that Mastermind the latest offering from Commodore should be such a poor offering. Here are just a couple of examples. Question: What have A.AB. and O in common. If you think the answer is types of blood or blood type you would be wrong. The answer is blood types. Therefore the answer given by yours truly was wrong according to the book of Commodore. I wouldn't mind if the thing was at least consistent, but a two word answer was given as wrong if the answer in the data : base was one word, ie. Marquis of Queensbury: wrong. Queensbury: right. Fly Fishing: wrong. Fishing; right. But just when you think you have cracked it and answer Weismuller for the first Tarzan you find you have been double crossed and the correct answer is Johnny Weismuller. I am not sure how many questions there are on each data tape but after a while life gets boring seeing the same questions appear time and time again when picked at random. .
