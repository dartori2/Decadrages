"DREVIEW TIIIIIIIIII ST AMIGA SPECTRUM AMSTRADC AVALONE AND THE LAST CRUSADE INDIANA JONES—THE GAME All the Indiana Jones film so far have been licensed by computer game manufacturers mindscape bought the rights to the Indiana Jones character and produced their own game based loosely on Raiders of the Lost Ark called Indiana Jones and the Lost Temple, and BY US GOLD/LUCASFILM e's back! That whip-totin', fedora-wearing', snake-fearin', cool-leather-jacket-sportin', danger, it's your-face-I-laugh-in hero has returned to kick some Nazi butt. Heads roll. Some sex. Plenty of fighting. Motor Vehicle crashes galore. Julian Rignall says check it out. The Indiana Jones story first started back in 1977 when Star Wars director George Lucas was discussing his ideas of a new type of hero with friend Steven Speilberg. Three years later his ideas came to fruition, and shooting began on Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film busted serious numbers of blocks. Four years later, a squel was released, entitled Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It featured more high adventure, more stunts and even more action. And now the latest Indy adventure is set to hit the streets -Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade — and it promises to deliver even more action than its predecessors. If I were a block I'd be expecting a serious busting any day now... THE FILM Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade features Harrison Ford (who else?) in the starring role as everybody's favourite hero, and Sean Connery (everybody's favourite James Bond) as Dr Henry Jones, Indian's father. Characters from Raiders of the Lost Ark returned to the screen once again, with Denholm Elliot, John Rhys-Davis, Julian Glover and Michael Bryne appearing as Marcus Brody the museum curator, Indy's friend Sallah, industralist Walter Donovan and Vogel, the evil German SS officer respectively. And once again Industrial Light and Magic have been commissioned to produce some very special effects. As you can imagine, it's japes and scrapes a go-go with Indy careening from one highly dangerous situation to another. Just the sort of stuff we expect from our Indy. TONE 0000000 0000000 BA 012 "


"ID 664 REVIEW WIIIIIIIIIIZ Atari/Lucasfilm Computer Game Division created a Temple of Doom arcade game, which in turn was converted to home computers by US Gold, and it's US Gold who've picked up the license to the latest Indy film, in association with Lucasfilm Computer Game Division. There are two versions of the game being programmed, the Indy story game is being produced by Lucasfilm in America, while the action game is being written here in the UK by Tiertex. The UK game is a multidirectionally scrolling, multi-screen, multi-level platform affair in which the player takes the role of Indiana Jones. Because the film isn't being released until May 25th in America, Lucas Films aren't giving any of the plot away so you'll just have to try to guess ATONES 0000000 ERE hordes of mindless space monsters would you believe us? Probably not. The game is looking very promising, with more platform jumping and Nazi-walloping action that you can shake a bullwhip at. The graphics are crisp and nicely detailed, and there's an excellent digitised piccy of Indy chucked in for good measure. We're also promised sampled sound from the film. What more could an Indiana Jones fan ask for? Both Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade games will be released at the end of the Summer. Watch out for reviews in forthcoming issues of C&VG. As ever, we'll have it first, you'll see it and read about it first. JULIAN RIGNALL AZONES 0000000 it from the screenshots! (Or fly off to America to see the film when it launches.)

STORMLORD yours. How sweet. Not that this is a game for softies, mind. Raf Cecco has once again done the Spectrum proud with a superb blend of arcade and adventure, mixing just the right amount of both. Sprites and backdrops are good and colourful, and everything moves very smoothly. Hearty sound effects, cute jingles and a rousing opening score keep the speaker cones bouncing. Nick Jones, the guy behind the C94 Cybernoids, has programed Commodore Stormlord, with the aid of graphics man, Hugh Binns and the Maniacs of Noise, and they've made a damned good job of it.

"REVIEW TIIIIIIIIIIIIZ Archimedes Revisited There is a computer which makes the Amiga and ST look like toys a computer which outperforms your Sega, Nintendo and PC Engine consoles in every respect and which uses technology that will probably be standard in ten years' time. It could be the best games computer ever made. It's the Acorn Archimedes. Trouble is, everyone regards the Archie as a 'serious' computer just what you might expect from the company responsible for the BBC B and Master 128 machines. At the sort of prices the Archie sells for, ranging from around ,000 to $2,500 depending on the spec, it's limited to educational and business markets. But now there's feverish speculation that Acorn may be on the verge of signing an agreement with Amstrad, by which the main boards of the Archimedes are repackaged as a games machine at around . This would certainly put the pressure on the ST and Amiga, because the Archimedes has the potential to blow them out of the water. A Lean, mean RISC machine. TECH SPECS What is it about the Archimedes which is so revolutionary? When Acorn's Research and Development team decided to create a computer for the 90's (that's the 1990s, not nonagenarians) they rejected the idea of improving an old technology using established processors like the 280, 6502 or even the 68000. They started from scratch and created a whole new processor ARM. The Acorn Reduced Instruction Set Computing Machine is at the cutting edge of computer development. The idea behind RISC is that the processor has a very small library of simple commands at its disposal. For more complex tasks it simply combines a number of commands. By eliminating the rare complex commands, the processor can work faster on the common ones. ARM also uses 32-bit architecture, which handles data faster than 16-bit or 8-bit machines. The combination of RISC and 32-bit architecture results in a computer which is, frankly, flipping fast; the Archimedes can work at 4 MIPS-million instructions per second and Acom technicians claim to have made it go up to 18 MIPS in certain circumstances. On standard benchmark test, that's up to eighteen times faster than the ST, Amiga, or PC. Phew! CPU Clock rate Graphics 68000 8MHZ 640x400 mono resolutions 320X200 16 col Amiga 68000 7.14mhz 640x512 16 col 640x200 4 col 320x512 32 col 320x256 32 col Archimedes ARM 4 or 8 MHz 640x512 mono 640x256 16 col 640x256, 256 col Many others Pallette colours Sound 4096 512 4096 3 channels, mono 4 channels, stereo 8 voice stereo MIDI fitted MIDI optional MIDI optional "


"NEWS MIII GRAPHICS Of course, it's not enough just to be fast; a good games machine has to offer decent graphics, too. The Archimedes, which is partially designed to be compatible modes. Most work with a standard monitor, but at the higher resolutions you need a high scan-rate monitor like the NEC MultiSync. The top resolution is 1280x976, though this is in mono. More typical modes would be 160x256, or 640x256, using 16 colours from a total available palette of 4096. Since this approaches the resolution of television, it's easy to see that the Archimedes has astonishing potential for hi-res and digitised graphics. As well as shelling out a heap of dosh to buy Telecomsoft! from BT, Microprose have signed up the next two Freescape releases from Incentive. These will be the 16 bit versions of the two 3D graphics adventure extravaganzas, Rack Side ang. Tigal FelinefoPark Side will ha features the following a month or so later. 89997 20,007,900 PEXERALEZALETLER ADIZENDO PATRE n their own label, Incentive are bringing out a potboiler Freescape game, which the Home Computer Club are hundling with Spectrum, C64 and Amstrad copies of Total Eclipse and flogging for .20. Like Total Eclipse, The Sphinx Jinx is set in Egypt and you have an hour to roam the catacombs of a pyramid in search of the 12 parts of a Sphinx, before the sun is once moe eclipsed, and BOMZA! the Earth's done for. Knock up a high score and you can enter a competition to win a holiday in Hawaii to watch the real eclipse! Cor! What smashing fun! SOUND In stark contrast to the blips and beeps of the BBC, the Archimedes has the most powerful sound processor yet seen on a small computer. Using part of the video processing chip, the Archimedes outputs eight voices, using waveshape data held in 256-byte wavetables. A digital-to-analogue convertor handles the output. This gives eight-bit resolution, but uses a logarithmic scale which means that the effective dynamic range is 13 bits at the average sampling rate of 20KHz (top ratio is 31KHz). This compares favourably with commercial sound samplers like the Akai S950, which has twelve-bit resolution at up to 38KHz. Each voice can be assigned to one of seven positions in the stereo spectrum; output is through the monitor, or via a headphone/amp output. Existing Archimedes can be fitted with MIDI interfaces, from Acom or EMR; there are also hardware sound samplers from Armadillo, both sub- for an eight-bit system, and + for a sixteen-bit MIDIfied professional version. THE BIG CATCH The big catch at the moment is, of course, the price. There are two series of Archimedes, which share the same four basic chips: the 300s and 400s, which feature built-in hard disks, memory of up to 4mb and more expandability. The biggest system the A440, costs  plus VAT with a colour monitor. ver the summer months, charity chain OXFAM is running a software aid appeal to provide food, shelter and medical aid for starving people all over the world. So, if you're fed up with playing Death of the Murderous Mega-Gargoyles from Dimension 16 in 3D, trot on down to your nearest OXFAM, hand it over and say \"Hello, OXFAM persin. Here is a game for the OXFAM software sale.\" It will then go on sale, hopefully making lots of money and filling the bellies on hungry folks everywhere. lectronic Arts are now knocking out some of their old \"classic\" gamesfor not a lot of dosh. \"The Software Classics\" range includes Bard's Tale, Marble Madness, Skyfox II. World Tor Golf, Earth Orbit Stations, Arctic Fox, Legacy of the Ancients, Music Construction Set and The Archon Collection. These will be available across a host of formats priced at .99 for 16 bit disk versions, .99 for 8 bit disk versions and .99 for 8 bit cassettes. THINGS TO COME Acorn's next launch is rumoured to be positioned between the 300 and 400 series in other words, between very expensive' and 'hideously expensive! Acorn doesn't appear to have the will to apply ARM technology to the games market. But someone might someone who specialises in taking developments in technology and repackaging them in an affordable and attractive form. Will we shortly be treated to the sight of Alan Sugar leaping from his bath shouting 'Eureka!? John Renwick he next time you're stuck in Police Quest or struggling in Beyond Zork, you don't have to vent your frustration by putting your foot through the screen.

"ADAMS SA DONKEY AN APRIL FOOL I think C+VG is a great magazine, but it annoyed me to see that the play by mail pages have been reduced to one page a month. Me and some friends of mine like to read the play by mail and the AGM pages a lot, so you understand that we were a bit disappointed. Please get it back to two pages, which the PBM deserves. Finally, I have read about the \"brainstick'. I'd like some more information about that incredible new form of game-controlling. I am a great fan of science fiction too, and have seen the film Firefox, and I liked the idea of steering things with thoughts. You understand that I really want to know more about this. All I can say now is to keep up the good work and please answer soon. JOHAN DE JONG YOB: Hah! Fooled you and you fell for it like the horrid PBM player you are! However, you can take some consolation in the fact that you aren't the only gullible person around Grandslam and Microprose phoned in to contact Joseph King who supposedly designed the Brainstick, and were duly told that they'd just fallen for an April fool.

"MAIL BAG THE BIGINE IS FAB Dear Yob, I was reading the letters page in the April issue of C+VG when I noticed a letter from somebody called Patrick Coolwijk. He said that many PC Engine games were nothing like the arcade machines that they were taken from. Unfortunately, I haven't had a go on a PC Engine yet so! don't know what the games play like but all the games look identical to the arcades in the screen shots I've seen and every computer magazine says that they are the closest arcade copies they have ever played so I feel fairly sure that this person is completely wrong (or stupid) to put down such a machine in this way. DANIEL SMITH COPMANTHORPE, YORK YOB: To be quite blunt, our Dutch friend was completely wrong AND stupid. The PC Engine is totally brilliant, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a pleb. POINTLESS LETTER OF THE MONTH I'm one of those people that owns an Amiga, I sincerely hope this doesn't make me an *AMIGA FREAK', as some of your less intellectually endowed readers would put it. To my mind, a freak is a person or animal or plant that is abnormal or deformed, you know, the sort of thing you put in a cage and prod with pointy sticks. As you seem to be grading readers on their English (great idea by the way! I thought it was only fair to point out to these readers what they are actually admitting to. R LEADBETTER WITHAM, ESSEX YOB: Judging by your handwriting, I'd say that you ARE an Amiga freak. So there. As for the rest of your letter, I can't make head nor tail of it. Perhaps you should be put in a cage and prodded with pointy sticks. things or steer things just by looking at them. JOHN BEASOR, WITHYWOOD, BRISTOL YOB: Yes indeed It was a wind up... but we still managed to fool a couple of software companies and more than a few readers. LONDON A WORRIED MATEY YOB: No, as far as I know there aren't any plans to Dear Yob. release a 16-bit Engine. I'M NO FOOL II Me and I bet plenty of others What's the point at the are thinking is there going to moment the Engine holds D be a 16-bit PC ENGINE.

Imagine a COUNTY DURHAM game where you could shoot EVEN MORE GAZ JOKES Here are some Garry jokes for you, Yob. He's so fat that he wears a watch on each hand, and each one's in a different time zone. He's so fat that he has to grease the sides of the bathtub. He's so fat that when he lies on the beach, some one ends up calling Greenpeace. He's so fat that when he sits around the house he sits AROUND the house.

"REVIEW ST AMIGA /////////// 17:01 STORMTROOPER LIVES: 've seen a lot of games like Stormtrooper. In fact the first game I ever saw on the ST was by Psygnosis and looked exactly like this. In summary: smoothish sort of parallel scrolling, graphics nicely detailed though not especially big and very conventional gameplay. The temptation is to say so what? But I think there is a bit more to say in Stormtrooper's favour than that. OK, so the plot lone warrier does battle with assorted moves to get right-climb this ladder, wait for that droid to go past, jump down, jump left, run right blast the first gate control, run back left... you get the picture. It's a big game, divided into several levels each of which is several hours or even days challenge in itself. There are bullets to be picked up, gate opening routines to be learned, more powerful enemies to be avoided and jumps to be practised. As you get good at Stormtrooper you find your're actually watching the action less A Yep It's Urban decay time again. ORMTROOPER SYORIYROOPER LINES: rununu and less and concentrating far more on the scanner display it becomes your lifeline. There is no other way of getting anywhere in this game. Graphically Stormtrooper doesn't really do that much me. I've seen all, or mostly all of this before. Blade Runner has a lot to answer for. Sound is goodish, it's by David Whittaker and he never actually puts in a poor performance but let's just say this one feels more conveyor belt than most. If you're looking for originality forget Stormtrooper but if you're attracted by fiendishly challenging gameplay this could be the game on which to test your arcade reflexes.

In terms of sheer challenge I've seen little to beat it all year. You don't need a plot. Played Cybernoid? That's near enough. Your man runs, jumps, squats and fires. His way is beset with various soldiers from the human, and therefore easily dispatched to the mechanical and indestructible. With some (mostly the human ones) you just have to keep blasting (but don't run out of bullets) with others (the nasty little droids in particular) all you can do is jump over them. Did I say jump? It sounds so easy. The fact is almost gave up on this game half an hour in, total destruction in under a minute is more than any cyberwarrior can stand. The droids have to be jumped at exactly the right moment -we're talking Manic Miner exact here! This is an example of the fine tuning that has gone into the game. The fact is, it is almost impossible to jump the droids by waiting until you see them and respondingyou'll go mad with frustration. Instead, what I realised half an hour was that at the bottom of the screen a little scanner tells you when a droid is on its way — watch that and jump when that tells you and maybe you'll get VIIIIIIIIIIII ST .99 GRAPHICS 67% SOUND 60% VALUE 65% PLAYABILITY 78% A Deep into the first level.

No, only joking Bio Challenge may not involve some cosmic equivalent of Nanette Newman on a cleaning mission to the stars, but it will certainly clean the cobwebs from your ears with its mind-numbingly good music. Palace's French-produced package comes from a company apparently better known for putting out records than games, Delphine. You can tell from the continuous soundtrack, which is the most impressive selection of funky beats I've heard for a long time; thrashing drums, snappy basses and enormous orchestration. Fortunately the rest of the game does not plummet below that standard; it certainly takes full advantage of the Amiga's graphics abilities, as well as its sound. Like Thexder and many more before it, Bio Challenge revolves around the adventures of a CHALLENGE I EUELS ENERGY LEVEL TWO Use the charge slabs wisely. They can be moved towards monsters if you know how, but after discharge they are useless unless you waste time by leaving the planet and returning.

LEVEL THREE Look out for the green and red cauldrons to enhance yor powers. Green armour allows you to destory any alien by leaping through icred, to turn flying aliens into deadly projectiles.

At the start of each level is an energy sphere where you must store the pieces of amulet to be found on the planet; but to find the pieces you must destroy the various gicky monsters. The best way to do this is to jump on charged platforms, which fall on the aliens from a great height; personally I'd much rather shoot them, but it's just not that type of game. Smaller flying creatures can be eliminated by spinning through them, and in later stages these become lethal weapons when activated by your special red which you must leap, and the human-to-humanoid conversion larger gaps which are too wide to graphic routine and truly leap. different gameplay make it well Jumping into a colour-coded worth seeking out.

"EVIEW AMIGA ST 71111111111 KRISTAL BY PRISM ed up with all those \"games of the film\"? Well, The Kristal is one of that extremely rare breed, the game of the very unsuccessful stage play. The complete lack of theatrical success experienced by \"The Kristal of Kronos\" is no surprise, if the unintelligible storyline that accompanies the computer adaptation is anything to go by. What is surprising is that it's billed as an epic game\". and what is even more surprising is that this claim isn't all software house bullshit. Not much, anyway. The Kristal of the title is essentially the fulcrum on which is balanced the forces of universal good and evil, or at least it was until someone pinched it a few aeons ago. Ever since, the universe has been a less than happy place and so the ruler of the planet Meltoca, Kring Narta has decided to send someone to find the Kristal and save the cosmos, etc, etc. For some reason, prime candidate for the job is a space pirate called Dancis Frake (ie you). When the game begins you have no idea where you are or what's going on, that's where your brain -and a lot of lateral thinking come in... Using the joystick, you move Dancis around the scenic landscapes of ten planets, collecting useful objects and chatting to a whole host of other characters who provide information as well as some very cryptic clues (some of which are so obscure you're likely to skip over them without realising that you're missing something). When you manage to strike up a conversation, your words of wisdom are typed into an adventure-style interpreter as smart, but they're nicely animated and very varied. Sound during the game is minimal, but The Kristal opens with some superb music and a great scene-setting sample of Patrick Moore quoting from The Kristal Kronikles. Apart from some rather tenuous puzzles to upset the applecart, I had a lot of fun with this game. There's an enormous feeling of space and loads of things to do, people to meet and Frandanas to eat. The many different arcade and adventurey elements gel very well together and even at thirty Skringles, erm, quid, The Kristal is worth selling your granny's wheelchair for. PAUL GLANCEY which is fairly comprehensive. The characters seem to pick up on certain key words and give astute replies to most queries. Clever. To go with the adventure, there's a bit of arcade action, which, it has to be said, is rather bog-standard. Travelling between planets takes you through a 3D shoot-out with the lackies of the evil Lotarr, who also make an appearance on certain planets, brandishing swords and threatening to slice and dice your extremities unless you draw your own space-cutlass and make like Errol Flynn. Losing a swordfight puts you back aboard your spaceship and knocks points off your strength rating, which you can only restore by eating one of the many space delicacies on offer.

"REVIEW C+VG HIT! UPDATE PC and ST versions will appear later on this year, and will be very similar. It's hoped that a C64 version will also see the light of day-but a release date is so far unforthcoming. OS OFI E RISING SUN entrails with a very sharp and pointy sword -hara-kiri as they way, but the basic combat and say in Nippon strategy has been improved Lords of the Rising Sun is almost beyond recognition, and without doubt a superb game. the arcade sequences have taken On the surface it looks similar to a quantum leap forward.

My favourite is the seige sequence where you take pot-shots at the marauding enemy with a bow and arroweach successful hit being rewarded with a digitised yell! But the game is far more than the sum of its parts. The whole thing hangs together brilliantly and fully recreates the atmosphere of Mediaeval Japan The gameplay is thoroughly engrossing, and I found that the hours flew by as I attempted to become Shogun. The only niggle I have (and it's the case with all Cinemaware games) is the copious amounts of disk-swapping that takes place during the game. It does get annoying, but if you're prepared to put up with it, Lords of the Rising Sun is a game that you shouldn't miss. Superb graphics, sound and gameplay are combined to produce one of the best Cinemaware games to date. It's tough, challenging and addictive and will keep potential Shoguns amused for an entire Dynasty. OVERALL 90% BESEIGED If one of your castles is attacked, grab a bow and take pot-shots at the enemy as they rush the castle. Great fun with plenty of digitised screams adding to the abbatolr-style atmosphere.

"EVIEW AMIGA ST PC C64 are a bit stick-like, not overly colourful and do not zoom about the ice at a rate of huge knots. On the upside, the controls are responsive, and the feeling of momentum as you control the Centre (the rest are played by the computer, with an option for the goalie) is impressive. Naturally, there are options to take out the opposing players, as well as the more conventional moves--but if you do this successfully you stand a chance of getting spotted by the ref and confined to the Sin Bin for a short period of time.

Well, not the real Steve, but a digital version who real thing. And after playing this new snooker simulation I'm inclined to agree... Steve Davis is a traditional computer snooker game in one respect, that the proceedings are viewed from above. There's an options bar at the top of the screen with which you can the cue, which is done by placing the cursor where you want to ball to go and pressing fire. And that's it, in a nutshell. Steve Davis Snooker is a very byt suffers from the same problems as all snooker games with aerial views-it just doesn't feel like snooker! Lining up shots is tricky, and the power bar certainly takes a lot of getting used to. Still, perseverence, as they say, reaps its own rewards. POSITION CUE POHER STEVE DAVIS SNOOKERS A Nice break! Just split up those reds a little more. try Firebird's 3D Pool-it doesn't have the options of Steve Davis Snooker, but the action is far easier to get into.

If you make it, you find that you have been separated from the rest of the party and now have to find your way on your own to THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH! Now, up to now, the game has been bits of sampled sound, good looking digitised screens of vast vistas across the windblown tundra, that kind of stuff. Neat. What happens next is the meat of the game and it's a bit thin. There is a main playing screen with a map of the earth's core on one side, icons along the bottom and a picture of you and movement cursors on the right. rocks, a bit where you have to avoid wolly mamoths stampeding down a narrow passage and a another bit where you beat off Terradactyls with a stick. None of these arcade bits will excite you for the simple reason that they're rather dull There's another bit where you wander round the bottom of the screen trying to catch drips of water to replenish your supply, but it doesn't help. There are more digitized pictures but lovely pictures do not a great game make...

"ST AMIGA REVIEW IIIIIIII Boy's ball, boy's ball. method used is 'instinctive' (a phrase borrowed from the unusually helpful instruction booklet). The only fault I can find here, and indeed anywhere in the game is the difficulty attached to manipulating the goalkeeper but even this is no great problem, as left to himself he'll usually display the cat-like skills usually associated with Peter Shilton or indeed Billy The Fish. Those who persevere should eventually find their outfield players dribbling dangerously, leaping great heights to head the ball, shooting and passing accurately, stopping the ball dead and performing every tackle in the book -and even a few that If looks were anything to go by you'd be forgiven for writing this football game off before you'd ever got around to kicking a ball ---surely a game with characters this small can't be any good. Wrong! Kick Off is probably the most playable soccer simulation in binary history. incorporating fast action, smooth eight-way scrolling and, for better or worse, most of the atmosphere of the real thing Those looking for reams of statistics and individually named teams and players will have to look elsewhere, as all that's on offer here is a pair of teams Red and Blue competing on a plain pitch for anything between 10 and 90 minutes. Like a good TV presentation, the game display follows the ball, with a small scanner screen in the top left hand corner showing the rest of the pitch in miniature. A further navigational aid is provided by a small dot which shows the direction of the goalposts There are five skill levels (from Sunday League through to International level), four team formations to choose from and the option to compete in a single game (either one or two player) or an eight team league. The League option includes a Save/Load feature. The options available may be little more than you'd expect and the display at best functional, but what makes Kick Off special are its playability and atmosphere especially when there are a couple of rabid footie supporters competing. But while there may be a place for a little Wimbledon style aggression, a touch of South American finesse usually wins out which can mean only one thing ... practice. Gaining full control of your on-screen charges may seem awkward at first, but the KICKOFF per propaganap    A Get ready! here, right down to clever and practical methods employed in the game's two 'set-piece' manoeuvres. Penalties and Corners. The techniques behind both can be practised before a match. Well Brian, football's a funny old game but at the end of the day it's all about winning. The Anco lads gave 110 per cent, played their hearts out and after 90 minutes they've got a result-the lads done marvellous. CIARAN BRENNAN aren't! Which brings us nicely onto the subject of the man in black. The usual rules of soccer apply, and there's a selection of 12 referees of varying skill to make sure that they're adhered to.

OVERALL 94% VIIIIIIIIII VIUNIIIIIII AMSTRAD .99 ADVANCED PINBALL SIMULATOR CODE MASTERS Unrealistic ball control and lack of modern pin table features result in a lacklustre game. Tetris started life on a wind-up PC clone in the Soviet Academy of Computer Sciences in Moscow. Since then it's become one of the most converted games in the history of the world, a smash-hit coin-op worldwide, and is to become a hand-held game in the near future. Why? Well, you tell us, and maybe we'll all become millionaires. But Tetris is laughably simple, infuriating and completely and utterly addictive, challenging both your mind and reflexes to their limit. It's based on the rotation of shapes as they fall down the screen. You've simply got to slot them neatly into one another to stay alive. Sounds silly, but once you start playing, we bet you won't stop. Absolutely unmissable. TIIIIIIIIII 664 .99 Brilliant to play and has a stunning 20-minute soundtrack.

It's simple, but the going is fast and furious, with he trees getting increasingly dense, and later levels shifting between night a day scenes Limited, but still highly addictive and exhilarating. IIIIIIIIIIII SPECTRUM It was a classic in its time, and the simple and addictive game still holds up today. definitely worth the dosh. If you can't quite summon up the dosh to make it out to Vegas next year, then you might as well settle for Las Vegas Casino the computer entertainment, where you an put your shirt, tie and even Comic Relief boxer shorts. on the line without losing a penny. Craps, the most addictive gambling game in the Universe, is covered (after a fashion). together with the more traditional Pontoon, Baccarat and Roulette, all under glorious joystick control. Starting off with , your target is to beat the bank and win ,000 in total. Don't expect it to be easy-as in real life, more often than not you'll be on the street at the end of the evening without a penny to your name. Fun, if you like that sort of thing. Young David Darling describes this as, \"Technically brilliant, ultra fast, infuriatingly addictive, MEGA blast 'em up! WICKED!\" Then again, he runs Code Masters. We think it's a fairly ordinary flick-screen jump and shoot game in similar style to Firebird's ageing Heartland. It's not particularly addictive, but nevertheless provides adequate blasting fodder for the money. KIL ETAD Las Vegas Casino gives you the thrills without the spills. Can't be bad.

"ARCADE ACTION An evil leader guides them in their quest to conquer the world. A The Crack Down squad. ELCOME TO A NEW LOOK ARCADE ACTION WHICH WILL GROW OVER THE MONTHS WITH MORE GAMES AND MORE INFO. THIS MONTH WE TAKE A LOOK AT SEVERAL HOT NEW TITLES INCLUDING A GAME WITH NO NAME... CRACK DOWN Brilliant two-player action tend to shot up the middle of a street, so if you've run out of firepower slide along the wall and creep up on him for a bit of one-to-one combat. Once you've planted the necessary bombs, make a run for the exit before they explode. And then it's onto the next level which is harder more enemy, more bombs and a greater challenge. Crack Down is really enjoyable. The sprites are very small but they're detailed, and It doesn't detract from the gameplay. ull marks to Sega, who've produced yet another very interesting game. Crack Down is a split screen game where one or two players charge around a section of a city, placing short fuse bombs to destroy the invading enemy. Viewed from the air, you look down on a cut away section of a city. The layout of the streets resemble a maze and a map at the top of the screen shows exactly where you are. It also marks the areas where bombs have to be laid with a big red X. A box at each side of the main map tells you what weapon power you have, how many bombs have to be placed and such vital information as whether you are secret agent Ben or special agent Andy. 2:14 ERT COIN VIIIIIIIIIIII GRAPHICS SOUND 70% VALUE GAMEPLAY 70% OVERALL 80% IIIIIIIIIII 75% 65% Rubbish names, eh? him dead, or if you haven't any the playing area is a ammo left, kick him down. magnified section of the main Ammo and weapons run out cap.

"BAY ROUTE Pretty standard stuff. I think the whole theme of the game can be summed up by the brief Instructions which say, \"How to beat the Punks Smash 'em.\" Well, that says it ay Route Could that be a play on the battleground of Beirut This offering from Sega/Sunsoft in no way matches Crack Downs playability. The impressive title scene has you screaming in to the war zone in a jump jet. Then the game starts as you leap out of the cockpit, cock your shotgun and steam into attack with a cry of 'Let's Go'. Your briefing is to infiltrate the enemy. The briefing obviously forgot to remind you to do this in stealth. A panel at the bottom of the screen displays four weapons -shotgun, grenade, flame To give you a fighting chance, pick up the weapons which the thugs drop -a knife, steel pipe or gun. These last only as long as you remain on your feet, but you can pack a hell of a wallop with the steel pipe. There's an element of silliness here too something I like and found quite surprising. Get on the wrong side of a steam roller and you're literally a chance. Motor cyclists hit you next and come whizzing in from the side of the screen to attack. The battle doesn't let up for an GAME WITH NO Ironed as flat as a pancake. Very much in the Tom & Jerry cartoon style. You're going to have to work hard at this game. I's a challenge and, once you've got the hang of the controls good fun, the graphics are reasonable and so is the sound the gameplay is above average. Noting new, but it has the edge on similar games. ighting games, punch 'em ups and the like are two-a-penny at the moment, but there's got to be something about this new game (so new it hasn't got a name yet) that's pulling the crowds. Taking a turn at the controls meant joining a queue. A one or two-player with a couple of muscular heroes bashing their way through hoardes of thugs and an assortment of deliquents. The controls take a bit of mastering as there are three fire buttons which hit in combination to produce punches, kicles and jumps.

The objective on each level is to fly right into the centre of the enemy stronghold in that particular area. This is basically a heavily defended long and winding tunnel which you have to fly down. Warnings are given for imminent twists and turns hit the sides of the tunnel and the MACHINES GALAXY FORCE II The original Galaxy Force arcade game was an early laser disk machine, and appeared back in 1983. However, by last year technology had progressed far enough to enable Sega to produce a sequel with similar gameplay and equally stunning visual and aural quality without the need of expensive and unreliable laser disk hardware. And lo, Galaxy Force Il was released the most impressive game yet to appear from the Sega stable. If you haven't seen the massive hydraulic coin-op, it's a 3D shoot 'em up, almost like Afterburner in an alien environment, but is far more complex than any of Sega's other big 3D coin-ops. The player takes control of an attack craft and fies solo missions into four heavily defended enemy territories, one of which is selected at the start of play. Each level is different, and includes heavily policed space and three planet scenes volcanic, arctic and densely vegetated. The action is viewed from behind your attack craft, and alien fighters and hazards whizz by. The enemy are blasted in two ways, either by laser fire (tricky). or by launching homing missiles at them when your automatic targetting system highlights an enemy object. Whenever the craft is hit by A The mega-carrier spacecraft whizzes overhead. Don't get too close to one of those fiery fumaroles! craft's shield is severely diminished. If you manage to reach the heart of the stronghold and destroy the target at its centre, that level is deemed complete and you can choose the next scene. The Galaxy Force Il coin-op is an impressive beast, with one 16-bit and two 32-bit processors controlling all the graphics and sound. Cramming it all into a compatitively feeble Master System must have been a nightmare, but amazingly Sega have managed to do it. Obviously corners have been cut, but overall the game has the atmosphere and playability of the arcade original. The graphics are a little jerky, but the sprites are excellent and the 3D effect is fast and convincing, particularly 092 "

"00123200 MACHINES sit a bird? Is it a 'plane? Oh darn, you only needed two guesses. Yes, the P-47 in the title is a 'plane-a World War Two fighter winging its horizontal, parallax-scrolling way over Nazi Germany, seeking to bring down the combined air naval and artillery forces of the Third Reich singlehandedly. Not an easy task you might think, and you'd be right. You start the game armed only with a piddly forward-firing machine gun, which is fine for some of your punier enemies which only need one shot before they explode into a ball of flame, but there are sturdier foes around which require multiple hits before they go down. What you need are (SURPRISE!) better w eapons, and these appear amongst blasted wreckage in collectable pods. Letters on the pods indicate 00121300 the add-on inside them. Add to your armoury with speedups, bombs, spread rockets or directional firepower, and prolong the game with the odd extra life. At the end of each stage there's the usual mega-nasty to deal with. In the case of P-47, there're impressive Luftwaffe bombers and giant Panzer tanks which bombard you with all their might until you pump several dozen rounds of ammunition into then. These guys are horrendously tough to destroy, and just surviving their barrage of fire requires lightning reflexes. Indeed, throughout the game, the odds seem quite heavily stacked against the player, and even the extra weapons don't help things as much as I would like. So, gaming novices be warned--it's going to take an awful lot of practice (and probably an auto fire joypad) just to get onto the third stage.

There are a host of cutesy sprites drawn in that distinctive Japanese \"wide-eyed\" cartoon style, and monsters are particularly attractive, especially the tiger god at the end of the first stage. Each level has its own jolly soundtrack, though none of them are going to wow the ears off you, like, say, the Dungeon Explorer or Legendary Axe music does.

It was the ongoing saga of a Buddhist priest whose bodyguards on his pilgrimage to India were a pig spirit, a fish spirit and a monkey god with a magic quarterstaff and a tame cloud. Son Son ll seems to be based on the same legend as the TV series, and just as in every episode, the pilgrimshave been kidnapped by a malevolent mystery spirit. However, the Monkey god, Son Son has somehow managed to evade capture, so it's up to him and his pointy stick to save his chums from becoming goblin chow. Basically, Son Son II is a platform game in which our ape-like hero has to cross scrolling terrain, vault over obstacles, climb vines and, of course use whatever weapons that fall to hand to do over any nasty beasts which get in his way. Horned hobgoblins, monster plants and tiny blobs beset the hapless primate, but a prod of the fire button delivers a poke in the ribs with his staff. Exploded monsters leave behind fruit and other goodies which can either bestow energy, magic power or cash, in the form of Zennies. The cash comes in handy at wayside shops, where little old ladies flog extra lives and fancy extra weapons, such as magic bombs and upgraded quarterstaffs. The magic weapons, logically enough, draw on your magic strength, so saving them for the whopper baddies is NINTENDO CONVERTERS Annoyed about all that scrummy Japanese software that's available for the Nintendo which you can't play on your UK machines?
