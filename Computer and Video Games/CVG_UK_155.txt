"CVG ED'S COMMENT DOUBLE THE POWER Sonic's in danger of losing his place as numero uno Sega star as Dynamite Headdy bursts onto the scene in one of the most original platform games ever. his month, more than any other, proves why owning several machines is a good thing. On 3DO we've seen Road Rash, which, putting it lightly, is amazing. Meanwhile Dynamite Headdy's shown that platform games don't need Sonic or Mario to be brilliant, and the latest SNES FX blast, Vortex, is pretty stunning stuff. Meanwhile the Amiga is looking healthy, despite Commodore's troubles and the PC comes good again with Inferno. Next month should see a major wave of Jag titles, which should prove any doubters that the machine's potential is massive. One machine just isn't enough. As you read this the European Computer Trade Show should have been and gone and we'll have taken a sneak peak at a 100% complete PlayStation, its games and know when the official release will be. We'll also have more news on its import release date and previews of 12800 forthcoming games such as Ridge Racer. As well as that, we should also be getting our hands on Doom 2, which is potentially one of the games of the year. We also want to hear about the kind of things you want to see in this magazine. After all, you're the people who shell out for it every month. So if you disagree with something, ZUU think anything could be improved (surely not) or just want to tell us how wonderful we are, drop us a line at the usual address.

"CVG NEWS 64-BIT BOOSTER FOR 3DO NEWS 64 BIT 3DO FR 1995 Panason A 64-Bit machine and a booster pack... future power for 3DO hese are revolutionary times in the computer and console industry and the latest news to hit our untidy desks is that a 64-Bit 3DO is in the pipeline. Codenamed Bulldog, the specs of this machine look highly impressive. For a start MPEG 1 will be built in as standard and the superior MPEG 2 will be available as an option. Considering the whole unit is planned to retail at under , which, if it happens, will be a fantastic achievment. Other enhancements include a 66Mhz processor (the current 3D0 runs two 12.5Mhz chips in parallel) and a incredible data shifting bus bandwidth of 400Mb per second, which is more powerful than a top spec Pentium PC. The best news though, is that the new package will be backwardly compatible with the current machine, and will also come in cartridge form to upgrade existing machines, so if you were thinking of buying a 3D0 now (and with some of the current releases around we don't blame you) there's no worries about getting something that will become obsolete in a year. So as if the likes of Road Rash and Twisted weren't enough, you now have even more reason to part with your cash. console kick off at last FLASH FACT interplay, reach for the Stars After an inordinate wait, Kick Off 3 is finally coming out on SNES and Mega Drive. Both version clocked in with massive scores when we originally reviewed them, and thanks to the delay, producers Imagineer have had more than enough time to improve the gameplay. State-side firm Aura are releasing their interactor vest in the UK for around . The strap on device delivers a sonic 'blow' equivalent of 20 pounds when your game character is hit. It'd probably be safer getting into a real fight. FLASH FACT ord reaches us that Interplay have extended their Star Trek licence to 1998, which means they're more than likely to be producing a game based on the forthcoming Star Trek movie, Generations. The film features both the original and Next Generation cast in a battle to save a planet from destruction at the hands of mad man called Dr Soran. Early scripts had Kirk dying at the end, but apparently there was such an outcry from the cast that this has been re-written. We'll just have to wait for the movie to find out. The deal should also cover the new Star Trek series. Voyager, which, rumour has it, has the captain's chair filled by Patsy Kensit, alleeee! fifa '95 arrives EA isn't a company to pass up an oppotunity for a sequel, which probably explains why the follow-up to the world's most successful football game is almost with us with the imminent launch of Fifa '95. As with the Madden's and Hockey series, EA have stuck pretty much to the original formula, added plenty of enhancements and improved the speed. The most notable inclusion is a proper passing feature, which includes one-touch plays. Other features include set-piece free kicks, new crowd noises and you can now nominate a player to receive the ball from throw-ins. "


"MOVIE GIANTS MEET ROCKET SCIENTISTS NEWS CVG FLASH FACT more team dreams Sega have revealed plans to bundle the Mega-CD with nine titles: Tom Cat Alley, Streets Of Rage, Golden Axe, Revenge Of Shinobi, Columns, Monaco GP, Road Avenger and Cobra command. It sounds good, but they haven't put a price on it yet. FLASH FACT rocket crashes into UK shodown at the 3DO-K corral he latest game soon to roll out from the Wakefield Hit Factory that is Team 17 will be All Terrain Racing (snappily abbreviated to ATR). King of Thieves and Witchwood. ATR is on the Amiga and will be a top down perspective racing game along the same lines as Team 17's earlier Amiga hit, Overdrive. ATR will be out in October and retail at .99. An enhanced A1200 version will arrive about three weeks later, PC owners can look forward to a conversion early next year. Also coming from Team 17 on the Amiga and CD32 IS King of Thieves, a break from tradition for the Northerners as it's a blend of arcade and strategy styles. Programmed by the talented chaps behind the Alien Breed series King of Thieves is set in mediaeval England and the strategy sec tion sees the player attempting to conquer the land piece by piece Risk style while the arcade elements are similar to the old Amiga classic Defender of the Crown and involve the likes of making pirate raids on enemy ships. If the gameplay can match the remarkable graphics this should be a prince when it arrives around Easter time next year. Once again PC floppy and CD-ROM versions should follow soon after. It's looking very good indeed, even at this early stage. Certainly one to watch out for. ritain is about to be invaded by one of the most impressive looking development houses to emerge in years. Rocket Science Games have combined the movie making talents of producers and effects experts from movies such as Jurassic Park, Rising, Sun. Conan The Barbarian, Terminator 2 and Total Recall, with games designers responsible for classics such as Rescue On Fractalus. Loom and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Among their first games will be Loadstar, a science fic tion tale of smuggling and double dealing written and designed by Ron Cobb, who's also worked on films such as True Lies and Aliens. It stars Ned Beatty in the lead role who looks older and fatter than ever. Around about the same time we should also be seeing Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, based on the hugely popular Mark Schultz graphic novels. Both games look really mindblowing and should be appearing here in the very near future for PC CD-ROM and Mega-CD with more versions to follow. the witching hour FLASH FACT FLASH FACT Still no noise from Nintendo central as to when they're going to release Streetfighter 2 over here. Latest rumours point to somewhere around Easter next year, here's hoping. In the mean time our money's on Kombat 2 for top SNES cart at Chrimble. FLASH FACT Moneybags Microsoft are planning to bring global computing a step closer with the unveiling of monsterously huge plan to launch some 837 communcations satellites in the next six years. A total space network maybe, but we'll see it, then believe it. FLASH FACT he excellent Neo Geo beat-'em-up Samurai Shodown is almost complete on 3DO. It's got all the features of the original, including close-ups when the fighters come together and all the moves and speed too. With Super Streefighter Turbo also coming to 3DO, it looks like it could soon be the top 32-Bit machine for beat-'em-ups. Hopefully we'll be able to bring you more news on both games next month. eam 17 are gearing up to bring their Zelda-esque adventure Witchworld to the A1200, CD32, PC and CD-ROM. Breaking from tradition the graphics are humorous and not the gloomy dark style that usually litter RPGstyle arcade adventures, while the CD versions will be talkie rather than text based like their floppy counterparts. Again this will be out around Easter time next year. Contact Team 17 (0924 291 867) for more information. 2003 SFORMATIONS STRATEGY Hazio "

"CVG NEWS ALL THE NEW GAMES NEWS I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE! Here's where CVG tells you what games are likely to be hot in the coming months keep an eye out for most of these around Christmas time. PGA TOUR GOLF 486 / EA / PC-CD EA's taken their classic PGA Tour Golf and added a superb new graphical engine for 3D terrain, similar to US Gold's Links games. The CD will also include two new courses and an easier to use control system. Expect FMV clips too. Myst / Sunsoft 1 MCD A conversion of the ultra-challenging PC and Mac adventure game. It features really smart graphics, and some of the best questing action we ve ever seen. The music is particularly atmospheric. It's without a doubt our top adventure of the year. Baby's Day Out / Hi-Tech 1 GB Based on the rather sad movie of the same name, this game is about a bunch of bad guys trying to save the baby they've kidnapped. It's a typical platform game, although the cart will also take advantage of the Super Game Boy's colour and sound enhancing features Kartoon Kombat / Technos/ MD This is a cute looking beat 'em-up which isn't likely to offer anything new but does look a laugh all the same. Has that sort of cheap American cartoon look. Ballz / PF Magic / SNES You can find a review of the excellent Mega Drive version of Ballz on page 91. Graphically very fast and unusual enough to be worth a look, let's hope the SNES game matches the MD one for gameplay Beethoven Hi-Tech / PC Featuring a free comic book this game of the movie looks like being better than the rather smelly SNES version. You control Beethoven on a quest to find his puppies before he gets sent to the doghouse. Popeye's Beach Vollyball / Technos / GG Well, this is vollyball as you know and love it, but with the addition of the Popeye characters. You might even be able to perform special moves after eating a can of spinach. We can only wait and see. Shien's Revenge / Vic Tokai / SNES Imagine Operation Wolf but with Ninjas and you'll have a good idea of what this is all about. Basically dash around and jab people to death. Not original at all, but if the scrolling's good it should be fun. Wolverine / Marvel Software SNES The claw-wielding comic character gets his own scrolling hack-'emup with guest apperences by the X-men. Features everything you'd expect in this sort of game and should be quite appealing considering the popularity of the comic. Zephyr / New World Computing / PC Wolfenstein Club Drive | Imagineer | Atari / I MD Jaguar It's been out on This speedy vec many formats tor-based driving already, but this game is like Mega Drive version Micro Machines SCORE ITCH won't go a miss. meets Hard Wolfenstein is the Drivin'. It uses fast vector graphics for the terforerunner to Doom so you can imagine how rain and loads of wild locations to tax your driviolent it is and the sort of smooth 3D scrollingving skills. It's still a fair way of completion, but to expect it's looking good all the same. Here's one game we're really interesting in seeing Zephyr is a head-on shoot-'em-up with high-speed rendered graphics and maze-like terrains. It will also feature a link-up for five players. Very smart. 12 "

The game itself looks and plays like Shadow of the Beast and Alien 3 in places, but there's plenty more original sections like a helicopter fight which features giant sprites and an excellent Tyrannosaurus Rex chase scene.

"CVG FEATURE THE RETURN OF THE LUCASARTS the lucas empire strikes back LucasArts is to games what Mr Kipling is to cakes. What it makes is, indeed, of exceedingly good quality. And CVG went to visit the phenomenal software producers in babesville USA, California, and found a brace of top new titles in the pipeline, let the force guide you through the next five pages... 101 runs parallel to the main interstate highway connecting southern California to the other Pacific states. It runs south from San Francisco and north, through clusters of suburban wealth and wide open space, to the Great Crater lake in Oregon. Forty minutes drive from San Francisco is San Rafael: an identikit, west coast new town and a fairly inauspicious setting for the software arm of one of Hollywood's most successful businessmen. George Lucas founded LucasArts in 1982 in-between making Raiders of the Lost Ark and Return of the Jedi. It's part of his tight-knit entertainment group, which also includes special effects producers, Industrial Light & Magic, its aural equivalent, Skywalker Sound and Lucasfilm itself. Each branch is a separate business but shares a vision for old-fashioned storytelling via the digital sounds and images. Lucas To what extent does George Lucas get involved in producing games? At a business level he chairs the monthly board meeting between the various heads of his companies and LucasArts toes the softly softly Lucas line on violence. Yet, despite its Hollywood pedigree, the company has, with the exception of Rebel Assault, deliberately avoided moving into the realm of Full Motion Video and 'interactive movies'. Why? In an upbeat Californian kind of way, all of the staff at LucasArts love games, love George and George is \"pretty well hands off\" with regards to the day-to-day running of the business (although allegedly he is a bit of a dab hand when it comes to tweaking the games, since he suggested close-ups and panning 20 "


"THE RETURN OF THE LUCASARTS FEATURE FEATURE CVG LL LUCAS rt s. The only time that LucasArts bucked the trend was when a TV series was made of the madcap family from the 1987 game, Maniac Mansion. Usually, of course, the forays are from film to game. shots in Rebel Assault). It's acknowledged however that LucasArts has much to live up to. If it ever got into interactive movies, its work would inevitably and perhaps unfairly be compared to that of Lucasfilm. So the more games look like films the more Mr Lucas is likely to be involved. That moment may happen sooner than LucasArts admits. Compare the following extracts: the first from a speech by Randy Komisar, President of LucasArts Entertainment, given at The International Conference and Exposition on Multimedia and CD-ROM in March this year: \"We watch films and we play games. And therein lies the obvious crux of difference between film and interactive entertainment today. I can't imagine sitting on my hands and watching a game roll by for two hours. The fun of a game is my involvement. Film runs straight off a reel, not requiring complex compression and decompression that can reduce speed and resolution... in contrast, in the interactive entertainment area the delivery platforms are confusingly diverse, and they're fragmenting further all the time. It seems somewhat unproductive to focus on making interactive entertainment just like movies.\" difference But contrast this to George Lucas' comments during a TV cable debate in San Francisco two months later: \"I've been in the games business for 15 years and I'm a storyteller, I make movies. People will always want to have a story told to them and they will like to play games where you have some control over the outcome. There'll be movies and there'll be games and the games will look like movies\". They aren't necessarily saying different things, but the change of emphasis is. LucasArts now allude to technological innovations that may close the gap between film and games (possibly using techniques like Acclaim's Advanced Technology Group's developments in FMV-like animations, see CES report in Computer and Video Games, issue 153). And it wouldn't require too much crystal ball gazing to predict that the games of the next round of Star Wars films will indeed be like films in their own rights.

There's a ritual taking place around a Pepsi cup lying on one of the desks of the Full Throttle team at LucasArts' offices. The cup lies in the centre of a studiously cleared space surrounded by torn-up strips of dog-eared Post-it notes that have been arranged and rearranged until they form a pattern that makes sense. A film has formed on the ageing, now-still contents of the cup. The few splashes of Pepsi that stain the Post-Its are long-dried. Someone on the team has been working long hours trying to make sense of a problem... Problems can take ages to solve. CD has raised the expectations of gamesplayers to such an extent that games may now take immense amounts of time to make, as programmers stack ever-more complex graphics routines. For the sake of realism, however, LucasArts' next CD-ROM adventure, Full Throttle uses a mixture of 2D and 3D images that have actually been under-rendered. Even so, Full Throttle has been one of LucasArts' lengthiest projects to date. Tim Schaber, Project Manager, explains: \"We've gone beyond the stage of CD-ROM sound being edited in at postproduction; now we work from pre-scripted dialogue and effects and the imagery and storyboarding comes later. That just slows down the process.\" sound bytes Jack Sorenson, Director of Business Opportunities at LucasArts, believes that far more software companies ought to be looking at the potential of sound in CD games, rather than getting hung-up on graphics just as in the film world the input of Skywalker Sound is often overshadowed by the FX Whizbangs of Industrial Light and Magic. And there's THX... which has added a whole new dimension to cinema-going; it's more than likely that LucasArts is spending time with the Home THX research and development team, and LA PEOPLE From left to right, Justin Chin, Lead Artist on Dark Forces, Jack Sorenson, Director of Business Opportunities, LucasArts; Tim Scaber, Project Leader, Full Throttle; Larry Ahern, Lead Animator, Full Throttle, Randy Komisar, President of LucasArts ele "


"THE RETURN OF THE LUCASARTS FEATURE CVG skywalker sound will come up with new possibilities for sound quality in games. Whatever lies ahead, however, right now the samples used in Full Throttle are thoroughly impressive. LucasArts describe Full Throttle as being its most cinematic game to date: 'a visual adventure featuring a born loser punching it out on the road using Rebel Assault technology'. The familiar cartoonlook is present, but the overall tone and the plot is darker. As Larry Ahern, lead animator for the game, says: \"We wanted to develop a storyline around a Hell's Angel type of biker, so inevitably Full Throttle's going to be a little murkier than our previous games.\" Skywalker Sound has been prominent in the work of Lucasfilm, and now there's talk of the division being used to record orchestral and rock tracks for games. LucasArts feels that sound in CD is vastly underused. In 1991 the company patented iMuse, which allows a game's music and sound effects to respond smoothly to unpredictable player choices. Recently, it has invested time in refining techniques for background noises. darker forces Darker yes, but LucasArts is unlikely to ever release an 18 certificate game. Says Randy Komisar: \"Gratuitous violence has no real purpose. We try to make sure that the fighting does have some impact in the game itself but does not result in what we would consider gratification of violence itself.\" Indeed, the rather Doom-ish Dark Forces is about as goreless as you can get. It pits you against 20 types of foe, including a new breed of robotic super stormtrooper. And you wouldn't expect to find giblets sprayed all over the place in a game based upon a family film, and don't worry you don't get them. You're equipped with nine weapons and a map of the Death Star, which is used to locate the production centre of the cyborgs. All of the baddies are put into what are termed 'target cones', which means that you don't have to be a total expert to slay them, just make sure you hit them in an approximately lethal place. Currently, however, there are no plans to make the game multi-player. 23 "

SUAR SWARS new wave President Randy Komisar has been at the centre of this 'culture of excellence and storytelling since the early days of the company. A tall feller with a big marine's build, he looks a little like the Robert Duvall character from Apocalypse Now. You expect him to open his mouth and talk about burning napalm, but he's actually an incredibly nice guy. Like many games publishers he's a bit bemused by the current upheaval in the hardware market and he's sceptical about developments in games-on-demand and the whole notion of the trendy 'information super highway'. Thinking practically, he expects to see a growth in multiplayer games, CD-ROM and seems set to commit to a number of the new platforms, but not all. «Clearly right now, with the number of competitors out there everyone from Nintendo and Sega, PCs, Atari there is a very confusing set of standards for developers.\" However as next year pans out it's certain that LucasArts will continue to exploit its highly profitable mine of Star Wars licences.

The process by which Primal Rage's monsters were created was complex, but from what we've seen so far, the results certainly justify the brain-strain. The final product looks and feels unlike anything we've seen before. If the controls are as responsive as the graphics are awe-inspiring, Primal Rage will truly take some beating. And good luck to the softco that tries to convert this for even the hottest of the new home systems. It ain't gonna be easy... n this very page you are witnessing some of the most astonishing and costliest high-tech innovation ever harnessed for a videogame. Primal Rage, the joint brainchild of producer Dennis Harper and animator Jason Leong, was developed using production techniques more familiar to Hollywood than Silicon Valley. Among the 30strong production team were experts in 'stopmotion' animation and movie monster building. The result is a cast of prehistoric game characters that move and fight on-screen with breathtaking realism. There's no shortage of gore either: not only do the dinos tear each other to A T Rex stomps up to Talon and the rumble in the jungle kicks off. Firstly the animator, Jason Leong, designed seven characters, some based on real dinosaurs, like T Rex, others imaginary hybrids, such as Armadon (a combo of triceratops, ankylosaurus and stegosaurus) and Talon (a deinonychus with a touch of tiger) because the gameplay A QUICK LESSON IN DINO DEXTERITY.., required all the dinos to mobile three-dimensional be standing upright. puppet.

This is one hell of a game(s)... KANELLES 5:52 ike many of you I thought Sonic 3 would be 'it' as far as the series goes. After all, how can you improve on near perfection? In a number of ways if what I saw at Sega HQ is anything to go by. Firstly Sonic & Knuckles will be backwardly compatible with Sonic 2 and 3. See the boxout later in this preview for more details on what changes this new cart makes to your older Sonic classics. Of course there'll be a whole new 18 meg game with six new gigantic worlds to play through too.

There's plenty of new tunes to look forward to as well, Knuckles' is particularly catchy. And thankfully there's lots of fresh scenery paraphernalia to interact with, like a lifting device and mushroom trampolines. Sonic & Knuckles is playing very well and is shaping up to be a classic, in a spiky-blue, hedgehog. type wonderful way. Y A Aboard Dr Robotnik's airship is the setting for the Flying Battery Zone. A Once again Dr Robotnik is not very difficult to dispense with, the only trouble comes in avoiding his thrown obstacles. Use this double-handed lift to reach higher levels. It's slow and can leave Sonic & Knuckles prone to attack though. ANOTHER FAB TITLE SEQUENCE! The title sequence in Sonic 3 was excellent but the one in Sonic & Knuckles is even better, and thankfully you won't miss it if you blink! Sonic drops slowly down from the top of the screen and is joined by Knuckles. Listen out for perhaps the most catchy Sonic tune yet as well.

Sadly we aren't allowed to show you shots just yet, but rest assured we've played it and here's what happens. A The bonus sequence from Sonic 3 is back, but it's been made much tougher. There are now yellow jewels which bounce you high into the air and the blue ones are not as easily placed as before. A revamped bubblegum machine bonus section also makes an appearance. Sonic 2: No great shakes, you can now play the game as Knuckles as well as Sonic and Tails. These revolving platforms are tricky, because they also spin across the screen. It's the crazy all new Sandopolis Zone! SONIC LES KNUCKLES 7 SONICS Sonic 3: Again, you can play as Knuckles but the levels are vastly different and feature new music tracks. Knuckles can glide and climb walls which means you'll be able to get to new areas which Tails could see but never had the stamina to make it to.

Anyway, he has his own intro where he's shown snoozing away until Dr Robotnik bombs him. Cue Knuckles cursing him as Robotnik flies off. Knuckles' levels are packed full of dangerous spikes to mare sure things aren't too easy with his gliding and climbing advantages. Like Zool, Knuckles can climb, which makes things a lot easier for reaching those bonus-strewn difficult-toget-to places With an enhanced graphic engine from Sonic 3, the graphics and parallax backgrounds in Sonic & Knuckles are perhaps the best yet. Again, Dr Robotnik isn't too tricky to destroy at this end-of-act section, the problem comes in trying to avoid the obstacles. A One of the new additions are these giant mushrooms which Sonic & Knuckles can jump on to reach higher levels. A Sonic must be lowered carefully in this section to avoid all the flames burning fiercely around him. Knuckles can also glide which is great for jumping off high platforms and drifting past baddies on lower levels. HAS KNUCKLES REALLY BECOME SONIC'S FRIEND? WAIT AND SEE... 34 "

ON DRINKING: Drink is a slow poison, but I'm in no hurry. Road Rash has won the race for CVG's first 'HIT' stamp on a next generation console game. Let us explain why... acing games are always a good bet for showing off a console's capabilities. However, the first 3DO game, Crash 'n' Burn, didn't quite achieve its aim; it was slow, the controls felt foul (and it contained some naff FMV). This is a problem which plagued most early 3D0 games in fact, with disc access being a particular sore point. Playing Road Rash you forgive the 3DO its teething problems. A game is only as good as its programming, and with Road Rash it's encouraging to see what can be achieved this early on in 3DO's track record. Faced with a CD game which plays like a cartridge, Road Rash suddenly suggests that coin-op standards have reached the home. To explain this game is perhaps initially trivial — you can see it's a race game. Yet, the appeal of Road Rash is that you get to knock opponents off their bikes while avoiding similar treatment. All the time you're pursued by police and there's on-coming traffic to avoid too. Taking split-second risks is what this game is all about. Gaming entertainment at its best. RIK LIFE AT HOME: There's so much dust in my place the cockroaches use stilts. TOP CHAT-UP LINE: Isn't it a magical night? The moon is out, and so are my parents.

JULIE LIFE AT HOME: My place is so messy vandals break in to decorate. TOP CHAT-UP LINE: You're just my type you're a bloke. FAVOURITE INSULT: Try not to speak your mind it somewhat limits the conversation. GREATEST FEAR: Admitting I'm really a bloke. ON DRINKING: I'm particular about what I drink. It has to be liquid.

(she's Australian) FAVOURITE INSULT: Listen, when I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. GREATEST FEAR: Getting stuck in the lift when Rik farts. ON DRINKING: I drink to excess.

VERDICT SECOND OPINION This is the Mega Drive game but it's been vastly enhanced. The graphics engine is like Crash 'N' Burn's but more polished; the texture mapping is fantastic, only Daytona arcade beats it. It has none of the flaws of a traditional CD game; the controls are responsive, it plays well and bloody fast and you can drive off the sides of the road as much as desired. There's loads of great grunge music too! This is EA's best 3D0 game yet and a good enough reason to buy the machine. RIK SKEWS 3DO Welcome to the game which is probably going to persuade you to buy a 3DO. Road Rash is the first game on any of the new consoles which lives up to my expectations of what a 32-bit (or 64-bit) game experience should be like. Road Rash is a good-game concept by default, but the 3DO's texture mapped graphics and smooth 3D speed have made it worthy of a coin-op. The controls are responsive and the exhilaration believable. In short, this looks good and plays better chase it.

"CVG REVIEW CAN YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD? MEGA DRIVE PLATFORM UNCONFIRMED OUT OCTOBER NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Top programmers Treasure come up with an epoch-making platform game that looks set to give Sonic a run for his money, coins or any other type of collectable... YNAMITE HEADDY espite being programmed by the top team behind Gunstar Heroes, and not Sega itself, Treasure's latest character and platform game, Dynamite Headdy, looks very much like it could become a very bright new star for Sega. Headdy himself is instantly appealing, and gets his name from the fact that he has a variety of heads to wear. This comes in very handy because although the game is predominately platform based, there's a healthy sprinkling of puzzles which must be solved. Thankfully they don't need to be solved in a linear fashion, and it's not a case of if the wrong head is picked progress is hampered. Generally there are three heads for Headdy to choose from when a puzzle is encountered, and all of them enable him to make headway through the rest of the level, although of course some choices will make the path to the end of the game more difficult than others. Watch out for Beau when confronting bosses. He'll point out their weak points. Headcase hangs around with a choice of heads when Headdy encounters a boss or a puzzle. As with the puzzles there's a better head than others to beat a boss. HEADS UP DISPLAY SCENE SEENE BOMB HEADDY BUDDA HEADDY HAMMER HEADDY INVISIBLE HEADDY Dynamite Headdy is the perfect companion for a crossword enthusiast because he's great at solving puzzles.

"CVG REVIEW CAN YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD? This might be 'just' a platform game but there's a remarkable depth and variety to the game, and there's no repetition. Each level presents a completely new challenge to master and new skills to learn. BEE === ====== A Here's an example of the game's creativity. A fairly large boss appears which is enough of a shock but before he can be attacked, an even larger one crushes it and it's this one which must be fought. The game is set in True Land, which basically looks like a giant theatre set. When things get violent the backgrounds often collapse revealing stage props behind. Brilliant! SECOND OPINION I VERDICT ROLL OF HONOUR Just as in Dynamite Headdy, Treasure proved that it could take a tired old format in this case the shoot-'em-up) and break the mould. A spectacular blaster, Gunstar Heroes still looks the business today. As far as I'm concerned it's goodbye Sonic and hello Dynamite Headdy. Headdy is far more imaginative than most other Sega platformers, and the graphics are fabulously animated. Rather than just exploring a level the different heads mean you can play various sections in a variety of ways as different parts of a level are accessed. The challenges are slightly harder than those in Sonic so this really is a game you'll need to use your head in! Great bosses too. DENIZ AHMET MEGA DRIVE Gunstar Heroes ISSUE 142 . 92% MEGA DRIVE Dynamite Headdy breathes new life into this stale genre.

"CVG REVIEW THE WALLS HAVE EARS 3DO ADVENTURE .99 OUT NOW PC VERSION ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED ALONE IN THE DARS Dr Hauzer stole the Alone in the Dark angle on adventure games for 3D0; the only problem was that it was crap. Here's how it should have been done... he game which stunned the PC world has made the switch to 3D0 with ease. Yes, Alone in the Dark is a heavy adventure game, but it plays like an action game because you get full freedom of movement in a 3D world. At first you find many locked doors hindering your way, but the way to open them is rarely obvious some need keys but most require you to solve puzzles elsewhere. Finding new objects (sometimes hidden within other objects) and discovering their uses is critical to play. The gameplay is based on a classic haunted house storyline: as either a male or female character you're asked to explore, fight and collect objects in a bid to investigate the terrible secret of the Dereceto home and the suicide of its owner. Alone In The Dark creates an atmosphere rare in adventure games and this is mainly thanks to its quirky use of roving camera angles. See it to believe it. There are many rooms to explore in the game but some just aren't open until you solve a puzzle or collect a key. You Find A First Aid Case If you have no weapon you can use your hand and feet. This is the fastest method of defence but it is also the slowest in killing your opponents. When you find an object it automatically zooms in for you to collect. Some objects have others concealed inside so remember to check. If an object is rubbish you can always throw it as a weapon. Quirky camera angles give this game unique atmosphere. Moody stuff. NO NEED TO FEEL ALONE An Old Indian Cover Get right into the action with our solution to the first room in the house. You need all the collectables in this room, but in most of the others you only need to find the key items. There are a lot fake objects. ASIL 1. First, stop the monsters entering the room by push ing the cupboard in front of the window.. 2. ... and do the same with the chest over the trap-door on the floor. 3. Open the chest and take the rifle for use later. 4. Go and take the rug out of the cupboard. This is for the Indian painting later on.

"THE WALLS HAVE EARS REVIEW CVG gos Under the house is a huge cavern and this is where you complete the game. Shown here is the wrong entrance to the caves that monster will have you. This is one of the hardest rooms to get through in the early part of the game. It's full of zombies who gang up on you. Use your rifle from the loft. A Move the block to slide across the barrels and enter the cave. Some objects need to be searched to find anything. I wonder what's in that pile of coal? VERDICT Each time you die you get dragged to the caves and placed on a floating bed. You're put to rest on the same place that you need to put the talisman to finish the game. SECOND OPINION 3DO After the tragic Dr. Hauzer I was sceptical about how this would perform. No need, though, because this is a spot on conversion from the PC original, and it runs at a speed comparable to a 486 33mhz PC. The sound is the biz in this version and the only difference is that you can't have as many saved-game positions as the PC. Alone is an excellent game but there are too many collectables which are of no use in the game. I'd prefer it if this had been the sequel. DENIZ AHMET It's good to see that Infogrames hasn't made any changes from the PC version. They must have been tempted to tart it up a bit, but the original game was so strong it really didn't need it. This is what Doctor Hauzer should have been (see last issue), it's involving, well presented, fast, fluid and fun. The balance between exploration, puzzle solving and action is just right which is what makes this such a good game. Let's hope the sequel is converted real soon.

"CVG REVIEW HOLD THE ANCHOVIES! CD32 LUTIL PIVIL ARCADE PUZZLER .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS ALSO PLANNED CD-1, PC, AND PC CD-ROM VERSIONS AVAILABLE It's bad enough waiting half-anhour for a greasy student biker to deliver a cold pizza but at least you don't have to enter the underworld for one... One of the problems with Litil Divil is that most of the puzzles require little skill to solve, it's simply a case of trial and error. Here for instance all that's required is to learn in which order to pull the ropes. ew things are worse than pulling the short straw. It generally means having to do something nobody else wants to. For Mutt the Litil Divil, hero of this game, that short straw requires him to enter the doom laden labyrinth of chaos and retrieve the mystic pizza of plenty. The short straw's made even worse by the fact that no other Divil has succeeded before. For Mutt to change this he'll have to wander through a repetitive and seemingly never-ending maze-like corridor which branches this way and that, avoiding all the pitfalls along the way. At regular points doors appear, these lead to one of numerous arcade puzzle sequences. The reward for completing or solving them is generally an item which must be used elsewhere. Complete all the puzzles and it's pizza all round. Fancy a game of tennis? Then you're in luck 'cos there's a match to play in Litil Divil! VERDICT 2966 3400 CD32 I've one word for Litil Divil, booooooring. It starts off well with cartoon style graphics and Legacy of Sorasil style music, but it's a different matter when you actually play the game. The corridor section is extremely repetitive and most of the puzzles are frustratingly difficult, and like Dragon's Lair one mistake usually leads to failure. Litil Divil has been in development for nearly three years, it's a pity it couldn't have stayed there longer. RIK SKEWS Here Mutt must ride the bull rodeo style. Should he stay on for long enough (and believe me it's not easy) he'll be rewarded with a gun which is used in a shootout later on. Mutt will come across more than a few gold coins during his journey. Use them to buy items needed to solve puzzles that have already been encountered. THERE'S NO A LOT HAPPENING IS THERE? A good proportion of the game takes place in these corridors which are very repetitive and boring. Believe it or not these are pictures from three different corridors in the game. Look carefully at the third picture and you'll probably notice something on the ground. These are traps which are very annoying as they are usually sprung if you make just the slightest mistake. Pixel perfect manoeuvring is required. This is where Mutt starts the game. This baddie must be dispensed with to progress further. Thing is there's little challenge because you can't be killed here.

The responsive controls and three-quarter viewpoint still separate it from conventional shoot-'em-ups and it's taxing too. The subtle strategy element means you have to think before you fire but not that much. So what if it has all the subtlety of a drink-heavy dog sniffing a lamppost, bring on the terrorists, I've just reloaded.

"CVG REVIEW IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE SNES SHOOT-'EM-UP     ER NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Power-up your fingers for a potential SONY smash and it's all thanks to the new Super FX chip. VORTEX hen Nintendo announced the creation of an enhanced Super FX chip, Vortex was destined to be the first game to take advantage of it. Created by the team who gave you the first FX game, Starwing, programmers Argonaut have, in Vortex, seemingly pushed the SNES to the limit of it's 3D capabilities. However, Stunt Race FX beat it off the mark, coming out first and showing just what the chip was capable of. Technically, though, Vortex is head and robot shoulders over its Nintendo cousin. The mathematical complexity is evident from the moment you realise that you're given freedom to wonder anywhere in the game field. Where Starwing limited you to set paths through the scenery, Vortex wants you to explore anything visable. To do this you're given four vessels which you can morph to, each of which is better suited to different combat situations. Varying terrains are presented in the structure of seven worlds, and within these rests the aim of the game reuniting five pieces of the Al Core which keeps all evil locked neatly up in another dimension. Make no mistake, Vortex Is a shoot'em-up, but it's the freedom to explore, collect and use items that sets it apart from most other SNES blasters. 113 DU .: LEE A Collecting keys gives you access to underground maze stages where other collectables are lurking. RO: 2: 0 : SPRUGEU TE DEHRTEHO In the underground maze you have to watch out for hidden traps which flip up unexpectedly.

"IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE REVIEW CVG THE REAL VIRTUA FIGHTER There are plenty of training stages in this game which you really would be wise to take advantage of. Obviously, you get unlimited weapons and energy. MEAN MACHINES In Vortex you control the Morphing Battle System (MBS). It can take on four different forms, which are suited to specific jobs: WALKER This is the default shape of the MBS. It walks and comes with four different weapons, some of which have limited ammo. You have to be in Walker mode if you want to pick-up a collectable. LAND BURNER This car is super fast and armed with twin cannons. It can also jump over large gaps making it ideal for any surface. 500 HARD SHELL This is a painfully slow vessel but it's the best to approach bosses with. It is impregnable to enemy fire and carries smart bombs. When not under attack it also refuels the MBS with solar power. 128 SONIC JET The fastest of the MBS forms drinks fuel rapidly so should only be used for reaching inaccessible places. Its armedwith a laser and cannon The target cross-hairs can be set to auto-lock or manual control. A Pressing L and left or right on the pad spins your character round for a view like this. Equivalent to the over-theshoulder glance in flight sims.  THE CONCEPT FOR VORTEX CAME FROM MICHAEL POWELL WHO PREVIOUSLY WROTE SUBWAR 2050 FOR PC. THIS IS HIS FIRST SNES EFFORT AND WHAT A GREAT WAY TO MARK A DEBUT. 27 "


"CVG REVIEW IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE 1200 St-stst-stages There are seven stages in the Vortex quest. Here's a glimpse of each one. Go for it. 9300 VOLTAIR Use the Land Burner to get past the floating asteroids which make up this air world. Platforms crumble benieth you and there's a very hard boss. HALKER VORTEX ONE On route to the first planet the action is simply about blasting a path through. Set in space, this stage is fast paced. Hard boss for a first stage too. VORTEX TWO Similar to the first stagebut with more enemies attacking you. It's a bit faster too and be prepared for some tough supply ships THERMIS Set in a desert the problem here is attack from big ships with heavy fire power. Make efficient use of your MBS forms and you should make it through. 2000 CRYSTON This is an ice planet so the enemy tend to be well camoflaged. There's not too many baddies however, so you should complete this stage easily. TRANTOR You've reached your goal. Here is where the collected pieces of Al Core must be assembled to complete the game. Don't expect it to be easy. MAGMENO This stage features the best background graphics and is distinctive with its many volcanoes. Lots to shoot. WOULD YOU OBJECT?

"IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE REVIEW CVG 51900 The first boss in the game is very difficult. Rotating at high speed, the boss ship relentlessly bombards you with well aimed fire. Use the Hard shell mode to avoid getting hit and then morph into the Walker to shoot as the baddie backs-off. DE aa99 A You get a close-up view of the action unless there's an enemy near by. In this instance the perspective shifts backwards. SECOND OPINION Although there is more variety in this than Starwing, I'd say Starwing is a better play. The controls in Vortex are comfortable yet fiddly to use, so while you're waiting to transform in the thick of battle you tend to get blasted a lot. Vortex is also one of the hardest games to appear this year, especially as there are no continuation points in a level. The best thing here is the way all the different crafts provide many tactics to get through a level you can experiment a lot. Overall, a complex game that's a very essential buy. MARK PATTERSON A A good tactic to learn is that you can jump and shoot baddies hiding behind blocks. A Explore new levels in HardShell mode so you don't die. COMING SOON VERDICT Jumping is a good way to get around quickly and avoid enemy fire. On later levels there are also gaps to leap over. SNES Starwing 2 Nintendo More or the same essentially but it's expected to feature a simultaneous two player option thanks to a split screen feature. EXPECTED RELEASE: EARLY 95 ALTERNATIVE MEGA-CD Silpheed Game Artsy/.99 This vector based space shoot-'em-up went down well at the time. It certainly looks good, and it's challenging to boot. Not as varied as most cartridge-based SEU'S. ISSUE 142: 85% SNES Again, the SNES proves itself worthy in the face of 32 and 64-bit competition. While we wait eagerly for Starwing 2, Vortex could quite easily make us forget about it. While not as smart to watch as Stunt Race FX, Vortex has all the atmosphere which gave Starwing its appeal. Being able to travel anywhere and change shape works brilliantly, lending real depth to play and offering many tactics. The controls take getting used to, but this is a rock-solid purchase all the same.

"FANG-TASTIC! REVIEW CVG ISNES SPIKE McFANG ROLE PLAYING GAME .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED PIKE Dress Zelda up as Dracula and make him run around splatting bits of garlic in this cute tale of evil things. f these screenshots look familiar then you may be one of the privileged few who saw this game on import a year ago, when it went under the name of \"Dracula Kid'. The Japanese cart was difficult to get hold of because only a limited number were manufactured. Now the American version's arrived the pop up speech in this Zeldastyle RPG is legible to non-Jap speakers. Spike McFang will appeal to anyone who enjoyed the Zelda series. It's an overhead scrolling affair and the action bits are very prominent, and they only occasionally require the assistance of popup text to guide you on along your path. This game is infested with visual jokes, and there are plenty of collectable and innate power-ups which add some humour to the cuteness. 000G At the start of the game you have to perform a series of agility tests which get you used to the various talents of Spike. VERDICT 02 These scrolling stages are quite easy. Remember to jump over the fish. Press SELECT and your inventory pops up. Here you decide which magic card to use, and later on which friend you'd like to assist you. SNES RPGs don't have to be dull and slow moving, and Spike is proof positive of this. The combo of visual jokes, exploration and scenery interaction makes you forget you're playing an RPG. It rides high on the feeling of discovery, with just enough of the game revealed to keep you going. The only problem is that your energy bar is diminished far too quickly from enemy attack, which is a real pain given the sparsity of continue points. DENIZ AHMET 0026 Spike's pet helps him out in difficult moments. SPIKI 000G Tvr0002 Siin SPIKE 03 032 032 You can collect loads of power-up cards that can be used to great effect.

"CVG REVIEW GRECIAN 2000 APPLE MACINTOSH LADVENTURE .99 LOUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE PC CD-ROM VERSION PLANNED The Greeks gave the world some of the best stories ever, then introduced us to the wonder of the kebab. now all that's come to CD-ROM... K, so the game doesn't feature any kebabs which could have been a major let-down. However, there's enough in the way of Greek myths, stunning video footage, gameplay and ham acting to make this a very decent adventure indeed. It really is chiché-ville though. Lots of Greek men running around in togas, gods materialising saying things like 'You have done well, mortal' and Die, you fool'. This lends the game an interesting Bmovie angle, which is helped by the schoolpanto acting. It's probably completely unintentional, and the production crew probably managed to keep straight faces during filming, but it makes the game more fun anyhow. WRATH OF THE GODS VERDICT It's almost impossible to get killed in the game, even when old Skyron boots you off a cliff all you have to look forward to is a brief stop in the underworld before trotting off home for some dolmas in chilli sauce. APPLE MAC This game is reminiscent of the Spectrum classic adventure The Hobbit. The puzzles are rudimentary, and they're made easier since you can see what's going on, and there aren't many different commands. In many ways, though, these are the things that made this game so enjoyable and are off-set by the great number of locations and characters in the game. Hardened adventurers will need to play with the help mode off, but if you're new to this genre, it's a brilliant laugh. MARK PATTERSON COMING SOON PC CD-ROM Wrath of the Gods Luminaria The PC CD-ROM version of Wrath is actually finished, all that remains is to sort out a few compatibility problems and it's ready to hit the shelves. The game itself is identical to the Mac version, so it's well worth looking out for. EXPECTED RELEASE: NOVEMBER PIOT A Bad acting is a feature in almost every CD-ROM movie game and Wrath Of The Gods is no exception, with so much ham it's positively porcine. A The game uses a very straightforward point-andclick interface which is a doddle to use since there are only five main game icons. A Five points are deducted from your score each time you use the oracle, which is your on-line help system. JUST LIKE BEING AT THE MOVIES Technically this is one of the best examples of movie-style adventure games we've ever encountered, although nothing's perfect and the film-style graphics still have a few problems... GRAPHICS 92 SOUND 91 PLAYABILITY 90 VALUE 80 OVERALL OK, you don't know you need it yet, but this pot is overlaid on the background so obviously you just know it's something you should pick up and hold on to for later. to save space in RAM and on CD, only the bits of the screen that need to be animated are. Only people's faces tend to move independent of their hair, neck and body. That doesn't mean the game's bad in a way. Quite the opposite.

And basically you have to make your way out of a labyrinthine space outpost, terminating any terrorists (and damned ugly they are too) who get in your way.

You're not alone either because there's a two-player link up option so that your and a mate can help (or hinder) one another's escape by linking up yours and his TVs, Mega Drives and copies of the game. A Captain Brown is happy, he's just picked up a weapon, he has a healthy arsenal (ie 100% flame thrower) and he's just spotted a bullet proof vest and shotgun. What could possibly go wrong? Man-sized crabs, that's what. VERDICT Pause the game to access the map to the whole level, you get to the next floor by finding the lift (usually dead-ends preceded by a door). There's also a mini on-screen map, though don't concentrate too much on it or you'll not notice the old alien scum creeping up behind you... Here you're in control of Delaforce (and he's a sarge) and of course with such a pretty name' he's bound to buy it as soon as he steps out of the lift. MEGA DRIVE Three important factors that go to make a good game are tension, action and addictive gameplay, and although Zero Tolerance is a simple enough concept, derived from the laudable Doom, it's got the former in abundance. There's plenty of booming weapon FX, a nice variety of weapons, huge levels and plenty of gaming violence. The twoplayer link up is a nice addition, and you probably will need more than zero tolerance since this game is reet hard.

Burp. ogi has just discovered that his beloved home Jellystone Park is in danger of being closed down after some swine stole all the park funds. That means no more rangers (good news) but it also means no more gullible tourists leaving picnic baskets lying around. A better reason for the closure of the park might have had something to do with it being such a dangerous place as Yogi discovers in due course. As well as hazards such as fire and death by drowning, our anthropomorphised kodak bear crusader also has to avoid the park's residents, who are hell-bent on taking revenge for all the years they've had to endure Yogi's 'humorous' pranks. It all translates into 32 levels of platform action which, much to our surprise, is really rather good. PLAY IT SAFE To complete the game you need to track down the 12 safes which contain the park's money. Just like this... VERDICT H az 28. Cael 1389 92 95 02 In this part of the game Yogi eats some food which makes him puff up and float upwards. Try to collect as many goodies as possible. GAME BOY Yogi may not contribute anything new to platform games, but it's a solid, playable game all the same. This is due mainly to the variety of challenges you face. The action is very fast and the animation and true to the cartoon. My only problem is that some of the opponents are rather titchy and difficult to spot against the whizzing backdrops. Still, you'll have lots of fun exploring the 32 levels, which should take some time. DENIZ AHMET There are a lot of invisible stepping blocks in the game.

"CVG REVIEW BEEP BEEP, BEEP BEEP YEH! A1200 RACING GAME .99 OUT NOW SNES VERSION AVAILABLE CD32 VERSION PLANNED Step into the passenger seat as CVG test drives the latest racing game from Gremlin... Ithough Gremlin's trilogy of Lotus games is knocking on a bit, they're still regarded as classics so it seems fitting that it should be the Sheffield based company that comes up with a '94 equivalent. Top Gear 2 hit the SNES a year ago; but it's still remembered as one of the few SNES racing games not to utilise Mode 7, making it perfect conversion material for the Amiga. There were other programming tricks used though, and only the A1200 is powerful enough to cope with them. Otherwise Top Gear 2 features all the regular racing game features, like full screen oneplayer option or split-screen two-player mode, nitros, plenty of tracks and a prize money option which rewards wins with lots of cash to spend on customising your car. TOP GEAR 2 0999101 QUTO 996 At various points during the game expect the driver to come out with comments like 'Eat dirt' and 'Crash and burn'. I guess he's trying to be hard but fails miserably. Gar 15 123 CEASED VERDICT QUTO th O) LAS 15 21 A1200 Top Gear 2 offers little that wasn't in the Lotus trilogy. Lots of tracks and music; fast scrolling, onecolour cars, no body damage; it's all very familiar. That's not a complaint as such, the Lotus games are very playable but why release something that's only a little different? I'll tell you why, the Lotus trilogy isn't compatible with the A1200, so if this style of racing game is your tank of petrol then take a look, but four years on from the original Lotus it seems a little dated. RIK SKEWS CUBE 90. A A limited number of nitros are available. More can be bought or found on the track. They're best used on steep hills. A A lot of the features in the game are similar to the Lotus trilogy also by Gremlin, especially the start sequence which zooms in on teh cars while they're sitting on the grid. A Top Gear 2 is probably best enjoyed in two-player mode. There's no noticeable slowdown thankfully, unlike Stunt Race FX on SNES.

"CVG REVIEWS IPC-CD 3DO STRATEGY .99 HOUT NOW PC.CD VERSION AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Atmospheric tunes make each of the eight tables seem exciting when you're not playing them. PINBALL SIM .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED DE A savage Horde is munching its way through your medieval village... PINBALL DR EAMS 000000 @ 300 How many pinball tables could you fit on a CD game? Well 21st Century have managed eight... Beats OOOOOO he Horde takes you back in time, to when kings and queens held banquets in huge, monolithic castles, and where the ruler ruled over all that he surveyed. That was until a load of carnivorous critters known as the Horde started ravaging the kingdom. And that's basically the setting for this action-cum-strategy game liberally interspersed with various FMV footage. The idea is to build up your medieval village's defences (by erecting pits and walls) against the Horde, which enables the town to prosper (à la Sim City) without being hindered by the marauding Horde. Subsequently you can attract more townsfolk to your community. Well that's the strategy part, the action bits come into operation when your defences haven't worked and you have to go into combat with the little beasts by whipping out your sword in true beat-'em-up style. VERDICT 3D0 Early 3D0 games got away with smart graphics and little gameplay, but with The Horde matters have been reversed. At first it seems like a hack'n'-slash version of Sim City, but it's one of those games which grows on you. The animation is excellent and the difficulty level just right, as is the time limit and the tension that builds up. DENIZ AHMET hy doesn't anyone improve the control system in pinball games? Left and right is all you ever get. For realistic flipper control you could have a few buttons for each side representing the speed or strength of each flipper. Anyone listen ing? So what we have here is a compilation of previous Pinball Dreams games, enhanced with some raytraced introductions and an interactive \"history of pinball' option. The only change to the game is the VERDICT hi-res option which you didn't have before. If you're after an introPutting out a compilation duction to the simulation of Pinball Dreams on CD of pinball at home this is is a bit gimmicky. Sure, probably a good package, you get more tables than but otherwise it's um, any other game (in hi-res) well read on and see... but you'd probably have more fun with one table out of Pinball Fantasies. The game plays realistically but the tables are too small and there's only one set of flippers. These tables are just dull compared to the real thing.

But it's the Nineties, and we need a new word we'll just say its frasmitic and let you work it out for yourself... Most of the characters have long-range attacks, such as the Boomer the clown who bowls his head at his opponent. air enough, so it's named after the area no self-respecting male would go for in a real fight, but that's not an option in the game itself. You see that's what the characters are made out of balls. Tennis balls, beach balls, footballs, you get the idea. Like Sega's Virtua Fighter coin-op, the view point pans and zooms with the action to great effect. But it's the humour which makes it so good. The moves are a completely outrageous mix of wrestlingstyle throws, martial arts and good old-fashioned head-against-the-pavement street violence. Each of the 14 fighters have their own style of fighting, the heavyweights prefer head-locks and fists in the face, while the faster characters have deadly throws and the ostrich is just in a league of its own. VERDICT Each character has around 30 moves, which gives you more than enough scope for doing your oppo. nents over in a variety of interesting ways. He's big, he's got blue pants and his name is Bruiser he's got to be strong, and he is. haliza POW sideu eu Throws are a good way to knock off lots of your opponent's energy in one hit. But you need to get in close to grab him first. MEGA DRIVE This is a unique approach to beat-'em-ups, and incredibly playable with it. The changing perspective takes getting used to, especially with the special moves, but at the same time it is one of the integral features of the game which make it so playable.

"CVG REVIEW NO SNAKES BUT LOADS OF LADDERS ISNES PLATFORM -60 OUT NOW INO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE I NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED LODE RUNNER TWIN JUST LIKE THAT Eleven years after the original here's a game which hasn't aged one iota; and now it has added Nineties two-player mode appeal... What would you expect to do in a typical level of this game?  | THANH H Look at the radar to spot the collectables and baddies, then move accordingly. hat ever happened to Snakes & Ladders? Remember the tension just as you got to the top row and faced the turmoil of a succession of extra-long snakes threatening to plunge you back to row one? Yep, that was a great game simple, and addictive. In many ways Lode Runner Twin has much of the qualities which made Snakes & Ladders so compulsive: there's the excitement of getting to the top and the satisfaction of seeing your opponent fail. The idea here is to locate all the tokens in a maze of platforms and ladders and then escape off the top of the screen. You'll get a good idea of it if you imagine the sort of 'run for your life' scenario found in PacMan applied to the mayhem involved in getting round a maze of ladders. With the splitscreen two-player option the style of play involves some teamwork, but, whichever mode you choose, there'll be heaps of levels to keep you going. On deeper levels the bad dies get a bit more ingenious and start floating off platforms to catch you. SUMB VERDICT ER Not all floors can be smashed. You can spot these by their dark colour. Up the ladder and slip across the beams. Now drop on to the goodies. BODO DE DURDU HHHHHHHHHH SNES I never played this first time round so I'm not nostalgic. But if the original is anything like this then I missed out! Lode Runner is cute, simple and addictive. It may lack originality and be repetitive but you'll forgive it because it's such fun. The new two-player option is welcome and presented very comfortably. After such high praise it's a shame to admit that it's all too easy, and would have been much better i each stage was played to a time limit DENIZ AHMET 520 The object of the game is simply to collect all the goodies on each maze.

"CVG REVIEW EVERYBODY WAS SHAQ-FU FIGHTING MEGA DRIVE BEAT-'M-UP .99 OUT NOW INO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SHAQ-FU SETT Bruce and Brandon Lee, Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal and... Shaquille O'Neil all great martial artists. Is someone talking a load of old Shaq? of ancient Il right, so he may have trouble stringing a coherent sentence together, but there's no arguing with the Shaq-man's basketball court skills. It's as much as anything due to him being over 7-feet tall and weighing more than 300 pounds, which makes him the kind of man you just don't mess with. That probably explains why Electronic Arts signed the NBA giant to appear in this beat-'em-up. It melds clichés and features from many other games, including Mortal Kombat and Eternal Champions, but with small, well-animated sprites which are reminiscent of ace platformer Another World. And, as it turns out, the people responsible for Shaq-Fu are none other than AW's programmers, Delphine. A beat-'emup's quite a departure from their usual cerebral brand of action adventure, but all things considered they've done a rather excellent job. A Although Shaq's the star of the game, he's somewhat overshadowed by the rest of the cast who, let's face it, look far meaner. SHAQ YOUR BOOTIE Should you prove completely inept in the arena, the game tells you one of your character's special moves before you go back and challenge another character. VERDICT The special moves are certainly varied enough and easy to execute, but the game's not fast enough for you to pull off Streetfighterstyle combos. V Teknology is key 03162 Oh dear, Shaq's taken a real pounding, and now lies bleeding on the floor. MEGA DRIVE Shaq-Fu is a playable, feature-laden cart with excellent animation, well drawn, if somewhat small, sprites. The characters are hugely varied, with a good array of special and standard attacks. The game doesn't facilitate combos though, which limits the strategic element. Mortal II still reigns supreme, but this is a good alternative. What next we wonder? Brian Moore's all-star rugby wrestling, or perhaps Alex Ferguson's Disco Inferno. Yeah, that's the one. MARK PATTERSON SPECIAL MOUE Hmm, the obligatory \"hah, I am victorious, fool' screen which is now a feature of most beat-'em-ups. 6BDO ULO DEAD MODE POSTO But wait! Here's a spe. cial move which will amaze his mates and confound his enemies.

"ON ME HEAD! REVIEW CVG AMIGA FOOTBALL MANAGEMENT .99 OUT NOW SNES, MEGA DRIVE AND NES ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED ON THE BALL WORLD CUP EDITION Typical, it has to be the Germans that come up with a football management game that breaks all the rules.. in the Ball takes a similar approach to graphic adventures, with the familiar point-and-click interface and multiple choice responses used. The core of the game takes place around the manager's diary, and it's here the player fills each day with events like training, going into town, checking on injured players, calling a press conference and soon as the World Cup progresses. Each event has its own graphic backdrop and gameplay style which is more pleasing on the eye than row-after-row of statistics. To add spice the player has to prepare for random events as best as he can. Some are easily avoided (if you give the press grief expect sex 'revelations the next day) but most are of the bomb scare variety (which cancel training) or food poisoning which can knock a player for six (or the khazi). VERDICT ZUCKER The core of the game takes place around the diary where all the different features are arranged. Just like real life continual late nights can result in bad decisions so don't pack too much into one day. AMIGA I love football management games and didn't think that an arcade orientated one would cut the mustard. Well this does and it's great fun. Special mention has to go to Tobias Richter's backgrounds, they're especially good on the A1200 where they match the clarity of the PC original. If you don't like traditional footy management games give this a try, but purists should probably stick with Player Manager 2 or Championship Manager '94. RIK SKEWS ASCOT On the Ball differs from every other management game to date in that the ingame graphics are very good and shock, horror even animated! Eight noths pregnant If you annoy the press then expect revelations in the paper the next day. All I can say here is I want a lawyer! AA variety of training options are available. Punishment training is good for a laugh, especially when you force injured players to train. Extreme power is mine! GRAPHICS 86 SOUND 40 PLAYABILITY 87 VALUE 85 OTHER VERSIONS Slightly higher definition in the graphics but otherwise this is the same excellent game. Being on a hard drive, like the A1200 version, makes it more playable too. OVERALL There's an option to get away from it all and visit the sights. Be careful though, it's easy to get drunk, mugged or even killed by a low-flying chilli pepper! During training text keeps the player informed of how the players are doing, whether their form is improving, or if they aren't suited to a particular training style. 88 PC ISSUE 154 @ 89% GAME BY ASCON CONTACT DAZE MARKETING (071-328 3144) FOR MORE INFORMATION 95 "


"CVG REVIEW STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND AMIGA ARCADE ADVENTURE .99 OUT NOW UNIVERSE INO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE A1200 AND CD32 VERSIONS PLANNED There's never a friendly Bobby around to ask for directions when you're lost in a strange universe... ith its latest game Core Design has shown clearly that there's plenty of life left in the Amiga. Universe is a point-'n'-click adventure in the Beneath a Steal Sky-mould, but combined with the humour of the Monkey Island games. However, the most striking feature is that the graphics are in drawn in 256 colours, a fine technical achievement that's not been seen on a basic Amiga before. Another noticeable point is that the levels have been well organised on the disk so, despite the fact there's five of them, swapping is kept to a bare minimum. The game casts the player as Boris Verne, who's been sucked into another universe after messing with his Grandad's time machine. The initial plot involves trying to get Boris back to Earth, but it soon turns out that something far more sinister must be dealt with first... A Conversations take the form of speech bubbles which are advanced by clicking the right mouse button. A choice of replies and questions for Boris to utter is presented at the bottom of the screen VERDICT This is the start of the game. Somehow a bridge must be made between the asteroid which Boris stands on and the other world in the distance. Universe has a number of basic arcade sections which help break up the continual onslaught of puzzles. One of them requires a precision jump on to an asteroid. AMIGA It's hard to believe this is running on an A500, it's a fine technical achievement with excellent graphics and subtle music. Thankfully the gameplay matches up to the programming cockiness with a neat blend of puzzles and simple arcade games, linked together with genuinely funny humour and an easy-to-use icon system. Overall this is one of the rare occasions when an adventure game will appeal to both veterans of the genre and newcomers alike RIK SKEWS A In this hostile place it's better to be dead than captured, but sadly the later has happened to Boris here. Time to restore a saved game methinks... OPTIONS GRAPHICS 92 SOUND 90 PLAYABILITY 86 VALUE 84 OVERALL A The game's full screen lets the player take in the graphics, but when the icons are needed a simple right click will activate them. Select the one desired with a left click, then right click again to make them disappear. COMING SOON PC AND CD32 Universe Core Expect 256 'proper colours rather than the clever programming tricks used in the A500 version plus sampled speech and CD music. EXPECTED RELEASE: OCTOBER OPEN THIS DOOR SUBJERNE HUSEO Those lasers must be taken out somehow, which is easier said than done with that nasty looking security robot lurking nearby. 82 GAME BY CORE DESIGN CONTACT CORE DESIGN (0332 297797) FOR MORE INFORMATION 96 "


"JELLY BABIES... REVIEW CVG ISNES PLATFORM .99 OUT OCTOBER JELLYBOY 1 GAME BOY VERSION AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED A For a platform game Jellyboy doesn't make good use of parallax scrolling but it is fast. Looking like a cross between a Bassett's Jelly Baby and a Mr Blobby Junior comes Ocean's little blob of joy... urely everyone's favourite confectionery moment of yesteryear has to be scoffing a pack of Jelly Babies at your local fleapit cinema; times change though, and now we're resigned to munching nachos at the local 48 screen mulitplex. Anyway enough nostalgia, Jelly Babies and the like, we're here with a genuine Jellyboy. He stars in Ocean's new platformer, where he uses his pliable jelly powers to transform into 27 different configurations by collecting the relevant tokens. The idea is that he can morph into a balloon, hammer, bomb, light bulb and so forth, and these different shapes enable him to reach new parts of the game's different worlds. There are seven such worlds to conquer, themed around kids' stuff like lego, mechano and other toys that young 'uns used to play before these new fangled videogames came along. It's your task to find six hidden items among these to complete the game. Jellyboy is helped along by a couple of little friends who he picks up later on in the game, and there's your usual cluster of secret rooms, bonus games and teleports to keep the pace lively. Kind of sweet don't you think? VERDICT A Jellyboy's main weapon is this expanding fist which lunges out of his belly. Unfortunately, he can't attack and move at the same time. 1 SNES Jellyboy seems to be Ocean's answer to a Mr Blobby game. The idea of morphing Jellyboy into different shapes is quite original but the rest of the game is predictable; crumbling ledges, lifts, and drops have all been done better before. This is a decent game if silly characters are your thang, but otherwise it just doesn't reward you enough for your efforts. A game doesn't have to be original to be good but there's just something very bland about this. DENIZ AHMET V That yellow block is Helpy Block who Jelly must punch around to make ledges for himself.

"IT'S MAGIC REVIEW CVG ICD32 ADVENTURE GAME .99 OUT NOW AMIGA, PC, A1200 AND PC CD-ROM ALSO AVAILABLE I NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SIMON THE SORCERER Despite being blessed with a voice, things still aren't so simple for Simon... imon the Sorcerer appeared with little hype and surprised us all with its brilliance when it first arrived on Amiga. Now the CD32 version is here and like the PC CD-ROM disc the only difference from the floppy is the inclusion of sampled character voices. Hence Simon is now played by Chris Barrie of Red Dwarf and The Brittas Empire, while impressionist Roger Blake is the other contributor of note. Gameplay is unchanged and sees you as Simon the streetwise teenager who gets sucked into a land of wizardry and must solve plenty of point in click puzzles, beat the bad guy, save the kingdom and somehow get back to Earth. Limited interaction with characters is achieved through a number of onscreen replies which range from friendly to the sort of sarcastic comment Chris Barrie is probably used to after six series of Red Dwarf. VERDICT Swampling makes best use of the CD speech. Amazingly enough his newfound vocals make him sound even more pathetic than before. A If you manage to survive then you'll eventually reach this screen, which is the end of the game. Get ready for a surprise. CD32 I still regard the original game very highly and gameplay wise this is no different, though playability is slightly increased since you don't have a nine-disk horror. The speech is well acted, but Chris Barrie's highly distinctive voice detracts from the personality and charm of the original script. Still, along with Beneath a Steel Sky this is my favourite Amiga adventure and as the former is not yet available on CD it's an essential buy. RIK SKEWS Click on the game window to move where you want to while the panel at the bottom of the screen lets you do many other actions, like eat and talk Being on CD32 you'd expect 256 colours, and you get them.

For those who haven't, well Megarace is played as a game show where the idea is to race around a succession of 16 tracks bumping off rival gangs and ultimately earning prizes. You get three laps per track to destroy all opponents, and to help you out there are power-ups sprawled across the road surfaces. If you manage to defeat the boss car you can then select that vehicle for the next course. The idea being that on later tracks you'll have to select cars strategically. No game show is complete without a host though, and Megarace has Lance Boyle. You'll see Lance before and after every race and his blend of humour, endless chat and bright jackets leaves you thinking one thing: 'Shut up Lance'. VERDICT Lightly High beam Weight Mlarning Shield capacities Once you've run out of bullets you have to bash opponents to death, this often makes you spin-off dangerously, MEGA-CD When I first played Megarace on PC my reaction was to frown at the simplistic gameplay. But Megarace soon becomes very addictive. Perhaps it's the lure of the lush graphics and tension of each track. For the MegaCD version technical wonders have been worked because nothing has been lost in conversion; fewer colours is the only difference. However, the control system lets the game down; it's just too sensitive against the speed of the scrolling.

We drag Bubsy from his litter tray to see what he can do. ubsy the bobcat has made it to a sequel, but what does that mean exactly? Well, sequels to platform games generally mean more of the same, and that's what you've got here. Again Bubsy goes on a high-speed dash, bouncing on baddies and gathering pick-ups against the clock. Considering this is a platform game, though, there's a shortage of things to jump on in some of the levels, which means you need even better timing to land on what's there and this is exactly what gives Bubsy its playability. It's set in a building where Bubsy, now demoted to janitor, has to clear out the nasties while searching for his lost nephew. Easy it ain't.

SNES What lets this game down is the scrolling which is actually worse that it was in the first game. Bubsy himself doesn't offer many physical attributes and therefore isn't the most tactile character to grace a platform game. However, the size and variety of the levels makes up for that considerably, and it'll take you a fair while to complete. However, compared to something like Konami's Sparkster, Bubsy 2 shouldn't be allowed in the house.

GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL ISHAR 3 AMIGA .99 BY SILMARILS Some of the best yet seen in an Amiga RPG, brilliantly drawn with spectacular use of colour. Adequate and competent, but doesn't really do anything stunning or in any way unexpected. It's good and immersive, with plenty to see and do, but nothing Earth-shatteringly original. A must for RPG fans and no mistake. 83% SPIDERMAN AND THE X-MEN GAME GEAR TBA BY ACCLAIM Slick and action-packed platform adventure. The sprites retain their comic look and are well animated, although a couple of the backgrounds are a bit confusing. The music is truly ace, especially for the Game Gear, but the speech is hissy and rather bad. A lot of variety between the stages, reflecting the differences between the characters you play. SOCCER KID PC .99 BY KRISALIS Looks quite con soley, but there's a definite PC feel to it, if you see what we mean. Just look at the screenshot. All very jolly and candyfloss and fun and cute and you're going to be sick. Bring back the Bee Gees. Something of a console stylee platform title, with some intriguing puzzles. Quite good fun. Footie-based platform action. 79% TAZ 2 O MEGA DRIVE   BY SEGA The best bit. Most cartoony and even gasp! humorous in places, plus some cool animation. Tinny and trumpy and not exactly what you'd want to call entertaining, unless you're Frank Zappa. In which case you're dead. Almost exactly the same as the original Taz, and in these days of Dynamite Headdy that isn't good enough. Distinctly average platform title. 68% AN AMERICAN TALE FIEVAL GOES WEST SNES O ETBA BY VIRGIN Top notch representations of the famous cartoon characters and their similarly animated backgrounds.

Oh come on, you know the dirll by now it's a PC strategy game. What do you think the sound's going to be like? Let's face it, this market is getting a little overcrowded. Still, this is a decent enough little title. Well defined medieval strategy game. 76% ANIMALS MEGA-CD TBA BY MINDSCAPE The static animal pictures are good, but the FMV which is most of the visual footage is terribly grainy. When it's good, it's great fantastic sampled animals. When it's bad, it really does suck quite heartily.

"BE A GOOD SPORT REVIEW CVG GAME BOY SPORTS .99 OUT SEPTEMBER NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Do you ever resort to bashing the controls when a game annoys you? Well here's a game which makes you want you to do that all of the time. ALIEN OLYMPICS SITTI ack in the days of Commodore 64s and Spectrums one type of game sold especially well. We're talking of course about multievent sports games, particularly Daley Thompson's Decathlon. You can blame Ocean for that, and with it the classic control system which had you thumping away at the left and right-keys itself a concept pinched from Konami's Track and Field coin-op. Many blisters on and Ocean now presents a quirky alternative in the shape of Alien Olympics. There are 15 events in this game, which admittedly aren't particularly skillful but are quite imaginative all the same; instead of hurdles for example you get leechtype creatures jumping laser beams, or similarly the long jump pit appears as a pool of acid. Retro games? Good or bad, check out the verdict for that allimportant opinion. In one-player mode you always play against the computer opponent and usually on a split-screen. ONE E 88301 VERDICT Not all events involve tapping keys. Some require you to do things at funny angles, such as this archery-inspired shoot-up. GAME BOY Well this is certainly just about the most physically demanding game the Game Boy has ever seen. Most of the time you don't even need to look at the screen. Having said that, 15 events is more than you ever got in those ancient 'Track and Field' type games and the alien angle is quite jolly and well-animated. The real problem is that the oneplayer mode isn't particularly challenging, so its real appeal is as a twoplayer game. DENIZ AHMET GET ON TRACK Here's an example of one of the more demanding alien events. For the 'Lunge Leap Splat' challenge you need to tap the A/B keys to build up speed then cal culate the bouncing angle three successive times to clear the pit. The presentation is always clear and helpful. Most events use a sliding bar to illustrate the speed reached by tapping the keys.

Forget TIE Fighter, why not join up and battle the Rexxon hordes in Digital Image Design's stunning new space combat experience... nferno is here, a free-form, cinematic space opera. With over 700 missions, three modes of play (Arcade, Evolutionary and the full blown campaign, Director's Cut) and a starfighter loaded with lasers and torpedoes, if ever there was a game that could claim to be an 'interactive movie', this game is it. You play the space pilot and in a series of epic battles you must defend your fragile solar system from the evil Rexxon Empire. Like X-Wing, Inferno is a tale of a band of humans fighting a powerful enemy, but with cinematic mission briefings, digitised speech, a soundtrack by Goth band Alien Sex Fiend and a huge 3D world to fly around in, it's bigger, better and more fun to play. Unlike X-Wing, TIE Fighter or Wing Commander, the missions are massively varied. You're not just confined to flying around in space. You'll have the opportunity to dive headlong into satellites, descend on to planets and even dogfight in the depths of huge alien spacecraft. Is Inferno better than TIE Fighter?

DISKO INFERNO SECOND OPINION Now I'm a great fan of TIE Fighter and I was extremely dubious about Inferno when I first saw it playing; it looked complicated, there are no wingmen and the 3D graphics are somewhat basic. But, if you actually take the time to sit down and play it, you start to realise what a good game it really is. The missions are huge and some take upwards of 45 minutes to complete, while the sheer variety of the missions and attention to detail is superb. GARY LORD VERDICT UMNUCAT PC I've been waiting for Inferno for a long time and thankfully my faith in the game has not been disappointed. It's a huge game, encompassing deep-space and planetary combat, with all the features of a top-notch flight sim, but the feel and the playability of an arcade game. If ! have a gripe it's that the disc accessing is painfully slow and breaks up the flow of the game, but this aside Inferno is stunning and if you've got a CDROM drive, this must be an essential buy. DEAN EVANS Combat doesn't just take place in deepest space, you'll also have to fly into buildings and across the surface of planets.

If the battle is going badly, Kreeg will retreat to the safety of the bug-ship, a huge Rexxon capital ship that can only be destroyed by flying inside it and blowing up the engine reactors. This is what the Rexxons are after, Terra Nova or New Earth. Don't let them get even close otherwise you can book both you and mankind a one-way ticket to extinction. 93 INFERNO IS THE \"UNOFFICIAL' SEQUEL TO DID'S EARLIER SPACE COMBAT GAME, EPIC.

The gameplay's been left untouched though... Good or bad thing? Discuss... id Chaos is platform based and draws inspiration from Sega's ultra successful Sonic the Hedgehog games, although it also plays a lot like Ocean's earlier platform hit Mr Nutz. The basic idea is to reach the door at the other side of each level. Thing is, the door's locked and the only way to open it is to smash up a preset amount of the background scenery. To aid the boy Chaos in his quest, there's the usual amount of handily placed restart points, plus bonus posts which offer treats like increased vitality and extra time. Watch out though, the bonus posts are sometimes booby trapped! There's also fruit scattered around the play area which once collected restores the Kid's vitality. KID CHAOS SCORE 000 600 TIME 11845 Kid's movement is inertia heavy, has a high running speed and can spin through the air for a fair distance. VERDICT UDDIE MERE Hit this bonus post and one of a number of bonuses will be Kid's reward. Usually that is, because on rare occasions there can be a booby prize 150 LIE 0000 AMIGA Like Renegade's Elfmania and Ruff 'n' Tumble, Kid Chaos shows that given a talented programming team, there's plenty of surprises that can be squeezed out of a standard Amiga. Ultra smooth and fast scrolling, fantastic control and thumping techno music, the game is full of professional touches. My only gripe is it offers nothing new in an overpopulated genre. Still, it's good mindless fun, but it won't convert you to the Amiga if you're a console platform fan. RIK SKEWS 093 1030 A The programmers are obviously Sonic fans, there's loads of references from the Sega games like these springs for instance. A The fruit scattered around each level repairs some of Kid's health, but thankfully he repairs himself slowly as well by staying away from anything else nasty.

Keep alert and you might just might keep yourself alive to see some of the biggest and most imaginative boss sprites the Game Boy has ever seen! 20 VERDICT The bosses in this game are all very big: the bigger they are the more aggressive they are A If you blast an enemy collect the power-up token. A For two levels the action switches to overhead per. spective. This isn't as easy as it looks because you haven't got a radar to see oncoming dangers. GAME BOY The original SNES game is one of my all-time favourites and this version has captured its appeal perfectly. It lacks the simultaneous two player option, but there's more than enough action to keep you occupied. Pro botector offers arcade quality action with lots of variety, awesome bosses and crippling power-ups. Played on a Super Game Boy you also get improved sound effects. Probo 2 is a worthwhile conversion, especially if you haven't experienced it on SNES. DENIZ AHMET Unlike the SNES version. you can't select between the weapons you've collected. BEST FOOT FORWARD A You lose all your weapons if you get hit. This is immensely frustrating if it happens just before reaching a boss.

"CVG REVIEW FAULT! MEGA DRIVE IMG INTERNATIONAL TOUR TENNIS ISPORTS SIMULATION .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Can it be true, could EA Sports have finally hit its double fault on the Sega Mega Drive? Like football, there's a number of strategies you can adopt during the game, such as staying near the net to drop the ball over it. TOURNAMENT hink of a quality software house and chances are that EA's sub-division EA Sports (and EA itself come to think about it) will probably spring to mind. FIFA Soccer, the NHL Hockey and John Madden series have all helped Electronic Arts into the position of being one of the biggest software houses in the world. Sooner or later though, even the best software companies can come up with a duffer and IMG International Tour Tennis looks like being the one for EA. First impressions are deceiving and the decent presentation distracts from the game's limitations. There's some quality digitised images of the countries where the action takes place and the rotoscoped sprites are far more impressive than those in Pete Sampras' Tennis, but sadly the gameplay is frustrating at times and never as much fun as Codemasters' game. As well as a single exhibition match you can also compete for cash and glory in a number of tournaments and tours. VERDICT EA must have had the cheque book out again because there's plenty of real players to be found in the game including our own Jeremy Bates. No Pete Sampras for some reason though, obviously the Codies' cheque book was bigger... MEGA DRIVE There is a decent game here trying to escape, but it can't as this product is deeply flawed in places. It's packed with delays. Serving takes ages and the screen has to realign itself after every play. The computer opponent often argues with the ref which you can't stop, while the ball boys can't decide who should pick the balls up. With a little more work this could have been excellent but I'd rather play Pete Sampras' Tennis. RIK SKEWS The practice option is pretty useful. There's a number of lessons to progress through which teach you how to accurately place and return the ball to different parts of the court. ARRRGH! International Tour Tennis is full of niggly little points which ruin the game. When the computer opponent decides to argue with the ref there's nothing you can do to stop him; the ball boys can never decide who should get the balls which wastes even more time and the bizarre, unrealistic way the player runs about also proves very annoying. There's plenty of serving options but no matter where you place the ball in the red area it always seems to end up in the same spot. It appears the only way to change the direction of the ball is simply to move the joypad after you've served.

GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL vo OUT TO LUNCH CD32 .99 BY MINDSCAPE Exactly the same as the brilliant A1200 version and comes complete with that lovely parallax scrolling. Chirpy little ditties but the sound FX are fairly average and can annoy after a while. Very playable and good fun, although it can get repetitive and pixel perfect timing is often called for. An unoriginal but highly playable platformer. 85% QUIK THE THUNDER RABBIT AMIGA .99 BY TITUS Unsurprisingly cute, although the colours look a little washedout and the sprites are a bit small. Jolly, bouncy tunes which are guaranteed to have you climbing the walls and strangling your pets within minutes. Not what you could call strikingly original, and it's a little Sonicesque in places, but still good fun. 309 God save us from Titus budget games. 79% STAR WARS CHESS MEGA-CD ETBA BY MINDSCAPE Terrible Droids-like animations of the characters, with no character. They're just downright crap. Equally excremental. The only effects are in the piece-taking animations. Although admittedly, these are OK. It's chess. But the stupid viewpoint makes it impossible unless you use the non-Star Wars overhead view. Stupid. Stupid idea for a chess game. Stupid game. 30% OVERLORD PC .99 BY VIRGIN Hey they're the smoothest. Great sprites and backgrounds, plus the very smoothest scrolling and update going. A good deal of booms, bangs and budda-buddas. Very World War and very good Possibly the best game of its kind on top-spec PCs, but peasants may be a little disappointed. Top notch flight sim with smoothest graphics. 89% BATTLETOADS DOUBLE DRAGON SNESO .99 BY TRADEWEST Humorous animations and good use of colour, but the perspective is sometimes a little bit off. Quite average, but the rrrockin' soundtracks are good for a laugh if nothing else. But that's about the lot. Lots and lots to hit, this is a great feast of violence, but there's nothing at all innovative on offer. Good, solid but unexciting beat-'em up. 80% STAGGER INDYCAR EXPANSION PC .99 BY VIRGIN Exactly the same as the original IndyCar, which you must have in order to play this. Ditto here, so you should already know what the sound's like (if you bought the original game of course. Wow! Exactly the same, except much harder. Some of these courses are really horrible. Not essential, but fun. FLESS DONE MORE More levels for your fave game called IndyCar. 80% BRUTAL SPORTS FOOTBALL A1200 .99 BY MILENNIUM Orcs and Thragmians and all those types leg it around cartoonishly. Quite nice looking, really. Good enough, perfectly adequate, but not enough to make you want them to launch the soundtrack on CD. Not a total classic by any stretch of the imagination, but an enjoyable enough diversion from serious games. Enjoyable and bloody American football game. 80% BANSHEE CD32 .99 BY CORE Exactly the same as the A1200 original. By that we mean very good! Loads of variety and detail and silky smooth scrolling. Brilliant CD music but the great digitised sound FX tend to get lost under the sound of your guns firing continuously.

"CVG REVIEW HE'S LOST HIS MARBLES AMIGA PLATFORM EUNCONFIRMED HOUT NOW NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE A1200 AND CD32 VERSIONS PLANNED FF 'N? BLE He's cute, he's got a blond quiff, but he sure ain't no softie... oes anyone remember the C64 platform classics Monty on the Run and Thing on a Spring? Their creator was Jason Perkins, the programming mastermind behind Ruff 'N' Tumble. Add graphics guru Robin Levy, the man who was responsible for the look of Putty and you've got a quality team. Ruff 'N' Tumble is the first time the two have worked together. It's a platformer offering nothing new to the genre, but what's here is superbly presented and playable. Ruff must fight Doctor Destiny and his evil minions who've nicked Ruff's marbles. Hardly inspired but the neat idea is there's a preset number of three different types of marble to collect. This leads to some frantic searching when you thought you'd collected all the marbles only to realise there's one red one lurking elsewhere in the level. Arrgh! By holding the fire button down and moving the joystick, gunfire can be directed in all directions, useful for picking out baddies in nooks and crannies. Get the power-ups scattered around each level to shorten the reloading time of Ruff's gun and to give him more powerful weapons. Time Ruff's progress carefully in this section or he'll be squished by this giant pointed crusher. OOH, THAT'S NICE! Ruff 'N' Tumble features some exquisite graphics from Robin Levy, probably best known up to now for his graphic work on the great looking Putty from System 3. 1. Ruff himself is flawlessly animated from the way his trainers smoke when breaking to the way he slings his gun round his back when climbing up ladders. 2. The choice of colours used also deserves praise. They're vibrant and a very original palette's been used. 3. The smoke trail left behind by Ruff's missile launches are a joy to behold. It's hard to believe they're being generated by yer bog standard A500. Each level is accompanied by some excellent techno tunes which really drive you on. ONE SMOOTH OPERATOR..

"HE'S LOST HIS MARBLES REVIEW CVG The programmers have clearly been watching Robocop, this baddie moves just like ED209. Huzzah, it's the end of level lift! It'll only open once the boy Ruff has collected the required number of jewels. VERDICT AMIGA Nothing new but very playable is the verdict on Ruff 'N' Tumble. It's impossible to say exactly why a game is so playable but there's plenty of clues. The baddies are highly intelligent and make Ruff's life difficult it's very satisfying when one is killed. Then there's the graphics check out the missiles launched from Ruff's gun and the owl for proof of that. Plus the thumping music is brilliant; so overall a highly polished package and a worthy purchase! RIK SKEWS Those round things are the marbles which Ruff is searching for. There tends to be a bunch of them together at the start of a level but as it's explored more fully they soon become much harder to track down. Some coloured forcefields block progress in a level. Find the colour coded key to close them down. 85 GRAPHICS 89 SOUND PLAYABILITY 86 I VALUE 86  ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE Sonic 3 Sega/.99 The current benchmark in platform games, it faces a strong challenge from Dynamite Headdy and the forthcoming Sonic & Knuckles. lara A Things can get quite hairy very quickly. Ruff's gunfire rate slows down with continual use so only fire when necessary to give it ample time to recharge. OVERALL These gold coins simply boost Ruff's score.

I owned a Mega-CD which I have sold in order to buy a SNES. This is because CD is not a good medium for games machines since it takes ages for the CD to swap images for example, when changing view on Night Trap it takes about a second, which is a long time in the gaming world. I think Nintendo was right to decide against CD for its next console. Until companies can produce better quality CD games they should stick with carts. I hope you agree in some way with my views. MARK TADEJEWSKI Loughborough, Leics YOB: I agree. To date I haven't been impressed with CD technology, though the CD-based PlayStation is looking very tasty one of the first racing games shown for the system (Poly Poly Circus Grand Prix) could well out perform a similar title on Ultra 64 Cruis'n USA! 116 "

SEADHIND WILSON Co Down, N Ireland (For any mail in response send to: Marine Biology Station) Dear YOB, A few issues ago your magazine carried a feature on violence. You said that certificates were not necessary for most games since they don't use video footage or graphic violence. I agree that a lot of players aren't affected by those lovely Fatalities on Mortal Kombat II or the masses of blood in Doom, but there is always the occasional git who takes video games too seriously. For example, a friend of mine has a brother (who will probably read this letter if it's printed) who has tantrums every time he loses at Street Fighter on the Mega Drive. I also know a boy who was really obsessed by the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and he became quite violent by hitting people with sticks and claiming they were footsoldiers. What I'm trying to say here is although I love blood and guts in video games I really do think that certificates and censorship are necessary for the little ones who are affected by the violence in them. Thank YOB: Don't worry, I understand. It must be annoying when you want to enjoy all the blood and guts of MK II but they won't let you out of the experimental tank, and every once in a while a scientist sticks an electrode up your bum to see if you're still alive. Has it ever occurred to you that some kids will hit other kids with sticks even if they have never played a video game? Did kids never hit other kids in years gone by? Kids have always found an excuse for a scrap since time in memorial. Does anything resembling intelligence stir within your brain? What do you lot think?

ANTIYOBBISTS ANTI PREISTS MY BRAIN IS THE SIZE OF A CHERRY Dear YOB, I have just ordered a Jaguar and I was wondering if you would answer the following questions: CHRIS REYNOLDS Northants 1. Any chance of John Madden or Joe Montana American Football being released for the machine? YOB: Seeing as both are games licensed to companies with machines in direct competition with the Jag. I'd say the chances were slim. 2. Will there be any tennis games coming out for the Jag? YOB: Bound to be, but I haven't heard of any yet. We'll tell you when we know. 3. Will either Rebel Assault or X-Wing be coming out? YOB: If the Jaguar takes off in a big way, LucasArts will want to support it. If it doesn't, they won't. At the moment there are no plans. It's the same story for many developers right now they're waiting to see how the Jaguar performs before deciding whether or not to commit to the new platform. It's a bit like the chicken and egg situation, but more and more programmers are beginning to program for the machine. 4. Will Theme Park on the Jaguar be a classic or not? YOB: It's already a classic, it just depends how good the conversion is. Dear YOB, Fart. Yes, that's what you are! I'd love to know what the vicar said when he christened you. (It was something along the lines of \"Madam, I believe your son has just christened my arm.\" YOB) Anyway, no backchat or I will send my cousin Judge Dredd round to see you cowering in your bed when the Huggies advert is on TV. And if this is inconvenient, he will come round in the morning to embarrass you by hanging your urine-stained sheets out of the window. It's no good getting your cousin to defend you Noddy is hardly going to put up a good fight.

"CVG 0 &A HELP! THE BIG GAME TIPS Favourite foods, favourite shirts, favourite games. You just can't get enough of them, so here's our favourite tips far more appetising than Hagen Dazs ice cream and Nike cotton shirts... STREETS OF RAGE 3 SUPER METRIOD SNES Although Super Metroid comes with a 72 page players' guide there are a few cheats and tactics which aren't documented. So here goes.... The best of these gives Samus complete recharge. You'll need 11 Power Bombs, 10 Missiles and 10 super Missiles in your inventory. It only works if your reserve tanks are empty and your energy points are less than 50. To activate this cheat you first select your Power Bombs and morph into a ball. Hold down the Land R buttons plus DOWN on the pad. Now, press fire to lay the bomb and hold all buttons until the bomb explodes. A large glowing ball should now surround you restoring all your energy and reserves. The other tactic you'll find useful is with your Speed Booster found in Norfair. With this you can shoot up like a rocket, but did you know that by moving left or right immediately after jumping you can smash through walls and monsters? Finally, a couple of tips for your weapons. Once you have a weapon fully charged you can hold fire and press DOWN twice and you'll release not one but five bombs at once. For real damage though you can make a special weapon by going to the Status Screen if you have Super Bombs and weapons powered up. Highlight the word 'Charge' and one other weapon in the same box. Exit back to the game and press and hold fire after selecting the 'Super Bomb icon for a mega blast! MEGA DRIVE Ash If you've got an imported Genesis or Japanese version (ie Bare Knuckle 3), you might like to know that you can play Ash, the rather, er, camp fighter that was taken out of the official English version. To play him you must beat him up, and once you've killed him hold down A and let yourself be kiled. Go back to the start and through the options and you should find that you can now choose to play him. Roo Should you so desire you can also play Roo. To do this get to where you fight Bruce and Roo. Kill Bruce and let Roo run off. Now when you die and continue the game you'll be able to choose Roo. Shiva And, believe it or not, you can also play this nasty, despicable boss-type. Defeat him and hold B until you get to the next stage. As with Roo, let yourself die and when you return to the character-selection screen you'll be able to play Shiva. Level Select And if you fancy one of those good old level selects then go to the SELECTION MENU, hold B, press UP and with the OPTION icon highlighted press START. You should hear that familiar chime if it works. Simple when you know how to do things properly, eh? Be a cat Just kidding, this little beauty of a cheat lets you select nine lives. Go to the OPTIONS screen and press START. Now hold UP, A, B, and C on PAD 2 and RIGHT on PAD 1.

Stand three inches back and let go of LOW PUNCH and you should morph into Kintaro. PC Combat guide Taking on fast ships, such as the A-wing, is challenging no matter what you're flying, but it can be made easier. Start by switching off the cockpit graphics, So you can see more of the starfield. It makes tracking your foe much easier. Set your lasers to single fire and maximum recharge speed, this way you can just keep plugging away, taking pot shots but without having to be very accurate. Attacking big ships is a piece of cake. If you've got any torpedoes, use your targetting computer to aim them towards the ship's turbo lasers, as these are your greatest threat. Try to attack from underneath as there are fewer guns there. Finally, if there's a lot of time left after a mission, and providing your ship isn't damaged, don't go back to base when you've finished your primary and secondary objectives. Normally rebel ships hyperspace in and you'll have to take them on to complete a bonus goal. To play Jade On the '?'round fight using only low kicks. To play Smoke Keep doing uppercuts (you're more likely to get a Toasty that way), wait for a 'Toasty!', then press DOWN and START.

WORLD CUP USA '94 MEGA DRIVE SNES/GAME GEAR/GAME BOY/PC/AMIGA To professional foul or not? the opposition star players! And quite often you might find yourself needing to commit a professional foul in the area to stop a definite goal. We reckon the risk is worth it because the ref tends to only dish out yellow cards, and the goalies are good at stopping penalties. that the nearer you are to the goal, the more chance you have of scoring. However, there are ways of having a decent chance no matter where you stand. The key is to put a little bend on the shot, give just a hint of lift and then keep your finger on the button to give the shot maximum power. Make sure you only give a hint of lift because the power you apply to the shot can make the ball swerve wildly up or down and miss the goal otherwise. team but once you become proficient at the game try picking a team that excels in an area that suits the way you play the game. And learn how to use the set-piece editor. The preprogrammed set pieces are good but it's possible to design some excellent ones of your own. Make sure the third player is positioned at the far post, there's a good chance he'll be in a shooting position if the move comes off. of ploughing through the opposition without fear of being booked. Using the wings is also very important, since the opposition coverage is less there but also because the easiest way to score a goal is by running down the wing, and then shooting at the goalie diagonally. Taking a free kick It's generally true to say The ref's good, but only if he can see what's going on! If you want to indulge in some fighting the best time to do so is when you're behind the ref.

"CVG Q&A HELP! WHY GORE? Got a problem? Well you won't after you've read our informative and enlightening Help section but don't call us with anything of a medical nature... How come Mortal Kombat II has got blood in it on the SNES? Tell me the reason now or you will suffer a fatality. Rob Sims / London KONGED OUT? All the computer mags seem to be going mad about Donkey Kong Country. Surely it's just another dull platform game which happens to look very smart. Peter Brown / Cornwall A: The reason is because of the introduction of the ELSPA certification, and the box will state clearly that it's only suitable for people aged 15 and over. This is a voluntary code of practice though; so if you're aged 14 or under there's nothing legally stopping you buying the game, it's entirely up to the discretion of the retailer whether or not you're sold a copy. CONVERT A: DK Country could have some major implications on the future of SNES games. Nintendo is allegedly planning to use the compression techniques used in this game on future releases which means you shouldn't have to pay extra cash for bigger games. Donkey Kong Country is a 32Mb cart but Nintendo will sell it for just  because it is willing to take a loss to get more people interested in the SNES. The wider implication, though, is that on the eve of the launch of the new machines we have a game that evidently shows a whole new potential for 16-bit machines. Do the manufacturers of SNES convertors deliberately avoid making them fully compatible with every game to make us buy various convertors. I've just got a US Super Game Boy and it doesn't work on my convertor. Mike McSheen/ Manchester A: The reason why convertors aren't compatible with every game is because when games are programmed and released specifically for the Japanese and American markets, it's in Nintendo's financial interest that the games are only bought in that market. Thus the programmers try and program the games so that they don't work on a US or UK machine, either with or without a convertor. Obviously some convertors are more compatible with more games than others and at present it's probably the new version of the Datel Universal Adaptor. QUICK TIPS SNES  Having problems with this one?

"CVG Q&A HELP! SOUNDS BAD MULTI-MEEE-DYAWN? Have any of you CVG heads noticed that the speech on Super Street Fighter Il sounds muffled on the USA cart, but clean on the Jap versions? My mate has the Jap version so he's winding me up about it. Mike Leaning / Norwich I've noticed that the Sony PlayStation is to be sold as a games machine rather than a multimedia system like Sega's Saturn. Should that influence me at all? John courts / Oxford A: We can't say that we have noticed that but it's very unlikely. What's more likely is that your friend is playing on a stereo TV, and you've got a mono one, so unless you switch the sound option to mono it's bound to sound different. Needless to say but the same goes for most games. NO WAY, AMIGA In your CES report in the August issue why didn't you cover any Amiga games? Is this because Commodore has gone bust and no one will make games for it anymore? Ken Tweeps / Essex A: In our experience 'multimedia' offers little in the way of enticement. The 3DO and Jaguar are both labelled as multimedia machines which means that they can both utilise CD-ROM, though 3DO is obviously CD-only, whereas the Jag has a CD add-on peripheral. Until consoles come with keyboards, though, no one can expect them to be anything more than just games machines. THE HELP! LINE 3DO MARK 2?
