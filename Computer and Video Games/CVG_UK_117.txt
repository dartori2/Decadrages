"Set in the future, in which you control a \"Mauler\" Assault Tank in one of 16 missions, in a war fought between two dominant races of the New World.

"WE'RE HAVING A THIRD PARTY M egadrive third party stuff was in abundance. Berlin Wall IVI (Kaneko) looked neat and Turbo Outrun (IDG's conversion of the excellent racing coin-op) is excellent. Ballistic have four new titles Test Drive, Mike Ditka Power Football, Onslaught and Turrican, and Dreamworks have Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura Wrestling Superstars and Trampoline Terror. SPECIAL REPORT The Summer CES Show in Chicago has always been a launch pad for tons of new games which are shown publicly for the first time. And this year was no exception, with over 350 games on display! Julian Rignall jetted off to the \"Windy City\", stuffed himself with 64-oz steaks and \"lemon shots\" and got the lowdown... cean are certainly bus on Uthe Nintendo front, am nouncing Gameboy Robocop ll and Darkman and displaying Navy Seals. Tops in my body though, were two interpreta tions or ad coin-ops, Super Hunchbackis a brilliant enhancement ofthe decade-old cade machine, and Mr Do 19 a splendid scrolling rendition of Universal's cracking classic coin-op Nintendo have dominated every CES Show in recent history. I which isn't surprising when you consider that they and their third-party games producers take an 85% share of the American video games market. This year their presence was as substantial as ever, but Sega and NEC also had very large stands, indicating that not everything is going Nintendo's way at the moment. Sega are on a high after recently selling their millionth Megadrive and NEC are celebrating a sales boost for their Turbografx 16 (the American PC Engine) after cutting it's price to $99.99 (!). All three firms had a huge amount of product on display. Nintendo used the show to launch the Super Famicom, or Super NES as it'll be called (it has already been dubbed the SNES pronou that Sneeze\" by UK and US journalists). Sega displayed a range of spectacular software for the Megadrive and NEC had a whole load of new CD-ROM games on display and also revealed their upgraded CD-ROM System Card which has 2 Megabytes of storage space. What about computer software? Well, Amigas and STs are pretty much dead in the US, and what few games there were have already been seen in Europe. The PC Compatible market is looking healthier, with plenty of \"adult-oriented games like Ultima VII, Wing Commander II, Leisure Suit Larry V and Police Quest III but few arcade-style games to get enthusiastic about, other than the Ninja Turtles Arcade Game and The Simpsons. Could this be an indication of what will happen to the UK computer games market? We'll just have to wait and see... NOT A GOOD GAMING ANGLE all me old fashioned, but I found the two fishing games from Hot B. Black Bass and Blue Marlin, about as exciting as watching paint dry, but their shoot em up Over Horizon was a lot more fun Another five games that didn't provide much in the way of way, out fun and frolics were Romstar's Twin Eagle, Magic Darts World Champ. Mr Chin's Gourmet Paradise and Thunder and Lightning They're just a bit too ordinary. MEGADRIVE MANIA ega s huge, walled-in stand contained rows and rows of moni tors displaying a wealth of new Megadrive titles. In the centre, Sega s own games were on display, and these included Toe Jam and Earl. a very wacky one or two-player arcade game which reckon will take the Megadrive by storm, 688 Attack Sub, Deca pattack (starring Chuck D Head, a guy who can take his head off and throw it at his enemies). Donald Duck, Joe Montana II (still not as good as John Madden's). Mercs, Phantasy Star III (more role playing malarkey). Flicky (a conversion of an oldie-but-goldie coin-op). Shining in the Darkness, Streets of Rage (Sega's answer to Final Fight, and very good it is too), Fantasia (the se quel to Mickey Mouse, and I reckon it's even better). Alien Storm (brilliant!) and Golden Axe II (looking very good indeed) JAMMINT "


"MEGA COIN-OP DELIGHTS The two big coin-op firms, Capcom and Konami showed off a veritable gilt-edged collection of gaming goodies. Capcom's Little Mermaid, Little Nemo Dream Master, Talespin and Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers are all graphically stunning and play well too but better still is Megaman 4, which stars new baddies and some old favourites! Their conversion of Snow Brothers is also looking very good, as is an original and rather wacky game called Yo Noid! At the booth over the way, Konami's big game was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, while Contra Force looked a pretty good bet for action fans. Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego and King's Quest V are both very good adventures, and Monster in My Pocket, Tiny Toon Adventures, Bucky O'Hare and Laser Invasion all have promise. lkoznia Raisins RISCUL RUTIGUES THE GRAPE ESCAPE ninTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AND THE REST now White and Klashball (Speedball to you and I) were seen at the Sofel stand and Bo Jackson Baseball, Dream Team 3. on-3 Challenge and The Avengers were Data Easts showpieces At the Hudson hang-out catching the limelight were Jackie Chan Kung-Fu (superb stuff). Adventure Island I and II and Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom (my vote for The Best Named Game Of The Show), while AGCI had Wally Bear. Shockwave. Death Race and Chiller. THQ's line-up was impressive, with Peter Pan and the Pirates, Wayne Gretzky Hockey, Videomation (a battery-backed drawing and animation program which is a first for the console scene), Where's Waldo, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (hee, hee). Home Alone (based on the poopy film, but what I want to know is where's the game in that?). The Flash and Swamp Thing. A nice set of games were in evidence at Asmik Evert and Lendl Top Players Tennis, Conquest of the Crystal Palace, Wurm and Boomer II were all very good, and Hal America's Lolo III, Daydreamin' Davey and Kabuki Quantum Fighter were all pretty neat. Zombie Nation from Meldac was quite a hoot, while new Nin. tendo developers Sony were showing off two film licences, Hook! and Hudson Hawk. Yeah, I know I said Ocean were doing those two, but for some reason, Sony are as well Microprose's F-15 Strike Eagle is the best Nintendo flight sim yet, Atlus' Rockin' Cats is certainly unusual and Dragon Warrior III from Enix is a great RPG (they also did Actraiser on the Super Famicom, in case you were wondering) MEGADRIVE MANIA II ur very own Mirrorsoft had Speedball ll and Battle Master on display, and Nuvision across the way were displaying Swamp Thing, Guardian Angels Safety Patrol and Bean Ball Benny Arcade fans will enjoy Street Smart, Treco's superb conversion of the coin-op, and their version of Harrier Ex is also worth a look More arcade stuff was seen on Namco's stand. Quad Chal lenge is a two-player split screen version of the 4-Trax coin-op, and Rolling Thunder Il is a brilliant rendition of the arcade ma chine that's yet to be released in Britain. Namco also showed on Powerball, a game very similar in concept to Speedball, but no where near as good. "

I've decided to list them all (just to show you what's happening in the states), but before you ask, none have a release date in Britain as yet. SJALECO eJALECO IT STARTED AT SAMMY'S The first stand I walked into was manned by a company called American Sammy. Their three titles were Might and Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum, Rocky (based on the films) and Vice: Project Doom. Sunsoft had Super Spy Hunter and Ufouria, while UK people Virgin Games were showing off McKids (somehow tied in with Ronald McDonald and co). Golf Power, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Overlord (better known in this country as Supremacy and it's a fab game to boot). Arcade experts Taito were well flush with product, and Kickmaster. Toki, The Flintstones, Rainbow Islands, Power Blade (the best Nintendo beat 'em up yet), Kiwi Kraze (the New Zealand Story sequel) and Qix completed an impressive line-up. Jaleco were similarly loaded, and War on Wheels, The Last Ninja (same as the massively successful UK computer game). Metal Mech, In Your Face, Maniac Mansion (brill), Pinball Quest, Astynax (it's actually getting on a bit), Bases Loaded II, Goal, Totally Rad and Whomp 'Em were all on display.

"NEWS GAMEBOY A-GO-GO The amount of Gameboy product announced and on display at the show was awesome. Over at Ultra Blades of Steel (Ice Hockey). Star Trek, World Circuit Series and Operation C were out and about. while Atlus had two potato-inspired games, Spud's Adventure and A-Mazing Tater. Ninja Boy from Culture Brain is nice, but Choplifter Il from JVC caused me to stop and have a good look. Nintendo FFICIA SPECIAL REPORT GAME BOY GAME BOY Dig news at the show was the American launch of the Super D Famicom, or the Super Nes (SNES) as it'll be called. It's got a new shape. a squarer body and vile purple reset and eject buttons and slightly updated internals (according to SNES programmers) Along with titles that have already been seen in Japan and on import in the UK such as Mario 4, Pilotwings, F-Zero and Actraiser, there were a whole new bunch on display check out the list! Licensed by Nintendo CULTUREBRA BIGGER AND BETTER JN had a trio of tremendous titles. An early demo of Smash TV was shown, and that looks identical to the coin-op. With much explosions and gratuitous violence. (yum, yum!). WWE Wrestlemania Challenge is a cracker with superlative graphics, great sound and wild n wacky gameplay. This is by far the best wrestling game vet seen, and stars all the most popular WWF characters, like Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior. Finally, there was a roll ing demo of The Simpsons, showing excellent cartoon style se quences that are apparently going to appear in the game. Watch out for it! PALM-SIZED CLASSIC COIN-OPS oin-op fans will be pleased to hear that amongst many converusions appearing on the Gameboy, Paperboy II, Gauntlet II and Marble Madness will soon be available on the Mindscape label. Ballistic have also taken a coin-op bent, but are choosing to go down the classic route, with Asteroids (1978 rock-blastin' fun) and Missile Command (1979 missile-blastin' frolics). Both should be well worth looking out for. BUILT TO WIN Avery early demo running Mon Seta's stand was F1 BTW (Built To Win), a racing game which was very similar in style to F-Zero. but featuring racing cars instead of hovercraft. It certainly looks promising. A big surprise was Data East's Caveman Ninja, a flawless copy of their latest arcade machine, which features hilarious cartoon-style graphics (you should see the expression on the caveman's face when he sees the giant dinosaur at the end of level one his eye pop right out). They also announced Sanction Earth, but didn't get to see it. )))))) AND THERE'S MORE uper Play Action Football was Nintendo's SNES game announcement of the show, while Ultra Games showed Legend of Mystical Ninja and the rather excellent Castlevania IV. On the Hudson stand, Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball looked like it needed quite a bit of work on it, and the Wonderboyinspired Super Adventure Island seemed like fairly bland stuff. Baseball was in evidence with Jaleco, as they showed Super Bases Loaded, while THQ simply had press releases announcing that there were working on Home Alone, Swamp Thing, PitFighter (that should be great). Vanilla Ice (aaaagh), Family Dog (wot?) and Race Drivin' (now that will be interesting! "

"Ocean NEWS ocean OCEANS OF HELPFUL HINTS just a quickie Ocean have launched a helpline for those of Uyou stuck on any of their tricky games! Call the Ocean Helpline on 0626 332533 for a lowdown on the company's re. leases from Batman onwards. Good, eh? MEGADRIVE MEGA MACHINE! After months of speculation, the Megadrive CD-ROM has finally arrived and doesn't it look grand? Reports from Japan say the machine allows vast memory storage and improved graphics. There's a new chip inside the machine which allows more sprites and colours. It also allows the rotation of sprites and even the Super Famicom can't manage that! Sega Japan have set the release date from this mega machine at October, with a totally scrummy price of 200 or less. How much it will cost when it eventually makes its way over here remains to be seen but we've got high hopes for this little beauty and it's not like Sega to disappoint. KICK OFF SOCCER SHOCKER! MEGRCD t could be a dream come true the best footy game ever in the palm of your hand! The hot news is that those sporting folks at US Gold are planning to release Super Kick Off on the Game Gear in early 1992. If portable Kick Off is anything like as fab as its computer daddy, this could well be THE hot cart of next year. Details are scarce right now, but we hear that veteran programmers Tiertex will be handling the conversion. Super Kick Off comes amongst a trio of Game Gear releases planned by US Gold, all converted by Tiertex. The trio kicks off (sorry!) with World Class Leaderboard, due for release about now. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade will be following hot on its heels in time for Christmas.

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY SEGA A hat's small, blue, spiky, and very, very fast? Sonic the Hedge V V hog, that's whol Sega's awesome answer to Nintendo's mar vellous Mario has arrived and he's here to stay! Sonic's a hedgehog with a mission; to free his furry friends from the diabolical clutches of the evil Dr Eggman (a villain so nasty, he makes Al Capone look like Bonnie Langford!). Y'see, Eggman's captured all of Sonic's friends, brainwashed them and encased them in biomechanoid armour programmed to terrorise the world! To free his friends, Sonic has to race through six zones, each consisting of three horizontally scrolling areas. These zones are packed with hazards and puzzles, not to mention Eggman's forces, Sonic puts his out in force to turn Sonic into hedgehog pie! However, Sonic can Z akinto it! fight back by curling into a ball and leaping into any enemy, skewerTIME 1:11 ing them on his spines. By collecting the magic rings which lie scattered around. Sonic is further protected contact with an enemy is neutralised by the rings, but all the rings in Sonic's possession are dropped. Any rings remaining at the end of the level are exchanged for bonus points if Sonic has more than 50. he'll be transported to the bizarre bonus level! At the end of each zone, our sky-blue spiky-top is confronted by the doctor himself, armed with various weapons (including a massive ball and chain, a fire-spitting cannon and a large spike), intent on turning Sonic into hedgehog pie. The spiky one does 1 on his balancing Watch out for the spikes, Sonic! U:33 RINGS 12 LA FSONIC SON OOO MONITOR MAYHEM 'N MALARKEY Hidden at various points around each area lie computer monitors, which bestow Sonic with a special bonus once busted open: RING: Gives Sonic an extra 10 rings. SPARKLE: Encases Sonic in a glittering magic shield. which allows him to race through nasties without getting a scratch! Careful, though, as this is only temporary! SHIELD: Similar to before, but this surrounds Sonic with a large protective sphere, which vanishes upon contact with anything lethal! MAGIC SHOES: Makes Sonic even faster than ever (however difficult that may be!). Only temporary, but helps our spiky star reach parts of the level that other hedgehogs cannot reach... SONIC: Gives Sonic an extra life! Sega said this was going to be good but nobody prepared us for this! Sonic knocked me sideways when he burst forth from the monitor and hasn't let go since, hogging the Megadrive full-time. Sonic may be as cute as hell and play like a dream, but rest assured this game's as tough as your grandad's old boots. Sega have put a huge amount of thought into this, and it shows. The graphics are something very special the best you'll see on the Megadrive. Sonic really looks the part as he charges around the screen, rolling into a ball and putting paid to all manner of bad guys as that superb Sonic theme tune blasts forth from the telly. Here's a game which absolutely oozes quality and one you'll return to time and time again. Sonic has thrown down the gauntlet to Mario in a big way and everyone's favourite Italian plumber must be feeling just a little washed out. I won't say he's necessarily better, but Sonic certainly gives the immortal Nintendo hero a run for his money. To sum up in three words Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! TIM BOONE 000 000 016 "


"REVIEW SONIC THE HEDGEHOG lons TIME 0:40 RINGS SONIC v MARIO WHO'S GOT THE EDGE? Sega are pushing Sonic the Hedgehog as their answer to Nintendo's Mario. The sheer popularity of the rotund Italian plumber from Brooklyn gives Sonic a hell of a lot of work to do. Comparing Sonic to Super Mario Bros 4 on the Super Famicom, it's obvious both have exquisite graphics and sound, although Sonic is a lot faster, brighter and more colourful. As far as depth of play is concerned, Mario 4 is a clear-cut winner but Sonic is just so cute that at the moment you just have to call it a draw. With these two superstars now in a head-to-head battle for supremacy, it's going to be fascinating to watch them try to top each other in all the exploits to come! As usual, watch this space... "


"REVIEW GIVE ME A RING SOMETIME If Sonic has collected more than fifty rings before reaching the end of an area, a giant ring will appear at the finish. Leaping through this will whisk our spiky superhero off to the seriously strange bonus round a rotating maze filled with rings and emeralds! Mastering this maze is no mean feat, and soon your eyes will be spinning with the screen as Sonic strays all over the place! Points are awarded at the end of this round, depending on how many are collected before Sonic falls into one of the exit portals. If enough rings are collected, Sonic gets a continue for his trouble! Grabbing the bonuses at the end of the level! Sunc00 TIME 3:51 RINGS 6 100 100 LOVELY LEVEL LUNACY! Sonic's world is split into six levels, each more treacherous and devious than the last: 1 GREEN HILL ZONE: This may seem like a green and pleasant land, but don't be fooled hordes of crabs and flying adversaries are out in force to finish Sonic before he can start, as well as crumbling platforms which threaten to drop our hero into deep trouble! He's finally here! Sonic has at last made it onto the Megadrive and how! The quality of this cartridge is assured the moment you flick the on switch and are greeted to a quartet of dulcet tones singing out the Sega name! So is this little blue milk guzzler the Mario beater that everyone suspects? Graphically there's no doubt Sonic the Hedgehog is awash with lively, but never garish, colour, which compliments the detailed sprites and backdrops perfectly. The animation throughout the game is top-notch, with Sonic's legs going hell for leather the longer you keep him running, and rolling up into a tight ball as only a hedgehog could to biff those baddies into oblivion. Sound plays an important factor, with stacks of catchy tunes and jingles and some absolutely brilliant spot effects Sonic The Hedgehog is going to be an impossible game to beat, but you're sure going to have fun whilst you attempt it. Better than Mario? I honestly wouldn't like to say. What I will say, however, is that Sonic The Hedgehog is streets ahead of every game of this genre currently available, and I for one am looking forward to the further adventures of this garden-trashing little tinker!

"REVIEW PC .99 BY ELECTRONIC ARTS ario Andretti what a man! He's established himself as a IV champion in all forms of automobile racing since the '60s. Now this game lets you replay his driving career with yourself in the driving seat. Like all young hopefuls you have to start your career by finding a cash backer. Your first sponsor donates $20,000 to finance your first car, but all you can afford with that is a tiny Sprint car to race on the oval dirt circuits of North America. In each race, you get a driver's-eye view through the windscreen of your race car, which is controlled either via keyboard or joystick. Either way, you only have to wrestle with accelerator, brake and steering controls, plus the optional cruise control. There are big money prizes awaiting top drivers, and if you win enough races in the season, your sponsor will up his stake, allowing you to afford a different class of car and move your career one rung up the ladder. The best drivers end up racing 600 horsepower Indy cars in races which are the high point of the American season. Think you can make the grade? I MARIO ANDRETTI RACING CHALLEN The sprint car goes for the ton. POS: 5 100g 896 MPH Mobil TELLO Electronic Arts have produced some stunning 3D games in the past, not least of them being Indianapolis 500, and while that was a great game it suffered a little from the fact that there was only one track, and consequently not that much to do. Mario Andretti's is the next logical step on from Indy, and it has as much hard racing action but it also has the depth of gameplay thay Indy lacked. All the different tracks and the inclusion of the different racing classes make playing really compul sive, because you've just got to get to the next stage of competition. The different cars handle just as you would expect and that and the skill of the other drivers makes this feel more realistic than any other race game I've played on a PC, or indeed any computer. Great graphics, excellent sound and brilliant gameplay at a good price make this an unmissable buy for power PC owners. Try it and see! PAUL GLANCEY ANOTHER DISTINCTIVE RACING GAME The programmers of this epic race game are Distinctive Software Inc, based in the USA. Name sound familiar? It's not surprising if it does, as DSI have produced a couple of other racing games on the PC, namely the excellent 4D Sports Driving, published by Mindscape, and the not-quite-so-excellent-butstill-pretty-good Test Drive 3, which was released by Accolade. Both these games used similar 3D vector graphics routines to Mario Andretti's Racing Challenge, and if you like the look of what you've seen here you might take them for a spin. BULOVA SAYO 022 "


"REVIEW 255 Take a fly-by view of the track The infield camera catches a sprint car collision. LET'S JUST SEE THAT AGAIN Like a lot of recent driving games, Mario Andretti's lets you watch a replay of the last 20 seconds or so of action from a variety of angles. In Electronic's Arts other 3D race game, Indianapolis 500, this provided some merry sport amongst the CVG sickos who would speed around the track in the wrong direction in the hope of creating some spectacular replayable crashes. The replay feature in Mario's isn't quite so sophisticated but it has much the same fun value, even if the game won't let you drive down the track the wrong way. INSTANT REPLAT The same crash from another camera angle. BIULOVA SA VYO UPDATE No other versions planned at the moment, but that's what they said about Indy. Electronic Arts say they might well produce an Amiga conversion of Mario Andretti's Racing Challenge if the PC version goes down well. 023 "

"REVIEW AMIGA BY ACTIVISION .99 olonisation is a tricky business, as discovered in Activision's first simulation of planet management, Millenium 2.2. Nowa days Mother Earth is but a shattered shell of its former sell, and what little life remains must now set about a massive rebuilding pro gramme. But it ain't gonna be no pushover. The first thing to be done is train some of the public to actually do the jobs needed to get away from Earth Scientists, factory workers and, of course, space, marines. Then there's the job of building the necessary equipment to mine, create ships and space stations, and generally do what ever is necessary to create a better life for the people, The player is cast as president of the Earth, planning the great exodus to a new life. The future of the remaining populace is in the balance if they can't build what they need, life will indeed be shor . and they can't build without materials. It's a vicious circle and one which you, el Presidente, must break if you are to prosper. Break free by knocking together ships, creating new, more powerful addons for them with the help of your scientists and then heading of into the wide, black yonder of the galaxy to collect the materials re quired by the production line to build, because what's left on Earth isn't much. THE SUN SEAM MATERIAL DEU It's all looking good in the shuttle bay IRON TITANIUM CARBON COPPER SOBROGEN 444 RICS YOU'VE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT YOUR LIVES... First things first you're going to have to train the workers to do the jobs you need. There are three main professions in Deuteros. Research. Production and Marines. Researchers create the designs for new ships and equipment, whilst the Production department, surprise surprise, builds the gizmos and whatsits from the Researchers' blueprints. And until someone designs automatic pilots, the Marines hold the position of intergalactic taxi-drivers. UN se PASVEIS Although Deuteros clings onto the same basic style of gameplay to Millenium 2.2, it's been sufficiently enhanced to make it more than just another hum-drum sequel. It's incredibly taxing on the brain, even though there's a host of different screens there to help you along the way. Although at times it can become frustrating things don't become so bad that you want to hurl the machine out of the window and go back to blasting away at Alien Turtle Invaders IV. Graphics in this sort of software are usually there more for necessity than effect and, while there are a wealth of well-drawn piccies displaying for instance, the different items you can build, they serve their purpose without being dazzling. The same goes for the sound effects, which I must admit are rather thin on the ground, but once you delve deep into the game the lack of noise is pretty unnoticeable. Summ ing up, a pretty game, but looks aren't important when you have the sort of complex, demanding and brain draining challenge which Deuteros certainly is.

"REVIEW NINTENDO .99 BY NINTENDO It's the early 21st Century. The Earth, weakened by decades of environmental pollution, is under assault by vicious extra-terrestrial forces bent on savaging our world for what precious little resources remain Just one man stands between these foul creatures and global domination Captain Skyhawk! He may have a silly name, but Cappy's packing enough firepower do do the business and save the planet from those evil alien hordes. Thank goodness for that, eh? SKY HIGH BLASTING BONANZA! Equipped with the latest version of the F-14 Tomcat (capable of carrying Maverick and Phoenix missiles as well as wide range scatter bombs and armed with a deadly 20mm cannon), the Cap has to fly through five alien-infested levels, each split into three stages. 1 LOW FLIGHT FIGHTING: The aliens have constructed numerous bases across the face of the planet, and Skyhawk's got to make sure these are put out of commission permanently! This may sound simple, but when you've got hordes of enemy fighters, ground tanks, anti-aircraft cannons, and all sorts of lethal weaponry trying to fry the good Captain's undercarriage, life becomes that much more difficult! On later levels. much-needed supplies have to be air-dropped to storage bases as well. Crumbs! 2 BURNER RETURNS: Yep, that's right this level is like a simplified version of the Sega coin-op. Enemy fighters roar in and out of the screen and Skyhawk's just got to blow as many out of the air as possible! Of course his adversaries don't take too kindly to this, and aren't afraid to let off a few missiles of their own to blow Skyhawk's fighter away! It's not difficult to tell it's summer all the software houses are obviously thinking about going on their hols as opposed to coming up with fresh, new ideas. Take Captain Skyhawk for instance. Actually, don't it's all been done before, and better. The game is a mish-mash of contrasting styles, from Zaxxon to Afterburner to Elite: from which the docking sequence has obviously been lifted (albeit somewhat less impressively). Captain Skyhawk isn't a bad game as such, in fact ! quite enjoyed playing it for a time until I realised how ordinary it is. Rare, so famous for quality cartridge software, are doing themselves no favours with their latest release. We are talking so-so graphics, disappointing sound and a difficulty setting which seems to drop the further you progress. My advice is take a good, long look at Captain Skyhawk before delving into that wallet, otherwise you may be left feeling a bit shortchanged. PAUL RAND 1900 HD *x00 0016950 00 007 032 "

"REVIEW CAPTAIN SKYHAWK CAPTAIN SKYHAWK BUY ISSILE RETURN TO MEMES FREREST NOT SO RARE, REALLY... Rare (formerly known as Ultimate, reknowned for their gobsmackingly great Spectrum games back in the mid-eighties) are definitely a force to be reckoned with when it comes to Nintendo games. Two of their latest titles Solar Jetman (the latest title to feature the intergalactic loony, and soon to be converted to computers by Storm), and Snake, Rattle and Roll (which scored a whopping 95% back in issue 112) both feature stunning graphics, incredible sound and gameplay addictive enough to have you superglued to your screen for ages! I didn't think Captain Skyhawk was THAT bad, but I have to agree that it isn't one of Rare's better games. The worst thing you can say about it is that there isn't quite enough to each of the three games to make each one worthwhile. It would have been better to base the whole game on the low-level flight section, because the Afterburner bit is pretty dull, and the docking bit just seems pointless. Once you get quite a way into Captain Skyhawk, the action speeds up a lot showing what good programming can achieve on a Nintendo. Unfortunately, while the programming is top quality, the game design is where the flaw lies, and though Skyhawk is better than many Nintendo games, Rare are capable of much more, as they've shown with Snake, Rattle 'n' Roll, Solar Jetman, Cobra Triangle, etc. Not a top-of-shopping-list game, but definitely worth considering.

"Who says CVG never covers Lynx games? Atari's latest Lynx foursome are some of the best yet, and here's Paul Glancey and special guest star, Rob Swan, to tell you all about them. .99 WARBIRDS .99 APB is a conversion of one of Atari's slightly oddball coinops which puts the player in the driving seat of a California Highway Patrol car. Every morning you're give a quota of lawbreakers to apprehend, and if you don't meet that quota before your time or fuel runs out, boy does the sarge get annoyed! When the car's siren is activated a target appears in front of it which you have to place over the felon of your choice who moans vociferously as he pulls over. Don't run into any innocent drivers or drive your car through innocuous doughnut stands because that earns demerits, and ten demerits earns you instant dismissal from the force! That-ho! Reach for the skies over the Western Front in this World War One biplane sim. Make your plane as unstoppable as you like then start on one of six missions, flying against one, two or three computer opponents of varying skill. Alternatively, up to four players can \"Lynx-up\" for a right old aerial gang-fight. Your combat in the clouds is depicted in inflato-sprite 3D which, though not as astonishing as Blue Lightning, is still impressive. As you would expect, the controls aren't as complicated as a computer flight-sim and the speed control (an engine on-off switch) though extremely simple, is effective you need to perform tight turns. There isn't a lot of variety to the gameplay (it would have been nice to have something other dogfights to participate ina bombing mission for example) but what's there is good fun for a while. HELP CATCH THIS LAST SEE | HUI10 PAUSED le GRAPHICS 89 SOUNDS PLAYABILITY LASTABILITY OVERALL 84 APB is a lot of laughs to play, and it includes a load of the arcade game's sampled speech which really livens things up.

"NINJA GAIDEN .99 PACLAND .99 PAUSED PAUSED Dac's back! That munching yellow beach ball returns once again, this time in a conversion of the Namco coinop that was itself a spin-off from the TV cartoon show. As usual PacMan is up to his neck in hassle, because this time he's found a stricken fairy, and has to return her to Fairyland. Not an easy prospect, however, as this involves haring through the horizontally-scrolling PacLand, whilst avoiding those ever-present ghosts (who have taken to driving around in taxis and aircraft!). Of course, Pac can temporarily turn the tables by munching a power pill, and in turn, chomp on a ghost or two! If you were a fan of the arcade game, this perfect conversion will be right up your tree-lined avenue. However, the action is a bit samey all the way through, so anyone used to piles of excitement may well be disappointed. TEPAUSE DE TERT PAUSE DE Anyone who was a fan of Tecmo's Shadow Warriors coinop will be instantly familiar with this game, because it is in fact, the same game! Not surprisingly, you play the Ninja of the title who is given the unenviable task of beating up loads of muscley blokes in hockey masks and fat men throwing telephone poles around and that's just on level one! Telephone boxes, oil drums and various other objects lie scattered around, and if broken, reveal all manner of Ninjitsu goodies, such as swords, extra energy. gems and extra lives. The masked marvel can also grab hold of lampposts, and can swing back and forwards any mug stupid enough to get in the way cops a pair of size tens in the face! For the Lynx's first beat 'em up, Ninja Gaiden is little short of superb, and really addictive, too. An excellent title. and one which any self-respecting Lynx owner should race out and shell out for at once.

"VAL IT'S AN OUTRAGE HONEST! Dear YOB, Now then young man, you'd better get your hands out of your pockets and pay attention, because I've got a very important message to tell you. I think that every single game in the universe should be banned. Now that may seem just a teensy-weensy bit harsh to somebody as illeducated as youself, but I have a few points with which to back up my theory. Computer games have been corrupting innocent youngsters ever since time began. Just look at the ancient Uridium, for example. Why, my young son had only been playing that for a few minutes when, blow me down, he decided to build a spaceship in his bedroom and, in no time at all, he was terrorising the seven planets of Plegbottom! It just goes to show how difficult youngsters find it to sep. arate games from reality. I also think that the Dizzy games should be banned. Another young son of mine had been playing a few Dizzy games all week when the young urchin suddenly decided to make his own Dizzy costume and walk the streets whilst wearing it. It was a sad day indeed, when he walked straight off a seventy-foot clift because he couldn't see where he was going.. It's an outrage! I'm sure you agree that all computer games should now be immediately banned. Daniel Salter, Rotherham, S Yorks YOB: Too right. I know a young man (not my son, whatever the judge says) who was fried to a crisp sticking his fingers into the cartridge slot of his Megadrive to see whether it had Virtual Reality built in. He was an idiot, though just like you. YO! Yob's Mailbag goes global this month, with letters coming in from all sorts of far-flung places!

Well I have a lot of Videoconsoles at home: a PC Engine with 20 great games, a Nintendo NES with 20 great games, a Megadrive with 25 great games and a Power Base Converter for the Mega Drive and 30 Games for it. I also have a Amiga 1000 with 2.5 MB RAM, A Sidecar with 640 Kbyte Ram and Hard disk, 1 m ext. 5 1/4 Zoll Floppy and 1 ext 3 1/2 Floppy which I use 0 with both. It's a good and great fact, that your magazine is the most actual I know: I was glad to see that you were the first magazine to test the excellent Final Match Tennis for the PC-Engine, the brilliant Mickey Mouse Game for Mega Drive and the great Eye of the Beholder for the Amiga. Well, and I think your maga. N zine is too expensive for too few (8,50 DM for 115 pages). Take a look at our German's M Power Play it has about 150 Pages for just 6,50 DM!

Skull & Crossbones: It is crap. There it is. What do you think? James Stratton, Altringham, Cheshire YOB: When can you start? "


"be at least something for your Richard Leadbetter! Well and I have to say that Richard is my favourite gametester (or should I say staff writer?) because he's critical enough and his favourite games seem to be my favourite games, too. (We seem to have the same liking!) In the 4/91 issue the article on page 15 is funny. I think, (about Richard) because Richard looks a bit like the \"famous five's Dick\", but it is improbable that he has been the inspiration for Enid Blyton to create the Famous Five's Dick, because the Famous Five are nearly about 20 years old, and I think that Richard is just between 18 and 23 years old today so that he was too young to be an inspiration when the famous five's Dick figure was created. My other hobbies are watching Pro Wrestling, Tennis, Ice Hockey and Football on TV. I like the Pop Music of Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue, who are very popular in Germany and in the UK, as well as the music of David Hasslehoff, who is very popular in Germany.

After dropping acid, she freaked out and hijacked a school bus full of orange penguins. That's not all: in a tragic accident my green, martian brother was launched into space and is probably on Venus by now. Imagine, he's up there on some godforsaken planet, dodging gamma rays. Not a pretty thought. I am starting a multi-billion pound project to get him back, and what we need is a kind, handsome and gallant YOB to help us out. Say. one hundred pounds in cash would cover it nicely. My grandmother would be very grateful; she takes to nice, kind, handsome, gallant YOBs. Whenever I see a new edition of CVG, I inform Yoda on my special intergalactic, digitised, fuel-injected, seven-week old smelly kipper. After that, I flick through the pages until I find these two then read the letters and your comments. If I crack up and fall to the floor in small, hexagonal pieces then I buy it. If not, I don't. But that has never happened yet. I love to scoff at the cretins that attempt to write interesting letters, they are about as interesting as Bongo the Clown dancing to \"Oh boy, my pimple's turning yellow\" with a five-year old cheese and pickle sandwich lodged up his bum.

"REVIEWMAN MEGADRIVE .00 BY SEGA BATTI They said it would never happen, and now it has. World War Ill has arrived, and you're slap bang in the firing line... As Commander of an Abrams M1 Main Battle Tank, you're in charge of one of the most devastating ground war machines the allies can produce. Now the taxpayers are asking you to earn all that peacetime pay by halting the Soviet advance into Germany all on your lonesome. Blimey! Lucky you packed your 1,500 horsepower turbine engine, 120mm cannon with thermal night-sight capability and on-board ballistic computer or you might be in real trouble! OK soldier, make tracks for the front... SIMULAT OF T-80 ARMAMENT: 125mm main gun complemented by one 7.62mm co-ax machine gun and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun. 3D THRILLS 'N' SPILLS! M1 Abrams features possibly the best true-world 3D yet seen on the Megadrive. Sega's little black beauty is shifting some serious maths to keep everything moving smoothly in a believable fastaction battlefield. This probably has quite a lot -u i ini uno a la voi to do with the input of Realtime Software those three dimensional maestros responsible for Carrier Command and Battle Command. Sight In fact, M1 is best described as a kind of halfway house beIween the complexities of Battle Command and simple thrills and spills of the classic Atari arcader Battlezone. The game is finely balanced between realism and playability, leaving you to TADS chose between a quick blast and an early bath or a long, careBox ful campaign and some medals to shine in your old age... -Speedometer HEAT -Targeting Tank/Turret Tank Turret SabotReadout Outlines AX Thermal ZoomTempSmokeCHECK YOUR WEAPONS! The M1 may be the best battle tank in Europe, but this yankee doodle dandy wouldn't be worth diddlysquat without some high class weaponry to back it up. Here are the shooters to shout about: COAX: This multi-purpose machine gun comes in well handy for close-quarter combat. It's also supposed to be used against enemy aircraft who stray too close, but whose going to be dumb enough to sit behind this and stare down the barrel into the jaws of an incoming attack chopper? Not me, matey! SMOKE: Definitely handing when the enemy are pants-wettingly closem, your smoke discharger belches out all sorts of muck to mess up enemy guidance systems and make you all but invisible and ready to crash into the nearest wall 'Cos you're blind as a bat as well... CANNON: Your Rheinmetall 120mm cannon fires three types of round, range depending on which you choose. The shells available are: SABOT: An armor-piercing, fin-stabilized round which cuts through armour like a hot knife through butter at anything up to 2,500 metres HEAT: A high explosive anti-tank weapon which detonates before contact with the target, producing fiery gas which melts armour at up to 2,000 metres. AX: An experimental wire-guided anti-helicopter shell which is slow to load because it is one big and complicated piece of kit with a range up to 4,000 metres. The Mt's sophisticated scanner.

"BRAMS REVIEW D525 EEGFINC CEO TOR SERIES MAKE TRACKS WITH THE BEST... M-1 ARMAMENT: 120mm gun, two 7.62mm machine guns amd a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun. It takes four highly trained, super tough, bubble gumchewing yanks to man your average M1 and every man jack of them has his work well and truly cut out! You can take the controls for all four Driver, Gunner, Loader and Commander and are expected to become quite an all-round ace to delve deep into the game. Taking on all four roles, it's crucial to sort out your strategy or you'll all end up as scrap metal while the enemy lumbers onward. You won't get far if you sit in one place and shoot everything in sight the enemy outnumbers you ten times over and those scary Soviets just keep on coming... TANKS FOR EVERYTHING... M1 gives you the chance to battle through the entire World War Ill campaign or chicken out and take on individual missions. Here's what you can expect: The Moselle Defence: The Sovs have cut through Allied defences! There's one thing standing between the West and the advancing metal hordes you! Ho-hum. A tank game on the Megadrive. Where are the extra lives, the power pods, the end-of-level guardians? Ahh, but there aren't any, for this is one of a new breed of Megadrive simulations which dispense with the need for zillions of different keys by utilising pull-down menus, and to great effect. With a host of different missions to attempt, either singly or as an on-going campaign, and a commanding officer who has no qualms about shooting you if the Ruskies win, Abrams Battle Tank pulls no punches. The 3D is smooth and effective, although the playing area can be devoid of enemy vehicles at times. But, once in the thick of a shooting battle there'll not be much time to notice lack of tanks as most of the time will be spent trying to decimate the one or two BMP's and T-72's right in front of you and happily blasting away at your armour. If you crave for something radically different and truly lasting on the Megadrive, jump into the cockpit and drive away an M1 today!

EEARING 633 This must be the first 3D combat sim on the Megadrive the first of many, by all accounts. If this is the shape of things to come, then I'm sure as hell looking forward to all the others! Sega's little black beauty handles this type of game very well indeed which is quite a surprise and a refreshing change from all the shoot 'em ups and platform romps we've come to know and love. The 3D works well, there's plenty to do and it's easy to become absorbed in the game especially with the after-battle rating system. Where M1 does fall down for me is the lastability stakes. Once you've got over the initial awe of enjoying a 3D sim on the Megadrive, it all becomes very so-so and there's no real long-term challenge on offer for the rather hefty asking price. One of those games which is very good but could have been great... TIM BOONE Hanover Push: Destroy the Soviet base near the city using whatever means necessary.

"REVIEW PC ENGINE .00 THANKS BY BULLET-PROOF SOFTWARE Thanks to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the loan of W hen Alexey Pajitnov came up with the idea for Tetris, he the Hatris gamecard used in VV wasn't just creating a game he was changing the face of this review. home entertainment, transforming millions of ordinary people into shape-addicted puzzle freaks! Tetris became one of the best-known names in computing gaming and is one reason why the Gameboy is so popular. Not con tent with taking over our lives with his first game, the Soviet superstar has dug out his calculator once again to produce the perplexing follow-up Hatris. Get set for more strife in all shapes and sizes.. System HAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT! Hatris is just as the title suggests Tetris with hats. Various shaped headpieces fall down the screen in pairs, and the object is to place them on the bonces of various lolk lurking about al the bottom of the playing area. Whereas in Tetris the idea was lo create horizontal lines. Hatris requires the player to form groups of the same hat on one head to clear the set and avoid hitting the top of the screen Game Over Sounds easy? It is at the beginning but just wait until you ve completed a couple of levels! PC Engine Who says Russians are boring? Not me! First we had Tetris, the game which did more for Western-Soviet relations than the INF Treaty. Now that lovely Mr Pajitnov bursts back with Hatris, which should keep the technologically advanced nations of the world quiet while Gorby mucks around with his Baltics. There's not a lot of difference between this and Alexey's earlier classic once you've stripped it to the bare bones but, like Tetris, that indefinable something which made that game stand out from the crowd flows through his latest creation. As before, graphics are functional rather than at. tractive and sound is of a similar, average quality but don't be put off! If there's one title to put the PC Engine back on the gamesplayers' map, it's Hatris. This game could do for the Engine what its predecessor did for the Gameboy. Great fun! PAUL RAND Cramo SCORE 1916 "


"REVIEW KEEPING YOUR HEAD... At certain points throughout the game, the player is invited to remove some hats from the playing area in exchange for a new one to play with. Not only that, but from time to time one of the falling hats is replaced with either an orange or blue flame. Orange fire clear away hats until a different type is reached, while those blue burning beauties will incinerate an entire row! ZA25 25 SCORE Holgigian KINGS No! Not again! Just when I'd hidden my Gameboy Tetris cart and spent the rest of the week in cold turkey, the Soviets produce this and I'm hooked once again! Hatris isn't exactly a sequel to Tetris, more like a variation on the theme. Graphically it's nothing to write home about but neither was the original. In the sound department the game is also uninspired a jolly little tune burbles away as you play. So what is it about Hatris that makes it so special? It's that fabulous gameplay which just blows everything else out of the water! Sorting those hats out to stay alive will soon have you hooked and you'll feel those Tetris sweats coming on as that headgear just keeps on coming! What can I say?

Unfortunately the good old local Tyrannosaurus Rex nas ealen all the horses, so he'll just have to find something else for himself and the rest of the T-Bone tribe to chow down on. But would you credit it? All the local Kentucky Fried Pierodactyl restaurants are closed and nobody can stand the McUgs Mammothburger with Cheese (those round, green things are awful!). So il's left to Prehistorik to search out mountains of grub with the aid of his club. And what nosh is he going to cosh? Anything he can get his hands on from animals to whatever they have hidden in their caves. But Prehistorik has failed to reckon with his intended prey. the many creatures of his land, ranging from baby dinosaurs in the mountains to penguins in the Arctic and grizzly bears in the forest Not only those, but at the end of each land is a big baddy which out pre-historic hero must overcome before he is allowed to travel 10 further areas Prehistorik is not completely on his owo out there, though.

"REVIEW The fish look unhappy and rightly so! Looks like the grizzly's been at the mushrooms he's seeing arrows! HILARIOUS HISTORIC HEROICS! So this is why Stone Age Man took so long to invent the wheel he was far too busy mucking around in the air! Prehistorik has balloons and hangliders positioned near to otherwise impassable areas of his world to send him soaring through the clouds and back to earth to continue his hunt! PRIMAVERA PLUNDERING THE PREHISTORIC PANTRY Just because all the food's been hidden in caves doesn't mean that Prehistorik isn't going to go in and nick it cos he is. Things aren't going to be that simple, however, as most of the caves are guarded by fires, bats and well 'ard spiders and things! From time to time our hero will come across huge eggs and other interesting things. Give them all a good honest bashing and see what pops out! g For some reason there's a fair bit of interest in the Stone Age lately, what with Chuck Rock and now this offering from Titus. What hits you first about Prehistorik is the graphical humour from the squat, bignosed hero himself to a wealth of jolly adversaries, including a stork bearing a more than passing resem. blance to Big Bird from Sesame Street and a swordfish with a five o'clock shadow! Playing the game is a joy it's tough but never really frustrating, although long-term playability may be in doubt due to the rather simple nature of the game. Sound is well done, especially the various tunes which add quite a raucous atmosphere to the proceedings. It's fast and furious and, at the end of the day, a good laugh. What you may not know is that Prehistorik was produced using the STOS game designer! Unbelievable or what?! Prehistorik isn't what you'd consider am essential purchase, but you certainly wouldn't be embarrassed with this in your software collection. PAUL RAND "

GUARDIAN ONE: It's not size that's important honest! He may be big but this Tyrannosaurus has an Achilles Heel (or should that be foot?) which will swiftly bring him down to size. The first thing to strike you about Prehistorik (apart from that lethal-looking club) is the overwhelming humour in the game. The graphics are great-ranging from some horrific enemies to lovely wide-eyed little creatures so cute the very last thing you want to do is eat them! The game also plays very well incredible when you realise it was put together using the STOS designer and the theme tune is one of those which rattles around in your brain for absolutely ages! After a while the game can become rather repetitive it's quite a bind having to trudge back through the screens to find food you missed first time round. That said, Prehistorik is a hoot from the first swing of the club to the last stone-age enemy to bite the dust. If you're looking for laffs, and a fair old challenge to boot, club together some cash and shuffle on down to your nearest softshop today!

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE BY TOAPLAN .00 A meeting with Mr Nasty! o there you are, standing in the launch bay of the mothership, checking the controls of your latest top-level fighter the Zero Wing, a real breakthrough in military technology. Designed and constructed by the finest in the field, this blasting little beauty is more than a match for the opposition. Thank goodness for that, 'cos right now you find yourself slapbang in the middle of war! Your former allies the CATS have done the dirty and are attacking without warning! The sirens blare, screaming for an emergency scramble. Imme. diately you flick the shining switches, pull back the throttle and shoot off into the thick of the action just as a gamma missile soars into the launchbay of your mothership, blasting it to the back of beyond! With thirty-six squadrons and a three-mile battlecruiser behind you, this was going to be a cinch, Now that you're all alone, things are going to be a bit tricky... WHAT A LOT YOU'VE GOT! Although you start off with a pretty crabby single-shot peashooter, blowing up baddies gives access to some rather tasty add-on weapons. DRONES: Put one above and one below your ship to triple your firepower and seriously huff those bad guys. Without these little cuties you might as well wave bye-bye to life, the universe and everything! D. 'The Megadrive is looking good: what with fabby platform games in the guise of the awesome Sonic The Hedgehog and now shoot 'em ups with the well 'ard Zero Wing. I'd not be too far off the mark to say this is probably as close a copy of R-Type as you can get on Sega's 16-bit cracker, what with the various pick-ups and shields, the novel approach to front-end, bolt-on security and the general layout of the levels which will test the most hardened blast bandit on the simplest setting. Graphically, Zero Wing cannot be faulted, from the great intro sequence to the quality and workmanship of the sprites and backdrops in the game. The programmers haven't copped out in the sound department either catchy, raucous tunes and seat-of-the-pants SFX are the order of the day. This game is just a pleasure to play! PAUL RAND LASERS: Not the kind that GUIDED MISSILES: Just imdoctors use to get rid of nasti-agine the state of the ness in the innards does enemies' trousers when they the same sort of thing to see a dozen of these babies alien invaders, mind you. Le twisting and turning their way thall right toward their exhaust! 060 "


" THANKS Thanks to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the review cartridge. SPEED: As the name suggests, this adds more \"ooh\" to your boosters for that extra special oomph and faster action all round! Each of these weapons can be boosted by up to three times their initial strength, which should wipe the smug grins off the faces of your adversaries... Messing with an enemy legion. GO WILD WITH THE CATS... Here's a quick lowdown on some of the goodies (and baddies!) in store across the eight luscious levels of Zero Wing. So strap yourself in and prepare for a flight and fight to remember... LEVEL 1: It's all systems go as all sorts of early nasties try to tell you it's time for an early bath. Just grab one of them with your on-board suction gun and make that sucker pay by taking all the shots! Old ugly the end-of-level boss is fairly quickly conquered. 506 SOUN Bio-mechanical nastiness. LEVEL 2: The squares are everywhere as you take on the CATS' secondary defence systems, trying to manoeuvre through the moving obstacles to confront a massives circular beast which spits shoots missiles from its mouth! STANB guardian about to meet its doom! "


"REVIEW ZERO WING ZERO WING LEVEL 3: Now the action takes place in a metallic world full of all manner of robotic rogue, including a huge The Zero end-of-level cybernoid who Wing fires makes the Terminator look for all its like Basil Brush! And if robots worth! have feelings, he's definitely in one helluva bad mood. LEVEL 4: The shortest stage, this involves staying alive while flying around a ginormous spaceship num. LEVEL 5: Fly through the bered 9999. This huge horror wire netting to take on any isn't going to go down withthing the enemy can chuck at out a fight... you (which is quite a lot, actually) and watch out for the platforms on legs! Move through some R-Typeish backgrounds and blow the enerny domes back where they belong! LEVEL 6: The CVG choice for best level of the lot! Simply brilliant. Wait for the robots to dig tunnels through the landscape and follow them through. avoiding all those nasties hell-bent on your destruction. Survive this (hah!) and... LEVEL 7: Recoil in horror as Here it is the game which you witness the exploding breaths new life into shoot skulls of doom! Watch out 'em ups on the Megadrive! when you blow these bony Just when we thought we'd baddies away, because they blown away the last alien fragment into tiny pieces of horror and were getting just lethal shrapnel! If that's not a bit bored with the so-so enough, you've then got to sameness of it all, along contend with the mother of comes Zero Wing to blow all aliens tentacles and the boredom away! With its everything! Get through that super-smooth gameplay, beautifully defined graphics. in one piece and... rocking sound track, amazing explosions and incredible LEVEL 8: You've reached end-of-level bosses, this game has the lot! I suggest you the final challenge. Now wimp out and begin playing the game on easy level those crazy CATS are abso otherwise you won't see too much because those bad lutely spitting fury, and we're guys are lethal! This is an extremely addictive blaster not going to tell you anything you'll return to again and again until those uncool CATS about them except to say have finally bitten the dust and you've saved the galaxy they're mad and bad. Survive once again. Zero Wing is one of those carts which sitsall that and prepare yourself there just begging to be played until you finally crack and for a showdown with the Big give it another go. Gimme, gimme, gimme... Boss. Oh, be sure to pack TIM your brown trousers... BOONE FUN WITH TRACTOR BEAMS VOL 638 Unfortunately this universe doesn't give you floating defence pods to attach to your spacecraft, unlike some we could mention. But don't despair, for in Zero Wing you're equipped with a handy SOUNDS beam which allows you to grab hold of a bad guy and slap him onto the front of your ship! w pen ycinare MEGADRITE GRAPHICS PLAYABILITY LASTABILITY 1913 SELE OVERALL 93 062 "


"DE EROS Actual 16 Bit Screens THE NEXT MILLENIUM It is the end of the 31st Century. Nearly one thousand years ago man colonised the moon, and from there created a range of human mutations which were left to develop other planets. At the same time, life on earth was destroyed by a cataclysmic climatic change. Now the mutant races are at war with each other, and man has returned to Earth, rebuilt civilisation, and forgotten about past adventures. Deep in Earth City, plans have been made to explore space again. The race has started to develop Earth's resources, to research new technology, to build for future adventures. You must control the training, research, resources, production and stores of Earth City in a complex strategic battle to maximise the planet's supplies. You must construct and pilot the hi-tech space shuttles and ships needed for mankind to venture out into the furthest reaches of the war-torn solar system. Operation Deuteros has begun.

"PIT-FIGHTER MAR SISTER Atari's Pit-Fighter created quite a stir when it was unleashed into UK arcades in the summer of 1990. The arcade beat 'em up scene had been pretty quiet since Capcom had released Street Fighter, but Pit-Fighter revived the public's interest with it's three-player action, spectacular digitised graphics and unusual scenario. The game itself is a no-holds-barred, bare-knuckle prize. fight staged in a seedy underground sports arena. Each player chooses one of three characters to fight as either Buzz, a wrestler, Ty the kickboxer, or Kato, a Karate champion. The three combatants' basic skills are the same, but each has two specialist super-moves to help him out when things get rough And things certainly do get rough! There are a stack of savages straining at the leash to pound your face, with names such as \"Angel\" (the delectable female portrayed on this month's cover). \"Chainman Eddie\" and \"Mad Miles\". Every third match is a grudge match fought between the three players, and at the end of the line is the current PitFighter Champion, \"The Ultimate Warrior\"! It's not just the other fighters who give you aggro, either. The crowd who cheer from the sidelines are, frankly, scum. They want to see some heavy-duty violence and if you decide you'd rather run away than be beaten up, they're likely to boot you back into the arena and straight into the fists of some heavily-muscled bozo! At the end of each match, the winning fighter receives his prize in the form of a pile of cash. A knockout is rewarded with bonus cash, and if you stomped on your opponents faces while they were down, you earn a brutality bonus! "

Dit-Fighter's graphics were one of the features that set it apart from other arcade fighting games. For a start, ALL the graphics are digitised, so the fighters are actually real people who have been filmed performing their different actions. The arena is displayed in 3D, and the screen scrolls and actually zooms smoothly in and out to keep the fighters in view. The fighters can move around each other over the full area of the arena, and the sprites expand smoothly when they come to the front of the pit, and shrink when they move away. CONVERSION SELECT YOUR FIGHTER KICKING! Incredibly, Domark's conI versions of Pit-Fighter manage to replicate the arcade game's powerful graphic effects very well thanks to some pretty DEK 0:0 1:3 RECORD swish programming by the CONSOLE guys at Teque (who also produced Badlands for DoCLOBBERIN' mark). All versions (exTIME! cept, possibly, the C64 version) feature digitised Although Domark aren't graphics and sprite expanresponsible for them, sion, which look amazing conversions of Pit-Fighter on the Amiga as these are due to appear on the screenshots demonstrate. Megadrive, the Super PC fans are in for a treat, NES (the Super Famias Domark promise the com) and, believe it or PC version will use 256 not, the Game Boy! colour VGA graphics to The Megadrive version make the game look is due out in the USA in EXACTLY like the coin-op! the Autumn and, hence, What Domark haven't been able to include is the game's will doubtless be available three player mode, but they have managed to keep a two through importers soon. player mode which should be enough to satisfy most people. gramming for this version, Tengen are doing the proAs in the arcade game, though, you do get the choice of three characters to fight as. but from what's already The conversions will be available on Amiga. Spectrum. been seen at the recent Amstrad, C64 and PC in the Autumn. Chicago CES, it looks like they haven't been able to get the sprite-scaling out of the Megadrive's graphics chips. However, AWESOMELY DONE the three buttons on the joypad will easily be able De to emulate the three buttons on the coin-op, making the game slightly more comfortable to play than SEIGHT PURSE the computer versions. Pit-Fighter should be right up the Super NES' street, because the machine's special graphics chips can make light work of recreating the game's super-smooth scrolling and CLOEK 1:31 RECORD sprite-scaling. Toy Headquarters Inc of America have managed to program all of the coin-op in (apart from the three METAL HEAVY METAI player mode) and they reckon that it \"plays just like the arcade game\" (apart from the three player mode). Toy Headquarters Inc are also programming the Game Boy version, which should be... ah... rather more challenging than programming the Super NES version. Again, THQ reckon it \"plays just like the arcade game!\", and while sceptics may scoff, It is said that the way the Game Boy handles its screen memory makes the sprite scaling easier than you s would expect. We can but wait and see... KOTO "

Now entitled Armalyte The Final Run, the idea remains the same simply blast seven shades out of any. thing that moves!

Keep your eyes peeled and twenty-six sovs handy... ...Cinemaware may be shutting up shop, but two of their planned titles are still to grace the Amiga. Rollerbabes is a mixture of roller derby, boxing, wres tling, skateboarding and hockey sounds Weird City if you ask us. The other is TV Sports Baseball, featuring a complete 162 game season, 25 man rosters, 5 man reserve lists. 26 teams of all time great players and all the other usual odds and sods associated with the TV Sports series. Both of these will splash down during the summer, so watch the skies... ...Speaking of Cinemaware, TV Sports Football should be out and about on the Mirror Image budget label as you read this, for the meagre sum of .99... ... Those amazing Turtles show no sign of laying down and giving up the ghost Turtles 2 (a conversion of the brill Konami coin-op) has been signed up by Mirrorsoft.

Galdregon's Domain isn't a terget for your shekels? Well, the rible purchase at this price, but there are better budget adventures package contains a small but de. around. Try the Zork games or Bard's Tale instead. tailed manual. a single disk conOVERALL taining the kit itself, and an excellent tutorial video, which explains the uses and functions of the kit, as well as showing what the system is capable of! Initially, the kit is rather tough to get to grips with, but the simple menus make life a touch easier, and once you get the hang of constructing polygons, grouping them together to create solid shapes, and then manipulating those shapes to build complete objects, things come together nicely. If you have the inclination, you can build complete worlds with buildings that have fully furnished interiors, vehicles (or anything you want, come to think of it), and then view these from any possible angle. As far as the game-creating element is concerned, a small amount of \"programming' is required, but the commands used are all explained in detail in the manual. As far as control panels are concerned, several are included with the package, but the artists amongst you can design your own using Deluxe Paint ST, DEGAS Elite or Neochrome. Overall, this is an excellent utility which will give would be game designers a chance to show what they're made of, as well as a useful(?) system for Mum and Dad if they want to redesign the living room(??!) AIthough it's all very costly (forty sovs is a trifle steep). 3D Construction Kit is a professional product that will appeal to anyone with an urge to create their own little world. 65% ...NEWS FLASH... ...Arc Developments (programmers of the Forgotten Worlds and Crackdown conversions) are putting the finishing touches to ST Armalyte for Thalamus.

"BYTESIZE CBM 64 BYTESIZE KIXX MULTIMIXX 2 Rob Swan bursts on to the C64 scene this month, only to find that all that's left are .99 a few mere budget releases a collection Here's not one, not two, but three blasts from the past, all in one of three titles that definitely merit the word \"classic\", bountiful budget package! Beach Head is set during the Pacific War frantic firing and footy action and even a trip into the and played over six levels, the aim of the game is to invade an dungeons... enemy island in order to knock out a major command post. Beach Head Il follows on a few years from the original. The task is now to battle through four combat sequences in order to rescue prisoners-ofwar. Raid puts you in the cockpit of a superfighter out to knock out the USSR's nuclear weapons currently screaming towards the US. All three titles are showing their age in terms of graphic finesse, but in terms of playability all three are as refreshing and entertaining as they were when first released and well worth the fiver asking price. Both nostalgia buffs and blasting freaks would do well to grab this at once. OVERALL 91% HAWKEYE KIXX .99 Set over twelve levels, this Thalamus re-release pits a lone cyborg warrior against hordes of malevolent invaders, all intent on destruction on a mass scale. Featuring some really great graphics and sound. Hawkeye is a decent enough blast but really tough and therefore not recommended to beginners. Experienced blastaholics should glean some entertainment here. OVERALL 85% ...NEWS FLASH... GARY LINEKER'S HOT-SHOT KIXX .99 The end of the footy season has been and gone, but still soccer games crop up left, right and centre. Hot-Shot isn't at all bad, as it happens, and features the sort of things you'd expect corners, free kicks, throw-ins, deflections, headers and the like and for the magic price it's pretty good VFM as well. If you're like Alan Sugar (and fancy owning Mr Lineker), try the next best thing and take a look. OVERALL 84% 1681000 AL GALDREGONS DOMAIN PLAYERS .99 Similar in style to Dungeon Master, this poor effort at taking that crown is audio-visually okay, but is so slow and boring that even the most ardent of role-players will give up at the first hurdle. Any C64 owner wanting a bit of RPG action would do better to look at Mirrorsoft's Bloodwych in stead it's a heck of a lot more entertaining OVERALL 64% Coming soon the C64 conversion of Sega's Bonanza Bros coin-op! Although the Megadrive version reviewed last issue was a tad lacking, here's hoping that this version (courtesy of megasoftco US Gold) is just as much of a hoot as the coin-op... ...Also from USG is the C64 version of the Capcom coin-op MERCS. Everything looks rather nice at the moment, but how this stands up to the cracking Amiga blast is yet to be seen... ...Fancy building your own world? Well, if you've browsed through the ST Bytesize, you'll no doubt have come across the 3D Construction Kit, which allows you to do that very thing. C64 owners are by no means left out, as this system will be appearing soon on your machine for the grand total of twenty-five notes... 087 "


"G GAME BOY More hand-held hilarity this month, as RESCUE OF PRINCESS Rob Swan takes a look at the latest bundle of Game Boy releases, including an imBLOBETTE port coin-op conversion, the sequel to A Boy and His ABSOLUTE .99 Blob and a conversion of an old Hewson wonder... A Boy and his Blob on the NES featured the adventures of a human boy and a small blob which changed shape when fed jellybeans (!). This Game Boy sequel again features the two mismatched heroes, and is as full of puzzles as the original, as well as being addictive SNOW BROS JR and fun to boot. If you're bored of the same old thing, have a gander, NAXAT but be prepared to spend a long time playing! .99 A conversion of the entertaining Toaplan coin-op. Snow Bros Jr puts OVERALL 91% you in the (snow?)shoes of a snowman whose task in life is to do battle with numerous nasties over 40 platform-strewn levels. Although the coin-op's two player mode is missing, this is still a good laugh, and although not yet officially available, well worth grabbing hold of. Pick it up, and have a (snow)ball. OVERALL 90% THANKS Thanks to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the review cartridges. ...NEWS CASTELIAN TRIFFIX .99 Hands up who remembers Hewson's classic Nebulus? Well, now this tower-toppling trip's available on the Game Boy, and dashed good it is, too. Your task sounds easy enough simply make it to the top of each tower before the timer runs out. but numerous nefarious nasties lurk in your way, eager to put you out of their misery! Overall, a enjoyable slice of gaming history, and well worth checking out. OVERALL 88% FLASH Health NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION KOEI .99 A bit of an odd fish, this set in feudal Japan, you must defeat other warlords in order to seize control of the country. In order to achieve this, however, you have to manage not only the people, but lay down all manner of policies in order to gain allies, harvest crops, and build your troops for war. All together, a bit of a brain-strainer, and definite. ly one for the strategists amongst you. Definitely worth a look. OVERALL 86% ...Coming soon to a Game Boy near you a conversion of that old Data East classic, Burger Time Deluxe. Taking control of a manic burger chef, you've got to build the burgers whilst avoiding the clutches of food fiends Mr Egg, Mr Pickle, and Mr Wiener (that's a sausage to you lot). It all looks like a lorra laffs, but how the finished product plays remains to be seen... ...Check this out for a list of releases to hit the Game Boy within the near future (deep breath): RoboCop II, Star Trek, Mr Do! Super Hunchback, Ninja Gaiden, Asteroids, Missile Command, Paperboy II. Gauntlet II. and Marble Madness. Phew! Jaz has already played Mr Do!

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY ACTIVISION nly a very strange being from another galaxy could Tail to have witnessed R ype the coin-op which effectively changed the lace of shoot 'em ups Here began all those wonderful things we take for granted today: the horizontal scroll power-up weapons and thal scourge of the modern blast the end-oflevel guardian. For its time it was astounding Normally placid gamers would drool uncon trollably at the mere sight of the machine. And when it came playing the game, this top blast simply could not be rivalled in worms of graphics, sonics, plavability and addictiveness. You name R-Type had it all. Arcadeslers screamed for more, and they got il from every single coin-op company which jumped on the back of R-Type's suc cess story and produced a never-ending series of clones, deriva downright copies. Only a few of them matched the originai's quality None bettered it. Then came the arcade release of the imaginatively titled B-Type 11. The plot was no different pilot the trusty 5.9 against the full force of the evil Bydo Empire, spanning six levels of progressively more difficult shoot 'em up action collecting new more devastating weaponry along the way. The sequel matched the quality of its daddy and all the addictive qualities of the first machine had made the leap over to the follow-up. R-Type I was a success. So how would Activision's computer conversions measure up? demam Hmmm Blast your way through the jelly beans of death! WHAT DO PODS MAKE? PRIZES! If you wanna get ahead, get some power-ups for Brucie Bonus blasting! At first you'll wonder why there are so many different types of add-on weapon but later levels will reveal their individual importance. NOSE CONE: The pod you'll find most useful over any other. It can't be destroyed and can trash most enemies just by smashing into them. If that's not enough, it can be bolted to the front or back of the R-9! LASERS: Collect this pod and watch with glee as those little blue beams literally tear any oncoming invaders apart. MISSILES: Not for you those point 'n' fire things that the rest of the cosmos has to put up with. These babies home in on the nearest baddy and put them out of commission. DEFENCE PODS: A boon in general ship defence. These spherical gizmos hover above and below your craft, giving much-needed protection to the most vulnerable parts of your frame BOMBS: These are a new item which didn't make an appearance in the first R-Type game, but they really make a difference when they're added to your arsenal ARC OF DEATH: An elliptical laser charge which spells hard luck for anything caught in its wake. PHOTON TORPEDOS: Don't worry if there's an enemy in a hard-to-reach part of the screen just let fly with this piece of kit and it'll travel along the ground, right toward that alien troublemaker! 090 "


"REVIEW 5252 Yike! Homing rockets! Watch out for the swirling missiles from this level. POWER PLAY... Remember in the first game, where you were given mega laser power the longer you held down the fire button? Well, that's still included in R. Type II, but now there's even more! Hold the button down even longer, until the beam bar turns completely orange, and an awesome, three-way photon charge will be unleashed, ripping the shell from anything in its path! Awesome, eh? FIGHTING ON THE LEVELS... R-Type Il features six levels of blasting action. Here's a quick rundown on the worlds to conquer... AUTO UT-TIMET First we had R-Type, the most infiuential shoot 'em up ever. It must have been almost every other blaster since has copied it in some form or other. Now we're treated to the official followup, which we raved about in its coin-op incarnation a year and a half ago. Is the conversion any good? Well, as you can see from the screenshots, the Amiga has reproduced the graphics almost to a tee, from the imaginative sprites to the finely detailed backdrops. The synthesised sound effects generally fail to impress, as does the music which begins to grate after a short while. R-Type Il is also very sluggish, both in the speed of the horizontal scroll and the relative unreponsiveness of the controls. Things get better once a couple of speed-ups have been collected, but collide with an enemy or be destroyed by a bullet and it's back to fighting with the joystick to get the R-9 to move an inch.. This may sound as if I wasn't impressed not true. R-Type Il is a challenging shoot 'em up with a variety of aliens and well-balanced difficulty setting. As it stands the game is very good, but not the conversion it could have been. PAUL TAL LEVEL ONE: Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the R-9. Its mission to blast hell out of the minions of the Bydo Empire. Bydo drones even appear from underwater! RAND "


"REVIEW R-TYPE II R TYPE II LEVEL TWO: This time round your spacecraft doubles as a handy submarine. So swoop underwater and take out those devillish drones. An underwater boss! LEVEL THREE: Swooping over the planet surface, watch out for the Tadpoles of Doom launched en mass from the battlecruisers! This giant ship IS level three! LEVEL FOUR: Into the fortress, and into a whole heap of trouble. The Bydo Empire are on full alert and don't want to be caught out this time. LEVEL FIVE: The defences are all but breached, yet there's still a bit further to go until you reach the nerve centre of the Bydo Empire R-Type and its sequel rank among the greatest silverguzzling coin-ops of all time, which makes this one of the strongest licenses of the lot. Whilst this is a competent enough conversion and a very good game in its own right, it just doesn't quite retain the feel and atmosphere of its arcade daddy. The graphics and sound are a fine reconstruction of the original masterpiece, but let's face facts: the gameplay is a tad slow. This problem improves once you collect a couple of speedups, but even then it just doesn't flow in the way we've come to expect. On any original sideways scrolling blaster this would not really be a problem, but with R-Type Il you need that extra zip so brilliantly delivered by the original game. This could have been a cracking conversion and earned its rightful place in the home computer hall of fame, but it falls slightly short of the mark and now ranks among the also-rans of its, err, type. Sorry fans, but the wait for that elusive all-time R-Type classic clone goes on... TIM BOONE LEVEL SIX: The heart of the Empire. Abandon hope all ye who enter unless, of course, you're hard enough to defeat the Bydo Empire one more time Beat this guy and you've won!

"REVIEW 2525 MEGADRIVE .00 BY TAITO K guys, listen up. We're talking serious trouble here, so get U that bubble gum out of your mouths and pay attention. The enemy are all over the skies and we ve lost everything unless some of our brave boys can send those bogies down in flames and kick their butts back to wherever the hell they came from! Lucky for us we're Americans and we're flying Mustangs SO there ain't much can touch us when it comes to sheer blasting power. Saddle up and take out these painful planes. Who knows, there may even be a few medals to throw around afterwards. By the way: watch out for those big mothers at the end of each level. These babies are big-time and you'll need some serious courage to shoot 'em from the skies before you can call mom and tell her you're a hero... J717KNOW YOUR ENEMY! Neeaaooww! Ratatatatat! Boom! Sound familiar? It is! Fire Mus tang is a bog-standard horizontal shoot 'em up across the skies in a wide variety of pseudo-wartime battlefields. Looking somewhat similar to P47 Thunderbolt, your job is to shoot down as many of the enemy as posible before squaring up to the end-oflevel superplane in a do-or-die dual to the death. During the game you'll get to take on all manner of German and Japanese planes through the clouds across the world. Enemy fighters range from whiffy little Messerschmidts and Zero fight ers through to flippin' huge bombers requiring some hefty bomb bay blarney to blow them from the airl Also, keep your eyes open for the little helicopter which spins across the sky fairly harmlessly until you blow it to bits. Yes, we know they weren't invented then! It's amazing the variation in quality to be found amongst Megadrive software in one month. We've got possibly the finest game available for the machine in Sonic The Hedgehog and, with Fire Mustang, the worst game you could imagine. It's a shoot 'em up so breathtakingly average, were it a person people would forget to invite to parties. The graphics really are bad-on level two, for instance, these green things can be seen jutting out of the ocean and what they're meant to be God only knows. Couple the indistinct backdrops with flat, uninspiring, flickering sprites and you're left with a weak shell of a game. Gameplay is about as simple as holding down the fire buttons and moving up and down, as enemy fire moves so slowly one could go away and make a cup of tea before coming back and dodging the bullet. Got the message yet? Let me spell it out steer clear. PAUL SA 096 RAND "


"IREVIEW PS XK549 GUNNING FOR GLORY... Taking on the German and Japanese air forces single-handed is a bit of a tall order, even for the best fighter jockey the Americans can muster! Outnumbered a squillion to one, chances are you're going to end up as bits of history unless you've got that firepower edge over your adversaries. Luckily your Mustang is equipped with a fairly nifty machine gun, which can be boosted by pick-ups along the way. These also provide bombs and speedups to make your plane that little bit better. In addition, you have a super smart bomb which wrecks everything in its path at the push of a button! Crikey, is that one helluva secret weapon or what? A historic flyby as the remainder of Iraq's nuclear arsenal explodes beneath the Mustang. 320 Either he's been blasted, or he's been eating baked beans and soap powder! Two down and five to go as our miniscule metal marvel takes on the big 'uns. The programmer explodes as he realises he's included hitech Cruise missiles in a WW2 game. This has got to be one of the worst games to bung up a Megadrive in the short history of the machine! Manufacters Taito seem to be giving this cart quite a push in Japan, but why they bothered to bring it out in the first place I just don't know. There's nothing here we haven't seen a hundred times before, done a hundred times better. With so-so graphics (apart from the static World War Il shots, which are quite good) abysmal sound and gameplay so mind-numbingly awful that tiddlywinks without counters is probably more fun, I'd recommend you shoot this piece of drivel down the second you clap eyes on the flashy cover and award yourself a medal for saving some hard-earned dosh. Fire Mustang is crap to the max, so wipe that silly grin off your face and completely forget about this game NOW! TIM BOONE MEGADRIVE GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 28 LASTABILITY OVERALL 35 "

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY KRYSALIS MANCH, It took English football just one season to go from Europe's reviled to revered, thanks to Manchester United's astounding Cup Win ners Cup victory against Spanish giants Barcelona earlier this year. Alex Ferguson's men took on the might of some of the best sides in the world (and even little Wrexham!) to take the title at the first attempt after five years in the international wilderness following the Heysel Stadium disaster. This game, the sequel to the 100.000 plus selling (and 95% CVG HITI rated) Manchester United, is a cel ebration of the club's achievements The object of the game, as you'd expect, is to take the Reds to the top in the five available competitions UEFA Cup. European Cup. Cup Winners' Cup. Super Cup or World Club Championship, All of the teams which qualified for the respective competitions are featured and there are league and friendly games to play when there is no cup fixture planned. Most of the cup games are played over two legs, the winner being the team with the higher aggregate, score UNIT Player Overview Mark Hughes A A fine save from the lad, eh Greavesy? When Krysalis said they were going to produce a sequel to Manchester United containing some of the best bits not featured in the original, they weren't kidding! Manchester Utd Europe is here, and it's a very good simulation of football. The first thing that strikes is the quality of the graphics all the players have the appropri ate numbers on their backs a great touch and the amount of different moves they can achieve is, as a famous sporting quizmaster might say, quite remarkable. Not only can the players run about and kick the ball, they can chest it down, head it, launch frightening volleys in fact, almost everything a real footy player can do! The aftertouch works well, allowing for goals-a-plenty if you know how to use it to best effect. There are a couple of gripes with Manchester Utd Europe, mind you. For one, wish Krysalis had taken a leaf out of Kick Off's book and Introduced a free-rolling ball instead of a stick-to-yer-foot special it would have made for a far more realistic game. Still, we can't have everything and as it stands Manchester Utd Europe is an enjoyable version of the game we love so much. PAUL RAND A(FTER) TOUCH OF CLASS One of the features of Manchester Utd Europe should be familiar to fans of Kick Off 2 the facility to use aftertouch. For those not aware of what aftertouch is (where have you been?!), it's a method of moving the joystick directly after kicking the ball in order to either keep it low or send it soaring. It's also to apply curl to the ball and send it arcing into the back of the net, just as the professionals do it on a Saturday afternoon. Aftertouch helped make Kick Off 2 the game it is and it works to reasonable effect in Manchester United Europe, too. "


"REVIEW STER TED WE'RE ALL OFF WITH FERGIE'S ARMY... The road to Cup Final glory was a rocky one for Manchester United FC, culminating in an entertaining battle against Spanish titans Barcelona in Rotterdam. Here's a rundown of what Fergie's fellas did to get get there. PORE SLUBLI Against PECSI MUNKAS 1st Leg (away) 2-0 2nd Leg (home) 1-0 Aggregate Score 3-0 Against WREXHAM 1st Leg (home) 3-0 2nd Leg (away) 2-0 Aggregate Score 5-0 BRIN IDELHIR A 3-1 to Man U and Brian McClair laps up the applause! QUARTER-FINAL against MONTPELIER 1st Leg (home) 1-1 2nd Leg (away) 2-0 Aggregate Score 3-1 ropean Cup Manchester United SEMI-FINAL against LIEGE WARSAW 1st Leg (away) 3-1 2nd Leg (home) 1-1 Aggregate Score 4-2 Shamrock Rovers Rep.Ireland FINAL against BARCELONA Final Score -2-1 First off, let me confess that I'm not a huge football fan although Kick Off 2 had yours truly glued to the screen until my eyes went out of focus and the joystick all but fell apart. People are bound to try and compare the two, but somehow I really don't think that's fair. Manchester United il is a fine game in its own right the sheer amount of moves available to the player adds a great deal to the game and the programmers have obviously put a lot of thought into capturing the atmosphere of the big match. For those of us spoiled by the dribbling brilliance of Kick Off, self-adhesive balls which stick to boots can be a bit of a pain but for all that there's plenty of challenge here. These days footy games have to be of the highest quality, and Man Utd Il certainly scores well here. I think many people will see this as a complement to Kick Off-one to load up and enjoy when you're looking for a different angle or want to live those dreams with the Saturday superstars. As such it's well worth a serious look and Krysalis can boast a job well done.

"REVIEW AMICA BY ACTIVISION .99 you. Deports are coming in over the airwaves a town in the deep South is no longer communicating with the outside world. All that was heard before the lines went dead were terrible screams, then a cry of \"God help us!\". A helicopter fly-by reveals a terrifying reality the inhabitants of the town have been transformed into blood-lusting zombies! Not only that, but the birds have become man-eaters and even the normally placid fish have turned into razor-fanged pirhanas! Not a very nice predicament to find yourself in, is it? But that's how it is, and it's up to you (and a friend, if he so wishes) to quite literally stop the rot. There's only one course of action to embark upondiscover what has caused this horrific state of affairs and, if possible, find a way to revert these hideous creatures back to their previous forms. But you're no scientist, and anyway, the zombies have smashed up all the labs, so grab an Uzi and inject some lead MYSTERY ZONE into the poor, unfortunate citizens before they inject their teeth into As soon as you enter the subway system those critters GRAB YOUR KIT AND KICK begin their attack.

The game has now been stuffed into the Amiga, and to tell the truth there isn't much of a difference between this conversion and the original arcade machine. The stomach-churning graphics are all there even the scenes where the enemies explode into chunks of bloodied flesh when they're disposed of. All the original collectables have been retained, from mortars to grenades, extra ammo to first aid kits, and even though the gameplay is the same old Op Wolf/Thunderbolt scroll 'n shoot type, the screen scrolls at a fair old pace and those baddies pour onto the screen to come face-to-face with a barrel full of bullets! So, if you like your Amiga blasting entrails an' all, you'd be hard pushed to find anything quite like Beast Busters just be sure to have a bucket or paper bag by your side when you play!

OBAFSHARE. ANESTHESE THE The Amiga has never really been well off for good Operation Wolf style games, and even Op Thunderbolt wasn't that good. Luckily, Beastbusters is a vast improvement on what's gone before, not just because it actually has the smooth 3D scrolling which wasn't in Op Wolf, but it is actually a much more entertaining game. I mean, let's face it, would you rather shoot soldiers or splatter the innards of a thousand festering zombies all over the walls of a subway? There's quite some variety between the levels so the action doesn't grow too stale, and if you're playing with a friend you really do get double the fun.

"RAZAK Kdmenogors 45064 Hatgal aangor REVIEW NOUT PC .99 BY DYNAMIX unze Ry anze KIR nurse Der Take \"Lucky\" Masters hasn't been living up to his nickname of late. It's 1928 and his charter airline business operating out of Hong Kong is on the rocks. He also owes a lot of money to Eugene Lomax, one of Hong Kong's most powerful businessmen, and not the kind of fellah you want to get on the wrong side of. uma x But things aren't going too well for Lomax either. His daughter, a nurse working in rural China, has recently been kidnapped. Reckon. ing that he owes him a favour, Lomax wants Lucky to rescue her, and to help persuade him Lomax has had Lucky's houseboat on blown up! Not surprisingly, Lucky has accepted the job. Lucky starts this adventure game on the docks at Hong Kong. looking at the remains of his home. From there, he has to catch a rickshaw into town to recruit a ninja, Zhao Chi, who will prove invaluable on the quest. After persuading Zhao Chi that aeroplanes really can fly, you can take off to Chengdu. From there the quest leads to Katmandu then to Istanbul and after a trip on The Orient Express, the culmination of the adventure takes place in Paris. A Check out that scenery! CONTROL YQURSELF! Adventure games which require you to use the keyboard are history. As in a lot ofrecent adventures, the commands in Heart of China are issued via icons and a pointer, which is either mouse or joystick controlled. Place the pointer over anything of interest and click on the right button to examine it, or the left button to collect it (if it is indeed collectable). When the pointer hits a person, it turns into a speech bubble, and if you want to enter into conversation you're presented with a selection of things to say. Lucky likes to talk tough, but unless you're after a fight, try to be nice to people. After all, you never know when you might need someone's help, and all the characters in the game have a good memory... HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS Running Heart of China requires a fast PC (286 or over) with a LVGA card, 640k of memory, a hard drive and a high density floppy disk drive. So there. JELE! 16 On the streets again. Tough life, eh? There's no doubting that adventures have come a long way over the past year or so, what with easy-to-use command systems and incredible graphics, but I think maybe Heart of China is a step too far! The graphics and the sound create an excellent atmosphere, as does all the character interaction, and the controls are well-thought out. The designers have made an extreme effort to make the game feel like a film, and it does the only problem is, it's not a particularly good film. The problem lies in the fact that the game really goes overboard with it's conversation routines, and in the end there's just a bit too much talk and not quite enough action. That's not to say it ruins things, because the frills still make the game impressive. But if it came to a choice between this and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I'd go for the man with the hat every time. PAUL GLANCEY Jaba 1127 "


"Kyakhto You 30 uchye Biro s urger Alcomulag Alcormatang Hentiyn Nuriu DIREVIEW ngy 9292 What, fly in that crate? Oh, alright then. Art an Take that! Lucky brewis & with the best ostok Tot 'em. and who canni. No blame him negi 1974 Santhongjin 20 US P MAKING MOVIES One of the first things to strike the player about Heart of China is its unusual graphical style. Many of the backgrounds are hand-drawn, but the people in the game are actually digitised pictures of actors. More than 85 people were cast as the characters, and all of them were kitted out with the correct pe od costumes, and they were even made up for the camera. The photographs were then turned into computer images using three colour scanners and appear on the PC screen in either 16 or 256 colours via a VGA card. GN De At first glance, Heart Of China looks incredible. Look closer and you'll find amazing graphics and an interactive computer movie polished until it shines. Search deeper still and there's not much left to find, because however groundbreaking Heart Of China is, it's not a particularly good game. Basically the interaction boils down to three choices in most situations, with progress or lack of it depending on your response. The upshot is that the player has to sit through lengthy conversations, most of which is entirely superfluous (although quite amusing), twiddling thumbs and gazing at the graphics whilst waiting for the next decision. Don't be get me wrong, Heart Of China is a stunning, bold product with graphics occasionally unsurpassed. Trouble is it's Basak just not enough, and for your money you want something 18 a bit more than a graphical tour-de-force which doesn't have enough at its heart to merit repeated play and turn it into a classic.

"BATTLETECH BATTLEMECH GENTER "


"BATTLETECH et in the battlefields of the 31st century, Battletech puts you in control of a BattleMech: a 12-metre high, heavily armoured robot of war fitted with the most awesome weapons of destruction ever devised. It's a supremely powerful machine and can only be stopped by one thing another Mechl And this is what this incredible new arcade experience is all about... The Battletech Centre in Chicago is the first in what's hoped will be a series of worldwide centres where players can visit and play Battletech. A very impressive place, it looks like an arcade of the fu. ture with rows and rows of Battletech pods into which the players climb to pilot their giant robots. Games are usually played with six or so players at a time, either with two teams of three Mechs, or in a free-for-all scenario like those in which I played. Here's the experience... TOR COUNTDOWN TO COMBAT Before combat begins, you're briefed on the controls and the way the Mech works. As you can see from the diagram, an explanation is certainly needed the controls take a bit of getting used to Once you've been through the training drill, it's time to assign yourself a codename (JAZ for me, of course), choose a Mech from the variety of models available and climb into the cockpit to engage in Mech war! The cockpits are very comfortable, and once you've slid the door shut (completely cutting you off from the outside world) you really feel like you're sitting in the heart of a Mech, cocooned by a massive bank of lights and dials. You've even got a pull-down-microphone so you can talk to other players! KEEPING CONTROL The controls are pretty intimidating at first, but not all of them are needed to play at the basic level. As you get better you can switch on all sorts of extra stuff like infra-red scanning, independent turret rotation and realign the weapons to work in a specific order. The control panel is dominated by a large TV monitor, where all the action takes place. Players are given a first-person perspec. tive few out of the eyes of their Mech, so it your machine stands in front of another you see that Mech and the player who's pilotting the Mech opposite will see you! The 3D graphics are truly outstanding and utterly convincing. The Mechs are beautifully animated, and the backgrounds and sky realistically fade towards the horizon. Weather conditions are changeable and you can play at night, in a desert, on fields, in fog, rain, snow, the combinations are enormous. "


"BATTLETECH CAN YOU TAKE THE HEAT? Myself and five others played a series of ten minute games set in the desert, with a heat haze giving only 1000 meters visibility. Consequently Mechs could sneak up quite close to you before you made visual contact. That meant that you had to constantly keep one eye on the radar below the main screen to make sure no-one was approaching with missiles and lasers ready to blow you apart. After chatting with the Battletech operator about the different Mech series available, I decided to choose a Loki V3. It's as slow as a coach, but it's got the best armour and carries the most powerful weapons. Others in my group chose MadCats (more speed, but weaker armament), and Hitman (a \"professional\" player of more than 600 games experience who was brought in to show us how to play) selected a Vulture Prime which he said was the weakest Mech, \"just to give us a chance\". The Mech movement and weapon targetting systems operate independently, and concentrating on tracking down other Mechs, aiming your weapons and hitting them is quite tricky at first especially when they're trying to do the same to you. DE-BRIEFING After each battle, each Mech Warrior is given a printout of his performance. The sheet lists the all the players' scores, and also gives blow-by-blow highlights of the contest. As you can see from Jazza's de-briefing from his third match, there's a war going on out there. THE VERDICT Battletech is definitely the most exciting interactive videogame system yet devised. The realistic graphics combined with the ut terly convincing cockpit interior results in an awesome experience that keeps you buzzing hours after you've left the Centre In Chicago people are hooked on it, and it's easy to see whyit's simply amazing. If a Battletech Centre does appear in Lon. don you'll definitely see me there as often as possible. And you'd better watch out, because I'll be out to destroy you! TRICKY TACTICS! My tactic was to turn around and run away from the other five, then wait for one to break away from the pack so I could stalk him without being blasted in the melee. It takes six or seven well-aimed hits to destroy a Mech, but the satisfaction you get when you see the pilot blast off in an automatic escape capsule seconds before the Mech explodes is enormous! In one particular one-on-one encounter I managed to blow and arm and leg off a Mech and watched gleefully as it hopped along (they do that!). I finally put it out of its misery by blowing its pelvis apart! In the games I played, pilots whose Mechs were blown up were returned in the same Mech a few miles from the centre of battle. In other scenarios, pilots return in fast mini mechs which although have weak armour and armament, they can prove to be a real thorn in the side of the big Mechs. At professional level. if you die, it's all over. BOTTS Microprose's next arcade machine, following on from their im pressive F-15 Strike Eagle coin-op will be BOTTS, a game based around huge fighting robots. Their filled-vector 3D graphics driver is pushed to its limits as you pilot a giant war robot around a vast arena, taking on other 'bots in an almost gladitorial-style conflict. An early version of the machine I saw at the CES show in Chicago looked very impressive indeed, and I think that it could be a runaway Success! We'll bring you more information closer to the machine's UK launch date. COMING TO LONDON Battletech franchises are up for grabs at the moment, and Battletech head honcho John Weisman hopes to have a London Battletech Centre up and running within a year. We'll tell you more about it when we have more information. JOIN THE LEAGUE The Battletech Centre has several leagues in operation, each filled with teams of three players. Contests are held weekly, and the teams battle fiercely for top honours. There are seminars on tactics, and teams constantly practice manoeuvres together to perfect attack patterns and discover new ways of getting the most out the machinery! "

They're great in close combat, and their backs are well armed to help it escape serious damage if it's jumped from behind. VULTURE A fast Mech that's packed with long-range weaponry. They're not particularly well armed, but they have a batch of short range lasers just in case it finds itself in close quarter combat MADCAT A well balanced, but ageing Mech that features good armament, armour and speed capabilities. It doesn't excel in any areas, but if you're after a solid, versatile allround Mech, you can't go wrong with this. THOR Available in a wide variety of variants, the Thor is almost as well armoured as a Loki and can carry a wide variety of weapons, which can slow it down or speed it up depending on how heavy its armoury is. Because its weapons are so varied, you must approach it with caution you never know quite what it might be carrying! Vulture Prim (Primary Version) Top Speed: 97 Kph MadCat Prim.

"Arcade giant Capcom have lined up a real treat for gamesters with their amazing new triple-thrill cabinet the Three Wonders! The impressive machine, featured at the recent Electrocoin arcade show, includes three great games on one CP system board which means you get to choose which one you playl Midnight Wanderers, Chariot and Don't Pull are the threesome on offer, and pretty darned good they all are... The first two games are interlinked in as much as Midnight Wan derers is the quest for the Chariot you use in the second game, although each of the three can be played independently of the others. Here's the lowdown on each game: INSERT COIN WONDERS BY CAPCOM Three in one triple the fun! That's the thinking behind the Three Wonders and Capcom have come up with a cabinet which is a bit special. With most playchoice systems the games on offer can tend to be somewhat substandard, but with Three Wonders that's not the case at all. Each game could quite happily stand in its own cabinet, and put together there's something here to appeal to just about every gamesplayer around. Chariot has to be my favourite featuring big, colourful and bold sprites and some heavy-duty shoot 'em up action. Midnight Wanderers didn't appeal at first, but it's weird atmosphere soon tempts you back. Don't Pull is a puzzle game to rank alongside some of the best of the genre, taxing your brain while the trigger finger takes a break, Check out Three Wonders as soon as you get the chance you'll wonder how they managed to squeeze so much into one big box! This is going to be huge... TIM PUSH 'N' PULL PUZZLING! Don't Pull is a puzzling fantasy game set in the wonderful world of Don and Pull two cute characters whose mission in life is to push and pull blocks around and knock six bells out of the bad guys. Mini biceps bulging, our heroes race around the screen avoiding their enemies and trying to squash the baddies into so much marmalade by shoving hefty blocks at them. The troublesome twosome can also try to collect fruit for extra credits while three hearts in a row gives a special bonus. Easy to pick up and hugely addictive, this one will guzzle up your loose change in a jiffy! BOONE "

Of course, everyone wants to live in a Utopia, but life being what it is and people being what they are, it's practically impossible to create one. Or is it? Like SimCity and Populous, this game from Gremlin lets you run your own colony, only this time the colony is on a distant planet which is also populated by ten other alien species. The aim of the game is to keep the colony running for as long as possible, and get the colonists' Quality of Life to above 90%. Once you've constructed living quarters for your brave space pioneers, you'll need food stores, a power station and some solar energy panels, and some space moss converter plants which provide the colony's air supply. To provide an extra boost to the Quality of Life-ometer, you can construct a hospital or a sports complex. As well as levying taxes on the colonists, you can finance your operation with ore mining, but beware of envious aliens They will happily mount attacks on your installations if they aren't adequately defended, so you need to invest some of that ore revenue in weapons research and tank construction. We've seen a demo of Utopia and programmer Graham Ing (one of the men behind Gremlin's BSS Jane Seymour) has done an extremely good job in fact there were mumblings in the CVG games room which went \"blah, blah... Mmm, very nice indeed... blah, blah... Mmm, next SimCity... blah, blah.\" In fact, word has it that a lot of console programmers were showing a great deal of interest in the game at the Chicago CES Show. so it may eventually appear on Megadrive and Super NES. We'll keep you posted. TEOSER TURRET 55LEILDUNENE PLASMO GUME BATTLE STATIONS! Any colony with sufficient technical skills can construct weapons and mobile defence units to keep invaders at bay. Small laser turrets can be sited around the outskirts of the colony, and really cautious commanders can create a perimeter of minefields to defend against any enemy ground attacks. If you'd prefer to attack your neighbours first, you can send out units of tanks to attack any enemy forces in a particular area. The same can be achieved with spacecraft of which there are five increasingly powerful types. Not surprisingly, the best wea. pons require the most skilled technicians to build them, and the best raw materials.

OutRun Europa is US Gold's own instal1 ment in the OutRun saga which was originally planned for release back in 1989.

Now it's back, and due for release on all formats, including Sega Master System, this September You play a British secret agent who has been given some top secret plans to deliver to an unknown destination in Europe.

All the time, enemy agents and foreign police forces are trying to run you off the road so getting to the end stage is all down to your skill at driving and dodging. Probe software are programming all versions of the game. As well as producing the 8-bit conversions of Special Criminal Investigations, Probe were also responsible for the successful home versions of Turbo Outrun, so their mastery of the driving Simulation is already proven.
