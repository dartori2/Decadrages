"3DO FEATURE THE FUTURE NOW! THE SECRET OF THE BLACK MAGIC BOX At last, the wait is over. The 3DO Multiplayer is with us. On import, at least; Panasonic launched its system in the States at the end of October, with the UK version scheduled to appear in the early part of 1994. Much has been written already about the machine regarded, by most of the videogaming industry at least, to be the next step in home entertainment. CVG got its hands on one of the first machines available, to take the lid off this 32-bit monster if you REALLY want to know all there is about Trip Hawkins' big baby, you've come to the right place. TECHIE TALK hen Electr onic Arts boss Trip Hawkins left the massive software company in 1990 to go it alone and set up his own firm, many in the industry believed him to be, frankly, barmy. When it was announced shortly after that his firm, The 3DO Company, was working on a new games machine, that barmy rating went up by a factor of 10; after all, the market was already saturated by Sega and Nintendo. Then came the news that this new system would be a 32-bit RISC, CDbased 'home entertainment system! and he began to be taken more seriously. Previously, the only firm to have dabbled in RISC technology for the home had been Acorn with its ultra-powerful but poorly marketed Archimedes computer. Surely, with EA's games market experience behind him, Hawkins would know what he was doing? The big boys in the electronics marketplace seemed to think so; Japanese giants Sony and Matsushita, as well as AT&T, the American equivalent of British Telecom, all invested big bucks in the project. It's taken three years since initial announcement for the machine All you technologically-minded types, get ready to slobber uncontrollably as here, for your viewing pleasure, is the tech spec for the Panasonic 3DO Real Interactive Multiplayer. Remember that, 100E because The 3DO Company has licensed out its technology to a variety of different hardware firms, there may well be differences between the specifications; but the basic spec should be the same throughout the different formats, allowing for complete compatibility. . The future of videogaming? 3DO certainly has all the right qualifications to be the next big thing. CENTRAL PROCESSOR: 32-bit ARM 60 RISC OTHER PROCESSORS: DSP, two graphics processors ANIMATION SPEED: Up to 64 Million Pixels Per Second CLOCK SPEED: 12.5MHZ SCREEN RESOLUTION: 640x480 pixels COLOUR: 24-bit. 16.7 Million colour palette SOUND: Eight channel, stereo 16-bit CD quality OUTPUT PORTS: TV Aerial, S-Video, Composite 12 "

WHEN YOU'VE BEEN THERE, SEEN IT AND DONE IT... to finally appear, into a market that is becoming increasingly aware of the explosion in new technology, especially the CD multimedia aspect. And with systems such as Philips' CD-i and omodore's CD32 the latter boasting similar processing poweralready on the market in this country, it's going to be very interesting to see whether the financial muscle which 3DO has behind it will be enough in this battle of the giants. \"It's wonderful. We'll be supporting 3DO wholeheartedly.\" James Morris, PR Manager, Mindscape (Dragon Tales, Mega Race) BEAUTY OR A BEAST? Anyone expecting a sleek-looking addition to your existing home entertainment set-up, forget it. The Panasonic 3DO Real Multiplayer, to give the system its full title, looks more at home sat next to your TV with a cup of coffee and a sandwich sat on top of it, as opposed to nestling underneath your set with all manner of amazing effects blasting out of its 32 bits. As if the RISC chip itself wasn't enough, 3DO incorporates an array of custom chips, mainly to handle the manipulation of graphics, which gives the system the ability to shift on-screen images, as well as the behind-the-scenes donkey-work, at an incredible rate. Sound is, obviously, of 16-bit CD quality why have the features and not use them? And shove all of that together with a compact disc drive that can access six Megabytes of data per second, and you've got a piece of hardware that is, frankly, not shabby. And if you WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE? TRY As 3DO is a multimedia machine, expect to see a variety of add-ons appearing over the coming months. New controllers are almost definite, as the one you receive with the machine is a bit on the clunky side, but what about peripherals for other applications? A keyboard has been mentioned, as has a modem allowing you to connect to other machines via the telephone system. Indeed, with AT&T heavily involved in 3DO, it's a distinct possibility that this system could be the one to introduce an ideal that has been touted for years home shopping. Users could link up to a central computer via their phone and see on-screen exactly what they want to buy, then key in an order and have it deducted from their account. There's also a Midi attachment in the pipeline, which will let you link your 3DO with synthesisers, electronic drumkits and the like to create and store music with the CD sound quality of the Multiplayer, you could become the next Take That in the comfort of your living room!

Photo-realistic scrolling backdrops make this one stand out. Don't think that the 3DO Company is on the Yellow Brick Road, though, because it does have some competition out there, the biggest coming from Philips with CD-i. Although not technically as powerful as 3DO (CD-i relies on 16-bit technology similar to that used in 486 PCs), CD-i has the advantage of having a large number of software titles available, is the first on the market with FMV/Digital Video and, of course, was the company which invented compact disc in the first place. it AMIGA CD Then there's the charge of the Commodore brigade with their CD32. It's got the 32-bit muscle (in fact, it was the first 32-bit console on the market), it's got the software support (although, admittedly, the majority of titles are more-or-less straight conversions from the Amiga but hey, at least there are games available) and it costs less than . Both Commodore and Philips are spending a lot of money on advertising over Christmas which should stand them in good stead in this country, but neither machine has as much public awareness in America that 3DO has it should be quite an interesting tussle come the Spring.

SNES' 1 million pixels per second animation speed compared to 3DO's 64 million. We are talking the next step here. But there's another use. The latest buzzword in the industry is MPEG, which stands for Motion Pictures Expert Group. And while that may mean little to you at the moment, bear it in mind because it's the recognised standard for the latest in viewing entertainment CD films. What has happened is that the entertainment industry has sat down and agreed a standard by which all full-screen, full-motion video (FMV material stored on compact disc must abide by, and that standard is MPEG. Hence, every machine which supports MPEG will be able to run the new CD videos and movies which are now starting to appear and should be pouring into stores in droves come the Spring.

"PROS AND CONS OOOH... 3DO is a very powerful piece of hardware. It may not be the first 32-bit CD-based home system around (Commodore can proudly claim that fine accolade) but it has some real heavyweights behind it who have put too much money into the machine to see it fail. A large amount of software is guaranteed around 302 companies have signed up to create various titles for 3DO, with around 100 different packages currently in production. It's more than just a games machine 3DO has been designed not purely with Little Johnny in mind, but for the whole family: mum will be able to buy recipe discs and see exactly how that quiche she always mucks up is done; dad can stretch out on the sofa after a hard day's toil and slip in a CD Video, giving him CD sound and better than Super VHS picture quality. And, with the likes of Electronic Arts, Psygnosis and Virgin all busily producing for 3DO, you'll be able to play bigger and better games than are around at present if you can drag the rest of the family away from the machine, that is! Compared to similar systems available at present, however, 3DO costs an awfully large amount of money it's been launched in America at $699.99, which works out at roughly , but is likely to make the leap over The Pond at a dollar-to-pound pricepoint of . Mind you, that hasn't stopped ship-out stocks of the Multiplayer completely selling out (although you have to bear in mind that, with only 1,500 stores ini tially carrying the system the vast majority of 3DOS will have bee snapped up by the 'buy anything new techie types). There's not the glut of software releases that were expected when 3DO hit the streets either, and the game which comes with the machine Crash 'n' Burn from Crystal Dynamics whilst being graphically impressive, isn't particularly difficult or fun to play, and looks decidedly rushed; the CD drive is accessing data almost continuously, and there's a frightening amount of hold-ups while the machine updates certain screens. As we say, though, this is due to sloppy programming rather than the capabilities of the 3DO. systems will be supporting the MPEG standard, including 3DO, Philips' CDand Commodore's CD32, there should be a huge amount of visual material to choose from and run on any of those machines.

ATARI'S $200 WORLD BEATER CRESCENT GALAXY The first horizontally scrolling shoot'em-up on the Jaguar and already it's got the best looking end-oflevel bosses ever seen outside of the arcades. Graphically this is exceptionally smart and makes full use of the 16.7 million colour palette in the system. All objects are ray-traced with lovely reflections and good use of lighting effects. Atari's 64-Bit Jaguar is the most technically awesome games console ever created. It's a revolution, not an evolution and it has the power to out perform most coin-ops. The system will offer massive games with up to 400 Megabits per cartridge, and get this it's around 849 times faster than a SNES or Mega Drive at animation! The game places you as Corporal Trevor McFur in a deep space reconnaissance mission to save the world. How original. Anyway, there are only nine levels and the action doesn't seem particularly engaging. Still, visually it has that \"wow\" factor. race that Atari Â«has a well planned launch campaign backed with a huge advertising spend and careful management.\" However, we've heard this sort of claim from Atari before. Its Lynx handheld proved that top technology doesn't guarantee success; then again, the Lynx tried to be a mass market games machine, but Atari didn't put a large enough marketing spend behind the machine. This time though, Atari has virtually emptied its bank account to make sure that next year you're going to know what Jaguar's all about! The price point of  is crucial.

The truth is, 700 odd Megabytes of CD game takes ages to develop, and lengthy development costs bucks. That's why action games on the likes of Mega-CD and PC-CD never make use of the full storage of a disc, Jaguar cartridges support an enhanced JPEG image compression sysand if they do it tends to be for tem (JagPEG). This permits 48 Megabits of uncompressed data per something silly like soundtracks. Atari cartridge or 400 Megabits compressed.

"SOUND AAAAH... On the sound side the Jaguar has 12 channel full 16-bit stereo sound, which is as good as you can noticeably get. True-life effects can be sampled and the dynamic range is wide enough to deliver bass with conviction and treble with fizz. There's just no possible reason why any Jaguar game should sound naff, so developers you have been warned! With its processing power, the Jaguar works nicely as a complex multimedia platform. The controller ports can handle digital and analogue interfaces such as keyboards, lightguns and mice. It's equipped with a 32-bit expansion port, ensuring that anything connected runs at top whack. Next year Atari will release a CDROM module, offering the option of superimposing graphics on to full-screen, true colour video. Like most CD-ROM players, this hardware will play audio, Karaoke and Kodak Photo CDs. An MPEG 2 (Motion Picture Expert Group) is also in the pipeline. This will allow users to watch the new CDV format of full-length movies on three-inch CDs. More interestingly, there are plans to launch a Virtual Reality helmet because, quite frankly, the system has the technology to make decent use of one. Don't get too excited though, because even the Jaguar lacks the power required for true virtual reality and the helmet will have to pass US standards first. less than .\" It may seem a bargain to people who understand the technology but for Joe Bloggs it's just a games machine so the low price could be vital. MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second). That's a phenomenal amount of processing punch in itself; but the Jaguar has a custom object processor too, which teams up with the 3D specific hardware necessary for real-time 3D ray-traced graphics.

You can move anything in any direction and in any quantity, As such, slow-down is something you definitely won't experience on a NIS FISH AND CHIPS The machine is named after the chip set inside.

What we've seen so far is smooth, fast and technically very impressive, but the best bit is watching the Cybermorph craft morph into different shapes in real-time depending on what needs to be done, be it attacking or rescuing. Looks good, and we'll be reviewing the finished item next issue. Exclusively of course. Jaguar in handling UPLIM I S GET WITH IT OR THIS... Thankfully, Atari is allowing developers as much freedom as possible to develop their games, and that's vital considering that technology means nothing unless the software can make use of it. Atari has a list of over 20 development houses waiting to start on the Jaguar. Gary Bracey, Development Director for Ocean states: Â«Technologically, the Jaguar appears to be leading the pack at the moment; so we're excited by the prospect of developing for it. The price is right, the technology is right and, with the right profile marketing, the Jaguar will go a long way.\" US GOLD "


"IN THE BOX The Jaguar board has been carefully designed with expansion in mind. A 32-bit slot is the business when it comes to adding the likes of a CD-ROM; it allows faster data transfer. Even so, the slot can accept virtually any kind of device you care to think of. A virtual reality helmet is waiting for US standards approval, while a modem interface will permit Jaguar linkups and even head-to-head duels over the phone line! 000002 Display output from the Jaguar covers all possibilities. You can use a regular RF picture for your TV to ensure compatibility: but you get the best definition if you use Super VHS or RGB (as coin-ops use). Are we good to you or what? The only Jaguar in the country and we've taken it apart. The machine is designed around two custom chips called Tom and Jerry. The total system speed for the Jaguar is benchmarked at a staggering 55 MIPS (Millions of Instruction Per Second). Just bear in mind that this rating reflects the total system speed. Tom and Jerry are actually 27 MIP devices, but take it from us, the Jaguar's architecture permits fluid data handling with no bottle necks in the system. Outstanding! Tom is an unusual chip and consists of four other units: a blitter (for moving large graphics); an object processor (for generating sprites); a memory controller (for handling the two Megabytes of on-board RAM), and a graphics processing unit. Tom is capable of displaying a 720 X 576 resolution display (640 X 480 on the 3DO). Tom can also olution display (640 x 480 on the 3DO). Tom can also animate 850 million pixels per second (64 million for 3DO) in 16.7 million shades of colour. Jerry handles the superior DSP (Digital Signal Processor) for sound. Jerry also uses a 13.3Mhz Motorola 68000 chip (as found in Mega Drives) but just for controller purposes. nition output, with more than twice the resolution of a Mega Drive, using a 16 million colour palette to ensure photo-realistic definition as a standard in Jaguar games. MONEY Jaguar. As Kris Johnson of Statesbased Beyond Games says: \"The 64bit power of the Jaguar allows us to move light years beyond today's game standards.\" Graphically, the Jaguar is capable of the most advanced texture mapping yet. This is a process by which images can be wrapped around 3D polygons to smarten them up a bit. In addition, the hardware is also capa ble of special 3D effects including rotation, image distortion, morphing and pseudo lighting effects. This means that objects interacting on the screen can affect the way in which light bounces off their surfaces just like the effects found in films like The Lawnmower Man and T2. Naturally, all this is presented through a hi-defihere this side of Easter, but TEMPEST 2000 importers are promising to have A conversion of the classic arcade them available by the time you read game in which you rotate around difthis.

Initially, production will be limited with around 100,000 units in the USA before Christmas. You're unlikely to see the Jaguar in any quantity over CHEQUERED FLAG II Looks like Sega's Virtua Racing eh? Well, it plays the same too. You can move in and out of the car just like you can with the coin-op, but the graphics are very samey. The speed of this is incredible and, once again, very smooth. Handling is realistic, but the version we've been playing doesn't have any other cars to race against. Atari assures us that the finished version will be even faster and more detailed than the screenshots here. This is also likely to be the bundled game with the machine. Wild! OK. So it looks and feels a bit cheap but it gives you 17 buttons for gameplay. Plastic slips can fit over the keypad for instructions. The leads do look worryingly short on the pads that we've been using, but Atari assures us that they'll be made longer. * STOP PRESS * PRICE CUT RUMOURED At the time of going to press we received an unconfirmed rumour from a leading 3DO developer that, come the new year, the price of the 3DO will be cut by $400 dollars to $399. If true, we are witnessing the beginnings of a full-blown war for a new games market, involving not only the Jaguar but, here in the UK, Commodore's CD32, priced about the same as a $399 3DO. 18 "

Since Space Invaders and Pacman, games have used sprites, bitmaps, polygons (the Gouraud shaded, texture-mapped and light sourced variety), 16, 32 and 256 colours, digitised video footage and highresolution still pictures. The next advance? Well, what we really need now are crisp, clear TV quality images moving at TV speeds on a computer screen and this is where Sigma Design's ReelMagic PC! video card comes in a card that has the potential to create a revolution in games and entertainment. Tres Bon Jovi We're not exaggerating about the possibility of a games revolution. The ReelMagic card has that elusive 'wow' factor. When people FORRIED ed in comparison.

Since we've had it in the CVG office we've been ringing everybody up, urging them to come and take a look because, despite the fact that all we've been showing is the Bon Jovi \"Blaze of Glory\" video demo that comes with the card, what we have here is Full Motion Video Bon Jovi; literally, TV on your PC. Now, Full Motion Video is a term that's bandied about with computer games all the time, usually meaning little more than low-resolution, poorly digitised American actors filmed against a blue backdrop then lobbed in front of another filmed image. These days TV quality is often taken for granted but remember, even the most advanced graphics are still grainy and pixellatReel Time So what does it do? Well, the ReelMagic is a video (and sound) card that sits alongside your VGA card in the PC. It plays a whole new game format MPEG CD-ROM and a whole new video format VideoCD. It runs these at resolutions up to 1,024x768, at a constant 30 frames per second. And it does all this in 32,768 colours. MPEG compression (MPEG stands for Motion Pictures Experts Group) is the same format used in 3DO and CD-i machines which squashes both video and sound data down by enormous amounts, up to 200:1. This means that the video information then fits within the CD-ROM transfer rate, so the data is played back straight from the CD disc with no loss of speed. It may look suspiciously like a boring old PC card, but believe us when we tell you that this could be a very hot piece of PC kit! 24 "

The first VideoCD films capable of being played on the ReelMagic will come from Paramount Pictures and Warner Brothers, with other film studios following suit next year. The VideoCD standard is backed by a whole host of companies including Sony, JVC, Matsushita, Philips and Samsung, and by this time next year you may well be renting out your Friday night flick on CD-ROM disc from Blockbuster, rather than a crackly old video tape. Activision's Return to Zork, and both DOS and Windows software. Games are expected initially to retail in the - region, with 12 titles available by the time of the launch, and over 50 come the New Year. Better still, ReelMagic doesn't need much in the way of expensive hardware. You'll need a CD-ROM drive of course, but it will work just as fast on a standard 16MHz 386PC as on a super-powered 66MHz 486DX/2. It'll also run its 32 thousand colour displays even if you only have a standard 16-colour VGA card.

The Commitents Right now there are a number of games publishers and developers that have committed themselves to producing MPEG games for the ReelMagic, including high-profile names such as Sierra, Activision, Trilobyte, Readysoft, Virgin, Westwood Studios, Interplay, Psygnosis, Aris and LucasArts.

"WORD UP WITH PAUL his month sees the launch of two of the most important pieces of technology that this industry has seen since the Spectrum. 3DO and Jaguar have hit the streets, one with a roar, the other a whimper. And to be quite honest, it really shouldn't be that way. We've had a 3D0 machine in the CVG office for about a fortnight from the time I write this, and we've all trotted down to Atari's UK headquarters to have a good old look at the Jaguar, and while both are certainly very impressive machines, it's the Jaguar which really got our jaws dropping. It's easy to see why, if you take a look at the tech specs in the 10-page feature running this issue from page 10. And, when you take a look at the respective retail prices of the two systems $700 for 3DO compared to $200 for Jaguar (UK prices not yet confirmed) you'd think it natural for companies to be taking a very keen interest in Atari's 64-bit wonder. COP OUT? Yet all the focus is on the CD-based 3DO, with companies reticent to even give us a quote as to the quality of the Jaguar, let alone whether or not they'll be publishing games for it. Now what I want to know is, why? Fair enough, a lot of firms have been stung in the past by Atari's failure to market its machines, but the company is putting its life and soul into making Jaguar one of THE machines to have in the Nineties; it's streets ahead of the competition in terms of technology. But you'll still hear the softcos whinge 'Yes, but it's Atari, isn't it'. What a cop-out! You'd think that, after years of whining about having to hand over wads of cash to Nintendo and Sega to publish games, they might at least have the foresight to invest a little bit of money in putting together games for a machine that could wipe the floor with either of those systems, without having to turn over large portions of dough to the company who owns the machine. After all, we are talking 400 Meg cartridges here, at a price of around , when the two big console firms are charging at least that for cartridges that are a twentieth of the capacity. BANDWAGON This is an industry that thrives on new technology. It's an industry that has made a lot of people very rich because they jumped on a bandwagon and it kept on rolling. Now those same people want to stay on the bandwagon come what may, shunning potential new avenues to trundle because they don't have the bottle to cough up a few grand out of millions to support the single biggest jump we've ever seen in new-tech. Yes, 3DO is a great machine and deserves to do well but at the expense of everything else? Easy money isn't everything, you know. PAUL RAND 26 "


"MEET THE CVG CREW: COMPO WINNERS PAUL RAND There was a time when you couldn't keep the CVG ed out of the public eye.

Recently though, the Rand has received a massive ego boost in the form of a number of celebrity minglings (Bob Hoskins, Michael Winner AND Jeremy Beadle!) and he even got a name check in top peoples' magazine, Time International! What next? Taking over from Anneka Rice on the new TV show 'Challenge Rand'?, We were absolutely swamped with entries for the CD32 competition. Alas, there can only be three winners and, after wading through the masses of letters and postcards in the sack, our lucky wand came to rest on the following trio: Paul Hart, Shrewsbury, SY2.

GARY LORD Has Gaz ever managed any televisual debuts? \"No, the most I've ever managed was to appear in the audience in various programmes when I was a nipper. My first was in the audience of Crackerjack watching the legendary Don McClean and Peter Glaze, but I never made it as a contestant, so I never got that prized possession a Crackerjack pencil and pen.\" For our younger readers, this prized possession' was the juvenile equivalent of a Blankety Blank cheque book and pen. And Gary wanted one! (Editor's note: Gary is very old, so you probably won't remember Crackerjack. I don't!) We were rather surprised by a phone call from Nintendo's PR company the other week, informing us that we'd got the names of the bosses wrong on the Streetfighter 2 Turbo poster which we gave away last issue. We were also quite surprised to find a number of letters in the post, proclaiming much the same thing. Were they correct? had we, as they say, mucked up? Well, yes and no. The names of the bosses on our poster are, indeed, different to those on the UK version of the game. However, when we produced the poster we didn't have a copy of the UK cart, having to rely instead on the Japanese version which we had in the office. On there, the names of the bosses are exactly the same as those on our poster! So why the difference? Is it because of the same Mike Tyson/M Bison controversy that caused Nintendo to alter the names in the original SF2 cart? Probably. But we'd just like to apologise unreservedly to anyone whose Turbo poster enjoyment we spoiled by printing the names differently to those in the UK version. Sorry. AMANDA TIPPING Budding author Amanda hopes to become the new Jilly Cooper, with her debut novel 'Sweet Revenge almost complete.

And for all you doubting Thomases who believe that you can't have good gameplay on CD, then think again International Tennis Open plays a very good game of tennis, and the difficulty level between the four opponents is well set. It's a pity there's no two-player option, and some of the animation is ropey at times, but generally this is an admirable tennis game.

"MEGA DRIVE by SONY IMAGESOFT .99 | Out December. Contact Sony (071-734 5151) for information. SENSIBLE SOCCER Half-time Once you've selected the options to suit your style of play â length of game, whether or not you require music during a match, differing pitch conditions, it's into the game itself. If you've ever played Kick Off in any of its forms, you'll feel pretty much at home with Sensible Soccer, although when you get down to it, the gameplay differences between the two are quite radical. As in Kick Off, Sensi is viewed from above, but from much higher so there's more of the pitch on view, allowing for a more strategic style of play basically, you can see more of what's going on, in terms of player positions and such, so you can plan passes easier. In fact, it seems all that's missing is the half-time teacup throwing! Generally regarded as THE football game on Amiga, Sensisoccer's now scoring on Mega Drive! THE SWEETS SPICEFACK You can choose from a list of comedy teams including England! THE SWEETS UNDO GOAL! SERRES n the Amiga, there are two big battlers for the title of king of football games Sensible Soccer and Goal!. On the Mega Drive, a similar battle's just about to begin. FIFA Interational Soccer and Sony's Sensible Soccer are the two main contenders for your cash, with plenty of hype surrounding both. Sensible has the pedigree, being arguably the best game around in its Amiga incarnation. It's taken a while, though, for console versions to appear, but appearing they are, with Mega Drive being the first. A match-winning team, that. Is he going to burst through? And the keeper was nowhere! GRAPHICS INNOS DOWN ON THE BENCH FORMATION: It's all very well storming in with a 3-5-2 attack set-up, but it doesn't look very inspired when you're trailing 4-1 at half-time. It's here where you can alter the team's set-up once you return to the pitch, the players automatically fall into the new formation. POSITIONS: What if you go into halftime 0-0 and you need to bring on a bit of new blood to liven up what could otherwise turn out to be a lacklustre second half? Bring on the boss to tinker about with your players' positions perhaps you want to put all your star players up front, for instance? SUBSTITUTIONS: Not every player performs 100% all of the time, and you may need to bring on a replacement with a bit more 'oomph'. Or maybe one of your team has picked up a yellow card and you daren't risk a sending-off? Just pick the player you want to pull off, and swap him with one of your subs and you're guaranteed not to be sworn at, either. GAMEPLAY 95 VALUE Boi STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 108 VERDICT A great scoring chance! IIIIIIIIII YOU'RE A STAR! ONWAUNO Mega Drive Sensi contains all the features of the floppy game and then some. The game runs at a frenetic pace, yet the controls are so simple you'll be scoring goals in no time until you come up against the top computer teams. Sensisoccer really comes into its own, though, when you team up against a friend if you're better than him you'll take great delight in whooping him, and if you're equally skilled then it's a real challenge. The most enjoyable game I've played on the MD in years well done Sensible Software and Sony! MITTITI ou can tell which player you're controlling as he's the one with his shirt number floating just above his head. But wait a moment, what about the ones with a number inside a star? They're your flair players, and each team has three of them. These are the boys you should look to when you're in trouble, as they're more skilful than the rest of the team and find it easier to get past the opposition, ride many of the heavier tackles and score some stunning goals just when you need them. 94 PAUL RAND 30 "

"AMIGA by FACTOR 5 .99 Out: November. Contact Renegade (071-702 3643) for information. REVIEW AMIGA TURRICANO Turrican was good, Turrican 2 was excellent, so will the third instalment be er... excellently good? hat evil bio-mechanical monstrosity known rather boringly as The Machine is up to its old tricks again. Not content with being humiliated twice already it has decided to have another stab at galactic domination. One of the best new features in the game is the addition of a grappling hook attached to your suit which enables you to reach inaccessible areas. If you've played Ocean's film licence of Batman then you'll be familiar with the grappling hook idea. However, in Turrican 3 the method of controlling the hook is extremely responsive and allows for very precise manoeuvring when attached to a platform. However, instead of just increasing the number of baddies on screen, Factor 5 has chosen to make them tougher which seems a more sensible idea as it allows the levels to be to be thought about rather than simply rushing in and blasting everything. The Machine has been destroying whole solar systems, just because it craves power and plenty of it. So who ya gonna call to stop this poor excuse for a baked bean tin annihilating the rest of the population? The United Planet's most decorated war hero, that's who. And by the way, that's you that is. After deciding your gingham shirt and denim hot pants probably aren't the most suitable things to wear while fighting ole Jonnie Machine you wisely decide to slip into your trusted exo-skeleton so that you stand some chance of adding to your medal collection. What this boils down to is basically the old run-and-jump platform romp set over five against-the-clock and-progressively-more-difficult levels, each of which is divided into three separate zones. Of course these aren't empty zones, they've been filled with all sorts of robotic minions created by The Machine. Huggy-types ENERG Ex112225312 5. 13100200 580 Hey, haven't I seen you in the movies or somewhere? The levels have a loose theme running throughout each one. The first, for instance, requires the destruction of as many Alien-esque face-hugger types as you wander through a A hatchery, while the fifth features S machines which are reminiscent of the Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back If you're a top notch gamesplayer it's possible to alter the difficulty level. But be warned because the maniac level is just that. There's loads of moving platforms to contend with during the game. GRAPHICS ONDOS x 13 SPOT Use the grappling hook to reach difficult areas or if you want to be Batman. National power Luckily your suit has enough power to make the National Grid blush, but your weapons are fairly energy intensive so it's important to grab as many energy bonuses as possible. Also available are a multitude of weapon upgrades which include multi-shots, missiles, shields, extra lives, all the regulars basically. GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT 6x13.notzan Lan The maniac level is just like it says and is not something to attempt on your first go. Turrican 3 is one of the best platform games I've played on the Amiga. The 28 tunes are breathtaking and Chris Hulsbeck should win an award for the best Amiga music I've heard. It comple ments the frantic pace perfectly, as does the brilliant FX. AND the whole lot can be listened to in Dolby Surround. Add to this great graphics with heaps of background and sprite variety, a well set difficulty level that can be altered as you get better, mix the lot together and you've got a game that you'd better go and buy right now!

This computer version of Space Hulk is better than its boardgame equivalent. After all it's hard to feel threatened by a plastic figure charging down a cardboard tunnel isn't it? Space Hulk is scary.

SECOND SAMURAO Now in its second incarnation, the beat-'em-up full of eastern promise is ready for a bit of kung fu fighting I think this fellow needs some sleep. Too many late nights has made him go green. Beware in this scene of the lead weight that comes crashing down at any moment (like now). rocket here the backdrops are spectacular and the action superb. The Samurai travels through various places to get to the end of the world, including Japanese gardens, a volcanic world, and a future world. Along the way there is plenty of wrestling, including karate, aikido, taekwondo and the revival of the 1970s cult fighting, kung fu. If there's one criticism to make it's the fact that it's really difficult to get from one level to another because the bloody exits are so well hidden it's a game in itself just to find them. But once the frustration is over and you start a new level the game just gets better and better. This is where the game begins, a serene area of waterfalls and caves. Oh and the guy in black is a friendly chap as if! In the underground cavern of demons this guy has let his battle skills go to his head. GRAPHICS INNOS 86 fter a two-year break oiling those well used arms and legs, the Samurai has returned to a complicated, but cracking platform world. He has to rescue his friend who has been captured by the Demon King and is trapped at the end of the world. Can he save him in time? Second Samurai, the sequel to First Samurai (where do they think of these original titles?) kicks off where the first one left off, and there are some significant improvements weapons scattered around, such as a massive sword, throwing daggers and even a special magic bomb. One thing which puzzles me is how does the samurai manage to jump about so nimbly when he's laden down with so many heavy weapons? . I'm sure Vivid Image is not that concerned about such a minor detail, since it has paid a lot of attention to more important details in the gameplay, such as a shoot-em up section where the Samurai straps on a GAMEPLAY 087845 02000ee.

The soundtrack is effective, giving the game a dramatic feel. There's plenty of hack 'n' slash, exploring, puzzle solving and platforms to keep you occupied well into the early hours of the morning and the backdrops are quite stunning, making a decent change from similar games. Vivid Image deserves a pat on the back for all the hard work it's put into this. And at the same time why not treat yourself and go and get your very own copy.

Alfred is a cute enough character and it is quite a novel idea to have a chicken as a hero, but it doesn't seem to work and the game can become a little dull in some stages, especially when it takes yonks to get through a level and then you die and have to start all over again. However, to be fair the game is quite difficult and gets progressively harder and there is some excitement in finding the secret coves where Mr Peckles is waiting. There is a lot of scope to improve on the simple graphics, which are quite bland, and the soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired. But hey, it's not all bad and it's nice to see that tame games haven't become extinct just yet. NWALION COCO IIIIIIII A 6470 AMANDA TIPPING "

"LREVIEW SNES by STORM .99 Out November. Contact The Sales Curve (071-585 3308) for information. Virtual reality, yes we know you're fed up to your back molars with hearing about it, but listen up because the film that started it all off is the licence for a rather special SNES game... THE LAWNMOWER MAN DR. ANGELO EXPERIMENTED WITH VIRTUAL REALITY TO VASTLY NCREASE JOBE'S INTELLIGENCE What!? Space Invaders return. You have to shoot a certain number before you can move. Lots of digitised movie grabs provide the eerie atmosphere for the game. They pop-up between every stage so you get a breather. ust imagine it, a level of intelligence greater than anything on earth. At least one person doesn't have to imagine anymore because Jobe (once a sad chap who used to mow the lawn) has become virtual reality itself. Locked away in his virtual world Jobe has threatened to merge with the knowledge of all the world's computers. He's totally out of control! Qualcast The Lawnmower Man game is as strange as the film. Its eight levels are morphed together by an array of sub-levels which are games in themselves. One or two players take control of Dr Angelo or Carla in a mind numbing journey through platform terrains and 3D shoot-'em-up action. All the platform stages are set in reality, hence familiar scenery, while all 3D stages are set in the world of virtual reality. Portals link the two worlds and flicker at locations where you can travel no further in reality. Carnage wise you carry two weapons comprising a basic plasma gun and a more complex device called a Bit Stream Weapon. It takes some time to charge up this device, but it becomes vital towards the end of the game where a variety of weird objects are out to kill you. Perhaps the most visually impressive stage in the game with lovely Mode 7 scrolling. VERDICT The first thing you notice about Lawnmower Man is the lovely presentation and moody music. Digitised movie grabs are presented throughout your adventure. On first play the game appears to be very bland with basic platform stuff. Hang-in and you discover a huge, well structured game with distinct sub games that don't push the rest of the game out of direction. All the 3D stuff is fast and furious, while every part of this game is playable. STORM is proving to be a quality SNES label. This is one of the best movie tie-ins ever, and definitely the best on the SNES. 1001 Remember Spy Hunter on the C64?

"VERDICT SUPER Famicom SUPERMER To begin with The Lawnmower Man seems dull, but if you manage to hang on in there and get past the usual shoot'-em-up style of game and enter the Virtual World you'll realise that that's where the fun and excitement is! The graphics are bright and brilliant, especially the 3D bits which make the gameplay even more exciting and there are some excellent stills from the film. There are loads of levels to this game, and they just get progressively crazier and crazier. Enough to keep you busy until virtual reality becomes actual reality. PROS: Lots of variety in the gameplay and a sold movie tie-in. Hey it's Space Harrier! Almost. Shoof Jobe's head and then fly through the seven blocks behind him to deactivate the exit. Very hard I might add. CONS: Looks a bit out of date (C64-ish) on the platform levels. AMANDA TIPPING Cyberpunk Nothing special in platform terms, but some excellent Mode 7 visuals have been used. The main virtual worlds appear in three forms as separate levels: Cyber Run, Cyber Tube and Cyber War. The object in all of these is to reach the exit. Hyper-fast Mode 7 graphics make these quite spectacular considering that the game doesn't even use a DSP or FX chip. These virtual worlds are shoot-'em-up stages and are different to those found in the portals throughout the platform levels. Within those you find a hazardous course littered with bridges and pillars which you have to pass through without any contact. These are very difficult to master because they're bloody fast and you move under momentum so the trick is to move gently and very slightly. Very moody when it needs it and funky elsewhere. Well themed. THEY PROGRAMMED JOBE WITH THEIR OEI    TDEATM ENT TED A MONSTER. Jobe doesn't look too pleased at all, so blast his head again. destruct mechanism. You must destroy all of the terminals to complete the game. GAMEPLAY Lots of variety demands a range of different skills. Classic gaming Back to life Back in reality land your character will encounter obstacles like dustbins which when destroyed will release a fountain of data disks. When you collect enough of these you morph into a cyber suit which functions as a shield. Throughout the game you will come across 10 computer terminals. These present intelligence tests of which five must be completed per terminal in order to activate its self It's a big game, and it plays well. Good use of the licence. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 Shut that door! Inside you'll enter a tricky virtual world. 6 8 It's worth mentioning here about level four. It's during this level that you will notice Lawnmower Man is very similar to the old classic Space Harrier. Here you confront Jobe (well his head anyway) in a shootout to prevent him escaping into the VSI computer. Each time you defeat Jobe a grid of hexagons zoom towards you and the aim is to try and fly through each portal to deactivate it Obviously, you need to beat Jobe seven times so it's very demanding on the finger tips. This is a top licence and I've only covered a smidgen of the game here, so to find out more you'll just have to get it! Nom NOV IIIIIIIII HIT! The last level is a funky vertical shoot-'em-up against the doomsplayer. Swirling plasma backgrounds make this visually moody. 43 "


"REVIEW GAME BOY by NINTENDO .99 Out January. Contact Nintendo (0329 822565) for more information. THE LAWNMOWER MAN The Game Boy is not the best format for virtual reality, but that hasn't stopped Nintendo creating a spectacular game... am sure you all know the plot by the Game Boy screen does have its now, so I won't waste your time limitations. He has to dodge towering and mine by telling you all about blocks and huge grids in the race the not-so-clever Lawnmower Man against time to outwit the government Jobe, who is turned into a raving and take over the world, loonie by the not-so-clever scientist Dr Lawrence Anglo, who likes playing Virtually great around with virtual reality. The games starts off quite tamely in a Megalomaniac suburbian street where Jobe is being pursued by gunmen in a typical shootAnyway Jobe has got it into his vastly 'em-up style. The game progresses intelligent head that he wants to take with him being chased into many virtu over the universe (megalomaniac or a l worlds through the reality levels.

It sounds easy but it isn't. There are many obstacles and enemies which are placed in your way and they are often difficult to avoid. If you fail you retum to the original entrance to the world and you have to try again. If you're not very good at this then it can hold you up for a long time and it can get quite frustrating before you move on in the game, The Lawnmower Man is virtually, the same as the SNES version which is quite commendable because normally the games are found lacking by the time they make it on to the Game Boy. Not with this one, however. TE40 Violence on the Game Boy still looks naff; there's no colour so the blood is all black. There are plenty of levels: Suburbia, The Shop, the Battle Chimps and finally the Doomplayer's VR Chamber from which he dominates his virtual worlds. Don't expect to reach this level in a day or so though. It takes patience and skill, something I don't have! GRAPHICS INNOS GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Running through reality has its problems, namely guards! 8 9 Fly through 3D tunnels for heaps of fun. Shoot anything! VERDICT When I first played Lawnmower Man I didn't like it, probably because I haven't seen the film so I didn't know what was going on. But after a while the game's grown on me It's the first VR game on the Game Boy and considering the small screen it works well. There's plenty of action and shooting scenes, plus loads of sub-levels which are just as tricky as the SNES game. Considering the Game Boy's limitations, Storm have done a commendable job on Lawnmower Man. Very addicfive, very difficult and very enjoyable.

Luckily it's only virtual reality. 90% Complete Could this be the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of the Lawnmower games? TIT AWNMOWER MAN awnmower Man is soon to be available on CD-ROM! Although not completely finished yet (the programmers are in the process of piecing together the various sections of the game), we've managed to take a sneaky peek at the game and it looks a bit of a blinder! The plot is similar to that of the console and handheld versions, in that Jobe has become Cyberjobe, having been rocketed into the world of virtual reality by scientist Dr Angelo, and is out to rule the world as some kind of god. You control Dr Angelo and have to enter the VR computer and hunt down CyberJobe by travelling through a number of different stages, tackling problems and battling virtual enemies as you go. Rescuing your friend Peter and his mother Carla is your first priority and, indeed, a must if you wish to take on Cyberjobe. you may well be impressed by the graphics in CD Lawnmower Man. But you really should see them move! Your virtual character looks incredible as he makes his way around the landscapes not unlike the T-1000 from Terminator 2, in fact. And then there's the sound; Storm has got Steve Hillage of System 7 to create the soundtrack for the game, which sounds like a spaced-out house tune. All in all, an audio-visual treat. As far as the gameplay is concerned, we'd prefer to reserve judgment until we review the game in a month or so, since they are still making tweaks as we go to press. So stay tuned! Quick quiz: are these bees or wasps? Fluid movement and graphics. Graphics that make you go 'blimey'. Terminator Jobe has copied a number of people from his memory and has set them off to attack you, so you have to be careful as you search for the two Cyberstasis Spheres which he has hidden somewhere within the virtual universe and inside which Peter and Carla are locked. Taking a look at the screenshots dotted around the page. 46 As you can tell from this screenshot, the sound is going to be great. LM on PC-CD is gonna be F.A.B. "

"REVIEW PC Out No by GAMETEK .99 Out November. Contact Gametek (0753 553445) for information. FONTIER Why not try mining? Fly up to an asteroid and blow it to bits. The longest awaited sequel ever is finally here, but is it really as good as Elite? So much to do, so much to see The first thing which hits you about this game is the sheer scale of it all. Frontier takes in a galaxy which contains 200,000,000,000 (count 'em) star systems, each with between one and 20 planets. That's a whole lot of Ekal Satunk lite is the granddaddy of all space sims, and although a lot of games have tried to better it, none tise lo Reus 154 have succeeded. Until now, that is. Frontier is a game of space trading, combat and subterfuge, set in a galaxy where two empires are locked in a cold war, Want to be a fat cat stockbroker? You got it. A military spy? You got it. A ruthless assassin? You got it. Or the meanest taxi driver in the universe? No problem. Whatever you want out of this game, it's yours, so get into your spaceship and fly the not so friendly skies So what's so great about Frontier?

You aren't limited to carrying out missions in a certain order, because you have the freedom to go out and do whatever takes your fancy. VERDICT What more can you want? There's so much to see and do that it could keep you going for years. Even better, the game comes on only two disks, and can be played from the floppy drive. The graphics and sound are excellent, but this is only the icing on the cake because the gameplay is so good. If you're the violent type and want to spend your game blowing people away, you can do just that, but if you'd rather play it safe and stay out of trouble, that's fine too. There really is something for everyone here.

"VERDICT go out and get something a bit more appropriate. If you want to make a go of it as a trader, you'll need to get yourself a mother huge cargo ship, but if you aim to be an assassin or military troubleshooter, it's advisable to get yourself something small and fast with plenty of firepower. The world and his wife knows of the Elite phenomenon, and everyone's been waiting for Braben's sequel. Now it's here, and what an incredible game it is! Frontier is an immense piece of software: graphically gorgeous, with ultra-fast moving, excellently defined ships. Sound is terrific and gameplay is frankly unrivalled on the Pc. One of, if not the biggest games ever, Frontier is a title that will make the rest of your software collection obsolete. PROS: Gameplay, graphics and sound are all first rate. It's immense! CONS: It's not the easiest game to get into. AMANDA TIPPING Your old fave, the Cobra MK III, seen here on planet Earth. Mission impossible One of the biggest criticisms of Elite was the fact that it was a bit lacking in the mission department. That's not true of Frontier. Every time you land at a space station or on a planet, you can log-on to a bulletin board and read through all the missions available. Most of these tend to involve ferrying people around the galaxy, though you'll find assassinations, offers to buy your black market goodies and the chance to contact the military and carry out jobs for them. Every mission earns you money, but a lot of them could also earn you a hole in the head. Flying someone to another planet may seem straightforward enough, but if the Mafia wants that person dead, they'll come after you with all guns blazing. Jobs for the boys Like the original Elite, this game is based on trading (buy goods cheap in one place, then fly to another and sell them at a profit), and that's just what you have to do to build up your cash at the beginning of the game. Beyond that, it's up to you. You could get yourself a career in the military (either on the side of the good Federation or the evil, slavetrading Empire), become an explorer, turn to piracy, do a bit of mining or convert your ship into a passengen vehicle and ferry people around the galaxy for lots of dosh. The possibili ties are endless Stunning with the detail on full, but if you have a slower PC you don't lose too much. Relative to Earth SOUND Smart!

Having said that, it does take a while to get into. At the start of the game you have a very basic ship, and until you've got the hang of the controls, it's all too easy to get shot out of the sky by enemy traders. Once you've got the hang of it, though, you're in for a treat. The basic idea behind the game is to make money, and money buys you all sorts of handy equipment to bolt on to your ship. Unlike Elite, you can even buy a whole new ship.

It's the only way to play this. Plenty of gore and blood in your beat\"em-ups, sir? You got it! f there's one thing which has annoyed SNES Owners of Mortal Kombat (judging by your calls) it's the lack of gore and blood. Well, Wolfenstein 3D is the bloodiest SNES game ever. When you shoot someone a fountain of blood splats out, they fall to the ground and a puddle of blood surrounds them. We couldn't believe it but we like it. Unfortunately, as we are going to press we are told that the blood may be taken out. wotenstein Brilliant! A secret room with health, ammo and a weapon: noises you can bet that there'll be a soldier waiting to pump you full of lead on the other side. Initially, you have a feeble hand gun, which is good but can take a few shots to kill people. As you progress you will find a satisfying selection of better guns, the best of which is a chain machine gun. Blasting like Rambo will waste more than a few bullets, particularly with those hefty weapons, so it's vital to top up your ammo before you loose your weapon. You do this by scavenging the supplies dropped when you blast a soldier. Nice sampled speech makes the effect even more realistic! Pump up the lead Set in a HUGE maze you rush around a succession of six levels, searching each floor for that elusive lift which will take you to the next floor. Enemies are abundant and a simple tactic is to listen for them. When you approach a door don't open it immediately, listen and if you hear any Clever dicks Easy? Not exactly, you see the enemy can get clever and attack you from all directions, so it's vital to learn where you can find food or a first-aid kit. The mazes become more complex, with heaps of doors and routes and you start meeting tougher, better armed guards, and occasionally you encounter a boss-type figure. Worse still, some doors get locked so you have to start finding keys and health which get hidden in secret rooms, As you can imagine, it's easy to get lost. But wait a second. All those dead bodies and blood act like a trail showing you where you've been. Other hints include the paintings which lie around, but for variety's sake, different sectors have different themes; some are bland and dungeon like, while oth ers are more grand and occupied with ornaments and paintings. Three difficulty levels control the intensity of assaults on your life. Unfortunately, you don't seem to get any more health items on harder settings so it all becomes a matter of leaming the routes. To help you out, you get access to a self-mapping chart which shows anywhere you've already been. Violence has never felt this good. GRAPHICS ONDOS GAMEPLAY ITEM HEALT STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES The Chain-Gun is devastating! VERDICT At first Wolfenstein seems very shallow, just mindless carnage. After a few levels though, you start to notice an element of strategy, in other words, you start to use your brain to find and unlock doors, discover hidden passages and balance your resources. This is good but you never really get involved, so its appeal will fade quickly, even though technically, it spits over the 3D sections of Jurassic Park with its fast and full-screen graphics. It's a big game and a solid conversion off the PC. Let's hope Nintendo doesn't take the gore out. ONWIN IIIIIIIIIII 80 DENIZ AHMET The dog gets it in the mouth. That should shut him up good. 56 "

GRAPHICS 96 ONNOS game version of the award-winning Disney blockbuster. Unfortunately for panto fans there's no Widow Twankey or Wishey Washey here to help little Aladdin on his way, although there are plenty of sword waving and knife throwing baddies who are quite comical as they grin slyly, enticing our hero to come fight with them. They are part of the gang organised by the sultan's wicked adviser, Jafar, who is also trekking across desert-strewn landscapes to find the mythical lamp, home of the big, blue genie. Genie-us Aladdin is a tricky game, and it does become very difficult on the later levels, but the early stages should be familiar to platform fans as you basically have to leap ledges, skip across gaping rooftops, somersault off flagpoles and climb magical ropes to reach higher platforms. There are various collectables along the way apples can be used to throw at Jafar's henchmen, but if you throw them at knife jugglers they just end up as apple strudel. Also, try and pick up as many jewels as you can because you can use them to barter later on for extra lives, and blue hearts give you extra health. It's pot luck to see if you'll win apples, diamonds or extra Ives or lose everything. RO GAMEPLAY VALUE STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 00 VERDICT Even though Mega Drive owners are spoilt for platform choice, Aladdin just looks so good and plays so well that these factors alone should see it do well. Unfortunately though, it's easy to complete if you got the game for Christmas you'll need something else to occupy you by New Year's Eve. However moving platforms, magic carpets, ropes and high wires all provide the perfect ingredients for a great game while it lasts. Like Disney's cartoons, Aladdin on Mega Drive is lots of fun but perhaps suitable only to young children. But it does look lovely. A ONWAU  Genie-va There are only nine levels, but this isn't surprising considering the amount of animation and comic touches that Virgin has packed into each level. The first stage sees Aladdin scuttling through Agrabah market, then it's on to the desert; the rooftops of the city; dodging the spikes in the dungeons of the Sultan's Dungeon and the Cave of Wonders.

"REVIEW! PC by DIGITAL IMAGE DESIGN .99 Out now: Contact Ocean (061-832 6633) for more information. FITX Possibly the best and most accurate flight sim this year. Could be... t could be a Tuesday or possibly a Wednesday, but it's sometime in the future. A future where civil wars still rage across the globe, from Somalia to Libya and from the former Yugoslavia to Colombia. After years of pointless talking, the UN has pulled its finger out and started the military ball rolling. Yes it's blue hats time because in TFX you take on the role of a top UN pilot, flying fast jets, escorting Hercules transports and bombing suspected drug factories. Whatever the call and whatever the weather the fate of the world is in your slightly sweaty hands. Top gun? Dacka dacka OK so it's another flight sim (you know taking off, flying from A to B, bombing target X and Y and going home, that sort of thing, but why is TFX special? Well, although the screenshots run heavily into shades of drab green and grubby grey, don't be put off because TFX moves and flies magnificently. It has to be seen to be truly appreciated, because watching TFX is like watching a movie where you can zoom low over downtown Tripoli, buzz Port Stanley, dodge A-A fire over Sarejevo and dogfight with MiGs. But what's new? If you think that TFX looks like just another flight sim hold that thought because you're utterly and hugely wrong. In TFX not only do you get to fly three shiny new aircraft, namely the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), the F-22 Superstar and the F-117 Stealth Fighter, DID has also managed to cram in Gouraud shading, texture mapping, military spec flight models, a padlock view, fast 3D polygons and serious gameplay on a variety of levels. Look comprehensive up in the dictionary and it'll say 'See TFX', because this is a game that embraces all flight genre styles. The game structure reflects by offering you six very different game options namely: Arcade, Training, Simulator, Tour of Duty, Flash Points and UN Commander Check out that Gouraud shading, see how the UN logo has been texture mapped onto the tail. just wanna kill TFX is so easy to use you can be up in the air within a few minutes, barrel rolling, diving and shooting as if you had been bom in the cockpit. If you No guns and it looks ugly, but the F117A Stealth Fighter is built for, er, stealth. The tremendously sleek European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). VERDICT TFX is absolutely superb. Like the Aces series you can tailor your flight model and for die-hard flight simmers you have realistic flight models and accurately rendered 3D environments. It's fast, good-looking and fun and when I first saw it my jaw dropped so far it took me 15 minutes to find it again. I strongly believe that it is the best flight sim I have seen this year; Gouraud shading, fast 3D environment graphics, realistic flight models, the works. Put TFX in the sky against Falcon 3.0 and in my humble opinion, Falcon 3.0 is toast! PAUL RAND Dogfight your little heart out in the F22 Superstar. 60 "


"VERDICT Wow. If TFX is the shape of things to come then I want to work for DID. This game sets new standards in graphics, presentation and userfriendliness. It's a great flight simulator package and my only gripe is that it doesn't have a modem option so I can shoot my friends up. You're going to need a really fast computer to do it justice however, and although you can adjust the detail levels I'd say nothing less than a 486 will do the job properly. If Inferno is half as good as TFX is we're all in for a real treat. DENIZ AHMET GUESS WHO'S ABOUT TO BE RELEASED fancy a duck-shoot the TFX Arcade option offers you no-frills shoot-'em action, while at the other end of the scale, UN Commander enables you to design and fly your own missions. Best of all is Flash Points, a campaign option that incorporates various soap opera' style features including cutscenes, mission briefings, UN television reports and thrilling WNN news bulletins. Dogfighting over the Libyan desert. Swing left, swing right and then fire. Tailored G-forces If you're a fan of high-tec flying DID claims the flight models are highly accurate, modelled using USAF methods to include wave drag, roll inertia and lots of other things us mere mortals wouldn't understand without an aeronautics degree. But, if you're not a die-hard enthusiast and you and Mr Realism have never really got along, TFX allows you to tailor your flight model from easy arcade mode to full military spec. Break left! Like Strike Commander TFX has terrific music and sound and like Tomado it has a 'target rich environment' and loads of ground detail. TFX also boasts digitised speech and a built-in speech synthesiser and is possibly the best allround flight sim on the market. & GRAPHICS INNOS MEPLAY Good looking What really makes TFX stand out from the crowd is its fast and accurate 3D graphics technology. The graphic detail is quite superb, proving that if you have a good 3D engine you don't have to sacrifice detail for variety. TFX has the most realistic gaming world I've ever seen. All the major cities, towns, rivers, hills and mountains are in their correct and proper geographical location. In fact a total of one million square kilometres (equivalent to 20 per cent of the Earth's surface) has been carefully mapped by the DID team.

In space no-one can hear you complain about movie-to-computer game licences f you think it can be a nightmare living on earth, then spare a thought for tough girl Ellen Ripley; admittedly she doesn't have to do any maths homework or cope with Monday morning traffic on the M25 en route to work, but she does have to contend with eight-feet tall, acidspitting aliens with razor sharp teeth getting in her way. TIME UP! YOU FAILE TO RESC ALL THE PRISONERS Grenade launcher. Very powerful as you can destroy the aliens with it before they reach you. Pulse rifle. A sure-fire way to blast away the aliens, although it eats up huge ammounts of ammo. It can shoot in all directions, which is handy. Flame throwers. The aliens hate fire so this is a powo erful weapon to use on the creatures that are guarding the prisoners. Hand grenades. Powerful deterrent against aliens in shafts and ramps. Don't explode immediately but they provide a good response when they do. Guns galore By this stage of the review you've probably worked out that Alien 3 the game has little resemblance to Alien 3 the film fact fans will recall that the planet Fiorina didn't actually have any weapons on it for starters. This, however, does not mean that the game's no good, because there is plenty to encourage you through this actionpacked blast. It's too late crying for help now. There are 14 difficult levels, which commence in the penitentiary and lead to the hospital, abbatoir and cell block, and all are set against the clock, making it a real race against time to rescue the prisoners. If you fail you get the unfortunate opportunity of seeing the aliens doing their usual belly-bursting trick out of the stomachs of the remaining prisoners. Mmm, how tasteful. SAIRE ENERGY Haircut Not content at simply surviving her spaceship crash on the penal planet Fiorina, Ripley feels obliged to save all the prisoners in the platoon who have been captured and glued to alien eggs in the colony. Armed with an arsenal of weapons including, a flamethrower, pulse rifle, grenades and grenade launcher, as well as a rather frightening Sinead O'Connorstyle haircut (only shorter), she sets out to totally destroy her old alien adversaries. GRAPHICS INNOS Blast away those alien-type space things to rescue those poor men. Taking on the role of Ripley you have to crawl through underground, bunkers dripping with slime, leap across moving platforms, scale pipes and clamber up and down ladders and steep ramps to reach and rescue the prisoners. Security doors have to be opened by operating the controls at the side these are especially good for trapping aliens in. O mic NEPLAY VALUE STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Watch out for the unwanted wall hanging lurking in the background. 10N VERDICT Mmm I think a little floss and brushing twice a day will cure the problem. Having been converted from the Mega Drive, we expected Amiga Alien 3 to be a top title. The graphic are excellent the invading xenomorphs look remarkably horrific. Most Alien fans will be suitably impressed with this movie-to-game conversion which manages to pack in the action and keep you in suspense, since you never know when an alien is going to leap out into your path. Unfortunately the sound effects are crap, and the music sounded just like an alien chucking up, but these are minor points and don't spoil this otherwise fab game.

Aero isn't a chocolate bar but he's full of milky goodness! ou know why bats have big ears don't you? It's because they spend so much time hanging upside down that gravity takes its toll. Well Aero's had enough of looking at the downside of things which is why he's set off to rid the world of a demented ex-clown So away you go, but which way? The levels in Aero are huge with at least four stages in each of the four worlds. The problem is that with eight-way scrolling you need a good memory to locate yourself, which isn't helped by the lack of memorable landmarks and expanses of empty space in the early stages. Fine, so this satisfies the explorers among you, but you can't help feeling that luck has too much of a role to play, especially during those 'leap of faith moments which are unavoidable given the structure of the platforms. A severe case of bad breath can roast Aero out in the woods. momentarily for a breather. However, It's the circus props which make the game far more fun. Most frequent are the trampoline and the cannon. Aero heaves the cannon into place, hops in and is launched faster than a speeding bullet (if you get the timing right) thus allowing our mate to make it to those parts of the level other bats cannot reach! Refreshers You soon master the various intractable objects and, just when you think you're beginning to tire out their possibilities, you hit a refreshing new style of level. These are of two types; the first is based on a roller coaster ride like those you see down the fairground, which has you jumping and ducking obstacles, while the second is an impressive derivative of Pilot Wings, which involves Aero highdiving in to a pool while flying through loops and being blown of course by his rival, Zero. Another circus prop, and Aero gets ready for a bouncy stunt. CLEVER BAT! Curly Whirly Blocks: Jump to make these vanish and you can find the exit. 105 ONNOS Despite having a head which is too big for his body Aero manages to show-off some nimble moves without being, well, big-headed about it. Aero's main attack is a creative little move which has him curling up and drilling into his opponents. He can also collect the odd star which he can use to sling at obstacles. The main pull' factor of the game however, is in discovering and utilising the various objects which help you make it through a level. Aero himself can cling to high wires and hover Cannons: Hop into these and you can reach higher platforms. GAMEPLAY 90 Oops! Run out of platform and Aero will do his balancing act. Float: Yep, Aero can hover briefly to examine the scenery. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES RDM |||||| 10 VERDICT Teleport: Jumping into stars warps Aero further in the level. Normally, lots of object interaction in a platform game means a puzzle orientated adventure. Not so with Aero. This is an action platform game. Balanced with the crucial ingredients of variety, humour and a strong central character, it's rough and cute at the same time, while being huge and unmanageable with it. At first it seems to be quite basic stuff, but you soon discover a range of creative stages which make Aero all worth while. If you're good you might even reach the hilarious Bungee stage! Recommended. O-NWV lilllllll LITTLE ILLIUM Trampoline: Same as the cannons but with less reach. Unicycle: Just one of the props Aero can play with DENIZ AHMET "

What it lacks in the audio/visual department is made up for with sensible but challenging puzzles and tense atmosphere. A thoughtful save game facility also stops the boredom of repeating completed screens. My one irritation is the fiddly character control but this is because of the joypad rather than a design fault.

"AMIGA by RENEGADE .99 Out Now. Contact Renegade (071 702 3643) for information. One of the best C64 shoot-'em-ups of all time comes screaming into the Nineties on Amiga and about time too! f you weren't playing games seven years back then you'll probably think I'm some jabbering fossil who needs a good fix of hot chocolate. However Uridium I was one smart game, casting you as a pilot of a lone manta spacecraft as you charged over giant space dreadnoughts taking out the ground 'emplacements before escaping Return Of The Jedi-style with the dreadnought disintegrating behind you. The blaster of its time. So what's different this time around? The background story is probably best skipped because if you've played any other shoot-'emup you'll know the sort of plot to expect. If not, then hey, welcome to planet Earth. If you've got an AGA machine you'll get the benefit of the suitably titled mayhem mode where just about every feature in the game is thrown at you. And for two-player fiends there's an option of having a drone ship to follow the main manta, with the main ship concentrating on flying and destroying dreadnought 'emplacements while the drone sup, ports. This extra craft can also be controlled by the computer. O You never saw anything like this on the C64! (13 Manta banter On to the game itself then. First impressions suggest that this is in fact the C64 version playing. The loading music sounds suspiciously like Martin Galway, a music maestro on the 8-bit machine. However, it's the game that Watch out for that enemy fire... Too late! makes you think you've warped back to 1986. Andrew Braybrook has virtually recreated the original on the Amiga with nearly all the original attack waves present. Missing ones have been modified to make them easier. Also, the attack waves can now break formation and attack individually, The Manta can now turn upside down, as well as flip. Essential stuff as the enemy can't hit you while you're in those positions. Also, on later levels, sections of the dreadnoughts are raised up requiring some severe twist ing of the manta to stay in one piece. The only way to avoid the raised sections is to watch the scanner, but this is easier said than done with all the other action happening around you. GRAPHICS 89 ONNOS go Turn sideways and you'll be impervious to enemy fire. Nostalgia, it ain't what it used to be. Weapon pick-ups are available for increased firepower, but to stop the manta craft from being too powerful the enemy has chaff to confuse the power-ups. If you're talented enough to destroy a whole wave of fighters then you'll be rewarded with a victory token. Collect enough of these and you can land early. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 9 VERDICT This brings back happy memories of my old blasting days on the C64. Graphics are great and scrolling is smoother than a freshly bathed baby's bottom. Sound too is top notch and consists of groovy 64esque tunes, superbly atmospheric spot FX and sampled speech. Yes, it's not an original game and it's been done numerous times before but there must be plenty of younger gamers who won't have experienced this piece of software history and, as they say, if it ain't broke then don't fix it. ONWOO lillllllll Preying mantas After landing on a dreadnought the bonus screen appears. This takes place inside the dreadnought's reactor and the aim is to destroy it. This isn't as easy as it sounds as the core exerts a severe gravitational pull which varies the inertia considerably. On top of this the reactor chucks out all manner of defensive weapons in an attempt to protect itself. It's worth persevering though, because after the reactor is destroyed a shower of power-ups rain down. Then it's on to the next level then the next etc... 85 DENIZ AHMET 76 "

There are all the usual pinball features too, such as bouncers, gates, short-cuts and accelerators which have been nicely worked into the graphics. Those aside, traditional Sonic elements have also been placed liberally: Rrings and switches to hidden sections are all in place Floating platforms beneath the flippers will provide a safety route if Sonic is lucky enough to catch hold of one, and even then he has to be quick to avoid the jaws of a lurking monster. Some nice ideas are to be found in the game, but it does little to promote the character as it's basically Sonic's casino level with flippers.

There's no time to lose We're on the case. Sherlock Holmes Vol Il is exactly the same as the first game, except there are three different cases to solve.

It's quite a good idea, putting the cinema screen onto CD, but if you are gong to do it then you should do it properly and in some parts of the game the actors look a bit sketchy. And the graphics leave a lot to be desired, with some of the writing in each clue too illegible to read.

The game has been made harsh for one reason it's designed for two players. This is a shame because it destroys the appeal for solo players. It's not that you can't play it on your own, but you ain't going to get far at all. You start the challenge with a titchy gun, but soon locate heftier armoury. Once you start finding better weapons you know you're going to be hammered by something rather nasty and the end-of-level bosses are 89 no exception. And you'll find these mothers possibly the most difficult and time-consuming baddies ever to be turned into pixels. heaps of landscape. There are only a few of these on each stage, but if you use them you will probably miss out on some valuable collectables in between.

The firepower and combatants come at you thick and fast during the scrolly bits, and get this, if you don't keep moving you face certain death! Occasionally the screen stops and the onslaught overloads from all directions, just like Smash TV. Death is almost guaranteed at these stages and a nice touch to the game is the animated ways in which you die; would you believe that it's actually quite humorous being hacked to death and bumt to a crisp most of the time.

There's plenty of action to twitch the fingers, but the difficulty curve and awkward control configuration can hinder your reaction time in tight situations. You will find the scrolling is a bit jerky too, but credit is due to the programmers who've crammed heaps on to the screens without any slowdown.

"MEGA DRIVE by GREMLIN .99 The ninja from the Nth console. Has he improved? OUT: November. Contact Gremlin (0742 753423) for information time because each stage is played against the clock. The main tactic for making it through each stage is to keep killing baddies because some of them release orange wasps which Zool can gobble up to top up his energy. You need to be quick however, because they soon escape off the top of the screen. Obviously, Zool will need to contend with the odd level guardian on his travels, which is dimension is now on actually a good thing because he then gets to fly his ship temporarily in a bonus stage, searching for more lives and power-ups. Um, but it's not quite that simple though De TIE because Krool soon has his troops vil has only one objective, and To complete a on your tail. Zool get's his pants wet!

The planet which Zool has been dumped on is a strange place, plastered with seven themed worlds on topics such as food, toys, carpentry and the tropics. Each world holds World one boss! Shoot his four stages which become increaswings first and then his body. ingly awkward in layout and logic. GRAPHICS SOUND Zool is cool To keep him safe, Zool has trained in the ways of the ninja, and his nimble body makes short work of obstacles. Zool can run like the clappers, stick to surfaces, kick, shoot and pentorm a deadly drill attack which splats anything in his way. The drill move also enables him to jump higher than normal so it's very useful. GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Zool hits a continuation button. Lots to kill in this world. VERDICT mm Sweets are bad for you. These ones shoot you continuously. Zool is a fast paced Sonic type of game which is more frantic to play but lacks the depth. The graphics always hold your attention, but I can see people completing it quite quickly. The routes through each stage are obvious but it's somewhat annoying when you rush around at top wack and die because you've crashed into a baddie that's difficult to spot against the luminous backdrops. There's a lot of imagination used throughout the worlds, but the gameplay doesn't vary and doesn't require any new skills. Still, it's not bad.

Jump on their heads twice to kill them. here's nothing quite like a fish caught in the frying pan-oops, I meant in action, and there's certainly plenty of that with the second adventure for our fishy hero, James Pond: Licence to Gill. (Groan) This time he's been sent on a mission to thwart the dastardly plans of Dr Maybe, who has just taken over the central control of the toy factory at the North Pole. However, a number of toys are actually disguised as penguins carrying lethal explosive JAMES POMD 2 There was an old woman who lived in a shoe... Watch out for these flies.

GRAPHICS INNOS gy Nine live There are nine parts to James' mission, starting off fairly easy in the sports section of the factory where you have to dodge giant boxing gloves and volleyballs. There's also GAMEPLAY VALUE Smiling happy faces, but not for long if it's up to James. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES leche mode Before long you find yourself in the mechanical section where model trains, cars and crazy wind-up wheels chase you. Then there's bath time and board-games, castles, music and a grand finale at the Big Top. Phew! There are bonus points and secret levels scattered throughout the game, as well as extra lives hidden in secret coves, so search carefully in each level before you decide to move on because there is no turning back. 3 VERDICT A lot of work has gone into the design of this game and it has obviously paid off with the 2,500 colour screens used. The idea of the toy factory is great and Millennium has created quality backdrops, but there still is a lot of scope for improvement: there are too many open spaces. If you're looking for a fairly simple game then skip this, but those seeking a challenge, tuck in because there's loads of things to keep you busy for ages. Die-hard Pond fans should not be without it, if not just for the groovy CD soundtrack.

DESERT FIGHTER SETUP GAME LEVEL PAD CONTROL The Gulf War may be over, but the battle for the best game based on it could soon be won... GAME LEVEL HARD DELIUPEDIZAL BUTTEPE TYPE-A L:SPEED UP R SPEED DOWN KAF TER BURNER A MISSILE You choose which type of aircraft you want to fly, such as the A10 Thunderbolt II, which is a great tank destroyer, or there is the F15 missile plane and the A10, which isn't very easy to steer but it has a turbo throttle which can pick up speed. At the beginning of the game there is a mission brief from the commander-in-charge who will tell you what to do. You cannot go on to the next mission until the first one is complete. (It makes sense doesn't it?) If you fail the mission you're crap and the game is over. GANE START No more wars I hear you cry. Well tough!! Choosing the right tanks can affect the whole war strategy. age? Unlike many other war games Desert Striker has not forgotten us hardworking journalists and there are 20 different news reports from TV station Global Network News. All these extras add up to the making of a great game. It's hoped to be out in the shops on January 15, the third anniversary of the day war broke out in the Gulf, how tasteful. Why did Alfred chicken cross the desert? Sorry, wrong game. Battle The various battle sites include the desert, cities, mountains, oil fields and factories but be careful you don't go to far with too little ammo because you'll have to travel all the way back to base to refill on missiles and fuel. One nice aspect of the game is that you have to make important decisions which could affect the whole of the war strategy. It's a caring, sharing game of the Nineties, for instance if you bomb a city, peace groups will start campaigning, and if you blast an oil slick the environmentalists won't be very happy. Finally what war wouldn't be complete without full media coverTanks are in place, weapons loaded, prepare for conflict! The Second World War launched a multitude of war films, and the Gulf War seems to be having a similar effect, only this time it's the videogaming industry that is reaping the benefits. Desert Fighter is the latest Desert Strike-style game to blast on to your SNES screens. As part of the combined allied forces you have to battle it out across the war-torn deserts of the Middle East in an attempt to quash Sadaam Hussein and his troops. It's not just a question of blowing Saddam's troops away though, you also have to ensure that you do not upset the balance of power in the UN. There are nine difficult missions which include battles with scud missiles, ammunitions dumps, bomb clearance factories and airfields, and the fight begins with you trying to achieve a successful allies landing. INNOS GAMEPLAY GRAPHICS STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Look, we've spotted Elvis. The King lives on!! 9 VERDICT O NW AUOVO I'm not a fan of strategic war games at all, in fact I generally loathe them. That is until I came across Desert Striker. There is so much to do in this game and it isn't all about bombing every thing in sight, which is what I usually do! The graphics look very realistic and the accompanying sound is just as good. You can really hear the engines of the planes and the bombs blasting on the ground and it doesn't glorify war at all, which is another bonus. It's challenging and gripping and I'd say worth every penny. IIIIIIIIII 94 AMANDA TIPPING Be careful not to bomb your own backside. 94 "

No, you haven't stepped back in time but you have walked into the review of possibly the dullest historical game on the SNES, which frankly makes homework seem interesting. Gone are the days when Dungeons & Dragons was the latest craze. But in an attempt to revitalise them Might and Magic II tries to conjure up images of Labyrinth-type creatures who breathe fire and dribble slime.

"MEGA DRIVE by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 Out December. Contact EA (0753 549442) for more information. EA has spent the last couple of The best form of The incredible bicycle kick defence is in full flow. years producing brilliant versions always attack of American games like football and hockey. Now it has turned its attention to real sport, our own national game soccer. Will it be a hat-trick or a bit of an own goal? EA has obviously looked hard at the on-field opposition, and the decision to base its game on an isometric pitch is brave but it works well. The usual problem of the player towards the bottom of the screen having their goalie obscured by netting is avoided because every viewing angle is clear and the fast-scrolling pitch ensures long balls are easily intercepted. play modes: action and simulation. There's little difference between the two but in sim mode players get tired as the game drags on. rom somewhere unknown, like the third division, EA has produced a footy game which is apparently the most comprehensive available. It abandons the customary Sensi and J-League overhead and behind-goal perspectives, and also claims to be the most instinctive to play allowing the use of bicycle kicks, turning volleys and shimmies with little effort. they prove too infallible, so for a more realistic and playable game it's always a good ides to switch them over to manual control then you've got no one to blame but yourselves for mistakes. Flat back four You'd be hard-pushed to outdo Sensi when it comes to options but EA has tried pretty hard. One of the nicer ideas is the system used when the ball is booted out of play. Whenever a comer, throw-in or goal kick is given, a large yellow box is super-imposed on to the pitch. This acts as a rough guide so your attackers can be lined up, but it is only of real use for comers as goal kicks are basically just an opportunity to boot the ball as far upfield as humanly possible. The usual international sides are on offer and there are two Four-play fun As with all recent EA Sports games, FIFA is compatible with the Four-Way Play adaptor. This allows two players to team up against another pair, or assorted combinations including four against the computer! During the one-player game, the player under control is indicated by a large yellow star, which automatically shifts to the player you are passing to. However, for the four-player game, each participant is given a different-coloured star, and this proves confusing and rather tricky to piece together flowing moves because of the confusion of swapping between players. In addition, if the ball is punted towards your goal, it often proves tricky to switch control to the keeper to save it, resulting in goals which would even embarrass Stevie Wonder. Stick to the two-player mode we say... The goal kick system. Gordon Banks to George Best Of course if it looks like Ryan Giggs but plays like the England footy team then what's the point? Luckily FIFA is very playable but there's a nagging doubt over player control it often feels like the computer's in control rather than yourself. Goalies are great and respond to every shot. However, when controlled by the computer, Book 'im ref! If there's one single thing that has been greatly enhanced by the isometric viewpoint, it's probably the fouls. As the two teams bustle around waiting for a corner kick, over zealous attackers can often be seen shoving a defender out of the way! What's more, if a sliding tackle arrives a little too late, the crocked player rolls around the floor clutching his shin in true John Barnes style. Sound too is very groovy. The crowd roar, sing songs and the atmosphere generated is just perfect. VERDICT Everything combines to make Electronic Arts FIFA Soccer a stunning footy game. Lurvely flowing graphics with brilliantly sized sprites and a different to the norm perspective. The sound FX are as realistic as you're likely to get without actually getting up off your bum and walking down to your nearest footy ground. And of course the delightful gameplay is a joy to be part of. While it could certainly do with having more control over events, as it is nothing can touch it. The game's done more than good Brian PAUL RAND The goalie palms it away. 96 "

Don't you guys ever get round to playing anything else on that machine you bought two Christmases ago? As if we haven't devoted enough column inches to the martial arts phenomenon of the year, Tino Coelho of Hyde in Cheshire has written in with some Kombateering hints of his own. His tips are for the Game Gear version... Turn the Game Gear on (excellent start, mate). Hold down buttons 1 and 2 and start, then rotate the pad clockwise until the screen shows Now entering combat'. It should go straight on to the character selection screen; select a character, ie sub zero.

He has constantly got the snack attacks and needs to eat. So what does he do? Take a trip to the local supermarket? Raid MacDonald's? No, Taz is on the look-out for kiwis, large cute yellow-feathered birds, which are nifty on their feet. The best way to catch them is to run behind them buttonbashing the 'catch' button.

"22 RCADE ACTION Sur ER STREET FIGHTER 2 THE TOURNAMENT BATTLE BY CAPCOM BEAT-EM-UP 1-8 PLAYERS uch has been written about the hottest release in the arcades since the first Street Fighter 2 game, but only within the last few weeks have a select band of players been able to play the machine for themselves, and make their evaluation on whether its better than the original. The machine on test in one of London's special evaluation arcades is not the normal Super Street Fighter, launched in Japan last month, but an exclusive Tournament Battle edition that allows up to eight players to compete in this enhanced version against each other. You know Down at the Electrocoin Arcade, one lucky young whippersnapper gets his sweaty paws on one of the first linked Super Streetfighter machines in the country. What we want to know is, why isn't he at school? Ja04 112 "


"The main differences between Super Street Fighter and the original include the addition of four new players, with nine special moves. Cammy Spiral Arrow and Cannon Spike Kicks T Hawk Condor Dive and Skull Buster Punch Fei Long Fire Fury and Blazing Flare Punch Dee Jay Rapid Fire Uppercut, Double Rolling Hook Kick and Air Slasher. These new characters pad out this enhanced version of the game much! more than past upgraded SF2 boards such as Streetfighter 2 Turbo Edition and Hyper Fighting the basic score; get into a ruck with the other battlers in the Streetfighter competition and fight it out for the title of Champion. The real benefit that Super Street Fighter has to offer is the new linked action game. In prototype for some time, Capcom have allowed four cabinets to be connected together for simultaneous action never seen before. Players can buy in at the beginning and select characters (the machine even allows players to fight with the same character if they want.) They can also start a battle towards being the champion of the tournament. After each scrap the winner moves up the ranking until he is the best of the rest. One disadvantage with this is that the players have to actually move seats at the end of a game, depending on their ranking, which can become complicated to follow when you're in the thick of battle. All the graphics have been improved, new moves added to some of the more familiar characters. This is a must to play if you love the cartridge or arcade original. It's the next logical step more characters, more moves and more friends to beat up. If you thought the Streetfighter phenomenon was reaching its end, think again. Kevin Williams With 16 characters to play with, brand new special attacks and a link-up, 8-player tournament option, Super Streetfighter 2 makes all other beat-'em-ups look decidedly not very good!

"SUPER FATAL FURY BY SNK BEAT-EM-UP 1 SAMURAI SHOWDOWN BY SNK SLASH-'EM-UP 1-2 PLAYERS 1-2 PLAYERS Up CORP.OF A RIO.. aus offer. This is still only an enhanced version of the original though, offering slightly improved Fatal Fury action to keep up with releases from other manufacturers rather than a complete reworking of the original, and with this in mind, players may be disappointed with what they get. Kevin Williams re you tired of beat-'em-ups and beginning to think there's nothing new? Well think again, because SNK have released a game that is a breath of fresh air when it comes to stale old fighting titles. Samurai Showdown involves a selection of 12 characters with different skills competing against enemy opponents, using a mixture of fancy sword play, fighting techniques and spectacular powers to defeat a growing number of enemies. The storyline to Samurai Showdown tells of Samurai, Ninja and Knights being gathered to medieval Japan to defeat the malevolent 'Satan's Shogun'. The players use special talents to attempt to defeat his murderous followers, using weapons, explosives and their animal friends. Samurai Showdown has everything. All that is missing is the kitchen sink. Players have great fun trying out each character's special talents, as well as defeating selected opponents. The graphics are stunning and the characters interact with backgrounds when fighting, cutting boxes and vegetation to ribbons when flashing their swords about. Another great feature of the game is the 'zoom-in, zoom-out' effect that keeps the action in the centre of the screen. The game really is thrilling, with you having to beat off the opponents with a mixture of specially timed sword chops, magical spells and button punching action as you try and win the advantage. Everything in Samurai Showdown is well rendered, with gushes of blood appearing everywhere when fighting, making other games look tame. It's about time companies starting looking at other genres other than the Streetfighter style, and with Super SF2 about to clean up, it's a good time to diversify. This is one you can't afford to miss. Kevin Williams BECMU Launched against Super Street Fighter 2, Super Fatal Fury also derives from a successful beat'em-up pedigree. The original was loved by arcade players in America and Japan, knocking Street Fighter 2 off the top spot when launched. Will the sequel do the same? From a player's point of view the game does not look anything special, sporting only more selectable characters, some new backgrounds and a jazzed-up soundtrack. But SNK's fighting games depend on their playability rather than just fancy graphics. For those who have not played the original, the story is that 12 of the world's best fighters are summoned to take part in a televised fighting match, hosted round the world, with the battler who sur vives all the different stages, including bonus skill events, becoming World Champion. Super Fatal Fury has the original list of twelve characters boosted to fourteen, now taking part in the renamed 'Grandmother of all Battles!' The players will find each character enhanced both in reaction times and special moves available. One of the main selling points of the original and, indeed, this game is the special foreground and background jump feature, allowing players' characters to jump from the front to the back of the screen, which gives the game much more depth of play than previously on OLUN GRAPHICS GRAPHICS 2 2 SOUND 2 SOUND 2 GAMEPLAY PLAYER SELECT PLACRO GAMEPLAY CA PLAYER 85 22 OVERALL OVERALL GIBRAROD NUDE 22 114 "

"THORA HIRD Dear YOB, This is the first time I have written to a mag, and I know I risk you calling me a brain-dead saddo and so on, but I've just got to get this off my chest: everyone's forgotten how good home computers are. Nowadays everyone goes on and on about consoles, and all people want to know is which is best out of the Mega Drive and the SNES. Well, I've got a SNES and I think it's pretty good. I've also got an Amiga, and I've got to say I think it's better. Sure, consoles have the biggest games like Streetfighter and Sonic, but Amiga games have tons more depth and have a lot more thought put into them. I don't know why this is, but I spend a hell of a lot more time on the Amiga and the games are cheaper too. I've seen other letters from people who own PCs and they say the same thing. Just look in the swap sections of the mags and you see people swapping their cartridges all the time because they're bored with them. Sometimes you can get sick of a console game in less than a week, but that's very rare with Amiga games. I'm sure you're going to say that I'm talking out of my bum or something, but I think a lot of people will agree with me and they're just too scared to say it because consoles are the big thing at the moment. You don't have to print this letter, but thanks for taking the time to read it. PHILIP OWEN Dorking, Surrey. PS Is it worth me getting a CD32? Are they going to release a disk drive for it, because with all the Amiga games available I think it needs one.  WINNER YOB: As much as it pains me to say it, you're absolutely bloody right. Here at CVG we have access to every machine under the sun, and it's always games like Sensible Soccer, X-Wing and and Elite 2 we end up playing all the time. On the whole, you can count the evergreen console titles on one hand, but you'd need a million fingers to count the classy computer games doing the rounds. As for your question about CD32, my lowly-placed sources tell me there could well be a disk drive for precisely the reason you've stated. Your letter makes a lot of good points and makes them very well, so I've decided that you've won the cash. Congratulations. Suddenly I don't feel very well... ESTHER RANTZEN Dear YOB, Firstly, I'm cacked off with everyone taking the rise out of you. I'm sure you're quite a respectable gent. Secondly, I wish everyone out there would stop begging for the 100 quid. RUSSELL HAMMOND Northampton PS My cat has let rip. UGHQUICKPASSTHEDOMESTOS!

It was a laugh at first but the novelty has really worn off. There are more important things going on in the games world that no-one seems to give a damn about like the price of console games, lack of originality and most important the impact so-called experts have on games. (Y YOB) Like it or not, it's a fact. Remember the outcry over Night Trap which forced Sega to slap a 15 certificate on it? And now Mortal Kombat is subject to mass hysteria from concerned citizens.

"SIENTO ini. 0Â° 0 :: VANESSA REDGRAVE Dear YOB, I would like to ask a couple of questions: 1. Which in your opinion is better: SNES or Mega Drive. 2. Is there a release date for SFIl on Mega Drive? If so, when? 3. Is the Menacer better than the Super Scope. 4. Are there any Rugby League games on either console? Thanks. JASON MORAN Darwin, Australia. PS Be serious when answering this. PSS Say Hi to the kids at Sanderson High School! # # 1 TB th YOB: 1. The SNES is technically a better machine, but the Mega Drive's got more games and, deep breath, I think Special Champion Edition Streetfighter is even better than Turbo. 2. Now. It's ace, by the way as fast as Turbo on the SNES and with a brand new Match Mode unseen anywhere else. 3. Nope. They're both as completely crap as each other. 4. Imagineer's International Rugby is pretty good on the SNES, and currently the best rugby game around. There should be a sequel coming soon as well. lack of support for the PC Engine in this and every magazine for as long as I can remember. If you want my opinion, NEC (makers of the Engine) are the finest console manufacturers in the world, but for whatever reason only die-hard gaming fans have ever really discovered them. Fans like us are a minority, and CVG has to take that into account when planning its issues. Although we'll keep covering the machine, big specials are currently out of the question. All this might change with the arrival of NEC's new 32bit monster, but we'll have to wait and see. 1 YOB:Your rather sad letter and details have been passed on to the Federal Bureau Of Copyright Theft, whose international agents assure me they intend to make an example of you by pressing for the stiffest penalty. By the time you read this, they may already have arrived. Please write from your cell at the labour camp and inform us once again how cool and clever you are. RAUS PIG! PONAD I DOH!..

Oh well, I'd better go now. Keep up the good work, etc. BENJAMIN LEVY Allwoodley, Leeds DUEIL YOB: I have just one word to say to you: now, all I hope is that the Government Censors don't scratch it out before we're allowed to print the mag. They're a bunch of... you know, and they never spot anyD)))) thing. NORMA MAJOR Dear YOB, I have read CVG since October 1988 and have one complaint: why have you never done a complete guide to the PC Engine? The only feature I've seen was four pages in issue 137. Come on, how about a Complete Guide. DOUG ORR Burnley, Lancs. Po 0. O o YOB: If you're the regular reader you claim to be, you'd know I've been banging on about the criminal 06. G.uooo 121 "


". XTAUT ANN DIAMOND SEY! AND Dear YOB, NOTES TOU S lam one of those sad folk with some really crap questions. You're probably thinking 'Oh no, not another one' but I'm still gonna ask them. 1. Which is better: the Game Boy or Game Gear? 2. My mate has got a Mega Drive and I have got an Amiga. Could you tell him that Amigas lick the pants off Bw Mega Drives because he doesn't think so. 3. Could you tell me the location of Bombay Bob's? 4 Questions c2200 4. Is there any Mickey Mouse games coming out for the Amiga? was 9. 5. What exactly is SF Turbo? 79 6. Is there going to be a new Amiga advert because the last one was worse than the Bold Colour ad. 7. What happened to Tim Boone? 8. In issue 139 you said to Daniel Jones that Mario 4 is better than Sonic 2, but I think Mario 4 is a right pile of horse cack. 9. Is there going to be a new series of BAD Influence? If so, when? 10. Is Sonic 1 better than Sonic 2 on the Game Gear. 11. Is there really 100 quid for the best letter or do you just say that so people will write in? 12. If there really is a 100 quid, give it to me YOB old pal. D BRITTON Leeds PS My brother thinks you're dead funny, Il shooter as soon as you can because it's brill. 3. 94 yards North of the public convenience in Farringdon Lane and an equally convenient 10 minutes from central London's Tropical Disease Research Laboratory. 4. I think there are a few 'edutainment packages featuring the squeaky rodent, but they're a bit cacky and best avoided. Capcom holds the rights to Disney arcade games, and it's doubtful they'll develop anything for the Amiga unless somebody sublicenses it, which is unlikely. 5. It's this month's OAP Magic Word. Just approach any sleeping person of pensionable age, get right up to their ear and bellow \"SF Turbo!\" as loud as you can. Provided your parents are nearby you'll receive the reward you so richly deserve. 6. I sincerely hope not. 7. Paul Rand murdered him. 8. Well, by law you are entitled to your insignificant opinion. 9. See question 6. 10. Y-up. 11. Yes. 12. No. PS Your brother is probably as confused as you. Get him to write in with a dozen stupid questions and we'll hold a contest to discover which of you is thickest. Mark your envelope \"Not Brain of Britton\" at the usual address... spia Discuss BARBARA CARTLAND YOB: 1. Game Boy. It's got more games, they're miles better Zelda is completely skill it's easier to carry around and the batteries last longer. Who needs cacky colour when the games are as good as this? 2. Hmm. I'll tell him this: the Mega Drive's got some unbeatable games Gauntlet 4, Sonic 2 and Special Edition Streetfighter but the Amiga is still a kicking machine with some incredible games which get better all the time. Check out Sensible's new World War Dear YOB, On Flashback on the Mega Drive cannot get off Level 1.

Although Alfred doesn't move particularly fast he is able to fly, which speeds things up considerably. No road yolks The SNES version seems to be far more playable than the Amiga original. The graphics are more varied and the levels have a more compact feel to them. In addition you get to peck at a new character called a Meka Chick Boss. It's bigger than something you might consider to be big, so basically its bloody hard. He turns up throughout the game and gets harder each time. We like what we have seen of Alfred on the SNES so far, and once we get our grubby little mitts on the whole Kentucky Fried caboodle we'll give you our final verdict. ou'll not find CVG resorting to any cheap chicken yokes; no not us, we'll leave that to the other sad mags! Alfred Chicken's having a quite a year. After entering the Christchurch by-election earlier this year he's since appeared in his own game which has gone down pretty well with the clucky computer press. Now he's winging his way over to the SNES so if you've not read about the game before here's your chance to discover just what all the feather ruffling's been about Alfred's mission (should you choose to accept it) is to rescue Billy Egg and all his yolk-like friends who have been captured by the evil Meka Chickens by taking part in a good old fashioned platform romp.

"MEGA DRIVE W i n t er by US GOLD LOLYMPICS .99 PREVIEW DECEMBER RELEASE US Gold has a years-old tradition of publishing Olympic-themed games with a compilation feel to them. Ice woman Amanda Tipping gets her ski mittens on the latest.... Stage of Development 95% Completed an't afford to go to the Olympics this winter? Don't worry, let them come to you in the form of the Mega Drive game which is based upon the official 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. During the 12-month design of the game, negotiations have taken place with the organisers of the Olympics. The game is now a licensed product of the XVII Olympic Winter Games in Norway, which take place on February 12 and last for 16 days. iler ammer 194 This is not the way to ski. It's not big and it's not clever. You've got to be fit to try your skill at the biathlon. WARS But instead of standing in the freezing cold watching the games live you can relive the events and have a front seat ticket in the comfort of your own home. The heat is on the ice as the skaters race round the track. Realism There are 10 spectacular events, including bobsleighing, speed skating, ski jumps and even moguls in this game for one to four players, which should appeal to sporting enthusiasts of all ages. And Winter Olympics is very realistic -you can even be easily disqualified. Attention had been paid to the graphics especially the way the skiers jump, twist and crash. There's even a nice touch with the trees blowing in the wind so the skier knows which way to jump to get the best score. In true Olympic fashion the game starts at the prestigious opening ceremony with the skier zooming down a steep slope holding the torch, until he comes to rest at the bottom of the hill where all the players are stan parade in front of a crowd while a band plays. It's quite smart actually and there's even a closing ceremony to finish it off, there's no Desmond Lynam though. Ladies and Gentlemen take off your mittens and give a warm welcome to all the contestants of the 1994 Winter Olympics. May they \"pics. may mey light your fire too!!! 128 "


"Options There are 10 events to choose from. Here we see the initial, crosscountry stages of the biathlon. Note the shooters on the back.... If you don't want to compete in the Full Olympics to start with (if snow's not your forte), then you can play the Mini Olympics, which omit the opening and closing ceremonies and have a smaller number of events to take part in. There's a training session for beginners, too, where you can improve your technique and speed on all events. Winter Olympics can be played in eight languages and typical names from each country have been selected to add that international flavour, if you should choose to play a character from one of the many participating countries, which include Sweden, Norway, Portugal, France, Spain, Germany and Italy (there are 16 in total). The publishers, US Gold actually wrote to the sponsors and asked for a list of surnames from abroad just to ensure accuracy. Looks like this might be a classy addition to the genre. bos THE EVENTS: SKI JUMP: Build up plenty of speed as you plough down the hill. Don't try any fancy manoeuvres though because you'll land flat on your face and be disqualified. DOWNHILL: Dodge the flags and try to steer down the slippery slopes in this fastmoving event. To pick up extra speed you can crouch down, but don't go too fast or you will end up crashing into clumps of trees. LETME 9 0 Another version of the downhill event but on a differ ent track. This one's slightly more difficult. BOB SLEIGH: Good team spirit is needed in this fast downhill icy race, don't leave your team mate behind. GIANT SLALOM: Yet another downhill track with bends-aplenty and it's not at all easy! At least there's the crowd to cheer you along in case you get into difficulty.... SLALOM: Fed up with the flags yet? Well don't be because here's yet another alpine track to keep you from toppling over on your skis. If you ski into difficulty in any of the above four events try and keep your eyes on the tracks in the snow made by other contestants. They can guide you in the right direction. LUGE: Strapped firmly into your sleigh, steer with precision down the course which spirals down the icy mountain. This one will sort out the novices from the experts so stay on track at all times. BIATHLON: This one's a bit tricky and it's very exhausting. First of all you have to ski down a slope within a certain time limit, using your ski poles to guide you. Then it's straight over to a shooting range where you have to hit as many targets as you can. FREESTYLE MOGULS: One of my favourite events despite its stupid name. Steer your way down the extremely fast moving and icy track. If you go too far up the ramp you can roll over and ice sprays all over the TOM Higgins 1. Matsuoka place. It's a little unrealistic: in the real Mcoy the sleighs aren't built to crash but, hey, it makes the game all the more exciting. SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATING: This is a real buttonbashing event where you have to skate as fast as you can round the rink. There are four laps and four contestants. At the end of every event the results are displayed on a scoreboard. If any of the players win something, a medal ceremony takes place and the details are displayed on a separate table. There are also current Olympic and World records to view. Pretty neat, eh? From the sneak preview we have seen of Winter Olympics it looks like it could well do justice to the licence. 129 "

"AMIGA by BLOODHOUSE .99 PREVIEW OOONTUOo NOVEMBER RELEASE Stage of Development 90% Complete The main game screen in all its glory. Here you can see one of the end-of-level guardians it's a right git I can tell you! To proceed, you have to hang on in there and do a real mean spot of baddy blasting. 24. 0900 500 That token near the enemy ship is a smart bomb. Grab it quick! Bloodhouse looks set to show that it's possible to mix brilliant presentation with decent gameplay that you desperately want to try to reach out and touch them. Virtual reality, you could say! Cu loodhouse claims this is \"the first Amiga game ever to make full use of ray tracing,\" â well for once you'd better believe the hype, because the graphics on Stardust are looking seriously groovy. Stardust is coded by the earlier mentioned Finnish coding team, Bloodhouse, and the game looks like a Nineties version of Asteroids. Your mission is to clear five worlds of meteors and alien ships. Each world is divided into six separate zones which can be completed in any order desired. The next world can only be accessed when the present one's completed. Meteor strength depends on colour. Golden meteors are strongest, followed by purple, blue and finally grey. When shot the meteors break up into smaller ones until destroyed. Sometimes a useful token is left and these provide extra weaponry such as gun power-ups, missiles, energy or an extra life. All this action takes place within a strict time limit and if it runs out an evil mothership appears with a horde of little fighters which are nearly impossible to destroy. The ship itself can take a couple of hits and it is also protected by a shield. The amount of damage depends on the speed of collisions with the meteors and alien ships. These ray-traced baddies are very impressive and look so realistic Dartford Once all the zones on a world have been cleared the next is reached by entering a 3D hyperspace tunnel. This is one of the most graphically stunning parts of the game where you have to guide your ship down the tunnel, avoiding the mines and shooting the asteroids which come hurtling towards you. It's difficult to describe but take it from Power-ups are a must if you want to survive for long. us: you won't have seen a more impressive effect on the Amiga. There is also a special mission after some of the worlds where the idea is simply to pick up as many extra lives as possible before fuel runs out. Rocking BOUW This frantic action is accompanied by numerous four channel techno tracks which, thanks to more technical trickery, allows the sound to be played at the same time. Basically this means that the Amiga is pumping out of six instead of the usual four channels of sound. Stardust is shaping up to be one hot game (not to mention sensibly priced other software houses please take note!) so keep reading for a full review soon. The explosions are rather tastefully rendered too. Yummy! 134 One of the tunnel sequences. It moves amazingly fast. Not only do the tunnels move fast but the sprites do too. "

"AMIGA by EUROPRESS EVIEW .99 R 7 LONG STRT PH UUT NOVEMBER RELEASE Pixel Craft, the development team behind Rally, has liaised with Ford Motorsport, Mitsubishi and Subaru to get the detail just right. Stage of Development 100% Completed Broom, broom and lots of other obvious words for a car game intro. Europress' newie, Rally, comes racing (groan) on to the Amiga. MPH 00 30 Great graphics, but what about gameplay? Find out next month. bout five years ago Europress had considerable success with a racing game called Lombard RAC Rally. This sold the best part of 100,000 copies, which was no mean feat for five years ago and a pretty fine show even today. The game wasn't mindblowing by any means, but was playable enough and was one of the first to successfully create that through-the-windscreen look, as opposed to the viewfrom-outside-and-slightly-behind-thecar, plus it had realistic terrain effects like er... hills. in the game and the way they handle in different situations. Developers Pixel Craft spent ages driving around the real life courses to film the various stages of the final four-day section of the World Rally Championship, the tough challenge around which Rally is based. The cars too have been faithfully reproduced. For this the team visited numerous car companies such as Ford Motorsport, Prodrive (the Subaru rally team) and Mitsubishi. Both the Toyota and the Lancia teams sent in pictures and specifications which enabled Pixel Craft to scan them in at a high resolution and then translate them to the sprites which will be seen in the finished game. From the screenshots it would appear that Rally is another horrid Mega CD type game where there's plenty of decent looking graphics but very little in the way of control. Pixel Craft, however, has made sure this isn't so and the car is fully controllable, skids round corners and can even roll over. Although Rally has been developed initially on to the PC, Pixel Craft is making sure the game won't suffer in translation to the Amiga. The game's parameters will be alterable depending on the power of the machine being used. For instance you can choose the number of roadside trees with the result that less trees should mean smoother updates. Europress is touting the game as the closest thing to driving in a real rally. Let's see when we finally review the finished game in the next issue shall we? Five year mission So here we are five years later, five years older and five billion or so racing games later when Europress is close to releasing a sequel to the RAC Rally titled simply 'Rally'. But RAC fans needn't panic because although the RAC prefix has been dropped (Network Q is the sponsor this time), they've still been involved by providing detailed specifications of the cars IPH 00.00 000 Night driving is never easy, and in Rally you probably won't have cats' eyes to help you see where the middle of the road is. \"It's like driving in a real rally,\" but without the punctures! 141 "


"SNES DE SSASS * *00 by MARUBENI TBA PREVIEW HEALTH FLIEL January Like a duck to water, Daffy uses his weapons to blast the submarine. 882200 $88850 POD OSCORE Stage of Development 80% Complete Watch out Daffy, it's behind you! A rendezvous with some old pals. DAFFY DUCK It's the duck with has our hero of the spaceways, Daffy, attitude (and we on a mission to stop Marvin the Martian taking over the galaxy (no, don't mean Orville) not the chocolate kind). Daffy must fend off various aliens along the way et another cartoon character which would make anyone's feathers hits the games screen. Daffy stand on end, and he must also pick Duck follows in the footsteps of up gems and coins which give him his friends, Bugs Bunny, Tazmania, extra points( meaning extra energy). Road Runner and Speedy During his mission, which carries Gonzales. him through five main stages and The game is a spin-off from more than 20 levels, he has to keep Daffy's original cartoon up his health (indicated at the top of series, Duck Dodgers in the the screen) by picking up jugs of 24th and a Half Century and orange juice. What's up duck To fight back against attacks from Martians Daffy can purchase weapons, which include a blaster, freeze gun, electricity gun, bomb gun and anti-matter gun. However, don't forget to stock up on rocket fuel too otherwise Daffs will be coming down to earth with a hard bump! Don't bypass the money bags scattered around because the more cash he finds, the more weapons and other items he can buy. There are a few hidden rooms and areas that contain extra items which are worth picking up that can help him on his way later on in the game. Before Daffy can leave one stage he has to defeat Marvin and his hi-tech weaponp. Once the defeat is complete Daffy's strength and bravery is heralded by the local newspapers (in space, you've got to be kidding!) Anyway, it adds a nice touch to the game and gives your aching hand a rest from the joypad. Another cartoon special included in the bright game is a special nutty attack icon. If Daffy happens to bump into a mushroom cloud, his whole body seems to be taken over by a strange force and he goes mad, twisting, spinning and somersaulting round the screen knocking down enemies left, right and centre. If the graphics are anything to go by this looks like it could be a cracking good game, incorporating lots of fun and gameplay. We'll give you our full verdict in a review next month. RODO0150 SSASSO HEALTH FUEL HEALTH FUEL This vulture looks a bit moody, better blast it away. Spaced out or what? Daffy decides his next move in the mission. 142 "

Any game that offers a stack of tracks, loads of top racing action and a motor like the Lamborghini to drive deserves to be a good 'un and with a CVG rating of 82% it most certainly is! So check out this fab compo giveaway... CARRAZY WITHTITUS AND LAAABORGHINI 2 A Lamborghini featured in which of the following films: Smokey And The Bandit, The Cannonball Run, The Last Boy Scout? 5 Which of the following is NOT a recognised sports car manufacturer: Lamborghini, Ferrari, Lada? which country do you associate with the Lamborghini? es, those testides at Titus, in a fit of generosity, have decided to stump up the goods for this hot comp! What they're offering is TEN (count 'em) Lamborghini goody packs, stuffed to the gunnels with a load of official Lamborghini merchandise T-shirts, caps, sweatshirts, posters, videos, the lot! There's over ,000 worth of gear to be shared between ten of you, so you'd be a bit of a daft 'un to pass up the chance of winning just because you can't be bothered to buy a stamp. And just to give you even less of a reason not to enter, we're going to make it dead easy for you, too! We've come up with a few easy questions, the answers to which we want you to jot down on a postcard or the back of a sealed-down envelope and whizz off to us a bit sharpish, like. Here goes: There, so easy even Deniz could answer them. Probably. Here's the address to send your completed entries to: MY OTHER CAR'S NOT A PATCH ON A LAMBORGHINI EITHER, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. The latest Lamborghini is called the Diabolo true or false? Please ensure your entry reaches us by 14 December 1993, otherwise it'll be taking a ride to the county dump. SMALL PRINT: This competition is not open to employees of Titus or EMAP Images, or their relatives. It's not open to Lamborghini employees either, though why they'd want to try and win their own merchandise when they can just nip into the storeroom and half-inch some of it is beyond me. The editor's decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into. Not even a little bit. ITUS 146 Lamborghini "
