Stunt Race beater? one CD and cartridge Revolutionary Saturn Software console. While Acclaim Acclaim goes licence mad with IN APRIL starts the Judge Dredd Batman Forever and Judge Dredd HSS: After a quiet 1994, is Atari set for a '95 boom? hype machine rolling Pippen: Apple's CD-i challenger and Apple Mac launches Nostalgia give it a rest The all-in-one Jag/CD unit, and above a Jag CD game Blue Lightning. its own CD games/eduRidge Racer watch out Finally, after much speculation, Atari has confirmed it will be releasing the Jaguar CD drive this April. The unit, which features a built-in version of Jeff Minter's Tripatron light synthesiser, is long overdue. Many programmers have complained that they haven't been able to make full use of the Jaguar's capabilities because of the memory limitations of cartridges. Also on the the way, although it's not set to appear here for a while, is an all-in-one Jag/CD machine. And any worries about Atari not being able to manufacture enough machines should be allayed after a $90 million windfall courtesy of Sega (and several law suits citing breach of patents are heading from Atari's solicitors to many big companies). The Jaguar story doesn't stop there. In a recent interview Atari President Sam Tramiel said \"...Atari is already working on Jaguar 2, an even more powerful system that we expect to launch in 1996. No specifications yet, but we'll try to find out more and tell you as soon as poss. In the meantime we'll be bringing you a preview of the CD upgrade and all its software next issue. tainment console. Oh, and Alien Trilogy on Saturn Daytona's here (almost). Atari's new cats "


"NEWS CVG connected SATURN DAYTONA ALMOST READY VIRTUALLY REDUNDANT? 12 Rumours are reaching us that Nintendo isn't planning to release the Virtual Boy in the UK until March 1996. Considering the rather low-key reception it had at both its unveiling in Japan and at the CES, you'd think the Nin' would try to push it now before the Saturn and PlayStation arrive on the scene officially. Loyalty to the mighty N is one thing, but this is really pushing things too far. '24\"45 '04\" 18 306% SHF 2 CONDITIO Does this look a cool driving game or what? Within a couple of months Saturn owners will no longer have to suffer the indignation of having Gale Racer as the machine's only driving game. Daytona is almost complete and ready to roll around April time. The game is currently 80% complete and looks almost as good as the coin-op. Best of all it will have more features and all the speed of the original. It's still impossible to tell how it will match up to Ridge Racer on the PlayStation, but if it really does turn out to be as good as the coin-op it could well have the edge. JU 62398 C49C 303% CHISO 104 CONDITIOS ALIEN TRILOGY INVADES PC BLIGHTERS This is a game we've been after for ages, and it's finally about to happen. Alien Trilogy combines storylines from all three Aliens movies in a 3D shoot-'em-up which, from the early versions we've seen, could well prove to be the best movie tie-in ever. And it's now coming out on PC CD-ROM first, with the Saturn version following around about September. We'll bring more shots and info as soon as we can. There was no denying that Stunt Race FX was a laugh apart from its dodgy two-player mode. Softco Elite must have thought the same, because its forthcoming Dirt Racer SFX looks similar, but promises to be a whole lot more fun. The final version will feature 15 tracks, puzzle modes, two-player head-to-head battles and three different vehicles. It's scheduled for release in May and we'll bring you more pics and info next month. OBIOLOGE These are early shots from Dirt Racer SFX, a Stunt Race FX lookielikey packed full of tracks, puzzles and head-to-head racing. The bitch is back and currently working with Acclaim to bring Alien Trilogy across the formats and also on Saturn. Like, wow. "


"CVG NEWS connected RETROA BAT TO BASICS We're as guilty as any mag when it comes to overdosing on nostalgia, but it looks like Activision could be taking things a bit too far. On its release schedule this year is a compilation pack of Atari 2600 (remember that?) games for the PC. It'll certainly be interest ing, but aren't ex-2600 owners going to struggle to find the cash for the pack even on pension day? Acclaim's other tippedfor-the-top licence is the forthcoming conversion of Batman Forever. The game which makes use of Acclaim's Ultimatte studio facilities and motion capture techniques to Batman, a game you can play provide the digitised forever? Let's hope so. sprites. The 16-bit versions will feature all the villains from the movie, including the likes of Two-face and the Riddler crammed on to 24M-bit cartridges. Acclaim's promising a lot with this game let's hope it delivers. REMSION JUDGEAtari 2600 compilation pushing the barriers of gaming back years! PIPPENEDA ATARI AT THE SNEAK MORTAL KOMBAT POST As if three new machines this year weren't enough, Apple has unveiled its entry. Unlike the likes of the Saturn and PlayStation, the Pippen is pitched along similar lines to the CD-i in that it's one of your all-round home entertainment/edutainment/educa tion machines. It's also being produced in conjunction with toy giants Bandai, so could this lead to any Nintendo games appearing on it in the future? In the meantime the machine should go on sale in Japan and US towards the end of the year priced around $500. We'll bring you the full specs on the machine and software as The Pippen Apple Mac's soon as we can. rival to Philip's CD-I. After being rumoured to have failed in a bid to secure Acclaim's backing for a Jag version of Mortal Kombat 2, Atari has turned to more devious means for a version of the game. Atari's forthcoming home-grown beat-'em-up The Realm Of Fighters features a whole host of well-known martial artists, including those behind the guises of Liu Kang, Shang Tsung, Kitana (who was also Millena and Jade) and Johnny Kage. No word as to how the game looks yet, but it'll be well worth a look. For a flick which so nearly never happened, Judge Dredd is set to make a lot of people a hell of a lot of money. Not least Acclaim, who is banking on it being one of its biggest games for '95. The finished Mega Drive and SNES versions will be a combination of platform and shoot'em-up which, coincidentally, was what Virgin's 1987 conversion of the game was. However, unlike that game which was pretty dire, Acclaim's conversion is going to be a 12-level sci-fi feast of blasting and violence combined with some neat 3D stages. The game fol lows the movie's plot closely, where Joe Dredd's twisted clone-brother Rico returns to Earth with the express aim of 'fitting-up his brother and layJudge Dredd and Mega City One is ing claim to Mega coming to the Mega Drive and City One.

"CUG CES SHOW REPORT   The consumer electronics show hits Vegas every New Year's, and CVG WOZ there, and now gives you the ultimate preview to1995's top games... ULTRA 64 NINTENDO -A-GO-GO TUROK THE DINOSAUR HUNTER ACCLAIM The only real Ultra 64 representation came in the form of a press release from Acclaim and a lonely looking picture taken from the Turok The Dinosaur Hunter title. The game uses Acclaim's pioneering motion-capture technology to create a highly detailed 3D game environment. Apart from that, other details were that Nintendo is confident to have the machine released some time by autumn this year, that most of the early games will make use of the Ultra 64's highly specialised 3D hardware and that several virtual reality-related devices are in the offing for 1996. Meanwhile Spectrum Holobyte is working on a flight sim Top Gun: The New Adventure, which is based on the Top Gun movie from way back when, while UKbased DMA Design, the creator of Lemmings, has also announced its commitment to developing for the Ultra 64. \"So where's the Ultra 64, then?' \"Ah, you'll be wanting to come along to E3 in May to see that. Why don't you have a go of the Virtual Boy instead?' And thus concluded Nintendo's contribution to the new generation gaming at the CES. However, the SNES, and particularly the Game Boy were well represented, and, with a few words in the right 'shell-likes' we did manage to uncover a few more fact-ettes about the Ultra-64. COLOUR GAME BOY REVEALED! Don't wet you pants just yet. Nintendo's colour Game Boy is a brand new range of highly 'exciting' Game Boys with colour cases. The neatest of the lot is the transparent one, although we'll see exactly how neat they are when a UK price is con firmed later in the year. "


"CES SHOW REPORT CUG Connected Comanche SNES Nintendo/Novalogic Novalogic's groundbreaking PC helicopter sim, Comanche, s set to appear on the Super Nintendo later in the year. While the PC version has dated, it'll be a pretty amazing cart if Novalogic, who is using the generation 2 FX chip, can retain the detail of the original. VIRTUAL BOY good things about this one, and we'll bring you more shots as soon as we can. WeaponLord SNES Namco This conversion from the Fox TV series was really hyped up at the last CES show, although nobody got to have a look at it then. There are a few shots out now, but, well, they don't really tell you much do they? So let us enlighten you. It's a platform-cum-beat'em-up with cartoon quality graphics and liberal doses of quite bizarre humour. There you go, don't say we never tell you anything. FX Fighter SNES Nintendo/GTE Nintendo More Virtual Boy products were on show, including a pinball game. The 3D effect does work well, but, as we said before, the machine isn't really the gateway into 32-bit portable gaming. In a moment of high excitement Nintendo also unveiled the recharge. able battery for it, to save you shoving half-a-dozen Duracell into it at a time. How caring, eh? SEIS Starfox 2 SNES Nintendo If you've been murdered by Mortal Kombat and scudded by Street Fighter, this game is probably not for you. WeaponLords promises to be a real kick up the butt for most beat'em-ups. It's been programmed by the team behind Madden '94 and '95 and boasts some of the largest, meanest graphics you've ever seen in a beat-'em-up. It's due to hit the streets in the US on June 21st, with the UK launch following soon after. The Tick SNES Fox Interactive the long awaited 3D beat'em-up FX fighter is still des tined to be long awaited, with the game not due out now until the autumn. However, it's looking better than ever, with even more moves and better graphics. Donkey Kong Land Game Boy Nintendo The sequel to the most popular FX game yet is set to hit the shelves this summer. As well as staying true to the original, Starfox 2 will also feature ground-based walkers and a strategic battle element to give the game more depth. Earth Bound SNES Nintendo Zelda-like RPGs seen to be making a bit of a come-back at the moment, with Earth Bound being the latest on the way. We've heard a lot of Following on from the massive world-wide success of Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, Nintendo previewed the cut-down Game Boy version at CES. It's similar in a lot of ways, not only because its graphics are a cut above anything else seen on the system, but mainly because the finished game will be an almost perfect, although slightly cut-down version of the SNES original. This will be the biggest Game Boy game of '95 without a shadow of a doubt, period. Kirby's Dreamland 2 Game Boy Nintendo The only thing that could possibly come close to challenging Donkey Kong Land's impending Game Boy conquest is Kirby's next outing. Mario's Picross Game Boy Nintendo So far Mario's only confirmed outing this year will be in this little Game Boy puzzler. It looks intriguing, but we don't think Tetris will be in any danger. Dreamland 2 promises larger levels, more Kirby-related special features and enhanced gameplay. It's going to be a lorra lorra laffs, but we reckon DK Land will definitely be the best of the pair. "


"CUG CES SHOW REPORT connected arres -SEGA Sega was certainly having a jolly time of it at the CES. This was partly thanks to the news that Sonic's pals now have the lead over Nintendo in the US marketplace across all formats. The other reason for such jollity was the enormous success of the 32X (in America) and the Saturn (in Japan). At the time of the show the 32X, which had been on the shelves for about six weeks, had already sold over 500.000 units. This may have something to do with the rather attractive price tag of the machine $150 (about ). The Saturn sold a roughly equal number of units in almost half the time over in Japan, making it an even faster seller than the PlayStation (although the PlayStation has apparently shifted more units at present). Sega is predicting sales of over two million units in Japan by the end of the year, which is a surprisingly conservative estimate by Sega's standards. And while Sega didn't have software in bulk, it was certainly up on quality. WHERE ARE YOOOOU? Anvel Comics Comix Zone Mega Drive Sega This was certainly the most impressive Mega Drive game on offer not at least because it's one of the most original titles Sega has produced in many a moon. The game is actually set in a comic book, with your character leaping from frame-toframe in the story battling the wrong-doers within. We were dead impressed with this definitely one of the highlights of the show. X-Men 2 Mega Drive Sega Hot on the heels of Wolverine comes Sega's latest X-Menrelated offering. This time all the characters make an appearance and it really looks as though it's done the licence justice. There are Sega is about to come to the rescue of all those beat-'emup-strapped Mega-CD owners with a tarted up version of Eternal Champions. The basic gameplay's going to be the same as the cartridge version, but with enhanced sound and, shock, a huge amount of animated cartoon segments. plenty of extra features to give it more depth than the standard platform-based punch-ups games like this normally end up as. Eternal Champions Mega-CD Sega Sunsoft has plans for a series of ScoobyDoo games. The idea is for a series of investigative adventures based on episodes of the cartoon. First up for the Mega Drive is Scooby Doo Mystery, featuring Blake's Hotel and Ha Ha Carnival from the episodes of a similar name. Sega CD Comix Zone Good news for rental fans America's pay-per-play Sega Channel has proved a major success in the States and nationwide coverage by the system should be operational by the time you read this. Hopefully this should encourage the Sega bods to give the idea a whirl in Europe meaning the purchasing of carts could be a thing of the past within a couple of years! Hoorah! Except, of course, while games on-line already include such greats as Earthworm Jim there's a predicted three-month lag time between game launch and appearance on the Sega Channel menus. Boo. SEGA TV ON ITS WAY? 12 "


"CES SHOW REPORT CVG Connected ROCKET RETURNS The people from Rocket Science, those thrillseeking ex-Hollywood games producers, were very much in evidence at the show, displaying a triumvirate of new titles for the Mega-CD and 32x, Rocket Boy is the first, which tells the tale of an unfortunate young chap and his dog blasted into space by a home-made rocket. The graphics look exceptional, but we're not sure how it's actually going to play, let alone how good it'll be. Darkride, a so-called psychedelic cyber-coaster' is next up a sort of first-person warp speed maze game which looks quite jolly. Finally, and most promisingly, comes Flying Aces, a WW1 bi-plane/zeppelin dogfighting game which urges you to \"rid the skies of the evil Prussian chowderheads'. Most amusing. ABSOLUTE FABULOUS MOTO KNOWS Mega-CD titles ready to roll. The first two are somewhat similar, being first-person view blastathons planting you in control of giant war machines. Battletech and RDF: Global Conflict (for it is they) boast a mixture of strategy, simulation and mass destruction and should be worth a peek when they hit these shores. The third title was licensed game of those wackily offensive Channel 4 magicians. Featuring specially filmed footage of the pair and a host of cool tricks to humiliate all your friends with, this is bound to be a favourite in the CVG offices. Absolute were looking very pleased with themselves, with their hattrick of exciting new something far more impressive, however, Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors, the official MAGIC MUSHROOM IN BLOOM THO IN SMART IDEA SHOCKER 13 Lemon Head X Sega's magic mushroom, the 32X, was well represented at stands across the show. Sega itself unveiled its next batch of releases. Motherbase is a firstperson polygon-laden space shoot-'em-up, Tempo is a musicbased platform jape starring a grasshopper, Midnight Raiders (a CD title) has the player controlling an Apache attack death helicopter, Fahrenheit (also on CD) is an FMV-based on firefighters and finally there was a third CD title, Surgical Strike an urban crimecracking shooting doom death game. Interplay also announced plans for a radically revamped Blackhawk, C2: Judgement Clay and even the impressive Alone in the Dark, all lined up for 32X release this year. Hurray for Sega's magic mushroom. THQ finally had the brainwave Eestra which could make them major players in the industry the XBAND modem. This little gadget plugs into just about any machine, works with any X X X game, and allows you to participate in multiplayer games with anyone else, anywhere in the world. To top this, it also keeps up-to-the-second league tables of all the games played on the system, so you can see how your per formance compares, even on one-player games, with untold billions of other players. That's the idea anyway, but an impressive number of major developers have signed up to support the system so it could be a major success. Don't expect to see it on these shores for a year at least, however. Opto O M Rut Read Delete Connect Write Return 13 13 "


"CVG CES SHOW REPORT With Atari gearing up for the CD launch, there wasn't too much Jag Software. But what was around was certainly impressive... connected aces BACK JAGUAR ROAR? JAG WEAR Flashback Jaguar owners are in for a real treat when they get their hands on this spot-on conversion of the PC classic. It'll have all the features of the classic original, which means the instant accolade of 'best Jaguar platform game'. ets of blood. One thing's for certain, it does have some of the coolest characters ever in a combat game. Space War 2000 Following soon after the CD drive will be the Atari Jaguar's very own virtual reality headset. No price has been fixed as yet, and the technical specifica tions are at best sketchy, but if Atari can put it out at the right price, it could well be on to a winner. Even if it does look like you're wearing the console on your head. 30 Ultra Vortex After the disappointing Kasumi Ninja, this is exactly the game Atari needs to save face when it comes to beat'em-ups. Ultra Vortex looks very similar to Way Of The Warrior on 3DO, with large digitised characters and buckhook two machines together. It's basically very simple, just track down your enemy and shoot them with the biggest weapon you can find. Hover Strike The texture mapping and Gourard shading in this game certainly look impressive, but the programmers will need to incorporate a few gameplay devices to stop it becoming This novel head-to-head shoot-'em-up should work with the Jag Link cable so you can just another run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up. 3DO-K There wasn't much in the way of 3D0 software on show the majority of it being held over to E3 in May. The rumour that 3DO Doom was going to be the best version was whizzing round though, so we're currently hot on its trail and hope to bring you some shots next month. Creative labs finally unveiled the 3D0 Blaster the 3DO card for the PC along with an estimated UK price of . Goldstar tentatively named April as a launch date for its 3DO, although it's slipped so much already we'll believe it when we see it. BLASTER 14 "

"CUG CES SHOW REPORT While consoles flagged, the PC pushed on, bolstered by one of its best software showings in years. The software was good, varied and above all there was plenty of it. So here are a few of the high, and low, lights of the show. connected aces PC PERFECT COMPUTER? ADULT ZONE G-Nome PC CD-ROM Merit Studios As if being Earth's top geezer and running the world wasn't enough hassle to begin with, this sim cum RPG, featuring 3D graphics and state-of-the art Artificial Intelligence has a nasty twist of having one of your six most trusted advisors stabbing you in the back and grabbing the presidential throne. You must rout him out, keep playing the political game and ensure the world's running smoothly all at the same time — no mean task. Alex Dampier World Hockey '95 PC CD-ROM Merit Studios One, erm, interesting trend which ran through the show was a vast amount of adult orientated software. Across various stands nubile young lasses were getting undressed, dressed again in a small amount of something see-through, being shot at, chased, molested and falling at the feet of rough-neck heroes in a variety of CDROM product. It was certainly what you'd call eye-opening, but it doesn't do much for gaming's image. OT18:29 Prepare for a trip to the 22nd century where you're the leading lawman and trouble's afoot on the desert planet, Ruhelen. An archaeologist has discovered a creature which was long thought extinct. Unfortunately, it's alive and well and attacking all in sight. Your job in this interactive arcade adventure is to stop this monster in its tracks, fight off the other alien interlopers who've moved in for a piece of the action, and uncover the mystery of the G-Nome. Groovy! Cyberjudas PC CD-ROM Merit Studios Alex Dampier, who he? Star of this ice hockey sim apparently which features over 3,200 players, each with their own editable stats; a training ground, league, challenge and multiplayer options and variable rule sets. Realms of Arkania Star Trail PC CD-ROM Sir-Tech Time for a bit of fantasy role-playing and a quest for a few legendary and hugely powerful artifacts such as the Salamander Gem and the Star Trail. Better get moving through that 3D environment and talk pretty fast to all those weirdoes you're gonna meet, though, 'cos unsurprisingly others are after these ultimate prizes too. You're gonna have to keep your weapons stacked up and your wits about you so you can waste them when they rear their ugly heads. Nerves of Steel PC CD-ROM Merit Studios It's Doom clone time with this blaster set somewhere in South East Asia sometime in the future. Run around a bit blasting all and sundry until the lethal Iron Triangle army and its leader Kim Dung Moon have been wiped out. Guns ahoy! Ravenloft: Stone Prophet PC CD-ROM Mindscape Hold on to your breakfasts we're heading for a horror ride with a gory new puzzle adventure. The game aim's to escape from the dreaded 16 "


"CES SHOW REPORT CVG connected SPACEBALL AVENGER PC CONTROLLER realm of Har'Akir and its ancient mummy ruler, Anhktepot taking you through acres of dank dungeons and past legions of facially challenged monsters. At least you get to fly though. Hurrah. The Romantic Blue PC CD-ROM Crystalvision PC CD-ROM Merit Studios Chocks away, it's time for a bit of arcade flight combat experience in the world's top fighter plane — but without the steep learning curve. Real maps combine with tough combat missions, an awesome arsenal and actual combat video footage in a 3D environment on a tour of the world's most dangerous hot spots. Terra Nova Strike Force Centaliri PC CD-ROM LookGlass Technologies From the creators of Ultima and System Shock comes a shiny new real-time full Spacetec IMC Keyboard, mouse and joystick control could become a thing of the past with the invention of a groovy new gadget called the Spaceball avenger. This contraption allows you to zip around 3D action games with an ever-increasing acceleration and fluidity (allegedly). Featuring a PowerSensor ball requiring minimum pressure and a few key buttons, this handy little widget is compatible with the likes of Doom I and II, Wolfenstein and System Shock to name but a few. No news of when it might appear on these hallowed shores though. Shame. Virtual Vegas Volume One: Blackjack PC CD-ROM surveillance systems going. Masses of FMV surround the mounds of missions designed to test your leadership skills to the hilt. The Fortress of Dr Radiaki PC/PC CD-ROM Merit Studios Virtual Vegas Yuch what a sloppy title, fortunately we're not talking Mills and Boon type drivel here. It's more of a graphic adventure than anything, with a horde of monsters in that there mansion and they're after your entrails so watch it, right? Nowt romantic about that, eh? Fighter Wing A carnage-ridden adventure with a few giggles thrown in is the name of the game in Dr Radiaki, which throws you up against sword-wielding Samurai's, stealthy ninja warriors, robots with toasters and hungry alligators to name but a few adversaries. As we're so skill, we've already had this in for review, which you can see in Super Shorts elsewhere in this issue. Blown Away PC CDROM/ PENTIUM Imagination Pilots Credits motion, first-person combat sim which has you clunking around texture-mapped worlds in your Powered Battle Armour packed with the most advanced weapons and Voice recognition technology makes this one a bit different, allowing you to chat with the dealers and place your bets with the dolled-up dealers in the steamy world of Las Vegas casinos where Blackjack's the name and winning's the game (or something). It's entirely 3D rendered and there's a choice of three blackjack tables (all, no doubt with a different lady at your beck and call). Hmm. Sento/ Creep Clash PC CD-ROM 47-Tek We've never heard of these guys but these two CD-ROM titles both look pretty hot. In Creep Clash you're pitched against all manner of ghouls, ghosties and other ghastly creatures of the night in a seriously spooky fight for survival. The Pentium-recommended Sento is a fight to the finish against four battle lords and their Dopplegangers with whichever weapon happens to come to hand. VR STYLEE One of the worst things about VR headsets is that they look so awful. These new i-Glasses from Virtual 10, though are a completely different thing. You're still going to look a bit silly gawping at stuff that nobody else can see, but these specs also give you 3D images and the effect of looking at an 80-inch screen. Cor. Apparently a huge hit on the PC in the States, Blown Away is about to be released for Pentiums making it bigger, better and a whole pile faster than before. Starring you against the world, there's action aplenty packed in, setting you a series of tough challenges against the clock with the threat of unexploded bombs ever present should you put a foot wrong.

"TEKNO PREVIEW CVG SATURN Sega -058 Walk down the main shopping streets in Tokyo and you'll see Saturns being sold next to PlayStations. On one side Virtua Fighter, on the other Ridge Racer and Toshinden. It's obvious that the latter impresses the most. By the time you read this we'll have copies of Starblade and Cybersled for our PlayStation. The Saturn will have the relatively obscure Gotha and Shinobi X. This is when the Saturn can strike back. The Shinobi series has been one of Sega's biggest sellers worldwide and gives the firm an established name on its machine something which Sony can't match. And this is the reason why Sega has pulled out all the stops to make this game so impressive. The game's characters are all digitised using motion capture techniques which gives the characters a very Mortal Kombat-style appearance. The effect works, though, providing fluid animation and realism. The same goes for the backdrops, many of which are digitised and feature additional animation and sequences to help bring the game to life. Aware that tampering is one of the easiest ways to destroy a game, Shinobi's programmers If Shinobi X is a success on the Saturn there's a very good chance of Sega producing a follow-up, although let's just hope that it actually makes same changes, and doesn't just re-hash the game the same way they did with the Mega Drive games. have tried to keep the game true to the original. Many of the main character's moves are the same, although he now has a range of Magic attacks which are designed, partly, just to show off all the clever things the Saturn can do with graphics. Shinobi should be the game that rekindles people's faith in Saturn software, while at the same time proving you don't need 3D graphics to make a great game. GUTS, AND BLOOD AND NINJAS AND DOOM! Shinobi X promises to be one of the most violent games the Saturn will see this year, with plenty of blood and some spectacular death sequences. But it won't hold the violence crown forever. Word is reaching us that top Doom-ster iD has plans to produce either Doom 2, or its follow-up Quake on the Saturn. Details are sketchy, but it could well turn out to be ready in time for the machine's official release in September. -020 -08 TWO-HEADED EAGLES OF DOOM Obviously motion capture doesn't deliver the kind of fantasy creatures that inhabit some of the stranger levels of Shinobi. For those, such as this two-headed eagle thing, Silicon Graphics work stations where wheeled in to render the creatures in 64,000 colours. This is the first time that motion capture and Silicon Graphics graphics have been combined in a platform game. As you can see, the result works excellently. "


"CVG REVIEW TEKNO NIGHT OF THE LIVING CIRCLES the new nachines Some of these pics may make the game look sprite-based, but Victory Goal is in fact another example of the Saturn's superlative polygon-handling capabilities. Each player is actually made up of a number of ellipsoids, moving in conjunction with each other to provide a realistic motion effect. The upshot of this is that it's a piece of cake to scale in and out of the screen with deft use of the Land R buttons. Pause the game and you can rotate the screen about 45 degrees to either side too. Don't zoom in too close, however, or you'll lose all empathy with the now vaguely insectoid-looking players. SATURN Sega Out Now Out Now SEGALATURN AN I AM VICTORY GOAL... HEAR ME ROAR For a football game, Victory Goal has one of the best intro sequences produced (well, that I've seen anyway).

The unique combination of ultraplayability and the cuddly shark mascot for Team Grampus has conspired to lift these titles out of the realm of ordinary footie titles. But that's not all the J League is responsible for. Gary Lineker used to be such a nice young chap before he joined Grampus, and now what? He's nicking bags of crisps from innocent little kids, that's what. It's true, I've seen it on the telly. That's what a couple of months with a shark on your chest does for you Mind you should be able to find all this out for yourself with the advent of Victory Goal, the first soccer title for the Saturn and another J League title. Within minutes of sitting down to play it our offices were deafened with cries of 'That was never a goal!' and 'You can stick that corner where the sun don't shine, smash kid!' and no one had even tried playing Grampus then. But of course, this happens no matter what game you're playing.

Playing down the pitch results in a lot of confusion and not knowing where your players are. VERDICT SATURN International Superstar Soccer on the SNES doesn't have any scaling, or rotation, or stadiumsweeping special effects, but it's a far superior game to Victory Goal. This title is like the World Cup Soccer, the first footie title for the Mega Drive it goes a little way to dis. playing the future capabilities of the machine but neglects to include any really exciting gameplay. There's no aftertouch, things move too slowly and there's not enough scope for employing tactics. Not awful, but certainly not the tour de force we were expecting. RAD AUTOMATIC F11 SECOND OPINION A It's possible to change your team formation before the game, but it doesn't make much difference. Don't be fooled by these screenshots. Victory Goal is a big miss in my book. The 3D doesn't work very well, the number of moves the players have is limited, aftertouch is almost non-existent and the ball is almost the same size as the players' torsos. Sega would have been better off concentrating on gameplay first then building the graphics around it. Cut your losses and buy a SNES and International Super Star Soccer.

The finger-breaking special attacks are there, along with hidden characters and a decent challenge, but the game can be tailored for novices which is something you don't see very often these days. But, ultimately, it's the graphics that make the game. If they were a woman she'd have the body of Jet, the face of Winona Ryder, the cooking ability of Delia Smith, and probably wouldn't give me a second look.

"REVIEW CVG Sophia, the young lass with the taste for whips and leather gear, is one of the most well rounded fighters in the game. HEAD-TO-HEAD VIRTUA FIGHTER We don't want to do down Virtua Fighter, which is a very fine game indeed, but for playability and graphics, Toshinden has a noticeably sharper edge. It is a little unfair to compare the two, but we thought we should anyway. However, although Toshinden is the better game, remember that Virtua Fighter was a bit of a rush job and Virtua Fighter 2 is on the way os 365 later this year... In the meantime, you can see why Toshinden made number three in the Japanese console chart. Still, things could well even out by the time the machines are launched over here. OVERALL 94 When your character performs a special move they also say things like \"Hoah chi; sonic flash; deadly ray and hell's inferno.\" GRAPHICS 96 SOUND PLAYABILITY 95 VALUE 89 VERDICT Toshinden's sound effects don't quite give the same feeling of two people clubbing each other senseless that you get in Virtua Fighter. TEAM VERDICT GARY LORD If Virtua Fighter was a Ford Escort it would be your basic model compared to the Toshinden special edition with all the extras: powered steering, sunroof, special moves and big swords. HUERTO PLAYSTATION Quite simply this is the best fighting game ever to grace the CVG games room. Obviously the graphics are a major influencing factor, but it also plays exceptionally well. Much of this is down to the 3D graphics which, unlike Virtua Fighter, really do add a new dimension to the gameplay. It's a far more action orientated game, with plenty of special moves and Samurai Shodown-style sword slashes. It is a little easy though, and expert gamesters will probably be most at home in very hard mode. Cor, technology eh?

You see, much of 'Nam was fought in the jungle, and it was the war that brought the 'copter to the fore as a combat flying machine. But it wasn't the helicopter that lost the Yanks the war, if you want to know go and watch a few Coppolla and Oliver Stone movies. Anyway, as I was saying jungles and helicopters, the two main ingredients of Gremlin's new PC shoot-'em-up. The Strike series of games have been, to coin a phrase, phenomenally successful'. They started life on the Mega Drive, but Gremlin has overhauled the graphics and included 15 minutes of high quality FMV, especially filmed for this version. There's also a brand spanking new campaign that's exclusive to this version. Jungle is the second of the 3D, isometric shoot-'em-ups. The key to Strike games is the control method of the Commanche attack 'copter, and not wasting too many of your Hellfire missiles. Well that's what I find to be the trick, but we'll be letting you know any others, and whether this version is any cop, next issue, don't touch that dial, as they say (on the radio that is). Obviously a Radio One DJ en route to work. A There are nine mis. sions and three different craft to control. A \"I'm lost, is this Urban Strike on Mega Drive?\" Various locations: snow, mountains and this one... river. There are five co-pilots to choose from, so there are five other peeps you can blame for your mistakes. A General Kilbaba (desert madman) may be dead but now you have his mad son to contend with. Obviously it's hereditary madness. THERE WILL BE NO WHITEWASH AT THE WHITEHOUSE One of your missions, the first one in fact, is to escort the president (Mr President as he's known) to the Whitehouse. Prior to this there are little sub missions, which involve you knocking out various enemy bases of Carlos Ortega (drugs baron) who has teamed up with Kilbaba the Younger (desert madman) to launch an attack on the US. And watch out for that sniper, otherwise it's JFK time again. A When on a beach holiday don't take a hut with raised legs. * LED Fire a Hellcat at the corner of Madison and 44th.

Initially armed with just rifles, grenades and baz ookas can be picked up during many of the missions and a number of vehicles such as skidoos, jeeps and tanks must be utilised for success in later levels. Each soldier's rank increases for every mission completed and this rewards the little guys with better rifle and grenade accuracy. Mission briefs are simple, the aim is either to annihilate all enemy soldiers or just their buildings. Cannon Fodder isn't just an all-out blast though, tactics are required to get through some levels and for this reason the troops can be split up into separate units to tackle enemy troops from different directions. The 3DO version will feature all the Silicon Graphics cut scenes and intro featured in the PC CD-ROM version, as well as the promotional pop video that accompanied the release of the spectacularly unsuccessful Cannon Fodder single. SMOOTH INTRO The amusing intro featured in the PC CD-ROM version is here and runs more smoothly. It introduces some of the stars of the game and the 'mishaps they encounter. RETTHY Quicksand will provide just as much trouble as in previous versions. It's quite easy to guide the soldiers into the old sucky sucky while concentrating on blasting at enemies.

Like, art, man. 82 00 Ose Coming soon to a prehistoric era near you... C Kid has been around for don key's years now, although he has not always had the same name. His first appearence was on a now-defunct NEC console under the name of PC Kid. Presumably he spent his days referring to old people as 'those of restricted youth', complaining about 'The Word' and covering up piano legs. But now, in his new guise as BC Kid, he's a loin-cloth wearing, head butting, kebab-eating plat. form warrior from hell. And here at CVG there's a special place in our collective heart for anyone who eats a whole spit of kebab meat as a power-up. Especially when it changes his whole head into one of three more powerful super-bonces. Anyway, this is BC Kid's Second outing on the Game Boy, hence the numeric suffix. It sees the little fellow traversing a wide variety of landscapes, from trains to space via underwater levels and the like. Each environment alters the way our hero behaves under your control, so he's got extra huge jumping abilities in space and so forth. There's all the usual hidden bits and bonus games you'd expect from a modern Game Boy platform title, but with extra headbutts. Hopefully we should have a full review in time for next isue watch out for this one, you crazy Game Boy heads.

MEGA DRIVE SNES Shoot them in the head, Harry. It's what they deserve. Dog mess is an offence! The corpses mount up as our hero takes a pleas. ant stroll through the leafy green. SNES ne of the biggest films of last year, True Lies, garnered a large following of fans. Anxious not to displease these masses, Acclaim has promised a faithful film-to-game conversion. This means it takes ages to get into, features a host of irritating co-characters and has a boring and over-long (not to mention dubious) wife-harrasing sequence slapped in the middle for no apparent reason. Ha! Only joshing! While the True Lies game does stick fairly closely to the original story there's a much justified by-pass of the flick's slower sections in favour of an all-out isometric gun-slinging extravaganza. Perhaps unsurprisingly, you play the part of Harry Trask, the man who manages to hide the fact he's a jet-setting global sectret agent from his wife, despite his slightly unfeasible physique and large collection of guns and bombs. Your job is, not putting too fine a point on it, to blow the cockles and mussels out of everyone you see who isn't holding a walking stick or a wine glass. There's a vast show of hardware on display and plenty of targets at which to point it. You have, barring any schedule slippages, approximately one month to prepare yourself.

Find your location! ou can tell when you've got a genuine mad scientist on your hands because they insist on giving their projects outrageously convoluted monikers. Where your average sane scientist would have christened the first product of his cybernetics project Robot 01 or Andy the Android, the sinister boffin of this latest 3DO shooter lumbered his unfortunate Frankenstein's mechanoid with the rather long title: Iron Angel of the Apocalypse. It's a bit presumptuous of him as well, because he's not even sure if it works properly. This, predictably, is where you come in, playing the part of old Angelcakes himself, with a brief to crush, kill and destroy in the name of science. Basically, it's something of a Doom clone with robot graphics and no A kill... kill the robot testyour-weight machine! gore. The version we played, which was about 70% complete, was a mite tardy with the update and game speed, but this should all apparently be rectified by the time the game proper hits the shelves, along with the addition of more weapons, enemies and so on. Despite the mass of extra work underway, the early demo was still quite good fun, so we're looking forward to seeing how Iron Angel of the Apocalypse finally shapes up. Hope they A keep the full title. Another evil guardian robot meets its demise at the hands of your bad self. GAME BY SYNERGY INC CONTACT 3DO (0181-541 4082) FOR INFO 46 "

"PREVIEWS CVG PROGRESS Unconfirmed Programmed by Digital Pictures Initiated 1994/early 1992 190% complete Shoot-'em-up/Strategy 132x versions planned Mega-CD versions Acclaim/Digital Pictures avallable Estimated release March MACINTOSH CORPSE KILLER CORPSE KILLER AIRSTRIP One of the reasons Digital Pictures' FMV shoot-'em-ups haven't been quite as successful as the company would like is probably because most of its releases started life on Mega-CD, with limited colour and dire graphic resolution. Things are going to change, though, providing you're one of the fortunates with a 32X... them, if you don't then read the review next month to find out whether or not you've got a hot date with a compact disc in the very near future. NIGHT TRAP Precursor to the superior sequel Double Switch was Night Trap, which enjoyed a brief period of notoriety in the tabloids. Apparently, shots of underdressed Californian teenagers being harassed by a gang of mutants were unsuitable viewing for children. What a pity nobody told the producers of Saved By the Bell. Anyway, in this title you're given control, via a special sneaky splice, of a number of security booby traps installed by an evil vampire family in their own home. Your job is to save the lives of a group of unsuspecting teens by trapping the wrongdoers in their own contraptions. 93 CORPSE KILLER Wow man, check out those raving zombies! Intense man! f these Mac versions are anything to go on things are going to be much better for Digital Pictures. The games are, essentially, identical to the Mega-CD originals, with Corpse Killer being a shoot-'em-up and Night Trap being a puzzle-cumstrategy adventure. There's no doubting both game's presentation, however playability was a bit of a problem first time around. What remains to be seen is how much of a difference the improved graphics make. If you already own either of these, you'll probably be best off sticking with NIGHT TRAP A Hey mate, hic... hey mate can y'shpare ten pensh? NIGHT TRAP CORPSE KILLER Sticky panjammers no problem for Flush-O-Rod! ACCESS SILE POSSIBLE CAPTURED BATHROOM PAUSE NIGHT TRAP A But you KNEW I was coming as Darth Vader!

CORPSE KILLER NIGHT TRAP TODO CORPSE KILLER Set on a Caribbean island this firstperson perspective shooter has you on a mission to smash the zombie army of an evil mad scientist genius type.

Billions of shambling dead people swarm around your jeep as it hurtles through the jungle-esque environment, and your task is simply to kill them all.

Yes, watch those fights break out. hey're tiny, they're teeny, but still larger than Al Paciney that's those wacky miniature toys they call the Micro Mach ines. Well known for being both small and replicas of vehicles, the Micro Machines made it big with game players when they starred in their own game courtesy of Code Masters. Last year's Mega Drive sequel proved equally popular with the cart-buying public and now hey!, it's on its way over to the Game Gear. The sequel features updated gameplay, loads more vehicles to race and a host of new backgrounds upon which to race them. Dragsters, dumper trucks, Mini Micro WW Beetles and a whole mess of other perky perambulators make their presence felt. All this plus brand new hazards such as revolving corn cobs, bouncy spider webs and collapsing sand bridges. Set for release Mis TUBO ORNA TOURNAMENT in the first quarter of this year, CodeMasters is hoping Micro Machines 2 will repeat the incredible success of its predecessor (number one in the Game Gear charts for ages).

"CVG PREVIEW WORK IN PROGRESS PROGRESS Unconfirmed Platform Acclaim Funconfirmed Programmed by LJN Initiated August 1994 75% complete No other versions planned No other versions available Estimated release date March ... MEGA DRIVE/SNES MEGA DRIVE SNES These weeds grab hold of Hero and pull him underground. The Mega Drive version of Warlock also features puzzle-solving elements. WARLOCK The warlock has a nasty habit of mutating seemingly innocent objects into bad. tempered, violent versions of their former selves. Remember Warlock? One of the last Eighties-style sentiment-free action movies? Hmm, how about the sequel? Still not there? Well you'd better refresh your memory, 'coz the game's almost here... SNES e really wanted to tell you a bit more about the original Warlock movie. We've all seen it, but apart from the fact it stars Julian Sands and has a few decent scenes, we can't remember any more than that. And the only Warlock we could find in our out-ofdate Leonard Maltin's Film and TV guide was made in 1959, starred Deforest Kelley, Henry Fonda, Anthony Quinn, got three stars and was a western. What we do remember is that the Warlock himself was a bit of a git really. In the original flick he gained the power of flight by boiling and drinking the fat of a small boy before trying to raise Satan in a small suburb of Boston. He's still out to destroy the world as we know it, but without the Satanic bits because this is good, clean family fun. The hero out to stop him is a druid called, appropriately, Hero. He's no match for the Warlock when it comes to magic, but he is the good guy so he's in with at least a fighting chance. Who knows where Acclaim's penchant for movie licences will end? How about Dark Star, or perhaps the Children's Film Foundation's classic Robin Hood Junior, complete with the beflared Keith Chegwin. Then again, perhaps not... MAGIC TEKNO RAVE GLOBE MEGA DRIVE Hero, being a druid and whatnot, obviously partakes in the kind of state-altering substances the shaman and mystics the world over have considered an integral part of the job for the past 5,000 or so years. But what with this being the 20th century he accompanies his magic with one of those teckno hand-jives you often see at raves. This unleashes the magic disco globe which smites any enemies. Just like this... OK, there's a zombie and for some reason you don't want to zap him with your electric bolt. So what do you do? Look to the heavens, blow your plastic whistle, chuck back a bottle of Lucozade and chant 'Teckno, tec. kno, teckno' while waving your hands in a strange manner. But it works! Just watch that Seventies-disco party globe zip across the screen and catch that co-ed zombie a right ding between the eyes.

The two games are progressing along similar lines like so many licences these days. Most of the differences will be graphical, and it looks as though the SNES version will have a slight edge, but the Mega Drive does have a few gameplay extras. MEGA DRIVE SNES MEGA DRIVE Dog sees tree, dog walks to tree, dog pees on tree; end of story really. WASTA One noticeable feature of the Mega Drive version is its blood something totally absent from the SNES game. MEGA DRIVE SNES SNESS MEGA DRIVE And jolly pretty both versions look we think you'll find. Also on the first level of the Mega Drive version there's an elevator in the college.

That ghost is as clean as a whistle, it's obviously been washed in Surf Automatic. Even though these are early versions, the finished product won't deviate much and both games will follow the same plot.

"CVG LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH SOFTWARE PRIZE WINNER WRONG SECTION 1 Do you think The Immortal is a forgotten classic? CVG: We've certainly forgotten about in the bag Does anyone out there still remember how to write a letter? If so stop e-mailing the universe, dust down that pen and pad and write to us about whatever subject you like, as long as it's about computers and consoles that is. Stick the whole caboodle in an envelope and snail mail it to us at the usual address. And of course you're still welcome to blast your thoughts down the infobahn if you want, it's just we miss tearing open envelopes that's all. 2 Why not manufacture machines and games in Europe so SEGA etc, can keep its prices down. More people would buy games and there would be no import taxes, so profits would not fall. If you answer 'It is not so simple', why not? CVG: It is not so simple! But seriously how much cheaper do you want hardware to be! Despite being made abroad, at their current prices, Sega and Nintendo sell the SNES and Mega Drive at around , making a loss in the process. They make their cash on software. Most software houses manufacture their own chips, they just buy the outer cases from Nintendo or Sega. Nintendo and Sega keep a close eye on this because they charge the software houses a royalty for every cart manufactured, as well as the base cost. It works well so why change it? 3 Is Cosmic Spacehead and Fantastic Dizzy worth  on one cart? CVG: Does a rocking horse plop? 4 I can't find a Jaguar anywhere in Dublin. Is it the same in England? Someone told me there are not enough games to warrant selling them. CVG: Unfortunately Atari seems to have problems understanding the term 'marketing'. It had the best handheld in the shape of the Lynx and the best home computer in the shape of the Falcon but both flopped severely as Atari put little cash into marketing them. Unless Atari changes its ways in marketing the Jaguar, it's likely to go the same way in the face of massive competition from PlayStation, Saturn, 3DO and Ultra 64. 5 The 32X is going to be a flop, I guarantee it. When this happens in a year's time, remember me. CVG: There's no way that it's going to as successful as the Mega Drive or Master System, but Sega's marketing millions will ensure it's not a disaster. 6 Saturn and Playstation video recorders? What? They don't have built-in FMV, do they? CVG: No but they are capable of doing so which is the best excuse our tax-happy government can think of for slapping additional duty on them. 7 What is 'real' time'? CVG: No time is real. Everything is eternal, it just changes form now and then. 8 The Mega Drive is better than the SNES. Not technically, no. But games wise, upgrade wise and software-support wise (nice phrases Ed). Games usually come out first on Mega Drive or receive more acclaim. And the sales figures show this. Do you agree? CVG: Not really. For starters the Mega Drive is technically better than the SNES in some areas. You wouldn't catch a game that scrolls as fast as Sonic on the SNES for instance. The SNES might also see some sort of upgrade option in the near future, either in the shape of the fabled CD drive or a plug-in upgrade 32X style. The fact that the Mega Drive receives more support than the SNES owes more than anything to the high costs of producing SNES software; think how few major SNES developers there are. True, there is probably a better range of Mega Drive software but the the best games like Mario, Donkey Kong and Mario Kart tend to be on the SNES. And while Mega Drive games might come out first, the SNES version is generally better. Titles like Mortal Kombat 2, Super Streetfighter 2 and EA's Sports series spring to mind. John Foley, Dublin. GO AWAY THEN I think there's little point buying consoles or computers. I mean after around two years they become dated and then another more expensive console replaces it. MA Khan, Surrey CVG: Yeh right. If people like you ruled the world we'd still be living in caves and using a horse and carriage to school instead of a bus. It's called progress mate and it's what makes this world such a dynamic and fascinating place to hang out. No one is forced to buy a bigger and better console, they want to, and as long as they do manufacturers will meet that demand. Also games such as Donkey Kong prove that the SNES can still go into new territory: the 16 bits have plenty of life left in them yet, certainly more than two years, so like we have to disagree with you there, Mr Luddite. CVG: Please make sure your correspondence is addressed to the correct section of the magazine, admittedly this one wasn't but we decided to make an exception in this case since John made a number of interesting points that we thought would be more at home in the letters section than Help!

"LETTERS CUG LAP 3 TIED 1924 BEST D' 3294 BEC 0'2778 SOFTWARE PRICE MOANS I have a Mega Drive and Game Boy and as I have to save up for months and months before I can afford a new game I'm somewhat concerned about the rise and rise of software prices. A Mega Drive game costs between -70 in Egypt and my parents won't help me out at all because they think video games are rubbish, and that I should pay more attention to my school work. So all want to know is why games and games machines are so very expensive? Thank you for your time. Ahmed Alaa Darwish, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia PLUUUUU la HE CEH EM TOUCHY CD32 FOSITION 1 1/9 OWNER ARE OUR LOL I'm a very annoyed CD32 owner. Though your magazine claims to be all-formats you seem extremelv ignorant about CD32 games. For instance in your review of Desert Strike on PC you say that no more versions are planned. What a lie! Ocean is releasing Desert Strike on the CD32. Another thing. In your review of Mega Race for the (pathetic) Mega CD you claim no more versions are being planned. Another lie! MegaRace is being released on CD32 by Cryo. And (yet) another lie (or mistake). On your 'Work in progress' of Novastorm you neglect to mention that Novastorm is being converted to CD32. You also seem to have a dislike of the CD32. In your review of Fire and Ice in issue 155 (page 82) you claim that good CD32 platformers are rare. What about Quak, Bubba 'N' Stix, Chuck Rock 2 and Superfrog. I could go on. I know that you do cover some CD32 games that come out, but that doesn't make up for the neglect and dislike you seem to have towards my brilliant machine. I hope you print my letter, as I feel that there are many other annoyed CD32 owners out there. These complaints of mine are the few faults which make CVG a good mag instead of a great one. Shane O'Sullivan, Co. Cork, Ireland CVG: The high cost of console games is due to a number of reasons. Firstly games cost a lot to develop these days. Gone are the days of one-man programming teams, now they are likely to consist of ten or more people. Secondly chips are expensive to manufacture. Thirdly Nintendo and Sega charge the software houses a percentage on every cart that is sold. And you've got to remember that games don't sell as well in some countries as they do in others, so less are imported which puts the price up further. Unfortunately the only thing you can do about it is to see if you can order a game from a UK mail-order company, which might save you a bit of cash. CANNON PC GAMES? Why is everyone getting so excited about using the PC as a games machine? Let's face it PCs are very crap indeed when it comes to LUI playing games, those analogue joyports are rubbish and are no contender for a decent joypad. With all these new super consoles on the way, I hope the PC as a games machine dies and goes back to doing the serious things it's meant to. James Vernon, Derby e./9 CVG: We try to make sure everything that goes into the magazine is accurate. Novastorm is not coming out on CD32 and Desert Strike is still not definite, but yes we do concede that MegaRace is, but when we contacted the Software Toolworks as to whether any other versions were coming out they told us that there weren't any at that time. By saying the CD32 has a lack of decent platformers we mean original ones, that haven't been ported over directly from the Amiga, just as the ones you mention have been. CVG does not hate any games machine, we are independent and multi-format and we treat all machines fairly. We don't review every CD32 game just like we don't review every SNES game, partly because of space and partly because we pick the games that we feel you the readers want to know about, and sometimes the rest of the releases are simply not worthy of the space devoted to them. CVG: While the PC isn't yet able to handle arcade games as well as consoles, times are changin'. A number of manufacturers make excellent joypads which are almost as responsive as those found on a console. And let's face it, the PC's sims and strategy games are second to none. The PlayStation and Saturn might pose an immediate threat, but because there's such a huge installed userbase worldwide computer developers are not going to let the PC fall behind for long. SEGA SLACK? I am writing in to tell you the reason why I don't want a Mega 32X. It's a good machine which blows the socks off the Mega-CD, but I think Sega is only using it as a temporary way of keeping the money rolling in until the Saturn is finished. At a cost of , the 32X is going to seem tempting to people that cannot wait to get into 32-bit gaming and cannot afford other more expensive choices around now, like the 3DO. The problem is that the 32X does not look like an appealing long term prospect. With big companies such as Electronic Arts announcing they are not going to develop games for the machine, I for one am immediately put off. There is also the question of power. While the 32X might seem powerful at the moment, the next generation of CD machines like the Saturn and Ultra 64 are just around the corner. I don't think Sega will continue developing for 32X when Saturn is out. My tip is to only buy it if you can't wait for anything else. You'd be better forking out another  for the Jaguar, which has the promise of a cheap CD-ROM drive to follow and is 64-bit. James Hamilton, Basingstoke HAPPY AMIGAN At last Commodore has been bought! Let's hope the new management team get things moving ASAP. I want some new hardware soon, like a RISC-based, PC-compatible Amiga with CD-ROM. Yum! Wil Deenan, Bristol 55 "

"THE REVIEWS START HERE... CUG reviewed this month... RICITARIO elcome to our Christmas hang-over special. In the words of the streetwise 'we have a hard-hitting, bootyshaking, review-packed issue for you'. Homewise. Anyway, top of our tops list in a review stylee this ish has to be the rather incredible Toshinden on PlayStation. Meanwhile Acclaim has been hotter than a cow in summer this month with its double of Mortal 32X and NBA Jam Tournament. Next month should see Shinobi Xhitting our shores (you can read about how important that game is on page 20) along with some great SNES and Mega Drive carts. I'd tell you what they are, but I've run out of room. You'll just have to buy the next issue, I suppose. Mark Patterson Editor NBA Jam p. 102 What we're playing this month Toshinden p.24 This month's hot-hits MARK Discworld/PC Probably the funniest game ever, featuring loads of top ace actors (and bird actors) and a fantastic script. As well as being a smart game, of course. Premier Manager 3/PC Take command of the mighty Crewe Alex (second division no hopers) and lead them to Premiership victory. If you're a saddo like Rad. But it's really, really great. Toshinden/PSX Possibly the bestest hitting game everest written. And don't fancy that little girl, right. Still, the one with the whip's a bit interesting wonder if she charges by the hour? Station software is like I can't blinking wait to see what's next. This is more than good enough to be getting on with, however. Skeleton Krew/MD A highly playable and shock horror original Mega Drive shoot-'em-up. Truly Core is the software master of the Earth. Story of Thor/MD High on atmosphere and action, low on bad bits, that's Thor. Takes a lot of thought as well as a lot of skill, and the plot's pretty smart also. Discworld p.92 Here at CVG we don't give high scores away lightly. A game has to be rather special before it scores 90% or over and a CVG Hit. Even rarer though is a CVG Gold (awarded to games that have pushed back the boundaries of gaming) but don't expect to see more than a few of these a year as it takes a score of over 96% to earn one. Anyway, here are the top games this month... Story of Thor p. 24 NBA Jam Tournament/MD Boom shakalaka, he's going downtown, slams it in, oh no It's Bill Clinton, hope he doesn't play the saxaphone. Absolutely great. Demolition Man/3DO Pretty mindless, but great fun nonetheless. The use of stereo really makes you feel like you're there, too. Well, nearly. You know what I mean. 24 Toshinden Mortal Kombat 2 66 Theme Park Premier Manager 92 Disc World 102 NBA Jam GARY Story of Thor/MD Not as indepth as any of the Zelda or Shining Force series, but a completely action-packed adventure hack 'n'-slay rompathon. . STEVE Toshinden/PSX Easy to get into thanks to the one-button special moves mode, but seriously challenging enoughwhen played properly. Ridge Racer/PSX Call me a Sony slut, but I can't drag myself away from this hunka hunka burning game. Skillosity in the house. Side Pocket/SNES Allowed me to relive my misspent youth as Paul Newman Jr, and also fea. tures some of the best crap soundtracks ever written. The big picture RAD Toshinden PSX Gurning fajitas, if this is what the early Play If any other version of a game is available, then we'll tell you via our Alternatives and Other Versions boxes. We'll even tell you if it's destined for any other formats. For consistency's sake, games retain the original scores in alternative boxes. 52 "


"CVG REVIEW 1 32X Beat-'em-up Acclaim .99 Out Now Game Boy, Game Gear, SNES, Mega Drive and Amiga versions available Saturn version planned MEGA DRIVE SUB-ZERO THIS Not content with dominating his minions in 16-bitville, Shao Kahn has taken some of the cash Acclaim made from the deal and moved to 32bitland where larger, sprightlier targets lurk... Ooh, that'll sting in the morning. We have, as it's known in the trade, 'a winner'. o, I absolutely will not go into the scenario of Mortal Kombat ll again. There's no way these fingers are going to type how Shang Tsung has returned to Outworld after his failed mission to overthrow the Earth, and that his master, Shao Kahn, has seen fit to organise a larger tournament and forced six humans and six mutants to fight it out for his entertainment. No, I just won't reiterate that. Bugger. I just did. Still, this is the game 32X owners have been crying out for. After the atrocity that was Cosmic Carnage and the less than inspiring Afterburner, Space Harrier and Motocross, poor 32% owners must have been wondering if they were ever likely to see a halfway decent game for the plug-thru ever again. Heeding their cries, Acclaim has stepped to the LINS rescue with an enhanced version of the coin-op conversion everyone was talking about last year. Shao Kahn, Baraka and all the gang are back, but this time they look more detailed than ever before, and little touches missing from the Mega Drive game due to memory problems have been restored. If Acclaim is to be believed, Mortal Kombat 11 for the 32X is as close to the coin-op as is feasibly possible. So let's wash one side in Brand X and the other in special CVG and see just how well it fares... The moves are the same as before.

"REVIEW CVG 99 PUSH ST KUNG LED SPOT THE DIFFERENCE START On first sight, 32X Mortal Kombat Il doesn't look particularly different from the existing Mega Drive game. However, closer scrutiny reveals scores of little touches here and there which make a marked improvement when viewed next to the 16-bit original. Developer Probe has made the most of the 32X's processing power and palette to add larger sprites and colour to the action. Baraka, Liu kang and co tower above their Mega Drive, cousins, and each sprite uses more colour and shading than before. Similarly, most of the foreground and background details missing before have been replaced, with birds of prey now doing the rounds in certain areas and chains framing the dead pool location. All the 32X's 256 colours have been used to good effect and the game is now very close to the coin-op -we don't use the word identical as the sprites are still smaller than the arcade version. Finally, the other main aesthetic addition is slightly less noticeable, but equally important, as Probe's programmers have replaced all the frames of animation that also fell by the wayside. A lll never understand these new dance crazes... MILEENA WINS FRENOSHIP Baraka's shred move is as effective as ever. Hands up if you use Right Guard... Hands down if you don't. JUGGLING BRAWLS Conspicuous by their absence in the Mega Drive version were 'juggle combos. For the uninitiated, a combo is a series of moves strung together which sap your enemy's energy bar without them getting a punch in! Similarly, a juggle combo is where a punch rocks your opponent off their feet, and follows it up with a flurry of moves hitting them in mid air. Thus, while it was impossible to deliver such a combo on the Mega Drive version, 32X MKII allows clever players to remove between 50-100% of their opponent's energy at one go. Al had a cold like that once. Hello, my name is Rayden and I'd like to talk to you about God. MEGA DRIVE THE TWO OF US? So you're sitting there, reading this and you're thinking: 'well it don't look that different to me?'. Well, for those of you who are incredibly hard to please, we proudly present key aspects of the game in both their original Mega Drive incarnation and on the MD32X for your delectation. Can you see the extra colours now? And the larger sprites? Good... 32X A Rayden and Shao Khan have a disagreement about the new Mega Drive 32X. 59 "


"CVG REVIEW INTRODUCING.. Introducing the 32x game is a rather neat selection of stills lifted from the original coin-op, detailing the scenario and the build up to the Kombative battles. Due to the memory-intensive nature of such graphic code these and the 'versus' boxes which introduce each bout never appeared in any of the console versions. Now, however, they have returned and are joined by info boxes containing a small plotrelated history of each character although the arcade game's end sequence still hasn't survived the transition to the small screen. Boo! Hiss! But maybe it'll make it to the Saturn version. Stay tuned readers. A Oh Rayden, will you marry me?

SECOND OPINION SUB-ZERO 32X Initially, 32X MKII doesn't look that impressive apart from the intro pics and interlude bits. After a while, though you notice little touches like more colour here and there. Then you realise the chains in the dead pool are back, and that the sprites are larger. Probe has polished the existing code and bunged back anything it left out of the Mega Drive game and in turn has created an almost perfect conversion. The best addition, though, is the return of the juggle combos. This will keep 32Xers busy for ages. STEVE MERRET I was initially very impressed with the original Mega Drive MKII conversion, but had tempered my lust for the game in anticipation of Mortal III — so I wasn't expecting that much from this conversion. Which was a bit silly of me, actually. Apart from the cosmetic changes (which add a whole lot of extra atmos') the reappearance of juggle combos improves the gameplay noticeably. Ah well, no-one's getting any work out of me in the foreseeable future.

Every tactic from long ball to fluid passing can be employed in the game. he unadulterated piece of crap that was the original Kick Off 3 was rightly consigned to most people's dustbins. No one could argue with that. What people will argue about is how much of an improvement this version is. It looks as though they've almost got it right. Kick Off 3 European Challenge is more than just a football game. A comprehensive tactics editor ensures that you can alter everything from set pieces to last-minute goal blitzes. There are also a few novel features we haven't seen before in a football game. The addition of playmakers, key players who have the ability to transform a game, is brilliant and something that other companies should look at 'adopting for their games. The action side of the game is fast and furious, but let down slightly by the graphics which should have been much better. Combine this with something like FIFA on 3D0 and you'd be looking at the perfect football game, but on its own Kick Off 3 is great, but slightly flawed. VERDICT Run little Johnny, run. Those red blokes are coming for you. SGICE Player Choose from loads of teams from around the world complete with almostreal player names. PC Kick Off 3 is the most complete football game ever. It's pure football, dealing with every element of the tactical game without overloading you with a management aspect. The action side of the game is great fun, but more so because it's good to see how your tactical planning turns out. One thing's for certain it's tough. This is probably one of the hardest football games ever written and we recommend you play it with a Gravis Gamepad. A very good spin on the football game format let's hope they do a better looking sequel.

"CVG REVIEW 3DO Shoot-'em-up Virgin Interactive Entertainment .99 Out Now INo other versions available Mega-CD version planned From a film starring Sly, to a song from Sting, and now a game that has very little to do with any of the above... Sly isn't bullet-proof, and the villains in the game are better shots than those of the movie. 995 brought us some half-decent action films: bringing up the rear was Keanu's Speed, filling up the summery middle was Arnie's return to form in True Lies, and right back at the very beginning was the futuristic action fest that was Demolition Man. Now the latter is set in 2032, where a loonie played by Wes Snipes has been defrosted from a cryogenic prison (a sort of human Bejams) where he was sent in 1996 and is now wreaking havoc in the futuristic, peaceful San Angeles. The only person capable of thwarting Snipes' violent plans is his fellow freezer chum, Sly Stallone, who's been, as they say, 'fitted up and frozen alongside Snipes. No doubt there is some loose connection with the aforementioned and this game, though it escapes me because all you end up doing is shooting and punching people. Demo Man is a lot of fun, and would be even better if you had a light gun as opposed to the 3DO's cumbersome joypad. What you lose on the joypad however, you more than make up for in the spot FX and tremendous soundtrack. The graphics too are very polished with smooth transitions between the FMV, action and rendered cut-sequences. A The Sly and Wes digitised beat-'em-up section looks great, but it doesn't play that well. The odd ne'er-do-well will try and sneak past and shoot you into high heaven, so make sure that you're on target. Deur 2500 Shoot at certain objects and they explode, along with the guys hiding behind them. 00000 800 DEMOLITION SITE FOR SORE EYES I know all you Sly aficionados can't wait to see Mr Stallone in his Judge Dredd guise, but until then why not take in a bit of full motion video from last year's smash action movie, not that it seems to have any thing to do with the gameplay though! dem 2997 A Each of the levels has an excellent 3D perspective.

"REVIEW CVG IT'S FLICKIN' FMV! What usually makes a good film licence is a game that includes various game genres in one title. Demo Man does this well, and you get some excellent shots from the movie to boot! A Shoot the grenades before they make contact with you. A The Doomstyle section is too dark. y When your victims die they make some very convincing dieing noises. VERDICT Throughout the game you only get a basic hand gun to get rid of ugly muthas like this. SECOND OPINION Demolition Man is an impressive title for a number of reasons. For starters, Monsignor Stallone himself was called in to shoot footage exclusively for the FMV intermissions the first time this has been done. It's also a neat game. Like the film, it's not at all mentally challenging but the constant blasting action keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like Gary, I lament the poor quality of the 3DO joypad which spoils things somewhat, but get yourself a SNES-3DO joypad convertor and this is real fun. RAD AUTOMATIC LEOS 3DO Demolition Man is a most excellent bit of blasting, totally vacuous and linear, but the sort of game that can do the 3DO no real harm a Lethal Enforcers. style shoot-'em-up with a some beat-'em-up and Doom-style elements thrown in. The sound track is excellent and the FMV is high quality 3D0 stuff. The real quibble though has to be the irksome joypad, 'joy' being a contradiction in terms, and also don't expect any long term playability from this 'ere game, but in the short term a nice bit of shoot-'em-up fun for the 3DO crowd.

"CVG REVIEW SATURN RPG Sunsoft -80 Out Now WPC and Mac available No other versions planned ECO Out Now SEGASATURN An apt title, considering this is no hit. here is a phrase used by ailing rock 'stars' attempting to convince doubting Thomases of their success and stature which runs 'We're really big in Japan'. Of course they are. Everything's big in Japan. There's about eighty-seven billion people living in Japan. No matter what you do, just going by the law of averages, a large number of people are going to like it. Pre-masticated chewing gum is big in Japan for Lord's sake. And so, despite the antipathy which greets them elsewhere in the world, are first-person adventure games. That's not to say there's anything wrong with them, but the complete lack of action present in the majority tends to turn more adrenalin-driven gamers right off. Myst is one such game. It combines amazing graphical stills with an awful lot of trudging around and the odd bit of item-grabbing to spice things up. This would probably be all right if it weren't for one thing all the clues are in Japanese. Now much as we'd die for Japan's right to use their own language if they want it tends to make adventure games (big on detective work) a bit tough for those not versed in the lingo. But it does look very nice. A No idea what's going on in this picture. No idea at all. A rather pleasant tomb. like neo-Greecian effort looking pensive. VERDICT This is an electronic book which shows video footage of various spooky-looking types. Sadly all the speech is in Japanese. ORIENTAL ILLEGIBILITY WARNING A Pointing at steel frames is all part of the fun. Al honestly can't be bothered thinking of something to write about a log cabin. It is possible to get places in Myst without learning a new tongue, but it's impossible to work out what you've actually got to do. A lot of things seem to have something to do with this electronic dentist's chair thing, which may or may not be a time machine, and... well, you get the idea. If you've got a friend who has the PC version, you could get them to tell you what everything means as you play, but they'd probably find that a bit boring. SATURN If Myst is ever officially released here it should be a title to investigate as the PC version was smashing. The graphics are lovely and it's very atmospheric. Sadly that's about all you can get out of the game, unless you're well versed in Japanese, for that is the language in which all the text (and there's lot) appears. Pretend you're a linguist and have a go of this in the shop by all means, because the graphics are well worth seeing first-hand, but don't part with any cash or you'll be somewhat disappointed to say the least. RAD AUTOMATIC A Blimey, just look at the aceness of those graphics. Look at that rocket thing in the background. Rrrrh! This eerie mist-bound forest is both laden with fog and is somewhat spooky.

Year in, year out it would appear on a field opposite my house, sucking cash from the populace courtesy of giblet burgers and manky rides that are missing the odd screw here and there, and all overseen by some greasy oik riding on the back of the dodgem cars, laden with tattoos and enough gold sovereign rings on his fingers to top up the royal mint. Hence my delight when I got the the chance to play Bullfrog's latest sim Theme Park, now on 300. Following on from previous sims like Syndicate and Populous, Theme Park allows the player to develop their own Alton Towers-style attraction, from the humble beginnings like those seen at my fair to the sort of mega site that would give Disney a restless night if he were still alive. Like Sim City, success at Theme Park comes from keeping the balance sheet steady and the little people happy. Put too much salt in the fries, for example, and you'll sell more drinks, but the visitors won't be happy at having to fork out for the drinks and could well end up being sick on the next ride which in turn will cost cash to clear up. Once the park is up and running and raking in the money it's time to auction it, sell to the highest bidder and then buy a A keep the park in good repair or more expensive and more lucrative park. some little darling will end up injured and the consumer associations will close in and try to shut the park down.

Your only prop is a video camera which allows you to tape meetings, audio conversations or static clues for future evidence to be submitted either to the police or to warn the unfortunate target. VERDICT Shoot to destroy! Leave no survivors! Ahahahaa! VERDICT A Gor, look at that ceiling some caahboy's done that. PC Ooh, Cyberia looks nice. You can say what you like, but Cyberia certainly does look good. Luckily, what you'd like to say is 'Yes, and once you've gotten used to the rather irksome control method, it's quite appealing in a puzzley, arcadey kind of way. Lots of variety and plenty of atmosphere which conspire to keep you playing even when things get frustrating. Which isn't bad. RAD AUTOMATIC PC Ignore the laughably tame and pointless 'erotic' theme and what you have here is actually an OK investigative adventure. The real criticism is that picking up important evidence depends on being in the right place at the right time, something you can only work out through repeated trial-and-error sessions, which makes concurrent games somewhat repetitive. Quite jolly, but not for serious adventure fans. RAD AUTOMATIC What lovely graphics, eh? How very nice. Look at that lovely rippling effect. Just like proper water.

"CVG REVIEW 3DO Shoot-'em-up Electronic Arts .99 Out Now Mega CD and PC CD-ROM versions available No other versions planned BACK TO SCHOOL The first part of the game is spent learning the best ways not to get killed. It's easier getting through intact in the 3DO version though, because the controls are far more responsive. FIRE DAMAGE PILOTS The idea is to avoid those big, round objects that are known universally (ahem) as asteroids. There are no new levels for the 3DO version it would seem, sadly. The Empire's struck back, but it looks like Lucas' Legions have finally come unstuck... ebel Assault, as it was when it debuted on PC, was a remarkable product. It was one of the first playable interactive movies that actually had a movie back. ground. And, of course, it was Star Wars, which is as good a currency as you could possibly ask for in the computer game business. By the time the Mega-CD version appeared, all you could really say about the game was that it would only really appeal to people who liked Star Wars. The gameplay had already dated. Now, after a mere 16 months, it's come down to the level of a decidedly average game. Technically the 3DO is capable of producing more colourful, sharper, smoother graphics than the PC original. Unfortunately it's destined to remain merely 'capable of', as LucasArts has made no attempt to improve the game. Run it next to the PC versions and there isn't any difference. Usually a good conversion of a good game is fine without refinements. But as good as it was, Rebel Assault was always a thin game, and even a Star Wars game needs a bit more these days in the face of such quality titles as Wing Commander 3. Now there's a game 3DO owners should be looking forward to. rebel assau The clarity of the graphics is decidedly dodgy at times, which is a bit poor considering this is the 3DO.

"REVIEW CVG The preliminary training stages are just a case of avoiding rocks and listening to your mates. But the asteroid training is a differ ent matter. This is probably the toughest part of the whole game. When they finally let you use your lasers all you get to shoot are robot spiders. The backdrops are streamed from the CD rather than texture mapped, which would have been far prettier. TIE-DYED A few of the cut-scenes are taken straight from the original Star Wars flick, although they're really grainy as it appears nobody could be bothered using the 3DO's FMV capabilities. Hone your piloting skills in time for Wing Commander 3. 'It's almost like being at the movies', or so says the 3D0 marketing man. SECOND OPINION VERDICT Play 'Spot the R2D2' competition and you can win Sweet FA. Rebel Assault on Mega-CD had god-awful graphics, and certain sections of this game are reminiscent of that lowly version of the game. When all's said and done though, this is Star Wars and that's what made me enjoy the game on the aforementioned format. This game, however, is enjoyable, but the gameplay's looking dated now, and if I was Mr 3DO Punter then I'd probably wait to get my Visa card swiped for Wing Commander 3, rather than this. GARY LORD 3DO Like thousands of other PC owners, this game is the reason why I've now got a CD-ROM installed. I was completely sold by the fact that this is a Star Wars game and I couldn't give a damn how the game played. Luckily for me it turned out to be playable and pretty challenging when set on the right difficulty level. Since then a lot has happened to transform CD-ROM gaming, and Rebel Assault, as pioneering as it was, just isn't that good any more. It'll probably appeal to people who can't wait for their next fix of Star Wars, but that's all.

Despite these drawbacks, the heroes of this scenario, which is set somewhere in space in 2070, are sticking at this bizarre profession. They have been recruited by the top brass at Military Ascertainment Department (MAD) as a last ditch attempt to stop the evil antics of the barking mad ex-mortician and cryongenics experimenter, Moribund Kadaver. This raving nutter has created a race of freaky mutations Psykogenix who have taken over an entire city and are aiming to spread their web of evil even further. You, as one of three characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, are deployed to stop Moribund in his tracks by destroying the Psykogenesis machine which churns out these mutant monstrosities. The six levels are split into different zones each containing its own mission objective and encompass the likes of Mars, Venus and a good deal of sewer foraging. The aim of the game is to traverse the eightway scrolling environment, blasting seven shades out of the masses of mutants which raise their ugly mugs, take on the humungous end-level bosses, break into bonus rooms for extra pick-ups and finally kill Moribund off as horribly as possible. ...Yup, get too close and this wily swamp monster swallows you alive!

The graphics aren't quite as detailed as the Mega Drive version but all the hot gameplay has been packed in there, as have the bizarre foes such as the hyperactive robotic frogs.

This SNES isometric blaster is a real classic and this vesion is arcade perfect. Well worth tracking down. MEGA DRIVE As shoot-'em-ups go, this isn't bad. The graphics aren't anything to wave your pants around for, but the overall feel of the game is moody and atmospheric. There are some nice touches, like the imaginative bosses and hidden rooms and it's a big game with a well pitched difficulty setting. The action is fast and furious, with the control system being initially tricky but once you get the hang of it there's no problem. My main moan is the weapon limitation there are only two to choose from! Apart from that though, it's solid shooting fun.

"CVG REVIEW GAME BOY Sports THQ .99 Out March SNES and Mega Drive versions a No other versions planned FIFA INTERNATIONA Play football, even when it's raining out, with this new conversion. Although you might have to anyway. Depends on your PE teacher. probe Looks rather cool in colour on a Super Game Boy. The worst thing about FIFA is definitely the sound, which is almost nonexistent. USA ootball, they say, is a funny old game. Try telling that to fans of Arsenal a club who, at the time of writing, has just managed 13 weeks without a home win. Bet they're not laughing. Try giggling along with any of the unfortunate cast of those Soccer's Greatest Terrace Violence Moments videos, and see just how humorous they England find it. No, it can certainly be said that football, beautiful game thought it may be, is not funny. And this correspondent is a Crewe Alex fan, so he should know better than most. It is, however, very old, having been invented in 1666 by a peasant kicking the discarded head of King Charles through a prison window (or \"Gaol!\" as was subsequently screeched). As a result, some of the console games inspired by the sport are also rather aged, including this onethe first portable conversion of the EA standard-setter of yesteryear. It's been handled by the conversionmeisters at Probe and boasts every feature from the Mega Drive original, with the exception of action replays. Still can't play Crewe though. Funny that. NNNNDDM This screen gives you a bit of info on the teams before the match starts. nai. SocCER VERDICT probe. A I think you've like, scored. And if you're playing in black and white, Crewe are playing in the dark shirts. FA INTERNATIONAL GAME BOY Despite the obvious flicker caused by having so many sprites on screen at once, FIFA on Game Boy is a graphical triumph. The original's gameplay has survived conversion pretty much intact too, with the same Al routines and all the moves you know and love. The only real difficulty comes in actually getting hold of the ball you have to move your player's feet very precisely, which is sometimes rather tricky. Still, if you're a footy fan and you really want a soccer title for your Game Boy, this is probably the best one on the market. RAD AUTOMATIC KEEP IT TIGHT. MAKE SOME SPACE FIFA is known for having a rather comprehensive strategy elelment, and this is all present and correct on the creamed spinach-vision console.

"REVIEW CVG GAME BOY -MM STE HEMS Serefleks Now remember these guys' morphing tricks from the film, well it's not in the handheld version. I mean what do you expect from 8-bits? GAME GEAR/GAME BOY Puzzle Acclaim Unconfirmed Out March No other versions available Mega Drive, SNES and PC versions planned It's Stargate Jim, but not as we, or anyone else for that matter, knows it. as any one seen that great new action-adventure movie Stargate yet? If so, do you remember that brilliant bit where James Spader, in order to save the universe from the totalitarian rule of Ra, challenges the Egyptian god to a series of games of Welltris? It's truly one of the great scenes of cinema and no mistake. Oh all right, we're lying, but that's the basic premise of the portable versions of Stargate. A series of tiles fall from the top of a well (from where you view the game), each bearing a symbol on either side. Flip the tiles over so the symbol you wish to lay at the bottom of the well is facing up and you're most of the way there. Now all you have to do is line up three tiles of the same symbol on top of each other, whereupon they all disappear. Each star co-ordinate (ie level) has a specific seven-symbol code, and the only way to progress is to collect a set of each of these seven symbols. Repeat to fade. stargate GAME GEAR 0 It's always a good idea to check both sides of each piece before it lands. STARGATE STARGATE RA RA RA! Along with the usual Tetris-inspired one-player game is a oneor two-player battle mode, where players compete for various squares on a star map. Each time you mark off a line annotated on your coordinates (the tiles in the top window) they're added on to your opponent's stack. Whoever's stack reaches the roof first is out. Each victory is marked on the map with a symbol, and squares containing such symbols are off-limits to challengers. However, take two squares on either side of a line of your opponent's symbols and they're all instantly converted to your own symbols! Hurray! VERDICT GAME GEAR/GAME BOY While having absolutely nothing at all to do with the Stargate film, the game ain't all that bad. The real trouble is that both the Game Boy and Game Gear have billions of puzzle games already, most of them like this one based on Tetris. While Stargate has nice graphics it's very slow moving, progress is incredibly random and at the end of the day, it's just not much fun. Ergo it has nothing to separate it from the rest of the pack.

CUG REVIEW PC CD-ROM Adventure Infogrammes .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned It's the last game in the Alone in the Dark series, and it's bigger and better than ever before. But is it scary? etective Edward Carnby is having a bit of a rough time. After battling through a haunted house in Alone 1 and coming to blows with zombie pirates in Alone 2, he's now gone and got himself stuck in a Spooky Wild West ghost town which is packed to the gills with undead cowboys. In this, the third and final game in the Alone in the Dark trilogy, he's been called out to rescue the lovely Emily Hartwood from those whip crackin', tobacco chewin', cattle rustlin' dead folk and they're not going to make it easy for him. Doesn't he just wish he had an easier case like an unfaithful wife to follow or a lost pet to find? Alone 3 is bigger than the previous two games in the series, and this time Edward really has his hands full. Following criticism that the combat was too difficult in Alone 2. Infogrammes has made things a bit easier for our Ed by giving him more health points and bigger weapons. But the puzzles are harder and the zombies are still no pushover, so you're going to have to get that thinking cap wedged firmly on your head for this one. If you haven't played an Alone in the Dark game before, your best bet is to warm yourself up with the first and easiest game of the series. The keyboard-based control system takes some getting used to, and in Alone 3 it seems even more fiddly than before. It's often difficult to get Edward to do exactly what you want him to, and this can be enormously frustrating at times. Even so, this is an excellent game and should keep you chewing your nails into the small hours. To return to human form, Ed has to find a talisman and return it to the shaman. A Those bleedin' zombies have blown the bridge. How's Edward going to escape now? alone in the dark A There's only one way out of Slaughter Gulch, and that's the train. Let's hope there aren't any leaves on the line. Edward gets killed during the game, but is reincarnated as a cougar. The zombies won't recognise him in his new, furry form but don't try attacking them. Guns versus claws? No contest, really. Ed never goes anywhere without his trusty shotgun even at parties.

"REVIEW CVG GAME FOR A LAVA A He's an agile chap, our Ed. Nothing like a bit of pole-vaulting, is there? 1. In this section you have to get Edward to jump from block-to-block without without letting him fall into the lava. Easier said than done. 2. Well, there's the door, but the Indian geezer won't let you past. Turn around and jump the other way... 3. It looks a bit hot under. foot. Jumping on certain blocks makes other blocks raise up or sink down. Get the sequence right. 4. The Indian reappears and gives you a helping hand by teleporting you on to the final block and then to safety SECOND OPINION Ed gets up to all sorts of strange things he even has to make a potion to miniaturise himself. This is a definite improvement on Alone 1, which was great but a bit on the small side, and Alone 2 in which you got killed far too often. It's big, good looking, atmospheric and challenging. The problem is that some of the puzzles are way too obscure and you have to be standing on exactly the right pixel to pick up or move items, and this gives you a real headache. If you haven't played many adventures you may just find that this one's too hard. GARY LORD Yuk! Ed's about to get licked to death if he's not careful. Not pleasant. The Indian shaman will help you defeat the evil cowboy zombies because they desecrated an Indian burial ground. Be nice to him. VERDICT PC CD-ROM Alone 3 isn't as spooky as the original, but it's still packed full of atmosphere. It's good to see a return to a more puzzle-based game after the combat-orientated Alone 2, which was too hard. Alone 3 looks lovely and sounds great with its haunting music and speech. Unfortunately, it's let down by an awkward control system which makes it hard for you to pick up some objects. This can be particularly annoying when you're being chased by a monster.

"CUG REVIEW Mega Drive Arcade adventure Sega Unconfirmed Out March No other versions available No other versions planned You think this is a hackathon arcade adventure about the god of thunder, well you'd be right on one account... here is a saying which runs 'if you want to get ahead, get a hat'. Well, startling new evidence would see that familiar cliché revamped to 'if you want to get ahead, change your name to Ali, buy some baggy kecks and rummage around in caves an awful lot'. It worked for Aladdin (who became, of course, Prince Ali after finding an old lamp) and again for Ali (strangely enough), the hero of this latest title from the people who brought you the Streets of Rage series (which explains Ali's similarity to Axel in close-up), who stumbled upon a magic armlet which controls the elements. Wonder what would've happened if he'd stumbled upon an Uzi and rocket launcher? Doom, probably There's always a token price to pay in these situations, however, and so of course Al now finds himself bound to a suicidal mission against the forces of evil. He has to find and unite the four elemental spirits of the armlet and use them to save the whole wide world, before setting himself up in business with his new-found supernatural powers. What a bummer, eh? Poor lad. Story of thor This ogre chap may look rather hard and he is! The easiest way to deal with more than one enemy at a time is to manoeuvre them onto one side of your good self, allowing you to hack away at all of them at the very same time.» Luckily your enemies can't climb stairs (a bit like the Daleks), so that's one good way to escape. Spawny get! His dad's only the blimmin' king! This is the first boss you face in the game, and if you don't know any special moves he's very, very rock indeed. A That little fire enables you to summon a fire spirit to smash that giant crystal out of your path. ate B EURO G PRINCE ALI... THIS IS YOUR LIFE! This cinematic-esque-style intro tells the true honest it is, it's TRUE story of Ali finding a golden armlet, who then tells a tale about the evil silver armlet (boo hiss whom everyone thought was destroyed in some big barney years ago. But it wasn't. And now some evil bloke's got it. And lucky you, because you've been cho sen to single-handedly storm this bloke's castle and put an end to this dastardliness once and for all.

"REVIEW CVG ELEMENTAL AS ANYTHING ALIALITIES The main advantage bestowed upon Ali by his gold armlet is his command of elemental spirits. Each spirit is activated by firing a magic bolt at an example, of the element you wish to conjure. Once summoned the element has a variety of powers indiginous to their somatic make-up. Each spirit has three attacks, each of which use varying amounts of Spell Power, depending upon the strength of the attack itself. Once your Spell Power bar is utterly depleted your seraphic chum is outta here until time (or power-ups), returns your arcane energies to their former glory. Anle defeated una hostia TOUD whaan attacked this anal hurried to see his teachera Being warrior Prince Ali is a bit tasty, what with all the weapons you find. To illustrate this there are a number of special attacks for each tool our boy picks up. The trouble is that these moves are very secret, so you have to work out the joypad commands for each one yourself. For example, the sequence forward-back-forward-fire provides a handy threehit spinning attack with the dagger, but does naff all with any of the other weapons. Given the hordes of monsters you face as the game progresses it certainly pays to take time out to learn the ropes with your new toys. A So he did. No, really, that's fasciniating. Blimey, who'd have thought it? A Something of a confrontation with an evil-doer here. This sort of thing happens quite frequently in The Story of Thor.

"CVG REVIEW BAGGY TROUSERS, NUR-NUR-NUR-NUR The good thing about the baggy harem pants Ali wears is that they've got loads of room in the pockets. This means our hero can carry a large number of objects at any one time. Most of the objects found in the game are items of food, which replenish either Ali's energy bar or his Spell Power. The other objects are most often weapons, all of which (except his trusty dagger) have only a limited number of charges within them before they brake or run out of ammunition so use the more powerful weapons sparingly. Finally there are a few bric-a-brac objects which are used only in specific situations. So if you're stuck and you think you've tried everything, just pull out that handy staple gun and let rip (NB there are actually no staple guns in Story of Thor). Of the many evil creatures All faces along his travels, the Demon Pontefract Cakes of M'NRanth Mar are the deadliest. A Well, that's a map OK. Yes sir. Locations, other locations. Everything you'd expect from a top-class piece of cartography. VERDICT This is the sort of picture which needs no explanation. Which is a bit of shame, because there's a whacking great caption space here. Anyway, how about \"Thor action ahoy!\"? This scary dragon is one of the biggest and scariest foes you'll face. Watch out for his fiery breath, caused by eating too many Spicy Kebab flavour Doritos. ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE Shining Force 2 Sega Ace RPG with a heavy strategy element and likeable characters. A definite classic, but not as actionpacked as Thor. NOT PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED MEGA DRIVE When we first saw Thor we couldn't help thinking it was a poor man's Zelda, but having played the finished game we realised it is any. thing but. Thor is actually an action-packed isometric hacking death-a-thon, and one of the most original action games to date. Sure, it does take its cue from Shining Force et al, but Thor has much more of an emphasis on arcade skills than the puzzle element. If you liked the concept of Shining Force or Zelda, but couldn't be bothered with the reams of text and suchlike, you can do far worse than giving Thor a spin. RAD AUTOMATIC There's a big difference, thank you oh fat peasant. I'm the blinking prince, you know. SECOND OPINION 81 GRAPHICS 80 SOUND PLAYABILITY 87 VALUE 90 Although, in my opinion, there isn't a console RPG that can touch Zelda on SNES, you've got to hand it to Thor's programmers for having a damn good crack. It's certainly one of the top adventure games for the Mega Drive, being more accessible that the Phantasy Star series, if not quite as playable. I also found it a little easy, but there's a lot in there to discover and it certainly looks like being one of the strongest 16-bit titles Sega has this year. The only fault is that the save points are few and far between, so you're forced to play the game to a certain point at each sitting. But that's just a small flaw in an otherwise excellent game. MARK PATTERSON OVERALL 89 There are quite a few hazards inherent in wandering through evil-infested waters. Wet socks, dissolving fivers, silt in your undercrackers, you know the sort of thing. "


"REVIEW CVG 3DO Sports GTE .99 Out Now ISNES version available No other versions planned Yo homestyle, jam the scoops with this latest basketballee title. Er, kicking... ammit is a game which reveals the devastating affect of American urban decay. Merely a couple of years ago teams of happy inner-city youths gamboled and frisked about on lengthy tarmac basketball courts. This was proved in White Men Can't Jump and other such documents of the age. Now, however, mere braces of players go one-on-one over tiny half-sized courts with only a single basket between them. How a mighty tradition has fallen. Well, that's what the producers of Jammit would have you believe. You take control of one of three players (the fast one, the strong one and the average one as usual) competing in a series of firstto-21-points games. Each of these characters starts the proceedings with $300 in their pockets (or handbag if you're playing as a lady) which they use as capital to bet on their victory. Once a player is out of dough they're also out of the game and so it's then on to the next, harder opponent. Unless of course it's you who's run out of cash, whereupon 'tis Game Over and you're kicked off the court. As you make your way further and further in to the fun the rules get tighter, and things such as double-point hot spots make their collective presence felt. Team-mates, however, remain somewhat thin on the ground. HOOSE A Whoever scored the last point passes the ball back to the second player at the tip-off.

Bet up to the poorest play. er's cash total and bankrupt your opponent. 3DO You can count the number of 3DO basketball games available on one finger, but that's really no excuse for the game that calls itself Jammit. The controls are unresponsive, the players move criminally slowly and there's no strategy element to speak of whatsoever. If this had been two-on-two it would've been miles better. What you end up with, though, is an endless cycle of runscore-run-score with a few dubious steals in-between, (unless the computer decides your steal was actually a foul). Avoid like the wind. RAD AUTOMATIC * $100 $300 Why don't you buy Streetfighter Turbo instead? EXTREMELY BAD CLOSE-UP There's more to scoring baskets than pressing button A and hoping.

Dodgy deals, backhanders, 'incidents' in night clubs, altercations with fans and a few hundred grand on the gee-gees. It's more than just a game. It's football. ears of chomping on 'Gunner' burgers and standing on the freezing original North Bank have given me a total immunity to poisons and a hide like a bull elephant. I couldn't give that up, the same way I can't give football management sims up. One of the criticisms levelled at the previous Premier Manager was that, no matter what your tactics were, the match result was purely down to how good your individual players were. And it didn't even matter who the opposition were you couldn't score more than four goals. These are the areas where Premier Manager in its third incarnation has been improved, and although much of the format remains the same, the improvements are significant enough to make a game which, even if you own any of the previous ones, is well worth bothering with. premier manager 3 SOUTHPORT NEVEY EDMAROS He shoots, he misses!

NISSAN NISSER WHEELER DEALERING Transfers are an integral part of the game. Sometimes you can pick up some real bargains with out-of-contract players, but you get hammered when it comes to signing on fees. The alternative is to sign players on loan; this way you get good quality players for a couple of months and all you have to worry about is picking up their wage bill. liber start PG PC As you might well have guessed, I'm a real sucker for this type of game, what with liking football a bit and all that.

Use the fast-forward but ton to prevent boredom when there's only one lemming left to guide to safety and he's in no danger. Three tribes from Lemmings 2 have made it to the third game. The lemming sprites are larger and cuter than before too. ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE The Lost Vikings Interplay/.99 Similar action here as you have to guide three lost vikings, each with a different ability, around a number of platform-based levels avoiding the hazards in the process. ISSUE 147: 88% VERDICT Lining up to kill themselves once more those loveable lemmings are back for a third instalment... emmings was rejected by numerous software houses until Psygnosis snapped it up way back in 1991. Since then it's gone on to become one of the most successful computer titles ever. Despite All New World of Lemmings also being known as Lemmings 3, there have already been three previous Lemming 'sequels': Christmas Lemmings, Lemmings 2 and Holiday Lemmings. All these titles followed the format of the original, where the tiny and simply drawn lemmings had to be guided from one side of a level to the other, using their individual skills to avoid the traps in the process. So there were builder lemmings to build bridges over chasms, for instance, and blocker lemmings to stop the little ones walking towards death. All New World of Lemmings maintains the same format but the execution is radically different. The lemmings are larger and cuter thanks to a dumpy baby-like look. It's now even more heartbreaking to see them tumble into oblivion. The other major difference is the icon panel where the lemmings are controlled. The myriad of ability icons has gone and in its place is a simple 'use' icon. Now, instead of cycling through the icons, the abilities needed for the lemmings to complete a level are found scattered about the playfield. Once collected, all that needs to be done is to click on the 'use' icon, and then on the lemming that found the ability and away he'll go. Far simpler. AMIGA Lemmings was a stroke of genius but the sequel was a bit of a cash in. I was therefore expecting more of the same here, but All New World of Lemmings is full of originality while maintaining the playability of the previous games. The graphics and sound are still average, especially that wonderfully crap supermarket muzak, but the playability has been enhanced by the easier-tosee lemmings and the much simpler to use icon control panel. Brilliant stuff and it could well start the Lemmings phenomenon once again. RIK SKEWS BREMBO A Use the bridge tool to cross chasms. Blockers no longer have to be nuked to allow others to pass.

PAS PEEN DES RONDSEN It's a difficult decision. articule CONTINUE 2 E PACKAGE Adding an Iron Soldier into its Jaguar armoury Atari hopes to blow away the opposition; it's loaded and aimed but can we find that fire button? Can we hell... JAGUAR here's a lot to be said for square-shaped things, Smiths decided in the early Eighties that we needed to to have our crisps square shaped. Then later in that great decade Tetley did the opposite and decided that the perfectly-OK square tea bag would be better if it was round (as mugs were round). What did I care, I had a teapot. Then games makers went overboard on squares and made polygon-based racers and shoot-'em-ups, from the likes of Red Zone, Urban Strike and the fomidable Virtua Racing Deluxe. The latter is of course on 32x, and Atari hasn't managed to come up with a decent polygon racer on Jaguar as Club Drive and Chequered Flag are testament to: issue 157, both scoring 72%. It's a new issue now though, and Atari has a new square challenger to Sega's 32X Metal Head (page 90) in the guise of Iron Soldier. The idea here is that you take on the role of a huge, metal, android-type affair that the resistance (the good guys) have control of. You must try and stop the subversive Iron Corporation who are trying to take control of the world, or something. To stop the enemy you have to roam around a 3D enviroment disposing of various tanks, helicopters and surface-to-air missiles while completing your mission brief. Weapons and energy supplies are hidden in various intstalllations which can be destroyed with a quick smash of your iron fist. A Destroy buildings and you might find some vital supplies.

VERDICT SECOND OPINION ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE 32X Metal Head Sega/.99 Technically the best looking game to be seen on Sega's latest Mega Drive add ono. Remarkably similar in look and gameplay to Iron Soldier, only better in both areas. THIS ISSUE: PAGE 90 MIDNICHT RALE These big robot games are usually quite a crack, but for some reason Iron Soldier just falls short. It's not a disaster by any means, the missions are well structured and, unlike Metal Head, there's always something on screen to have a pop at. It's just that it's a little dull and repetitive. There are some nice graphic touches too, such as the texture mapping on some objects, but when you compare it to the 32x game, well, that just looks a whole lot better. Software-strapped Jag owners will probably find some solace in this until something else turns up, but if you're not that desperate, then there's no need to rush out and buy this. MARK PATTERSON Things get tricky on the midnight raid, as funnily enough it's in the dark. JAGUAR Iron Soldier isn't a bad game, it is also not a good game. The reason for this is that there's not one element that makes you sit up and say 'wow!', especially as this is on a 64-bit machine. To be fair also some of the graphics are good too, the rotoscoping helicopters for example. But the sum of these parts do not add up to a good game. The control method is far from intuitive, the movement is slow and at times unresponsive, the missions often unclear as to how the objective is to be attained. No cigar I'm afraid Atari.

"CVG REVIEW AMIGA Adventure Vulcan Software .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned It was a case of love at first sight or complete loathing for Vulcan's first Valhalla game, how will its second talkie adventure for the Amiga fare... A Unusually for an intro the graphics are poor and consist of just this one barely animated scene. A There's a host of catchy new quips, but nothing as memorable as 'It's in my pocket! from the original. ith the likes of Time Warner, BMG and all the other big boys muscling in on the software world of late, it seems that the days of one lone programmer beavering away in their dingy bedroom has long gone. Vulcan Software changed all that with their first title, Valhalla and the Lords of Infinity, released mid way through last year. A top-down RPG in the Zelda style, Valhalla was one of the few games which completely divided reviewers, with marks ranging from around 20% to over 90%. One thing that was agreed though, was that the speech was rather smart (although hearing 'It's in my pocket!' once too often led to a number of people losing it completely) and Valhalla became known as the Amiga's first ever speech adventure. Now Vulcan is back with an IndianaJones-stylee Valhalla, Before the War designea as a prequel to the first game. As Infinity's mentor the player has to progress through four sizable levels packed with all manner of creatures, traps and puzzles. There's more speech this time round (about 4Mb worth apparently), an introduction and a very well-organised disk system which prevents any swapping once a level is loaded. But does it play any better, eh? Some books provide useful info, but others only contain the odd clue. Just like the first game, Valhalla consists of lots of small puzzles of the 'oh dear there's a locked door, that means there must be a difficult-to-get-to key nearby' variety VERDICT valhalla AMIGA Before the War proves small teams can't compete with the big boys when it comes to producing adventure games. Even Monkey Island 2, which is now four years old, plops on this game. The graphics here just aren't good enough for this style of game compared to LucasArts et al, although the sound is commendable and it's good to see Vulcan has listened to criticism of the first game and introduced more variety in the dialogue. My main complaint though, is that there isn't enough game on offer, especially for the asking price. RIK SKEWS before the war Using the eye icon will not only make Infinity's mentor look at something, but also initiate a conversation if that something he's starring at is talkative.

EPITH 029 SCAB BOY here's been a rash (ahem) of sequels from EA, but then as the saying goes: 'if it's not broke, make another one', or something. That seems to be EA's way of thinking at least. Now those of you lucky enough to own a 3D0 will no doubt have a version of this motorbike racing game, and this Mega Drive sequel certainly alludes to the Road Rash 3DO, with digitised player screens popping up after each race, and if you get busted by the law a copper (or bobby if you're in Blighty) scrawls you a ticket. The EA drama department has obviously had a lot of fun dressing up extras in the police uniforms of the five coun tries that you race in: Italia, Brazil, Eng-er-land, Germany and Kenya. It's important to remember where in the world you're riding so that you know which way the on-coming traffic is going to hit you. Various obstacles are sent to cross the road to try and test you, zebras, cows, hens, zulu tribesmen et al, and various implements are there to be collected with the view to beating your fellow opponents to a proverbial pulp while police helicopters buzz overhead in a Ridge Racer stylee.

"CVG REVIEW 32X Shoot-'em-up Sega .99 Out April No other version available No other versions planned TEGE DRIVE They're coming! The men in the big metal suits are coming! Aiiieeee! Trapped against the wall, the enemy mech unit is real easy prey. et's face it, if the future ever does see a robotic suit which can be used for military operations, someone in Hollywood is going to make a film about terrorists nicking it and using it for their own evil needs. When concorde came out, they made a film about stereotypical terrorists with big moustaches hijacking it. When bullet trains became big in Japan, a 'terrorist on train' film appeared. And with the Channel Tunnel about to open, apparently Rutger Hauer is to play a terrorist with a 'tache out to blow it up. Well, jumping the boat slightly, Sega's vision of the future incorporates metallic robosuits which have been snatched by terrorists, leaving the player and their suit as Earth's last hope. Boasting the most detailed 3D on the 32X to date, Metal Head drops the player and their suit into the midst of a series of dangerous scenarios. From then on, it's a matter of survival as the player trots along the streets picking off the enemy troops and exchanging fire with the assortment of jeeps, tanks, planes and mechsuits the baddies have nicked along the way. Armed with the standard-issue lasers and missiles, a predetermined number of enemy vehicles must be destroyed before access to the next stage is granted. However, as the game progresses, the enemy forces grow in number and intelligence. It was never like this in Robocop! 2869 SETE AUTO A The later missions add a more strategic element to the action, with the addition of dataretrieval and timed tasks. 233 13 FEEE LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.. Echoing the techniques used in Sega's Virtua series, Metal head allows the player to view the action from one of four positions. The first is through the viewport of the mech unit and details the on-coming bad guys in glorious close-up, while the second is seen from somewhere under the unit's armpits, with the two moving limbs on show. A wider view of the action is offered from a shouldercam, but by far the most useful point for reference is the bird's eye view which displays the unit and the surrounding area from afar. A The distant view allows the player a bet ter look at what's just around the corner. SINGE TO ETU  GAME BY SEGA FOR INFORMATION CONTACT SEGA (0171-373 3000) 90 "

While Metal Head looks incredible, I can't help but feel the gameplay is a little, well, flawed. You're normally only attacked by one thing at a time, which doesn't give you much of a chance to put your robotic skills to the test. Worst of all, when you destroy an enemy it flies apart in a very unconvincing manner. Surely it wouldn't have taken much effort to put in a few explosions. Still, it's good to see a decent 32x game after the Space Harrier and Afterburner debacles. Let's hope Sega can keep putting its new toy to good use.

The game itself is very playable, with a number of varied missions on offer. There are a few problems, though, and these stop Metal Head being a complete classic. The graphics get a little indistinct and cluttered, making the game occasionally confusing to play, and buildings often pop out of no where, complicating matters further.

The enormity of producing a game based on the Discworld is something which really needs putting into perspective. Firstly, you're talking about some of the funniest, and genuinely clever pieces of literature to appear this century. If you think we're exaggerating, just look at the best sellers list for the past decade. Being popular is one thing, but being able to guarantee each book will sell several million in this country really says something. Secondly, there's already been a Discworld game. The Colour Of Magic appeared back in the 8-bit days and wasn't funny. It wasn't that good a game either, which probably explained why Terry Pratchett took a lot of convincing that, yes, another game would be a good idea and that most people who own computers these days are literate. He agreed, acted as grand arbiter of the project, offering plenty of yaying and naying and generally helping to avoid the grand cock-up this could well have been. And the result?

"REVIEW CVG Rincewind The luggage provides the computer world with its first mobile inventory. Or perhaps that should be malevolent entity... The voice talent for the CD-ROM version has been supplied by John Pertwee, Tony Robinson, Kate Robbins and headed by Eric Idle as Rincewind. Together they produce almost every regional dialect this country has to offer, but for some reason, whether he's being Welsh, Maccum, Scottish or Irish, Tony Robinson sounds like, well, Tony Robinson really And verily shall he bellow for th the ter sacred names of the Forbidden dawn, ltis a monk of the dreaded crocodile god offlert Just like in the books, Rincewind is utterly crap at magic. The game's characters all hold the keys to specific problems. The game is staggeringly huge, with three main parts and one huge story. VERDICT s Luggage The subtitles can be switched off, which is just as well as they do get in the way sometimes. SECOND OPINION Old wizards tend to ramble that's when they're not stuffing their faces. PC CD-ROM I hate Terry Pratchett. I've got all his books and I hate the bugger. Nobody should be allowed to write like that. It makes me want to pack up my laptop and head for the States, where they've got no concept of humour so I should do OK. In the mean time, I live with petty consolations such as I'm taller and less bald than him, and that I'll probably appreciate this game more. It really is rather good, and, while this is by no means perfect, it's still an excellent adventure game which fully exploits the vast resources the licence provides. MARK PATTERSON Never having read a Terry Pratchett book in my life, wasn't as instantly drawn to this game as Mark was. However, it doesn't take much to see just how good an adventure game this is. The balance is right. Some problems are relatively easy to solve, while others will have you scratching your head for days. This will appeal to fans of the books more, especially with the number of in-jokes the game features. It's not as mainstream as games such as Sam and Max, which is a good thing in my opinion. It's original, playable and funny. Already one of the highlights of the year. Let's hope there's a sequel on the way.

Side Pocket involves even less physical activity, but probably more brain power and throws players straight in at the deep end. In one player mode you start in Los Angeles with 16 chances to pot six balls. Sometimes the computer dictates which ball or flashes up a particular pocket (for which you get bonuses such as extra points or trick shots later if you get it right). Pot all the balls within the limit and score enough and you're given a specific pot to increase your shot number in the second round. The Trick Game features a series of trick shots which you can complete in any order. It's in this mode that you'll have to work out your angles to the nth degree and calculate exactly the necessary spin or side to apply to the cue ball. Two Player Pocket Game is a five set match and the rules are the same as one-player mode except play continues until the table is clear. In Two Player Nine Ball Game the ultimate aim is to pot the nine ball, but the computer-specified ball must be hit first by the cue ball failure to do so results in a foul and the opposition chooses where the white ball goes on the table. side pocket SIDE POCKET Pot either of the remaining balls into the flashing pocket for a super-go fast bonus.

SNES Being a bit of a pool shark I've usually found pool and snooker sims inadequate mostly because the angles for potting and doubling are completely wrong. This one however, is pretty spot on once you get used to it. The graphics and viewing angle are more than adequate and there's a good range of options (a two-player and a trick shot mode). The difficulty setting is about right making the game challenging but not frustrating, and there is a good dose of bonuses to ease any feeling of sameness. A worthy attempt at a pool sim.

Don't know your gridiron from your waffle iron? Then allow us to educate you... MEGA DRIVE quarterback challenge '95 SNES s any aficionado of Americana can tell you, Quarterback Challenges are all the rage in the States. It means that if you buy a can of soda (which means a fizzy drink over there) and you don't think it tastes as good as your regular brand of soda the manufacturers return you your twenty-five cents. Or so some Yank told me. Quite what this has to do with NFL Quarterback Challenge, which isn't even sponsored by a soft drinks company, we know not. This game centres around the wacky sport of American football, and not cola-war taste tests at all. You're given the opportunity to pick a team and take them to the top of the Superbowl, play a variety of historic games from yesteryear or participate in a series of skill, agility and accuracy tests with a player of your choice. Other than in this final option the game plays much the same as most post-Madden NFL games. The pitch is viewed from three-quarters above the attacking side, before each play you're given three sets of play menus, it's fun, but it's not as though it's anything we haven't seen before. Still, no John Madden in sight. Ahh... SNES SIM WHEN YOU'RE WINNING If you can't be bothered playing through an entire game, pick the Simulation option. This picks one of many real-life match-saving plays from the memory and asks you to put them into practice. As you progress through the simulator these get harder, from relatively simple single-pass last-minute touchdowns to desperate split-second 100 yard runs. A novel feature, and quite an entertaining one especially for atmosphere value. 3 10 18. 35 14:45 00 VERDICT A Choose many plays from this bit, if you can understand them. MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE SNES All the ball-casting pants-wetting excitement of the SNES version has been lovingly recreated on the Mega Drive. Yo, tussle with the muscle. Maaan. SNES/MEGA DRIVE Hot on the heels of no-one at all comes Iguana and its NFL game. Regrettably it seems to have missed the rush for American Footie tities that Electronic Arts triggered, and as such this effort has little going for it that hasn't gone before. The Quarterback Challenge element is mildly diverting for a while, and the historic plays simulation mode is a good idea, but the actual game itself is so average and bland to play it doesn't warrant a second glance. Real fans are far better looking at the John Madden series, however stretched it's becoming. RAD AUTOMATIC SNES IT'S LOOKING REAL GOOD, BOB The Quarterback Challenge of the title (we were only teasing with the soda pop story) is the other original feature of the game. Select any quarterback from the available menu (some have better stats than others, mind) and run them through a series of macho tests: running around assault courses; throwing long passes, aiming even longer passes and being really, really accurate with still longer passes. There's not really much to it but it's an interesting novelty feature for a while.

K, so you sit down and before you even start playing Vortex you just get the feeling that the programmers had indulged in certain recreational activities frowned on in most western countries whilst programming this title. The game's just, well, weird. Really weird. It's a cross between movie, adventure and RPG which, technically is hugely impressive. The gameplay's really freeform. You're left to roam around and explore at will, chatting to any of the people you meet, and generally trying to work out just what the hell is going on.

PC I know a lot of people will hate this game. It's very unconventional and its appeal lies in that you really don't know what's going to happen next. Because it runs under Windows, It's got that nice kind of dip-in, dip-out gameplay which as a nice break when you're working. You will need a speedy PC though (DX2 and above) as the video footage, even in 256 colours doesn't run smoothly on anything less.

VERDICT With wizards, spells and fire-breathing nasties you might Flink this is an RPG, but you'd be wrong... sygnosis' latest, the strangely titled Flink, is from the same team that created the technically excellent Amiga hit Lionheart, and it shows. A graphical treat, Flink relies on some clever programming and the power of the CD32's circuitry rather than endless pre-rendered footage streamed off CD. As Flink the player has to battle against Wicked Wainwright, an evil wizard. Wainwright has captured the four ruling wizards of Flink's home island, Imagica, and banished their spirits into separate crystals, scattering them across the land in order to gain control. Being an apprentice of the wizards Flink sets off to rescue them. Should he find all four crystals then a gateway to Wainwright's lair will open and the final showdown can take place. The game itself takes the form of a standard platformer with all the usual traps and puzzles to be worked through and pick-ups and secret rooms to be discovered. There's a twist though, in the shape of Wiz 'n' Liz-style spell casting. A number of spells are available but they generally fall into two distinct styles: offensive spells like lightning bolts are used to take out enemies, while the others create platforms enabling Flink to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. To create a spell ingredients must be gathered from baddies and then mixed together. Information scrolls around the play area give you clues on how best to mix spells, but it's usually a case of the ole trial and error method. A At various points in the game big guardian types have to be taken out via a few well-placed rocks. Watch out for this quicksand, it blends into the backgrounds very well. Luckily Flink can jump out if he's quick enough. In a flash of inspiration Psygnosis has given Flink the ability to dispense baddies by jumping on their heads. CD32 Flink is beautifully put together with high quality graphics, animation and sound. It reminds me a lot of Ray-man on the Jaguar, but we'll wait to see if that's a good thing. Flink is very pedestrian you see, with little in the way of new ideas or puzzles. Flink ambles along as though he's wearing comfy slippers and there's little to challenge him which results in zero tension. Creating spells breaks up the platform action but unlike Wiz 'n' Liz there's not enough spells or mixing ingredients to sustain interest. Stick with Zool 2.

Not in the Mario league of platform games, but it's pretty entertaining nonetheless. Decent enough ideas abound here, but the implementation makes everything incredibly slow pace. Too often are you made to repeat the same actions over and over. Decent enough plot and puzzles, though. If you've got the patience it could be worthwhile. Top title, but at the end of the day, this is just another Doom clone. However, it does out-do Doom for gore, which is no mean feat. The gameplay has nowhere near the depth of the original blaster, but it's worth a second glance for sure. Just don't expect too much. If you've got an awful lot of time on your hands and an awful lot of strategy experience, you may get something out of this. Otherwise the amazingly slow pace of play and complicated game mechanics make this dull. There are many better titles on the market. Accolade nearly had a decent sports title on its hands here, but sadly the (superior) competition, of which there is a considerable amount, renders it utterly redundant. Nice graphics, responsive teams, but a major lack of depth. Average at best, these days, sadly. UNCONFIRMED .99 .95 .95 EUNCONFIRMED nc snes game boy mega drive pc THE LION KING I COMMANDER BLOOD PINBALL FANTASIES I PINBALL FANTASIES UNECESSARY ROUGHNESS '95 : The sequel to the JeanMichael Jarre-themed Captain Blood. And it's still not that good. The same criticisms levelled at the original still apply here some excellent visuals, but the game seems to be lacking completely. A missed opportunity and a shame. Sequel to the rather nice Pinball Dreams, this is an un-bad simulation of the arcade favourite. Decent ball logic and imaginative tables give it an edge over the prequel, and everything moves at a fair crack to boot. Without doubt one for flipper fans and no mistake. The tiny screen of the Game Boy doesn't lend itself well to pinball games generally, and Pinball Fantasies does suffer because of screen blur and minimalist table layouts. That said, this is one of the more enjoyable examples of the genre. Not brillaint, but not terrible, though. .99 Unnecessary boredom would be closer to the truth. Yet another subMadden title, this time with the worst graphics ever seen and practically zero playability. To cap it all, every player irrespective of tea or position has the number eight on their chest. No, no, no, no, no, Accolade. No. LUNCONFIRMED Poor old PC gamers don't get many good platform games, but this goes a long way to redressing the balance. Whilst rather redundant on console, The Lion King works brilliantly on computer, with flash graphics and slick, addictive gameplay. Won't satisfy sim fans, but should suit everyone else. .99 .99 UNCONFIRMED snes mega drive snes mega cd mega drive MIGHTY MAX MIGHTY MAX I ULTIMATE PARODIUS ESPN BASEBALL DUNGEON MASTER 2 Whilst you can't argue with the brilliance of the actual Mighty Max toys, this game is horrible. Slow, repetitive, frustrating and almost uncontrollable. Too hard for small little players and way too bad for older ones. Don't get this for your kid sibling as they'll hate you forever. .99 If you're one of those mentally diseased people who has a big thing about repeating the same menial tasks over and over again, here's your game. Pick up a rock, take it somewhere, pick up a rock, take it somewhere. Pick up this game, take it back to the shop. If only Nintendo had built the SNES to handle loads of sprites. While this is undoubtedly one of the best coin-ops in existence, some terrible slowdown makes this merely excellent as opposed to incredibly stupendous. That's technical limitations for you. Amazing presentation, featuring real footage and commentary from proper big matches, marks this above the pack. The graphics and gameplay are also both superior for the genre, which should please the baseball fans out there. Easily the best baseball title around. A game with depth, challenge, atmosphere and an awful lot else besides. This should, by rights, have been the RPG of the decade (if not longer). But no they've cocked up the control method! Would have been brilliant with a mouse (and a bit of extra speed). UNCONFIRMED LUNCONFIRMED .99 LUNCONFIRMED 101 "


"CVG REVIEW SNES/Mega Drive Sports Acclaim Unconfirmed Out March No other versions available No other versions planned MEGA DRIVE Has Acclaim done an EA and given us more of the same, or do we really have something different? Well it looks to us like they've done the business... long time ago, when NBA Jam was a new phenomenon, Acclaim held a big party to celebrate the launch of the 16-bit conversions. One of our friends, Osmond Browne who works for Mean Machines Sega, spent the entire night wandering over to complete strangers and saying: \"Don't put butter on your bread, put some Jam on it.\" Unsurprisingly, this utterly failed to catch on and was promptly forgotten by most people. But now Oz, if he tries really hard, has a second chance for advertising glory. nba jam SNES Yes he shoots such hot baskets he is literally on fire, much like he was in the last game. Or not, as the case may be. It's highly doubtful Acclaim would let our friend Oz anywhere near this, its second biggest title next to the mighty morphin' Mortal Kombat. This, the Tournament Edition, features more teams and options than the original, but retains the same fast-moving. high-scoring. net-combusting action of the original. Fans of the coin-op will know what to expect, and if you've never heard of it before, expect something ace. And remember don't put butter on your bread... aah, forget it. BB:6 Those wacky superdunks are back in a big way. SNES MEGA DRIVE The appeal of this game has to be the two player option. MULTICOLOURED SWAP SECTION They say there's no substitute for the real thing. Well, thanks to NBA Jam we'd just like to refute that allega tion. You see NBA Jam, being an official licence, features a number of real-life actual players along with a substitution option accessible during the quarterly breaks. Each player is rated across a number of categories, from speed to 3point throw accuracy along with an injury rating which rises as your player gets knocked about the court (some players are more susceptible to injury than others, as in real life). If you think you need more coverage in a certain area of the court, or your star player is shot to pieces you can RICHARDSON now bring on a third player to replace them. Yeehah. PRESS A.B.X.

"REVIEW Aclaim WHAT'S A HOT SPOT NOT? NBA Jam Tournament Edition features something quite revolutionary in the sports game field (on ho ho) powerup icons. Each flashing bean bestows special powers upon the lucky recipient. Super turbo, extra good stealing, abilities, all are present for your pleasure. And just like the Hot Spots, special randomly appearing instant-score zones, also not featured in the original, are in this version. Don't be soft, of course there's not. Crap gamesplayers fed up with being derided in the street? Can't take any more sand being kicked in your face? Well have we got news for you. NBA Jam Tourney features a prac. tice option, so you can learn the ropes of team work and basket-scoring without having to confront those oh-sotricky computer opponents. In no time you'll be a joypad master and loads of ladies will love you. MEGA DRIVE VERDICT MEGA DRIVE Hit the hot spot. Grab the power-up for extra powering up abilities. SNES VERDICT SNES NBA Jam Tournament Edition resists the usual formula of updating the teams and leaving the gameplay untouched. The addition of hot spots, power-ups and the player selectable juice mode adds variety, and a note of uncertainty to the game. As nice as it is to have all these extras, plus the noticeably faster game. play, If you've already got the first NBA Jam you'd have to be a pretty big fan to shell out for this. All in all, though, this is an excellent piece of software, and certainly better than the original. RAD AUTOMATIC SECOND OPINION MEGA DRIVE I loved NBA Jam first time around, but I just can't get used to the hot spots and icons in this version. They make the game, well, rather silly, and the whole thing's a lot more like Speedball than basketbali. But they can be turned off, which leaves with a slightly improved version of the first game, and the excuse for me to say if you got it first time around, don't bother with this version. If you didn't well, this is big. ger, faster and slicker, plus it's got that Mortal Kombat team in there somewhere, if only I could find it... MARK PATTERSON Now, I'm no great fan of American sports sims meself, gridiron being my least fave in the videogaming stakes. But I do have a real penchant for a bit of NBA Jamming. The first game had real playability, especially in the two player mode. The Tournament Edition has all the fun of the first version of the game, but with the added delights of power-ups and other gameplay enhancing tweaks. A four player option would've been a good idea though. GARY LORD It's one of those cutesy lit. tle Hot Spots. Awww.

"CVG Q&A THE MAN WITH THE CD32 Dear CVG Having just purchased a CD32 I have a couple of questions. HELP! If you're happy with your gaming knowledge then fine. If not, we at CVG offer a friendly counselling service where you can ask questions and tap into the wisdom of the CVG crew. Send those teasers to Help!, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30—32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON, EC1R 3AU. Sorry but we can't reply personally, although those stamps always come in handy... 1 Can you list some of the best CD32 games around? CVG: Sensi Soccer International Edition, Liberation, Chaos Engine, Gunship 2000 and Banshee are probably the best of the bunch. 2 If Commodore goes bankrupt, will CD32 games still be made. CVG: Commodore ceased trading a year ago but as we write (early Jan) the firm has just been bought out by the two of the company's joint managing directors. Games take a long while to develop so there will probably be a slowdown over the next few months or until developers confidence in the machine is restored, and how long that will be is anybody's guess. 3 Will Doom ever be released on CD32? CVG: Because of some horribly technical reason in the way the Amiga handles pixels, a 'proper' version of Doom isn't possible because it would run about as fast as a legless, tortoise on morphine. 4 Will there be a Cannon Fodder 2 for the CD32, CVG: No plans as yet, but then the original wasn't expect ed to be released on CD32 and it has been so who knows what will happen. W Lynch, Sheffield NEXT GENERATION POSERS OOOOO Dear CVG, I have some questions that I hope you can answer. ALIENS 1 Can you tell me how much the Saturn, PlayStation and Ultra 64 cost? CVG: At least  but probably more because they're classed as video players and consequently get slapped with additional EU tax. Nintendo chinny reckon the Ultra 64 will be under  but that seems impossible considering its hardware. The Ultra 64 would cost around ,500- if released now, but perhaps Nintendo will sell for minimal profitlike they do the SNES and make money on software. 2 Is it worth getting a 3D0 with the Sajrn, PlayStation and Ultra 64 coming out later this year? CVG:/It's too early to say. It seems unlikely that the market can support four major consoles and without the major backing of eitijer Sega, Sony or Nintendo the 3DO seems most likely to fail it looks more promising than the Saturn at present though. 3 Does the Saturn play its games off CDs and cartridges? CVG: CDs. The cartridge port will be mainly used for RAM memory cards since it's too expensive to produce huge graphically intensive games on cartridge. With more efficient compression routines that may change though 4 What games are in development for the Ultra 64? CVG: Killer Instinct and Crusin USA, both of which you can sample in the arcades. The home version of Crusin' will be much faster and action packed/though. A Marlo and Zelda game are also believed to be in development. 5 Where will the Ultra 64 be released first? CVG: Japan. Nintendo dominates there and the Japanese seem to lap up anything electronic, especially if it plays games. 6 Why do consoles usually get released in Japan first? CVG: Because of a massive, games-obsessed market. 7 Will the Ultra 64 play its games off CDs or cartridge? CVG: Both, but primarily cartridge. Paul Ellis, Birmingham Dear CVG, 1 Are there any plans to release Aliens vs Predator onfeither PC or Nintendo's VR-32 format? CVG: No, not at present, and currently it's only available on the Jaguar. 2 Will the Alien Trilogy be appearing on either of the above machines? CVG: VR-32 no, but Acolaim is testing the market with the PC version of Mortal Kombat II, Alien Trilogy will appear on PC first, check Connected starting on page 6 for more info. Kier Ashington, London ATARI ANSWERS TITUTE 9999 PAL Dear CVG 1 Is it true that because of a deal between Atari and Sega. Virtua Fighter may appear on the Jaguar? CVG: It wasn't a deal, Atari received a substantial payment because Sega breached a patent. But in answer to your question, yes there's a VF-style Fight For Life on the way. 2 I'm not sure if my Jag is a UK or US model. Are there any differences? CVG: Physically no, but if it's a US model the display will be full screen and have no borders (the UK model does have these). Chances are that if you bought your Jag in a UK store and are using it on a British TV then it isn't a US model. 3 How much will the CD attachment cost? CVG: About  4 Is the Jaguar as powerful as the PlayStation or Saturn? CVG: No. 5 What are the five best Jag games? CVG: Doom (by far the best). Tempest 2000. Syndicate, AVP. The forthcoming Iron Soldier looks smart too. Jeremy Thompson REPLAY 104 "


"Q & A CVG PLAYSTATION PUZZLERS When the PlayStation is finally launched in this country it's going to retail at about -. SONY WILL SATURN KILL THE MEGA DRIVE? Dear CVG 1 Will the Saturn be a direct replacement for the Mega Drive and Mega-CD or will Sega continue to produce them? CVG: Sega will continue to produce the Mega Drive and Mega-CD as long as there's a demand which will be for a very long time yet. The machines and software, though, will become very cheap and an entry level purchase eventually much like the Master System is now. 2 Do you think Sega will ignore the 32x when the Saturn is released in the UK? CVG: No, although the 32X can be seen as a stop gap so that you can have arcade-quality games now. Sega is cer tainly committed to the machine and will no doubt continue to develop for it. 3 is Sega planning to release Daytona USA for the 32X? CVG: No, sadly. 4 Could you recommend any great games for the Mega CD and/or 32X? CVG: Mega-CD: Sonic CD. NHL '94. Sensible Soccer, any. thing by Core except BC Racers. 32X: Doom and Virtua Racing Deluxe. 5 Do you think the Mega-CD is as bad as it's made out to be? CVG: Yes, it's cheaply made and vastly underpowered, and Sega just hasn't put enough cash into games development to make it a worthy purchase. Neal Ferguson, Aberdeen DEAR CVG, 1 How much will the PlayStation cost when it's released in the UK? CVG: ->400. 2 Will the PlayStation be able to be upgraded in the future? CVG: An FMV cart is on the Avay. And the communication port could be used to connect a keyboard and other computer-related bumpf like a VR helmet. 3 Out of the PlayStation and Saturn which will be the best for sports and racing games? CVG: It's too early to say but hardware limita tions means the Saturn version of Daytona will struggle to match the speed of Ridge Racer on the PlayStation. 4 Which other major software companies will be producing for the PlayStation and Saturn? CVG: All the big boys have signed on the dotted line, except Nintendo of course! 5 How much will PlayStation games cost? CVG: They're under  in Japan so around  seems a likely price here, though it could be more since the Yen is very strong at present. 6 Will you be able to plug speakers into a Saturn or PlayStation? CVG: The PlayStation has separate left and right audio ports so yes you could connect one to an amp and speakers. The Japanese Saturn's AV out lead has composite and audio out connections so these could be attached to an amp and speakers too. A UK version is more likely to feature an RF TV lead or Scart socket though, so it remains to be seen how you would get stereo sound out of anything other than a TV or monitor. 7 Will the PlayStation be released in England? CVG: September, though rumours suggest this will be brought forward to around summer time. 8 Will the PlayStation or Saturn have a VR helmet? CVG: Nothing planned as yet but it seems likely. 9 Which has the brightest future: PlayStation or Saturn? CVG: Oh please, dont start this old Mega Drive/SNE$ chestnut again. Seriously though, PlayStation is technically better but Sega is an old hand in the videogame market and has consistently churned out classic video and arcade gandes. The real test of the machines is going to be the kind of software that's available when the machines are launched in this country, and how the machines are marketed. Tom Armstrong, Macclesfield PlayStation Seeing  as Sega cocked up somewhat with the launch and promotion of the Mega-CD, so its going to pull out the stops in promoting and programming for the 32x, probably. AMIGA TEASERS NEW MACHINE DREAMS IS ULTRA 64 A SNES BEATER? Dear CVG. Will the Ultra 64 be worth selling my SNES for? Tom Savage, Belgium Dear CVG 1 From the following list, which machine should I get: Jag, CD-i Saturn, PlayStation, Ultra 64 or the 3DO? CVG: At the moment we'd buy them in the following order: PlayStation, Saturn, 3DO, Jaguar and CD-1. Can't comment on the Ultra 64 as it's not out yet, but we expect it to be close to, if not the top choice. 2 Will there ever be a CD drive for the SNES? CVG: There's been finished prototypes for around two years (designed by Sony no less arf, arf) but it seems increasingly unlikely that it will see the light of day. Shame. 3 What should I buy out of DKC, Pitfall or FX Fighter. CVG: Seeing as FX Fighter isn't finished yet, it has to be Donkey Kong Country. Pitfall is fun, but only in the short term 4 What's the best SNES fighting game? CVG: MK2, nothing comes close. Alex Kyriacou, Herts. CVG: We can't say 'cos we haven't seen it yet! If you're not happy with your SNES, or you are short of cash and are saving up for an Ultra 64 then sell it, the games fetch a very good price second hand. However, if you've got a good collection of games and are not short of cash. keep it. The SNES is a classic console and good for at least another two years at least. Dear CVG. 1 Should I sell my Mega Drive and Mega-CD and get a CD32 drive for the A1200? CVG: No, but selling your Mega-CD and getting a CD32 seems like a good bet. 2 Are there any printers that are good quality but also quite cheap. CVG: Have a look at Panasonic's 24-pin dot-matrix series, they're excellent value for money at around -250, only what's that got to do with games, eh? 3 I've heard that a 14-inch TV fits on top of a 3DO and looks well smart. Is this true? CVG: Do people beat you up in school? 4 All the shops fear me which selLA1200s say that won't have any until Feb '95, what's the deal? CVG: Commodore ceased trading last April and machines haven't been produced since. But Commodore has just been bought, so they should be back in the shops soon March seems a safer bet than February though. Martin French PS Happy new year gaming to you too. 105 "

"CVG COMPETITION hebereke's popoon is a great name for a compo compo BIG EDS Only in CVG do the editors of the top games mags tell you what games they're playing at the mo and what titles to look out for in the future... SC 00009671 do CD C:20. GEBERE Andy McVitie, Editor The NMS team is going Killer Nintendo Magazine System Instinct mad this month which is why there's an eight-page feature on it, including secrets from players who know the machine inside out! When we're not playing Killer Instinct though we're playing our favourite American sports courtesy of NBA Jam TE and NFL Quarterback Club. Steve Merrett, Editor When I'm not tanning all-comers Mean Machines at Konami's International Superstar Soccer (and winning an England shirt for my troubles), most of my time is spent between MKII on the 32X and Virtua Fighter. Apart from that, there's been very little which has impressed me this month, but Victory Goal looks promising. Richard Leadbetter, Editor Well, sorry Steve, but Victory Goal Sega Magazine looks great but doesn't play too well to be honest. What is looking promising is Saturn Panzer Dragoon the beta version I've played is astounding showing off exactly what the Saturn's capable of in the 3D department. Its Japanese launch is March and Daytona follows in April... Well we think so, which is just as well because those Popooncrazy gals and geezers at Sunsoft have only gone and inundated us with heb-erreckie (that's the phonetic spelling, right) goodies. EREK Now we've decided to keep most of them for ourselves, 'cos we're like that, but we're going to make five of you rather happy by giving you a copy of the game Hebereke's Popoon. For the out-oftouch readers who don't know what we're talking about, let us digress... Hebereke's Popoon is a Tetris-style game, only it's far, far superior, more enjoy able and has a totally excellent two player mode the special attacks will have you screaming with gaming delight. Believe us. If you want to know more then check out the full review in issue 157 (FX Fighter on the cover) of CVG. Of course we're not just giving the games away, you're going to have to answer a quessie first, and when you've done that simply send your entry to Popoon that CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU by March 15. Five lucky readers win a copy of the game while 20 not-so-luckybut-luckier-than-the-readers-who-are-gettingsod-all will receive some Hebereke goodies which will impress, we assure you. Alan Dykes, Editor Doom was the gaming phenomeCU Amiga non of '94, but the Amiga was all but left behind: 'You can't get that sort of speed and texture-mapping from an Amiga', the pundits claimed. Well this year will see them proved wrong. Alien Breed 3D is on its way this summer and it looks hot. DOOOOOCC Andy Nuttall, Editor 1995 will be the year of the The One for Amiga Games Worms! As the Amiga's critics are performing last rites on the machine, Team 17 announces its best game yet. It's simple, it's fun, it's infuriatingly addictive, and you can read all about it in The One! And lots of other great stuff, obv. David Upchurch, Editor It's not all Doom and gloom in PC Games the PC Games office, not now that we've been playing Heretic from ID Software. It's basically the Doom game engine but with a fantasy setting, great power-ups (check out the time and chicken bombs) and an altogether more fun gaming experience than Hell on Earth. And your question is... Christina Erskine, Editor That huge computer fest, the CES PC Review in Las Vegas, turned out to be low key for PC games. However, there are a few things to look out for. Top Gun, from MicroProse, is a neat blend of video-based cut scenes and flight sim action, and LucasArts' Full Throttle is shaping up very nicely too. 1. Hebereke is a well known Japanese cartoon character, but where the hell is Nova Scotia? Them there rules Anyone can enter (apart from employees of Emap Images, Sunsoft and Marubeni). All entries must be in before March 15. No cash alternative will be offered and the editor's decision is final. Mark Patterson, Editor The beauty of being a Computer and Video Games multiformat magazine is that we get to play all the new machines' games, and Toshinden has impressed virtually everyone who's come into the office. We can't discount the Saturn though, with games like Shinobi X, and come April we're going to get very excited about a certain Daytona racing game. Watch this space. 112 "
