"A REALLYS After three long years of waiting, Nintendo has finally released their 16 bit Super Famicom. With all the rumours flying around that this would be the console to end all consoles, Robert Swan took a good, hard look at what could really be the future of computer entertainment... LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING DUD 0'31 SELECT START SUPER Famicom Nintendo Or rather, the lack of it. The first thing you really notice about the Famicom is its size, a sleek compact grey unit measuring 200mm x 240mm x 60mm, with a cartridge slot, a power switch, a cartridge eject button, and a reset switch. At the heart of the beast lies a 16 bit processor, with a number of other video and audio chips (the latter using both digital and PCM sound). The graphics chip provides a maximum resolution of 2048x256 pixels and can display 32,768 colours! Other details are limited at the moment, due to the fact that Nintendo are a little hesitant to give their secrets away, but we know for a fact that there are several hardware chips in there to do special things like rotate the screen and flip and zoom sprites. The controls pads are quite innovative, too, with four coloured fire buttons on the pads surface, but as well as that, there are \"left\" and \"right\" steering buttons on the top of the pad! These are very comfortable to hold, and although the usual \"finger cramp' sets in after a while, it doesn't hit too hard, and doesn't cause too much discomfort. YOU CAN'T KEEP A GOOD PLUMBER DOWN... That Mario bloke's back again this time in Super Mario World. If you thought the other three Mario adventures were good, you'd better prepare yourself this one smashes all three into oblivion! Taking a similar style of play, SM4 contains the most amazing graphics the amount of colour and the minute detailing on the sprites is just stunning (take a look at the pics if you don't believe us)! The visual gags are still there "


"muiya O TIME : eeeee in abundance at certain stages, Mario or Luigi can climb on a dinosaur, which likes to eat nasties, then spit them out as fireballs! The sound is just as exquisite, with jolly bouncy tunes, the most fantastic sampled piano we've ever heard, and the echo of every sound when you're underground! And the most incredible thing about it all, is that SM4 actually comes free with the machine! GAMES ON THE WAY... The only other game available at the moment is F-Zero, a hell-for-leather 3D road racing game, which places you at the controls of a nippy airskimmer. Audio-visually, there's nothing to touch this on any machine at the moment, ou and it's as playable as heck, too! To come in the not-too-distant future, there's Super Ghouls and Ghosts (a rezzed-up version of the Capcom coin-op), R-Type II (which looks particularly flashy). Gradius III, Final Fight, Bombuzal and Populous (yep, it had to get in there somewhere). If the first two games are anything to go by, these others should be little short of spectacular when they finally arrive. charged  cost price. After Christmas, when more stocks become available they hope to be able to bring the price down to about . Traditionally, Nintendo release their machines in Japan first, then America, and only when the machines are wellestablished there are they launched in Europe. The Super Famicom's US release date is to be late in '91, so the day we Brits are able to pop into Dixons and pick up an official machine looks to be a long way off. HOW MUCH??!! THE VERDICT In Japan the Super Famicom sells at the equivalent of just over , but some grey importers will be selling it for between -400 mark-a hefty mark-up you may think, and almost as bad as the Neo Geo (though at least the games will be cheaper between about  and ). Importers say that the reason for the vast price tag is the fact that Japanese stocks sold out almost instantaneously, and units are in such short supply that they are being Okay, so there's been a long wait for the Super Famicom, but now it's really here, and the verdict is that it's definitely been worth the wait it's simply the best home entertainment machine we've seen yet. If this new console gets even half of the support the NES received, this could be the console of the future. Keep reading C+VG for upto-the-minute news and reviews as soon as the new games appear, you'll be the first to know about them. "

"EXPRESS YOURSELF There's a new handheld in town a cool, mean stranger called the Turbo Express, and this little baby could well be the one to clean up in the handheld war blowing away both the Lynx and Game Gear. Why? Well, mention the fact that the Turbo Express is completely compatible with the vast range of PC Engine cards available, and you've got to admit that it's already got a head start... TURBO POWER The Turbo Express is basically an American PC Engine (the Turbo Grafx 16) squeezed into a case roughly 180mm x 100mm x 45mm. There's a three-inch colour LCD screen mounted at the top of the case, and a speaker and a stereo headphone jack built-in to give the player the full benefit of its six channel sound chip. Inside the Turbo Express is a customised 6502 processor running at 7MHz (that's about seven times faster than the Commodore 64GS games console), backed up by impressive custom graphics chips. Anyone who has seen an ordinary PC Engine in action will know that this combination of computing hardware is capable of great things. EXPRESS RELEASE? NEC have postponed all plans to release the PC Engine and it's related hardware in Europe, at least for the foreseeable future, but Austrian firm, Digital Entertainment, have signed up the rights to market Turbo Grafx gear in Europe, including the Turbo Express. The equipment they plan to release is converted US systems so don't expect to able to run imported Japanese gear on it. Digital Entertainment expect to release the Turbo Express by the first quarter of next year TURBOVISION TURBO CHARGE One of the most important features of any portable console must be the screen. The Turbo Express' display measures just over three inches across, but since all of the games it runs were designed for use on a normal TV or monitor, there is a strong danger that sprites and text would be indistinct on such a tiny screen. We tested out the machine with Dungeon Explorer and the results weren't very impressive. Although text can be read with effort, if you are going to be using the Turbo Express for any length of time, it's more than likely that you'll soon be suffering from severe eye strain. The screen also has an annoying tendency to blur at the most inopportune times and the effects are definitely felt in scrolling games such as Tennis. In the USA, NEC are selling the Turbo Express for $249, but if an imported model makes it to our shores, expect to pay well over three hundred sovs. When you can get a technically superior (and official) Alari Lynx in Dixons for  the Turbo Express seems sig. nificantly over-priced. THE VERDICT EXPRESS EXTRAS TURBO COMPATIBILITY Lynx was a bit of a downer. you find Just like the Lynx and the Gameboy, the Turbo Express has the ability to link up with another machine. The Com Link, as it's known, enables two Turbo Express owners to link up and enjoy simultaneous two player games. There's also an optional TV tuner that can be attached to the Turbo Express to make it into a fully portable colour television if you live in the US. The American tuner is especially designed to work only with American NTSC television systems and is therefore useless in most European countries. The version of the console we tested was the American Turbo Express model, and just like the US Turbo Grafx 16, the system is completely incompatible with the Japanese PC Engine system. However, a Japanese version of the console (which is compatible with imported Engine gear) is going to be released very soon in Japan, and it will be this version that the importers will bring into the country. Unfortunately, the NEC Turbo Express isn't quite the handheld miracle we were hoping for, mainly because of the rather awkward screen. Also, if you though that the battery life of the Atari Lynx was a bit of a downer, you'll find that the Turbo Express is no better. Six AA size batteries are needed to power the beast, and they only last for three hours, maximum. The massive range of software available now makes the Turbo Express initially very alluring. However, at this price, you'd be far better off buying a spanking new Megadrive for use at home, and keep the left-over change for a nice Gameboy for your portable gaming enjoyment. 11. "


"GAME BOY TETRIS IN THE DARK! Here's something for all you GameBoy owners to splash your Christmas moolah onan illuminating device which lets you play your GameBoy in the dark! The two units displayed here are the Game Light and the Light Boy which are available at .00 and .00 respectively from PC Engine Supplies (0782 712759). For his extra 15 quid, the Light Boy owner gets a flipdown lens which clips over the GameBoy screen and magnifies it by 1.4 times not vast but still something of an improvement, especially with the light on. The Game Light is also an effective add-on, but it comes without the lens, and whereas the Light Boy uses only two AA batteries, this one takes four. It's also a bit of a fingernail buster when it comes to attaching and detaching it to the Game Boy. PC Engine Supplies are also stocking up on two types of GameBoy carrying case (a hard and soft one), as well as carrying cases for Mastersystems and Megadrives!

As always, a ton-fifty of software for any totally outstanding tips. FORMATS BADLANDS A tip here straight from J Thomas of Milton Keynes. When you're racing against the other opponents, try not to beat them by too high a margin, otherwise they'll be a lot faster on the next race! Also, although it's tempting, try to buy tyres as well as turbos and speed otherwise your Badlands racer is pretty pathetic at handling corners!

To make it appear you must get the rainbow jewels IN ORDER from left to rightl Sounds pretty tough huh? Well, you can choose which colour jewel you want. Simply crash a rainbow on a meanie in order to make it fly off and die. The screen is divided from left to right into seven invisible vertical strips and where the meanie lands determines what colour it'll be. For example, far left is orange, far right is purple and the middle is green. So now you know! In the secret rooms you'll find permanent powerups, like extra rainbow power that even stay with you after you die!

"TALE GREMUN The second of C+VG's softco challenges saw madcap staff writer Rob \"The Mouth\" Swan, along with another of our brave challengers, toddle off to Sheffield, home of Gremlin Graphics, responsible for such gob-smacking wonders as Lotus Esprit Turbo SE Challenge and Toyota Celica GT4 Rally (reviewed this very ish!). A miserable November morn saw Our Rob waiting for Our Richard at London's fashionable St. Pancras Station, but when Rich failed to show (the divvy had gone to King's Cross by mistake), Rob had to make the journey alone! the second fastest player would get eight. Whoever came in third place would get six points and the slowest time would cull four points. In keeping with world-renowned tournament conventions, the winner would be the player with the most points at the end of the challenge. Once these details had been typed up by the official Challenge typist, and all the competitors had signed it in their own blood, the starting pistol was fired and the players got ready to rock and roll GAME ONE LOTUS ESPRIT CHALLENGE A From left to right: Gremin's lan Richardson, our own Rob Swan, Tony the Tester and Challenger, Johnny Lee Adkin. THE CHALLENGERS ROUND ONE Another of our readers, handpicked by the C+VG panel, was NO S already waiting at the Gremlin offices when Rob arrived. He was Johnny Lee Adkin, son of Wakefield, West Yorks, and joystick jockey extraordinaire. Johnny owns an Amiga and a Spectrum and had impressed the judges with his astounding scores on Microprose Soccer and Emlyn Hughes Footy. Fighting on Gremlin's side were their PR Supremo and Lotus expert, lan Richardson, with Tony the Top Tester in support (Games testers in The Challenge? Is this fair? Ed). And last, and by all means least, there was El Robbo, rather disheveled after his long a lonely journey and feeling lan and Johnny were first up, and took their places at the rather apprehensive at the enormous task before him! How Lotus coin-ops displayed at the CES show in September. little did he realise how enormous that task was to be... Johnny got off to a pretty good start (considering it was the first time he had played the game), but was smashed to the back by some very sneaky driving by lan, who used his intimate knowledge of the game to shoot to victory in a time of 1:47.3, beating Johnny who brought it home in 2:15.4. Next were Tony (who had the benefit of over 1000 hours of game-testing experience on Lotus) and Rob (who had After some initial confusion (Rob got locked in the toilet), the been too lazy to bother practising at all!). Tony made it all rules were agreed. The Challenge was to consist of two look rather easy, racing in with a time of 1:49.5, but alas poor rounds of Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge followed by two Robbo got completely lost, and ended up smashing into rounds of the super-new Toyota Celica GT Rally. The fastest every obstacle in sight. Finishing time a comparatively dislap time in each round would earn the driver ten points, and mal 2 minutes 13.5 seconds! THAT SCORING 44 "


"CHALLENGE al. wn Johnny was first up, and had a few problems, but manROUND TWO aged to finish in a time of 3:04. Rob was next, and after a lot The sound of the dinner bell elicited a sign of relief from the of confusion on how to start the car (\"yes, Rob, press fire, let beleaguered Rob, who was in desperate need of nourish go, push up, press fire again agggh!\"), the noisy one manment to fuel his afternoon's efforts. The brave gladiators aged to crawl round in a depressing time of 3:59! mulled over life and Lotus strategies while munching on the lan, who had taken rallying lessons from Toyota team flavoursome Marks and Sparks tuck provided by the Gremlin driver, David Llewellyn, took the stick, and showed everyone womenfolk, but once the picnic plates had been cleared how it should be done, scorching around the track in 1:20. away, it was straight back into the action. But you should have seen his face when Tony took over and With one win under his belt, lan was feeling pretty smug blazed to glory in a mere 1:13! as he stepped up to the joystick. Rob, on the other hand, had already witnessed his opponent's prowess on several occaROUND TWO: ENGLAND sions and he was feeling more than a mite apprehensive. With confidence on his side, lan raced back to take the points This is where the fun began it was obvious that Rob was yet again with a time of 1:58.2, while Rob did his \"slug with going to have more than a few problems here, so lan and corns\" impression, and limped home in 2 minutes 13.8 secTony took full advantage, screaming round in 1:12 and 1:13 onds. respectively. Johnny took the wheel, and after an unfortunate Tony and Johnny were next to burn rubber, and Tony's false start (costing the poor lad a colossal three minute penhours of experience got him across the finish line first, with a alty!), managed to finish in 5:38. Rob, trying to improve on his time of 2:04.0. It was quite close, though, because Johnny, in previous scores, failed miserably and finished in 3:13 (lose spite of having problems with his car's steering, came in at again and you're fired Ed). 2.10.5. So, once again, lan took the glory, with Tony in second, Johnny in third, and Rob following behind to clear up the mess. After a small error, lan put the difficulty level onto \"flippin' hard\", by choosing the Finland route with added snow, evenl Johnny took the course in 7:35, after having a few problems with the car spinning out en route, which was made even more obvious with Rob's time of 7:09 (that's it, you're fired Ed). Even Tony and lan had difficulties Tony even crashed, a unique occasion which amused Rob no end and came in with times of 3:15 and 5:29 respectively. ROUND THREE: FINLAND GAME TWO TOYOTA CELICA GT4 RALLY ATOYOTE ROUND 4: MEXICO The final round saw the route taking place amongst the sandblown deserts of Mexico, something which caused great concern as it reduced visibility considerably. Undaunted by this, Rob (mad fool that he is) took control, and proceeded to make a complete hash of things by completing the course in 2:46. lan proved his worth by finishing in 2:17, Johnny had a few spin-outs and stalled several times, to finish in 4:35, by again Tony took the points by finishing in a gob-smacking 1:43! 00 38 oor ROUND ONE: ENGLAND As lan booted up the Amiga version of Toyota, Tony was happy in the knowledge that he'd play-tested the thing to death, Johnny was happy in the knowledge that he'd got enough practice in, and Rob was in deep trouble at the time he'd never even played the game! 45 "


"THE GREMLIN CHALLENG LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE OLD SCOREBOARD.. THE OLD SCOREBOARD So, the battle was over, but who had won? Well, it obviously wasn't Rob, but our hero summoned what little brainpower he had left, and calculated that at the bottom of the table came the unfortunate Johnny with 18 points, the metal maniac himself with a meagre 22 points, lan with 34 points, and Tony with a colossal 38 points! LOTUS CHALLENGE IAN ROB ROUND 1 POINTS 1:47.3 ROUND 2 2:13.3 POINTS 2:13.8 JOHNNY TON 10 2:15.3 1:58.2 10 2:10.5 1:49 2:04 THE PRESENTATION 1:13 TOYOTA RALLY ROUND 1 POINTS 1:20 ROUND 2 POINTS 1:12 ROUND 3 POINTS 5:29 ROUND 4 POINTS TOTAL 1:13 10 At this point, enter Gremlin's Top Man, Ian Stewart, who announced that he was the boss, so lan, Tony and Rob were all disqualified (much to all three's amazement, especially Tony, who was looking forward to another prizel), leaving Johnny the champion! As a reward, Johnny was on the receiving end of a spanking-new Megadrive, something that was completely unexpected (the exact words were \"oh, er, ah, I didn't expect that!\" see, told you!). So, the challenge was over, and Johnny returned to Wakefield a happy chapple, whilst the rest of the challengers were left to weep into their by-now rather solid saries. 2:17 : 3:15 10 1:43 34 CONSOLE SUPPLIES TEL: 081 597 0500 FAX: 081 598 1791 31.90 MEGADRIVE PAL+GAME 155.00 PC ENGINE PAL + GAME 150.00 MEGADRIVE SCART+GAME 155.00 PC ENGINE SCART + GAME 150.00 WORLD CUP SOCCER 31.90 VIGILANTE 22.90 GOLF SUPER MASTERS 31.90 FINAL LAP TWIN 25.90 CYBERBALL 31.90 ORDER YOUR FAMICOM NOW PARANOIA WHIP RUSH 31.90 NEO-GEO + JOYSTICK BLOODY WOLF 355.00 GOLF 185.00 RASTAN SAGA II 31.90 TIGER HELI MAGICIAN LORD 185.00 NINJA COMBAT 185.00 TATSUJIN 31.90 NEW ZEALAND STORY NM 1975 185.00 CYBERLIP 185.00 SHINOBI 32.90 LAST BATTLE 31.90 BASEBALL STARS 185.00 SUPER SPY 185.00 POWER DRIFT 32.90 FORGOTTEN WORLDS 31.90 NINTENDO GAMEBOY 69.95 BLUE BLINK 32.90 PHELIOS 31.90 TETRIS 22.90 SIDE ARMS 32.90 GOLDEN AXE 31.90 CASTLEVANIA 23.90 TIGER ROAD 32.90 SHITEN MYOOH 31.90 NEMISIS 23.90 SPACE INVADERS 32.90 SUPER HANG ON 31.90 BASEBALL 23.90 KLAX 32.90 SUPER SHINOBI 31.90 TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES 23.90 AFTERBURNER 32.90 GHOSTBUSTERS 32.90 BATMAN 23.90 FORMATION SOCCER 32.90 LEGENDARY AXE II 32.90 SUPER MARIO LAND BATMAN 32.90 RASTAN SAGA II BUGS BUNNY INSECTOR X 32.90 32.90 POWER LEAGUE IN AXES FZ SKATE OR DIE 32.90 FINAL LEGEND SPLATTER HOUSE ESWAT 32.90 WWF WRESTLING LOAD RUNNER POPULUS 32.90 SPIDERMAN DEVIL CRASHI THUNDERFORCE IN 32.90 IMAGE FIGHT PAPERBOY FATMAN 32.90 NINJA SPIRITS DOUBLE DRAGON HELLFIRE 32.90 BEACH VOLLEYBALL 32.90 BOXING ATOMIC ROBO KID 32.90 NFL FOOTBALL SUPER FOOLISHMAN 32.90 BUDOKAN FINAL BLASTER 33.90 32.90 SOCCER BOY SUPER STAR SOLDIER 32.90 DYNAMITE DUKE 33.90 LAST BATTLE DOWNLOAD 32.90 ARROW FLASH 33.90 BATTLE PING PONG DON DOKO DON 32.90 SUPER MONACO GP 33.90 BOMBER BOY 23.90 DIE HARD 32.90 RINGSIDE ANGELS 33.90 GHOULS AND GHOSTS 23.90 GOMALA SPEED 32.90 RAINBOW ISLAND EXTRA 33.90 BASEBALL KIDS 23.90 XEVIOUS 32.90 XDR FUNNY FIELD 23.90 33.90 RABID LEPUS 32.90 MOTOR CROSS MANIACS 23.90 BATMAN 32.90 SHADOW BLASTERS 33.90 SOLAR STRIKE 23.90 CYBERCORE 32.90 GAIN GROUND 33.90 GATORS REVENGE 23.90 CHASE HO 32.90 STRIDER 37.90 ALLEYWAY 23.90 PC KID 32.90 ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW...ORDER NOW 88888888 888     888888 BARCLATCARD ALL PRICES INCLUDE VAT + DELIVERY 13 SPENCER ROAD, ILFORD, ESSEX. 1638PW MAIL ORDER ONLY "


"BUT THAT'S NOT HU No, siree, not by a long chalk. In the light of his defeat (cynics might use the term \"a right pasting'), Rob knew that certain redundancy awaited him when he returned to the office the next day. In an attempt to reinforce any credibility he had as a journalist, and possibly save him from certain execution at the hands of his comrades, he waited till the prize-giving was in full swing then slunk into the Gremlin Secret Games That No-one Else Is Supposed To Know About Room, whipped out his Man From Uncle secret agent's camera and took some cheeky snaps of the Amiga version of one of Gremlin's big games for 1991, namely... # 11 FOO oo TONY 1:49.5 2:04.0 000000 000000 SWITCHBLADE 2 1:13 O . If you thought the first Switchblade was a bit tasty, wait until you see this! Although essentially similar to the original in style of play, this looks like it's going to be one cracker of a game. Following on from where the original left off, Switchblade 2 again puts you in control of Hiro, last of the Bladeknights, who is out to defeat the forces of evil and restore freedom to his homeland. But how is part two different from part one? Well, the character is about twice the size of the original, and is much more athletic: he can leap, fight and use all manner of weaponry, ranging from your bare fists, blades, shuriken, and even an enormous laser cannon which unleashes a blast of earth-shattering proportions! Even at this early stage, the sheer amount of detail put into the game is little short of stunning, with the beautifully detailed sprites storming around a full-screen playfield at a great rate of knots. If this turns out to be as playable as the first, then Gremlin will surely have a smash on their hands when Switchblade 2 is unleashed in the first quarter of 19911 NEXT MONTH! And now, live from London (fanfarel), It's the Kick Off 2 Challenge! Well, it will be in a month's time, so if you reckon you're the greatest player in the land, fill in the challenge form at once (on page 150), and send it in plenty quick, marked \"KICK OFF CHALLENGER'I But be warned Rob plays Kick Off better than he plays Lotus! 47 "

"a ST SLOTE BY ARENAI PLAYES HER AB E em IMAGEWORKS It's been two years since the Ilast Speedball match was played, when the original Speedball League was disbanded. This nearly caused riots amongst the millions of fans world-wide, but now, it's back bigger, better, faster, and, probably most importantly, a hell of a lot more violent! But what's this got to do with you? Well, your task is to turn Brutal Deluxe (probably the worst team ever in Speedball history) into champions! The best way to start is to train them in the gym, but this all costs money and lots of it! So to get the money, more games have to be won! Easy eh? Don't you believe it... The pitch is now twice as big as the original, and, like the original, contains all man ner of tokens, tricks and traps with which you can defeat the other team. Three new additions to the pitch layout are the score multiplier (which knocks up the number of points scored for each goal), and the starwall every time a star is lit. two points are added to your score until they're all flashing when an extra 10 points are awarded! The third is the electrobounce unit hitting the ball against this gives the ball A Meet the score-multiplier, on the far left. MENTER 833 2a2a aaaa 00820 GAN MEET THE TEAM Brutal Deluxe is made up of 12 players a goalie, two defenders, three midfielders, three attackers, and three substitutes. If one of your team gets banged up pretty badly, he or she can be substituted for one of the players on the bench! If your players are pretty naff, like the goalie at top left, they can be put on the transfer market, where better players can be bought but usually for an extortionate price! 56 "

To speed up the gameplay you can simply spend money on say, the whole team's aggression capabilities. More careful managers, though, are likely to develop their players one by one, catering for individual needs.

"EVIEW C+VG MIIIIIII UPDATE Speedball ll will be hurtling onto the Amiga any day now, for the same price of .99, but featuring full screen graphics, and improved sound. A PC version is also due, but for which graphics modes, we can't say. No news as yet on versions on any other machines, but as they say, watch the skies. SPEEDBALL HII IIIIIIIIIIII The ball shoots into the air as the second half begins! HALF TIME SCORE END CHANGE .99 Speedball has to rank as one of the top games ever, and to beat it, the Bitmaps have had to put in a hell of a lot of work. They've listened to all the criticisms (few though they were) of the original, and have come out with a product which is destined to go down as one of the best games ever to grace the ST. Right from the inItial Intro sequence, the entire thing simply oozes a class and quality that is rarely found in a lot of games. Dan Malone's graphics are nothing short of spectacular, with brilliantly animated sprites and metallic backdrops, and the sound is a treat to the ears, with thumps, groans, cheers and the clang of the ball rebounding off the walls! The playability holds it all together, of course, and it generates a sort of addictive power that it's almost impossible to put the joystick down once you start playing. Overall, a totally brilliant sequel, and a magnificent game in its own right. To put it bluntly, if you don't get this immediately, you must be completely round the A TOKEN BONUS Like the original, Speedball Ilhas all manner of tokens which can be used to do all manner of things to both you and the opposing team!

If any of that makes sense to you, you must be a fan of American football, with its complex rules and bulging shoulder pads. After a successful playing career, John Madden is now one of America's top commentators, and his game includes all the teams of the NFL and AFL leagues.

Each match is made up of a series of offensive and defensive plays chosen via menus displaying diagrams of where principal players will be running to. Once both players have selected their strategies, the action starts with the offense's quarterback collecting the ball then passing it running off with it or booting it forward depending on the play selected. If you're on offense, you control whoever is holding the ball, but the defending player can switch to whoever is closest to the ball so he can get in a tackle. The defending team's overall task is to stop the of fense from making the required 10 yards.

"DEVIEW WIIIIIIII JOHN MADDEN'S AMERICAN FOOTBALL DRE **** HOT ALL THE RIGHT A Los Angeles talk tactics... MOVES Just like the real thing! To succeed in this game, it's crucial to have a grasp of the offensive and defensive moves available. When it comes to choosing plays, both sides huddle up and the menus at the top of the screen scroll left and right to reveal the different defensive and offensive moves available. If you're on offense and want to play a pass, use men with good catching ability or the ball will bounce right out of their hands. Likewise, when HOT trying a running play, choose players who are fast on their feet, or the other team will bring the running back to the floor before he's made any distance. The defense's best tactic is to try to work out his opponent's most logical move, hope he's logical enough to use it then select a play TECENTAGE which blocks his progress or perhaps even allows an interception which will turn the game around.

On top of that, the game is packed little extras further help to set this apart from other console sports sims; the dances done by the player making the touchdown, for example!

Now, six years later, Rainbow Arts have resurrected this classic for 16 bit owners. The result Masterblazer! The basic idea is a one-onone sport, each player (be they either human or computer) takes control of a Rotofoil, a nippy vehicle designed for turning at right-angles in a split second. The playing field is a huge chequered court, with two pairs of mobile goalbeams traversing each end of the field, with each player fighting for possession of the A terrifying face-to-face confrontation... ball a sphere of plasma energy. To win each game you have to score more goals than your opponent by blasting the ball between his goalbeams. An additional form of competition (which wasn't featured in Ballblazer) is a Rotofoil race along slalom courses. PAUSEOA It's great to see some old 8 bit classics being jazzed up and transferred to the 16 bits, and Ballblazer is just as playable now (as Masterblazer) as it ever was, if not more so. The speed and reactions of the Rotofoils make the game play very fast indeed, and the 3D graphics reflect this the checkerboard even anti-aliases to make the edges of the squares look smoother. The original Ballblazer music remains intact, as well as a whole stack of new tunes all of which are stunning. As a oneplayer game, the whole thing can be a bit overwhelming, as the computer blasts goals in left, right and centre, but it's still enjoyable, nonetheless. In two player mode, the game really stands out as a super-competitive exercise for the adrenal glands. New options such as the race and the knockout tournament, as well as extras like the demo and Rotofoil blueprint screen, complete the package perfectly, making Masterblazer as much of a classic as the original. Put it on your Christmas list or live to regret it!

Graphically and sonically, Death Trap is certainly a very nice game, with little touches here and there (especially the tiny \"Strip Poker\" women on the stats panell), and everything is colourful and well animated, and the gameplay is okay, but nothing out standing jump around, hack a few monsters into bloody gobbets, cast a few spells, and Bob's your auntie's live-in lover. The problem lies in the level of difficulty it's too damned hard to get off the first level without using most of your credits up! There's certainly nothing here that hasn't been done before it's a platform game with added frilly bits, so to be frank, Death Trap is something that you should give severe consideration to before purchase.

Apart from the slightly smaller screen and the tinny sound effects, there's hardly anything between this and the Megadrive version it's that good! This game offers everything a homicidal lunatic could ever want, so obviously it's been a big hit here in the C+VG offices! The animation of the sprites is unbelievably good: the figures, move, fight and walk in exactly the same way as the original, and the superb backgrounds add a great deal of atmosphere and excitement. It's one of the best two-player games around, and my only hesitation is over its lastability; it's not hard to complete, and after that, interest in the game will wane dramatically.

SEGA .95 When I first played Sega ESWAT a couple of months back I was quite impressed. The Sega hasn't really got many decent games of this ilk available for it and this effort seemed to fit the bill quite nicely. However, the graphics are surprisingly weak, sporting colours which give new meaning to the word \"garish\", and the sound consists of awful tunes and halfbaked effects. ESWAT's playability is its major asset, and bringing felons to justice with the aid of massive Robocop-style armour and weaponry is good fun and addictive too. Sadly, the enjoyment is short-lived because the game is far too simple to complete, especially when it's set on the easiest skill level. What's needed are some are some extra levels and baddies on higher difficulty levels, that way there'd be an incentive to play the game after you've completed the easy version. ESWAT is a decent enough game, but I'd recommended it to less accomplished gamers, because veterans will have seen all there is to see long before they've had their 's worth.

Your journey through Hyperspace is disturbed by an alien perpetrator, PC .99 Lightspeed is a very complex Elite-type game combining both strategy and arcade elements. The depth of gameplay is immense and visiting different star systems and making them suitable for colonisation is a very involving task. For example, I managed to find one alien race's secret base and formed a pact to destroy their enemies in order to make the system safe for my colonists. The varied rewards for completing secret missions also serve to make the game more compelling. Graphically, the 3D polygon graphics serve their purpose but aren't overly special and the sound is much the same. There's loads to keep you occupied in Lightspeed, with a huge amount of strategy fun to keep you busy, but it lacks the instant attraction and playability of the classic Elite.

"ADVERTISEMENT 66 Just what a game should be: looks good, 99 sounds good, and plays like a dream. Chris Morley, ACE, October 1990 By Graftgold RATED ACE RATED 936 INNLER 936 The 30 vector graphics system in Simulera features solid filled 30 graphics with shadows and light Intensity surfaces. The system allows solld and wireframe surfaces to be freely mixed. Stipple and transparent/semitransparent surfaces are also employed. The game code runs up to 252 non player objects on the map. The game cycle rate and the view cycle are Independent so that game time can be kept more or less constant even if the display rate is slowed down. Special explosion effects are achieved using a highly efficient particle controller that Individually moves up to 100 particles. Definitely a game that goes with a bang! Simulcra uses a grid-based map similar to Virus but includes 'blank'squares, introducing ground-based and flight action To add variety to an already exciting game, Microstyle have thrown in a wide variety of enemies. First, and most common, are the laser turrets that slowly sweep in a complete circle until they lock onto you, whereupon they fire viciously. Various ground and air attack craft, such as jeeps and small tanks, race around the walkways, thankfully needing only one shot to kill. Then you reach the megatanks these can only be killed with missiles, but when shot explode in the most satisfactory way yet. by first ojecting the gun turret and then collapsing in on themselves with a terrific sound effect. Throughout the game you also have access to a map screen for strategic planning and there's also a neat power-up that gives you short range mapping/radar facilities while you're moving. MICROSTYLE hurl you into the computer war of the future and produce a red hot 3D shoot-em-up as an incentive... Simulcra is verging on the awesome, conjuring up immediate comparisons with the classic Virus. Your SRV rotates 360 degrees and can fly or drive. The rotation and shading are excellent and the game has a great feeling of speed. Battle is fast and furious and you can power up the SRV with loads of goodies including speedups, radar, fire and forget missiles, target display systems, shields, and extra lives. Cyberscape rules in the far future, where even war is played out inside massive computer simulators.

(Lucky you didn't, then Ed) Anyway, I did gress Indiana Jones is indeed back once more, this time on the Sega Master Sys tem, and this time it's a conversion of the US Gold arcade game that appeared on computer during the summer of last year.

Why? It's too flippin' tough! Trying to get off the first level is hard enough, let alone attempting the rest of the game! The graphics and sound are both really good, with Indy leaping, punching and whipping around, and the backdrops are very fancy, indeed.

"EVIEW PC ENGINE VIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIII PC ENGINE .00 47700 SCORE A Serious destructive mayhem with Rabid Lepus. RABID LEPUS or some strange reason, lost in the timeless void that is called Space, a bunch of incredibly ruthless alien types have begun a systematic destruction of anything looking vaguely like a rabbit (?!). In a fit of maniacal ruthlessness they have tracked down the bunny capital of the cosmos and now plan to de stroy it. One rabbit who isn't particularly chuffed by the mass carnage of his race is Rabid Lepus. Cursed from youth with a particularly tragic name he decides to earn the respect of his race by saving the planet. In a desperate bid to save his kinfolk from the jaws of annihilation, he decides to grab his trusty electro-shield, mega-death laser and a bag of homing missiles. For close range destructive power, he's also packed his amazing bunny boxing gloves and he can use these to rabbit punch any cocky aliens who get too close... Rabid Lepus must fly into the enemy's horizontally scrolling territories blasting as many of the aliens as is possible. A lot of canisters can be found on the way to the end of the level, and each have a different effect on our bunny saviour. Some provide him with extra rounds of homing missiles whilst others give extra energy and even a spell of invincibility! BY VIDEO SYSTEM Under the vaguely amusing rabbit scenario lies a very straightforward horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, which is fine if you're into that sort of thing. However, there's a huge avalanche of this type of game available on the Engine including the likes of R-Type, and although Rabid Lepus is good, it's nowhere near as addictive as the amaz. ing Irem arcade conversion. The graphics are great with smooth scrolling and great sprites and the sound is okay with arcade-like tunes and effects. The gameplay though, is very jaded and the range of weaponry available to Rabid Lepus is quite limited. The attack waves hold no surprises and the end-of-level bosses are pretty uninspiring. If you're a hard core shoot 'em up junkie in need a challenge, then Rabid Lepus is great-just don't expect anything mindbendingly original, that's all.

There are 26 espionage masterminds to be brought to justice, all of whom have an entourage of agents, couriers, organisers and experts to aid their causes.

Each letter in the encrypted message represents a real letter throughout the message, and on the easiest level one letter is revealed to get things started.

IIIIIIIIIIII PC .99 I was a big fan of Sid Meier's last game, Rallroad Tycoon, because somehow this guy always seems to be able to design games with a new and interesting approach to an unusual subject, and Covert Action is no different. The four subgames are a very satisfying mixture of strategy, puzzle and action gameplay, and the way they've been worked into the overall investigation has been cunningly devised. The limitations of the program do show through when you've been playing a while and notice that the same faces and street names seem to crop up in different investigations, only with different names and in different towns. But I'm happy to let that pass because it doesn't significantly affect the atmosphere, which actually gives you a taste of what it's like to live on the edge. Covert Action is pricey, but if the usual array of PC flight sims and adventures don't interest you, this is one game you will play and play way past bedtime.

"LATEST LYNX Now Atari have started getting official Lynx software on the shelves we thought it was about time we started reviewing some of it. And so, resident Lynx owner, Julian Rignall claimed a load of the latest stuff, took it back to his Southend pied-a-terre and returned with these reviews, but for some strange reason the cartridges were never to be seen again... hmmm. MS PACMAN DacMan's trouble an-strife hits the Lynx in this simple, but addictive maze game which hit big in the ar. cades nearly eight years ago.

But fear not, for there KATCH ..CANNON SEE ROAD BLASTERS KLAX VA fow! Lynx Klax is an abV solute replica of the original coin-op, with prefect graphics and even more perfect speech! It's a strange sort of arcade puzzle game in which tiles of different colours roll down the screen on a conveyor belt and you've got to pick them up and drop them into a bin at the bottom of the screen in an attempt to make \"klaxes\" lines of three similarly-coloured tiles, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally If a complete line is made, rest of the tiles fall downwards. If you fail to reach a set number of klaxes before the bin fills up with tiles it's game over. The game also ends if you let three tiles drop off the edge of the conveyor belt. If you think that sounds dull, think again. The game is simple, but very, very addictive indeed. It's got a variety of starting options, and there's much to discover it's possible to score 260,000 on one drop (but we're not telling you how)! Highly recommended it's the best Lynx game yet!

"EXMAN 000000 EBS Sre 25 Have you been reading your copies of C+VG thoroughly, ever ready to pick up every last bit of trivia essential to your continued existence as a games junkie? Or are you a bit of a thickie, who only reads the mag \"for the reviews\"? Now, thanks to a set of extremely cunning questions thought up by the C+VG brainboxes (in collaboration with government scientists) you can find out just how much you know about games... If anything... Gamesters who know their Flying Sharks from 3.

" THE ANSWERS Check out how well you did on our little quiz by matching up your efforts to the answers listed here. No cheating, mind! SECTION ONE 1. a 2. c 3. a 4. a 5.b 6.b 7.c 8. C 9.C 10. a (as the actress said to the bishop). 66-75: You're a bit of a brainbox, or a bit of a cheater. Genuine scores of this level are met with much respect and admiration (sort of). 76-94: Crikey helll Do you know your games or what? Well done! But remember computer games aren't everything. There's a whole world literally brimming with adventure and excitement out there, and it's not necessarily on your computer screen! 95: An exceptional score that shows that when it comes to computer games, you certainly know your stuff. Unfortunately, everyone hates a smart ass (or a liar) and that definitely goes for you too. 95+: Obviously your brain cell cannot cope too well with simple addition, let alone the probing and exciting questions of this questionnaire. Lock yourself in a cellar and eat the key for the benefit of modern civilisation. SECTION TWO 1. Five, one 2. Super Monaco GP 3. James Pond, 90% 4. Joe Mushashi 5. Paradroid '90 6. PC 7. True remember the MSX? 8. Chaos Strikes Back 9. SCI Special Criminal Investigation 10. Shadow Warriors SECTION THREE 1. 1985 2. Hunchback 3. Bally Midway 4. Combat 5. Donkey Kong, four 6. Four, the Assembly Line actually programmed Xenon 2! 7. Mastertronic 8. Zaxxon 9. Six (16K and 48K Spectrums, Spectrum +, the 128K and the Plus 2 and 3) 10. Five (a VCS game, a Scott Adams adventure, Entertainment International's Dr Doom's Revenge, Gameboy SpiderMan and El again with their new Spidey game. A Megadrive game should be appearing next year!). ANNOU .ASVE OS Blind ION. SHI-OMI NOILOSS HOW WELL DID YOU DO? Below 1: Oh dear! You'd have to be a real Neighbours fanatic (or something equally brain-dead) to do this badly. Our advice is to watch the show just once a day (if you're a hopeless addict) and spend the rest of the time reading and rereading C+VG you know it makes sense. 1-10: My word! Well, the eyes may be open and the larynx may be capable of some kind of speech, but it seems pretty clear that you're a drooling vegetable, barely aware of the outside world and the cosmic significance of computer gamesplaying. 11-20: A contemptible performance. Our advice is to donate what may remain of your brain to medical science, so perhaps we can stop any more individuals suffering from your particular mental disorder. 21-30: A pathetic effort. Do you actually read C+VG or do you just look at the pretty pictures? Must do better, or else. 31-40: A tepid attempt at answering a relatively straightforward set of questions. The technical term for people like you is \"a bit of a thickie\". 41-50: A pretty creditable attempt at the questionnaire, and continued purchase of C+VG should help bump that 45 up to a 85. 51-65: A damn fine effort at answering the questions and shows that you really know your gamesplaying.

"848-68 pas 167 6720 55905 LAP 7 REVIEW VIIIIIIIIII SUPER MONACO GP US GOLD It streaked through arcades across the globe wowing any gamester who dared play it. The latest in Sega's long line of mega 3D driving games took the player to the street circuit of Monaco the scene of the greatest video formula one race of all time! US Gold have enlisted Probe software (the guys behind the acclaimed Turbo OutRun and SCI conversions) to come up with the goods, and by the looks of it, they've done wonders! The game puts you behind the wheel of one of three formula one racers. The beginners' motor has an automatic gearbox and is quite easy to handle but isn't the fastest car on the circuit. The four-speed gearbox machine is the next progression and whilst faster, it's a bit more difficult to control. The seven-speed gearbox is only recommended to arcade Nigel Mansells who can take every one of Monaco's twists and turns with ease. Then it's on to the qualifying race, where you race across a section of the Monaco track aiming to get as high a position as possible on the starting grid. During the actual three lap race, there are no time limits you just need to stay among the front runners in order to stay in the race. If you do well then it's off to a second race, where rain beats down on the Monaco circuit making the car even more difficult to control. The Megadrive version went down well with the C+VC crew because of the extra circuits they crammed into the cart, along with a whole season's worth of racing. You could even drive a better car by challenging a superior team's driver and beating him during the season. US Gold even have plans to add this into their home conversions! We've had a butcher's at Amiga, ST, C64 and Amstrad versions of the game and to say that we were impressed is something of an understatement! The 16bit versions look amazing with a speedy car and fast, smooth graphics. All of the brilliant presentation screens of the coin-op have been included, and Probe's artists have actually improved on them! 8-bitsters aren't being left out either. The C64 version we had a look at was simply amazing with a very nippy turn of speed and the Amstrad version also holds a lot of promise. Check out the multi-format preview shots dotted around the page! We're going to be reviewing the finished game exclusively in our March issue, so stay with C+VG for the first word on the hottest games!

"POS REVIEW LEVES BADOS M.U.S.H.A. SEGA Yet another shoot 'em up is about to explode onto the Megadrive, but this one's a little bit on the tasty side! As is the norm with these, the scenario's a bit naff suffice to say, you are a transforming robot, with tremendous firepower, and your task is to fly through myriad alien-infested levels, and blow the little suc kers to oblivion! Some of the weapons are quite stunning especially the twin lightning cannons on full power, which is al most equivalent to invincibility! Phewee! Could this possibly be the best blaster on the Megadrive to date? Check out the next issue of C+VG, when we'll be bring ing you the full exclusive review on this little baby then you'll find out if the gameplay matches the rather juicy visuals! Thanks to PC Engine Supplies of Stoke who supplied us with a MUSHA cartridge. RELEASE: MEGADRIVE, JAN PRICE: .99 "

The gameplay is remarkably simple. A number of chips have been placed around a four way scrolling maze and you have to guide your little character around picking up all the chips and then making an escape. The problem is that the maze is full of obstacles including ice, locked doors and water. Luckily there's plenty of keys to open the doors and bridges that can be pushed over the water. We've already had a peak at seventeen levels of the game on the Amiga and we were rather impressed. Keep your peepers at the ready, because C+VG are going to be reviewing Chips Challenge next month!

"REVIEW IIIIMIII DUCK TALES DISNEYSOFT Disneysoft are just putting the finishing touches to their first arcade/strategy game, Duck Tales. Featuring the penny-pinching Scrooge McDuck and his lovely nephews, Huey, Lewy and Dewy, the aim is simple. Scrooge is on the lookout for yet more wonga to add to his collection and decides to nip around the world, picking up money at the same time. With plenty of different game styles and gorgeous graphics, Duck Tales should be something of a hit. Paul saw a pre-production copy during a recent trip to Paris and his only gripe was a slight lack of speed. Still, hopefully this should be rectified by the time Duck Tales is released in the New Year. RELEASE: AMIGA, JANUARY, OTHER FORMATS TO FOLLOW.

According to our sources, the Mickey Mouse game promises to be a very colourful, very addictive, cutesy-type platform game. From what we've seen it promises to be a great laff and should be available next month. Check out the full review in a following issue of C+VG. RELEASE: MEGADRIVE, DECEMBER PRICE: IMPORT ONLY . 99 MIG-29 DOMARK Not to be confused with the awful Codemasters budget game, Domark's MiG game is a accurate 3D sim based on the hottest Soviet fighter in service today. Domark have managed to get hold of information from TASS (the soviet news agency) in order to come up with one of the most realistic sims to date. Featuring five fun-filled missions, super-fast 3D graphics, and a stirring soundtrack from ace maestro Matt Furniss, MiG-29 is shaping up quite nicely and should be hitting the streets in the New Year. If the price tag seems a tad excessive then have no fear, because included in the package is a brilliant MiG book with all the info on the Soviet wonder and a colossal great manual as well!

Oh well, if you were part of the thronging masses who were pretty annoyed to discover that the NES Turtles game wasn't a conversion of the brill arcade machine, then take heart. We've just got wind that the fabbo beat 'em up coin-op is being reprogrammed for the NES and if you don't believe us, then check out these screen shots! The conversion promises to be a faithful copy of the coin-op with all of the enemies and levels present. However, it'll be absolutely ages before the finished game appears on British soil it hasn't even been released in Japan yet! RELEASE: NINTENDO, TBA.
