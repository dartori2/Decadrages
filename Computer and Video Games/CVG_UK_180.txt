Hopefully you appreciate that we go for the best screenshots, and always aim to provide useful, and entertaining, text. side, which makes us answerable to all of you too.

"MOUNTER CVG BIRTHDAY SHOUT PART 1 ven though none of the current CVG team have performed active duty on the magazine for much of its lifespan (this month is Paul and Jaime's 1st anniversary, in fact), we still feel proud to be part of its incredible 15th birthday! More so, because we remember reading the mag as kids. Being disorganised buttheads though, we haven't managed to sort out all & VIDEO our birthday plans into this issue. So we've spread it over three months instead. Here we start with a light GAMES look at CVG's past. If there's anything you particularly want to see in the next two issues, write and tell us! WE ARE TAMPERIING WITH THE SCORES! NOVEMBER 1981 75p COMPUTER MAGAZINE FIRST FUN THE Ever since we changed our ratings system from percentages to the High Five system back in issue #174, we've received both praise and flak in equal portions. However, for those stick-in-the-muds who reckon it's an outrage that we've tampered with the time-honoured scoring system, we're about to prove that it has NEVER stayed the same. CVG has always adapted to best suit the gaming market. And we will again when we reckon we need to. You have to excuse mags that say percentages are the best method of reviewing they've never known anything else! COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES THE JOYSTICK JURY THE HIT! SPACE INVADERS! TAROT Games and Programs for Pet, Apple, Tandy, Sinclair, Nascom, Vic, plus many more Back in 1983, CVG rated games out of... joysticks! At such a primitive stage in the evolution of games, we didn't even mark graphics and sound. Hmmm, I wonder what Q-Bert got for Theme... We're not exactly sure when it happened, but by 1986 the CVG HIT had arrivedl, together with a Game of the Month medal. Four universal ratings Graphics, Sound, Value and Playability also accompanied them. und Action Graphics Addiction Theme SOLVE THIS AMAZING PUZZLE AND WIN A VIC COMPUTER CHRISTMAS TOYS Avoid the 5-day wonders PLUS CHESS & OTHELLO ADD GRAPHICS AND SOUND LEARN PROGRAMMING and much, much more della REACHING OUR VERDICT ENTER... PLAYABILITY GRAPHICS Graphically great or do the graphics grate these marks put you in the picture and let you know if all things are sprite and beautiful. SOUND Is the sound loud and proud and crystal clear? Or does the noise from your micro sound as though you've got your head stuck in a bucket of mud? VALUE Is the game really worth an arm or a leg to buy. Should you beg, borrow but never steal to get the cash to buy this game and be the envy of all your friends? Or should you wait until the game turns up in the bargain basement after just one week on sale. PLAYABILITY Will you have to be dragged screaming from the joystick after 24 hours of continuous play and still be anxious for more. Or will you give up after a few minutes? WIN YOUR OWN | ARCADE GAME THE COVER STORY! By 1984 our reviews had already changed. Now each category was marked out of ten. with Graphics and Playability making an appearance. Most important of all though. what did Boog-A-Boo score in the Getting Started stakes? BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION Every month, we torture ourselves over how our covers look. And, even if we say so ourselves, we think CVG's covers are better now than they ve ever been. If you don't believe us. just take a look at some of the more 'classic cover moments m our history. And believe us when we say. these covers were just picked out of our archives at random! C+VG HIT! SREE! FLEXI-OESC INSIDE Sentences awarded by this court are as follows.  Action: This refers to how much you have to do. How many screens are there, how many challenges, characters, and generally how much is going on. Graphics: How pretty is the game.  Addiction: Perhaps the most important category of all. How long will the game hold your interest. Will you be able to put your joystick down. Theme: This is the combination of storyline, action, graphics. Does the game live up to the scene setting blurb on the box. The maximum five joysticks will rarely be awarded by the jury as it is our belief that the truly excellent game is a very infrequent occurrence. Three sticks is an average score for games of reasonable quality but not in the opinion of the jury worth reaching for the wallet. In order to be worthy of handing over cash for games must score at least four sticks in at least two categorys. Two sticks deserve imprisonment. One stick gets a life sentence and games which score no sticks at all will cause the judge to don his black hat and order the manufacturers to be taken from this court and hung by the neck until dead. Don't miss this if you've any sense This is C+VG's way of telling you this game is the BUSINESS. MPUTER CVG MODORE other chariots and to try to push your opponents into the walls of the arena and crush them under the horses's hooves. The graphics are good and shame many of the games on the Vic's big brother the '64. I can recommend Chariot Race to anyone well good Vic games are few and far between.

"MEGA-DRIVE SPAWN OF CVG!  OFF MACHINES Although we take no credit for it ourselves, the fact is, CVG has quite a CHOVAS Y CHIOSTS heritage surrounding it. A heritage that most of the current CVG team first experienced as readers of the magazine. Or should we say magazines. You see, CVG is the direct father of most of the top videogames magazines that you probably see on the shelves. Way back in 1989, CVG started up a new section to cover the fast-growing interest in consoles. Such was the interest in this section, that Mean Mean Machines, when it was merely a Machines became a magazine in its section of CVG. Look at it. Awesome! own right! In fact, within a year it was the best-selling magazine of its kind! Enter the Golden Age of the Console Boom. From Mean Machines we saw Nintendo Magazine System and Sega Magazine launched. All using the tried and trusted CVG formula to incredible success.And now the latest baby in the family Mean Machines PlayStation has been launched. Seek it out! THE BUMPER JANUARY ISSUE OF CVG. WHICH INCLUDES THE 50+ PAGE BOOK \"THE CVG HISTORY OF COMPUTER GAMES\" As it's our Birthday. we're rewarding our loyal readers with a real bargain opportunity by giving the owner of this month's and next month's CVG a total of  off the stunning January issue of Computer and Video games!! PERCENTAGES By 1990, percentages were well and truly part of the CVG reviewing system. But even though this marking system endured for years, its structure changed dramatically to keep it as practical as possible.  Veteran CVGsters MEGADRIVE may rememGRAPHICS ber these SOUNDS panels. They had their PLAYABUL time and place. But no more. OVERALL 86 MMMMM AMIGA .99 I wasn't really very Inpressed when I first cas my critical eye over Gram mainly because I couldn't control the Rippin' thing! Jual when it seemed I was getting a good turn of speed out of my truely Toyota it suddenly seemed to career off the road at the frat bend! However, unike GremNo's laat racer, Lolus, Toyota is more of a simoprising that it take longer to get into.

That was Sega's bold promise at their press conference, held at the plush BAFTA Theatre in Piccadilly Circus during the Autumn ECTS.

"MY EYES ARE BLIND! MY EARS ARE DEAF! computer video games BAG better than Tekken 2. FV features light sourcing and Gouraud shading, as well as 3D barriers surrounding the characters. Tekken 2 doesn't. So who are Capcom trying to fool? They could take a leaf out of Takara's books and use SGL. With this Takara produced Toshinden URA, a superior version to the PlayStation. I could be imagining things here but in your interview with Capcom I'm sure you also felt that they were giving the Saturn bad publicity. So you being the considerate souls you are tried to make Saturn readers smile by defending its 2D capabilities by asking whether Cyberbots was possible on the PS. Admittedly I believed that PS could handle a conversion, but Capcom's hostile reply of 'just because we don't plan to develop for PS doesn't necessarily mean that it's too difficult' shows some sort of biased attitude to their preferred machine. Well if I was right, thank you for trying to defend the Saturn and please all your readers. That is the sort of attitude which proves CVG is not only the best mag but also unbiased. A. Tachittiro, London STAR LETTER IS THAT A BATTERY TESTER IN YOUR POCKET? Dear CVG, I have been playing games for about eight years, and have been reading your mag for about five years. I think your mag is great, and you always have news on the new releases. But there is one thing which I think you could improve, it is the new rating system which you use for your reviews. I don't think the High Five method really helps when it comes to choosing a game. For example in your last issue four games got a High Five rating, but which is the best? This is the downfall of your rating. Another example is when a great game comes out on a number of formats. They may all get a High Five but the rating doesn't tell you which version of the game is worth getting. I have got a PlayStation, a Saturn, and a PC. So when it comes to choosing games it's good to see the review as a percent rating so that I can compare the different formats and buy the best version. One suggestion is to show both the High Five rating and a percentage rating, this way it would make it a lot easier to choose a game. Anyway keep up the good work, as your mag is still by far the best out there. By the way, what computer did you run Quake on for your review? I have a Pentium 100 with 32 Mb of RAM and a SVGA monitor and it doesn't look any way near as good as the pictures in your review. Ryan Murray (no address) Dear CVG, Having read your interview with that 'has been company Capcom, or is it 'Crapcom | have lost all respect for the company whose games I used to love. Their comments about the Saturn's inability to cope with games such as Resident Evil, and the laughable 'Star Gladiators' demonstrates the company's poor programming skills. Surely being an established company they know what they're talking about, but I can't help felling that they want to take the easy way out. by programming 3D titles for the PS only. Everyone knows that PS is easier to programme for 3D, due to its top quality raw polygon power. However they are demeaning the Saturn by making such comments. Core's Tomb Raider is a far more ambitious project in comparison to Resident Evil. Core's head stated in an interview to Edge that they believe the Saturn to be more powerful that PS once all hidden tools are opened. That is of course debatable, but my point is that they haven't written any machine off for their potentially superior title. NIGHTS on Saturn also demonstrates the Saturn's ability to produce quality environments in 3D. The second point by Capcom muddled my mind even more so! They claimed that the disap pointing Star Gladiator would be impossible on the Saturn. Firstly who wants the second-rate beat 'em up, but again I fail to see how it would be impossible, the game doesn't look better than Tekken 2, the Saturn translation of VF2 and the new Fighting Vipers in my opinion look TEAM: We appreciate your worries, but we are confident that Capcom know exactly what they're doing. The Saturn cannot produce the special effects required to bolster Star Gladiator's appeal, and the PlayStation's difficulties with 2D games is down to a slightly limited internal RAM hence the loss of animation frames and some detail. In 3D polygon games this isn't a problem. BTW we weren't trying to sway the interview one way or the other with our questions. That would have been pretty appaling! *USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES NO PAL OF MINE Having owned UK PAL versions of the SNES and PlayStation I'm quite miffed at the PAL borders we have to put up with. So I'm contemplating bringing back a US Saturn next time I go to the States. Now my query is that I'm not too sure about what I'll need to make the system work back home in the UK. Am I right in thinking I'll need a power converter and different TV leads? And will I still get borders? And lastly, is there a converter to play UK games on the US machine? Hope you can help me out... Tinhead, Merseyside START PAUL: Here's why we dropped percentage ratings, for those of you who still think the human brain is capable of identifying the difference of a couple of percents. The score 91%. This means \"this game is very good. But don't blame us if you don't like it, because it didn't get 93% or 95%. And anyway, we are trying to keep the publisher off our case. MEGADRIVE And when you have a poor GRAPHICS game, it's completely laughable to believe anyone gives a SOUNDS damn whether it's a 28% or PLAYABILITY 38% travesty the game's just LASTABILITY not worth bothering with! Our rating system is all about recommendation for games across all systems. If there are notable differences between versions we point them out, even though it encourages letters of complaint from people who think we are saying that their version is inferior. But we will endeavour to be even more precise and concise in our writing without boring normal people witless. 91 OVERALL 94 TEAM: Yes, you need to get a power converter, and you'll definitely need an RGB cable unless your telly is NTSC compatible. Once you're set up you'll be able to play loads of cool games full screen, full speed. You probably won't want to buy a UK game again as most titles are released Stateside soon after Japan. The only thing you need to worry about is the ABOMINABLE artwork on American Saturn boxes. It really is the worst stuff we've ever seen. TREET FIGHTERT   0 SELT ED: We were running Quake on a Pentium 90 with 16Mb RAM, and did our screen shots at a high resolution. The machine wasn't actually powerful enough to play the game at that detail, but we wanted it to look as good as possible in the mag. To change your resolution, type VID_MODE xx at the console. The standard is O and the best without an extra video driver is 10, which your machine should be able to run really well. Nintendo This box art is bad enough, but this is just the fly on a big mountain of US poo! "


"computer video games YES, WE SHALL OBEY CORRIDOR FANATIC grand on the machine and the game. It's just that, when I eventually get a game, and get stuck, I go to one of my magazines for help, and end up completing it straight away. I don't like getting stuck in game, but I don't want to be told how to complete just because of one problem. Perhaps it would be better if you just did one or two levels each month. Take it in to mind if you will. Ben Franklin, King's Lynn, Norfolk Dear CVG, Why do you have to do Players' Guides to games which haven't even been released yet? For instance Resident Evil (issue #177) and Tekken 2 issue #176). I mean these are games in which we will be lucky to see in, say, at least two months. I can partly understand doing one for Tekken, but doing one for a game like Resident Evil really ruins it. Because now, if I were to go and buy it I would have completed it in a couple of hours, meaning  down the toilet. I have nothing against your players Guides it's just that you do them too early. Your magazine isn't just to blame though. I have realised it in other ones as well. Why not do Players' Guides for oldie games, for instance Mario Kart, or an RPG of some sort, or even a retro guide? If you do a Mario 64 one you will have ruined it for thousands of people who have just spent a TEAM: Thanks for your letter Ben. The reasons our guides sometimes appear early is because of release dates slipping. We aim to structure our guides so that they don't give everything away at a glance. Resident Evil was deliberately presented as maps, as opposed to a walk through pictorial for that reason. And, you're absolutely right, a Mario 64 guide would be pointless for the UK at this time. We have taken your point very seriously, however. The last thing we want to do is ruin peoples' pleasure from playing cool games. Dear CVG, I love your mag and buy it constantly. The rating system is good as quick reference and the mag's colour and boldness make it stand out to any other boring magazine around! At the moment I am a devoted Sega junkie owning a Saturn, Mega Drive and Game Gear. I'm addicted to corridor shoot 'em ups like Duke Nukem. Though owning a Saturn I was pleased to see Doom on the PlayStation and had to make do by renting Doom and the PlayStation. It is a shame that such games are rarely released for the Saturn and why are they so slow on the uptake? Exhumed looks good, but doesn't seem to have superiority over Quake and Duke Nukem. For ages I have not touched such cool games on the Saturn and when will Quake and Duke Nukem be converted onto it? Such games receive much hype but us 32bit gamers have to dream of the day we can batter knights and fiends. Why the delay? Still, I make do with Virtua Fighter 2 and Virtua Cop. Also I like your mag's humour and dedication to all games bright and beautiful. I NEED CHIPSI I NEED THEM NOWI GRGULL; PS Have you ever heard of a Saturn game called Legacy of Kain? If so when will it come out? Mo Pugh, Finchley 10000 TEAM: Don't be so quick to judge Exhumed. It's an awesome game, which was created using Apogee's Duke engine! Legacy of Kain is a Thor style action adventure by Crystal Dynamics. It's expected early next year. Thanks for the compliments.

"PHYT computer video games THAT TWO-STICK CONTROL SYSTEMI CHARGING Here it is! The Saturn Vo controller. Awesome! SEGA SATURI: We're gonna need to face the mad pace of battles like this. TOTAL.01 *2133 The most unusual thing about Virtual On is its control system. It uses two joysticks to allow instinctive 3D steering similar to Namco's arena combat game, Cyber Sled. By pushing both joysticks in the same direction, your robot jogs that way without changing its facing direction. Pull back on one stick pushing forward on the other, and the robot twists on its axis. Pull the sticks apart and the robot superleaps into the air. There are also dual thrust and attack buttons. Naturally the Saturn control pad isn't designed for this system. At present, the D-pad merely steers the robot around, with one button for locking the facing direction, one for thrust, one for leaping and one for attack. From our early playtest, it doesn't seem particularly suitable for the game. There is however a Sega-style solution. Sega of Japan are releasing a Virtual On dual-control stick, emblazoned to match the coin-op's. It looks ace and should capture the arcade game's feel perfectly. Hopefully Sega will bring it out over here too. Hey, and Sega, bring it out in the same cool colours not boring black. Let's have some of the snazzy Japanese design Saturn stuff, eh? IT'S VIRTUAL ON SATURN! CYBER TROOPBA Things move fast in the world of Sega. From seeing nothing about Virtual On, we're suddenly given a hands-on test of a 50% complete version. And the verdict so far is pretty damn impressive! All the robots and arenas have already been programmed in and even at this stage it looks comparable to the arcade version. Obviously there are going to be compromises the resolution and texture detail is lower but all the arena features are there. The robots, in particular, look and move superbly, with the speed up to scratch. All very promising indeed. 05%2 PLAVER LA to do to go to be stop 3811ETons AMZ'S ROBOT CLASH OF THE TITANS!

In Japan, the game is set to use the new SegaNet option, allowing to players to face off over the InterNet. For that more personal approach, two players can link-up using the X-Band modem facility.

DAYTONA ake no mistake Daytona USA on Saturn was brilliant. Sure it fell short of the coin-op, but the coinop is still an incredible technical achievement. And the Saturn version managed to include all its features. It may have had dreadful clipping and a visibly low frame rate, but the atmosphere and gameplay was superb. Even now we still argue the merits of the game scoring a High Five. Nonetheless, fans have been baying for an improved version. Not because they want to see an excellent-looking racing game on Saturn Sega Rally filled that gap but because they want to see an excellent looking Daytona. It deserves better and we know the Saturn CAN do it. And now Sega have taken up the challenge with Daytona USA: Circuit Edition!

Nope, the CS team are behind Daytona CE a team even more experienced at converting Sega's arcade racing games than even AM2. These were the coders who originally joined with AM2 for the awesome MegaDrive version of Virtua Racing, before producing VR Deluxe on their own. And more importantly, they converted Sega Rally onto Saturn. What better credentials could you ask for? AN ARCADE PERFECT CONVERSION? No way! Whether the Saturn could ever handle a full conversion of Daytona isn't obvious yet, but that's not what we're talking about. The fact is, Daytona CE is far more than just a straight conversion of the coin-op it's a expansion of the whole game. New features, new tracks, new presentation. So if you're a die-hard fan of the arcade's front-end track and transmission select screens, you'd better face it they ain't gonna be there.

The original Daytona was the last AM2 Saturn game to be made before they employed the help of their custom-built graphics library. As such, overhauling the code would probably be more complicated than reprogramming it. Currently the game is at a very early stage, with the shapes and textures dropped in. Far too early to comment on what the eventual frame rate and pop-up distance will be. One thing though it IS full-screen! -rum 000 emmm Song 2 comm "


"ALL-NEW MUSIC! computer video games ALL-NEW MOTORS! The original Saturn conversion of Daytona expanded on the arcade selection of vehicles by giving you eight variations of the Gallop, with different colours and handling plus a selection of horses!! What Daytona CE is going to fully offer is unclear, but so far there a four cars in the works. Aside from the original Gallop, there's the Hornet (seen in all the screenshots here) and two as yet unseen ones. Each will be a different style of car! Those crazy karaoke-style tunes in the original game didn't go down too well over here. Even though they were special remixes by B-Univ, Sega Japan's in-house band (who also did Virtua Fighter's music). Anyway, bowing to popular demand, the CS Team have commissioned new music for the game, some of which is being done in Britain! Sega Europe musician, Richard Jacques, has remixed all the tunes in a far more appealing house style. At present we know two of the tunes are definitely going to be used. The rest are supposedly guitar-rock numbers being composed in Japan. Incidently, Richard is also working on the tunes for the new Saturn Sonic game. We've heard them too. Think Sonic CD.

The original Street Fighter 2 was one of the greatest advancements in videogame history, and since then Capcom have spent a not inconsiderable amount of time (and sequels) honing the SF2 game engine to absolute perfection.

All of these characters have made it to the home versions.

"GAMEPLAY computer video games Again, both versions are nigh on identical to the coinop, but here the PlayStation goes one further by offering all-new, remixed background tunes played directly from CD. The Saturn version, on the other hand, offers the original tunes delivered by its internal sound chip, the result of which is that the Saturn version sounds less clear than the PlayStation one. However, play it through Q_Sound as you're meant to, and the differences are far less noticeable. PlayStation Once again Capcom have delivered the goods. All of the play-mechanics that made Alpha 2 such a brilliant arcade game are here: Super Combos; Custom Combos; Alpha Counters; special finishes. Even the endings are all arcade-perfect! The CPU displays a worrying lack of intelligence when dealing with fireballs (even on the highest difficulty setting) but this was also true of the arcade, so no changes here. Otherwise, beating the game on level 8 provides a real challenge for even the most hardened SFA2 pro.

What's more, a handy shortcut menu for Versus battles lessens the delay even more. And if you're wondering how to pick the Secret characters from the Vs menu, the answers lie with the Start button...

GAS 9100 1WIN 1900 2600 GEN The home versions of the original Alpha were visually identical to the coin-op. At first glance both the Saturn and PlayStation versions of Alpha 2 appear to be also. However, in porting the game over from the mighty CPS2 board to the humble RAM-challenged home consoles, some sacrifices had to be made. This is particularly true of the PlayStation version (it has slightly less RAM than the Saturn) which suffers noticeable animation cuts when placed alongside the Saturn or Arcade version. For example Zangief on PlayStation Alpha 2: He only throws his cape off at the start of a fight, or opens his mouth when left alone if you play a Zangief Vs Zangief battle (both versions feature an automatic full-animation option for same character battles!). On Saturn the colossal Russian does both these things even when fighting someone else. Also, some of the PlayStation's backgrounds have received a slight animation trimming. For example there are no fighter reflections in the puddles on Gen's stage, and on Ken's stage Strider does not throw his teddy in the air. And last but not least, the PS intro is, horror of horrors, full-screen FMV! Still, despite these cuts, the overall effect of the conversion is extremely accurate. Check out these shots... PlayStation has the best sound... ... Saturn has the most features... ... and Arcade has the best graphics! Obviously. COMING SOON  2015_1200 What's important is that... ... all three versions ... play identically! Excellent! 23 "


"computer Victo games SHINGOUKI SECRET CHARACTERS 31700 PRESS START ZANGIEF When coin-op Alpha 2 was released in the States, Capcom of America added three new hidden characters to satiate the American public's need for secrets. Capcom of Japan had nothing to do with these characters, and their official line was that they would not appear in the Japanese home conversions, However, due to Evil Ryu's immense popularity, a new coin-op was released in Japan Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha containing all these secrets and more. This is the version the Saturn has received, although we're yet to find the hidden characters in the PS version. Here's a rundown of each of the hidden characters. If you want to find out how to access them, turn to our Freeplay tips section NOW! PlayStation SATUR In coin-op Alpha 2, if you could score three final round perfects before you reached your last opponent, you would face off against the most powerful opponent in Street Fighter history: the devil Shin Gouki. This is also true of the home versions, but guess what on Sony and Sega you also get to play as him! Shin Gouki moves at twice the speed of Akuma, and fires two air fireballs simultaneously. He can chain like Alpha, has an ultra-fast teleport, and an ultra-fast Instant Hellish Death Strike which covers the entire length of the screen! We think he's a bit TOO good, so don't use him much. But there you go. EVII RYU SSF2 TURBO CHUNLU ORIGINAL ZANGIEF VAIN DO The main difference between Alpha 2 Chun Li and Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Chun Li is her old costume and her fireball motion. In Alpha 2, the motion is a full half circle, while with original Chun Li it's a charge motion. This enables her to be played entirely as a charging character, like Charlie. Some players find her better that way. When you defeat Akuma and complete Alpha 2 with ordinary Ryu, Akuma tells Ryu to search for his true dark powers before facing him again. Well, this is it! Ryu converted to the dark side! His Hurricane Kick juggles, he can perform a Super Dragon Punch (as well as his Super Fireball and Hurricane Kick), and best of all, he's got an Instant Hellish Death Strike performed in the same way as Akuma! Awesome! Beamed in from the original Street Fighter 2! Original Zangief has no Super Combo gauge and only two moves: Spinning Clothes line and Spinning Pile Driver! Oh, those were the days. You may be wondering why on earth anyone would pick him? Perhaps because he's twice as tough as Alpha 2 Zangief AND has a huge Pile Driver range. T66YESS START 1900 683 PRESS START 1 PLAYER Yup.

"* TRAINING MODE SURVIVAL MODE computer video games Making a welcome return from Street Fighter Alpha, this allows players to brush up on their moves and combos against a defenceless CPU opponent. Training Mode is especially handy in Alpha 2 because a) the chaining system has changed so you've got to re-learn all your favourite combos, and b) building up the Super Combo gauge for custom combos is a drag. You can make your opponent crouch, stand or jump, and once you've got the first hit in, the CPU will attempt to block all successive hits, so you can work out useful combos for a Versus game. One nice feature we discovered on the Saturn version is an unlimited custom combo, accessed by holding Start and the L button when selecting your character. Also try Start and R for an instant autofire option! It works in Arcade mode too! PlayStation So far we've only encountered this mode on the Saturn version, though there is a gap in the PS menu, indicating that it may be hidden. Survival Mode basically pits you against every single other Street Fighter in a one-on-eighteen battle to the death. You fight one round, and must try to work your Fight all 18 characters in a way through as many opponents as row with one energy bar! possible, ending in Akuma.

LOW STACE 1 SEGA AGES ith a reputation for creating most of the best coin-ops ever made in the last 12 years, Sega would have been fools not to consider bringing their more legendary coin-ops to the Saturn. And sure enough, a few months back Space Harrier was released in Japan. Soon to be followed by After Burner and Out Run. For true fans of Sega's heritage, these titles are definitely worth snapping up. For your average gaming punter though, spending money on one ancient game, no matter how good it is, isn't the most tempting notion. Ah, but if all three games were on one disc that would be another matter. And that's what Sega are doing here in the UK! This is going to be a museum compilation to rival even those of Namco!! FROM THE CREATOR OF VIRTUA FIGHTER 3! SIGHT Yes indeed. The original coin-op versions of these games were made by none other than Yu Suzuki, the man responsible for Virtua Racing. Daytona and the Virtua Fighter series. Even back then his titles were breakthroughs in 3D gaming, utilising Sega's then-brand-new Super Scaler sprite technology, which expanded the scenery as it got closer. A technique that's been replicated in a million games since! SEGA 198 AFTERBURNER (1986) START. OUTRUN (1987) SEGA'S GOLDEN OLDIES COME TO SATURN! The legendary aeriel shoot 'em up! After Burner is most memorable for being a completely insane expe, rience. Rocking hydraulic cabinet, juddering feedback joystick and swarms of enemy fighters were the ingredients. Even without the cabinet and stick it's still insane as rockets, smoke trails and explosions cloud the screen. Hit those After Burners, Tommy! Forget Daytona, Ridge Racer and Sega Rally this Is the most famous driving game ever made. Taking control of a Ferrari Testarossa, you race along twisting highways, overtaking cars and trucks while avoiding incoming traffic coming the other way. Hazardous roadside scenery made the whole thing a lot trickier the most memorable of which was a series of rock arches that were, probably meant to be a tunnel. To date, there has NEVER been a decent home, conversion of Out Run, so this is definitely the one to wait for. SICURE 22750 L O Slut 3 STAGE 2245 STACE BREE SELECT MUSIC BY STEERING JFMAGICAL SOUND SHOWER 1 The MegaDrive version was good, the 32X version was arcade-close.

ESTRENO COTE SPACE HARRIER (1985) E 2009 Good The first of these compilation titles was also the first coin-op to feature a hydraulic cabinet! Without its famous interface, it's still a decent blaster. Hey, you wouldn't have the likes of Panzer Dragoon Zwei if it wasn't for this game! Basically, you steer a man around the screen, while he runs/ flies unrelentingly forwards. Shoot everything in sight and face big bosses at the end of each stage. NOW-LOADING SPACE HARRIER That's what Sega promise and from what we've seen we believe them. The games are being converted by hardcore fans of the originals who, Sega say, are sticklers for perfec tion. Jolly good show. 26 "

My job is now done. We know that some of you have been living for this day — when the UK receives its first quality RPG for the PlayStation. It's here: Konami's Suikoden! GENSO SUIKODEN ou bought your PlayStation to enjoy thrilling games that have a long term challenge. No doubt you want these games to look awesome too. To labour the point just one step further, you have every right to demand an incredible CD soundtrack. Well, Konami's Suikoden delivers all this. Incredible to think that some players still believe RPGs to be boring. In fact there's a case to argue that the best RPGs are in every way more impressive than most action games out there. We fully expect Suikoden to change a few opinions, and reward discerning UK fans with a fantastic new alternative to racing, fighting, and shooting stuff. Hurray for Konami! FIRST MAJOR RPG TO HIT THE UK PLAYSTATION GLORIOUS The PlayStation has enabled an absolutely gorgeous world to take shape. While not so splendid Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VII, which is still in development, Suikoden's locations are exquisite in detail. This is immediately apparent from the reflective floor surfaces in the palace, and the beautific landscapes which surround the towns. As the adventure progresses, the locations become more exotic. RUNE SERVICE In addition to the 27 True Runes, there are many lesser types which serve to enhance weapons or even people! These are discovered while travelling, or found on sale (for a price) at specialist shops. Runes impart magical strength to anything which is compatible. BOAR RUNE! Master Teo, Neeter Paul. The Emperor All Ten Pleaca at way. Every character has their reflection mirrored from the shiny palace floor. This fountain decorates the hero's home town. The water looks almost real. Long distance journeys are depicted in this style. Again the detail is very fine. GENSO LORE Just to lure you in with some fairly awesome plot details: The story concerns itself with the existence of 27 powerful magic artifacts known as the True Runes. Very early on in the adventure the hero is burdened with the task of guarding one such article from falling into the possession of a witch. This rune, called the Cursed Rune, or \"Soul Eater\", creates terrible magic fatal to innocent users. Unbeknown to the hero, one of his closest friends (Ted) is 300 years old (!) and has been hiding the gem from this witch for most of his life. A dramatic confrontation with the court magician reveals the witch's identity, which Ted barely survives. Court magician \"Windy\" feels the wrath of the Soul Eater, one of the True Runes. Ted entrusts the main charac ter (you!) with the safeguard of this mighty weapon. The character Pahn uses his Boar Rune to perform Street Fighter-style combos on the enemy. PAFF! PAFF! POWI SMACK! 28 "

NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED STORAGE 1 CD COMPLETE PlayStation APRIL '97 RELEASE 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY INTERPLAY TEL: 01628 423 666 PlayStation Recall the impact Earthworm Jim made on pe the 16-bit systems. Well, Shiny Entertainment are prepared to go 20 times better with their 32-bit debut! SEG SATURN WILD NINES brand new 3D platform game is underway at Shiny Entertainment; one which introduces the concept of \"Living Environments\" , and will incorporate over 60, 000 hand drawn animations to bring its characters to life (Earthworm Jim uses around 3000). Once again it's all due to this inventive team's dedication to producing revolutionary graphics engines. Come April '97, the Saturn and PlayStation may never have had it so good. All that has been revealed so far is a tantalising video, shown behind the scenes at ECTS, and the screenshots we are about to explain here. Take your time reading this page, as the concept is amazing. ........................... Wex THE MOST ANIMATED GAME EVER!!! A teenage super hero, armed with a telescopic staff and 'The Rig'. Wex's staff is adapted for use as a pole vault across wide crevices, and as a martial arts weapon. But it is The Rig which Shiny are most proud of, using power beams to all manner of crazy effects: hooking enemies off their feet, and flinging them around; or unleashing the 'multiple torpedo blast', which fires three lightning bolts which home in on the enemy. By the way, Wex doesn't carry this thing around The Rig is like a living thing which has wound itself around Wex's body like a Boa Constrictor. Strictly speaking The Rig isn't a gun, which is intended to keep concerned parents happy! HUGE IN SCALE AND SCOPE Before blasting off about all the new features, bear in mind that this is basically an Earthworm Jim style scenario. There is a set path to follow, with strict routines to enable, and from we can gather the gameplay is 2D. BUT Shiny believe that what they have created is superior to Mario 64, and NIGHTS for the following: Wex's World Shiny boast that the 3D world they have created is a \"living environment\", by which they mean Wex can interact with it. This feature is intended to be so intense that it will feel as though Wex exists within it. Reads like a load of hokum, but Shiny aren't in the habit of letting people down. In any case, the nine worlds should look incredible since they are all light sourced, and carefully depth cued (no clipping) to convey as much realism as is 32-bit possible. Wonder what this place will turn out to be? NOOS ININO) WEX YOUR APPETITE We only saw a five minute sequence at ECTS, in which Wex battled a giant lava beast, dodging firey rain. It looked like a brilliant cartoon, we can only hope that the interactive element is as good. The tape also gave us a brief glimpse of \"supreme baddie\" Karn a dark, sinister face which occupies ceiling space of two Soccer pitches in size, overlooking a holographic map. Creative Director Kevin Munroe told CVG that he wanted the last boss to be scary! Other, similarly mindblowing events are scheduled to include Filbert an 8' 500lb frog with an electric tongue! NEXT MONTH... FAR, FAR AWAY... So far Shiny have been concentrating on the Saturn version of Nines, but they say the PlayStation version is coming along beautifully too. They have until April to finalise something which will blow our heads off. No doubt CVG will have progress reports before that time so \"more soon\"! 1 Shiny have chosen to create the entire Wild Nines universe in Real Time 3D!!!

NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD COMPLETE Espoor en un NOV RELEASE 1 PLAYER ROM  RELEASED BY INTERPLAY TEL: 01628 423 666 ROM If you think Earthworm Jim sums up Shiny Entertainment, prepare to be shocked to the core with their first PC title. They just redefined the whole 3D shooting thing from the ground up!!! nd here we were, thinking that the environments offered by Quake and Duke Nukem were the closest we could get to a virtual reality. Recently we have discovered an amazing new approach: MDK, from the genius team at Shiny Entertainment. Nobody is quite sure what MDK stands for just yet, but Murder Death Kill is the most appropriate we've heard so far. We asked David Perry to help explain the unique gameplay of his team's latest project, so this feature is the result of his kind assistance and our best attempt at conveying the excitement of MDK. All captions are by DP himself. MURDER! DEATH!! KILL!!! FREEDOM A brilliant new 3D engine has been created to enable the hero named Kurt to have complete freedom of movement through eight alien worlds. Most of the time Kurt is viewed from a third-person perspective, intended to keep players aware of his complex surroundings. From here you can appreciate it better when he cheekily hops onto the back of an enemy aircraft as it flies by, and uses it as a mobile sniper post while being carried to another part of the area. This freedom also extends to the enemies faced, as they continue about their daily business, as opposed to just hanging around waiting to shoot something. Not everything is out to kill, but it can be provoked! \"Kurt takes a ride on an enemy's space chariot. The enemies had better watch their heads!\" a feature Shiny don't expect most players to work out at first. Oops. NOOS ONIWO) \"Notice the bullet heading for the ship in the top left window.\" Here's kurt as the player usually sees him. Motion capture will be used to enhance the realism. Kurt stumbles across a grunt heading for his space craft. One of the many differences in MDK is that the enemies are just going about their daily duties and not just waiting for you around the corner. 32 9999999 "


"computer Video games The new engine also enables the creation of wide open spaces, with a natural field of vision. Typically meaning that any object which passes through the line of sight can be observed from any distance, at an insane level of detail — with no pixelisation, or loss of speed. Shiny have named this technology 'ZOOMVIEWTM'. To give you an example, there is a situation where observation posts a mile away are occupied by armed guards. From within Kurt's helmet, it is possible to focus in on them to stare them right in the eye-though they have no idea that they are being watched. This has a subliminal, unsettling effect too, as kurt chancing a dash across an open space in the hope of not being seen is just pure tension! ROM \"Shows the amount of colour that MDK can handle... running in high resolution.\" \"You have been spotted. Three enemy sentry fighters are here to greet you.\" PRECISION You can see from this wireframe sentry how the collision points are so accurately mapped. You could fire a bullet through the gap on its hips If you wanted. But the idea is to get him in the eye! Such attention to detail in a game is admirable, but it is the means to an even more incredible end. The facility to zoom in on an enemy is not just for examination purposes in MDK the collision points mapped onto every object adhere to real-world expectations too. Instead of a bunch of clumsy blocks to register hits, whereby a shot which goes slightly wide might still score, the surface of any object in MDK is mapped out in detail. Meaning that shots can be so precise as to pass right through the gap beneath the arm, or pierce an eyeball, from up to a mile away! MURDER! DEATHI! KILL!! MURDER! DEATHII KI \"Inside Kurt's helmet. Cameras attached to the bullets show their progress.\" \"You can see him, but you're so far away he can't see you.\" TIRONAUTA SPECIFICATION HDK PSX It's safe to assume that, by the time MDK is launched this Christmas, the most common form of PC in the home will have a Pentium processor. In which case, EVERYONE will be able to play MDK as it was intended. But there's news just in of something which may interest even more of you reading this... A PlayStation version of MDK has been confirmed, to be handled by an outside development. Incredible considering that the game benefits from a decent hard disk, and thus no pauses for loading time. However we are assured that Shiny wouldn't allow any conversion to compromise the quality of this game. If Shiny okayed it, we can expect great things. An insane level of fidelity is used to describe every aspect of the game, from the inside of Kurt's helmet, to this weird lizard guy. The ZOOMVIEWTM technology makes the transition from distant to close in without a shudder, or loss of speed. And you can see the quality of detail and colour. TAR COMING SOON NEXT MONTH... MORE DAPPER KOVERAGE! \"Kurt's suit has built in chute ribbons to break his fall.\" This looks really cool! \"Soon they will discover that hiding behind glass was a tactical error.\" \"Back by popular demand, the famous Earthworm Jim cow.\" Expect to be amazed by our review coverage of PC MDK in the December issue of CVG. We're also trying to find out as much as we can about the PlayStation project, so stay in touch! 1993399999999999999 33 "

LADATOI FRISORES he PlayStation is rapidly shaping up to become THE platform to own for 3D polygon based fighting games. Toshinden, Tekken, Tobal No.1 and in the en not to distant future: Kumite, Bushido Blade and Street Fighter 3D (Gaiden). But before then there's Star Gladiators, Capcom's first outing into the world of 3D beat 'em ups. Coded for the arcades on System 11 architecture, Star Gladiators makes use of some of the most impressive lighting effects and detailed backdrops you've ever seen! If you thought Tekken 2 looked good, you ain't seen nothing yet! STAR 12D TO EPISODE:I FINAL CRUSADE O NIN PLASMA June CATATAMA Hayato Hayato NAS CAPCOM'S FIRST 3D FIGHTING GAME! June wraps her legs around her opponents neck... then snaps their neck! The lighting effects and transparencies are in a class of their own. PLASMA COMBOSI *** FINAL PLASMA ATTACKI *** To go with the innovative control system, Capcom have also introduced a completely new concept in combination attacks. Honestly! Its called the Plasma combination system and here's how it works: Each character belongs to one of three different combination 'groups': A-Type, B-Type or K-Type. These groups are represented by a chain tree' as shown below. Each combination group has a different set of predetermined attacks that can be strung together without stopping, as shown in the tree. For instance. Hayato belongs to the A-Type Plasma Combo group. so could string together three kicks (K. K. K) or four A attacks (A, A, A. A) but NOT three B attacks. By looking at the tree and following the arrows you can work out which combination of button presses will work, and which won't. Got it? Good. From the tree you can work out which combinations of moves can be strung together and which can't. Obviously, the longer the combo, the greater the damage inflicted, so you'll want to be perfecting those 5 hit combos (the maximum number) that go all the way to the end of the chain. A working 5-hit combo for Hayato, for instance, would be BABBA or AAAKK. Now, you'll notice that by certain final hits on the chain chart there are numbers. These numbers refer to specific characters, and if those specific characters use a chain combo that FINISHES with that attack (the one indicated by the number), it will be a Plasma strike! If a Plasma strike makes contact with your opponent it will stun them, and then by inputting a simple D-pad command (say up and A) your character will perform his/her FINAL ATTACK! These are awesome special moves that utilise dramatic camera angles, and must be seen to be believed! Confused? Don't worry, here's a run through of Hayato's Plasma combo and Final to clear things up! 22 OKROG Horare A-TYPE HAYATO: A -> THEN 4 +A Hayato performs his Plasma chain combo (1). After the last 'plasma' hit in the chain (2), Rimgall is stunned (3). Press Up and A to initiate Hayato's final attack.

He has a range of alien bubble attacks, and an excellent foot stomp for when he's giant! It hardly seems fair! HAYATO KANZAKI Born in Japan, Hayato is a bounty hunter hired to fight against the evil Empire. He carries a Plasma sword that can be doubled in size by simply tapping down three times, and has an incredible Plasma Final where he leaps through the air and cuts down on his hapless foe shouting 'See Ya!'. PlayStation GAMOF GOHGRY A Guardian of the woods, Gamof was born and raised on the planet of Derosa. Despite Gamof's big club (which he uses to bat opponents around the ring), he specialises in throws, and is notable for having one of the most spectacular Plasma Final's in the game. RIMGAL A dinosaur hybrid who fights with a giant skull club. Rimgal can breathe fire, and specialises in Lei Wulong style lying on the ground' attacks. His Plasma Final sees him taking huge bites of his opponents ending up with a painful between the legs chomp! 1LD TOI PLASMO Gerelt DE 2070 DO PLASM Sat uma SATURN DYER Saturn is a street performer with a 500 IQ, though he uses those deadly yo yo's for much more than entertainment. Look out for his 'walking the dog' move where he cuts up through his opponents body Octopussy style! FRANCO GERELT A dandy Spanish cosmic matador who utilises a fencing rapier to deadly effect. Most of his attacks are based around fencing moves, particularly his Plasma Final in which he slices opponents before hurling them in the air, only to land right on his blade! JUNE LIN MILLIAM Apparently June is an abandoned English girl, though she looks a bit Eastern to us. She specialises in leg attacks and uses her hoop to good effect too. Watch out for her Plasma Final, where she raps her legs around the unfortunate recipients heads, before snapping their neck! ZELKIN FISKEKROGEN Zelkin is an arrogant birdman who is remarkable among the Star Gladiators for being able to fly. He has a brilliant range of aerial attacks, including a spinning pile driver type throw where he lifts his opponents high up into the air before dumping them on their necks. CAPCOM'S FIRST 3D FIGHTING GAME! * LETS GET HORIZONTAL * Rather than just opt for the same old two punches and kicks routine, Capcom have crafted an innovative new control system designed to fit the 3D gameplay of Star Gladiators. Your two main attacks are the horizontal strike and vertical strike, each using your character's weapon to attack at a different height zone of your opponent's body. The third 'kick' button is used for a quick weapon free attack that's useful for starting a combo or countering an opponents slower moves. VECTOR PX-02C A weapon of destruction created by the Fourth Empire, Vector is slow moving mechanical behemoth with a large range of projectile attacks. He may be cumbersome, but in the right hands he's lethal. Vector also has a cool Plasma Final where his hand turns into a giant comedy hammer which squashes his opponent. Hinate Free NASA Go Vertical attack (A) Horizontal attack (B) Capcom have spent a lot of time on June's, er, derriere. Gore gets B.I.G.! Giant Gore battles are excellent! Guard Kick (K) NEXT MONTH... OUCH! OR We should have a reviewable copy of Star Gladiator with us for next issue, but believe us when we say this is shaping up to be something REALLY special.

SMALL DOCKS 100% | BATTLESHIPS AT OVER SQUADRON LAUNCHING ON RECON MISSION RISK t long last a major games company has had the good sense to identify the essence of a great board game, and look at a way of expanding the idea for the video game platforms. Games like Risk and Battleship have been provisionally \"playtested' by millions since their introduction many years ago. What's needed now is to expand on their appeal by introducing situations that only computers are capable of. Talented design team NMS (Tilt) have been hard at work updating Hasbro's flagship titles for the PC, and soon to be Saturn and PlayStation. AWESOME PC VERSIONS OF RISK AND BATTLESHIP! RISK BATTLESHIP \"The classic game of strategy and world domination for two to six players\". As the PC gaming world continues to admire Command and Conquer, Hasbro have something of an interesting alternative with computer Risk. How this classic board game looks in your imagination as you play is most likely to correspond with how PC Risk looks on screen. Surely one of the most basic of pencil and paper games next to noughts and crosses. It translates into a pretty basic board game too, where players take turns calling out co-ordinates in the hope of nailing an opponent's little fleet. Everyone knows Battleship. But not, we assure you, quite like this... We're assuming most people reading this have played Risk. But for those who haven't, the simple premise is this: each player represents the general of a continent, whose role it is to utilise cunning military strategies to conquer other territories while fulfiling the an objective stated on his Mission Card. First person to do this wins. COMPUTER ENHANCED BATTLESHIP ... Aim to take conquer as much territory as possible. Assign different garrisons to carry out specialist attacks.

For example it helps to know that your base is under fire, right! Similarly there is time to breath a sigh of relief when your squadron of jets make a safe landing. All this in real time, and against up to three internet or local networked players! COMPUTER ENHANCED RISK NOUS UNINOJ In a computer environment weather conditions can be simulated which affect the performance of troops. There is also terrain to consider, in the form of fortifications and cities. Disease might cause problems too since Hasbro have introduced Pestilence into the proceedings. And all of the battle scenes cannons firing, cavalry charging, and so on-are depicted as high resolution, motion-capture sequences for each player. You may even find yourself being offered advice from Napoleon himself. Excellent! This all makes for a promising one-player game, but a 'slave' disc will allow one copy of the game to sup port an eight-player Local Area Network game. Plus Hasbro are negotiating deals with major internet providers to allow for full-on 'Cyber Risk'. We think this title, especially, is going to be really hot this coming Christmas! BOARD OF EXAMINATION No doubt you're feeling pretty sceptical about these games. We were too. But you have to see them in action to appreciate how for the first time -recognised classic games have been given new life through the comput er.

We thought this game looked great on the Saturn, look what JVC have done with the PlayStation! It has been approximately a year since Victory Boxing received a pat on the back from CVG.

ROU 2:09 FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY STUFF OF LEGENDS BUDDING PRINCE NASEEMS STEP THIS WAY! Unlike the Saturn game, all fighters in the Producer's Cut are motion captured. This has allowed the development team to concentrate on authenticity of movement, to such a degree that a novice fighter looks awkward compared to the fluidity of a champion. Their build also affects their style, so Heavy weights are distinct from Bantam weights in style as well as size. Keep that guard up! CREATIVOUR BOXER By developing your fighter's prowess, and becoming perfectly in tune with his/her unique skills, there is an opportunity to become a boxing legend. You might expect that the game is over once the Championship Belt is won, but that's not how it is in real life. So JVC leave the game open so that past foes, and even newcomers, are always challenging for the belt. Another way to become a legend is to rise to glory in an unprecedented short time.

In case you've never noticed while busy blowing away imps, you never get one floor above another, you never get sloping floors or walls, and you could never jump. Thankfully, Disruptor is well up-to-date, featuring all of these things! And if you're wondering how the game came to be almost finished before we told you anything about it, it's because we didn't know anything about it either! MY BRAN HURTSI One of the original features of Disruptor is that the main character can use special psychic abilities as well as massive futuristic weapons. In the bottom-right of the screen is a ghostly head which shows how much psychic power you currently possess, and by pressing one of the buttons you can use one of your special brain powers. BANG BANG, YOU'RE DEADI INTERPLAY'S BRAND NEW 3D SHOOTING GAME! dd MOODY MUSICIO POWER DRAN This only uses a small amount of your energy, but the glowing balls attach themselves to an enemy and stay there, sapping their powers. As you'd expect from a first-person perspective \"corridor\" game, you start off armed with just a small single-firing pistol (or an 18mm Semi as it's known in Disruptor). But before long, plenty more futuristic weapons become available. Here are the one's you'll come across in the first five practice levels. Later on you'll get smart bombs, multiple lasers and giant plasma guns! One of the things we noticed most when playing Disruptor is the music. It plays away quietly in the background, adding atmosphere, then suddenly becomes really fast-paced and threatening as you get into trouble! This technique is used in games like Magic Carpet and Dark Forces already, and Disruptor proves exactly how effective it can be in increasing the movie-like feel of a game. 18MM SEMI 18MM AUTO LOCKON CANNON The standard slow-firing, weak This is just like the standard 18mm Fires slow-moving explosives at any pistol which you start with.

And well they should, because developers Climax are the Square Soft of the Sega world! DARK SAVIOUR THE HYPEREAT VIEW t the end of August this year, Japanese gamers could finally go out and buy one of their dream titles.

Dark Saviour mixes polygons and sprites to create a stunning gaming environment and throws in some traditional Landstalker gameplay. The result? A H-U-G-E RPG with tons of challenge!

Realising that it was down to me to even the odds, recruited ex-MAXIMUM staff writer Daniel Jevons to join TATOMINATOR the fray. That left one gap. Unfortunately, since my PARADOX plans for world domination excludes the concept of friends and friendship, it was down to me The Master to Ed's shotgun is much like the Final scores: a better overall join forces with the deluded cretins.

Village idiot Tom Guise put in do with second place. The fact that just about all of the CVG lurked at the the most practice and managed to perform worse than ever he had before bottom of the table speaks volumes. an achievement I found highly amusing. His pathetic, strangled squeals of \"But I've got a ping of 98!\" amongst others helped pass the time. CHALLENGE #2: THE FREE-TOR-ALL Scorelines like 20 to -11 confirmed my theory that when it came to games, My performance had been acceptable in the first round, but Jevons knew as Guise was frankly absurd. The editor, Paul Davies, was conspicuous by his well as I that the only reason he had prevailed over me was the fact that the absence.

Not only had I achieved victory The beginning of the match went as I expected. The CVG fools spent as much time shooting at each other as they did at the opposition and even then, the hit rate was particularly miserable. However, I am The Master, and as such felt I had some kind of responsibility in helping the poor fools out. My protege Jevons was racking up the frags left, right and centre and I too was enjoying the carnage, ripping the yellow scum to shreds! To be honest, even with all my power on their side, the CVG miscreants should have lost. The Shoot 'n' Surf players actually employed tactics, leaving guards at the rocket launcher, thus denying the CVG team access to it. When the final scoreline appeared (EMAP 437, S'n'S 435), it was a vindication of my power the CVG fools had been entirely overwhelmed and only the skills of myself and the brain-damaged Jevons had won the day. \"Tony\" from S'n's takes an Lomas enters a warzone as The EMAP team won by two frags a slim victory considering the 872 kills early lead as I indulge in handing \"Tony\" (in white) unleashes loads in total.

However, the redoubtable Jevons had obviously been watching The Master at work in the previous epic and copied my tactics of locating the Quad Damage, finding a big open room and letting rip. Whereas I had to collect the Quad in a densely packed room, Jevons had the advantage by picking it up from a secret area in this new level, near an armour power-up and the chain nail gun!

CREATE YOUR OWN LEVELS! or a start, if you've got a PC and you haven't got a modem yet, this game is the perfect excuse to spend about  on one, so that you can play 16-player deathmatches against the whole of the world, as well as get easy access to loads of game-enhancing patches and programs. Here are a few of the newer programs and home made addons, as well as an explanation of exactly how to connect to a Quake game elsewhere in the world. This patch adds loads to the basic Quake game! In the giant level included with the patch The Hangar players can find small spaceships sitting around. By getting in them, players can fly around the levels like Descent, gunning everything down with either machine guns or the missile launchers attached! It's also possible to eject from your ship at any time, which is very useful for when your ship is shot to bits and is about to crash! This patch makes deathmatches a real laugh and is really quite good fun even for the real oneplayer game! Get it now! There are a few level editors already available for Quake, with more being worked on as we write. Doom's level editors (the most popular was DEU 5.21) took a bit of work to get used to it took Ed months to finally create his first level but enabled players to make levels as good as the original id episodes. There are already hundreds of Quake levels available free, and with one of these editors, you can get to work creating your own. CREATE YOUR OWN GRAPHICS! IT'S A MILLION GAMES IN ONE! The patch also adds a new weapon the Stinger Missile Launcher! It's got a laser locking target site, making it excellent fun. Now that Quake's been available for a few months, the complex editors are now being simplified to a level which normal people, like us, can use. QUAKEME is a really easy to use texture editor, letting you create your own characters in minutes! Simply use the program to view the texture for one of the models in the game, export the texture as a .BMP file, and edit it in any graphics program, like Paint Shop Pro. Once you've finished scribbling, simply import it to a model, save it, and run it in Quake as you would any other! Using this program, Ed managed to change all of the Grunts in the game into Pink Floyd T-shirt wearing undead Lomases! Just look at these pictures to see how terrifying it truly is to find 10 Eds staggering towards you at once! 1 Here is one of the first levels made by the creator of THRED, a new level editor which is claimed to be easier to use than any Doom editor.

"computer video games 993 FIGHTING GAME BY SEGA  ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  PRICE .99  PUBLISHED BY SEGA TEL: 0181 996 4620 SEGAT SATURN NOV RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS REPLAY SEA SATURN Remixed for the home, AM#2's high impact take on the VF theme now plays better than ever. Prepare for \"Hyper Vipers\"! FICHTING VIPERS GIPT hat you're looking at is the ultimate version of Fighting Vipers, unavailable anywhere EXCEPT on Sega Saturn. But why care? Well, on the surface Vipers appears to be a cashin on the successful VF theme PPK combos, followed by pouncing attacks but you'll find this barely scratches the surface. The fighting stage is surrounded by walls, which calls for unique tactical strategies. Plus all fighters are protected by armour at the start of each round, which players aim to smash off to gain the advantage. Even without these features, the repertoire of moves for each fighter is complex enough to rival VF2. Those of you who are worried about depth of gameplay should consider that Hyper mode incorporates basic VF3 style transposition moves, and a form of \"Original Combo' as seen in Street Fighter Alpha 2. Whether you're an AM2 connoisseur, or someone looking for a flashy alternative to the classic VF2, this review should turn you on. THE DIFFERENCE ORIGNAL FIGHTING VARS Vipers shares the same engine as used in VF2, though this has been extensively modified. Sega's Model 2 board is really pushed to the limit! The arcade original features jaw-dropping background features, large in scale and number. For the Saturn version all except the heli in Mahler/ B.M.'s stage are gone. No worries, because this means AM2 who handled the conversion didn't have to compromise the gameplay. The purpose of this review is not to whine about how Saturn FV is not an identical replica of the coin-op, but to show you how much the Vipers gameplay is advanced from the VF theme, and how the Saturn Vipers gameplay is advanced even beyond that! Proclaimed by AM2 as their most innovative 3D fighting game\" last year. Sega chose to launch Vipers at a night club in Tokyo's trendiest district, Ropongi. We tell you this because it! helps to get a grip of where Fighting Vipers is pitched at people who appreciate wild visual presentation, and fast action which keeps coming at you. In place of old Shun Di and the graceful Pai we have gang leader Bahn and Fashionable Gal Honey (aka Candy). Biggest difference of all is that there is no Ring Out strategy to respect. The fight area is enclosed, and herein lies a key element of Vipers strategy: No one, but NO ONE, likes to be backed into a corner; and will always come back fighting! Here's the basic breakdown of survival tactics: WALLS ARC You've seen the pictures of Vipers being blasted through the walls. But a spectacular end to a fierce fight is not their main purpose. Walls are used strategically to springboard at speed into an opponent, or provide 1 Picky demonstrates a suitably nasty prop for scraping the \"Rocket Missile', a someone's face along. A few of the move which catapults Vipers can even scale the walls him off the wall. before attempting an aerial assault on the guy below. Backing someone into a wall, or corner, enables 'machine gun' tactics juggling the victim with rapid punches or kicks. 1 Walls are used by all to bounce over an oppon ent's head, or jump back into action. 99 REVIEW 99. PE SAT TOXIC PICKY 1 Honey, Jane, and Picky may use the wall as a launch pad for specialist tactics. 1 Here we see Jane drag her victim's head along the enclosure. It looks very painful! 52 "


"computer Video games NEW MOVES FOR SATURN VERSIONIT ARMOUR PROTECTION ARRANGE VERSION It was found that some characters lost their armour quicker than others under certain circumstances. So now the balance has been adjusted to give everyone a fair chance. In most cases the revisions are slight. but Picky's top layer has been taken down to 175 from 250! No wonder Tom Guise chose him all the time!!! After listening to feedback from expert players AM2 have included a revised version of Fighting Vipers for the Saturn. The gameplay of Virtua Fighter 2.1 is balanced by minor alterations, and the same is true here. Plus Yu Suzuki's team also added moves to encourage new tactics. SATU BAHN 9 RAXEL O 1 A familiar new throw 1 Death Spin Thrust f 10MMEVIMAS GRACE PICKY QUICKER RECOVERY WEAKER ATTACKS Now there is even less chance to steal a few points by jumping downed opponents. You need a pret ty hard combo to keep them down for long enough Many of the techniques which used to cause high damage have been restrained. Most notably Bahn's shoulder barge isn't so devastating as before. 1 Camel High Spin 1 Upper Low Spin HONEY TOKIO IN MAXAN 1 Spinning Kick 1 Belly Flap Punch You can only do this to a fighter if the knockdown combo was good. Moves like Jane's jump kick are toned down for better fights. RECOVERY TIME ARMOUR ss A popular technique' with novice fighters is to go for the pounce immediately after downing an opponent. Getting away with this in Fighting Vipers isn't so easy. as a miscalculated jump is penalised by being stunned upon landing. It takes a couple of seconds to recover time enough for the happy guy left standing to slap their aggressor senseless! 199. PICKY Why isn't Saturn Fighting Vipers fully presented in high resolution? The answer is mostly here: Fighters in this game aren't just textured to look pretty, they wear armour. At the start of each round what you're looking at is a couple of characters encased in shells just waiting to be cracked by powerful blows. What's so impressive about this is that the effect of a character losing their protective layer is instant, and highlighted by a brief replay which snaps through a series 1 Armour is divided in two parts, upper of dramatic angles. Before seeing the and lower. A damage meter sits alongside Saturn version in action, we joked the energy bar, which changes colour that it would show 10-second replays from green to red when weakened. while the new characters loaded in. But no it's instant, and therefore very impressive. 12 RAMEL 1 Not all attacks are powerful enough to floor an opponent for long periods of time. REVIEW 1 Unprotected, the Vipers take up to twice the amount of damage. Lose one section of armour and the bar becomes yellow (ouch). Both, and it turns red (big ouch). 1. When their damage meter is flashing red, target the relevant section to break it down completely. When this happens the armour smashes clean away. CRACK! 1 A failed pounce 1 \"EEYAH! That'll teach \"Hammer' attack you! Next time you try leaves a clumsy fighter it, you'll get exactly the dazed for a while. same. FOOL!\" "


"computer video games HYPER VERSION Best played when you're brain is buzzing from five cans of cola and a 5lb bag of chocolate! Go crazy, or take Hyper Vipers more seriously than ever before. Either way it's intense. Here are the revisions which purists may consider a little too extreme. Well stuff you! IM 993 SATURN HYPER MODE DODGE VIPERS 1 Honey gets blasted right across the fight stage, from the Justice Viper's 'Block Buster'. What an awesome replay angle! Press away together with P+K to enter All Vipers can dodge attacks. Press Hyper Mode, in which your guy P+K+G simultaneously, together with removes all armour and flashes red for either toward or away on the D-pad, the rest of the round. Fighters in Hyper to side step left or right. This isn't so Mode may string together unlimited controlled as the transposition moves special moves with no recovery time in Virtua Fighter 3, but it significantly just like an Original Combo in Street increase the tactical possibilities. If Fighter Alpha 2. The downside is that you're still confused, just imagine the subsequent rounds leave them vulnerentire VF2 line-up suddenly being able without armour, as Hyper Mode able to mimic Lion's evasion moves. may only be entered once. Pretty mind-blowing, eh! MORE EXCLUSIVE SATURN VIPERS STUFFI RECORD YOUR OWN FIGHT Vipers is so spectacular that almost every match leaves you wishing you could watch it through again. And you can! Pressing the L shoulder button at any stage after the KO records the entire round, which is saved onto internal or cartridge memory. Best of all, you can freeze-frame the whole thing even the replays of armour smash ing hence the awesome screenshots! Jusb10 TRAINING MODE BUS All characters even the secret ones can be taken here to practice their full range of moves. Position the CPU stooge almost any way you like, then check the moves list to practice a technique against them. Once you've mastered a technique, an 'OK' tag appears next to it. Unfortunately the secret characters don't have a moves list, so there may still be moves we don't know about!  The CPU opponent in Training Mode can be made to run toward, edge away from, jump over, crouch and block, stand and block... anything you want really! It's so cool being able to record your own matches. Like this one where we bounced Bahn onto the top of the ring after a ko. PLAYBACK MODE 28 2010 REVIEW PERFEOTY View a selection of Exhibition Matches, which act as great tutorials, or terrible knocks to your pride as a gamesplayer depends how you look at it. Basically these prerecorded matches are the work of AM2 along with Japan's best players namely \"Ikebukuro\" Raxel, and \"Bunbun\" Maru. 1 Witness this incredible Tokio versus Jane battle, in which the Justice Viper gets a KO, juggling his opponent by removing his own armour! 1 Kuma Chan just wades right in there to pick Sanman off the floor, then shakes him around like a rag doll until he gives up the ghost. 54 "


"computer Video games COMMENT UNBELIEVABLE SECRET CHARACTERS We are still trying to fathom all of their moves, so expect to see a complete listing sometime soon in Freeplay (anyway we're running out of room here!). Meantime, take a peak at the strange new recruits available to dedicated players. EGA SATURN In my opinion, AM2's Virtua Fighter games are the best 3D beat 'em ups around, with Fighting Vipers coming very close behind. While it's very easy to get into, it's got almost as much to it as the VF games, meaning that it takes a long time to truly master. As Paul says, the Saturn version is initially disappointing, what with the graphics and sound being a bit feeble, but after a bit of play you'll forget that you're not playing the arcade game! On top of playing like the arcade original, there are at least six extra characters and some excellent enhancements new moves, modes, combos) to reward dedicated players. If you like the arcade game at all get it. Everyone else get it. PEPSI MAN SCHOOL GAL HONEY Beat the game on NORMAL setting using Honey to find her in Versus mode wearing a tartan mini, and sailor's shirt. Lovely, but no extra moves. Due to strict licensing agreements which don't extend outside of Japan, the zany Pepsi Man character will not feature in the UK or US version of Vipers. A shame really as he adds a touch of humour, and is pretty cool to play. Case you're still interested, PM shares moves with most Vipers. That's not a lazy comment, it's true! COMMENT MAHLER/ BM Apparently the same at first glance BUT look closer and you'll notice that BM is much bigger than his little brother. They both use monster PPK combos. UKELELE HONEY COUTINE Beating the game on HARD setting with Honey earns you the chance to play as her in a holiday mood. Armed with a ukelele she practices some of Raxel's moves. AM2's games are always of exceptional quality, and there was never any doubt that Fighting Vipers was going to be totally brilliant. Admittedly, it is rough around the edges, but when you consider what this game is doing, I'm amazed it's on the Saturn at all. And gameplay-wise, it is ALL there! It's perhaps not as intricate a fighting game as VF2, but it's definitely the most versatile I've ever played. The sheer speed, as you run, jump, bounce off walls, smash people across the arena, creates an exhilaration unseen in any other 3D beat 'em up. And with the Hyper Mode it's even nuttier, with the added dimension of dodge moves! This game is an essential Saturn game, even if you have VF2. TOM CULSE KUMA CHAN REVIEWER Literally translated as 'little bear', it seems nobody in the world knows the exact conditions for finding him. But everybody seems to do it! Fights like Sanman. REVENGE OF THE \"?????????\" Saturn fans should know about the intriguing ???????s in the special options of Panzer Dragoon Zwei. Each one mask ing a cool hidden option. Well it's back!!! Once you have Pepsi Man, you can reset' him (meaning he makes a surprise BIG HEADS AND FEETI WITHOUT WALLS Promised you this was going to be good! Well, to begin with, I was underwhelmed at this slightly scruffy-looking imitation of Fighting Vipers. Even after playing the game for a full evening, I felt like I was heading for a let down. Then I spent more time with it, considered exactly what was going on with my Saturn, and realised that Saturn Fighting Vipers is one very special item. To get my major reservations out of the way first: The Al is pretty stupid it doesn't 'learn' the same way as VF2. So I managed to skank my way through Very Hard mode using one or two basic tactics. There is also slowdown whenever Honey is around, especially when she's fighting Picky or Raxel. So why the High Five? Well this is much more than a straight translation, as the arranged versions demonstrate. It's thrilling to know that the Saturn game has been developed to improve on all the coin-op has to offer, bringing whole new sets of techniques and entertaining new characters to the mix. Your Saturn's naked without TPM. DAVIESI Complete the game with every single character including the secret ones and you'll get to choose big heads and feet for all the fighters. Very weird! Master all the moves for three of the Vipers in Training Mode and the option to make the walls invisible makes itself. err... visible! REVIEW 1 . ] RATING BATING 660 Surpasses all expectations. AM2 have given us the arcade game, PLUS arranged versions which play much better! The coolest secrets too!! 55 "

It's so much more. personal. YEEE-HAARGH! PlayStation ALITOURED OVERKILL ass slaughter is just about the worst party anyone could be invited to. But for a video game we guess KCEC assume its okay. Anyway, we're talking about colonies of beings who'd just as soon pull the same trick on you. So no worries. You now have a clear conscience. With four crack mercenaries, of varying sex and intergalactic race, it is your mission to \"unpopulate» planets which may support the further development of the Terracom Corporation.Gameplay is centred solely around weapons tactics, and lighting reflexes. But Konami introduce a strategic element through the balance of the four mercs, and the development of their weapons. Familiar, yes. Easy, most definitely not. KREEG ALTHER JENORSK ALTER PATH PICK OPTION NET OVERKILL SESTRE LPCEDIT ELECT use DSED DOOOD Erm... first screenshot of the day, you understand. We did better next time! SHOULD YOU ACCEPTIT GUNNING FOR THE GALAXY Success depends in no small way on the merc chosen for each mission. So it's wise to become familiar with the four guys' strengths and weaknesses early on. To highlight just how much this can make a difference, here are some examples. Before embarking on the first or any subsequent missions the Terracom Corp briefs its team with an objective. From this point players choose the most appropriate merc for the job, taking into consideration agility, strength, versatility, and stealth ratings. As the mercs complete each mission, new areas are opened, and it is from here that the route is chosen. Unfortunately revisiting an area after the main objective has been accomplished isn't possible. LANSLOW KREEG Earthling Armsman QUOGG S'SETHNON Saurian Infantry AL THEA TIMMERON Transhuman Demolitions Expert JENDRYK EPSILON Kykarian Assassin REVIEW Kreeg is reported to have taken mind-altering drugs to increase aggression. And, as a weapons expert, this guy takes charge of the coolest weapon in the game: The Auto Turret similar to those in the film *Aliens'. A heavy duty fighter. Even when low on ammo, the Saurian is not at a loss, as he can crush an enemy's head with the butt of his Chain Gun. For players know what they're about, Quogg deals focused damage quicker than anyone. Three of Althea's four weapons are incendiary-based, meaning that they cause widespread damage which creates confusion. Explosions damage many but kill few, so there is a lot of cleaning up' to do. Stealth is almost as useful as the mightiest weapon in Project Overkill. So players should select Jendryk to make a more tactical killing. The assassin's weapons buy time to wreak havoc. 1 Handrawn visuals set the scene.

"BALANCE OF POWER TERRACOM CALLING computer video games Your team increases its effectiveness according to success in the field. Physically they remain the same, but it is essential to keep them in good health and well armed. Losing one of the mercs is the same as losing one life in any other game, only more destructive because they take with them all the power-ups you have been collecting. This is why its best to alternate between characters, so as to build their inventory and subject them to less damage in the long term. It's terrible to find yourself past the halfway mark of the long-term mission, with Althea still operating with just her Class One, Semi-Auto rifle! Remember, you need to play this game strategically as much as anything else. Mission zones are presented as a series of rooms, linked by doorways and corridors; sometimes ramps or stairs to different storeys. But not all exits/ entrances are obvious some are hidden. And it is this variety which provide the biggest bounty. Tell-tale signs are in the design on the walls or surrounding area. For example some surfaces are adorned by air vents, occupying a central area. Wherever these vents reach the floor, most likely your guy can break through to the other side. Quogg is especially useful at finding these, due to his power. TM PlayStation Bombs are a quick way to blow away secret walls. SER RUTIES As Kreeg heads down to a lower level, the floor and walls turn transparent. A transporter lies in this secret room, leading to some powerups.

Mindless violence in games can be a sorry cover up for poor gameplay in many cases. But the entire Project Overkill concept is far from being so cheap. Players who loved Smash TV and Total Carnage in the arcade will warm to the frenetic action in no time at all. But the thrill of cutting down hordes of enemies is made infinitely more satisfying because they are intelligent enough to make an effective comeback. Consequently it's important to consider the right weapon, and at the right time. It's also surprising to discover that the four mercs are better at some tasks than others this isn't variety for variety's sake. Plus there's a degree of satisfaction gained from having developed a well armed team, as opposed to struggling through with one merc and one set of tactics. Even if Overkill were to look and sound quite poor, the intelligent gameplay would assure its success. However the character design, animation, and sonic calibre is exceptional. What more do you want blood? PAUL DAVIES Head blasted! Blood splashes on the walls behind the victims! Walk over a corpse to leave bloodied footprints! REVIEW SATURN OVERKILL? Sega fans are still due their version of this excellent game, but the release date has been set back to March 1997 It's a long time to wait, we know, but you can expect the best possible results. ? ? RATING 57 Not every floor is safe. Stumble into a pit and that's your guy lost forever! The most blood-thirsty game to have ever been created and get away with it!

"computer video games PUZZLE GAME BY NINTENDO  GAMEBOY VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  FORMAT 8 MEG CARTRIDGE PLUS BACKUP  RELEASED BY THE TEL: 01703 653 377 TM SUPER NINTENDO OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYER STAGE SUPER NINTENDO LEVEL HARD 10'15 Don't have to bother reading the op overall on this one. We can tell you right here Tetris Attack is a High Five, no question. But if you need an explanation why, the reasons are as follows Work fast to vanish rows of panels! Make Combos and Chain Reactions to win! TETRIS ATTACK his review is dedicated to those people who know that games don't have to involve shooting, driving, or fighting to stand a chance at greatdom. Why, even by reading this brief introduction you have passed a very important CVG test: Now we know that you recognise a game with potential when you see one! In a very simple but surprisingly brilliant way Tetris Attack (previously Panel de Pon) attains the kind of greatness that deserves legendary status. Match coloured shapes to dissolve rows of Panels. But that's only the launch point for real cunning to take over... 0 CLEARING THE RUBBISH There are two major ways to gain monster satisfaction from playing Tetris Attack: Combos, in which you vanish two or more rows with one move; and Chain Reactions, in which the disappearance of one row triggers another, then another, then another... While the Combos are good for points, Chain Reactions have more devastating potential: INNOCENT WORLD Still you're looking at this game, wondering what the heck it's all about. Well, perhaps we ought to better explain the different styles: TETRIS ATTACK TIME TRIAL CPUZZLE You get just two minutes to rack up as many points as possible. Always go for combos or chain reactions to stand a chance. This time players are required to clear ten strict tasks before clearing the area. Succeed by sticking to the precise number of moves stated. The large, rectangular panels are called Garbage Blocks, which appear in Versus Mode against the computer or a second player. These drop onto the opponent's stack whenever a chain reaction is triggered, and require some fast work vanishing adjacent rows to dispose of. However, initiate a big enough chain and the other player doesn't stand a chance. STAGE CLEAR An opportunity to tour Yoshi's Island, but you can't move on until the Clear Line has been broken. Keep hard at it until this appears. REVIEWER SELECT STAGE O Conce ONE PLAYER ATTACK ? ? ? ? In which it's just you versus the CPU. Perform well to save your name in the High Score chart! SODA ME ENDLES Pitch your wits against Bowser's CPU controlled cronies, one by one until you come to tackle the sorcerer himself. If you complete the game on the hardest setting you can choose to play as Bowser, and his three main assistants Kamek, etc. Features the dreaded Garbage Blocks! SELECT STAGE !  Here is one of those great games that is worth playing just for playing's sake; which can be treated as a lengthy oneplayer challenge, or the perfect testing ground for skills in a two-player contest. Matching shapes might seem unappealing, for all kinds of reasons: it's boring; a girl's game: old fashioned; or even 'there's no point'. Well forget all that! I can't think of a better way to get a real buzz from intense concentration on a video game, while still having a laugh putting a bunch of sad mates in their place (or not, if they happen to be better than you!). Practising Combos and Chain Reactions for hours really pays dividends, and the better you get, the more you find yourself admiring your great taste in games. If you own a Super NES, and still get lots of hours enjoyment from playing it, Tetris Attack is a game you just have to own. PAUL DAVIES Keep matching those panels and disappearing rows, struggling to maintain control as the CPU increases the speed of the stack GRECO Tetris Attack used to be a game called Panel de Pon. TWO-PLAYER ATTACK! REVIEW HUGAVE STAGE 12 EVE For the ultimate joy gained from playing Tetris Attack, you need to find a friend to compete with. Two-player mode offers both a Time Attack and Versus option. The latter is far and away the best two-player puzzle action available anywhere!

The whole package is near enough perfectly done some of the best graphics we've seen on the PlayStation, the incredible soundtrack, and the excellent presentation make it a very cool game to play. The ships handle even better than in the first game, with more variation to the courses, as each is designed with a specific class of ship in mind. The new class system works well, giving more to come back to than the straight race through of the first game. But what makes Wipeout 2097 one of the best PlayStation games is the overall experience of the ultra-smooth graphics and gameplay put together with brilliant presentation. It's my favourite PlayStation game, other than SFZ2, and it's a game which everyone should get without thinking twice especially those with the first one.

For example, flares to light up dark areas, bombs to break through shielded enemies, and massive nukes which destroy everything. LET THERE BE MORE LIGHT! As is pretty obvious from the screenshots, Tunnel B1 is one of the most amazing-looking games ever! All of the tunnels are detailed 3D, and they move around ultrasmoothly but the most impressive part is the lightsourcing! All of the lights around the level make coloured tints on the walls and floor, and all the explosions and lasers cause lens flares, making everything look incredible!

Just look at this explosion it's incredible! And that picture on the left! Wow! ERK! WATCH OUT! REVIEWER BU TUNNEL Most of the enemies in Tunnel B1 are made up of fixed sentry guns which are positioned to guard mission objectives, pressure pads, or other useful areas. Other things to avoid include evil gliders which follow you about; helicopters; giant tanks; and big gliders which race away when they spot you, but are worth catching for the supplies inside them. All of the enemies explode in a shower of lighting effects and polygon chunks of metal, and some leave behind weapon power-ups. Lovely! SIR Anyone who's seen Tunnel B1 running must admit that it's one of the most impressive games they've ever watched, as the smooth motion and lighting effects are truly awesome. But anyone who's actually played it for any length of time must surely feel very let down. From the start of the game you are, required to go to a certain point and collect or destroy something, avoiding the laser tripods around the level, and it doesn't develop from there onwards. The whole game is just trundling around tunnels, destroying the occasional dull enemy and that can't be anyone's idea of fun. Another annoying thing is the way that the view is set up so that it's looking slightly upwards, and there's no way of changing that your self. There are 11 levels, all of which are very similar, but they can get very tough mostly because of the extremely damaging enemy attacks. The thing is, with a game this boring, no-one's going to want to put in the effort to get through the tough stages, and that means it's a waste of money. Don't even bother with \"try before you buy\" it'll bore your brains out. EN LOMAS STUNNING ON SATURN? Most of the pictures on these pages are of the PlayStation version, mainly because it looks a lot prettier than the Saturn version. Tunnel B1 was originally developed for the PlayStation, and the conversion to Saturn hasn't worked too well while the graphics are smooth, the lighting effects and the explosions all look very rough, ruining the best feature of the game. But it still plays just the same as the PS version, whether that's a good thing or not. REVIEW RATING As you can see, the explosions on the Saturn version are pretty feeble. They look like big puffy orange sponges rather than flames. Now we know what the \"B\" in Tunnel B1 stands for boring. It looks beautiful, but is no fun at all to play. 63 u buy it.

Scorched Planet is another 3D blaster for the PC. No, wait, don't turn over! This one's different! It's based on the Godfather of shoot 'em ups — Defender. ESCORCHED PLANET Here you are nose-diving to get through the drop-off rings on the far side of the town. sk any serious gamer to name their top ten games, and chances are Defender will feature highly. If not, it ought to. Defender is an unmitigated classic that has stood the test of time, and is truly worthy of its legendary status. With Scorched Planet, Criterion Studios have attempted to update Eugene Jarvis' masterpiece for the 90s replacing line graphics with 3D polygons; simplistic FX with an interactive soundtrack, and bolstering Defender's admittedly simplistic gameplay with a subtle element of strategy. It sounds like a sure-fire recipe for success, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Let's have a hearty helping of Scorched Planet, shall we? SCORCHED PLANET Simply hit the END key at any time to morph your vehicle! On later levels, fuel is in short supply, so you can't just fly everywhere. You must choose your moments carefully. When you morph your craft actually changes onscreen! *** MORPHENOMENAL! *** One of the main differences between Defender and Scorched Planet is the capabilities of your craft. In Scorched Planet you pilot a Type 16 morphing vehicle a fast manoeuvrable fighter-aircraft which can morph at will into a heavily armoured ground based tank-buggy. As the the tank you collect humans and power ups, and withstand more hits. As the aircraft you cross terrain quicker, and combat the Voraxian airborne forces more competently, though you also have a fuel level to worry about. Knowing which craft to use in which situation is crucial to succeeding in Scorched Planet! POZA 89 WON OOO040 REVIEW ** CITIZENS! *** Like Defender, your aim in Scorched Planet is to defend the planet's civilians from the attacking aliens. Flying meanies will attempt to pick up and fly off with the colonists, and its up to you to stop them. There are also elements of Choplifter in there too, as once you've collected a shipful of colonists (you can only hold 5) you must return to your spacegate to drop them off. A level is completed when the required amount of civilians have been teleported to safety. 64 Jators ping celo "


"* *LETS KICK SOME ASS!'*** computer video games 22 Unlike Defender, the colonists in Scorched Planet actually serve a function. By deploying a \"City Beacon' you can get all the nearby colonists to congregate in one area and form a base. There are two types of colonist: civilians and soldiers, and each occupy a different, but equally helpful role. Civilians will forage for items and powerups, dragging them back to the city beacon for easy collection, while Soldiers will actually engage the enemy. You can even drop gun turrets for the soldiers to operate, giving your base extra defence against the Voraxian forces.

A deployed soldier mans a gun turret that you have just placed. These provide more firepower than the soldiers ordinary gun. SCORCHED PLANET **SOFT MANFLESH TASTE GO0000D! ** REVIEWER On later stages you come up against even more ferocious creatures, such as killer wasps, fire breathing dragons and the hideous ground-based giant spider beast! Unless stopped, these biomechanical monstrosities head for settlements and cocoon your colonists, turning them into rotting green zombies who hunger for soft manflesh! A zombie will then march off around the camp, infecting all other colonists he comes into contact with, before heading off across the desert to find another colony. Your only hope is to destroy the spider beast, collect the anti-venom beacon it releases, and deploy it in an infected area. The zombies are attracted to the beacon, then cured! Hurrah! 3D Defender! What a brilliant idea! Scorched Planet looks good, sounds good and adds a welcome element of strategy to the usual simplistic blasting formula. Plus it's networkable. Unfortunately, Scorched Planet falls down on the one crucial factor that made Defender such a success: the control system. In Defender you had total control over your craft, and it responded to your commands instantly. By contrast, both of the craft in Scorched Planet are incredibly frustrating to control. Criterion Studios have attempted to authentically convert the 2D control system of Defender to 3D, with mixed results. There's no strafing, no reverse, an irritating acceleration button and painfully slow non-analogue turning, meaning a reliance on the infamous 180 flip button. You do get used to it, but you never feel you have the same sense of control that you had in Defender, or even other games of this genre. Which is a shame really, because it could have been something special. VAO JEVONS The top down view (above), behind the vehicle (above left), isometric (left) and inside (bottom left). They all have there individual uses. MELAST ITS IN FREE DEE! RATING RATING Scorched Planet makes use of an impressive 3D graphics engine that shifts the perspectively textured polygon mesh terrain around at high speeds, even in hi-res. All of the objects in Scorched Planet are real 3D characters (not sprites!), and so look cool from any angle. To this end, Criterion Studios have added a variety of different camera angles from which the game can be played, though only a couple of them are actually useful. Here's a look...

SINODE EG0000000 00000ALLIS SMOOTH MOVESI Worldwide Soccer's graphics are excellent, especially the animation of the players as they all move around very realistically and perform loads of different moves. Even when just turning around, the players drag the ball back through their legs and spin like real players! There are also a few extra special moves: When a goal is scored, the scoreboard in the main stand plays a short animation to celebrate.

BLOOMING BRILLIANTI SATURN Just about every single British football commentator seems to have done a game by now, and now Football Italia's Gary Bloom can be added to the list as well. Mr Bloom keeps up with the play fairly well, but doesn't say the names of all the players which is a good thing, as the player names can be edited if you want. As always, it gets a bit repetitive but adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game. A cowboy shouts \"Goal!\" and his horse bites him on the bum to celebrate good play. REVIEW yoshi On A YELLOW CARD.

"ZOOM ACTIVATEDI computer video games LETS SEE THAT AGANI AND O AGAIN AND AGAN O While the default setting has the view going up the pitch like the first Victory Goal, it's possible to change this. You can spin the view to the side and play like Virtua Striker, or have it at an angle like FIFA! You can also choose how close to the pitch the view should be! The replay feature is actually quite important to most people in a football game when you score a brilliant goal you want to watch it 20 times over again, right? Worldwide Soccer's replay mode is perfectly fine for this, letting you rotate the view, zoom in and out, and generally annoy whoever you just scored against! And because of the excellent graphics, nearly every goal looks brilliant in the replay mode! SATURN 1st 5:41 1 Poland's star player makes a run at goal, just keeping ahead of the defender chasing him.

The angled view can be pointing towards either goal, but is a little tricky to play with. ist 917 REVIEWER WORLD WIDE WORLD LEAGUE FVHIRITION CUP Oprons SISDOTOLT PLAYERS EDU EXHIBITION: A The side-on view makes the game look even more like Virtua Striker when zoomed in. There are plenty of different modes, including a league, world cup, tournament, and penalty shoot-out. While football games are always very popular, there's still not been one which plays much like real football. They nearly always involve running straight at the goal and shooting from outside the area, and never really require much passing around. While Sega Worldwide Soccer '97 doesn't change this completely, it's probably the most enjoyable arcade-style football game yet. The controls are simple, yet they work really well, giving, players moves to learn so that they improve with each game. It takes quite a while to master, but is well worth the effort, as it becomes even more fun with time. I've actually been playing the game for months since we got the Japanese import version, and I still think it's excellent.

BURNING ROAD YOU PLAYED 5TH! CAMERA ANGLES! e've been eagerly waiting for this game since we first saw it over half a year ago. And the reason we've been so expectant is the same reason some people have criticised it for being a blatant rip-off of Daytona USA (among other famous driving games). An exercise in plagiarism it may be, but let's face it, Daytona on PlayStation would be extremely cool. And considering that's never gonna happen, a copycat game is surely the next best thing. What's more, it provides an answer to one of the biggest Saturn Vs PlayStation arguments of all could the PlayStation do a better job of Daytona than Saturn? So... can it? Excuse their French, but that's a poor translation of Daytona's postlap autopsy. Even accompanied by a voice-over. Watch how the view zooms down on the car at the starting grid. Fender-level replay views too. It's all the same! REPLAY RACE LEADER SIGN! THE RADAR! LA RACE LEADER SEPARATED AT BIRTH! We don't use the term BLATANT RIP-OFF lightly. Ho no. But hey, judge for yourself with our ten-point blatant rip-off rundown. Perfectly matches the neon indicator that flashes above the screens on the multi-link Daytona coin-ops. Oh c'mon! It's appeared in no other game except Daytona. TOTAL COPY! URAFCI S= 0 COURSE SELECT SCREEN! CRASHING! 33 REVIEWER SELECT YOUR RACE Three tracks, complete with \"Please select a Race Course\" stylee speak. Although it's in a dreadful French accent. External view of car flipping madly off the road. IDENTICAL to Daytona. It's very impressive in-yer-face stuff, though. SUN LAPS TRANSMISSION SELECT! OBSTACLES! SELECT YOUR CAR \"Manual or Automatic transmission.\" There's a guitartwang select sound, followed by a revving engine and static loading screen. 21 88 Wanna line of traffic cones? You get 'em. Barricades too. And dustbins. Okay, so they weren't in Daytona. So, could the PlayStation do Daytona better than the Saturn? From this, it would seem yes. Awesome graphics, with chunky-textured mountains, buildings and tunnels sliding past. The clipping is minuscule compared to Daytona's. Brilliant light-sourcing too, especially on the street level. Most impressive though, the car really feels weighty. Smashing other vehicles you almost feel you're getting feedback from the joypad. However, while it's a superb demo of the PlayStation's ability to do Daytona, the game ISN'T as good as AM2's masterpiece. In Daytona every corner was memorable. These tracks seem cobbled together. \"Oh there's some windmills, oh now it's snowing etc.\" Also, getting first place isn't a case of mastering the course, Do well on a couple of corners and you're in the lead. Hit a dustbin and you're down in 5th. It's fun and a great PS showcase, but both Ridge Racers are far superior racing games. TOM GULSE MAX SPEED 262 ROAD HOLDING REVIEW MULTIPLE VIEWS! THE FIRST TRACK! RATING Five different driving viewpoints. Four of which are identical to Daytona's. And one more which is pretty much redundant. It's so similar to Dinosaur Canyon especially the curve leading up to the tunnel. RATING 6600 A technically excellent racer which superbly mimmicks features of Daytona, but lacks its imagination and fine-tuned brilliance.  "

RELEASED BY SONY TEL: 0171 447 1600 PlayStation He rooty, he's tooty, he's Kerashy Bandycahooty and welcome to his all-new platform show! Hyuk hyuk, th-th-that's me, folks! BANDICOOT, et's face it, Crash Bandicoot is a disgraceful looking character. He's a moronic, illproportioned, man-like animalthing. He symbolises everything we detest about despicable platform bumph. And yet, sticking Crash in the Bubsy /Rayman/ Cool Spot bargain bucket is a mistake. You see, he's not as stupid as he looks. In fact, his is a very calculated game. Almost cynically so. His creators, Naughty Dog, have created his game specifically to succeed. Every classic element of a platformer has been incorporated and fleshed out with stunning graphics. And the gameplay has been perfectly tuned. With Sony's guaranteed marketing juggernaut behind it, everyone's gonna love him! We should know. From sneering at his ugly googlyeyed mug, we've warmed to him. And we can't deny his game is very clever indeed. Boy, we feel dirty. FUNKY CHARACTERS! PV BANDICOOT Love 'em or loathe 'em, Crash's characters all have a familiar quirky style. By their own admittance, Naughty Dog's artists have been strongly influenced by the Warner Brothers' cartoons. However, all the characters have a distinctive polygonal look as a result of them being fully 3D generated. In fact, the excellent intro is all generated in real time. HOW TO CRASH THE WORLD OF PLATFORIA GAMES! Okay. YOU are Naughty Dog. Sony want YOU to make them a successful platform game for the PlayStation. How do you go about it? Well, with the benefit of the final product here in front of us, here are the key elements to Crash's success. PAPU PADU LIPPER ROO! LKOALA KONG! KER-AZY PLOTSKI! Don't expect anything ground-breaking here! Standard issue evil professor Neo Cortex is experimenting on animals to make them into, gasp, super animals! But while testing Crash, the machine malfunctions and he escapes (with powers, of course)! Now he has to get back to the laboratory before they grow a human ear on the back of his girlfriend. BANDICOOT 1.6 ADOIS danos CATCHY BANDICOOT ABILITIES Spinning or jumping can be used to clear foes out the way. Some may call him unoriginal, Naughty Dog would probably use the word 'familiar'. Whatever term you use, Crash's abilities should be instantly recognisable to platform gamers. Aside from the obvious running and jumping, he has a Tasmanian Devil style spin which, while making him indestructible, destroys any baddies it connects with. His other ability is, obviously, stomping on enemies heads. This can be combined with the spin for guaranteed results. Or utilised to break open crates. Ah, what a versatile little pup! TASMANIAN DEVIL-STYLE SPIN! HEAD-STOMPING! 70 "


"computer video games FINGS WOT YOO COLLECT! It's a platform game. So, you've got to collect things, right? Right! There's a variety of collectable things to look out for in Crash. And in traditional platform game review-stylee, we're going to list 'em for ya! PlayStation VER APPLES CRATES MASKS He's a bandicoot, so he collects apples. Ha, of course! Anyway, these fruits (bizarrely scattered in weird formations around the islands) serve no other purpose than giving him an extra life for every 100 collected. That's nothing to be scoffed (ho ho snort) at though, as you need every one you can get. Mostly containing apples (see exciting boxout labelled 'apples'), although some have extra lives and shields (see also other exciting item boxouts). Crates are THE most important things on each level. Only by smashing EVERY one on each level, do you get a Perfect. More later (look for exciting boxout labelled Hidden Stuff!). African-style masks, when collected, float around Crash and allow him to absorb one hit. As more masks are collected, so they add to his protection. Collect three-in-a-row and Crash puts the mask on turning him indestructible for a short time. There are three types of head to look out for. Crash Bandicoot heads are extra lives Next up are Tawna (Crash's girlfriend) heads. Three of these transport Crash to a bonus stage. More rare are Neo Cortex heads. Three of these give Crash a shot at an extra tough form of bonus stage. HEADS He's got three Tawna heads. Yeehaaa! All he's got to do is get to the exit at the far right. Getting the crates on these stages too, is essential for a Perfect! BANDICOOT CRASH LGAJE POSITION! At the end of a bonus stage, you get your only chance to save your progress through the game. So, each time you face one it's a dilemma. Do you play it safe and get to the end, or play like a bandicoot master and get all the crates? Adois cano) Everything about the graphics in Crash is amazing. The 3D surroundings, the lighting, even the detail on those bats has been crafted to perfection. 71 "


"computer video games THE SPICE OF LIFE! Crash Bandicoot rips off every trick in the platform handbook. But hey, that's a fair smattering of tricks. Variety on the basic gaming formula is something Crash does have on its side. PlayStation VPH The first stages set up Crash's basic into-the-screen 3D gameplay. Later levels seem him running out of the screen. Clever, eh? Ooh, back into-the-screen. This time on a pig! Ingenious. Side-scrolling levels give the game a more traditional feel... 1 ...except Crash can still move fully in any direction. Over the fence he goes! Later on, multi-directional stages provide the toughest challenge! A SENSE OF HUMOUR! Yes, the game does make you laugh, although whether some of the game's humour is intentional is not clear. Here's a few of the game's funnier moments. Svu BANDICOOT CRASH EXPLODING! CRASH FRYING! His eyes humourously fall to the ground and roll around to stare at you. Heh. Whereupon he crumbles into toast crumbs. Actually not so funny, come to think about it. do. SENO) YOU WANNA RIDE A PEEG? Hilarious twinkle of eyebrows before he mounts the rampant beast. The level ends as he enters a hut and a curtain drops. Cue pig squeal. Dunno what it all means! M . 72 Moving walls and spinning steps. Just a few of the hazards! "


"computer video games COMMENT AWESOME GRAPHICS! One of Crash's most appealing factors is its stunning graphics, transforming what would be ordinary gaming sections into spectacular set-pieces. Don't expect to see this game on any other system, it's clearly been designed with the PlayStation's power totally in mind. PlayStation While there's nothing particularly amazing about Crash Bandicoot other than the graphics it's strangely fun. In fact, it's one of the most basic games around, featuring jumping over holes and breaking boxes... and not much else. But it's the jumping over holes that makes it kinda fun. There's no freedom of movement, and it's not a partic ularly inventive game at all, but it's got well-placed platforms which will drive you mad! The one badly done thing is the way that camera in the \"into-the-screen\" sections is fixed to the scenery, not Crash, making some jumps difficult to judge. In my opinion, it's a bit too basic and slow to make me want to spend loads of money on it, but it's well worth trying. E'D LAMASI COMMENT HIDDEN STUFF! Essential for giving the game that all-important 'replay value'. As mentioned earlier (see thrilling Crates boxout, cootsters), you need to smash every crate on each level to get a Perfect. However, even if you try your very best you'll find, when you finish the game, you only have around 60% of the game complete. That's because there are hidden sections accessible only by locating gems. These gems transport Crash to unreachable parts of stages, some of which contain the rest of the crates. Getting Perfects gives you special white gems and keys which are essential for reaching the 'true' ending to the game. But that's another story. BIPFWS SOO A bog-standard platform game, boosted by phenomenal hardware. No more, no less but I like it lots. Naughty Dog make no bones about it: the Bandicoot is an intense traditional platformer with 3D overtones. So linear that many stages are best com, pleted by just 'going for it', without stop ping to see what's left behind. Predictable too, otherwise such bold tactics would not be possible. Even next to Mario 64 I'd say Crash is the best-looking platform game to date. The textures are insanely detailed, and the special effects flames, coloured flares, etc -are fantastic too. Question is, do I really need to prove to myself that I can meet the challenge of attaining 100%? Probably not. Technically brilliant in every way, and a real tease! PAUL DAVIES The impressive 3D map shows the game's three islands. You can travel back to any stage previously completed, for extra lives or to score a Perfect on it! See that glint there. Find the correct gems, and they turn into solid gem-stepping stones, allowing you to reach a hidden section of the level. There's another hidden gem. Find it and you can reach that crate in the topright. Only getting up there can allow you to get all the crates and score a Perfect! BANDICOOT REVIEWER It's a credit to Crash Bandicoot's quality that (in this office anyway) it's shifted from being a subject of derision to being respected as a very good game. The first thing that leaves a lasting impression are the graphics. They are undeniably awesome! From the 3D scenery scrolling past on the early levels, to later textures on backdrops and fantastic lighting effects, it all looks so convincingly solid. With visuals like this, even if the game was quite standard underneath, it would be impressive. A good thing then, cos it IS standard stuff, although tuned up in a razor-sharp way. The typical platform elements have been so precisely placed, giving the game a real skill-testing edge. Excellently graded gameplay, but to be honest, it's perhaps too technical for me. On PlayStation I prefer the lighter fun of Jumping Flash 2 (I think it's more unique too). But that game is too easy and Crash provides a lot more game. In many ways Crash is exactly what Sonic would be if he were on PlayStation Graphically superb, technically perfect and surgically challenging, but not so cuddly to play. Flawless, but per haps a bit charmless too. ADOIS dano) TOM GULSE RATING RATING Every ingredient from the platform cookbook, perfectly fitted in place with fantastic graphics to match. It's like the Terminator of platform games. 73 "

NES-R FLICKYS ISLAND DANS 4 ow many times have people said that the Mega Drive is dead, only to be surprised when an impressive and top-quality game appears? Sonic 3D is the latest of these «surprises», proving that the Mega Drive can keep up with the current trend for 3D platform games. And it's even got a new style of play for a Sonic game, almost entirely forgetting the original's \"run to the right» play. SONIC 3D FLICKYS ISLAND One of the biggest surprises in Sonic 3D is the rendered introduction sequence when you turn the game on. While it's not particularly good quality when compared to those on the 32-bit CD machines, it's by far the best on a 16-bit machine! It shows a 3D Sonic running through the Green Grove Zone surrounded by some equally 3D Flickies! There's also a greatlooking story sequence at the start of the first zone, explaining exactly what Sonic needs to do. CONTROL STARTS SOLO TEST RINGS THE FLAMING FLICKIES NO BOTHIK LEARNS ABOUT THE FLICKIES. The basic idea of the game is to lead the Flickies to their warp rings in order to progress through the levels, but this often isn't as easy as it should be. When leading a line of five at once, a shot from a badnik can scatter your Flickies all over the place, and some are very tricky to collect. For example, the blue Flickies hang around you, the green Flickies rush off around the level, the purple Flickies wander off on their own, and the red Flickies bounce around, making them very difficult to catch. HET ENEO Elche These screens tell the story of the Flickies. The rendered characters look brilliant. 20 RINGS WHAT'S IN THE BOX? Migl THE TEL: 0251c'&#2HP M hc 1 All of the scenes moves as well.

As ever, they need to be jumped on or spun into to release the power-up. The old favourites are still here the Super Ring, Speed Sneakers, Invincibility, and One-hit Shield, as well as a few more. These include the Fire Shield which not only makes Sonic impervious to flames and lava, but also lets him drop to the ground quickly by pressing the jump button twice. Most of the time, Knuckles and Tails are hiding around the stages, waiting to be discovered by Sonic. They'll normally give him access to the Special Stages, but occasionally they must be payed 50 rings before they let Sonic pass. Como 99 E thông 74 "


"computer VIDEO ACTING UP games BONUS TIME START! O O OO There are now seven full zones, plus a final boss zone, and each main zone is made up of three acts. Each of these acts is subdivided into between two and four sub sections, meaning that there's absolutely loads to do before the game's finished. The zones also have typically \"Sonic\" names, like the Green Grove Zone, the Gene Gadget Zone and the Panic Puppet Zone. Some of the things to be added since our Coming Soon feature last issue are the Special Stages. To get to these stages, the player needs to find either Tails or Knuckles hidden around the level, then take a total of at least 50 rings to them. Once this amount is reached, the familiar warp takes Sonic to a 3D into-the-screen running section where a set number of rings must be collected before each checkpoint. Of course, this would be extremely boring if all you did was run straight ahead, so there are also bombs littered about to make Sonic drop a few of his rings if he mistimes his jumps.

Because of this, I was looking forward to the new game, while being a bit worried as to whether the new formula would work or not. While there's a different feel to the game, and an entirely new objective, it's still great. The Sonic characters and style have been used to make something which will appeal to all fans of the series, as well as a few people who couldn't be bothered with running right all the time. The graphics are fantastic, and it's pretty remarkable to think that a Mega Drive is producing the rendered intro and super-smooth game movement. The chequered floor gets a bit repetitive after a few levels, but is necessary to be able to judge some, tricky sections correctly. It's harder than most onic games, and will take longer to complete, though there aren't as many secret sections to discover, cutting down on the replay a bit. But still, it's excellent fun, it looks and sounds brilliant, it's fast, and it's Sonic! The first essential Mega Drive game in years. ED LAMAS VOO @ Mona PINGS 12 HNESS REVIEW I'M OUTTA HERE!

Welcome to the 1997 version of my game! Let's play ball! JOHN MADDEN NFL 97 KELLY STADIUMS BNNEAPOUR ME RUTA COWBOYS TIKIANA ohn Madden came from nowhere with one of the biggest surprises to hit video games a good American football game which impressed even those who didn't know anything about the sport. There has been an updated version every year since 1990, so Madden '97 isn't much of a surprise to anyone. What is surprising, however, is that it's the best version since Madden '93! Where'd that truck come from? Wison LETS TAKE A LOOK AT THE HALFTIME STATS! It's getting a bit boring to see each and every game introduction sequence, but Madden '97's is one of the funniest and over-the-top we've seen for ages! It starts off with a floating gold ring, then a trip down a night-time street, into a massive football dome, through the middle of the Superbowl final. Then John Madden himself appears, shouts a bit, and a massive American football flies into the screen with flames and smoke pouring out the back! Awesome! NFL JOHN MADDEN NFL 97 HELL FEEL THAT ONE N THE MORNING! All of the football pitches in Madden '97 are particularly realistic. Every one of the real NFL stadia is included, from the Ravens' relatively small ground to the massive Candlestick Park. They really add to the authenticity of the official NFL license, and make the game look brilliant! REVIEWER The 16-bit Madden games are classics, as they managed to make American football games popular in the UK. I, for one, didn't know anything about the sport until i played Madden '92, then ended up staying up all night to watch the Superbowl for four years in a row! the games went downhill after '93, so it's great news to see that PlayStation Madden '97 is definitely the best for four years. It plays almost exactly the same as the others, with lots of choice additions which don't clutter the game up, and the sprite-based players keep the same graphic feel. The sound is brilliant some really clear speech samples, excellent crunching sounds and good background noises. There are also tons of teams, all the real players (each with a photo and background information), all wrapped up in some of the best presenta tion yet. Anyone who used to play Madden will love this, and even those who don't know anything about the sport should consider it as it's one of the best sport games around. Brilliant! ED LOMAS HEY! HECK OF A PLAY! REVIEW The basic play of Madden '97 is very similar to the 16-bit versions pick your play from a massive selection created by Sir Madden himself, snap the ball, and either run up-field or choose a receiver (it's now possible to have up to five receivers at once instead of just three!). The players can all perform the usual dives, spins, hurdles, and charges, as well as being able to hand off attacks, and jump to block passes, BITALS You need to select a formation, then a style, then a specific play. The complex squiggles actually show where each player is meant to go.

They have always 3100 SAIN STOR specialised in producing a sprite-based fighting game quite apart from the Capcom games, relying on intricate gameplay mechanics that novices find difficult to get to grips with. Real Bout Fatal Fury goes one up on King of Fighters '95 in the depth of play, and there's even the addition of some hilarious ring outs the best being smacking your opponent into a tube train, watching them bang helplessly on the glass windscreen as the train pulls out of the station where the fight takes place. In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Real Bout Fatal Fury, but I've always had a soft spot for the SNK genre of fighting game. However, even if you don't like them, there is much to commend Real Bout, not least the absolutely brilliant CD soundtracks. The thing is, you along with everyone else is going to be comparing this to the cheaper, higher profile Street Fighter Alpha 2 and while this is very, very good, Capcom's title has far superior graphics, a more intuitive and rewarding system of control plus a far flashier feel to it. So unless you're a rabid SNK fan, I'd probably get that instead.

Either taking themselves too seriously or trying (badly) to be humorous. The exception to these has always been LucasArts' adventures, which genuinely are funny and involving. Thankfully, Orion Burger takes after them! The plot follows earthling, Wilbur, abducted by aliens to see if the human race are stupid enough to turn into burgers. Having failed the test, he's returned to Earth. But the aliens mess up the teleport process, sending him back to before he was abducted, without erasing his memory. What follows is a Groundhog Day rip-off, as Wilbur can relive the hours leading up to his abduction, in an attempt to prepare for the alien IQ test. What makes Orion Burger appealing is its sharp style, clearly based on Hanna Barbera cartoons like Scooby Doo (Wilbur even sounds like Shaggy). What's more, it IS funny, with a real Calvin and Hobbes-style approach to sci-fi. The actual game premise is also smart, as Wilbur wanders his town attempting to crack individual problems. Fail and he returns to the alien ship and starts the day again. Each time, you learn a little more and pick up better skills and items. With a plot unfolding around all this. Orion Burger is a very good point-and-click adventure. But I stil think you've got to be a patient, lateral-thinking person to enjoy them (even the LucasArts ones).

But we were still a bit worried as to how the Saturn version would turn out, seeing as many PS-to-Saturn conversions don't come out very well. Fortunately, this is one of the best translations yet, being almost identical to the original! That means that the graphics are great nice, detailed real-time 3D which can be viewed from any angle, with an option to fly around any hole before tackling it. The players are all motion-captured, so they look very realistic in their motions. The sound is also brilliant, featur ing a commentary by Peter Alliss (\"...And there it goes, plop, into the water!\") and some nice background noises, like birds, wind and flowing water. But the best thing about Actua Golf is the way that it plays. It borrows a lot from the PGA Tour series, using a similar aiming arc and three-press power bar to do all the work, but that's no bad thing at all. The two courses may not be enough for some people, but the'll keep you going for a while, as they are very detailed and take a lot of learning. Besides, Gremlin are planning to release extra courses on sepa rate discs. There are Straight no golf games which get anywhere near to touching this on the Saturn, and it's going to take a lot of beating. It's great!

Of course, the BRE backgrounds in Virtua Fighter 3 look incredible, but the biggest thing is that they each affect the way the game plays slightly. For the first time in a one-on-one fighting game, the scenery undulates on some stages, adding to the strategy element of the game.

In the actual game, her moves are very similar to the original dance movements very gentle and graceful, yet deadly when used properly. None of her regular moves seem to have any real force behind them, looking more like gentle hits than thumps like everyone else. Her grapple moves are particularly impressive, seeing as they are possible to link together, Tekken-style, and also involve some excellent limb breaking! For example, for her high kick counter she grabs her opponent's leg, turns them around on the floor and stamps on their shoulder! Oof!

There's also an excellent heat haze effect in the distance. CHALLENGER CHORPIO 3 UINS THE MOST AMAZING FIGHTING GAME EVER! 1873) SRUN TAKA-ARACHI Unsurprisingly, Taka plays very much like every other Sumo who's ever been in a fighting game. His rapid punches and dashing slaps can be used to get close to opponents, which is where he's particularly useful. He has a big selection of extremely powerful throws, trips and grapples which are the real key to Taka mastery. He's not much of a counterattacking throw character like Wolf, who's best tactic is to wait for an opening in his foe's defence, then pound their head into the floor. Taka is far better off wading in with hits from all angles, then dodging in close to get in a grapple where he can cause far more damage. TAKA ARASHES CHILLOKEN CHOTION I VIN 155 MXN KAN This cave stage has a very bumpy floor, but there are no sections which are noticeably better to be on than others. There's a lovely fire burning in one slightly-raised corner which covers the characters with a nice orange glow, making it one of the best-looking stages.

TUTAS CHIEF CHESFIORI 2 UINS CHALLENGE 135 L AKIRA ILAH THE FIGHTERS Virtua Fighter 3 includes all of VF2's characters, as well as new fighters Taka-Arachi and Aoi. The look of the characters is very similar to the Virtua Fighter 2 rendered artwork, and they stick to the style of the series well.

For example, Shun uses more moves from the real drunk KungFu, making him completely different to Wolf with his wrestling throws and grapples. Now there's a massive difference between each character, and it only takes one play as each to figure out who is your favourite. The Virtua Fighter games have always playeddown jumping by making the characters very floaty, meaning that it's almost useless. In Virtua Fighter 3 it's a lot harder to jump by accident than before, as the command is now a quick tap of Down then Up. This also stops accidental jumping when using Up with the E button to move into the screen. CHALLENGEN CHOOTION 8 UINS CHALLENGEN.

CHORPION & UIKS CHILLENGER 1754 UU TORANAS Jeffry slams Lion up against the wall repeatedly to cause big damage. THE «E» BUTTON The main addition to Virtua Fighter 3 is the extra \"Escape\" button. It's far more than a novelty as it may first seem it's essential for turning the game into a true 3D fighter. A single tap of the button will make you character dodge around your opponent, much like Lion and Shun's moves in VF2, and the direction can be controlled by pressing Up or Down on the stick along with the button Up to move into the screen, and Down to move out. For example, if you can perfect your timing, you can use the E button to duck under and around an attack, then smack you opponent in the side of the head! One of the annoying things about VF2 has been cured as well if someone's repeatedly punching, you now don't have to stand and block the hits, instead you can dodge around them. The button is also very useful for moving around the arenas to gain the ground advantage. Some characters have throws which push their opponent up against the walls, and the E button needs to be used to move round to the right position. As Taka-Arachi goes for the grab, Pai dodges around him, ready to throw. THE MOST AMAZING FIGHTING GAME EVER! Lion jumps over his opponent, and kicks them in the head in mid-air! THE METALLIC BOSS In one-player mode, you need to beat eight of the twelve characters before facing Dural. She doesn't have her own background at the moment (maybe there will be one when the game's totally finished), instead she fights in one of the standard fighting areas. As with the other VF games, she uses moves copied from other fighters, and you only get one chance to beat her. After that, you get to enter your name by knocking over a comedy fighter made up of loads of letters : to spell out your initials! The E button, used along with the joystick, moves your character about 45 degrees around your opponent, much like Lion in VF2. Just like Jackie Chan, Shun's new  combo hits like a drunken old woman!

You then fight one round against the other team, being able to switch between fighters at any time by pressing Hard Punch and Hard Kick at the same time. This makes the new fighter jump on-screen with an attack, then pose for a split-second before continuing the fight. The fight goes on until one team has had both members knocked out. Another aspect of the team game is that there are super moves which use both fighters. By entering the command with the Hard Punch and Kick buttons, the current character will charge for their move while the second character jumps on-screen and joins in for a few seconds!

The Contra (Probotector) series from Konami is one of the most thrilling ever. Now Konami have the 32-bit updates almost ready to go. Hold onto your pants! NOW IN 3D! e expect that most 16-bit veterans own or have played Contra in some form previously. So you can understand why we're very excited about this PlayStation and, soon to be, Saturn release. This platform shoot 'em up series is known for being extremely tough, but perhaps more notably for its imaginative character design and unique gameplay features. Take this to mean big ugly bosses, and an impressive array of cool weapons and associated techniques to defeat them with. Remarkably Konami have trusted the 32bit project to a company called Appaloosa, who used to be called Novotrade. These are the people who brought you Ecco the Dolphin and Subterranea on Mega Drive. Interesting choice. Well have no fear, because Appaloosa have honoured the fine Contra tradition, and produced what appears to be the ultimate shoot 'em up (so far) for your forthcoming pleasure! A new 32-bit environment means that the old side-scrolling viewpoint has been exchanged for an isometric, 3D perspective. The battlefields, which range from Urban, through Jungle and Space, are all texture-mapped polygon. This allows for greater realism' and some dra matic viewpoints like peering over a barricade into the melee. 3D scenery also allows for interesting new tactics, such as hiding behind bushes! Most of the minor enemies are repre. sented as multi-faceted sprites, but the bosses are out in force as intricate polygon models, all of which are brilliantly animated. The situation becomes even more interesting for PlayStation owners when you learn how that version comes supplied with 3D glasses so that the game can be played in actual as opposed to perceived 3D. My eyes! My eyes!

GROUND CONTROL Here's how the Contra Force's drop ship looks armed from wing tip to wing tip. NEW GAMES E Super Probotector on Super NES wouldn't be half so much fun were it not for the fantastic level of control. In that game players can run along shooting, or fix their position in order to direct their fire in eight directions. And everyone was blown away by the innovative, top down perspective Mode 7' stages in which the shoulder buttons are used to direct the mercs. By comparison the control in 32-bit Contra is pretty standard: jump, crouch, run, shoot. However the 3D environment makes life a little bit more interesting by allowing the ability to strafe from side to side. Excitement levels are also raised by the fact that distance of objects close to or far away from the ground has a more dramatic effect there is a stronger sense of jumping over an enemy or ducking beneath a spray of bullets. Before embarking on each mission, this map shows your progress. 15 stages in all. Not especially friendly when they mean business, aren't our heroes!

They each begin the mission with a standard pulse laser, which is upgraded to a flame thrower after collecting the first powerup. After that each character carries two specialist weapons, unique to them, typically some form of homing missile/ laser and spread shot. There's also a Smart Bomb, good for a one-off super attack! In a two-player game, choose the character combination which suits you. With the boss enemies created as 3D polygon models they now boast amazing new tactics, plus all the old ones look better. Cannons mounted on a towering barricade swivel and target their lasers so smoothly. An insectoid mini-boss reaches out with tentacles, and curls into a ball before firing out a deadly shard. Another example is that the Drop Ship, which features in Super Probotector, unfolds into a precarious platform after being defeated. Even incidental enemy vehicles, such as an aircraft which attacks at the beginning of the Jungle Conflict stage, looms impressively as a detailed 3D model.

One of the most talked about features in Super Probotector is the opportunity to steal enemy vehicles and ride them around. Plus Contra specific transportation such as speeder bikes and helicopters. While such a chance isn't presented during the first couple of stages we have played, our friendly Konami representative has promised such features do exist in the 32-bit games.

The Aggressor bar has been added, the new moves are also there, Mortal Kombat 1 backgrounds are selectable, new fatalities have been created and... wait for it... there's more than one version of some characters! AGGRESSO GER Abb/ A66A 1 Rain can make lightning in a desert! 1 Here's the new dragon logo. Lovely! 1 Johnny Cage uses his Shadow Uppercut to finish Ermac off. Come on! Let's see a nice fatality! IN THE OLD DAYS.... THAT PIXEL'S A DIFFERENT SHADE, SURELY While fiddling about with PS MK Trilogy, we discovered that by highlighting some characters and pressing Select, they would transform into an earlier version of themselves! For example, it's now possible to play as Raiden from Mortal Kombat 1 or 2, or as the original Kano wearing white! And you can play as Mortal Kombat 2 Jax, so you can rip people's arms off again! Hopefully, this feature will be included in the Nintendo 64 version soon, and improved so that it covers EVERY character in the game! Awesome! The Aggressor bar is in PlayStation Mortal Kombat Trilogy now. but a fully-powered-up character looks slightly different to the N64 version. On the PS, the shadows coming from the back of an Aggressive character are red, which we actually reckon look slightly cooler than the N64's translucent trails. 1 Baraka's lovely chopping move sprays Reptile's acid blood! TOO BUSY LOOKIN' GOOD! As you can tell from the screenshots, the Nintendo 64 version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy looks excellent. The characters are as big as in the arcade version, and all of the detail of the back grounds is included. And on top of this, you need to remember that there's practically no loading time at all! Some things needed to be created especially for Mortal Kombat Trilogy, like the battle screen portraits for Baraka and Raiden, as these weren't in Mortal Kombat 2; and the running animations for characters from Mortal Kombats before the run button was added. THE 64-BIT VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT TRILOGY! YOU CAN NOT DEFEAT NE Occasionally, before fights, this secret character appears with a riddle. We don't yet know who she is, but we're going to find out!

Not many people will have seen this background, as it took great skill to be able to fight the hidden Reptile here! But look at all the dead bodies on the spikes it's disgusting!

"computer video games SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE TYPE: X FORMAT: N64 BY: LUCAS ARTS DUE: OUT DEC (JAPAN/US) PLAYERS: 1-2 View from inside the cockpit. The blue cross-hair is controlled by the 3D stick. How long have we waited for the definitive Star Wars game? Well, we have a feeling that this could be it! If you've ever dreamed of being part of the Star Wars uiverse, this is your chance. In SOTE LucasArts place you right in the thick of the action, as the player in real time 3D virtual worlds. As a member of the Rebel Alliance YOU lead attacks on Imperieal Battleships, from the cockpit of a stolen fighter. YOU take part in the infamous Battle of Hoth, as a Snowspeeder Ace, and YOU enter Xizor's Palace to confront his guards face to face. We're not exaggerating. ones which immediately soring to mind are the Snow Speeder as it whips up a storm in the Hoth Battle, chasing AT-ATs which look and move every bit as menacing as they do in The Empire Strikes Back. Sky Hook Battle is a space shoot out with Imperial Fighters who are protecting a giant Space Station. Players get to pilot the Rebel space ship, and view the action from in or out of the cockpit. Outside you can see the gun turret pumping lasers into the enemy ships, and the afterburners flare. Once you're done taking out Sky Hook's defences, a new task is set: Fly into the station and destroy the energy core! Classic stuff, and it looks absolutely amazing!!! On foot the action is no less spectacular, as your suit is equipped with a rocket pack, used to power up to ledges and nail the bad guys. I can 100 Health laser On his back is a rocket belt, which is used to fly around while firing at enemies. laser You may have heard Luke Skywalker refer to nailing Womp Rats in Beggar's Canyon? Well, SOTE invites you to take a ride on a Speeder Bike down the streets of Mos Eisley Space Port, and into that legendary canyon. This is every Star Wars fan's dream come true... Drawing from their vast expe rience in creating awesome games like Rebel Assault, XWing, and Dark Forces, LucasArts have taken the N64 and produced the closest thing to real Hollywood we have ever seen. By this we mean Aliasspecial effects, allowing amazing explosions and other atmospherics such as fog, and the way that every object in the game looks so solid, SO REAL.

As it is, Jago, Kim, Maya, Tusk fight in the centre plane, as 3D objects pass close to the foreground and scale away in the background. These real time arenas are all quite stunning, and it appears as with K12 in the arcade fighters can interact a little with some foreground objects. A Candelabra in Sabrewulf's hall rocks back and forth when hit. Crates may also be smashed, and so on. Practice, and Training. At the other end of the scale, Rare open up the game to allow players to custom manage what appears to be ALL of the game's special features Two option screens, compris ing of around ten features each allow players to switch Autodoubles on/ off, Easy Breakers on/off, Missiles on/off, Blocking on/ off... and so it goes on! Fatalities (No Mercies) are as outrageous as ever: Fulgore leaps six feet in the air to unleash multiple laser beam attacks; TJ Whips out a machine gun to drill his opponent full of holes; Glacius encases peo ple in a block of ice. Love it or loath it, Killer Instinct is MASSIVE in certain parts of the world, and Rare have excelled themselves by producing the ultimate version of Kl for the home. Fair to say that any attempt to stray from such a winning formula ie rewriting Kl as a Vestyle 3D fighter would be taking quite a risk. So Rare have made damn sure that the N64 game has enough extras and special touches bolted onto it to make it a guaranteed success. in almost every way, KI Gold is superior to any previous incarnation. All that is missing are the extensive CG cut sequences. But the extra tactics inluded are a worthy trade off. The game features all the characters from Killer Instinct 2 in the arcade, who are selectable in a choice of colours significant because there is a special Gold version of each. Check out TJ Combo here, and see for yourself. Fights are presented as pre-rendered 2D sprites, against impressive 3D backdrops. When you see these being shifted about with such ease, you know WAVE RACE FEATURENEXT ISSUE! Shortly after we close this issue, WaveRace 64 goes on sale in Japan and the US. Meaning that we can bring a full-blown resume to issue #181 for your drooling pleasure. We'll also bring more news from the Rare camp on KI Gold. At its most basic, KI Gold offers five modes of play: Arcade, Team, Team Elmiiniation, Tournament, 89 "


"computer video games CESA PRESENTS NEW GAMES Every major developer except Nintendo who hold their own show in November attended the Tokyo Game Show, making it the most significant event in the Japanese video game calendar. TOKYO GAME SHOW 1996 DATE: 22-24 AUGUST 1996 VENUE: TOKYO \"BIGSIGHT\" INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION CENTRE 1996 TOKYOGAMESHOW g SPECIAL REPORT VECTREBARBOSA o give you some idea of scale, the BIGSIGHT's main hall is 17, 200 square meters huge, but even this proved to be a tight space for the number of visitors. Check these numbers: 28,000 people on Thursday; 25, 000 on Friday; and 45, 000 on Friday!!! Most of these were school kids, as this was the first time that organisers CESA (The Computer Entertainment Software Association) allowed the general public to attend. To hand were a total of 365 titles, from 87 companies. Here is the cream of the crop. SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT SCE are justifiably quite proud of their RPGs Arc the Lad II, and Wild Arms. And these should continue to attract new owners. The latter especially is getting a lot of attention becuase of it's impressive use, of 3D battle scenes. Another of Sony's first showings was Beldeselba: War Record, touted as a Flight Adventure Game. The action sequences are reminiscent of Panzer Dragoon on Saturn, which make use of the dual stick analogue controller. As you can see, the style is very Anime. No plans as yet for a UK or even Stateside release, TOKYO GAME SHOW 1996 Arc the Lad II. Hopefully will set more of a challenge. By far the craziest game of the entire show is Pa Rappa the Rappa. Described by SCE as \"a music. rythm and visual, real time game where you can enjoy playing withe the music\". The game is real time 3D, but all the characters are 2D giving them the appearance of wafer thin animated cut outs! Parappa the hero is controlled by following routines set out by the Rap Rhythm Teacher. By doing so players seek to impress Parappa's girlfriend Sunny Funny, through time spent at the Karate club with an Onion martial arts expert, and learning how to \"rhythm drive\" a moose... Weird! Less strange but equally as diverse is Depth, the first of SCE's Sweep Station Series. Depth is a Musical Adventure game, which combines elements of Ecco the Dolphin with those of NIGHTS-navigate the ocean as a dolphin, experiencing the sensation of swimming, while over 600 different melodies play in the background. Access 12 different sound worlds from monuments which reside in «Silent Space\". Players take melodies with them from one sound world to another, gradually building their own personal sound score. Amazing! DOEL Wild Arms. Lovely settings, and immense Boss characters. Just made available in the Akihabara district in Tokyo is this headset which Sony announced at the show. 'Glasstron' is not strictly for video games, but you can imagine how cool it would be to play Resident Evil in one of these things. The unit consists of a high-tech, lightweight visor, and Walkman style earphones, complete with remote. Jan 15 NEW GAMES SCORES 10000 XX: Surprisingly, SCE also had Ruro which seemed okay. It is another one of the new breed of 3D fighting games to incorporate weapons. Still very early though. GOOD Also at Sony's stand was Princess Maker, a quirky simulation game which is very popular in Japan having already been available in some form or another for PC and Saturn and 3DO. repet BAD 90 "


"CAPCOM computer video games Surprise of the show for Capcom was the appearance of Super Puzzle Fighter II X on Saturn and PlayStation. Apparently not even all the Capcom staff knew it was going to be there! Match coloured gems to vanish rows, and score points. 'Super Deformed' characters from the Vampire and Street Fighter series react to a player's performance. Out December in Japan. Hope Virgin get the license for Europe! Star Gladiator, and Street Fighter Zero (Alpha) 2 you can read about elsewhere this issue. This frees more space to talk about Capcom's latest pride and joy: Biohazard (Res. Evil) 2! This red hot sequel was aired for a few seconds at regular intervals on the main stage screen. Capcom mentioned in our interview how the sequel attempts to terrify players more by surrounding their character with huge crowds of zombies and here are the pictures to prove it! To give you some idea of context, the plot details that two months have passed since the STARS team exploded the toxic mansion. Little did they know that the infection had already spread to Racoon City. They return to discover a Metropolis heaving with 'undead' citizens. Two new heroes Leon, and Eliza join the struggle. Imagine...! PADCOM 0 Breath of Fire III should prove to be quite a popular RPG for PlayStation Part two is good for the Super NES (and you can buy it's available over here too!), as it boasts a good story with cute sub-games. So long as the plot is interesting, the enhanced graphics will help sell it. Bet Virgin don't license it for Europe...ah well. 0 1996 But when I left here, you guys were just sitting around laughing! NAMCO There can be no better way to launch a new joystick than getting 1000s of users pushing it to the limit with Tekken 2! So, even though T2 is an existing title, it became the centrepoint of Namco's stand. More zombies than ever before make the sequel to Resident Evil an even greater nightmare!!! Soul Edge on the PlayStation. Currently taking money in the arcades, this is one most people thought the PS was going to have problems with, as it's more graphically intense than Tekken 2. However this is Ver.B in all its glory, meaning you can play as Cervantes (the penultimate boss in Soul Edge). Extras include Team Battle, and CG intros. SEGA TOKYO GAME SHOW 1996 Like Sony, Sega are putting a lot of effort into their RPG titles. First and foremost is Red Team's Sakura Wars, billed as a Dramatic Adventure Game. It offers attractive anime conversation screens, and boasts a Shining Force style battle system. nou you ASSAULT an NEXT.. STADE!! Meanwhile Namco Museum Vol 4, which features Odine, Pacland, and Ishta, commanded its own dedicated audience. Riglord Saga 2, being developed by Micro Cabin for Sega, is the sequel to the game you know better as Mystaria. This time around all the characters are light sourced, and more detailed. Hopefully the battle system is revised too. If so this could be deserved of another English translation. CPUs TPC NEW GAMES Shining in the Holy Ark is Team Sonic's follow up to last year's Shining Wisdom. SW is a great game which looks kind of bland. As you can see though, SITHA looks set to become a great game which plays even better. Combat looks very similar to the original Shining in the Darkness Mega Drive title. The only game to have ever come close to Super Tennis on the Super NES is Smash Court from Namco. This is the much enhanced PlayStation edition. Apart from the intuitive gameplay, what's so appealing about Smash Tennis is the bizarre locations: A Buddhist Temple in Thailand, on the beach in Tahiti, in the Pine forest of Canada... and so on! Very cute. Aside from their Saturn wares, Sega also chose to exhibit the stunning CG intro to VF3 on the main screen. We wish you could see it too it's totally thrilling!!! 91 "


"computer Video POSITION TIME BESTLAP CESA PRESENTS games 04 LAPTIME EW GAMES  KONAMI Always exciting to see what Konami have in store, and they excelled themselves at TGS. Their BIGSIGHT stand was divided into five sections: Vandal Hearts; Toki Meki Memorial; Other Games; Konami Theatre and Multivision. 1996 256 POSITION BESTLA TIME 10 LAPTOP Vandal Hearts is obviously a major game for Konami. It's a Simulation RPG for PlayStation which involves lots of fighting. CVG has played a very early version, but the one on show was far more advanced. Long queues of people waited to test their skills in the bloody battles. Amazingly enough Konami Europe have this scheduled for a UK release. TOKYOGAMESHOW SPECIAL REPORT g 1996 221 Koch Believe it or not a whole fifth of the stand was dedicated to the Toki Meki Memorial, simulation game. It's aimed at adolescent boys who want to get a kick out of chatting up pretty girls (the best one is the red head...ahem). Seriously, this has been at the top of the Japanese \"all time favourite\" games chart since it was first released on PlayStation. Now it's available on Saturn, and back in at number one! Anyway, enough of that... POSITION BESTI 38103 LAPTIME 365 13 Vandal Hearts is going to be a big game for Konami. What's more, it's being released in the UK! Hurrah! As usual there was a bunch of Parodius sequels, which always sell okay as they're pretty quirky shoot 'em ups with attractive graphics. Sexy Parodius, especially, is very cheeky! TOKYO GAME SHOW 1996 A particularly ambitious project on Konami's behalf is the driving game Speed King, again on PlayStation. This is a conversion of the site-based arcade 'capsule' which spins players through 360° super fast to simulate G-Force. It cannot possibly have the same effect in the home, but the early screen shots look like the game could sit comfortable alongside the likes of Wipeout. Metal Gear Solid is still under development. But here's what we know so far: This is a real time polygon action game, from the same staff who produced the classic Policenauts a \"tactical espionage...political adventure\". It has been described as being similar to Biohazard in execution except in real time. It features a sleek silver cyborg ninja, a hard-faced male hero, and a couple of female love interests. We are desperate to find out more!!! KONAMI AND N641 It took 30 mins to queue for a seat in the Konami Theatre. And this is why: DRACULA X ON PLAYSTATION Almost a year ago, shots of the new Castlevania game were leaked to the Japanese press. Now it's official, and there is much more to see. It's a sprite-based action-platform game, in classic Castlevania tradition. But thanks to a few simple PlayStation spot effects, the lighting and overall detail is several steps beyond the awesome Super NES prequel. Here are the shots. More soon. NEW GAMES Ganbare Goemon 5 Only one Goemon game ever made it to the UK Legend of the Mystical Ninja. But we've missed out on all the fun! There have been three more platform/ adventures starring this fun character and his chums each one more innovative than the last, pushing the 16-bit Nintendo to the limit. Looks like he's about to do the same on N64 too! For the most part Goemon 5 looks like a Mario 64 exploration game, no doubt using the 3D stick. However there are Mech Warrior style battle sequences too as originally featured in Goemon 2. Fa-a-an ta-astic!!! MI-NEWS Dracula X for PlayStation is almost assured to surpass the Super NES predecessor in every way. 92 "


"computer video games SNK TECMO 96 5:22 Still no more news on the promised 64-bit console from this company. But we are hot on the case. Fatal Fury Real Bout is reviewed on Saturn elsewhere this issue, so let's see what else is coming. You may recognise their name as the producers of Dead or Alive -the 3D fighting game running off Sega's Model 2 board. Though a Saturn version of this is in development, there was nothing at TGS. Instead Tecmo had a row of coin-ops on freeplay. 1 Go on their Tiger! Kill! Kill! New to the show was Samurai Spirits on Saturn and PlayStation the former making good use of the Sega RAM cartridge. Their consumer ware is pretty diverse. As is ably demonstrated by Trap Simulation Dungeon. You are the dungeon keeper, who aims to devise the most cunning trap imaginable. Once the traps are set, the next trick is to lure the monsters into them. It sounds basic and weird, but it is a real laugh! Somebody should pick this up. 58 0:49 | Hp 83/16 Horse racing games are very popular in Japan, and Tecmo were making a big deal about Gallop Racer which does look impressive. But maybe not to anyone reading this. However they also have something along similar lines called Monster Farm, where the player breeds monsters to fight! TAKARA ABM Continuing to satisfy fans of the Toshinden series, Takara had Nitoshinden on display, which mimics the Virtua kids idea big heads, floppy bodies. ONSO Though the characters look pretty nice, this game hasn't received such a warm welcome in Japan. The reviews have been pretty average. Apparently Sega are planning to release it over here in November, so see for yourself. CATCH W73y0TL On home territory Neo Geo CD SNK have King of Fighters 96 almost ready (should be out in Japan by the time you read this), and the much anticipated Samurai Spirits RPG. SNK are taking that particular venture very seriously, as this is an important area to be in. ZI Something of a departure for the company is a rather beautiful, intriguing title Deep Sea Adventure. The plot is very similar to Waterworld, in that 90% of the world is submerged. Difference is that colonisation takes place below the surface. From the safety of a submarine it is your task to search out a and retrieve lost treasures. Sounds romantic, eh. TOKYO GAME SHOW 1996 GAME ARTS Power Pro Baseball A classic sports sim on Super Nintendo, which still plays better than the Saturn and PlayStation versions. Imagineer have something similar to this for N64, but we Konami get the credit for the original concept hardball played by hardboiled eggs! Well that's what these little guys look like, don't they. Producers of the impressive Gun Griffon for Saturn. Their latest title, Grandia, is an RPG with a distinctive colourful style. These screenshots say a lot about the quality of presentation. Gameplaywise it's not unlike the brilliant Chrono Trigger free-rain during exploration, but turn-based battle. Looks very special indeed, let's hope it has an equally juicy plot. 1P600 HP420W HP283P818 Mahjong Master Okay, we don't expect you to get excited about this one. But here's some shots anyway. Looks very nice indeed. Konami are the kings of presentation! Golf Tournament Nothing on this just yet, sorry. NEW GAMES Tactical warfare, and intriguing locations in Grandia, for Sega Saturn. J-League Perfect Soccer International Superstar Soccer for N64! Unique because it requires the 3D stick to operate, which will allow for a superb degree of control. From what was on show, it appears that ISS on N64 is still played from a fixed perspective unlike the ambitious but less popular Goal Storm on PlayStation. "


"CESA PRESENTS computer video games NEW GAMES 05 SETA POSITION 1996 While Shogi is obviously amied directly at the Japanese market, Seta's TGS line-up should appeal to everyone. Their most laid back game is St Andrews Links, a licensed golf game in case you need telling. At the show the upate was quite slow, so the golfers swing sort of jerky. But the real time 3D environment is solid enough. So long as it's an accurate simulation, that's all it requires to succeed. RECORD 135672 TOKYOGAMESHOW SPECIAL REPORT . STCC9 735 672 T35\"672 0 1998 231, GAME HOW No, not a CG intro this is the game: Rev Limit. Hard to believe isn't it. As yet no one has played the game, so it's unfair to pass comment in that respect. But the visual impact is massive. Seta promise a Team Manager option, as well as the standard driving game. See how well you can work the pit crews in order to win the race instead of perfecting those power slides! All the cars sustain damage in a race if hit, and Seta have taken care to simulate accurate dynamics. So far, so good! A full report on Enix is planned for next issue. They have two games planned for Nintendo formats: Wonder Project J2 on N64, and Dragon Quest III on the Super Famicom (SNES). Expect the latter to outsell everything else mentioned in this report at a ratio of 3:1. Just you wait and see. Just briefly, Dragon Quest lll is an updated version of the 1988 NES RPG classic. Currently the series is up to number six, but DQIII is still believed to be the best in the series. As many Super Famicom owners have never owned the original, this is as good as, if not better, than the promise of a seventh installment. Plus new towns and characters, and revised presentation is an excuse to play through again. HOLE NO. 2 DE 411 YDS, PAR 4 TOKYO GAME SHOW 1996 Not only does Rev Limit look completely realistic, the handling is authentic too. In Wild Choppers pilots have full range of movement above the hectic 3D battlefield. This could be the closest thing N64 gets to a decent Strike game minus the strict guidlines. Players may view the action from a series of angles, using the C Buttons. Wild Choppers utilises the 3D stick for control. The C buttons choose different views. IMAGINEER 1995 60-OT IX NEW GAMES Wonder Project J2 is a potentially superb showcase of N64's capacity for Artifical Intelligence, as players attempt to teach Joset (a mechanical girl) how to survive, and defend her creator's home town against an evil empire's army. With Wonder Project J2, Enix want players to experience touching the heart of the character on screen. You'll be amazed how much this works as even the 16-bit forerunner served to demonstrate. The CVG office recently git hands on experience of Pro Baseball King, from Imagineer. It really does borrow a lot from Konami's games, but that's not to say this isn't enjoyable, or any less impressive. All the official team logos are featured, and we suspect that we could recognise some famous faces too if we knew who to look out for in the first place! 150 COM 1 0 1 COM 10 CO-OH TELUR 2 35 94 "


"TAITO WARP computer video games Aside from Darius 2 on Saturn, Taito had their revolutionary arcade fighting game Psychic Force ready for PlayStation. Fighters enact the whole battle while levitating, and proceed to unleash impossible moves against each other. If you like your combat almost entirely projectile based, this game has all the pyro you need! D2: M2 The best left till last? President of Warp, Kenji Eno, finally unveiled D no Shokutaku:2 at the Tokyo Game Show. All the more exciting because it debuted on a brand new gaming platform Matsushita's M2. To some gamers this could almost be as significant as Super Mario on N64. And when you examine these screenshots, you begin to understand why. \"FIRST M2 GAME!\" O Most significant about D2 is the switch from FMV, prompt-action gameplay to a Real Time 3D polygon world. Nobody knows how the game is controlled just yet, but there are clues to the routines: searching for clues, and getting caught out by sinister traps. Remember, this is Dracula's domain. Distance shots reveal that M2 can handle depth cuing at least as well as N64. And the solidity of the architecture, combined with intricate textures, portrays close-range detail with tremendous realism. Any more comments at this stage would be Notice how the fire lights A suit of armour springs pure speculation. But we expect more the room with a natural to life! Time to ready that details to surface within the next month or so. warm glow. Impressive, eh. sword! SQUARE This is a good opportunity to introduce Square's full PlayStation line up to CVG. FFVII you already know about, and Square were handing out demo discs at the show. Tobal No.1 was warmly received too.  so os Bushido Blade is a traditional, Kendo style 3D fighting game. Interesting because it uses terrain as obstacles, and for dramatic effect where swords are seen to cut down bamboo trees in mid combat. The overall presentation is quite serious, so we expect that the game will require a lot of technique to get impressive results. TOKYO GAME SHOW 1996 Roll up! Roll up! Get your free Final Fantasy VII demos here! 12+13 NINTENDO Zauver a space shoot em up. Unfortunately we have little information on this one. Sa Ga Frontier is the latest in a successful series. Romancing Sa Ga 4 on the Super Famicom is unique because of the 'floating' approach to the plot. It boasts a superb battle system too. Great things are expected from the PlayStation. NEW GAMES Even a casual observer couldn't fail to notice how the Japanese love their strategy games. Final Fantasy Tactics caters for those players who can't get enough of those turn-based battle scenarios, and all the pyrotechnics associated with them. It may look like nothing to you, but to some players this is video game heaven! Eager Japanese players crowd around the Imagineer stand to play Baseball King. 95 "


"comput. Video games NEW GAMES DOOM TEO. FORMAT: SATURN BY: RAGE STYLE: DOOM GAME! DUE: DECEMBER It's perhaps a bit late, but Saturn Doom is almost finished. The levels are the same as with the PlayStation version released last year some taken from Ultimate Doom, along with some from Doom 2, with all of the classic weapons and monsters included. The latest version of Doom on Saturn has got a redesigned status bar at the bottom of the screen (which isn't as tasteful as the original one). Also, it currently runs slowly and jerkily. Hopefully the final version will be greatly improved. SA 1602 123 RAGE RACER 22% 722 849 942 FIRST LOOK AT HOT SOFTWARE! PORSCHE CHALLENGE : NIGHTMARE CREATURES FORMAT: PLAYSTATION BY: NAMCO STYLE: RACING DUE: DECEMBER Namco's Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer Revolution are some of the best and most popular PlayStation games, so it makes sense that the series keeps going. While it doesn't seem as though Rave Racer is coming out on PlayStation, the new Rage Racer is! As you can see from these pictures, it's similar to the other games, only there's a much more varied selection of cars to drive, and the scenery isn't just plain race tracks it's set through towns and cities, making it look excellent! We've yet to play the game properly so we can't tell you exactly how it handles, though we'd expect it to stick closely to the familiar Ridge Racer style. More news next month. FORMAT: PLAYSTATION BY: SCEE STYLE: DRIVING DUE: SPRING '97 As you'll know if you're reading the magazine backwards and you've already seen the back page, Porsche are soon to release the amazing Boxter on the world. And to coincide with the release, SCEE are making a game to go with it and it's looking incredible! The actual Boxter in the game looks almost identical to the real thing, all done with light-sourcing and some very fancy shading. The game apparently handles just like the real thing, meaning that when it's released we can all save thousands of pounds by getting the game instead of the real car! More information and some pics soon. FORMAT: PLAYSTATION, PC BY: MINDSCAPE STYLE: 3D ACTION DUE: SPRING '97 While Nightmare Creatures may look like it should be a slowpaced adventure game like Resident Evil, all it has in common with Capcom's game is the terrifying atmosphere. It's set in 19th century London, where loads of demons and mutants are loose, and it's down to you to : sort them out. When you : encounter an enemy, the game becomes more of a beat 'em up, as you use a wide selection of moves to defeat them. The graphics are impressive and the overall game is very atmospheric. Eeee! Kick it in the head! HEXEN There's always room in our lives for another Ridge Racer sequel. We love 'em. Love 'em we tell ya! RAPID RACER NEW GAMES 09 Flechette FORMAT: SATURN BY: PROBE STYLE: 3D SHOOTING DUE: DECEMBER Hexen on the Saturn looks a lot more impressive than Doom does at the moment. While it's basically the same game engine, there are a lot of little tricks, like being able to look up and down, some excellent interaction with the scenery, and some amazing special effects like earthquakes! Also, it's got the excellent «hub» level system linking the whole game together into one giant stage which can be wandered around at will. The PC version was excellent, and the Saturn game looks and plays pretty much the same .This is one to look out for. Expect the review next month. FORMAT: PLAYSTATION BY: SCEE STYLE: SPEEDBOAT RACING DUE: SPRING '97 Water sport games are suddenly appearing everywhere three jetski arcade games, Wave Race 64, and now Rapid Racer for the PlayStation. Again, it seems stunning from the early pictures, and promises to play as well as it looks. We don't know much about this, except that it will be one of the first racing games to run at 60 frames per second with the high resolution mode. Hopefully we'll get to play this soon, when we'll tell you exactly how good it is. 96 The shots no doubt make the game look like the original PC version. And indeed it runs like it's on a good 486.

"POWER F1 REALMS OF THE HAUNTING computer video games FORMAT: PC CD-ROM BY: TEQUE STYLE: RACING DUE: NOVEMBER US Gold's Power F1 may have an official licence, but that handling, as well as the ability to customise your car to doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be a boring exactly the way you want it., which you can then race in simulation game. In fact, some liberties are being taken split-screen mode (something not often found in PC to make it a more exciting and entertaining game more games). It's certainly an interesting idea, and we'll have spectacular crashes, loads of game views, and more more next month for you. interesting scenery. It's also got very realistic car SET FORMAT: PC CD-ROM BY: GREMLIN STYLE: ADVENTURE DUE: NOVEMBER We looked at this game a while back. But with its legendary creator Tony Crowther appearing at this year's ECTS and gracing this month's Cabin, it's worth another look before the review. Excellent 3D environments, spliced with professional cinematics give this horror-adventure a spine-tingling edge. Described as 'not Doomlike' it features more puzzle elements and a neat interface.

It's also going to have the up-to-date NBA licence, with all the real players (along with their faces on the game characters), kits, and courts.

Namco's Alpine Surfer may look excellent, but it's not really all that much fun. Cool Boarders, however, looks pretty darned rough but is excellent fun to play! There are time trials as you attempt to master the courses, along with points for each trick you perform from the jumps. You can also customise the look of your boarder and save off your best replays.

"computer Video games We don't pretend to know anything about cars, but even we know Porsches are cooool! So when a new one is launched and Sony snap up the rights to the game, we wanna bit of the action!! GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ROOF RETRACTORS! he Porsche Boxter is its name and it's the only all-new Porsche to surface from illustrious German automobile manufacturer Zuffenhausen base since the 928 scorched onto the scene 19 years ago! Which must make it pretty damn special! At least that's how the motor industry are treating it, having awaited the final production model ever since the prototype was unveiled in 1993. So what makes the Boxter such a hot cookie? Well get this. It has the World speed record for the opening of a roof. Yep, its button-operated cabriolet roof can fold away in under 12 seconds! And a sophisticated roof rack system allows you to open the roof without knocking your crocodile-skin suitcases onto the road. In fact, lugagge-consideration obviously took priority at Porsche's Weissach R&D centre because, there's storage space at the front AND back of the car. Great eh? We're just kidding, we don't really care about its luggage-handling capabilities. However, the rea son why there's space at both ends of the car IS pretty smart. Its six-cylinder horizontally. opposed engine is tamper-proof sealed away in the middle of the car. In fact, the only way to see it is by staring at a diagram in the driver's manual! We could blether on about its technical specifications -telling you about its five-speed Triptronic S transmission system, mono-block brake callipers and motorised ducktail spoiler. But we don't know what it means and if you do, you clearly don't need us to tell you about it. All you need to know is it has a 150 mph top speed, can go from O to 62 mph in 6.9 seconds and the speedometer only measure speeds in 50 km/h chunks. That's slow-fast-faster-rocketspeed! What's more, it's cheap at only ,000. Well, that is half the price of a Porsche 911! THE ALL-NEW PORSCHE BOSTER THE CAR WITH THE FASTEST OPENING ROOF IN THE WORLD PORSCHE BOXTER TOP TRUMP!!

"computer video and The Computer and Video Games FREE Pull-out Guide November 1996 -games FREEPLAY SEGAWORLD CUT NOT SO  stop press Issue 7 READERS MOST WANTED CHART More of your piffling dreams, laid bare. N64 is sitting strong, VF3 and Tekken 3 are now in much demand too. A new Vampire Hunter sequel tool GOOD! hat's us being polite, folks. But the fact is, after months of waiting for the World's largest Indoor Theme Park to finally open, we were distinctly unimpressed with the result. Launched on Saturday the 7th of September, CVG were among the members of the press granted VIP access to the seven-storey premises, located in the Trocadero at London's Piccadilly Circus. Okay, here's a brief rundown of our experience. Arriving at the newly refitted Trocadero, we were greeted by the incredible Rocket Escalator, which was indeed incredible. This super-long, neon-bathed stair tunnel took us right to the top floor. Well-lit and packed with all the latest and best coin-ops. That's how SegaWorld looks. All the machines are linked up to maximum numbers eight-player Manx TT, Sega Rally, Daytona etc. Best of all though, there are three Virtua Fighter 3 machines in the new Megalo 210 cabinets). And that is the best, cos the rides are abysmal. Here's a short review of four of the six on offer. BEAST IN DARKNESS. Best described as walking through a crappy ghost house, with string hanging off the ceiling. At one point there's a video wall showing a rendered monster growling. A man dressed as monster also appears and growls. Next you get in a trolley. It's pitch black, there's some snuffling and a bar hits your back (tis the Beast in the Darkness). Some dribble lands in your ear. You leave. SPACE MISSION. Sitting in an eight-seater ship, each person puts on a virtual reality visor. You can even see at your mates' virtual faces moving. The ships take off. You can look around in full 3D and shoot at baddies. It's actually not bad. GHOST HUNT. Two-seater trolleys, each one fitted with a glass screen. The trolleys trundle around a haunted house (better described as an empty house) and monsters appear on the screen. You shoot at them and then you leave. AQUA PLANET. A 3D specs extravaganza. In which you sit in a hydraulic carriage and watch a screen. Overly imaginative people will believe they travel underwater and battle a squid by tapping some buttons. It would be dull, but the long wait in a narrow chipboard-walled corridor makes it just annoying. Then you leave. The rides certainly aren't worth going on, but this is the best arcade we've been too. However,  to get into any arcade (and pay for the coin-ops on top of that) is waaay to much. If SegaWorld gave you 20 credits at the entrance, it would be excellent. As it is though, we think it's poo. 1 NINTENDO 64 In the UK! 2 VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 Arcade/Saturn 3 VAMPIRE HUNTER 3 Arcade 4 TEKKEN 3 Arcade 5 32-BIT GAMEBOY In our pockets 6 FIGHTING VIPERS Saturn 7 NIGHTS Saturn 8 STREET FIGHTER 3 Arcade Playstation 10 RESIDENT EVIL Among others, you asked for Marvel | Superheroes on PS (no chance).

Here's what the control freak demands of you in his own words. LATEST NEWS ON ATARI! With members of CVG currently snapping up Jaguars at , including Cybermorph and Tempest 2000 (officially one of the best games ever made), we decided to investigate the future of Atari's 64-bit console by calling them. From their icy replies we ascertained that Worms and Breakout 2000 are set for release at some unspecified time in the future, with Soulstar heading to Jaguar CD. Supposedly, the machine is also still in production (obviously it's cheap to make). So, everything's rosy at Atari then. No seriously, we went into the Virgin Megastore and they were sold out.

The player is a secret agent who must stop a train before it reaches the country of the Redmen who have hijacked it. First of all you must run across the top of the train dodging obstacles such as the knife-throwing Redmen and gaps between the carriages. After a certain amount of carriages, the scene switches to the inside of the train where you have to run down to the engine where the brakes can be applied. To be honest, I didn't get very far cos it's so blinkin' difficult you can get halfway across the whole train only to get shot, tumble off and start again from the beginning!

Fail and you burn out! Once all the droids on one deck have been knocked out, the lights turn off and you progress to another infested deck. The legendary Andrew Braybrook is going to appear at the HMV Retro Games Exhibition at level one. GOBLIN: Have you ever done any games that were never released. TC: Yeh, I did a game called SHELTER that spent a week on. It was a 3D game on the C64 (a bit like DOOM) with chunky graphics where people hid behind barrels. It was done in the machine's character mode and at the time I felt it wasn't going in the right direction... so we shelved it! After that I've released every other game l've written. GOBLIN: Is there any game you wish you'd written. TC: DUNGEON MASTER affected me the most and thats where CAPTIVE came from. I'd never seen anything that could beat that product and I really wanted to copy it with CAPTIVE, whereas with REALMS OF THE HAUNTING I'm just using DOOM as a media. Retro GOBLIN: How did you get into programming. TC: When I did my A levels I kept skiving lessons and I used to go to the library where I got interested in computers. I started writing educational software on BBC B's and SHARP MZ88's and I learnt BASIC by typing in listings from magazines--they never worked so I used to debug them and find out why they didn't work. To round off this month I must just apologise for naming ATARI as the creators of PAC-LAND a couple of issues ago, it was of course NAMCO. Sorry everyone. GOBLIN: Are you the classic bedroom programmer responsible for ALL the music, graphics, code etc... TC: Oh absolutely! Except now I've got an extension built onto the house and the last game I did EVERYTHING was on CAPTIVE for the Amiga. For LIBERATION and KNIGHTMARE we got artists in and in this one (REALMS OF THE HAUNTINGCOMING SOON ON THE PC) I'm just doing the pure code... the compression algorithms, the video playback etc...

TC: Well sort of, I enjoy writing tools! It's like detective work trying to find bugs within the code. I've been doing this work for 15 years and I still find it great fun, it's never a job to me. FAVOURITE FOOD: INDIAN (ORIGINALLY NOTHING FOREIGN!)

"puter TES FREEPLAY FAN he section, within a section, of CVG where you get to shout about your favourite games system and/ or software. This is the first batch of unedited mail to reach us, in which we find that: a) Saturn owners have big mouths, and b) that even Capcom have a tough time pleasing all of the people all of the time. Let's not turn this into a moan zone. There's too much to be positive about: Fighting Vipers, Wipeout 2097, Quake wooaaawesoome!!! The Address: Freeplay Fan! Freeplay Computer and Video Games Priory Court 30-32 Farringdon Lane London EC1R 3AU 919 Many people, given a choice between 32-bit systems and the Nintendo would undoubtedly plump for the latter. But we are constricted by budgets. And to ourselves the consumers the Saturn or PlayStation is definitely the 'rosier option', and with titles like NIGHTS, Tekken 2, F1, Duke Nukem, etc, I think the N64 will be shunned by the public too expensive, too little, too late. Timothy Andrews, Brentwood, Essex Dear CVG, I am writing in response to your request for opinions for your Freeplay Fan section after having read comments from writers for various magazines. In my opinion the best home console available at the moment is the Sega Saturn. I believe that it is far superior to the PlayStation in terms of games available and as for the N64, I think Gus Swan of Mean Machines described it best as \"nice, unavailable and has only two games.\" No home console has a beat 'em up to match Virtua Fighter 2, a driving game to match Daytona USA or Sega Rally, or a platformer to match Bugl or NIGHTS. Also, in response to Matt Broughton's comment: 1) all CD consoles will have CD quality sound, for the simple reason that it is all pulled off the CD (durr!), 2) the whole point of an arcade conversion is to convey the gameplay perfectly, to make up for the graphics not being as good; and 3) show me a game on the PlayStation that is as arcade perfect as the Saturn conversion of Virtua Cop. Also, a billion games before 1997? Just a tad unrealistic methinks. Anyway, that's got a lot off my chest. Martin Williams, Poole, Dorset games on the Saturn, even though Sega have been producing some excellent 3D games on the Saturn. So obviously what Capcom really mean is that they find it difficult to make 3D games for the Saturn. Sega's future certainly is looking very bright, with the Net connections and modem soon to be released., the 8 megabit RAM card will be used to produce future games (eg VF3) and third party companies are now giving the sys. tem more support. So all I can say to the newcomers Sony is, 'To be this good takes ages' stick to televisions and stereos. And all I can say to Nintendo is let the true battle begin! Stephen Driscoll, Marlow, Buckinghamshire FREEPLAY FAN SATURN Dear CVG, Is the Saturn the best SER SATURN system in the World? Oh yes! Everyone knows that Sega makes the best arcade games, whether they admit it or not, and the fact that the most popular of these have been or will be converted to the Saturn almost perfectly should prove this alone. I admit that Namco have converted some brilliant arcade games to the PlayStation, which is probably the reason most people bought the system. However there is a rumour which might cause a lot of PlayStation owners to regret that they purchased the system, when they hear that Namco might start making games for Saturn and N64. The Saturn may not have as many games being released for it recently compared to the PlayStation, but this is not as important as the majority of the PlayStation games to be released recently are crap. When you think of the best games for Saturn they are mainly the ones which will only be released for this system, eg VF2, VC, Sega Rally, Guardian Heroes etc. Ok, so some people might own a few of the Psygnosis games, but the fact that we can buy these games for our system, and may be able to get their future games as well should worry PlayStation owners no end. Also there is another worrying thing for Sony, which is the difficulty that Capcom are obviously having with producing 2D games for the system (even though they deny it). For instance, where is XMen: Children of the Atom? Some people against Sega ask, \"where is Saturn's Resident Evil?\" Capcom believe it is difficult to produce 3D expensive software, and worse still, not even seeing a release for great games. During the SNES' lifespan, many great games weren't even seen over here. I saw it as a sad loss that I never got to play any of the Final Fantasy series or Goemon, among many. This will happen again with N64. Maybe Nintendo don't care about us playing great games, unless they're Nintendo's own. Until the price is right, third party competition is allowed, and we see a little commitment here, Mario or not will remain sceptical. It was Sega who finally convinced me that they were serious. Seen by many as the underdog, but viewed by those 'in the know' as the machine with by far the most potential, the Saturn has, and will continue to surprise. If you are talking coin-ops, VF2 and Sega Rally are by far superior to Tekken or Ridge Racer or Killer Instinct. Sega's AM teams lead where others follow, simple as that. If you're looking for original third party support look no further than Exhumed, Tomb Raider, and Guardian Heroes plus many others on the way from world class developers, exclusively on Saturn. Sega have a commitment to us here also. Release periods between Japan, USA, and UK are getting shorter, and we see ALL new releases. Sony and Nintendo just cannot compete on these terms. I won't say that NIGHTS is better than Mario 64 (I haven't played either yet) but what NIGHTS does show is further commitment from Sega to the Saturn, and to leaving the Saturn owner feeling positive towards the gaming experience, and looking forward to more. I knew the SNES would be the best of its kind, and when I bought a Saturn a few months ago, I knew. Mark Storey, Norwood, Sheffield PS: I'd just like to add, on behalf of Saturn AND PlayStation owners, a big raspberry to Capcom surely the laziest of all 3rd parties. Saturn not suited to Res Evil? PlayStation can't handle 2D coinops? Capcom, If you can't be bothered to exploit hardware fully, then give the license to your games to someone who can. Dear Freeplay, When I bought a Super NES nearly five years ago, I knew I knew that this machine would set the pace in graphics and gameplay, that it would be the one machine that everyone would want. I knew that it would constantly surprise while others looked tired. I knew that this grey box would reward many years of loyal ownership with games that others only dreamed of... Buying a new console proved a tricky business, particularly when I'd grown so attached to the Super NES. So I decided not to sell it and in the meantime look long and hard at what was happening in the 32/64-bit world. Sony were doing all the shouting, with a high profile ad campaign and a definite aim towards the older user. But after a long play on the PlayStation I was unconvinced that this was the step forward they were claiming. This wasn't going to look as good a year on. Magazines were full of people griping about endless poor software. And the situation (bar Resident Evil) hasn't changed. My Super NES was classier than this. But what about the Nintendo saviour, N64? I owned a Super NES after all, so surely this would have been the logical progression. But Nintendo's attitude to the UK stinks. I refuse to pay import prices (well I would if I could afford them) so I would be doomed to suffer frustrating delays, very Dear CVG, NINTENDO With CVG giving SM64 the thumbs up, and appraising the game, and the N64 to no end, it's easy for us all to fall over ourselves in the hype and furore surrounding the big 64-bit console. However what I feel many journalists can't appreciate is how sceptical the public are of the N64. Many gamers, having already purchased a PlayStation or Saturn, will not be prepared to sell their system for an N64. By the time it is released officially, maybe Spring 1997, Sony and Sega, in an effort to thwart Nintendo's plans, will have cut their system's prices once again. Games will be cheaper, and there will be a huge database of games for both consoles. How on Earth can a sys tem that retails for , with games at -65, possibly compete? FREEPLAY "
