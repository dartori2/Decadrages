"NEWS THE LAWNMOWER MAN It could be the biggest film of the year, and soon you'll be able to play the game! Lawnmower Man is the most succesful British movie for years, storming to Number One on its release in America and set for stardom over here in the summer. Software house Storm have snapped up this mega hot license and are already beavering away on the game, planned to coincide with the UK launch of the film, so here's FRANK O'CONNOR with everything you need to know about one of the hottest movies of the decade! QUALCAST Jeff Fahey plays the retarded but wholesome gardener (hence the name of the film), while Mr. Brosnan is the local scientist. Experimenting with a combination of drugs and Virtual Reality, the scientist discovers that he can accelerate the normal learning process by an unlimited factor. Although the chimps he tries this on become far more intelligent, they display aggressive characteristics and become dangerously paranoid and homocidal. \"Hurrah!\" Shouts Brosnan and decides to try it on a bloke the Lawnmower Man. He agrees to participate in Brosnan's experiments and before long he's a super-intelligent mega-being a sort of Charles Atlas with Einstein's brain. Sadly though, the drugs he takes to accelerate the learning process are part of a plan to turn him into some kind of supersoldier and his Virtual Reality powers start to drift into the real world... BLACK AND DECKER The Virtual Reality theme is dead trendy at the moment and The Lawnmower Man has cashed in on it a treat. The people most responsible for the distinctive look of the film are a little known company called Angel Studios, who have produced computer graphics for clients ranging from Nintendo to NASA. The music in FLYMO Lawnmower Man is all digital and The Lawnmower Man is here. Angel Studios again had a hand in Stephen King's intriguing screenthe audio production. The graphic play has finally made it to the silver techniques used employ the latscreen. The themes of high advenest polygon technology and the ture and Virtual Reality took it computers used to animate and straight to the number one spot in integrate these graphics are the USA, making it the most sucamong the fastest in the world. cessful British film for years. Similar technology was also used Bearing in mind that most British by Xaos (pronounced Kaos), films tend to be about posh another computer graphics progeezers who fall in love with other duction company. These guys posh geezers, it's not really surpriswere responsible for some of the ing. The film stars Jeff Fahey and most impressive sequences in Pierce Brosnan (out of Remington the Virtual World. Lawnmower Steele) and tells the tale of what Man will appear in British cinehappens when you push the village mas in early Summer. See you in idiot too far... the queue! CVG 010 "

"NEWS SPECIAL REPORT PC ENGINE LAPTOP REVEALED! EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK! EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK! THANKS! Our PC Engine Laptop came courtesy of Console Concepts (0782 712759). Call them for more PC Engine info. ARUMBA! No sooner does one of the swankiest pieces of kit ever to come out of Japan come out of, er, Japan than CVG takes it apart for an in-depth investigation! Frank O'Connor's the man with the screwdriver in his hand, so put down that cocktail Frankie and tell us all about the machine... SO WHAT'S ALL THIS THEN? NEC, the people who brought us the excellent PC Engine, have just unveiled their latest creation, the PC Engine Laptop! This baby is without doubt the most awesome handheld available. It's not a true portable, it only runs off a mains supply and there's no space for batteries, but it does have the largest colour LCD screen of any video game system ever. The unit is a fully fledged PC engine, complete with joystick port, expansion slots and CD compatibility and, unlike the PC Engine GT, you can play two player games! Hang onto your hats though, 'cos this little baby will set you back a gobsmacking FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS! So, what do you get for all that lolly? Well, the unit is slightly smaller, although a tad thicker than a normal Engine and the top flips up to reveal the sexy and very impressive colour screen. The card slot is exactly the same as that of a standard Engine and the machine takes all the standad cards, but the groovy matt grey colour makes this look very professional indeed. There are tons of knobs, dials and buttons placed all over the machine, mostly controlling the LCD screen. You can adjust TV ANTICS The most novel feature of the PC Engine LT is the built in TV unit. A simple flick of a switch turns the PC Engine LT into a fully fledged colour TV set. The only problem with this is, that it runs on the Japanese NTSC system and so you won't be able to pick up British TV programmes. If however you can afford the damn thing in the first place, you can probably afford to visit Japan just to watch the telly. The picture, as far as we can tell, is pin sharp and has a lot of smart computer aided features, such as autotuning and fast update. The unit can be plugged into the PC 88886 5001835: 3981 SUPER CD SURPRISE! STAR WARS ON SUPER NES! OOH! One of the greatest NES games of the year will soon be unleashed on the Super Nintendo courtesy of Lucasfilm! Just like the NES version, the plot of the game will follow the game closely and if the programmers have managed to include the trouser-staining excitement of that game then this one could be a real winner! So stay stuck here for more news and in the mantime just pore over this piccy, which looks totally brill! INCREDIBLE! No sooner is the Super Nintendo launched in this country than CVG weighs in with news of CD-ROM for the machine! Provisionally entitled the CD ROM XA, the machine will feature full motion live video, simultaneous CD soundtracks as well as producing standard SNES code! Rumour has it that the machine will also feature an array of new custom chips. These will almost certainly include a sprite scaler (the SNES only scales backdrops at the moment), but even more exciting is speculation concerning a polygon system. \"From what we can gather, this will allow the SNES to produce fast, smooth, shaded polygons, probably better than anything you've seen on a home system. Best of all though, Nintendo announced that the CD ROM XA will cost $200 about  in British money! The machine will be officially launched at the upcoming Chicago Consumer Electronic Show and you can expect a full report on these very pages! CVG 012 "

"NEWS STAR SUPER NINTENDO GAMES GALORE! The Super Nintendo is here at last and judging from the unbelievably huge size of the CVG Mailbag the world, his uncle and his fifty seven rather obscure relatives wants to own one! You lot went totally bonkers over last month's competition to win one of ten Super Nintendos (results elsewhere this issue!) and we've had letters and phone calls galore about the latest and some of you say greatest official UK console to hit the shelves. Top of just about everyone's list of questions were the games themselves and what we thought of them. As everyone knows, CVG's so hot we Reviewed all the first official titles yonks ago and loads of you have forgotten what the marks were! So by popular demand here's a quick re-Review rundown on the first batch of Super Nintendo, telling you a bit about each and repeating their review ratings. Happy now? You flippin' well ought to be! BTW F-ZERO The first game to really show off the kind of graphics and speed the Super Nintendo is capable of, this one has gone down a storm with speed freaks everywhere! Choose your speedster and race against the rest on wildly different tracks across a space-age landscape where wimps use brakes and everyone's out to win and fast! Initially pretty awe-inspiring to look at, the game soon grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go until you've beaten everyone in sight, with the only drawback that the tracks do start to look a bit samey after a while. Nevertheless, speed freaks and race fans should check this out for super-fast thrills 'n' spills! CE SUPER NINTENDO 2:24 23 POWER SFEED 000 L O' 28\" REVIEWED:May 1991 SCORE: 92% NINTENDO START "

This game is absolutely massive, and features some of the cutest graphics you'll ever see. Playability is tuned almost to perfection, providing another fabulous outing for Mario and Luigi!

"ZUG REVIEW GVE VG WORLD EXCLUSIVE! Yes folks, the galaxy's greatest games mag delivers the goodies once again to bring you scoop reviews on what could be the year's biggest game Terminator! Not content with grabbing the Megadrive version while sad mags jump up ands down in frustration, we've got the Master System version as well! So if you're a Sega-owning Terminator freak you should be pooping yourself right about now. Well, change your drawers a bit quick and let's get on with the show! The war against the machines had raged for years, ever since the Skynet defence computer made the decision to fire its nuclear missiles on August 29th, 1997. Three billion human beings were wiped out that day, and those remaining had battled for thirty years battled to stay alive. But the tide had turned against Skynet the human resistance, under the leadership of John Connor, had organised and brought the machines to their knees. There was only one course of action left to Skynet; to send a Terminator unit back through time to kill the mother of Connor before she gives birth to the planet's saviour. Luckily, the resistance learned of this plan and sent one of their crack soldiers to infiltrate the enemy headquarters, plant a timed explosive device on the reactor powering the Time Displacement Unit and follow the Terminator through before the time machine explodes Once there, the agent's task is to save Connor's mother from the wrath of the Terminator. MEGADRIVE PLATFORM VIRGIN GAMES  TBA TENU Hunt \"I was one of the first people ever to see The Terminator on Megadrive. That was in its very early stages and I'm happy to report that the game is as exciting and fun now as it was then. What grabs you first of all is the wicked intro a perfect reproduction of the opening credits from o the film, complete with scrolling letters, flashing cursors and that brilliantly moody music. Start the game and you'll get killed straightaway one, because it's bloody difficult and you only get one life, two, because the graphics are truly amazing some of the best I've ever seen on the Megadrive! The programmers have used the same animation technique as seen in Prince of Persia and it really does work a treat! There's loads of colour all over the place and backdrops are as excellent as the sprites. In fact, it's a bit of a shame that all the time spent on presentation has gone on sprucing up what is basically a platform shoot 'em up quite an addictive one, but a platform shoot 'em up nonetheless. The Terminator is one neat package, great to look at and very tough to play.\" NOTHING CLEAN. RIGHT The trouble with time travel is you can't take anything with you no clothes, no weapons, just the skin on yer back and an embarrassed smile if anyone should see you in the buff. Thankfully, Reese and the Terminator have both found new togs by the time we join them in 1984, but the weapons they have on them aren't laser guns just ordinary 1980's artillery. Which is fine for the T800, who is out to kill Sarah, but not so hot for Reese. After all, if a poly-metal alloy endoskeleton can withstand laser blasts, what's the odd shotgun fart going to do? Not a lot, apart from momentarily stunning the cyborg, allowing the player to escape its clutches! CVG 020 PAUL RAND "


"REVIEW GUE 07842 WE WERE THAT CLOSE TO GOING UNDER The player controls Kyle Reese, sergeant of the resistance TechCom division. His mission is theoretically simple track down Sarah Connor and protect her from the Terminator. There are just a couple of snags when the theory is put into practice: Reese has next to no details on Sarah, except for her first name and the city she lives in. The second problem is the Terminator itself a cybernetic organism which looks human on the outside yet has a metal skeleton which can stand up to anything thrown at it. xt to no del The second books human thing TERMINATOR \"Terminator ranks as one of the most important releases on the Megadrive ever, and like everyone else I've been waiting ages Spl for it to arrive. Now it's here and what a blast this is! Pick yourself up from the unbelievable brill opening sequence (it's just like the film!) and get set for tons of pants-wetting thrills as you try to achieve the impossible and take on the Terminator in a fight to the death! Graphically, the game is superb one of the best looking games you're likely to see on the big Sega. Programmers Probe have managed to capture the feel of the film very well everything looks just like it should and there's plenty to see across all the levels. Animation is excellent and sound is quite a treat. It has to be said that the game itself is damn hard and will take quite a while to complete, but you're guaranteed to keep banging away until it's all over and you've flattened the metal monster good and proper. Basically this is one of the best titles yet seen on the Megadrive and you'd have to be a sad shambling sort of person to pass it up. If you're a Terminator fan you've just got to buy this cart it's as simple as that!\" TIM BOONE ese STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES I'LL BE BACK If you don't already know, The Terminator is based upon a movie of the same name. Released in 1984, it starred Michael Beihn and Linda Hamilton as Sergeant Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor respectively; but the star of the show was undoubtedly one Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger who played the Terminator unit itself. Costing less than ,000,000 to make, the film became a blockbuster, classed by many as the sci-fi film of the 1980s. The follow-up movie, called Terminator 2 Judgment Day, cost more than ten times the price of the prequel and re-united Arnie and Ms Hamilton in their previous roles. This time round though, the Terminator is a goodie, protecting Sarah against a new cyborg. If you're one of the eight people across the globe who have missed these films, we recommend you rush out and get 'em both on video now! GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % % % % 90 OVERALL GVG 021 "

Not only do we grab the EXCLUSIVE review of Megadrive Terminator before the rest of the known world even knows of its existence, but we also scoop the universe by picking up the Master System version too! How do we do it, eh? As long as we do it, that's all you need to know! SOWWATIFNEOGOTA NICE NIGHT FOR A WALK MASTER SYSTEM PLATFORM VIRGIN TBA \"The plot of Master System Terminator is, funnily enough, exactly the same as that of its big Megadive brother! Step into the shoes of sergeant Kyle Reese and yomp back in time to 1984, with thoughts of world salvation embedded firmly in your mind. Skynet has sent a T-800 Terminator to Los Angeles to kill Sarah Connor, mother-to-be of the man who, in years to come, will crush the domination of The Machines and bring peace to the planet. The fate of the world is in your hands ... \"Believe it or not, Terminator on the Master System isn't a kick in the pods off the quality of the Megadrive version! The little Sega holds its own, with some of the best displays of graphic excellence yet seen on the machine. The sad sonic capabilities of the Master System are pushed to the limit, to create an impressive version of the original movie tune and sound effects. Because of the limits of the Master System, it's gameplay that needs to stand out in order to get the game noticed. In this case, not only is The Terminator good to look at and listen to, it's also got that all-important playability. The Terminator is a very difficult game which should take even experienced gamers to complete. Three cheers to Probe and Virgin Games for producing a product well worth waiting eight years for!\" These screenshots can't really do the sprites in Terminator jusSo you've seen The Terminator tice you've just got to see them move!

Your version also has the brill intro that can be seen on the 16-bit game you know, the one from the start of the film where the Terminator logo scrolls across the screen in glorious Big-oVision (TM). It also has the great Terminator music playing in the background! What more could you ask for? Nothing, that's what! than in the Me the gooich realca \"A blast and a half for Master System fans and no mistake! Terminator on the little Sega is a long-overdue shot in the arm for the machine because this version actually manages to play better than its Megadrive counterpart!. As with the Megadrive version, Probe have delivered the good to turn in a smart little performer which really stretches the machine. Graphics are excellent considering the limitations of the machine and sound, whilst not exactly fantastic, is fair enough. Where this one really takes off is in the gameplay stakes it's wickedly tough but the compulsion to keep going takes hold very quickly and you won't want to put the pad down all night! Even the toughest of Master System gamers will find themselves challenged by this one, and that can't be bad! If you're only going to buy one Master System cartridge this year then I suggest you take a long hard look at this one and if you've got a Megadrive and Power Base converter then you should take a gander as well.

"CUNNING STUNTS! NINTENDO All of the vehicles are capable of some tremendous stunts (except the helicopters) and even the tanks can be persuaded to jump ramps. These ramps generally take the form of ordinary household objects, such as playing cards and tilted cereal boxes. On the pool table section, you get to zoom around the edges on a precarious precipice. Should you slide, it's a long way down to the pool room floor. A special bonus is available to the first car to enter the side and corner pockets. This bonus can also be gained if you reach the edge of the screen before your opponent (in two player mode). He warps to catch up, but loses points in the process. PLATFORM BY CAMERICA TBA Micro Machines Challenge RACE 2 DESKTOR You've all heard of Micro Machines, you know, the tiny little car models. Well, these little babies have made it to the small screen in an NES game from Code Masters, the budget geezers. The game takes place in a miniature world inhabited by the tiny cars and gives you the chance to race around breakfast tables, school desks, bathtubs and pool tables to name just a few! There are lots of entrants in these races, each one weirder than the last and they'll make life difficult for you and each other. So, choose your car, choose your course and get going for a spot of mini racing! THE TRACK PACK There's a total of 27 tracks to complete before you finish the game and each track presents a brand new challenge. The races take place (in miniature) on a variety of surfaces. These include the Bermuda Bathtub, a foam filled bath packed with hazards, the Gargae Floor covered in old tools and oil spills and the Sandpit too many pebbles and not enough traction. CROMACHUNTES WACKY RACES \"The first thing thought when I stuck the Micromachines cart in the NES was Supercars because this does look similar to the Gremlin racer and that's actually a good thing because Supercars is one of my faves. The appeal is that everything happens in a miniature world and the graphics portray this perfectly the attention to detail is perfect and impressive while sound effects are great and the music even better. The game has a huge 27 tracks and it'll take ages to complete them all. This title oozes playability and the variety of game styles will have you hooked from the off. A gem.\" You control a fairly wide range of vehicles in Micro Machines including boats, cars and trucks. Obviously boats are used in water and in this case, the bath. The other vehicles are used on a variety of surfaces and the gameplay changes depending which car and which track you choose.

"GVG SUPER NINTENDO NITROUS NONSENSE! DRIVING BY KEMCO .00 THERE'S A HELLUVA LOT GOING ON HERE AND YOU'LL NEED TO STAY FROSTY TO SURVIVE WITHOUT CACKING YOUR PANTS IN THE HOT SEAT! room! Parp! Voosh! Yes, it's that time of the day again when you leap into the cockpit of your supercharged racer and tear blindly around a twisting track for no apparent reason. Driving games are ten a penny and so they need to be something special to stand out. Top Gear from Kemco could be just that. There's no story, only some sad excuse for racing exotic motorcars around danger infested tracks. The cars are all based on real-life supercars, including Testarossas, Lamborghini Diablos and the ugly but speedy Alfa Z1. The cars have been subtly disguised and the game is a sort of Out Run variant with twisting roads and rolling hills. The difference between this game and most other console racers, is that two players can race simultaneously. So, put on your crash helmet, slide into your driving gloves and put that pedal to the metal. Vroom! You start the game with a tank containing three boosts of Nitrous Oxide. When injected into the fuel compression unit, this forces fuel into the combustion chamber at an incredible rate. It also makes the petrol burn faster and with explosive results. The car gets a sudden boost in acceleration as well as top speed. There are many ways to use Nitrous, but in two player mode, you'll have to be fairly strategic. Some players use all their boosts at the start, in order to build up a massive lead, while others wait until near the end of the course. Brainy players however, will use them only when they absolutely have to. LOTUS RELATED MALARKEY! Fans of the classic Amiga game Lotus Turbo Challenge, may notice some similarities between this and the classic Gremlin racer. They'd be right too, because Gremlin actually programmed this for Japanese geezers, Kemco. The game itself is very similar in both graphic style and gameplay to Lotus, but has been greatly improved, with more options, more cars and more tracks. The two player mode has been borrowed from Lotus 2, the sequel and it works a treat. If this is the standard of the very first Gremlin SNES release, we can't wait to see what else they've got up their sleeves! \"How To Make a Great Game, Lesson One: Get a spanky console like the Super Nintendo and take it to bits to find out how it ticks. Learn about sprite scaling and things like that, then chuck them all out, stick to what you know and deliver a game so brilliant it doesn't need any frills! That's what Gremlin have done with Top Gear, and they've turned in one of the most brilliantly simple and simply_brilliant Super Nintendo games yet seen! Graphics are reasonable and sound is cool but gameplay is so brilliant every other softco in the world should start cacking their pants right about now!

This must be the only SNES game which makes no use whatsoever of the fabled custom chips to do its stuff. Admittedly, the graphics are wonderful dead colourful, super-slick and extremely good looking. Sure the animation on the cars is faultless and the special effects are smart, but there's no scaling, no rotation and no funny business. This is an honest to goodness, straightforward racing sim and a beauty at that. The music and sound effects are absolutely superb, adding atmosphere style and realism to the game. The controls are perfect and the options brilliant. In one player mode, you won't be able to leave your SNES until you've completed the game, but with two players, you won't leave your SNES...ever! Respect is due to Gremlin for this playable commotion of fun-filled frivolity. Console purists may think it looks like a computer game, but it's one of the best computer games of all time. The simple fact is, if you like going fast and you've got a SNES, then you have to get Top Gear!\" Opinion about the world's greatest cars varies wildly, but I'm dead brainy me, so I think I'll put the record straight once and for all. Ferrari's amazing F40 just makes it with an awesome 201 mph top speed. The Porsche 959 is a bit slower, but much more sophisticated. The fastest production car in the world is probably the new Jaguar XJ 220 which can achieve a staggering 214 mph. If you want to go faster, you'll have to specialise. The Callaway Corvette is a twin-turbo, super aspirated completely customised Corvette Stingray, which can top 240 mph! If all this is too much, then how about Jon Billington's WW Polo? This crazy death-machine has been known to beat the fabled 200mph mark but only when you push it off a cliff... 1 02-0088 1ST FRANK O'CONNOR GOTO 5 Isti E TOP START 3 STRATEGY SKILL 02'03\"76 GEAR. 2ND PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL AND GO FOR IT, BOYO! 00 Oo ACTION REFLEXES TWO PLAYER ACTION! Top Gear is fairly unique amongst racing games (especially SNES racers) in that it has a two player mode. The screen is split horizontally with player one controlling the top half of the screen and player two on the lower half. This allows you to race a pal, the beauty of which is that you can see your friend as he overtakes you. As you can imagine, this makes Top Racer a fiercely competitive game. The computer controls the bottom car in one player mode so you still have a definite target to beat. You can both choose the same car but real heroes will choose their personal favourite.

"CVG REVE MEGADRIVE DRIVING BY ACCOLADE .99 Lp 1 1 Nitr06 1110LT. The crowds are gathering. The engines are revving. The bikinis are overflowing. It's the Super OffRoad meet, the place where top drivers get together to test their racing skills on a variety of tricky tracks in the hope of winning a bolt-load of money to soup up their four-wheel drive racing trucks. You're one of the privileged few with the talent to race your heart out against the cream of the offroad crop but have you got what it takes to get to the front and stay there? You'll be pumping out the horses on a stack 'o' tracks against three computer opponents or two Megadrive drivers and a friend. There are prizes at the end of each race if you finish high enough in the placings and a parts shop where you can spend all your lovely lolly. The spectators are getting restless get out there and show 'em what you're made of! YES, WELL, SHE DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT RACING BUT MANDY HERE DOES KNOW ALL ABOUT BIG CUPS... NITRO NABBING After a lap or so of trailing the other trucks, it'll suddenly dawn on you that it was probably not a wise decision to fritter away your loot on accelerators and stuff right at the start of the game, when what you really should have grabbed was nitros. But don't be too downhearted, because throughout the CASH game special nitro packs appear on B100000 the courses! Be quick about getting them, as the other racers are just as hungry for 'em. If you happen to be SFEED 100 pipped to the nitro-grabbing post, there's usually another set on the next lap, or a big bag of money that you can use to buy some more come the end of the race!

This classic had you racing against cars on a variety of tracks, with the objective of coming first in each race and racking up a load of cash to buy add-ons for your murter. Super Off-Road is a total rip-off of this ace racer, but with new power-ups, souped-up speed and gorgeous graphics, this tiring genre can more than hold its own in the crazy, cut-and-thrust world of coin-ops!

Just about every aspect of the arcader is in there (admittedly a tad toned down in one or two places) but playability has been tuned to the max to make sure you just keep on playing! Graphics are fine, animation good (although the SNES does have the drop in this department) and sound a bit of alright.

The further up the field you finish, the greater the amount of prize money you'll collect. The winner picks up ,000, while second scores ,000 and third pockets a measly fifty grand.

"258 358 X HR REVIEW HVA GET A LOAD OF THIS YOUR MATE'S SPARK OUT BUT YOU'RE STILL UP! SUPER NINTENDO BEAT 'EM UP SQUATTING ON THE PAN WHAT HAVE I STOOD IN? THQ .00 BOD There are three fighters to choose from and you'll soon find a firm favourite. Ty is a top Kickboxer who uses a cool mixture of boxing and karate. His special move is a spectacular jump-kick. Kato is a kung fu master who uses the ancient Chinese art with speed and skill. His special move is a rapid succession of lightning punches. This leaves his guard down for a counter-attack. Buzz is a wrestler, he's fat and slow but very strong. His special move is so sad it's not worth doing! One of the best things about the arcade machine was that there were lots of obstacles lying around the floor of the arena. Don't just avoid them though, pick them up and use them as weapons. A well aimed strike with a great big crate will knock lumps out of your average foe. Watch out though, because the bad guys can use these handy weapons too. Look out for knives also which can be used to stab or throw. These really do some damage but again, they can be used against you too. Strangely though, all these goodies are completely absent from the SNES game... what a stinker! The fact is, the game's not very interesting without the handy pick-ups and leaving them out seems very strange indeed, taking a lot out of the game. Vumite. The illegal martial arts Acontests which take place all over the world. Fighters from different schools of fighting assemble in dark warehouses and fight for money and sometimes for their lives. Three of the world's best, Ty, Buzz and Kato arrive at a secret location in New York, firm friends and training partners. They discover that a mysterious figure is controlling the fight. His fighter, a faceless man in a hockey mask must win at any cost... WTED PIEEE 2 UNICURE YOU MADE IT BEEEEEEEEEEE EP... FLRTLINE VITT 09 U-BEND ROLLERCOASTER! At the end of each fight you will zip off to a bonus screen to rack up some points. You stand on a forklift truck while the money you have earned piles up.The points are awarded for time taken and moves used. In the arcade version, to get a nice hefty bonus, you have to kick the geezers while they're down. When they've fallen, you can jump on them and hit them with crates. Not only does this kill them quicker, it also gives you a to Console Concepts massive score! Sadly though, (0782 712759) there's no such bonus on the for the review cartridge. SNES version. What a bummer! THANKS \"Well, here it is. Pitfighter on the SNES and what a treat it is...not. The Atari coin-op was an instant classic, with digitised graphics, superb animation and three-player action. The SNES version is a different kettle of fish. The graphics are only impressive until they start moving And then things go horribly wrong. The animation is totally tragic. There are very few frames and the fighters jerk spasmodically across the screen. Sprite scaling, the thing that looked ace on the arcade machine, has been totally ignored. The music is a sad travesty of a tune. Instead of butch grunts and screams, the blokes sound like they're throwing up. Playability is the saddest part of all. There isn't any because the game has no difficulty curve. The final opponent is easier than most, but you'll probably turn it off long before you reach him. So far, this is the crappest game on the SNES and possibly one of the crappest games of all time. Stinky, stinky, stinky!

"SAND THE NUN SAID: \"CROCODILES!\" Pain's mosierything your host will letters and YEEEEUUURGHHHH! Welcome to another side-splittingly brilliant Yob's Mailbag, Britain's most outrageous letters page stuffed full with everything you need to know about games! Once again your host with the most has waded through your liveliest letters and come up trumps with the cream of the crap to supply loads of laffs to all and sundry and a few punchline headlines to boot. If you think you're up to the standard of wit wisdom you'll find on these pages then fire off your best efforts to: YOB'S LAFF A MINUTE MAILBAG, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. Remember I've got  in used fivers to give away to the best letters of the lot, odd bits of software to deserving causes and bog all except the odd insult for sad efforts like most of these... Dear YOB, I reckon my brother (who is called Rachid) is the best Game Gear player ever! He got his Game Gear in September '91. At Christmas he got Shinobi. In February '92 he completed it and in January '92 he got Sonic and now he's just finished it. He's also nearly completed Wonderboy! So, is that enough to play the CVG challenge or what? I think he, at least, should have some software. How about WWF for my NES? KEVIN BENAICHA, Plaistow, London. YOB: Dear Rachid, I reckon your brother (who is called Kevin) is the most annoying little toad in this month's Mailbag. Not only does he have a mouth bigger than the Dartford tunnel, he's also stupid enough to think you've set some sort of record. What about the rest of you lot out there? Who reckons they're the greatest games hero and why? Write in and tell me, and there may be a special prize for the best letter of the lot. YOBS M. GOOD, YOUR NOSE IS RUNNING... NO, IT'S JUST THE WAY I WALK Dear YOB, I'm a trifle bogged off at the fact that Sonic The Hedgehog is being released on the Amiga. It's not as if I want to be selfish or that I don't like the Amiga, it's just that I think Sega, like Nintendo, should use Sonic as a Mario type trade mark and not let the Amiga get the upper hand again. PS The Amiga is a very impressive machine from what I've seen, even though I'm a Megadrive owner. MIKE K-C TSE, Saint Marks, Isle Of Man. evo 40 YOB: And you're not at all selfish, are you? Why shouldn't a character as skill as Sonic be converted if Sega give the game their blessing? Why shouldn't Amiga owners join the Sonic sensation? After all, enough Amiga games have been converted to Megadrive or perhaps you'd conveniently forgotten about that. I don't know, some people. Incidentally, just to stop you being a sad and insecure Megadrive owner for much longer, I might as well tell you that if Sonic does make his way onto the Amiga the conversion will be timed to coincide with Sonic II on the Megadrive, so people like you can still crow on and on about your machine having the latest games. Happy now? Dear YOB, Hi. I'm the proud owner of a Megadrive and my friend is going to get a Super NES. My favourite type of game is a beat 'em up and I have got Streets Of Rage and I was wondering if you would answer a few questions for me: 1. Are there any WWF titles set for the Megadrive? 2. Is Street Fighter 2 going to be released on the Megadrive? 3. Are there any plans for Streets Of Rage 2? 4. Is it true that Nintendo are going to release a colour Game Boy which can run old Game Boy carts? 5. Have you heard anything about the Sega Gigadrive? DEAN SLARK, Someplace, Somewhere. 1. Yup, but it might be awhile before you see them. 2. Yup but that's all I'm saying for now! 3. I haven't heard anything definite, but if there isn't I'll eat my cat. 4. Yes to the first bit, no to the second. 5. Yes. "


"EEURGH! WHAT A PRITCHARD) SURPRISE! I'M THE BUS CONDUCTOR! Dear YOB, I read your so called Mailbag pages and want to say that you're sadder than Russell Grant, Noel Edmonds and Terry Wogan all crunched up into one person. I hate to inform you ('coz I love watching geeks like you making a prat out of themselves) but your spiky hair and polyester jacket went out with the Gazza craze. Come to think of it why is a cool cat like myself writing to an obvious scumbag like you anyway? Don't answer, just do your damn job and answer my excellent questions. 1. Isn't my Game Boy the best hand-held out? 2. What (not including those Mario geek games) is the best NES cart? 3. How can I keep the constant swarm of gorgeous females away from me? (even studs need a rest.) MA PRITCHARD, Swindon, Wilts. Broadly speaking, there are three types of people who write to Yob's Mailbag. 1. Intelligent people with decent questions about games. 2. Pretty useless, but I put up with them by putting them down. 3. Brain dead cretins who crawl out of holes and shouldn't bother waking up because nobody will miss them if they sleep in all day. Now we have a new category: 4. MA Pritchard of Swindon, Wilts. ONE PINT NOW! OES IT AFTER ONE YOB: OK, you win. You've summed yourself up perfectly and there's nothing I can add. Next... HE DOES IT AS Dear YOB. I challenge you to an insult match. You crustation from a baboon's rear end, you fermenting parrot saliva, you steaming great bucket of horse cack, you Leeds United fan, you ape-house inhabitant. Beat that! DOMINIC TURNER, Blackpool. RUCKSACK! OUT WITH MY HE'S JUST JUMPED Dear YOB, I was going to write you up a bum-lick letter, but I thought again because I knew you would just insult me, so I decided to do it for you. OK, I am a prat on a brick. Looking in the mirror reminds me of a cat turd fresh lying on the pavement. I am an idiot, my family are all crap at everything and I pick my nose and eat it. How about sending me a Tshirt? GEORGE WHEATLEY, Chichester, W Sussex. YOB: I would if you weren't such a cretin... Cub 041 "


"OH, THAT WOULD BE MY RABBIT... I WILL IF YOU WON'T.. SCOITO I CAN'T I'VE KNOWN THEM SINCE THEY WERE THAT HIGH... YO YOBster! How ya doin' matey? OK? Good, 'cos I've got a bone to pick with you and the rest of the CVG gang! In a certain issue (I'm not exactly sure which one), you described the GX4000 as 'a console which could go far in the console world. What sort of tripe is that? Everyone knows that the GX4000 is about as good as having 468 pineapples shoved up your rear end! Were you and the rest of your crew' as you call them, quite right in the bonce? This has seriously ruined my belief in you. I thought you were a God-like genius. Ha! How wrong I was! PAUL 'Whoopty-Doo' McPARLIN, Aberystwyth, Wales. ANTIPRAT BRAIN CORRELTOR Dear Doctor Bendancoff, Thanks for your letter requesting me to recommend patients for immediate shock therapy on your new Antiprat Brain Corrector. Please find Alex Pollard's address enclosed. If the prototype works on him, I suggest you go into full production as quickly as possible. ODABE Dear YOB, I've got another depressing load of cacky questions. Here they are: 1. Dear YOB, | Would you like a do-it-yourself golden buttock kit? 2. Is it true that How are we today. after the pain you've got a brand new pair of rollerskates? 3. Why aren't you going to ful diarrhea spill last week? I bet print this letter? 4.

I hope you don't use IBMs because everyone has one of them out here and they are really startiny to piss me off in the third degree.

I'd better not say much more as readers might get destructive and fart on my letter. MATT WOODALL, S Africa.

TOTALLY COOL Britain Did your mother remember to remove the dummy from your bum before she sent you to COOL school today? Just to warn you all: from next issue I'm only printing letters from people with the guts to use their own name, so pathetic verruca-heads like Totally here will be wasting their time and money if they're not hard enough to stand up to my wit and wisdom. You have been warned. Oh dear oh dear. Did the doctor mistake you for a leek when you were born and put you in his shopping bag next to the other vegetables? When we said the GX4000 should go far that's precisely what we meant as far as possible from our sight. It's just a shame that you're a typical Taffy turd with no brain and the joke was wasted on your feeble mind. A LITTLE RAW... Dear YOB. I thought I would write in and say what I think about the world of computers. About four years ago I got an Amstrad CPC 664. I thought it was amazing. Then last year I got an Amiga and put the old Amstrad in the spare room. Now I need some money to get some turntables and I can't sell the Amstrad because everybody now has consoles and handhelds. It's worth about  but I can't even sell it for . When I first started to read CVG it was for every computer, but now even you don't review games for the Speccy, C64 or Amstrad. What I'm saying is that I know the world of computers is going forward, but you could still review games for the old computers. And another thing, why does it seem like everyone who reads your magazine seems to use words like \"baboon\", \"fart\" and \"Marks & Spencer's\"? SCOTT BRIDGES, Stafford. YOB: Because they may be shuffling baboons with dry farts for brains, but all our readers know a good shop when they see one... (YEAH, REALY ERO HOTD 042 "


"7 NOT EVERYONE GETS UP THE EIFFEL TOWER... IF I FIND A CURRY IN HERE I'M NOT PAYING EITHER... Dear YOB, No, I'm not writing to you spamhead, I'm writing to that really mega, brill person Tim Boone. Since he has become Editor, CVG has vastly improved, I mean there are actually regular PC Engine reviews, sometimes more than one in an issue, ooer I've become moist with excitement. My mates and I, all Engine owners, have now started buying your fab mag again, instead of just flicking through it on the newsagent shelves and sticking the Megadrive review pages together with nose droppings. So here's to you Tim, the only happening guy at CVG. PS Can I please have a T-Shirt Tim? Size L. PPS Dominik Diamond is a spamhead. Tim for presenter. DEREK GARFORTA, Gt Yarmouth, Norfolk. YOB: If it's a free T-shirt you're after, you've written all the right things. Trouble is, you sent your letter to the wrong place which wins you this month's award of Saddest Man in the Mailbag and the special COMPLETE prize of YOB's first ever Certificate of Crapness. This is quite an accolade and you can be justly proud. Even Dominik Diamond hasn't got one, but then again he's not a sad shambling idiot with a brain the size of a used teabag like you. Next... Dear YOB, I am just writing in to complain about the Megadrive. The Megadrive costs a lot to start with, but it is the cost of the games which really get to me. It takes ages to save up for one game, and when you have, the game can usually be finished in a few weeks even though it was meant to be quite tough. Then there is the CD ROM which appears to have graphics slightly better than the Megadrive's, and costs loads. There is so much speculation over it, and the whole situation seems in a right muddle. There are four types of CD ROM, and they won't work with any other machine except their own! You can also not use cartridges on the Mega CD ROM. I finish by saying that the Megadrive costs too much money and takes up too much time. If the games were cheaper, it would be a lot more popular. TRISTON KIRCHER, Colchester, Essex. YOB: If you don't like your Megadrive, why don't you give it away to someone who will actually get some fun out of it. Then they could write funny and informative letters to me and it wouldn't be such a drudge replying to rubbish like this... QUICK, SAY YOB: I keep telling people there's only one mag that reHAMBURGER! ally knows about games. After all, we're paid oodles of cash Dear YOB, to sit about all day playing all As I was reading through this the latest stuff so's we can tell months copy of (can't read the you what's hot and what's not writing but I think it's some while other sad mags spend all sad Sega mag YOB) and I saw their time trying to con you the name Mercs so I went and into buying them. Simple, eh? checked out the ratings. It only got two out of five and the comments where 'don't buy it because it's crap', whilst in CVG it got an overall of 93 out of one hundred and the comments were basically 'buy it now!'. I own Mercs and it is excellent. I am certainly not buying (still can't read the writing YOB) any more but I will stick to CVG because it's fab! KARL ROSE. Gibralter. Til YOU COULD HAVE HAD CARPETS FITTED... Dear YOB, Ha! Thought you could fool us again with another hot piece of technical wizardry. I must admit I was fooled by your A-Miga-Drive scam but I am glad to say you didn't fool me this time. 'What is he talking about?' I hear you ask, it is of course your amazing April fool scoop about HOLOSTAR 2000 Home virtuality. I'm sure plenty of gullible readers were taken in by the Neo Geo and the Sega 3D specs with holograms on the lenses and those totally crap screenshots. But not I. Sorry guys, you will have to think of something better next year. RICHARD CRESSWELL, Solihull, West Midlands. YOB: We've already got it planned. Next year we're telling everyone that Richard Cresswell is moving in next door, bringing his artificial intelligence, chronic flatulence TID LIKE A and mind-numbingly boring letHOLOSTAR 2000) ters with him... FOOTPRINTS IN THE BUTTER THE BREAST STROKE, I THINK... Dear YOB, Only the other day I was blasting on Streets Of Rage, absolutely kicking seven bells out of Mr Big, and all of a sudden it hit me. 'This game is crap!' I thought. I've completed it several billion times and I now know where every baddy appears, even on hardest. It was then I caught the shape of a black object in the corner of my eye. As I looked, there it was. My dusty black Spectrum+. Feeling in a strange mood, I plugged in the Speccie for the first time in over three years. Reaching under my bed, I pulled a long cardboard box which contained dusty old Speccie games and after playing games like Olli and Lisa and The New Zealand Story, I thought, 'these games are brilliant, they're the most top quality games around, and they're not 40'. It just goes to prove that it's not graphics and sound that make a game. It's the gameplay that makes games. Take games like Klax and Tetris that are brilliant and have both scored in the 90's. Everyone take note: buy gameplay games, not graphics games. Otherwise you're wasting your money. B SHINGLETON, Leigh on Sea, Essex. YOB: Does anyone hear an echo around here? I've been telling you lot for ages that it's gameplay that really counts above everything, which is why you'll still find people in CVG Towers glued to games like Asteroids on the Gameboy! As machines get better, the games get bigger and more impressive but the second they lose sight of gameplay they're lost. Having said all that, I think you're being a bit sad and stupid about Streets Of Rage. Just because you've played it to death doesn't mean the game is crap. If anything it means you are because you haven't worked out that you need a new cartridge. Doh! Dear YOB, I am writing to you from down under and it's not a very pleasant site here for computer lovers. Why is it that video game systems are so rare down under? To my knowledge only the NES, Master System, Megadrive, Game Boy, Game Gear and Lynx is out in Australia. Not only that but there is a shortage of games out here as well. Hardly any good games come are here, the Game Gear came out not long ago and there are still only six games available for the system! Why do companies think Australia is not important? We may only have seventeen million people here, but most of us are computer loving kids! Doesn't the world think Australia is important enough? I would like to know if the Super Famicom and Neo Geo will be coming to Aussie land and if it does how much will it cost in Aussie dollars and when will it be coming out? If not, WHY? Please publish this letter as Australian computer lovers (including me) would really like to know. PS Could you tell me how many bits the Neo Geo has? JOHN CUIULI, Australia YOB: I'm going to put my sensible hat on here and say I have to agree with you. I think it's an outrage of outrageously outrageous proportions that Australians are treated as outcasts when it comes to games. I guess it must come down to distribution you live in such an incredibly big country that shipping the stuff to your shops must cost a bomb. Why not play clever and order your goodies from reputable British mail order companies using international money orders? That way you'll get to play all the latest stuff with only a slight delay for postage. Maybe other overseas gamers out there have got better ideas. Write to the host with the most I'll print some of the best and may even stump up some software for the top of the lot. PS 16 and 8, but if you think that makes it a 24-bit machine you'd be as thick as one sad mag writer I saw say on telly... 043 "


"HE CAN'T, HE'S GOT NO NOSE... TROUBLE IS, WE HAVEN'T CAUGHT ONE YET... QUACK HE'S HERE IN MY POCKET! Dear YOB, Why do lots of computer magazines around lie? You are one of the few exceptions. I am talking about what they print on their covers. One sad Sega mag prints at the top of the cover every issue 'Britain's Best Selling Sega Magazine', and yet so does another crap mag and about three quarters of British computer magazines for sale, and only one magazine is telling the truth. It bugs me and I expect it bugs other readers too. Anyway, before I sit down and have a slice of tea and a cup of cake, I would be very grateful (chortle) if you could answer these questions: 1. Is Streets Of Rage any good for the Megadrive? 2. Is Alex Kidd for the Megadrive worth buying? 3. Will there be a Sonic II? If so, when? 4. I own a Megadrive myself, but don't you hate the people who write in and say things like 'I own a Megadrive, from which I get immense pleasure....' (chortle) Thanks a lot! And keep up the great mag! JOHN SPARROW (chortle) Slough. YOB: The reason CVG doesn't have to waste you time with crap claims is because everybody knows we're the world's greatest games mag, so why go on about it all the time when we could be filling the space with more games? Anyone will tell you that CVG, GO!, Mean Machines and Megatech are the best sellers in Britain, so we don't have to bother! Some snuffling mags will do anything to shift a few issues, and if you're unfortunate enough to buy one all i can suggest is that you save money on Andrex and put them to the functional use they so richly deserve. Anyway, seeing as you had the good sense to laugh at your surname, here are a few answers: 1. Buy it now. 2. Don't buy it ever. 3. Yep. Christmas. 4.1 hate it when people write in and say they hate it when people write in and say they love their machines but I love it when people write in and say they hate people who write in and say they hate it when people write in and say they love their machines.

"THE GREATEST ARCADESENE 1500 VES! No sooner does Streetfighter '92 slam its way into your local arcade (and we get an arcade board in the office!) than the galaxy's greatest games mag brings you this outrageously brilliant and utterly FREE pullout guide! And if that's not enough, it's been put together by the people, who know best the CVG boys and Mean Machines' Streetfighter II champ Gary Harrod one of the top players in the country! So without further ado here's our EXCLUSIVE guide to everything you need to know about the Championship Edition of The Greatest Arcade Game Ever. Kick ass! PLAYER SELECT SPAR VEGA SPAIN: Vega has re-entered the chamoionship to perfect his combat techniques after wiping out the entire crowd down at the chippy after they forgot to put vinegar on his saveloy. To him, the contest is more than just winning or losing, it's all about matching his athletic excellence with his ferocious fighting skills. Word is this boy's the fastest contestant in the line-up and that his speed even surpasses that of the legendary Chun Li! What he lacks in variety he makes up with special attacks that leave underpants dripping acros the world. His killing techniques, like the Barcelona Attack and the dreaded Izna Drop, are some of the deadliest in the game! S.A.   BRAYIL AT BALROG UP BALROG 3002 HI 82302 2P 82002 RYU 37 BALRUG BALROG USA: Since his arrival in Las Vegas, Balrog has defeated all challengers in the ring and declared himself the greatest fighter in the world. Now he's busy searching for the ultimate contest before he blows all his cash on the fruit machines and has to get the bus home without a ticket and risk getting beaten up by the inspector... He's the only character in the game with no kick attacks, which may sound a bit poofy but isn't 'cos he's hard as nails. All six buttons operate his staggering variety of punch attacks, which include a Timing Punch (a double strength rolling attack) and a well hard Dashing Straight Punch which can deck an opponent even if they block! He's also the proud owner of a great new move first used in this game the Smashing Head Butt, which has to be seen to be believed! "


"WHAT DID YOU SAY? Capcom's Streetfighter Il ranks head and shoulders above everything else as the most succesful arcade beat-em-up ever, and even makes the running for title of Most Succesful Arcade Game in the History of the World! First released just under two years ago, the game was an immediate runaway hit across the globe and you'll still have to wait around in the queue to get a go today! Loads of people who really should have known better put forward all sorts of theories why the game is so popular, but the end it's perfectly simple it's the best beat 'em up there is! Now, by popular demand, Capcom have programmed a new version of the classic game. Contrary to rumour that Streetfighter '92 would be Streetfighter III (that's still to come) the game is a special Championship Edition boasting brand new features and graphics to keep the machine as the top of the arcade pile for a while! DUUU 21 SAGAT SAGAT THAILAND: Boxing champ Sagat has returned to the tournament to avenge himself against Ryu, who once flattened him with the Dragon Punch. All Sagat's mates down the domino club reckoned he was a bit of a wimp for that, so he's come back to crush all who stand against him. Two of his attacks are the Tiger Upper Cut a devastating Thai-style Dragon Punch and the Grand Mystical Tiger, although we're not going to tell you what that is or it wouldn't be very mystical doh! New moves added for the Champion Edition include the ability to throw his opponents and a super-fast Flying Knee Attack! What a boy! BISON SECRET SOCIETY OF SHADLUE: The mystical Ruler of Shadlue, Bison can harness the energies of the Earth to create a mystical aura with which to attack his enemies. No, that doesn't mean he hits them with a dry fart because he's a mystic and they don't do things lik that. Truly this 'lad is the most enigmatic character in the history of the Tournament, with special moves so secret we daren't tell you about them unless 'he unleashes a mystical aura in the office after a couple of chicken vindaloos.Challenge him if you dare and don't say you weren't warned! 301 MIN 50000 2P1201 KO bizt TI R ISURE SAY THAT AGAIN.. The best new feature of the Championship Edition is that it's now possible to select the four previously computer-controlled characters Bison, Balrog, Sagat and Vega! What this means is that you can now use all those bloody annoying computer moves that kept finishing you off when you were s bit sad and kept getting your butt booted by the machine! Another improvement is that it's now possible for both human players to select the same character so that nobody can whinge on and on about you nicking the best fighter! Thoughtful as ever, Capcom have adapted the graphics so you can still tell who's who as you leap about the screen kicking seven shades of grey out of your identical twin brother! Besides the four new characters with their special moves to master, new manoevres have also been added to the existing characters, so you're in for a few surprises from your old favourites and this is the place to read all about 'em... WHO WILL TRIUMPH? "

"05:00 ! PERIOD HUB BUE REVIEW MEGADRIVE 000 OHODA OO SPORT SIM BY SEGA .99 TOTALLY SKILL! You can set up the skill of your team based on six characteristics Shooting, Power, Speed, Passing, Defence and Goalie. You can only award a certain number of points to these levels and so you have to decide what your idea of a well balanced team is. Once you've assigned the points to the characteristics, you can save these by means of a password system. The default settings are reasonable enough, although the computer selected goalie is rubbish. He lets in just about everything and causes penalties! What a sad space waster! FACE OFF STUPIDITY The Face Off happens on several occasions during the game. If possession of the puck is in dispute, then the captains of the two sides have to battle for control of it. This seems to happen quite a lot, especially when the goalie gets done for holding the little blighter, and a combination of frantic button pressing and blind luck decides who gets it. The silly thing about this is that if you do get the puck your player automatically slams it to a member of the opposition and it's actually worth losing the puck just to gain possession. This tends not to happen when you're at the far ends of the rink so be careful! 105800 04848 TO PERSTOD ED e's mad, he's bad, he's got a Ivery silly name and he plays ice hockey. Mario Lemieux is one of North America's greatest ice hockey exponents, although nobody in this country has ever heard of him. There are a ton of ice hockey games available on consoles and it took EA Hockey to get everyone interested. Well, this game takes a similar format in that it's a sort of scrolling soccer on ice. Diehard hockey fans will probably be well miffed at that description, but that's exactly what it is. The object of the game is simple pass the puck and score goals. Use whatever means necessary to get that disc in the net, and a bit of violence isn't always out of the question... PL KUD ONDO OECD OD DO MARIO LEMIEUX L22 Arts mas graphicle fast puust does as KUNG FU CAPERS? DU \"Yet another console Ice Hockey game and here was me thinking that EA had the genre wrapped up. Well, fact is, they still do! As groovy as Mario Lemieux is, it just doesn't compare with the fast pace and the smooth graphics of the Electronic Arts masterpiece. The actual presentation of Mario Lemieux is fabulous. Smart graphics, good sound and a massive array of options. The scrolling is smooth, the controls are fine and the game moves and plays perfectly well. The fighting breaks up the game nicely and you may find you'll have more fun scrapping than playing. Sadly however, there seems to be something missing. It could be speed, it could be that_spark of addiction, but the fact is, the game just ain't right. It's all Electronic Arts fault you know. If they would just bring out a mediocre sports sim once in a while, all the other software companies would be in with a chance. Not a bad effort, but by no means an essential purchase.\" You can duck, sway, punch, jab and uppercut and the loser gets sent off to the sin bin, so it's well worth winning the scraps.

"QUE REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO SPORTS SIM ELECTRONIC ARTS .00 TOUR GOL 83-02 71501 rolf, it's a funny old game isn't it? Oops sorry, wrong sport. Golf, it's all balls isn't it? Well, one at least (unless you're a complete shambles at the game and you keep losing them in rivers and things!). Now that PGA has finally made it onto the Super Nintendo it's a bit silly for us to explain the rules of golf (as if you don't know them already). But as we try our best to be informative, we'll explain anyway. The idea is to get your little white ball into the hole at the other end of the course in the least amount of shots possible. Easy, I hear you cry, ha! Just wait until you get onto the fairway you'll soon see that it's . more than just a Toad of old balls! CHEERS GUYS! To help you out with each course, a top international player gives you his handy tips on what not to do. Handy things like avoid the bunkers' and 'there's a big river, so be careful' come up and aid you in best possible way (ahem!). Seriously though, some of the handy hints do actually guide you to do the right thing and if you ignore them you'll look a bit stupid. Entering a course for the first time not knowing what's where is very silly. After all, you're not going to impress the ladies by whacking it right over the hole with a five iron, are you? FOURSOME FROLICS! A good feature of PGA is the ability to have up to four players at once. This is a great laugh as you can have some of your mates round, get the popcorn and coke in and have a jolly great time! You each take it in turn to take your whack at the ball, which adds great comedy value to a Sunday evening when there's nothing on the box.

PGA Tour Golf on all other formats has become the essential golfing game, but the SNES version isn't quite as good somehow! The main difference is the view of your shot it follows the ball in a quirky fashion and when the ball lands it's as if there's been a sudden earth quake it rushes along the ground and slams to a sudden halt. In many other respects though, PGA is almost identical to all other versions. The graphics and animation are more than functional, the music is a great composition and the sound effects are standard thuds and thwacks. Basically, if you can put up with iffy graphics and weird perspective, this is a damned decent golf game just waiting to be explored. Worth a try, but don't expect miracles...\" TIM BOONE cVG 068 MONEY! MONEY MONEY! As all Top International Stars know, millions of dollars are dished out to people whose face appears on the telly! If you manage to win at Sawgrass you'll receive $1,600,00, Avenel 1,000,000, PGA West 1,280,000 and Eagle Trace 1,000,000. Why do mere golfers receive such massive bundles like this? If hitting a little white ball around a giant field earns the respect of receiving the sum of 1,600,000, why doesn't everyone go out and buy some clubs now? Just because Top international playboys like ourselves receive such amounts, doesn't mean people who have a name like Nick or Sevy should get the same! After all, what do they know about games? PLAY IT AGAIN SAM! You've just teed off, the sun is beating down, the crowd is restless, the rabbits are fidgeting in their burrows and the ball goes high. It glides through the air at immense speed and eventually lands on the green it travelled over 300 yards. An instant replay hurrah! When ever you manage to hit the ball over 300 yards you're given an instant replay, this is quite pointless, but at least it allows you to show off to all of your friends...

In the tournament you're up against 61 players who can all play! If you're new to golf then this is going to be a major challenge for you. As each round goes on, people are knocked out until a winner is decided. When playing one round, you simply choose the course you want to play and smack the golf ball around it which, it has to be said, is a fun thing to do when there's not much on the telly... \"The first thing think when you see PGA on the SNES is \"yuk\". This is mainly due to the iffy graphics and a palling scrolling. This as it turns out, is a fairly minor niggle as the simple playability just about makes up for it. The poor scrolling has been caused by sad programming and little understanding of what the SNES' mode seven is capable of. There are no vector graphics in this conversion, but the multiple viewpoints are there. The game comes down to a mixture of common sense and good timing and the large variety of holes and courses help. The sound is a tad tragic with a low-quality rendition of the original Rob Hubbard score. Sound effects are smart, with bird calls and whooshing swoops as you whack the ball. The variety of options is impressive and you can have up to four players at one time. For team laffs, this is unbeatable and has at least that advantage over other Fammy golf games.

"BUG REVIEW HVA CARE 8 , 2017 REVIEW) // AMIGA Lap 6 th DRIVING IT'S THE PITS! Pit stops are one of the most important features of this game and learning when and how to use them is crucial. The pits are located at the starting line and so you always know where to go. The problem is that your car drinks petrol at a phenomenal rate and you need to stop once every couple of laps. The computer controlled cars also use pit stops and the sadder cars just plain break down. It takes a little while to fill the cavernous fuel tank so you will lose both time and position by stopping... BY CORE ESIGN .99 It's the world's fastest road-going production car. It costs over 400,000 pounds. The waiting list for delivery is more than five years long. It's the Jaguar XJ220 and you'll probably never get the chance to see a real one! Jaguar decided a few years back that their image was getting a little long in the tooth. They decided to build a vehicle that would make people sit up and take notice. That vehicle became the XJ220, the only car in the world that makes the Ferrari F40 look sad. Jaguar XJ 220 gives you the chance to race against other less exotic cars in the trip of a lifetime. Rev it up and take it out, and make sure you're wearing reinforced Y-fronts as well! IT'S JUST NOT FAIR! It's not fair you know. The Jaguar has to race the likes of F40s, Porsche 959s and Corvettes. These are all basically souped-up conventional cars. The Jag on the other hand is a souped-up Group C racing car, very similar to Jaguar's own XJR-11. The poor old competitors can barely reach 200mph and so you have an enormous speed advantage over the rest of the field. You also have them licked on acceleration and apart from the 959, cornering as well. Still, this is a game of wit and skill and raw power means nothing if you can't drive! BUILD THOSE TRACKS! One of the neatest features of Jaguar is the track designer. This is an incredibly easy to use menu screen which allows you to alter any of the existing tracks, or build new ones from scratch. You can place sections of track wherever you like and bend the sechans individually. You can also adjust the height of the Sack making hills and dips wherever you like. If that wasn't enough, you can even place tunnels anywhere you like, so you could do the whole race underground! lap 8 16th GEN \"We were dead excited when we previewed an early version of this last month and we're even more excited now that we've got the finished game! Jauar is, in a word, awesome. The problem with any new racing game is that it will almost certainly be compared with the brilliant Lotus Turbo Challenge. As games they're very similar although Lotus gets the edge in playability but as a package, Jaguar beats Lotus hands down. The graphics are similar, but a little better and the addition of different cars makes all the difference. The music is absolutely excellent, with fab tunes and great FX. Playability is unbeatable for a driving game, the options are incredible and the track designer gives this more lastability than any other game of its kind.

"HE REVIEW MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BY SEGA .00 UNDERWATER ACROBATICS The underwater levels on Toki are particularly challenging, if not nigh-on impossible! You don some rather smart scuba gear and head off into the murky depths of a mysterious ocean. Strangely enough, this ocean is filled with fish. Sadly for you though, they're all Pirahna and intent on chewing off your nether regions. These are easily avoided but you'll probably shoot them anyway. The physics on this level are a bit gloopy and slow, but once you get used to it the underwater levels are probably the most fun. Watch out for the killer submarines though! GOING APE SPIT TOKI LOOKS BEFORE HE LEAPS, BUT IT WON'T HELP! W hat's big and hairy and no use to anybody? Toki, that's what. This sad, shuffling monkey of a man has been transformed by an evil wizard who, to add insult to injury, has kidnapped his girlfriend! Ugly though he is, Toki has developed some very impressive super powers and can destroy monsters by gobbing at them. His phlegm has become charged with plasma radiation and he can melt them with a well placed greener! The upshot of all this magic-related malarkey is a scrolling platform romp accross umpteen dangerfilled levels. Along the way you'll encounter prehistoric monsters, Aztec statues and a fair old sprinkling of flying jellyfish. It's worth it though, because your girlfriend is a treat of dream-like proportions! \"Eeeep! I have to say it's completely different to the arcade version! That's not to say it's any worse, just different. The graphics are fairly faithful toy the coin-op and that means that they're colourful with well drawn and animated sprites. The sound is the really disappointing thing about Toki the tunes are jolly enough but don't really suit the game too well and only the hilarious sampled screams stand out. The options menu gives you a wealth of features and you can customise the game to suit even the saddest gamesplayer. Gameplay though, is what counts and Toki certainly isn't short of it. The excellent platform action and frantic blasting is nicely broken up by the strange swimming levels and the whole thing hangs together extremely well. Certainly one of the better platform games available on the Megadrive\". ARCADE ODDITY Toki in the arcades looked almost exactly the same as this Megadrive conversion, but all the levels are completely different. The Megadrive game is actually a bit larger, with the remixed levels longer. Because the levels are larger both in width and depth, the control method has been subtly altered. If you come to the edge of a precipice and have no idea what's beneath you, push up or down on the p[ad and Toki will look in that direction. There's no real explanation for the differences between this verTHANKS... sion and the others, but they all to Console Concepts seem to be slight improvements. (0782 712759) for the review cartridge.

"NPHATON REVIEW BELEDERE SUPER NINTENDO OOH! WHAT DO I DO? KICK SOME ASS BOY! BEAT 'EM UP BY JALECO .00 THICK AS THIEVES Fact is, this is a straight rip-off of Final Fight. Why would anyone want to try and copy Final Fight on the SNES when it was so nearly perfect first time round? Well, for a start, there was no two player mode on the SNES version and it was a bit easy. Rushing Beat solves both these problems in one fell swoop. You can control one of two fighters, playing simultaneously with a friend, or taking on hordes of crims on your own. Also included is a versus mode where you and a pal can slug it out between you, Streetfighter style. The controls are simple punch, kick, jump and special move. Try the various combinations of these and bring peace and justice back to the city streets. Hooray!. how! Kerblamm! Sock! Thump! These are just a few of the noises you make when you're smacking baddies in Jaleco's Rushing Beat. I don't know, it seems like some bad guy is always trying to take over the city just when you're about to relax. There you were, sipping cocktails in the Jacuzzi with your main squeeze, when the call comes through. It's your pal Mungo. \"Listen up Cuthbert,\" he says, \"There's some trouble on the streets and I don't half fancy a right good punch up.\" \"Oh no!\" you reply. «The telly's brilliant tonight and I've just boiled the kettle.\" Mungo thinks for a moment and says, «I'll let you wear my smart hat.\" That settles it, you arrange to meet in the seediest end of the city, knuckle dusters at the ready... RELSETING ILL GET MY DAD ON YOU... HnRushing Beat has arrived at a bad time because Final Fight Guy has just appeared and rectified most of the faults of the original game! Rushing Beat copies Final Fight blatantly and there are very few differences except Rushing Beat's sad attention to detail and the fairly poor graphics. The animation ranges from reasonable to appalling and the general graphic quality is poor. There's no sprite slowdown though, and this proves that programmers are finally getting to grips with the complicated SNES hardware. Even hardened gamesters need bells and whistles to keep them interested and this title just doesn't have them. If you get desperate, you can always try Final Fight, Ranma or even hang on until the arrival of Streetfighter 2!\" PALS? WHO NEEDS 'EM? If you get bored of running around smacking bad guys in the face, you can always select the Versus option which allows you to fight a head to head battle between the two main characters as they slug it out at the gates of hell! Seriously, they stand at the edge of a fiery abyss knocking lumps out of each other. You have a limited selection of moves, but it all seems a little more satisfying as you pick up your pal and slam his head on the concrete! Speed is of the essence and you'll find the little guy has the advantage. 6 STS BIDE THANKS.. cvG 076 FRANK O'CONNOR to Console Concepts (0782 712759 ) for the review cartridge. "


"B NORTON REVIEW CONTADE 3 JUMPING JABOOLAS! \"Beat 'em ups on the Super NES are a bit like waiting for a bus you know there'll be another along soon. So it's important you choose the right one to go for, and Rushing Beat is definitely the smelly old double decker with a drunk throwing up at the back. This is Final Fight's poor little cousin and no mistake. Graphically it's a bit of a mixed bag some of the sprites look alright but as soon as they move spasmodically across the screen it all becomes a bit of a joke really. Sad tunes are saved by fairly decent sound effects and on gameplay this title doesn't do too well either. Final Fight kept you at it because kicking ass was a laugh, the same isn't so true of this game and you'll find yourself sat there thinking \"Sad Rip Off\" as you go through the motions without that much interest in how well you do. Well, that's my view anyway. It has to be said that there is a hard core of CVG boyos who will religiously finish any beat 'em up that comes our way and they were thumping away on this one, so maybe I'm just biased because I'm one of the lucky people who's seen Streetfighter 2 on the SNES and can't wait to get it home!\" TIM BOONE Estere The Natal HAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT! STRATEGY SKILL SPECIAL MOVE MAYHEM Each of the fighters has his own fighting style, with distinctive moves and impressive techniques. What they all have in common however, is the ability to throw baddies. All you do is get close enough to touch a punk without actually pressing fire. You should then grab him and from this position you can kick his head in or throw him around. If you're clever, you can pick up a baddie and throw him at any other goons on screen, killing them almost instantly. You have to be really careful when you get in close enough to throw, because one false move could spell disaster. ACTION REFLEXES A SHORT HISTORY OF KICKING PEOPLE IN Video game violence has been with us since the dawn of arcade games, but one on one punch ups are fairly recent. It all started about 1983 with a game called Karate Champ. This was fairly revolutionary and has since been copied by famous names such as International Karate and Way of the Exploding Fist. Next up was Irem's fabulous Kung Fu Master which introduced lots of baddies and horizontal scrolling to the theme. Konami had moderate success with a game called Yie Ar Kung Fu. Streetfighter made a big impression when it was released in 87 and Final Fight took the Kung Fu Master theme and beefed it up. Still the best of the bunch though, was the revolutionary Streetfighter 2, with some of the best animation and music of any game ever which made this game the most successful coin-op since Gauntlet.

"DACTION! OUTRAGEOUS! The long-awaited follow-up to the Most Violent Arcade Game Ever is all set to touch down in your local coin-op shop and our very own Mr Arcades, Jaz Rignall, is there to bring you the FIRST full report on this mega sequel. How does he do it, eh? Thermal undies? Marmite soldiers? A jet engine attached to his bum? Your guess is as good as ours, so take it away that lad! From the makers of Smash TV comes the latest in coin-op ultraviolence Total Carnage! And it's difficult to think of a more apt name. Maybe Super Death 'n' Violence Central would be marginally more suitable, but really Total Carnage just about sums it all up! The game is really a cross between Smash TV and the age-old game up-the-screen shoot 'em up Ikari Warriors, and uses the same one joystick to movelone joystick to direct fire controls as Smash TV. Again either one or two players can enter to blast all and sundry to kingdomcome! The object is fairly straightforward enter a battlezone and destroy everything that moves and anything that doesn't move too! PD MIDWAY WE ARE IN DANGER WE HAVE UNCOVERED A SINISTER PLOT BY GENERAL AKHBOOB MIDWAY SOMO 2 GVG1 "


"AVG AN EXCUSE FOR CARNAGE \"What's the reason for all this violence\", some of you more conscientious readers may be thinking. Well, it's all down to General Akhboob, ruler of Kookistan. This evil tyrant is creating mutant life forms at his bio-nuclear research facilities, and with these he plans to conquer neighbouring counties and eventually the world. Now this isn't on, and the Government have decided to send in the Doomsday squad Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem to sort him out. And that's you, that is! ICON PICK ME UP Not only is there an entire army to destroy, the heroes have also got to rescue hostages from the clutches of the evil General, plus pick up bonus points in the form of flags! Ah well, it's all in a day's work for your average member of the Doomsday Squad. \"If you thought Smash TV had a high kill rate just wait until you see this sucker! It's death central, with busloads of baddies and mounds of muties to roast into oblivion with a variety of high-powered weapons. It's an extremely tough game due to the sheer volume of the enemy, but it's unbelievably addictive because it's so much fun. Torching tanks and marmalizing the monsters is really gratifying and later on you get completely engrossed in the action there's so much going on you can't stop concentrating for a second or you're killed instantly. The graphics and sound are both superb, but it's the glorious gameplay that makes this one of the best shoot 'em ups I've ever played! If you see a machine, grab all the change you can and pile it in you won't regret it!\" OS JULIAN RIGNALL TOTAL CARNAGE ARCADE by MIDWAY 30P PER PLAY STRATEGY SKILL 8730 PASSWORD SPECIAL! A rather neat feature is the fact that once you've completed the game, you get a special password which allows you to warp direct to General Akhboob whenever you play and engage him in a final confrontation. This is ideal for posing in the arcades, since experts can then finish the game at the drop of a hat (and a few tonnes of nuclear arsenal). ACTION REFLEXES THREE BIG BATTLEFIELDS The action is waged over three large battlefields, each packed with General Akhboob's vile creations and plenty of vehicles and soldiers from his regular army. As you might guess the going is pretty tough, so it's fortunate that the pair heroic players are armed to the teeth. They've got regular chain machine guns plus there are a variety of other pick-up weapons, including missiles, nukes, smarts and stuns. GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % % % OVERALL 95 1CVG "

Probably the cutest twosome ever to romp about on your home computer are all set to do all sorts of cutesie-pie goodness on an NES near you soon!

NES cutie pies will soon be able to join the fun and frolics, and we've been treated to a sneak preview of the game. Quite a few of the screens are in place and the game is looking fine, with playability tuned up just a tad to make the game a little tougher.

"PUG HOTSHOTS DRAGONS LAIR O ELITE  SUPER NINTENDO ow here's a bit of a treat for thrill 'n' spill fans everywhere! Remember the Dragon's Lair laser disc arcade games that browned your trousers a few years ago? Well, Elite have gone and grabbed the license for Super Nintendo and are working away on the game as we speak! As you can see from these screenshots, the game is a scrolling platform romp which casts you as Dirk the Daring a pretty dumb hero whose too stupid to know a bit of danger when he sees it! These shots are from early pre-production versions of the game and there's quite a way to go yet, including the end-level baddies, for example, which we're promised are going to be pantscackingly brill! Dragon's Lair went down a storm in the arcades and if Elite can capture the spirit of the game on the Super Nintendo then this is bound to be one worth watching for! Keep those peepes glued to this very spot for more news! AYRTON SENNAS SUPER MONACO CRANDPRIX2 ACIONAL SEGA C MEGADRIVEO t's back! The Megadrive's greatest racer finally has a sequel and it's backed up by the world's greatest F1 driver, Ayrton Senna! The game looks suspiciously similar to its previous incarnation, but SMGP fans and people who haven't seen this will be dead excited. You get the chance to drive around some of the world's most famous race tracks, pitting your wits and skill against some incredible driving talent. The wealth of options will astound and amaze you, as will the slightly faster and smoother graphics. This is a one-off special for the Megadrive, so it won't be appearing in your local arcade, or at least not in the foreseeable future. You get the chance to control the famous Senna and choose a car with a range of gear setups. The sneak preview we had made us drool and slobber quite uncontrollably and you'll get to dribble too, just as soon as we review the finished version! O GREMLINO O AMIGA O STO Platform fans will be agape when Gremlin bring their nippy little ant to 16-bit screens in the near future. Sonic-like funs and japes are afoot, but as well as the usual speedy action, Zool can cling to walls, monkey climb and slide on slopes as well as use various powers like his high jump and smart bomb! We first caught sight of Zool quite a while ago now, and our jaws were left truly agape by the sheer speed of the game. For our money, this is just what platform fans have been waiting for. Keep those fingers superglued to these very pages \"cos we'll be reviewing the game as soon as we get our mitts on a copy! PEL ENTORE 108kg GVG 088 "

It's the only thing that scares Bugs Bunny and the only thing that gives Yosemite Sam the willies. It's the Tasmanian Devil (Psychosis Varmintus) and it's the most bizarre thing to come from down under since Kylie Minogue! This whirling ball of fangs and fur does only two things. It eats and it destroys and Sega's latest cart gives you the chance to do something no-one's ever done before...control it! The game itself is a huge platform romp featuring Taz himself and a host of other cartoon baddies. The Tasmanian Devil is a real critter, a sort of gopher with attitude, but the cartoon version has more in common with a typhoon than an animal. At the peak of his eating frenzy, Taz turns into a spinning disaster area, destroying everything in its path. A press of the joypad Uh-oh.. button on the Sega cart does the same thing. The graphics are cartoon quality from start to finish and feature some of the best animation you'll ever see on the Megadrive. There are tons of levels and squillions of baddies. The obligatory secret bonuses are there and this could be really big news! Look out for a full review in next month's CVG! CVG 092 oo "
