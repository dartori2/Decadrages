"computer video games NEWS O SEGA'S NEW CONSOLE: L THE 128-BIT DREAMCAST! Sega have released pictures of the Dreamcast case and controller, but the main colour scheme could be altered. n May 21, Sega announced the world's first 128-bit console at a massive preview presentation in central Tokyo. Dreamcast The machine, imaginatively titled Dreamcast, offers performance levels never seen before in a home console. In short, it's awesome. Sega Enterprises president Shoichiro Irimajiri revealed what he declared would become the \"de facto standard for interactive entertainment\", demonstrating the raw power of the machine with two technology demos that blew the assembled audience away. Truly Model 3 power plus is now accessible to the home market. But power alone is not enough, and Mr Irimajiri announced an imaginative new perspective on the video games market which is great news for the casual gamer and perhaps even better news for the hardcore arcade junkie. Sega even went as far as to announce a release date for the machine: November 20 in Japan. US and European launches were confirmed for Autumn 1999. No rumour, no speculation: that's confirmed. Sega's Shoichiri Irimajiri, President of Sega said that the emphasis of their campaign would be to capture the light and casual users as well as the hardcore gamers who bought the Saturn. THE WAY FORWARD Dreamcast.. FIRST SHOTS AND DETAILS OF NEW SEGA MACHINE ega's aim with Dreamcast is not to create a wide, diverse range of The biggest news perhaps is the Europe alone!

Dreamcasts throughout its lifespan in mistake. demo INTRODUCING IRI-SAN! one NEWS elping out Mr Irimajiri at the New Challenge Conference was Iri-San, a fully rendered version of the Sega President's head running on Dreamcast hardware. Similar in style to the opening screen of Super Mario 64, this demo was astounding. The detail levels on Iri-san were astounding, the animation flawless. It seemed that every grey hair and wrinkle of the president was evident on the Dreamcast rendition as you zoomed in on his face there was no pop-up, glitching, fog, blurring and the effect was excellent. Add special effects like fire-breathing, a city invasion (where Iri-san dropped in on a couple of skyscrapers, accompanied by helicopters with searchlights) and you have one fine demonstration. But this was nothing compared to the majesty of the Tower of Babel demo! Fion Although simple in concept, the Iri-san demo shows off a vast amount of the graphics effects that the Dreamcast is producing. The searchlights and projected logo (above) are the highpoint of this particular demo. The levels of light sourcing (left) are far beyond anything seen on any home machine yet! "


"computer video games TOWER OF BABEL two Looks good eh? You ought to see this demo in action as you swoop down through the streets, checking out the detail on every single one of those little buildings! This demo took five people just one week to produce at Sega R&D. his demo was designed to show that in terms of polygon-pushing power, Dreamcast can match and out-perform Model 3. So says Hideki Sato, managing director of consumer R&D at Sega of Japan. This demo features a tower built on a mountain set in a desert landscape. Surrounding the tower are hundreds of buildings an entire town built on the slope leading up to the summit. Mr Sato confirmed that 1 million polygons are used for the entire scene, which features phenomenal sunset lighting effects (which you can control). Best of all are the camera angles: as you zoom into the sky, looking down on the town, you can see every building, with no pop-up or glitching and then you're swooping down through individual streets, checking out the detail on each building! Both demos ran at a high resolution and at 60 frames per second. The Tower of Babel was astounding and it came as no surprise to learn that Yu Suzuki, creator of Virtua Fighter, was producer for this demo. However, the most amazing thing was that this demo was running on an incomplete Dreamcast. Mr Sato told us that the finished graphics chip has 30 per cent more processing power. Truly, the mind boggles! Is the Dreamcast hardware as good as Model 3? The word from Sega R&D is 'yes'. The arcade board renders 1 million square polygons per second. Dreamcast pumps out 3 million triangles a second, making it more than a match. We'll see for sure when we check out Virtua Fighter 3. [D2: DREAMCAST'S FIRST GAME! Two days after Sega's New Challenge albeit with a far stronger story angle. Mr Eno Conference, Kenji Eno of Warp held his own stressed that the game was very early, but for show to debut D2the only game yet seen those of us prepared for Model 3 arcade running on Dreamcast software. The Warp levels of animation and detail we couldn't help show was an incredible spectacle and but feel disappointed. testament to Mr Eno's popularity in Japan. Compared to Sega's However, little was seen of D2, bar the own demos, D2 didn't intriguing rendered intro scene and the first seem in the same level of the game. From what was seen, D2 league. We shall looked very similar in style to Tomb Raider 2, have to see. FIRST SHOTS AND DETAILS OF NEW SEGA MACHINE This high-resolution domain is very smooth indeed running at 60 frames per second! Notice Laura's legs in the snow. At the D2 show Warp boss Kenji Eno revealed that his firm are putting huge amounts of effort into the characters' facial animation. The sun is setting in this picture, explaining the lack of light in the surroundings. Main character Laura's about to get very cold. The main intro to D2 gives us some indication of the quality of full-motion video we can expect to see from the Dreamcast. "


"computer games THE LOWDOWN ON THE CONTROLLER The Dreamcast pad is very impressive indeed. Two slots on the back allow you to plug in multiple accessories (such as the Visual Memory System below) and RumblePak style vibrational units. And to cap it all off, it doesn't half look good too! reamcast's controller is light and easy to use, with analogue and digital controls and six buttons in total (four main, two shoulder). Die-hard Sega fans may be disappointed at the lack of buttons compared to the legendary NIGHTS pad on Saturn (and it's bound to cause Sony style control problems on Capcom fighting games), but Sega's research discovered that the mass market found the NIGHTS pad to be too confusing. The controller has two ports: the top one is clearly for the Visual Memory System (VMS) system, which integrates perfectly. The second is used for other attachments (maybe a RumblePak style add-on) or can be used to copy data between two VMS units. INTRODUCING VISUAL MEMORY SYSTEM! Phe VMS (Visual Memory System) is Sega's innovative memory card, which plugs straight into the Dreamcast pad. It has an LCD screen, visible via a hole on the pad itself, which allows you access to private information in multi-player games. However, like Sony's new PDA, it's a machine in its own right, allowing you to store data, communicate with other VMS users by plugging them together and it can even be used on mobile phones for more data transfer action! Perhaps most interestingly, VMS is designed to plug into forthcoming coin-ops allowing you to switch info between arcade titles and their Dreamcast equivalents at home! The BIG news though is that VMS launches before Dreamcast it's going to available in Japan in the summer. THE SPECS Dreamcast.

[ NEW AM2 FIGHTING GAME! ] WANT TO KNOW MORE? Sega's star arcade development team AM2 is said to be putting the finishing touches to their next big arcade fighting game, currently called Spike. It features a big selection of characters designed by the Virtua Fighter 3 team, plus intricate backgrounds designed by the Scud Race team. Gameplay is said to be similar to Squaresoft's Ehrgeiz, with full 3D movement and the ability to go anywhere in the arenas. But by far the most exciting thing about the game is the 16-player mode! 16 Model 3 arcade cabinets will be linked by new optic fibre technology to allow more players than ever before. And if you haven't got 15 friends, any spare machines will play by themselves to make up the numbers! No mention of a Dreamcast version of Spike has been made yet, but with the console's impressive internet capabilities, a 16-player worldwide version should be possible. We'll have much more on Spike as soon as AM2 let us have a good go on it! There's tons more Dreamcast information that unfortunately we just don't have space to print.

WIN A CONSOLE COMET CAMA WIN A CONSOLE AND FIVE GAMES Dear CVG, Now don't get me wrong. Games are great. But sometimes I worry that kids today are missing out on so much more. When I was growing up in the early 90s, probably before most of your readers were born, there was no such thing as video games. Well, OK that's a lie. But they were severely rationed. The nly chance I ever got to play such classics as Harvey Spencer's Fun-o Rama was when Harry the Spiv would bring a copy round hidden in chopped Spam. Three minutes a week was all we would get. And we were glad of it. These days, what with free consoles for all, a 26-hour day and no school, and everlasting gobstoppers, kids get to play games all day. Without having to eat their way through four pounds of chopped Spam first. And I, for one, don't think it's right. You can say that I'm just jealous. That I'm just being petty. That I don't want today's younger generation having the fun of which I was so cruelly deprived. And in some ways, you'd be right. In all ways you'd be right, in fact. Anyway, my point is this. There's more to life than than just doing what you want. There's doing what you hate, as well. So go on, clear off. Ben Prastitis, Croydon CVG: In retrospect Sega's mistake with the Saturn seems to have been that the machine was launched at a very high price with hardly any marketing. Sega was expecting the mass es of punters who had paid  for a Mega Drive to shell out  for a Saturn, and of course it didn't happen. Sony demonstrated the marketing expertise they had learned establishing brands like Walkman and Discman and released PlayStation at a much lower price and, more importantly, put LOADS of resources into advertising, sponsorship and other deals that introduced PlayStation to the general public. There's no real formula to it you just have to work out who you're selfing to and adjust your sales pitch accordingly. Sega ended up with the hardcore gaming minority and Sony got everybody else. BARRY NORMAN WANNABE CVG: You're not bitter by any chance are you? It's your parents' fault for bringing you into a world where there weren't many games. DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME? SET UP TO BE KNOCKED DOWN Dear CVG, Has anyone stopped to consider that Sony's remarkable climb to the top of the games industry may have been a fluke, and that next time round they may not be so lucky. As Sega know all too well, what worked with one console will not neces. sarily work for the next. When Sony decided to mar Dear CVG, Tomb Raider the film...? NO! Please don't let them do it. After the shockingly insulting live adaptation of Streetfighter, Tomb Raider can only be utter crud. If it is made, I forsee some stupid, usually American, director changing everything to the point that Lara becomes Laura or even Anna Jones to appeal to the American market in an oh-so-funny take on Indiana Jones. You can look forward to the following when the film is released: 1. Action sequences WILL be badly filmed with BIG men falling over at the slightest jab of a fingernail. 2. Incredibly crude toys of the film will be made, and will feature ludicrously outsized body parts and rocket launchers. 3. You'll realise the money you spent on cinema tickets would be better spent buying thumbscrews. 4. Leonardo DiCaprio will be the token love interest (yawn). 5. The Spice Girls will be at the premiere spouting Girl Power stuff and they would most probably do the theme tune. 6. Lara/Laura will be a blonde, top heavy fool who needs a gawky man to stop her stubbing her toe at various points and will probably accompany her throughout the film as the token goofy guy. Matt, Luton, Beds. Dear CVG, Remember the days of the Speccy and C64 when developers weren't afraid to develop new styles of game? Well why is it now, with all this technology, we get craploads of blatant rip-offs? Can't these monkeys come up with something original that's also good? I reckon us gamers should all be able to con tribute our ideas towards proposed games for the next breed of super consoles. It's only fair seeing as we pay for them. Lee Thomas Robson, Newcastle ETTERS CVG: A pretty good idea in theory, but every person who contributed an idea to a success ful game would be wanting a royalty of some sort. It'd turn into even more of a money grab bing exercise than it is at the moment. was perfect for those people who had owned the Nintendo consoles when they were younger and wanted something more grown up. Nintendo learned that what interests games players now won't interest them several years later. Like Shigeru Miyamoto said at Space World: \"A few years ago, players were excited by the Super Mario Bros games but, as they got older, these people stopped playing.\" This is why when Sony finally release a new machine, they shouldn't just re-use the same formula that made the PlayStation suc cessful. Instead they should just rethink their strategy, and perhaps even aim the new console at the \"even older\" games player. The last thing they want to do is repeat the mistakes Sega made, for if they do, it will leave Nintendo laughing all the way to the bank. Sam Edelman, Hampshire I HATE THIS SEGA CRAP CVG: The latest woman to be rumored for the lead role is Anna Nicole Smith. What exactly do her and Lara have in common then...? Dear CVG, I am writing to you to complain about all this Sega crap. When they were launching the Saturn back in 12 "


"computer video games OUT OF THE FRYING PAN * SOMET STAR IETER IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED Dear CVG I change girlfriends like I change my socks, but PlayStation owners who W*** over Lara are complete losers. Shaid Majid, Bradford. CVG: Check out Dr Lovegod! Dear CVG, In your April issue you mentioned a memory card sized 32-bit machine with a monochrome screen by SONY... obviously an April Fools trick, but you didn't mention it when you were revealing the other April Fools jokes. It WAS an April Fools joke, wasn't it? John Merrick, Preston Dear CVG, I'm writing in reply to Stephen Atherton and his 'Grab a Granny' letter in issue 198. I bought a copy of WCW vs the World on the PlayStation thinking it might be decent as I loved Touken Retsuden 2. To my horror (after the delightful FMV intro)' I discovered it was an inferior game in everyway. Being the man that I am, I thought, \"Fair enough, I'll go to the store and hopefully the assistant will have a sympathetic ear and understand my dilemma.\" The bloke at the counter was exactly how I'd wished for, and I thought I was going to get my money back and I could buy something else. But then fate dealt the trump card and happiness turned into anxiety. \"Looks fine, I'll just get the manager, shouldn't be a problem.\" Yeah right! He spun me a lie about the PlayStation laser scratching the disc and thus making the game un-sellable. I was well p***ed off! I gave the disc a quick wipe to make it look spick-and-span and gave it to my sis ter. I figured they'd never turn a girl down. Three months on and the game is still collecting dust on my shelf. So, a message to Stephen. I went for the bull by the homs and lost. Kiss my arse you ruthless b****rd! Simon Mealing, Manchester CVG: Check out Dr Pleb! Dear CVG, My friend claims that there is a Manga version of Resident Evil series ready to hit the shops. Is this true? Brian Foy, Motherwell CVG: There is certainly an American comic series by Wildstorm Comic, which has a very cool online version too. Their address is http://www.wildstorm.com. But as far as an actual Manga series, we don't think there is one. CVG: There you have it. Conclusive proof that certain games shop owners are oblivious to the powers of Woman. A bloke with a VooDoo 2 card on the other hand is a completely different matter... AND FIVE GAMES WIN A CONSOLE Dear CVG, I love your mag the others that are about PlayStation are sold at the most ridiculous prices. I would be most obliged if you'd print this for me I have 10 more places in my under-12 PlayStation club. If anyone that reads this mag in Yorkshire would like to join please contact me through CVG, who have my number. Rhys Howarth, Yorkshire CVG: What are you all waiting for? 1994 they said they would still be backing the Megadrive 100%, but whenever I read your magazine I never see any new Megadrive releases (Except FIFA '98). They are soon launching the katana, their amazing 128-bit next generation console and I am wondering if they will be making this promise again regarding the Saturn? now own an N64 but would like to buy another Saturn and then hopefully the katana but after the failure of the Game Gear, Mega CD, 32X and now the Saturn, I don't know if I could trust Sega enough to commit money to the katana. Will the same thing happen to this? I hope not, as I liked the Saturn so much, I was gutted when I swapped it for my equally cool N64 soon after buying Resident Evil and the awesome Quake. Mike Martin, Merseyside MET I can't see the problem if the greatly protected British public is being sold this sort of thing. I can understand that some things are better left from young, impressionable eyes despite what I saw and did when I was at a more tender age (although apart from the lights and music in my head telling me to butcher people, I am fine... no, really!). However, there is a large number of games players out there who are old enough to choose what they would like to be entertained by in their own homes. Look at the sales of games such as Grand Theft Auto, Resident Evil 2 etc. if you want proof that there is a huge market for these violent, yet fanta sy (that's right, it is not real, Mary Whitehouse) games. If the government are anxious about games such as GTA and RE2 then surely they must be more stringent on laws protecting sales to the younger generation, rather than stopping adults who are completely within their rights to own and enjoy this sort of thing. To be quite honest, I would think having a parent like Ms Whitehouse would create a disturbed mind much more than playing RE2 for 100 hours without a break! Anyway, I have definitely waffled for long enough now. Antony Andreou, Manchester Computer Games! The University of Abertray in Dundee has launched a load of courses for \"Computer Games technology and Virtual Environments\"! (You can check the progress of these degrees on the World Wide Web, URL at http://www.tay.ac.uk.) Imagine, when you leave school you can get a BSc in computer games! Perhaps this will mean a decrease in games that would be more at home in a trash can, because I have a dream, and that dream is for someone to make a game that everyone will like. This will be the start of that path, so, one message for all of you who drink coffee, eat Mars bars and play video games. GET TO SCOTLAND! Phil Mann, Peterborough CVG: Considering that the specs have only just been released for Katana, it would be impossible to predict their marketing plans. However, in following on from the previous letter, you would guess that Sega will have learnt their lesson and decided to 'splash the cash' as it were. CVG: Now if your parents are moaning, saying you spend too much time playing those bloody computer games, sign up for this course and tell her you're off to university. She can't have complaints, at least until you tell her what you're going to study. ISPIT ON YOUR GRAVE FOLLOW THE N64 ROAD CVG: It's all very well listing these third rate horror flicks, but you should check out the classics such as Blood Feast, Necromantic and Hideous Mutant Freaks. You'll find them next to Mary Poppins and the Care Bears The Movie at your local video emporium. Dear CVG, I have been playing video games for a long time now and have read literally thousands of letters about them in hundreds of different magazines including your own. However, this is the first time felt I must write a letter to a magazine such as yourself. The reason why? That word that should be banned (ha, ha, geddit?) for being too crapcensorship. I first saw the film, the Exorcist when I was aged eight. That was one of my personal favourites amongst other delectable atrocities such as The Hills Have Eyes, Cannibal Holocaust and I Spit on Your Grave. I have also played many violent games in my time (Doom, Quake, Resident Evil etc.) and it has filled me with lust, longing and madness for more of the same actually. Dear CVG. I own an N64. The thing I have noticed is that not many crap games have come out after the first year. Even though there hasn't been been many games, they are all high quality with the exception of War Gods. But the PlayStation had quite a few crap games when it first came out as did the Saturn. I know the PlayStation has good games now but I think the N64 is still showing the way. Dale Harrison, Stirling LETTERS SCOTLAND ROCKS! Dear CVG, I am writing to express the joy I experienced when I found out that you can actually get a degree in CVG: Can we draw your attention to Cruis'n USA, Mortal Kombat Mythologies and Dark Rift possibly?

This game's so intense it'll make your eyes explode! tank 20:25 his is VIOLENT! Body Harvest is from the same guys who did Grand Theft Auto, so what do you expect fluffy bunnies? That's right, Nintendo 64 is now right at home with guns and gore. The basic premise is shooting aliens, in a scenario which could have been lifted directly from Starship Troopers. Only DMA swear blind it wasn't. These aliens have invaded Earth, though they don't expect to stay forever just long enough to have a light snack and round up some meat for their freezers. Human meat. Let the bugs know they're not welcome. And, have fun. Nintendo 64's most intense game to date. Full-on shoot-'em-up action, combined with the best problem-solving RPGs have to offer. VIOLENCE AND GORE ON N64 VIOLEN INAWORLD OF CHAOS AND TERROR! 09:25 STORY as COVER STORY The action in Body Harvest takes place in a fully 3D world swarming with alien scum, and it is vast. You have a high level of control over the game's hero, Adam Drake, enabling you to run around as you please, picking off targets as you go. Your major concern are the aliens, who are rounding up humans for fun! These invaders are on guard at all times, and will just as soon as eat you up as anyone else. Just like you, the aliens get to roam around as they wish and they usually wish to do this where there are human bodies to harvest. So the general routine is to wait for wave after wave of aliens to teleport from the mother ship, then track them down before your brothers and sisters are added to today's menu! 14 Laser fire looks really cool, burning up the place!

Harvesters crap glutonous green bio-blobs which trap humans! Every alien, apart from the Queen, is generated by the Processor. Secure the zone by terminating the Processor. The Queen is the biggest and most unspeakably ugly representative of the alien horde. Annihilate her to end the invasion. Allowing for the growth The aliens dispatch a more powerful class of army according to the time zone they're invading. So, even though you have incredible weaponry to hand in the year 2029, bear in mind that the aliens are even bigger, uglier, and downright more dangerous to make sure they give you grief! The tougher the aliens get, the more shots they require to the head, and the longer Adam is stood there battling. Which needs skill! 35:25 9525 1 Aliens, circa 1916. You can handle it.

This means that he can run anywhere he pleases, only not so fast or so far up hills since the weight of his suit is restrictive. The weight problems prevent Adam from swimming too he can go for a while, but will soon sink. Still, this is no problem. Since Adam's main purpose is to take heat from alien lasers, the suit serves him fine. He can fall any distance too without breaking so much as a finger. 09:25  C015 tano) 1 Adam's doing a lot of running in these shots. He's out of ammo, see. & Run for your life Adam! No, wait! Save the innocent citizen first! "


"computer video games INATIME WHEN TIME HAS NO MEANING! It's common knowledge that aliens have been planning an invasion for centuries. Well in the end it seems they decide to invade several cen turies all at once. This makes the game even more interesting, since Adam Drake is required to stop the invasion in different time zones as well as in different parts of the world. Time zones make the game look more varied, but they also affect the gameplay in that the technology used against the enemy changes Sometimes not fast enough, mind you. NINTENDO 64 Don Drake gets to ride around in all kinds of vehicles during the game. In 1916, however, he's limited to bi-planes and classic' cars. A Model T versus the scum of the universe ?! + Tanks and armoured helicopters. Now this is a much better situation to be in. Still doesn't seem to be having much luck here though. Call in the army! What, they're all dead? Citizens in big trouble! Rain affects play... Scouts search for food! Sightseeing on the job. Haha! No chance mate! VIOLENCE AND GORE ON N64 BATTLE FOR THE EARTH! When it's time to meet the queen, not only do you need to be on your best behaviour, you need to have your wits about you. And a spare pair of pants handy. Before the confrontation, you switch from being on foot to driving the hovercraft. This turns out to be the best choice, since the queen terraforms the whole area into a flat plain. It helps her stomp around, since she is so huge, and lets your hovercraft to zip about unhindered. And she is GIANT! Get this... there's a different queen for each of the six time zones in the game. Each time she gets even bigger. Like twice-thesize-of-thescreen bigger! Battling the alien queen is like a classic confrontation with a shoot-'em-up boss. You need to blast off 'arms' and 'legs', then go for the kill! You need to learn new skills when piloting the hovercraft.

"computer video games MANADVENTURE INTO THE UNKNOWN Alongside the action-based gameplay, there is a fair amount of info-seeking to do. By talking to the local civilians you get to hear clues that enable you to solve problems nearby. This investigative aspect to the game slows the pace briefly, which is a deliberate move on the game designers' part. While you're exploring indoors, the chaos outside is frozen, so it's okay to take your time over a conversation. You can also snoop around the interiors for stray items such as ammo or medical supplies. 65129 1 Though you receive clues from 1 It could be too late for the around and about, you still need citizens in this house.

WIN:1 This is part one of a three-part series, in which CVG analyses the Tekken 3 fighters how to get the best from them in attack, and defence. The series will also include Tekken 3 player guides, starting with combos this month. Make sure you get as much as possible from these features, as we're preparing to hold our very own King Of Iron Fist Tournament 3 in September.  1995 1996 1998 NAMCO LTD., ALL RIGHTS RESERVED ELS Tekken 3 continues the tradition of life-sapping 10-Hit Combos from Tekken 2, with more style and deadly grace. However 10-hitters aren't the only sequences which deal a lot of damage and humiliation. Here's the breakdown of combo styles in Tekken 3. Easy to perform sequence of two or more hits. Jin's Flash Punch, or Yoshimitsu's Triple Round House are clear examples. Jin's Flash Punch is easy to perform, but often gets through. STRINGS Special moves require specific button sequences to happen, but they may also result as part of a String. All of the fighters have at least one String Combo, and all require precision timing. The notorious 10 Hit Combos are String Combos taken to the extreme, but can be broken down into smaller segments. Experienced players confuse opponents by stopping during a String to remain unpredictable. JUGGLES THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 Juggling is the technique of keeping opponents in the air with a combo. A Juggle always requires a Launcher a move which knocks an opponent up into the air to begin. A good example of a Launcher is Jin Kazama's Laser Scraper a powerful uppercut which comes at the end of a three hit combo. After this Jin can go for the same again, or look to other techniques to bounce them along. Juggles aren't so difficult to perform, the secret is timing. If you're too quick or too slow on the buttons, you mess it up. FLOATS These are similar to Juggle combos, but require a sharper eye and lots more practice to get right. The big difference between a simple Juggle Combo and a Float Combo is that Floats can be started after an opponent has hit the ground, even as they're trying to get up. After that the same principles that apply to Juggles work here. SA Paul Phoenix is the king of Float Combos, with his powerful Rapid Fire elbow attack. Just as you think it's all over... it ain't! 1 Here Jin finishes his hardest-hitting 10-hitter! UPERCHARGER Jin, Xiaoyu, and Yoshimitsu charge up. Law beats on Paul's head for fun! This is new to the Tekken series. By pressing LP, RP, LK, and RK all at the same time your fighter summons a brief (roughly three seconds) of extra power. Any attack scores as a counterstrike while Supercharged, which not only causes more damage to the opponent, but often acts as a Launcher for bad combos! Only downside is fighters can't block when Supercharged. NEXT MONTH: THROW COMBOS, ATTACK REVERSALS, AND REVERSAL REVERSALS! PLUS: HWOARANG, NINA WILLIAMS, KING THE 2ND, LEI WULONG, AND EDDY GORDO "

This is the son of Marshall Law (one of the original fighters in the King Of Iron Fist Tournament). Forest is prevented from taking part in any competitions outside of the dojo, as his father knows how dangerous it is. The reason Forest is entered into the King Of Iron Fist Tournament 3 is all Paul Phoenix's fault (Paul is a regular at Marshall Law's dojo). While Marshall is away, Paul suggests to Forest that he is a better fighter than his father. This is his chance to prove it. FIGHTING AS LAW Want to be Bruce Lee? Law has some powerful attacks which require simple commands to perform. He's also very fast, making him one of the strongest guys in the tournament all round. Once Law gets through with a technique, he saps energy with big punch combos and/or sequences of kicks. Opponents who make more than a couple of mistakes are goners, basically. Law has some of the greatest throw moves in the game. The one on the left sees him diving down on his opponent! RESULFFENSE ESTUFENSE Law can keep attacks out with his Thrust Blocks, which give him a quick chance to reply. He has a Fake Step, which is new, that avoids punches at close range and gives him the option for a Fake Step Blow but only if the opponent is too stupid to see this coming! Generally, though, just dodge. Favourite of all Law's combos is his Dragon Storm punches. The third punch is a Launcher, and what comes next is as nasty as you want it to be. Law's Dragon's Tail is good to throw in occasionally, keeping opponents down. His Somersaults are tough to combat, and can even intimidate expert players. THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 LESERS M OTOR 2 GE 2 01 '1938 19 START XIAOYU. 1 (Bottom-left to Top) Law side-steps Yoshimitsu's attack, setting up a throw. Jin Kazama is made to look foolish (almost impossible!) by a Fake Step. And Paul Phoenix eats a large portion of Fake Step Blow, and gets stomach ache! 1 (Bottom-left to Top) Paul wishes he had seen this Dragon's Tail coming. Hwoarang (profile next issue) gets clipped on the jaw by a Somersault. No fun whatever for Ling Xiaoyu as she is jammed with a Dragon Storm combo. OHT COMBO MUNTII You should learn all of Law's 10-Hit Combos, as they form a major part of his strategy same as with Jin Kazama. There are key points where these can be interchanged, keeping opponents guessing. COMING SOON 1 LIVING IN HIS FATHER'S SHADOW "


"computer video games PROFILE PAL PHOENIX HOT-BLOODED MARTIAL ARTIST PlayStation he eyes of an eagle, with the strength and reflexes of a tiger even now! At 46, Paul is one of the oldest (human) fighters in the tournament. He missed out on the chance to prove himself in the last King Of Iron Fist Tournament, due to a traffic jam caused by a motorway pile up. For the past 19 years Paul has been training at Marshall Law's Dojo, and winning lots of small competitions. However he recently received an invitation to the King Of Iron Fist Tournament 3. Country of Origin: USA in Syrie: Combined Martial Arts based on Judo Age: 46 Height: 187cm Weight: 81kg Blood Type: 0 Occupation: None. Still trains with the intention of being #1 Hoor: Motorbikes kes: Pizza, and the smell of petrol Dislikes: Japanese motorways (ever since the traffic jam) FIGHTING AS PAU Paul's trademark is capitalising on others' mistakes, in no uncertain terms. A good Paul player can punish opponents physically and mentally given half a chance. You might even call Paul Phoenix dirty, if it weren't for the skill required to get the best out of him. Intimidation is definitely the key, as Paul can also reverse attacks leaving opponents at a loss for tactics. One of the best there is. Most of Paul Phoenix's offensive relies on heavy punches. As you can see, he is full of fun when dealing these blows. BEST DEFENSE Master the timing of Paul's Reversals, and you'll have the psychological advantage for sure. Add to this your goal to keep opponents down, so they just can't hit back. Bone Breakers and/or Hammer Fists catch panicked opponents as they rise. It gets so your opponent dare not flinch! BEST OFFENSE Paul's Jaw Breaker into Stone Breaker (zero-range elbow into uppercut) can set up short, but damaging combos. Tag a Bone Breaker (low kick into elbow) onto the end, and you've got some very dissatisfied customers. And, there's fun to be had starting combos with Paul's Sway technique. COMING SOON THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 1 (Bottom-left to Top) Making sure Law doesn't get chance to stand back up. \"King, I swear if you ever try that again I'll break your rockin' arm, dude!\".

"PROFILE computer video games MECHANIZED SPACE NINJA 5 Playstation Cote 028None (formerly Japan) Advanced Manji Ninja Arts Fee Unknown F 178cm Ye63kg Bond Tyre: 0 Costa Leader of the Manji Clan Por Watching Sumo, Net surfing kes Video game arcades (especially those in Shinjuku, Tokyo) Dies Villains, and poor losers (at video games) octor Boskonovitch saved Yoshimitsu's life, so the story goes, but the circumstances remain unkown. Whatever, Yoshimitsu now fights to raise money for the Doctor B's research, and to aid the poor and disadvantaged. The ultimate favour Yoshimitsu can do for Doctor B is to bring him the blood of the God Of Fighting. With this Boskonovitch can complete his research, and bring back to life his daughter who died as a ginuea pig in his 'Cold Sleep' experiments. FIGHTING AS YOSHIMITSU Just as Eddy is viewed as the beginner's choice to frustrate experts, Yoshimitsu is the expert's choice to make fools of beginners or even advanced players. The Space Ninja requires skill to be effective, since he must keep the pressure on opponents to hide the fact that he has such poor defense. Be confident, however, and Yoshimitsu is the biggest crowd pleaser there is. Yoshimitsu can be very intimidating to fight against. This throw move against Hwoarang drains an opponent's energy! BEST DEFENSE Since only good players should trust Yoshimitsu, it's best to have fun with defense, Yoshimitsu can heal himself, either by meditating or stealing an opponent's energy. Also warping behind opponents is a unique, and great gag if used skilfully. Yoshimitsu Flash is his best standard counter. His poison breath is a surprise move that only complete beginners will fall for, though it is cool. BEST OFFENS. Speed is important, since you're trying to keep opponents out. Yoshimitsu's Right Punch Uppercut is easy, and useful for set t ing up combos. Otherwise rely on the Manji Spin Punches into Spin Kick to keep opponents away. Accompany most combos with Attack Reversal Reversals for security. THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 TERSE COMING SOON 1 (Bottom-left to Top) While sitting like this Yoshimitsu regains energy. Same again here but he's more vulnerable this is being cheeky! Yoshimitsu Flash will make Law wish he hadn't tried this. 1 (Bottom-left to Top) This knee strike is called Fubuki, and gets through quickly. Juggling opponents is a favourite of Yoshimitsu's. Hwoarang gets his legs whipped by Manji Kicks. 1 An early design of Yoshimitsu, post Tekken 2, pre T3. 10 HIT COMBO It's unlikely that you'll use many 10-Hit Combos with Yoshimitsu, as he is easy to counter. If you're chances are good, however, go for the ones ending with a Sword Stab. 2012 12 LENDING A HELPING HAND "


"computer video games PROFILE CBHIGH SPIRITED GIRL PlayStation espite being young and relatively small, Xiaoyu is a strong fighter. So powerful in fact that she once beat up a bunch of Heihachi's guards who found her hiding on the old man's private yacht. Her reason for being there was to meet up with Heihachi, who Xiaoyu knew to be a very wealthy man, and request some money from him to build an amusement park! Heihachi was amused no little with Xiaoyu's show of strength for such a selfish reward, and entered her for the tournament.

Likas Chinese steamed buns and shrimp dumplings. Peking Duck. Dislikes Maths teachers FIGHTING AS XIAOYU Anyone who can think as fast as Xiaoyu can perform will have no problem upsetting opponents. Xiaoyu's combos are quite easy to manage, though cause a great deal of damage and humiliation especially since many are done with her back turned. Be constantly on the move, linking one technique with another, to become expert with Xiaoyu. And be sure to take extra care when her back is turned. Xiaoyu has two Insult moves. Neither cause damage, though her wave slaps opponents away briefly.

(Kazuya was killed by his father, Heihachi, because he was cursed.) Four years have passed. Under the expert tuition of Heihachi, Jin is now ready to avenge Jun's death. Little knowing that Heihachi is using him to lure the God Of Fighting... FIGHTING AS JIN Since he is the main character in the game, Jin is the best overall. He has no moves which are too strong, or too weak. Jin is fast, and versatile. He has solid defense, which includes Reversals, and a wide range of interchangeable Strings. A good Jin player should be able to turn any fight to his advantage by remaining unpredictable, and capitalising on speed. Jin Kazama also has a school uniform. When Jin and Xiaoyu choose this secret costume, they battle outside the college. BEST OFFENSE BEST DEFENSE Jabs, high and low, keep out most opponents long enough for Jin to find an opening. He can't be thrown while jabbing high, and low jabs stop a lot of stronger attacks such as side kicks. Jin also has one of the biggest side-steps in the game, and sound Reversals. THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 Jin can go for damaging combos from an uppercut counter-strike, or Rising Uppercut. Both launch opponents to set up juggles. Rapid-fire punch combos, starting with swift jabs, is tactically sound too. Jin's Crouch Dash moves are full of surprises, he can pop-up with anything from a Dragon Uppercut to Tsunami Kicks. Namco dropped the skull from the final costume. 1 (Bottom-left to Top) Eddy gets stopped mid-cheese by a simple jab. King is reminded never to try anything funny by Jin's Attack Reversal. Jin's side-step is fast, and travels far, allowing him to reply with a swift Back Spin Kick. 1 (Bottom-left to Top) The Demon Slayer is fast and painful. Jin's Twin Pistons attack ends in an uppercut, which can start a juggle combo. Out of a Crouch Dash, and into Demon's Paw straight into Lei's Wulong's gut. OHIT COMBO Jin has four basic 10-Hit Combos, which can be adapted and/or extended to form others. This one is the easiest to perform, but the most damaging.

LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS TO DO If you thought collecting all 120 stars in Mario 64 was a lot of work, you should see the amount of stuff you have to collect in Banjo Kazooie. Before you can do this you have to get onto the levels, which is a huge task in itself. All the levels are accessed from Gruntilda's lair, and of course she's made things kind of difficult. To access levels you'll need to find jigsaw pieces. There are 10 of these hidden on each level. Once the missing pieces of jigsaw are placed in a puzzle, the level will be opened. These puzzles, although they might look like it, are not like the portals in Mario, the level is opened elsewhere in Gruntilda's lair, and now you've got to find it. Also blocking your tracks are the note doors. These can only be opened once you have collected enough musical notes, there are 100 on each level, but then you need large amounts to open these doors. Who left these here? Apart from the musical notes and more importantly the jigsaw pieces, there are lots of other objects to find on each level. One jigsaw piece on each level is obtained by finding five Jinjos. These creatures have been captured and hidden in each level by Gruntilda. You'll also need to stock up on eggs, these act as weapons for Kazooie, and are also needed in some puzzles. There are also extra lives hidden around, these take the form of golden Banjo statuettes, they're usually hidden in some very tricky to reach places. Finally there's honeycombs, these are used to refill Banjo's lost energy. If you find enough extra honeycomb pieces, Banjo's health bar can be extended.

Ever get the feeling you're being watched? That's a big snowman! A WHOLE NEW WORLD There are nine large levels to explore before you face Gruntilda for the final showdown. That may not be as many as Mario 64, but believe us, there's more to do. They all have the trademark Rare touches, with levels themed around similar ideas to those used in Diddy Kong Racing. Some of the highlights are a pirate ship, a swamp, a desert with pyramids and a snow-covered level with a giant snowman.

It doesn't happen only in the movies. ASTO TM DO NOT FEAR BLASTO IS HERE! lasto is a space adventurer with troubles that make handling alien invaders look easy. Blasto made its debut at last year's E3 show. Hailed as being the next big thing, it was quickly brushed aside and forgotten about. Come Christmas '97 and the expected release date, the game was nowhere to be seen. Blasto has clearly had problems, but now Sony are once again confident that his time has come. His ship is about to land, and pretty soon you'll be able to decide if he really is a hero, or a zero. Exciting crate-pushing action. A force field blocks the exit. MAKE ROOM FOR THE MUSHROOMS YOU CALL THIS SAVING THE WORLD? The stage is set for the game to begin. Blasto must make his way through eight worlds, kicking alien ass along the way. Each stage sees him take one step towards his final showdown with Bosc the Terrible. Enter the 3D spaceports as Blasto embarks on his greatest adventure yet er... his only adventure yet! NOOS ININO) Each level is a three-dimensional maze, with Blasto having to find switches to progress further. These switches open up locked doors or move objects. You need a good memory to figure out where to go next though. Often the door just opened will be at the other end of the level. The levels also include many planes, best described as looking like a multistory car park with gaps everywhere. You must locate lifts or platforms to travel between these planes. In the tra dition of all platform games, of course, this isn't easy. LOKEOLVASER 100 32 Oh no, he's fallen down the plughole! Phew, it's just a lift. "


"TAKE THAT, SNOTBALL! computer Video games No platform game would be complete without enemies out to thwart you. Blasto features an army of aliens armed with ray guns, who'll popout from behind every corner waiting to zap Blasto in the butt. The easiest type to shoot are those that walk around, things get trickier when you have enemies firing at you that can fly. These aliens are also quite smart, if shot they will continue to move to try and evade your fire. they will take cover behind objects, and can sneak an attack on you.

Check out the looney intro that details Bosc's plans to invade Earth, and shows Blasto alerted to the danger. The whole look of the game has been inspired by classic Warner cartoons like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. On each level there are scantily clad, caged females that Blasto must try and save. Don't ask us why the aliens have caged these women, it's not very PC. These cages are usually placed in some very difficult to reach places. Like the doors to progress through the levels, you must locate switches to release the cage. That's the easy bit. Then you must find the girl, who will now be wandering around where the cage was, if you can get to her, she'll reward you with a kiss. Blasto has got a really fat ship. That's fat as in large, not phat as in good, alright. Wonder what he keeps in there anyway. COMING SOON DARN, DRAT AND BLAST-O! From what we've seen of Blasto so far, we feel a little shortchanged. At the moment the gameplay and levels are pretty predictable, hopefully deeper into the game exciting things will happen. We'll find out very soon. "

"pogen computer Video games ES ROM The flames reduce enemy sight. The skulls are your dead troops. A three way stand off! Cool! 1 A lone soldier is not all bad. EASY DOES IT EYE, EYE, CHERRY PIE. The key to being successful in Commandos is stealth. There is no point in running in, all guns blazing because you'll simply get wasted. Your best ploy is to send in the 'Butcher' and take out the troops one by one. Killing a single guard in his own is easy, you simply select the knife, run up behind him and slit his throat. Carry the body away so the guards don't become suspicious. If there are a couple of enemies patrolling a certain area, use you handgun to finish them off. Each soldier takes three hits, but the guns have a very good rate of fire, giving you the advantage. The 'Eye' icon in the top right of the screen is a very important tool you have use of. By clicking on this, and then moving the icon over an enemy sergeant, you'll be able to see their entire field of vision. It'll show you which objects they cannot see around, who or what they are guarding, and the distance they can shoot at you with. If you stray into the light green area of their sight, you'll be subjected to an absolute pasting, as this is the guaranteed hit area' if you like. The light green section is further away and obviously, the shots have less chance of connecting. The gun icon shown here means that any target here will be out of range. You need to get closer. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN 'Fins' is one of the most important members of the team. He is the guy that can pilot the inflatable dingy if necessary, and also has a complete Scuba outfit on him, so he can swim from island to island to take out any guards on his own. However, he cannot run very quickly, due to the immense weight he carries with him. To use the scuba gear, all you have to do is run to the edge of the water, and a gas cylinder will appear on his backpack in the bottom right corner of the screen. Click on this and he'll dive in, ready for action. The benefit of this, is that you can sneak right up to men while still in the water, dive out and slit their throats before they have any idea what is going on! MAYBE YOU CAN HIRE: THE COMMANDOS! THE KEY TO VICTORY To save you from clicking all over the screen, pulling out various weapons and wasting time, all of the important moves have shortcut keys on the keyboard. For instance, of you want to make a guy run to a barricade, crouch behind it, then storm a guard and slit his throat, you can do it doing three simple button commands. Double click where you want the guy to sprint to, and hit C to crouch. S makes him stand up and X pulls out the knife. Double click the knife icon on the guy you want to top and that it. One dead guy in double quick time. HE KI 1 Footprints alert any nearby soldiers. SIR YES SIR! COMING SOON 0 EVERYBODY GET DOWN! The aspect of Commandos that has the most potential is the multiplayer element. Although not yet installed into the demo version, the multiplayer game will let up to six people take control of one troop at any time. This means that you don't have to think about who does what, but can instruct others to get in where it hurts, or even cover the forward running enemy to distract the enemy fire! Once you make a noise, or gunshots are fired, troops start to pour out of the houses in an attempt to ambush you. Commandos has a ton of potential, and at this early stage looks as though it could be fulfilling it. It really engrossing and you find yourself getting sucked into the missions without realising! However, the demo version did have a few bugs in it, so we'll reserve any major judgement until the review, which will be in next months issue. "

We said Tombi was side-scrolling, maybe that was a little lie, because although the game tricks you into thinking this, Tombi can venture in and out of the screen to search for objects and a way through the levels thanks to the 3D backdrops. It may look simple but Tombi is smarter than it first appears. AP 4200 PlayStation Climbing up here, will allow T to make a massive fried egg. Search everywhere for other paths.

This involves doubling back on yourself to search for lost or hidden objects and people. You also need to look for other routes for the journey. This is where the 3D comes into play, as you must find paths leading into or out of the screen. This is where tombi gets exciting.

If you want to be a true fighting game champion, you need complete mastery of Tecmo's Dead or Alive as well! ekken 3 gives you the chance to act like you're in a Bruce Lee movie, but Dead or Alive is more like a super-high-speed Jackie Chan fight-fest. It's got everything that makes kungfu movies so much fun to watch wild moves, painful throws, and plenty of edge-ofyour-seat last minute escapes. The whole idea of the game is to master evading and returning attacks, and fights are constantly being turned on their heads when two good fighters are playing. There's nothing quite like it, and you'll need to get your head in gear before you get stuck into the game which is where we come in... HOM As you may know by now, Dead or Alive doesn't have a standard Guard button like most other 3D fighting games. Instead it has the unique Hold button which lets you quickly push attacks away, or do certain throws. Here's the basis of how it works: GRAPPLE THROWS COUNTER ATTACKS Although Dead or Alive seems to attack. The Hold button makes your play like Sega's magnificent Virtua fighter quickly push attacks away, Fighter series, there's one big differgiving you a chance to hit back, but ence you can't just guard every you'll need to perfect the timing. As with all the best 3D fighting games, certain characters can link holds together to make powerful throw combos. These are the most damaging attacks in the game, plus they look brilliant if you manage to pull them off during a fight. You use the Hold button to start the throws oil, then add extra moves onto the end to do even more damage. You can normally spot which holds can be extended with extra throws by watching the way the fighters move. Take some time to figure all of them out. Learn your opponents' behaviour so that you can predict when they are going to attack, then catch their moves and hit back! Jann-Lee has this headlock throw using the Hold button. (7 You can use the Hold button to initiate a second throw... Which links from the headlock smoothly. Very cool. REVIEW Here's one of Gen-Fu's simple Hold button throws. + He holds his opponent's hand, then hits their face... 1 And a second Hold throw makes him slap them away! * "


"DOES MY BUMT OOK BIG IN THIS? Video games 2 153 GEN-FU PlayStation DANHER: KEEP OUT! One of the most original features of Dead Or Alive is the Danger Zone around the edge of the fighting arenas. It's safe to walk or jump on it, but if you're knocked over, an explosion does lots of damage and throws you high into the air, ready for more hits. This adds lots more strategy to the fights, as it's possible to lure your opponent into the Danger Zone and do big damage to bring a fight back from the edge of defeat. In the arcade and on the Saturn it's easy to see the Danger Zone it looks like a metal grid with hot coals underneath, but in the PlayStation version the difference is more subtle. Also, there's no limit to the arenas as in previous versions so it's You can use the Danger not possible to get a Zone's explosions to throw Ring Out victory any your opponent back into more. Instead, the the air where you can keep stages go on and on hitting them. This lets you infinitely as they do in do some amazing combos. the Tekken games. One of Zack's costumes makes him look like a Teletubby. JANIN -LEE As with the Saturn version of Dead Or Alive, there are loads of hidden costumes for each character. Each male fighter has five outfits (Raidou has three), while the ladies each have 15! As you finish the game with someone, another choice is added to their virtual wardrobe so it takes quite a bit of work to collect the whole set. The costumes aren't all serious in fact, there are some completely bizarre ones! 99as BAYMAN TINA person Surely Bayman's scuba outfit would be difficult to fight in. HAY Throws do a lot of damage when performed in the Danger Zone. They can even start combos! REVIEW Each of the female characters has a big selection of wacky skimpy costumes. "


"computer Video games THE NEW CHALLENGERS The PlayStation version of Dead or Alive adds two fighters to the original arcade bunch. On top of the standard eight selectable characters and the final playable boss, Raidou, you also get a wrestler called Bass and a hidden white-haired girl, Ayane. BASS A Hulk Hogan lookalike (he even does a similar pose when he wins a fight!), Bass has loads of cool throws and powerful punches and kicks. He's a lot slower than the other fighters, but can be a lot of fun to play. Take some time to learn everything that he can do before you take him into a proper fight or you'll look like a bit of a fool. IM PlayStation 9999 BASS BAYMAN 1 Bend one of her arms... + Then break them both... 1 Then drop her on her head! AYANE Once you've collected every single one of the costumes in the game you'll get to play as Ayane, another character exclusive to the PlayStation version of Dead Or Alive. She has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws are great for hitting people into the Danger Zone.

"FRESH LOOKS computer Video games 19es TINA PlayStation PlayStation Dead or Alive looks very different from the original arcade version. The whole game has a feel similar to that of Squaresoft's Japanese fighting game Tobal 2, and many of the backgrounds have been redesigned so that they work better with the new infinite fighting area. For example, the impressive moving elevator has been replaced with a new city ruins stage. Arcade Dead or Alive runs on Sega's Model 2 board, and though the fighters and backgrounds look fantastic, there is no real-time lighting. The PlayStation version has lovely coloured lighting effects in places which make the fighters look very solid and realistic. ZACK 2ND OPINION While fighting on this new snowy stage you can see the fighters' breath because it's so cold! 999 BASS After Tekken 3 and Virtua Fighter 3 you miss the ability to step around your opponent. However, the exchange of attacks in Dead Or Alive is so fast, you don't really have time to worry about this. Reversing and counter-reversing attacks is simple, but it's what you do with the opportunity this creates that is the key. Novice players tend to wind up trading slaps, but it's when you become skilled enough to reply with an impressive combo that this game really comes alive. I think Dead or Alive is less rewarding in a solo game than Tekken 3, but with two players competing, Dead or Alive pretty much makes XenDANIES YEH BABY SHAKE IT CVG OPINION Er GET YER BITS OUT FER THE LADS! You'll no doubt have heard about the overthe-top movement of the ladies' breasts in Dead or Alive, as it's one of the features that's going to get tons of 12-year-olds buying the game. Thing is, Tecmo took them seriously too and had one programmer dedicated entirely to ensuring that they moved realistically! What a job! Dead Or Alive makes more sense to me than Tekken does. Like the Virtua Fighter games, you can figure out your own combos and moves without resorting to a big list as you must with most fighting games. The thing that really makes it play differently is the way that it's so easy to counter moves, and this keeps the speed of the fights up. Also, someone who's not so great at the game will always have a chance of turning things around if an expert makes a mistake. The graphics are great, but don't look much like the arcade game the best thing is that they move so smoothly that it's easy to see what's going on. In twoplayer mode, Dead or Alive is lots of fun, especially if you've got two decent gamers playing. You really need total concentration if you're going to have a chance of winning, and you have to constantly plan in advance. The one-player game is marred by the fact that the ageold fighting game trick works constant jump kicks will beat any opponent on any difficulty level, ruining the feeling of fighting real people. But still, anyone into fighting games MUST get this as well as Tekken 3 it's more of a skill test than a memory test.

TILANTE t's Vigilantes versus Coyotes in this game of road rage in the American outlands. Mobile gangsters are out to ruin the USA by destroying its oil supplies, while outraged citizens fight back in the only way they know how fitting highpowered, top secret weapons to their cars and blasting the gangsters off the road. Vigilante 8 is the PlayStation 'adaptation of Activision's PC title, Interstate '76. It's not a conversion because the game structure has been changed and a couple of elements have been removed, but it still features the same kind of highway carnage and 70s style as its forerunner. DESTINY S ROAD IN QUEST ROUTE You start Vigilante 8's Quest mode with eight characters, four evil Coyotes and four goodguy Vigilantes, each with their own vehicle and their own 'destiny'. To fulfill his or her destiny, a character has to complete four missions in arenastyle settings around the USA, with the prime objective of destroying particular him and you're treated to a video of your targets if you're a Coyote, or defending character meeting their final destiny. them if you're Vigilante. To progress from As drivers complete their missions, mission to mission you have to complete new characters and new arenas are the main objective (blasting power transrevealed. To totally finish the game you formers at the Hoover Dam, for example) have to collect every character and comand also eliminate an ever-increasing plete their destinies. Only then will you number of enemy cars. At the end of the discover the mysterious force behind this fourth mission you take on a boss. Beat car-based carnage.

WICI TRUCKS WITH GUNS As well as a bonnet-mounted mini gun, all the vehicles have room for three special weapons. Stock up on homing and dumb-fire missiles, as well as auto-cannons, mortars and mines by running into the floating icons. Each character also has their own special weapon, things like killer bee swarms, scatter missiles or laser cannons. These are concealed inside green cer crates, which are found in open country and hidden inside buildings or in hard-to-reach places (like in mid-air) so getting to them needs a bit of trick driving. 10 REVIEW Houston 3 can pick up a laser turret. Loki's missiles split into bomblets! This warp takes you to mid-air prizes! 50 "


"AUTO KOMBAT! CAR BORNE COMBOS computer Video games You've thrashed your opponent within an inch of his life, but before you deliver the killing blow watch out for the 'TOTAL IT' message. This is the equivalent of the Mortal Kombat Finish Him' and it's your cue to obliterate your foe with a special move or a special weapon. Pull it off quickly and your foe gets thoroughly toasted while you get extra mission credit! Each weapon has two other high-powered functions which are activated with special joypad manoeuvres. Most are along the lines of firing several shots at once, or concentrating all your ammo into one enormous firestorm, but that's not all. Rockets can be used as decoys to draw away enemy homing weapons, or you can fire them without releasing them to give your car a speed boost. You can also fire shots which flip an enemy car over or send it out of control, or lay mines that magnetically trap a car, thus leaving it vulnerable while you lay into it with your bonnetmounted mini-gun. Ho ho. PlayStation The Strider has almost had it. Quickly pull off a combo! Strider TOTALEDI A Crater Maker special move and he's TOTALED! (sic) CO-DRIVERS Whales: Cars Tatalud . Gydive det: Aacing 15 . Most Wanted PASSCODE WINNIPLAYSCCL Press X le contine. Such a cool kill nets 85% and a Most Wanted rating. V8 has a split-screen two-player mode which works as one-on-one battle or a co-operative game. Pick your car then pick your opponents and set up how many you'll be facing. In the one-on-one battle the winner is the last man driving, but in co-op mode the game is over as soon as one of you cops it, so you've got to watch out for each other. CVG OPINION We prefer the horizontal split mode (below). This looks like a rather uninspiring deathmatch game with cars, but a bit more playing reveals the truth. Completing the missions while fending off the enemy cars is fun, and the basic challenge is really livened up by the addition of the special moves, the large, detailed arenas complete with hidden areas and weapons, and the way this whole 'destiny' business is structured. You might think repeatedly playing the game through with all the characters would be tedious, but the varied locations with new objectives and weapons make it different every time. Whether you go for the 70s style or not (it's not that prominent anyway), this is a cool and unusual shoot-'em-up which is definitely worth a shot. PAUL Git A eg NAM REVIEWS DUEL WITH A DUAL! RATING V8 plays better with one of the new Dual Shock controllers. That's not because of the vibro-palm effects, but because the car is easier to control with the left thumb stick, and you can also rotate and zoom the view to follow a target with the right thumb stick. Car-based shoot-'em-ups rarely work as well as Vigilante 8 does. A bit weird but fans of cars and explosions won't be disappointed. 51 "

However, Ocean took the plunge and it looks as though they'll reap the rewards.    9 HP PGs changed after Final Fantasy VII. Most viewed it for the better, the remaining minority for the worse. And their reasons for that were that the traditional RPGs would be lost amidst the 3D graphics overload. For the benefit of those people, Breath of Fire 3 is exactly what you have been waiting for. Everybody else, this is your chance to experience pre-FFVII hype. It's not about the look, but about how the game plays, and this is totally absorbing. Building up your character from a small, helpless boy into the awesome dragon-morphing warrior gives a real sense of satisfaction. The next three pages should convince you of the quality of this game. After the Unicorn guys kill you, the Dragon blood flows through your veins and you morph into this pup. hat YOU three killed ENTER THE DRAGON You start the game as a Dragon, but soon find that this is not how you stay. In fact, it's only once you really start to progress that you learn what is called the Dragon Gene System. Basically, even though you take the form of a human for the bulk of the game, you have the blood of a dragon flowing through you. This means you can alter your appearance during bat tles to utilise all of the powers a dragon would have. Once you have the power to morph, it's down to you to pick up all the dragon genes, so that you can use all the spells. REVIEW ATTACK Access on 2:22 DRAGON  Whelp Breath o implode Eye 0 *E! ame Breath o eFlame Ciano  Restore Form o Sursa E First, you need to pick the spell that morphs your character into a dragon. Then sit back and watch the transformation underneath this huge explosion. In your new Dragon form all of these spells can be used, using no magic points. The Whelp Breath is the best looking attack and can hit more than one enemy. And the Fire Claw attacks one enemy, but with an awesome amount of power. 52 "

PlayStation Busting your way into the mansion of McNeil is one of the tasks you have to undertake in the early stages of the game. Having saved the city once, you're asked if you can storm the mayor's mansion to rob him of all the tax money that he has stolen from the citizens. The trouble is, the McNeil ancestors are still kicking about in a ghostly form and are intent on stopping you. You have to defeat four of the old family members who haunt the mansion, before they all cobble together to make the ultimate ghostly beast. Defeating them all is tough, especially as you don't have Lei inciuced in your party, but thankfully he returns to you in time for the final and most important ghost battle in McNeil's bedroom. Nue Steve AP TeePo 36 HP AP Rei 18 HP AP HP 13 Teep AP The Jolt attack is one of the most common attacks for your team and enemies. The ghosts are still quite tough in this form.

DO YOUR JOB MATE Tees But this is the ghost they all morph into. It can cast all the spells the smaller ghosts had, plus a couple of other nasty attacks that you won't be expecting. Guard \"Heh heh .thanks In order to break into the McNeil mansions, you need to negotiate the guards who are patrolling the boundaries. The good thing as far as you're concerned is that most of these guys are really slack at their jobs, and can easily be sweet talked into letting you through. The first guard wants fifty gold pieces to move, and you get that from a thief who is hiding in the W grounds. The second has lost his wallet which you have to return to him, and another can be moved by ringing a bell, fooling him into thinking it's his time for break. It all culminates in the guard you fooled into taking a fag break saying that if you go and defeat the guard dog, it will look like it's the pup's fault rather than his, and he'll turn a blind eye as you scamper past! You soon discover the dog is no pup, though! 5 0 gold pieces and you're through. REVIEW After you morph into the dragon, your captors take you to their king to present you as a gift to him. "


"computer ooooo AM THE MAGIC MAN O games Magic and spellcasting are the key ingredients to this game if you want to get any great distance into it. As mentioned elsewhere though, you cannot get the better spells until you have the experience points and have linked up to a master. However, the programmers have really gone to town with the effects some magic TM PlayStation has, Teepo AP 13 Rel as these shots demonstrate The Dream Breath spell sends the unfortunate recipient into a deep sleep, but this gradually wears off after two or three rounds. The small egg above the dead Rei is actually you! The Chicken (called Rocky) has a spell which turns characters into eggs! And it last ages. e-t-turuan KICK, PUNCH, CHOP! Each character has a special attack or move that can be used at any time, even when you're not in battles. Each of these moves is activated by pressing the Triangle button. Your character swipes his sword, which is used first for chopping wood once Bunion has caught you in his house. Teepo has a kick attack which you need to boot over small rocks and boulders. Rei picks locks with his, and Nina (who you meet later in the game) gives you a swipe with her magic wand. CVG OPINION \"Hmmm....I was wondering what our thieves misht look like Once you meet up with these two guys, you know you're about to get into the really serious parts of the game. You cannot beat them in a fight, but you will get the chance for revenge later. COCKTAIL SIR? As you may have already guessed, I love Breath of Fire 3. It's this sort of RPG that restores my faith in the gameplay over graphics debate, because this is so engrossing to play, you really do become fully immersed in the story. The difficulty pitch in this is perfect too, with it being challenging all the way through and yet easy enough to progress once you've taken a little time to think about what you're supposed to be doing. Graphically, it certainly doesn't match FFVII, but it doesn't try to. And apart from the fact that they are both RPGs, there is no similarity between the two games. You can own both and see the best of both sides of the RPG spectrum. It's one of the few games that I really want to play through to the end, and I advise all of you to do the same. Awesome. STEVE As well as magic spells, you can also pick up items that have the same effect. Searching the more obscure areas of dungeons and houses will reap you rewards. Items like the Molotov, which sends a huge explosion crashing down on an unsuspecting enemy, or the Firecracker, which inflicts huge damage on a group of enemies, are good items to have stashed away. If you select Use from the fight menu, and scroll through the items you have, their effect is displayed at the top of the screen, in case you were wondering. REVIEW RATING A totally engrossing RPG that will have you sitting in front of your TV screen for hours. This comes very highly recommended. A small, but powerful explosion. Do you think they'll survive that? @ "

Get in, kill anyone or anything and get out. No questions asked. Think you're up to the task? .. M249 100400 VEMASTER 09 49 CDECODE. OULUUTO. hen you think about it, why nobody has tried to create a game like Special Ops before is a mystery. But that is irrelevant now, as Zombie have claimed this type of game as their own. This, they are hoping, will be the title that establishes the Special Ops brand, and their follow-up games reinforce it as the ultimate in army-based combat games. It went to number 2 in the all-formats chart in America, which is no mean feat. But will it do the same in Britain? If you people have any sense, it will! OBJECTIVE COMPLETE RURORR DESTROYED SATCON RADIO 13:07 SATCHEL SPECOPS: NOT A THORPE PARK RANGER Once you've selected the mission you want to play, you're given a choice of rangers to carry out the orders. These change according to the specifics of the level, but choosing the wrong people will usually result in your failure and death. The further into the game you get, the better-equipped the rangers become. The Sniper, for example, has a x4 zoom scope on his gun. Later on, he gets night-vision goggles too. CYGOPINTS SSG 1 /7 SATCHEL CHARGE 3 If you do not move away from explosives once they are planted, you'll take damage from the blast. FRAG GRENADE THE HILLS ARE ALIVE Right from the word go, you can tell Special Ops is going to be a good game. The military sounding music and still pictures are very cool, but nothing compared to what awaits you in the actual levels. Seeing your two guys ducking behind foliage and picking guys off with the sniper rifles is immensely satisfying. The missions are varied and become more challenging as you progress deeper into enemy territory. Graphically it's very impressive too. 3Dfx owners will be treated to loads of lighting effects (once a building catches fire, the flickering flames illuminate the ranger) and realistic terrain layouts. It's a shame more wasn't made of this game, but if they manage to get the SAS or Navy Seals license as they are hoping, the Special Ops series could become huge. STEVE PEN The sound is one of the main reasons this game works as well as it does. When you begin a level you can hear mortar fire in the distance and machine guns firing all around. Straight away you get into a sense of panic and hit the deck in case you picked off. You also have voice commands to instruct your other ranger. They're only basic, but \"follow me\" and \"fire 'em up\" are useful messages to activate at the touch of a button. SMOKE GRENADE 1 REVIEW As you can see, the lighting from 3D accelerated versions is very cool. (RATING RATING One of most atmospheric, enjoyable and engrossing games we've played in a long time. Special Ops deserves to be in your collection. @ 56 The camouflage outfits your guys wear change depending on the terrain. "

"computer Video games 0005 DE FIGHTING GAME BY ARC SYSTEM WORKS CHIPP  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD 1. RELEASED BY OCEAN TEL 0161 832 6633 OUT JUNE 1-2 PLAYER PlayStation PlayStation There can be only one name for a tournament featuring epic battles between the universe's greatest fighters Guilty Gear! GUILTY GEAR ther than the big games from Capcom and SNK, there are relatively few 2D fighting games around at the moment. Instead, many developers have chosen to make 3D fighters drawing and animating original detailed characters takes too long for most people to bother with. Which is why Guilty Gear comes as such a surprise a traditional-style 2D fighting game which has clearly had a lot of effort put into it. I WASN'T HE IN SOMETHING ELSE? There are 10 standard characters available when you start playing Guilty Gear. None of them are particularly original, but they all look and control differently from one another, even if just about every move is similar to one from another fighting game. oor DUO ZATOK A KICK IN THE CHOPS GUILTY GEAR A good combo system is what makes a great fighting game, and Guilty Gear's works very well indeed. Like the Street Fighter Alpha games it's possible not only to link standard attacks together in a \"chain\" combo, but also to mix them in with special moves and super attacks. With a little bit of practice you can figure out chain combos of over 10 hits which are very satisfying to pull off. It's also possible to do «juggle\" combos and keep your opponent in the air while you repeatedly kick them in. Unfortunately, Guilty Gear has one of the worst Training Modes ever. There's no way of calling up a moves list, there are no real training options, and your opponent falls over and restarts when they run out of energy. You might as well just play in Versus Mode. Chipp is the standard Ryu/Ken style fighter who is fairly quick, fairly powerful, and even has a Dragon Punch. Zato's very Vampire Savior. He has loads of dark spirits which attack from around him, a bit like Demitri. CVG OPINION OOD IDD OO00000 ILLIA COMBO SHINKUU-HADOKEN! As you'd expect, a power bar at the bottom of the screen goes up every time you attack, enabling you to do a super attack when it's full. These are performed in pretty much the same way as Street Fighter's moves normally two fireball motions followed by an attack button and they do similar things. Could be a big fireball, could be a crazy throw, or even a multi-hit combo. Guilty Gear is initially totally unappealing, with unoriginal characters and nothing that hasn't been done loads of times before. But take time to figure out some combos and it gets a lot better. Just about anything goes in terms of combos jumping attacks, chains, juggles, supers, even mid-air specials So 2D fighting game fans will appreciate this. The graphics aren't great, but a lot of effort has been put into certain characters, especially in terms of animation. The controls are just about right too, and everything moves at a decent speed. There's no way Guilty Gear is going to attract casual gamers, but hardcore 2D fighting game fans who've already had too much Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes or King Of Fighters will find plenty here to keep them happy. Unfortunately, no-one else will give a brass monkey's uncle's ass about it and will hate Guilty Gear completely. OD LOMAS VDOIDO OoSDD PRILLIAN REVIEW Super attacks start like this. RATING RATING O U Doesn't look great, doesn't do anything special, but can be fun to play if you take the time to learn it. One for real fight fans only. HIRAN @ 58 "

So what's the big deal then? It's just the pure simplicity of it that seems to have made it a winner. There are no ultracomplicated swing bars or tons of on-screen info to confuse you. It's just a plain and simple arcade style golf game. Anyone can pick it up and can, within a couple of holes, master the basics and will be looking at pars and birdies the rest of the way round. Cool. PAR3 228y TAKU REST Everybody's TOURNAMENT SELECT COURSE TEE FRONT REGULAR SAC NORMAL 10.35y Waikiki Pro-amateur 80-95% Notice the grass divot, even though the golfer is on the water's edge. Course 2 is not selectable at the start. STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE Taking a shot is incredibly simple in Everybody's Golf. The shot meter is a bar at the bottom of the screen and all you have to do is press X to start it going. Hit the same button when it gets to the end of the bar to set the power, and again when it returns to its starting point to judge the direction of the shot. Stop it too early and the ball will hook to the left. Too late and it'll slice off to the right. However, if you manage to stop it at maximum power and exactly on the accuracy line, you'll get the perfect shot. Your player will whistle as they are about to hit it, and the caddie will bellow \"Nice Shot\" as the same phrase appears at the top of the screen just to make you feel even more smug. REVIEW NICE SHOT. 100 First the power meter is stopped at the full monty... 1 ...and once stopped on 100% accuracy, the guy whistles... ...and whacks the ball with the orange trail, followed by... ... this lovely little message and approval from the caddie.

"MAD AS A MATTER computer video games FK3 13 3 MARY MAB HARY REST 594 15 DN REST ON GREEN REST 3.8711 TM PlayStation 10OF PT 100F1 A cool little feature to Everybody's Golf is the option you have to play Crazy Golf. As purveyors of Southend sea front or Brighton Pier will no doubt recognise, this is basically a nutty version of the real thing. You are placed in strangely shaped putting greens with small barriers running along the hole so that the ball never leaves the area. Then you have three shots to get the ball into the hole. This may sound simple, but when you have to deal with huge hills, U-shaped holes and water hazards, it can get tricky. But not that difficult really. WATCH THE BRDE KING OF THE NINE RON TOURNAMENT Try telling us that this view is actually useful. Playing in tournaments is the way to access all of the hidden courses and players. As you are playing, you may notice that you get points for birdies and eagles. These are your experience points. Once you collect a few of them, more of the game's features open up. By winning the first tournament, for example, you get enough experience to free the second course up. It does mean a heck of a lot of play if you're going to get the full benefits from this, but the rewards are quite satisfying. REST 24 ID SHIOT TAKU 10 Everybody's Every birdie and eagle you get will be rewarded with experience points. At the end of the tournament these are converted and you get a bulk total. Get over 50 on the first course, and the second becomes playable. FLAT CVG OPINION 2989 TAKU REST 208y 2ND SHOT 2017 Once you hit the green and are sweating it out trying to get that vital last par to win the tournament, a whole host of options become available to you. If you want to have a closer look at the putt in question, the triangle and circle will zoom in and out and start flips the camera to a view looking down on the green from a far view. R1 toggles the grid squares and L1 switches to a camera behind the hole. The cool thing is that everything can be used at the touch of a button. 3W MAX 2019 By pressing R2, you can gauge the wind distance as a handful of grass will fly up and blow in the right direction. If you want to be eased in to PlayStation golf games, then you can't go wrong with this. Graphically it is par for the course (no pun intended), and has multiple replays and so forth. But if you buy Everybody's Golf expecting some PGA simulation, after a couple of days' play it will end up gathering dust. Although this is a simple game to just pick up a play, there is no real sense of enjoyment in sitting through tournament after tournament trying to get the hidden courses up. It feels like robot golf. Swing, hit, chip, putt and repeat until finished. It's OK for the a quick nine holes, or even multiplayer with a few mates but unless the competition is fierce, you'll find yourself pretty bored. Something else which seems strange is the fact you cannot quit out of the game without physically turning off the machine! STEVE toeg CADDYSHACK REVIEW BABA TAKU REST 314 Among other little things that may interest you is the caddie. If you want to, you can have the caddie help you out with all of your shots. Use the options screen to select a male or female voice for your caddie, who will then automatically select the best club for you and adjust the difference in length as necessary. Sometimes you may need to override them by changing from a chip to a putt, but generally, they will do everything for you, leaving you to just whack buttons.

"computer Video games CORRIDOR GAME BY EPIC MEGAGAMES  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NINTENDO 64 VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CO (360 MB INSTALLI  RELEASED BY GT INTERACTIVE TEL 0171 565 7300 ROM OUT NOW 1-32 PLAYERS ROM It's been almost four years in development, but the time has paid off. Prepare yourself for the most amazing graphics ever seen! VOLEDO e've had to wait ages for Unreal it was first shown at around the same time as original Quake and has been worked on solidly since. Every time a breakthrough was made in PC technology, Epic MegaGames made sure that Unreal took full advantage of it. The result is a game which matches their original design, even though it once sounded completely impossible to make a game of such scope. If you want to experience the future of video game graphics today, buy the most powerful PC you can get your hands on and check out Unreal it'll blow you away. UNREAL LIFE OF The planet on which the Vortex Rikers has crashed gives off strange magnetic forces which have caused many other species to land over the years. The violent Skaarj have killed most of the other creatures, and are therefore the dominant species. The Nali are peaceful four-armed creatures who have lived on the planet for generations. If you're nice to them, they'll often guide you to hidden rooms, but go around threatening them and they'll just cower in the corner. !?! W-WHERE AM I? 12! TEINE The basic story of Unreal goes like this: You're a criminal being transported across the galaxy in a giant prison ship called the Vortex Rikers which goes haywire as it passes a distant planet. There's a massive crash and you wake up, injured, inside your damaged cell with the bodies of dead prisoners around you. Your first task is to get out of the prison ship. then work out where you are and what's going on... 1 The Nali look like four-armed versions of the Mudokons from Abe's Oddysee, only they don't go around farting. Be nice to them. PO  There are various classes of Skaarj warriors. The more armour they are wearing, the better their weapons are going to be. 1 You'll meet a few of these guys straight away. REVIEW A BULLET IN THE HEAD You start Unreal completely unarmed, but soon find a small laser blaster with an energy source which recharges infinitely. Plenty more turn up as you play through the game, each with its own ammunition and two firing styles. As well as a standard shot, each weapon can be fired a second way just like those in Dark Forces. For example, the standard blaster can fire single shots or can be charged up to fire more powerful blasts. The Eightball gun can be used as a rocket launcher, grenade launcher, homing missile, or even a superpowerful multiple shot cannon! 0 "


"HOLD ONTO YOUR EYEBALLS! games Unreal certainly has some of the most impressive graphics we've ever seen. Just about every single special effect so far invented has been used to create some incredibly atmospheric levels: Coloured real-time lighting. lens flare, volumetric lighting, real-time fractals, anti-aliasing. extro-triscrotular trunking. bicranial scabbing. and even polar sprouting. All of this means nothing until you actually play the game and discover that you get completely sucked into the game because of the amazing atmosphere that the graphics create. As you can probably guess, Unreal needs a big machine to run smoothly. Preferably something faster than a 300Mhz Pentium II with 64Mb RAM and a Voodoo 2 card (plus over 360Mb of hard drive space). We played the game on a MMX Pentium 200 with 32Mb RAM and a 3Dfx card and it's hardly playable, at all. Unfortunately. Unreal is a game for enthusiasts only. Rich enthusiasts. ROM DEATH FOR ALL THE FAMILY With multiplayer PC gaming getting more and more popular, it's essential for an action game like Unreal to have a good deathmatch mode. You can have free-for-all battles, team games, King Of The Hill games, and the cool Dark Match. Here you play in a pitch black level where every player has a torch. The deathmatch levels each have clever gimmicks in one level there's no health apart from a big green pod in the middle. Standing here regenerates your health, but makes you an easy target to the other players. In another, a voice lets everyone know when you tread on certain touchplates! 1 The scenery is truly amazing. The blue crystals on the left give off an amazing rippling blue glow. The detail on the creatures is astounding. You'll be letting them get right up close just so you can have a good look at them, even though they'll kill you in seconds. The Razor Jack is great fun to use in deathmatch mode. CVG OPINION UPID The glowing green thing is the Heal Pod. A switch in the level makes the roof squash anyone inside. CREATE NEW WORLDS Unreal's amazing game engine took Epic in a second, create fractals based on any MegaGames ages to create, and the free level pattern you draw, and watch the whole thing editor included with the game makes it clear created in 3D as you do. One of the most why. Anyone will be able to create incredible exciting things about Unrealed is that it will looking levels without too much trouble you mean that there will be hundreds of free levels can add real-time moving coloured light sources available within the first week of release. Wow. Wooooow. Waaaaaaaaaooooow. Unreal is the most impressive game I've seen for a long time. Every single graphics effect invented so far has been used to create one of the most absorbing game environments ever. The levels are all excellent, with awesome architecture and brilliant use of lighting, plus the atmospheric sound effects work really well too. But Unreal certainly isn't without its faults the physics of the game aren't quite right, and some of the fiddly little jumps you're required to do can be very annoying as you bounce off walls and drop off ledges. The enemies aren't as varied as we'd hoped, and you'll be fighting practically the same bunch on the last level as you were at the start of the game. At times they can be remarkably stupid too, though most of the time they act in a fairly lifelike way. There aren't as many enemies as there are in Quake, so more of your time is spent exploring and solving puzzles instead. And of course, we can't forget that you really do NEED a top-of-the-range PC to run the game at a playable speed. If you've got the power to run Unreal, you've got to have the game it's as simple as that. And before you ask... no, it's not as good as Quake 2. ED LAMAS REVIEW RATING RATING The UnrealEd game engine allowed Epic MegaGames to create stunning lighting affects such as this. You can do it too! 1 You can create stunning moving fractal patterns like this with ease using UnrealEd. The most impressive game you can buy. A great story, brilliant atmosphere and clever design, but you'll need a lot of money to play it.  "

The Road Rash series has been giving speed freaks the chance to risk their virtual lives for years, but is now coming up to date by turning 3D. As well as a whole new graphic style there are more new features, such as complex alternate routes, a massive city with roads connecting all of the game's 100 miles of track together, and even a simulated gang war going on.

While racing you can punch and kick other riders to knock them off their bikes, though they'll do the same back to you.

A distant siren is normally the first clue you get, but before long you'll have them all over your tail. Whatever you do, don't fall off your bike when there are cops around because you'll be picked up and busted, and fines don't come cheap. Your best bet is to try and outrun the law, but you can stay and fight if you want it's even possible to steal a police truncheon and use it as your own! E-S SW6095 0.00 The cops can go just as fast as you at the start of the game, so knock them off their bikes when you get the chance. Road Rash has always been fun-flying along open roads with a club in your hand, piling into oncoming cars is a winning formula. The change to 3D graphics is a welcome one, but the game doesn't look as good as it could. The bikes and scenery are pretty juddery and glitchy, and can get confusing at times. The game plays almost the same as it used to, with only a few changes. For one, punching and kicking is slightly slower than before making fights harder to start, let alone win. Also, when you fall off your bike you just magically appear on it rather than having to run after it like before. Dodging in and out of traffic to get to your damaged bike was one of the best things in the old Road Rash games, so it's a shame to lose it for Road Rash 3D. The bike handling is more realistic, and will take a bit of getting used to especially learning how to control slides. There are plenty of better racing games on the PlayStation, but Road Rash 3D is certainly fun for a while. SPEEDING ON THE NEEDLBUISS LETS RAAAAAAWK CHUX ROADHOUSE: Pick a race: Not in Kansas 5.1 miles Rolling hills to mountain roads. Light traffic Road Rash 3D is a real rock 'n roll experience thanks to the noisy soundtrack.

REVIEW 6V LOMAS Ends at Der Panzer Klub START HASTEN SHOP RATING RATING In Big Game Mode you race around America earning money from illegal high-speed Road Rash races so that you can afford better bikes. There's a big selection of rides, ranging from lightweight speed demons to easy-to-control beasts. Fire eating and rock music. Awesome! A bit of a messy game, but still has enough of the classic fun factor of traditional Road Rash for it to be worth playing.  "

You see, the guys over at Sensible Software are real football fans. They have spent the best part of six months tweaking, retouching and generally perfecting the minor details of the game. But the fact remains, that this is still the classic Sensi formula that enthralled Amiga owners all those years ago. The trademark top down view has benefited from a new 3D engine, so the players have much more animation than in any of the previous versions. It all adds up to another awesome Sensi game.

You also need to choose who goes for the corners (as mentioned in the Set Pieces boxout above), as well as who is to come back and be a part of any defensive wall your keeper sets up. There is a default setting for each team, but you may well want to chop and change those settings to suit your style of play. And a special mention must go to John Hare. Not only did he pen the awesome (!?!?!?!) theme tune AND sing it, he also wrote and voiced the commentary too. And he still found time to go to the bog and wash his hands afterwards! Is there anything this man cannot do? SENSIBLE WORLD CUP '98 CVG OPINION  CILU crnors THELDUCIRL EYEBOYZ S THE REVITS OWN Tony r.  r JASON ERL142.65 Taking penalties is something you're going to have to do the first couple of times you play, at least until you get the hang of the controls anyway. Let us give you a couple of hints about spot kicks. One thing you should know is that you don't control the keeper. The computer does all the work for you. And when you step up to the spot, hold left or right on the pad BEFORE you take the kick. Then hold the shoot button for about half a second with the direction still held down, and the shot will swerve into the corner, away from the goalie. The trouble with a game like Sensi is that the previous versions were so good, that you'll always be hard pressed to topple what has gone on before. And that seems to be the case here. Without comparison, Sensible World Cup '98 is fantastic. Brilliant fun to play and learn and especially good in multiplayer. But, little touches like being able to alter the difficulty settings to incorporate the star players and so forth. None of that is here. And remember, Sensi was always about how the game played, so the 3D engine is really only a small addition. I also found it a little jerky to begin with, but you do forget about that after a couple of goes. You cannot deny the quality of this game, but it doesn't significantly improve on any of the existing titles to make it the definitive Sensi. But hardcore fans will of course go mad for it and I advise those that have never played a Sensible Soccer game before to go and see what you've been missing. STEVE HEY TBA TEISE This is incredibly unrealistic, as Tom Guise would liever get man of the match. Even against women. JUST THE ONE In light of the recent battle between ITV and Sky for who could have the most ridiculous camera angles, Sensi has plumped for something a bit less harrowing. At any time during the game, hitting F5 will send the game into replay mode, where it plays back roughly the last 10 seconds of action. It automatically does this after a goal too. However, the programmers have gone to great lengths to ensure that you get to see everything in the replay, rather than an enclosed area. REVIEW RATING And that one's come back off the bar! Sensible have chosen to add only one replay camera which switches views depending on the action down on pitchside. A couple of missing details prevent this from being a classic, but is a fantastic football game nonetheless, and one we recommend highly. 67 "

KULA WORLD oving a ball around a floating maze may not sound like much fun, but you'll have to trust us when we say that Kula World is, well, cool. The basics of the game are as follows: you have to move the ball around the maze, collecting a set amount of keys to open up the gate to the next level. Picking up fruit is also of some benefit to you, as once all five have been collected, you'll gain access to a bonus stage. The maze can be rotated in any way, and you can look over the edge of sections if you think a platform may be just out of view. Still not convinced? Just nip down to the shops then and give it a go. You'll be surprised... 209200 If you can't work out what to do next, have a look over the edge of the maze. Touch the timer to spin the clock at the top of the screen back in your favour. 132910 KULA WORLD YEAH MAN. IT'S LIKE, WICKED! Negotiating the mazes is only half of your worries. The further into the game you get, the more obstacles get in your way. Pills distort the screen, slow you down to a crawl but make the timer tick quicker. Rolling over an egg-timer will flip the existing clock to give you more or less time. Gems and coins are nothing more than points, but considering you lose points for falling off a level or running out of time, they are very important collectibles. Spikes, flames, ice patches, whirlwinds and crumbling blocks are just some of the other hazards you'll encounter. CVG OPINION 1299 Yes yes, we know we've already reviewed Kula World a couple of issues back. But since then, changes have been made, so we thought it only fair that it gets another test run. Despite it getting the same score, it has been improved after the tweaks. So what makes it good then? Well you actually have to use your brain while you play. A bit of logical thinking is what's needed, and that in itself is refreshing enough for today's serious gamer. But it's also incredibly addictive. Once you breached the first few simple levels, the hours fly by as you become more and more focused on the task at hand. It's pure and simple fun, simple as that. STEVE 69 REVIEW 137918 RATING RATING A leap of faith is required, as some levels have invisible blocks that you can jump on. Floating objects are the big giveaway as to their location.

"computer Video games VIRTUAL PET BY SONY  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED . STORAGE 1 CD RELEASED BY SONY TEL 0171 447 1600 TM PlayStation OUT NOW 1 PLAYER PlayStation Like the hula-hoop and the yo-yo, the virtual pet craze continues. Not on a key-chain, but now in your PlayStation. PET IN TV et in TV, as the name would suggest, is all about raising a pet who lives in your TV. All you have to do is select the pet you wish to raise and help the creature develop. Give it some attention, food and play games with it. It may sound like a Tamagotchi, but Pet in TV is a much bigger game. This isn't a pet that'll eat up your spare time, it doesn't need you constantly, just play with it when you want. But remember to leave some milk near the TV. Trying to turn upside down He shouldn't be doing this, he should try to eat the food. 2T IN TV Maybe he shouldn't have kicked that object Lots of bridges here to try and get across. THREE MEN AND A BABY  98 Pet in TV is more about mental growth rather teach the pet how to react and approach each than physical. You must make all decisions for object he comes across. Do this well and, in your pet, and take it for a walk in the strange time, your pet will know what to do if it comes surroundings. Your pet is just a baby, so it's across the same object. Mess up and your pet seeing everything for the first time. You must will become very confused. CVG OPINION A little pat on the head always cheers them up. Pet in TV won't win any awards for graphics, sound or even gameplay, but that's not to say it's a bad game. Its main fault is that it has missed the virtual pet craze by a year, and now people probably won't be interested in it. The game itself is simple, with you having limited but vital control over the pet. Watching your creation develop is mildly rewarding, but it does seem more of a chore than fun. Basically it's a puzzle game with your parenting technique helping to speed the proceedings along. Sadly, I can't see who this would appeal to, it doesn't have the attraction of other 'odd' games like PaRappa or Mr Domino, and is best labelled a curiosity, ALEX 4WITALA Safely back home. Dr Y, your teacher and friend, will help your pet overcome any troubles. REVIEW I WILL SAY THIS ONLY ONCE (RATING RATING OUT To help you get started, there is a useful training ground. Once you've learnt the basics it's on to one of seven different levels, where the exploring gets increasingly tougher. Each part of a level is like a mini puzzle with several objects and, sometimes, other creatures to check out. There'll also be times when you need to move objects in order to progress, for example using blocks to build a bridge over a gap. It's not easy being a parent. Too much pain for too little gain. Out-dated attempt at jumping on the virtual pet bandwagon. Will anyone actually want to buy it? "

What a pity then, that our favourite bomb chucker has had an identity crisis of late. You see, the little fella has had a difficult time trying to break into the third dimension. He's desperate to do it, and has given it more than one shot. He's tried different styles of games, but all to no avail. Now, desperate for some more recognition, he's trying to keep it simple again. The same explosive gameplay, with an isometric viewpoint being the only hint at 3D. But even this small slant may dampen his dynamite. BOMBERMAN WORLD O X2 SCORE 7200 FTTTTTTTT BOMBERMAN WORLD HOW TO MAKE A CLASSIC StFC T STAGE SPARK BOMBERO STAGE 10 2 The Bomberman series is a testament to gaming excellence and essential sequels, marred only in recent years by a mild identity crisis. The secret to the success is simplicity, because Bomberman is something anyone can play. It only takes minutes to learn the controls and devious gameplay. As Bomberman, you plant bombs then take cover. Essentially that's all Bomberman is. Along the way there are multiple power-ups to collect, boosting Bomberman's abilities. Conquer the story mode and defeat the huge bosses, then battle it out against your friends in one of the best multiplayer games in existence. Those are the basics of what a clas sic Bomberman game has and needs. Bomberman World features all this, but there are a few teething troubles. SEESAW PARK 1 There's 10 different battle stages, all in the traditional super-cute Bomberman style. 1 A new addition is the electric stick challenge, playable after you win a battle. SCORE: 20000 @ 00:50 REVIEW The story mode is set over four worlds, with Bomberman visiting each and ridding the planets of all nasties, and bosses. For a different test, try the challenge mode, where you must rid an entire level of nasties and defeat a boss in the required time. The challenge is you only have one life! 70 "


"IT'S ALL WONKY! 6 I'LL BLOW YOU AWAY   computer video games For the first time, your Bomberman thrills are presented in an isometric 3D perspective. Previously, the game has been viewed from an overhead angle, and in full 3D in Bomberman 64. As the Bomberman series has been around for so long, this slight slant on the action will divide the long-time fans. The graphics now look like they belong on a PlayStation rather than a NES, but it does hinder the gameplay slightly. Especially in the story mode. Enemies will sometimes be obscured by objects in the foreground which can be quite frustrating. If you've never played a Bomberman game before, you probably wouldn't even question this, but the purists will be up in arms! TM PlayStation mxl SCORE: 11000 0 0329 174 01842 000 1 Indiana Jones was here, and every platform star ever since. The runaway minecar is back! X2 SCORE: 3400 003438 4/5 Like in most Bomberman games, the multiplayer battle mode justifies the price of the game on its own. This is the section of Bomberman World you'll come back to and play long after you've completed the quest and tournament modes. Featuring ten specific battle arenas, with the trademark last man standing rules for up to five players, this is where Bomberman comes into its own, as one of the best multiplayer games in existence. Again the isometric perspective plays a part in things, as some arenas feature a split level, if B-men get to the upper level, they can drop bombs on their opponents. WIN BOMBERMAN WORLD ^ Pretty levels, but some of the scenery can get in the way of the destructive action. DAZED AND CONFUSED CVAOPINION Compared to some of the other games in the Bomberman series, we found this Bomberman adventure quite easy. Even with the addition of creatures who can trip you up, leaving you vulnerable to attacks. Keep an eye out for the moles and little monkeys who do this. Remember, you can always try to plant bombs near where you think a mole will pop up. Another new Bomberman game, and the successful formula becomes diluted and confused. Bomberman World is the first game in the series I've played that's been marred by some basic errors. The two main culprits are the speed of Bomberman himself, who is far slower than his enemies even with multiple speed-ups; and there's some poor collision detection. Considering the superior playability of the series, these errors are catastrophic. The rest of the game is slightly spoilt by the perspective and difficulty level. Only the excellent battle mode saves this game from being a complete waste. It's a shame, as PlayStation has won over so many new gamers, and this would have been their first taste of Bomberman. now he may never get the chance to win their hearts, like he won mine many years ago. ALEX 4WATALA Look out for that hand. It can throw bombs at you. OxSCORE: 4000 004:38 REVIEW 1 Look out for the living rock! RATING 1 Another boss, but Bomberman has got an extra life, thanks to the creature he's mounted. Some basic flaws spoil the game. Thankfully the multiplayer mode shows signs of the true Bomberman skills. 71 "

BY INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT 1-6 PLAYERS he most accurate motorcycle simulation ever made' is the claim on the box, and we won't deny it. Not that we've ever gone racing on a 500cc megabike, mind you, but Superbike certainly gives you the impression of tearing around hairpins and through chicanes at unsafe speeds, with an enormous beast between your thighs. There's no shortage of tournament and bike. tuning options, and you can activate effects like weather, bike damage and driving help such as braking and steering assistance. If you have a 3D accelerator installed the hi-res bike graphics and the exotic scenery look ace, but if not you're going to be riding around Chunkyville at about 10 frames per second, as we found on our P200(!).

Mr Domino is a living domino who runs around Micro Machines-style household courses laying dominoes and then toppling them in spectacular stunts. You have to steer Mr D (or a Teddy Bear-shaped pal) around the course, avoiding obstacles and laying the dominos so that, when nudged, they hit the switches that set off the stunts. The ultimate test is to lay them so that one nudge sets off all the stunts via an unbroken series of chain reactions. It's not very often we see a unique PlayStation title, and it's even more unusual to see such a game that's actually any good, but Mr Domino is both original and fun. I can't see it appealing to everyone but any. one after something different will love it.

COCIDO ASTRO-FIGHTNG PlayStation BLASTRADIUS OUT NOW BY PSYGNOSIS LONDON 1-2 PLAYERS n the face of it, this looks like Psygnosis wheeling out its Colony Wars engine for another easily-produced round of 3D space shoot-'em-up action. Even if this is true, though, Blast Radius is the better game, being more of a pure blast than Colony Wars, without the hokey story-telling and with much better graphics. This time, as well as saving the Earth from aliens, you have to obliterate enemy ships to earn bounties that buy improved shields, better guns and smarter missiles for your ship. Colony Wars' spectacular pyrotechnics are back in force, but the clunky-looking vessels have been replaced by curvy star-steeds, decorated with intricate texture maps and elegantly lit. It's a bit of a bimbo game, sure, but the lovely visuals, together with the simple but varied missions are just about enough to keep you coming back for more... and more.

The chunky polygon ensemble of street kids give it the semblance of Fighting Vipers, except not as classy. On the plus side, all 16 fighters have different styles to master, and the action is sufficiently fast and fluid to let you string together impressive chains of punches and kicks and juggle airborne opponents. The specials are mostly throws rather than projectiles so there's not much in the way of pyrotechnics, and there are one-button power moves so powerful they can throw off the balance of the fight. All in all, it's not a bad beat-'em-up but is three months really too long to wait for the best ever console fighting game?

Dead Ball Zone is a violent future sport, a bit like football, except for the fact that the players carry the ball, throw it to each other, bounce it off the walls, then slam it into the net. In Speedball the violence didn't go much further than charging down the opposition, but in DBZ you can arm your players with guns, bombs and chainsaws to eliminate the opposition's star striker. Blood isn't the only thing that flies in this game players that take vers that take a bit of a hammering end up vomiting on the pitch. Aside from the digust factor this is a good game with a surprising amount of skill involved. The slow-witted may find the action is so fast it's hard to follow, but hey, that's their problem.

WRESTLING O WCW NITRO STING HOLLYWOOD PlayStation OUT NOW BY INLAND 1-2 PLAYERS he smaller brother to the N64's WCW Vs. NWO, WCW Nitro features fewer wrestlers and only allows two players to com pete simultaneously (not that surprising, really). Sadly the number of moves has also been reduced, and the ones we're left with aren't as instinctive to select either. There seems to be a slight lag between pressing a button and your wrestler moving, which proves annoying after a while. The extra texture-mapping on the wrestlers mean it looks slightly better than the N64 game, but the animation is a lot jerkier. My favourite part of the N64 game was a four-man battle royal, but the closest thing in WCW is the tag team challenge. Sadly this is essentially half of what the N64 game offered, hence the title change.

Maybe it's got something to do with the amazing 1080° coming out since then. Phat Air's main flaw is the controls far too sluggish. It takes great effort just to perform a small trick, and after a while it feels like too much hard work. The tracks prove more pleasing, and the graphics make the courses look quite realistic compared to Cool Boarders. There's also the now compulsory big air ramp and halfpipe, plus a championship mode with slalom races. The best feature is the ability to improve your boarder, by earning points which can be added to different attributes. If only the controls were better, this would be a game worth investigating. As it stands, it's badly flawed. ALEX HUHTALA POSITION TIME LIMIT 443  PRICE .99  SATURN VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CO  PUBLISHED BY FUNSOFT Better than Cool Boarders 2?

His hatred for the young fighters has grown, and many of them have been hunted down and imprisoned. But there's one bunch who won't give up the eight original Vipers, Mahler (a relative of BM) and two new kids on the block. They're taking to the streets of Neo Armstone City dressed in battle armour and armed with whatever they happen to have on them at the time skateboards, guitars, whatever. Fighting Vipers 2 is going to feature some of the most incredible fights you've ever seen. INNER THE VIPERS ARE BACK IN TOWN! STAGE 52 29 Grace is still the kicking master in Fighting Vipers 2. Her quick advancing combos are very hard to avoid. Honey's costume is more risqué than it has ever been! She'll catch a cold wearing that. SIGHTING VIPERS HONS Fighting Vipers 2 runs on Sega's incredible Model 3 Step 2 arcade board, and has a completely new look to it. The powerful hardware means that the characters can be far more detailed than they were in the first Fighting Vipers (Emi even has a scrolling LCD display on her arm!), and the backgrounds look especially good. For example, on one stage you fight in a glass arena hanging from a helicopter, while another is set inside a museum with a giant rotating T-Rex skeleton right next to it!

"THE NEW KIDS computer video games All of the original Vipers are back with brand new moves and improved techniques. Plus two new characters have been added to the game. Gme CHARLE Sex: Female Age: 12 Speciality: Mech Smash Personality: Bright, full of energy and sassy, but smart and level-headed. Sex: Male Age: 17 Speciality: Bicycle Move Personality: Hotblooded, quick to fight and hates to lose. Emi fights with a giant Teddy Mech strapped to her back which she uses as part of her strange style. She's joined the Vipers in their battle against B.M. in order to rescue her kidnapped grandfather. Charlie is a BMX-riding expert who can use his small bike in fights. He goes to the same school as Picky, who is his arch-rival. His desire to be better than Picky at everything has led him to become a Viper and fight against BM. CHALLENGE 1 Emi looks very weird with her giant boots, gloves and teddy + Charlie can even fight with his BMX hanging from his back. SUPER KO! THE VIPERS ARE BACK IN TOWN! The first Fighting Vipers has a lot in common with the Virtua Fighter games, but Vipers 2 moves much further away. Everything has been exaggerated and speeded up, plus it's now possible to pull off Super Ko attacks. These can't be blocked and will take all of a fighter's armour off and finish them in one go! These moves provide some very impressive special effects when they connect. CAUTION FIGHTING VIEWS CAUTION CAUTIO TIGTING VERS 2 FIGHTING VIDERS RPG? The regular Arcade Mode of Fighting Vipers 2 is very unusual. Rather than simply fighting through a group of characters one by one, your route changes each time depending on how well you fight. Before each fight you get to see a map of the game showing which route you've taken, so you can come back on another occasion and take a different path through the story. @XOJ J?

Soon you'll be able to defeat the evil Shinnok from the comfort of your own home. ROM MURTAL 4 KOMBAT NINTENDO 64 or some people, a fireball is an impressive move in a fighting game. Tekken's leg-snapping will raise a cheer from most, and Killer Instinct's 80-hit combos impress just about everyone, but there's a big gang of gamers who want more. More violence! They want to see limbs bent backwards in their sockets, they want heads pulled off, they want hearts ripped out, they want dead bodies blended in giant fans. These sick people are known as Mortal Kombat fans, and they're going to go crazy for the latest in the series Mortal Kombat 4. Here's a first look at all three home versions of the game. MUKTAI MONSTER IN MY POCKET You have to beat this 3D Goro before Shinnok in arcade mode. Each fighter keeps a weapon concealed in their pants which can be pulled out with a simple button combination. These range from a crossbow to swords and clubs, plus it's possible to pick up and throw bits of scenery such as boulders and skulls! You can even steal your opponent's weapon and use it against them. WINS: 00 TIIN CAN YOU BE SHANG TSUNG? OR BARAKA? OR KANO? THE EXCELLENT HOME VERSIONS OF Mortal Kombat 4 has 15 regular playable characters, some of whom you'll remember from previous MK games. The old favourites are Raiden, Liu Kang, Reptile, Scorpion, Jax, Johnny Cage, Sub-Zero and Sonya, and they're joined by new boys Kai, Shinnok, Reiko, Jarek, Tanya, Fujin and Quan Chi. The Nintendo 64 version is currently the most complete, and also has Goro as a boss! The final game should have both Goro and Noob Saibot as playable hidden fighters 1 You can hit people right into the screen! 1 Weapons can really turn the fights around. Liu Kang has stayed almost the same through all four MKs. POSW START REPTILE WE WANT DEATH! WE WANT DEATH! (NEW GAMES The Mortal Kombat games are known for their excessive comic violence, and Mortal Kombat 4 has just as much ever. Buckets of blood are thrown around as you fight; arms, legs, backs and necks can be snapped, and you even get to kill the loser in some disgusting fashion. Although the Fatalities aren't as comical as some of Mortal Kombat 3's, each one will make you chuckle quietly. There's something sickeningly funny about watching someone's arms being pulled off... GET OVER HERE! WHAT'S THE NEXTBUS PLEASE? Whoops! There go Sonya's arms. et MORTAL KOMBAT MORE CORPON WINS RAIDEN ONS As the release of Mortal Kombat 4 has been brought forward, we'll hopefully be reviewing all three versions of the game next issue. If you want to get in some practice, get down to the arcade and play MK4 Revision 3they've finally got rid of most of the bugs! Jarek is like Kano he can even rip hearts out. This is one of Scorpion's Fatalities, not an Animality. Raiden's lightning can explode his opponents. 78 "

Copyright Psywnons UK  97.3 POS a ecTender Time oaahh, Nelly! We can't wait for this one. The PlayStation version may be nigh-on three years old but we have no objections with Psygnosis reviving a modern classic. What can we expect from WipEout 64? Psygnosis says it will be an evolution of the original PlayStation games rather than being WipEout 3. The gameplay won't change drastically but the graphics will be enhanced, plus there will be new tracks and a splitscreen multiplayer mode that allows up to four people to compete let's hope they can keep the speed up, eh? The other thing we want to know is which control model they'll be using the smooth, skillful one from the first game or the more responsive one from 2097... or indeed, something totally new that uses smooth 3D-stick power? O:57. Copyright Psywnosis UK POS CHOCR 0:54.) There was a time when only a madman would have thought a I role-playing game could sell more than 6 million copies all over the world. And yet here we are, a year after the Japanese release of Final Fantasy VII, all desperate to find out what happens next to Cloud, Barrett and the rest of the Avalanche gang. On May 15th, Square held a press conference in Japan, revealing the first details of the new game, and among them was confirmation that the stars of FFVII won't be topping the bill in the sequel. Apparently FFVIII will be a more in-depth story with two distinct threads and two stars, 17-yearold warrior, Squall Leonhart, and 27 year-old Laguna Lorie, whose paths Cross somehow during the course of the game. Once again, the setting is futuristic, but this time Square's designers have given the action a more realistic look, with properly proportioned, texture-mapped characters. However, the battle scenes will feature even more spectacular effects than FFVII's. Final Fantasy VIII is down for Japanese release towards the end of the year and elsewhere shortly after. Square's President, Tomoyuki Takechi, has promised that FF fans elsewhere won't have to wait as long as they did for the last game, so we could be looking at a European release by Easter of '99. The hardcore, I-Can't-Wait-That-Long FF fans will be pleased to hear that Square is releasing a demo disc featuring a sample of gameplay and a 10-minute video that was shown at the press conference. The disc is being given away free with Square's next PlayStation title, Brave Fencer Musashiden, which is out in Japan on July 16th and will no doubt find its way into some import shops purely on the strength of the free disc. Are you sufficiently FF crazy to splash out for that? We want to know!

We kinda liked the old Kain look, but hey, progress... lood Omen received mixed Dreviews, but no-one will be in any doubt over the sequel. Crystal Dynamics has replaced the standard top-down RPG look of the original with a more Tomb Raiderish engine. The star is Raziel, one of Kain's vampire acolytes who has been cast into a vortex for the sin of developing superior skills to his master. In the vortex, Raziel meets The Elder, an ancient power who had his nose put out of joint when Kain took over and now wants his own back. As Raziel you're the tool of the Elder's revenge, travelling between spectral and material realms to claim souls for your new master. The quest involves exploring around the 3D environment, solving puzzles and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the characters you meet, then sucking their souls out for sustenance. Sounds unholy, but, as you can see from the pics, it looks pretty cool. hocking. Criminal megalomania used to be frowned upon, but these days Eidos is encouraging it with this a strategy game that casts you as a minor 1920s hood out to take over the city. Starting with a modicum of capital you have to build up your business piece by piece, working protection rackets, prostitution, illegal liquor, gambling and eliminations. Use legit businesses and charitable organisations as a front for your illegal operations, and if the cops come snooping around splash some payola around at City Hall or pull out your tommy guns and start shooting (not a good idea). You can expand your busi FERREIRA ness by making alliances with other bosses (other players in network game mode), but if you get too big you may attract the attention of a major player and start a gang war.

One of the gods of game design, Sid designed classic empire building games like Civilization and Railroad Tycoon. In his latest, Alpha Centauri, you find yourself aboard a colony ship that has left Earth only to collide with an asteroid. By the time the ship reaches Alpha Centauri, the colony is in chaos and the passengers have formed into seven factions, all fighting for control. As a faction leader it's up to you to gain control of the whole colony and steer it towards survival. It's all about exploration, terraforming, creating tools and weapons, avoiding hostile alien creatures, conquering the other six factions, and ultimately leading them to the next stage of evolution, which is nice. It might sound like standard stuff, but Sid Meier has never been one to disappoint so we're betting this will be a game to look forward to. eturn Fire was one of the few decent games to appear on the 3DO, so we welcome Electronic Arts' sequel with open arms and mmm slaver ing lips. For the uninitiated, it's a sort of heavy armour combat simcum-deathmatch, with you roaming cities, deserts, jungles and arctic tundra, hunting enemy players so you can blast them to shrapnel. As you can see, the developers, Prolific, have abandoned the old bird's-eye view of the action in favour of a more in-the-thick-ofthings 3D viewpoint.

The idea behind the game is very simple, but those that fancy their chances on the wheels of steel or are already hardened pros on the decks, will find Fluid a cool little alternative to vinyl and slipmats. In a nutshell, you start the game in control of a dolphin, which you must guide into different patterns of music located in an ocean called Silent Space. Once inside, you enter a cruise stage where the game learns new music beats and riffs. Then you head back to Silent Space and into the Groove Editor where you can then mix and juggle with the samples until your heart's content. It sounds weird, but it's immensely cool. GUEST CREAMFIELDS 02059 GROOVE CITY PlayStation Once you're into the Groove Editor, this is where the game really opens up. You can change drum beats, cymbals, bass lines and even the BPM (that's Beats Per Minute, you philistines). The thing is, you're not just restricted to one particular style of music. The longer you play, the more variations appear. Anything from big beat stuff, to dodgy, tinny drum 'n' bass can be fiddled with, providing you've guided the dolphin through that world. And finally Creamfields. A 17-hour dance spectacular in a field in Winchester. The cream (no pun intended) of British and European DJs were playing to packed-out tents. Roni Size, Fatboy Slim, Run DMC, Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, Pete Tong and Judge Jules were just some of the names worth mentioning, so needless to say, it absolutely rocked. If you have the chance to go next year, take it. Things like Creamfields don't happen very often. THEN WHAT? en Paul Oakenfold plays without watching the screen: Cool. You save your master mixes to your memory card and then return to the silent space arena. Then all you have to do is swim back into whichever pattern you've come from, and your music will be playing, as the dolphin glides through relaxing underwater stages! Cool. This is also where you discover the new beats and samples, because the option appears as the dolphin is swimming to duck out into new sections with new music. 180SX GETS Norman Jay mixe little TV with mus Steve and Tom take a break from the sun. 82 "
