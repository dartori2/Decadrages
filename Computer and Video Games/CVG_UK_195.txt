We're not asking for your blood, just your respect. It's sad when we hear people saying that the magazines can't be trusted! WE can be trusted! In return for your loyalty we will always work to make sure CVG gets better and better every month. If we didn't believe, if we weren't so committed, we would've died at our desks years ago! We're living for some incredible developments through 1998. For once in a long time these aren't all technology related. More than ever before the focus is going to be on great games, and the ability to distinguish between these and average software (nothing worse than an average game!).

"GVG TEAM'S REVIEW OF THE YEAR 1998 computer video games JAIME SMITH PAUL DAVIES BEST OF 1997 Seeing Nintendo come back from intensive care at the end of the year made my heart glad. Space World '97 is an EDITOR event l'll never forget — CURRENT FAV GAMES: incredible excitement.  GOLDENEYE The success of Final  POCKET MONSTER GB  F-ZERO X Fantasy VII in the UK  ZELDA 64  DIDDY KONG RACING restored my faith in the power of great games. First look at Tekken 3 just before Christmas! TOM GUISE BEST OF 1997 Sega proving they're still top in the arcades with House Of The Dead (best gun game ever), Scud DEP EDITOR Race and The Lost CURRENT FAV GAMES: World. Time Crisis  QUAKE 2 and Point Blank  BURNING RANGERS  LOST WORLD COIN-OP coming to PlayStation RIDGE RACER REVO. with a Namco gun.  BLOODY ROAR PaRappa getting a UK release. The explosion of Quakeworld! Dungeon Keeper. Quake 2 arriving, BEST OF 1997 1997 was a good year for games. My favourites being, (not in order) Streetfighter 3, Streetfighter Ex plus Alpha, Starfox 64, PaRappa the ART EDITOR Rapper, House of the Dead. CURRENT FAV GAMES: Top Skater, Streetfighter  MAC QUAKE Collection, Mac Quake, Namco SF3 2ND IMPACT  STEEP SLOPE SLIDERS Museums, Micro Machines,  SF ALPHA 2 Rainbow Islands, Goldeneye,  GAMEBOY TETRIS Rage Racer to name but a few It was also good to see the Playstation do so well. and restore faith in the video games market. WORST OF 1997 The delay of Quake 2. The delay of Yoshi's Story. The delay of Zelda 64. The delay of FZero X... DELAYS! Watching the Saturn slowly fade away, despite having some awesome games launched, and more on the way. Watching Nintendo let Sony wipe the floor with them in Japan. WORST OF 1997 The horrific spawning of Mario 64 clones, like and Croc and Gex 2. Sega passing top arcade conversions onto lesser teams. Project Sonic failing to produce the Sonic game I want. Mariokart 64 proving to be a turkey. No sign of a home conversion of Virtua Fighter 3. My PlayStation exploding, WORST OF 1997 Waiting for decent N64 games to come out, and then to find out that they're pretty naff. Seeing too many sequels (Streetfighter not included). Seeing Saturn going down the toilet. No release of M2. No release, of SF Alpha 3. SF3 being a bit disappointing, HOPES FOR 1998 For videogames to become 100% fun again. lose the pretentious rubbish. For people to buy a games machine because of the games it offers, not for the image. Then we'd have a great market in the UK. Sega to unveil their new machine. Nintendo to keep their promise about N64DD (actually release the thing!). Nintendo to get Pocket Monster over here before Christmas 1998. HOPES FOR 1998 Sega to release an awesome new console, at a reasonable price, backward compatible with Saturn, uses Saturn pads (and thus the excellent Virtua Gun), with launch games being Sonic, VF3, Scud Race and The Lost World. Most of all though, for it to be internet compatible and bring multiplayer Quake 2 to the masses. Come on Sega!! HOPES FOR 1998 I want Nintendo to finally release the games they said they would release last year, ie: Zelda, F-Zero X (please!) and to be good and the DD to be a success. The new Sega machine to come out and be brilliant. I want a decent TV games show, and better conversions of import games, and I want a Streetfighter Ex game on Model 3. Oh yeah! I want cheaper N64 games (-), more budget games and the new machine by Jeff Minter to be 256 bit and be called Jaguar 2 (with 4096 colours on Screen). STEVE KEY ALEX HUHTALA TONY CORMACK BEST OF 1997 For me it would have to SENIOR STAFF WRITER be the CURRENT FAV GAMES: rebirth  ISS 64 of the  QUAKE 2  DIDDY KONG RACING N64. It  X-MEN VS SF  ACTUA SOCCER 2 now houses one of my all-time favourite games, in ISS 64, the awesome Goldeneye and Diddy Kong. Starring in the TV ad is also something I'll never forget. And I would also like to congratulate Sony for having their heads screwed on. Without them, this Industry would be dead. ED LOMAS BEST OF 1997 Quake, WipEout 2097 and NIGHTS, even though they all came out in SENIOR WRITER 1996. I've CURRENT FAV GAMES: played these  QUAKE 2 three games  X-MEN VS SF  QUAKE more this year  STEEP SLOPE SLIDERS than practically  WIPEOUT 2097 anything else. It's also good that the popularity of the PlayStation has helped genuinely great games sell well even though they're not the usual sort of thing that does well — Abe's Oddysee, TOCA Touring Car, Final Fantasy VII, and so on. And arcades have become cool again thanks to Sega, and Namco. BEST OF 1997 In no particular order: Final Fantasy VII, Grand Theft STAFF WRITER Auto, TR2. CURRENT FAV GAMES: Goldeneye, QUAKE Tamagotchi, TOMB RAIDER 2 GRAND THEFT AUTO MMV3, Diddy  FINAL FANTASY VII Kong Racing,  DIDDY KONG RACING Top Skater, Actua Soccer 2, House of the Dead, Castlevania, Interstate '76. ISS 64. Sat Bomberman, PaRappa, Time Crisis, Monkey Island 3, Dead or Alive, Rage Racer and Quake 2. It's been a brilliant year for games, because this is just the tip of the iceberg. Now if only I could find some time to play them all! BEST OF 1997 Gamewise Top Skater has defi nitely got to SLAVE be my best CURRENT FAV GAMES: of '97.  MAC QUAKE WOW what  WIPEOUT 2097  ACTUA SOCCER 2 a totally  COOL BOARDERS 2  STEEP SLOPE SLIDERS AWESOME arcade game. So good I wish I could afford to own it, now that would be awesome. Personal fave cool games of '97 include PaRappa the Rapper, Actua Soccer 2, V-Rally, Dead or Alive, Final Fantasy VII, Diddy Kong Racing, and again TOP SKATER. NICE. 1998: THE YEAR CVG CONQUERS THE WORLD! WORST OF 1997 Seeing Everton go from bad to embarrasing to the point of losing to Spurs. The continuing decline of the Saturn too, which is still a damn good machine. And finally the public for still buying the brand name games like FIFA, regardless of how good they are. WORST OF 1997 Another terrible FIFA game getting to number one again. Why don't people, wake up and stop buying them?! Games companies rushing out rubbish PlayStation and Nintendo 64 games just to cash in on the boom in sales. Saturn games disappearing off release schedules. Sega UK. Fantastic Four. Iron Man X/0 Manowar in Heavy Metal. Mortal Kombat Mythologies. WORST OF 1997 Nintendo and their slow start to the year, and THE Games for messing about with the price of the N64 so much, upsetting a lot of people in the process. Rival magazines who don't review games properly and rate inferior products so highly. Sega becoming an underground guerilla movement, who sneak their games into shops without telling anyone about it. WORST OF 1997 Got dumped by my girlfriend but we're still mates HOOORAHHH! Otherwise a totally ace year, apart from being a Spurs fan that is! Well at least we stuffed Everton, so we're not the worst team in the Premiership then. The further demise of Sega. Great machine NO FUTURE. What next, hey? HOPES FOR 1998 To go to the World Cup and see England go all the way. Nothing would make my year more. Resident Evil 2 and Tekken 3 to get awesome British conversions. And the price of beer to come down enough so that I can get really drunk on . EDITORIAL HOPES FOR 1998 Sega's new machine to have a good start. A new Sonic game (like the Mega Drive ones), another NIGHTS game, Colin McCrae Rally from Code Masters to be really good, Street Fighter 3 and Vampire Savior from Capcom to be good on the Saturn, a good game featuring time travel, and I want even more people, to realise how much fun games are. And finally, for Pink Floyd to release a new album and go on tour. Mega! HOPES FOR 1998 Tekken 3 to totally kick ass on the Playstation and someone to develop a great console skateboarding game. Come on everyone, surely it's time. N64 to keep in the fight with Sony healthy competition is the only way forward for any growing market! Hopefully I'll become the best snowboarder in the world and as a consequence never have to do a real job again. England for France '98. Loads more cool skate trainers, maybe even a national ban on the wearing of proper shoes! HOPES FOR 1998 Sega to make games for the PlayStation, until their new console is out. That way they can win over some admirers. When the console is released it should be no more than , and have some major advertising to let everyone know about it. More original games, and England to win the World Cup three-two versus Germany, with David Seaman scoring the winner with an amazing goal kick! "

"CVG PUTS FORWARD A HUMAN GUINEPIG TO TEST «EVIL\" FOOTAGE! computer Video games PSYGNOSIS AND JAPANESE PATENT CORE CONFIRMED VICTORY FOR SEGA FOR NINTENDO 64 W e wanted to know exactly what all the fuss was about so we got our Japanese Correspondent, Warren Harrod, to watch the reputedly dangerous Pocket Monster cartoon episode. The episode sees the heroes trapped inside a computer world having been digitised by a crazy professor who put them in there to battle villians who were stealing Pocket Monsters from inside the computer. He gives them a special man-made creature called a Polygon Pocket Monster to help them, but the computer thinks they are a virus and so tries to elimate them. When the anti-virus software attacks the heroes who are flying around on the Polygon Pocket Monster the explosions use a special anime effect to make it look a little different from normal a digital explosion effect. In order to do this they changed the light of the explosion between red and blue very quickly which created a flickering effect. This flashing light is considered to be the cause of all the illnesses that occurred. Those people (suffering from slight photosensitive epilepsy without even knowing) who stare at this light (young children are particulary vulnerable) at close range for too long are susceptable to the previous mentioned convulsions, spasms and seizures! This is the first recorded happening of this kind of incident in Japan although several years ago a similiar panic occured in England when tabloid press claimed that the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was responsible for causing similiar effects. op Nintendo Producer, Shigeru Miyamoto, has confirmed Psygnosis and Core as developers for Nintendo 64. During a recent interview with the Official Nintendo Magazine, also attended by CVG, Miyamoto said, \"now Psygnosis have started working with Nintendo and Core Design, the cre ators of Tomb Raider, have also start ed work on the N64 as well. I'm really looking forward to their software.\" Psygnosis, publishers of WipEout, and Core, who developed Tomb Raider 2 for Sony, are so far unable to announce details of their N64 projects. We'll leave the specula tion to you at this stage. ega have finally had a patent application approved on some common bits of 3D video game technology. They now have a Japanese patent (it doesn't apply to games made anywhere else in the world) on the technology that allows a player to move the 3D camera angles around in a game. This means that their common «VR Buttons\" the four view change buttons on games such as Virtua Racing and Daytona USA can't be used by other companies without paying Sega loads of money. They now stand to make millions of pounds by getting royalties from major developers who have used this patented technology. The patent application took almost five years to be approved, and came as a surprise to some people. Atari had a similar application refused when they tried to patent sideways scrolling in a video game. Poor old Atari.

It's a racing game which is said to capture all the thrill and excitement of the American Dream, letting you race a massive Harley-Davidson around the streets of LA. Sega's fantastic Model 3 arcade system is used to create incredible 3D graphics, with an entire city for you to roam at will. In a similar way to Konami's GTI Club Rally you can travel anywhere in the city you want, as long as you pass through the checkpoints within the time limit. There are five different Harleys from which to choose, including the FXRP Police Motorcycle and the FLSTF Fat Boy, all with their own distinctive sampled engine noise and handling characteristics. The bikes all use both front and rear brakes and even have a music select button in case you're not too keen on your current tune. Plus up to four machines can be linked together so that you and your greasy mates can all race at once! Expect Harley-Davidson & LA Riders to be released around the UK in the Spring. EASD SRAGE Harley-Davidson & LA Riders Even the machine itself is looks excellent! You can race anyimpressive. The enormous bike where you want in the city. makes a brilliant load of noise!

AM4 (the division which designs and builds all of Sega's arcade cabinets) have created a machine which fights against you exactly as a real fish would. The giant 50 inch screen makes the fish look completely realistic, and the rod moves differently depending on the size and type of fish you catch!. The idea is to catch a specified weight of bass before the time limit runs out. If you do, you move onto the next stage. The first three stages you can choose around set around Lake Paradise the Lodge, Cape and Inlet. Once these are completed... well, you'll have to wait and see! 6000 g want to play Get Bass in the arcade you should dress up like the guy here. 10 "

No name, no definite characters, no gameplay details. We DO know that it's running on Namco's System 12 arcade board (the same one as Tekken 3) and it moves at 60 frames per second (very smooth indeed). As you can tell it looks very similar to Namco's Soul Edge. A sequel maybe? The reason for Namco not revealing anything else is that they are running a competition in Japan for gamers to come up with ideas. The winners get their suggestions in the game as well as special Namco jackets and CG images signed by the game's developers. But don't feel left out Namco of Japan have specially requested that the readers of CVG have their say! You, yes YOU could have your ideas in what is potentially the best fighting game ever!

Comet have joined the swelling ranks to provide you with an awesome prize every month, so get scribbling. By the way, we edit most of your letters if they don't make sense, but occasionally some will be left as they are, for reasons that are obvious if you read them. Just so you know. practically no impact on the gaming world? You are becoming a pathetic, teenager magazine. This month you talk to Louise about cooking and her boyfriend, and waste six pages doing so. Sorry, there may be something about games in there, but I can't be arsed to find out. Parappa doesn't count as a game, you said it yourself. Last month, lets waste the front cover and 4 pages talking about a game that we have NOTHING ABOUT. Yep, the Spice Girls. OK, what next month? Who cares. Its just a cheap ploy to make teenage boys see your mag and say 'girl contentschwing' and buy it. Great. It may surprise you that someone buys your mag for games coverage. SHOCK! What's next for CVG? Change its name to FHM? Who knows. Maybe, just maybe, they will get back to what they once considered the main issue of the mag: games. JedahTJedi via E-Mail.

Dear CVG, If you have any spare copies of Parappa the Rapper or any of those cool Parappa hats Louise was wearing in the Christmas Editorial, feel free to send me one. Nicholas Andrews, Stoke-on-Trent. WIN A CONSOLE AND FIVE GAMES WITH Dear CVG, When I went down to my newsagents to get my hands on the latest issue (192) of my favourite mag, 1 was shocked! On the cover there were five fat, ugly, disgraceful, bad looking so-called babes. Do you know what I mean? How can someone ever put the \"Playback\" girls on our beloved mag? I hope this won't happen again, but don't worry, I'll still buy the next issue. John Roeberg, Norway. Dear CVG, First of all, I have to say that CVG is an excellent magazine, the way you talk about games, introducing it, especially Mailbag because it show what people are interested etc. The reason I am writing this letter is because I am fans of Louise and so I wonder if you could send me some of the photo that was taken during the review by Louise in issues 193 about a game called Parappa the Rapper on the playstation thank you! I am sorry for any inconvenient but hopping to hear from you soon thank you!!!! Mr K K Wan, Macclesfield. Dear CVG, As I was settling down with my copy of CVG, reading Ed Lomas' excellent opinions on reviewing games and the excellent Freeplay section, I noticed that the CVG team look like certain pop stars and actors. Paul Davies = John Travolta (according to my mum) Alex Huhtala = Paul Whitehouse Steve Key = Roger Taylor (Queen) Tom Guise = Elton John Ed Lomas = Brian May (Queen) Jaime Smith = Freddie Mercury (Queen) Mathew Ballmen, Castleford. Dear CVG, I couple of weeks ago, sent you a letter complaining about the cover (Spice Girls). But this time I'm writing to thank you for putting Louise on the cover. She's gorgeous isn't she? Well, thanks CVG! Keep up the good work! John Roeberg, Norway. CVG: As we speak, the CVG Queen tribute band is forming and you can expect news of the tour soon. Look out for the special guest appearance from Elton and stand-up from Paul Whitehouse. Oh and Tony Cormack making a supporting role as Worzel Gummidge. Dear CVG Well I am reading through my new CVG and I get to page 16 and to my surprise (yes I did look at the front cover) I saw the biggest load of b******s I have ever seen. I thought this was CVG, Computer and Video Games not a f****** teen mag. You are supposed to talk about games, not where Louise went to school and what she thinks of Parappa the Rapper. What's next? Danny La Rue on what he thinks of Ace Combat 22 and can he play it better dressed up as a woman? I have recently been buying your mag as it's usually very good, but I didn't buy the one with the Spice Girls on it, because it was the crappest issue in a long time. And this one follows suit. Please get back into shape as you're our only hope of a decent mag. Garth Coleman via E-Mail. MARVEL AT MY KNOWLEDGE Hi there CVG Guys! Thanks for the recent #193 December '97 issue, which I've only just received. Your cover story on Louise, pfworr, hubbidaa, hubbidaa! Any chance of some signed piccies of her to keep our wilting spirits high, or even higher, in case Saddam throws a wobbly? Baz.T-Y. Song, The Sickbay, H.M.S. Invincible. Dear CVG, I can guarantee you will not read much into this but here goes: CRAP. That sums up CVG in one word. What the hell has happened? CVG used to be the God of magazines, but not now. You have tried to change attitude and become pathetic in the process. I'm not even sure you are a games mag anymore. Where is the logic in a games mag dedicating a mere quarter of a page to one of the best PC games around in Jedi Knight, and SIX BLOODY pages to an interview that has Dear CVG, First, I'm sorry. I know you asked for cheery letters but I do have a rather pitiful complaint against God's own magazine, CVG. In issue #193 you reviewed Marvel Super Heroes and there was a section entitled \"Richards! Curse you Richards!\" in which you asked the question \"Where are the Fantastic Four?\". You then stated that : Blackheart and Shuma Gorath should not have been in the game as they were nobodies from the Marvel Universe. Here is my problem. Capcom needed more villain characters so in came Shuma Gorath and Blackheart. I agree that they could have chosen better characDear CVG, Your issue #193 was top notch. I especially liked the cover (Louise, sha-wing!). The Christmas buyers guide was absolutely brill as well. My Santy list is finally complete. Whatever yee do at CVG, keep it up. It's great. Darren O'Sullivan, Co.Cork, Ireland. "


"has been planned for. Do you think I'm right because I do. Ashley Longhurst, Harlow. computer video games COMET STAR LETER CVG: Not only is this a stupid idea, but it's one that is virtually impossible to carry out. For a start, sometimes a games company doesn't even know if a sequel is coming out. They may have plans for one, but nothing concrete will have been decided. Secondly, that is what we're here for. If you bought the first game, and are thinking about getting the follow-up, check our reviews. We'll tell you if it's worth getting. Easy. SHIVER ME TIMBERS Dear CVG, I am writing regarding the Louise cover story which happened to waste a good six pages of what I consider to be the best multi-format games magazine on the market. Those pages happened to be the crappest and most obvious attempt at plugging a pop star I've ever read. Your reason for putting Louise on the cover was a weak one and the link with Parappa a cynical one. Some readers may have seen the feature as a good way to branch into a mainstream market by getting a good looking pop star who knows as much about video games as my gran (and she's dead), to talk a load of boring crap about nothing in particular. Thinking about it, I really do care if Louise thought about doing kickboxing, and I am extremely interested in stinking school she attended when she was younger, not to mention the numerous jobs she had before she was famous. What a thrilling read! I believe the CVG reader to be more discerning and not taken in by the pop sensation, but maybe I'm wrong. So please don;t sell out and turn CVG into a general interest magazine for the masses. Dear CVG, I think Waterhouse in issue 193 is an idiot. I mean piracy is a bad idea anyway, but the nearest I'm gonna get to a pirate game is Overboard. Dean Robinson, Brentwood. OC CVG: We had many responses to Simon Waterhouse's letter and thankfully, they were all against piracy. Good to see you know what's best. ARRGHH! PARENT GAMERS David McRitchie, Peterborough. ters such as Venom, Sabretooth etc. but I strongly disagree that Blackheart is a nobody. As any true Marvel fan would know, Blackheart is the son of Marvel's very own Beelzebub, Mephisto, who is now dead. I must admit however that I do not have the faintest idea who the hell Shuma Gorath is If any readers know, can they write in and tell me please. Andrew Fox, Sidcup. Dear CVG, I was playing on my game Croc and was doing very well so I saved it. Then, I packed up to watch TV for half and hour. When I came back, my mum was playing Tekken 2 but not like any mother. She was playing it like an expert who had played the game many times before. Since then my life has changed. My mum is always doing flips around the house and she is always playing Tekken 2. Now I never get to my PlayStation when I come home from school. You're lucky it hasn't happened to you but I'm going to give you a piece of advice: Never let your parents near your PlayStation otherwise they'll never get off it, and you'll have to resort to packing it away or hiding it to stop them getting addicted. Richard 'Tekken Croc' Dowe. AND FIVE GAMES WITH WIN A CONSOLE TOM: The game is called Marvel Super Heroes, not Villains, and you shoot your argument in the foot by instantly coming up with two better choices of bad guy. As for Blackheart being Mephisto's son, so what? He's still a two-bit rubbish character who has even been beaten by Daredevil. So shut up. CVG: We suspect that this letter has nothing to do with the fact that your mum is a bit warm at Tekken, but more like she kicks your butt when you play her. Think of the shame, being beaten by your mum... THE JAMES SCUTCHER BACKLASH! STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSES ARSE Dear CVG Firstly, your mag is great and I get it every month. But in Issue #193 I read James Scutcher's letter and it was quite funny. I then read on and found the Sonic cheat. Well, last night I was reading a dead old mag and it had this Sonic cheat in! I think that he has read this mag and copied the cheat, because I had never heard of or seen this cheat before. Plus, I doubt it had been in any other mag before. Simon Robertson, Manchester. Dear CVG, I'll make this short and sweet. Spice Girls are crap. Yes crap. Why bring out a Spice Girls game? THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD WITH THE CRAP THEY PLAY! P.S. Want to send me a signed poster of them anyway? And Lara Croft for my mate. Alan Ross, Ayrshire. in CVG: This is literally one out of the hundreds of letters we received on this subject and every one said the same thing. The letter was a sarcastic dig and we thought it was funny, so we gave him a game. It doesn't mean that you'll win a game for sending in cheats for old games, so please STOP! We thought you lot were smarter than that. COMET AND FIVE GAMES WITH COMET CAFE ME LETTERS CVG: We found this letter after we cleared the huge pile of Lara Croft and Spice Girls posters off our desks and burnt them. Never mind. DESPERATE FOR WOMEN? ME? NO WAY! Dear All you ker-azy lads at CVG, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Sonic Team I LOVE YOU ALL! Toot toot Burning Rangers! Will Curley Dear CVG, Will the zany Steve Key Sega ad be coming overseas? I really want to see it. John Magus' Petropoulos. Dear CVG, I own an N64 and at the moment I am very pleased with it. But, think developers for N64 should take notice that all the people who have N64s are not all little kids who are about eight years old. I mean, in adverts, Nintendo use the cover of the d*** game, while Sony use Jo Guest in nothing but a T-Shirt. The older player is more likely to buy the Sony product aren't they? And the PlayStation has games like Tomb Raider 2 with sex appeal. Lara Croft is now a cult, but why? Because she's sexy of course! I do not own a PlayStation so I'm not moaning at all, but I think I have a d*** good point. Thank you. DA, Mossley CVG: No. Thank God. Dear CVG, There are some silly people out there. An Oasis computer game would be cack. I think Marylin Manson would make a good game. CVG: What on earth does 'd*** stand for? Damn? Ohhh nasty words. Dear CVG, Please feel free to trim down this letter in ord... Neil Hughes. Carmartenshire. GIVE US A WARNING PLEASE Dear CVG. I bought Command & Conquer a few months ago and I didn't know that the sequel Red Alert was coming out. I think games should have a warning on them telling you if and when a sequel is coming out, or even magazines (preferably CVG) having a column which has a list of games that a sequel Dear CVG, When Sega's next console comes out, imagine the names of the magazines dedicated to it. Dural Power, Official UK Dural Magazine and Dural Pro. Arf arf. Craig Smith, Malvern "

MARIO ARTIST SERIES TALENT MAKER The first step is to get O . O .O The inventor of Mario, Shigeru Miyamoto, loves creating games so much that he's found a way for everyone to share in his experience. Miyamoto's Mario Artist series will eventually comprise of five installments. It allows for you to create pictures, build 3D models of absolutely anything you like, animate small CG movies, and compose music. The best part is that you can then mix and match different aspects of each package until you have a 100% custom-built routine running on your Nintendo. You can even glue your own face onto the head of someone, or any object for that matter. Unfortunately we're unable to tell you about the music making installment (Sound Maker), as it hasn't been fully developed yet. The fifth is secret. However the other components were up and running at Space World '97, allowing CVG to wonder at the possibilities.

"COD POLYGON MAKER computer Video games G GOOD LeLa NINTENDO Perhaps the most 'grown up of the Mario Artist series. Polygon Maker is co-developed by Nintendo and Nichimen graphics. Nichimen helped Nintendo develop the great models used In Mario 64, now they're helping you create something cool. On the face of it, and certainly compared to the rest of the Mario Artist series, Polygon Maker is pretty dry. However it may prove to be the most involving of all, especially with the likelihood that your 3D character will one day take place in a 64DD game (don't suppose Nintendo haven't already thought of the idea -'create your enemy' type scenario!). Whatever its used for, every model you create can be saved onto disc among many others. PICTURE MAKER This is similar to Mario Paint on the Super NES. Of course the technology is much better, so allows for you and three friends to scribble simultaneously. Great fun if you're really young, then. (100% 2000 DR Older users are more likely to be impressed with the animation package. There is a 2D Movie Mode, almost identical to Mario Paint, and a more impressive 3D Movie Mode. Looks as though the project originally called Creator (from Software Creations) has been absorbed by Picture Maker to form the basis of 3D Movie Modé. Regular readers are sure to remember seeing these dinosaurs from our Space World report in 1995. It seems that you have full control over detailed 3D worlds and the 3D models placed within them.

Sample models from Nintendo 64 games are available as part of the library. When you see how complex some of the characters are, you'll want to try harder at N-Geometry.

Sim City 64 is designed to capitalise on the 64DD's ability to copy over game information from one disc to another. It is a dressed up, fun-packed interpretation of the original PC game from Maxis. The best example of this use so solid and convincing than the PC far is the adaptation of Sim Copter, original. Nintendo are including a also from Maxis. For those of you higher quota of exciting incidents, who don't know about Sim Copter, with much more humour. this was originally designed for use The limits for this particular title in conjunction with Sim City 2000 on would seem to be pretty much endPC.

Basically this is the very welcome return of the totally hilarious, brilliantly cute Mario of NES fame complete with basic animation and 180 flip turns (about face in the blink of an eye!). He's \"painted' slightly better of course, and he has a few more actions than before for non-platform activities. But basic moving around is classic Mario.

"compute vided game    NINTEND Music plays an important part in making the mother series cool. Let's party! Somebody save this poor guy from the jaws of this two-headed beast. Most characters have something witty to say in the Mother games. 1998 TBC MOTHE Here's a new truth assured to upset some people. It already upset Paul Davies. Mother 3 is the best-looking RPG ever, many times more impressive than Final Fantasy VII. In one incredible scene, which we presume is taken from a 'movie' style sequence, a procession takes place though the desert. Huge hulking beasts, surrounded by complex vehicles, churn up the dust against a blistering sun. This scene has a majesty like no other, laced with the bizarre humour associated with the mother series. Likewise impressive, and equally oddball is a dramatic scene where some poor bloke is being eaten by a two-headed dinosaur. Village/town scenes look crisp and colourful, and are impressive because the entire location is presented realtime game characters aren't dashing about a custom snapshot of complex polygon-rendered areas. Only a few UK readers will have played and enjoyed Mother 2, which was released as Earthbound in the US. When there is more to show on Mother 3 we'll go into detail comparing the two adventures. Rest assured that there are many similarities, and all the nice touches that make Earthbound so cool are enhanced in Mother 3 (Earthbound 2). For one example, the battles are still carried out against a swirling, psychedelic backdrop to freaked out techno. And these battles are preceded by a chase around the landscape, either in pursuit or in fear of the enemy. The video showed a briefly hilarious challenge between the hero and a kind of wild boar. We've saved the most surprising info on Mother 3 until last: Using the Capture Cartridge you can capture, then glue your face onto one of the heroes in the game. In fact you can build a whole party of characters who wear the faces of your friends. It's not certain yet whether similar custom treatment is available for the enemy, but we live in hope! We don't know for sure, but it's likely that scenes like these can be rotated and zoomed to the player's taste. NINTENDO 64 DD SOFTWARE LINE-UP 196  JUPE Your first look at one of the far-out battle scenes. Yippee! DERBY STALLION CABBAGE The PlayStation game is a million-seller in Japan. It's only a matter of time before a major UK publisher takes a chance with a horse racing title and wins big time! Like Pocket Monster Stadium, which you can read about on page 26, Derby Stallion uses the special N64 GB pak, allowing you to train your horses on Game Boy while on the move, then upload the information later. Even take your thoroughbred to a friends house for a race. Together with Pocket Monster Nintendo stand a good chance of owning the Japanese games market this time next year. Cabbage! Everything about this 'game' seems far fetched and too good to be true. But Nintendo proved themselves with such an amazing show, it's better to just believe them from now on. Cabbage borrows from the theme of the virtual pet, and takes it beyond anything previously imagined. The good thing for Nintendo is that the concept of Cabbage cannot be realised on any other games system. It requires the versatility of 64DD for it to happen at all. Cabbage is the work of Shigesato Itoi who is also the producer of Mother 3. When you read how clever this is, it makes you wonder just how incredible Mother 3 will be. What happens is this: You create a virtual life which exists inside the N64DD. Kind of like Tamagotchi, but much more complex. Perhaps not quite so complex as Millenium's Creatures, but this has yet to be confirmed. You can nurture this life, same as you would any other living thing, by providing nourishment and activities. From here on it gets incredible. See if you can believe this: Nintendo plan to install virtual supermarkets in convenience stores for you to purchase acces sories for Cabbage to use. Like, you may want Cabbage to have something to play with, so you take your 64DD disc down to the 7-11 and download, say, a bike for a small fee (couple of quid probably). Nintendo also plan for events to be available from the virtual supermarket-adventures for the Cabbage character to complete, perhaps. Best of all, the Cabbage character can be let out of its virtual surroundings and potentially visit a world created by somebody else on their N64DD! But definitely Nintendo have plans for the Cabbage character to enjoy day trips with you, after being downloaded into your Game Boy! How so? Well, you're about to find out over the next few pages, at the end of which is something almost equal in stature to Cabbage already. Turn the page! Discover how Nintendo have revived Game Boy to the extent where it's likely to become the coolest thing on the planet more essential than ever!

"computer Video games INTENDO 64 THE POCKET I MONSTER STORY POCKET MONSTER: THE JAPANESE POCKET MONSTER: THE JAPANESE CRAZE! Even bigger that Final Fantasy VII or Tamagotchi, Pocket Monster is consuming all of Japan with its addictive qualities. Now Nintendo have announced it for the West! POCKEMON GET UP AND FIGHT! Pocket Monster has sold over five million copies on Game Boy. The toy figures have sold over seven million packs. You can buy Pocket Monster books, magazines, clothes, snacks, toys, CDs or videos in every shop in Japan. Pocket Monster has a weekly cartoon series and a movie planned for next year. Nintendo have re-thought their marketing strategy behind the N64 to incorporate this game. Rival companies are lining up to make look-a-like clones, and game analysts are writing hundreds of pages about Pocket Monster in all the gaming magazines. Now it's your chance to discover how a single Game Boy game revolutionised the gaming industry in Japan. What's so interesting about a bunch of monsters? Two influential TV programs are in on the game too '64 Mario Stadium' has a special Pocket Monster League section, where teams battle each other while an editor from a Japanese Nintendo magazine comments on their performance by giving advice and fighting tactics. 'OHASUTA', The Super Kids Station, reveals the latest toy and game ranking charts, providing daily Pockemon news using a trendy fashion image approach! POCKEMON PERSONALITY HOT GAMES FOR 98 The aim of Pocket Monster is to collect 150 types of Pocket Monster, or 'Pockemon' to be cool. Besides this being the basic plot of the game, there are other important reasons. Pocket Monsters are categorised into various kinds Fire, Water, Plant, etc. In battle, each one one has it's own strengths and weaknesses so it's important to collect as many Pocket Monsters as possible in order to use the appropriate Pockemon against your rival. However unless you use the Communication Cable to trade Pocket Monsters with your friends, it's impossible to get them all! You see there are currently three versions of Pocket Monster. Red, Green and Blue. The content of each game is much the same, however the chance that any given Pocket Monster will appear differs for each version. You can't collect all the Pocket Monsters with one version, you HAVE TO trade with someone who has a different version. That's not only the only reason to trade. A monster that's been traded will grow up faster, learn new attacks, and can evolve into a more powerful Pocket Monster. So, the more you trade the better your collection of Pocket Monsters. In addition, you can give them individual names which they keep even if you swap them with a friend, so there's always the possibility that you might meet them again. Designing the game so that the players wanted to trade it, meant that interest in the game spread like wildfire among friends. A major part of the game's attraction is that each Pocket Monster has it's own distinct personality. The cool looking dragon, Lizardo, the cuddly and cute Pikachu, and the sinister Myu are just three of the many popular Pocket Monsters in the game. Each has its own unique fascination. If they didn't it's unlikely that anyone would want to collect them. Inside the game you can view your Pocket Monsters using an electronic picture book which not only displays its picture, but also explains things about each monster including it's height, weight, and special characteristics. It even reproduces its voice even more reason to collect as many as possible! g Screen As with all popular anime in Japan the next stage is to jump to the big screen, and so not surprisingly it's just been announced that summer '98 will see the release of Pocket Monster: The Movie! \"Mew Two Strikes Back\". Featuring all of the main characters from the weekly Pockemon anime series this is set to be one of the biggest anime block buster movies of all time in Japan and thus can only further prolong interest in the game. 22 "

Pocket Game Boy game These critical factors have played a vital role in Pockemon's success so far: Koro Koro Comic IKA-357 NINTEN The leading monthly magazine for kids in Japan specialises in Tie-Ups between product manufacturers and TV anime. Many of the cartoon strips are based on famous characters or latest toys. In March of 1996, Koro Koro Comic offered 20 readers the chance to win a special new Pocket Monster called \"Myu\". 78,000 people responded! When they held an offer to buy the limited edition Blue version of Pocket Monster, 611,000 people ordered it! This was exceptional good timing as it maintained everyone's interest in Pocket Monster until the Pocket Game Boy was released! Nintendo amazed the world when they launched Pocket Game Boy. It's smaller size was critical to its success because it made Pocket Monster even more portable than before. Not surprisingly Pocket Game Boy had massive sales. With a lack of available software most people had little choice other than to choose the game at the top of the Game Boy game rankingsPocket Monster. GAME BOY TV Anime Character Goods This turned the simple Game Boy graphics into full colour animation. The quality of the Pockemon anime is very high both in terms of production and design. It captures the spirit of the game perfectly. In turn this has introduced the appeal of the game to a whole new audience girls! Pikachu alone is enough for most girls to fall in love with the series. Having reached the level of attaining its own TV series, Pocket Monster had earned itself a shot at the big time. A top animation series has an incredible influence on kids in Japan. If it becomes popular there's no limit to the number of toy, book, food and clothing manufacturers who want to licence it. For these people, Pockemon was perfect 150 monsters for exploitation! SELECT SUNT POCKET MONSTER: THE JAPANESE CRAZE! Toys For those still who can't afford the game there are loads of Pockemon toy alternatives. All the top toys are really cheap, but there are lots to collect. The idea is to swap duplicates with your friends, which is the same basic principle that the computer game is based on. There are much more expensive toys, of course, such as the Pockemon board game, which were in major demand over Christmas. UK POCKEMON CAMPAIGN GO! The amazing thing about Pockemon is not so much the two player battles, but the trading. Though video games have built an image of people playing alone, Pocket Monster has brought games to the streets. Trust CVG: Pocket Monster will be one of the greatest games you've ever played. We'll be back with more, Pockemon coverage soon! Hundreds of Pockemon goods are available, from the ultra-popular Pockemon Trading Cards, to a life sized cuddly Pikachu.

DIST his is Nintendo's first game to feature the Audio Recognition System, developed by a team called Ambrella, at a company called Marigal Management, for Nintendo Game Freak. If 'Pikachu...' is a fair representation of the technology at hand, we're looking at the beginning of something incredible in video games. \"A game where you have conversations with Pikachu; play and think with him; try to get his heart.

If he's doing something wrong usually chasing butterflies when he should be paying attention you can order him to behave. If you want to get him really fired up just shout \"get up and fight!\", and Pikachu jumps up and punches the air with his fist, then lands and makes the victory sign. COOL! Eventually the aim is to teach Pikachu good manners (ie. to say grace before eating), and to have fun all by himself. Although hopefully he'll still want you around. The more time you spend with Pikachu, the more dedicated he becomes. To an extent where he will not immediately respond to a stranger's instructions, even though he might understand what they're saying. Finally, don't expect the entire game to take place in Tokiwa forest. This was just for demonstration purposes. In the finished game, Nintendo/Game Freak plan for Pikachu to meet with other Pocket Monsters. He may have the choice to make friends or fight. This strongly suggests that there will be a fair amount of adventuring to do, as results were pure magic.

The tactical exchanges keep an audience of millions occupied for ten minutes or so. It sounds dumb, but you should see it it's gripping stuff! This is why the news of such battles being made possible on Nintendo 64 is so exciting. But the phenomenon that is Pocket Monster Stadium goes one incredible stage further. The excitement surrounding Pockemon Stadium in Japan (and soon the rest of the world, don't you forget!), is that the data stored on the Game Boy Pocket Monster provides the data for the N64 game! A genius new N64 adaptor the 64GB Pak fits into the N64 controller, same way as the Rumble Pak. Your Game Boy version of Pocket Monster slots into the 64GB Pak, transferring all your hard-earned monster data into the N64DD! Up to four people can upload Pockemon data into the N64DD at one time.

The N64DD translates the basic Pockemon information into N64 reference material, which allows for some surprising results. A basic addition is an icon tagged next to the names of monsters which you tried to capture but failed. Useful. However it is the in-game improvements you most need to know about. The N64 modifications start simple enough, like watching your Pockemon practice its repertoire of killer moves. It gets more interesting once you get to hear them SCREAM and ROAR (instead of bleeping' and 'distorted bleeping'!). But you almost mess your pants when you see how even the same variety of Pocket Monster appears to be different to your mate's on-screen. The data is so sensitive, it is able to describe differences according to how the monster has been raised! By the way, this next piece of news could have some readers passing out. So, sorry about that. Okay, we're into the stadium! A new type of Pockemon competition is possible here: four-player tag-team battles! While two professional trainers battle it out, another two opponents observe in the sidelines, waiting for their chance to capitalise on the others' mistakes. Aargh the tension!

Navi also offers advice in some situations usually battle tactics. The command button (B) enables him to climb, ladders, jump onto ledges, crawl beneath ledges, open chests, read signs, or talk to people. When he's in water, the command button allows Link to swim.

As soon as you use the 3D stick to gaze at the roof of the cave, Goma makes a move. To defeat Goma, first fire an arrow, or throw Link's boomerang into its eye. This stuns him. From here Link must quickly run over to the disoriented hulk and strike with his sword. Goma's also drops eggs from an alien-like delivery tube. It's disgusting!

To make the bomb travel higher and further, Link needs a run up. And he isn't given much time! The bomb explodes inside Dodongo's stomach. Like Goma, it gets concussed for a short time, which is Link's chance to use his sword. He needs to be quick to create distance again, because Dodongo's first reaction after waking up again is to curl up into a giant ball and roll around the perimeter of the lava pit.

This is a 2D (flat!) platform game, whose action takes place against many astonishing backdrops. The effect is like taking control of a living picture book constructed of everyday materials, forming an almost countless range of textures. Speaking of feel, Yoshi's Story is the first platform game ever to use analogue control for the main character. It's the first platform game ever to provide tactile response from the controller (N64 Rumble Pak compatible).

S SOBV INTENDO TELETUBBIES LOOK VICIOUS TENDO SUPER PEACE TREE DISAPPEARANCE MAKES The main reason Yoshi's Story looks like a picture story book is because Nintendo thought it would look cool. However they've also justified the situation with this bizarre little story, which tells how the baby Koopoa (aka Bowser) cast a spell on Yoshi's island to transform it into a picture book. Not stopping at that, he stole the Super Peace Tree, which keeps all little Yoshis happy. Only six eggs escaped the dreadful 2D charm, and they hatched into six baby Yoshis.

BANJO & KAZOOIE onkey Kong Country, and Diddy's Kong Quest are two of the most enjoyable games on Super NES. Of all the class ingredients which made the world go ape for these games, somewhere near the top of the list must come the team aspect. It's the exact same thing which makes Super Mario World so appealing, the ingenious co-operation between Mario and Yoshi. In such games you only find the coolest secrets once you've learned how to make the two characters work as a team. But it was Diddy and Dixie especially (DKQ) who made the idea their own, as the two were always on screen at the same time. You're looking at the next in line to adopt this cool theme. The monkeys are gone, to be replaced by a stork and a bear. Strange choice, but you'll find Rare's latest game is as select as they come. Work Banjo & Kazooie as a team to win through. BANJO & KAZOOIE WOKE UP THIS MORNIN' Hot dang, if it ain't another kidnap right under our noses! The very basic story which themes B&K tells of Gruntilda the wicked witch, who steals Banjo bear's sister Piccolo; takes her off to a tower. Since the dumb bear has nothing better to do than sit by the swamp picking tunes off of his banjo, he decides to teach Gruntilda a lesson she won't forget. As this is a big game, Banjo has a while to remember exactly what the lesson is. GIT YOUR HANDS OFF ME! BUDDY INNA BACK PACK HEROES Control of the characters in B&K gets pretty involved. For Banio it's simple, as most of his moves require single buttons to trigger. Kazooie requires combina tions of buttons in order to perform. Just to run around, Kazooie uses the Z Trigger plus the lower C button together, and directions from the 3D stick. Special moves like the Egg Butt, and Egg Head get a little more complicated. But you can handle it, no problem. Since cooperation is the theme, let's meet the problem the bear can't handle all by himself. team.

"ALL THE WORLD'S A JIGSAW PUZZLE computer video games NINTENDO Sub games play a major role in Banjo & Kazooie. That's not to say they crop up all the time, but the rewards for doing well extend the appeal of the game quite a way. So, for kazooie to successfully pluck more worms from the ground than his rival, and only ones of a certain colour, he gets a piece of Jigsaw. For this Banjo is temporarily transormed into a mini croc by Witch Doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. With enough pieces of jigsaw you can build whole new areas for Banjo & Kazooie to explore, finding items which will make defeating Gruntilda a doddle. By the way, crocs aren't Mumbo-Jumbo's only party trick! Sometimes you've got to be thankful that you can't listen to screenshots. ONE SURPRISED BEAR Banjo as a mini croc. He can also become a pumpkin, and an ant (to infiltrate an ant's nest!) None of the best stuff is obvious in a game like this, as you should know from playing Mario 64. In Banjo & Kazooie solving problems is not just fun, it's a brilliant laugh! Most of the gags come from Kazooie's instinctive skill with eggs, like the time where he fires an egg up each nostril of a sphinx to make it sneeze, revealing a secret door in a nearby wall. More standard goings on, for videogames that is, involve special blocks marked with an icon. For example, use the Shock Spring item while Kazooie's standing on the relevant block, and he's catapulted off into the air. RARE SEAL OF QUALITY To make doubly sure that Rare's third-generation double-act lives up to its heritage, producer Gregg, Mayles is once again involved. Gregg handled Donkey Kong Country, and Diddy's kong Quest. He should know what's best for Banjo and Kazooie. BANJO & KAZOOIE SWAMPINEST SWAMP GIMME DAT GOLDARN IT! Either this is Banjo& Kazooie interrogating a palm tree, or this camel is the desert dentist. Though B&K doesn't follow a strict stage/mid-boss/endboss routine, there are larger-than-your-average monsters roaming the land and sea. These beasts must be tackled in order to retrieve key items, such as those talked about earlier. It's the way that these objects are associated with their owner that is such a nice touch. Like, take the Clam for example: Once you're done persuading the oyster to leave, you can nick off with the shell for use later. There's a big monkey too think you have to steal his nuts. Expect a big leap in visual excellence from your N64 with Banjo & Kazooie, same as Rare stunned us all with Donkey Kong Country on the Super NES. Kind of like the style of Mario 64 crossed with the realism of Pilot Wings, introduced to the freaked-out mind of a Rare artist! Join Banjo & Kazooie inside the body of a giant mechanical shark. Take a trip on the back of a goofy camel in the desert, where the light is bright. Best of the best we've seen, though, is the haunted house where a giant ghostly hand (transparent) plays on a giant piano as Banjo passes through. In other rooms the detail is intense check out the shot with the fourposter bed and look at the panels. This level of detail immerses you into a 3D world like never before.

TML OUT MAR (JAP) 1-2 PLAYERS PlayStation  STORAGE 1CD  PUBLISHED BY SONY TEL 0171 447 1600 PlayStation Calm down, calm down. Are you ready for this? You're sure? Well in that case... IT'S TEKKEN 3 FOR PLAYSTATION! ARRRGGGGHHH! WIN:1 agerly anticipated? Maybe just a little. One of the games of 1998? We reckon so. And Tekken 3's release is a hell of a lot closer than you think! Even though these first ever pictures of the home version are only from a 30% complete version, you can see that they are all quite outstanding and just what everyone was hoping for. There is no point in continuing the unnecessary overuse of the words 'arcade perfect' because that would be impossible to do on the PlayStation. But as these stills show, it looks like Namco will give the PlayStation the version it deserves. And with a March release pencilled in for Japan, it looks as though the guys and gals at Namco are going to have a very busy start to 1998 indeed! THE DIRTY HALEDOZEN? FIRST PLAYSTATION TEKKEN 3 SHOTS BACK DOOR, BACK DOOR! The backgrounds will hold one of the major clues as to how well the PlayStation can cope with such a major translation as this. With the scenery from the arcade being completely 3D, Sony's little box of tricks would have to have a hell of a lot of power to manage that and the characters' moves. You would think that in favour of being able to use as many polygons on the characters as possible, they would sacrifice some of the quality in backgrounds, but we don't know yet. At present only three fight settings are in the game, and they are Hwoarang's Temple stage, Jin's Dojo stage and finally the Factory level where you may expect to find Nina. Even at the 30% complete mark, there are still quite a few characters in the game already. Of course, all of the fighters from the arcade will be playable, along with all of the secret ones (Heihachi, Julia Chang and Gun Jack are but a few), but for the moment Jin Kazama, Paul Phoenix, Nina Williams, Lei Wulong. King, Yoshimitsu, Hwoarang and Eddy are the fighters we know are included. As you can see, the characters still look incredible, even with less polygons. H . YOSHITSU HWOARANG HOT GAMES FOR 98. Fighters still have lots of their original moves. REPLAY STAGE 1 HWOARANG 1  Hwoarang's missed kick is the perfect height for a counter. "


"computer Video games HWOARANG LE TM PlayStation One of the big questions circling the net is whether the backgrounds are 2 or 3D? Can you tell? HENWILL BE PAYINAT?? If you're Japanese or have a chipped import machine, it could be as soon as March. If, on the other hand you're living in the US, optimists predict that you could be playing it straight after the Jap launch to cut down on the amount of import copies sold. However, this looks more likely to slip to July or August of '98. But for people of Europe, the wait is somewhat longer. If trends in conversions are anything to go by, we could be looking at an autumn release. Sorry folks, but it looks like you're going to have to wait sometime for the official UK version. SO TELL ME ABOUT THE CHARACTERS While some of these may look like the same fighters from Tekken 2, the 15 year difference in time scale has thrown up a few surprises. Jin Kazama is the son of Kazuya Mishima and Jun Kazama, and was trained by Heihachi when his mother died. King is not the same King from Tekken 2. He was brought up in the orphanage of Tekken 2's King (confused?). Forest Law is Marshall's son (that one was easy enough to work out). Hwoarang was a student of Baek, and Julia Chang was abandoned as a baby and found by Michelle, who raised her as her own. So there you go. Make any sense? ROUND 1 FIRST PLAYSTATION TEKKEN 3 SHOTS XIAOYU Every fighter who appeared in the arcade version will be present in the PS version. Cool! Moves like this one from Xiaoyu are perfect for starting air juggle combos. Jin in his alternate costume looks super cool. WHAT ABOUT THE ADD-ON BITS? a } It doesn't need any. There were many rumours flying about when the PlayStation conversion of Tekken 3 was announced. Some said that in order to get the entire game you had to plug your PlayStation into a PC. Others said that a memory pack similar to the one available on Saturn would have to be bought in addition. But now the stories have stopped doing the rounds, and facts are what remains Tekken 3 will run on its own. Just the CD and that's it. Of course the polygon count is lower, but it will still be pushing the PS further than any other game will have done before. HOT GAMES FOR 98 TEKKEN IT TOO FARI The chances are that Namco will continue to release batches of screenshots until the release of the game. If that is not the case however, we will provide a more in-depth Coming Soon next month. Jin's uppercut is an awesome move. Look at Lei's energy to see the damage caused. "

In fact Gran Turismo is the third driving game he has been involved with. In contrast to his last PlayStation racer, Motor Toon Grand Prix, much more development time has gone on making Gran Turismo as realistic as possible.

In total there are 140 different vehicles, ranging from a Subaru Legacy Touring Wagon (which looks like a turbo-charged estate car), to a Dodge Viper.

"computer video 95% games COMPLETE PLATFORM BY NAMCO  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD TM PlayStation ??? RELEASE | 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY NAMCO TEL 0171 447 1600 PlayStation After a string of hit PlayStation beat 'em ups and driving games, Namco turn their unrivalled talent to platform games! LO0I 36 KLONOA BOM here was a time when nearly every home video game was a platform game. Film licenses, character licenses, no-licenses, they all ended up as jumparound-dodge-the-ghosts-collect-the-coins games. These days though, there are few developers willing to work within this oldfashioned format, and even fewer who can turn out a 'next generation' platform game which makes effective use of modern hardware. When we heard those PlayStation gods at Namco were producing a platformer, though, we felt sure that it would be a bit special. Now we know the truth Klonoa is cool! DOOR TO PHANTOMILE HYUPO\"S RING A KLONOA — NAMCOS MEW PLATFORMER KLONOA NAMCO'S MEW PLATFORMER We've found the plot in Klonoa a bit difficult to fathom, but as far as we can make out from the incredibly pretty) attract sequence, this is what you're doing. It starts with Klonoa himself (a kind of cat with wing-like ears) walking in the woods when a large gold ring drops from the sky and embeds itself in the earth. When he yanks it out a little glowing space friend called Hyupo appears and off they go, frolicking through the meadows. Suddenly Klonoa sits up in bed it's all been a dream! Or has it? There's Hyupo by his bed, and hovering somewhere over the land of Phantomile is the unwelcome presence of the wizard Ghadious who has followed Hyupo to Klonoa's home planet. With the help of Joka, Ghadious is invading Phantomile, taking the natives hostage and imprisoning them in nightmare bubbles, and only the wielder of Hyupo's ring can stop him. Taking the ring, Klonoa dives out of his house and prepares to do his duty! CTE 1.9 C M 3 SMASHING STUFF Namco have taken a leaf out of Sega Sonic Team's book by breaking the game up into levels called 'visions'. In each vision Klonoa has to run through a maze of platforms in search of six imprisoned Phantomileans. The Phantomileans are held in eggs or nightmare bubbles, some of which are stashed in out of the way places, while others are invisible and only appear when Klonoa passes over a certain spot or hits a certain object. As for the other power-ups, crystals serve the usual purpose of providing an extra life for every 100 collected, and if you smash a mirror fairy icon you get a few seconds in which every dream crystal you collect counts double. There are also memory clocks which Klonoa can hit. These act as restart points should he lose a life. 451 HOT GAMES FOR 98 000 0 000 There's another one released! The block puzzle at the bottom of the screen shows how many Phantomileans are still to be found. While the mirror fairy stays in the top left of the screen every crystal you collect counts twice! Now how can you possibly get to that one? Some thinking required here perhaps. 1 42 "


"THROW-A-FOE computer video games Klonoa defends himself with the old standby of grabbing his foes then throwing them, to the left or right, or into or out of the screen. Throw them at walls to destroy them, or throw them at other Myus to destroy two at one stroke. The Myus serve other purposes too. Throwing a stunned Myu at an icon or a switch instantly activates it or, in the case of an egg, releases a prisoner or dream crystals. Also, if you grab one, then jump and press the jump button again, Klonoa hurls the Myu at the ground and doubles the height of his leap essential in certain locations, and later in the game you actually have to manage repeated double-jumps, leaping from Myu to Myu to reach a lofty ledge. EI OIB YOTO Throwing a Myu at this ... drops this bridge. Only the power of Myu target... jumps can attain such heights! PlayStation * * * @ 3D INTO 2D WILL GO ORIENT This path runs around a huge vase. There's a minecart level Though the action in Klonoa is mostly two-dimensional (in that you can and a tree trunk only move left and right) the level layouts are three-dimensional. Look stage too (below). into the distance, for example, and you might see part of the level that you will come to further on, when the path loops around on itself. On occasion you even have to interact with objects in the background, throwing Myus at eggs or switches that are in the middle distance to activate them. Paths also cross over each other, leading into and out of the screen, so that you can take a detour and explore another part of the level before coming back to the main route. As the path meanders around mountains or huge tree trunks the camera follows, zooming in and out and changing position too to give a better perspective of the action and a wonderful feeling of depth to the environment. KLONOA NAMCO'S MEW PLATFORMER GHADIOUS' LITTLE HELPERS At the end of each vision, Ghadious and his little helper Joka', unleash a boss. The bosses we've seen are all cleverly done but anyone with any platform game nous will have a fair idea of how to handle them. Klonoa's means of defence is grabbing baddies and throwing them, so all you have to do in the boss encounters is work out what you can grab and where and when to throw it. The first boss, Rongo Lango, shown here, has only one vulnerable spot and that's the back of the ball he bounces about on. Grab a Myu and throw it at the ball when he bounces over Klonoa and he takes a hit. The sinister spine-fish and the crawling plant bosses that appear later in the game use different attack patterns but they yield to similar tactics. 001 en Here Klonoa can choose to follow the main route to the right or take a detour to the left. ITTICA Look in the distance and you can see... ... where you should end up later on. HOT GAMES FOR 98 2.94 OTTER 04] When he's not trying to bounce on Klonoa's head, Rongo Lango attacks with air and ground shockwaves. JUMP TO IT SONYI Here you have to grab a Myu, then bounce over the plant and throw one into its gaping maw as it passes beneath you. As far as we can tell from our Japanese copy, Klonoa is a really nice platform game. Nothing staggeringly new, but it has a lot of style about it, looks great and it's really easy to pick up and play. We look forward to the European version. THOE "

This is the first Battle Dance Game ever made, and it's loads of fun. Learn the dance routines of at least 10 ultra-stylish characters and use them to shame the competition. Bust A Move could be described as PaRappa meets Virtua a dance game which uses Virtua Fighter style commands to make characters dance themselves dizzy (do the boogaloo). Follow increasingly complex button commands which appear on screen similar to the Tekken 2 practice mode. Hit them in the right order, with spot-on timing, and your character performs wicked dance moves. So cool, in fact, that it makes you want to get up and dance yourself. Kind of. Dancing starts off simple just clap your hands (one button). Very soon the commands become tricky to pull off within one bar of music (down, up, down, up, right, button, different button...) but the character's response is totally cool if you succeed. There are even dance combos you can pull off if you get the hang of it these really make the crowd go wild. Warming up before the contest begins. Wait till you see Shorty go! PLAYSTATION ROUND-UP COMENTE! DANOIN The hotter your character gets, the more his/her popularity meter builds up. Once they've worked the crowd into a frenzy they deal a blow to their rival sounds like a clap of thunder. This messes up the rivals's concentration, so they have to work to get back into the groove. Each contest is timed according to the length of the track being played. Incidentally, all the music comes from top Japanese dance label AVEX TRAX. When the music stops, the performance is rated. First of all the guy or gal with the most popularity wins. But if this goes right off the scale it's FEVER TIME your character's chance to please the crowds with an encore. This is also your chance to sit back and admire their style without having to sweat it out with them. We're very impressed by Bust A Move, and can't wait for Heat, Frida, and especially Shorty to make it over here. Currently we understand that Sony UK are looking at the possibilities. It would be a shame if they don't. HOT GAMES FOR 98 The trademark \"Bust A Move\" is owned by TAITO CORPORATION in all countries except Japan.

Run around, jump po gaping chasms, whack things! Pitfall is back! 040 ack in the days of one button joysticks, huge chunky cartridges and the words 'Atari' and 'successful could be used in the same sentence, a game called Pitfall appeared on the old Atari VCS. It was a simple affair, jumping over pits and such like, but one that proved immensely playable. Over 15 years on and Pitfall Harry is back, with a brand new 3D world to run around in. Naturally, new monsters have been created to keep up the the new modern approach. Of course, Harry still has the trademark swinging ropes to help him get across ledges, but they too are a hazard to him, as some are made from fire! It's shaping up nicely and may be one of the surprise titles of the year. BEYOND THE JUNCLE Even if you cannot fully jump onto the platforms, Harry has the ability to hang and pull himself up if necessary. It's more exciting than it sounds. CRYSTAL WINTERS PIT FALL 3D HE'S THE KING OF THE SWINGERS HAPPY AS HARRY Lucense is also the name of the crystals that you have to collect during the levels. And because of the size of the stages, there are hundreds of them to round up. If you're running short of health, these crystals can be exchanged for life in special plumes of light that are situated at key points around the levels. The other important icon to look out for is the restart logo. Yes it's obvious to say this, but there is nothing more annoying than completing half the stage, dying and being sent back to the start. The basics behind the game are still the same, in that you have to jump from platforms to disappearing planks and over lava pits, but a host of enemies get in your way. Small scorpions grab hold of you with their tail if you stray too close to them, and giant ape beasts give you what for if you fail to clump them first. The bosses are also particularly nasty. The Gladiator boss is situated inside a giant gas tank which is filled with a substance called Lucense. This liquid substance also has anti gravity properties, and you float on top of it. All you have to do is close all of the ducts so that the gas level rises and he drowns. The trouble is, if you don't plug it in time, he opens it up and you have to start all over again. You can control the direction you swing in once on a vine. 98 HOT GAMES FOR 1 Stepping on the gas (Lucense) causes you to stagger about, a bit like Bambi on ice. Hmmm.

"computer Video games AFTER FINAL FANTASY VII Many of you are nearing the last battle in Final Fantasy VII. We know the game has lived up to your expectations from the letters and phone calls we receive. But what next from Square? ayStation lhe amazing success of Final Fantasy VII in the UK has created a huge interest in the RPG-style game. Since we're partly responsible for this, CVG is planning to dedicate more pages each month to RPGs. We kick off this month with at look at Square Soft's stunning range. These stand the best chance of seeing a UK release as Sony already have the rights to publish Square Soft games in the UK. And the 1998 line-up is at least as worthy as Final Fantasy VII. XENOGEARS 99999 380 A 199757 tuel922 9 9999 fue 883 Time HOT NEW TITLES FROM SQUARESOFTU ights featuring Tekker-style commands during battle, and a graphics engine which puts even the stunning Grandia (Game Arts Sega Saturn) to shame. In Xenogears you adopt the role of a teenage boy named Fei, who is suffering from amnesia. This is the device Square use to make each new revelation in the story more and more exciting. For example the story begins with Fei painting a picture at his home in Rahan, a quiet country village. This fools you into believing Xenogears follows the Sword And Sorcery direction, made popular by Enix's Dragon Quest, and later Capcom's Breath Of Fire series. You're even required to lead an expedition into the mountains, where you get a taste of the cool battle system, and the ability to fully rotate the 3D world using the shoulder buttons on your controller. Wow! In fact this is just a prelude. As Fei and his team of friends continue they hear a rumble, and distant screams. Rahan is under attack from impossible beings colossal robot suits called Gears. Fei rushes back to save the village, but instead of trying to stop the gears, Fei climbs into one (slightly different to the others) and challenges the invader! What's even more surprising is that he Atock level 1740 tuet40 total 50/50 S 40/40 5) HOT GAMES FOR 98 REAL 3 120 pilots the Gear like a natural. There is more to Fei than he can easily bring to mind. And there is more to Xenogears than a casual glance will disclose. The theme of combining advanced technology and ancient arts is very popular with Square. It was brilliantly engineered by Final Fantasy VII, and the Xenogears take is also great. Visually it allows for a greater variation of scenes futuristic cities and vehicles; lush greenery. Characters range from understated humans to the surprising, often disturbing, exploits of cyborgs. One female character, Emereda Kharim, is a cyborg created by a race called the Zeboym. She looks like a natural human being, but has a few surprises in store. Battles are more interesting because of the tradition/technology mix, though Xenogears' battle system would be fantastic under any circumstances. You can have more than three (possibly up to six) members in your fighting squad in FFVII there is a maximum of three. To launch an attack players must input commands in a style similar to Tekken. Combinations of moves are built up in much the same way too. Spectacular sequences of moves result, some culminating in outrageous magic (meteors, volcanic eruptions, typhoons...)! Since you enlist the help of many characters in Xenogears, you can imagine how many combos there are to learn! The same technique applies to using the Gears, whose colossal size shakes the ground when they walk, let alone practice kempo. Xenogears is already creating havoc in Japan, which gives Sony good enough time to persuade Square that the UK needs it for Christmas '98. We'll keep you informed! RECICK teel Po 50/50 DER 350 "


"PARASITE EVE compute vided games Playstati f Final Fantasy VII is your first experience of RPGs, we think Parasite Eve is likely to impress you the most. Just like FFVII, Parasite Eve has quite a dark theme and features less cute characters. It also adopts a similar cinematic style. The title of the game is very literal the story relates the existence of a gross human parasite, Eve. This monster consumes people from within, then unleashes terrible magic on anyone within sight. Only one person can stop Eve: would you believe it, a NYPD cop name of Aya Blair! Of course Aya isn't about to win this war with cuffs and a trip to the station. Fact is she doesn't know how to herself, but for some reason Aya is immune to Eve's evil. As for everyone else in the story, they're either cooked or consumed by the parasite, which leaves Aya even more monsters to contend with. It's an intriguing story, set just before the new Millennium in New York city. Initially our heroine has only one close friend with the courage to fight alongside her Daniel, Aya's partner. Their first confrontation with Eve takes place at the Opera House (Eve has control of the diva that night!). From here on, after all the calamity, the story details are secret. So let's focus on the other most important aspect of Parasite Eve. The battle system? Similar to the one used in Final Fantasy, but much more advanced. Not difficult, just more varied, and more involved. First of all the scene doesn't change for a battle to take place. whereas in FFVII battles look quite different to the main game. This significant change means that battles are carried out in full 3D both sides can move sideways, closer to, or further away from the opponent to dodge attacks or strengthen their own. Targeting is automatic, but evasion is done manually which will require lots of concentration to survive. To account for the freedom of movement, there is a new Vicinity Radar. Green lines indicate air space, and blue lines describe the ground area. The size of the vicinity Radar is determined by the type of weapon. Unless the enemy is within its, you cannot attack. BULLET MB00 Once you've attacked you need time for your power to restore. This is where you need to manually dodge the enemy's attacks. This approach has never been tried before in an RPG. 1981 1AAR HOT NEW TITLES FROM SQUARESOFT! CHOCOBO DUNGEON 12F L. 35 HP 264/271 98% rue to a Chocobo's magical character, this action RPG is mysterious to the core but cute with it. Action shifts between adventures above ground (chatting to people, learning what is required of you as an expert dungeon explorer), and dungeon exploration itself. The most exciting point about this routine is that the world above ground changes according to what has been discovered underneath. New fields appear, new roads, new houses, even new people. This makes the game different each time you play! Making it all happen is achieved always from a hands-on action approach. The basic control system doesn't switch to menus when there's a battle, players can move around Chocobo, or his partner Atola (the Mogli), freely at all times. Fights use a variation of the Active Time Battle, and it's up to the player to allow Chocobo to recover between blows. Just hitting out all the time results in weak attacks, same as in Secret Of Mana on the Super NES in fact. Items which increase Chocobo's attack power are found hidden in chests somewhere in the dungeon, or bought above ground in one of the villages. Likewise magic potions. Magic is applied in Chocobo's own cute way before casting a spell he sits down to read it from a huge book. All the Final Fantasy favourites are here, including the Summon Beast variety. The special effects are magnificent, as you should expect from Square. Another spectacular game for you to lose sleep over. Hurry Sony, before you become responsible for a nation of insomniac zombies. 10F Lv. 6 HP 45/ 50 95% 12F Lv 9 HP_86/ 86 100% 12F Lv.35 HP 254/271 97% HOT GAMES FOR 98 8 IF Lv 37 HP 28 2/282 88%  "

RASCAL f course Mario 64 will never appear on the PlayStation, but could the machine handle it? For the answer to that, look no further than Rascal, the latest offering from Psygnosis. Here's a cute platform game that has a look all of its own, yet the Mario-matching power behind the graphics is apparent for all to see. If it has the gameplay of the Nintendo classic, Rascal could be making some waves of his own come the spring, and so far the signs are looking very good. TIME KEEPS ON SLIPPING RASCAL: WHO'S A NAUGHTY BOY THEN? RASCAL: WHO'S A NAUGHTY BOY THEN Chronon, the evil time overlord, is meddling with the past. He's kidnapped your father, Professor Casper Clockwise, an esteemed scientific adviser. He's also stolen the Professor's plans for a time-travelling vessel. The ETTAS machine (Exploration Through Time And Space) will give Chronon powers beyond comprehension. It's up to you to save the day, because you are Rascal! THE BOY IN THE BUBBLE Rascal must make his way through six worlds in a bid to stop the evil Chronon, and return history to normality. You must defeat the time overlord's henchmen, and collect six segments on each level to create a time bubble. This bubble allows Rascal to travel through time. Starting in your home/lab you must find the gateways to different time-portals, and clear up any mess that Chronon may have left behind. You'll visit the Wild West, the land of the Aztecs, and a pirate ship on your travels, but you won't have too much time to admire the sights. The little Rascal is about to turn into a pancake. This could turn nasty. HOT GAMES FOR 98 STOPI N THE NAME OF LOVE, BEFORE YOU BREAK MY HEART. Friend or foe? This robot doesn't look very menacing, but you can never trust shiny robots! 54 Watch where you're shooting! Rascal uses his bubble gun on the cowboy's hide. No wonder he's protecting his identity. "


"IT'S TIME TO PUT ON MAKE-UP compute vided games PlayStatic The makers of the game realised that to compete with the Mario's and Sonic's of the world they'd better have some interesting characters in the game. Travellers Tales approached the Jim Henson's Creature Workshop to design the three main characters in the game. Known for their designs on Sesame Street and of course The Muppet Show. Henson's Workshop provided the look of Rascal, Chronon and Casper Clockwise for the game. They aren't quite Kermit the Frog, or Fozzie Bear, but they have a style all of their own. WE'RE SENDING YOU BACK TO THE FUTURE! Well, we guess he's about the same height as Kermit, and some parts of him are green. THEY'RE GOOD THEY ARE The next part of the game is quite clever. In a twist involving the theft of the time-machine plans. Each of the six worlds must be visited in different time periods the past, present and future. This radically alters each world. For example the pirate ship in the past is sailing on the sea, and inhabited by pirates. In the present it is a shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean. While in the future, the ocean has dried-up, and the ship lies derelict in a desert. The same twists happen for each of the worlds. In one, a castle in the past is inhabited by knights, while in the present the castle has been turned into a museum complete with exhibits. These changes in time lend the game a great deal of humour. There are lots of small visual jokes to look out for once you enter each different world and time. Tonight's special guest, Crash Bandicoot, and his ker-azy mask. Travellers Tales already have a reputation of working wonders on the Saturn and Megadrive. Their recent show of skill was displayed in Sonic R. For Rascal on the PlayStation they seem to have surpassed even their own high standards, with lots of graphical trickery and effects on screen. Even more impressive is the short loading time between levels. Each room that Rascal enters must be loaded separately, but this takes place so fast that you'll hardly notice it. Once in the game, the look is astounding. Lighting effects and reflective surfaces really show off the graphical side of the game. Let's just hope it plays as good. RASCAL: WHO'S A NAUGHTY BOY THEN? RASCAL: WHO'S A NAUGHTY BOY THEN? A raptor on the prowl, and you've only got a bubble-gun! The Wild West in the past, it's very wild. Hurrah for the obligatory mine cart level. Now in glorious 3D! Oi Mario! You can take your free-roaming 3D platform antics and stick 'em where the sun don't shine. Anything you can do, I can do... the same! HOT GAMES FOR 98 8 HEY BOY, YOU SURE LOOK PRETTY As you can see Rascal is quite a beauty. In the coming months we'll soon find out if there's a brain in there as well. Hopefully it won't be a beast! In the present there's '30s style gangsters! Rascal finds himself having to rescue gobbos, and a crocodile. 55 "

The surprise PlayStation hit of 1998. And if you don't believe us sit up and pay attention. You can have your Tekken and Resident Evil sequels, but if you're after original software, watch this! k, so Metal Gear Solid is a sequel METAL GEAR SOLID k, so Metal Gear Solid is a sequel too, but just as Final Fantasy VII proved last year, other consoles' losses are the PlayStation's gain. Metal Gear first appeared on the now defunct MSX system over ten years ago. Although the MSX played host to a Metal Gear sequel Solid Snake the game's creators were waiting for a suitable platform to arrive, for the game they'd always envisaged. Of course that machine was the PlayStation, and Metal Gear Solid has already been over two years in the making. In those two years, Metal Gear has being wowing audiences at nearly every trade show throughout the world. Konami have been proudly showing the latest video footage and basking in the praise. Now we'll show you what all the fuss is about, and remember, by the end of the year you'll all be playing this! REFERENT THE NAME'S SNAKE, SOLID SNAKE METAL GEAR SOLID JUST A MAN, AND HIS COURAGE The stage is set for a thrilling adventure, and boy are you going to get it. Be warned, you shouldn't expect to infiltrate the base with all guns blazing. No, this is the thinking man's shoot 'em up. As in Rare's brilliant Goldeneye, stealth is allimportant. Facing seemingly insurmountable odds, you must use your stealth as a weapon. Why call the attention of all the guards when you can pick them off one-by-one? In an effort to get you thinking straight away, the game starts with Snake equipped only with a pair of binoculars and a pack of cigarettes. A nuclear weapon has been stolen by a terrorist organisation, and moved to a top-secret military base in Alaska. The terrorists have identified themselves as Foxhound. A special troop formed in the 1990s, who specialised in combating local rebellions, and terrorist activities. In the 21st century, Foxhound members received gene therapy. Sometime after this their where abouts were unknown. Now they have emerged, and made their intentions very clear. As Solid Snake, an ex-Foxhound member, you must combat these terrorists. Although this is a one man mission, there may be members of Foxhound that can assist you, should you reach them in time. You have 24 hours to infiltrate the base, eliminate the terrorists, and disarm the nuclear missile. 255 HOT GAMES FOR 98 Are these the missiles you're looking for? Whatever their purpose, they still act as pretty awesome hiding places! "


"BABY STEPS INTO THE BASE A VIEW TO A KIL compute vided game The ways to attract guards attentions are numerous. All the guards on the base follow their own set agendas, even taking breaks at certain intervals. Forget making loud noises with guns, even a footstep can alert these guys. Guards can also throw grenades, so hiding behind what appears to be a solid object isn't even safe. A grenade can simply be lobbed over the top to kill you. the game takes place in an amazingly believable 3D environment. The majority of the game takes place through a third-person perspective, though Metal Gear has some advantages over Resident Evil. Here you can switch to a first-person perspective, which is especially useful for shoot-outs. From here you can use a look button just like Lara Croft in Tomb Raider. While in the third-person perspective you can also move the camera, to give yourself a better view of the action. If that wasn't enough, the camera will move around by itself to give you a better view of the proceedings. PlayStatio LIFE The question mark above his head shows that he is confused and is vulnerable to attack.

FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION 200/200 LLLLLL METAL GEAR SOLID If only the guard heading your way knew what was coming his way! Hiding is a vital part of the game. Luckily, this shot missed! 255 In a world of espionage and stealth you can expect lots of fancy gadgets and weapons. The team behind the game went to great lengths to research the latest weapons for inclusion in Metal Gear, even consulting US SWAT teams about their methods and tactics. They also spent a large amount of time on shooting ranges to find out how the weapons fired and handled. There are dozens of weapons in the game, each with different sounds and effects. Ranging from pistols up to sub-machine guns, sniper rifles and silenced weapons. There's even a guidable cruise missile in the game somewhere, which Snake can use via a missile cam. You'll also have to find keys, explosive charges and detonators. Using these objects correctly is vital. You want more? It's even possible to set traps and trigger distractions to divert guards. Pray you don't get the farts. 56. 200 111111!!!! Sod the stealth! You've been spotted and safety has become the number one priority! Shoot and run! ELLE DECORATION 933 BA Hiding behind glass eh? Hmm. When playing the game you could be mistaken that you're watching a movie. This is because the project's director, Hideo Kojima actually wanted to be a movie director before he got interested in games. This is evident when you see the movement of all the characters and how enemies react. His attention to detail is incredibly accurate. Which is why nearly all rooms are full of objects, rather than the sparse table and chair set up you usually get in 3D games. Kojima even boasts that you can see nuts and bolts in the background walls a detail he is especially proud of. HOT GAMES FOR 98  START PLANNING YOUR ATTACK 9999 THERE ATTITUI Are you excited yet? We certainly are, and can't wait to get our hands on a copy of the game. As soon as Konami give us their blessing, we'll be giving you even more on this amazing release. Synchronise watches. Look closer and you can see the laser sight on his gun. It's attention to detail like this that is sure to make Metal Gear Solid a winner. "


"video games 80% COMPLETE STRATEGY BY HOOKSTONE  PREDECESSORS AVAILABLE  PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD OUT APRIL ROM (1 MULTIPLAYER  RELEASED BY PSYGNOSIS TEL 0151 282 3000 PC ROM One of the most famous games to be made in the UK in the eighties, is about to attempt a possibly reputation-damaging comeback. Can it pull off the impossible? PlayStation SENTINEL RETURNS f you're too young or simply don't remember the game The Sentinel, then you're missing out. It made its first appearance on the BBC Micro in 1985. In subsequent years it was released on numerous other formats. What is it about? Well that's pretty difficult to explain. In the intervening years since The Sentinel appeared, there hasn't been anything like it. Basically, Sentinel is a classic puzzle game with thousands of levels. It starts off pretty simple, but before you know it you're hooked. Minutes turn to hours, and hours become days don't say we didn't warn you. BATMAN. THEN THE MACK. NOW THE SENTINEL RETURNS! ROSE-TINTED SPECTACLES ALERT The sinister level select screen. Semi-victorian crossed with David Lynch. Quite exciting things happening here. Trees, boulders and genies of the lamp? SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE BRAIN To understand the importance of The Sentinel you have to go back to the beginning. The original game was conceived and coded by Geoff Crammond a legend amongst games makers. Through his career he has treated us to Aviator, Revs, Stunt Car Racer and Grand Prix's 1 & 2. Although he has had no involvement with the sequel, his imprint remains throughout the game. Upon its debut, The Sentinel was hailed as a masterpiece. A fact that remains today. In recent years many have cried out for an update. Now that wish is finally about to see the light of day. Will a game that was in many ways ahead of its time, still be able to hold the modern player's attention? 3 HOT GAMES FOR 98 BATMAN. THEN THE MACK. NOWTH The idea and gameplay behind The Sentinel is a rather strange concept. The player must absorb the sentinel and replace him as ruler of the level. This carries on through hundreds of levels. The Sentinel is inactive until you start to absorb energy. To move around each level it is necessary to do this. The original game feaOLD! tured a chessboard-style landscape, the sequel retains this design, but a little more subtly. You are only allowed to move to areas that you are able to see from where you are standing. So in order to absorb the Sentinel, you must be positioned above him. This is easier said than done because the Sentinel has the highest vantage point of each level. NEW! While the PlayStation version is a little cruder than the 3Dfx game (below), it contains all the same levels! Use boulders to make a replica of yourself. Use the spindly trees to absorb more energy. 58 "


"DOES NOT COMPUTE!! computer vided games HE INVENTED HOUSE MUSIC! The idea is simple, but explanations get a little difficult when it comes to the area of absorbing energy. The Sentinel from his vantage point is constantly turning, scouring its vantage point for anything with a higher energy value than a tree namely you. To move around this domain, you must transfer energy by making a replica of yourself. You can then transfer into this replica, and absorb the energy from the previous replica. All objects in the game world have an energy value. A replica of yourself contains three units, a boulder two, and a tree one. To make a replica you must use the energy from trees and boulders. The Sentinel has an energy value of four. If the Sentinel happens to locate you, he will reduce the energy one unit at a time, until you are killed. Ahh, we can hear the strategies formulating in your heads already. Which of course, is the key to success in this awesome game. ROM The game also uses Q-Sound. This uses two speakers to create a pseudo-surround sound experience, With a pair of headphones the experience is said to be even better. This technology is used to aide the player. With the sound used to indicate where the Sentinel and his Sentries are placed. The soundtrack to the game also has a high pedigree and a bit of history behind it.

John Cook is the man responsible for this daunting sequel. A huge fan of the original, he is considered the only person in the world to finish the game twice. An amazing achievement when you consider the original featured 10,000 levels. John realises there is nothing wrong with the gameplay of the original. Apart from the graphics, his main area for improvement in the sequel is the importance of an even learn ing curve. After you played the first thirty or so levels in the original, things got extremely difficult, then it felt it got easy again. This kept repeating in a cycle. As you progress through levels the Sentinel rotates faster, making your task tougher. A new addition on the PC versions will be the multiplayer option, where several players will be competing to remove the Sentinel. 3 Holy wireframe, Batman! It's a snake, wrapped around a female.

ENTERTAINMENT  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED COMPLETE SEPT RELEASE 1+ PLAYERS  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY TBA 100 ROM ROM Fed up being a tooled-up Space Marine? Try fighting off Satan in the form of a chubby cherub, in Shiny's follow-up to MDK. m e S ince it established itself with a string of formulaic but popular platform games, Shiny Entertainment has gone on to become one of the most innovative game developers around. To follow the extraordinary shoot-'em-up that was MDK, David Perry's team are working on Messiah, a game that's just as unusual and promises to be even more wonderful. So far most of the work has gone on creating new graphics-handling technology and, as you can see from these 3D-accelerated PC screenshots, it looks like a new standard in game graphics is about to be set! CHERUBIC POSSESSION MESSIAH See that young lady holding the gun? She looks like she could be a useful host body... Though the finished product is still some way off, Shiny have a clear idea of how they want the action in Messiah to shape up. Basically, God has sent you, in the form of an angel, to save the world from the all-pervading forces of Satan, mostly by explosive means. Unfortunately, as an angel, you're harmless and can't actually do any damage, so you have to possess the bodies of the humans who inhabit that game's four 'worlds' and use them to do the fighting. Although you have to start by climbing aboard any old spud that comes along, you can then use them to seek out what you might call 'a better class of person'. It's a clever game idea that has its roots in Andrew Braybrook's classic Commodore 64 game, Paradroid, in which an 'Influence Device' had to infiltrate spaceships by taking control of the different robots that inhabited them. Except for a few Paradroid off-shoot games, the concept has never been used since, which is amazing considering it must be one of the all-time classic game designs. Coupling it to Shiny's state-ofthe-art graphics engine should result in something that's really special. Looks like your current body was a good choice. The guard has been taken out and you can continue. Once you've possessed a body you can use their weapons! ALL GOD'S CHILLUN I CAN FEEL YOU IN THERE, YOU LITTLE GIT. JUST STAY AWAY FROM MY BOWELS.

Different ing him then sending him over a cliff character types also play a part; for that should sort him out. "


"HEAVENLY DEAT MATCHES computer video games Shiny has stated that Messiah, or at least the PC version, will feature a multiplayer mode that offers 'the most exciting deathmatch games ever. A bold claim, but they argue that in a Quake deathmatch it's usually the first player to get to the rocket launcher that wins (not something we'd necessarily agree with), whereas in Messiah the people are the weapons and the advantages each has may be more, varied and subtle. Shiny also reckons that, because you can see, who or what each player's character is, you can see what kind of threat they present, and that, adds an extra dimension to the gameplay. That may be true seeing your opponents' armamenti was one of the best features of Bungie's often-ignored Marathon. ROM DEUS EX MACHINA 1 Messiah deathmatches sound like they could be loads of fun! MESSIAH 1 In deathmatch mode you'll be able to swap bodies all the time. For Messiah, Shiny have developed a whole host of new gizmos for their 3D graphics engine, which promises to set a new standard for visual realism on home machines. The main addition is a technology called RT-DAT (Real-Time Deformation and Tessellation), which, put simply, creates game characters that look and move just like real people. Each model has a bone structure which is manipulated to animate the character, and the skeleton is covered in muscle with a textured skin stretched over the top. What you see are characters whose clothes crease and pull tight as they move, and whose chests rise and fall as they breathe. Real-Time Tessellation is a process that allows the computer to make polygonised characters look as realistic as possible no matter where they are in a scene, and no matter how cluttered a scene is. Basically it's an intelligent system that can remove polygons that aren't needed when the character is a long way from the camera, or when a lot of characters pile onto the screen and the game is in danger of slowing down in the midst of a major barney. The standard detail level is very high at 800 polygons per character, but the system is intelligent enough to strip that down to 80 polygons if need be, without losing essential details, such as noses. The other gadget that Shiny are shouting about is Volumetric Real-Time Lighting, ie, realistic shadows. If a character is standing behind a box that's half his height, only his lower half will be in shadow. More impressive is the promise of moving, shadow-casting, light sources. If that means you'll get to see the shadow of a potential target being cast by the rocket flying past his head, it'll be cool. When playing as an angel you can fly about the game areas. HOT GAMES FOR `98 @ THE GAME THAT IS TO COME It's early days and we don't know who will be releasing Messiah, though chances are it will be Virgin Interactive. Watch out for more game details closer to the simultaneous PC and PlayStation release in September! You've got a good choice of possible bodies here. Choose one with a big weapon. "

TENDO 64 TERPU LO SUL PILIG 88N FORSAKEN ROM early every corridor shooter that comes along tries to steal the crown from the previous heavyweight, by emulating that game to some degree. This year's number one contender is like a revamped Descent. Though, from the early signs of playing this game, Forsaken is a lot more fun than that game ever was. Flying through corridors with loads of selectable weapons. Plus the fact that this game is going to appear on three major systems. While the Unreals and Daikatanas of the world may be ready to put the gloves on and come out fighting, we reckon Forsaken is gonna flatten them both with one punch! (We'll keep quiet about Duke Nukem Forever, for the sake of this preview). STAND ASIDE AND PREPARE TO BE BOARDED THEY'RE COMING IN TOO FAST FORSAKEN QUAKEWE Each level of Forsaken is home to fantastic sights, complex puzzles and unbelievable, odds. The Military's droid units will stop at nothing, and seek to destroy all intruders. These aren't just small sentry droids with meagre weapons. As levels progress, you'll be battling more powerful foes. Remember, not all attacks come from the ground. Futuristic submarines, robotic nuclear missiles and airborne craft will all try to hunt you down. The 360 degree environment the network of tunnels provide, mean that you never know where the next attack will come, from. When even the backgrounds can kill you, like a radioactive plutonium-carrying crane, then you know you're in trouble. Like all corridor-come-space shooters, Forsaken has a dodgy backstory to get you in the mood for some mindless blasting. Simply, in our best James Earl Jones voice-over \"The year is 2113 and the Earth lies in ruin. This is because of particle physicists delving deeper into the very fabric of matter itself. Their tampering caused the creation of an uncontrollable fusion reaction, sending an irresistible shockwave through the entire system. Within days all human life on the planet had been extinguished. The ruling council of the multiverse launched an investigation into the disaster immediately. Anything considered valuable was removed, and sites warranting further study were left guarded by military robots. Months later the system is \"condemned'. Any bounty hunter, mercenary or fortune seeker now has the right to raid the system, and may take anything they want\". Which, of course, is where you come in. Taking on the role of a ruthless mercenary, you must venture into the wasteland and abandoned settlements that were once Earth. Your craft is the anti-grav pioncycle, with it you must battle the remaining mechanical vanguard, improve your fearsome reputation, and find riches. 1 Another level.

"BIKER MICE FROM MARS TAKE COVER! computer video games When we say the game is like WipEout, we mean it. Not because you're racing around levels beating lap times, but because of the amount of weapons on offer and their properties. Besides, you're flying around in a hoverbike! There are 15 different bikes and characters to choose from. Each handles differently, with the different pilots also lending their personalities to the proceedings. There's characters like Beard, a guy with a beard, or Nim Soo Sun, a biker chick. Each bike has different amounts of power, with better handling and the like. There are also over 30 different enhancement pick-ups to collect. The most vital of these is the Power Pod, which increases the power of your weapons up to a strength of three. To really destroy the enemy, you'll want to take advantage of the 15 weapons that are available, Starting with the weedy Pulsar guns, which all bikes are equipped with at the start of the game, you'll soon discover the benefits of the Pyrolite, a short range flame thrower, or the Transpulse, which is so powerful that shots can deflect off walls. The most Dick-Dastardly of all the weapons is the Scatter missile. This homes in on an enemy, and scatters their weapons on impact.

It'll be touching down first on the PC, closely followed by PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions towards the Summer. The good news for owners of these machines, is that every version features a multiplayer option. PlayStation owners will be able to go head-to-head via a split screen, while there'll be more four player fun for owners of a Nintendo 64. The PC will be able to accommodate 16 or more players, depending on specs for individual machines. By the end of the year nearly the whole gaming community will be speeding around tunnels, planting mines and fighting it out on Forsaken. FORSAKEN. QUAKE MEETS WIPEOUT The programmers are claiming that the game will push each machine to its respective limits. With three separate teams working on each game, we expect there may be some competition between the different games. A major factor each is proud of, is the lighting throughout the levels. This is an important part of the game, as almost any object can cast a light. All pick-ups emit light, as do weapons being fired and explosions. Some key weapons can also be identified by their colour. For instance, the Quantum mine emits a blue light, as this is the most powerful mine in the game. If you go around a corner and can see a blue tint to the walls, put the brakes on fast! Each version of the game will also offer analogue support.

If that news makes you sigh, desperate for a 'proper' 3D Sonic game, we've got this to say — wake up and smell the coffee! Sonic Team have a perfect track record of creating incredible, mesmerising, totally addictive games. So revel in the build-up to this one. Burning Rangers promised to be something special when we revealed it in our November issue. And now we've dipped into a morecomplete version we know it's gonna be hot! A game about future fire-fighters racing through collapsing buildings saving civilians, the serious theme and sci-fi styling made it seem unlike anything you'd expect from Sonic's creators. But when played, Burning Rangers has all their hallmarks, as we reveal. A SPEED CHALLENGE! BURNING RANGERS. ON THE FLAMING SATURNI That's what Sonic and NIGHTS were at heart tests of how fast you could handle the game. And the sense of urgency is even greater in Burning Rangers you're racing against fire! As a Burning Ranger, your missions are to free trapped people inside all manner of structures (even space stations). But first you've got to find them in mazes of corridors. And you can't stop to think. At the top of the screen is a meter indicating pressure.

Your only chance is to stay ahead of them and put out the flames with your CO2 cannon. Hangar Deck DIO!

And to power your teleporter you need crystals. These are released (probably as a by-product) when you extinguish flames or explode enemies. Or they can be found lying around. Despite the realistic nature of the game, collecting them is just like collecting balls in NIGHTS the gems are attracted as you pass them. What's more, if you get hit by an explosion you scatter all your gems, just like in Sonic. There's nothing more desperate than finding a casualty and being unable to save them through lack of gems.

After all, you cannot kill what does not live! And the Saturn is going undead for its most awaited game since Virtua Fighter 2! ega have come in for a lot of stick recently. Compared to PlayStation and Nintendo they haven't had as many grade-A games. Or so people say. We beg to differ. With Quake, Duke Nukem 3D and Marvel Super Heroes scoring High Fives, the Saturn still has top games. And while Virtua Fighter 3 is still mysteriously missing from the release schedule, anyone entering an arcade in the last six months will have seen one machine drawing continuous crowds AM1's House Of The Dead. And Sega ARE bringing it to Saturn. The greatest arcade gun game CVG has ever played is set for a March Saturn release, and we've seen an early version. Now, so have you! EVIL RESIDENTS... HOUSE OF THE DEAD ON SATURN! HOUSE OF THE DEAD ON SATURN! IN YER FACE! Perhaps the key to House Of The Dead's mass success is the same theme that has made Capcom's Resident Evil a worldwide hit a mansion filled with zombies. AM1's shooting game is strikingly similar in looks, plot and atmosphere, as you play FBI agents entering the house searching for the reason behind this undead infestation. The difference here though, is that you get a first-person view of the horror. And the sensation of fear as the camera pans slowly around every blind corner, or flicks up to see a couple of rotting corpses dropping! House Of The Dead is far more than just a Virtua down, is addictively overpowering. House Of The Cop-clone with corpses instead of crooks. Its Dead is a game of fear and excitement! gameplay is tuned perfectly around the horror element. Instead of accurately sniping at distant enemies, HotD throws them in your face.

"ROUTE OF ALL EVIL! computer video games One truly ground-breaking feature of HotD is its route-system. There are multiple paths through the house, and knowing which ones to take and how to select them is vital to success. Shooting lift switches, failing to stop scientists being killed, blasting one beast instead of another there's tons of factors that affect your route. Only by playing the game loads of times can you work out the best path. We printed a complete guide back in issue 189, and Saturn owners had better have it ready for when the home version is released. SATURN HOUSE BUILDERS The first route leads under the sewer... ... or perhaps through the front door. THE SATURN OFFSPRING AM1, the developers of the coin-op, are not making the Saturn conversion. It's actually being done by Tantalus, the team that worked on Saturn WipEout 2097 and Manx TT. Although those games weren't so great, the fact that AM1 have allowed a separate team to handle the conversion shows faith. AM1 had expressed a personal interest in making Saturn HotD themselves. Indeed they even told us some ideas they'd like to see in it including an ever-deepening plot dictated by the routes, more route junctions with a greater choice of directions, and even multiple paths through each room. Extra stages and monsters were mentioned too. So take heed Tantalus, following the awesome original mode in PlayStation Time Crisis, gun game fans expect more than simply an arcade conversion! HOUSE OF THE DEAD ON SATURN! HOUSE OF THE DEAD ON SATURN! The version of Saturn House Of The Dead seen here is extremely early in development. At the moment only the first level is in there, and even that is far from completion. Some of the textures are yet to be put in, meaning some areas are constructed only from flatshaded polygons. Also, some of the enemy 3D models are missing (the monkey zombies, for example, are currently using the dog models). The gun too, has yet to be properly configured and fires off-centre. However, what is clear even at this stage, is that Tantalus fully intend on putting all the features of the arcade game in. There are even markers showing where the hidden bonus items are to be added (getting these is vital for gaining a highscore and seeing the true ending). If it looks as good as Saturn VCop 2 and plays like the arcade game, this will be the hottest home gun game, no contest. HOT GAMES FOR 98  NEXT MONTH...

Themed around tales of characters befriending dragons and riding them into battle against an enemy empire, the first two Saturn games were clearly interlinked, but still horribly open-ended. What becomes of the dragon in the first game? Is it the same one that's in the second (only set beforehand?). What's the meaning of the sun-shaped windmill thing that keeps appearing in dreams? Panzer Dragoon Saga promises to answer all these questions, because this time it's more than just a shooting game. It's a role-playing adventure extraordinaire! PANZER DRAGOON SAGA PANZER DRAGOON SAGA: A REAL ADVENTURE OOKS FAMILIAR.BUL... IT'S LIKE YOUR REALLY THERE! Fans of the previous Panzer games may think they know what's going on in these pictures, because it looks like the 360° shooting fare that's gone before. Wrong! While you control the movement of your dragon, leading it to new areas, the combat is considerably different. In fact, Saga uses the turn-based fighting system more common to RPGs. Like Final Fantasy VII, you have to wait for your combat gauge to recharge before you can attack. One segment full and you can shoot, two full and you can lock-on, three and you can go beserk. Also, you can move around during combat to gain better angles at enemy weak spots (and also protect your own). Hitting these can take five times more energy off. Experience points are gained through battles and the rider and dragon can gain skill levels and develop. New to the Panzer series is the chance to dismount your steed. Playing a character called Azel, you can land in certain areas and explore on foot wandering around towns, even entering pubs and talking to locals. It's these sections that give Panzer Dragoon Saga its RPG feel, and they look awesome too. In fact, there's even a continuous time counter in the game, allowing you to return to areas by night. Keeping with classic Panzer controls, you can even bring up the sight to examine anything you see. Dismounting from your steed. This is where the new RPG exploration areas begin...

Showicient onsoles have always been famous for their role-playing games. And in Japan it can take just one top RPG to make or break a machine (Final Fantasy VII being a prime example). However, because of the massive task nvolved in translating the text of these games, only a small portion ever make it to the West.

MegaDrive owners however, had a brilliant different game, Shining Force. Now the circle is complete. Zelda is coming to N64, and promises incredible things. Shining Force 3 on Saturn though, offers no less innovation. And from what we know, it's going to be ace! MAKE NEW FRIENDS The name Shining Force reveals the game's unique selling point you lead an army. In the MegaDrive games you played a young hero, exploring a vast land meeting new friends. They then joined your force. The central piece of any plot developments was always a battle. Here you had to move your characters strategically to best confront the enemy. It then cut to one-on-one action scenes where blows were exchanged. Now these combat scenes are in awesome 3D. However, the emotion is guaranteed to be the same triumph when you smash an enemy character, and dismay when one of your favourites bites the dust.

You SCUMHA HA HA HA.MHH, PLEASE NO We were trying to keep a snowy theme to this months Checkpoint competitions, but unfortunately we could find any snowy titles from the PC games released this month. So we chose Starcraft instead. And even though this game has nothing to do with Star Trek, that is what the compo is about. To signify that someone is an alien in the Star Trek shows, all they do is change the shape of their forehead, which is rubbish. So we want you to draw what a Klingon's alien ass looks like. Err, that's it. Entries to: CLAGNUTS, LEFT OVERS AND KLINGONS STUDO WINNER! TOMB RAIDER 2 WINNER! QUAKE 2 And finally, the ultimate sequel. The mother of all updates to a classic game. Obviously Quake 2 wasn't as big an incentive as we thought because reaction wasn't as good as the other compos. Even so, the standard of the entries was still high on humour as the winner proves. A big thumbs up to Chris Reece of Ormskirk for Parappa the Massacre. We'll let the picture do the talking. STEEP SLOPE SLIDERS One of the most popular competitions we have run in Checkpoint also proved to be one of the most unimaginative. Designing a new boss for Lara is a simple thing in theory, but obviously not in practice. We has loads of Dana/Lana/Tara Croft entries as Lara's long lost sister returns to haunt her, and a couple of filthy ones that would require the mag to go onto the top shelf in order for us to print them. But, after much deliberation, we decided that the winner was Iron Arse from Martin Hughes in Liverpool. Well done sir, a copy of Tomb Raider 2 is one the way. HECKPOINT GHOSTS CHRISTMAS More snow antics. This time the Saturn gets a piece of the action with a worthy contender to Cool Boarders. With both games being released in the same month, we thought that it was only fair to give you the chance to win both. To earn yourself a copy of this game all we want you to do is this: design a CVG snowboard. Remember that snowboarding is the ultimate in cool, so your board has to be the same. The only condition is that it has to have CVG written on it somewhere. You should send them to: BOARD STUPID COMP. Mer Vis ON TE Bures Another popular competition this one, we gave you the chance to win the ultra cool Saturn Quake. You had to design an awesome weapon that beats the lightning gun and Quad damage and something to use it against. This was one of the hardest to judge as we had some stunning entries, but in the end we plumped for this one. A Christmas theme, linked to CVG and a bit of humour too. Top work to Patrick Divine from Essex for the drawing. Saturn Quake on it's way as soon as we can get hold of one. Send entries as soon as possible to: CHECKPOINT #195 FREEBIES, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES. 37-39 MILLHARBOUR, THE ISLE OF DOGS, LONDON, E14 9TX WINNER! QUAKE "

The follow-up Ple promises to be even bigger. ENDATIDY21 HHH BB533 VG RED uake 2 completely ignores the first game. It may never have existed for all it cares. No more dungeons, no more Cthulu-styled monsters, and no more clunky medieval weapons. Instead, we're on another planet battling evil marines and mad cyborg creatures with all the latest futuristic technology. id Software have kept unusually quiet about Quake 2, only releasing the occasional screenshot and snippet of information. The three-level test which we covered a few issues ago had many people worried that id had lost the magic that had created such classics as Doom and Quake (this magic could easily be named «John Romero\", the genius designer who left the team after the release of Quake), but the final version of Quake 2 will prove the doubters wrong. Totally wrong. Get to work, marine you've got some cyborg butt to kick! IBO IN SPACE NO-ONE CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM ( UAKE II You may remember that there was no plot to universe.

LISTEN UP REAL GOOD HEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE BEAUTIFULLY-RENDERED WALLS! ur Ly   The F1 button will become one of your best friends while playing Quake 2 as it gives you access to your marine's field computer. This computer shows what your primary objective is, as well as your current secondary mission is. Every time you complete an objective or enter a new area your mothership updates your computer to let you know exactly what's going on. The levels aren't structured like Quake's either. Instead of working through them one at a time they are grouped together to make enormous missions, a bit like the system used in Hexen 1 and 2. There are often multiple objectives to complete on each level, meaning that you need to travel backwards and forwards all the time. Each of these missions is massive, and takes ages to get through. open control panid Quake 2 is certainly one of the best-looking home games ever. It's now practically essential to have some kind of graphics accelerator (like 3Dfx or Power VR) as they add incredible coloured lighting to the levels, making them look more realistic than ever before as well as smoothing out all of the textures brilliantly. The animation and detail on all of the enemies and players is the best ever in a game of this type, and the scale of the levels is truly magnificent! You'd better get used to saying \"Wow!\" before you play Quake 2you're going to be saying it a lot. The coloured lighting adds so much atmosphere to the game. REVIEW Destroying the security grid is one early mission. This is a map of how the jail complex fits together. Down in the sewers of the jail complex there's a spooky blue glow everywhere.

"HYPERALLOY COMBAT CHASSIS, VERY TOUGH computer video games The enemies in Quake 2 look very much etter than those in practically every other Corridor game that's gone before it. They all move amazingly well, with animation that is many times smoother and more fealistic than the first Quake's, even though the models themselves are more detailed. The first enemies you come across aren't too threatening, but the later ones are going to give you a few problems. Here are some examples of what you can expect to meet in Quake 2. ROM ENFORCER BERSERKER These guys are common in the The Enforcers have chainguns Listen out for these guys first military base and replacing one of their arms. sharpening their spikes warehouse, as well as the jail A decent weapon will before you get too near sections.

The dying, sometimes into even more dangerous guards often take a few extra firing their gun about areas. Take them down from shots at you as they go down! wildly as they fall! long range if you can. Some of the enemies crouch to avoid certain attacks, like this. Just look down and take them out! GUNNER IRON MAIDEN Not nice. One arm unfolds to reveal a machine gun while the other fires four grenades at a time in very rapid succession. The best weapon for getting rid of these guys is the super shotgun. Long-haired men who attack by playing dodgy old heavy metal. Not really. It's a female cyborg with a rocket launcher for an arm! GLADIATOR This guy isn't too hard to take down, but his powerful Rail Gun can wipe you out in a single hit if you're unlucky. Keep moving and he won't be able to target you. The Big Flippin' Gun returns! The most powerful weapon in Doom is now in Quake 2 as well! These flying enemies have laser cannons on their shoulders. When hit, they spin around and lose control but don't go down straight away. Keep shooting until they hit the ground and explode just to make sure. . These are the most annoying.

It sprays everywhere when you gun enemies down. "


"computer Video games GET TOOLED UP Quake 2's weapons are very similar to the first Quake's, only with damage and power ratings a lot more like Doom's weapons! Here's the awesome arsenal you can get hold of on your way through the game. LASER BLASTER Your start weapon. Fairly slow-firing and very weak, but it never runs out of ammo. You really don't want to use this much. SHOTGUN The shotgun is found right near the start of the game, and is very useful on early enemies. But only until you get the super version. ROM These... things are extremely annoying. They float about, firing with the guns around their base. SUPER SHOTGUN Uses two shells per shot but does loads of damage when up close. Not much use from long range because of the way the pellets spread out. MACHINE GUN Fires quickly but isn't powerful enough against big enemies. Also, the recoil makes you lean backRAIL GUN The Rail Gun fires a single powerful beam of energy that spirals out like the gun in Erazer. Very, very, very slow firing and hard to use. GO BACKPACKING HAND GRENADES QUAKE II CHAINGUN Fires faster the longer you hold the button. Slices through any enemy in seconds, but uses ammunition like nothing you've ever seen! GRENADE LAUNCHER Lobs bouncing grenades which explode on impact, much like the one in the first Quake. This weapon has a brilliant reload animation. You don't need a grenade launcher to use your grenades. Twist the top to prime them, wait a second, then throw them at your target. Instead of instantly using an item when you pick it up, it is now placed in your inventory for use exactly when you want. It's possible to store Quad Damage power-ups until you reach a particularly tricky area, then hit Enter and let rip! There are also new items to use like the silencer and Energy Armour (it uses cell power to protect you from energy weapons). ROCKET LAUNCHER Fires powerful rockets which fly much more slowly than those in Quake. Useful at long distance against still targets. HYPER BLASTER BFG 10K A rapid-firing laser cannon. Very The follow-up to Doom's BFG powerful indeed but takes a while 9000! Fires a ball of green energy to wind down between firing bursts. which shoots out laser beams.

ROM 23 224 2ND OPINION The day before Quake 2 came out, I was still furiously playing multiplayer original Quake. I haven't played it since. Quake 2 is an incredi ble one-player experience. The Space Marine plot is utterly absorbing, with superb missions. And just wait until you find your lost companions by then you'll be totally immersed in the horror! As a deathmatch game though, I'm still undecided. The weapons are brilliant, but not as instantly gratifying as before. This is far more of a ducking around game. And the gib explosions have lost their gurgling satisfaction. But the thing with Quake is that it grows on you, and grows... so I'll wait until the free Deathmatch add-on. Bottom line though, is that you have to get into Quake 2 now! TOM GUISE The BFG 10K fires off multiple lasers. Ducking can be useful in deathmatch You can frag loads of people with one shot! mode. Here, Tom is avoiding a rocket! CVG OPINION QUAKE II Learn the weapon locations quickly if you want to do well in deathmatches. When another player is killed they drop their current weapon for you to pick up. LOADSA LOVELY LEVELS Anyone who's been reading our mag for any length of time will know how much we like Quake. Ever since it first came out people have been playing deathmatches all the time. The constant add-ons and unlimited scope for mastering the perfect gameplay mean that it never gets boring. But the standard one-player mode could have been so much better. Thankfully Quake 2 sorts out this problem straight away this is the best one-player corridor game I've ever played. It's non-stop action all the way through massive, beautifully designed levels. It's also got the plot and atmosphere to draw you right into the adventure. The graphics and sound are also incredible, making it more realistic than ever before. The whole game feels a lot like Doom rather than Quake with a familiar space station setting, very similar weapons and even a few textures taken straight from Doom 2! In fact, I think id would have been better off calling this Doom 3 rather than Quake 2. The multiplayer mode isn't as instant as Quake's, but has a whole range of new techniques for players to master, and I'm sure it's going to become just as popular in time. Quake 2 doesn't replace the first game it compliments it perfectly. With single and multi-player modes as brilliant as this, there's NO excuse not to own this game. Genius. 6D LOMAS The Quake 2 engine allows for far more detailed and complex levels than the first Quake. The levels stand out from one another because of their unique features, such as moving monorails, rotating gun turrets, enormous outdoor sections, destructible areas, laser mazes and so on. The jail levels are particularly cool as there are prisoners locked in the cells who stagger around moaning and banging themselves on the head! Very entertaining. Each level of Quake 2 has tons of features that'll make you call other people over to the computer! REVIEW NIGMEVET RATING The most exciting corridor adventure, and one of the best multi-player games around. It's the work of sick geniuses and you've got to have it. This giant cannon protects one of the courtyards. Shoot the gunner! These building exteriors are very impressive. They're great inside too. "


"NEJHERO ES HERO computer video games FIGHTING GAME BY CAPCOM  PRICE LIMPORT ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD AMB RAM CARI  RELEASED BY CAPCOM TEL IMPORTER SATURN OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS SATURN Prepare yourself for the ultimate battle! Marvel's mutant heroes go head-to-head with Capcom's Street Fighter legends! MARYEL TM ome say that it's a game too far. Some say that it's the most intense fighting game ever. Capcom have taken their Street Fighting heroes some of the most popular video game characters ever created and put them against Marvel's team of super mutants. The game itself is a follow-up to Marvel Super Heroes, which was recently released on the Saturn and PlayStation, with one difference in particular. Instead of controlling just the one fighter you pick a team of two who can \"tag\" one another as and when they need to, or they can team up for some of the most spectacular moments in fighting game history! A warning before you read on: The action in X-Men vs Street Fighter is so overthe-top that it could well melt your brain! * X-FIGHTERS VS STREETMEN * For the first time ever, there's some kind of story to a Street Fighter game, rather than the usual \"There is a tournament and people want to win it\". The evil Apocalypse has rounded up and imprisoned some of the most powerful mutants and greatest street fighters in order to create the ultimate army. Cyclops and Ryu join their two groups together the X-Men and the Street Fighters and set out to rescue their captured partners. But Magneto, the enemy of the X-Men and M Bison, the power-mad dictator have also teamed up with more sinister goals in mind. What a load of rubbish. THE VARIABLE HERO BATILE SYSTEM! * * PRESS START PRESS START There are 16 regular characters in total eight X-Men and eight Street Fighters. Akuma (Gouki in Japan) is also available by going to the top of the fighter select screen and pressing Up You can pick any two fighters to make up your team, who have a selection of new team techniques available to them. VARIABLE COUNTER The Variable Counter is similar to Street Fighter Alpha's Alpha Counter. When you are attacked, block the move then roll the d-pad from Back to Down and press both Hard attack buttons. Your first fighter will defend the move while their partner jumps in and hits the opponent! The Variable Counter costs one whole level of your super bar. PRESS START 16700 REVIEW VARIABLE ATTACK At any time during the fight, pressing the Hard Punch and Hard Kick buttons simultaneously (Z and C on the Saturn pad) activates the Variable Attack. Your current character will pose briefly while your resting fighter jumps into the arena feet first! Once they've landed, they pose before continuing the fight in the place of their partner. This is the main new technique in X-Men vs Street Fighter, as it lets you get out of trouble quickly as well as rest your weakened fighter. When you get hit, your green energy goes down just like every other fighting game, only this time a red section is left at the top of your energy bar. If you rest a weakened fighter, the red section of their bar slowly changes back to green all the time that they are waiting, adding a lot more strategy to the fights. ETE PRESS START VARIABLE COMBINATION, DANSE As long as you have both members of your team and at least two levels of your super bar, you can perform the Variable Combination. By performing a standard fireball motion (rolling the d-pad from Down to Forward) and pressing the two Hard attack buttons you'll call your partner into the fight. Both of your characters will charge up their super moves and attack at the same time, doing enormous amounts of damage if they connect! These moves provide some of the most spectacular fighting game moments ever! 76 "


"* LIKE REAL LIFE, BUTIN 2D! WHO PUT THE RAM IN TE RAM-A-DANG-A-DING-DONG? computer Video games all! Fights take a maximum of three seconds to load and there's no delay whatsoever when switching fighters. Also, the animation is definitely the best we've ever seen in a home 2D game. As an added bonus, the 4Mb RAM cartridge works with any games created for the 1Mb cart. It was announced a few months ago that Capcom were to start using a new 4Mb RAM cartridge with all of their new Saturn arcade conversions. X-Men vs Street Fighter is the first game to use it, and it has to be said that it provides INCREDIBLE results! The cartridge itself doesn't have any game information on it (unlike the cartridge SNK used for King Of Fighters 95, which had background and sound effect data), instead it just gives the Saturn more space to load the game information into. There was no way that a stand-alone Saturn with its 2.5Mb of RAM could handle four detailed characters at once, but with 6.5Mb power it has no problems at SATURI The animation in X-Men vs Street Fighter is incredible. Street Fighter fans will immediately notice how much more smoothly the characters move straight away, as all of the frames from the arcade version are included. X-Men characters such as Juggernaut have always suffered when translated to console, but this time there's nothing missing. Instead of a strange Moonwalking shuffle that he normally does, Juggernaut strides across the screen in X-Men vs Street Fighter! There's new animation for every character as they've been given extra mid-air attacks, dashes, Advancing Guards and so on. The backgrounds are a lot more basic than previous Street Fighters, but when there's this much going on in the foreground you can forgive Capcom! NEW HERO ELSDE NEW HERO SUGER ANGE LITA'-yo SSERIUTURN * SHINKUU... HADOOOOKEN! * LEVEL As you'd expect, each of the characters in X-Men vs Street Fighter has at least one super combo attack. They're easier to do than those in the Street Fighter games, normally requiring just one fireball motion with two punch or kick buttons. When you do a super combo the game pauses briefly, the Screen darkens and a picture of your character slides onto the screen while your charge up your move. The attacks themselves are completely over-the-top just take a look at Chun-Li's super fireball and you'll see what we mean! And an added bonus for all you Akuma fans the Instant Hellish Death Strike (\"Firecracker\" to normal people) only requires one level of super energy instead of the usual three! NEW HERO TUTE W HERO RBG ER HERR YES HE: WINS NEW HERO THIT These are like powered-up versions of original super combos. EVET NEW HERO NEW HERO NEW HERO NEW HERO REVIEW As you perform a super combo, your character's portrait appears as they charge up... Then throw out some amazing special effects! The moves are more dramatic than ever. 77 "


"computer video games CHANGING OF THE GUARD * One of the cool little additions that speeds up the fights is the Advancing Guard. It's simple to do just block an attack then immediately press all three Punch buttons at the same time. A green barrier will flash up and you'll dash forward, pushing your opponent back and giving you time to hit them! It doesn't use any super energy and works in a similar way to Street Fighter 3's \"parries\". Only not as useful. LAM. THE. APOCALYPSE At the end of Arcade Mode you reach the bad guy himself... Apocalypse. Although he doesn't look too scary to begin with, he soon grows to three screens tall! You need to attack his head and arm while avoiding laser beams bouncing from his satellites as well as his hand attacks. When he gets his drill hand out you're in for some serious damage! To be honest, Apocalypse is a disappointing final boss as he looks like something you'd expect to find in an old Mega Drive or Super NES game. He looks like a bit of a knob waving his arm around with a spiky ball on the end. Zb LEVA The Advancing Guard keeps the speed of the fights right up. THIEVING ROGUE 10 WINS TIME NEW HERO Rogue is one of the new members of the X-Men to be added to Capcom fighting games. While she's a good character overall, she has one move that is particularly cool — the power snog! A reverse fireball motion and Kick makes Rogue rush at her opponent, kiss them and steal one of their special powers! For the rest of the fight, a fireball motion and Kick gives them a taste of their own medicine! NEW HERO 7574401 PRESS STAET LENE LEVEL 70 WINS NEW HERO NEW HERO NEW HERD PROGRE 159740/ TITE PRESS STATY LEVEL Snogging Ryu gives Rogue the ability to throw his own enormous fireballs back at him!

"JIMS WHERE'S THE PLAYSTATION VERSION GONE? computer Video games X-Men vs Street Fighter has been on Virgin's PlayStation release schedule since the 1997 E3 show, but there's still no definite word on how Capcom plan to convert it. Will they use an upgrade similar to the Saturn version or will they cut the animation down greatly in order to get everything running at a decent speed? Well, the latest thing we've heard from our spies indicates that PlayStation X-Men vs Street! Fighter may be a one-on-one fighting game without any of the team modes. Hopefully these rumours will turn out to be wrong and Capcom will find a way around the memory problems. Sega are planning to release the UK Saturn version in March with the 4Mb RAM cartridge included. Hopefully we'll get a good PAL conversion this time. SEOA SATURI EW HERO NEW HERO STREET FIGHTER FREAKS: A CHALLENGE Here's a challenge for all you Street Fighter maniacs out there: Figure out exactly where in the Street Fighter storyline X-Men vs SF fits. You may want to consider that Cammy is still brainwashed and working for M Bison, but Chun-Li is wearing her Street Fighter 2 outfit with the spiky bracelets, not the younger outfit she wore in the Alpha games (although you can select her Alpha costume by holding Start). But Ryu is wearing his white headband and Ken has the red hair tie, as they did in the Alpha series so they must be before Street Fighter 2. But they didn't know of Cammy before Super Street Fighter 2, except M Bison who was her boss and boyfriend. And everyone has loads of specials that they didn't have in Street Fighter 2, so they must have forgotten them by the time they got to that tournament. But Chun-Li doesn't know the Spinning Bird Kick here. And... uh, where do the X-Men come into it? And Apocalypse? Ummm... explain that if you can. 500 wale PRESS START CVG OPINION GUJKI GUKI BLANKA VS BEAST? MAYBE.. Capcom have included some cool extras which are very easy to collect. If you're any good at the game you'll soon be able to play with infinite super bar power, and a team made up of two versions of the same character. As it becomes possible to have a fight between four of the same fighters, you also gain two new costumes for everyone. Some of these costumes are pretty strange, like Zangief's blue skin/red pants outfit and Magneto's blue and yellow X-Men uniform. You can also count on at least one hidden fighter, but their identity is still a mystery. Many of the backgrounds contain characters from other games who aren't included, such as Blanka warming his hands on a campfire; and Dan, Shuma Gorath, Psylocke, Beast and others stored in pods behind Apocalypse. Maybe there's a way of playing as one of them? Capcom have some of the best artists in the business working for them. All of their games look fantastic, and X-Men vs Street Fighter is the most incrediblelooking 2D game ever! The new 4Mb RAM cartridge is unbelievable, letting the Saturn replicate the CPS-Il arcade board perfectly with practically no loading times at all! The animation on the characters is fantastic (except Cammy, who looks a little ropey in places) especially considering how big they are and the speed they move. Although the tunes don't sound as good as previous console Street Fighters, they are done by the Saturn's sound chip and change instantly when you switch fighters! XMen vs Street Fighter has never really been anything more than an entertaining diversion, and although the Saturn version doesn't improve on the arcade game it seems more exciting, just because of the way your console's being pushed to the max. I can't wait to see what Capcom do with Street Fighter 3 and Vampire Savior on the Saturn now! X-Men vs Street Fighter isn't as polished and balanced as previous Capcom fighting games, but it has a ridiculous overthe-top feel that will appeal to fans and casual gamers alike. Marvel Super Heroes and Street Fighter Alpha 2 are definitely better buys than X-Men vs SF, but it's got a charm all of its own. More than anything, it proves that the Saturn's got some great stuff coming up later this year. ED LOMAS Look! Blanka's sitting by the fire. Ha ha! Hey and there are loads of other fighters in the pods, including two X-Men we can't identify! Uncanny! EW HER IEW HERO NEW HERO REVIEW RATING Not Capcom's best fighting game, but still one of the closest arcade conversions ever. The 4Mb RAM cartridge is great news for the Saturn. 79 "

EA's money spinning license get's another airing on PlayStation and we're here to provide post-play analysis. ROAD TO WORLD CUP lith Fifa now established as one of THE biggest brand names on PlayStation, one thing has remained constant. The titles have been getting progressively worse, culminating in FIFA '97. However, the newest game in the series looks like finally stopping the rut, and adding a smidgen of credibility to the ailing license. Although still not in the game league as Actua Soccer 2 or ISS Pro, it seems Fifa has turned a corner. The presentation is still top notch as it always is, and graphically it's impressive too. But this means nothing if it plays like a dog. RTS www.ca.com FUJIFILM Giler a drid MS PHILIPST-MasterCar 20M HITILNE SWEET AS YOU LIKE DUCKIN'AN'A DIVIN' L EITA ROAD TO WORLD CUP Something that still continues to let FIFA games down, are the sweet spots where you're guaranteed a goal every time. Not only is it the king of cheese to stoop as low as scoring the same goals all the time, but it takes the fun out of any close games, because you know you can always use them to get yourself out of a hole. FIFA now has instantaneous tricks that you can pull off at the touch of a button. Pressing any of the shoulder keys makes your player perform a variety of tricks, that prove to be pretty useful. The number of times you hit the buttons also determines to skill. For instance pressing a paddle once makes the player swerve away from an oncoming player, and tapping it twice will make the player spin over the ball to try and confuse the opposition. INSTANT REPLAY SNICKERS PHILIPS Tale Cam CVG OPINION INSTANT REPLAY PHILIPS JVC JVC Tole cas First things first, this is miles better than the awful '97 version. But it is still some way short of Actua Soccer 2 in terms of look, playability and most importantly realism. The first thing you notice is that it is ridiculously easy to score. After sussing the controls, I found myself winning ten-nil every game which is pretty boring to say the least. On the plus side, it's much more, responsive than the original making more flowing football possible and players do actually shoot the moment you press the button. But at the end of the day, it doesn't feel like you're playing football. You can run the length of the pitch and score, you can practically break someones legs and the referee doesn't blow and Everton are pretty good in it. Something must be wrong then. STEVE toeg INSTANY PEOLAY Tolo Con PHILIPS JVC JVC REVIEW RATING 6 RATING 000 1 England pick up the ball in midfield, and knock it through to Wrighty. He runs towards the opposite post and just as the 'keeper approaches, he knocks a low shot under him into the opposite corner. Yawn. 1 Ronaldo picks up the ball on the wing a proceeds to make tracks towards the opposition goal. Getting into a crossing position, he cuts inside before unleashing a fierce shot into the top corner. 12-0. Oh dear. It improves significantly on the last version, but the same flaws that have appeared in every Fifa games are apparent here. 80 "

When they release FIFA on one format, they go the whole hog and release it on everything else! Cue more crap football gags about Everton... ROAD TO WORLD CUP e're always a little dubious when games arrive in the office for us to review and by the time the magazine has appeared in the shops, the game is already out. This smells like games companies admitting the fact that their title is rubbish to us. FIFA titles are one of the prime examples, but this time around, EA were assuring that these versions from their classic license we're a lot better. No doubt you've seen the PlayStation version reviewed on the opposite page and suffice to say, this follows much the same path. Read on to find out why...

This basically takes the form of the complete competition for the Jules Rimet trophy. Whatever team you choose will be put into the same group that they have just finished competing in (so England go in with Italy and Georgia for example) and you play all of the group games. Then, if you've qualified, you move onto the first phase of group games which are randomly generated by the computer. Finally, you move onto the final knock out stages of the cup, and hopefully the final. Of course, there are the standard playing options as well, like Friendly games and League matches, but the World Cup option is the newest. ROAD TO WORLD CUP TOOOO The longer you hold down the button, the further the kick goes. The paddle buttons add swerve too. COC by CVG OPINION THE WIND OF CHANGE Having booted up FIFA, the first thing most of you will do is head straight for your favourite Premiership teams. If you find yourself getting a proper pasting, every time you use them, and want to change that then you can alter each of the players attributes in your team. Every player has ratings to determine shot quality, speed, stamina and such like, which you can tinker with. Although you have have to take off points before you can input them, if you reckon the stats are unfair, change them! It may seem like a trivial point, but if it means creating exactly how you think your team plays, it's worth having. The reason this scores the same as the PlayStation game is simple. It's virtually the same game. Having played the PS game to death, and worked out the \"sweet spots' on the pitch for scoring, turned on the N64 version and scored exactly the same goals. The first time I played it I won five-nil followed by an eight-nil victory. That in itself is very disappointing, but all the same little annoying bits are here too. It's still difficult to get decent headers going, and the control on those seems to be lacking too. It is good fun, and no doubt after all of you rush out to buy it, I'll get letters trying to prove to me otherwise. But at the end of the day, ISS 64 still wipes the floor with this and then some. STEVE PES F FUJIFIUS Player Edit REVIEW One legged football didn't take off. Acce diren Hess ACC JVC wave Puisto RATING RATING 1 Where else can you make the best English striker into a sack of cack? Other than FIFA, try Goodison Park. Full of poo. It's good fun and certainly a lot more responsive, but FIFA '98 still lacks a fair degree of realism. Could have been a lot better. 81 "

Bloody Roar is the game for you! BLOODY ROAR RPIE CUPILLEDER | A VERITABLE BEAST e previewed this game a few months ago when it was called Beast, though this has now been dumped in favour of the original Japanese title, Bloody Roar. Thankfully Virgin completely avoided the tragic American name of Beastorizer. But whatever name it goes by, the idea is still the same a fighting game featuring warriors who have the power to transform into massive battle animals! It borrows many of the best features from other popular fighters and puts them all into a highUnder your energy bar at the top of the screen is a second bar the Beast Bar! As you fight, speed combat game with a twist. it fills up, and before long the word BEAST flashes onto the screen. The bar continues to fill, but you can now transform into your beast at any time by simply pressing the Beast button! Once you become a beast, the bar When playing with the Rave option on you can gamble your goes down whenever you're hit, so time your Beast Energy for temporary extra power. While you're a transformation to get the most out of it. beast, pressing the Triangle button turns Rave mode on, making your Beast Energy run down quickly. During this time you flash and have more powerful attacks than usual. Another good reason for using the Rave is that you get a fancy special effect when you finish someone with it! RAVER TO RAVER 12Laren RALE RALE 35 PREGLETAS BLOODY ROAR ALICE GADO RAVE Pressing the Punch and Kick buttons when in the air lets you recover and land on your feet, just like Fighting Vipers. The explosion you create when you transform can blow your opponent right across the arena! DON'T PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS CVG OPINION CHAMPION TH RALE 347 GADO RAVE Bloody Roar is very easy to play. You have four buttons Punch, Kick, Beast and Rave. The fights take place in arenas surrounded with walls, though it's possible to knock the walls down by smashing your opponent into them really hard. Once a wall's been destroyed it's possible to score a ring out victory on that side of the arena. Combos can be strung together easily, and floating attacks (where you knock someone into the air and juggle them with more hits before they land) are possible in the same way as Sega's arcade fighting games. Bloody Roar came as a real surprise to us here. It sounds like a terrible, tacky idea and doesn't look particularly stylish, but it's actually lots of fun to play. The controls are simple and the moves that aren't listed in the manual are fairly easy to figure out. The combo system is very similar to Fighting Vipers or Fighters Megamix on the Saturn, with floating and corner combos playing a big part. The characters aren't particularly memorable, but look really solid in the game, and the movement of most of the beasts is great. Bloody Roar is mostly a novelty game, but fighting fans will be able to appreciate the amount of effort that's gone into balancing it out. Lots of fun. aloMAS REVIEW CHALLENGER RATING RATING An unusual idea that's been done really well. Bloody Roar will appeal to arcade fighting game fans as well as more casual gamers. 82 A standard option lets you play with big heads or in kids mode. "

Though there's one area that no-one has dared tap into. One that could make some of the most exciting games ever made. We're talking the MOB! Gangster movies have been pouring out of Hollywood since James Cagney was a baby. Along the way we've been treated to Edward G Robinson, Humphrey Bogart and in more recent years Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Yet games makers shy away from this rich source. Imagine the possibility of being a gangster, of mob wars and drive-by shootings, of drug deals and getting a message from the Don. Robbery, extortion, racketeering and kidnapping. The possibilities are endless. If only more would follow the example made by Grand Theft Auto, because in this game, you get to do all of the above! OVE 93801 y THEFT WHITO North Cleo Wood ITS DIFFERENT HONEST! If you think the PlayStation already has too many driving games, you won't be prepared for the rest of the year. GTA leads this field of new racers with a number of innovations. Unlike other driving games, there aren't circuits to zoom around. Instead there are whole cities so big that the game comes packaged with maps to prevent 114500 you from getting lost! You don't pass checkpoints and cross a finish line, here you complete levels by accomplished missions notching up huge points in the progress. Once you clock a level's set target, it's onto the next section. Sounds pretty cool so far. So why did people try to ban it? For the answer read on.

Of course, the mob don't make a living helping old ladies cross the road. Instead it's crime with a capital C and you're their new driver. You'll build notoriety fast by completing the mob's missions, and these range from small-time pick-ups to deliveries. That doesn't sound exciting, but when it's picking-up bank robbers, drugs and weapons you'll understand why GTA is unlike nothing else.

We were having so much fun, look at our bill. DO NOT PASS GO DO NOT COLLECT  The action is viewed from overhead, courtesy of the DMA newscopter. Depending on your speed this view will zoom in and out, allowing you a perfect view of your surroundings. You're not limited to just stealing cars. If you want an easy life you can hang around at a station and wait to ride the subway train. This isn't like the Ridge Racer games either, where you can't drive on the pavement. In GTA it's almost compulsory. Freeways, alleys, pavement and even parks. In GTA everything is there to be driven in and on. If you're feeling really bad you can stop running people over, and just get out of your car and shoot them. There are weapon and bonus crates littered around the city. Smashing them open reveals hidden goodies. These range from weapons and armour, to police bribes and getout-of-jail-free cards. Basically, anything you wanted to do in a driving game and weren't allowed to before GTA lets you do it. Since being blown away by the PC original, I've been waiting for this, believing the gameplay to be better suited to a console. With the addition of the PlayStation pad it's a lot easier to control. There are some minor differ, ences to be wary of though. Obviously the graphics don't have the gloss of the 3Dfx enhanced PC game, but the issue of speed is quite important. Sadly, some cars in PlayStation GTA aren't as fast as before. I'm not sure why, because some of the really fast cars still go really fast. The frame rate is also a bit low, which makes the graphics jerk around a bit, especially when driving over bridges. The final difference I noticed is one concerning memory. In the PC game you can steal numerous cars and park them in a convenient place to pick-up later. Here you can't use the same tactic, as soon as you enter another car, the one you've just left disappears. A pity. If you're looking for a different type of driving game, this will still impress with its brilliant gameplay. If you can live with the graphical shortcomings, I urge you to give it a spin. Playing the Ridge Racer series will never quite be the same again. ALEX 4UTALA REVIEW | RATING RATING A few differences from the original make this a slightly weaker GTA. If you like driving games, and are fed up beating lap times, go and get this now. 85 "

Sony hope this will be the answer to your prayers. 1476 CODBOUDRE EP systems the makers of Cool Boarders, must be big fans of our new Melting Pot section. For if we'd put together a wish list of everything we could have wanted in a Cool boarders sequel, they seem to already have thought of it. Their powers of telepathy must be staggering. Cool Boarders 2: Killing Session, is believe it or not, the sequel to the hit original. Featuring mountains of new features and tricks to learn. There's loads of new riders, more clothes to choose and sweeter music. Like the original, there are tons of secrets to find, but now with double the amount of courses. It's bigger, badder, better. If you don't believe us go get your brain tested. SERS YOU'RE A COCONUT NE GET OFF MY MOUNTAIN COIBOY The main criticism aimed at the original was that you could only race solo, and we all know you can't have a race by yourself. The immediate improvement over the original is that you can now compete with other boarders. No more racing against a ghost of yourself though you can do that too. There are eight competitors who want to win the championship, and nine courses to race on. 'Snowboarding Combined' is the name given to this championship event. So called because you must compete in a jump contest before each race. The jump contest determines your starting place in the race. Boarders start the race at timed intervals, but even if you start first, if you mess up on the jumps, your chances of finishing first are slim. For players who enjoyed the more leisurely aspects of the original. you'll be wanting to visit the Free Ride section, here it's one boarder versus the elements that each course throws up. You can also challenge a ghost image of your best time should you so wish. All the courses from the Snowboarding Combined section are available to beat, with the challenge being to get the best time, trick and total score on each course. Should you do this, some of the game's many secrets will be available to play.

"C EALMYSNOWFLAKES! computer video games COOL PlayStation Should you get tired of merely competing against the computer controlled riders. you'd better start playing, the two player head-to-head mode. Again, any course, is selectable to race on, with the screen split vertical, ly to accommodate both players. There are a number of ways to compete in this event: You can select rules for each race, these include who is the fastest, who has the best trick score and a combination of the both. A trick boost is also included to spice up the races. The bigger the trick you perform on a jump, the faster you'll go. Unfortunately, the two human-controlled boarders can only race against each other, and not compete in the Snowboarding, Combined championship. TISKO TRICOT BAPS \"OOL INCOOL BAC LIP 20 FAKIE BACKSIDE ALLEY O0P 720STALEFISH CRIPPLER! DORO 350 FTS REALLY WANNA SEE THOSE FINGERS The next event is for those who just love to perform big tricks. The Half Pipe is a place to get big air, perform Cripplers and McTwists while trying to impress a panel of judges. This is the event to really take advantage of Cool Boarders 2's new control system. Tricks are now put together with combinations of presses on the four shoulder buttons. These combos can also be stringed together to perform some pretty unbelievable stunts. The half pipe is a lot bigger than you'd expect in real life, but don't let that ruin your enjoyment. 1 It's a little slower than the one-player game. TOAST TO If those additions weren't enough, there's even more. The next two events range from easy to frighteningly tough. 'Board Park' is an area to carve up and just do tricks. There's no score, system as such, just an indicator in the corner of the screen that says cool, and gets bigger depending on how you perform. There are lots of objects to jump over or on here, including abandoned cars, barrels, and planks of wood. The toughest section of the game is the Masters' mode. Here you must perform desig inated tricks on a huge seemingly never-ending course. The challenge is not only one of supreme finger dexterity, but also a mental one, too having to remember lots of button combinations. This event is on a limited timer, but for every trick you successfully execute, ten seconds is added to the clock. When the timer goes, you receive your grade. CVG OPINION CEO 1 Two-player racing is another great addition. BAS REPLAY ALLEY OOP There aren't many games that you'll still go back to after playing them a million times. The original Cool Boarders is one. It isn't the most advanced or fastest racing game on the PlayStation, but it has a lot of charm. The sequel builds upon everything that is good in the original, and adds a lot more besides. The size of the game is the first thing you'll notice triple that of its predecessor. Plus the improved controls allow loads more tricks. There are lots of different events to play here more reason to come back again. Only one criticism, which is that Boarders 2 has the same basic look of the original, complete with the same short-comings, and slowdown on some corners. Killing Session faces intensifying competition from rival companies, especially in the shape of Steep Slope Sliders. Though for my money this is the better racer, with Steep Slope a close second. If you bought and enjoyed the original, you should go out and investigate this straight away. ALEX HUTALA These people have climbed half-way up a mountain to view this awe-inspiring moment of action. REVIEW 1 beker RATING RATING de 0 CESTA VORI Triple the size of the original, with loads of cool new features. As sequels go, this is one of the better ones. The new CVG team board.

STEEP SLOPE SLIDERS nowboarding is something that everyone wants to do, but most people never get round to it. They all watch Board Stupid and buy clothes that make them look like boarders, but never actually fork out the cash to do it for real. This explains why snowboarding games are so popular. Cool Boarders was the first 32-bit console snowboarding game to be released in the UK and it sold very well, even though it wasn't particularly brilliant.

Steep Slope Sliders has the same feel, but it's so much easier to play. Trying tricks is loads of fun as you don't need to worry about messing up if you make a mistake in Cool Boarders you stop and roll on the spot, which gets really frustrating. The movement of the characters is great as well, as they lean into corners smoothly as the game view leans to make it feel more like, you're really there. The game's pretty basic but is a lot of fun, especially when you're trying to find all the possible trick points in order to beat the top scores. Unfortunately, the PAL conversion isn't too hot so only the fastest of the characters will give you a speed rush (most Saturn owners should have a 50/60Hz conversion by now anyway). Steep Slope Sliders is certainly more basic than Cool Boarders 2. but is lots of fun indeed. en JOMAS REVIEW 900° bart flip tait mosebonel to nose crab 553 pts SSS's controls are very simple: A makes you jump, B makes you grab your board (hold directions for different grabs), C makes you flip, write the Land R buttons spin you each way. To perform a trick simply find a ramp so that you can get some decent air, jump at the end and press whatever combination of buttons you want before you land. Messing up tricks doesn't slow you down anywhere near as much as in Cool Boarders, and you can even carry on sliding down the snow on your back if you make a mistake.

It went from being the best set of golf games around to being rubbish. Unfortunately, no-one has bothered correcting this problem over the years and the 1998 update is still not any better. The biggest problem by far is that it's so slow. Okay, so golf games are always slow but not like this. The power bar goes up and down quickly (although it judders all the way) but once you've stopped it to set your shot it freezes to load the next camera view. The time between pressing the button and your shot actually happening is normally about five seconds.

And what goes for Seven Kingdoms on the next page, also goes for this. It doesn't take the type of game on any drastic steps, but is bloody good fun to play. The thing you'll find most difficult when you first play 2140 is the controls. However, as with all games of this nature, once controls can be used without thinking, it opens up to become a deeply involving game. The placing of your buildings seems to be a lot more important in this game, as I unintentionally mucked up a whole level by blocking off a supply route to a truck!

The graphics are excellent, with very detailed cars and lots of nice touches (such as lens flare that actually looks good).

Yes the 11,000 square miles of photo-realistic scenery look nice, but thanks to this realism you are restricted to flying in the San Francisco Bay area. Before you go anywhere though, you have to get familiar with operating the radio. The game requires you to constantly update your progress to various airfields along your journey. The biggest shame is that the fun level, that was so evident in the original, just isn't here anymore.

Although many of them just don't have the same classic feel that original games in this field like Command and Conquer had, they still churn up enough decent ideas to make the game worthwhile. Seven Kingdoms fits nicely into that category. You start by choosing a race of people in which to command and are given a town. The usual mining of elements brings money to erect new buildings and research weapons. You train your army, and link trade routes with neighbouring towns to sell what you're mining.

Add any kind of gameplay extras you like, but the facility to turn corners at an angle of more than 20° must be present. A fair representation of gravity is also expected, which would allow drivers to control speed over hills, and not go flying into the air like a yo-yo. With gravity in effect to some realistic degree, this prevents sailing into buildings at the top of hills. For a videogame to have fantasy elements, that's fine. But games should always play fairyou should have a fighting chance to begin with. You don't get this with San Francisco Rush. In fact San Francisco Rush flies in the face of so many standard practices, it's offensive. It isn't fun. It isn't cool. It isn't fair.

The animation of Turok himself is pretty good, but the basic enemies look terrible. Also, the smaller enemies just trundle from left to right, walking through Turok and damaging him on the way, even when they're hit. As such you end up slowly edging towards their boundaries and attacking as they walk away. This gets very boring.

ED LOMAS  PRICE $39.99  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  PUBLISHED BY EA  TEL 01753 549442 The tense race atmosphere is really helped by the dodgy American rock singer in your boot.

"RPG BY PSYGNOSIS COMPLETE omputer video James MAR RELEASE 1 PLAYER PlayStation NEW GAMES ALUNDRA 1998 is going to be a good year for games, that's for sure. If you still need confirmation of the fact, just take a look at all the hot games we've got this issue! Happy New Year! ...................................................................... ntil recently the only BY MIDWAY straight conversion of the hit Japanese RPG. Psygnosis acquired the game to test whether the UK will be in a state of RPG mania, following the success of Final Fantasy VII. If this proves popular, they will develop their own original RPG. Alundra is very much in the Zelda mode. The star of the show is Alundra, a character that possesses the power to enter people's dreams. He helps those that suffer from nightmares by battling the evil within their dreams. Featuring more than 50 hours of gameplay, Alundra should be a biggie. 60% CORRIDOR GAME COMPLETE APR RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS 60% PC SOCCER SOCCER BY BMG BUBMG ] COMPLETE QUAKE 64 Playstation ROM JUN RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS SOCCER game without a proper name at the moment, but already it shows early promise. Made in America with help from Dino Dini the inventor of Kick Off this features a full roster of international sides. Some strange features in place at the moment include commentary by the players on the pitch themselves. Rather than have a TV commentator, the players shout out common footie phrases such as 'man-on' and will call for the box. Foreign teams do this in their own language. Each team also has a star player, who is basically better than everyone else in the team. We've also heard that this might be licensed as the official England squad football game, and could feature the three lions emblem as the cover of the box. The deathmatch levels are in! 3028 2 PASCA version of Quake 64 we'd played was a one-level demo. Also, it was only a demo of the first boss level the smallest level in the game. Thankfully the whole first episode is now complete, and it's very impressive indeed! The graphics are similar to GLQuake on the PC (the version which uses accelerator cards like 3Dfx), with smooth textures and the orange glowing ball which surrounds explosions. The levels have been changed slightly in places, with small sections left out, but new patches of coloured lighting added to make the game look brilliant. The resolution of the graphics is also surprisingly good when compared to other Nintendo 64 games like this. The enemies are in place and, even though their look has bee simplified slightly, they still look very good. When work was first started on Quake 64 it was said that it would have to be cut down in size to fit it on a Nintendo 64 cartridge. The first episode has one level missing (the fourth level in case you're interested) but it'll be interesting to see how the final three episodes come out. Their levels are generally a lot bigger than the first episode's and may need to be shrunk even more. The most recent version of Quake 64 has a two-player split-screen mode in place, but it's hoped that up to four people will be able to play in the final version. Also, only one level currently works (DM1, the smallest deathmatch level) but it moves around at a decent speed. We'll have a full preview of this potential smash hit as soon as possible! HARD One-on-one deathmatches on Nintendo 64! Should be great! ENDO WRESTLING BY ASMIK MAR RELEASE 164 PLAYERS NEW GAMES FIRST LOOK AT HOT NEI SOFTWARE! WCW VS NWO WORLD TOUR : his game made us laugh. You get to use over 40 wrestlers from WCW and NWO, as well as Dead Or We've had a good play on Alive and Independent Union this as it's now out in the Wrestling. US, and laughed the whole There are loads of moves and time this is almost techniques to master, with a surprising certainly the best wrestling number of counters available, letting you game there's been, though cancel and reverse all sorts of moves on that's not so hard to your opponents. You can also play with believe. We'll review the four men in the ring at once, double game as soon as we're certeaming against one another as they go. tain about the UK release. SHOOTING GAME BY ASC GAMES 90% COMPLETE Playstation FEB RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS ONE scrolling shoot 'em up in the Contrastyle, from new boys ASC Games. One is the story of John Cain, who wakes to find his left arm replaced by a metallic gun. He is also suffering amnesia. His only emotion is rage. The action is fast and the enemies tough. Cain also has a rage meter which when high can allow you to access more powerful weapons and combos. Just like Contra there are also huge assault vehicles to use in your mission. There's five levels of action, three levels of difficulty, and of course a guy called John Cain. We must mention the graphics, which are excellent. Major desruction is the key as you blow giant billboards and bits of buildings away. 96 As you can see, the new coloured lighting adds loads of atmosphere. ighting adds loads of atmosphere. "


"SPIED ARMY GAME PC BY ZOMBIE GRMY GAMECYZOMBIE HOCKEY GAME Les obremen BY GREMLIN 60% COMPLETE Computer video games SPRING RELEASE 1 PLAYER MyStation ROM 1-4 PLAYERS ROM APR RELEASE SPECIAL OPS ACTUA ICE HOCKEY This is a cool sounding game. You control a crack group of hardcore soldiers from the US Army Rangers in missions around the globe. You will have to take in part in missions like search and destroy targets, hostage rescue, reprisal attacks and counter attacks. The programming team behind it, Zombie, have created their own engine for the game and are promising great things from it. Soldiers have been motion captured as well to provide ultra realistic movement. A proper war game in the privacy of your own home. The latest in the Actua series is also the first to branch out into the ice hockey market. It features all of the classic features that have become almost a trademark with these games now. Superb attention to detail on the stadium and player animation are also very cool. All of the teams from the NHL will be included and players stats will of course be as up-to-date as possible. Early indications show that Actua Hockey plays well too, but we'll be able to bring you more next month. 21 30 ADVENTURE BY SLAM SUMMER RELEASE 1 PLAYER PlayStation ROM MONKEY HERO COMPLETE HOCKEY GAME BY GREMLIN APR RELEASE 1-4 PLAYERS onkey Hero is a new title from recently-formed Il developers Slam and looks like being a 3D adventure, in a similar style to Zelda on the SNES.

According to the people at Slam, it will feature over 2500 screens to play through, 16 dungeons and 14 bosses. Have a peek at these shots and we'll feature more next month. Playstation N20 01237496 0 1132476 his new shooter from Gremlin is the new project of oldI skool developer, Tony Crowther. You control a spaceship hurtling through a tunnel and you have to shoot everything. Coins are dropped by dead enemies that will increase speed once collected. You also have various special attacks that can wipe everything in your path. The most impressive thing about N20 are the lighting effects. The pictures show just how mad and spaced out the game is, and it also has a cool soundtrack. This could turn out be be a good one. 1., LARA CROFT =&RRESISTIBLE CR TOMBIL .

"computer video games COME! ENJOY A VACATION ON JUPITER IF ONLY BUT RIGHT NOW THE TECHNOLOGY TO LIVE ON OTHER PLANETS ONLY EXISTS IN THE VIRTUAL UNIVERSE OF GAMES LIKE G-POLICE OR HAS IT BEEN IN THE ARIZONA DESERT FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS! ne day Earth's gonna blow up and the human race will be wiped out. Unless that is, we can colonise other planets. Yep, our continued existence lies on the surface of Pluto, flying jet jeeps around inside giant bubble cities, while eating strange alien papayas and meeting sexy women with weird foreheads. The future, ladies and gentlemen! And it's in our grasp already, because mankind has already constructed a self-sufficient planetary environment. Not a city, but a whole world ecosphere once inhabited The Biospherians a group of scientists branded as a cult. With only one airlock in or out, Tom Guise, entered this Futuropolis. Lovely pair of lungs. BIO 2 HDS BIO!2 EARTH IS NO LONGER YOUR ONLY CHOICE OF HOME! THE GENESIS PROJECT Covering three and a half acres of the Arizona desert. Biosphere 2 is a mini-model of Earth. Inside, there's a rainforest, a desert, a wilderness, a savannah, agricultural fields and even an ocean complete with tropical fish and a coral reef. And it's all genuinely sealed off from our own planet, Beneath is a solid concrete basin and above is a triple-glazed space structure. Not even air can pass through. As such, it's powered by two giant lungs. Containing 26-ton rubber diaphragms that span 135ft across, these domes suck in and breathe out the enclosed air as it expands. Without the lungs. the Biosphere would literally explode! BIG 2 IPHdS HUMAN EXPERIMENT The 1 million gallon ocean. No hanky-panky in there, or fish-humans will emerge to conquer the dry world! In 1988, a human test subject -Vertebrate X was placed inside a 500ft sealed container for 13 days. He survived and the Biosphere project was deemed possible. Three years later, eight scientists entered the dome to live for two years. Crops failed and carbon dioxide levels rose, one member lost a finger off in a rice thresher and they all turned orange from eating sweet potatoes. They also stopped suffering any illnesses. Meanwhile, the founder of the project refused to reveal to the world any of the scientific discoveries made. In 1992, during a second mission, rebel Biospherians broke into the dome to stop 'The Cult'. Since then, no-one has lived in it. The Algae Farm. Scrapped from the ocean beds, this tasty gunk is 'reused'. ALL TRUE! FEATURE Inside a lung! That huge ceiling moves up and down as the Dome breathes! WERD TALES Controlled insect colonies were released into the dome. However, before the structure was fully sealed, native biting ants got in, proving horrible for the human inhabitants. Bizarrely though, these ants were destroyed by a breed of non-biting South American crazy ants (so called because they run around in no fixed direction). Bees too, died out within a month. It's believed that without the sun's ultra-violet rays, they were blind. As such, the plants had to be pollinated manually! Finally, bush-babies (like apes) broke into the Technosphere the factory beneath the surface and started eating the machinery. They had to be removed. Bernd Zabel Austrian scientist and director of the Biosphere. Mechanical arm just out of shot. INFINITY AND BEYOND? So could we one day live in on Mars? From this experiment, it wou seem yes. Indeed, the theory of terraforming even seems possible building enough domes on a planet's surface, then breaking the open to release an atmosphere. There's only one snag with Biosphere 2. The cost. A solar generator would be too expensive to construct and currently its electricity bill is  million a year. 98 "
