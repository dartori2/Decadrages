"WORD UP! appy New Year! Here we all are, back after the Christmas break, and what a festive frollic of a time we've had! 1992 saw some massive changes in the computer and video games business, the consoles scene REALLY happened, the PC became widely regarded as 'The Next Big Thing', CD got a toe in the door and, of course, CVG became bigger and better than ever before! But what about '93? What are our predictions for the next twelve months? We reckon Sega and Nintendo will be fighting it out just as much, but with two new machines at the front line! Sega are all set to launch the Mega CD in this country and, if it does as well as we think it should, that might just force Nintendo's hand and hurry them along with the release of their own Super CD unit. The PC will continue to make big strides into the home leisure market, but it's got a real contender in the cut-price and just-as-powerful Amiga 1200 it'll be very interesting to see which machine wins that particular little skirmish! And don't forget the Colour Game Boy much-touted but not even officially in existence, the big N will probably give the hand-held an airing in 1993. And what about the world's best games mag? In the fast-moving market we're in, we can't afford to hang around so we're getting a new editor to kick off the New Year with. His name's Garth Sumpter, he's been in the computer games industry longer than any of us care to remember and he makes a full appearance from next issue, so we hope you wish him the best of luck he'll need it! And we'll be tweaking the pages of CVG in the near future too; so expect to see even more of what you already love very soon indeed! And with that, let me wish you an ultra-happy 1993! PAUL RAND THE NEW KID IN TOWNI WIN OVER  WORTH OF GAMES! Crikey oh blimey! There's a new editor in town next month and he'll be taking the controls of Britain's biggest all-format games flagship. We've not even met him yet but he'll certainly have to have some very special qualities (including a very wide bottom), in order to fit into ex-editor Tim's chair. All we've heard is that he's a long-haired rock and roller and a distant cousin of Blanka and will have more than a couple of shocks in store for us all. But, until he gets here we're just going to have to guess. Unless of course, you think you can help... Commit to paper what qualities the ideal CVG editor should possess. Perhaps he should have the reflexes of a cat so that he can beat Jon at Super Mario Kart, eyes like a hawk so that he can spot the boys as they try to sneak off to get on the Viewpoint arcade machine, or perhaps just a very loud voice so that he can get a word through the team's constant bickering about whose turn it is to go to the shop and score some grub. Just send your designs, pictures and blueprints to: NEW KID IN TOWN, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. Closing date for entries is the 14th of February, at which time, some priceless Picasso will win its creator, four top games. Oh, and don't forget to tell us what format you want otherwise you'll probably get some Spectrum games... cVG 008 "

"BIG NAME GAMES FROM ACCLAIM! NEWS STAR TREKKIN Ripley returns to the Amiga in Aliens 3, Acclaim's conversion of the smash-hit but rather poor final episode in the trilogy. As you can see, the game is moreor-less a straight convert from the excellent Megadrive version and, if programmers Probe get the gameplay right, Amiga owners have something special to look forward to in the New Year the 16-bit Sega version received a hearty CVG HIT!, after all! And while we're on the subject of Acclaim and the Amiga, keep your eyes peeled for the computer version of Krusty's Fun House! Again based on the console versions, the player takes control of Krusty The Clown who's got to rid his funhouse of cute purple rats, with the help of the Simpsons family and some quite bizarre killing machines! We've played the Amiga game and it's a spot-on conversion, with all the graphics and gameplay of the original in other words, you're onto a winner if you get it! Fancy a quick shufty at the latest from Interplay? Not content with cranking out marvellous conversions of French graphics adventures for the console market, they've also come up with their own original title! The Lost Vikings is the name, and it revolves around the fortunes of three Norsemen who've been nicked by aliens and travel through time, solving puzzles to get out of various scrapes. Featuring gameplay not-dissimilar to Mirage's Humans, The Lost Vikings should be with us in the next month or two. But if you're a SNES-owning fan of Kirk and his cronies aboard the Starship Enterprise, then Interplay have something coming in the latter part of '93 that's sure to make you go goggle-eyed and thank your lucky stars that you've got one of the best games machines around. Yup, they're converting the fabulous Star Trek The 25th Anniversary to cartridge! Originally a PC and available now on Amiga, Star Trek on SNES should be a spot-on version of the space-faring classic, mixing Lucasfilm-type adventure with apparently stunning 3D flight 'n fight sequences! It could be the business and we'll be keeping a watch on the game's progress! SAD MEN? NO MAD MEN! MY NAMETS BER You thought the CVG boys had an ounce of sense in them? You were WRONG! This month saw Paul Rand divert his attention from gamesplaying and City Pride shenanigans to help form the EMAP Images Dangerous Sports Club inaugural members Rand himself and ex-CVG Ad Manager Nigel \"Not Tall' Taylor! Off the pair trotted to Cobham in Surrey with a couple of well-dodgy geezers for a morning of madness and we've got the pictures to prove it! Now, bungee jumping isn't the safest pastime in the world, and these lads weren't happy about putting themselves between the wide blue yonder and a very hard concrete car park, but they'd forked out their forty quid a-piece, and there was no turning back. After a cry of *Three! Two! One! Bungee!', it was all over and the daring (or docile, whichever you prefer) duo both agreed that the experience was one worth repeating if you feel the same as this pair, you should seek professional psychiatric help as soon as possible! What next for the EMAP Images Dangerous Sports Club pirhanha juggling? COMPILATION CRAZY! Got a bit of Christmas cash left over and don't know what to spend it on? You could fork out the pennies and purchase this fine and dandy new compilation pack from US Gold! Called Raving Mad, the package contains three nifty little titles; Rodland which was originally from Sales Curve, Millennium's Robocod and Mega Twins from the Goldies themselves. Not only that though, buyers of the set also receive a free game from the Kixx budget label! The one we got in our box was Impossible Mission II not crap. You can get Raving Mad on Amiga and ST, for a reasonable .99 check it out! THE BUNGEE BOYS IN ORDER (L-R): NIGE THE NUTTER, PERILOUS PAUL RAND, GARRY THE FLYING PUNK AND PHEARLESS PHIL. THREE! TWO!

"TOTALLY NUTA NEWS 10 Here's a game that you may not have heard much of, but we have! It's called Mr Nutz, and it's from Ocean. A platform-based romp, the player guides Mr Nutz the squirrel through the woodlands, getting up to all manner of crazy antics. And how do we know all of this? Basically, because Ken from Ocean can never resist showing us the bloody thing every time he comes to the EMAP office! There's no doubting that this is one seriously well-presented slice of action, with some terrific sprites and very colourful graphics generally. Trouble is, we still haven't got hold of a playable version of Mr Nutz! But don't worry when we do you'll be the first to know, in the form of a CVG Review! MAY BAT'S BACK! FORCE BE WITH YOU Can't wait to see the new Star Wars games X Wing on PC and Super Star Wars on Super Nintendo can you? just to keep your whistle even whetter, Lucasarts have just announced more games based on Luke, Darth and company and they're as hot as you could comfortably manage! Star Wars 3D is on its way to Mega CD and features, funnily enough, threedimensional dog-fighting on a grand scale! Defend Tatooine against Imperial Stormtroopers, take on massive AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth even take on the infamous Death Star attack run! Featuring full-motion video (cripes!), Why can't Batman ever star in a good film? The first one was dark and bland, while the second was...practically the same, except this time round, non-ugly, Kim Basinger was replaced by fit Michelle Pfeiffer. 'So what is probably the question on everybody's lips; well, all this Bat-related nonsense revolves around the imminent release of Batman Returns on the NES and look, here's some hot-off-the-press pics of the game in action! It's a beat 'em up in which you control Batman through a variety of scrolling levels, using kicks, punches and more. The game seems a bit of a giggle, but to be perfectly honest, it didn't seem all that far removed from the conversion of the Turtles coin-op, but with different graphics. Still, we'll find out for sure when we review Batman Returns in an issue coming to you soon! ORIN DINO'S DONE A BUNK! Now here's something which may surprise you! Dino Dini, creator of one of the finest games ever seen Kick Off has left Anco and joined Virgin Games. No great shakes, you might think, but what of the supposedly imminent Kick Off 3? Did the great man manage to complete his latest creation before the big move? And what about the rumours flying around that Dino's first project for his new company is a soccer game? We're following this one could turn out very interesting indeed! CVN 012 "

"GOING LIVE! or three days in December, the video games industry and its mum shuttled off to the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham and invited the public to experience the greatest games event ever seen! Gamesmaster Live was its name, around seventy-five thousand people packed into the hall overall, and everyone reckoned that the bash was a massive success! Read on and find out who was there and what was happening at the most ambitious video games show EVER! CAN YOU STAND THE EXCITEMENT? ocean ocean doen ocean Everybody who is anybody was in attendance at the show, and the stands they'd built there were impressive, to say the least. Ocean had constructed a gigantic video wall on which they showed snippets from a variety of top movies that they'd licensed over the years, as well as a whole host of games challenges. US Gold (Blend) not only had an arcade full of Streetfighter machines to promote the home computer versions of the cracking coin-op smash, as well as a sumo wrestling mat on which you could battle against a pal, dressed in a rubber sumo suit (!), they also brought along a massive Waltzer-type affair which kept the crowds amused for the duration of the show! Virgin's purpose-built Quazar Lazerdome pulled the punters, as did EA's Road Rash Challenge set-up (especially considering they were giving away  leather jackets to any, one who beat the challenge!). But perhaps the star of the show was the Sega stand which incorporated a six-hundred metre go-karting track! Lumme! GVG 014 "


"MYSTERI GAMES STER MEET THE GANG 'COS THE BOYS WERE THERE! LIE You couldn't have missed the fact that CVG was at the show in a BIG way giant posters proclaiming the fact were dotted all the way around the massive hall! Of course, the boys themselves were there too; for three whole days Rand's wrist was pushed to breaking point with autograph signings! In fact, all EMAP's mags made an appearance Mean Machines, Megatech. NMS, The One, CU Amiga, ST and PC Review all got in on the act! WHAT DO POINTS MAKE? CVG REPROBATE JON BILLINGTON MIXES IS WITH MEAN MACHINES' OZ AND A SMALL SCOUSER. IT'S BUSY STAND ACTION AHOY! LOADS OF YOU CAM AND CHATTED WITH US IT WERE GRAND! Gamesmaster Live saw winners galore walking away with stacks of prizes! Ocean gave one lucky ducky a copy of every single game the Manchester lads had ever produced together with every piece of hardware they'd ever written for! Virgin Games handed out a topof-the-range mountain bike to the successful finalist in the Mick And Mack Global Gladiators Challenge, compered by none other than CVG's very own Paul Rand! And speaking of CVG, we handed out the odd goodie or two as well; Scottish superstar Glen Urghart came all the way from Chilly Land to pick up his prize of a unique set of Streetfighter Il badges which he'd won in the compo which we ran with the help of Comet and The Sun, and the England team, led by ex-CVG Ed Tim Boone, sauntered off with an incredible trophy for beating the opposition in the CVG/Comet Streetfighter Championship! The spawny gets. IT'S THE GAMESMASTER STAGE! AND THERE'S DOM D, OVERSEEING THE STREETFIGHTER CHALLENGE! STACKS OF STARS! ExHIBITOR As well as the real stars the CVG boys a few minor celebrities found they just couldn't keep away from Gamesmaster Live! Gladiators large-person Shadow put in an appearance for a spot of muscle-flexing, while the Karaoke competition (which, sadly, Randy couldn't find time in his hectic schedule to attend he apologises profusely) was presided over by late-night TV unhappy person Nino Ferretto a free game to the first person who can tell us the name of the kids' TV show he made his name in. Both of these lads were totally overshadowed, however, by the appearance of none other than the big star of Gamesmaster Live Colin Curly! The jolly Quavers character showed his face to take on the public in the Pushover Challenge and lost! Oh yeah, Dominik Diamond was there as well, as well, along with his Patrick Moore-lookalike chum, the Gamesmaster, to commentate on the various gaming challenges on the Gamesmaster Live stand a huge reproduction of the TV show set! WHO'S THIS FAMOUS PERSONALITY, WITH A UNIQUE BOXED SET OF CVG STREETFIGHTER BADGES? WHY, IT'S GLEN URQHART OF COURSE, RECEIVING HIS PRIZE FROM CVG SLACKER PAUL RAND! SAD CELEBRITY SPECIAL! US GOLD Perhaps the saddest sight during the whole three days of Gamesmaster Live, apart from Paul Anglin, was the supposed appearance of Kim Basinger on the Ocean stand to promote their new Cool World game. Much interest was shown by the CVG boys, until they realised that 'Ms Basinger' was actually a look-a-like who bore more of a resemblance to Kim Wilde! Still, the kids didn't mind especially when she starting hurling out masses of freebies into the audience!

Batman Returns has you in the driving seat of the Batmobile, hurtling through masses of locations blasting baddies-a-plenty.

"LIE REVIEW MEGADRIVE BATTLE SIM BY EA .99 Where does a general keep his armies? Up his sleevies, of course! Low-quality jokes aside, there's very little to keep the strategists happy on the Megadrive until now. EA's follow-up to Populous, which first appeared on the Amiga, has a slightly more down to earth feel than its deity-controlling forebear. Rather than the lofty position of God, you are merely the ruler of a race of war-hungry soldiers, out for a good time and a bit of sword play. Your job is to point them in the right direction, and guide them to total domination in a world of feuding generals and massive armies. There's a planet full of islands to conquer, and a host of baddies to bash and goodies to befriend. Go for it the power could be yours! THERE ARE SOME GREAT STATIC SCREENS IN POWERMONGER FOR YOUR DELECTATION, ALL IN KEEPING WITH THE THEME. THE VILLAGE PEOPLE The ferocity of your soldiers' attacks, pillages and how many locals they conscript is dependent on their commander's posture setting. This is controlled by clicking on the sword icons at the side of the screen. If it's set to low, the troops will be a bit soft, avoiding killing people wherever possible and leaving them plenty of food when they raid. The medium setting bypasses the men's discrimination circuits and, as far as they're concerned, anyone who gets in their way deserves death. Finally there's maximum posture, which basically instructs the boys to slaughter everything they come across, steal theire food and have a jolly good laugh at the same time. EUREKA! I found Powermonger very difficult to get into. The temptation is to send your men charging into battle, pillaging the villages and crushing anyone who objects to your presence. Unfortunately, the game doesn't work like this and there are many slow periods as you wait for new weapons to be developed or for the enemy to lower their guard. That said, this is far more involving and playable than its predecessor, Populous. Conquering the later levels requires plenty of planning and the occasional risk. Populous was a much more basic affair so this knocks the spots off of that with it's depth of play. It's a pity Populous 2 hasn't been converted yet. If you can handle squinting to see the tiny graphics, and fancy a spot of megalomaniacal sword grinding, this is well worth picking up. STEVE KEEN GVG 018 Often you start a level facing seemingly-insurmountable odds, with your twenty or so men facing hundreds of enemies. In this situation it pays to work slowly. Some villages contain workshops which can be used to develop better weapons, and finding one of these is essential. To begin with, every soldier on the island is armed with nothing more than a crappy little knife. So if you can beat them in the technology race and discover pikes and cannons, your men will capable of steaming through enemy ranks without picking up so much as a scratch. THE GRAPHICS DON'T LOOK MUCH COP ENLARGED BUT THEY'RE BRILLIANT REALLY, HONEST! KILL, DEATH, MAIM The game world is divided into loads of small areas which have to be conquered individually. To begin with they consist solely of small, unprotected villages that are all-too happy to switch loyalties to you in the face of several hundred armed soldiers. After a few easy conquests, rival armies start appearing with similar goals to yours. When two armies meet they completely forget about the embattled civilians and set upon each other. Once one side loses a few soldiers and the odds start stacking up against them, the best course of action is to run like hell. Fortunately there are commands to accommodate this, although once an army scatters the remaining soldiers tend to wander off to their home villages, so they have to be recruited all over again. "


"REVIEW CVG BaBy, Although Populous is an undoubted masterpiece, loved and admired by thousands, I've never been one to really get into it it all seemed just a little bit too detached from reality. Powermonger, on the other hand, is much more my cup of tea. It uses the same graphic style as its prequel, which works very well and allows a lot to happen on-screen at once. The icon control system employed in Powermonger is much more user-friendly than that seen in Populous, even though there are more icons there they're just so much more easy to figure out. Rather like the game overall, really whereas you had to wade through the Populous manual before you had a hope of working out what to do, I was able to just pick up Powermonger and go! What we're basically talking about here is death and glory on a grand scale and there are so many islands to conquer you're not going to complete the game in a hurry. Recommended to everyone who wants a bit more 'oomph' in their console games. PAUL RAND STRATEGY SKILL THIS ICON IS GET FOOD SEIS DESISSE GREAT PRESENTATION IS EVERYWHERE AND DETAIL IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Someone, somewhere once said an army marches on its stomach, and that's true in Powermonger. Your troops have to be kept well fed, otherwise they nip off back to their villages. There are several ways to gain food to keep the lads happy; during autumn, just after the harvest, barns are usually stocked to bursting point, so it pays to send your troops to nearby villages to relieve them of their stores. Another good food source are the sheep which mill around most lands point your men towards one and they'll happily reduce it to so many doner kebabs. NOW THOSE LITTLE PEOPLE WILL PAY! GENERAL ACCIDENT ACTION REFLEXES you have GEEN SEFEATEC Commanding armies is a big job at the best of times, so it's fortunate that you can off-load some of your soldiers onto other generals. Although you start off on your tod, any enemy generals defeated in battle, faced with the alternative of execution, choose to join your ranks. When you've recruited one they can be given control of some troops then sent out on a conquering spree themselves. Alternatively they can be employed as spies; in this role they skulk off to an enemy village and relay vital information on troop movements. This is a risky business, as the penalty if caught is on-the-spot execution. GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 89 85 % 92 % 90 CVG HIL GVG 019 "

"AG GIE REVIEWS ry SUPER NINTENDO SPORT SIM ABSOLUTE ENTERTAINMENT $39.99 A MAZING ENNIS!  emember Wimbledon? It's that delightful place in London where it rains for two weeks solid in the summer and some bloody Yank always takes that lovely cup away with him. Okay, so this isn't a Wimbledon game but it's all tennis, So what's the problem? Amazing Tennis puts you in the shoes of a young hopeful in the world of spongy balls and ninety-year old umpires. You start off as a sad man and have to move your way up the ranks as quickly as possible. So pull on yer shorts and remember the golden rule of tennis that nice umpire is always right GRAAPAVINGG There are three different types of surface to play on hard, clay and, of course, lawn. There is actually more of a difference between surfaces than you'd imagine; the main one being the amount that the ball bounces on each. On a hard surface the ball will come off the surface very fast, making it a real pain to hit. Clay is the exact opposite and will slow the ball down_hideously, which makes for a much more technical game. Lawn gives the best of both worlds; it's fast but not that fast. IT'S ALL PART OF THE GAME The most fun part of Amazing Tennis, as with most sports sims these days, is the two player option but that's not the only style of play by a long chalk. There's also the tournament and a head-to-head with any of the SNES-controlled opposition. The tournament pits you against better and better players until you get knocked out or win the championship, the only bummer being that there's no password feature to continue when you switch off. THANKS... ..to Shekhana Consoles (081340 8565) for the Review cartridge. F locker Amazing Tennis really had it's work cut out if it was ever going to beat the current Super Nintendo king of sport sims, Super Tennis. It gets an incredible head start, with some of the most realistic graphics seen on a game of this type, but hey kids, as Aswad once said, \"Beauty's only skin deep\". Amazing Tennis manages to keep up its impressive start by coming through with very realistic gameplay and a wealth of different shots to play the timing of your swing has been captured perfectly to give tons of scope to improve your game by changing when you swing. The game lacks that special something to take it to the dizzy heights of its fabulous forefather, but an excellent piece of raquet action nonetheless. REPLAYS  INSTANTLY Amazing Tennis is the latest in a long line of sports games that has made use of the action replay option. The one seen in Amazing Tennis works a little different to most the R and L buttons act as a rewind option, and it automatically replays at slow motion.

"LUE 3 PAGE REVIEW MEGADRIVE PLATFORM 39 SHINOBITO BY SEGA .99 SUPER =999 22 89330 2-999 -3 2560 loe Mushashi isn't really the kind of guy you would like to cross swords with, as it were. He's been known to slice and dice the odd ninja at the drop of a hat and doesn't think twice about dishing out a fair sprinkling of Ninja magicrelated grief. Considering all this, it's a bit surprising that the Neo Zeed have put themselves in his firing line by invading the world. Silly people, eh? The Neo have taken over eight parts of the world, divided them all up into sub-levels and stuck a huge nasty boss at the end of each one. Well, our friendly sword-wielding ninja guy is having none of this, so he's took out his best sword, cleaned up his climbing boots and trotted off to kill some bad guys. Ain't war hell? BEEN AROUND THE WORLD Seeing as the Neo Zeed have taken over eight different parts of the world you can expect to see some pretty different scenarios. The action commences in an underground cave with lots of waterfalls and other such delights, then the action moves to a factory where Joe must dodge a few crushing machines and the odd conveyor belt. Later on you can expect to battle through such scenes as a huge airship, a genetic laboratory and later, the despicable temple of the Neo Zeed themselves. TOOLS OF DEATH CORROR ORODDARDOOR This must be one of the most eagerly awaited sequels in a long time. If this could go anywhere near matching the brilliance of the original Sega we're onto a winner. The question is does it? Errm no not really. As good as Super Shinobi 2 is it just doesn't have that awesome mix of action and graphical excellence that the first one was so full of. The graphics look a little better with some really topper backdrops and Joe himself has had a bit of a facelift and been given Ultimate War rior type arm-ties. Once again the music is absolutely superb with some really hard thumping rock tracks and some brilliant effects. Game play has been made a little more involving with some new moves and other treats but there's just something missing to make it a classic. As it stands Super Shinobi 2 is a very good game which is worth getting but you shouldn't expect to see the original beaten. Joe's main weapon is his ninja shurikens. These can be just thrown liberally around or, if you pull off a somersault and throw them at the same time, you can chuck a barrage of eight at a time. You can start the game with a maximum of ninety shurikens, but you'll have to go carefully with them and collect as many as you can, but if you're clever and can remember how you can use the cheat from the original you'll get yourself infinite shurikens. Good, eh? cvG 022 PAUL ANGLIN "


"REVIEW GUG ALL THE RIGHT MOVES Young Joseph has certainly been in training since his last outing, having managed to learn a stack of new moves to help him in his quest for, erm, killing people. Shinobi can now perform a double jump (a bit like that seen in Super Ghouls and Ghosts), cling to the wall so that you can climb up it, or you can swing from the ceiling in a Tarzan-esque manner. All these moves are very simple to pull off and are just a case of some nifty hand movements. The som ersault has remained unchanged from the first game, though. 6 LIFE: PUURI E999 -1 34810 LIFE: v=999 -3 72190 A MOST EXCELLENT GAME... There's no denying that Super Shinobi is a high-quality game with some incredible effects, especially when the ninja holds his sword up to the heavens and is drenched in purple ice, lightning, electrical US) energy and the like, but the back-drops, however well drawn, are very plain. Animation of the massive main sprite is also excellent, especially when he swings from the rooftops, and the guardians are awesome in size, detail and dangerousness. The tunes are tops too, so what's the problem? As platform adventures go, it's just so average. There's a real lack of baddies and, although the man is armed to the teeth, he seems to be all dressed up with no one to slice and dice. I'll stick to the recent Game Gear offering for my kicks! STEVE KEEN LIFE 1999 2 165 TAKE YOUR PICK -999 A-4 999 There are a stack of pick-ups to be had in Shinobi's land of wonderment and they're all of great use to your quest. All pick-ups are hidden in brown crates, and to get them you simply smash them with your sword and walk over them. The three most common collectibles you'l find are extra points, extra lives and the odd bit of magic lying around here and there. As in all his previous adventures, the boy Mushashi is well stocked up on his Ninja magic. This time he has five different types and here they are! 9999 = 4 14 Mijin: This sees Shinobi plant his sword in the ground and commit Hari Kiri! Although this takes away one life it causes huge damage to anything on-screen. 999 1-3 575, Fushin: Shinobi disperses his weight, which allows him to jump higher and faster. 999 -4 ikazuchi: When called upon, the magic of Ikazuchi creates a wall of lightning around Shinobi which protects him for up to four hits. Kariu: By calling upon the power of magma from deep in the earth. Shinobi can create walls of fire. Hakuriu: The power of the white dragon reduces the temperature, thus turning all the baddies to ice but the effect doesn't last long. GVG 023 "


"BUG REVIEW the Revenge of SHINOBI GUARDIAN GUYS PRESS START BUTTON 1992 SEGA Super Shinobi 2 carries on the trend set by the original by coming up with some massive bosses. The first endlevel baddy looks very reminiscent of the first one in the original game, but he's got more weapons and is dead hard, so who really cares? The second boss looks amazingly similar to Gazoo from the Flintstones, but he's a lot harder. From here the baddies go from difficult to nigh-on impossible and you'll be up against such things as a big mutated head and even the Neo Zeed themselves! Ninja antics in downtown city central WOW! Super Shinobi 2's been given a right boost with some extra moves, including gripping to the walls and ceilings, turning our master into a veritable Spiderman! The old ones have made a welcome return too, so there's no reason why this game shouldn't be a classic like the first! Well, to some extent that's not the case. The animation and sound are the dog's breakfast, but the game-play is not radically any different to the previous offering. Not that that's a bad thing, but you do come away from the game with the feeling that you've done it all before. If you've never had your mitts on the original Super Shinobi saga before, then this sequel is definitely the one for you this is a very good game. But if you're expecting a real stunna, wildly different from the first game, you could be left feeling a little flat. PAUL RAND SHINOBI KID IN SHADOW DANCE SHOCKER The Shinobi series has taken more twists and turns than possibly any other game before it. The saga began way back in '87 with the release of Shinobi the arcade game. This was a massive hit in the arcades and was then converted onto almost every home format known to man, with the PC Engine version being one of the best. The sequel came into being on the Megadrive; Revenge of Shinobi was an even bigger hit than the original and helped to sell many a 16-bit Sega. Then came a third Shadow Dancer. This appeared in British arcades at the turn of the decade and, unlike the previous two, was nothing very special. The inclusion of Joe's dog was a bit of a laugh, but that was about it. This was also later converted to the Megadrive and wasn't too hot on that, either. So now we have Super Shinobi 2 or should that be Shinobi 3? Or Revenge of Shinobi 3? Or Shadow Dancer 8?

When the words on everyone's lips seems to be Streetfighter 2, this one's kinda crept up on us. Sure, we knew it was coming and everyone thought that the original Streets Of Rage was an absolute monster, but nothing had prepared us for this!

We won't bore the socks off you with plot and storylines, 'cos let's face it, when you've got a product this hot who the hell cares! Get down to it! PTASTIC, MAE! JE 2492 Streets of Rage 2 is without doubt the finest scrolling arcade beat 'em up on any format Neo Geo included! Imagine taking Streetfighter 2 and dumping the characters into a horizontally-shifting arcade extravaganza and that's basically the result you get with this game. Sega say that there are 20 moves for each character and I doubt that, but what is certain is that there are more moves than you've ever seen anywhere else on a Megadrive game. There are three difficulty settings on offer and I'd recommend you give Easy a wide berth or you'll spoil your enjoyment by finishing too quickly. There's so much to do and so many combinations of characters and fighting techniques, the game will grow on you more each time you play. Music and spot effects are stunning, the animation is bladder-breaking and the variety and presentation put everything else that's come before it so far in the shade they'll need a map to find their way out again!

"REVIEW GVA GX53 t's sequel central this ish! Just like Super Shinobi 2, Streets Of Rage 2 has been hyped until breaking point but, unlike the ninja's second coming, the hack 'n' smack sequel has come out looking immensely better than the original! Streets Of Rage 2 packs a whopping sixteen megs of memory yes, as much as Streetfighter 2 and every little byte has been used to full effect. Sega have left nothing to chance with this cart everything about it has been polished until you can see your face in it! The hyper-violent gameplay grabs you by the throat from the very moment you pummel your first bad guy, and don't expect it to end there. Although the game's too simple on Easy setting, put it on Normal or Hard and you've got a hell of a challenge! The duel mode is a bit of a laugh and, although it provides no real challenge to Streetfighter ll, it certainly gives you a good chance to polish your sad scrapping skills. One of the funniest aspects of the game is Skate's special move; it's great to see a cheeky young shrimp leap onto someone's shoulder and whack seven bells out of them (watch out, Randy (Try itRandy))! After the slight disappointment that is Super Shinobi 2, this is just the kind of thing that Sega need! PAUL ANGLIN PALLET PARADISE WEAPON TASTIC MATE! The scrolling action takes place mainly from left to right, Final Fight-style but, on some stages, head-cracking takes place up and down diagonally across the screens too. The scenes change dramatically, the normal ghettos are Backdrops are brilliantly detailed and home to most of the action, but there are seedy pool halls, sawdust arenas, packed with plenty of interaction, dingy fog-filled warehouses and even a pirate ship to kick ass in! All these with objects such as vending! scenarios give rise to loads of different weapons that players can pounce machines, tables and barrels that upon for extra defence; dice opponents up with knives and swords and break shatter whenever anyone goes near skulls with lead pipes. All can be wielded by hand or chucked at opponents them. Simultaneous two-player great stuff action allows even more variety, as friends can grab and swing off each other for extra-lethal attacks! The screens are literally jam-packed with different enemy sprites, with punks, thugs, bikers, pirates and massive guardians all exquisitely drawn and boldly coloured. There's a huge Mohican bloke that comes at you on one stage who's even bigger than Max, and an electro whip-wielding pain mistress who lashes you into submis sion on the earlier levels!

"GVC REVIEW ONE ON ONE TWICE THE FUN As if packing in the action like sardines in a matchbox wasn't enough, the absolute crowning glory is the inclusion of a 'Duell round, that lets two players go head-to-head with any of the characters over all eight locations.

No messing Streets Of Rage 2 is the best fun you'll have knocking pixels about the screen outside of the Streetfighting arena.

"EVEN GUL CVG Don't remember any snakes either Watch out for that wall...doh! Never mind. BIRDICUS SPEEDICUS The idea's simple. The platforms are covered with multi-coloured flags just speed around the levels and pass the flags whilst avoiding Wile E. The flags come in four colours, worth 500, 1000, 5000 and 20,000 points depending! upon the hue. If you shoot off a cliff or are killed by any one of the dozens of traps or creepy crawlies you'll be returned to the level at the last flag you passed before dying. That's great, because it can be a real pain struggling with some of the trickier ledges and obstacles which took you ages to crack first time around. ROAD RUNNER'S Road Runner great! The 'Meep! Meep!' shouting bird is my all-time favourite-ever cartoon character of all time apart from Wile E Coyote, that is. And thought I was in for a real treat when the game started up; graphically it's brilliant, with character sprites that match the originals to a tee (even if the Road Runner's turned from blue to purple) and a whole array of animated sequences showing Wile E's various deaths! What brought me back down to earth faster than a coyote trying to run off the edge of a cliff was the gameplay; excuse me, but what the hell you doing turning this classic cartoon into a platform game?!Road Runner is all about speed, and although he can get up to some staggering miles per hour in the game, if he does he's going to miss all the goodies scattered around and basically finish each level straightaway. Graphics do not a game make, and although Road Runner is jolly enough, it has to be said that this is basically a waste of a potentially blockbusting license. PAUL RAND STRATEGY SKILL DATIVALE RALE FREE! BIRD SEED! ACTION REFLEXES Wile's no slouch either and on most of the levels he'll give you a fantastic chase for your money. It's not until the end of a stage though, that he starts to show his form and he begins to use his famous ACME paraphernalia. Climbing into balloons, throwing exploding planes, strapping himself to huge rockets and even dressing up as a pterodactyl to hound you across the platforms all go to make up Wile's repertoire! If you manage to avoid him 'til the end, you get treated to a great animation of the Coyote's fate. He'll fall off cliffs, blow himself up, get flattened by his most devastating creations and generally be crippled by anything from steamrollers to falling rocks!

"NES WHOOPS APOCALYPSE! SRATEGY BY OCEAN .00 So you've had one too many Lemming killed off, there's no point continuing because you know you can't finish the level and you just want to start all over again. A chore? No, there is a simple answer Armageddon! This handy little device wipes out all those annoying little creatures in a flash actually, more like a bang. After a five second countdown and a cry of 'Oh no!', the Lemmings shake a little then spontaneously combust! Sick but satisfying. WHY ON EARTH IS HE BUILDING A BRIDGE THERE? DOH! LOOK AT WHAT THIS LOT CAN DO! STARTS DREVELFUN W hat's small, stupid and throws itself off tall things just because its mates are doing it? A lemming, of course! These pitiful little creatures don't have much going for them or at least, they didn't until Psygnosis made them stars in what became one of the most important games ever. After a string of conversions, the greenhaired goons come to the 8-bit Nintendo to amaze a whole new audience! You control the Lemmings, who must escape each level before time runs out. The number you get and the amount you must rescue changes with each level lose one two many of the little blighters and you might as well throw yourself off the top of a ciliff! Whoever said that Lemmings were thick! Not these boys they've devised a number of skills to make their lives so much easier!

PAWS: Pauses the game, of course! e pode como oo oo CLIMBER: Allows Lemmings to crawl up sheer faces. BLOCKER: Stops other Lemmings from passing. DIGGER: Scythes through impassable obstacles. BURROWER Hack straight down through the ground. ARMAGEDDON: Destroys all the Lemmings. KILLER KRUSHERS AND KNASTY KNIVES As if the ineptitude of the creatures themselves wasn't enough, there's a variety of traps littered throughout some of the levels, especially the more difficult ones. Crushers squash the Lemmings flat; whirling knives slash 'em to bits; hangman's nooses string them up there are more, but they're too ghastly to mention. Suffice to say that, if you run into them, it ain't going to be a pretty sight. DON'T FALL ONTO THE HANGING THING! You've got to be a sad man not to like Lemmings. And you've got to be even sadder not to have seen it before it's available on practically every machine under the sun! Add one more to the total now, 'cos the game's been converted to the NES and it's a cracka! You really can't go wrong with the graphics in Lemmings, and Ocean haven't they've been recreated excellently, even if they do tend to disappear at inopportune moments because the Nintendo's a bit crap at sprite handling. They're cute, cuddly and hilarious when they die the lads explode into masses of pixels; all very tasteful. Gameplay is spot-on; fast and furious, especially when there's a mass of Lemmings all heading toward their doom and you've got to somehow rescue them! You all know the game and the NES is more of the same; brilliantly addictive, great to look at and just totally brill. And who says the 8-bit Nintendo is on the way out? CVG 034 PAUL ANGLIN "


"REVIEW GUE HARD SQUAD Never played Lemmings on another system before? Bit of a low-quality player anyway? Don't despair; Lemmings caters for you by allowing access to a number of difficulty settings Fun, Taxing, Tricky and the hardest of the lot, Mayhem. With each more difficult setting there's a brand new set of levels to confuse, amaze and stuff like that that's, of course, if you've got time to be amazed while your furry friends are dying in all sorts of nasty ways!

Who cares, so long as they're as goodlooking and playable as all the current versions have turned out to be! The NES incarnation is no exception graphiVcally the game is very slick, with those hilarious little Lemmings going about their barmy business in their own small but perfectly formed way. Mind you the Nintendo can, on occasions, through up a worrying flicker which obliterates the screen for a second slightly unnerving, especially if your lads are teetering on the edge of death only to disappear from view just at the crucial moment! This is a very playable conversion; the controls have been altered to make use of the extra buttons that ajoystick doesn't have, and while it takes a little while to get used to this new system, it soon becomes second nature. Ocean have done themselves proud with NES Lemmings if you have the machine, you can't miss this game! PAUL RAND STRATEGY SKILL AHH, ISN'T HE CUTE? REFLEXES % 85 OOH, CAREFUL! There aren't any cliffs to fall from in Lemmings but there are plenty of other hazards to get in the way of completing each stage!

"BUG REVIEW MEGADRIVE PLATFORM Elephant antics! Whatever next? Baboon Bananarium!! WHAT DO POINTS MAKE? BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .00 There are also a stack of things Rolo can pick up to help him in his quest for peace, justice and a nice family dinner on Sunday. There are stacks of bonus points all over the place, as well as extra lives and the odd special weapon (it's actually a hoover, but there you go). If you're lucky enough, you might also locate a piece of the map; these basically look like sections of puzzle which, when you pick them up, add to your map screen, making things a little easier on Rolo. 8000 That's it; Rolo's putting his foot down now. He's had enough of being called big ears and long nose and he's certainly had enough of having his mates and, most importantly of all, his momma taken prisoner. The evil McSmiley twins are going to pay dearly for this. But Rolo won't be able to manage this feat all by himself; he'll have to call upon his forest chums to help him out along the way. There's just one small snagette; they've all been pinched as well! But if he can rescue them then they'll all be eternally grateful and they can all live happily ever after. Hurrah! Tha:2:0 BOOD They're all queuing up for an elephant ride! Soortsoortgaad good gay It's not hard to tell that Rolo To The Rescue is programmed by the same people who created the James Pond series, but what is hard to tell is just how any game can be this good! Rolo screams excellence from start to finish in every department. Graphics are superbly cute, with the attention to detail at a max; / mean, no games character deserves to be as cute as that Bunny Rabbit! But Rolo's merits aren't purely cosmetic by any means. The deep and involving gameplay grabs you from the second you switch on, the first few levels easing you into the game before being chucked in with the real puzzlers. Some of the levels will have you sitting there for hours on end, trying to work out how to get him into the washing machine to shrink him down so he can get through the tiny gap. The only real problem is that there is no save option or even a password so all your hard work is gone when you switch off. Gumph! But Rolo is a great game that needs to be in you cart collection yesterday. A new Megadrive king has been crowned long live Rolo! I'M A SECRET LEMONADE DRINKER The special weapons that Rolo can pick up are all completely non-violent and a bit of a laugh. The first is the vacuum cleaner; if you pick up two of these, Rolo's trunk transforms into a hoover, allowing him to suck up baddies and spit then out again. Another good one is the lemonade found in the desert level. If you pick this up you'll be able to spit lemonade at the bad guys to kill them. See all completely non-violent, if a little unhygenic. There are loads of animals to help you. Use the rabbit for jumping and springing GVG 036 CVG 036 PAUL ANGLIN 100001 "


"OCTASTIC, ME EW FUL Woodland creatures in pretty settings. Have you seen anything cuter? and the sally smay Phant a DO YOU LOVE ANYONE ENOUGH? Now I know he's a mole, but be clean! Rolo's chums are many and varied and he'll need them all if he's to get his mumsie back. All of Rolo's chums can perform different tasks to help him out here's a quick rundown. BUNNY: OOOOOO BUNNY: As well as being immensely cute the floppy eared one can bounce like nobody's business which allows him to get to the higher parts of the levels. BEAVER: . . . . . . Thanks to his polka dot rubber ring the beaver can swim through water with ease which means he bring platforms back for the others to use as rafts. SQUIRREL: SQUIRREL: O O ONO This furry fellow can climb any wall or tree enabling you to get stacks of hidden bonuses. MOLE: MOLE: . . . . . . . . Although he can't see two feet in front of him Moley is invaluable for digging through certain platforms thus allowing Rolo entrance. Uggh! If this game gets any more cutesy I'm going to puke. At first I wasn't sure how much fun a game starring a cute elephant could be, but this is really smart. Rolo is such a cutey and the rest of the guys look like something from a Disney movie. Rolo is really involving and will keep you engrossed for many an hour until you manage to rescue all of Rolo's pals. The game is full of brilliant little touches like the way Rolo fills up with Helium in order to float up to the higher levels or the hilarious way he shrinks himself in the washing machine to get through small gaps. The only major drawback is that there's no battery saver! So you can play for hours and hours and lose all you efforts when you turn the machine off. Ea say that this is because it would have made the game more expensive which is commendable but I'm sure most people would have paid the extra fiver. As it is Rolo is a great effort that just missed out on being even better due to the lack of a password option and to be honest the elephant slips around a little for someone who's supposed to weigh the same as Jon's sad VW Polo. STEVE KEEN Now here's a crusty old geezer! STRATEGY SKILL TWO MILES AS THE CROW FLIES ACTION REFLEXES Rolo has to explore a massive area, so it's to his advantage to have a map handy. The map, however, only shows Rolo where he's been, but if you manage to collect some of the map pieces that are lying around you can reveal more of the surroundings and take the quick route through the fun. And, if you don't like walking, you can fly around the map to look at different parts by using the crow. There's no set route for each level it's just a case of getting to the end as easily as you can. GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 93 % 92 % 94 % 95 250DD CVG ca. 25000 SQ00 SHH IT'S A SECRET One thing that Rolo To The Rescue is not short of is secret rooms they're everywhere! Some are completely hidden and can only be accessed by just attempting to walk through walls. Others are indicated by a sparkling white light, but usually it's just a case of looking carefully for them. Some secret rooms can only be found by using certain characters, i.e. some levels can only be found by the high-jumping bunny. HIT GVG 037 "

So all you sensible people out there across 'It's based around Wings, and as for you're other question the best console is (%$#$, damn, zcvasdf my adsfiz/../l.cz key//board is *&%^&$ goin... funnyyyy...y...y. 1 Not as far as I know (and that's pretty far). 2 What do you think I am, psychic? 3 No chance on the A600, but if it came on the A1200 it just might be. 4 No. 5 I told you, I'm not psychic. 6 Quite probably. 7 Nah, I go to the geezer who does the Lionel Blair cuts. FOR CHRISTMAS Dear Yob Your section of the mag is brill. I have a few questions to ask you: 1 Will X-wing come out on the Amiga? 2 Will Lemmings 2 be any good? 3 If X-wing does come out on the Amiga will it be as good as the PC version? 4 Will Super Star Wars come out on the Amiga? BY Y Yo Yob, Thave just learned how to program in C and I am already halfway through programming a game for the Amiga and ST. It's called Kicking Yob's Butt and it's really good. You see it's about a tiny, wimpy, speccy four eyes who goes up against Yob. Guess what! It's impossible for the wimp to lose! "


"AILBAG the globe unite and join the MDSY (the Murder, Decapitate and Strangle Yob club). This could be a revolution! So print this letter or people all over the world will send, you their Des O'Connor records! Jonathon Day, Kent 1 Is it true that there is going to be a Gigadrive? 2 I have a choice of an SNES or an Amiga. Which of the two items should I buy? 3 As you said, Sadie likes men who ask her straight, so, Sadie, will you go out with me or send me some pictures of yourself? ago, not many good quality games are being made for it. 4 Are there any good games coming out for the A1200? Andrew Martin, Preston out there can stop squabbling, about how good the graphics are, Sure, graphics need to be good, but to own a console with games that have amazing graphics and zero gameplay is ridiculous. Gareth Morgan, Cheshire 1 Don't know. 2 See above. 3 Now be honest, that's not much of question. 4 We'll tell you when we see them. Ayo, High Wycombe Right. Let me get this straight. People who write into me are sad cases who want to be insulted, and you've written into me and I'm going to insult you. That should doubtless lead you to the conclusion that you are a sad, talentless waste of space whose ideal job would be sucking the pus from blisters at Dr McProctal's Bottom Boil Removal Centre. Well thank you said in sarcastic, tones). Do you think nobody knows that? Wow Gareth Morgan's sparked a revolution. Guess what, he's also discovered the toaster and that his head is full of the worst kind of yellow pus from a boily pensioner's butt. I'm truly sorry you live in High Wycombe, but what do you want me to do about it? 1 There's going to be a new Sega console, probably 32-bit, sometime next year. 2 Whichever one you want. 3 Sadie's to busy being a top international model, playgirl and computer game goddess at the moment to reply, but I'll pass on your request when I see her tomorrow night. ROGER PROBOSCIS.... Dear Yob Tread CVG every month and think it's the best magazine around. It's just a shame that you're such a sad, sad case. Answer these questions please. A TUBE OF ZIT-AWAY Dear Yob I am writing in reply to that bum 'scrubbing, puke licking Jamie Dawson (issue 133). Gee boy, you're pathetic. You say, and I quote, \"Amigas are so crap', well what do you own, an Atari 2600 console? You probably sit in your living room, thinking no one is watching you while chewing on a freshly picked bogey and watching Playdays. Have you ever stopped to think, if that is possible, that Amiga games are cheaper simply because there, are far more of them sold. So the only thing crap around here is you! 1 Which do you think has better graphics, Streetfighter 2 on the Amiga or the SNES? 2 What's better, an Amiga 500+ or an Amiga with 1 Mb upgrade? 3 Is Zool better than Sonic 2? 4 Are there any plans for Streetfighter Championship edition on the SNES or Amiga? James Heal, Halesworth 1 As I write this (on the 1st of December), I haven't seen the finished Amiga version yet. 2 Does it matter now that both machines are no longer? 3 Different games, different machines but I prefer a quick burst of Sonic myself. 4 Not as yet, but it is coming out on the Megadrive. CLAUDIA SCHIFFER Dear Yob You pathetic globule of parrot puke! If you don't print this letter unspeakable things are going to happen to you. Now let's get down to business. Daren Buckle, Norwich Have you ever stopped to consider that the Atari 2600 was a good machine in its time, and that you must be as crap as Jamie Lawson for slagging it off? THE BONEY-M MEGA-MIX Dear Yob I am thinking about buying an Amiga 1200 and I want to ask you a few questions about it. 1 What do you think of the CDTV? 2 What do you think of the SNES? 3 Will any of the Monkey Island games come out for the CDTV? If So, when? 4 What do you think of Super Tennis on the SNES? Mark Powell, Doncaster NEW LEATHER BOOTS Dear Yob I live in High Wycombe and I own a Commodore 64. Here are a few questions I would like you to answer for me. 1 Will Streetfighter 2 come out on the A1200? 2 If so, will the graphics be as good as the arcade machine? 3 My friend owns an A600 and is worried that, compared to a year ...GAME OF NASAL EXPLORATION Dear Yob After reading some of the letters from people saying how the C64 (Trystan Nichols) would blow away a SNES, I decided to write in. For starters I'd just like to tell all the people out there that a game isn't made good by it's graphics, it's the gameplay. So all you petty people What unspeakable things? Such as having my butt-cheeks glued together while I'm being force-fed, Ex-Lax? Do you really think I'll answer your questions after such pathetic insults and threats? Well. "


"you're right. 1 Never met the bloke. 2 Don't know him either. 3 Nope. 4 Top game. Not very realistic, but very playable. the next two months or so. 4 Would you like me to list them for you as well? Get real will ya? By the way, where do you get these Spectrum to Megadrive upgrade kits? help it if there are more topper games on the Game Boy than Game Gear in a particular month. As for seeing to it personally, I've given the Go! crew a damn good kicking, although I doubt if it will make the simpering wimpos any better at their jobs. 2 Do you think the Amiga version of Streetfighter 2 is any good? 3 How much would an English SNES cost in Hong Kong, and how much would the games be? 4 Will there be a Streetfighter 3? 5 Why is CVG so good? 6 Why I am so cool? Adam Phillips, Horley AND HER SISTER Dear Yob Your magazine is great and this is the first time I've written to it. Could you answer my questions? 1 When will Flashback, the followup to Another World, be available on the Amiga? 2 How much will it cost? 3 Do you think a half-decent version of X-wing will ever be available for the Amiga? 4 Is Curse of Enchantia any good on the Amiga? Paul Jenkins, Norfolk FROM TIGHT-WAD RAND Dear Yob I would like to ask you a few questions. 1 Are all the consoles having CD upgrades? 2 With the Capcom Streetfighter joystick can all the moves be accessed at the touch of a button? 31 am getting a SNES with Streetfighter 2. I'll buy some other stuff but is Zelda any good? Lee Molineux, Liverpool 1 Not with two buttons that do different things. 2 Compared to what? 31 doubt if any place in Hong Kong would stock UK SNES's as they're incompatible with the TVs over there. 4 If you check the news section you'll find loads of information about a truck-load of different versions. 5 Because I'm in it. 6 You're not actually, you know. unit. 1 Very soon. 2 Haven't got a clue. 3 Why? Don't you want a decent version? 4 Yup! A PAIR OF SOCKS Dear Yob I have a Spectrum which I'm upgrading to a Megadrive, and was hoping you could answer a few questions for me. 1 I don't imagine there's going to be a Master System or NES CD-ROM NOT THE GIVING Dear Yob 2 What? You mean you press one, I'm writing in with some really button and your character does all important questions I want you to 20 or so moves? I suggest you get answer. your ass back in school and learn 1 Is Streetfighter 2 coming out for how to phrase questions properly. the Lynx? 3 Zelda is a top-notch arcade 2 If yes, when? adventure. 3 Is Smash TV going to come out for the Lynx? JUST REMEMBER 4 Is there going to be a TV adaptor for the Lynx? IT'S... 5 Who, in your opinion, is the best Dear Yob Streetfighter character? I want to make a complaint about Martin Richie, Glasgow issue 13 of GO! I waited in anticipation for this issue and what did I 1 It's pretty unlikely. see? Game Boy, Game Boy, Game 21 already said, it's not likely to Boy and only two measly Game come out. Gear reviews. Compared with the 3 No to that as well. Game Gear the Game Boy's 4 Another no I'm afraid. pathetic. 5 The Blanka/Chun Li cross with I hope this won't happen again and mid-air electrocution and super I trust that you will see to the matter cannon ball attack (nb, this only personally. applies to the super-hacked Action Jo, Wiltshire Replay version). ROLL ON Dear Yob I think that you are really brilliant and the most amazing person in the world. CVG is the best magazine ever and your section is the best thing in it. Without you the whole world would be a disgrace. If it wasn't for your section I would have topped myself ages ago. I have never know anyone as wonderful as you. Jonathan Kafton, Kensington 1 Is there going to be a light gun for the Megadrive? 2 Are there any art programs for the Megadrive? 3 When will Streets Of Rage 2 be released? 4 How many games are there for the Megadrive? Mark Taylor, North Humberside But you don't know me. Listen, here's a little game called Get A Life. Try putting down your copy of CVG (I know it's hard) and going outside. Perhaps play a game of football, or go to the cinema. 1 What do you think the Menacer is? A fart in the bath? 2 There's Art Alive, which should really be called Ass Alive as it's so crap. 3 If it isn't out yet it should appear in The games we review depend on the quality and quantity that are available at the time, so we can't BUT THE RECEIVING Hey YOB! When Streetfighter 2 is released on the ST, Amiga and PC will it be possible to use Capcom's Streetfighter joystick or similar controller? Chris Goodwin, Stockport Fat chance. If you take a good look at the plug on the joystick and the socket at the back of the Amiga you'll see they're totally incompatible. NEXT CHRISTMAS! Dear Yob I'm from Leeds and I own a Megadrive. Can you please answer me one simple question? Is Streetfighter 2 coming out on the Megadrive? Some magazines say it is yet others say it isn't. Simon Harrison, Moortown THAT COUNTS! Dear YOB Can you answer my questions? 1 Can you get a two button joystick for the Amiga? Keep an eye out for Megadrive Streetfighter '92 around about February or March "

"THE GUIDE TO THE STREETS ADVANCED O TM TM STRATEGY MANUAL PART 4 Here it is! The fourth and final part of our incredible Street Fighter 2 Strategy Guide. Over the last four months we've told you how to beat every single character in the game on the very highest level, LEVEL SEVEN. To round off this guide we give you the two most diverse characters in the tournament. In the red corner the battling brawler and most favoured character around, Guile. Rumoured to be the best character of the lot, Guile has few weaknesses and many devastating strengths. In the blue corner the sad wrestler from Russia, the most difficult character to use as his skills are severely limited by his bulk and lack of speed. And at the top of the pile the last boss, M.Bison, is given the once over, striped and taken apart by every character to lay the crown on and complete your comprehensive guide. Rest assured these tactics work! The only thing preventing you from mastering the machine now is your lack of practise! But beating the computer is only part of the story, after that you'll have to get to grips with the unpredictability of human advisories. And remember however good you become there's always someone better, not least of all... the CVG BOYS! Get CRACKING! cVG 047 "


"Zangief is a true, blue-blooded patriot and many believe he has only entered the competition to glorify his country's stature in the eyes of the world by beating all-comers. He may be getting on a bit but the huge Russian is not senile yet and although he really does love his country he loves cracking skulls even more! His power lies in his brute strength, his weaknesses lie in his lack of speed, but once he gets his huge arms wrapped around an opponent you can bet your life it'll mean a one way trip to pain central. Special Combat Moves are the Spinning Clothesline and the Spinning Pile-driver. 25% 50% PUNCHES ATTACK RATINGS 75% 100% PUSHING JOYPAD FIERCE 75% 100% o 25% 50% HARD 75% 100% 25% 50% NORMAL 25% 50% KICKS 75% 100% FIERCE 75% 100% 25% 50% HARD 75% 100% 25% 50% NORMAL SPINNING CLOTHESLINE 25% 50% 75% 100% SPINNING PILE-DRIVER 0 25% 50% 75% 100% STREET GUIDE 2 "


"KILLER COMBINATIONS WITH TDI RATINGS (Total Damage Inflicted) 1. Throw a hapless opponent and then walk up to them and perform a well timed scissor kick to catch the fop under the TDI:45% chin. 2. Walking backwards leads opponents on, quickly catch them with a punch and drop down for a low foot sweep. As they get up grab them for a throw to complete TDI:51% B. Zangief's pretty slow in the air and on the ground, but he has one of the longest leg spans of any of the characters. Fly in with a jumping kick then drop down for a low sweep and TDI:46% crouch for a punch. BDBULL Jump backwards away from oncoming competitors and kick. Then crouch down and wait for them to come TDI:40% towards you and toss them over your head. 5. Killer Attack: Crouch down and scoop up an opponent and dump them over your head as they walk towards you, crouch kick them as they saunter to their feet and then catch them will the devastating scissor kick. TDI:59% WINNING TACTICS DHALSIM: Use the Spinning Clothesline for temporary invincibility from all of Dhalsim's most ardent attacks. The closer the rubber bandit gets the easier he is to grab for a throw. A subtle combination of throwing and high jumping kicks will introduce the Indian guru to the incredible world of Stunorama! KENRYU: A great combination for the karate kids is a punch followed by a low sweep then another punch or sweep and the scissor kick. Ryu's a real sucker for foot sweeps and is easily thrown. Ken's a bit tougher to get on his back, but keep an eye out for his biggest weakHONDA: Believe it or not, the sumo sad ness, a failed Dragon Punch and then wade in with whatever you can muster! man is extremely easy to throw. Chuck him at the beginning and follow up with a scissor kick or low foot sweep then retreat quickly and wait for him to walk towards you. Now throw him again! Jump back fast and if he jumps at you block and wait for an opening for a throw. Never jump in unless Honda is really begging for it! CHUN LI: The only way to beat this chick is to keep your distance! As you know by now she'll jump into the most dangerous of situations so be ready to move slightly to one side of her landing spot and then punch. Eight times out of ten you'll catch her with no damage to yourself inflicted at all. Throws are great if you can hang onto her BLANKA: Probably Zangief's toughest long enough, but don't get stuck in the corners. opponent. They're equally matched in the air and on the ground, but Blanka has the added advantage of being incredibly fast with a huge variety of defences and attacks. The only way you'll get anywhere near him is to try and grab the beast and choke him. With Blanka Zangief's very vulnerable in the air so you can't even jump in at him. Block block and block again. You don't stand much of a chance on level seven, but keep at it. GUILE: Well this is the fight we've been avoiding for four months. Guile, viewed by many as the most dangerous and versatile of all the fighting characters, with more moves than Warren Betty, and Zangief, the slowest most ambling hulk of a man the competition has ever seen. The whole guide has been tested on level seven for the ultimate in difficulty and there the Russian doesn't stand an earthly! The best you can hope for are a few good hits/sweeps and to block until the timer runs out, but it's going to be the toughest fight of the tournament. "

"GUILE Guile is the most feared opponent out of the eight international contestants. With a staunch military background Guile is an actual Vietnam Veteran and was captured by the Viet Kong during his tour of duty. He managed to break out with a friend and escape, but his buddy died in the treacherous trek back to civilisation. After making it back to the States he learned to pilot aircraft and control sonic sound waves. Now he's fuelled with hatred, due to the rough hand that life has dealt him, and all he wants out of it before he dies is to be the Street Fighting Champion of the World.

"ZANGTE SIGUE KILLER COMBINATIONS WITH TDI RATINGS (Total Damage Inflicted) 1. Whistle up a Sonic Boom by pushing backwards then push towards your opponent and half way through press fierce punch. Now complete the move as normal with the simultaneous pushing right and fierce punch movement for a double TDI:35% Sonic Boom. 2. Because Guile has to charge up his attacks you can charge them whilst he's doing other things. Jump towards an opponent and start charging for a Sonic Kick, chuck in a middle punch for good measure and land. Keep down on the joypad pressed and you can still punch, but after that finish the Sonic Kick move by pressing up and TDI:45% any kick button. Total carnage! 3. If you're up against a jumping opponent catch them with the Aerial Grab and when they've thundered to the TDI:39% ground catch them with a reverse spinning punch, 4. Killer Attack: Throughout this move keep the Sonic Boom left joypad movement powered up. Jump towards an enemy and land a hard punch, start the charge. When you've got your feet on the ground use a fierce uppercut. Now release the Boom by pushing forward and pressing fierce punch. To add the icing on the gateaux pull back and press fierce for a spinning reverse TDI:65% punch! Awesome! WINNING TACTICS ZANGIEF: Once again the big bloke doesn't disappoint us with his ineptitude. Anything goes here. Set him up with big punches to the face, jumping and kicking and finishing off with Guile's back breaking throws. Easy stuff, but you knew that already, didn't you! BLANKA: Jump in on him and set up a series of flying kicks to the head. Get close for throws. When he's down use fast punches and crouching jabs whilst charging up the Sonic Kick and then let loose. Before you know it he'll be stunned to death leaving you ample time for another jabbing extravaganza and those extra special Sonics! HONDA: Easy as beating up a very fat person with no clothes on! If he jumps in uppercut him, use a combination of fast and slow Sonic Booms and some throws as often as you can Honda is also easily duped by quick jabs and roundhouse back handers to the face so make sure your not too shy with the man mountain! CHUN LI: Simple. Varying speeds of Sonic Booms from a distance and uppercuts when she gets too close for comfort. You can throw her but be careful. This goes without saying for the Sonic Kicks which can be spectacular if you catch her in mid jump. DHALSIM: Jump towards the spindly warrior with fierce kicks and get behind him by repeatedly jumping over his head for throws. Beating India's finest is a piece of cake once you get into the swing of things and once you've established an attack pattern keep high and make sure you get in first! KOL @euGGION NIBALL RYUKEN: Once again Ken's strengths prove to be his weaknesses. He'll come in with jumps and Hurricane Kicks that are easily dispatched with well timed uppercuts, Dragon Punches that you can dodge and sweep and Fire balls that you can leap over and land counter attacks with. Watch out for his quick combos though, they come out of nowhere. If he trundles towards you throw him with medium punch. Ryu's a lot easier to handle! "


"M.BISON al Bison is the bad boy who everyone's got a grudge against. He spent the earlier years of his life as the ruthless dictator of Thailand and now he runs the massive Shadoloo drug and smuggling cartel from his secret base buried in the mountains. His henchmen were responsible for the death of Chun Li's father in China and he personally killed Guile's army buddy in Vietnam whilst they were escaping from the Kong. He has lived in fear of reprisals all his life so he's entered the contest to rid himself of his most ardent enemies once and for all. Somehow he's managed to pick up some incredible powers along the way. He channels massive amounts of psychic energy through his hands allowing him to throw fists of fire and spiral across the screen in a flaming body torpedo. Bison is incredibly fast and no other character has as many devastating moves or inflicts more damage as the dictator. BEATING BISON KENRYU: Dragon Punches though, don't use the same attack are your best defence and experts in more than a few times and never use that arena will have no problems. the Sonic Boom. However, miss just once and you're history. Jumping on the spot and kicking is surprisingly effective for a while, as is defending and uppercutting. HONDA: Honda has some ZANGER Once you get great combinations that work over caught out defending you've had it, Bison a treat! Jumping kicks and Bison's attacks are relentless! standing chops work great until the Keep high and kick. Throw someFlaming Body Torpedo raises it's times but as soon as the move is head. Then it's time to change pace finished take to the skies again. and hit him with everything you've You'll never win by slouching! got. Variety is the key to success. Jump forwards and backwards swatting and kicking the square one into next week. Don't use the Sumo Torpedo unless you want a quick exit! 313 BLANKA: The Brazilian beast_DHALSIM: Dhalsim is very packs some awesome power moves similar to Bison in quite a few ways. so keep clawing kicking and jumpHis Yoda fire can catch the fascist ing. Don't give him a breather and completely unawares sometimes and you'll get there in the end. High, fierce jumping kicks mixed with you can dodge Bison's deadly Flammedium/hard punches are the best ing Body Torpedo by using forms of attack. Dhalsim's own Horizontal Torpedo. Trap your enemy_in the corner and head-butt him into submission. Never jump up and kick, if you must, use the diagonal spinning attack or punch. Yoda Flame works a treat and sliding will reduce Bisons energy considerably as he jumps and lands. CHUN LI: Don't even think Body Torpedo coming a mile off and about trying to get off any special it's easy to jump out of the way. attacks with Bison on your heels. Keep off the ground and retreat som Chun Li's fast, but not that fast. You ersaulting and kicking as you go, can use the girl's speed to good You should be able to stun him with advantage though and it's her most high kicks and when he's down keep valuable asset in bringing Bison to him there with throws. his knees. You can see the Flaming, GUILE: Try and catch Bison with Sonic Kicks, he hates them. He also likes to shoot all over the screen and is not confined by the laws of gravity. If you use the Aerial Grab that'll thwart him for a while as will jumping punches and the occasional back-breaker. Be warned STREET GUIDE 6 "

"SEC. D = = . Campaign 1: Air Superiority Things to remember Before you try to take out an installation like the airfields it's worth destroying all the weapons in the area so you can work unhindered. There isn't really much that needs adding to the guide in the manual but to make things go that little bit smoother here's a few little handy hints: The item which speeds up the winch and allows you to pick up items without stopping is found in one of the grey hangars in the diamond road layout in the middle of the map (there should be armour there as well). Mission 1-1: Radar Sites The only thing I can really say is that if you position yourself right you can lay waste to the communications dishes without being hit. If you fly to where the secret agent is and then go left you should find Jake standing next to his F-15. Destroy the enemies then pick up Jake and destroy the plane for an extra life. Make sure that you've always got a few MIAs in your chopper so that if you get in trouble you can deliver the MIAs and get some armour back. Campaign 2: Scud Buster Mission 1-2: Power Station This will be your first run in with air-toground missiles. Try to sneak up on them from their blind side by coming in on them from the north and using the Power Station as cover. Once you're settled about three Hydras should be sufficient for the job. Mission 2-1: Radar Sites The radar sites are easy to deal with. Just make sure that you avoid the ground-to-air missile launchers and leave as soon as you have fired. CHEATMODE Mission 1-3: Air Fields Use the buildings around the airfields to try and sneak up on some of the Rapiers and take them out from long distance with a missile to be sure of safety. Use your cannon to destroy the buildings and the aircraft. But make sure that you're ready to tackle the new defences when thy arrive. Mission 2-2: Jail Break When you're performing a jail break make sure that you destroy all hostile forces before blasting a hole in the wall. Some of the buildings around the jails will have a flashing light on them. Blow these up carefully and rescue the MIAs that run out of them. Most of the buildings around the jail will have something hidden in them so it's worth blowing them up. Once they are exposed they will show on the map for future reference. Mission 2-3: Power Station This is very simple. Just take out all the weapons before you do anything and you'll have no problems you should be able to do this without losing too much damage. ze Mission 1-4: Command Centres When you take out the hangars on the eastern side of the base, APHIDS will appear so make sure your trigger finger is poised. Although on the map there are two command centres, you only need to take out the southern-most one to get the guy who knows where your secret agent is. Mission 2-4: Chemical Weapons The chemical weapons complexes are very heavily guarded so drop off any MIAs you may have to pep up your armour. It's best not to try and take out all at once but do one then fill up your armour and come back. There's a rock to the northwest of the chemical plants with a bad guy behind it shoot him and you'll reveal some fuel. Mission 1-5: Secret Agent Your secret agent will be marked on the map. When you get to the area you will notice three buildings. The secret agent is inside one of these. Blowing up the correct building will reveal a trap door. To get your agent out simply fly towards it and the chopper will land and your co-pilot will jump out to get him. The chopper will then take off again and you will have to destroy all the hostile forces around the area before the secret agent will come out. When he does come out he will be with your co-pilot make sure you pick them up quickly or they may get shot which isn't good. Once you have picked them up you can return to the frigate and put your feet up. Mission 2-5: Scud Launchers The scud commanders have decided to do a bunk so just fly to their HQ (metal buildings marked with a red and white flag) and blast the building down around their ears. When they run out, grab them and they will tell you the location of one scud launcher. These will appear as a red dot on your map. Simply fly to it and destroy it. Then repeat it until all the Scuds are gone. There are five in total. Mission 2-6:POW Camp This is the hard part. There are 16 POWs altogether and you only need to rescue 14 of them. Try to blast as much of the weaponry in the area, the watch towers are the things to get first. Be warned that whenever you return from the landing zone there will be new weapons in place so be prepared. Make sure you don't waste your Hydras on the huts. Things to remember There's another downed F-15 along the top right edge of the map. The pilot is Jake (he loves getting lost doesn't he?) and the plane contains yet another extra life. CVG 058 "


"STRIKE EE SNES Desert Strike Level 2: RZLH3JT Level 3: 932HBRH Level 4: W8PP92C Megadrive Desert Strike Level 2: AQJMMHW Level 3: TLOEOQA Level 4: JTKKOME Campaign 3 Campaign 4: Mission 3-1: UN Inspectors Enter the main city and use two hydras on the APHIDS that are causing the UN inspectors' grief. Pick the guys up and then take out the nearest small building to get some more MIAs. Mission 4-1: Oil Fields The Commandos are found by going straight to the coast and then North. They're just on the far side of the dunes. Now for the oil fields. Each field is protected by about three ZSUs, one in the centre, one at the top and one in the bottom left. The quick ladder is in the centre of the northern oil fields. Don't forget to drop off the commandos at the landing zone. Mission 3-2: Chemical Factories Destroy the ALA before turning to the factories. There is no real structure you can follow to do this best. They are all heavily defended by ZSUS so just get in, destroy the factories with Hydras and then pick up the scientists. They know where the missile silos are. Mission 4-2: Oil Spills There are three pipes along the coastline that are spilling into the Gulf. destroy the weapons from the left (you can sneak up on them you see). There is a weak point on each pipe it's just a case of using your cannon until you find it. Mission 3-3: Missile Silos Most of the silos you have to destroy have valuable supplies around them. The most easterly silo has an extra life which is guarded by an APHID, so be ready with a carefully placed Hydra. The northern one contains fuel and armour. The best way to destroy all the silos is a combination of all three weapons. Mission 4-3: Bomb Shelters There are four shelters with four civilians in each. You need to rescue fifteen of the sixteen to complete the mission. Three of the shelters are guarded by ZSUs buried in the sand. Once you've destroyed the defences use your cannon to blow up the shelter 'cos you're gonna need those missiles. Grab the four prisoners and go to the nearest landing zone and return for more of the same. Mission 3-4: Lost At Sea This one is dead easy. Fly towards one of the boats and fire off six hydras and then swing around and do the same on the way back and pick up the hostages. This way you take minimum damage. Mission 4-4: Bomb Parts The dump trucks are in the city at the bottom right of the map. Take out the defences then dump the trucks (not the decoys)then destroy all the small buildings to reveal two extra lives CHEATMODE Mission 3-5: Power Station One of the rescued prisoners tells you that you have to destroy the power station before you can attack the Yacht. Once you've blown up the power station you will find some fresh armour there, soit's all plain sailing from here. Mission 4-5: Nuclear Weapons The radar sites have to be taken out first. One is just south of the factory the other i just to the North East of the nearby landing zone. Mission 4-6: Power Station Don't forget you get extra points for taking out the pylons as well as the power station. Mission 3-6: Madman's Yacht Fly in carefully from the North and use two hellfires on the chopper and hydras on the motorboat. Use your cannon on the troops. Position yourself on the right side of the yacht and pump lead into it. Now, pick up six hostages at a time and drop them off. Don't worry about the madman escaping. Mission 4-7: Presidential Palace The Palace is extremely heavily guarded so you'll have to get yourself a few ammo crates in reserve. When you finally blow away the Palace a landing Zone will appear, you have to drop your co-pilot off here to get the madman unfortunately he gets taken hostage. Doh! Mission 3-7: Enemy Ambassador To the south of the command centre is a radar installation. You MUST take this out first or it's bye bye, sweet fly boy. Now return to the command centre area and destroy all the defences (easier said than done). The enemy ambassador is hiding in the command centre with the flag outside. Be careful not to shoot him as it's a SNAFU. It's worth destroying the surrounding buildings to see what you can Mission 4-8: Bomber Plane Before you begin this one make sure you are fully topped up and there are plenty of ammo crates you can pick up. Fly to the bomber and you'll see the General's plane. Don't destroy it let him run onto the plane with your co-pilot. The guard will be all on his own so waste him and then start attacking the plane. Once you have blasted a hole in the side of the plane stop shooting 'Cos your co-pilot will appear on the wing. Pick him up and you're back in business. Two ZSUS will appear to try and do away with you take these out using two Hydras and a Hellfire each and then the plane will start to move. Just fly behind it and a little to the left and pump all your ammo into it and si-anora madman. find. Mission 3-8: Embassy Rescue Enter the embassy building from the west to regain some fuel and ammo from all the buildings you'll have destroyed earlier. Take out all the defences and buildings watching out for those three helicopters. Land at the landing zone and drop off your Co-pilot. Destroy the fresh defences that will have arrived on the scene. Once everyone is in the bus, blast the gate away CAREFULLY. Move ahead of the bus and be ready with your Hydras in case anything comes along. When you make it to the seal post don't forget to pick up your co-pilot. MUADELE SEE THAT PERDICE CVG 059 "


"CHEAT MODE 6 reetings folks and welcome to this blisteringly bang-on edition of Cheat Mode. As you can seem we're packed to the gills up this month and fitter than a butcher's dog with a two page guide to Desert Strike on both the Megadrive and the SNES. Well I suppose I must be good at something eve though I proved that I'll never be able to drive last weekend by bringing all the traffic on Canvey Island to a complete standstill. Don't laugh though matey, driving a car on the road isn't quite as easy as Mario Kart although most of Canvey Island probably wished they could have just bumped me off the road... Next month will see the return of that by-gone wonder Question Corner! So any probs you've got with your gaming fun (provided it's not EA Hockey) stick 'em in an envelope and chuck'em off to: HURRAH QUESTION CORNER'S BACK AND THIS TIME IT'S FOR REAL, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, FARRINGDON, LONDON, EC1R 3AU. In the meantime make sure you don't let up on your cheats there's still  worth of games up for grabs to whoever sends me the best batch of tips. No-one won this month so if just one of you joystick junkies out there had sent slip send them all off to: PAUL ANGLIN'S CHEAT MODE SCHOOL FOR SAD DRIVERS, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, FARRINGDON, LONDON, EC1R 3AU. See you there! Bye. FINAL FIGHT GUY SUPER EDF SUPER NINTENDO Here's a spiffy little cheat for all of you that were sad enough to buy this very ropey sequel to Final Fight. On the fourth level you can regain pots of energy by walking up and down in front of the white dog. Be careful where you put your foot though! Joby Taylor manages to get Exmouth on the map this month with a great cheat for an average shooter. To get invincibility simply follow this: pause the game and press A,B,X,Y,L,R up, down, left and right, and that should be just enough to make you completely invincible to bullets... JENNIFER CAPRIAT'S TENNIS MI ABRAMS TANK BATTLE James Cannon from Crawley has found a great to help you blow up people in tanks. Wait for the demo screen then press B,B,C,B,C,C,C,B,C,B,B,C and then start, and your weapons should be more powerful MEGADRIVE Alison Eccles from Burnley Lancashire may not have quite the same sort of designer name as tennis star Jenny (shame eh?) but she could certainly blow her frilly tennis whites off when it comes to spotting a top tip. To create a new game type this code GRA ND. SLA M.. (and take care to type it in exactly as our stuperific staff writer has!) This will give you new players of both sexes, all of whom will have better attributes and give you a much harder game. THUNDERFORCE LU Doh! Yet another with no name enclosed. How you can expect to get any fame or even the  top prize I'll never know! Anyway, bad luck but thanks for the excellent extra for Thunderforce IV. So, to get a few extra tunes in this great game you need to complete it (good luck) and then go to the options screen and press A and start. cvG 060 "

"JOHN MADDENS 92  Jason Cambridge from Leeds has managed to find a great level select cheat for Taz. On the title screen if you just press A,B,C and start together and do the same on joypad two then you can just select a level. MEGADRIVE Adrian Edwards from Roturoa New Zealand has taken time out from the All Blacks in order to send me all these game codes. Atlanta vs Oakland at Atlanta DCMYRLLJ Buffalo vs Chicago at Chicago BPS89YH4 Washington vs Oakland at Washington BOB6DCHR Tampa Bay vs Buffalo at Tampa Bay DGNW8TT5 Seattle vs New Orleans at New Orleans C29XVK31 San Francisco vs Oakland at San Francisco -DSFC2Y6T Los Angeles vs Buffalo at LA-D77VJWG1 Green Bay vs Buffalo at Green Bay CCOBOLH5 Miami vs Washington at Washingotn CS7SSJMD JARE ATTEMPT DUCK TALES Kerry Billingham from Romford has found a real money spinner for the game of my fave cartoon. Daring Duck Tales a wooh ooh... Here's how to get to the bonus stage in this game. Find Launchpad and if the fifth digit of your score is a seven you'll go to a bonus stage. Then, when you get a lift back with Launchpad, if the second digit of your score is a seven, you can drop onto some clouds where Giro will arrive and start throwing diamonds at you (stuuupid!). Do this on each level and you can quickly become a millionaire. NES JACKIE CHAN This game stars the nearest living thing to Bruce Lee (apart from the occasional lost mole) and gets the Ryan Honesdale treatment this month. He says that to get infinite continues and have the opportunity of carrying on through the whole game, when you die just press down and the number of continues should increase. LEGENDARY He's orange he's furry and he's not Two Tails. He's Kevin Walsh from Glasgow and he's got a strange accent and probably wears a tartan skirt form time to time. But you can forgive him his peculiarities because he knows something... At the top of the tower of springboards in Psycho Fox is a warp. Choose a tube and as you descend you will appear on a different level. AXE II MASTER SYSTEM DEAD ANGLE PC ENGINE The sequel to the greatest slash 'em up ever gets the treatment of my wonderful GT this month. With the turbo switches off as your last man collapses, hold down II and RUN. Tap left on the pad quickly until you get some credits. A bit of an oldie but still worth a go. Gavin Peacock from Surrey certainly thinks so and tells me that if you plug in two joypads and turn on the machine, when the title screen appears, move both pads left and right until you hear a sound effect. Now by pressing any button on joypad one you'll be magically transported to a later stage. CVG 062 "


"DUNGEON EXPLORER SPLATTERHOUSE Hey it's another one of my PC Engine cheats. This is getting ridiculous but if you're having trouble defeating Natas even though you're on level 14, then enter this code to give you a level 19 warrior AEPAJ-DPIAA At last you're listening to me. Thomas day has sent me my first Engine cheat all the way from Matson Gloucestershire. To select the hardest difficulty setting just hold down select and button Il and waggle the joypad a bit and then the word Hard should come up on the screen. GALAGA 90 It may be a Space Invaders clone but it's great and anyone who doesn't think so can try out my new cheat and then argue with me. To get extra fire-power during the title screen push up then press RUN. On the select mode, choose the single ship and the first pod will give you a triple ship. IIIIIIITT! PC ENGINE PAUSE CHAN AND CHAN Some rather suspect rear end retorts pepper this game but I've found another cheat for you all to enjoy. When the game is over on the screen press and hold 1 and 2 then press RUN to continue where you died. PAUSE SUPER MARIOLAND 2 A somewhat lengthy cheat from Kristian Speke of Ludlow Shropshire but a fine one for all that. Here's how to get 99 lives. After coming out of the mushroom house, go to the Hippo-Zone and enter the Hippo's soap bubble. Stay above the water and collect all the coins and blocks. Eventually you will come to the second Hippo. Just past this you will come to a row of fourteen question mark boxes next to which is a cloud shaped like an arrow. Just above this is a square-shaped cloud. Fly into the bottom right part of the square to reveal a money bag worth 50 coins. All together you should have about 219 coins. Exit this level and repeat the process until you have 999 coins. Carrying your hefty wad of coins, go into the cave and play the fruit machine using 999 coins each go. This way you get great prizes eg: 50 lives. Keep repeating the whole process until you have plenty of lives. GAME BOY 99% 063 CVG "


"PITFIGHTER I Jaunty Craig Randle from Hinckley Leicestershire has found this seafood related cheat for you all to use on Ataris' brilliant beat 'em up. Type in LOBSTERS and press 1-0 to select your level. Or press C to go straight to the championship match.

I've had more than the usual amount of weeds trying to spin my chin this month mi bocus scores; needless to say that they went straight in the bin, but not before I added them to my Rrer-orowing list of sad losers. When I reach the magic number of de itinated CHEATERS I'll publish them in one whole page of shame, so you'll all know houruterly despicable and pathetic at games they really are. One incredibly sad an even tried to pass off a High Score of 109 levels completed on Super Mario Land. Very very very sad indeed. Until next AMIGA I'm getting a bit tired of these Amiga scores the whole chart's been totally dominated by Pinball Dreams lately. No one's put out a decent Project X score yet either.

"When we do it, we do it BIG! Mario, the most famous plumber ever, just goes from strength to strength and to celebrate his huge star status, we're giving you the complete Mario story to coincide with the fantastic FREE Mario badge on the cover of this issue! So feast your eyes and rev up your consoles for the non-stop rollercoaster ride that has seen Mario become the world's largest-grossing video game character of all time! SECONDS OUT! A sequel was assured, but this time the tables were turned as Mario caged the wicked Kong and left the task of rescue up to the ape's young son! Donkey Kong Jnr. was another smash that was eventually to be released on one cartridge alongside Donkey Kong for the NES. It just goes to show how small and basic these games were compared to todays mammoth cart-busters THIRD HELPINGS The third in the series proved to be a radical departure from the platform/climbing theme. Donkey Kong 3 saw Mario swatting insects and eventually the big ape, in his attempts to chuck the hairy fiend off the top of the screen. At first people took to the change in style, but the longevity of gameplay just wasn't there and most thought that perhaps the plumber had had his finest hour. GETTING A LIFE Mario was the sole creation of Japanese video game programmer and designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Although he's now a household name in the Land of the Rising Sun, with his own daily cartoon series and his face plastered on more objects than the Queen, his humble beginnings were in arcade games way back in 1980. Donkey Kong was the first game ever to star the hat-wearing Brooklyn boy and at that time, he didn't even have a name! The idea was to guide Mario up a series of slopes and ladders to the top of the screen to rescue his girlfriend. While you jumped and climbed your way forward a large ape stood at the top and hurled barrels down at you. Graphically, Donkey Kong was nothing special and the only pick-up was a small mallet with which the character could break the barrels, making the whole experience as far from todays games as you could get. However, video gaming was in virgin territory and Donkey Kong became a massive hit. DODGY DAYS! Not to be put off the programmers gave it one last try at the end of 1984 with the fourth and final Donkey Kong game. Realising their mistakes, it was back to the drawing board and a return to the original style. However, video gaming had stepped up a notch and whilst it was still in the factory, Nintendo bosses decided that the game wasn't quite up to the scratch of the competition's releases and the machine was never shipped out internationally. "


"NEW BEGINNINGS 201° 42'37 The Donkey Kong legacy now well and truly over, Mario was ready for his own personal assault on the arcade gaming world with the first of his now infamous platform adventure titles. Mario Bros introduced Luigi, Mario's twin, to the public with the first two-player game starring the pair. In this game the brothers had to clear the screen of cute animals, including snowmen and crabs, as they crawled out strategically-placed pipes. The guys had to first knock the baddies out from underneath platforms and then kick them off the play field with a mighty punt! 101° 55'32 600 Og 01 5530 J'02° 28°02 CHOICES CHOICES Things get a little complicated now as Nintendo launched the Game Boy and Super Famicom machines in Japan. Up until now all these games had only been available on the NES and it was only logical that what worked on that format would work on their new machines as well. So, with a new Mario game for the NES, the incredible Super Mario 3, re-establishing the character as number one in the video gaming world, Nintendo decided to release a special Mario cart for its 16-bit flagship machine the incredible Super Mario World. The Famicom version contained no less than 96 levels even more if you're a top player and new characters, including Mario's guzzling dinosaur pal, Yoshi, and fantastic features such as a special flying cape for Mario and the super drill, which lets the hero tunnel through blocks to hidden levels. Mario could even jump on the back of his prehistoric friend and spit fireballs at the many enemies When the system was launched in the UK, now known as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the game was bundled with the machine; the SNES flew out of stores the length and breadth of the country. WHAT! MORE? By now Mario was well on his way to super-stardom, but it wasn't until 1985 and the release of Super Mario Bros that his true potential was realised. Up until now he'd been confined to one screen, but with the emergence of horizontal scrolling our hero could really start cooking. Eight massive levels were given over to the character as he trashed his way through surprise after surprise and enemy after enemy to get back his beloved Princess Daisy. Packed with imaginative gameplay features and scores of hidden rooms stuffed with treasures, the game sold over 43,000,000 units worldwide, shooting the plumber into the top flight and making him the highest money spinning performer in the world! 102' 28\"00 SEA lo THE NEVER ENDING STORY ALTERED IMAGES Super Mario Bros 2 was an odd one; rather than create the sequel from scratch, the programmers simply took an old game, tweaked the graphics and gameplay and launched the title as an original cart. This time around, players could choose from four characters Mario, Luigi, Princess Daisy and Toad. Generally regarded as the weakest in the series, Super Mario 2 was nevertheless another phenomenal hit. Other Mario titles include Dr Mario, a sort of Tetris-cum-Columns hybrid and Super Marioland, both for the Game Boy. But with the huge success of the Famicom's game other stars such as Yoshi have, and almost certainly will have, their own titles. Even as video gaming becomes ever more diverse, it seems that the Mario formula will just keep on trucking. He's already grossed over three times as much money as the biggest film in history; and speaking of films, the Super Mario Bros movie is in production, starring Bob Hoskins as the man himself and Dennis Hopper as Bowser, King Of The Koopas! It looks as though Mario Mania could go on forever he's beginning to appear in games other than platform-based check out the amazing Super Mario Kart and with T-shirts, cartoon shows and even records featuring the moustachioed maestro, we bet you wish it was you who doodled the rotund, cap-wearing pipe-fitter in a fit of boredom!

"FUE REVIEW B788 OCLEAR CREDITS NES A JOLLY BROLLY PLATFORM BY OCEAN .00 Bet you thought an umbrella was only any good for keeping the rain off you and poking peoples' eyes out with the ludicrously pointy bits as you saunter along the streets? Not if you were using it to take on Baron von Blubba and his cronies, for in Parasol Stars you have a magic brolly that not only lets you stun the meanies, it also allows you to pick up drops of water and hurl them at the enemies, destroying them in the process! MODULUI DABAR GOOD GOLLY! A LORRA LOLLY! As in Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands, one of the key features to be found in Parasol Stars is the absolute horde of secret bonus goodies, simply aching for collection! If you can wipe out all the baddies on-screen in the correct order, hidden doors open to let you in on those lovely extras. Other surprises include bags of dosh falling from the sky, big cakes (like those seen in Bubble Bobble) and other point-increasing chattles! s3493% 0 CREDIT SYDX 9 CREDITS ub is back! The once-dinosaurian star of Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands is still in human form, and still battling against the dastardly Baron von Blubba! The big boss baron is up to his usual being-not-nice antics, and it's up to the portly kid to grab his magic umbrella and take on all manner of weird and wonderful meanies before the Baron and his boys do something unspeakable to Bub's pals. I thought that I'd be getting just a little tired of these cute platform games by now after around three years of playing them, but to be perfectly honest, having had a good old crack at Parasol Stars on NES, it's reminded me of just how good they are when done well. Graphically the game's no great 06 shakes neither, for that matter, were the prequels but they're jolly and move around well. Sound isn't bad either, although just how long you can stand the tinkly tunes before you go completely off your trolley, I wouldn't like to guess. No, for me it's the gameplay which makes these titles stand out from the crowd, and there's no denying that Parasol Stars has that vital ingredient in abundance. You'll be instantly hooked from the beginning and will keep returning to the action time and time again. Loads of baddies, bonuses galore and a lasting challenge are what Parasol Stars has going for it give it a whirl and you'll agree! PAUL RAND GRAPHICS % 83 SOUND SOUND % 85 GAMEPLAY % VALUE % F   VELLY JOLLY! Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands weren't exactly known for their frightening end-of-level guardians, and Parasol Stars is no different. After all, who could be frightened by a large one man band?

"REVIEW BUG SELECT STADIUM SUPER NINTENDO SPORTS SIM STADIA GALORE WHICH TO CHOOSE? BY NAMCO .99 OB UUS HERE ARE THE LADS, ALL READY AND WAITING FOR USA'S ANSWER TO ROUNDERS! aseball? Oh yeah, it's a bit like rounders, innit? No, not really. For a start it's American, the bat is a lot larger, the ball is thrown a touch faster and you have to wear stupid caps to play it as well. The basic rules are quite simple someone chucks the ball at you and you hit it as hard as possible, then run. Meanwhile, the other guys have to try and run after the ball and get it to the base before you do, or catch it before it hits the ground. Great, eh? STRIKE TIME! GO ON, CATCH IT MAN! As with most sports sims lately, Super Batter Up uses real American League teams and real team stats. This basically means that there's a lot more strategy involved than just picking teams at random. There's no famous players in there (which means the absence of that get Roger Clemens) but the teams' skill levels change drastically from one end of the board to the other. The instruction book gives you a full rundown of all the teams' player stats; there's everything you need to know about every player in there, from throwing skills to height these come in very useful when selecting your starting line-up or calling a time out. If, when your batter gets to the plate, you realise that he can't even swing a cat in an empty room, you can always call a time-out and relieve him of his duties at any point during the match by pushing Start. You only get a limited amount of time-outs for each innings, so use them wisely a good tip is, just as the pitcher is winding up, call 'time' in order to put him out of his stride a little. THANKS...to Shekhana Consoles (081 340 8565) for the review cartridge. Super Batter Up is yet another in an NUFF Saio! unnecessarily long line of failed efforts. The problem with Baseball games is that you just cannot give any of the players an IQ above that of Steve Keen, which makes catching players out and preventing steals very hard. As well as all the standard problems of such titles, Super Batter Up suffers from its own as well it's complete crap! The game is so slow and the players so unresponsive that you won't want to bother playing past the first innings ever. Just to hammer the final nail in the coffin, the music is probably about the worst I've ever heard in my life; we're talking worse than Top of the Pops in 1976 here. Tunes are so repetitive and sad that you'll be likely to turn the volume right down and rip the knob off! HOME RUN COMING UP! BOTTOM OF THE NINTH As well as being able to choose from real teams, it's also possible to choose different styles of play. There's your standard one or two player mode which puts you up against either the computer or a mate over however many innings you decide to choose. A standard game consists of nine innings, but if you've only got a few minutes you can play just a couple. If you fancy something a little more challenging you can take part in a full Major League season only in one player mode, but you get to participate in a real season with league standings and such. There's also a password option so that all your hard work does not get wiped when you switch off. IT'S LONELY IN THE OUT-FIELD!

In my time you'd be lucky to find three pence, a conker and a fluff-covered Murray Mint! But now you're likely to discover a half-dozen electronic games, a parent's credit card and more miniaturised cars than Elton John keeps in his garage! Micro Machines first saw the light of day as tiny, detailed vehicles that kids collected. The Codies saw their true potential and stuck the microscopic toys in a race and chase game on the NES which set the world alight! Now it's be en given the full 16-bit treatment and is shooting onto the Megadrive. MINIATURE MADNESS Rep erspect, verses ago Everything in Micro Machines is cut right down to size. All the racing takes place in our world on huge breakfast tables, floors, sideboards and even in the bathtub! They may be small, but these machines certainly pack some zip. It's not just a question of the fastest taking the chequered flag, though. The winner will have to guide his vehicle around tons of everyday obstacles that look as though they've been left behind by an extra from Valley Of The Out of all the different races one of the most fun is the head-to-head light Giants! There are nools of sticky challenge. On this course you must race to the finish line, keeping all the honey that have been dripped onto other cars behind you. If you get left behind and disappear off the screen you the track. glue pens and pencils. lose a life, but if you leave the other racers behind they'll disappear in a puff rubbers, nuts and bolts and loads of of smoke. Nice one! Sometimes the track's lines are a little difficult to make other gargantuan obstacles, spread out, but you can always cut a few corners. Be careful though too much time over 27 twisting courses and locaoff the track and you'll explode! UH-OH! MIND YOU DONN'T HIT THAT tions PENCIL SHARPENER! HEADING FOR A FALL SMASH AND BASH Beating the opposition requires cunning and tactical use of the nudge. Buffet opponents' cars out of the way if they take up too much space and exploit those huge tangerine seg. ments by subtly pushing other people into them! There are rivers, jumps and even cereal boxes that can be used to make you the undisputed champion. The Micro vehicles are incredibly nippy and move brilliantly with great sound effects as the tiny motors whir around the circuits in and out of the huge obstacles. They even have shadows whenever they leave the table and fly over a jump. Some of the other contestants are a bit of a push over and the screen could have done with showing more of the track, but the end result is great. There's not a lot to the game when it gets down to it, but what a lot of fun it is. There are 27 different courses and at least six tiny craft for you to master, so you won't be wanting for more events for quite a while. Each one handles realistically, although some are more delicate to the touch than others. This is highly recommended and one of the best race games on the Megadrive.

Vom Micro Machines Challenge VEHICLES SELECT VEHICLE FOR ALL OCCASIONS Considering they're best known for the slightly tedious Dizzy series, I was very surprised when the Codies came up with the incredible Micro Machines on NES. It looked a bit tinky, but played like a charm. Now it's come to the Megadrive and the quality is on a par with the 8-bit Nintendo game that means it's very good. Graphically you'd expect it to be superior, and it is; small but perfectly formed sprites and a stack of greatlooking tracks are pleasing to the eye without being gaudy. Some of the opposition racers are verging on the sad side, but generally there's a meaty challenge in there, and the game really comes into its own when you grab a OVER LAD!: pal for two-player thrills and spills. One of the better racing games on the Megadrive, Micro Machines is a winner for Codemasters! Creme SLIIT lit11 HEY! IT'S THE KING! In true form, just as though you were collecting the real items, Micro Machines takes you through the whole series of toys. Slide into control of sports cars, power boats (watch out for the plug hole!), combat tanks, dune buggies and mini-helicopters that flutter through the garden. When you're racing in the challenge mode you get a nice wooden presentation case to put all your cars in when you've finished with them before moving on to the next race. You only get three credits and if you don't finish in one of the top two positions you'll lose your collection and must start again. HLS10115!

There's no peace for the deformed, and this time you've got to fight the Beast on his own turf. So, snatching up a heavy mace and donning a loin-cloth, it's time to traverse the treacherous land of Kara-Moon to Zelek's domain and enter the towering castle of darkness for the final battle. EA could have (I'd rather CURIOUSER ironed out Pick Beast Il is more than your average platform shoot 'em up there's quite a Beast's little nigand large puzzle aspect to the game as well.

"GVO CVE REVIEW NISKA WODOS MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BY ELECTRONIC EAST .99 Joan armour-trading Occasionally when a creature is shot it drops a metal disk. Rohan, using his amazing iron-working talents, can construct a suit of armour from the disks he collects. Gathering thirty-two lets him a build a suit of silver armour which absorbs half the damage inflicted on him. Sixty-five disks are enough for him to build the rock-hard gold armour which affords 100% protection from damage. Being hit by one of Draxos' creatures costs Rohan one disk. regardless of the type of armour he's wearing, and should the number fall below that required to build the armour it comes apart, leaving Rohan with nothing more than a loin cloth and a smile. It's a dark day in the Risky Woods. Hit used to be that the only risky thing about walking through it was having a bird dump on your head. But now the undead servants of the evil lord Draxos trip through the undergrowth where fluffy bunnies once dwelled, and only Rohan, the wood's sole warrior, can get rid of Draxos and his walking corpses for good. Risky Woods marks something of a change of direction for EA; after concentrating almost solely on simulations they've decided to try their hand at good old-fashioned platform hack 'n slay action. 2:38 life: 2 084090 10000 Stage 1 1000000016 < Bang ON KEV What Risky Woods lacks is any sort of hook; there's no variation in the gameplay, which is painfully obvious when you start a new level. On the plus side it is surprisingly playable for something which offers nothing new to the field of platform gaming. You're given a plentiful supply of creatures to kill, a good variety of weapons and the temptation to hang around collecting disks often leaves to some close shaves with the time limit. If you fancy getting your hands on a cart which will last you longer than an afternoon you wouldn't go far wrong with this. On the other hand, you may find it too frustrating to be really worthwhile, which is why I suggest you give it a play before you pay. PAUL ANGLIN Not only does Rohan have to be a bit nifty with a sword, he also needs a good ear for music. Each level contains a number of gatekeepers (which look like pterodactyls riding unicycles) which have to be destroyed for him to pass. To do this he first has to collect a key, then throw it into the circle beneath the gatekeeper, before finally repeating a short tune that it will play. Luckily for Rohan, the gatekeepers have never learned more than four different notes, which are played by pushing the joypad in the four main directions. Carnifourous related capers down in the forest. LRISKY BONUSES There are plenty of bonuses in Risky Woods some good, some bad and some downright unpredictable. Collectibles that fall into the last category have one of a number of effects they'll either award Rohan ten thousand points, send him to sleep or kill him. Not what you'd call fair but hey, these are the Risky Woods, after all! STRATEGY SKILL CVG GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE CVG 078 % % % % 79 ACTION REFLEXES CVG "

"0000 GVE REVIEW AVE PC Garth the basty RPG WHERE... WHAT IS... BY US GOLD .99 Show me the way to home. After a night on the town in the Hanged Man, the automapping feature can be very handy. Use this with the A2 map poster given with the game and you'll get back easy! You can interact with all the other characters in You can interact with all the other characters in the game through the dialogue menu. Garth the Hasty here looks a particularly shady character. LEGENDS T It's not often that you can look at a game and know immediately that it's something special. Legends of Valour is one such game that stinks of hard work and comes complete with a distict odour of success. It is one of the first of a new breed of virtual reality that will drag PC games kicking and screaming into the mid nineties. The action all takes place in a 'virtual world' where everyone reacts independently and gives you the freedom to interact with characters as you see fit. This means you can kill the nosey old bat from across the street but watch out for the militia. It also means that the local militia will be after your ass too. Yes, it's just like real life down on the farm. 0000 13 12 (15) as stay in the ca Ga CONTROLLING YOUR CHARACTER Role playing games can be too repetitive but LOV has no definate plot and has more twists and turns than a mongoose in a snake pit! This is not a game. It's more like dipping your toe into a strange new world and being sucked in up to your armpits!. The main problem with the game could lie within this fact. Life can be fairly humdrum at times and there are parts of the game that reflect real life to the point of domestic bordom. Book, ing into hotels, arguing with the neighbours, all these things add to a desperate reality.But life is only as sad as you make it. Once you've arrived in town, you can join one of the many guilds usually by making a small donation and taking on a task for them. Once you've completed t'initiation ceremony then you're in! Whether it's as a thief, mercenary, priest or magician, you can then increase your level and your abilities as you pile on the experience.

Clicking on the item will transfer it to your backpack (14) 4 Options Menu Including: Load/Save game. Sound, Auto Combat and more. 5 Status Your health. From left to right they are: General Health, Energy Combat Injuries, Appeal. Hunger. Thirst and Sleep. Try to keep all the bars as full as possible... Movement Although movement by mouse is excellent, you can use the movement icons if you prefer. The bottom right button actually gives you your present rank in each of Mitteldorfs guilds 7 Combat/Action The top three from left to right are: left punch/slash, two-handed punch/thrust and right punch/slash dependent on if whether you're caught with your weapon in hand or not. The middle three are: town plan, magic spell and religious spell 8 Compass Shows you your current heading. You can even click on it to turn your character to face that particular direction. 9 Drop Drops the object currently held in the right hand. (Okay, so how many left-handed dwarves do you know?) 10 Right Hand And the currently held object 11 Throw Chuck whatever's in your hand. Throwing knives and stones are handy missiles... 12 Backpack You can only carry up to six objects depending on how heavy they are. 13 Commodities Trading is big business in Mitteldorf and there are various ways of acquiring goods although buying and selling them isn't a bad way to earn cash. Clicking here opens a screen that tells you what quantities you have. The goods are (left to right) gems, spices, pigments, ore, hides and tar. 14 Money How many groats you are carrying. As with all items, you can leave some safely in your room in town. 15 Message Window This is where all dialogue with other characters is displayed. WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS? STEVE KEEN The option screen can be accessed at any time from where you can turn auto-combat on or off, change the game settings for sound and there's even a helpline number. The second row of icons all manipulate the speed of the game by reducing screen size, depth of view and floor mapping. The bottom row is straightforward but will only save in a tavern or hostel.

"013 REVIEW GUE PVC zombie brains. Very appetising if you've a mind. price: 63 Order ? FEAST NOTICES GAMBLE EXIT. A HEALTHY DIET The first task that you should set yourself in Mitteldorf is to stay alive. To do this initially you need food, shelter and money. There are various ways of getting each but having money means you don't have to search for it. What you need to do is to build your character into a head-bustin' hard case by joining the guilds and improving your prowess in magic, murder, mass appeal and appropriating. Nobody can last without food or drink and whilst the variety of drink in the taverns of Mitteldorf is not extensive, the choice of food is far more cosmopolitan F VALOUR THAT'S FIGHTING TALK Legends of Valour has been a long time in the making but this could be explained by the game's immense depth. What US Gold have done is to give you a complete world to explore. The single most amazing thing about the game however is the speed. I played it on a lethargic 286 yet the VGA graphics were acceptably nippy, well defined and colourful. Combat is logical and easy and can even be set to automatic and the whole game has real feel that you can get lost in. In fact, getting lost was a bit of a problem to begin but seasoned adventurers should have no problems here. A masterly game that takes the next step from Dungeon Master PAUL ANGLIN As you walk around the streets in Legends of Valour, you get the opportunity to talk to the natives. Most are quite helpful but some think that they're some poor relative of Yob! If they decide to insult you, it's time to start thinking about shutting their big gobs for them permanently. Fighting can be switched to automatic using the options menu but there's nothing like being in control of a particularly nasty scrap especially when you've got three types of sword stroke and a myriad of magic ready to unlease on someone who's just called your mam something akin to 'A festing boil on the bum of humanity. Each time you get involved in a fight, you will sustain battle injuries which will show up on your health readout. Unfortunately, there're injuries that can sustained without your knowledge. Lycanthropy, poisoning and so on can be detected by certain priesthoods. They'll charge you too! Any town you visit, unless you're in Wales, will have a pub and Mitteldorf is no exception. Like many tavern, these do far more than just sell beer. STRATEGY SKILL Unlike many pubs, you can actually leave these with more money than you came with if you're lucky. The Hanged Man is known for its beetle racing. ACTION REFLEXES You can stand by whilst people insult you. Me? I'd rather cut them to little bits. A quick thrust and she's almost had it. A combination of blows does the best job. 01 so Sorry, I had to go There's something strange going on tour. Il meet you in the Trolls Hims.

"ARCADE That's hot in the coin-op world this month? Only the latest Neo Geo blast! Viewpoint dropped into our office, plugged itself into our cabinet and proceeded to totally astound us! We've dragged PAUL ANGLIN away from the machine, wiped the dribble from his chin and sat him down in front of a Mac to give you all the gen! Why is it that we're all sat here wondering whether or not UFOs really exist, when we all know full well that they're alive and well and invading every solar system in the known cosmos. Seeing as we're all dead keen to make contact with other intelligent life forms and discover new cultures before blowing them all out of living existence, we've decided to send some lucky soul off in an advanced death wagon of the highest order to put a stop to the aliens' violent merriment. You've got all your hardest weapons with you and the whole world depending on your not being an Cheswick, so good luckand don't forget to get some pics of those life forms if you can. uivizo MZ 351565000 CREDITS WEAPON WONDERMENT The weapons in Viewpoint are very simply just a pod, on each side of your ship that fires extra bullets! There are no really hard extra armaments just your standard gun. But the pods do provide extra protection at the sides of your ship, acting like a shield. Also available to pick up are whirly force-fields which will protect your ship for three hits, which can make some of the levels a touch easier. YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT YOUR TURN Unlike most two-player shooters these days, Viewpoint doesn't include a simultaneous dual player option. The two player game is a turn-by-turn affair which is a disappointment, as it would have been an absolute riot to play this game with two ships on screen. The one-by-one thing isn't a tragedy though, 'Cos you get the opportunity to learn by your pal's mistakes. 19380 297 CREDITS 09) A DEAD PARROT As you may well have noticed from the screenshots, the graphics in Viewpoint are nothing short of incredible. All sorts of words like vectors and isometric may come into your head when you look at these, but the real term is Polygonised Sprites. Sounds technical? It is, but can be explained very simply. Basically, the graphics have been drawn very cleverly so that they give the impressive effect of polygons but not the blocky look. Cor, the things they can do these days! 19270 IUB4550 00 GVG 682 "


"AVG Viewpoint has to be the most graphically impressive Neo game I have ever seen. The all-new viewpoint of the game is just the start of that forgotten concept in video games originality! The only cliched thing is those end-level baddies. Graphics are absolutely stunning. with some of the most awesomelooking bad guys ever seen in a video game or a sci-fi film for that matter! The music has to be heard, it's not a case of a Neo imitating rock hard thumping tracks they ARE rock hard thumping tracks, the likes of which you would be happy to shove in your Walkman, and the great James Brown samples are just sooo good. Many Neo games have suffered from being too easy, but not this one. It's rocks, sure but not frustrating. If you ever get the chance to play this...no, actually make sure you play Viewpoint, whatever the cost! PAUL ANGLIN VIEWPOINT BOMB THE BASE NEO GEO by SAMY 30P 50P PER PLAY STRATEGY SKILL Your main pieces of kit with which to dispatch some serious amounts of bad guys are your bombs. There are three different types: here's a rundown: FIREWALL: as it's name suggests this just sends a huge wall of fire across the screen wiping out everything WAVE BOMB: this just creates a huge circle of fire that will fry anything daft enough to get in it's path. HOMING MISSILE: this fires a plethora of missiles which will home in on anything on screen and destroy it. You start off with three bombs and there are a limited amount scattered throughout the levels but you can only carry three bombs at any one time. 54550 ... HIGH5850 CREDITS 208 ACTION REFLEXES BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR % So you like the look of Viewpoint, eh? Fancy a copy of it for your home-based Neo, would you? Well sorry, but you can't have it! Yeah, you heard right, for some reason Viewpoint is not down on the Neo Geo UK home release list. The only way us Brits will get to play is either in the arcades or on an American or Japanese Neo, and seeing as there's no converter available, you're well up the creek.

"CE HOTSHOTS MICK AND MACK GLOBAL GLADIATORS MASTER SYSTEM It's not every day you see a Megadrive game converted over to the little Sega but that's exactly what Virgin are doing with their McDonalds license and the 16-bit version's not even finished yet! If you saw the Megadrive Hotshot a couple of issues ago, you'll already know the story, but if not, here's a potted version: Mick and Mack are two groovy. Big Mac-eating lads who get sucked into a comic book and have to escape by wiping out all the pollutants found on each level. Using special detergent-firing guns, scour the levels wiping out nasties and picking up bonuses as you go. The Megadrive version of the game looks excellent, and to be honest there doesn't seem to be a great deal of difference between that and the Master System version! Graphics, as you can see, here, look highly detailed, and gameplay should be similar to that of its multi-bitted relative! We'll bring you a CVG Review just as soon as we possibly can in the meantime, be friendly to the planet! TRIDER MEGADRIVE Both in coin-op form and on Sega Megadrive, Strider was a bit of a name when it hit the streets. Graphically the game was one of the most impressive around, but the home version was let down slightly due to the bane of many Megadrive carts it was just too easy. However, US Gold are well on the way to completing their sequel to the classic and if you look at these pics, you can hardly disagree with us when we say it's looking not-crap! US Gold tell us that the basic gameplay remains the same as before, but with much more emphasis put on making the game that bit more challenging. Sounds good to us! Keep your eyes on future issues of CVG we'll be reviewing Strider Il in the very near future! Man VVVVV kann und CVG 090 "

"HOTSHOTS MIT COOL WORLD NESSNES Forget what the critics have said about Cool World. We can't wait to see it over here and from what we've seen of the film it looks pretty darn spunky, if you'll pardon the expression. The film stars the sultry Kim Bassinger both in the flesh (schwing) and in cartoon form and as ever, she has more curves than the river Thames and a figure that Claudia Schaefer would pluck her finger nails out for! The plot goes like this; Vegas Vinnie discovers a secret tunnel that connects the animated land Cool World, to our world. He also wipes and swipes The Golden Spike of Power which acts as a wedge between the two worlds and hides it on top of the Las Vegas Hotel. Now our Kim plays a stunning doodle called Holli Would who wants to become human and needs the Spike of Power to undergo the metamorphosis. Simple? Well it would be if not for the fact that if she makes the swap it could rip both worlds apart! Unashamed and undettered, she has stolen the map that shows the hole into our world and torn it into five pieces and given one piece to each of her henchmen. You must go up against Holli (oooer!) and recover all five pieces of the parchment and return to Ocean World. Cool world is coming out across all of Nintendo's games machines, including Gameboy, and will be with us shortly. ET TINY TOON ADVENTURES DASHODI 3co UK3 O SUPER NINTENDO O MEGADRIVE O They're tiny! They're toony! And in a couple of months time, Megadrive AND Super Nintendo owners will be able to get their hands on a game based on Steven Spielberg's little Looney Tunes creations! Both games star the main Tiny Toons character. Buster Bunny (no prizes for guessing who he's a relative of!) but each cart sports different levels and general gameplay alterations. In the Megadrive game, Buster's out on a treasure hunt after finding a note showing the positions of hidden map pieces. But Montana Max, the Toons' arch enemy, has kidnapped Buster's girly Babs and, with the help of all his pals including Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig and Calamity Coyote, he's got to find her before it's too late! The Super Nintendo antics see Buster starring in a series of different platform-based cartoon levels, from the Looniversity where our half-pint hero must dodge nasties and take on the big boss bully at the end, to Outer Space and the per M EITT 500 500 ils of the dastardly Duck Vader! Both games should be available during the first quarter of this year, and you can't deny that both Megadrive and SNES versions are looking hot! Hot! HOT! As soon as we can, we'll be bringing you the definitive Reviews of the games until then, THAT'S ALL FOLKS! GVG 092 "

"HOTSHOTS LETHAL WEAPON NES SNES iggs and Murtaugh are back on the streets with Ocean's Mega license, Lethal Weapon. Their latest romp is a multi-levelled platform adventure in which the duo must duff up the bad guys and return order to the chaotic American streets. Although Mel Gibson is the bigger star, Danny Glover has worked his way firmly into fans affections as Riggs' pessimistic sidekick. Acknowledging his popularity, Ocean has given you the opportunity to chose which of the heroes you want to play. Riggs is an expert at martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, whilst Sargent Murtaugh packs more power with his regulation issue Smith and Western! Each level will require a varied approach and whilst Riggs can kick butt during one stage he might not be so tough when confronted with gun-toting hooligans. Go up against mercenaries, gun-runners, bombers and tons of hoods in the cops' biggest adventure yet! The full report will hit the streets next month! THRILL SUPER FROG BODY BLOWS SUPERFROG AMIGA eam 17 is following hard on the heels of its huge Amiga successes. Alien Breed 1992 and Project X, with two brand new games. The first will be Super Frog a fast scrolling cute platform adventure staring a 'lovable' Geordie frog with a few special powers. The slimy sucker bounds around scores of different locations including marshes, forests, spooky castles and wildernesses, collecting coins, rings and assorted pick-ups which all spawn further frolics for the funometer! Super Frog will be with us shortly! The most eagerly awaited product though has to be the massive arcade style beat 'em up Body Blows. Players can enter into Amiga Streetfighter type rumpuses in either Arcade or Tournament modes. In Arcade mode there are four main heroes to choose from before going toe to toe against one of seven deadly fighters found in locations spread all over the world. Beat these bozos and you'll end up doing battle against the king of the underworld, Max. Tournament mode has the choice of players extended to eight fighters each of which can be selected to square up to 10 super thugs from hell! Some of the toughs you'll be making brief acquaintance with are; Junior, a deadly heavyweight kick boxing champion with extraordinary kicking powers, Dan, a street fighter from the gutters who can let loose huge flames of energy from his body, Dug, just one of the game's fat-boy wrestlers who uses an awesome earthquake attack, Maria, the buxom Spanish lass with devastating lightning speed and Ninja, the terrifying Japanese warrior with razor sharp swords. This is just a small selection of the dastardly characters and the game will feature hundreds of frames of animation and oodles of digitised sound effects and speech! Watch out for a review in a few months time this will be FIERCE! Cv6 094 "
