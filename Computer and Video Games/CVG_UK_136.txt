"JUNGLE JAPES NEWS\" Hold onto your hat and fasten your goggles, the world's greatest Megadrive shooter is getting a sequel! Yup, Desert Strike 2, or Jungle Strike as it will be known, is currently being programmed by those top folk at EA. The game is well into production and, as you can see, it's looking a bit smart. EA are said to have included a stack of new features such as night missions. Hopefully we'll be able to give you a full preview very soon. MARVELLOUS MEGA MOUSE What with the Mega CD just around the corner, or maybe a couple of corners, joypad makers Ascilware have unveiled their latest creation a smart Megadrive mouse. Although this may seem a little useless, think how helpful it will be when playing all those PC conversions on your Mega CD! I mean, you try playing Indy and the Fate of Atlantis with a joypad! The other advantage is that, by turning the mouse upside down, you can turn it into a trackball, which could be a laugh when playing Kick Off! . On it's back with a ball in the air it's a trackball, Full of coconuts Jungle Strike from EA! MORTAL MEMORABILIA Remember that so-so coin-op called Mortal Kombat? For some reason, it seems to have had a real impact on the arcade world; such an impact in fact that the people behind it, Midway, have decided to launch a vast range of Mortal Kombat goodies. These include such delights as a limited edition comic book, Mortal Kombat mugs, T shirts and all sorts of other Kombat memorabilia! For those of you interested you can get hold of a catalogue from the US by writing to: Mortal Kombat, 1340 W. Irving Park Road, Suite 414, Chicago, II 60613. As if that wasn't enough Mortal Kombat will be appearing on your Megadrive in the near future via Flying Edge! The game is still very much in the early stages but it could be interesting we'll keep you posted. FUNNY PADS! FIGHT.. A lovely little tit-bit to fuel the the minds of all would-be Megadrive Streetfighting champions out there! Sega have just unveiled their sixbutton joypad in Japan. There's no sign of a UK release date yet-in fact, Sega UK haven't even heard of it officially, but here's a CVG sneaky peek at the little feller to prove it! The pad is a touch smaller than a standard Megadrive controller, with the six buttons arranged in exactly the same fashion as the Streetfighter ll coin-op, making play an obscene amount easier. The joypad should be available from importers very soon and a UK release won't be too far behind; expect to pay around .99 for the widget. BUZZ! BUZZ! BUZZ! ON THE TAP The latest shoot 'em up awaiting release on the SNES has to be one of the weirdest yet. Bells and whistles, or Twin Bee as it will be known over here, originally started life in the arcades. After a while it moved onto the PC Engine and then kind of stopped there, Konami have now snapped up the license and are working on the game as we speak! There's no release date as yet, but if the Engine version is anything to go by it'll be worth the wait. From what we've heard, the strange characters and mind-boggling, effects that made the game such a hit will remain. More info as and when! Ever had a load of mates over and they've got a bit peeved 'cos you're hogging the SNES? Well now up to five players can battle away at any one time! The device houses four adaptors which plug into the player two port (the fifth player plugs into port one) and, provided you have enough joypads, it's fun all the way. The first game to make use of the adaptor is Jimmy Connors' Tennis, which allows you to play doubles with each player under human control. Also pencilled in for adaptor compatibility is a five player souped-up version of the PC Engine classic, Bomberman! It's not yet decided whether the adaptor will be sold separately or with Bomberman 93. When we know you'll know. vG 003 "


"MULTISYSTEM THE SEQUEL You may remember a few years ago we reported on a spanky new piece of kit labelled the Konix Multi System, which was never manufactured as Konix ran out of money. However, UK company MSU, in conjunction with Taiwanese firm TXC, are currently working on a totally revamped machine incorporating all the best features from the Konix albatross. And what can you expect this new wonder-gadget to do? Well, the 32-bit 30Mhz unit will be based on existing CD gaming technology and incorporate Full Motion Video, for one! There are already over a dozen games straining at the reins to be released. And just in case you thought those smart Jap lads got all the top goodies, the best news is that the console will be released in the UK before it's seen anywhere else in the world HURRAH! Sega seem ready to strap various bits of their hardware onto anyone else's product who'll have it! First there was the Mega PC, and now the console boys have struck a deal with electronic giants Pioneer. Pioneer are ready to launch their own range of Laserdisc players, but the one attracting most interest is the Mega LD pack. The machine will be able to play Megadrive cartridges, CDs, CD games and Mega Laserdiscs, a new product which stores Sega games on 12 inch Laserdiscs. If that isn't enough, Japanese electronics biggies NEC have produced another plug-in adaptor that will allow you to play TurboGrafx CDs and game cards. Will this be the first CD all-format play station? We'll keep you posted. DEVIL(ISH) RELEASE Following hot on the heels of their massive Amiga success, Zool (which is just about to be released as a coin-op!), Gremlin are releasing Litil Divil for the PC and Amiga. The game stars Mad Mo, a young explorer who stumbles over an ancient portal to a lost city in his cellar! The dim chap drinks from a pool of water and is transformed into a salivating monster who's only chance of returning to his previous form is to find the Fountain of Normality. Graphics look stunning and every one of the huge characters Divil comes across is beautifully animated and coloured. The Underworld is split into five levels, each comprising of ten puzzle rooms connected by tunnels and corridors. During his explorations the hero is pursued by a hideous creature called the Entity: spend too long on a puzzle and the beast will drag him off to a fate worse than death! Litil Devil will be out in April, and we'll be bringing you the full lowdown soon! Football fortunes as Dino Dini transfers from his last club which spawned Kick Off... Devilishly good at having some wicked fun Gremlin's latest! DINO'S KICKED OFF! FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY! STING LIKE A BEE! Dino Dini, of Kick Off fame, has split with his long-time publisher Anco just before the release of the fabled Kick Off 3. The football fanatic, who has been snatched up by Virgin, is now working on the title for the company. Currently under the working title of Dino Dini's Goal!, the new game will be radically different from its predecessors in that players will be able to choose between sideways and vertically scrolling pitches, two sprite sizes and an automatic zoom feature that will allow you to set up camera positions on the pitch to scope in at preset moments and enlarge the action! Dino's stuck the usual ton of European teams and players into the game and given each footballer adaptable statistics like stamina, aggression, resilience, accuracy, shooting, tackling and goal keeping. It should be fab and it's out in April on the Amiga and Atari ST, with a Megadrive version to follow! Virgin have picked up the rights to use Ali's moniker in a brand new boxing game! Muhammed Ali Boxing has been plugged into the office Megadrive for a few days and if the finished version is anything like the early chips we've got, this could shape up to be the best ever game of its type! Featuring both sprites and vector graphics, the player can choose to control any one of ten worldranked fighters, including Ali himself, and take on the best in either an exhibition bout or a full tournament. Featuring extremely classy character animation, two very distinct styles of play and a variety of nice little touches, Muhammed Ali may well be he number one in boxing games. We'll be bringing you the definitive CVG review in the next issue, so don't miss out! CVG 009 Rambler D:SB Hang your portrait from the ropes \"Just look at what you've done!\" "

The comic is produced by a company called Malibu, whose other big creation. ExMutants, has already featured in digital form.

The CVG boys have had their hands on the gun for a while, and here's PAUL ANGLIN to tell you just what you do get for your sixty quid. A SEXTET OF SHOOTING SHENANIGANS FOUR WAYS TO PLAY What use would a Menacer be without games? None, that's what. So thankfully Sega have included a cart containing six games. PEST CONTROL FRONT LINE READY AIM TOMATOES Shock horror! Loads of little insects Desert forces are out in strength and The wacky duo, Toejam and Earl, are attacking your slice of pizza! it's down to you to stop them. Shoot take you through this horizontallyUse the Menacer to eliminate them all the tanks, jeeps and helicopters scrolling splat 'em up! You take the all and save your dinner before it's and move onto the next level. Fail role of Toejam while Bog Earl tells too late. and you'll be selling camels for the you how you're doing. rest of your life. Also in the box of delights are the add-ons slide-on stock and binocular sights which allow the Menacer to be set up in four different ways. SURE SHOT The Menacer in it's simplest form, with nothing attached to it. This is best used by those who have used the gun before and possess a fairly steady hand. PROSES SCORE : LS LEFT : 8 SHTE SLORE: 8819 TLFER54 FULL TILT The Menacer in all it's glory, Full Tilt utilises all the add-ons, turning it into one awesome killing instrument. The stock provides the stability while the binoculars provide perfect sight for pinpoint accuracy. The only problem with this is that the binoculars tend to strain your eyes slightly after long periods of play POWER LILIT POLVER BAES: 399 TARGETS SPACE STATION DEFENDER Your home away from home, in this case a space station, is under attack from weird aliens in flying telephone boxes. BT in space? No and they aren't Dr Who either! Blast these baddies before they blast you. WHACKBALL The most unusual of the six. You don't use the trigger at all! Knock the ball around the screen and smash all the tiles before moving on to the next level for more of the same. ROCKMAN'S ZONE Looking a little similar to a scrolling version of Hogan's Alley on the NES, Rockman's Zone has you travelling through different scenarios, blasting standard shooting range targets as they pop up into view. COMMANDO Probably the best set-up, Commando comprises of the gun and the snap-on stock. This provides real stability for accurate shooting. USE INFRA-RED OR YOU'LL BE DEAD! DUAL VISION The gun and the binocular slide-sights. This configuration seems rather defeatist; the idea of the binoculars is to offer greater accuracy but without the stock the gun is prone to wobble, making it difficult to accurately sight. The infra-red sensor plugs into the Megadrive joypad port and picks up the signal sent by the Menacer. To achieve the greatest level of accuracy, the sensor should be placed on top or underneath your TV. cVG 014 "


"ENACING LIHIHI TO UHE LMIHIHN TU FEH T2 the best Menacer game around! GO FOR YOUR GUN! Shoot that chopper, Arnie! More blasting laughs with T2 The Arcade Game. The Menacer is constructed of sturdy, grey plastic, inside which is housed the infra-red beam. The gun takes six AAA batteries and resembles something from the last series of V! The fire button is positioned for easy trigger finger operation and three other buttons, on the front handle of the gun, offer different functions depending upon the game you're playing; for example, in T2 The Arcade Game they are used to operate the rocket launchers and also to pause the game. We've been waiting for the Menacer for what seem like ages now, but it's finally here and seems to have made quite an impact. Like Nintendo's Super Scope, the Menacer has been launched with a cartridge containing six games, all specially developed for use with the gun. The only other game available for the Menacer is T2 The Arcade Game, but if that sells well (and if you check out this month's review you'll see that it deserves to) no doubt that will be followed by plenty of other hot titles. There's even rumour of Menacer games coming out on the Mega CD! Mad Dog McCree would be a good one, wouldn't you agree? HOW DOES IT FARE? THE GUN The Menacer has to go down as one of the best light guns yet. While it may not be quite as accurate as the Super Scope (although you'd have to be very picky to really notice the difference) it's certainly much more comfortable to use and feels like a real gun, and the different set-ups provide some scope for changing your style of play. A job well done by Sega. THE GAMES What a sad first outing for the Menacer range! I'm sorry, but I fail to see one good game in the entire package. The only slightly redeeming feature is that it is free! You really must get hold of T2 The Arcade Game (see page 68) to realise the Menacer's potential. MENACER LIGHT GUN. FROM: SEGA.

"GVG PAGOREV CVC SUPER NINTENDO ARCADE BY JVC/LUCASFILM .00 alat plans intes to propri It's been a long, long time coming, but finally we get our sweaty mitts on one of the most publicised Super Nintendo games ever Super Star Wars! Created by JVC and Lucasfilm, Super Star Wars pays homage to the greatest sci-fi movie ever! The Empire are closing in on the rebels, who have just stolen the blueprints for the most powerful weapon in the universe, The Death Star. Before being taken prisoner by Darth Vader, Princess Leia Organa manages to program the Death Star plans into an R2 unit and eject it, along with its robot companion C3-PO, into space. They land on the desert planet of Tatooine from where the fun really begins, because the Empire is hot on the rebels' trail! To begin the game, you control Luke Skywalker, young farm-hand and son of Jedi Knight Annakin Skywalker, who was turned by Vader and forced to submit to the dark side of The Force. Luke thought it was going to be just another day think again young Jedi!! Super Star Wars is an amazing game. I can say that with hand on heart because from beginning to end it's a sensation; hit the Start button and there's an almost perfect reproduction of the movie's intro! The SNES has been used to full effect to create the most amazing effects ever seen in a console game most impressive are the stages which use Mode 7 to create such delights as the landspeeder levels and Death Star battle sequences; simply awesome. A special mention has to go to THE best music ever heard in a video game. JVC have converted the Star Wars tunes note for note, with instruments sounding so real you'll want to whack up the volume, shut your eyes and pretend you're at the cinema! Super Star Wars is platform action ahoy with bits bolted on. Sprites and backdrops are perfect, there are lots of levels and none of them are a pushover and because you're only given three continues it's going to take some serious That's not Obi Wan-it's Alec Guiness lightly wrapped in an old blanket! Don't look now, but Obi Wan Kenobi is right in front of you. WHICH ONE WILL YOU CHOOSE? You've seen the film countless times and wished that you could be Han, Chewie, Luke or even Princess Leia. In Super Star Wars, you can do just that! Beginning the game with Luke, the further into the proceedings you get the more characters become available to you. Chewbacca is the first hero you'll meet he's at the Cantina in Mos Eisley spaceport, and you can choose to beat up the patrons using either the Wookie or young Luke Skywalker. And the Sandperson is toast! The light sabre is actually bet ter in this situation than a blaster. "


"DESERT RATS The first nasties you'll encounter are Womp Rats which, if you're an avid fan of the movie, you'll remember as the creatures Luke used to builseye in Devil's Canyon! As you progress, you'll come face-to-face with evermore weird and wonderful nasties, from scorpions that split in two when you blast them, to Jawas on jetbikes. Sandpeople and the Empire's crack Stormtroopers. Some are more dangerous than others, especially the lads that carry heavy armoury with them, so watch your step! USE THE ICONS. LUKE! GUN: Powers up your blaster. If a twelve-foot womp Rat was exploding in front of you. wouldn't you be legging it out of there? LIGHT SABRE: Lengthens your energy bar. Yuk! \"Help me Obi Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.' HEART: Replaces lost energy. LET'S LOOK AT THE LEVELS! El BIG HEART: As small heart, but adds more energy. SHIELD: Short-term invincibility. DETONATOR: Clears screen of enemies. While the programmers have used a bit of artistic license, Super Star Wars actually follows the plot of the movie quite closely. Starting on foot in the Dune Sea, you then pick up your landspeeder and head toward the Jawas' Sandcrawler inside which R2-D2 is held captive. Following this you must scuffle with the Sandpeople and their Banthas before picking up Obi Wan Kenobi and heading for Mos Eisley and the Cantina where you hire Han Solo, Chewbacca and their ship, the Millennium Falcon. Blast your way through the Death Star and jump into the cockpit of an X-Wing fighter as you attempt to destroy the Emperor's deadliest weapon in a stunning 3D shoot-outthe graphics may look good in these shots, but Super Star Wars has graphics that really have to be seen to be believed! Blimey, that's big! DARTH VADER HELMET: Bonus points. SO No-one messes with Chewie especially not these low-life Cantina patrons. TIMER: Increases time left to complete level. MODE SEVEN HEAVEN! Thank the Lord for the Super Nintendo's Mode 7! Those computer whizkids down JVC way have pushed those custom chips to their limit, to give some amazing levels of into-the screen action and excitement! Blow up Jawas in your landspeeder as you attempt to make it first to the Sandcrawler and then the Cantina at Mos Eisley, and be awe-struck by the incredible end stage as you hurtle down a canal in the Death Star while pursued by TIE-Fighters. Brilliant! SOLID C OLOR soge93 Not long to go before the ventilation shaft comes into view: ready your torpedoes and watch out for those TIE Fighters! *Look at the size of that thing! GVG 017 "


"AVG KDT DIDE Daun Look out Stormtroopers! I don't ever remember any game getting me in such a frenzy since I first bought a SNES. I've never seen as many people move so fast as when I first turned this on. Super Star Wars got the whole of CVG towers into the games room as everyone fought to get a look at what was making such brilliant noises! So it's fair to say that Super Star Wars made quite an impression on us, and so it should. The game features some of the best graphics yet seen on the SNES, especially on the amazing X-Wing level! As for the most important aspect of the game gameplay there's no worries there at all. It's absolutely rocks! You've got a stack of levels to get through and it will take you ages to get anywhere. But the difficulty level has been pitched just right you get that little bit further every time and it's sooo addictive! Some importers may be charging outrageous prices for this but I'd recommend you get it whatever the cost! PAUL ANGLIN There's Mos Elsley, on the horizon. Now the fun REALLY starts! KILL 'EM ALL! At the end of each level is a guardian who bars the way to the next stage of the game. First up is a Sarlac Pit Monster a bit strange, considering that it didn't make an appearance until the last film in the trilogy, Return Of The Jedi. From here, you'll run into all manner of beasties, from Banthas to big robots; each of which has an energy bar which must be fully depleted before it will eventually roll over and allow you to get to the next level. Gumph! NOW HERE'S A REAL LIGHT GUN! Luke begins with his trusty blaster, but after meeting up with Obi Wan Kenobi young Skywalker inherits his father's Light Sabre the weapon of a Jedi Knight. You can switch between both, and the blaster can be powered up by picking up the gun icon which is occasionally dropped by baddies. Super Star Wars is an ultra movie-like experience. From the opening intro, with its booming Star Wars soundtrack and laser effects, to the animation sequences that separate the levels, you know your money has been well spent. The game is as entertaining as it is challenging; the action flows along logically and scrolling is near-perfect. Special effects, previously only seen in Axelay, make the backdrops as mesmerising as the scores of sampled sound effects that include Chewbacca's howl, scorching gun noises and Jawas' screeching. It's a little hard at first, but only in a couple of places are you unfairly robbed of life, and even then you'll find a way around the problem. The game even incorporates a feature that lets you scroll around the surrounding area before making a vital eleap, to see what's below. This is the best platform/arcade adventure I've played for a long while and, at , it's almost worth it! STEVE KEEN The band won't give up that easily.

"EVA 3 PAGE REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO Charging up for the big one, Juggernaut-style! ANN. PLATFORM BY NINTENDO .99 BY NESTENDO Il but one of the notorious Super-Hero team, the X-Men, have mysteriously disappeared and only Gambit remains at liberty. On a routine night crawl, Spidey spies Gambit's shady silhouette in a back street. Just as the webbed wonder is about to swing down for a chat, a garbage truck pulis up alongside and sucks the last X-Man into its belly! The quick thinking crawler speedily attaches a Spider-tracer onto the truck and swings off into the night, hot on Gambit's trail. It turns out the whole gang's been imprisoned by the kooky assassin, Arcade. He's manufactured a massive million-dollar fun fair and filled it with diabolical traps, games and deadly toys. It's here that you pick up the scent and begin your adventure! Are you man or spider enough to rescue the team and escape the arcade? ARCADE'S REVENGE SPIDERMAL This is the Spider Man game we've all been waiting for! Not only can you control your favourite wall-weber, but his buddies as well! Each character is excellently drawn and animated, but it's Parker who steals the show with his arachnid acrobatics. With five heroes to choose from, all with their own special abilities, it's hard to see how this can fail. And there are hordes of baddies, not to mention ten super-villains, to ensure a Marvel-ous time! With the five different characters comes five different playing styles. This might put you off at first as one or two of them are quite slow moying, but don't let this dissuade you from playing right through. Other sections will more than make up for these minor short comings. Spiderman and the X-Men remains stylish and bright and if you can put up with the annoyance of only having four lives to play with, you'll have a riot. CORE 85600 LET THE GAMES BEGIN ou INZWISTON bright y After finding the trapped SuperHeroes, the fun really starts! Arcade challenges each of the captives to two events inside his amusement park.

"GVE 3 PAGE REVIEW HOUSE OF HORRORS SCORE S Chasing Arcade. Even Toys 'R' Us don't stock gadgets like these! Just a few of the traps and terrors that await the team are giant buzz-saws, huge toy soldiers and crazy cackling, clowns that hound Wolverine. Spider-Man has to deal with bomb and concrete-throwing monsters, scaffolding, and metal mesh girders that entangle him. Where as Storm's in the water fending off razor-toothed piranha and spear-firing scuba-divers! Bazookoid-blowing mutants and plasma-shooting droids hassle Cyclops whilst massive spiked pinballs, manic chess pieces and revolving platforms abound for Gambit. And that's just for starters! Get to the top of a level and you've then got to rumble with the super-villains! It's a pity these guys just can't see eye to eye. GOODY GOODY YUM YUM! DEAL PENSausa SEX PHOTOCYPHE SSSYRTINERRUC When you've run out of road, climb the walls. Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker gained the strength and agility of said creepy crawley! He can stick to walls, spin webs and detect danger with his advanced 'Spider Sense. With the ferocity of a beast and the skills of an international secret agent, Wolverine is one of the most dangerous men alive! Some time in his murky history his skeleton was laced with Adamantium, and with claws installed in his forearms, he can even cut through solid rock. Scott has the awesome ability to fire beams of devastating energy from his eyes. He is the leader of the XMen's Blue Strike Force and, without the special rubyquartz visor, he can never open his eyes without endangering those around him The elemental marvel can control the weather to the point of generating awesome lightning bolts. But it's her strength of character and understanding that makes her the admired leader of the XMen's Gold Strike Force. The cunning Cajun has speed that defies logic and a smile to warm the fiercest heart. If that doesn't work he also has the power to energise objects and deepfry any target crazy enough to get in his way! Kaaa-Boooom! LEVEL IT OUT This is no time for clowning around. Spider-Man and the X-Men takes the form of a platform adventure starring some of the most successful SuperHeroes of all time. The game's great strength is its depth of gameplay. You start the game controlling the webslinger himself and you move on to controlling the X-Men. The beauty of it is that all the levels change according to who you control. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that the graphics don't look too impressive. They're a little small, but well detailed and brilliantly animated, so there's no real problem. When I first sat down to play Spider-Man I was horrified. The first level seemed crap! But once you make it into the game properly it's action all the way with the Uncanny X-Men. PAUL ANGLIN CORE With Peter Parker first seeing Arcade's truck, it's only natural that you start the game with Spider-Man. The first task is to disable the security system by swinging from platform to platform and webbing the gun emplacements. Once inside Arcade's base, you can choose any of the heroes to continue the challenge with. Cyclops' challenge takes him underground into a mining shaft, eventually battling hand-tohand with Master Mold. Arcade knows the X-Men's powers very well and, because Storm can fly, places her in a series of flooded compartments which are difficult to move around in. She must avoid the perilous pets and find the valves to flood the right rooms. Gambit's task is much more manic. He must find his way through the level whilst being chased by a huge spiked pinball! Get through that and he'll face the Black Queen. Wolverine is imprisoned in the fun house. Slashing, through his enemies will be easy at first, but once at the top he'll have to deal with Juggernaut and a ton of trouble! 22 Naaa, na, di, na, na!

"GVG CVE REVIEW MEGADR ARCADE BY SEGA .99 TAKE A DEEP BREATH Il was silent in the big -blue. The only noise to be heard was the sound of the waves crashing against the base of the cliffs. Then suddenly Ecco appeared into the emptiness. He had been searching for his family for days, ever since they had been mysteriously whisked away by a huge wall of water that had swept all life out of the ocean. Somehow, Ecco had managed to escape the disaster and had been searching for any other survivors all this time. He had sung all the songs he could remember to try and call to others but the silence remained unbroken. Ecco had to keep moving: he had to find his family. But he was all alone in a big ocean that was new and unfamiliar to him... As anyone who has ever seen an episode of Flipper will know, dolphins cannot breathe underwater they must constantly come to the surface for air. Ecco is no different; if you leave him underwater for too long his oxygen meter will run out. If this does happen Ecco will simply draw off his life meter until that is gone and he becomes an ex-dolphin. You can fill Ecco's lungs in two ways if there is enough space, Ecco can jump out of the water and fill his lungs with air but if there are only tiny little gaps Ecco can just poke his nose out and take a few deep breaths. Also, if Ecco manages to find a secret underwater air pocket he can refill from there. These are shown on the map as air bubbles, and there are that many around so plan your route wisely. Look at all those jellyfish! IT'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE Dolphins emit a high-pitched sound which they use to talk to each other and also as a kind of sonar. Ecco uses this ability to view the layout of the area he is in. This is extremely useful when you're trying to locate certain objects, as they will all appear on the screen in map form. The sonar also comes in handy when you find other lost creatures, such as other dolphins and the odd killer whale. By firing a sonar at these, Ecco can chat to them and gain useful information about his quest. Ahh, that's better. Phew! Just made it. THANKS The first thing to hit you about Ecco is its incredible graphics. They really are stunning; animation is beautiful and the ocean atmosphere has been captured perfectly. The music is suitably soothing and, although some of the sound effects aren't the best ever, they add a fathomable depth. In terms of gameplay, Ecco stands head and dorsals above anything seen in recent months. It starts off difficult and gets harder, but you'll be so pleased when you eventually work out the puzzles. Some will have you swimming round in circles for ages as you try to figure out such things as how to rescue the little dolphin without going past the Octopus! Ecco may seem a bit wet at first, but believe me, once you've dived into its amazing depths, you'll never look back! to Shekhana Consoles (081 889 9412) for the review cartridge. If you ask nicely, it'll tell you a secret. CRYSTAL BALLS PAUL ANGLIN During his travels, Ecco will come across Glyphs special crystals that contain vital information about your quest. They can offer information or give you the power to move other Glyphs out of the way. You can use Glyphs in two ways those that give you powers have to be barged, but others that give you messages must be contacted using your sonar. The Glyph will then give you it's message and the info that you get can be that important bit you've been searching for for ages or as useful to Ecco as knitted gloves. But don't forget a lot of the secrets to levels are hidden inside Glyphs. GVG 024 A typical Sunday afternoon for Ecco. "


"REVIEW GVC Ecco and pal swim to safety. ALL ALONE IN THE BIG BLUE So why do they call you Eight Arms? During the search for his family, Ecco will come across a number of young dolphins that have also become lost due to the storms. It is your job to rescue them and get them safely back to their pods (just in case you don't know, a pod is a group of dolphins). When you see a lost dolphin, fire your sonar at it and it will ask you for help. Swim slowly in front and it will follow you. You have to be extra careful when swimming through tight hazards though, because the youngsters can't take much of a battering. Games about dolphins are nothing new. Actually, they are; to my mind, this is the first video game featuring a dolphin as the main character. I approached Ecco with some reservations; after watching Anglin playing for a short time, it seemed to me that the action was minimal and slightly tedious. And wasn't I wrong! This is one of the best games you'll play on the Megadrive, or any other format for that matter. Graphically you can't fault it; definition and animation is first class, and there's a stunning shimmering water effect which has to be seen to be believed and even then you won't believe it! There's a bit of map-making in there, as well as a bit of puzzle-solving, a hint of arcade action, a touch of rescuing in fact, there's a whole heap of different genres lumped into this one classy package. Looks can be deceiving, and if you think Ecco looks dull you'd be right. But buy the game, settle down with your joypad and prepare to be amazed! PAUL RAND got to be worth ten points.

If you want to swim down a chasm and there's a strong current pushing upwards, the only way to get through it is to find one of the movable rocks.

"GVE REVIEW SUPER NINTENDO REVIEW 11 3. CYBERNA SHOOT 'EM UP BY NINTENDO .00 THE VULCAN IN ALL ITS GLORY BODY SHIELD The Valken suit can take one hell of a battering, but to preserve its energy even longer, put up the Body Shield to protect you from heavy fire. Aybernator sees future earth running out of the fossil fuels that power Earth's generators and heat the world's homes. Things look bleak but luckily, in our near future astronauts discovered a distant moon that was rich in fuel and began mining it to ship back to Earth. However, a rival world had designs on the energy themselves and sent a massive task force to the moon to grab the goodies. That's when the Valken were created; huge armour-plated, blast-resistant body suits, small enough to infiltrate the enemy's massive carriers yet powerful enough to blow eight types of crap out of them! Years later, the war is still raging and a young Marinetrained Valken warrior is about to embark on his debut mission that warrior is you! BODY GLOVE Cast from purest granite with a titanium covering, the Body Glove can reduce the strongest of metals, rock and compounds to rubble with a few blows. It is for use in restricted areas and close combat. THE VULCAN Your combat chassis is equipped with the latest in high powered, armour piercing artillery. The vulcan is auto-loading, fully automatic and capable of firing ten rounds per second before reloading. The standard spraying effect has been Incorporated for blanketing effects and sporadic fire. JET PACK As you'd imagine it takes an enormous amount of power to manoeuvre the Valken and the machine can produce quite a jump when the need arises. For extra lift the latest models have been fitted with a jet pack that kicks into action for a few seconds with a press of the button. There's tons to tear apart in this game and it's hard; harder than Paul Anglin's head! The Valken sprite issized to give a good perception of its true weight and power. The animation's great too, as the beast stomps backwards and forwards, swinging its massive arms in wide circles, peppering the decks with bullets. Some enemy marines will eject from their doomed suits, get up and start running around your ankles! On later levels they try and grenade you from under neath, but you can rip the midgets to shreds with machine gun fire excellent! Everyone else has gone completely ape over this cart, but I don't like it as much as, say, Axelay or Super Aleste. For one, there are only three credits and if you fail a level you'll go way back to the beginning. Also, the constant interruption by needless text, often four or five paragraphs fong, drags the game down. However, the feel of controlling the huge robot and the pace of action make Cybernator one of the best blasts available. FOOT BOOSTERS Subtlety and surprise of attack are achieved by using the Dash. These tiny rockets in the Valken suit's heels whisk the huge frame across platform surfaces at a rapid pace so that you can fire on opponents before they even know you're there. BRIDGING THE LANGUAGE BARRIER If you're going to get hold of a copy of the game, make sure you get a UK or USA version. It's loaded with onscreen text and, unless you've got a degree in Japanese, the oriental cart will be a real disappointment. Character story lines crop up everywhere to tell you the latest in interplanetary news and how the war is going. The plot changes with your actions, so if you can't understand the text you'll be up the creek without a boat! (Left) One-on (Right) Bombarded one; my money's by unripe banana on the grey boy! skins whatever next! STEVE KEEN CMG 028 "


"EVIEW GVG MOVIE MAGIC HOW ABOUT A PICK-ME-UP? Anyone who's into top Jap cartoons like Akira will probably be gagging at Trouble in the roof-tops. the sight of Cybernator.

Samurai swords, just like here! Although I do agree with Steve on the \"too many text interruptions.\" front, it has to be said that he's nitpicking slightly. Cybernator is excellent! The main sprite robot has been heavily influenced by Gundam robots from the vast range of Super Deformer games available for the SNES. The game takes the form of an out-and-out blast frenzy, the like of which you've never seen before. The action starts off hard and gets ridiculously more so by level three in fact you'll be frothing at the mouth by the time you eventually get through to the end. The graphics are brilliant, with explosions bursting out of the screen at you, and the action never lets up; it seems to play at two speeds one hundred miles an hour or stop! Gameplay is slick and horribly addictive and would be even more so if it wasn't for the unnecessary amount of interruptions. If you only buy one blaster this year make sure you buy this I have! PAUL ANGLIN STRATEGY SKILL Meet Jake the hero and his romantic interest, Miss Thingamie! A JOY TO (BE)HOLD! Manipulation of the Valken suit can be quite mind-boggling at first. Some stages like the platforms will be a doddle, but on others, it can be a real handful. The pad's not redefinable but there are four different control selections.

"A SLAP HAPPY CHAPPII Another month, another worthless batch of cretinous witterings to wade through, laugh at and regurgitate in the pages of CVG. Some mags make up their letters not CVG; we're not scared of showing just how half-witted our readers really are. That's what the boys tell me, anyway — they only have to see the letters that are «lucky enough to get printed. If you want to waste my time by asking for the  prize, why not write to: YOB'S INANE MAILBAG, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. Dear Yob, Do you think your mag is so ace? Well I've got some ra sad news for you and your Crew. In part 2 of your Streetfighter Guide, in the section called 'Beating Vega' you notice that you missed out the motorbike man, E Ho and printed Blanka twice! What is the world coming to wr can't even sit down in my armchair and read how to batte Vega with the blubber butt? I think you've all got mad Cow disease! You may think I'm over-reacting, but I'm not. And you disagree I'll come over to your cardboard box of a hous and kick your head in, so don't mess with me. Daniel Bertram, Leeds SONG OF THE W(H)ALES YOB: You're absolutely right Daniel, we were wondering when some eagle-eyed clever clogs would spot that one. Then again, Vega is the easiest character to beat with Honda, so you shouldn't really need any help. Simply jump up and down on the spot and slap him when he comes close with a high fierce punch. It could take some time, but you'll get him eventually. Thanks for pointing it outnow get a life, will yah! ars are fat, spod Gareth are always ch I think is very rude Dear Yob, In issue 133 there was a sad git called Trystan Nichols who wrote in saying that all computer players are fat, spotty chunks of crap. But writes 'l play games on my C64 (blah blah blah) my friends Luke and Gareth are always talking about their SNES in class and Streetfighter 2, not paying attention to the teacher, which I think is very rude.'I mean, what kind of a prannie is this guy to write something like that?! But even worse, he insults himself and his friends! However, you can't really blame him; he is from Wales after all! Adam Perkins, Cambridge YOB: Never underestimate the dark side of Wales! Huge, sinewy men roam the countryside, terrifying tourists with their close harmony singing and leek dancing! All that vegetable-bashing is bound to take its toll in the end! YOB'SY A LYNX THAT'S GONE CRAPPY ANY TIME ANY PLAICE Dear Yob, I am getting a SNES with Streetfighter 2 and I need the answers to these questions: 1. Which game do you think I should buy next Lemmings, Sim City or Super R-Type? 2. Is Streetfighter 2 Championship Edition going to be released on the SNES? 3. Is the Streetfighter 2 cartridge that comes with the machine the English version? 4. I have heard that the English version of SF2 runs faster than the US one is that true? Neil Skinner, West Sussex Dear Yob, How about giving me a break and not throwing any insults at me, just give me some proper answers? First of all I want to save up for a Megadrive and I see that Japanese Megadrives are cheaper-great, but I also want to buy a Mega CD. Now, would an official Mega CD work with a Japanese Megadrive ? Also would the Jap Mega CD play UK and USA games as well as Japanese disks? On another note, have an Atari Lynx that has gone wonky the screen is white and occasionally it buzzes. I've checked the games so I know it's the Lynx. I bought it less than four months ago, but have misplaced the receipt and the serial number has rubbed off the bottom. What can do about it? Please help! Ross Elliott, Loughborough YOB: 1. How should I know? It's a question of taste! My vote would go to Super R-Type though. 2. I doubt it. As we revealed exclusively in the January issue, we have it from a very reliable source that Capcom's next release in the Streetfighter saga will be Streetfighter Turbo, with souped-up moves and weapons, but you'll have to wait and see! 3. Double Doh! With a side salad of complete ineptitude to go! Of course it is, you dim git! 4. Any cartridge that uses an adaptor to run will probably seem a little slower, but not significantly so. Anyway, there's a cheat that you can stick into the Action Replay cartridge to make the game run at a superfast speed, so if you're worried snatch up a copy of that! YOB:Tough questions to answer, seeing as the Mega CD isn't even released over here yet! I'd guess that an official CD won't work with a Japanese Megadrive. Getting another country's cart to work on your Megadrive only involves shaving off a piece of plastic inside the hull, but CD is totally different. Once again you'll have to wait and see what clever jiggery pokery the Japs stick onto their disks. As for your Lynx, all machines are guaranteed for a year. Losing your receipt was a sad move but it doesn't affect your rights. Any proof of purchase will do, cheque numbers, bank statements, credit card vouchers and so on. Even if you pay cash, many shops will keep copies of receipts. Always talk to someone with the authority to make the decision to return your Lynx. If after all of this, you still have no joy, then write a letter to their boss. "


"ONE-SIDED FIGHT SEEDY ROM PROBS Dear Yob, Don't slag me off or I will sue your ass! If you are smart you will print the answers to my questions. 1. Will Streetfighter 2 be the Champion Edition for Commodore? 2. Which will be better the SNES or the Megadrive version? 3. Have you got any cheats for Streetfighter 2 on the SNES? Aidan Wallace, Frelano Dear Yob, Now, I have a UK SNES and don't know what to do about all this CD-ROM business coming out for it. I was reading that Sony will be producing a video games system that can play both SNES carts and the new CD-based software. Would it be wise to sell my SNES and buy this Sony CD-ROM? Will it be 32-bit? Are there any soccer games planned for it? And when will you be getting any information about Sony's CD-ROM in CVG? Danny C, London YOB: YOB: Sony have got together with Nintendo to produce a CD-based Play Station, but details are very sketchy at the moment. Nintendo seem to think that they'll have a fully functioning standalone CD unit for the SNES in UK stores by September, but it could be even earlier if Sega gets its Mega CD onto the streets by Spring, so I think you'd be very unwise to sell your SNES now wait and see what's coming up during the next few months. s streets by Spring September, they'll have a tation 1. Dumb-assed, monkey-brained, orangutanfaced, rodent-breathed maggot! 2. Flea-infested, wig-wearing, garlic-smelling, wart-ridden skunk! 3. You festering pile of alligator's puke, you Pot Noodle-loving insect eater, you pubescent cockroach on the backside of life! Have you had enough or do yah want some more? If you have any more questions, kindly cut out the middle man and drop them straight in the bin! AUBAG WHITE CHRISTMAS Dear Yob, Get a life! Is insulting other peoples' letters the best you can do with your pathetic existence? I just bought a Megadrive for R700 (that's South African Rand to you) and, since you're too stupid to know the current exchange rate, that's a hell of a lotta money. As you're an all-wise butt-head, tell me why it's so damn expensive (shipping can't cost that much). Jason Roos, South Africa PS You make me sick. YOB:It's probably due to the fact that only about 2% of the people who live in your country can afford to have electricity in their homes, let alone a Megadrive. If you can't sell the units in bulk you have to make a profit somewhere along the line! And as for the exchange rate, it's currently R4.5 to the pound if you're buying and R5.2 to sell. So stick that up your water cannon and smoke it! PS If I make you sick you should have seen what I had for breakfast; I can send you the regurgitated samples if you insist! CVG SCAPEGOATI TO PC OR NOT PC Dear Yob, What's up? I'm writing on behalf of all PC owners, because you're totally fabulous and clever. I just thought I'd mention that PCs aren't getting enough good games. Okay so we have X-Wing, Monkey Island and Fate Of Atlantis, but what about Turrican 2, Chase HQ, Lotus 2 and 3, Jaguar XJ220? The list is almost endless. It's just not fair; Amiga and ST owners get loads of software, but PCs only get a third of what is released on those machines. I'm sure there are twice as many people with PCs as Amigas. If there is a reason behind this I would love to hear it. I'm not complaining, I just think that you are the games geni of the universe and you should be doing Gamesmaster! Rory O'Kelly, Ireland YOB:Firstly the games that you mentioned are all arcade-based and the PC has great difficulty handling these types of games. Slap in an aircraft sim or adventure and it can't be beaten, but give it massive arcade-type sprites and it freaks! Yes, there are more games for the Amiga, but usually the games you get for a PC will beat those on other formats in quality and presentation. Lastly, although the rest of the world is going PC crazy the UK sells far more Amigas and STs for games use than PCs at present but things are set to change, not least with the launch of Amstrad's Mega-PC.

"EXCLUSIVE YOB CLUB A SACKFUL OF PRAISE! Dear Yob, Your mag is brill and I'd first like to say how sad all the readers that try to insult you are. They never get away with it and if you take my advice and have the addresses of idiots like Aman Kundraw in issue 133 you'll go to his house and give him a huge kick in the happy sacks and one from me, too! Andrew Wallace (YOB Fan), Wales Dear Yob, 1. What is the best hand-held available? 2. Is the JB King joystick compatible with the official SNES? 3. Why are you such an excellent bodacious person? 4. Do you have a fan club and can I join? 5. What is Axelay like? 6. Can I go with Jazza to the next CES show in America? 7. Any chance of a job? P.S. Why don't you go on Gamesmaster David Skull, Hull YOB:I doubt if he has any happy sacks to kick, but thanks for the thought! CRETIN CONVENTION YOB: 1. The PC Engine GT, if you can afford it. 2. No. 3. Beats the hell out of me! I brush my teeth three times a year, only pass wind in other people's company and eat the best refuse that money can't buy! Now if that isn't the action of a divine being I don't know what is! 4. Yeah! Membership's three and a half thousand quid (cash only) and a year's subscription to Cheer Leaders Monthly. 5. The monkey's nuts! 6. Too late he's already gone! 7. If Paul Anglin messes up another Reader Challenge you might just be in with a chance! PS The crew regularly appear on Gamesmaster even though the TV show has its own rag, it can't do without the expertise of the CVG Boys! Dear Yob, Why do all the cretinous smeg-heads on the face of this jolly little planet keep bothering you with useless crap about how brilliant their new console is? Just because they lash out their carefully hoarded pennies on a spanking new console, they think that no one else in the console world has the dosh to do the same! And as if that wasn't enough, they crack some stupid jokes and think they're funny! Could you please take all the letters that these cretins write, ram them down their throats and tell them that if they think they're going to win Yob's elusive  star prize they must be in dream land. Instead you should steamroll over them while they are lying on a bed of nails, scoop up the resulting soggy mess and stick it in their cartridge slots. I am a SNES owner who's on a mission to wipe out cretins who choose to show off their new hardware by writing to Yob with their cretinous drivel. Keep up the good insults. Kenny Bukerstaff, N. Ireland YOB:Naff Off! BS NEO GAME-OS Dear Yob, I have some questions for you to answer and print in your amazing mag. 1. What are the best five games on the Neo Geo? 2. Are there any good platform games for the Neo Geo? 3. When is Streetfighter 2 going to be released on the Neo Geo? 4. When will the prices for Neo Geo games fall? 5. Please please please will you send me  to help me buy a Neo Geo? Phil Hewitt, Scarborough YOB: 1. It's hard enough to find five games on the Neo Geo, but here are mine. View Point (when it's released), Soccer Brawl and Sengoku. I know it's only three, but I said it was tough! 2. Sengoku. 3. It isn't. 4. When Nelson gets his eye back. 5. No. DERRANGED DRIBBLINGS JEALOUS MINDS Dear Yob, Yes, yes, YES! It's coming soon the new turbo charged GX4000, called the GX4500/P1. This hot bit of kit plugs straight into the back of the GX4000 and then starts cooking! Not only does this essential item allow super scaling and real rotation, it also adds a few billion colours, umpteen layers of parallax, wobble-otion rasters, 64-bit, 10-squillion channel CPU clocked at 196 MHZ-it even has its own built-in VIC-20 emulator! So forget about Amigas, Segas, VIC 20s and even Nintendos and purchase a GX4000 plus the new GX4500/P1. But be quick-stocks won't last, especially with this weather. Alan Mstrad, Brouhahas Dear Yob, Just answer my questions and don't give me any lip, yah hear! 1. Is Probotector any good? 2. Please tell me the code on Streetfighter 2 for SNES to make it turn into Streetfighter 92. 3. Why is Yob's mailbag so good? 4. Please make sure you tell me the Streetfighter 2 code so that I can make my mate jealous, because he says he has it but I don't believe him. David Lauton, Duffryn YOB: 1. Yes. 2. No. 3. 'Cos I write it! 4. Oh, alright then. Just press XXXXXXXXXXXXXX YOB:Please close the door on your way out. "

"ZUG PAGE REVIEW IVE SUPER TRICK-OFF MEGADRIVE SPORTS SIM BY US GOLD .99 HELP! I'M CORNERED! TIEKTE ver the last three years, the football genre has seen one real benchmark game Kick Off 2 on the Amiga and ST. Quite simply, Anco's classic is one of the most playable, exciting and addictive titles ever. It's already been converted to a vast amount of different formats, from Super Nintendo to Game Gear, with varying degrees of success. With a pitiful amount of soccer sims on the Megadrive, let alone good ones, 16-bit Sega owners have been crying out for a decent version of our national sport on their systems; US Gold reckon that their Kick Off 2 convert, cleverly dubbed Super Kick Off, is just such a game. Are they right? Is it Premiere League stuff or ready for relegation? All the best footy teams are wellsmart at taking corners, and it's important that you learn this skill as it could save your bacon when you're a goal down and time is fast running out! Unlike all other versions of Kick Off, the Megadrive game does not furnish the player with an eight-direction box all you've got to do is push the joystick to the position you see fit and hit that button! The ball will sail in whatever direction you have chosen ready to search out your striker and bang a goal off. Corners Made Simple. Lesson One kick. JUST A TOUCH It's as though every soccer sim these days lets you curl the ball in mid-flight, but it was Kick Off 2 which successfully introduced the feature. Simple to perform, just push the directional control left or right immediately after you've kicked the ball to bend in the direction you choose very handy if the opposition keeper's a bit tasty. Having played more versions of Kick Off than most I can say that some have been the bee's knees, others have turned out a disaster. I'd heard that the Megadrive convert was shaping up well, so obviously expectations were running high when I shoved the cartridge into the slot. There are two questions which need to be asked here. The first, and most important, has to be 'Is Super Kick Off a good game?' Yes it is I'd say the best football sim currently available on the Megadrive. There's a wealth of options allowing the player to tailor practically the entire game to suit his skills, and when you get into the action proper it's pleasing to note that the graphics are impressive the game fairly zips along and the controls are easy to learn it you've played a version of Kick Off before. Then you've got to ask yourself 'Is this a good interpretation of Kick Off?' I have to admit that it is; playing against an international-level computer side is too difficult to beat, and Kick Off is, by its very nature, more playable with a joystick than a pad (so grab a good Megadrive-compatible stick), but generally this is a sound title which looks good, plays well and really comes into its own in two-player mode. Hurrah Super Kick Off is king on the big Sega! PAUL RAND HAIR CVG 036 RAISING MONEY FOR NOTHING, KICKS FOR Lesson Two control and aim. Football is about kicking a ball with your foot, not smacking the nearest available opponent in the shins with your size nines, which is why there's a referee always at hand to sort out the bad boys. If you get flattened by a member of the other team you are awarded a free kick; this can be especially useful if you're near to his goal area, as it's possible to bend the ball around the wall which the opposition forms and catch the goalie unawares to score the odd stunner! Lesson Three-shoot. GOAL! "


"HVG o+:+T CHRISTIAN Who'll get there first if it's Christian, the Reds go one up! IWAS NEVER OFFSIDE, From here it looks as though nothing's available... REFT which is why Super Kick Off features a couple of cup competitions! Take on some of the best sides in the country to ultimately carry away the FA Cup or, if your skills are sufficiently high, Here's a feature that's rare in combattle it out with the cream of the puter football the offside rule! It European crop to pick up the UEFA has been used before in Kick Off Cup. There's also an international the Amiga version had a data disk competition included, featuring released called \"The Final Whistle teams such as West Germany and which included an option to let you Holland the supreme test of a choose offsides but the programplayer's mettle. mers also fiddled about with the handling of the players and ruined the overall feel of the game. If you're unfamiliar with the rules of soccer, a player is offside if, when the ball is played by a member of your team, there are no opposition As well as the various cup tournaplayers between you and their goal ments, players can participate in a (not including the goalkeeper). league competition in which each Simple, eh? player selects a team and plays his way through the season, taking on both human (if more than one player is taking part) and Megadrive-controlled opponents, with the goal of finishing at the top of the table. A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN 608222 THE CUP THAT CHEERS ...but a simple pass... Friendly games are all well and good, but there's nothing better than carrying away the odd trophy, Which one shall you practice control, free kicks or penalties? SIPEM KAKO ..can mean the difference between winning or losing! GVG 037 "


"GVC LOADS OF MODES TERTEXTOS Not everyone wants to play against the Megadrive all the timeindeed, Kick Off is famed as being one of the ultimate two-player games so US Gold have included a number of player combinations to tantalise and amaze! Go up against another human in bogstandard two-piayer mode, or even team up with a pal and take on a console-controlled team with the pair of you sharing control of the same side. And if you just want to put your feet up and watch two sides slug it out on the pitch without you having to lift a finger, select the Computer vs Computer option, make a cuppa and become an armchair supporter! I've only ever played Kick Off a few times and that was against Rand. After those attempts I kind of gave up on it for a while; the idea of being constantly thrashed 8-0 by some Northern arm chair supporter soon lost its appeal after a few weeks. Kick Off has always been a bit of a strange game in terms of conversions; there was the brilliant Master System version and the appalling Super Nintendo version! But what of the latest incarnation from US Gold? It's the biz! I could never quite get to grips with the Amiga version due to it's outrageous speed, but on the Megadrive version you're given the choice of three speed settings. The joy. pad seems to control the ball really nicely and although the ball doesn't stick to your feet, it is a little easier to control than the original. There are a stack of options to choose from, and all the rules have made it in even the offsides! The game is addictive enough in one-player mode but if there's two of you, you'll be playing into the early hours of the morning! A brilliant version of Kick Off that shouldn't be missed and it won't be long before I'm banging eight goals past Rand, just you wait and see! PAUL ANGLIN L HOFFMANN Phew!

"GVG MEGADRIVE b ) SPORT SIM BY ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 ver the last five years or so, we've seen a massive growth of interest in golf. British players such as Woosnam, Montgomerie and current world number one Nick Faldo regularly top the players' charts. Consequently, this country is constantly glued to the telly to see our boys stuff Yank golfers around the world. PGA Tour Golf 2 is an updated version of the classic Amiga and Megadrive title, PGA Tour Golf, and whilst the programmers have failed to include any European players in the cart, we've still decided to have a look and see just how much of an improvement this is over the original. Is it still a winner or is going to come in under par? PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT Not up to the challenge of immediately hurling yourself into a round? Don't despair; PGA Tour Golf 2 allows you to practice both putting and driving until you're confident enough to go for the real thing. There's a practice ground for each, and you can thwack 'n smack away to your heart's content. und Drive Hole * Par 4 + [ Stroke 1 Distance:384 yds. Club: Driver 2001 100% 157 902. 257 Tee for two? No there's only one here! Stapha 110 yards? Better use a nine iron for this shot! Hole * 6 381 yards Par 4 Why oh why do Electronic Arts keep on producing the same games over and over again? We've complained about this before they did it with EA Hockey, they've done it twice with John Madden Football and here they are doing it again, this time with PGA Tour Golf. Granted, PGA 2 is an excellent title, with a couple of new features, extra courses and slightly nippier play, not to mention lots more sampled sound effects and speech, but at the end of the day are you willing to fork out forty quid for what basically amounts to a few cosmetic alterations? Of cool, course, if you BaBy, missed out on PGA Tour Golf the first time round, you're laughing this is a definite improvement over the original and a great game to play. But if you've already got the original cart, y then you'd have to be pretty bored with the original courses to want to shell out the dosh for the sequel. TPC at Sawgrass Distance: 110 yards Blimey, that's long! Par 4 Hole *7 439 wards DRIVING ME CRAZY Listen to this man he knows what he's talking about! Some might think that driving is simply a case of jumping into a seat with the steering wheel in front of it and turning the ignition key. If that's you, you must be stupid because we're referring to the hitting of a golf ball. The art of hitting a ball with a piece of metal is an acquired one-sure, you might be able to smack it for miles, but that's no good if you're on a par three hole which requires immense accuracy. Club selection is vitally important a two-wood will send the ball flying out of sight, while a pitching wedge is used for short smacks, with various woods and irons inbetween. Practice makes perfect, and you'll get to know instinctively which is the best club for a particular situation; if you don't, you're well up the creek! PAUL RAND TPC at Sawgrass \"There's water it uou go too far left and a tough upproach shot over several hozords if you go too far right.\" Bruce Lietzke GVG 046 "


"GVG Steve Jones Makes It Look Easu Steve Jones just soored An eagle on hole 16 to go G under per and move up to 2nd place Poft Barn Putt 253 110% 757 All right, there's no need to boast about it. Brilliant shot! And it was my idea to play a shot like that! DON'T FEEL PUTT OUT Hole *5 453 yards Par Once the ball is on the green, it's time to put those woods and irons away and whip out yer putter! The view will switch to a three-dimensional layout showing your distance from the cup and the undulating ground between your ball and said hole in the turf. Returning to the play screen, taking the shot is similar to driving alter your direction if necessary, gauge the power you'll need to hole out and pray! Electronic Arts' PGA Golf Tour was an excellent game. It has been on just about every format now and with the exception of the very dodgy SNES version, has maintained its position as the best arcade golf game available. Having been all around the formats, the next progression just had to be the sequel. In this case however, EA have been hard pushed to find any way to improve on a game that offers more playability and lastibility than a toilet roll offers the Andrex dog! Consequently, EA have only managed to add three new courses and enhanced the sound and play. This certainly doesn't constitute a sequel. It's really like having course disks for anyone who already has the game. So if you've already got PGA Tour Golf, forget it! However, if you missed your chance for some top, G3 bunker action the first time around then you just can't go wrong with this. It's the plus four of all golf games and if you don't have it? get it or you'll end up being really teed off!

STRATEGY SKILL OV SOUTHWIND Memphis, Tn FAB NEW FEATURES Memphis home of fine rock 'n roll; not to mention rather smart golf courses. ACTION REFLEXES Just how can EA improve upon the original PGA Tour Golf? By incorporating three brand new courses, for one! Only Sawgrass has survived the trip over to the sequel; the new entries are Southwind, Eagle Trace and Scottsdale. Anything else besides that? There's a Draw/Fade option to select, which is useful for controlling the ball when slicing or hooking around obstacles. There's also a multiplayer Skins game too, where two or more players can fight it out for ever-increasing amounts of cash!

"GVC GVE REVIEW AMIGA BEAT 'EM UP You've got a little mole on your leg. OBRES BY US GOLD .99 The elephants look very bored. STREETFIGHTER IN THE GREAT EIGHT D. eople constantly declare their extreme hardness. But, as with anything, there can only be one supreme champion so a competition was set up to sort out the warriors from the wives. The original Streetfighter tournament saw the boy Ryu waltzing off with the trophy. Now the hard lads have begun to get restless again, so a new challenge has been thought up. This time the eight hardest folk from around the globe have decided to butt heads to see who can call themselves the World Warrior. The stage is set and you've got nothing to lose except maybe your life! As I'm sure you all know by now, Streetfighter Il consists of eight selectable characters and four computer-controlled bosses. The eight characters range from the superior skills of the great Guile, to the sadness of dodgy Dhalsim. If you want to be a real hard boy you'll have to pick yourself a character and learn all his moves. But if you want to be a real CVG type warrior you'll have to master all eight! C'mon, fat boy. Ow ya doing, mate? | Boo! TAKE CONTROL I wasn't sure what to expect from the Amiga version of Streetfighter II. Could the Amiga cope with all the different moves? The graphics have been really well recreated, with the onus on the character sprites rather than the elaborate backdrops. The fighters are fine until they move! Then you see how bad the animation is; they jump through the air as though under the influence of a disco Very Poor. disco strobe light. Moves are difficult to master, but the option to use a Megadrive joypad helps gameplay. But, unfair as it may be, any home version of Streetfighter II is always going to be compared to the SNES game. Even so, the Amiga version of Streetfighter II is a valiant effort. PAUL ANGLIN The main talking point of Streetfighter II on the Amiga was the control method. How on earth would the Amiga cope with six buttons? There was talk of special joypads being developed, or shock horror dropping some of the moves! In the end US Gold opted for a choice of five different control methods. You can use a joystick and just have punches, you can use a joystick and have only kick moves, you can have some moves on joystick and some on keyboard, you can use just the keyboard or, if you have one, you can use a Megadrive joypad! As they say, more is better than less. Now that's a smart move. Streetfighter II was hailed as the greatest two-player game of all time and the Amiga version caters for dual duelling very well. Versus mode has been lifted straight from the SNES version, letting you play in two-player mode while the computer performs such tasks as automatically keeping the score. You can also give one player a handicap (which means that Randy might be able to beat someone at last), change the location of your scrap or give yourself an infinite time limit so you're forced into a scrap to the death!

"HE cu 3 PAGE REVIEW SNES PLATFORM BY CAPCOM .99 starring MICKEY On You know how your mother nags you about playing in deserted, out-of-the-way places? Well, Mickey must have had his ears firmly sellotaped on backwards when he was told because the foolish lad still went out with his pals Goofy and Pluto to play a game of catch in the mountains. Now Pluto's not the brightest of canines, so when Mickey lobs an extra hard toss the mutt gives chase right off the edge of a cliff!! All's not lost though, as Pluto is actually whisked away by the evil Emperor Pete before he hit the deck he's been locked up in Pete's castle and Mickey's got to rescue him! Go Mickey, go! Hit the bozo in the head and move in for the kill. FANCY A DRESS? Mickey's a bit of a thespian at heart he loves to get dressed up and act out different roles. So when a wizard-type geezer materialises in front of his eyes to offer him a change of clothes, he jumps at the chance! With each change comes a whole new set of abilities; there's a fireman's outfit, magician's garb and Robin Hood get-up. You can change whenever you like, and to spare his blushes Mickey pulls a set of curtains from out of nowhere to change behind, so you never get to see his naughty mouse bits! PAUSE and mocked 'e hit He may look happy now, but wait until his ears get pierced by those nasty looking spikes! Water torture of pant-wetting proportions! HENERAL STORS SCRUMPTIOUSNESS ON A STICK! Just one gander at the screenshots will tell you that Mickey's Quest is a stunning-looking game. You'd have to have the eyesight of a myxomatosed rabbit not to notice the gorgeous colours and Disney-like attention to detail. Throughout the levels you'll be treated to some of the most impressive parallax effects and atmospheric backdrops you've ever seen! Most stunning is the Dark Forest, with its huge, menacing, twisted trees that look as though they were lifted straight out of the Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs classic cartoon! Don't blow all your money too early magic's a precious thing in this town. SE SOLD MMM TUH UCTO THE ITEMS Mickey's Magical Quest is one of the best-looking games you'll ever see on the SNES. Each world looks as though it's been snatched straight out of a movie! The attention to detail is astounding and each Mickey sprite comes complete with its own characteristics and animation. Small details like the turban slipping over Mick's face when he falls down a cliff and the curtain that he whips out to change clothes behind make this a class act. Having said that, the gameplay can be a little tame and despite the difficulty settings you'll finish it in a day or two! Even the many huge guardians turn out to be less than challenging. Most of the time it's just a case of shooting animals and collecting stuff, but around the third level Mickey can manoeuvre blocks with the hose, and a puzzle element is introduced with you having to create your own steps to climb to higher goody levels. Overall, a graphically stunning game that's far too easyyou can get better value for money elsewhere, but for presentation and graphics little else beats it! STEVE KEEN GVG 050 mosto Bi IS THERE A MOUSE IN THE HOUSE? Mickey Mouse The traditional bog-standard mouse can jump on beasties' heads and daze them a la Mario and also leap up to grab special boxes to hurl at the pests. Fireman Mickey Mickey's been a lot of things in his time and a bumbling fireman's just one of them. This one's extra good for the fire levels as he can shoot huge jets of water at the flames. Magician Mickey Another useful character, especially in the Dark Forest. As a magician you can flick tiny bolts of magic at nasties or hold on for one huge ball of angel dust. Magician Mickey can also breathe underwater. Robin Hood Mickey Great for jumping from platform to platform with his grappling hook. You'll find that you just can't get by some of the guardians without wearing this costume. "

TOP WORLD TIPS Tree Tops Pick up the fruit and double-grab it to reach unobtainable heights! You don't have to use the fruit where you found it try moving on to a different location first. Dark Forest Make a jump of faith off to the right of the last menacing tree on one of the levels and you'll drift right into a shop! Pete's Castle The blocks you find around Pete's home are not the ones you've come to know. With some skill and co-ordination they'll take you for a special ride. LEVELS UP The magical quest will take you over six totally different levels, each divided into four sub-levels. After Mickey's brief encounter with the good wizard he'll be chucked head first into Treetops. You have the power of 'action', letting Mickey grab onto things and either lift them up to throw them or pull levers to reveal bonuses. The baddies change considerably from level to level with bumble bees, flying fruit that can be clung onto for a helicopter ride to reach extra platforms, disappearing cloud walkways and huge rolling fruit that pursue you, Raiders Of The Lost Ark-style! PICK ME UP Although there are many items for Mickey to fill his ski-pants with, the most important are hearts and coins. In normal mode our hero receives three hearts per life but, by scooping up the specials, he can increase his quota dramatically. Coins are won by smashing blocks or killing certain animals but the majority of dosh comes from the big golden boxes Mickey comes across. Pull the handle and a cascade of goodies, ranging from lives and coins to hearts and fruit, come tumbling down. Fire Grotto. Mickey can move nearly all of the blocks on this level If you create your own platforms you'll find loads of surprise goodies in the ceilings. Snowy Valley Change Mickey into the fireman's outfit and use his hose to form platforms with the frozen water to reach loads of coins, extra lives and other goodies! Pete's Peak Once at the very top of Pete's Peak use the Robin Hood garb to cling onto the supports. After the bird has flown over head and its offspring comes down, use its eggs to your advantage. CG 051 "


"CVG EVE REVIEW SECRET AGENTS None of Mickey's special powers last long, but you can find extra water hydrants and magic lanterns for top ups. Alternatively, by experimenting you'll discover a number of secret doors behind blocks or in hidden chambers at the bottom of cliffs. These lead to bonus rooms or General Stores where Mickey can spend his cash on most of the items available during the game if they're in stock! I've been looking forward to this game for ages now and, when it first came in, it looked like my patience had been rewarded. Mickey's Magical Quest is easily the best-looking Disney game to date, and is even a strong contender for best graphics ever! Unfortunately in this case, beauty's only skin deep. When the amazing cosmetics of Mickey are peeled away you feel that there is something decidedly lacking gameplay! Although it's instantly playable, Magical Quest offers little challenge to anyone who can play games (Rand should have a probl em, then). The action starts better off simple and doesn't really shift up a gear at all. The main levels are pretty repetitive and the end-of-level baddies offer nothing in the way of challenge. You should be able to rescue Pluto in about three days and for fifty quid that's not really what you're after, is it? PAUL ANGLIN Here's one hot-head who's a blast to be with. Goofy's always close at hand with a change of undies! C SE THES MONSTER MADNESS NAZZY CLIMBIN On average there are not one but RITCHES two guardians on every level. Most are dead easy to kill but others are IN THIS ROPE a tad more tricky. The first is a purple snake that suddenly drops out of the trees and splits apart when you hit him on the bonce! One of the hardest baddies is found at the end of the fire level, where a hammerwielding, fire breathing demon smashes the ground from underneath you with an massive mallet. Hot stuff! See what we mean! Hold on for the flight or fright-of your life! There's no doubting the quality and feel of this game it plays well, looks more stunning than Cindy Crawford and should've been a classic. Hold on a moshould've? Cartoon games should contain humour and superb graphics and Mickey has all the Disney magic one would expect from anything with that name on it. What you shouldn't expect though, is to have to fork out fifty sovs for a game that any reasonable player will finish in a couple of days. Great value for the under-eights and novice gamers, but anyone with an ounce of skill should spend their money more wisely. GARTH SUMPTER Mode 7 Heaven! This guy must be related to Big Bird! ANIMATED ANIMAL ANTICS When you think of Disney you automatically think of quality and, as the company is world famous for its animations, you'd expect nothing less than fab movement in this game. It's not only the four different Mickeys that have been given the Disney work over though; all the animals and insects are equally swish. From huge toads that hop onto your head and bobbing barrels in the water, right down to beavers and stars that flit about as you progress throughout the world all are fantastic to watch!

"GVG GVG REVIEW TINYTOON SNES PLATFORM BY KONAMI .99 Demember those great Saturday mornings spent doing nothing but watching kiddies cartoons? Well get ready to break out the SNES 'cos those days are back. From the mind of Steven Spielberg comes the Tiny Toons, offspring of various celluloid superstars. They've had their own TV show and now star in their first SNES game. Tiny Toon Adventures casts you as Buster Bunny, the son of carrotmunching Bugs. He's having a few problems though, as the Tiny Toons home, usually a peaceful place, has fallen foul of a nasty element who have brought chaos and commotion. Buster, sets off to put them straight about a few things. Help is at hand as his friends help him out along the way. THEY'RE TINY... Buster Bunny is going to have a real hard time, trying to get through all the different levels of Toon Land. Luckily, he can make use of the one thing that no platform game should be without extra lives! The easiest way for Buster to get these is to collect the stars that appear throughout the different landscapes. Stars act in exactly the same way as coins do in Mario games; when you pick up more than a hundred you gain an extra life. They perform no other purpose, but that's a damned handy one in itself. PICKY PICKY There are a number of different pick-ups in Tiny Toons, some of which only appear on certain levels. Here's the full list: I'm an avid viewer of the Tiny Toons cartoon and this game will convert all hardened blast boys into cutesy freaks! The graphics are top notch; you're not going to find anything with a better cartoon look anywhere. Characters are brilliant I haven't seen this amount of detail since Super Mario World! All the levels have a very different look to them and the tasks change dramatically, which means that there's no way you're going to get bored with this. The American Football stage really is worth playing over and over again just for the sheer hell of it, and the squash bonus game, with the huge and brilliantly drawn Furrball, is a sight to behold. Tiny Toons on NES and Game Boy was too easy, but that's not something you can say about this. The difficulty level is set just right, allowing you to get just that little bit further every time and, with six big levels to wade through, you can expect to be playing this well after Easter. They may be tiny, they may be toony and they may even be a little loony, but I tell you what they're bloody brill! No net can hold this bunny. STAR: When you kill an enemy a star will appear (more than one if it's an end-of-level baddy). Collect 100 and you'll get an extra life. GOLD CARROT: Buster's favourite pick-up. This refills your energy bar. SILVER CARROT: Refills one energy heart. GOLD GOGO DODO: This little feller will make you invincible for a while. Use the catapult to bounce up to the next platform. TOLEDO CRYSTAL CARROT: Adds one heart, up to maximum capacity. SILVER GOGO DODO: Fills up your dash gauge. CRYSTAL GOGO DODO: Kills all onscreen enemies. BUSTER DOLL: Gives you an extra life.

I've already told you once. It's Hopalong Cassidy! THEY'RE TOONY.. THE WESTERN MOVIE Buster becomes Sheriff in an attempt to stop the ruthless Montana Max from ruining the town. Unfortunately, you won't have a gun to stop him. Bunny rabbits have dead strong legs and Buster has mastered a technique to put paid to his enemies using this strength. By pressing the X button Buster will perform a somersault dropkick manoeuvre. As violent as it may be, this is just a case of jumping on the baddies' heads. Good timing is needed to perfect this move, but once you've got it down to an art you'll be able to take out two bad guys at a time. You can land on a baddy at any time during the bounce, so it shouldn't be long before you've got your opponents hopping mad! first saw the Tiny Toons cartoon in Hong Kong, ages before it came over to the UK, and thought it was 2absolutely brilliant even with the crap foreign translation! The NES and Game Boy conversions were good, if a little easy, but after seeing early shots of the SNES game I has high hopes for the 16-bit version. And have my hopes been dashed? No siree Bob; this is one of the best platformers you can buy for the Super Nintendo! Stuffed to the gills with classy graphics, demanding gameplay and loads of levels, Tiny Toons is a cart that'll keep you glued to the joypad for some time, if only to see the gorgeous reproductions of those oh-so cute Toons! The many bonus games add to the longevity of the cart, the best of the bunch for me being Squash, starring the massively excellent Furrball! Tiny Toons is a top title; grab it while it's hot!

The object is to hit the ball against the wall to gain as many extra lives as possible within the time limit. Every time you hit the wall a bar on your counter lights up, and when your counter is full you receive an extra life. Occasionally, Tiny Toons characters will run along the back wall.

"CVG CVE REVIEW AMIGA WPIANATONES GRAPHIC ADVENTURE AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS I'd 'shelve' that bookcase-moving idea if I were you! EEEEE BY US GOLD/LUCASARTS .99 And you all thought that Indy had participated in his last archaeologyrelated romp in the Last Crusade, it being the final movie and all. But oh no; everyone enjoyed Lucasarts' adventures so much, they've only gone and created a totally original game starring our man Jonesy! As you might guess, Indiana's on the trail of the fabled lost city of Atlantis, and must find it before the Nazis. If not, they'll steal the entire stock of a previously unheard-of ore which can be found only in the sunken remains of the city. With the help of his friends, as well as the odd ancient artifact and a lorra, lorra luck, old Indy might just discover what scholars have spoken of for centuries. Then again, he might end up in the grip of Adolf's lads; it's entirely up to you! The new Indy adventure, eh? I didn't think this would ever make it to the Amiga it's a massive game. But here it is, all eleven (count 'em) disks full of fine Lucasarts adventuring! Little has changed during the switch from PC to Commodore including the solution so steer clear of the solution we printed a few months ago if you want to reap maximum enjoyment. Graphics are great; probably the best ever seen in a game like this although I'm not too keen on the full-screen stills. They serve little purpose and hold up the game. The iMUSE music system is a cracker. It changes tempo as the action dips and soars just like a real movie soundtrack. But it's the humour and taxing puzzles that really make this game; Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is full of both. Unfortunately, with eleven disks to juggle with there's a lot and I must stress a LOT of swapping to be done, but at least there's the bare minimum of waiting time between shoving the disk in and the action starting up again. Overall, the best the Amiga can do with a game such as this; a smashing game in its own right, and those lucky enough to own a hard drive will be laughing! There's a lot of statues in here, but only one offers a way out very peculiar! Wo ist Fritz? VERY IMUSE ING! This time around, Indy doesn't just have to rely on his own skills to survive and prosper he's got a girl to help him! Sophia Hapgood was a trainee archaeologist with Indy on his first big excavation, but swapped that profession for a life as a psychic, of all things! Indy needs her assistance in this quest not only for her dazzling good looks and womanly charm, but also because she's got a few artifacts from that first big dig which, it just so happens, will come in very handy when looking for Atlantis! Indiana Jones and The Fate Of Atlantis is the first Amiga game to feature Lucasarts now almost legendary Wo indeed. IMUSE system. If you've never heard of it, IMUSE has been created by Mr Lucas' computer musicians and what it does is subtly alter the mood of the background music as and when various plot changes occur for instance, if the game is quietly plodding along the music will do likewise, but were something dramatic to happen, such as Indy being confronted by one of the Nazis, the tune builds up to match the on-screen action. The system went down a storm when it was first introduced on the PC in Secret Of Monkey Island II, and is set to achieve the same effect with Indy! relandic Antiquitie SWT PAUL RAND They certainly go in for big pictures on Icelandic Antiquities Monthly!

Klaus Kerner, huh? Being a self-confessed joypadonly man I was a bit peeved at the prospect of swapping a total of eleven disks just to get Indy to put his hat on, but that's a small price to pay for a game this involving and brilliant! I may have been a sceptic at first but now can safely say that I would seriously consider turning down laser-related death in favour of a few hours puzzle solving on my Amiga. Why? Well it's really just the brilliant graphics coupled with the completely engrossing gameplay. The action starts off pretty simple but quickly draws you in and, before you realise it, it's 3am in the morning and you still can't find that rare Atlantean artifact! In fact, that's probably the only real bummer about this game you will not sleep until you find Atlantis and that's a promise. If a laserdeath junkie like me can appreciate Indy and The Fate Of Atlantis, so can you it's a stunner! PAUL ANGLIN STRATEGY SKILL There's no denying that George Lucas' Indiana Jones is one of the most dynamic movie heroes of all time. In the original Indy adventure, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Jones took on the Nazis in his search for the Ark Of The Covenant, the vessel which held the Ten Commandments when they were brought down from Mt. Sinai by Moses. Film two, Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom, although packed with spectacular stunts and stunning special effects, is something of a lacklustre affair in Walk to jungle rodent which Indy rescues children from a Give Pick up Use horde of voodoo doctors. The best of the Indy film trilogy was the last Open Talk to Push one made. Indiana Jones and The Close Look at Pull Last Crusade reintroduced the nasty Nazis and threw in a new character Aah, that poor jungle rodent. Still, it leaves Aah, that poor jungle rodent. Still, it leaves Indy free to climb that free! for good measure Indy's dad, Dr Henry Jones. The father and son duo team up to find another Bible-related artifact the Holy Grail. Where would Indy be without his trusty whip? In it deep, that's where. Have whip. will travel is Jones' motto, and it's a good thing he does carry it with him at all times, because it comes into play quite early in the proceedings. Reach the jungle and you'll come across a snake wrapped around a tree remember, Indy hates snakes. But he hasn't got to whip the serpent; no, our boy Jonesy's got to go into the jungle and use his fave weapon to scare a rodent found there Chuck yer joystick away and make it run out of make sure you've got a nice, the correct opening clean surface to play on Indiin the forest and it'li Not feeling very friendly today, ana Jones and The Fate Of be attacked by the are we?

"FUE REVIEW Andy Bogard is one of two brothers fighting for their lives on the main island. He's a Kung Fu master and can perform incredible acrobatics. The fastest of the three characters, his moves are the Dash, Spinning Dervish, Back-flip and Shield Of Force. SNES BEAT 'EM UP BY SNK .99 Dash. Turns Andy's body into a distorted blur to collide with his adversary and inflict massive damage. Push diagonal down-left, then right and hit Y. CORP NES conversions of Neo Geo games are appearing in abundance, and Fatal Fury is the latest such title. Yet another in an increasingly long line of Streetfighter clones, three fighters pit their skills against eight brutal back-street warriors before coming face-to-face with the vicious overlord, Geese Howard. Howard resides on his infamous isle, linked to the main island area by a bridge. All you've gotta do is clear the mainland of henchmen, pack up your toothbrush, grab a spare pair of trousers and hit Geese's base nay problem! CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON Each of the battling brawlers has four special moves. Here's the lowdown on what they do and how to perform them. Joe Higashi's a talented young kick-boxing champion. His four moves include the Flaming Kick, the Furious Fist, the Dashing Knee and Tornado Punch. Spinning Dervish. A great move if you can pull it off. Andy spins through the air, throwing his arms about like flails. Hit down, diagonal down-right, right, diagonal up-right and Y. Flaming Kick. A deadly move which involves striking at the opponent's head whilst forcing him backwards. It's performed by pressing diagonal downleft then pushing diagonal up-right and hitting B. Furious Fist. Only use this when in close quarter combat or when your opponent is trapped in the corner. The Flaming Fist lets Joe perform tons of lightning-fast jabs, followed by an uppercut for huge damage. Repeatedly press Y for this move. Fatal Fury is no match for Streetfighter 2. Controls are slow to react, there's the bare minimum of animation and even a little corruption of graphics during some special moves. Although the game is an adequate conversion, let's face it, Fatal Fury was never a top choice game on the Neo Geo. You can defeat nearly all the bad guys in no time by stringing a couple of good combinations together and the computer is shamefully predictable. It's a great laugh to watch Michael Max flounder about as you jump over his head time and time again, I'd rather before ripping him Pick apart he just my note doesn't know what to do! The best thing about the game is its presentation, with some very nice maps and intros sprucing up the overall package, but the deformed backdrop characters with their stupid faces and bodies ruin the whole effect. Sound's just as tame, especially when you finish a character off; the machine just babbles a bit, leaving the sprites bouncing up and down like fish out of water. That Streetfighter-beater has yet to come. Back-flip. The human spring! Mildly amusing but not very effective. Diagonal downleft, diagonal up-right and B are the keys to press. Dashing Knee. This sends Joe hurtling forward in a blur of speed to land a crushing blow to the luckless enemy. Push down, diagonal down-right, left, diagonal up-right and B for this little number. Tornado Punch. The sheer speed of Joe's uppercut as he lifts his fist from the ground is enough to generate a huge tornado of wind which can sweep an opponent off his feet. Per. form a semi circular move on the bottom half of the joy pad and hit Y for this incredible attacking manoeuvre. STEVE KEEN Shield of Force. Summoning up all his mystical powers, Andy thrusts a huge shield of plasma from his fists major damage! Push down, diagonal down-left, right and Y. Fierce! cVG 058 "


"REVIEW GUG HVA Terry Bogard is the best all round fighter. His moves are the easiest to master and execute, so pick him for top winning fisticuffs. Flaming Fist, Inverted Spinning Punch, Flaming Flip and Wall Of Fire are his forte. ISLAND HOPPING Flaming Fist. One of the most devastating moves on offer, this sends Terry shooting for ward with his fist outstretched in a sizzling bolt of speed. Down, diagonal down-left, left and Y to perform this attack. Inverted Spinning Punch. The hard hitting hero turns on his head to lash out at the villains with repeated smacks to the gob! It doesn't last very long, though. Push down, up and Y. There are eight different locations spread around the main combat island. Each location features one of seven different opponents, simply aching to take you on. Also, tucked away to one side is the bonus arena where contenders have to burst tyres for extra points. Just over the bridge lies a smaller isle the home of the King Of Fighters, Geese Howard. It's him you're really after, so go for it! STREAL BOUT THE SIMILARITY ENDS HERE Fatal Fury, the coin-op, burst into the arcades after Streetfighter had already taken everyone's spare cash away. Consequently, it failed to offer any real improvements on the Grand Daddy of all arcade machines. And so with the SNES conversion we see Streetfighter's poorer cousin once again arrive too late to make any lasting impressions. Graphics, whilst faithful to the original, are garish and at times confusing. Even the large selection of special Pmoves still leave the game without any real variety and l Stasy the sluggish controls make e precision fighting as posI sible as Stevie Wonder going four rounds with Chris Ewbank. Whilst most games pale into insignificance against Streetfighter, Fatal Fury does do better than most but once you've seen the best, you can see why this is just one of the rest. The main part of the game involves you picking one of the three principle characters and fighting towards Geese at the end. However, you'll be pleased to know that there is a oneon-one option called Street Fight (original, huh!). Don't go gaga yet though. You can only choose to be one of the original three characters all those lovely baddies remain out of your control. Aaaaargh! WHAT'S THE OPTION Flaming Flip. Our man spins over onto his back and trails out a single flaming leg for brain-busting damage! Hit down, diagonal down-left, left. diagonal up-left and B. Flaming Wall. A fire wall of increasing size that scorches toward your opponent before dying away a real match winner! Down, diagonal down-right and right. GARTH SUMPTER There are huge chasms to negotiate in Fatal Fury's option screen. There's a difficulty setting of one to nine, four different match lengths, four continues and a complete joypad programming facility. Phew! STRATEGY SKILL Home of Richard Myer, the back-flipping acrobatic karate king! He is Incredibly fast, lashing out in all directions. Burst as many tyres as you can within the time limit. OF FIG AREA SELET ACTION Duck King may sound like a dumb name but the Mohlcan-sporting punk is one tough ass!

Geese Howard is clearly head and shoulders above the other fighters, but he's not invincible. You should lick him in time-a lot of time!

"AVG zug REVIEW DIATOR MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BY VIRGIN .99 GLOR visit to McDonalds makes your day. That's how the saying goes, but we always thought they were talking about the burgers (which, incidentally, were officially classed as the healthiest around in a recent report blimey!). Young Mick and Mack were sat in their local Mac Dees reading a strange comic about pollution, when who should appear out of the blue but Ronald McDonald himself! Needless to say, the lads were somewhat surprised; even more so when Ronnie magically teleports them into the comic! McDonald Land is in danger of being polluted beyond repair, and Mick 'n Mack, armed with detergent guns, have been given the clean-up job. So pick up your joypad and do your bit for ecology! Mick and Mack AND Not only is our kiddo going to miss the gunge machine from there, he's also going to fall right into the slime below. FRIENDS OF THE EARTH Mick and Mack Global Gladiators should certainly impress the greenies out there with its good, wholesome \"Clean up for the kids' message. What's more important though, is the fact that it's actually a damn good game, too! The first thing to hit you is the quality of the graphics; Virgin's artists just get better and better with each new release! The detail put into the sprites is staggering little touches such as the boys blowing bubbles with their chewing gum and swivelling their guns around is a hoot! Sound is of a very high quality: sampled speech, a host of funky in-game ditties and a cracker of a dance track accompanying the bonus game keep the adrenalin flowing. But not as much as the game itself! A race against time and the plethora of enemies that dog you all the way, Mick and Mack Global Gladiators is yet another hit for Virgin. I'm forever blowing bubbles... Detergent guns in hands, our boys Mick and Mack have a big task ahead of them. The young dirtbusters must tackle the trash across a multitude of landscapes, starting in the Slime World and moving on to the Mystical Forest, packed with killer squirrels and man-eating plant life! If you survive all this, there's still Toxi Town and Ice World to clean up and, as each level is made up of three stages, you can imagine that the anti-pollution business is going to be a long and arduous one! PAUL RAND Hey! No-one said anything about these invisible platforms! GVG 062 Jump on the launch pad and you'll soar! "


"REVIEW EVE The best gag sent in which includes the word 'snowballs' wins a game! GREENPEACE The aim of the game is point accumulation, and Mick and Mack can score plenty if they know where to look! Dotted around the play area are little McDonalds logos which, if collected, add to your score. Some are easy to reach, but others especially those that are grouped together in bunches can only be reached by leaping onto launch pads. These, predictably enough, launch the player high into the air, enabling him to pick up scores of extra points and reach the higher levels. Visit this place it'll make your day, apparently. After almost a decade of chucking out fast food, American nippy nosh giants Mac Dee have finally made it on to console. Will the game have a nice day? Or is this just mass produced fodder for the masses? Well, strike me Ronald if Mick and Mack isn't one top game. First off, I've never seen sprites with as much personality as these fellers. The two lads bob around the screen shooting off huge blobs of slime like troopers, and even when you're not controlling them they can't stay still! The game's sooo smooth; the temptation to jump around and just let the guys glide through the jungle is overwhelming, and if that's the way you play it you'll probably not get much enjoyment from Global Gladiators. However, when you get down to some serious padthrashing you soon find out that there's a great game in there. A joy to watch and a thrill to play. The next time I get the urge for a Big Mac I'll plug this cart in instead. Well worth  of anyone's money! ILOESQUE Comical farting skunk capers abound in Mick and Mack Global Gladiators! Oi! Are you two going to sit there with empty trays all day? THE GREEN 250 Being an environmental game, you'd expect there to be a few hideously mutated creatures to kick in. Mick And Mack Global Gladiators gives you a plethora of polluted punks to pound, from bloated gunge monsters to big rubbishspreading machines. Armed with the latest in detergent gun technology, you're more than equipped to tackle these problems, but watch out! Some baddies sneak up behind you while you're happily blasting away and deplete your energy like nobody's business! STEVE KEEN STRATEGY SKILL The bonus game! Grab the trash, put it in the bins provided and don't get hit by the anvil! TOIS NOT-SENSIBLE DAVID ICKE ACTION REFLEXES It's not all platforms, shooting and destruction in Mick and Mack Global Gladiators! Collect over forty McDonalds logos and you reach the bonus stage, where you're given the opportunity to do your bit for world cleanliness in the form of a tidy-up campaign! Three bins are shown on-screen one for bottles, another for cans and the third for old bits of newspaper. All three types of object fall down the screen, and it's up to you to pick up the rubbish and put it in the relevant waste receptacle. Allow the litter to settle on the floor, or put the wrong item in the wrong bin, and you lose. It's also bonus game over time if you're hit on the head by the rogue anvils that also hurtle from the skies! ELEFRIENDS Global Gladiators that they are, Mick and Mack are a pair of cool kids. You can choose to control either character and, although they perform the same functions, they do have one major difference one's black, the other's white!

"CVG GVE REVIEW AMIGA Es Sleepwalker PLATFORM BY OCEAN $25.99 ROLE REVERSAL Vour dad may snore louder than a wilderbeast with sinus trouble when he's asleep, but I bet he doesn't get out of bed and do three laps around the living room before the toil of the next day! However, our lad Lee has just that problem. During a routine snooze he jumped out of bed and landed right on the head of his faithful dog, Ralph. The old mutt woke up just in time to spy the boy leaping straight out of the open window and screeched in horror! There's only one thing the hound could do and that was to bound out after him and make sure that he came to no harm! Lee's not far from being one of the walking dead, but Ralph's talents seem to be limitless. In order to get Lee over gaps in the rooftops, the dog can kick him up the rump or jump into the space and make a bridge with his body, Superman style! Ralph can turn Lee around, push him along to speed him up, switch places and is even armed with a club to knock seven bells out of any nightclub bouncers who are giving Lee a hard time. Good to see the lad wears undies at night! HE'S GOT THE MOVES Both master and mutt can collect a bag full of objects to make the night time adventure more interesting. Sleepwalker, being linked firmly with the Comic Relief Charity, leans heavily on slapstick humour, so the pick-ups are suitably comical. Whoopee Cushions give invulnerability, false beards drop a hint to completing the level, ear muffs put Lee into a deeper sleep, dunce's hats complete your level map and custard pies build bridges over water. In addition the five letters to COMIC are scattered around the stages and if you complete the word you'll get the chance to play a bonus stage. Watch your back! WHO'S THE MASTER A shocking time for Ralph, and there's not a Turtle in sight! Sleepwalker has such a massive media push behind the charitable release I really thought that the game would be dross. Instead it's turned out to be one of the most original games Ocean has put out since Robocop 3! The animated intro is brilliant, even incorporating Lenny Henry's voice for Ralph the dog, and the tiny touches of detail to the characters during the game really get you engrossed. Lee's nightshirt billows up around his knees when he falls off ledges and Ralph doggy-paddles with style! Although six levels doesn't sound like much they are pretty hard, but the animation's so excellent you'll be hooked for hours without takeing a breakand hey! It's for Cher-arity As Lee's in the deepest of sleeps it's up to you, as Ralph, to guide him safely through six levels of cityscape over ledges, telephone wires, skylights, perilous drops, roads and sewers. Certain obstacles, such as water-hydrants and hazardous waste, will wake the youngster up straight away, killing him with shock. So, using Ralph, you must prod the lad in the right direction and run ahead where necessary to clear a safe path. This is harder than it sounds as you can't always keep Lee in eyesight and if he hits a brick wall he's likely to turn around and walk off a cliff! Doh! Mate! Doggy-paddling for your life.

If you're really sad, (like Lord EMAP) and don't have a friend to play against, the computer does more than a fair job of controlling the other player. In fact, it's only in two player mode that you have to start to worry about cash distribution. You'll need lots of wonga to stay in the game, so make sure that you keep up with your partner in the dosh stakes. At the end of each level the cash collected is totted up and a percentage of how much of the level each player has completed is shown. If you're on speaking terms with your partner it's advisable for one to cover whilst the other grabs the lute. SKILL Do you have enough of the right stuff to bump up your other attributes or bring powerups and special abilities into play? STAMINA When the juice runs dry on this baby you're just history! SPEED Are | | you as fast as the wind or slow as a slug? INTELLIGENCE Only applies to computer controlled characters. If there's not enough in the bucket you can bet that the blockhead would be last choice in a game of five-a-side! GHARAGTERS | HIRED The two members of your all-night party. CIPE CE ACT CHARACTER PORTRAIT Can your man pull the birds? It's taken long enough to materialise, but I'm happy to say that Chaos Engine is a winner from start to finish. Renegade have packed in the detail tighter than an elephant in a Christmas cracker! Sprawling over sixteen massive levels, the action is fast and furious with just the right blend of gory monster-bashing and brain-draining puzzle solving. You couldn't want for more weapons, more pick-ups, more monsters or more surprises than are available in this game. The graphics are near-perfect, with more attention to detail than I've seen in most console games; the characters' ponytails sway as they scuttle around the screen, waterfalls stream from rock crevasses, lights flicker from behind windows and flashes shoot from the barrels of guns as they power into victims. Well worth the overly long wait, get Chaos Engine now and make those console kids green with envy! STEVE KEEN COST OF GHARAGTER You start with a sack of cash, but bodies don't come cheap and it'll soon be eaten up by these mer cenaries. KIS AVVIE CHARAGIERS NAME There are six different characters to choose from, and picking a wellbalanced team is vital for a realistic attempt at getting to the Chaos Engine. CHARACTERS FOR HIRE There are six of the meanest hombres on the planet available for hire. Even the Preacher chews baccy 'n' spits lead! GASH BALANGE The party's stash at a glance. WEAPON HELD Each character has a weapon with different qualities. Depending on the character you can collect power-ups for your man which increase the number of shots, damage inflicted or whether the puises go through monsters or not. The colour of a shot depends on the level It's been powered to red is total devastation! SPEGIAL ABILITY INVENTORY Eachman can carry up to six of these goodies. Here you'll find the ones you've Bequired. WEAPON POWER The level your chosen weapon has reached with power ups. SPECIAL ABILITY POWER Exactly as it suggests! SPECIAL ABILITY HELD You can only hold one in your hand at a time. They may be bought or found. To swap between the one you're holding and those you carry, press the Space bar. GVG 066 "


"REVIEW CV63) The game can be played on two levels, and some guys can drop bombs off ledges. Just one of the evil Engine's creations. MEET THE GANG COS THE BOYS ARE HERE! Six of the scummiest earth crawlers on the planet are offering their services to you and no two serve the same shots! The Nawie is one of the most powerful characters, being able to power up his weapons to incredible levels, while the Priest can only carry light armaments. He moves very quickly though, and can heal people without the need of a first aid kit. The weaker the character, the cheaper they are to hire; the Mercenary has a massive Gatling gun that carpets the area with bullets and the Gentleman sports the latest in flame-throwers, whilst the Brigand is endowed with double shots. Last, but by no means least, is the Thug who carries a devastating shotgun that scatters up to six death-dealing shells at a time! Boy, it looks as though those Renegades have done it again! Chaos Engine has something for everyone; there are so many avenues of gameplay it'll turn your head inside out! Play the game as a straight shoot 'em up, frying everything in sight, or get stuck into some real Sherlock shenanigans by hunting out all the secret passages and rooms hidden throughout the complex. Either way, it'll take you months to get bored with this one! Renegade have just completed their own sound system and this is its first gig. Similar to Lucasarts' iMUSE, it adds an unseen depth to Amiga games by making the music react to the action on the screen. As you walk toward streams, the sound of running water gets louder; walk away from the danger or an exit and the music loses it's pace, turn back and it builds to frantic proportions! If you thought you'd had your fill of shoot 'em ups, check out the world of the Chaos Engine you'll never want to leave! GARTH SUMPTER Donn 02 nn0741 Multi-platform action with a side salad of death! THE NAME OF THE GAME STRATEGY SKILL To get through all sixteen levels you'll need all your reflexes and wits about you. Throughout each stage is hidden a group of 'nodes' which, once hit, open the exit to the next world. A counter tells you how many nodes are on each stage and the minimum needed to open the gate. Things start out easy enough, with everything pretty obviously positioned. However, some levels have more than one exit. If you've only shot a few of the nodes and your exit's already open, it's a fair bet that hidden somewhere else is another, as yet undiscovered, route. Not only that, but there are a ton of puzzles to solve before you can get out. Moving blocks, sliding panels and false statues are just a few of the secrets that await explorers. Quite often you'll find yourself completely stuck, but by shooting some of the more oddly-shaped pieces of rock you might find keys that'll move the scenery, revealing secret areas, or stairways to other stages. SPECIAL POWERS Smooth 'n' hardand that's just the cut of his gun! I bet you wouldn't like to meet this guy on a dark night. ACTION REFLEXES MOLOTOV A ring of fireballs which shoot out all over the place in the direction the cocktail was thrown. DYNAMITE When it goes up all the monsters in the surrounding area will be toasted!

"GVG MEGADRIVE ARCADE BY ARENA .00 GUN DAMN! The T-800 may be as hard as a very hard thing indeed, but it has to be said that his gun is verging on the 'not very good' side. It's supposed to be rapid fire, and when you first start shooting it lets those bullets loose at a frightening speed, but prolonged use will overheat your weapon, allowing the enemy to regroup and kick your metal ass. Picking up the rapid fire recharge icons, stored in boxes which appear at various positions throughout the levels (usually when there are millions of baddies onscreen!) will bring your gun up to full strength, allowing you to blast the bolts off the Endoskeletons and HKs once more. Double the fun and they've both got a great big gun. BACK TO THE FUTURE The battle against Skynet and its ultimate creation, the practically-indestructible T1000, begins in the year 2029, out on the battlefield defending the humans against the onslaught of Endoskeletons and Hunter-Killers. From here, move to the humans' HQ, which has been infiltrated by T-800s like yourself. Defeat these and you're riding shotgun for John Connor, who's being attacked by airborne HKs. Should you keep Connor alive, you are teleported to the year 1994 where you must first destroy the Cyberdyne building the place where Skynet was created and then freeze-dry the T-1000 by covering him with liquid hydrogen. It may look dead, but the T-1000 quickly thaws out, leaving you to knock him into a vat of molten steel before he gets his hands on the ten-year old John. Exciting stuff, eh? You've got to promise not to kill anyone. BODY SHIELD ime travel, eh? Causes all sorts of problems, doesn't it. The Skynet computer, for all its intelligence almost wiped out the entire human race. Now, a cyborg assassin is journeying through the Time Field Generator to get rid of John Connor, the leader of the humans and the man who, unless the course of history is altered, will wipe out Skynet's very existence. To cut a long story short, you're a re-programmed Terminator who's firstly got to destroy Skynet in the 21st Century, before travelling back to 1994 to protect the ten year-old Connor from the T-1000 the liquid metal successor to the Terminator. The coin-op of the film was a cracker but how does the Megadrive version fare? The coin-op was one of the most impressive around less than an year ago and had some of the most stunning visuals ever seen. The Megadrive game replicates those graphics almost to a tee. All the baddies are excellently drawn, move around as well as they do in the real thing, and there are stacks of them onscreen at a time without the game slowing down. All the tunes, effects and samples have been shoe-horned into the cart too, giving even more of a 'real feel to the home version. However, one of the biggest gripes of the game was that it Awas 'just another Op Wolf clone' and had little to woffer apart from the cabinet-mounted gun. But I'm a massive fan of Op Wolf games, as long as they're good and this one most certainly is. Designed specifically for play with the Menacer, you get much op more enjoyment from T2 using the gun. It's even not too bad at all with a joypad either. If this is the shape of games to come for the Menacer then future blasting action will be excellent!

"| CVG EXTRAS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION  TOP GUN T2The Arcade Game is the first commercial cart to make use of the Menacer, Sega's Megadrive light gun. We'll not write a load of bumph about the gun here you can read all about it on page 14 but we will tell you that you can play with either one Menacer, one joypad or, if you're playing with a friend, two Menacers or one gun and one pad. | Adds a randomlychosen power to your inventory T-800 Skynet created these cybernetic organisms to destroy all human life; you are a T-800, reprogrammed by John Connor, to assist the rebels. MINI-GUN Gives you a sixbarrel mini-gun for a short time The Menacer got off to a rather bad start with the very sad six game pack, so it was up to T2 to rescue the gun. And luckily, Sega can breathe a huge sigh of relief. In T2, Arena Entertainment have turned in not only one of the best conversions for ages, but also easily the best Op Wolfstyle game. There have been many previous attempts to recreate the feel of blasting baddies with a pivot-based Uzi, all of which have fallen well and truly by the wayside. The superb graphics of the original have been squeezed into the Megadrive cart with a vengeance. There's only been a slight compromise in the brilliant effects, such as when the T-1000's head splits in two. The T-800s run around the screen letting off hundreds of bullets, at a blistering pace which never lets up. One reason that the coin-op wasn't an instant hit was that it was just too l hard! Well, it's exactly the same here! Although T2 isn't frustrating. ly hard, you'll have many sleepless nights trying to blast the hordes of vicious Terminators.

"  It's been a strange old month, all things considered. People have been blaming video games for everything from violence to burning the morning's toast. And it's been a sad month for football, but we won't go into that. But let's look on the lighter side of things. It's been a great time for tips of all sorts, and I've finally managed to bring together all the amazing tricks you can perform with an Action Replay cart and Streetfighter II, so if you haven't got an Action Replay Id advise you to get one.

"STREETFIGHTER 2 MR HELT On the title screen type STREET CHEAT then when you start the game in the match press the Help key and you will skip the match. To turn it into the Championship Edition select a two player game, pause it and type 7 KIDS and hey presto. Thanks to David Scott from Deptford for that. Oh no! Some top Engine boy has sent me a tip for Irem's cutesy heli blast minus a name ard address! All you Engine fans are finally starting to get your act together with some cheats, but we need more; I mean come on, it's not as if there's a lack of decent software, is it? Press 1,2,1,2 and an option menu will appear. Or press 1,2,1,2 and select and you will get 99 lives. ROBOCOP EPIC Johnathon O'Neill from Cheshire has dug out this crusty old game in order to give all Robo-sads a little help. Pause the game and type (BEST KEPT SECRET) to become invincible. Jonathan O'Neill has sent all the codes for this superb game so, without further ado, I give you Jonny! GUNHED WARNING CHETICLE ALIEN 3 1 Auriga 2 Cepheus 3 Musca 4 Puxis 5 Cetus 6 Formax 7 Caelum 8Corvus A cheat for the finest blaster around makes its way to me all the way from Martin Norman in Maidenhead, Berkshire. To make the game harder, hold down Select on the title screen and turn on autofire I and II until the screen changes to mode select, then press Select and reset the game. If you have done it correctly the Gunhed logo will turn gold. Chris Dow and Stewart Jones from way up in Scotland have got a good cheat for Alien 3. Honest. Go to the configuration screen select two players then go to start when both players' lives are gone go back to the configuration screen and select continue; both players will receive infinite lives. Y'S BOOKI & II Despite the fair sprinkling of Engine cheats this month I've still had to enter a few myself. This is for the CD Rom version of Ys. Enter this code to start with 99,999 experience points and 65,535 gold: *Q2eb/bbbCF/ijhghgh/ghghg/hghghgh/ghghghg yQy/QyQyQyQ/yQyQzPz/PzA. MASTER SYSTEM PC AMIGA PC ENGINE have QUESTIONS Dear Paul, I know this is very sad and by the time you answer this I'll probably have worked it out for myself, but no matter what I do I just cannot place my Papal magnet on Populous. What am I doing wrong? Steve Besall, Dublin, Ireland. Dear Paul, I am stuck in Monkey Island on the PC. The problem is that I cannot get the banana picker. How do I do it? Graham Carr, Birmingham. CORNER Paul: Before you can place your Papal Magnet you must have designated a leader in your tribe. To nominate a leader simply go to the \"Make Leader» icon. Doh! Paul: To get the banana picker you must first have the Wimpy idol. Go to the monkey at the south side of Monkey Island. Give him the five bananas and he will follow you. Then go to the clearing and pull the nose on the statue. The monkey will then copy you as you walk through. Go to the little Wimpy Idol and get it. Go back to the vil lage and give the idol to the villagers. Dear Paul, I am having real trouble beating Big Bad Pete on Quack, shot. Are there any cheats to help me? Paul Beckford, Romford, Essex. L i there and welcome to the all-new Question Corner. There have been a fair few decent questions this month but I'm sure that even more of you are stuck in games. Remember that, unless you say exactly where you're having difficulty, I can't help. So let's have less of this \"Are there any cheats for Sonic 2?\" nonsense. Send your posers to: IF I HAD ANY MORE QUESTIONS I'D BE THAT BAMBER GASCOIGNE CHAP I WOULD, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. Dear Paul, On the Caveman level of PC Kid I can't get past the quicksand. Are there any cheats to make it easier? Michael Pane, Gwynned, South Wales, Paul: Go to the right straight away and shoot the helper on the right of the screen using the Bubblegum/Popcorn, then jump up to the platform in the centre of the screen, shooting the second helper on your way. Let loose with the Plungers whenever you can; hit Pete in the face nine times and he will wave a white flag. When he is dead, go to the bottom of the screen and use the library book. Paul: There are no cheats as such but if you headbutt one of the trees it will walk along the floor allowing you to travel on it. If the tree is walking the wrong way simply nut it again. CVG 075 "

"a HOTSHOTS GS2. AMIGA BY PSYGNOSIS TBA hey just had to come back! Yes, you've guessed it those loony Lemmings are on the warpath again, with a completely new set of adventures to tackle! Lemmings 2 The Tribes is set to be released on an Amiga near you very shortly, with twelve new Lemmings and one hundred new levels. Space Lemmings, Polar Lemmings, Sports Lemmings and Circus Lemmings are just a few of the new batch and the traps and obstacles these little guys must face promise to be the most challenging and fiendish yet. The story goes that the Talisman that's protected Lemming Island all these years has been broken up into twelve pieces, and the little guys have to find all the bits before they can build a vessel and relocate on a new isle. The exploding stoppers have been replaced by groovy heavy metal guitar freaks and any Lemming in earshot is captivated by the sound! There are bombers, blasters, diggers, divers, snake-charmers, bongo-players and a strongman who throws Lemmings about the screen to reach new heights. Sounds great, looks great and, with a little bit of luck, should play great. This one will be reviewed very soon peel those eyelids back! As you can see from the helmets, this is no ordinary American Football game! AHAY TEAM MAN SNES BY KANEKO TBA hester Cheetah promises to be a surprise hit on the SNES. As you can see, the cartoon graphics are pretty impressive and the ton of big, cute characters some of the best ever! Chester lives in the Four Corners Zoo and, like all caged beasts, he wants to escape. However, the crummy keeper, Mean Eugene, has nicked the cool cat's motor, a bright pink motorbike, and hidden the parts around the complex! All you've got to do is find the bits, put the bike back together and escape! Simple, huh? Oh no! There are six levels to go through and not all the animals are on our cat's side, although Chester can enlist some help from his numerous buddies. As we said before, the game is stunning to look at and, of course, there'll be loads of the usual pick-ups and special powers to help our Chester. Tune in next month for the full review! SIXTY WHINERS SEGA HOME TEAM PAD 1 GAME MODE OTR LENGTH STADIUM SEE MORE SINGLE GAME 1:29 HINKY STINK PARK PAGE 2 MUTANT LEAGUE FOOTBALL MEGADRIVE BY EA TBA If you thought that American Football was tough wait until you get a load of Mutant League Football! The game is similar to John Madden's Football, but instead of great hulking humans the teams are made up of bloodthirsty mutant monsters! Take control of such teams as Slay City Brawlers, Terminator Trolls, The Sixty Whiners and Killer Convicts and become such stars as Assassin, Killer, Rott, Hellfire, Rumble and Snake. It all sounds more like a crazy version of the Gladiators, but these muthas really mean it! Even the stadiums which the boys wage war in are suitably diabolical, with venues such as the Cemetery, Butcher Dome and Pentonville Park! Each location has its own obstacles on the pitch, with huge boulders and lava/fire pits etc. In addition, if things aren't going quite your way, you may bribe the ref or even kill him! The whole thing looks a riot, with all the playability of EA's other top American Football sims packed in there, but you'll just have to wait 'til next month for the CVG final verdict! cG 080 "


"CVG US GOLD MEGADRIVE TBA Just one of the many animated cut-scenes in Flashback. oming soon on Megadrive is a game that promises to be one of the most spectacular graphic adventures ever seen on consoles. Flashback, created by the designers of CVG's January cover game, the incredible Another World, is the first twelve-meg cart for the 16-bit Sega and is being hailed as the thebe-all-and-end-all in game and graphic design. We've got our mitts on the latest Beta ROMs to bring you an up-to-the-minute preview, so read on! IT'S ON FLOPPY, TOO! As we mentioned earlier, we've got the latest version of Megadrive Flashback in the office, and to say we're impressed is, something of an understatement! And what's more, it isn't just the console boys who will get the chance to have a crack at saving the world from alien infiltration! Flashback is also coming to Amiga and PC and will even include new features not available on the Megadrive version, the most impressive being the ability to zoom right into the action! POLYGONS AHOY! Haven't the combatants noticed that there's a solid steel door between them? LORDY LORDY! As in Another World, Flashback makes use of polygons to display a wide array of animated cut-scenes. Polygons save massive amounts of memory and, because they use minimal processing power, can run at a fast pace. The scenes in Flashback are heavily influenced by action feature films such as Total Recall and believe us, they look, great when in full flow! Flashback uses a graphic process called Rotoscoping. If you've never heard the term before, it involves the video-taping of live actors performing various movements and turning them into animations in this case, computer graphics. You may have seen the process used in animated feature films; Lord Of The Rings and Disney's Beauty And The Beast were both created by rotoscoping. Conrad grabs the key card. CONRAD POOS AND HIS DANCING TEETH! The story centres on research scientist Conrad B Hart and his latest invention, a device that can analyse the molecular structure of any life form. Using this device, Conrad discovers that a large proportion of high-ranking public figures are, in fact, alien beings in disguise! Aliens being aliens, they're soon onto Conrad and kidnap him, wiping his memory and dumping him on their home planet in the process. Conrad's task is to remember who he is and what he had learnt previous to his abduction, then find a way back to Earth and spill the beans! The hero can even needlessly hurl objects away! "
