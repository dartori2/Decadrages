It is possible to bring U.S. equipment to the U.K., and vice-versa if a transformer/ frequency converter is used. You will need to use a multiple standard TV set/ monitor though.

Only SWITCH TO STATESIDE SORTING OUT Dear Sir, I have recently purchased a BBC model B micro and several commercial games. Some of these games are excellent, Micro Power in particular. However, there are a lot of very boring games advertised that I consider are misrepresented. One Adventure game says \"what next?\" interminably and another \"what shall I do now?\" until you feel like throwing something at the set. There are some very good Adventure games, with humour but a lot are \"user hostile\", especially the \"Ha, Ha you are dead\" type. My chief reason for writing however is the misrepresentation in advertisements as to whether games have graphics and sound. Many imply this but are only word games. They should clearly state that there are no graphics. Even this is no guarantee as I have just returned a taped game to one of your larger advertisers asking for a refund for although the advert clearly states that the game has sound and graphics, but it does not.

The result: a winner of each section and several highly commendeds too. Our Pinball winner was Andrew Muir from Grove Road, Norwich with his game Alcatraz who wins a Bally pinball machine to take home and set up in his living room. Our most imaginative video game designer was 13-year-old lan Boffin of Lych Way, Hansell, Woking, with his shark game Jaws. For lan Bally have put up an extra prize of an Intellivision TV games centre. Congratulations to these two and C&VG will also be finding something for the entries which came second and third in each category too. Full details of the winning entries will appear next month. For those of you still struggling with the Puzzling problems on page 80, the answers are presented here. But please try them first, either in your head or by using a computer program. Noah's problem with the ark of confused animals can be just as confusing for humans. In order of the first half the specimens are: Amoeba, Canary, Ferret, Iguana, Locust, Magpie, Oyster, Parrot, Shrimp, Spider, Turkey and a Weasel. The solution to On the Cards is that Dan took the card with \"Vixen\" written on it and Bob wrote \"Surly\". Turning the digits in our symbol sum into figures gives the following piece of arithmetic: 598 507 8047 9152 And the correct solution to the Cross number problem is printed right: The Blooming Problem has been left in your capable hands until next month, by which time 10 of you should be the proud owners of a Vulcan Electronics Hungarian Ring to puzzle over. Send your entries in by March 12 please. Finally, congratulations to the winners of our Space Attack problem set in January's Puzzling. A Ripper of Ormskirk, Lancs; E Marten of Southall in Middlesex and G Holden of West Ealing, London; have all won a Computer Games' Galaxy Invader 1000. Commiserations to the losers some of whom bounced wrongly or made other illegal moves. The best score was published last month. And thanks for the Gaudy Monster entries. No prizes here but top scorer was Joan Lockett of Shrewsbury with 559. A BUG CONFESSES ALL EMPIRES BECKON If you have already entered our Seventh Empire game, you do not need to reenter we will include you as soon as possible. But if you are new to C&VG and would like to enter fill in the form below and we will send you a rulebook and fleet starting positions for our next issue. Please include me in the Seventh Empire game for April. They should have known better than to try and sneak a book of games past us. We slipped Snag Jnr. in there at the last moment to cause a bit of havoc with Red Alert on the Vic-20. It does not need the 16K of memory suggested in the write up and runs on a normal 3.5K machine. Several people couldn't get their Red Alert plane to fire missiles. A complete rundown on the instructions is: a-spacecraft goes up ; spacecraft goes down P-spacecraft goes left (backwards) -spacecraft goes forwards Pressing shift drops the bombs Shift and the asterisk \"*\"fires horizontal missiles Those of you who called on Fruit Machine were having problems keeping the fruits in their boxes. We tracked this down to line 1. The final statement in this line reads \"SR=36879\". Dodgems for the BBC Model B runs on the 1.0 operating system machine and some of the commands in this program will not run on the 0.1 machine. Texas owners are up in arms about the Pompeii listing which became embroiled in an erupting volcano. A call or letter to the C&VG offices will result in the hidden part of listing being made clear. T. Hitch got to grips with Keith Campbell's Adventure page. The block and line ranges in figure one should have read: Block 1, 10-50; Block 2, 50-100; Block 3, 100-450. Missile Command suffered from a couple of missing semi-colons but first people seemed to track these down: 210 was the offender. Each C4 in this line should be followed by a semi-colon. The editor has asked me to apologise for the lack of a Starweb write-up this month due to a space shortage. Also out went Next Month and the promised version of Donkey Kong for the Vic-20, called Logger. This will appear in April. I would like to name my tribe the My name is: Address: COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPE "

The exclamation mark is Reuben Fine's, but in fact it is a sub-optimal move which extends the astonishing drawing move 2.... N-K2! There must be few masters who would play such a move with confidence. Now Black's Knight is separated from the King and there are mating threats to contend with. However, there is no way for White to exploit these facts. For example, if 3. K-N6, K-NI; 4. KB5ch, K-B2 with a drawn position away from the corner. This example is taken from Advances in Computer Chess 2, published by Edinburgh University Press in 1980, which contains two lengthy articles on the work of the Edinburgh team. Although their work had much more ambitious goals concerning how expert knowledge might be represented and stored in a computer, from a chess viewpoint alone it is quite remarkable. NOVO FIG 3 a b c d e f Computer chess has long been used by workers in the field of Artificial Intelligence as a testbed for human reasoning and how it can be programmed into a computer. A useful spin-off has been a gain in knowledge and understanding of the game itself. Work at the Machine Intelligence Research Unit at Edinburgh University in the last few years has focused on the endgame King and Knight against King and Rook (abbreviated to KRKN). Amongst those studying this ending have been two players of master strength — the Yugoslav player Ivan Bratko and U.S. master Danny Kopec. Unlike most endgames which have been studied by Artificial Intelligence researchers, KRKN is genuinely hard even for masters, although fortunately rare in practical play. Conventional wisdom states that the ending game is in general a fairly straightforward draw, but this turns out not to be true. As the game goes on both sides must take care to spot any possible forks. With the Rook's side (assumed to be white) to move, only a slight majority of legal positions are drawn. However, it is important for Black to stay in the centre of the board, because the won cases occur with the King in the corner. Here is an example of a difficult posig h co -NW A o game a further 6 moves than necessary until White's eventual win is reached. Analysis of this kind shows that the textbook not only occasionally misjudges whether a position is won or drawn but frequently gives a move which is not the best. If this is the case with a four-piece endgame, the infallibility of the rest of the textbook must be open to suspicion, to say the least! The question remains, how is it possible to write with such confidence of the best moves in positions which seem to defy expert analysis? Certainly the answer is not by analysing the game out to a conclusion each time. There are positions where it takes White 27 moves to win (i.e. 27 White moves plus 26 Black moves). Assuming that each player has an average of 10 moves in every position, there would be 10 to the power 53 variations to consider before making the first move. Nevertheless, the KRKN ending is now completely solved for every legal starting position. I shall return to this topic next month. FIG 1 a b c d e f FIG 2 a b c d e f g h Here is another of their examples (Black to move) Most strong players would surely now play 1.... N-KB3 ch to bring the King and Knight together (by N-R4 subsequently). However, Black's only drawing move is the apparently suicidal 1. ... N-QB6ch. Work of this kind calls seriously into question the idea that the endgame is well understood at least by grand masters. Even for this four-piece endgame there are numerous previously unsuspected problems and even such an apparently definitive to me as Reuben Fine's Basic Chess Endings has clearcut errors as well as severe omissions. Figure 3 is an example of the textbook lapsing (Black to move). This position is a variant of one which was first analysed in the ninth century. White can win in 14 moves. Black's first move is effectively forced: 1.... N-R4 ch; with the best play for both sides continuing 2. K-N5, N-N2. Now the textbook gives 3. R-KB 8 an exclamation mark, although R-K R5 is best and wins one move sooner. More seriously, Basic Chess Endings rejects 3. R-KR7 because of 3.... K-NI; 4. K-N6 \"drawn\".

"TVGAMES CENTRES TVGAMES CENTRES TVGAMES ONDEO V SAME GENRE MERE STICK-STAND The Stick-Stand was the cheapest and simplest product we tested. Basically it's a plastic stand into which your standard Atari joystick fits snugly. You also get a little red ball which slips onto the top of the standard stick to improve the grip. Simple but effective. The wide-bottom base provides a good stable support for the stick and that little red ball does improve playability — especially when the on-screen action gets fast and furious. Made by the U.S. firm Byte, the Stick Stand costs .95 Getting the right joystick for your TV games centre is becoming as difficult as choosing the right squash racquet or set of golf clubs. Adverts claim all sorts of things for sticks that they will increase your scores and turn you into a pro-player. We have already reported on the latest batch of souped-up sticks now being imported into this country from the States and this month the C&VG staff sat down at our Atari VCS and played a few games using the sticks purely for research you'll understand! Here we bring you the results of our bench-tests on four of the new sticks plus the novel Wico Trackball and the simple but effective Byte Stick-Stand. Our general impression was that these sticks add a great deal to your game and will prove a valuable addition to your games centre. Most of the sticks we tested were in the   price range less than one of the top of the range VCS cartridges. Pretty good value in our humble opinion. We would like to thank Silica Shop, of Sidcup, Kent, who supplied the sticks we tested, and import them from the States. regular design sticks. We tested it on maze and spacetype games and found it difficult to keep control of the action which, of course is all important in TV games. Le Stick, which costs .95 may come into its own when it's used for computer games but unfortunately our testers just couldn't give it the C&VG seal of approval despite the nice design concept. STAR FIGHTER Suncom's Starfighter is described by its makers as the ultimate joystick. Well, in our opinion, despite the two year warranty that comes with it, the stick fails to come up to this extravagant claim. The Starfighter stick is short, stubby and difficult to get a good grip on you'll soon be suffering from Astro Fighter thumb or some such affliction that all video game players suffer from time to time. The fire button is not one of this stick's best features. It's slow and allows those aliens to escape too easily. As you've probably probably Starfighter is not one of C&VG's favourite sticks.

At  you would have to forgo one or two games which you have had your eyes on for some time in order to pay for it. But in my opinion this would be well worth it. DATABASE If you are the proud owner of an Interton VC4000, Radofin, or Acetronic video games centre then you might not be quite so proud of the ever decreasing range of games available. As these little-known machines have not generated the mass sales of, say the sales of say the Atari, Phillips or Intellivision machines there is not a large enough owner base to support independent software. It also means that the firms who produce the machines do not tend to produce a very wide range of games themselves. The situation has been improved slightly by the production of an adaptor from Voltmace which enables all software for the Database system to be played on any of the above machines. The range of games for the Database is probably about the most up to date of these lesser LE STICK Le Stick from Datasoft is a really nice idea. A joystick without a base seems the easiest way to describe it. It works when the player tilts the stick in the direction he wants to move, and a pressure sensitive \"switch\" inside the stick freezes the action if the player squeezes it gently. As I've said before it's a really nice idea. However in practice — on a video games centre anyway it's just not responsive enough. You really need a lot of practire to get it working as well as one of the little bit more difficult to control. You will have to readjust your Pacman technique accordingly! My one reservation with the trackball was with the fire button. This was particularly heavy and clicked unneccessarily every time you released a missile. It would also have been an improvement to have a fire button in the top right hand corner as well as the top left for left-handed people. WICO STICKS The Wico Command Control range of joy sticks are the best known \"gourmet sticks\" as they are termed in the U.S., where they are currently the number one sellers.

"BY JOHNATHAN YEOMANS RUNS ON A SPECTRUM IN 48K Fancy yourself as a bit of a pool-room hustler? Well, chalk-up your cue and get ready to pot a few balls as your Spectrum sets out to sharpen-up your skills. The computer sets the balls rolling by playing the break for you. Then you have to attempt to pot the balls by inputting the strength and direction of the cue ball. Once this is done you simply press Return and sit back and watch. Will your shot be on target? The computer keeps score throughout the game and tells you how many balls are left. The game puts all the colour and sound facilities of the Spectrum to good use and provides pool players with the ideal way to practice those difficult shots. "

"Diggers' action takes place in a dungeon of many levels. It's a fast test of wills against an alien creature with a pasty tendency to explode. The alien resembles a flaming star and it plays cat and mouse with your man as he tries to entice it into a carefully dug pit and trap it there. Because of the alien's explosive ability, you cannot afford to mess around hiding behind a hole in the vague hope that he will fall in. You have to go out and tempt him to rush at you and then dig your hole swiftly while he's in full flight. Just 30 seconds stand between you and destruction. So the game usually involves some pretty fast ladder climbing. Should you succeed in destroying the first star a second and third... in fact a never-ending supply is available to do battle with Like most of their genre, these aliens' touch is deadly to us mortals. A simplified form of Alien Panic, this game is difficult to master and so, quite addictive.

The idea is to pit your wits against the computer and try to place four of your markers in such a way that they form a line either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. This version contains a sound routine that is poked into memory and converted to machine language. There is no need to protect any memory when you run the game as I have used 16478 onwards which is not used by the interpreter after power up. This saves memory as this location resides within the part of memory that is normally saved by the Basic Interpreter. A point to note is that any short language subroutine can be poked here. If you don't require sound delete lines 1515 through to 1519 then delete all the V=USR() calls. To use this sound routine you must have the Video Genie conversion kit installed or through the external cassette socket by taking the plug which normally fits into the auxiliary socket of the recorder and reconnecting it to an external amplifier.

Below, the snow-clad mountain lies silent. The slopes shimmer in the harsh light of the sun. The obstacle course you must navigate to remain champion is hidden from view by all this deceptive beauty Taking a deep breath you thrust yourself forward, determined to smash all existing records. Snow sings beneath your skis as you bob and weave to miss trees and hidden patches of ice. Eyes ache as they strain to pick out the flags you must pass between. Each obstacle hit or flag missed earns you a penalty of five seconds. Can you do it in the time required to retain the crown? This game written for the 12K Atom includes all the exciting features of the popular arcade game. You can compete with up to sixteen other players. A rundown of all the times is given at the end of each competition. During each individual run, time readout is displayed at the top right of the screen. The only controls used are SHIFT for left turns and REPT for right turns. 54 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"UGO Unconditionally BY ALLAN SCARFF Fig 1 In Go, unlike chess, material gains and Unconditionally Alive losses are relatively unimportant when compared with other strategic matters. Chess reflects the western style of warfare based on direct power and strength. Go is more subtle, resembling guerilla warfare as waged in Vietnam by the Vietcong who used Go in the military training of their officers. While losing a group of stones may Fig 2. be disastrous, in some situations it can be positively beneficial. A good underDead standing of the status of each group on the board (or screen) is a prerequisite for making sound strategic decisions. So in this article we shall explore the basics of life and death. Two or more eyes are alive Consider the black group marked a in figure 1. Even though the outside intersections are occupied by white, white can never play at points Al and Fig 3 A3 (these points are examples of eyes) Status because the rules of Go prohibit more than one move at a time and ban suicide. The group marked b is more typical of a game situation. Although each eye is comprised of several intersections, allowing white to play inside them, the suicide rule will still prevent the capture of the black group. group will live but if white manages to One eye or less is dead play there first, the group is likely to Consider the white group in figure 2.

If black gets to play at A2, the It is slightly more difficult to judge the Indeterminate status of the group marked b. If white plays inside first, can black still make two eyes? The answer is no. In fact this eye shape is known as the \"hatchet five\" and it is well known by most Go players that if white plays at the join of the handle to the axe head, the shape will eventually reduce to one eye. Of course if black plays there first he will be safe. In contrast to the previous two groups, the group marked c, though not yet strictly alive, is almost impossible to kill. Black has two choices as to where to play to form a second eye so he can afford to wait until white has played on one before replying on the other. When an eye is too big Consider figure 5. White has enough space to form a one-eyed group of his own inside the black group. The black group is not therefore unconditionally alive but is quite safe because he would have to ignore no fewer than nine moves in order to lose his group. However, the danger is greater the larger the eye space and the more white stones there are within it. To be absolutely safe the eye space must be a shape that cannot accommodate an opponent group with its own eye. Counting the eyes At least to start with, we need to radically simplify the problem to attempt a practical computer solution. One method can be outlined as follows: Detect the eye spaces bounded by black stones, ignoring white stones. Reject any space which is too big. Reject any space not bounded by a single group of connected stones. Count the eyes associated with each group. Repeat the process for the white stones, ignoring black stones. Decisions decisions! Having determined the status of each groupeven if only approximately a whole universe of decision making is opened up. One simple but large improvement that can be made to our computer program is the suppression of needless moves capturing already dying stones within eyes. But by examining the status of neighbouring groups, quite sophisticated play can be devised. For instance, a policy of attacking large one-eyed or eyeless groups can be implemented. But there is no one golden strategy. The best Go programs balance and select between competing strategies. How such programs manage this is another story for another day!

One of the difficulties to over The \"enable\" pin is, in fact, the In figure 2 I have drawn a brief outline of the chip and to what the pins must be connected. Pins 1 and 14 are obvious. The others may require a little explaining. The data lines, though, interface directly with those on the main board. Working in number order around the chip after the ground pin we come to the second timer lines. Pin 2, the trigger line, or gate line sets counter 2 going as soon as the initialisation is complete. Pin 3, the output line, indicates when the period of timing is over and will drive 2 TTL loads. Pin 4, the clock input for timer 2 defines the rate at which the binary number loaded into the timer is decremented. This clock rate can vary up to the 'enable' clock which would normally be IMHz. For most applications 1kHz would be sufficient and give a maximum count time of about 1 minute.

In this respect it works in a similar way to a periferal interface adapter, PIA. The read/write line works in exactly the same way as it does in the rest of the system. For reference, the state of any of the registers may be read while the counter is in operation. This can be very helpful when setting up the counters for the first time. As I have said before, the enable at pin 17 is the synchronous clock for reading and writing data to and from the counters. It can, of course, be used for the timers' clock if very short periods are required from the counters, If you are using a computer with a two phase clock this can be used directly with the counters. Unfortunately, these days many processors only require a single phase so I will indicate how to derive the correct signal later. or one of the new decimal divider chips almost any frequency can be defined. Pins 5, 6, 7 and, likeways, 26, 27 and 28 I have explained in the last paragraph. The reset line, pin 8, does exactly that. It will, whenever activated, reset the counters to their initial values, which are held in on-chip memory. All that is then required is the triggers and the counters will start off, together, if required. The next pin, pin 9, houses the IRQ line, or interrupt request line. OLD ROUTINE... By setting a flag in one of the control registers (to be discussed later) the system interrupt will be activated as soon as any one of the clocks resets at zero. This will then initialise the microprocessor's interrupt routine which is built into the system. Pins 10, 11 and 12 define, in system memory where the timer resides, along with pins 15 and 16. Pins 15 and 16 are the chip select 1 and 0 respectively. CSO must be at zero and CSI must be at one for the chip to be addressed. These two lines define the block in memory and the three register select lines define the location with COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 67 "

"PLAY AROUND WITH PATTERNS Experimenting with the rules for generating patterns of movement can produce many intriguing displays — and here I aim to set out some of those rules for you to play around with. The pattern of movement of a point in a plane can be described by giving the position of the point at any time in terms of its initial position and the time. If the initial position is given by the co-ordinates (XI, YI), and the current position by (XC, YC) then a typical way of giving the position at any time, T, is XC=XI + T*YI XC=YI Note that the initial position corresponds to T=0, since this value for T gives XC=XI YC=YI That is to say that at T=0 the current position is the same as the initial position The rules just given provide only one example of how the current position can be expressed in terms of the current time and the initial position. Since we can describe the movement of a point in this way we can also deal with the patter of movement of a flat object by examining how the points that are joined by its edges behave. Next month we shall examine how solid, three-dimensional objects behave by applying the same idea to its corner points. Fig 1. The following program produces the initial shape of a square and three of its successive positions using the rules for movement given above. If the way that the time is involved in the equations giving the patterns of movement is periodic, then the resulting pattern of movement will also be periodic. In other words, the shape will return to its original position after a period of time. It will then repeat its previous cycle of movement again. This is illustrated in figure 2, which was produced by using the rules XC=XI + YI SIN(T) YC=YI*COS(T) 10 DIM XI (4), YI (4) 20 FOR I=1 TO 4 30 READ XI (I), YI(I) 40 DATA 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1 50 FOR I=1 TO 4 60 T=0.1*(I-1) 70 XX-XI (1) + T YI(1) 80 YYYI(1) 90 MOVE XX, YY 100 FOR J=2 TO 4 110 X=XI (1)+T*YIC) 120 Y=YICI) 130 DRAW X Y 140 NEXT 150 DRAW XX, YY 160 NEXT I Fig 2 The resulting shapes are shown in figure 1. by barv Marshal "

"MADVENUR BEWARE THE LOST NUMBERS I have already explained how to avoid renumbering your Adventure programs beyond recognition. However, when your game is complete it will be desirable to renumber it, as it will look more professional. Adventures have a particularly high number of GOTO and GOSUB statements. It is almost impossible to prove that all of these point to lines that exist. The chances are that you will have forgotten to write one of them! A side benefit of renumbering the program is that this will identify any Undefined Line errors without the need for exhaustive playing. The utility, when run, will list the lines BY KEITH CAMPBELL that ought to be there but have gone missing Depending upon the Basic your machine runs, renumbering may also save some memory assuming you convert to smaller numbers. This will not be achieved by the line numbers themselves being smaller, since these will always use 2 bytes each, however small. The saving comes when the Basic holds GOTO and GOSUB numbers in ASCII form, thus using 1 byte for each digit. Therefore, the smaller the numbers of the pointers, the less memory will be used. Having decided, then, to renumber your program, when is the best time to do it? This will depend on what renumber facility you have. Some machines, for example the BBC, have the feature built in, as will most disc operating systems. On the other hand, machines like the TRS-80 require that a special program be pre-loaded before the Basic program which is to be renumbered If your machine is this type, you will have to take into account the memory requirement for the utility, and ensure that your ever-growing Adventure is not too big before you renumber it! If it is not quite finished, then perhaps it will be best to renumber in two's to leave space for insertions, otherwise renumber in one's. If you are getting very short on memory, you might find that you can load both programs as long as you don't try to run the Basic program the renumber utility will probably not take up much more room than the space the Adventure requires to run in. Finally, if you have followed my convention for numbering REMarks, delete these before renumbering. Apart from giving you the extra space you might need, the REMarks will have lost their identifying last digit of 9 after renumbering, and will be more difficult to locate.

"only way I can access it is by PEEK and Welcome back to the Wild West where you || experience excitement and adventure on the Warpath! Here we continue to set out the rules for this thrilling conflict between Indians and the Cavaily. Once the Board has been prepared, you will be asked if you wish to review the Map. If you rel Yes», the map will scroll across the screen until you press \"ENTER», Details of the numbers of each type of piece will appear at the top of the screen. The middle of the northern portion of the map will appear (the Troopers always move first) and play commence. The order of Play a) The Troopers and the General move first, The player may move al, some of none of the men b) All conflicts resulting from that movement are resolved c The Indians now repeat steps (a) ad(b) d) These steps continue throughout the game until one of the winning conditions is met. This may occur during either the movement or the combat pha IS promised, we will now discuss two important arrays: PTABLE and TBOARD. Once we have completed these, we can prepare the map and setup the pieces ready for play to start. | PTABLE is at alray of 50 by 3 and is dimensioned in line 780 as PC50,2). It contains information on each man i.e. Index D. The position on the Board Index 1. Type of piece trooper, bowman etc. Index 2. Attack flag: Index 0 will be set to zero when the man is eliminated. If a piece is in a temporary HOLD condition, it is negated. INBOARD is shown in figure 1. It is an array of 39 rows and 34 columinis and isa representation of the map surrounded by a4-byte border | This requires 936 cells\" and, it dimensioned in integer format, would need at least 1872 bytes (more if your computer does not have the DEFINI instruction). This wastes memory since no cell will hold a number greater than 255. Instead. I have reserved an area of 936 bytes starting at location 31669 (see line 1100). Since it is not a dimensioned array the When first initialised the centre is filled with 128's and the border with 99s. Each byte whose equivalent posttion on the map is occupied by a peice is given the value of the index of that piece (ie, from l to 50). Those occupled by the garrison or boulders are given | the value of 60. The border is a useful feature. In the original KRIEGSPIEL, I carried out the calculations necessary to ensure that a piece was not attempting to move off the map, but this added to the time required to make a move. With a border, one need only check if the piece is stepping on to a 99. If the is then the move is illegal. Now we need another algorithm which relates IBOARD to BIGSCREEN Given BL, the location of the piece on IBOARD, it returns ML, the location on BIGSCREEN. This subroutine is in line 320. It also Telligns V3 which is the location of the piece in memory. I think you will be able to see that since IBOARD is 24 columns wide and the first location is at 100.the yariable Q is the row number. If you look at BIGSCREEN, you will see that odd numbered rows are offset by 4; hence the Part three of Ron Potkin's wild west wargame series tells you how to set up the board. Although it is designed for a TRS-80, we hope there is sufficient detail to help you succeed in adding Warpath to your collection.

Read index 0 from PTABLE and obtain the location of that piece on IBOARD. If the location is zero, the piece has been eliminated go to the nex piece  Obtain the type of piece from index 1. get the Collect character from the H table and calculate the number of moves for the piece (variable MV).  Use BL to calculate ML frome line 320. The machine language routine in X$(1) is now used to calculate the rectangle to be selected from BIGSCREEN Display the rectangle and prompt the player for his move. We do this by alternately printing both the character and the number of moves at the position SP so that the piece flickers. Assume the player wants to move the piece and presses a number key. The hex he wants to move to (variable NX) is calculated and a check is made 76 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"MACHINE CODE any subsequent characters may be alphabetic or numeric Thus, START, FINISH, L99, A2B3, are valid labels but ?START, 9L, are invalid. Also, register names, opcode mnemonics and other reserved words are usually not allowed as labels, but even when your assembler allows reserved words to be used as labels it is not good practice to use them. Some 280 assemblers require that a label must be followed by a colon. In this case it may be possible to use a reserved word as a label because the colon permits the assembler to distinguish between For example, ADD: used as a label and ADD used as an opcode mnemonic. To see how we use labels with the branch or relative jump instructions, let us look at simple counting loops in the three assembly languages. DECISION MAKING AND THE MICRO The real power of computers comes from the way they can make decisions and perform different actions according to different values of the input data. We will now start to look at the \"decision making\" instructions in assembly language. In Basic we have instructions of the form \"IF condition THEN GOTO line number\", where the condition may be a complicated expression involving arithmetic, logical and comparison operators. In assembly language, however, the only conditions we can use directly involve the sign, zero, carry and overflow flags. The first type of conditional jump we are going to look at is the Branch or Relative Jump, and the instructions available on the 6502, 6809 and 280 are listed in tables 1, 2 and 3. The only conditional jumps on the 6502 are the eight branch instructions shown in table 1, but the 6809 and 280 have others which we will deal with later. In Basic we have to use line numbers to refer to the program instructions. In assembly language we use labels instead of line numbers. The editing programs in some assemblers use line numbers but this is purely to keep the lines in the right order and it is impossible to refer to the line numbers in the assembly language program The standards for 6502, 6809 and 280 assembly languages specify that labels may be up to six characters long, the first character must be alphabetic, and tion introduces a new addressing mode, relative addressing. The second byte of the object code is a displacement specifying how many bytes to jump: regardless of the absolute address of the instruction the jump will be to the address a specified number of bytes away. The displacement is a signed binary number, with values from 0 to 7F hex (o to 127 decimal) representing a forward jump and values from 80 to FF hex (128 to 255 decimal) representing a backward jump The absolute address, which is the destination of the relative jump, is calculated by taking the absolute address of the byte immediately following the relative jump instruction and adding the displacement, making allowance for the sign. In the examples above, if the first line began at address 1000 hex the second line would begin at 1002 hex, the third line would begin at 1003 hex and the address of the byte following the relative jump instruction would be 1005 hex. The value of FD hex for the displacement, interpreted as a signed number, is equivalent to -3, so the destination address is 1005 + (-3), or 1002. To illustrate a forward relative jump consider the following examples: Label Instruction table 1 Hex Object Code 6502 A2 OA START LOOP CA LDX #10 DEX BNE LOOP 8 . 6809 START LOOP LUA 10 DECA BNE LOOP 280 START LOOP Address Label Instruction 05 20 FD LD B, 10 DEC B JR NZ, LOOP Hex Object Code 90 2E BCC DEST 6502 1050 1052 DEST 1080 6809 1050 1052 24 2E We start by setting a register to the initial value of the count, then decrement the counter register. If the register is not zero we jump back to the decrement instruction labelled LOOP. When the counter register becomes zero, after 10 steps, the program will continue with the next instruction. The branch or relative jump instrucBCC DEST 1080 DEST Z80 30 2E JR NC, DEST 1050 1052 1080 The destination, 1080hex, is calculated by adding the displacement, 2E hex, to the address of the byte following the relative jump instruction, 1052 hex, or conversely the displacement is calculated by subtracting 1052 hex from 1080 hex WITH A HOP, A SKIP AND JUMP! As well as these relative jumps we have absolute jumps, where the destination address is included in the instruction. The 280 instruction set includes conditional absolute jumps, which are shown in table 4. On the 6502 and 6809 relative addressing is used for all conBY TED BALLI 86 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"IMACHINE ICODE Hex 6502 Branch Instructions Table 1 Instruction Meaning Code BRE ditional jumps, and in other addressing modes we have only the unconditional jump, with opcode mnemonic JMP. In assembly language we can write a label or a numeric value for the destination address, for example: 6502 & 6809 JMP $1000 JMP START 280 JP 1000H JP NZ,START The object code format for the unconditional jump instructions is one byte for the opcode followed by two bytes for the operand. The operand appears in the usual format for a two byte operand, with the low byte first and the high byte second on the 6502 and 280, and with the high byte first and the low byte second on the 6809. Thus we would have: BPL label BMI label BVC label BVS label BCC label BCS label BNE label BED label Branch if plus (positive) Branch it minus (negative) Branch if Overflow clear Branch it Overflow set Branch if Carry clear Branch if Carry set Branch if Not equal (Not Zero) Branch if Equal (Zero) FO Hex Code Hex Object Code 6502 4C 00 10 Z80 C3 00 10 5809 BD 10 00 Source Code JMP $1000 JP 1000H JMP $1000 Table 2 6809 Branch Instructions Meaning Instruction Branch always BRA label Branch never BRN label Branch if higher (greater) BHI label Branch if lower or same BLS label Branch if Carry clear BCC label Branch if higher or same BHS label Branch if Carry set BCS label Branch if lower BLO label Branch if Not Equal (Not Zero) BNE label Branch if Equal (Zero) BED label Branch if Overflow clear BVC label Branch if Overflow set BVS label Branch if Plus (positive) BPL label Branch if Minus (negative) BMI label Branch if Greater or Equal BGE label Branch if Less Than Zero BLT label Branch if Greater Than Zero BGT label Branch if Less Than or Equal to Zero 2F BLE label *Note two different opcode mnemonics for the same object code. 2E Hex Code Instruction Table 3 Z80 Relative Jumps Meaning DJNZ label JR label Decrement B & Jump it Not Zero JR NZ, label Jump Relative JR Z, label Jump Relative if Not Zero JR NC, label Jump Relative if Zero JR C, label Jump Relative if No Carry Jump Relative if Carry FLAGS SIGNAL THE MESSAGE Table 4 280 Absolute Jumps Meaning Instruction Hex Code Jump In order to use the conditional jumps we need to know how the other instructions affect the flags. It is not difficult to learn which flags are affected by various classes of instruction, but you will need to look this up in a reference manual at first. In most cases we only need to bother with the sign, zero and carry flags and it is usually quite easy to work out how these flags are affected by most instructions. However, there are complications when signed arithmetic is involved, and next month we will look more losely at the mechanics of signed binary arithmetic, paying special attention to the values of the carry and overflow flags in the various cases that can arise.
