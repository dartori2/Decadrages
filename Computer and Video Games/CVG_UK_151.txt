Which gets me to the biggest issue this industry has ever had to tackle compact disc. Is it going to happen? Of course it is. The hard and software firms have invested far too much cash in the new formats already to pull out just because the games are generally sub-standard, FMV-laden affairs with little to no gaming worth. The task the companies are facing now is how to turn an overhyped storage medium into the ultimate gaming device. The obvious route is that which the likes of Sega and Sony are treading filling their new generation consoles with all manner of graphics and sound gubbins to wow the prospective buyer into parting with the hard-earned. But the two tricky areas which really must be cracked are, Original ideas is what makes a good game, first, the slow and Pete Molyneaux's latest is full of them. access times of compact disc which an increase in on-board RAM could combat and second, the incorporation of fullmotion video images into real gameplay until then, the only use for FMV is for flashy intros which will, sooner rather than later, be found out for the con that they are. It sounds depressing, but bear in mind that it's very early days for CD and companies understand that they've got to come up with software worthy of the -plus price tags. Let's face it, they can't use the \"price of chips' excuse which is so often tripped out to justify outrageous cartridge prices. And hey, once compact disc does start to sell in substantial numbers, then perhaps it'll convince the cartridge companies that they've got to bring their prices down to compete. Happy gaming. RAND OUR REVIEWS POLICY Here at CVG we're totally independent of any hardware manufacturer, so we'll let you know whether a game is available on other formats, whether there are better examples of the game on that system, and much more. Unlike other magazines which just base their scores on the views of one particular person, our ratings are arrived at after lengthy discussion between the CVG team about each individual title's good or bad points, with the overall score being a totally separate mark based on the general quality of the game NOT an average of the other marks. For the sake of those who want to refer to back issues, if we do If a game scores more than 90% we'll award it a soughtafter CVG HIT!

EA This is arguably the game which revolutionised PC entertainment software, setting the standard for titles to come. It's a space-based shoot-'em-up cum simulation which pits you against the dog-like Kilrathi in a bid to save mankind from death by neutering, or something equally horrible. To get around the fact the game features too much sprite scaling and rotation for the Mega Drive to handle, Electronic Arts is including an ASIC custom graphics chip in the cartridge the same one that's in the Mega-CD. This could be one of the most technically impressive Mega Drive games to date. It's due out in autumn and we'll keep you posted on how it's coming along. CLOCKWISER AMIGA RASPUTIN Despite naming the company after a psychic, womanising alcoholic priest with no dress sense, Rasputin seems to have its head screwed on when it comes to software. The firm's next offering is a rather bizarre split-screen puzzle game, which, according to our sister mag The One for Amiga Games, is 'a cross between a Rubik's A We haven't had a decent Cube, Tetris and Simon'. Amiga puzzler for a while, could cloelwiser be the one Yes, we didn't understand to watch? them either. What is guaranteed is that we'll all be a bit wiser when we get our review copy in soon. 901 A Don't give those Wing Commanding Kilrathi an inch, otherwise they'll take a light year, SIMON THE SORCERER CD 32 I ADVENTURESOFT While many of us are still trying to crack the floppy version of Simon, Adventuresoft is about to unleash the CD version on us. It's essentially the same game, but now with the addition of character voices. Simon himself is played by none other than Chris Barrie who, apart from being an allround top geezer, is the star of such smash comedies as the Brittas Empire and Red Dwarf. Every character has their own set of lines from a script which weighed in at a hefty 300 pages OD32 seems to be getting all the or 3.5 Harringay Bonversions at the moment and council trees, or Simon the Soreerer is no exeeption! something. ELF MANIA AMIGA RENEGADE Apart from Team 17's Body Blows, the Amiga is painfully short of decent beat-'em-ups. Renegade's Elf Mania looks like being a game to add to that list. Like most combat games, it's packed with special moves and bizarre characters, but the graphics are what will make the game. The characters are large and very well animated with a good range of moves. Best of all, it doesn't rip off Streetfighter 2! But the proof's in the gameplay, and you'll be able to find out just how good it is by sticking with CVG. A Can the people behind The Chaos Engine bring something new to beat-'emups.

It's set 50 years in the future where the Earth is about to be destroyed and civilisation is doomed.

Well at last it looks like US Gold has come up with the goods in the form of Delta V.

Sentinel Firebird/Spectrum Surprisingly, puzzle games were few and far between in the olden days. So Sentinel came as a breath of fresh air. A completely original concept which would do well on today's machines. risky stuff... Sim City Maxis/PC With Sim City 2000 now with us, let's not forget the original which triggered the whole series. One reason why original games struggle to appear in the mainstream is the reluctance of software houses to invest in potentially risky titles. This is understandable when you consider the large production costs, especially for cartridges in the form of duplication. That said, it can be taken to an extreme. Populous, one of the few British games to make a real impact in the Japanese market, was initially rejected by all the major software houses until EA finally accepted it. It went on to sell 3,000,000 across all formats. It just goes to prove that sometimes it's worth taking a risk in this business rather than depending on the same old stock products. Kung Fu Bug Byte/Spectrum All genres have to start somewhere, and this is where beat-'em-ups began. Kung Fu was hardly the Streetfighter of its time, but it certainly deserves recognition as the first beat-'em-up. "

Many CD games use real actors and expensive locations. And not many producers can afford that... with the new game styles we need to start bringing people in from outside the industry, in the same way we hired Steve Jackson (co-author of the Fighting Fantasy books amongst other things) to write the story for Eden.\" Apart from the graphics, which are the best we've seen in any PC game, it appears Cryo has managed to chisel away most of the problems that have affected the kind of graphicallyintense low-playability output in these kind of games.

"THE PLEASURE PARK PRINCIPLE WORK IN PROGRESS CUE If you're really doing well, your park might be awarded trophies for such things as most attractions, or biggest roller coaster. Get one of these and people will flock to you from miles around. THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF ALL THINGS FUN A When you're bored with your current park, you can sell up and move on to another part of the world. The most challenging country is the US. No doubt 'cos they're such budding capitalists The core of the gameplay is based around how things affect each other. For instance, if your bouncy castle is too springy, the people on the ride are liable to be sick over it. While adding too much caffeine to the coffee at the cafe makes the punters speed around the park, trying out even more rides. This creates a delicate programming balance that can be easily upset by the smallest addition. Deciding it would be rather nice if the people getting on to the bus outside the theme park waited for the passengers to get off, Pete Molyneux added a simple two-line routine. It worked, but it also had the knock-on effect of making the bus take up to six months to complete its journey. There's already a lot of interest in this game. CNN recently used it to demonstrate why the Euro Disney theme park can't succeed and staff at EA (the company releasing the game) and Bullfrog are hooked. It doesn't stop there, though; Theme Park is just the first instalment of Bullfrog's new Designer Series, which will feature a whole ranges of business sims based around a similar engine. By watching the little thought bubbles over the heads of the punters you can find out just what they reckon to your park and, if you feel like it, listen to the recommendations and make a few improvements.

BUT IN WHAT WAY? lite's aim in Powerslide is to try and create a rally sim that's positively stunning, and it aims to achieve this by making the cars handle as realistically as possible, and also to get them to perform driving skills that are unique to this game, like handbrake turns for example. Elite has enlisted the help of the guys who helped to create car simulations for Ford and the technology that aids the firm in its new car development. As a result Powerslide will offer the player a realistic range of cars to rally with and there's also going to be a variety of landscapes to drive through, from forests to glaciers. Like the real event the main game is to be played against the clock, while a two-player mode will offer a split-screen challenge. We can't wait to see the finished game. At the moment, Powerslide offers only the Mini Cooper to race around in. The finished title should have a variety of different motors to carve up the track in. There's a time limit in place so you'll have to keep that speed up as much as you possibly can. A The way your car handles in Powerslide mimics the way a vehicle would in real life. For instance, try to balance on too steep a gradient like this person is here and the car will tip over. Whoever's driving the Cooper must have felt pretty confi. dent about his success he's crossing the finishing line in First gear!

Before Philips' darling hit the streets there was something called Laser Disc, but sadly it flopped in the UK about 12 years ago because of its high price and the public's bewilderment of it. By 1989 though LaserDisc was doing well in Japan and the USA and audio CDs were really starting to take off in the UK. Subsequently an attempt was made to include video clips on CD singles, but only about 20 titles were released. Once again LaserActive died a death in the UK.

And with two licensed optional slot-in cartridges the machine can play Sega Mega-CD's and NEC PC Engine CD's. (The PC Engine is especially popular abroad.) As a video player LaserActive is very good, with a resolution which is typically 60% higher than VHS. Add digital sound and you can see why home cinema lovers lap the system up. And it's well supported by film companies with virtually every film available. Makes the 20 or so CD-i titles seem sad doesn't it? As a games machine though it's a different matter. While the images pulled off CD are lovely, and as good as anything seem on any other CD platform the sprites are particularly poor. They're GOGGLEBOX This 3D rave section is an awesome experience.

Well, for a 32-bit machine you certainly want impressive new games. What you probably don't want is conversions of old games, especially if the conversion turns out to be worse than the original. Is that the case here? Super Wing Commander has stuck to the original's format. You're part of an International Confederation set up to defend Earth from impending alien invasion. Each campaign has its own plot and conclusion and each flight will affect the Confederation's chances of success in different ways. Accompanying you on your missions is your wingman who you communicate with and give orders too. This lets you apply different strategies to your missions. Complete a mission and return to base to see what affect you've had on the plot. It sounds easy eh?

Why is that, Deniz? \"Because I'd be taller than everyone who lives there.\" Yes, we know that's not particularly amus. ing, but we couldn't print Den's gag about wide-screen TVs.

And where better than Nepal? \"Right up a mountain in the Himalayas would suit me; time to recharge my creative batteries and all that.\" Which is fine, but he'd look a bit funny with a shaved head and wearing an orange sheet. Mind you, he can play a mean tambourine. In the Barracks you can save up to eight games, view your weapons or enter the briefing room for a mission. JULIE We didn't actually know this until now, but Julie is a bit of an elefriend. Which would explain why her ideal holiday location would be Sri Lanka. As the Art Ed explains, \"it's supposed to be the Garden of Eden and they look after elephants there.\" Unamusing yet touching, we think you'll agree.

But no! \"It's obvious where I want to go,\" Petrea tells us. \"I want to go home where I can get some real sun, as opposed to this poor excuse for good weather.\" If only her ancestors had that luxury. But they didn't. They were locked in a ship's hold for three months with nothing to eat but their own toes. STEVE You name it, Steve's been there. America, Germany, Turkey, even Egypt. But Steve's ideal holiday destination is slightly closer to home. \"I want to go to Pamplona in Spain,\" says the CVG Managing Ed, Any particular reason? \"I want to see the annual bull-run.\" Sounds inno cent, until you realise that the bull-run entails chasing a bull through the streets then prodding it with big sticks.

"THE FINAL FRONTIER REVIEW CVG SUPER WING 1 COMMANDERT 0202 VERDICT The monitor on your left shows damage to your craft. Some systems will repair themselves over time. Yellow, orange, red and grey signify levels of damage in order of severity. If you're stuck in battle with heavy damage it's best to return to base or eject. When pilots return from missions they like a bottle of adult pop in the recreation room. Get in the habit of talking to them and you'll gain valuable hints for new missions as well as learning new manoeuvres. 3DO The original PC game required over 20 different button combinations as well as a joystick. These have been converted to button and pad combinations, which can be very complicated at times. Considering the 3DO's power this game is realtively poor, withflat-looking sprites and jerky animation. Despite this the gameplay holds its own with good depth, strategy and plenty of missions. But taking it as a whole, a lot more could have, and should have, been done. Wing Commander fans will be disappointed indeed. DENIZ AHMET A There are two exterior views which can be used in real-time. Don't try to play in these perspectives, though, because the graphics jerk around terribly.

A Here's one of the typical guardian characters you can expect to come across on your travels.

However if the thought of that not particularly appealing grey casing turns you off, then try Core Design's latest convert from the Amiga to the CD32.

Armed with a club it's simply a case of jumping through the levels and bashing troublesome baddies and guardians around the bonce with your weapon. Any guesses as to what the enhancements over the original Amiga version are? That's right, a fantastic CD intro and in-game CD music. Not seen that before! In fact enhancement is probably not the right word as these improvements have already been seen in the Mega-CD version that CVG reviewed three issues ago. VERDICT There's some high quality graphical touches throughout the game excellent parallax scrolling as well. CD32 You guessed it, Chuck Rock 2 is another straight port from the original Amiga game plus standard CD intro and music. Being a cartoon (and one Disney would sweat about the intro stands up to repeated viewing which is unusual. Chuck Rock 2 is just what we've come to expect from Core of late, a highly polished product. Thing is, despite the polish the fact that it's just an average platformer is obvious.

While Trolls fling custard pies at enemies in defence, as you progress through the 50 levels you soon realise that the best and sometimes only way to victory is by selecting the right Troll for the right job. Your main weapon is a custard pie which covers opponents ready for you to eat! 33133232 LIELIER VERDICT A You can gather any item for bonus points. ALATUL AALLLLL W LLLLLLLETTE Having painted in the window structures shown here, the screen is flooded with colour and a shower of bonus items are released. You have to quickly gather what you can before the next level. SNES Bright, cheerful and original (to a degree) are the factors which structure this luminous platform game. Trolls is vivid fun and will definitely appeal to the younger player, with addictive exploration and interchangeable Trolls being the key gameplay elements. The game's shortcomings though are that the challenge never changes and the enemies' movements and attacks are all very predictable. For these reasons Trolls may expire its cute appeal early on. DENIZ AHMET ING Colouring the levels so that they're as multicoloured as the trolls is the idea of the game.

"CVG REVIEW THE JAGUAR FINALLY ROARS JAGUAR SHOOT-'EM-UP  OUT NOW ON IMPORT NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE TEMPEST. 2000 ATARI TRAVELS ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE DAWN OF VIDEO GAMING AND RETURNS WITH A REMIXED VERSION OF ONE OF ITS OLD ARCADE CLASSICS AND IT'S A CRACKER... The red enemies are a bit lacking, compared to the others. They're still a nulsance though, chucking out bullets at any opportunity, and on later levels they race toward your ship very quickly, so watch out. ack in the mists of time, when computers were small, black and white and had only one K of memory, you went for your blasting thrills down the arcade, where one of the hot hits at the time was Atari's Tempest. Using nothing but wire-frame graphics to portray the action, Tempest had you controlling a little fighter around the top of a series of vector matrices, blast. ing the enemy ships which came scuttling toward you. The game proved a huge success, but strangely noone bothered to convert it to home machines except the company who produced the Vectrex, the vector graphics-based console which died a death shortly after release. Now it's 1994 and enter stage left, Jeff Minter, the brains behind some of the weirdest games ever (ever seen Attack of The Mutant Camels or Metagalactic Llamas Battle At The Edge Of Time?) with not only a faultless conversion of the coin-op, but also a draggedinto-the-Nineties ultra-swish remix, containing new baddies, power-ups and even more frantic blasting than before and they're both on the same Jaguar cartridge! Bloody hell! 75107 > Vous Here's something a bit different. This bonus level is viewed in first-person perspective 3D, and the object is to fly through the hoops to score points. Miss a hoop and it's back to the main game. Oh dear. The enemy made it to the top of the.matrix and has grabbed your ship, dragging it off into oblivion.

"THE JAGUAR FINALLY ROARS REVIEW CVG These baddies are rather more of a pain. You want to make sure that you shoot them before they get too far up the matrix, because the first blast actually splits them into two red enemies which trundle toward you relentlessly they can also hop between tram-lines. As you might imagine, getting in the way of an enemy bullet results in the destruction of your ship, as is the case here. SECOND OPINION Is this a good reason to buy a Jag? Well, If you're a blast-'em fan it's well worth considering. Tempest 2000 offers the most hectic and addictive 100 levels I've seen for yonks. On later levels there's perhaps more reliance on luck than skill, but Tempest 2000 certainly offers heaps of lastability. I DENIZ AHMET VERDICT ALTERNATIVES AMIGA Stardust Daze/.99 If you're looking for a high level of blasting action on Amiga, then you'd be slightly mad to miss out on this excellent rotational shoot-'em-up. Issue 146: 88% SNES Super Aleste Toho/ There's nowt on SNES resembling the unique gameplay of Tempest, but if it's a non-stop blast fest you crave, the pumping gameplay of Super Aleste should suit you. Issue 128: 92% If the enemy has reached the top of the matrix and you've picked up the appropriate power-up you can enable the jump and leap into space, away from danger, and blast at the baddies without fear of reprisals. Until you land back on the matrix, that is. JAGUAR A blast from the past comes hurtling into the present and like wow! The original version you get on the Tempest cart is enjoyable enough, but you'll be leaving it by the wayside for the incredible Nineties remix, featuring some of the most frenetic shoot-'em-up action ever, although it does get repetitive. Tempest 2000 is easily the best game available for the Jaguar and it's got a mindwarping rave soundtrack so let's hope this is the turning point for Atari's new machine. PAUL RAND A Shoot certain enemy craft and they deposit power-up pods which race toward you and can only be collected if you're on the same tram-line of the matrix as the pod. Some great bonuses are available, such as a deadly particle laser, the ability to jump into space in order to dodge enemy ships, and extra lives.

"CVG REVIEW LOOK, NO HANDS SNES PLATFORM .99 TOUT NOW om PROK NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE THE KEY TO THIS PLATFORMER IS TO TRY AND HOLD ON TO YOUR HEAD, THOUGH YOU CAN'T HOLD ON TO YOUR ARMS, FEET AND LEGS... here's not much of a plot to worry about in Plok. Basically you have to get to the end of each level to raise a flag. There are various superfluous reasons why you have to do this, but hey, this is a platform game, and at the end of the day it's about getting to the end of the level. These are divided into three islands Cotton, Akrillic, Legacy and then the final island the Fleapit. To dispose of the bad guys who obstruct our hero's way, Plok has an inventive method he throws his limbs at them. Unfortunately, he only has four of these; luckily though, they have a boomerang-like ability to reattach themselves. Picking up bonuses will enable Plok to change character, usually giving him a snazzy costume (Cowboy, boxer or Vigilante) and extra firepower to aid you in your quest to the end of yet another platformer. VERDICT Ploky (as he's affectionately known) can retrieve his limbs on this level by returning to this stage and collecting them off the coat hanger by the house. SNES Plok has all the right ingredients for a decent platform game. Cute character, inventive levels where the landscape inspires exploration, surreal scenery; bonus characters that are fairly inventive. But at the end of the day if you've played half-a-dozen other multicoloured platform games there's nothing that really singles this out as the piece de resistance of the genre. But that doesn't mean It's not very playable, and you emit the odd giggle at the pure cuteness of the game's design and the difficulty curve is just right. You could do worse than check this one out. GARY LORD Various targets can be manipulated to help you around the scenery. This isn't one, but I thought I'd tell you anyway. I know this fellow looks like a two-legged frog, but he is in fact a flea. Admittedly in the flea world he's probably regarded as something of a mutant, but in Plok's world he's just a pest, so zap him quickly. The aim is to find your way round various islands trying to retrieve Polk, Pokel or whatever you call him's flags. ALTERNATIVES MEGA DRIVE Sonic 3 Sega/.99 The latest and greatest starring the hedgehog that launc-hed a 1,000 platform clones. Stunning graphics and frenetic gameplay to match.

REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE PLATFORM .99 OUT: SUMMER GAME GEAR ALSO AVAILABLE ISNES VERSION PLANNED MARKOS MAGIC FOOTBALL DOMARK FOLLOWS WHERE OCEAN HAS ALREADY TROD WITH ITS TRY AT A PLATFORMER WITH A BIT OF FOOTY THROWN IN.... Marko can head, volley and overheadkick his magic football, though even with practice certain kicks take a moment to set up a moment which could mean the difference between life and death! and even then the ball doesn't always go where you might expect it to. ait a minute isn't this incredibly similar to Soccer Kid? Well, um, yeah. It's a platformer filled with the usual traps and monsters, and, just as in Soccer Kid, the big deal is that the hero fights off the bad guys by booting his magic football at them. Marko, owner of the magic football, has 12 levels to get through, each one full of spitting green slime pools, mutant morphing policemen, people leaning out of windows with shotguns and lots of other strange things designed to get the player laughing. If any of them start causing trouble, he has to use his footballing skill to send a blistering cross into their box. Slime creeping up from behind can be dealt with by a dazzling overhead kick, and if anything above Marko's head looks dangerous he can employ that well-known soccer trick, 'the header'. Marko can also use his ball as a trampoline to aid him in bouncing up to those hard-to-reach platforms. There's also a small puzzle element in Marko's Magic Football, which amounts to scouring the mazes of platforms and throwing switches which open doors. VERDICT @ee IMIO ee au 20000CECCOESDOREN MEGA DRIVE The whole point of the game is that you defend yourself with this magic football, which is really fiddly to control and keeps getting lost. Sometimes you don't even have to kick the ball just keep the ball at your feet and let the monsters walk into it. The football element, then, is weak, and the platform and puzzle bits are almost as feeble, so Domark's claim that the 'cartoon humour will keep you playing and laughing for months' is sadly groundless. Nice graphics, though PAUL GLANCEY Watch out for floating bonuses. Most are stars which only provide extra points, but if Marko comes across old cans he can boot them off the screen for a Keep Britain Tidy bonus. Humorous bit coming up! Mutant anti-football clowns are only one of the many hazards that our heroic ballmeister has to confront on his travels. 0000200 2 Loeoezoe AEON GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 69 PLAYABILITY 61 VALUE 60 ALTERNATIVES SNES Soccer Kid Ocean/TBA Boy, this is so similar to Marko's Magic Football it's bewildering.

SEPT OUTLET TO THE FIESOZO TU TE BATI olf games always seem to do a roaring trade on computer and Nick Faldo's Championship Golf is no different, having already proved a sizable hit on floppy. It differs from the polygonbased graphics of MicroProse Golf, and instead opts for the more familiar PGA Tour Golf look. The game now plays in 256 colours, as you'd expect for an AGA machine. This looks a treat but there's always a trade-off with these things and now the screens take a tad too long to update. Indeed this slowdown also happens on the menu screens, which means sitting around twiddling your thumbs after you've made your choice. The power bar has also had a revamp in this port over, and now it's not as fiddly to manipulate and is more like the control on PGA Tour Golf.

OK so it does slow down a little but then Golf is not exactly supposed to be played like a high adrenaline shoot-'em-up is it?

The island map lets you enter any village at your discretion, so immediately there's some non-linear gameplay for you to get to grips with. Village shops provide convenient advice and power-ups to help keep you on your way, and ingame there are plenty of readily available aids to keep Joe and Mac going. As with the original game your club can be upgraded with spikes and objects which fly across screen. New abilities include being able to spit food that's found on the plantation, which gives you different powers, so for example a chilli gives you a flame thrower! And even cavemen get sick of walking everywhere so there are numerous modes of transport to use tactically. LOST IN THE TROPICS 0000003 QO0OSO 000200 VERDICT SNES What a worthy improvement over the original this is. Now a much bigger and tougher game, with more variety in its challenges and there always seems to be something new to explore. Avoid rushing through a level and you'll probably find a new path totally missed before. The wacky atmosphere is excellent and there's genuine team play available in two player mode. Joe and Mac 2 is a refreshingly imaginative platformer, but as a sequel it's basically more of the same. DENIZ AHMET It's very difficult to control yourself on ice, you usually end up slipping into the enemy. Jumping is the best way to get across these stages. In Super 2Up mode shown here you can also bash each other so be careful. After you visit the village you can use the map to decide which level you want to play next. In this way you can revisit past stages for extra points and bonuses. 81 When going through streams take mouthfuls of water to spit at enemies. The same can be done with fruit found in vegetation. In the village some shop owners give advice, others sell you power-ups and one will give you an essential rainbow stone. All creatures are there for you to ride. Climb on and you'll get through a level quicker. But get hit once and the creature is lost.

That means superb big sprites, relentless action, challenging enemies, no slowdown and good control allowing for those vital combination attack moves. VERDICT SNES Ninja Warriors offers a broad range of moves not often available in scrolling bashers. There's absolutely no slowdown and it actually feels like a genuine coin-op game, although a two-player option is sadly missed. I found Ninja Warriors immense fun since it avoideds becoming repetitive, like so many similar games don't. Generally, it's just spoilt by infinite continues which means that like me, you'll probably complete it in an evening. Oh, and incidentally, the final boss gets my vote for hardest ever baddie. FISICS TIME: SSSR Bashing enemies constantly without getting hit will charge up your special power energy bar. Once full (as shown above) you can activate a smart bomb. The best method for dealing with bosses is to use your smart bomb, either that or to attack from behind. Also have a go at varying your moves since the bosses will soon learn your tactics. Most of the bosses are quite hard on later levels. The ones with weapons like those below can relieve you of a single life with just four hits. Each ninja has up to nine moves allowing for combination attacks. With this big chap it's best to slide in low and attack upwards to avoid head-on attack.

"SUPER ON SNES, WILL IT BE MEGA ON SEGA? REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE IFOOTBALL GAME .4.99 OUT NOW KICK OFF 3 NAMIGA, PC AND JAGUAR VERSIONS PLANNED SNES VERSION AVAILABLE AFTER A FINE SHOWING ON THE SNES, HOW WILL KICK OFF 3 COPE IN THE TOUGH OLD MEGA DRIVE LEAGUE? he great predecessor to this game was Kick Off 2, one of the first of the decent 16-bit football sims. There's been plenty since, with FIFA Soccer and Sensi Soccer remaining the main competition for Kick Off 3. Kick Off 3 borrows a bit from FIFA but the controls are far more responsive. The goalies are great too. They don't save everything but neither does the ball bounce off them and right into the path of a striker. This leads to some exciting encounters between goalie and striker since the goalie tries to grab the ball before the striker taps it in. This isn't as much fun as FIFA and lacks the control of Sensi but it's more realistic and very playable all the same. If you still rate Kick Off 2 as the best footy game on 16-bit then you'll be very satisfied with this third incarnation. 10 3318 ACTIO0 REPLAY 1 A Score a goal and an instant replay pops up so you can rub your friend's face in it. Like FIFA Soccer the replay can be watched in slow motion to view your player's skill in all its glory and really grind home a good goal. Kick Off 2 was renowned for its options and this sequel isn't short of them either. VERDICT A One option I've not seen in any other football game is the team talk section. Int. Friendly World Cup Anco League Misawa Cup Challenge Practice Password ANCO ANCO A It can lead to some tense moments when the keeper deflects the ball just as a striker hits the six yard area. MEGA DRIVE What a great footy game Kick off 3 is! It's a tad inferior to the SNES version because of the lack of joypad buttons multiple button pressing gets confusing at times. Unlike FIFA International Soccer, though, you're not left wondering, when you go for goal, whether it was you or the Mega Drive that really put the ball in the net. It looks like an 8bit game but Kick Off 3 plays better than almost any other soccer game. RIK SKEWS Ouch! It's a nasty foul that's been deservedly rewarded with a yellow card. The tackles from behind are crunchingly real. All your favourite options are here, so you can avoid the boring 4-4-2 formation. All the world's teams have their correct player names too, unlike a similar looking game we could mention! 00 00 00 agin GRAPHICS 69 SOUND 70 PLAYABILITY 89 VALUE 95 ALTERNATIVES SNES SENSIBLE SOCCER Sony/.99 One of our all-time favourite games is this little bundle of joy.

A FORMULA PLATFORM GAME OR SOMETHING MORE INNOVATIVE? Put three coins in the bubblegum machine... ollowing the recent partnership idea established in games like Ren & Stimpy et al, along comes Bubble and Squeak following in the same vein (or van, band wagon whatever). You control Bubble, bouncing around numerous platform levels. Squeak (a crap dinosaur type) follows around doing his own thing, but helps out whenever he's needed. For instance. being a small chubby sort, Bubble's not the world's best jumper, so Squeak can be positioned to act as a trampoline to enable Bubble to reach otherwise out-of-bounds levels. So what goes on? Well, bubblegum machines are on each level, and when baddies are shot they release coins. Collect three, insert them into the machine and you can use the dispensed gum to reward Squeak when he lets you ride him round the level, enabling you to run faster, jump higher; that sort of thing. A... and Squeak will kindly let you climb on his back to ride him. A You don't have to kill the baddies, a well timed jump should get you past them. VERDICT 00000140 NO RICO A The colourful graphics lead you to believe you're playing a console game... CD32 Call me old fashioned but I'm still one of those people who believe that the Amiga should leave this sort of thing to the consoles. Still, what's on offer here is highly playable. The graphics are a treat, as you'd expect in 256 colours. And the partnership aspect? That's a treat too, and what could so easily have been a button pressing nightmare is smoothly handled and no trouble at all to activate. Mighty fine game methinks and nice price too. RIK SKEWS 001 Ecco A Bubble's an athletic chap, but even so it's a bit of a struggle for him to reach higher platforms. He can jump higher by feeding Squeak with bubblegum and riding on his back. A... but although good fun the gameplay isn't up to either Sonic or Mario.

"VIKING HELL! CVG REVIEW I AMIGA ARCADE ADVENTURE .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED HEIMDALL 2 CORE'S DARKMERE DIDN'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS, SO LET'S SEE HOW THE SECOND INSTALMENT OF ITS VIKING SAGA HOLDS UP... ith Core currently devoting much of its energy to the Mega Drive and Mega-CD, it's nice to see the company can still spare a few months of its valuable time to produce an excellent follow up to what is arguably its best Amiga game. As before, Heimdall 2 is an isometric arcade adventure. In many ways it's very similar to the first version of the game. That's not to say that you're being ripped off, though, because there are more than enough new 'neat' things in this. For starters Heimdall is now accompanied by a valkyrie called Ursha, who's on hand to help him out of any tight spots, which means the programmers have been able to shove in even more hellish problems. Like the first game, Heimdall's out to do away with Loki, a nasty Norse god who unleashes the forces of evil on the world every time he doesn't get served first at his local chippy. Or something. VERDICT Heimdall's graphics are excellent, but you'd have to be really dumb to expect anything less than beazer visuals from Core. V A The puzzles are logical enough, and not too difficult to solve. You'll only really come unstuck if you miss something crucial earlier on in the game. A To give you a break from all that brain work and joy stick jabbing, there are plenty of kick-back and watch cut-scenes to keep you up-to-date on the plot. AMIGA So far this hasn't been a good year for Amiga games bar a couple of exceptions. So it's nice to see something like this come along, even though it is a sequel, just as I was about to pack my Amiga up into its box. There's really not much to fault the game on other than Ursha, the other main character, who proves to be a bit of a spare leg for most of the game. Heimdall 2 may not be pushing back any technical barriers, but it's a solid, excellent-looking adventure worthy of any Amiga owner's attention. MARK PATTERSON ALTERNATIVES LANDSTALKER Mega Drive Sega/.99 For Heimdall-style action on the Mega Drive you cannot beat this. Landstalker is in a league of its own as far as console RPGs are concerned. Not Previously Reviewed Heimdall 2 is set in a larger world than the first game, though it's still set in Scandinavia, which isn't the most interesting place under the sun. 85 GRAPHICS 87 SOUND PLAYABILITY 86 VALUE 87 OVERALL As well as being a bit of a dab hand at belting people with his rather large axe, Heimdall's also pretty hot when it comes to magic. Which is just as well, as so are most of the creatures he faces. ZELDA: LINK'S AWAKENING Game Boy Nintendo/.99 Game Boy RPGs don't get any better. This is so completely huge you'll be playing it for months. Ranks along side Tetris as an essential Game Boy purchase.

It uses a combination of filmed sequences and sprite-based graphics to create one of the best Mega-CD titles to date.

TRIVIAL PURSUIT / CD32 /DOMARK PRICE $29.99 Triv's best played with a few mates and with the boardgame. This computerised version doesn't have the same feel or offer the same level of enjoyment.

Issue 150: 59% RAIDEN / JAGUAR / ATARI PRICE:  /  If this is indicative of 64-bit gaming, we might as well go back to the Spectrum.

Duta Nesula rontier: classical work of programming art or tedious trip through the void? Silly question, eh? But although every reviewer in the world went ape over David Braben's Elite sequel there were the occasional voices of dissent among punters who expected more excitement. As in Elite, you start with a ship and 100 credits with which to build your fortune and reputation. You do this by filling your cargo hold with valuable commodities in one solar system, then taking them somewhere where they're more valuable and selling them. Getting from one place to another can be a troublesome business, and if word gets out that you're carrying a valuable cargo through a system crawling with pirates you can expect a fight. Kill off the bad guys and you earn bounty credits and eventually boost your reputation from \"HARMLESS' to 'ELITE', though in a game galaxy containing 100,000,000,000 star systems, don't expect to do that in less than a couple of months. BEC 1992 21 PM You can't hyperspace through the galaxy if you have no hyperdrive fuel. So you'd better buy some. The dodecahedron space stations were first seen in Elite, but in Frontier orbiting outposts appear in several exotic shapes. If your ship is equipped with atmospheric shielding you can even land on planets. Some systems (such as our own Sol system) have over 10 ports where you can trade and have your ship serviced. Heureus km RE kalti helt ENTELE 0.0 km A Frontier has a more realistic concept of interplanetary travel and Newton's Laws of Motion than Elite had, so if you fire your engines off in one direction you'll keep going that way until you apply thrust in the opposite direction. This can get well out of hand, and it's a good idea to get an autopilot ASAP so you can just click on your destination and let the ship take you there.

"IS TIME ON CD REVIEW CVG ELITEV2 Addig 1254. Sal 9123 mer ...m Reab turlarla LE Dog-fighting is made trickier by the more realistic flight model. In Elite (seen right) it was easy to chase your foes and rip out their soft underbellies, but in Frontier, when two ships are barrelling towards each other at several thousand kilometres per second they tend to zip past each other. Getting the enemy in your sights can take ages. VERDICT STREET SECOND OPINION Frontier's music can be activated during battle, docking or after exiting hyperspace. MUSIC OFF is the best option, though, because it saves you from the parpy classical tunes the sound chip assaults your ears with. Surely it wouldn't have been too much trouble to put more lug-friendly sounds on the CD? The universe map in Frontier allows you to zoom in on any system and take a look at the various planets, moons and artificial satellites. Handy to see which places you can land. How can one man be so wrong about a game? Far from lacking excitement, Frontier is a roller-coaster ride of thrills. Granted, there's trading to be done before you can go out and buy the big guns, but hey, this isn't meant to be a finished-in-a-fortnight platform game it's a universe, and things are done differently to your normal, run-of-the-mill blaster. I'll stick to my guns and proclaim Frontier as one of the real gaming greats. PAUL RAND CD-32 I can't have been the only one who found the trading bits tedious in Elite. And in Frontier there's an even greater emphasis on trading and wading through heaps of options and it takes days before you get any real action. Saying nasty things about Frontier is, of course, tantamount to heresy, but after a couple of weeks of trying to get into it I was left disappointed there's not enough action. I know people who really got into the strategy side of the game, but I prefer excitement to interplanetary finance every time. PAUL GLANCEY Siretto Statim Barletin Board SHIP REQUIRED Payment of 1225 fora stipto malipokage Est Lotan Tas Estom There's a lot more to do in Frontier than there was in the original. You can still trade in a variety of goods legal and otherwise but now you can also taxi people around the star systems, become an intergalactic courier transporting packages from planet to planet and if you're really well kitted out you can join one of the two galactic governments and kill for cash!

See, this is one of those Golden Axe-type games set in a themed medieval world inhabited by axe-welding skeletons, vultures and other Gothic horrors you'd expect to battle with in such a cart. You can play one of five characters, each of whom offers different weapons, some of which are better at short range and others from a distance. During play you don't collect weapons, rather just improve their power by gathering tokens. With no additional weapons the alternative is to blast crystals released from chests which work like smart bombs. The rest of the game is pretty standard fare: It's a sideways-scrolling slasher, and there's a ridicu, lous number of bosses to battle with. Defeat these guys and you get even more weaponry and big points. I VERDICT A This lad's not the biggest of the five, but he'll see you right in a tight corner. Nice sword, too. A As with all sidescrolling beat-'em-ups the best way to attack is by moving in on an opponent diagonally SNES King of the Dragons is a huge game with lots of shortish levels and tons of impressive bosses, more than I've ever seen in one game in fact. Two player mode is excellent fun, and with five different characters you can mix and match weapon abilities. The gameplay also appears to adjust itself if you're playing with a friend to ensure a good difficulty standard. Unfortunately, there's also some major slowdown in two-up mode which makes attack timing very difficult and that's not good in a fighting game. Still, enjoyable stuff if unoriginal. DENIZ AHMET Smashing pots and chests releases good and bad tokens some of these are upgrades for your weapon while others, like this one here, freeze you which wastes valuable time! CREDIT BO Your special weapon summons flames from the ground but takes away some of your energy. It's the best thing to use on the bosses though, even if it means wasting a life.

IF YOU LIKE TO MOVE IT AND MASH IT UP YOU COULD EVEN JOIN THEM... SPECIAL MOVES 'R' US rom coin-op to console to sequel, that's the way it goes these days. Admittedly, Sonic Blastman 2 is offering more of the same scrolling beat-'em-up fun as before, but there are now two extra super heroes for selection and a simultaneous player option. What the aforementioned has alleviated though, is the sort of problems which usually mess up this type of game. For example, when you die and your second life drops on screen all enemies temporarily fall over giving you a chance to get clear of danger. Also, should you decide to hang around at the edge of the screen smashing baddies beyond view, you'll find they take flight, unavoidably pounding you back to the centre of the screen. There aren't any weapons to find unfortunately, but you really don't need them because Sonic Blastman 2 has more moves than any other scrolling beat-'em-up to date. Reason enough to buy? Read on and see. As well as stacks of standard moves, each character has the customary special powers which, as you can see here, are quite impressive and in yer face. ICE G rushe SCART 0 STANT It's the most devastating of them all. Fills the entire screen with flames trashing anything nasty instantly Want to fry an egg? This will fill the screen with waves of electricity. Great if you're trapped in a corner. Blastman punches the ground, bouncing everyone off the screen.

The graphics and sound are wondrous (much better than their PC counterparts, in fact). As usual, though, the gameplay in this type of game has been reduced to its most basic.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR FIFA? WE TAKE EXTRA TIME TO DECIDE... A Sports has a solid reputation for delivering the goods when it comes to the Mega Drive, but the firm's SNES conversions have seldom matched the quality of the Sega games. NHL Hockey '94 certainly changed all that with an 'as good as' version, and now the SNES is blessed with not only the best sports game on the label but an improved version of the sell-out Mega Drive FIFA International Soccer game. The 3D perspective of FIFA is the most obvious pull in this game being the ultimate compromise between other vertical and horizontal football simulations. Around the pitch you get real crowds too, not just colour blobs, and the supporters behind goals even get out of their seats to cheer when you score. So what about those moves, eh? Well, there's plenty to please aficionados of our fine sport, with turning volleys, bicycle kicks and slides, each achieved with relatively little effort. A unique power meter even gives you precision control over your passes. But, is it better than Kick Off 3? If you try to steal the ball too often, then the odds are that you'll receive a yellow card. Your opponents get them too, so all's fair in love, war and FIFA Soccer. The good thing about FIFA is that the screen scrolls fast enough to keep the ball central to the screen for most of the time.

"HOME AND AWAY REVIEW CVG BA Once the goalie has the ball he can throw it or kick it out like the real thing. As he does all the players run up the field too so be careful if throwing. A If the ball's in the air you can catch it on your chest and move straight into a volley. OTHER VERSIONS A Going for a header can be a dangerous business. If you miss you don't half look stupid! MEGA DRIVE The Mega Drive looks identical at first glance, but lacks the power meter, reverse angle and slow motion instant replay, Man of the Match award, and has 30 less crowd chants. Even so, FIFA is the best football game you can get for the 16bit Sega. I Issue 145: 92% A header is the best way to safely gain control of a fast ball. It also tends to confuse the opponents. SECOND OPINION EASPORT I VERDICT Thanks to the power meter it's now much easier to kick corner shots in the direction of specific players. With a little practice you'll get them to land right in front of the goal for a nice header FIFA Soccer's graphics are something else. If anything, they're slightly better on the SNES, and the addition of the passing power bar adds to the gameplay. Despite the huge amount of soccer games available, I think it's a two-horse race for number one slot between FIFA and Kick Off 3. If it's a truly comprehensive footy game you want, then Ko3 is the one to go for if, on the other hand, you want to pick up and play, and you're a glutton for graphics, FIFA's yer cart. PAUL RAND There's no ref on the pitch with you, but that doesn't mean you can get away with fouls like this! Carry on playing because sometimes the fouls aren't noticed. MORE INTERESTING THAN THE WIFE FIFA's pop-up menu gives you access to all those lovely options which make playing football so much fun. Strategy is just as important as skill, you know. Here's what you get... SNES Even though Kick Off 3 is a more comprehensive game of footy than FIFA, I have to admit that I've been playing FIFA more. I've thought hard as to why, and I guess it's purely because of the viewpoint: Everything just looks so realistic and the action is easy to follow. FIFA offers the atmosphere of the sport through sound and graphics whereas Kick Off 3 gives you the on-pitch realism. If there was more control over the players in FIFA, this would have been the clear choice. DENIZ AHMET TEAM FORMATION COUERAGE In FIFA it's possible to perform a sequence of volleys if you get your timing right. In this way you can get down the pitch quickly. COMING SOON 1. You can access your formations at any time in the game. For beginners we suggest going for a balanced 4-4-2 or 5-3-2 formation. 2. FIFA has quite an original way of sorting out your pitch coverage. You simply slide the relevant arrows, shading in the area you'd like to cover. 3. Here you sort out the strategy for your team. You can set up for attack, defence, or long ball types of play, among others.

Headers are more effective here than in normal footy games because these are robots playing and their heads are on the tough side. ou had an open goal but you still didn't score. You could have kicked yourself, but you didn't bother because you would've probably missed. In Megaman Soccer missing the goal, dirty tackles or stealing the ball is all part of the game. This isn't an ordinary football game, you see. The fate of the world depends on beating the 12 robot teams on their own home grounds. Subsequently you get 12 pitches and these all affect the play differently. It's not all fair play either; each of the robot teams has a special attack, which generally refers to blasting the ball at lightning speeds and smashing your opponents to pieces. Ardent footy fans will notice that the manoeuvres are limited as all you get to do are simple headers, slides, jumps and shoulder checks, and yep, the ball sticks to your foot. However, despite its omissions Megaman Soccer offers an 'arcade' twist to the genre. VERDICT If an opponent is going in for the tackle it is actually possible to jump out of the way. SNES Software publishers take sports games too seriously, so this comes as a welcome change it should even appeal to those who don't like sports games. There's plenty of variety and tons of player combinations. Problem is, the sprites are so big that it's difficult to plan passes, and the radar doesn't work very well. It's all a bit on the slow side too, compared to stuff like Sensible Soccer and Kick Off 3. A worthwhile change from the norm, though. DENIZ AHMET Each character has a special attack move.

Now of course the CD32's where it's at, and so we have Ultimate Body Blows a combination of the both the previous games with a few tricks of its own.

And yes we've got the CD music (Allister Brimble does the business again) but we've also got nine new backgrounds plus three of the old ones painted up into 256 colours. There are nine new backgrounds in the game but even the old ones have had a serious revamp. VERDICT Each time a special move is accessed a bar under the character's power gauge increases. Which means it takes longer and longer to pull off a special move. CD32 Now this is what I want to see: developers spending time over CD32 releases. Sure the graphics and sound have been tarted up but that's in the actual game itself, not in some pointless intro sequence. The game's faults have been ironed out too, notably the speed.

IF CHEAP THRILLS ARE WHAT YOU'RE AFTER THIS COULD BE A SOUND CHOICE. hen it comes to racing simulations you just can't beat the PC. The speed and smoothness of games like 4D Driving, Grand Prix and Indycar are way ahead of any other computer or console offerings. It has to be said though that the PC takes its software a bit too seriously and too many options tend to put people off. It's a bit different for F1 though, because here is a simple race game which isn't bothered with things like tyre compound and pressure. The focus here is on giving you speed, and that's why the graphics are on the bland side. Aha. There are 12 circuits to race on and those many opponent drivers increase their aggressiveness in accordence with your difficulty setting so get used to two cars working together to block of the road. And should you chicken out against the computer, there's always the split screen two player game to go for. VERDICT A The road is sometimes very narrow, so you can force cars behind you. MERE The pits are on the right. You can pull in and make some adjustments to your car's tyres, wings and stuff like that. The best time to overtake is on the starting grid. Drive straight down the middle. A The controls in Flare hyper sensitive, so it's you're continually crashing. PC The best thing about F1 is the speed and it's very smooth. What's missing from this conversion though, is your wheels flying off when you crash, which was excellent on the Amiga version.

BUT THEN THIS ISN'T EXACTLY A \"NICE' GAME... VERDICT his first-person perspective shoot-'em-up makes you realise one thing very quickly about the 3DO, and that's that the joypad doesn't register diagonal moves, not unless you press very hard that is. Which poses something of a problem since the core of the gameplay in Sewer Shark depends on you having very quick reflexes. The idea, you see, is to guide your craft through twisting sewage tunnels, at the same time shooting the nasty bats, rats and so forth which inhabit them. Imagine, then, having to circumnavigate the screen with a rather unresponsive joypad at an enemy in the corner of the screen. And considering the rate at which the action scrolls past you, you've got no chance if you're on the opposite side of the screen at the time.

He's a bit on the unreliable side though, particularly near the end of a stage. 3DO Like Mad Dog, Sewer Shark is almost impossible to play because you can't move diagonally without pressing really hard. The action is also repetitive and the quality of graphics isn't much better than the Mega CD version. I'm also annoyed with the slack time the game needs to register your turns down the tunnels: you have to press your direction at least a second before actually meeting the turn so death usually isn't your fault. These sort of simple shoot-'em-ups (including Microcosm) shouldn't be encouraged because they're lazy programming made interesting through snazzy graphics. DENIZ AHMET Oops! If there's one realistic thing about this game it's that you only get one life. There are no continuation points either, bummer or what?

"DEFINITELY MORE FURRY THAN FURY CVG REVIEW CD32 PLATFORM PUZZLER .99 OUT NOW AMIGA VERSION ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED FURY OF THE FURRIES THE LEMMINGS WANNABES ARE BACK ON A SHINY CD, AND LOOKING AS GOOD AS EVER... e all know French games are weird, right? Thankfully they're often brilliant too; think of the classic North and South Wargame for instance. Fury of the Furries is also good stuff. It's a puzzle game with the look of the classic Lemmings, though it plays more like Interplay's The Lost Vikings. There are four er... furry Tinies who each have a different skill. Red's first up and he likes to chomp his way through things. Yellow can shoot a bullet while Blue can swim underwater. And then there's Green, who is everyone's favourite, he uses a rope to propel himself around. Unlike most rope swinging characters though, he can fire his rope while in mid air which means that he can complete a level without even touching the ground! Like Paul and Rik, Red likes to chomp his way through things. Useful for getting out of seemingly dead ends. VERDICT KKKK AX22:22 2004 1621 Pick up the coins to rack up that all-important score. Look out for secret areas too. CD32 It's good to see that Mindscape has actually spent a bit of time tweaking Fury. Of course there's the obligatory CD music but there's also some decent between-game screens, like when you run out of time. Another change is that you can morph the Tinies into the different colours simply by pressing the correct colour on the joypad, no more of that joystick waggling. This runs at the same speed as it does on the A1200 and overall is an excellent puzzler as it is on its sister machine. RIK SKEWS aid HER LO29CI Yellow can fire a blob.

"CVG REVIEW MUCH FMV. NO VEM DRAGON'S LAIR IPC CD-ROM ARCADE .99 OUT NOW MEGA-CD VERSION AVAILABLE ICD-I AND 3DO VERSIONS PLANNED IS THIS REALLY THE GAMING EXPERIENCE OF THE NINTIES? ELITE THINKS SO. CVG, FRANKLY, DOESN'T... It doesn't matter if Singe is the hardest dragon around. Dirk wants his sword and by God, he's going to get it. Unless you push the wrong button and ack in the early Eighties, laser disc games made their mark on the world of arcade gaming, from the 'real life' airborne bombing raids of Mach 3 to the wizards and warriors cartoon gaming of Dragon's Lair. It's the Sullivan-Bluth game starring dim-witted Dirk the Daring which made the headlines, which was surprising to say the least because, once you stripped away the unquestionably awesome visuals you were left with a very limited reaction test game. Still, that didn't stop software houses snapping up the rights for home versions of Dragon's Lair in 1989 Entertainment International redrew the cartoon graphics and came up with a passable conversion of the game. But now it's 1994, and in these days of full-motion video and compact disc it's possible to transfer the original laser disc to CD and play an arcade-perfect version of the game on your PC. Which is exactly what Elite is offering with its CDROM title. How does the game fare in these days of complex gameplay? Check out the verdict and see... VERDICT Push down at the correct moments to duck underneath those rotating things, which are poised to knock your block off. When Dirk loses a life, he gets transformed into a skeleton and crumbles to the floor. Very taste ful, eh, reader? PC CD-ROM Yes, we know Dragon's Lair has some of the best graphics and sound ever. The trouble is, the gameplay is basic, reaction-test form. Dragon's Lair shows the limits of FMV when linked to gameplay le there's little of the latter. And until that state of affairs is rectified, the only use for games such as this is as in-store demos to show off the machines' graphics capabilities. This is a very shallow title that doesn't warrant purchase if it's a real game you're after. PAUL RAND Thought you'd got away with nicking his sword earlier, eh? No chance now Singe is REALLY riled. There's no way Dirk can keep the door shut, with the force of all that wind.

X ootball crazy, football mad. There's nothing like the World Cup to get the software companies on to the proverbial bandwagon, and here comes Elite with a jazzed up version of its original Striker. So what enhancements are there to the original SNES game engine? Well now you've got lovely-bubbly battery backup and multi-tap compatibility for up to four-player action. There's a choice of referees (from 'downright blind' to 'doesn't miss a trick') along with enhanced player animation and improved graphics, plus the computer teams have been made more competitive and now there are 32 different set piece formations. The new Game Boy version includes most of its larger brother's features (like an edit squad facility and each team having variable attributes), but instead of battery backup there's a password facility. (GAME BOY) As in most football games these days there's a variety of weather conditions to choose from, although the Game Boy's small screen doesn't allow for much weather detail in the actual game. SL BET GAME BOY BAGI Elite A (SNES) There's a choice of three refs from blind to someone stricter than my old schoolmistress!

Apart from that World Cup Striker is a highly realistic game. England were included since Elite doesn't think you lot will buy it otherwise!

"250.000 SALES AND RISING FOR ELITE REVIEW CVG SNES OPTIONS POOR BEEPER SNES It's not really a good idea to pick the poor keeper option. Although you can score a lot of goals it can be frustrating to watch them go in your goal simply because you made one defensive mistake. RAGE GAME BOY VERDICT It's really easy (and great fun!) to commit a foul. Watch the player writhe around in agony! This penalty sequence is more impressive on the SNES since the control is better. Overall though, the Game Boy game is superior. GAME BOY VERDICT SNES I really enjoyed the first Striker game on the SNES and I like this one almost as much. It's certainly quick enough, but I'm afraid it lacks the finer points of games such as Kick Off 3 and Sensible Soccer, especially when it comes to controlling the ball. The graphics don't seem that much of an improvement over the original Striker either, although the sound's been upgraded massively. Good fun, but it stands in the shadow of these other games. Still, I've managed to beat Rik at it, so it can't be all that bad now can it! MARK PATTERSON SNES Get ready to watch the ball fly all over the shop if you select the roaring gale option! GAME BOY I never thought I'd see the day that a decent footy game came out on the Nintendo handheld, but Elite has managed to prove me wrong. This is just such a fun game with so much to offer. The scrolling's so smooth you'll think you're playing the SNES version on a blackand-white telly! Combine this with a wealth of options, password backup and wonderful flowing gameplay (with a brilliantly tense penalty sequence) and you've got a classic cart to grab hold of pronto.

RIPTC LIME FH LAE 4 28 here's obviously a lot of realism to be lost when converting a coin-op (which uses a real bike) to a hand-held console. It's been done before on more or less every other format, but surprisingly enough not on the Game Gear. For a first effort then, this has succeeded admirably. There are three bikes available in GP Rider and each has its pros and cons. Of more interest is the number of tracks, of which there are 15 to choose from an international circuit. Like many other racing games, the object is to finish each lap within a time allocation, passing check points to receive vital extra seconds. Apart from that there's not a lot more to GP Rider. Winning is all that counts. 3.DINO VERDICT POME The time limits for laps are very tight so you really can't afford to crash yet, thanks to strategically placed roadside objects, it's difficult not to. 09 CDB As soon as you see warning arrows for approaching bends, start turning. If you wait until you see the bend it'll be too late. SBEE) GAME GEAR Because it's difficult to see the horizon in handheld racers they all have the same problem: road bends appear out of nowhere. As a result, you crash so often in this game that it quickly becomes frustrating, and some dodgy sprite detection doesn't help matters either. That aside, GP Rider is one nippy racer, and those graphics are silky-smooth with a bike which handles realistically. GP Rider is fair for what it is, but is likely to get dull quickly. DENIZAHMEI Overtaking isn't the easiest task to achieve and, just like the real thing, you shouldn't attempt it on bends, otherwise you could find yourself skidding along on your buns.. There are three different bikes to select from for each race. Funny thing is, it doesn't seem to make any difference to your performance.

There's too much messing around on the map and it's too easy to accidentally enter a level you've already completed and be forced to do it all again. Thankfully, many sub-games provide plenty of variety and there's some interesting Mode 7 bits and pieces.

NOW_THROUGH THE MYST COMES A STUNNER M many cluesnt. The any adventure games spoil themselves by giving away too much of the plot and too many clues in the instructions. Myst is some thing quite different. The story only emerges as you explore and you can't do that until you've solved a few initial tasks. The underlying aim is to discover the Myst Books and in doing so you will be cast among four sub-worlds from Myst island. The inventiveness of the puzzles en-route will require extreme lateral thinking, and unlike many frustrating adventure games there is no reliance on red-herrings to give the game its difficulty. What you see is there for a deeper reason and this gives the game a true sense of navigation. Myst is not for the beginner. VERDICT The graphics in Myst don't scroll, but the quality of them makes up for that. Take note of sounds for clues of puzzles near by. All the puzzles are in sequence, but they are fiendishly complex and there are very little clues to help you out. Click everywhere. You start on the sunken ship and if you solve the puzzles the ship will rise for hidden clue books. PC-CD ROM FOR WINDOWS Clearly the best Windows game ever. The rendered graphics and music create an absorbing atmosphere, and the quality of puzzles is extremely high, and most require a number of sub-tasks to be completed first. The point-and-click interface works a treat and the only disappointing thing (but understandable for a Windows game is that the action is flip-screen and not scrolling.

This one forsakes chainsaws and hi-tech weaponry for a more traditional swords and sorcery format. The first thing you notice is the amount of power this game needs to run properly.

Issue 149: 86% SECOND OPINION PC Doom is already my game of the year, but this could well be a contender for the best RPG. It's massive and doesn't constrain you to completing one task at a time, which is good for people like me who have the attention span of a stunningly dim gerbil. The action side of the game is a little weak, but this is compensated for by the ridiculous amount of gore it contains. One of the better RPGs we'll see this year and well worth picking up if your machine can handle it. MARK PATTERSON Having seen loads of RPGs, it takes something pretty impressive to keep me playing.

"IT'S A BARG' PUBLIC DOMAIN CVG CHEAPOS YOU'RE SAORI JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SHORT OF CASH DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO WITHOUT, SINCE THERE ARE PLENTY OF GAMES AVAILABLE AT BUDGET PRICES... PDGAMES VERY CHEAP, BUT VERY PLAYABLE ARE PD GAMES... JAGUAR XJ220 / AMIGA / CORKERS PRICE: .99 Similar to the Lotus games is Jaguar which, when you look at it, is pretty similar in many respects. Still, it only costs a tenner, and you can't argue with that. One of the best budget driving games you can get your hands on. 80% INTRUDER ALERT / AMIGA Available from: Anglia PD, 0394 284494. Disk No: Arcade Pack Disk 3. Close your eyes, sit back and transport yourself to the arcade of yesteryear where you find the excellent coin-op Cybertron Mission. Well this is an updated version of that classic escape-the-monsters-or-get-fried maze game. 89% SIM CITY CLASSIC / PC / HIT SQUAD PRICE: .99 While Sim City 2000 is much better than this, you shouldn't overlook the grandad of the Sim series. If city-building sounds like your type of thing, this is a real budget bargain. 88% WAYNE'S WORLD PONG / AMIGA Available from: 17-Bit, 0924 366982. Disk No: 2989 Plenty of old games resurface in the Public Domain, but none older than this. It's a version of the first video game, Pong. It's identical apart from the sound effects, which have been replaced with samples from Wayne's World, Strange, but very good. 81% PREMIER / AMIGA / CORKERS PRICE: .99 This little-known game appeared from Core just over a year ago now. While it's really nothing more than a fairly average platform game, the animation is utterly stunning. It couldn't justify the full-price tag, but on budget It's well worth considering. 74% JIMMY WHITE'S SNOOKER / PC / HIT SQUAD PRICE: .99 Programmed by Archer Maclean, this is definitely the best snooker game to appear on computer. It runs fast, even on slow machines and even has a trick shot feature for you to be extra flash with. 90% BLIZZARD / AMIGA Available from: Anglia PD, 0394 284494. Disk No: Arcade Pack Disk 4 We may have had Uridium 2, but if the original was more your thing, check this out instead. Blizzard is exactly that -a version of Andrew Braybrook's C64 classic. Technically it's not very impressive, but what it does contain is some of the most rock-solid action you'll find in the public domain. 82% THUNDERHAWK / AMIGA / CORKERS PRICE: .99 Don't expect the Mega-CD version, this is the Amiga original. It's fast, fluid and very easy to play, making a nice change from the usual complex flight-sims. Well worth the price and easily the budget release of the month. 91% DOSTRACE / AMIGA Available from: Scribble PD, Hillside Cottages, Burstall, Suffolk, IP8 3DY. Disk No: V284. Here's a handy gadget for all hard disk-owning Amiga gamers. Occasionally, when a game doesn't come with an installer, it doesn't copy to the hard drive properly, the cause of which is usually the Amiga deciding to hide some files. If that happens, this utility will track them down for you, thus increasing the number of games you can install. 75% EVEN AT BARGAIN PRICES THIS GAME'S STILL NOT WORTH THE PRICE OF A FLOPPY DISK... MIG-29 / PC / HIT SQUAD PRICE: .99 Just because something's cheap, doesn't mean it's good. MiG-29, for instance is an amazingly dated flight-sim which really sucks when compared to the likes of TFX and Strike Commander. Even at this price, it doesn't offer any incentive to buy. 46% DEPTH CHARGE / AMIGA Available from: 17-Bit, 0924 366982. Disk no: 2945 Not all retro games are worthwhile. Here your battle ship glides across the screen allowing you to drop depth charges on the subs below. Rivetting, we don't think. 47% 93 "


"IT'S NOT UTOPIA 2, HONEST! REVIEW CVG AMIGA STRATEGY GAME .99 OUT NOW LNO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED K240 IF YOU'RE AFTER A GAME THAT CARRIES MORE WEIGHT THAN A GREEDY SUMO WRESTLER THEN THIS STRATEGY GAME COULD BE FOR YOU.. A K240 features an intro that's not at all run of the mill. It's very dark and intense. t's five years since the 'god sim' was first created by Bullfrog. The game in question is Populous, and this was followed up 18 months later by Powermonger, a much more complex game, but with similarly excellent gameplay. A number of challengers have since tried to steal the crown from Bullfrog with their own attempts at the genre. One of the most notable was Utopia from Gremlin; now the company has returned two years later with a sequel of sorts. The game's set in outer space, sector K240 to be precise, and the aim this time round is to colonise asteroids, mine them for all they're worth and make wads of cash! To make the game more realistic, Gremlin has thrown in a whole host of problems to make your task difficult; like nasty alien critters that are also after the spoils, plus you've got to keep check of dullard things like colony finances. PAFW Ah, after all that hard work I've now got a fully functioning asteroid complete with everything to keep my populace happy (as well as alive)! A Using the map mode makes a number of things easier (especially building) since it allows everything to be seen on a smaller scale. VERDICT AMIGA Phew, weighty stuff indeed! I bet you've never seen a manual as big, and with text as small as that in K240. It's well worth reading, though, because not only is it a highly enjoyable read, but it's the only way you'll get to know all the subtleties this game has to offer. And boy is it an excellent game, plus it has exceptional depth! Set aside plenty of your life for this one and like me you'll discover the best strategy game since Dune 2. RIK SKEWS Sadly colonising the asteroids isn't going to be easy thanks to the multitude of aliens who have their eyes on the potential profits to be made too.

BUT IT'S A DIET OF BIG GUNS WE'RE ON IN RENEGADE'S LATEST... ased loosely on the twominute 'steam-punk' fad which spun off from various Cyberpunk novels, Chaos Engine combines guns, aliens and hi-tech gadgets with a Victorian Gothic revival which sets out to create a bizarre shoot-'em-up and a pretentious intro to a review. You're probably wondering what the improvements are for the CD version, well, to tell you the truth, so was I. There are hardly any, in fact. You get a nice soundtrack, and a bit more to the levels, but when you've got a machine still waiting for a massive software injection, something of this quality, regardless of enhancements, is still very welcome.

So we'll tell you it means it's good in some places, and very bad in others. Inspector Gadget is quite original and could have been great, but it doesn't really stand out above other games of this ilk.

Unfortunately, the controls are a bit too floaty, which results in some rather annoying and unfair deaths. other than that though, this isn't half bad. 79% = lo 296 30$ INSPECTOR GADGET (SNES) This is an incredibly close conversion of the smartola Super NES shoot-'em-up, featuring all the aliens, power-ups and killing you know and love. Except in blackand-white. Sounds good eh? Well, don't get too excited because it's far too easy, which ruins things somewhat. I really hope they do an Apocalypse 2. Because, whilst Apocalypse is a great idea and furnished nicely in graphical respects, it's crap. Unfair and frustrating, this is guaranteed to have you skinning your pet stoat with rage. Hopefully they could rectify all this with a sequel. 39% Huwa POWERFUL PRO BASEBALL (SNES) Baseball games have a habit of being impossible to understand and incredibly tedious to play thanks to reams and reams of pointlessand-not-at-all-interesting stats and a whole host of stupid, badly thought out American rules.

Good for lonely people. 78% CANNON FODDER (PC) Cannon Fodder is reminiscent of Sensible Soccer: The Machine Gun Edition (if it had ever existed). The controls are very similar to the footballing classic, but everyone's dressed in cammo gear and wielding big guns. In keeping with the Sensi atmosphere, a large part of your success comes from making tactical decisions as well as being a bit nifty with a joypad. The combat takes a little strategy, a little thinking ahead and a large amount of skill to succeed. Sometimes frustrating, but overall this is an excellent title. 85% you'd expect from the latest instalment of a saga to rival Jason Vorheese's.

All I have to do is travel across this section of my desert. Luckily at the moment we are living in the most sophisticated part of Australia two abandoned petrol stations last time I counted.

His name is TY Pical. I mean, he's got that new-fangled hat with all the corks hanging off it, and the Sheilas just start drooling when they see that! Next up, he's wearing an overstretched, overworn white singlet and you can even see his hairy belly button. But to put the icing on the YOB: It's all our fault, you know. Two hundred years ago our great grandfathers kicked all the criminals out of Britain. We stuck them on boats, shoved them out to sea and didn't even bother to say goodbye. Trouble was, our ancestors made one fundamental mistake one error which guaranteed a century of sadness from the world's most criminally stupid country. Do you know what that mistake was? It's easy to spot with the benefit of hindsight. It was the boats we gave them. They floated. THE NELSON Dear YOB, Please can you give me a few tips on how to beat my brothers on Mario Kart? They have a Super NES. ZOE DAVIS Chelmsford, Essex 37 1 BRUCE FORSYTH'S DRESSING ROOM Dear YOB, Please give me  because my mum thinks all the letters in your mag are fake! Please prove her wrong. Thanks. PAUL BLAKEMAN Maghull, Liverpool See YOB: There are two methods I'd recommend. The first involves racing against the 'ghost rider' who can be called up in training mode. I've forgotten exactly how you do it (I think you press START or SELECT, maybe on controller two, at the start of the race). Anyway, the ghost is actually yourself from the previous race, and it's a great way of improving your racing skills. The other method is to set up a championship between yourself and your brothers and make sure they play first. When they're halfway through the race, pull the plug out at the wall and blame it on whichever one was losing. With a bit of luck the winning brother will call the other one a cheat and an almighty scrap should follow. This fight alone should be enough to put both brothers out of the competition, but if it's not quite going to plan you could always jump in yourself to maximise their injuries. Whichever method you choose, you won't be able to overcome the fact that you're a girlie and unlikely to do well at any sporting event ever, because all you lot do is cry all the time and get excited when a baby craps itself. Oh well, you can't have everything...

I sincerely doubt it. A lot of people are blabbering on that CD-I will be the next entertainment platform, but I don't see it. All I've seen so far are some nice-looking but ultimately boring games, a particularly sad version of The Lovers' Guide for people who don't know a top from a bottom and some sort of dictionary thing that bored my tops off. 2. Seeing as the machine's not likely to change much, it's very unlikely. 3. In terms of specifications, it goes: Jaguar, 3DO, CD32, CD-l. However, software is a key consideration and right now quality games are rather scant, except for the CD32, which does have a few. 4. There may be a few, but don't hold your breath. 5. Whenever we can be bothered. 6. What was the question again? YOB: His name is Tony His poetry's cack. He's sad and lonely Hope he doesn't come back... YOB: Sorry, did I miss something or do you actually exist? PRIORY COURT ON A WEEKEND Dear YOB, I am writing to you concerning the new consoles, which though are technically amazing, I fear they may fall flat. Take the Mega-CD, it was touted as the next generation of computer gaming. However it has largely faded into obscurity because the software produced does not live up to v the machine's high standard. However, with the companies behind these machines pumping millions into the development I hope my fears will be proved wrong. However a machine is only as good as its software, so as much time should be dedicated to the software base. My view is this type of machine will eventually take over from computers and consoles, but only by trial and error. What do you think? THOMAS-ALAN MURPHY Redgate, Limerick 00 YOB: Yes an intelligent letter. You've highlighted one of the most important issues facing video games: the lack of new ideas and investment in the future. Not long ago just about any one could write a game and try to sell it. A lot of dross was written by people working from their bedrooms, but some of the greatest games in history too. From these humble beginnings grew some of the biggest development companies in the world, from people who at least had the chance of a decent start. Nowadays a development kit for a console can cost ,000 plus, so it's unlikely that anyone who hasn't got that sort of dosh is going to get a break. The upshot is that there must be a lot of frustrated people out there with brilliant games ideas who don't get the chance to create the games they want. The only exceptions to this rule are PC and Amiga, but since CD is seen as the future that's where new talent should be encouraged. In my experience the best ideas and games have come from people working on their own or in small teams. If the CD format really takes off the problem will only get worse and all we'll see are the same games time after time: flash graphics but boring gameplay. One day the games world is going to wake up to this problem, but unless games companies start worrying about it NOW they're going to find themselves knee-deep in nothing. They have been warned!

"GROUP TEST CVG MASTER SYSTEM ASTARDUST Excellently rendered 3D graphics and at a bargain price to boot. PROJECT X Spaceship blasting at its best and has Team-17 stamped all over it. AMIGA NES G-LOC SEGA Although this game didn't make much of an impact on Mega Drive, the Master System version's a different ball game. It's an in-thecockpit air combat riot, with you taking hundreds of planes armed with a few missiles and a large machine gun. It's by no means a classic, but it's still the best bit of blasting you can get on the Master System, and a hell of a lot better than the only other 3D aircraft shoot-'em-up, Afterburner. .99 ISTARDUST BLOODHOUSE By crossing Asteroids with Star Wars, Bloodhouse has created one of the best Amiga shoot-'em-ups in a while. The bulk of the gameplay has you blasting at massive asteroids and space craft. Survive and you're transported to a 3D PROJECT X SPECIAL ED. TEAM-17 The Special Edition is the same as the original Project X, only easier. At first glance this seems like a very basic shoot-'em-up, but in fact it's one of the fastest, most frantic blasters you'll come across on any system. It's not quite up to the standard of some console SEU's, but it's without a doubt the best bit of blasting action you can get on the Amiga at the moment. .99 DROPZONE MINDSCAPE Very like the original C64 version of Dropzone, which is a very good thing indeed. the graphics are puny compared to 16-bit games, but the playability shines through. It's got Defenderstyle gameplay which roars along at a fantastic pace as you try to rescue stranded space men while blowing apart hordes of alien craft. This is by far the best shoot 'em up on 8-bit. In fact, it's almost worth going out and buying a second-hand NES for. .99 URIDIUM 2 Retains all the qualities of the 8-bit version, but has 16-bit graphics. CD-i KETHER PHILIPS In many ways Kether is similar to Silpheed on Mega-CD only it's more interactive, plus there's more to crash into and shoot at.

CD32 MICROCOSM PSYGNOSIS The first game for CD32, and like most debut titles, not as good as most people anticipated. Microcosm uses a filmed background with sprites on top. This limits the gameplay, and despite the programmers' efforts that's exactly what's happened here. While it's great to look at, Microcosm doesn't play at all well. .99 LYNX IDESERT STRIKE ATARI Believe it or not, this handheld version of EA's top Mega Drive hit is almost identical to the 16-bit version. The graphics are spoton and almost all the missions are featured. Not only is this the best shoot-'emup on the Lynx, it's one of the best games on the machine. .99 GAME BOY in areas. If you've got a 3DO, this is still worth picking up if you fancy dispensing death to the universe at large, but it's certainly not a game which makes you want to rush out and buy the machine. .99 R-TYPE KONAMI Even though R-Type II's out on Game Boy, it doesn't match up to this version. It's the same as the coinop with the same levels 023035 HUSET I SEEK AND DESTROY MINDSCAPE Seek and Destroy reinforces the fact that CD games don't need state-of-the-art graphics. Instead it's a traditional shoot-'em-up with a twist. The helicopter you pilot stays static on the screen while the landscape scrolls round.

Unlike its sequel, this version is genuinely challenging and the graphics are really clear. .99 GAME GEAR TOTAL ECLIPSE DYNAMIX The 3DO's first, and currently only, shoot-'em-up is certainly good to look at. It uses a similar graphic engine to Crash 'N' Burn to create its intricate texture mapped graphics. The results are astounding, which is more than can be said for the gameplay, which is decidedly lacking HALLEY WARS   quite basic, with predictable attack waves. However, there's enough variety in the levels and their bosses to keep the game playable, and it's challenging to make sure you get your money's IR-TYPE TAITO There are countless average shoot-'em ups available on the PC Engine, but R-Type is a game we just couldn't let go by without a mention. It's simply the best conversion of R-Type that you'll find anywhere. Admittedly it does suffer a little from slowdown, but you have to give it its dues considering it's running on an 8-bit machine. The graphics are coin-op perfect and the sound's absolutely spoton. Fantastic, if a little dated. .99 IDROPZONE MINDSCAPE Similar to the NES version, but lacks the pace of the console versions.

Apart from the excellent high-speed polygon graphics, it's loaded with excellent ideas and some of the most imaginative bosses you'll come across in any game. The FX chip is what makes the game possible, but it's also what adds a few quid more to the price. Still, for a game of this quality it's well worth the extra cash. SOL FEACE SEGA Despite being a bit of an oldie, Sol Feace still packs enough of a punch to keep it up there as a top CD blaster.

"THEY TELL IT LIKE IT IS OPINION CVG BIG EDS THE EDITORS OF BRITAIN'S BEST GAMES MAGAZINES TELL YOU WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR ON THEIR SPECIALISED FORMATS... STEVE MERRETT, EDITOR MEAN MACHINES SEGA CHRISTINE ERSKINE, EDITOR PC REVIEW I've been split three ways this month. Firstly I've been playing an early copy of Konami's Probotector conversion which has had me blown away more than the alien scum it contains! I'm similarly engrossed in Virgin's Goal! imagine Kick Off 2 on the Mega Drive and you'll get an idea of how playable it is. Finally, Virtua Racing has proved it's worth the price by keeping the Mean Machines team busy with its brilliant racing action. Just think: it's starting to get sunny outside, and the Sega scene is getting every bit as hot I'd get that console out in the garden if I were you... There are more games coming out on CD right now than on floppy, trouble is, most of them are pretty poor. You can drool over graphics and bop with the tunes, but can you play the damn things? Can you hell! There are some exceptions: Megarace has plenty of thrills, Myst is a very beautiful and intense adventure game, and the Star Trek CD is worth it for the authentic voices. On the whole though, we go back to our old faithful floppy disks and load up Doom. Now there's a real game! TIM BOONE, EDITOR NINTENDO MAGAZINE SYSTEM PAUL RAND, EDITOR OF CVG This month the outstanding Super Metroid is out to prove that Nintendo is still ahead of the competition for quality. Hardware-wise the Super Game Boy looks on schedule for autumn, promising all kinds of fun for SNES and Game Boy owners alike. Meanwhile the NES is soon to benefit from a near perfect conversion of the Namco classic Pac-Man. Finally, as Sega prepares to launch Mega32, NCL has issued press releases in Japan regarding a product bearing the potential to blow this Mega Drive peripheral clean away! It's not Project Reality, it's something entirely fresh and exciting! (Turn to CVG's news pages to find out!) Looking for a game that'll get you in the mood for the World Cup next month? Then there's only one to go for in my opinion the brilliant Kick Off 3 on SNES. While the industry in general seems to be baying for the collapse of the console market, there are still softies who can trot out some incredible titles the aformentioned footy game, for instance. But games for the new systems are getting better and better Frontier on CD32 and Tempest 2000 for Jaguar are prime examples. Hurrah the future is starting to look rosy. ALAN DYKES, EDITOR OF CU AMIGA Excitement isn't the word. Amiga is. I've been having fun with Bubble and Squeak (review on page 60) recently; it's one of the cutest and most playable platformers in ages. One to watch out for in the next month or so is Robinson's Requiem from Silmarils. This maximum realism 3D 'survival simulation is impressive, to say the least. Any CD32 owners who've been waiting for Adventuresoft's Simon the Sorcerer to appear is in for a treat too. Although the game remains the same it contains voice-overs (including Red Dwarf's Chris Barrie), instead of the voice bubbles of the original.

"CVG Q&A HELP! CLEAR PICTURES ANSWER ME THIS' WE HEAR YOU ASK! AND THIS IS WHERE WE DO JUST THAT; REPLIES TO ALL YOUR POSERS, WHETHER IT BE ABOUT A PIECE OF KIT OR AN OBSCURE QUESTION ABOUT A PARTICULAR GAME, HERE'S WHERE WE'LL PUT YOU STRAIGHT ABOUT YOUR QUERIES... I've been reading CVG for about eight years now and one of the main things I've noticed is that the quality of your game shots has improved. By the look of things you used to use photographs but clearly you don't anymore. So what's the secret? G Virgoe, Barnsley GIZ A JOB Like many other people I'd love to work on CVG but I've no idea how to go about it. Could you give me a few tips please? Terry Thompson, Ireland Apple Macs are one component of the sophisticated system we use to grab images of the games we review First and foremost be a fan of games. The main problem we have with people writing in is that they only play games on one format, and so they don't have a great knowledge of what the other machines are like. Secondly you'll have to have played games for a long while. Some of the CVG team have been playing games for up to 15 years so they know their stuff. Try and get some sample reviews together but make sure it's not Streetfighter Il because everyone does that! And make sure you've got a decent education and that you've got a sound grasp of the English Language. Then it's just a case of waiting for a vacancy to appear in either CVG or The Guardian (on a Monday) and giving it your best shot! We've recently updated from a piece of kit called Theatrics on our screenshot grabbing Apple Macintosh (the machines we write and design CVG on) to a new system called Rasterops, which means we can now use an electronic method of 'taking pictures' of game screens for every machine. Previously, however, we had to use a camera to take pictures of games on the new machines, like the Jaguar, Cd-i and the Panasonic REAL Player. The grabbing system is quite simple to use. you take the machine you want to grab graphics from (say a SNES) and put a special lead in its video output port (instead of the normal TV or monitor lead). This lead then plugs into an electronic box of tricks which in turn plugs into a Mac. The RasterOps software circuitry is installed on the Mac and once the signal from the SNES reaches it it appears on the Mac's monitor and we simply save to hard disk whatever shots from the game we want! You will still see photographs or transparencies of games in CVG, but these will only be in First Shots or for some Work In Progresses, where we haven't yet beeen able to review fully in the CVG offices.

"CVG Q&A HELP! AMIGA WORRY With the A1200 doing well, rumours abound that Commodore is working on a 64-bit machine. ELICANTIT TIITTITUDDD SH I'm quite keen on buying an Amiga but my mates say that Commodore is about to go bust at any moment so it wouldn't be a good idea. Is this true? Worried CVG fan NUMBER 1 OR 2 Commodore is a worldwide company, and the rumours that your mates will have heard will be concerning Commodore in the States, where the company has announced considerable losses. The UK division of the company however is relatively more successful. This is mainly because in Britain the Amiga's strength is that it is sold as a games machine, which is not the case in the USA. The thing to remember however, is that here the Amiga does very well indeed because it's marketed strongly for its game capabilities (the Amiga recently regained its No 2 sales spot from the SNES) and software sales are consistently high. Not only this but many top games are developed on the Amiga first (Sensible Soccer) and then are converted to console. If the worst does come to the worst, though, and Commodore does go under, that doesn't neces. sarily mean that the Amiga will go down with it. Commodore did not invent the Amiga in the first place, it bought the Amiga off the developers of the machine, and should Commodore kick the bucket it will not be short of buyers for what is a truly formidable home computer. After not buying anything for what seems like years I've finally got together the cash to buy a Mega Drive. The thing is I've been saving for so long that Sega has now brought out the Mega Drive 2. What are the differences between this and the old Mega Drive? Peter Duggsey, Catford, London 16-BIT The answer is very little as it happens! The main difference is that there's no headphone socket so if you're like Rik and you like playing your games with headphones don't buy it. Also we think it looks a bit crappy and childish compared to the original machine. The reason for the redesign was simple. It enabled Sega to make the machine cheaper but sell it at the same price. The Mega Drive II is cheaper for Sega to produce, but the difference is purely cosmetic, though the later model doesn't have a headphones socket. GAME TIPS MEGA DRIVE NBA JAM have sent in this tip but Spencer Adams was first out of the hat. On the 'Tonight's match-up' screen tap A 13 times and then hold B and C until the court appears.

Dennis Smith, London the FAST you could get either a hefty fine, a prison sentence or both. Whether you shop your 'mate' or not is up to you but make sure you stay away from this shady chap's software! I'm really sick of playing shoot-'em-ups and beat-'emups and have decided to flog my SNES and games and get a PC so I can play more in-depth games.

If you want a CD-ROM drive (and that's quickly becoming the norm), then add about  to the total. Oh, and make sure it's double speed because very few games support single speed drives.
