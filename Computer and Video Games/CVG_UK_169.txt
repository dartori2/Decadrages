Skews, D. Upchurch, A. Simmons, M. Patterson, R. Leadbetter, and M. Broughton. THANKS TO: Gary, and Warren Harrod. New CVG team alert! I didn't have opportunity to introduce myself last month, so I'll do it now: Hello, my name's Paul Davies. I play computer and video games for a living. What a skank! Seriously, though, I took this job because there were some bad things happening to UK games mags. There seemed to be only one game (Mortal Kombat 3), one machine (PlayStation), and one vision of the future (Mortal Kombat 3 on PlayStation.) Meanwhile the ever exciting development of the whole computer and video games scene is playing dead. Or at least hanging on to a 'Mercy'! Of course I'm exaggerating, but the truth is no magazine is doing our namesake justice yet. And the fact is only we can. Last month CVG promised change. Soon you're going to see it centre stage. This month it's happened behind the scenes. Allow me to introduce the team who will have the greatest effect on computer and video gaming since a certain gleam, ricocheting across Nolan Bushnell's eye.

At long last Nintendo have released one tantalizing photograph of their 'Nintendo 64' controller. And here it is. As speculated the unit is three pronged, and features an analogue joystick in addition to the trademark cross key. Nobody is sure why two of the six buttons in the Street Fighter Il formation are of a different size and colour, nor has there a reason been given for the missing Select button. What Nintendo have disclosed is that the back of the controller hides a small cartridge slot, intended to house a memory card. In addition to that, we heard rumour that the centre handle is fitted with a gun-like trigger. A short time ago a spokesman for Silicon Graphics explained how true 64-bit gaming would change the depth of the whole gaming experience, as much as it would the look of it. This controller is indication of what he said is true. We'll know for sure on November 25th, when CVG attends the Shoshinkai show in Japan. We guarantee a full report next issue.  oo NINTENDO Though the overall look of the machine is the same, radical changes have been made to the logo. Apparently the name had to go because of legal wrangles with another Japanese firm. As for that weird, isometric 'N' there well we actually prefer it. # "


"EDITORIAL EDITORIAL CVG people bits RIALS 2168 AKIBA LION Paul Davies Editor He's calm, collected and a good decision maker. Oh, and he has a long face. Only kidding. He isn't calm, collected or good at making decisions at all. When a game comes out that he likes, he loses his mind. Hands flailing, eyes rolled back, and voice like something from the Jim Henson Workshop, he'll describe the finer points of his favourite game through the art of poetry: \"Look at the fantastic polygon-based worlds, scrolling by in Pseudo-3D!\" And of course we all know what he means. Paul's playlist: Wipeout, Zero Divide, Guardian Heroes Tom Guise Deputy Editor Has currently served three years writing about Sega, and playing Super Mario Kart. Now he's crazy about Wipeout on PlayStation, but is telling everybody they ought to invest in a Saturn, and devote long hours to Mortal Kombat 3 on PC. Believes the first Saturn Sonic game would warrant National Holiday status. He's a fool, but at least he's honest. Depend on Tom to tell it like it is. Tom's playlist: X-Men: Children Of The Atom, Virtua Cop Saturn Level 1 29 ROU LEPI, IBBE CUN Que Ed Lomas Staff Writer The ultimate Pink Floyd fan, and gamesplayer extraordinaire. Well, he's out of the ordinary anyway. Spends all day at work with his face stuck in some game, breaks for half an hour at six, then catches the fast train home for some Pink Floyd and more games. Apparently cries himself to sleep because of Tom G's eternal ribbing about his work. Of course Tom is only reacting to Ed's prodigious gamesplaying skills. Ed's playlist: Wipeout, Doom, EWJ2, MK3 3102 MPA TELL US ABOUT IT! To save on all the letters and phone calls, asking us which games we think are going to be the Next Big Thing, we've decided to turn the whole situation around. Every month we run almost every story we can get our hands on. Sometimes it's obvious (the Sega stuff), other times it's pretty obscure (Team 47 Goman from Coconuts Japan). What we need to know from you is which upcoming games do you want to know more about, and especially those you wish would hurry up and get here first! From now on CVG wants every piece of correspondence that comes our way to include a Most Wanted request, along with the name of your current Favourite Game. Once we have enough votes, we can tally them up and create some kind of chart. And we'll work on compiling a wants list of our own letting you into a few secrets in the process maybe. You know the address. MISSING IN ACTION By way of explanation to those of you who buy CVG regularly. Gary Lord, once Deputy Editor, is now Production Manager. He isn't writing for the mag anymore, instead he's making sure it always goes out on time. Julie Heap, erstwhile Art Editor, is now applying her talents to designing beauty brochures for The Orient Express. As for Edward Lawrence aka Rad Automatic he's working on the UK's official Sega Saturn magazine. 1000 APOLOGIES Time to own up to some horrendous mistakes which made their merry way into CVG issue #168. First of all Nintendo are giving away 100 Ultra 64's at the Shoshinkai show in November, together with 100 copies of the three games available at launch (a total of 300 carts). Not 300 Ultras as reported. Greg Staples is the conceptual artist for Gremlin's 'Loaded' not Jay Sharples. Sorry Jay. Sorry Greg. And last, but no means least, is this fantastic list of errors to be found in the Virtua Fighter 32X review: 1. Windows '95 version avalailable? Of course not. 2. Saturn version planned? It's been available for well over a year. 3. Virtua Fighter on Game Gear? Just our little joke... (those responsible have had their Game Gears confiscated). 4. No. It's not coming out on the PlayStation!!! PS. To those of you who are confused by the recommendation, then utter condemnation of Street Fighter II: The Movie. Let's just say the gameplay, if slow, remains true to the Street Fighter series, but the visuals are damn hard to come to terms with. Oh, and it isn't a direct port from the coin-op either (good grief). Tom Cox Art Editor We don't question Tom. He just is. As a rule Tom plays any game that comes into the office, but is ever ready to abandon them all for an hour-long session on Mac-Man (feeble Macintosh version of Pac-Man). We don't question that. He just does. In coming months Tom is going to transform CVG into something that looks truly amazing. No question. Cox's corner: Mac-Man, Apeiron Trea Doyle Deputy Art Editor Has spent the last month patrolling Jaime's desk, to prevent him ducking out to play XMen with 'Maximum'. This along with deciphering Ed's coded messages that are tagged onto all his copy, then transferring it neatly into pages of useful information. Tom Guise is especially grateful to Trea because she laughs at all his jokes. Trea's playlist: Wipeout, Hebereke's Popoon, Apeiron Jaime Smith Designer Born in Southend. Raised on a healthy diet of weekend soccer, and trips to the arcade. Just about the only game Jaime wants to hear about at the moment is Street Fighter Alpha, though he's just bought PlayStation so Wipeout isn't far from his thoughts. Is totally obsessed with video games, since he used to work in a specialist retailer called Games HQ until they went bust! Here's hoping he does a better job of selling CVG! Jaime's playlist: Street Fighter Alpha, Wipeout, X-Men: Children Of The Atom "

Chain combos where buttons pressed in sequence generate legitimate combination moves, and Special Gauge better known for its use in SSF II Turbo and 'Super Combos.' DarkStalkers is also Capcom's first fighting game where characters guard, and per form multiple hits while in the air. In addition. Capcom obviously saw the benefit of SNK'S dash' feature, found in many of that company's combat titles, and worked this into the mix. Obviously what we're saying here is that DarkStalkers plays an important in Capcom's portfolio. Just as soon as a fully-plavable version is available. CVG will go into more detail. At the moment, mitri the only change we know of is a new attract sequence for PlayStation. Meanwhile, you could do some detective work your self by checking out the coin-op life than bloody SFIII! boundaries once more, with a red hot sequel to Ridge Racer! MORE CAPCOM COOL VIA VIRGIN While we're obviously delirious over the imminent Street Fighter Alpha, there's equal excitement surrounding these next two titles.

After selecting either Chris Redfield, or Gill Valentine to lead the way, the game requires players to solve the mystery of the spooky mansion. Suspense comes in many different guises, usually in the form of some horrendous monster leaping out of the shadows when it's least expected. And while it is possible to run away before being noticed, it's far better to stand and fight to enjoy the carnage! Look for more on this very soon. Meanwhile check these amazing shots. We're not kidding you could show this thing at the cinema!!! Hackers, and ZOMBIES! The last part STARS don't know about at first, but it doesn't take long for them to find out! Team B of STARS is dispatched to investigate mysterious happenings in the woods outside of Racoon.

A pack of wild dogs attack, who mysteriously will not die. They chase what is left of the A team to an old mansion, where the adventure begins. AMAZING isn't it! And possibly the last thing you'd expect to come out of Capcom.

Ridge Racer Revolution brings an all-new course and all-new graphics to the Ridge Racer engine, as you race around new cities, underpasses, through winding tunnels and around tropical beach-fronts. There's even more roadside detail than before and even more speech from your over-friendly commentator, as he recites such bizarre lines as \"Locked on target!\" and «Get ready to block!\" All backed by wild new remixes of the original Ridge Racer tunes. Among the many new features there's now a rear-view mirror, giving you a decent chance to prevent the opposition from passing you. And, following the usual Namco routine of including a Galaxian level in the loading sequence, Revolution includes a bizarre 'Dancing Galaga' sequence. Although what hidden features this reveals is as yet unknown. Most incredible of all though, is the inclusion of a two-player mode using the PlayStation link-up cable. This feature alone sets Ridge Racer Revolution up to be one of the most eagerly awaited PlayStation games. However, it's unlikely we'll see an official release before the later half of next year. Nonetheless, we'll give you full coverage of it in the coming months. 234464 '10\" 765 PHOTOY GROHE 1999 SNK AND SEGA JOIN FORCES! MORTAL KOMBAT 3 IS THE ULTIMATE or phone on the SUU HEDERN Sega of Japan have just struck a deal with SNK, to bring the top NEO GEO developer's hottest titles to the Saturn. And the first titles to be converted are going to be Fatal Fury 3 and the brilliant King Of Fighters '95! Announced at the recent Tokyo JAMMA show, the partnership is still at an early stage, with work on the games yet to even begin. However, what is clear is that SNK will be coding the Saturn versions themselves, and if they manage to bring perfect conversions to the Saturn (which seems more than likely), we should be in for a real treat. Both games are among the hottest fighting games currently around, with King of Fighters '95 in particular, being hailed as arguably the greatest 2D fighting game ever made (scoring 93% on page 38 of this month). Both games are expected to be released some time during the second half of next year, with the first pictures being released in the upcoming months. When, of course, we'll reveal everything to you. Players of the recently-released home versions of MK3 might have noticed the occasional «MK3 Ultimate Kombat Kode\" flashing up on-screen. They may have also noticed that they don't work on any currently available versions of the game, so what are they for? This: The long-awaited and long-delayed MK3 coin-op upgrade which has been now been named as Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate. As well as the new word in the title there are six new characters: Kitana, Scorpion, Reptile, Mileena, Jade and supposedly Ermac the rumoured character from the first two games who turned out to be a error message. As well as the new characters there are going to be more hidden characters, some of whom can be accessed from the Ultimate Kombat Kode screen; more special moves for some characters; possibly a new finishing move for everyone and more backgrounds. The tournament mode from Super Streetfighter 2 reappears in the form of a 16-player championship allowing you to humiliate loads of people at once. It should be out before Christmas. Intriguing fact: If you go to the cinema and see Mortal Kombat the Movie and sit through the end credits you'll see six symbols flash up. Note them down and try them out on any version of MK3 to get 'Randper Kombat' where your character morphs all of the time. Shame we already knew that. NUE HI DORIS Miran O XHUTH "

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected SATURN LANDSTALKER IT'S AN The creators of possibly the greatest Megadrive RPG, Landstalker, are currently working on a Saturn adventure in a similar vein. Climax's new project, Dark Saviour, adopts a similar isometric perspective to its 16-bit predecessor. Only this time, instead of using cleverlydrawn backdrops to create the pseudo3D effect, polygons have been used to generate genuine 3D environments. And it's more than just buildings that are being created out of polygons. Some impressive 3D monsters are set to appear in the game. the first revealed being a giant dragon. Dark Saviour offers a far greater degree of freedom than Landstalker, with multilevelled cities and dungeons to explore. Plus there's a variety of different characters that join you on your quest, in what seems to be a Shining Force-esque fashion. Currently 50% complete, the game is set for release in Japan around December. However, due to the amount of Japanese text in the game, it's unlikely we'll see the game over here for quite a while. CLASSIC! Culinga PAC-MAN VELLOW WOO MATT 186 14 SPEED 203 HICH DAE DANA DESCENT IS DECENT TOYPHP *** RAYAXIL Descent, the popular PC game, is coming to the PlayStation. Obviously influenced by Doom, Descent improves on the modified 2D game engine of Doom, where you can never have one floor above another (take a look at the game if you never actually noticed this) and turns it into a complete 3D game with tunnels and rooms stretching off in all directions. The game's set in mining shafts in space where you must manoeuvre a tiny space ship through the claustrophobic tunnels whilst avoiding and destroying service and defence droids. The excellent PC version of which Ed Lomas is a big fan had some of the best 3D graphics around so what can be done to improve upon it for the PlayStation version? We can tell you that the graphics are almost identical to the original, but with the added bonus of PlayStation's custom chips, you've now got some fantastic light-sourcing effects. When playing, you'll notice that all of your weapons light up the surrounding walls an effect that works really well. Look along a tunnel and fire a concussion missile and you'll be able to see the glow from the flame lighting up the corridor, right round the corners as well. The game's still got quite a way to go before it's finished but we can't wait to see whether the brilliant Deathmatch-style Anarchy mode is included to be used with the link-up cable. We reckon it will. It's also coming to a Saturn near your TV as well. 101 903 Namco might be responsible for some of the PlayStation's hottest new coin-op conversions, but they're also bringing a compilation of some of their more classic arcade titles to the PlayStation. Namco Museum features pixel-perfect (and we should hope so) conversions of obscure titles like Rally-X, Toypop and Bosconian, together with more legendary games such Pole Position, Galaga, and Pac-Man. We're actually looking forward to this, mainly for the perfect versions of Galaga and Pacman, so expect more news closer to its spring release date. Meanwhile, concerned Namco fans need not worry about this bizarre nostalgia-trip. They haven't completely lost their heads, working, as they are, on a PlayStation conversion of arcade mega-blaster Galaxian 3. 16 "

VIEWPOINT Jor a shoot 'em up, Viewpoint is a pretty bizarre name. But then Viewpoint is a pretty bizarre game. And only due in small part, to the novel isometric viewpoint it adopts, and from which it gains its unusual name. When the game originally surfaced on the Neo Geo around two years ago, it was a sensation. On paper it doesn't sound like anything special — six levels of scrolling action, through which you have to guide a small fighter, blasting everything in sight but to look at it was totally amazing! Lustrous translucent graphics formed the incredible alien landscapes, from rippling green waters and strange coil-like vegetation, to cracked deserts and shifting, molten lava pools. The actual enemies that roamed these levels however, were infinitely more fantastical. Schools of giant gold fish, sea-serpents, rock turtles, slinky springs and herds of slugs are just a few of the intergalactic wildlife that you had to face. Viewpoint however, was more than just a freak to look at. It played like a demented monster too. Battling the multitude of enemies that filled the screen, it was one of the most reflexbending blasters around. And the cleverly constructed levels required sharpened wits as well as dexterity, to solve some of the trickier obstacles. And now the diseased maniac that is Viewpoint has come to the Playstation. The same six levels, packed with the same formations of fantastical creatures. Only this time the weird and wonderful graphics have been given the Playstation treatment. More colours, newer textures and vivid glowering explosions make Viewpoint madder than ever. (ABOVE) Charging up to unleash a super shot. AN INTROSPECTIVE VIEW Launching you into the game is a cinematic computer-generated intro. Giant space-cruisers, dogfights and warp tunnels abound, but how exactly you find yourself fighting fish and slugs remains a mystery. 18 "

Entertaining, but stiff control makes it frustrating (VERDICT PLAYSTATION I'm a massive fan of the original Neo Geo Viewpoint, so the idea of it coming to the PlayStation seemed pretty exciting. The reality though is somewhat less thrilling. While the PlayStation can clearly handle better graphics than the Neo Geo, Viewpoint, it seems cannot. What I'm trying to say, is the updated look of PS Viewpoint lacks the super-stylish, cool look of the Geo version, simply looking more unattractive. Likewise, the superb tunes of the original have curiously been replaced by out-of-place techno tracks. Of course, if the gameplay was the same, the presentation wouldn't matter so much. But, while the layout of the levels is identical, the actual speed and more noticeably, the controls, have suffered considerably. If you've never played Geo Viewpoint, you'll find the PS version to a be a fairly decent blaster. A straight conversion of the original though would have left you gobsmacked. TOM GUISE (VALUE. Not really a game you'd buy your PlayStation for. OVERALL A decent enough shoot 'em up converted from an incredible shoot 'em up. Wasted potential. 19 "

Look inside the glove compariment of any juny Interaclive Assault Rig, and you'll find a sick bass PC CD-ROM PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. ONCE UPON A TIME... The introduction sequence of Assault Rigs explains the history of video games right from the \"Pong'-like 'Ping' through to someone playing the futuristic Virtual Reality version of Assault Rigs itself. lobal competition between PC gamesplayers is already the norm. However Sony Interactive among a million others imagine things could get a lot more interesting if network gaming took off in the arcades. Not in the same way as Battletech, which already exists, but through state-of-the-art Virtual Reality modules, finetuned for competition in some form of televised sport. Obviously the game SIE foresee capturing the imaginations of punters and advertisers alike is their own Assault Rigs The concept is very simple: A 'Jockey' selects one of three Rigs. These vehicles are designed to manoeuvre quickly and efficiently around arenas of varying complexity, with two objectives in mind to collect a specified number of gems within the tight time limit, and to knock out enemy Rigs in the process. CULUM Look at those amazing rendered 3D graphics! You don't get that on your 16-bits. What realistic appendages. This is part of the rendered intro but the actual ingame graphics aren't really that far off. Looks a bit like Tron if anyone remembers that. 20 "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW SECOND OPINION True enough, Assualt Rigs presents real problems in terms of motion sickness. For me this has meant tackling the game in small doses, as I have found it impossible to stomach beyond half an hour at a time. Without labouring the point too much, I suspect this is going to be a problem for most people too. Otherwise, the concept is cool, and SIE have worked it well. On the surface this is a real showcase for the PlayStation's capabilities, beyond that there is an intriguing balance of puzzle-solving and all-out blasting. The idea could have been taken further, so this isn't really a classic in the same way as Wipeout. Nonetheless Assault Rigs is a worthy addition to your starter collection. PAUL DAVIES 3D INDEEDY The excellent 3D effects of Assault Rigs are shown off by the wide choice of viewpoints some useful and some not especially so. Outside Turret Cam Inside Rig ENTER THE ARENA The game takes place in four different arena environments: 29. Behind Overhead The arenas are made up of multi-coloured blocks and grids. A messy techno industrial set of arenas. (VERDICT. PLAYSTATION These SIE games are coming thick and fast to the PlayStation and they're surprisingly good quality. Assault Rigs starts off looking similar to that old Disney film Tron, only with much more sickening graphics, and, the initial levels are so simple that they're almost a waste of time. Tom Cox could probably finish them. As you get into the game, and used to the nausea inducing nature of movement, plus watery eyes caused by the searing graphics, you'll find that it's actually more, than a plain shooter. The levels are constantly changing, there are lots of cool power-ups, and plenty of detailed enemies to keep you occupied. It's not too easy either. Though the brilliant graphics are occasionally marred by the odd glitch or slowdown, the rig's handling is always smooth. Add to that the unique atmosphere and you've got a brilliant game.

(HASN'T GOT A BACKBONE) Can he possibly be starring in an even better game than last time? Last year Earthworm Jim appeared in one of the first games ever to star a worm. But perhaps the novelty of playing a garden wriggler has worn off, seeing as we've now got a game full of them — 'Worms' — going pointy-end to pointy-end against Jimmy's new one. Surprisingly, though the first game uses many original platform ideas, Jim 2 still has masses of completely new features. Perhaps, then, this is the greatest game ever to star a worm, yet again! LEVEL 2 LORENZEN'S SOIL This level was apparently hell to program, as the whole scene is moved around by shooting at the earth. LEVEL 1 ANYTHING BUT TANGERINES The first level is pretty similar in terms of looks to 'What the Heck' in the original game. It plays similarly too, getting players familiar with Jim's new moves. Those flames could melt poor Jim's trainers... But by shooting the soil onto the floor... Jim buries the flames, making it safe. THE SEGA SCREEN The big cat from the first game won't let Jim cross the water... So Jim goes back and collects a pig from the ditch of mud...

Lots of games go for the \"wacky humour» approach, like \"Worms\", but Jim 2 succeeds by being so mad that you couldn't understand the jokes if you tried. Jim has plenty of weapons and moves, and there's always something to do whether it's trying to solve a puzzle or searching for hidden extras. You just don't have time to get bored! The graphics are some of the best on a 16-bit machine ever, and the sound's brilliantly wacky. Jim's first game was fab. This one's bigger, tougher and much better. I love it lots.

To many Mega Drive gamers it means Ecco the Dolphin 1 and 2 two of the best games on the machine. They combined amazingly detailed graphics and animation with totally mellow music and sound effects, creating a totally tranceinducing experience. Then they added some incredible gameplay which had Ed, for one, completely engrossed. Of course, when CVG heard that they'd done a simi, larly interesting game for the Megadrive 32X, we were intrigued. A By powering-up your regular weapons you can get multiple shots. BEAK-UPS During Kol's travels he comes across occasional places where the blue Earth crystal pokes up through the ground and spews forth a veritable feast of bonuses. These are used to power-up his beak and magical glowing gulch (chest bit), enabling him to fire various weapons at his newly-mutated enemies. With each new weapon, Kolibri uses the skill he learned at chameleon school to change colour, conveniently letting the player know which weapon is selected. Standard Shot Not surprisingly this is your standard straight shot. Bouncing Shot This one bounces off walls and floors. Homing Shot Like the Standard Shot, except it targets for you. Scatter Shot A little bomb explodes deadly dots all across the screen. 28 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG FEED ME Hummingbirds burn off a lot of energy when flying, so naturally Kolibri is required to obtain his fair share of nectar for energy, and gnats for protein. It's a bit like the air and fish bit of Ecco this, isn't it. SCORES 10mmummum HE DOESN'T KNOW THE WORDS The story behind little Kolibri's quest is this: Inside the Earth there's a powerful blue crystal which creates all life on the planet. This becomes disturbed one day when two meteors crash down onto the planet one containing a red crystal, and one containing a green one. The crystals spread their power around the planet, with the red one mutating all animals and insects into evil monsters, while the green one has the same effect on plants. Our blue Earth crystal senses this and, rather than bother the United Nations, calls on little Kolibri to save the planet. And so the scene is set for much blasting and other crystal-related action. ECCO 2........... THUNDERFORCE 4 GRAPHICS BRING OUT THE RAID Colourful but flat scenery. There are plenty of horribly mutated insects and plants for Kolibri to fight with his newfound techno beak, including these nasties here. Most of them only take one hit before they explode but some require serious thought on the player's part before allowing Kolibri past. ANIMATION......79 Not as good as it should be. GARDEN TIME When flying about, keep a close eye out for odd-looking flowers. Any with little bits flying out of the spout, for example, can be sucked up to give Kolibri more energy. On the other hand, some just eat him! MUSIC Inspired by Pink Floyd only not as good. SOUND EFFECTS. 78 A bit fuzzy and feeble really. GAMEPLAY Something's not quite right about the \"handling' of Kolibri. The way that most of the weapons home in makes it boring. This later level is very reminiscent of the Ecco games. The 32X's abilities are wasted, though the game's good. Did you know that hummingbirds can fly backwards? We're full of useless and uninteresting facts like that, we are. VERDICT 32X OVERALL Hard 2 player A-special B-weapon burst Hold direction while firing Norma! Music and Sound FX Sound Test 05 Should appeal to shoot-'em-up and hummingbird fans though Kolibri's dolphin cousin Ecco lives in a much better, cheaper game. I'm a big Ecco fan, having played both games right through so I was really looking forward to Kolibri. Though the graphics are similar they don't use any of the 32X's extra powers and the Pink Floyd-inspired music isn't quite as good as Ecco's. Sadly, the game isn't much like the marine classic, instead it's a fairly plain shooter with pretty graphics. The game becomes dull after you've flown Kolibri around for a few min utes, with 'guns' automatically taking everything out for you. Also the puzzles are frustrating because the movement of your hummingbird isn't instinctive enough. A good game but it's a bit of a let-down. ED LOMAS Ring Shot Powerful orange rings with a limited range. Laser Shot Pretty-looking homing laser. 29 "

Imagine our surprise when the \"best version yet\" arrived in our deluxe penthouse offices. You don't need telling about Mortal Kombat 3 again. If you do you're stupid. There's been much more written about this game than most, and this is probably the closest version to the arcade original of the lot.

One of the big new features in the PC CDROM version, apart from the big box, is the ability to play against other computers on a LAN (local area network.) If you work in a building with networked machines, just put your name on the challenge screen and wait for a workmate to 'ask you outside', as it were. Not many people work in a building full of death-crazy Kombat fans, however. And if you go to the trouble of linking up with your friends, you're far more likely to play Doom Death Matches. You can still send rude messages to your opponent in the middle of fights, which makes it yet more fun. VERDICT PC CD-ROM I've played every version of Mortal Kombat 3 so far and still think that it's great. This is just as good as the Play Station version but with more features. The loading times are much, much shorter than the PS version and it runs just as quickly on a decent machine. All of the arcade features are there, meaning that there's not much more to say about it. The slight downside is that the PC version has slightly lower resolution than the others. Otherwise it's just really brill and Mortal fans should purchase a copy or two at once. ED LOMAS 31 "

Everyone knows that rally driving's miles more fun than Formula 1, simply because you get to throw the car around the corners, power sliding and jumping your way over hills as well as bashing anyone in front of you off the track. It's because of this that Megadrive owners have been getting very excited about Codemasters' Super Skidmarks, as they boast that it's «The ultimate rally riot!\" The basic idea is the same as every driving game: Win. You can do this any way you want in Skidmarks if someone's in your way, smack 'em out of it! Sound like your kind of thing? Course it does!

WW (VERDICT MEGA DRIVE This is pretty much a 3D version of Micro Machines, with even the controls and some sound effects exactly the same. Though the game's good fun, the bumpy tracks and the slightly awkward view mean that it isn't as smooth to play as MM2. There are loads of clever features and play modes and, as always, the J-Cart multi-player option is loads of fun, though the fourway split screen doesn't work too well. Having loads of secret options and things is a great idea and the secret vehicles, once you find them, are really cool. Sadly the game just isn't as good as the Micro games, fun though it is. ED LOMAS Codemasters As you can see, the four-player split screen mode only gives you a small playing area but is still lots of fun. GRAPHICS Small but welldetailed cars and tracks. ANIMATION........70 Slightly dodgy animation on the corners. On the left we can see the start of one of our office tournaments, which Ed won, as always. SOUNDS FAMILIAR One mysterious feature is that the sound effects are almost identical to those in Micro Machines 2. Even the cars have horns. Codemasters Controls are identical too, meaning that they are as simple and intuitive as ever. (MUSIC Good Micro Machines style Rock 'n Roll stuff. SOUND EFFECTS.. 80 Pretty good, though some of the FX are from MM2. FREE RESULT GROHE GAMEPLAY SERE Fast in places but a hit slows you down too much. TGIMIM TERAZ Here we're having fun in the secret formula 1 cars. The yellow car storms ahead of the chasing pack in this action-packed shot of the beach race. Fantastic! TALE FINE VALUE. A great game with built in 4-player adapter. OVERALL TRACK RECORD The game includes over 40 tracks, rendered in 3D, spanning various locations: beach, ranch, rally and snowy mountain and once you learn them you'll soon figure out which of the 12 vehicles suits each track. The Minis, Beetles, Trucks and so on have all been rendered from 3D models making them look more realistic than other isometric racers, although occasionally the animation is a bit rough. A fun rally game let down slightly by notquite-perfect handling. Lots to keep you occupied for a long time and a cracking 4-player laugh. "

NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR Yo hip and groovy daddio, nice deck if I might say so. Let's catch some wicked air, and, er... oh sod it, let's just go play this racing game. Man. It's all very well racing your nuts off, but you'll need more than a good finishing position if you want to progress. The only way to raise more season points and earn some money is to get yourself through as many of the gates that appear along the course. What say we go have a little look see? GATE 1 The green gate is one to aim for is you're a greedy bast' simply because you get a nice \"KERCHING!\" and some dosh to play with. GATE 2 The yellow gates go towards your overall season point tally at the end of the race, so squeeze through as many of these as possible f there's one thing that's become apparent in the short time the PlayStation has been around, it's that it can shift 3D graphics like nothing else. The obvious genre to exploit this attribute is the racing game, and with the like of Destruction Derby, Cybersled, Ridge Racer, and, of course, the mighty Wipeout, we're certainly not suffering a drought on that front. ESPN (which is the name of an extreme sports TV channel in case you're wondering) differs by taking things down to a more basic level. You can choose to compete on a number of different street vehicles, including roller-blades, skateboards, bicycles, and weird 'tea-tray on wheels' affairs called Street Luges. ESPN, however, manages to combine the impressive graphics seen in other PSX racers with the more 'fun' gameplay seen in such previous titles as Skitchin' and Road Rash. It's a straight forward racing game, only with tons of violence onroute. There are a number of locations to race in, each with certain characteristics. Utah offers cliff-edge rock roads, while Italy has narrow, cobble-stoned roads to jigger your teeth out on. Just to add to the fun, there are a number of coloured gates to (attempt to) jump through as you travel along the courses, offering either season points for the league table, hard cash used to buy better equipment, or access to secret caves and short cuts. GATE 3 23 These are tricky little devils, because they're more switches than gates. Pass through these and secret doors open, stone slabs move out of your way, and wheely-bins trundle across the road in front of your opponents. KICK EM! If anyone gets in your way kick em! EDELE Paul Dillon Height 5 8 Height 150 PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE Before you start the season you need to select your character.

There's not a lot of it, but the aren't any clipping problems. MUSIC Suitable enough for this kind of action. SOUND EFFECTS. Not great. Makes you wince when you get pranged though. WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE? SECOND OPINION... PLAYSTATION ESPN only offers you a relatively small number of tracks to race over, but, when played as a season, they actually change each time you return to the same location. By your second and third visIts, all manner of extra obstacles and barriers suddenly appear. The split-screen two-player mode is another excellent feature, giving the game the edge over other racing games. Though Ridge Racer and Wipeout are far more impres. sive games than ESPN, there's really nothing to beat a good two-player challenge, and with this game you don't need link-up cables, two machines and two copies of the game SO there's value for money! PAUL DAVIES GAMEPLAY Basic enough for novices. While proplayers can show off! As the season progresses you can buy new equipment, and even change between vehicles. If you've had enough of the skate board's poor acceleration, perhaps the bicycle's more up your valley. (VALUE. Definitely one to keep handy for a rainy weekend OVERALL Original and funny with it. Hardly amazing but full of surprises, so guaranteed to impress even the most ardent anti-gamer.  VERDICT PLAYSTATION To start with, ESPN doesn't appear to be any. thing remarkable. However, once you start getting the hang of the controls, and begin to master the technique of getting the best speed pos. sible, things start to happen. First of all you start to really enjoy yourself, then you find yourself really hating the other competitors, and before you know it you're hookedl Ultimately, some people might not go for ESPN because it's a fairly basic game, but it's still damn good fun, and If you have the chance to play this as a two-player, give it a go. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. CHOOSE ROLLERBLADES TOM GUISE 43 "

"REVIEW WOLFENSTEIN 31 3D SHOOT-\"EM-UP INTERPLAY. .99. The granddad of 3D shoot-'emups coughs and splutters it's way onto 3DO. OUT NOVEMBER ONE PLAYER.. Wuerstein 30 NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED PC, MAC, SNES AND JAGUAR VERSIONS AVAILABLE et you didn't know that this game got it s name from Frankenstein's pet wolf. If you did, well you're mad because we just made it up. Weird though the name may be, it's well-known as being one of the first fully 3D games around when it appeared on the PC as shareware the early 90's. From Wolfenstein came it s devil son, Doom the fornicator which in turn was the father of what seems like millions of these \"Virtual Reality\" shooters. Wolfenstein is set in a Nazi base, which explains the Adolf Hitler memorabilia all over the walls, and the plot involves you trying to escape from a prison by shooting the guards and their pet dogs with any weapons you can pilfer. SELECT A LEOEL OF DIFFICIN TY CANCEL KNOW YOUR ENEMY Here's a selection of a few of the early baddies you can expect to meet. Regular Guard Dog Big Guard Guy in White Armed with only a The dogs are worth These guys have got They're flipping fast small brain and a killing for the brilliant machine guns and and they've got pis. smaller gun. howling noise they take quite a few hits tols. make. before they drop them. TIDDLY-OM-POM-POM FREE The music in this 3D0 version is particularly good, as it's all real orchestral stuff with REAL trombones and things. Though it's not very realistic not many people travel around dungeons with the Royal Philharmonic strapped to their back it's one of the best bits of the game. AY ARSENAL! AY ARSENAL! SCORES When you start the game you've only got a few bullets in the pistol stolen from the dead guard in front of you, as well as a little kitchen knife in your pocket. By looking around carefully you can find more guns, like a machine gun, a gatling chain gun and a rocket launcher, er, gun. GRAPHICS.....72 ANIMATION. ...... 65 MUSIC 90 VERDICT... SOUND EFFECTS.. 88 3DO GAMEPLAY... 67 VALUE....... Here's loads of ammo and guns. The chain gun deals megadeath! OVERALL Why? That's the big question. Why did they bother making it? The game looks really dated now, what with Space Hulk around and it doesn't exactly push the 3DO's processor. There's no variety in the levels at all, mainly because the restrictive and out-of-date game engine forces all of the floors and ceilings in a level to be the same height and the walls have to follow a grid system. The sound is excellent and there, are loads of levels, but the big problem is that the game's just not up to today's high standards, as good as it was. The diagonals on the 3D0 joypad don't let you walk and turn at the same time, making the game more frustrating than usual. It's slow, annoying and just plain pointless. Hurry up with Doom. Game over? Oh damn and blast. The machine gun's pretty good fun. Here's yer rubbishy pistol, provided free. ED LOMAS 46 "

"CVG REVIEW PC CD-ROM. FLIGHT SIM. DID/OCEAN. .99. OUT NOVEMEBER.. CANNON: Hey, this is no weedy pea-shooter, this is a rapid-firing machine gun that's perfect for strafing ground targets and old grannies crossing the road! 1-8 PLAYERS. NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE TFX: EF2000 is the result of NATO collaborations and months of hard work, but is Ocean's flight of fantasy destined to soar through the skies or crash and burn? DEAD EASY OR HARD AS NAILS, SIR? | ver since Flight Simulator came out yonks ago flight sim enthusiasts have had a rough deal, constantly bombarded with abuse for not liking gore-fests like Doom and generally being, dare I say it, dull. But do \"propeller heads» deserve this constant of insults? Virgin's ground-breaking Flight Unlimited boasted staggering photo-realistic graphics and suddenly it was cool to like sims. Though it offered little in the way of gameplay. TFX: EF2000 is just as well hung in terms of presentation, but it's also stacked in the gameplay department. It's got tons of missions to fly, it can be as easy or complex as you like and you get the chance to blow the crap out of everything what more could you want? TFX: EF2000 is essentially divided into three levels of complexity. At its most basic, the arcade mode, you're simply invited to burn through the skies nuking the Ruskies with wads of missiles, and it provides little in the way of a real challenge. Enter the simulator mode and things get more complicated, with realistic flight models introduced, along with crucial elements such as waypoints and weapon payloads that must be carefully considered. Finally there's the campaign mode a whopping great conflict that is best left for the expert pilot! EVEN BETTER THAN THE REAL THING Digital Image Design, creators of TFX: EF2000, worked in conjunction with British Aerospace to ensure the flight dynamics and virtually every other aspect of the Eurofighter is as accurate as possible. Experienced aeronautical engineers were consulted during development and as a result EF2000 is one of the most realistic PC flight simulators around. 'It's not just the Eurofighter that is authentically recreated either as every single aircraft in the game, from F-16s to Soviet Hind helicopters to massive AWACS, perform realistically. Don't worry if you're not a complete propeller head though, as a more simplified flight model (and weedier enemies) are accessed simply by reducing the realism level. A Having cleared the area of air resistance, the A-10s fly in low to take out the enemy ground installations. TFX: "


"REVIEW KAB00000M! ZOZOI ROCKETS: A pod filled with high-explosive rockets. They may be inaccurate but it's worth getting some of these, even if it is just for the flashy light show! BOMB: It's a bloody great bomb, right, and it blows things to little bits. Well, providing you can drop the damn thing on target, which is easier said than done. AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILE: This TV guided missile is perfect for eliminating ground threats like SAM sites and tanks. Shame you can't pick up BBC1 though. MISSILE: Naffed off with some hotshot Ruskie filling your baby with bullets? Lock on with this heat-seeking beastie and nuke the git. Pull back on the stick and fly through the clouds to enter a fluffy white wonder world. Ahh... ACTUAL REALITY (WELL, ALMOST) Fed up with flying over bland polygon triangles that are supposed to be the snow-capped Alps? Simplistic lowresolution graphics have been unceremoniously dumped, as TFX: EF2000 boasts impressive photorealistic texture. mapped landscapes complete with winding canyons, towering mountains and complex cities. Diverse flying conditions have been catered for too, and all too often you'll end up cruising through mist and even through dense clouds navigating only with the HUD and the dials in the cockpit. There are also night missions to tackle, as well as dawn and dusk raids where the terrain is faintly illuminated by the sun peeking over the horizon. ADVANCED COMPUTER CRANIUMS Unique to TFX: EF2000 is the advanced artificial intelligence system, that enables each computer controlled aircraft to act independently (and intelligently) from each other. This is immediately apparent in the wingmen that accompany you on each mission. Up to five other aircraft will fly in your wing (depending on the difficulty of the sortie), and while they capably respond to your specific orders, they'll also adapt attack strategies to suit certain situations. Therefore providing backup when it's desperately needed, or attacking the primary target if you're otherwise engaged in combat. A EF2000's sophisti cated WarGen cam-= paign generator can intelligently handle more than 3000 individual things at any one time. It can also cook, apparently The virtual cockpit allows you to track enemy fighters without straining your neck muscles. 4 MILLION KILOMETRES OF TERRAIN? NOR-WAY! DALLE It's plainly obvious that a great deal of effort has been made to ensure TFX: EF2000 is the most realistic flight simulator on the PC, and this becomes apparent when looking at the campaign theatre. It's set over Norway and Scandinavia, and stretches a massive four million kilometres square! What's more, it's based on accurate military maps and charts of the area, which means virtually every river, canyon and mountain is present in the game! EF20003 49 "


"REVIEW SCORES NEU PERFECTLY FORMED Attention to detail in EF2000 is quite literally stunning. Switch over to one of the many external views and you're treated to a gorgeous SVGA shot of your aircraft, fully laden with missiles and emblazoned with numerous military insignia. Start banking the ailerons move, slow down and the airbrake will flip up. Hell, when you kick in the afterburners they become blurred by heat haze and you can even see the reflection of the HUD on the canopy as you pan around the aircraft! Hmm, why are there three large umbilical cords hanging from that plane? H2ICA ESOPET FLIGHT UNLIMITED. FALCON 3. EF2000 A A lone Russian helicopter easy pickings for the world's most advanced combat fighter, the EuroFighter. MONSTER MACHINE ALERT! GRAPHICS TFX: 2000 sounds just brilliant, doesn't it? Well to be quite frank it is providing you've got a decent PC. We're not talking about a DX2/66 here, ideally you'll need at least a P90 to get the most from DID's masterpiece. The reason for this is because while the game will run in low-res VGA, it's pale in comparison to the considerably more detailed SVGA mode. On top of that 16Mbs of RAM is recommended, although it should run perfectly well with a meagre eight. The aircraft and texture-mapped landscapes are gorgeous! ANIMATION 902 IEEE The attention to detail is brilliant, especially in SVGA.. MUSIC. Well, it's a flight sim, isn't it no hardcore jungle techno here. AFlick to one of the numerous external views and you can even wave at yourself while you're sitting in the cockpit. SOUND EFFECTS. 84 Decent enough quality, but nothing to get too excited about. I WANNA PLAY WAR GAMEPLAY........93 Can be enjoyed by rookie pilots or flight sim veterans. VERDICT PC CD-ROM It's difficult to actually find fault with TFX: EF2000 because it is the best flight simulator on the PC. Every aspect of the game has been honed to perfection the presentation is astonishing, the hyper-defined SVGA graphics proving functional, attractive and above all realistic. TFX: EF2000 has something on offer for everyone hardcore flight sim enthusiasts will wet their pants over the authentic flight model and the advanced WarGen campaign generator, while rookie pilots will enjoy the simplicity of the arcade battles which eventually lead into the more dynamic simulator missions. If you've never flown the virtual skies then now is the perfect chance to begin. If, on the other hand, you're a veteran armchair pilot then TFX: EF 2000 will provide literally hours of dogfighting entertainment. Quite simply an essential PC purchase. ALEX SIMMONS VALUE..... .. 90 In addition to flying individual one-off missions, there's also a mammoth campaign generator to dive into. Encompassing a vast expanse of Scandinavia and Norway, you overlook the entire NATO force as the battle against Russia develops, issuing orders to aircraft squadrons and generally making sure the conflict progresses in your favour. The most unique and impressive feature of the WarGen campaign generator is its ability to intelligently control over 3000 individual air and ground-based units, including the all the enemy aircraft, tanks, ships and ground installations as well as handling any of the NATO and other friendly units you're not actually commanding yourself!!!  is a small price to pay for the best flight sim on the PC. OVERALL Realistic, comprehensive, challenging and detailed. Better than that World Dance thing... well, maybe in the multiplayer mode. EIGHT-WAY HARDCORE ACTION Playing with yourself is good fun for a while but you can't beat a bit of one-on-one action. Extensive network facilities allow up to a massive eight pilots to fly in the virtual skies simultaneously, either teaming together or dogfighting against each other. 50 "

NORISIERE WENS Not only has the worm turned, it's heading for your back door, What's more, it's t : !!!!! urely some mistake. The panel says this is a PlayStation game, yet it looks as though it ought to be an Amiga game. Well hang on just a moment, because as the old saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover or, for that matter, a game by its graphics. Worms is, quite simply, a souped-up version of an age-old classic called TANX. Here two or more players sit facing each other across a mountainous terrain, taking turns to hit the other by setting their turrets' trajectory and shot strength. You hit fire, see how close your 'educated estimate' comes, then make the alterations you think are necessary to hit your opponent. Simple. Where Worms differs, is that an incredible amount of character has been injected, with not only cute and lovable/hate-able worms plodding around, but a plethora of weapons that would put Rambo's shed to shame. You can stick with the tried and tested method outlined above if you want, but why limit yourself to just that when you have homing missiles, dynamite, cluster bombs, and even exploding sheep. Oh yes, we kid you not! LOVE WORMS. EN BX DRAGON BANJ Alas, we knew them so well. Sort of. 52 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG 100 TERM NAME: CYG PAULD CPU GOOD ENERGY: 100 CRPTAIT VORM 2 WOEN VORM 4: PRUIL D TOM G JAMIE TOM C SCORES NEXT LAST CLEAN EXIT 1471 (VERDICT PLAYSTATION I had a lot of faith in Worms before it even started loading, simply because I knew the title from the Amiga. It is, quite simply, one of the best two-player games you'll find. I realise that it hasn't got 3D graphics streaming through your retinas at 100mph, but what it does have is playability like no other. The oneplayer game has its faults, namely that the CPU is just too good to be acceptable, but if you treat this as nothing more than a training ground, you'll find the pros of the two-player head-to-head more than make up for any shortfalls. There are very few games that really thrill you, but when you get into serious rivalry, the level of pleasure to be taken from dropping a grenade on your opponent's head is second to none. I'm in love with this game, and suggest that you stop reading this now, and go and buy the game! MATT BROUGHTON BAZOOKA WARIS num 833 THYS SNARESE UTAH 2 SCOOBE 10 3D LEMMINGS. WORMS........ CANNON FODDER.. WAY ROCKET GRAPHICS WORM WARRIORS Once you start playing Worms, you realise that your main problem is deciding which weapon to use! Simplistic. Though this is necessary to do the job. IVH ANIMATION Incredibly detailed considering the size. MUSIC Nothing really to talk about here. Sparse by all accounts. TNT: Perhaps leaving a generous portion of TNT behind an unsuspecting opponent is your cup of tea? SOUND EFFECTS..79 Again, simple but effective. What more d'ya need? GAMEPLAY Absolutely superb. Pick up and play! GRENADE: Or why not just keep it nice and simple and lob a grenade at enemy worms? Certainly not a game that will ever gather dust. Great value for money. OVERALL AIRSTRIKE: Oh, but then again, that Airstrike thingie does look ever so tempting, and it does so much damage! SECOND OPINION PLAYSTATION I can feel the targets of a thousand or more angry fans trained on me as I write, but Worms, to me, is a complete turn off. While I commend the work of the programmer, and respect the fact that there are limitless ways to play this game, there has to be some players who aren't taken in by all this and I'm one of them. I resent the 'humorous' Hadoken speech samples, and get no joy whatsoever from customising my own Worm. The gameplay is way too fiddly and longwinded for the miniscule on-screen results, and stuff like the exploding sheep just isn't funny. The strange, brand of humour which seems to have evolved with the Amiga has done so out of desperation for real good games. In that market this will no doubt do very well, but I say discerning console owners should expect something a lot less hackneyed. PAUL DAVIES Hardly an eyeopener to start with, but depth of play and sheer addictiveness makes Worms a force to be reckoned with. Weapons drop! Aha! Just where we needed it too. NINJA: If you get trapped in a sticky situation, just bung out your rope and reel yourself in! WEDEX 203 53 "


"HEBEREKE'S POPOITTO SATURN PUZZLE ...... (SUS0FT. Sunsoft's puzzle game looks pretty tasty, but is this Puyo Puyo Xerox past its sell-by date? CVG takes a lick. 69 PESEREKE SENSOR CS HEHES PRESS START BUTTON OUT DECEMBER 1-2 PLAYERS TARTI NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SUPER NES VERSION AVAILABLE 6 SUS NORMA X 02 6 X 02 &x07 Since Puyo Puyo glued itself firmly to the hearts of players across the world in 1993 puzzle games have never looked back. Problem is they haven't looked forward either, and Hebereke's Popoitto is yet another side step into a popular but 'done' area of gaming. We're assuming that, reading this review, you fall into one of two categories: Either you're totally new to this kind of game, or you're familiar with the whole Puyo Puyo/ Popoon concept and want to know how this differs. Whatever the case, the basic concept in Popoitto is to direct pairs of coloured blobs so that they form rows of at least four. When this happens they disappear. If, by luck or chance, you manage to initiate a chain reaction of lines disappearing, bonus points are awarded. In a two-player competition, the bonus is that miniatures of your character fall onto their side of the screen, blocking their progress for a time. Differences are fairly minimal, and not altogether welcome at that. Similar to Tetris 2 on the Nintendo machines, the basic premise of Popoitto is to eliminate small icons that represent all the other characters in the game. Conveniently their colours match up with the full spectrum of coloured blobs Hebe (the main character) is blue, Jennifer is green, and so on. Once the intruders are gone the screen clears and its on to the next round. Of course each successive round gets progressively harder, as players struggle toward a showdown with some extraterrestrial; who apparently is to blame for this whole Popoitto thing.

Whereas Popoon, released for the Super NES, is great because players get results despite the mayhem, Popoitto is too fiddly too soon, and therefore a pain. A well considered puzzle game always gives players a way out of trouble. In Popoitto the system is such that three successive mistakes often prove fatal. Without freedom to exercise skill, even two-player competitions become tedious, as both sides are aware that they are struggling with the game rather than against each other.

"REVIEW CVG REVIEW SATURN. BEAT 'EM UP..... SEGA... EIMPORT. It was a time of heroes. It was a time of legends. It was a time when Golden Axe was the best game you could get on the Megadrive. And now, after three thousand years, Golden Axe has returned, this time on the Saturn. Tis as the bones predicted, sire! OUT NOW.. 1-2 PLAYER. NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED. NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. KAIN BLADE Known as Ax Battler in the original Golden Axe, this barbarian has obviously forgotten his name through senility. Nonetheless though, he still wields an impressive sword. Kain's is the Ryu, Ken character of the game, with dragon and fireball moves at his disposal. GODDAM Ah, Golden Axe. Who could forget that legendary name? Well, to be honest, most of you are probably too young to rememebr it. And those of you who were around at the time, are probably so ancient your brains have atrophied with age. In which case nobody remembers it. Fortunately though, we have historical information about it, as documented in the dark scrolls of the Necronomicon. So here we go. Golden Axe was a top notch scrolling beat 'em up, created back in the 1920s by leading spinning wheel manufacturers Sega. From a choice of three characters (a barbarian, a swordswoman and a dwarf), two players could stroll through a series of medieval levels, hacking, slashing and, lo, even chopping at the various heathen foes they confronted whilst journeying to destroy the evil Death Adder. And occasionally there was the option to ride atop a pink chicken-fetus for extra laughs. Ah those were the days, probably. Anyway, you can now experience the thrills of Golden Axe once more, with Golden Axe: The Duel on the Saturn. Except, you can't. Because 'The Duel' as we in the business like to refer to it, isn't a scrolling beat 'em up at all. It's been such a long time since the first game that all the characters are too decrepit and arthritic to go running about. So 'The Duel' is in fact a one-on-one beat 'em up in which the characters just stand and fight each other. Not that we have any problem with that, as long as there's plenty of Golden Axe-style slice-and-dice action. Not that we can remember what that's like, mind you. MILAN FLARE Just like Tyris Flare, her great grandmother from the original Golden Axe (probably), Milan is the fastest, but weakest character in the game. Plenty of acrobatic moves and some stunning whirlwind sword attacks make her a force to be reckoned with though. DOC This sword wielding martial artist combines a variety of kung-fu throws and lethal slashing attacks with speedy acrobatics to produce a fast, but damaging fighter. ODD0915SON DUN50D GREEN He's a slow, lumbering brute and he's green. He also has tusks growing out of his forearms, Difficult to master, but his punching and grappling moves prove deadly.

"REVIEW Oon 1550 P9 00016150 KEEL A peculiar ice demon, Keel uses his frosty powers to full effect, attacking his foes with shards of ice. He also uses two daggers for close combat. (SCORES 00001000 Hummm GILLIUS THUNDERHEAD It seems that Golden Axe's famed dwarf wasn't a dwarf at all, but in fact a stocky bearded child, because he's since grown into a seven foot tall dwarf! Gillius still uses his huge battle axe to perform a multitude of cleaving moves. He can also unleash a lethal drill attack and blast emeralds from the ground. As dwarves tend to. ZOMM Looking not unlike our CVG friend Rad, Zomm has similar powers, enabling him to turn his opponent into a frog. He can fly through the air and unleash a hundred-staffthwack with his quarterstaff. A warning to Zomm players everywhere though never underestimate the power of the frog, it can perform devastating kicks. Phneer! GA: THE DUEL. VIRTUA FIGHTER ... BATTLE MONSTERS GRAPHICS Excellent sprites and lush backdrops. Good presentation too. BRING OUT THE IMP! ANIMATION As sprite-based combat games go the frame rate is good. Fans of the original Golden Axe (if they're still alive) may remember the little imp that would release potions and food when slapped about. Well, he's back! Collect a full compliment of potions and your character can activate their magical energy. Whilst temporarily embued with magical energy, each fighter can perform some spectacular moves. MUSIC Dramatic rumbling tunes and drums that suit the game well. SOUND EFFECTS 87 DEATH ADDER Lots of screams and clunky metal noises. Just as you'd want. The dreaded boss from the original Golden Axe has decided he fancies some one-on-one fighting fun. Big, hard and wielding a mighty axe, he can also spew fire from the dragon on his shield. A fearsome fighter. GAMEPLAY NANOPRE ABC PER Responsive controls and a good range of moves. Lovely stuff. When you defeat your opponent the screen flashes white and they fall to the floor in slowmotion. Very dramatic, but not very realistic. VALUE PANOHOS PANCHOS It'll keep you happy long enough to justify the price. VERDICT OVERALL This guy obviously likes his pies. Panchos is a a slow, blubbery brute of a man, his forté being the bombs strapped around his sizeable girth. He can throw them, roll them along the floor and even stick them to his opponent with painful results. Short of the supreme excellence that is Virtua Fighter, this is the next best Saturn beat 'em up around. And a deserving next best it is too! SATURN I was a big fan of the original Golden Axe, it being the first game I bought for my Megadrive. So a Saturn sequel, albeit of the one-on-one variety, is something I've been looking forward to. And the result is mightily Impressive. The graphics are particularly good, the characters are appealing and the fighting action feels right and responds well. Peforming the special moves, especially the magic ones, is also extremely satisfying. The Duel is certainly an enjoyable, quality beat 'em up, but it's not perfect. More depth in stringing together attacks wouldn't have gone amiss, as the fighting seems somewhat simple. Golden Axe fans will definitely enjoy this, but wiser gamers might want to see how the forthcoming X-Men coin-op game fares before making a choice. JAMM Dressed in leopard skins, this animal child fights like a wild creature, clawing, loping and savaging her foes with her teeth. The fact that she can unleash an array of fireballs tends to help a bit too. TOM GUISE "

"REVIEW VERDICT BOXER SHORTS SCORES T SATURN My initial reaction was «ugh!\" Though the graphics move smoothly, there's something unrealistic about the game in that the colours are garish and the characters fight really slowly. But the amazing thing is that the game drew in nearly everyone in the office, all of them wanting to build their fighter up and become the EMAP champ. The slow pace of the game actually makes it more interesting as you have to concentrate on tactics rather than just being able to hammer the buttons and win, and as you train your boxer he gets faster anyway, making the speed, problem negligible. The great save-game feature stores all of your fighters which improves the longevity of the game massively and the varying camera, angles add interest to it. All in all, Victory Boxing is not a great game but it's still the best boxing game I've played and it's surprisingly addictive. ED LOMAS Here's a day in the life of the amazing Ed Lomas, wellknown bantam weight, from his creation in the boxer cloning chamber up to the fight against terrible Tom Cox, who's upset at a review being handed in for designing late.

"REVIEW in de la mal PC....... ID make a return of sorts before they unleash Quake on the world. They've overseen what must surely be the ultimate Doom clone... GT INTERACTIVE .99 OUT NOW........... 1-4 PLAYERS PLAYSTATION AND SATURN VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. E HEXEN Yes! There's blood everywhere... ...lots of blood, in fact. So much blood... ince iD licensed out the Doom engine to every developer who wanted it, we've been hit with a influx of clones — almost none of which are any cop. But Hexen is radically different. Gone is the standard 'A-to-B' style of singlelevel gameplay and in comes a series of massive worlds based around a central hub. These are loaded with puzzles and traps as well as the toughest enemies ever seen in a game of this type. In many ways Hexen still retains Doom's mass carnage elements, but on top of that you're now out solving puzzles, collecting potions and magic items and literally jumping out of your skin thanks to the creepy atmosphere the programmers have managed to create. The only criticism you can level at Hexen is that the levels are perhaps a little too big. You're constantly having to crisscross the world looking for new doorways, teleporters and switches and that can be a little tedious. But the rewards are there when you finally force your way into a new area only to be confronted by bigger, deadlier creatures. Like most recent PC games, Hexen has a four-player link up mode with specially designed death-match levels. Modem users will have an even better deal soon, as developers Raven are working with iD on an eight-player server version. Somehow, though, it won't be the same as playing link-up Doom. Hexen is just so much more detailed and complex it's best played on your own, in a dark room to give you plenty of opportunity to jump out of your screen as yet another swamp beast leaps up out of the mire and claws your wizard's throat out. Hexen is probably the best the PC's had all year. Even hardened Doomsters will find it tough going, despite the control system being the same. You won't find a better 3D action game until Quake comes along next year. Hexen is loaded with brilliant weapons, including magic spells (below). ...you could open a blood bank! TE mi "


"REVIEW Setting the scene SCORES 10 As well as playing well, Hexen also looks magnificent. It's loaded with special effects such as misting, light source shading and surprises such as lava flows and massive floor-destroying earthquakes. Each part of the game has its own distinctive look, so you're not just staring at scene after scene made up from the same textures. Amazingly, all that and the equivalent of 43 levels take up under 10Mb of hard drive space. A wizard's staff has a knob on the end. DARK FORCES.... HEXEN These critters turn up on every level. beta GRAPHICS92 The most detailed 3D graphics ever in a game of this kind. ANIMATION..... A little disappointing. Hasn't progressed since Doom.

For the first time in an id game you get a choice of characters. The gameplay's altered depending on which one you choose, so the warrior will get into more fights while there are plenty of health potions lying around for the physically puny wizard.

NBA: GIVE 'N GO SHOT (VERDICT SNES Though this started off seeming like a pretty good cross between NBA Jam and a more sim-like game, it just got worse the more I played it. The massive gaffs become more apparent as you get into the game and, even though there are lots of different play modes, it just becomes too annoying to want to play it for more than a few minutes at a time. Give 'N Go is not quite a sim, it's not quite an action game and it's not quite good either. If you want a serious B-ball game there are loads of options, otherwise get NBA Jam.

Quite obviously it's a basketball game, with the view set behind one of the baskets, scaling along the court with your players like Super Soccer. The added attraction is the NBA licence which, even though it's slapped on just about every basketball game these days, means that you get the real teams and players. Not that many of us limeys care.

Forget the 30 miles-per-hour a speed limit and no overtaking signs, Screamer is Virgin's super-fast racing game and there's no room for Sunday drivers! 0:55: 79 REST LAP 01:32: NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. SCREAMER 01:05: 64 LARTE 06:24:22 The past track record of Milan-based developers Graffiti is not particularly outstanding, with its decidedly mediocre debut project Iron Assault forever condemned to fiery the pits of Game Hell, hopefully never to rear its ugly head again. But now, nearly a year later, it's time to forgive and forget. After all, we all make mistakes and Graffiti has more than made up for its slip up with arguably the best, and most certainly the fastest racing game ever to grace the PC Screamer. Clearly inspired by Namco's Ridge Racer, Screamer is a straightforward drive-'til-you-drop racing sim without all the whistles and bells of the obstacle-laden tracks of Fatal Racing. There's no loops or corkscrews to negotiate here, just a load of different circuits, the other drivers and the various championship options. Take the normal game for example: In this mode you practice on any of the circuits in any of the cars, while the championship competition presents each of the tracks in turn, obviously awarding points depending on your finishing position. Then there's three special modes: Time attack essentially allows you to race against yourself, driving against the ghost of your car as it mimics the previous fastest lap. Cone Carnage and Slalom are both set against the clock, either knocking over the bollards or weaving through the coloured poles to earn precious seconds with which to complete the OD: 43:04 IRACK SELECTION Elia lap. SANDROCK Screamer also boasts a multi-player option, in which up to eight drivers compete across a network simultaneously providing you know seven other mates with access to a monster PC.

"REVIEW POSITION HAMMER GOTIA SCORES (VERDICT PC CD ROM Fatal Racing is one of the finest driving games on the PC, so I was completely shocked to discover Screamer is even better. Visually it is awesome, and is on par with Ridge Racer on the PlayStation when running in the hi-res SVGA mode. The sound is okay too, if a little sparse in places. It's the gameplay that really shines through though, and from the moment you start to play I guarantee you'll be racing until you finally clench the championship. Breath-taking stuff. AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION HULL LLULAR MAX SPEED 340 KMH GRIP ACCELERATION AND uku-nuPAUL DAVIES Do you want it or not! I'm not your mother! THE RACE IS ON Www Don't see smoke like that on any of the console racers, do ya! DAYTONNA USA. RIDGE RACER.. SCREAMER... EPHx1000 Km/h CEAR 34 GRAPHICS. The racing season breaks rookie drivers in gently, starting the championship on the simple Palm Town track. Basically circular in shape, the entire course can be taken at top speed by power sliding around the corners, so presents little challenge for experienced racers. Lindburg is tougher, with an incredibly tricky chicane to negotiate, while the long sweeping bends of Lake Valley may cause problems when driving through the snowcapped mountains of the Alps. Sunbeach Hill and Sandrock are the longest tracks in the game, mixing stretching straights with alarmingly tight corners and various roadside obstacles including cones and barriers. The most impressive circuit is Palm Town Night though, weaving through the narrow city roads lit only by the street lights that line the track, the neon signs on the buildings and the blazing headlamps of each car. Extremely fast and detailed, but you need a Pentium to run it. IT'S A BEAUTY! ANIMATION... Most roadside objects are animated. The result is stunning. 43 07 MUSIC You can hardly hear it over the screaming from your tires! Graphically Screamer is staggering. As well as being blindingly fast, it's detailed too. Smoke billows from the tires if you wheel spin, the brake lights flicker on when you skid and the whole car lurches to the side as you power slide around the corners. Even the front wheels turn! It's the actual background graphics that are most impressive though. The roadside is packed with neat little features, like animated video walls, pumping oil wells and even a fully working fairground complete with a big wheel. Helicopters hover over the track, huge planes glide through the sky Screamer's polished presentation really is unparalleled on the PC. Then there's the screen update, which is a significant improvement over that seen in the likes of Fatal Racing. Rather than distant objects 'popping' instantly into view they gradually appear, slowly growing in size as they draw closer. Smart sound effects neatly finish of the sparkling presentation, with meaty engine roars and screaming skids booming from the speakers. In fact the dodgy speech is the only aspect of the presentation at fault, but thankfully you can switch it off! SOUND EFFECTS.. 87 SPEED FREAK Whining engine revs and snippets of speech sound great. GAMEPLAY A dream to play: Easy to pick up, difficult to put down. VALUE......... POSTU 27 Screamer is incredibly fast, especially if you're lucky enough to own a ninja bast' Pentium. It's slick, it's smooth and it moves like Linford Christie on amphetamines (allegedly). What's more, it has loads of cars to race in; 12 to be precise. Each is individually rated for top speed, acceleration and handling, and either has manual or automatic transmission. The latter is more suited to the beginner, although pros usually favour the faster acceleration of a manual gearbox. In addition to the initial dozen cars, there's also a hidden racer, aptly called The Bullet. Basically it's a jet engine on wheels, and is, of course, faster than any of the other vehicles. It's handles perfectly too, but you have to prove you're a champion before you get the chance to race in it, so keep practising! For under 30 quid it's an absolute bargain.

NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE Learn to love the alien in this disappointing action adventure... One can only imagine what's going on here. The possibilities are endless. This is the bit that Dave excitingly refers to in his verdict as 'inspired by the speeder bike chase from Return of Jedi'. Read more of his thrilling opinions at the bottom of the page. ooks aren't everything, you know. Take the alien Gaan, for example, your otherworldly partner in Philips' Alien Odyssey. He may be an ugly little spud but he's got a heart of purest gold, risking life and limb to pull you from the burning wreckage of your spaceship after you crash on his homeworld. What a guy (or it may be gal you can't tell with these aliens). Of course, you now have an enormous debt of gratitude to repay, which is why you decide to aid him in his attempt to overthrow the Daks, a race of robot-like evil-doers intent of wiping out Gaan and his people. (Of course, the fact that the only way you're ever going to get home is by nicking a Dak ship is neither here nor there...) The scene, then, is set for a rollicking action adventure spread across four levels, mixing FMV shoot-'em-up bits in the Rebel Assault stylee with 3D adventuring that wouldn't look too out of place in BioForge.

OVERALL PC CD-ROM Alien Odyssey doesn't score that highly on the Originality-O-Meter the movie inspirations are blatantly obvious (sorry, did somebody just say the speeder bike chase from Return Of The Jedi?) and the gameplay is hardly inspired. Worse, some of the BioForge-y bits are unfairly tough because of the weird (some might say stupid) camera angles employed you occasionally can't react to your attackers. But Alien Odyssey's biggest fault is that, despite being fun and graphically very impressive, it's simply too short to keep hardcore gameheads happy for long. If it only had three or four more levels this would be a cracker. DAVE UPCHURCH 66 "

Every official PlayStation owner will have heard of Twisted Metal as it's one of the games previewed on the 'Demo l' disc included with each machine. So there's lots of you out there who are getting pretty excited at the prospect of driving loads of crazy vehicles around arenas packed with bonuses, as well as lots of madmen (and women) all trying to kill each other. The plot involves a mad underworld boss called Calypso who, in late 2005, creates a competition called Twisted Metal where twelve nutters of his choosing attempt to murder everyone else from the confines of their armoured vehicles. Why would anyone want to take Calypso up on this offer? Simply because he's offering absolutely ANY prize the winner wants — no matter what the cost, or consequences. LITTLE WOMEN (AND MEN) When playing you'll sometimes wonder where all of the hits are coming from, even when there are no opponents around. Here's the answer: these blooming men (and women). They hang around in the street blasting away at anything coming near to them. Mow 'em down! NOTHING SPECIAL As well as each character's special weapon, there are a few powerups which can be collected by anyone who goes over them.

A fun and fairly simple game to play with lots of speedy action. Great for the occasional blast or two-player scrap. VERDICT... PLAYSTATION Twisted Metal's a jolly enjoyable game once you get into it, but there have to be serious doubts about how long it's going to last. One-player games become repetitive after a while, though the great (and economical) two-player mode will keep you blasting for a long time to come. The problem here with the graphics is that they're slightly more glitchy than Wipeout or Assault Rigs, as the textures seem to fall off the walls if you get too close. The handling of the vehicles is pretty similar to Assault Rigs (see page 20 for the review), and the 12 characters really do differ, meaning that everyone can pick a favourite. The handling's somewhat let down by the dreadful control set up and there's not an option to well-and-truly create your own configuration. To sum up, Twisted Metal's a very good game though it looks rough compared to the other PlayStation games mentioned earlier. ED LOMAS UIT 69 "


"REVIEW The most popular game in the office at the moment is PlayStation 'WipEout.' Surely an eight-player mode can convince us the PC version is better! PC CD-ROM... RACING. PSYGNOSIS. .99 OUT NOVEMBER..... 1-8 PLAYERS. WIPEOUT NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED PLAYSTATION VERSION AVAILABLE. OO Wipeout's got it all. Incredible 3D texture-mapped graphics, a fantastic soundtrack, awesome sound effects and, to top it all, some of the best gameplay ever. It's set in the future when F3600 anti-gravity racing is all the rage. Aerodynamic hover ships whiz round custom-built tracks armed with missiles, mines, and other goodies, while blasting one another to gain points at the end of the race. The PlayStation version is hailed by many as one of the greatest games ever so, being the games-hungry monsters we are, CVG crowded around the PC to play a supposedly improved version of near-perfection. Up to now, the PC's best racing games have all been in-depth simulators such as Indycar and Nascar, but the machine has always had problems with arcade-style racing games. The machine is improving in this area massively now, as shown with the Ridge Racer-esque Screamer (reviewed on page 64) but can it compete directly with the super-consoles? The only way to find out is to see PC Wipeout running next to the PlayStation version. OO:SO Additional graphic design by I love The Designers Republic NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS un) Oressecond As with most PC games there are options enabling you to configure the graphics settings to optimise the performance of the game — in other words take all the detail off if you've got a feeble machine! We played the game mostly on a Pentium 90Mhz with 16Mb of RAM, not exactly a bad machine, and here's a brief report on how it runs. WHY? One of the graphical differences between the PC and PlayStation versions is the lighting. The PlayStation's custom hardware enables coloured light sourcing on parts of the track, which is missing from the PC version. But the biggest difference is the speed. It's not that as though the PC is incapable of smooth racing games, which is why we just don't understand why Wipeout runs so slow. Consequently this game's probably the best advert for the PlayStation around — proving that a  machine can out-perform one costing ,000. OO: Maximum Detail Minimum Detail Small Screen INTRODUCE YOURSELF The intro sequence is one part of the game not covered in the CVG PlayStation review of issue 166 so here it is in its gorgeous entirety. With all of the options turned on the game's resolution and detail are almost the same as the PlayStation version, except it runs in mega strobe-o-vision and is quite painful to watch. As a last-ditch attempt to get the game running at a decent speed, we switched to minimum detail. Quite surprisingly, though it looks like a really bad Speccy game, it still runs just as slowly! Here's the game with all of the detail still turned on but we're playing in the small screen setting. The game runs almost as badly as before, only it's like playing on a Game Gear. 03   COD recor OOD WEB 01:30 "

So I got excited. The game's really promising to begin with as there are almost no differences from the PlayStation original when you start up. All hopes of the game being as good-looking as that god-like version die a very messy death when the actual game starts and it switches to a fit-inducing jerky mode. The gameplay is pretty similar to the PS version, but it's ruined by the way that even on a ,000+ machine it runs so badly. Judging it as a PC title alone, it's pretty good. As a conversion it's pretty darned awful. ED LOMAS 71 "


"ARCADES SEGA aren't concentrating solely on Saturn this Christmas. Their native soil the arcades is set for a Sega bombardment too. And the word of the moment is MODEL 2. Yep, the hardware that revolutionised gaming with Daytona USA and Virtua Fighter 2 is now in common use, powering ALL the new Sega coin-ops. EVIDEO FIGHTING VIPERS By: AM2 Publisher: SEGA Distributed: DEITH LEISURE THE STICKS OF STONE Storyline For whatever reason, the Mayor of Arm Stone City has organised a street fighting tournament, the finals of which are to take place in City Tower. Probably this is intended to contain the city's crime problem, by channelling the youthful energy toward rewards greater than a pat on the back from a mate. JO TINC GI «Hard fighting begins now in a nook of a town! Superdreadnought fighters are battling in the enclosed ring blowing the opponent away!\" So reads Sega's press release on 'Fighting Vipers.' As you should already know from reading our JAMMA feature last month, FV is AM2's latest 3D «vs\" fighting game developed for the Model 2 board. Since then CVG has obtained exciting background knowledge on the eight Vipers, plus confirmation of its innovative features, direct from Sega of Japan! Our report previews what is expected to become another Sega arcade sensation. The coin-op is expected to strike these shores around Christmas, with a Saturn version planned for release in 1996. COCKPOT WIDE OPEN Stomping tactics restricted With Virtua Fighter, nobody wants to go against cheap opponents who jump downed fighters for points. It's okay once in a while, but over and over please no. In Fighting Vipers, however, everyone's welcome to try! Failed attempts are potentially fatal now, as the recovery time is much longer. Good news for respectable VF veterans, then. GANG WARFARE Meet the Vipers Name: Sanman Sex: Male Age: unknown Character: Mad Rider Speciality: Bodily crash REP 9 Name: Jane Sex: Female Age: 18 Character: Enthusiastic Fighter Speciality: Punch Name: Raxel Sex: Male Age: 18 Character: Battle Rocker Speciality: Kick Name: Honey Sex: Female Age: 16 Character: Fashionable girl Speciality: Upper Because he won't talk, nobody knows much about Sanman's history. He's the scariest scooter boy you've ever seen, whose only form of self expression is to fight. Obviously his size gives him the greatest advantage, with moves such as the Bodily Crash and Hip Attack powering every last stone into his hapless opponents. Spent all her time at high school building muscles, instead of good grades. All this to join the marines, only she messed that up after being booked for assault. Now she's a construction worker, aspiring to become the lead Viper. Power punches mark her style, especially the uppercut she calls the Tornado Punch. Raxel is guitarist/ vocalis with popular (?) metal outfit «Death Crunch.\" He loves nobody but himself, and feels the whole world ought to love him too. For a metal-head, Raxel has some cool moves with combinations of Deadly Spin Kicks and Sliding Kicks at the ready. Designer babe who loves to wear rubber. As an aspiring fashion designer she enjoys making all her own clothes. Aside from all that, a \"taste of Honey usually involves getting kicked all about, or being thrown to the ground from the air. Though all male Vipers are crazy for her, her heart belongs to the mysterious Nutcracker alone. 72 "


"ARCADES ARCADES CVG DROME ANRAN BARRIER GRIEF No Ring-Out Strategy Perhaps the most frustrating gameplay-element found in the Virtua Fighter series is the Ring Out. In Fighting Vipers AM2 introduce enclosures to the mix, enabling all-new strategies to develop. Rather than stumble awkwardly out of the action, Vipers instead find themselves sent to the wall. From here the guy with the upper hand has opportunity to launch specialist attacks; billed as «spectacular 'blowing away' techniques.\" Use one at the close of the final bout to power the loser right over the barrier! 2 SERVE AND PROTECT Unique Armour System The tournament is intended to be a test of agility and skill, rather than an all-out blood bath. For this reason, all eight Vipers are kitted out in some form of protective gear armour derived from whichever tribal background they represent. A wire-frame diagram, placed beside each fighter's energy bar, monitors the damage to the various body parts. Those depicted in red are damaged. Extreme force, or continuous punishment, removes sections of armour entirely leaving the fighters exposed to double damage if hit there again! OUT OF HARM'S WAY Guard Attacks and Reducing Damage Moves that are extremely effective, but harder to execute because of this, are Guard Attacks. These use an aggressor's weight to throw them off balance sending them crashing across the arena. Another 'get out' tactic involves ducking beneath an attack, again forcing a stumble.

Bahn was abandoned by his father at an early age, leaving just him and his mother to fend for themselves. Bahn would love to seek revenge, but he has no idea what his father looks like, having never set eyes on him. Tactics-wise he's similar to Jacky: powerful moves that are simple to perform. Super Straight being the easiest. A career in figure skating seemed the best option for Grace until her boyfriend, who was also her coach at the time, double crossed her. She may wear a cool expression, but inside she's an inferno! Her powerful legs are used to perform the Camel Spin Cutter, and Frankensteiner techniques. The latter being an almighty throw two-inoned from a jump in attack. The youngest Viper in Armstone City took to skateboarding in order to impress class-mate Catherine. When that didn't work for him, he turned to fighting instead! When Catherine swooned over Nutcracker it was the last straw. Picky's skateboard is good for smashing foes over the head (the 'Skateboard Slap') or tossing them into the air. Has natural dramatic flair due to his Kabuki Acting background. His troupe, «Black Thunder\", stopped touring two years ago, following the death of a team member. Now Tokio refers to himself as the lone wolf', and has turned to fighting. Tokio is very much the protagonist Viper, using his Kick Guard to mix upper, middle, and lower attacks. 73 "


"ARCADES CVG ARCADES VIDEO DROME VIRTUAL ON CYBER TROOPERS Perhaps the most inventive of Shoot-'em-up 1 per play Sega 1-2 Players Sega's new coin-ops is the peculiarly named Virtual On. Taking the idea of the one-on-one combat game to the extreme, Virtual On puts you in the pilot's seat of a giant battle robot and pits you against another robot in an obstacle-filled 3D arena. Of course, the idea of a 3D combat game is nothing new, but the way Virtual On presents it, is. With a massive playing arena to move around in, Virtual On places less emphasise on the combat, and more on 'hunting-downyour-opponent'. In fact, it feels more like you're in a Wild West shoot-out (except with huge Gundam-style warbots) than a fighting game, as you duck and weave around behind the various walls and leap up onto raised areas to blast at your foe. What really gives Virtual On an edge though, is its clever control system. The game uses two joysticks one for each side of your robot's body similar to Cyber Sled or, in fact, a tank. Push forward with both sticks and you run forward. Push both sticks left, and you side-jog left. Push forward with the left stick, and pull back with the right, and you twist right.

Officially licensed from the Indianapolis Speedway (which the beginner's course of Daytona is based on), Indy 500 brings a more realistic look to the game, with all the genuine scenery surrounding the track. The main aim of Indy 500 though, is to bring faster speeds than ever before to a racing game. Indy's low-slung racers can hit speeds of 380 km/h, using a up-shift/down-shift 6-speed gear lever for fast gear changing. The sheer speed of the game is perhaps more pronounced on the two other tracks available, one of which sends you hurtling downhill like a rollercoaster. GO As a fast-paced racer, there's no doubt that Indy 500 beats any other racing game. But for a good racing feel and multiplayer head-to-head action, it falls a tad short of Daytona and Rave Racer. Graphically too, it seems slightly rough around the edges. Still worth a go though. 977 00' 14'082 Some 74 "


"ARCADES V.C.P.D VIRTUA COP 2 Law enforcer 150p per play 1 Sega I 1-2 Player PALICE AM2's, long awaited sequel to the coin-op that revolutionised gun games, is finally complete. Following the formula of the first game, Virtua Cop 2 has three different stages. Level One taking you on a car chase through the streets of Virtua City, level two putting you on a luxury cruise liner and level three giving you a French Connection-style subway train pursuit, as you gun down multitudes of shades-wearing hoods. Unlike previous AM2 updates though (VF2 over VF1 for example, there's not a great deal of difference between VC2 and VC1. The levels are supposedly ten times larger than in Virtua Cop, however for the most part this seems to be just a case of repeated graphics identical looking cabins in the liner and identical underground stations for instance. The only real innovation is the option to go along two different routes on each level. Basically, VC2 is just a replacement for its predecessor, providing much the same thrills. And for those reasons, it's hard to reseaving it. Obviously though, AM2 are emain efforts on the upcoming 3/5 nen much more manoeuvrability. Pull the sticks apart and you leap up. Push either of the fire buttons and you shoot from either arm. Push them both and you unleash your chosen robot's special attack which could range from a spray of missiles to an incredible light-sabre assault, depending on which of the many different robots you picked. As entertaining as a series of one-player fights are, Virtual On just like Wing Arms and Cyber Sled thrives on two-player duels. As such, it comes in a two-player cabinet as standard. Unlike previous semidetached cabinets though, the two-sides are seperated by tinted glass, preventing players from seeing where their opponent is. Sneaky tactics are what this game is all about. Virtual On is an excellently entertaining coin-op. Brilliantly animated robot graphics, awesome weaponary and tactical gameplay add up to make it an essential two-player experience. 4/5 Aerial combat 1 per play Sega | 1 Player SKY TARGET 0347 DET ER HIT 004 might be forever churning out newer, flashier arcade games, they obviously haven't forgotten the rich arcade heritage that got them where they are today. As AM1's Sky Target clearly demonstrates based as it is, on Sega's legendary After Burner. Sky Target is however, more than just a nostalgia piece. It's a chance to take a classic shoot 'em up formula and, using the power of the Model 2 board, turn it into a state-of-the-art aerial warfare experience. And in many ways, it succeeds. Sky Target's graphics are brilliant. Using the texture-mapped polygons that are the Model 2's forté, the screen is always filled with masses of fighters, choppers, tanks and stealth bombers as you pilot your chosen fighter over jungles, through canyons, over the sea and even directly down through layers of cloud. Most impressive of all though, are the bosses, each of which are more than ten times the size of your fighter. Huge planes, giant 'copters and even a massive space rocket that you chase up into space, they are easily the most spectacular events of each stage. Sky Target is certainly a fun game, but its problem is that, for all its flashy graphics it provides little more thrills than the original Afterburner. The actual gameplay is virtually identical. Set on a fixed course, you steer your plane around the screen, firing off missiles and emptying your machine gun at everything in sight. In an age of realtime 3D graphics, this lack of freedom, especially in a flying game, takes the edge off the action somewhat. Worth a go, but not worth investing time and money mastering. 2/5 75 "


"CVG PREVIEW DONKEY KONG 2 SUPER NES PLATFORM... RARE DIDDY'S KONG QUEST ETBA OUT EARLY DEC (1-2 PLAYERS. NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE Remember last Christmas when you spent hours playing Donkey Kong Country trying to reclaim the banana horde from the evil King K Rool? Remember how, at the end of the game, you fought hard to kick his thieving behind once and for all? Well, forget it all ever happened he was just playing dead. ruth of the matter is that K Rool was biding his time, waiting for an opportune moment to kidnap Donkey Kong, hold him to ransom, and ensure that the banana horde stay within his grasp forever. In short, this sequel to DKC has the same old storyline as last year. But why let a small thing like that get in the way of a good old platform romp. Especially when developers Rare are boasting a stack of new features, characters and play enhancements. Via our unique industry contacts and no small amount of spawn, we have been able to secure the UK's first proper look at this exciting new 32meg cart. Here it is then, hold on to your eyes. KONG-PADRES Other familiar faces are dotted throughout the game too. Cranky is in there, in his new role as curator of the Monkey Museum, dispensing his unique brand of advice whether it's wanted or not. Cranky's wife, Wrinkly, puts in several appearances too. Players visit Wrinkly instead of the voluptuous Candy Kong when they want to save their games. Elsewhere Funky is found chartering planes to fly the unfriendly skies, and another new ape — Swanky Kong makes his debut. Players meet Swanky in bizarre gameshow sections where they gamble hard-earned coins to win special bonus items. With his Bob Monkhouse mannerisms, Swanky succeeds in being even more annoying than Funky! MONKEY SEE, MONKEY NEW It isn't fair to say that Diddy's Kong Quest is just \"all the bits they couldn't squeeze into DKC\". Firstly it seems Rare have listened to their critics and upped the game's difficulty, ensuring a proper workout for even the most hardened platform fan. Secondly there's much more variety in the actual gameplay. True enough, certain levels see the chimps negotiating underwater sections, jumping into barrels and, yes, there are a few mine-cart-esque bits too. But these are all executed with such brilliance. For instance, the mine-cart sections are actually Roller Coasters, having the Kong Kids leaping for their lives in order to open doors blocking the way, collecting valuable timer bonuses and even fleeing a hideous, sword-wielding Kremling ghost. Other new sections in the game involve the chimps riding steamy thermals atop hot air balloons, climbing honeycovered walls in an oversized Hornet's nest, and entering a thorny maze-crazed race against an evil Parrot! And those are only the ones we're telling you about! Good evening, m 5.uank and you're tonight ntestants on ray Donanza! g Quare and youre Tendu Good luck.

"PREVIEW W U RTI IN D IVIC With Donkey Kong somewhat bereft of his liberty, it falls to young Diddy to do the rescuing. But no chimp does it all alone, and Diddy has enlisted the help of several new companions to aid him in his quest. First and foremost is Dixie Diddy's girlfriend (though they're just 'friends' according to the US game manual). Dixie has several new abilities, mainly involving her lustrous blond locks. With her prehensile ponytail she picks up barrels to hurl at her enemies, and may slow her fall from high platforms by whirling it helicopter-style. Elsewhere in the game Diddy and Dixie encounter other new and useful friends as well as a couple of old ones. Rambi, Enguarde and Squawks make a welcome return. New faces include Rattly, a spring-tailed snake; Squitter, the webslinging spider; and Clapper a cute seal with a surprisingly versatile spit. ! TOLL ERETURN TO GLOOMY GOLCH DE BER FUNNY MONEY Completing Donkey Kong Country was a matter of locating every single last level, every bonus room the lot. The same is true here, but Rare have added a series of Lost Levels for players to locate and explore too. There are five in total, each one accessed after first locating a golden Kremcoin from one of the many hidden bonus rooms. Diddy uses these scarce coins to pay off Klubba a huge Kremling who stands guard at a toll bridge — in order to enter the Lost Level. Gamers skilled enough to complete all Lost Levels and defeat K Rool get an extra-special ending. It's the same story as last Christmas, insofar as Super NES owners are concerned. Several, highly brilliant games all vying for top position in the sales charts. After much careful deliberation, we're putting our money on the Monkeys. Find out why next month. "


"CVG HELP 3DO RANT Thru Traffic Thru Tralfic Dear CVG, KLANDINNI 110 RUNGO WHO HELP! 1. How much will the M2 add-on for the 3DO cost and when will it be available? CVG: As a standalone machine, probably somewhere in the region of around . The add-on for the original machines will probably be about . It should be available in very early '96. 2. Is the M2 actually worth buying? CVG: It sure sounds good on paper and the demos that we've seen are very promising but we can't really say yes or no until we've seen the finished article. 3. Will a beat-'em-up like Virtua Fighter or Toh Shin Den ever be released on 3DO? CVG: No news as yet, but a couple of EIJI the M2 demos that we've seen revolved around a beat-'em-up scenario. Let's hope they sort out an alternative to that clumsy pad though, can you imagine playing Virtua Fighter on it! 4. The Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation and Ultra 64 seem to get more attention than the 3DO, will this ever change? CVG: The thing is, the other machines you've all mentioned are all newer than the 3DO and therefore people are more interested in hearing about them. And if you remember, the 3DO received an incredible amount of coverage when it was first released in the States a couple of years back, most of which was very favourable especially when compared to the coverage that the Jaguar was getting. 5. What are the best games to buy for the 3DO? CVG: You won't go wrong with Return Fire, Cannon Fodder, Theme Park, FIFA and The Need for Speed. Thomas Adams, North Yorkshire WISE UP Dear CVG, Word up once again Help! beiievers, CVG is on hand to solve all your techy type probs or games related missives. Whatever's bugging you slap it down on pulped tree matter or fire it down the Net at the addresses listed elsewhere on these pages and we'll sort it out quicker than you can say 'defrag my hardrive.' Having only started reading your brill mag at ish 165 I'm not too clued up, so could you please answer my questions? Cheers. -400 1. I am hoping to obtain a PlayStation soon but I am not sure which game to get with it. Can you please help? CVG: Yes, the game you'll be wanting is Wipeout, by far the best game on the PlayStation at present. 2. Which game has better graphics out of Toh O-OS.2 Shin Den and Tekken and which is the best game overall? CVG: Hmm... tricky one this. Personally speaking we prefer Toh Shin Den's graphics but I feel that Tekken is the stronger game. Basically Toh Shin Den is more suited to those who wouldn't normally buy beat-'em-ups, while Tekken is ideal for the fighting game purist. 00:58. 3. Are either Ridge Racer or Tekken arcade perfect? CVG: Ridge Racer is arguably better than the arcade game as it has more features and Tekken is very, very close. Indeed some of the arcade hardware is based on proprietary PlayStation hardware, Thanks, Paul Harper, Avon. 78 "


"HELP CVG PSX 2 PC-CD? RF-ING NUISANCE Dear CVG Dear CVG. I think your mag is cool and because you are such wonderful people can you please answer these questions: I am looking forward to receiving my PlayStation but will feel slightly disappointed as I'll have to play it through an RF lead. Surely Sony could have produced a SCART lead in time for launch or even supplied one in the pack? Also do you know if a Japanese or US SCART lead will be compatible with a UK version? CVG: The reason the PlayStation is supplied with an RF lead is so that everyone can use the machine straight away on a standard TV. Yes, you should be able to use a US or Jap PlayStation SCART cable on a UK machine and vice versa. Andrew Nicoll, Worcs. 1. In June's issue you said Tekken was coming out for the PC CD-ROM. Is this true and if so when is it coming out? CVG: No more concrete news yet but Ridge Racer's on the way, just to whet your appetite. 2. Are the brilliant PlayStation games Destruction Derby and Wipeout coming out on CDROM? CVG: Wipeout is definitely on the way and nearly finished and Destruction Derby is reviewed this month. 3. Do you think that International Superstar Soccer on the SNES is better than FIFA on Mega Drive, as I don't think ISS is that good? CVG: You are mad! ISS is simply the best football game ever created on any format and poops on FIFA. It has much better graphics and sound than FIFA and a wonderfully responsive control system compared to the isometric half computer controlled system featured in FIFA. 4. I think that MK3 on the PlayStation, Saturn and Ultra 64 should be a 3D Virtua Fighter type game. What do you think? CVG: It's a good point, perhaps the developers will consider it for number four in the series... However, as it stands MK3 is the definitive side-on 2D beat-'em-up. 5. There is one thing I hate about all of the FIFA games and that is that the names of all the players are made up. Why don't they put an option like in Sensible Soccer which allows you to change the players names yourselves? CVG: Good point and to be honest I don't know why they don't include that option either. The reason they don't include the real names of players and clubs is that generally speaking these days you have to pay big cash to incorporate them into games. I'm not sure how Sensible have managed to skirt round this point for the last three years or so! 6. Will Namco's Alpine Racer and Rave Racer be converted to the PlayStation? 03-535 CVG: Not sure about Alpine Racer as it's very much a novelty, Ogre site-based ride. However Ridge Racer Revolution is available in Japan this Christmas. 7. How come all the next gen magazines apart from yours cost over ? CVG: Because they're expensive. na 44 05/12 -799 3 AJTE Emnih John Povey, Essex MYSTERIOUS QUESTION 7 Dear CVG, | HELP Please can you answer a few of my questions: 1. Is the Virtual Boy worth buying? CVG: Not at the moment. It hasn't gone down very well in Japan, or the USA, so there's no plans to release it in the UK at present. 2. What will be the average price of games be for the Ultra 64? CVG: It's not confirmed, but they are likely to cost more than PlayStation and Saturn titles simply because of the storage medium involved. 3. Is there ever going to be a Streetfighter 3? CVG: Yes Capcom are depending on it! 4. What is the latest news on the Ultra 64 release date? CVG: It's still scheduled for a late Nov/early Dec release in Japan and Easter 96 launch in the UK. 5. Is your magazine great or what? CVG: Yes, and it's about to get much better! 6. Is the Sony PlayStation worth buying? CVG: Oh my goodness gracious yes. 7. NBA JAM! (SNES) CVG: BAZOOKA!

Great, we've never seen one of them before! firestorm thunderhawk 2 Aren't these explosions brill? Look at the way that boat's gone up! The original Thunderhawk on Mega-CD wasn't just any old 3D shoot-'em-up, it was one of the first available and is still one of the best Mega-CD games around. The game had you flying a wellarmed chopper around various locations, stopping drug dealers, arms smugglers and terrorists whilst dodging trees and the like. After what seems like ages, we're finally getting close to the release of it's sequel which, unsurprisingly, sees you shooting more bad guys in your now even more powerful chopper. As you'd expect, the extra power of the new machines means that the game features more advanced 3D tricks than before, with the big addition of contoured landscapes (hills) as well as more views from which to choose AND you can spin your virtual head through 180 degrees to get a better idea of where enemies are. Seeing as it's now 1999 your possible arsenal contains a chain gun, rockets, homing missiles, runway craterers, depth charges, a variety of bombs and more. Another area that's better than ever are the explosions. Like Core's other forthcoming, shooter 'Shellshock' the tanks and things don't just pop, they blow up all over the place! Bits of metal fly around and bounce with plumes of black smoke going everywhere. Brill! It's this wonderfully violent gameplay that made Thunderhawk so much fun and as you can already chase some poor bloke from his tank, get a lock on him and laugh as your homing missile zooms off, you're definitely in for mass destruction. At the moment, the game's a long way from being finished with only one mission completed but already it's looking great. When the game's released it'll have nine campaigns with around four missions each; ranging from South America to Eastern Europe, meaning that like the Mega-CD original, you won't finish it in a hurry. We're all big fans of Thunderhawk and as such are really looking forward to the November release of Firestorm as you should be. RE 80 "

Whether you were impressed, disappointed or whatever with the early games like Virtua Fighter and Daytona doesn't really come into the equation, because the second generation of Saturn titles are simply amazing. Over the next eight pages CVG reveals the latest development versions of Sega's BIG THREE, plus we take a good hard stare at a few of their other potential blockbusters. And bear Wedna in mind, for some of these titles the review is only one month away!

That was until a rolling demo was displayed at the September ECTS, setting hearts palpitating with its incredible animation. Now however, the pace has upped dramatically as a playable 60% complete version has arrived on these shores. And we've played it. We've played it, you hear! To be honest, there's never been any doubt that Virtua Fighter 2 is going to deliver the playability of the coin-op when it arrives in the very near future. Nonetheless, we can confirm that the Saturn conversion of VF2 is going to be everything you've hoped for. The version we've seen had all the characters, fully playable, with all their moves in place. And, short of some bug testing to iron out some of the collision detection bugs still in there, the gameplay is shaping up fantastically. It's all the more amazing because of the speed the game runs at. Far faster than the original Virtua Fighter, AM2 have managed to keep the frame rate at a staggering 60 frames-a-second, matcing the coin-op and basically running PLAVER SELECT 82 "


"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG O SEGA SAT 1891 PLAYER SELECT FIRST LOOK VF2 DURAL! as smoothly as a TV can handle. What still needs to be worked on however, are the visuals. Although the fighters are near enough complete, there are still some finer touches that need to be added. Believe it or not, AM2 have a team of programmers working on just getting the fighters' fingers moving. Also, as yet, none of the characters are lightsourced. However, it seems likely this effect won't be included if it slows down the action. Requiring somewhat more work are the backdrops. With most of the polygon count spent on the fighters, AM2 have cleverly simulated the coin-op backdrops using multiple layers of 2D parallax. However, some details are still absent. Most notably, the massive bridge on Shun's raft level. Whether this actually makes it into the conversion is still a point of speculation. There is however, a gaping hole in the scenery that a bridge would fill nicely One thing we don't have to worry about though, are flickery graphics the likes of which we saw in the original VF. Thanks to the work of AM2's custom-built SGL operating system, the problem is non-existent. Although we've only played a 60% complete version of Virtua Fighter 2, the Japanese press have now bore witness to a 70% version, complete with full replay angles (which were missing from the version we saw) and featuring the first look at Saturn VF2 Dural. The silver robot boss looks amazing, with its metallictextured surface proving far more convincing than VF Remix's 'grey plastercine' attempt. Most exciting of all though, a Japanese street date for Virtua Fighter 2 has finally been set for December 1st. This means we could well see a UK version of the game pre-Christmas. We can, but hope.

December 707 complete No other versions planned Arcade version available SATURN 14/15 VAGIU 2016\" af EIRE t's only been a few months since the first pictures of Saturn Sega Rally were revealed and already we have an 70% complete version of the game to look at. Don't make the mistake of thinking Sega are churning out a rush-job though. Sega Rally looks set to be THE most impressive Saturn game yet! Converting what has to be the most realistic arcade racer around, from the Model 2 coin-op to the Saturn, was never going to be an easy task, as the Saturn version of Daytona USA has already proven. Saturn Sega Rally however, suffers from none of the troublesome scenery glitching that so marred its AM2 predecessor. In fact, the translation of Sega Rally features possibly the best distance updating of any home console driving game so far. And all running at 30 frames a second exactly the same as the original coin-op. All the more amazing when you consider that Sega Rally doesn't use the famed Sega Graphics Library that's behind the Saturn conversions of VF2 and Virtua Cop. Sega of Japan's in-house CS Team, supervised by the coin-op's original creators , AM3, have grafted the conversion purely off their own backs, rather than crediting their results to the AM2-developed SGL. It's not just the frame rate that's arcade perfect either. Saturn Sega Rally contains EVERY detail of its arcade parent. Both cars, all four courses, all the trackside details, all the speech and sound-effects, the complete coin-op attract sequence, even the flock of birds that take to the air on the first track it's all there! Plus the handling of the car -with its unique four-wheel-drive power-sliding has been fine-tuned to match the arcade. In fact, we found during an extensive test drive, that it even responds well to the Arcade Racer steering wheel. Something Daytona USA failed to do. More than just a straight arcade conversion, Sega Rally features a number of Saturn-unique features to increase its longevity. In fact, AM3 specifically chose the CS Team for the job, having already shown their expertise in this area with the brilliant Megadrive Virtua Racing and 32X VR Deluxe. As you'd expect, Saturn Sega Rally has the now-customary Time Attack option. It also has a rather nifty Fine Tuning feature allowing you to adjust the tyres, transmission, handling and suspension of the cars, saving up to three different versions of them for later use. Plus, there are yet more unrevealed 'extra features' promised should you complete the final Super Advanced track in first place.

However, the technology for the cable just isn't ready yet. Not to worry though, the splitscreen option works excellently.

However, if you're expecting the crossSort of arcade version available continental road racing formula of the old Hang > On coin-op you may be surprised, because as SATURN the GP tag suggests, Hang On GP '95 is a circuit-based racing game of the Daytona USA mould. Racing against 20 other motorcycles on a choice of five indivdually-graded bikes, there are three different environments to test your mettle in. Albatross Cliff Reef puts you on a set of winding clifftop roads, New Dwells provides a tighter urban setting and Crimson Walls races you through the countryside. Similar to Ridge Racer though, each area provides more than just one course by opening up new parts of each track. As you can see from the track select screens on this page. It's not just the gaming formula that's changed either. The juddering sprite scenery of the coin-op is just a distant memory, as Hang On GP makes full use of the Saturn's texture-mapped polygon capabilities to generate the mightily impressive 3D graphics. Sega don't seem to be making too big a fuss about Hang On GP, concentrating their marketing on the bigger Sega Rally. However, having playtested an early version of the game, we've got high hopes for this speedy racer. Already released in Japan, we'll give you a full review next month.

"PREVIEW SATURN GAME INVASION GUARDIAN HEROES Developed by: ...TREASURE Released by:.............SEGA Out .................Unconfirmed 70% complete No other versions planned No other versions available SATURN M2 might be the golden boys on the Saturn right now, but not so long ago, in the days of the Megadrive, it was Treasure who were THE top team with incredible titles such as Gunstar Heroes and Dynamite Headdy. Well, now the old masters have turned their attention to the Saturn and their first title looks stunning. It's surely no coincidence that Guardian Heroes is so similar a name to Gunstar Heroes, as the game adopts the same scrolling action formula. However, rather than going for the futuristic shoot 'em up theme of Gunstar, Guardian Heroes is steeped more in the realms of sword and sorcery. Choosing from a variety of characters, each with their own special abilities, you can pull off some fantastical attacks -Street Fighter-style. Or even cast pyrotechnically awesome spells. Coming from the Treasure stables, Guardian Heroes is guaranteed to feature plenty of over-the-top battle action. And that's reinforced by the fact that Treasure are including a six-player all-against-all fight option. Plus, the unique graphical flavour of all Treasure games promises to be better than ever, with a brilliant cartoon intro starting the whole game off. Incredibly, Sega Europe have yet to confirm that Guardian Heroes will be coming out over here. Nonetheless, we're confident of an official release SOON! SATURN GAME Developed by: Sega in-house Released by: ........... SEGA Out...........Now (import] 80% complete No other versions planned No other versions available SATURN PTIME SPLITT TI 41 Jextured, polygon driving games are ten-a-penny on the new wave of consoles at the moment. However, Sega's F1 game promises to be something a bit different. As the name suggests, F1 is actually licensed from the Formula One World Championship, meaning you can race as Michael Schumacher, Damon Hill or a varriety of other famous drivers, in their actual F1 cars. Complete with official texture-mapped sponsorship on the sides. There are six tracks to race on. Three Sega Stadium courses, Germany's Hockenheim, Japan's Suzuka and in a tip of the hat to Sega's old coin-op Monaco. Clearly designed to cater for hardcore F1 fans, Live Transmission allows you to fine tune each of the cars, adjusting everything to precise degrees. If you're wondering about the 'Live Transmission' tag. In Japan the game is accompanied by a complete commentary which amazingly fits the action in the display at the top of the screen. Just like on TV, it switches views, homing in on any crashes. And if you spin off, it even cuts to an in-car cam view or replays, with the commentator wildly jabbering on about your accident Of course, all the Japanese speech is no good for the UK version and sadly Sega Europe are going to replace it all with extra music. Nonetheless, from our early playtesting we reckon F1 could be a sleeper hit for the Saturn. Full review next month, hopefully. 89 "


"PREVIEW DOOM Developed by: ......WILLIAMS Released by: GT Interactive RECURRING NIGHTMARES More levels than Hades! PlayStation Doom includes more levels than even the Jaguar version, what with the whole of the Ultimate Doom (36 levels) as well as its sequel Doom 2: Hell on Earth (32 levels). These aren't your feeble 'over-in-20seconds' examples either, and the PlayStation game is made all the more difficult because at the moment you can't save your game during a level. Instead you have to complete it to get a password. Also, as this disc contains Doom 2, it has all the new monsters such as the Revenant and Arch-Vile. Plus there's the new power-ups: Megasphere and the nefarious double-barrelled shotgun. Out .................DEC 95 90% complete When you've only got 1% health, 0% armour and a pistol, it helps if you can get the baddies to fight each other. No other versions planned Lots of versions available PLAYSTATION C The chaingun's a good weapon to use on the Cacodemons but we reckon that the chainsaw's better. It makes them turn away and stay still while you hack. DU Doom service, how can we help? Yes we have a Super NES version. No, sir, no Game Boy at present. P-P-Play S-Station you say? W-well we really don't advise you even mention that one becau:ack argle... AAAGH...! 002. AMMO C purists are no doubt laughing at the PlayStation owner's current predicament: \"Oh ho! How nice. Their own little version of Doom. Ptcha! We're onto Hexen now you sad motherf...' Because that's how many PC Doom players like to speak. Don't write this off as old news just yet, however. Play Station Doom is — and this comes straight from id's mouth \"one of those games you've got to see to believe.\" Developers Williams have added two new secret levels, taken it upon themselves to provide all-new sound effects and music, and used a whole bunch of other tricks the PlayStation alone can achieve. The only review that counts is due next month. Meantime, get your magnifying glass out to examine these screen shots. Does it match up to all expectations? 90 "


"PREVIEW The screen flashes red when you're silly enough to get hit. DIMAS In a greenily-lit room, the BFG blast looks yellow. AMMO HEALTH The level on the right Tricks and Traps is a real git to complete because of all the Barons of Hell. AMMO HEAL ARMOR If you look to your right, you'll see two Hell Knights being killed by exploding barrels. I'm dying too, DOOMED? In answer to those cynics who are already writing this version off as a waste of time, Doom is most definitely NOT dead! It's undead! Bwa-ha-ha! I APPO01 SELASA ARMOR Get the invincibility before taking on loads of Barons. SHINE ON PlayStation extra-special effects! The most obvious difference the custom processing power of the PlayStation has enabled, are the snazzy lighting effects; where coloured lighting taints any items nearby. For example, red or blue flame sticks now emit red or blue light into the surrounding area, adding much more atmosphere. "


"CVG TIPS GAME BOY NINTENDO SOCCER Living life on the fast lane, on the edge and so darn quick that you just must get to round 16 of this game straightaway? Then try entering this complex little code (if you can find the time!): 2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Once you've worn your eyeballs out entering that little lot press button B every time Brazil play at home and if all goes well you should take over the match. SNES You'll notice that Tips this month are still very much dominated by 16-bit stuff and pretty poor it is too. As to how soon this changes for the better is very much up to you. Having your skills lauded in CVG is about the highest accolade a gamesplayer could wish for, which is every reason to get working on some hot Saturn, PlayStation, PC CD-ROM releases as soon as possible! Send your hard-earned efforts to: Help! Computer and Video Games, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU PITFALL: THE MAYAN ADVENTURE Access a level select cheat on this competent reworking of the old Atari 2600 classic by simply pressing X, SELECT, A, SELECT, Y, A, X and SELECT on the title screen. Now you should find that by pressing the Land R buttons together you can skip through the levels. Hurrah! to Ben Sutton from Cornwall for writing to us with that cheat. PLAYSTATION JUMPING FLASH Do you want a level select for this brilliant 3D twist on the platform theme? Then we reckon you must be a bit crap at games 'cos it has to be said that while Jumping Flash is great fun while it lasts it doesn't last long. At the title screen press UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, X, X, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, X TRIANGLE, X, and finally TRIANGLE again. That level select should now be accessible if you've entered that little lot correctly. By the way, if you hold down all four shoulder pads on the controller while on the title screen and press up or down it's possible to make the clouds move at different speeds. Pointless but fun. Or maybe not. MEGA DRIVE STREET RACER Topper racer fun ahoy with this smart reworking of the SNES classic Super Mario Kart. And Katie North is here to make the game even better by supplying this cheat that will allow you to edit the abilities of all the characters. If you want to do just that then go to the character select screen and press A, B, C, A, B, C, A and B. Do it right and you'll hear a cheer. O Do it wrong and you won't!

"TIPS TIPS CVG I MEGA DRIVE MEGA CD X-MEN 2: THE CLONE WARS If you start a game as normal and then press START to pause it you should find that by pressing DOWN and RIGHT simultaneously and then UP, LEFT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT and C that you'll be blessed with 99 lives instead of the more regular eight. Back slaps to Ross McDowell from Humbersome for that. MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS You can make this game slightly less crap by skipping the fighting sequences. To do just that, go to the difficulty select screen and press B, A, C, C, A, B and A. Now start a game as normal and you'll be able to skip the fight sequences simply by tapping the start button. Alternatively rub your 'nads with some brand new extra rough sandpaper as it's about as enjoyable as playing this game. AMIGA SNES SUPER BOMBERMAN 2 Here's a cheat that's a perfect example of the old cliche, brilliantly simple but simply brilliant. In fact that's a perfect description of the game too, come to think about it. Anyway, go to the title screen, select PASSWORD and enter 1111 as the code. Doing so will enable you 600 to drop six bombs with the maximum blast radius as well as use the detonator. SENSIBLE WORLD OF SOCCER This could well be the last in a seemingly never ending supply of brilliant SWOS cheats but it's certainly one to go out on a bang with! Basically what you have to do is start a new game, wait for the kick-off to start, pull back on the joystick to initiate a whopping great kick and press and hold fire. Now, while still holding fire press the R button for a replay. This will freeze all of the players including the all important goalie until you let go of the fire button. Once you've done this the ball should bounce straight into the back of the poor old defenceless net. Note that it might take a few attempts to get this process right but it definitely works. BUT, don't try it on a muddy pitch because the mud is likely to stop the ball dead in its tracks and give the goalie enough time to recover and snatch the ball back. Cheers to Damon Wellington from Kingsley for contributing. Se 32 D REA6 ZENA MEGA DIVE 32X COSMIC CARNAGE No, we afraid to say that we haven't got any cheats that will somehow manage to turn this rotting hedgehog of a game into a Sonic-stylee classic, but it might just make you feel a little less sick if you were unfortunate enough to buy the game in the first place. When the produced by SEGA logo comes on as normal upon booting the game up, press and keep held buttons X, B and Z. When PRESS START appears, press it and then let go of all buttons. If all's gone according to plan you find find that you've entered a new mode called the Cyber Brawl which offers up for your delight a couple of new features and the like.
