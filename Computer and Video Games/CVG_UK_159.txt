Let's hope First shots of PlayStation newies R:EAL that the announcement Wireless 3DO wondergizmo of 3D02 reverses While games industry pundits put Trip Hawkins' 3D0 behind in the race for dominance of the 32-bit market, according to news reports from The Daily Yomuri, which is the Tokyo equivalent of The Daily Mail, Panasonic's parent company. Matsushita, has unveiled plans which, if they prove to be successful, will transform the 3DO into the most powerful home machine around. A few months ago we brought you news on the 3D02. codenamed Bulldog. Well it now seems that Matsushita already has development versions of a 64-bit Power PCbased 3D0 running at 66Mhz. This makes it, on paper at least, more powerful than Sega's new Saturn and Sony's PlayStation (see pages 13 to 36 on the new machines) combined and it's rumoured to be coming out for only  more. It's strange that this development should be happening in Japan rather than America where the 3D0 machine originated. It seems as though Matsushita has decided that Sony's forecasts look good and realise that they can also carve out a large chunk of the home entertainment market for themselves. Additionally this new machine will also be cable-ready, so it's capable of running interactive TV services a first for a home machine. Hey, games are great it's official! the trend.... "


"NEWS CVG Connected BARNET PHARAOH Seal of the Pharaoh is a first-person view adventure game set, unsurprisingly, in the pyramids of Egypt, is on its way from Panasonic. The graphics, as you can see, look very nice indeed, even if they are a bit yellow (as sandstone is). That said this is destined to be an eye-catching high-profile title for the 3DO, so keep reading CVG for more info. THUMBSAVING FUN If you own a 3DO you may have realised that no matter how good the game the joypads always leave something to be desired. Well wave goodbye to that scabby thumb with Nakitek's new creation a wireless 3D0 pad with a (supposedly) more comfortable and responsive feel. The pads are compatible with any make of 3D0 (even the ones which aren't out yet) and have all the slowmo/turbo buttons you'd expect these days. Nakitek pads should hit these shores early next year for about -40 for two controllers and a receiver, so they're cheap too. Jaw blimey, up the apple and pears, I'm in a flickin' pyramid I am. 3DO JOYPAD BREAKTHROUGH FUN WITH YOUR JOCKIES And don't forget to buy some batteries. These things always take loads. If Nakitek's joypads (see story above right) don't sound like your sort of thing perhaps the forthcoming WIT Adaptor is more up your street. This allows you to use any Super NES joypad on your console. Given the range of Super NES controllers out there this sounds like quite a good idea. The adaptor also features a second joypad port to replace the annoying one on the bottom of standard 3DO pads. Release dates over here are shakey as yet, but try ringing importers for American versions which are already available. DWAY Aclaim Are you very short? Fiddle your taxes? No? Well, even if none of these apply to you the joys of jockeying are still within your grasp. Koei is hard at work on Winning Post a horse racing/breeding sim for the 3DO.

"NEWS CVG Connected KILL PLAYSTATION SOFTWARE SPESH MANY PEOPLE ALTIE Fans of wars will soon be able to 'liberate lots of oil fields on their 3D0s. Return Fire is the name of the game, and it's a combat simulation set in the Middle East. You're given a fourunit task force with which to claim a flag hidden somewhere in the play area. Apart from the fact it features lots of fighting that's all we know about it at the moment, but rest assured that when we know something else we'll tell you. ITEM A number of new PlayStation titles have reached our attention, although details are scant at present. The games are all destined for a release next spring and include Space Griffon VF-9. a Doom-type game set on a space station and featuring lots of robot-blasting fun and a simultaneous two-player mode. The others are a Raidenesque top-down shoot-'em-up with an unpronounceable Japanese name, classic PC adventure Myst (which looks better than ever), Victory Zone, a very sad pinball title and another first-person perspective title set in a futuristic cyber-environment. There's also the inevitable side-on beat-'em-up, which features some of the most outlandish characters and back grounds in the genre. Probably the most interesting (if not the best) of these is a game which appears to give you control of a giant airship. If the idea of Zeppelin Commander appeals to you this could be your lucky console. We hope to have more pictures and information on all of these (except Victory Zone) next month. MORE ROBOTS ON THE 999 Look out for more information on these up-and-coming PlayStation games next month. RISE STALK OF THE TOWN Where do middle-eastern dictators eat? Scud-uLike. Ho flippi\" ho. If you're a 3DOwner fed up of hearing about how all the other new consoles have giant robot games and yours doesn't take heart. Belzerion is on its way. Like a lot of games these days it's viewed through the eyes of your very own gun-toting robot warrior and features some truly splendid graphics. VR Stalker isn't about following famous people as you may expect. It's actually a combat flight sim for the 3D0 which puts you in control of an F-14 Tomcat. We have no idea how it's going to play, but the graphics look great. Stick with us for any new developments. Erm, warning, extreme danger. Exterminate, we will conquer. And stuff. "


"CVG NEWS Connected CHAOS THEORY GAMES ARE GOOD FOR YOU. Those renegade games publishers, uncannily called Renegade, are getting ready to launch Chaos Engine 2. The storyline is a weird mishmash of subjects which take you back to Victorian England, albeit a steam-driven cyberpunk version of said era, where you have to fight your way through legions of nutters in an overhead scrolling shoot-'em-up. Number two will in fact have a two player mode, putting you in direct competition with either a friend, enemy or computer opponent and will have the original mean and moody characters, but with some mega enhancements, plus an interactive 3D landscape, a morphin' size range of power-ups and we're promised a formidable soundtrack. The original Chaos was an excellent shoot-'em-up and was released across the formats and you can expect PC, PC-CD, SNES and Mega Drive versions with the Amiga version arriving first around Easter time. The original Chaos Engine scored a respectable 90% in CVG. If you're the kind of kid who likes to play hooky from school and hang around seedy arcades tough luck. New research from Anglia Polytechnic University would seem to indicate that, despite your best efforts, you're still learning. \"One finds that the way in which children approach problems presented by games is frequently very close to the way that they should solve problems in their science class at school,\" says Professor Stephen Hepell of Ultralab, the university's research centre. He's got a number of other interesting findings, so if you'd like more information ring 0171-381 4505. Chaos Engine 2 is going to have a two-player split screen mode and lots of new weapons. Fingers crossed for the future of Commodore. Miami-based Creative Equipment International has entered the foray with a cash deposit to aid its bid for CBM's assets. The final decision rests with Commodore's liquidator and creditors, but it's probably the most promising sign for the future of the company we've seen since its liquidation. COMMODORE DEAL NEAR? VIC TOKAT AN APOLOGY Our apologies go to the Vic Tokai company, which was the sponsor of last month's fabulous Saturn competition. Vic Tokai is the publisher of Kick Off 3 and not Imagineer, as was stated in the competition. SWEET MATE, SORTED You may already have read snippets about this, but here's more shots of Rave War (which is being renamed for our rather ravesensitive country) from Namco. Rave War will first see light of day in arcades around the world where it goes into direct competition with Virtua Fighter 2 (reviewed last issue). Once there's a bit of brand awareness a nearly-completed Playstation version is ready to roll. Word has it that it's actually more fluid than Sega's effort, but all we know so far is that each character in the game has a lengthy and convoluted plot history. More on this as soon as we can get it Ha, lll teach you to let your dog dump in my garden. 10 "

"CVG THE RACE IS ON. SONY PlayStation With Ultra 64 not scheduled to appear in Japan until the end of 1995, the 32-Bit battle for the hearts, souls and cash of gamers is a two-horse race between Sony and Sega. In one corner a company with an established track record, big-name characters and huge brand loyalty. In the other the new boys, with an undeniably powerful machine, but a lot to prove. Round one had Virtua Fighter putting the Saturn on top, this month it's the turn of Ridge Racer and the PlayStation. Is it an early knock out for Sony? Read on...  The new nachines 13 "


"CVG THE RACE PlayStation both here so who's best? Is the Saturn standing tall, or is the PlayStation proving the doubters wrong? With Virtua Fighter on the Saturn Sega proved that all the money they've poured into arcade machines has been well invested as they can now bring those games into the home. Sony, on the other hand, has had a tougher job with plenty of people doubting that the debut boys could make the kind of splash they promised with the PlayStation. So far they've succeeded.. But what about us? We don't want to wait 10 months for this hardware. Plenty of people are prepared to pay import prices for one of the systems but which one? To judge these machines on power is wrong while the PlayStation is slightly better specced, it's like the difference between a car that does 190Mph and one that goes 200Mph they're both bloody fast and you're not going to be able to use that kind of speed any way. Buying decisions should based on the kind of games available, those that are coming out, the type of game you like and the quality they're coming through at. At the moment the PlayStation is slightly more popular in the office that the Saturn. Partly because it looks better, and mainly because Ridge Racer is a better game. Next month things could be different it depends on what games come in. Over the next 17 pages we've covered all the new software for both systems, read it and judge for yourself just which machine you'd like in the home. The party's over, it's now time for the new consoles to prove themselves. 14 "

"EKNO REVIEW CVG 0:56765 The sound effects in the tunnel are especially amazing, more so if you're running the game through a surround-sound telly. Tace. The replay mode is one of highlights. The only thing it doesn't have is Need For Speed-style crashes. Is this really the reason why you need a PlayStation, or should you hang around and wait for Daytona... ike Virtua Fighting on the Saturn, this is the game that, initially at least, the PlayStation will be judged on. It's certainly a title that shows off the machine's capabilities, but is the night game for the job? As a coin-op Ridge Racer worked because it impressed the pants off punters, but it was very much a case of 'all mouth and no trousers'. Cowering beneath the awesome visuals was some pretty weak gameplay that wasn't helped by unresponsive controls. The Play Station version tells a different story though. The graphics are simply amazing. The resolution and detail almost matches the coin-op, and it powers along at a pace which makes it quite possibly the fastest your mates. Strangely, though, this hasn't turned out to be a problem. The four difficulty levels affect the size of the track, skill of the other drivers and the road-handling of your car. And if you complete all the tracks, there's a mirror mode which reverses the course so you're racing in the other direction. A RIDGE TOO FAR With only one track, we really thought that this would be a nice game to show off the power of the Play Station, but not something that could justify the import price. However, complete track one and the game goes into Expert mode, with the track flipped just like the mirror mode in Virtua Racing. It's a damn Scht tougher and the time limit is unforgiving. There are a few other surprises in there as well but we won't spoil it for you. Yet. far too busy keeping your eyes on the road to notice it. The biggest concern any of us had was lastability. A race game with one track may be all right in Japan when you're paying  for it, but if you're shelling out for import prices you want something that you'll be able to sit down and play not just an easy way to impress racing game anywhere. The frame rate does drop once in a while when the screen gets very busy, but this is a rare event and one which usually passes unnoticed. Namco has remembered to include the plane taking off, complete with digitised jet engines, but you're usually CA 58 03/03 44 05/1262 s 44 UTARA >>> > A This corner is fairly innocuous on the standard track mode and a real killer in mirror mode.

"CVG REVIEW TEKNO CAR BLIMEY! 57 07/12 YEYE NOW LOADING: st To keep you occupied in the few seconds it takes the game to load, Namco has thoughtfully included a game of Galaga (nÃ© Galaxians). But no missus, it's not that simple. They've been a bit devious! Complete it before the game loads and you get eight new cars to drive! And they're all named after Namco games! Yahoo! A Novice? I'll show her how much of a flaming novice am when I run her over. A It's only when you've sat down to a four-hour Ridge Racer sesh that you realise how comfortable the PlayStation's joypad is. PRODUCED BY namco There's a manual gear option, although the game moves so fast that trying to work a six-speed gear box is nearly impossible. ROTTERDAM NATION Ridge Racer's soundtrack and effects are more than an audio match for the graphics. Six excellent and, ahem, 'banging' tunes play in the background while the engine noises are the most realistic we've encountered this side of Top Gear. We also found out that, when there's no music playing on the title screen, you can whip out the game disc and put in one of your audio CDs to play during the game. We don't know how safe this is, and we accept no responsibility for any PlayStations blown up as a result. But you've got to admit it's pretty cool.

This is one of the only points in the game where the frame rate drops, don't worry though as it doesn't interfere with the playability at all. TEAM VERDICT The car in front isn't a Toyota, but it is a typically safe bit of boring Japanese motor engineering which is just about to be overtaken. Hah, hah! The only graphical differences we could find between this and the coin-op was the sky, which doesn't look quite as nice on the PlayStation version. Mco 3STEVE JAMES Actually, I didn't think Ridge Racer in the arcades was that all great but on a homebased platform it excels it moves at such a scorching pace you can hardly k . 12/12 PLAYSTATION OR SATURN? VERDICT In our opinion Ridge Racer just has the edge over Virtua Fighter as a new machine game. Technically it's superior and it's also tougher. As to which of the two console will be the biggest, it's still way too early to tell. Give it a few months and a few more games and we'll have a clearer picture. Driving at night is extremely difficult. The first you know about any upcoming bends is when you're travelling through your wind screen at 200mph. GARY LORD The PlayStation's debut racing game is an absolute star; it's a superb arcade conversion, the graphics have virtually no slow down and it's totally addictive to boot. PLAYSTATION Who needs arcades any. more? Well, we still do. As impressed as I am at Ridge Racer on a home machine, it is a game I've seen before and played in the arcades. But, and I felt the same way about Virtua Fighter, it seems to play a whole lot better when you're not coughing up  a go. Technically it's magnificent, and with the mirror mode and plenty of hidden features any doubts about it's long-term appeal are quickly dispelled. Let's just hope that we start seeing original software of this quality. But this'll definitely do for now. MARK PATTERSON PD 52 0612 RAD AUTOMATIC Like most people thought the Ridge Racer coin-op was just a case of paying  to sit in a Mazda for five minutes. This conversion, however, is surprisingly absolutely excellent. There's nothing big or clever about ramming cars in Ridge Racer.

Virtua Fighter, while not a major arcade smash, proved it had the power to impress on Satur, but with vastly more detailed graphics it looks like, when it debuts around about February/ March time, Toshinden could smash the Sega game's brains out.

But it's not the gameplay, which is vastly improved from the first game, that people will notice, it's the stunning graphics that will have them queuing to play. Incredibly, the AM2 development believe they can faithfully recreate the game for the Saturn. Technically the Saturn is capable of handling the detailed texture mapping required to bring the game's characters to the small screen. They've certainly left themselves plenty of time after having to do a rush job on Virtua Fighter. The earliest you're likely to see the game is Christmas '95, but there are also rumours it could be the middle of '96. As long as they do a good job the wait will be worth it. 25 "


"CVG PREVIEW TEKNO he new nachines) philosoma PLAYSTATION Sony PlayStation One of the things we said about the PlayStation a few issues back was that it seemed as though it would be having a lot of conventional-style games dressed up by special effects. Guess what? We were right again. Just check out this new slant on shoot-'em-ups we reckon it's gonna be awesome... The neatest effect in the game is when one of the cut-scenes develops into the action. The viewpoint usually pulls back and the nice rendered ship suddenly turns out to be the thing you're controlling. Wow. Even in the 'standard side-on view, Philosoma exhibits some spectacular graphics particularly the explosions. irst impressions may count a lot of the time, but they can also be somewhat misleading. Our first thoughts on Philosoma, for instance, came from a bit of video footage which showed a very poor looking, vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up. However, while the vertical bit still looks a little rough around the edges, that's only a quarter of the game. And A Philosoma is technically a very adventurous project. POINTS OF VIEW What separates Philosoma from every other shoot-'em-up is the way it makes use of Virtua-style multiple viewpoints. you never have to play it like that... What separates this from any other shoot-'em-up is the way it utilises all four of the different view points such games are based around.

Naturally this adds several new dimensions to the gameplay to produce the first shoot-'em-up in a very long time which stands a good chance of earning the monicker original'. The action seit consists of the kind of fast-paced fight-or-die blasting that will be familiar to anyone who's played the likes of Thunderforce IV or Super Aleste. It's good to see that, even with all the temptation from the wonderful piece of kit, the programmers haven't got too carried away, but still managed to combine the best elements of a shoot-'em-up with the kind of features they haven't been able to do until now. There's no escape from cut scenes, the game's full of them, at least they blend well with the action. A Presumably some of the different view-points will make the game a real toughie to play 22 "

Push the batteries into the power boxes to activate the electric toys, like trains and cranes, which occasionally help you out clockwork ou know, it's a pretty safe bet that most game designers had horrific childhoods. Every day another game hits the shelves which tells the story of evil toys rising during the middle of the night to enslave human households. Do all kids whose parents tell them mentally B scarring bedtime stories grow up to be programmers or something? Well, just in case you don't already weep at the sight of a Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger (although most sane people do) here's yet another your-playthings-wille at-your eyes-out-title. Clockwork Knight tells the tale of Pepperanchou the crap clockwork knight, and his quest to save the beautiful figurine from inside a clock from the clutches of an evil, and far more proficient, clockwork knight. To do this all he has to do is traverse four levels of platform action, hacking the evil possessed toys to pieces with his big key. Simple eh? Well, actually, it is.

Is this a case of an old dog PlayStation with new tricks, or does the song remain the same for one of the biggest names in Konami's back catalogue? arodius, in its various guises, has been with us for quite a few years now even longer in its original form of Nemesis (circa 1984). Nostalgia isn't a bad thing, unless you're old and go on about how great it was when we were bombed senseless in the blitz, but it's pushing the envelope when it's on your brand new 32-bit machine. Parodius gets away with it, but at the same time doesn't. Konami has obviously set out to offer value for money and help new machine owners build up a decent software library in a short space of time. The disc not only contains the latest coin-op version, Ultimate Parodius, but also features the original SNES version of the game which is complete with slow-down for some reason. That's great if you're living in Japan where you're not paying too much for the game, but at import prices you've got to be a real game nut to be willing to part with the cash. As for the game itself, it's as playable as ever. The Ultimate version offers more characters and weapons along with new levels and bosses. There's no arguing with that. And before you think to yourself 'that's not a next generation game', what does it matter? This is playable and the Ultimate version is far superior to anything a 16-bit machine could produce. After all, we've all seen games that look amazing but just don't seem to play that well... ultimate 56900 Recognise this? It's Salamander, only it isn't 'cos it's Parodius.

The gameplay is identical to the SNES version, although the soundtrack and graphics are a huge improvement. As to whether you should buy it or not, it's all down to whether you liked the orig. inal and feel the PS version is value for money or not.

SECOND OPINION I'm really not convinced by this. It's not that Parodius is a bad game, far from it, it's just that this isn't the kind of software I was expecting to see on PlayStation. There are a few things to separate it from conventional 16-bit games, but that really isn't enough for me. For the PlayStation's asking price you have the right to expect more.

"TEKNO REVIEW CVG nachines) motor toon grand prix PLAYSTATION SONY Swinging in with more hype PlayStation than any other PlayStation game comes Motor Toon GP and you can't help but wonder why... lot of people misguidedly think that the arrival of machines such as the PlayStation will instantly transform the games industry, and that every disc they'll buy will be a quality title. Wrong! Certainly some games are a quantum leap apart from anything we've had before and so, it seems, is inconsistency. One minute we've got Ridge Racer, probably the Thest driving game on console, the next we have Motor Toon Grand Prix. And it's a very different game in several ways. Firstly, it's far more cutesy, at least it seems like that's the approach the programmers have taken. It's very similar to Suunt Race FX, although with a better two-player mode. However, it has all the hallmarks of being a rush job. The conbols aren't brilliant, the gameplay's flawed and the graphic itches are too numerous to count. You can see what the programmer's have intended to do, and the results, given time, would have been substantially better. As it is you've got a choice of two PlayStation race games. It's hardly a decision that give you sleepless nights. VERDICT Even the rendered animations between aces are rough around MALUME.CO:45 02 SPEED 25 LRP:01/03 DD:24.12 OOOKM/H 01/03 PLAYSTATION This is very much the Clockwork Knight of the PlayStation in that there is plenty of good ideas here completely written off by dodgy programming.

The graphics are constantly breaking up, making it hard to determine where you are, and getting your car back on to the track after crashes can be a frustrating experience.

ERZURU Stretch your PlayStation to its limits with this full-colour puzzle title. Puzzle games have come a long way since Alexei Pajitnov first unveiled Tetris all those years ago. The puzzle scene has gone from being masses of strange titles you could never get your head around to being a series of clones of the same game which you still can't get your head around. Every format's got a Tetris-alike, and here's the one for the PlayStation. It's the usual drill, coloured bells fall in pairs s from the top of the screen, match three or more of the same colour together and they disappear. The twist in this title is that some of the bells are stuck inside bubbles, and they're only freed when bells next to them explode. This means you can have a number of time-bomb multiple strings in among the bells. Activate one of these and your character performs their special attack, which usually results in a whole ruck of bubble-clad belis suddenly appearing on your opponent's side of the screen. When the bells reach the top of your screen it's game over. pop 'n' twinbee gale racer SATURN Sega SATURN Time Warner tama TELURU VII Tama's greatest fault is that it soon gets a bit repetitive The thing is, is this really the kind of game that you bought a Saturn for? SOLIT TIME 0'3316 AREA 1 2 RONE 12h WAVE It isn't often that you can sum up a game in one word, but 'Crap' suits Gale Racer perfectly. A conversion of Sega's ageing Rad Mobile coin-op. Gale Racer looks like it has been rushed out of the door to tie in with the Saturn's release. The sprites are two-dimensional, badly EA defined, 15 and the amount of flicker when the screen gets busy is unforgivable. It doesn't even play well. An atrocious game, this isn't so much a gale as a wet fart. Truly awful stuff. Designed to make the most of the Saturn's zoom and rotational capabilities, Tama is an update of those old ball-bearing maze games you used to find in crackers. Guiding a small metallic ball across a series of obstacle-filled courses, the basic aim of the game is to reach the end of the stage before the timer expires. While this sounds very easy, holes, gates and WAVE 3-2 deadly creatures are added to the mix to make things trickier. An entertaining puzzler, 3 A God-awful piece of crap.

The basic difficulty level may be a little on the easy side, but this has obviously been created for two players to go head-tohead.

"CVG Q&A TEKNO e new nachines your questions answered. Why are PlayStation discs black? Apparently it's something to do with the amount of light reflected and that black discs are more efficient. However, if this is the case, and it's not just a gimmick, why doesn't anyone else do it? SEGASATURN FINISH HIM. Will Street Fighter/ Mortal Kombat/ Samurai Shodown be coming out for them? No one has announced plans to convert any of these games, but it's very likely that they'll appear in some form late next year. Is Daytona better than Ridge Racer? Who knows? It was in the PIT WORK! arcades, Our 'phones don't stop ringing at the moment as you lot call in your dozens wanting to know more about the PlayStation PlayStation and Saturn. To save you the expense of a call, here are a few of your common questions answered. 06/12 ODDEL Is it true that Sony are doing a 64-Bit PlayStation? Both companies are convinced their machines have what it takes to last for several years, by which time the market will have evolved so they'll be looking at creating something more than a standard games machine. Whose head will you be beating on your new machine? What's best, Saturn or PlayStation? On paper the PlayStation has the edge. However, both machines are very powerful and capable of replicating almost any coin-op. Do 32x games work with the Saturn? No. It is possible for Sega to produce an adaptor for just such a case, but what's the point? The Saturn's a vastly more powerful machine, so who wants to play games that are technically inferior? A Ridge Racer and Daytona they've both got cars in them. but the Saturn version isn't due out until April '95 so we'll reserve judgment until we've seen a finished version running When are they coming out officially? There aren't any firm dates yet, but September-November looks likely for both systems. How much will they cost? We still don't know, but we'd estimate between  and . Is there going to be a Saturn joystick? Yes, although it's reported to have been redesigned at the request of the AM2 department. Which machine's going to be the biggest selling? Obviously being an established name in the console market, Sega have a head start. But the key is getting the software right. Whoever manages to produce a consistent range of quality titles first looks like a good bet for the top slot. Will import machines be compatible with official games? Again, it's still not known for sure. It seems likely that both Sega and Sony will have some kind of lock-out system to beat the import game. In the case of the Saturn the cartridge slot may lead to a CDX-style import busting device. How do the PlayStation's memory cards work? Most games have an option to save out configuration changes, high scores, game positions and any other details. The card can hold quite a bit of information which can be deleted at any time, or you can use additional cards. How much do the games cost? At the moment, on import, anything from -. Although we expect the prices should start dropping around Easter. A Streetfighter not announced for either machine yet. 36 "

"CVG PREVIEW WORK E (NPROGRESS PC CD-ROM Unconfirmed Adventure Infogrames Programmed in house Initiated April '94 90% complete 3DO version planned INo other ver. sions available Estimated release February An Alone in the Dark game finally makes it to PC CD-ROM. It's the third in the series and the spookiest by far. Stick yer spurs on yer boots and ride into town... he Alone in the Dark series has been wowing PC owners for a good few years now and Infogrames is hoping for a similar sort of hit with this CD sequel. Starring, as ever, the inimitable detective Edward Carnby, the game takes our fearless sleuth to the Mojave desert in 1925. Ghostly goings on are rife on a film set in the macabrely named Slaughter Gulch; one minute it was a hive of Western B-movie activity, next thing nothing just a lonesome steed fleeing for its life with the words 'Call Carnby' smeared in blood upon its saddle. Never one to pass up on a challenge, the intrepid investigator dives in for the crack and finds Slaughter A Ed will need to swallow a few chemical cocktails if he wants to make it to the end. A Not the most inviting place in the world, is it? Slaughter Gulch 1, population nil. Gulch has been transformed into a Ghost Town literally. The place is absolutely crawling with Zombies Cowboy Zombies led by Jed Stone, the bastard son of the Voo-Doo villainess, Elizabeth Jarrett of Alone in the Dark 2 fame. This is the biggest Alone in the Dark game so far with a huge landscape over which our hero does his usual stuff A It wouldn't be a Western without a saloon bar, would it? A One of the many tasteful deaths that await Ed if he fails. GAME BY INFOGRAMES CONTACT INFOGRAMES (0171-738 8199) FOR INFORMATION 40 "


"PREVIEW CVG Just like the first Alone in the Dark , there's a section where you have to jump from stone-to-stone to reach the other side. No, it's not a cuckoo clock, it's a vulture clock .Find it some meat to avoid a pe cking. running around, getting himself into fixes, fighting his way out of them and doing some major puzzle-solving on the way. The game's a bit of a bummer for Eddie because at one point he actually gets wasted by a demon bullet from hell. Being a lucky kinda guy though, Slaughter Gulch was built on an old Indian burial ground so Ed gets helped out by an existAlone 3 has bigger, badder guns than either of its predecessors. ing Indian tribe they manage to bring him back to life but they obviously had a bit of a hangover when they weaved their magic because he comes back as a cougar. Our hero has to remain in this animalistic state until he finds a talisman capable of transforming him back to his rootin' tootin' self. It's Alone 3 and the viewing angles are as weird as ever. A The game ends with a nice, rendered end sequence as Ed and Emily escape from Slaughter Gulch in a demonic train. A Alone 3 is full of the usual skullduggery... CHANGES Alone in the Dark 2 was criticised by some for concentrating too heavily on the fighting frontInfogrames has obviously picked up on this because reverting more to the original. Alone in the Dark 3 is much more puzzle orientated although there are some rather ace weapons with which to murder your foes such as Winchester rifles, heavy duty shotguns and an excellent Gatling gun. Don't slip, or Ed's going to get a very hot bath indeed. A If it's got a green face, kill it. But how exactly do you go about killing something who is already dead? dark 3 I wouldn't go down there if I were you: who knows what might be lurking behind that door. "

Whilst shooting doesn't take up all that much of the game it's important to make sure you're good at it or you'll get stuck time and time again.

FLASHBACK t must be a bit of a bummer creat ing this amazing machine which can analyse the molecular structure of any creature, only to find when you give it a try out, that most of the world leaders are actually aliens in disguise heavy trip maaa-n! This is exactly what happens to our mate Conrad a galactical investigator in the year 2142. What to do, what to do? Oh yeah, that's a good idea Connie baby â let the extra -terrestrials know that you've found out their embarrassing little secret forcing them to kidnap you and dump you on an alien planet. You were lucky, the last person who found them out had his bottom surgically removed, was forced to wear purple and yellow-striped tank tops and was brain-bent into singing Kylie songs forever more so that people wrote him off as a complete nutter whenever he was lucid enough to spill the beans. Anyway, the bottom line is, Flashback has finally made it to the CD-i after doing the rounds on almost every other system going. It's an arcade adventure affair with you guiding Conrad through the horrors of the alien planet in a desperate bid to return to Earth. As you'd expect from the CD-i, polygon graphics are used to produce loads of pretty cinematic intro and cut-screen sequences but the main game itself is pretty much the same as the other versions â three worlds, loads of huge levels including Jungle, Titan Base, Death Tower Gameshow, Earth and the Alien Planet. The name of the game is jumping, shooting, chatting to the natives, interacting with anything that will let you and basically saving It's amazing how a bullet in the bum can produce a ballet performance that's fit for any royal performance of Swan Lake. These guards use jet packs to swoop down on you at inopportune moments. A This is no time for a kip-get up and fight, you fool! A Phwoar look at that luverley switch. It might even let you interact with it if you ask nicely. A OK, hands up if you're a bit of a girl's blouse woosie who likes playing with dolls. ON YOUR SCREEN IN A FLASH If you get into a bit of a fix, or just if you feel like a bit lonely and want a chat tap into your friendly neighbourhood hologram via a rather groovy cinematic cut screen. The smart cinematic intro sequence shows an alien spaceship streaking across the skies then crash landing in spectacular style on the alien planet.

Worms will have a network option allowing up to 16 competitors to destroy each other at any one time.

I mean ignoring the Jim variety about the only thing they're good for is cutting them in half and marvelling at how the two bits carry on with life as though nothing has happened. Team 17 aims to give the worm population a bit more credibility, though, with its forthcoming title based around the earth-burrowing ones. Developed by Andy Davison, Worms is probably best described as a hybrid between Lemmings and Cannon Fodder. Kill or be killed is the only rule that matters as up to four platoons of four worms slug it out in a multi-directional scrolling landscape. Each worm has a variety of weapons at its disposal including bazookas, homing missiles, Uzis and hand grenades, with the winner being the person with the most survivors at the end of a scrap. Weapon crates are scattered over the playfield and airstrikes can be used too, so there's no danger of the carnage slowing down. The worms are also a bit handy in close combat and have a range of dragon punch-style moves available, as well as individual finishing moves which include using a chainsaw or baseball bat. Team 17's reputation for producing quality software suggests that Worms will probably be good but whether it offers any. thing new to the vastly copied Lemmings genre we can only wait and see... DYNAMITE CD WIND Each worm will have an energy rating from 1-100. Use a powerful weapon like the bazooka to take out large chunks of the enemies' energy. JOANNA LUML Poate Cause massive carnage with the large range of weapons available which include Uzis and bazookas.

Apparently they're all omelette recipes, you know... SNES THE 8-BIT VERSIONS The Game Gear and Game Boy versions of the Stargate are completely different from their 16-bit sisters. For the small screens, Acclaim has instead opted for a rather tasty Columns-style puzzle game. You're faced with a circular basin-type thing in to which pieces of pie inscribed with different symbols fall. Place three similar symbols on top of each other to make them disappear. In Skill Mode, the pieces fall progressively faster and the game only ends when the basin overflows with pieces. In Battle Mode the aim is to take as many Stargates as possible from Ra who makes things difficult by piling on extra pieces of pie. GAME GEAR lways one to pounce on a hot new film licence, Acclaim has done it again with this potential blockbuster starring Hollywood action man Kurt Russell and the rather kooky James Spader. The story begins in the 1920s when two curious rings one stone, one metal and both cov. ered with baffling hieroglyphics are unearthed close to the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Fast forward to present day when archaeologist Daniel Jackson and his team decipher the code and open up a portal to another world.

And one such film we rather enjoyed at our special Planet Hollywood screening was Stargate, which stars one Kurt Russel, James Spader and Jaye Davidson (that bloke who looks good in a dress). The film has a Star Wars-esque feel to it, only with a bit less shooting in it. The Stargate of the title is an ancient Egyptian artefact which actually turns out to have been built by a tyrannical alien (Davidson), and when the Yanks (Russel and Spader) work out the gate's combination and teleport themselves to another planet in another galaxy, it just means one thing... trouble. There are pick-ups aplenty in the caverns. The bad news is, you might get wasted finding them. MEGA DRIVE One of the alien foes. One of the early ones, he's a bit of a thicko and a doddle to beat.

"CVG LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH  PRIZE WINNER in the bag EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES Is it just me or is this internet thing a complete con? The hype surrounding it has been spiralling to hysterical proportions for some time now, and sadly, I was taken in and splashed out for my link. Worra mistake! OK, you can play networked games, but the majority are pretty crap and it works out really expensive if you play for long. You also have to drag yourself out of bed in the middle of the night if you want to enter a decent dungeon and although Cyberspace sounds really impressive, at the end of the day it's no more interesting than talking to a total stranger on the phone rather like those 0898 party lines.

Yeah, the graphics are fab but the actual gameplay is just a general mish-mash of thousands of other platform games there's nothing new or exciting in it at all. Also, I thought it was too easy Paul Burrows, Portsmouth Well if you'd read the review properly in issue 157 YON might have seen the bit where we bemoaned the lack of originality. Always remember to look at the text as well as the numbers. WHY NO CD32 GAMES? Could you tell me why it is that despite the fact there have been more CD32s sold in this country that more Mega-CD games get released and developed than CD32 ones, as most CD32 games are just straight Amiga port overs.

"LETTERS CVG SCMEXT SCHMENERATION SONY Next generation schmext schmeneration more like! It's all very well going on about all these new machines being launched over in Japan and all the great games you can get for them, but this is no use to us poor punters over here in England who are stuck with Mega Drives which we're now being told are out-of-date and useless. None of these new wonder machines are going to get an official release for another year yet, and the only alternative is to buy them on import and I've already lost money doing that when I got my Mega Drive. Why can't Sega and Sony and all them others just launch their machines at the same time worldwide and save a lot of trouble for their customers? I've now got to put up with a year's worth of pictures of brilliant-looking games I can't play until they come out officially. Sorry this letter's such a moan but I really had to get it off my chest. Paul Rosenthal, Bolton Dator HE'S GOT A PC STOP WRITING  YOB I've got a PC. All my friends have got Mega Drives. They call me names because I've got a PC. I think its adaptability is an excellent quality and applaud its ability to work with programs, especially financial packages. They all play Sonic and laugh. Why? Graham Young, Aberdeen PS I am 28 years old. Dear YOB, My dog's got no nose how does it smell? Like your bum smells. Insult me if you dare! Assam Sarwar, Manchester Well, you know what they say all work and no play makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise, We don't do Yob any more. EVILS OF VIDEO GAMES EMPEROR'S NEW PANTS Congrats on producing a really great mag, but praise aside I've actually got a complaint. It's not about your fine organ (ooer) but about the Mega Drive 32X. Sega has obviously spent loads of cash advertising this thing, and they've secured plenty of coverage in your mg and others for this new product. My complaint is that once everyone's bought a 32X the Saturn is going to comed and we're all going to have to upgrade again. The games on the 32X are good, yes, but they could easily have been done with a  SVP chip plug-thru cartridge and not the expensive wad of plastic they've put out instead. I don't see why Sega had to do it, why didn't it just launch the Saturn earlier? Why Sega, why did you have to do it? John Smithfield, Darlington I would be interested to hear how on earth you can justify the way you and your magazine ram video games down the throats of innocent children when they involve essentially, the glorification of violence and pornography and present a potentially serious health hazard. I caught my son reading your magazine and having skimmed through its contents felt I had no choice but to confiscate it I want my son to grow up to be a normal, healthy person and from what I've seen and heard, play ing video games can only be detrimental to that aim. FACT: Video games glorify violence, and that Doom game is far worse than any 18-rated video. FACT: Video games demean women and are in some cases pornographic â are you trying to breed a nation of sexists who have no respect for women? FACT:Video games have been linked with causing epileptic fits. FACT:Excessive playing of video games lowers the average intelligence. FACT: Lone playing of video games can lead to a child becoming a social inadequate. FACT: Video games have been linked with repetitive strain injury. I accept that not all the above allegations have been proved beyond all doubt, but these links have been made and even if they are just possibilities I really cannot see how any responsible adult can take a chance with a child's life by allowing them to continue playing these so-called games. You and your staff are even worse since you positively encourage the phenomena. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Yours J. Morris (Mrs), Hertford. Well look at it this way, the Saturn will probably be about twice as expensive as the 32X when it comes out so if you don't reckon you've got the dough to handle a full upgrade you can update your old ma. chine adequately. If you're planning on buying a Saturn, however, you might not want to fork out for a 32X now. Yeah, well you can get stuffed you old bat, before we come round to your house and stick a thermo plasma gun up your Jacksie. 55 "

"ALL THE MAIN REVIEWS CVG reviewed this month. ere at Computer and Video Games it's a pretty unanimous verdict: Ridge Racer, the first game for the PlayStation, is one of the best things to happen in a long, long while. But while the Saturn in the form of Virtua Fighter and the PlayStation in Ridge Racer have both got off to a promising start, there's still 16-bit goodies to keep things going. Wing Commander 3 is excellent, as is Sensible World of Soccer. In the battle of the footy giants, however, International Superstar Soccer just about beats Sensi. It's amazing! Hope you enjoy the ish. Steve James, Managing Editor vedere c e le What we're playing this month This month's hot-hits RADINGTON Sensi Soccer p.80 cc STEVE Ridge Racer/PSX One of the best racers seen, and in the year that brought us Virtua Racing on cart and Daytona USA. Ristar/MD Not too original, but great fun nonetheless. Apart from the horrible musle. Super Stardust/CD32 If only software companies had produced games of this quality for the CD32 when it was launched, things might be very different now. Ridge Racer/PSX I didn't like the coin-op all that much but the home version is loads more fun. Up there with the likes of Virtua Fighter and no mistake. Libble Rabble/SNES It's a bit weird, it's a bit very crap looking, but it's extremely playable in the same way as games like Hebereke's Popoon. Superstar Soccer/SNES Even though everyone else has had loads more practice than me and I consequently lose very often, It's still ace. ness personified. Here at CVG we don't give high scores away lightly. A game has to be rather special before it scores over 90% and a CVG Hit. Even rarer though is a CVG Gold (awarded to games that have pushed back the boundaries of gaming) but don't expect to see more than a few of these a year as it takes a score of 96% or over to earn one. Anyway, here are the top games this month... Ridge Racer p.16 16 Ridge Racer/PlayStation 58 Wing Commander 3/PC CD 62 International Superstar Soccer/SNES 80 Sensible World of Soccer/A1200 83 Wario Blast/GB MARK Super Stardust p.68 GARY Wing Commander 3/PC CD Good to see Marky Mark Hamill going down in the world, and a top flight game to boot. One of the best PC games of '94. Warlo Blast/GB A highly entertaining piece of software, epecially in Nintendo colour-o-vision. All the thrills of Bomberman plus the anti-Mario to boot. Ridge Racer/PSX It's pretty not at all bad, guv'nor, as sure as I'm standing here in front of this camera against a blue sheet. The big picture Ridge Racer/PSX You know, I might even buy a PlayStation now. Wing Commander 3/PC CD The only game capable of rivalling Magic Carpet as PC game of the year. Superstar Soccer/SNES The only thing I can beat Rad at in the whole wide world. Except for everything in the whole wide world of course. Including having a life. If any other version of a game is available, then we'll tell you via our Alternatives and Other Versions boxes. We'll even tell you it's destined for any other formats. For consistency's sake, games retain the original scores in alternative boxes. Ristar p. 67 52 "


"CVG REVIEW IPC CD-ROM Space Combat Electronic Arts .99 Out Now No other versions available 3DO version planned AUTO A Colonel Blair battles the Kilrathi hordes as they try to destroy the TCS Victory. Look at the SVGA graphics... Is Origin's long-awaited space opera a triumph or just the old game with a few FMV bits and SVGA graphics? And have you got a PC that can run it...? KPS:333 433 wing commander 35 heart-of-the ODCE 10 VICTORY ith a script penned by veteran screenwriters Frank De Palma and Terry Borst, film stars like Mark Hamill and John Rhys Davis, Super VGA flight sequences, Silicon Graphicsrendered backdrops, an orchestrated stereo soundtrack and production costs that rival a small movie, Origin's superb Wing Commander 3: Heart of the Tiger is probably the best, most engaging and most exciting game I've played in the last 12 months. I can't say too much about the plot, because, like a movie, most of the tension and atmosphere is driven along by the brilliantly scripted narrative. Suffice it to say, Wing 3 is about the Terran/Kilrathi battle, a huge, planet-busting weapon called the Behemoth, a traitor and lots of frighteningly difficult SVGA flight sequences. If you're a Wing veteran then you'll find it all very familiar because, structurally, there isn't a lot of difference between Wing 3 and the first two games â ie you walk around the Victory, chatting to the various characters before hopping into your futuristic starfighter for the 3D space battles. In fact, you could just say that Wing 3 is the old Wing Commander game, but with Full Motion Video and high-res visuals, and with texture-mapped, Gouraud-Shaded SVGA graphics, stereo sound and real movie 'stars'; in fact Wing 3 is the closest you're going to get to taking part in a space opera. Forget Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars, Wing 3 is a truly interactive movie. It's pricey, but if you've 8mb and some cheetah-speed hardware, it will blow your socks off. In-between missions you can chat to the crew, like Hobbes, a Kilrathi defector. GAME BY ORIGIN CONTACT ELECTRONIC ARTS (01753 549442) FOR INFORMATION 58 "


"REVIEW CVG THE STORY SO FAR... Even before the game starts, sit back and watch the superbly atmospheric intro FMV sequence, which shows you just how Blair fits in to the ongoing Wing Commander storyline, and introduces the main characters in the continuing saga. Er, you've died and Captain Eisen says a few polite words at your funeral. In Wing 3 you can choose what ship to fly on a particular mission. The Thunderbolt, here, is a heavy fighter Inarinut selectinn THUNDERBOLT VI meer previous -344 DARKET 1978 DOO DODODG SALTO HS TUSSLE 3 BAH To blow up the Corvette, simply destroy all its gun turrets and it will then be defenceless. BIG ONES To play Wing 3 you've really got to have a monster-PC to get the damn thing running. For starters, it needs an 8mb machine and if you want to play the game in its full SVGA glory (there is a VGA option for all us lowly 486 owners), we'd recommend at least a DX2 or a 60MHz Pentium. Yes, a Pentium. Unless you want to spend more time waiting for the game to load than actually playing it, you're going to need the fastest machine you can lay your hands on. Mark Hamill scrambles to intercept a Kilrathi strike force. The FMV bits are, without a doubt, the best I've seen on PC. USELESS INFORMATION NO. 3,456: WING 3 USES OVER THREE HOURS OF LIVE ACTION VIDEO FOOTAGE, SILICON GRAPHIC-GENERATED BACKDROPS AND IT COST OVER $4 MILLION TO MAKE. 59 "


"CVG REVIEW AUTO KPS 398 SET 378 MY GOD! IT'S FULL OF STARS... The most impressive thing about Wing Commander 3 is the fact that the game 'stars' some major Hollywood talent. Come on, this is a truly interactive movie after all. The gameplay may well be identical to the other Wing Commander games, but Wing 3 has glorious SVGA. Mark Hamill plays Colonel Christopher Blair. Hey, isn't he the guy from Star Wars? There is a wide variety of different ships to fly. It's Full Motion Video a-gogo in Wing Commander 3. ALTERNATIVE CD-1 Burn:Cycle Philips/.99 Without a doubt the best game developed on the CD-I, and it really uses FMV to excellent effect and there's plenty of variety in the gameplay. John Rhys Davis (Sallah in the Indiana Jones movies) puts on a Sean Connery accent to play Paladin. ISSUE 156: 90% SECOND OPINION VERDICT Macolm MacDowell (A Clockwork Orange, Star Trek: Generations) stars as Admiral Tolwyn. You know that Wing 3 is going to be superb even when the intro sequence begins. Everything about the game oozes quality â the FMV footage of actors like Mark Hamill and John Rhys Davis; the high-resolution backdrops, the stunning SVGA 3D graphics... You can see where the $4 million that Origin spent on the game actually went. This is a next generation PC game, and if you haven't got a next generation PC to play it on, then you're going to miss out on something truly spectacular. GARY LORD PC CD-ROM To be honest, when I first played Wing Commander 3, my feelings went on a roller-coaster ride. To start with, I was stunned. The quality of the FMV scenes is amazing and the plot is tense, exciting and enthralling. But at the same time, I was disappointed. You see, it clunked along on my 486/33 very badly and in SVGA It was unplayable. God, it took over seven minutes Just to load the combat section from the CD. But, when I played it on a 60MHz Pentium... wow. Wing 3 Is, without a doubt, the best game I've played in the last 12 months. DEAN EVANS Rollins is a paranoid communications officer, who suspects that the Confederation is losing the war. A Blair chats about the war with Vagabond and Maniac. Hobbes, who featured in Wing Commander 2, is a Kilrathi defector who now fights for Confed forces.

"CVG REVIEW SNES Football Sim Konami Unconfirmed Out February No other versions available Saturn version planned It's a quick toss and then it's kick off, well no actually it's International Superstar Soccer from Konami actually. We said that this was going to be the best football game ever, and by jingo, we think you'll find we were right... isten, we're not exaggerating. This game's more realistic than being on the receiving end of a studs-up Paul Ince tackle. From the moment you play you know that the people who programmed it are either total football nuts (unlikely they're Japanese) or have done their homework very well (v. likely they're Japanese). Almost every aspect of football is covered in the game, from offsides and sendings off to time wasting and players putting their hands up to claim marginal decisions. But the attention to detail is completely overshadowed by the realistic gameplay. There's a huge array of moves, some of which are tough to master and are purely the domain of digital George Best's. The way the players work together also stands head-and-shoulders over any other football game. One-twos are possible along with fluid passing play and last-ditch long-ball punts. The result is totally playable, and as if that wasn't enough, the programmers have still found room to incorporate loads of other excellent features. For instance, apart from the various World Cup-style events, there's also a neat scenario mode. Here you apply your skills to historic encounters, most of which start you off a couple of goals down against a top side with just a couple of minutes remaining. The tough ones start with a sending off as well, which really is unfair. international superstar Soccer THROW Marginal decisions are claimed by both sides. It doesn't make any difference to the out. come, but at least you feel the lads are getting into the spirit of things.

Wait a sec, there aren't any gameplay faults. This is very nearly perfect, all they need is an English league version and I'd be like a pig in muck. Just think, success for Crewe Alex at last, because it's not bloody likely in real life. Football fans will appreciate it more than weirdos who don't like the sport. RAD AUTOMATIC SNES For pure playability International Superstar Soccer is the most significant step forwards in football games since Sensible Soccer hit the Amiga all those years ago. Admittedly FIFA on 3D0 may have wowed me with its stunning graphics and audio effects, but this is something else. Put simply Superstar Soccer is the best football game to be released on any format. It's not just the extraordinary attention to detail, if you've ever pulled a pair of football boots on you can appreciate just how realistic this is.

"CVG REVIEW MEGA DRIVE Platform Sega .99 January Release Game Gear version also available No other versions planned 500pt Oh look everyone a Mega Drive platform game. There's something you don't see every day. SA ta-ar. That's what they call you. Which is quite apt, thinking about it, as this game grants the player control of a star. Not a real star, of course. Balls of flaming gas a million miles wide aren't particularly well known for their platforming abilities. Their incredible mass makes it a bit difficult for them to jump any real height, you see, and their surface temperature has a tendency to evaporate whole levels, which takes a lot of the challenge out of things. No, you actually have the opportunity to control a little star with arms and a face called Ristar, a star-in-waiting, if you will. Not for him the decorative adornment of thousandmile high spews of flame they call solar flares, but a little pair of white gloves instead. And as for bringing light and life to planets, you can forget that. Ristar is too busy using his amaz. ing propelling elastic arms to help him reach otherwise impossible-to-get-to areas. Yes, it's another platform game in the Sonic/Dynamite Headdy mould. It has all the standard features of the genre along with, allegedly, some original twists of its own. Yeah, reck-on we'll see (as Michael Parkinson would have put it). A Headbutting inanimate background objects sometimes yields ace bonuses. SEA MONKEYING ABOUT 21600 A Use this little decoy Ristar to trigger traps in your path and stay safely out of the way. Stay out of the way of these flames or you're a starburger. 22400 Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, that's what Newton said. That was his third law of mechanics in fact, if our rusty educations serve us correctly. Anyway, this all applies in Ristar, which makes the underwater levels dangerous places to attack as the back. wards momentum resulting from a collision can easily bump you into more trouble. A Smash these treasure chests for lovely bonuses although some contain enemies! Aieee! 14400 sa A Spin little Ristar! These poles accelerate Ristar's spin speed and enable him to travel at unprecedented velocities.  GAME BY SEGA CONTACT SEGA (0171-373 3000) FOR INFORMATION 66 "


"REVIEW CVG FURIOUS WRIST ACTION (HO HO) 16600pts * 232 What seperates Ristar from his celestial counterparts is, coincidentally, his wrists. And the rest of his arms. And hands. But anyway, unlike most heavenly bodies Ristar is able to grip things, a bit like Action Man, with his stretchy arms. Let go of the grab button and Ristar yanks his limbs, sending you soaring up to a higher platform or headbutting a trapped and helpless foe. Once you've got the hang of rapid-fire arm usage the game is your oyster. 16600. Vlho There's more to beating Ristar bosses than just slamming into them a million times. Each requires a special technique or pattern of attack to finish. A These strange metronome things are the only way to clear your path of brooding hens (this is all true, we swear it). SECOND OPINION OK, the platform genre is as busy as your local Sainsbury's on Christmas Eve, but if anyone can produce a decent platformer then Sega can, as it has proved this year with the likes of Dynamite Headdy, Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles. Luckily Sega also manages to inject some originality, but it's not quite up there with the aforementioned games. After all's said and done though this is an addictive game that's replete with great graphical and gameplay touches. GARY LORD Always search bushes before you walk through them as there's often a rabid bunny hiding inside. VERDICT ONE-ARMED POLE Every platform hero has a gimmicky item: Mario mushrooms, Sonic rings and Ristar has poles. Occasionally a hori zontal handle appears inviting Ristar to grab hold and spin around in the required direction before achieving warp speed and being flung, for miles. Sometimes these trapeze-esque objects provide access to secret bonus rooms. or enable Ristar to reach other routes through a level and, when located at the end of a stage, they're simply in the area to dish out bonus points MEGA DRIVE I didn't hold out much hope for Ristar in today's kill-orbe-killed platform market. At first glance it just doesn't have any original features, which is the real lifeblood of a decent jumpy game like Ristar nowadays. However, des. pite the absence of any real gaming inspiration so far as the format goes, Ristar is actually a pretty darned playable title. It might not quite be up there with the Earthworm Jims and Dynamite Hea. ddys of the world, but it's doubtful anyone actually purchasing this title will be disappointed.

Team 17 dusts its rocks off once more for this sparkling CD32 version of Asteroids wannabe... stardust alien breed tower assault he Amiga has always played host to some top coding talent and nowhere was that more evident than in Finnish programmers Bloodhouse's first product, Stardust. Famous for its incredible graphics, especially the 3D tunnel levels, Stardust was an excellent shoot-'em-up complete with seriously tough gameplay but surprisingly bombed when it was originally released at the tail end of '93. People who didn't play the game figured it was just a simple Asteroids clone and the relatively cheap .99 tag seemed to confirm this. Team 17 had faith though and signed the Bloodhouse team with Super Stardust being the result. Rendered and ray-traced 256 colour graphics, 12 channel sound and refined gameplay have been added to the original asteroids blasting, level linking tunnel sequences and underwater bonus levels so how does it shape up this time round?

I thought the graphics in the original were neat, but the AGA ones are far superior, and the tunnel sequences have been improved too. Add some membrane melting techno and you've got classic audiovisuals. OK, so the gameplay may essentially be Asteroids, but it's Asteroids with big shiny knobs on and variety is guaranteed thanks to the underwater sub-games and the always impressive tunnel levels.

"REVIEW CUG SNES Adventure/Simulation THQ Unconfirmed Out Now Game Boy version also available No other versions planned Fancy hanging around in a cramped submarine with a bunch of craggy old actors and a talking dolphin? Read on... iming is important for success in any field of entertainment. A movie released in August has little hope of taking the Christmas number one slot, and a joke told at the improper pace is likely to raise as many laffs as a fart at a funeral. So, it is with this concept in mind that THQ releases upon a wholly unsuspecting public Sea Quest DSV, based on the sub-aquatic antics from the not-sopopular TV 'spectacular that we'd all forgotten about because it hasn't been on our screens for donkey's. Like I said, it's all in the timing... seaquest dsv What should be the has. sle-free part of the game is made a pain by sniping subs that sap your energy. VERDICT Players start the game as a lowly second-class seaman with little actual responsibilities other than providing fresh cuppas for the captain. However, gamers are given an opportunity to earn their stripes via a number of simulation scenarios revolving in and around a submerged mining colony that is under constant threat of attack from deep-sea pirates. There are combat missions where the mining activities must be protected, rescue scenarios trapped miners running out of oxygen and such, and salvage runs where precious cargo must be retrieved. In each case it is up to the player to make best use of the DSV's capabilities and diverse selection of submersibles. To the victor belong the spoils of the chance to pilot the DSV itself. O deep joy! Your mission, should you choose to accept it: To squint at the screen and try to decipher this message. SNES As a total non-fan of the drudge-worthy series I was not expecting great things of this. And, to some extent, I was right. True the graphics and rendered touches are cool, and I can see that the large and diverse range of missions and tactical aspects would appeal to some. It's just that pace-wise it's bit too unhurried short spells of unexciting action followed by long periods of floating around a bit. Fans of the show might enjoy it, as might sim-heads, but the sedate play didn't do any 'fin' for me, in fact It gave me a 'haddock'. Sorry. ANDY MCVITTIE It's those subs again, sapping your vital energy. Will they ever go away?

Then Space Invaders was released on an unsuspecting public and the face of gaming was changed for ever. The world marvelled at the gameplay -rows and rows of alien scum to annihilate (and your own fortresses to hide behind). Finish off a whole screen of ETs and lo and behold, more appeared. Well now that wonder of technology has been transported to Game Boy with a souped-up arcade version playable through the Super Game Boy which allows you to play in colour, blackA Opt for Upright Cabinet and-white and stripy like it Mode and get a cack backused to be in the good ol' ground absolutely free! days, nostalgia fans. VERDICT hew-ee! With five games to describe and only half a page to do it in we'd better dispense with the preamble and get right on down to basics First up comes Ball a juggling act pure and simple. Your man is kitted out with arm extensions and the aim is to move left and right to prevent the balls hitting the floor. Vermin is a mole murdering exercise move left and right to the right position and the moles are mercilessly slaughtered as they raise their cute, innocent, little heads. Flagman is a rip-off of that sad sequence copying game, Simon. Our hero raises an increasing number of numbered flags and you have to follow and repeat the sequence. Manhole's a bit radical in that you can go left, right, up. down AND diagonal and the aim's to fill the manholes with your body to save some hapless passers-by from certain doom. Finally Cement Factory involves leaping around lifts and emptying cement mixers into lorries. Wow! A It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it. VERDICT SA VIVADERS SCORE ODBO A Cellophane mode is supposed to recreate those manky stripes you used to get in the original arcade version. Great GAME BOY I loved the Space Invaders coin-op, so I was looking forward to the Game Boy version. What a disappointment! The 'arcade' version playable through the Super Game Boy only means a few more aliens, a colour option and the choice to play in upright arcade cabinet mode. The original' mode on Game Boy has no frills but sadly it's not even as good as the 15-year-old original, which is unforgivable. Unfortunately, perhaps nothing remains a classic forever because flaws aside, you'll soon became bored with the repetitive gameplay. LUCY HICKMAN GAME BOY The original Game & Watch introduced millions of people to the world of Nintendo, apparently. Once introduced they promptly went out and bought a Master System, no doubt, if this cart is anything to go by we're talking dire here with a capital 'D', and excrement with a capital 'S'. Two of these games involve moving left or right and that is it; two radical devils that they are allow you to go up and down as well, while in the other you don't move at all! The max enjoyment you might wring out is five minutes one minute per game. LUCY HICKMAN E SPRUC INVADERS GAME Set your perfectly clear world awash with muddy orange in Original mode.

"REVIEW CVG SUV03030 SLAMDUNH MUUT1323 PUREZZ A Fakir (obviously a jokey name) also has teleportal powers. A500/600 Beat-'em-up Gremlin Interactive EUnconfirmed Out Now No other versions available HA1200 and CD32 versions planned Stepping into the Amiga's rather uncluttered beat-'em-up arena comes a new contender... on't worry, Shadow Fighting isn't like shadow boxing, oh no, in Gremlin's debut beat-'em-up there's no imaginary opponents, rather there's a respectable choice of 16 fighters to put through their Pacers, Opal Fruits or whatever. You can't just go and select any of the 16 players however, first of all you have to master the special moves and become a decent beat-'emupper as on Easy mode you can only choose the first six challengers. The more competent you become the more fighters you can challenge, the ultimate challenge being coming faceto-face with old Mr Shady himself. There is of course a plot, but there's about as much point to it as a pants on a nudist beach, but it manages to, in a convoluted fashion, incorporate fighters from numerous countries in the world, for example, Soria, who's a Belgium kick boxing champion; Yurgen, a German cop who'd look more at home on stage with the Village People and Fakir who originates from Pakistan and who has ancient secret magical powers. The most unique aspect of Shadow Fighter has to be Pupazz, who is basically a Mr Blobbyesque punch bag that you can play in training mode, and is the place to practice those special moves. But what do want from Gremlin, blood? Well, as the man in the burger bar sez, 'You got it'. Yes there's blood, but it's not quite in the quantities that you find in a certain other fighting game that's rather infamous in that department. A Practise your slamdunk special move on Pupazz in the training mode. Now where have I seen a selection screen like that before, eh? shadow fighter VERDICT DON'T FANCY YOURS MUCH Here in Beat-'em-upsville we have all sorts of beefy birds and blokes who glean enjoyment from the art of knocking the Paxo out of one another. But remember kids, don't try this at home, unless it's on your Amiga. A Khrome can manipulate his body's cellular structure, T1000 style. A C'mon, c'mon, don't just ninny around, give him a right kickin'.... A500/A600 When you think about how old the Amiga is, then the fact that decent games can still be churned out for it is fairly remarkable. The thing is though, your console owning mates might not think much of your Amiga best-'em-ups when they've got a quite exhaus. tive selection for their own machines. Shadow Fighter is of course totally derivative of Street Fighter, in terms of plot and even some of the moves. That doesn't detract from the fact that shadow Fighter is a very decent beat-'em-up, specially for the Amiga 500, but nothing amazing. GARY LORD BIU Salvador's back flip is reminiscent of Blanka's.

"CVG REVIEW MEGADRIVE 32X I Beat-'em-up Sega .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned BX cosmic carnage ALTERNATIVE MEGADRIVE/SNES/AMIGA /GAME GEAR/GAME BOY Mortal Kombat II Acclaim/Various It may not be out on 32X until March, but Probe's 16 bit version shows how a beat-'em-up should be done. Ooh, that'll smart like hell in the morning... ISSUE 157: 93% No, it isn't a story of intergalactic butchers, it's a beat-'em-up for Sega's new add-on. Oh joy... magine a scenario which mixes the best bits of 'Escape From New York' with 'The Poseidon Adventure' (but without Shelley Winters playing the Kurt Russell role) and voilÃ , Cosmic Carnage, the first beat-'em-up for 32X. Carnage draws its scenario from countless sci-fi films and virtually every beat 'em up released. A prison ship has run into trouble, and the guards have fled in the escape pods leaving the villains to await their doom. However, one of the guards didn't quite make it to the pod (1 can see it now: if I could just... reach... the.. po...), leaving one of the eight crims with a possible way out. Thus, seeing as these are crims of the old school who wouldn't shoot you without asking first, they decide to fight for the pod in a series of timed battles. The only rule being the last person standing gets to have a pop at freedom. Thus, controlling any one of the eight mutant felons on offer, Carnage begins. In terms of content, we're in familiar territory: each character has several special moves on offer, and MKII fans will delight in the gore accompanying each death. Of the eight characters, four also come with Barbie-style accessories of heavy or light armour which affect hit power and speed respectively. Each fight lasts 100 seconds, and if this limit expires, the person with the most energy left wins. This is either a bizarre courtship ritual or the big guy has thrown the other. VERDICT A \"I won't jump through your hoop. Who d'you think you are, the Ringling Brothers?\" 32X I was hoping Sega's first 32X beat-'em-up would push back the boundaries of binary battling. Nope. This is a slow-paced and dull slugging match with the player getting to grips with repetitive moves in what amounts to who can press the most buttons fastest. It does draw ideas from Samurai Shodown and MKII, but the programmers have left out the good bits, leaving a tedious game that has neither excitement or variety. An awful game, and one which will only sell to 32X owners desperate for new stuff. Wait for 32X MKII. MARK PATTERSON The zoom mode in all its glory, focuses on Cylic as he shows off his heavy duty armour. The two armour types allow for different special moves. MONSTER MASH Cosmic Carnage's mutant fighters are a real bunch of weirdoes and range from a snake-like thing to a pummelling primate.

"REVIEW CVG Alaric Danja JAGUAR Beat-'em-up Atari .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned â JAGUAR So I tore your spandex disco suit so Kasumi!  Poor Quality New York Jokes Inc. Atari enters its contender into the Christmas console combat zone, but is this mutton dressed as Mortal? othing brings in the punters like a bit of gratuitous blood and violence. Which may be why Atari, actively seeking punters, sought to spice up the Jaguar's tame image with the lurid beat-'em-up action that is Kasumi Ninja. Following standard procedure, all the guys and gals have a series of special tricks up their sleeves (or under their kilts), with which to bombard the enemy. These are activated by a series of joypad movements, but strangely all incorporate the C button, keeping them separate from the standard punch/kick movements. The game also has a gore mode. Little more than blood (none of MKII's guts), there are various levels of intensity at which this may be set, with the most extreme having pints of the stuff raining from the ceiling. Atari has incorporated a parental lock, which ensures little Johnny cannot stick Kasumi on for cheap gratification. Unless they want him to, of course. Chagi The blood runs free, but is about as convincing as a Zombie Flesh Killers B-movie. But wait, isn't that banned? VERDICT Thundra's Raiden impersonation move. JAGUAR Kasumi Ninja is a pale imitation of some great beat'em-ups, the only relief being the occasionally Pythonesque on-screen elements. The nice backdrops are mostly static, and the purpose of digitising the characters from actors is defeated by meagre animation. But the game's mechanics are the greatest failing. The action is slow and the response so sluggish, I quickly resorted to repetitive longrange attacks, which the computer Al is unable to cope with on all but the highest difficulty setting. A highly unenjoyable game. ANGUS SWAN This is atypical of the specials in Kasumi. If they all showed this sort of initiative it might at least be funny. Angus is a champion tosser.

"CVG REVIEW SNES Racing Nintendo .99 Out February No other versions available No other versions planned upirally. 1:38: 17 A These arrows will throw the unicycle backwards if you attempt any stunts while racing over them. Get ready for turbo charged unicycle fun courtesy of the programming team behind Lemmings... Everything about this game is loud from the vivid primary colours to the noisy rock music. RACE VERDICT egend has it that Lemmings was rejected numerous times until Liverpool-based softco Psygnosis finally signed it. Big mistake by whoever said no since the title has been converted to virtually every current format and gone on to become one of the most successful games ever. Clearly realising DMA Design's talent, Nintendo wasn't going to make a similar error and has snapped up the team's latest offering. At first glance though, Unirally probably received similar puzzled looks to those who first saw Lemmings, after all who would have thought a decent game could be made starring unicycles? Still that's exactly what this is. Race your butt-aching cycle across the walkways in the quickest time possible either against the computer or a friend outdoing them in by performing stunts and grabbing speedboosting pick-ups. Building up a good head of speed is the key to victory. If you're not going fast enough you'll never clear the longer jumps. Pull of a particularly excellent stunt and you'll be rewarded with loads of bonus points plus an acceleration boost. Breaking up the frantic racing action are stunt tracks where the aim is to complete a certain number of moves before the time runs out. ADMA Design has managed to inject plenty of personality into the unicycles. Check out the way they shake their heads when losing or look behind when an opponent is close. SNES Whizzing round the colourful tracks at breakneck speed to the accompaniment of loud music is exhilarating at first, but then weaknesses become apparent. For a start there's little variety in the 20-odd tracks and most are too easy despite the three difficulty levels you'd have to be pretty crap not to complete two of them at your first attempt. The two player game is better and faster than Stunt Race's however, but is still hampered by the restrictive half screen view. Good fun, but not the Stunt Race FX beater it could have been. RIK SKEWS The two player mode is just as fast, but sometimes the split screen track can't keep up with the speed of the cycle which consequently zips off screen. A These spinning loopy sections are great fun and reminiscent of similar creations in the Sonic games. A There's usually one large jump per level and these offer the best opportunity to increase speed by performing plenty of stunts when you are airborne. 0:03: YOU GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 87 PLAYABILITY 86 VALUE 84 00 MICHELL OVERALL 0:03: ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE 32X Virtua Racing Deluxe Sega/.99 Tarty remake of the competent Mega Drive original; this features a couple of new cars and tracks and the same excellent gameplay.

And with no king the lords of the realm are engaged in a bitter struggle with one another to expand their small empires and take over the country. Into this mess of rivalry you take on the role of the lord of one of the counties whose task it is to slug it out with five other lords. Your task, like the other computer or human players, is to manage your population and tax them to build up enough money to allow the purchase of mercenaries and peasant armies to attack other counties. With more land it's possible to make more money, build bigger armies and capture more land and so on until you win the game. Naturally the other lords are trying to do the same to you... Of course it's not that simple. For starters managing land isn't easy as you have to contend with adverse weather (rain spoils crops), crop rotation, a population who don't like being taxed and you could be on the receiving end of another lord's ambitions. Then there are alliances to build, overpopulation problems and emigration! There are also traders to buy and sell to, alliances to form and transporting goods between your different counties to deal with; a lord's life is not an easy one.

"CVG REVIEW AMIGA Football Renegade .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned Rik Skews thinks Sensible Soccer is the best game of all time, so how can this sequel possibly improve on it? ccer Stick to short passes when playing on ice as the ball becomes much more uncontrollable. ensi Soccer is my all time fave game and while I like the odd tackle with FIFA, especially the definitive 3D0 version, nothing will compare to the intuitive control system which Sensi offers. When I heard that a sequel was in the pipeline I was a little concerned, after all the gameplay was pretty much perfect. There were always a couple of niggles however, and thankfully these have been ironed out in Sensi World. For a start the game became too easy once the play mechanics were mastered, even against classy Series A opposition. Now the player's defence will know if they're playing a world class team; equally, if the player is controlling Bergkamp and Gullit expect plenty of balls to hit the back of the onion bag. And the areas on the pitch where goals could be scored, even from 50 yards, have been erased too. Players can now be injured, with varying degrees of severity, though thankfully it's unusual for them to be out for more than four matches. There are many more tactics available too and up to six new ones can be created, either from scratch or from editing prestored ones. The major change with Sensi World though, is the optional management section. It's possible to take control and play just about every major worldwide football league side and enter every cup competition from just about anywhere in the world. The attention to detail is astonishing: every team has the correct players, in their right position, their specialist skills, value and even accurate barnet and skin colour! Players can be bought and sold too and if you make enough cash wheeling and dealing and have considerable success on the field, they'll eventually be offered the job of managing the country's team and taking part in a completely new competition like the World Cup! YOU OK KEUKE A Savour those goalscoring moments since it's much harder to score here than in the first Sensible Soccer. A Players can now be injured and some injuries can keep a player out for an entire season, though four matches is probably more like it. That's Ryan Giggs on the ball. He may be highly expensive but his pace and control soon pays for itself. GAME BY SENSIBLE SOFTWARE CONTACT RENEGADE (0171-481 9214) FOR INFORMATION "

Pull on some tights and daub yourself in blue paint 'cos four Smurfs need to be rescued in Infogrames' platform licence... What I could never understand about life in Smurfland was how Smurfette never had a bloke, despite the fact she was the only female around. Perhaps it was because she was blue and not much of a looker, who knows? What I do know is that this is the latest smurfs conversion from French sofco Infogrames, following on from the fairly well received SNES original. Unsurprisingly, the game takes the form of a traditional platformer where the player is cast as Hefty Smurf and must attempt to rescue four of the little blue ones who've been er... Smurfnapped by the evil Gargamel. Numerous cartoonlike worlds have to be traversed and the look and feel of the game is very similar to Namco's creaky old Pacland coin-op. Breaking up the platform action are a number of Mode 7-style puzzle stages reminiscent of Konami's clasSIC Axelay, which is quite an impressive technical achievement on the Mega Drive. The smurfs each have their own special talents which are exploited to solve puzzles are clear hazards. It worked for Lost Vikings, but whether or not people will want a similar thing with Smurfs, is a question that will shortly be answered. VERDICT MEGA DRIVE The Mega Drive has played host to a number of classic platformers lately, like Sonic and Knuckles, Mickey Mania and Dynamite Headdy. Sadly The Smurfs is just another trite bog standard title. There's nothing new or original in the gameplay or audiovisual presentation that I haven't seen countless times before.

The aim of the game is very simple: choose to be either Wario or a Bomberman and then plant bombs to blast your way out of walled-up corners in a maze-like environment, head towards the enemy and blow him up by catching him in your line of fire before he can do it unto you. A feature of great excellence in this Game Boy version is that, by using the Super Game Boy and a multitap, you can have fast and frantic four-player action. Bombs ahoy!

The graphics and sound are fab and the speed, responsiveness and difficulty setting are pitched just right, so that frustration never even starts to creep in.

"REVIEW CVG GAME GEAR Platform Sega .99 Out February No other versions available No other versions planned There's simple puzzle elements throughout Legend of Illusion. Here the S blocks must be manipulated to move the N ones so Mickey can stand on them. Do you always find that Sega + Mickey = lots of games sold, discuss... Mickey's world gradually clears of cloud as he progresses through the levels. 10 ickey Mouse has the sort of reputation that dear old Cliff Richard would be envious of. Not only is he something of a goody goody but just about everything he appears in turns out to be quality stuff, plus he's really old but still looks young (well one out of three ain't bad). Sega realised the pulling power of Mickey long ago and he's since starred in a host of quality titles, most notably Castle of Illusion. That title's knocking on somewhat though, but here comes a sequel of sorts, except Legend of Illusion is only on Game Gear for the time being rather than the Mega Drive, like the original. Created in conjunction with Disney the plot casts Mickey as a lowly laundry boy sent on a platform-based mission by the The Disney input is obvious, Mickey is well animated and the levels are packed 1 CUCKINGHAM legend of Illusion starring mickey mouse VERDICT Mickey can't hold his breath forever so keep an eye on the blue squares on bottom left. too-scared-to-do-it-himself King Pete. Mickey's aim is to find the water of life which will clear the land of the evil shadow hanging over it. On the way Mickey discovers his chums King Donald and King Goofy have been imprisoned and must be rescued too. Not only that but an advisor to King Pete tells him that whoever finds the water of life will be crowned the true king. Being the selfish type King Pete decides he must stop Mickey. With these odds stacked against him can Mickey possibly succeed, but more to the point would he want to? GAME GEAR A lot of Game Gear soft. ware has been cack this year but Legend of Illusion is rather good. Graphically it captures the Disney charm and the gameplay is a mix of standard platform run-and-splat action and more puzzle-based elements where Mickey has to manipulate background objects in order to progress. It's not just run and jump though, Mickey gets a chance to swim, climb etc. Sadly the variety of Legend of Illusion is let down by the game being far too easy there's little pleasure in returning to completed levels.

"CVG Q&A HELP! As Elvis once sang 'If you've got a problem, don't care what it is... er, I can help'. Anyway, that's irrelevant, because we do care what it is. We're not all that bright, so we're only going to field queries regarding games and hardware. If you've got one, try writing to HELP! CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. We regret to announce that we can't reply personally (unless you're in Baywatch). JAG SUPPLY A One of our fave games of '94 has to be Gentleman Jim here. He's the worm you should get out for the birds, apparently. BEST GAMES HELP I have recently upgraded to a Jaguar, which I think is an absolutely brilliant machine. But why is it that there are not many stockists of the Jaguar? | also have some questions to ask you. Simon Illegible, No address. 1 What do you think of Kasumi Ninja on the Jaguar looks absolutely brilliant. CVG: Read the review (page 77) in this very issue for our thoughts and comglents. 2 I have heard there is a cheat for Cybermorph. cvg: There may indeed be a cheat for Cybermorph, yes. We certainly have to concede that point. 3 Any chance of anyone making a Jaguar magazine? It would come in handy for people like me. CVG: None at all right now. But hey you never can tell in this day and age. 4 Can you print some more info on the Jaguar please. There are quite a few people that are very interested in this new console. CVG: Could you be a little more specific? What kind of Information exactly? We review all the Jag games w get and that's about all there is to write about. DEAR CVG. I'm getting a Mega Drive soon so could you please, please answer my questions? Thanks very much for all your help. Barry Williams, Eire 1 I remember hearing about a Mega Drive racing yolk. When will this contraption see the light of day and how much is it going to cost? CVG: Don't hold your breath waiting for a UK release as it looks unlikely to be officially released over here ever. 2 What's the best Mega Drive platform game, apart from Dynamite Headdy and Sonic & Knuckles? CVG: Earthworm Jim (In Rad's opinion Ed.). 3 Will Mega Drive games soon be phased out after the release of the Saturn? CVG: No, because there are still millions of Mega Drive owners across the world perfectly willing to part with money for new games, Where there's brass there's games, you know. 4 Is the Quickjoy foot pedal still available to buy in shops? CVG: No, but you're not exactly missing much. 5 What's the best shoot-'emup on the Mega Drige? CVG: Gunstar Herpes is probably the best, but it has a hefty platform element too. Otherwise yod can't go wrong with Jungle Strike, Red Zope or the rather elderly (but still brilliant) Biohazard Battle. If you can find it. 6 Is Mega Bomberman worth getting if you're going to be playing it on your own most of the time? CVG: There are better oneplayer games around, but it's certainly not bad solo, PS Am I the only person on Earth that doesn't hate the Jaguar joypad? CVG: Yes. Why, did you design it or something? The Jag has had a quiet month on the release front this month. DAZED AND CONFUSED Fighter 2. Virtua Fighter and Ridge Racer (that doesn't make the question very easy does it?) Please print this letter because there are a lot of people out there, who must be warned about technology. Martin Collyer, Redditch, Worcs DEAR HELP! I'm writing to you about the speed games technology seems to be changing these days. I'm thinking of moving into the new world of consoles, but there's that many brilliant new machines coming out at the moment that my head feels like it's going to explode just thinking about it and I just don't know what to buy. The Super Nintendo hasn't been out that long (only about three years and now Nintendo is bringing out the Ultra 64, which I must admit looks some kind of wicked. Also there's the Sega Saturn, 3DO, CD32, Sony PlayStation. Jaguar and Philips CD player (I think that's all of them). Also I've heard news about a 64 bit CD-i coming out. Before you know it Sega will be announcing some new 64 bit Mars and Nintendo will be telling you about their new Ultra Super Doopa 128. Now I know you might think I'm some old grandad, but I'm not and I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who feel a bit confused too. Also, out of all the new machines which one do you think I should go for? My favourite games at the moment are Mortal Kombat, Street CVG: Interestingly enough, the theory of technophobia has been with us for a couple of decades, and suggests that eventually technology will evolve too rapidly for the average person to understand. This will, supposedly, lead to a revival of neo-Ludditism and paranoia. Or, alternatively, it might just mean you end up buying a Sinclair Spectrum 128 instead of a Nintendo Ultra Super Doopa 128. Anyway, if you're not sure which console to buy DON'T BUY ONE YET. Keep reading the mag, check out the reviews and only when you've seen a sufficient number of games you like on any of the machines should you make a measured purchasing decision. They're awful ly expensive, you know. 86 "


"CVG SATURN CARTS DEAR SIRS, I am thinking of purchasing a Sega Saturn and on page nine in issue 157 of your mag noticed what looks like a cartridge facility on Sega's new console. If this is the case will it be a 16 or 32-bit; and if 32 bit will it run 32X games such as Doom? Paul Owen, Port Talbot BEST ON THE SNES CVG: There is indeed a cartridge port and, like the rest of the machine, it's 32 bit. You see, the processor is 32bit, it's got nothing to do with the car tridge port or the CD drive. Anyway, it isn't, sadly, compatible with 32X games on sale over here, and never will be since the 32X isn't out in Japan. As for whether US and UK Saturns will be backwardly compatible with the 32X we shall have to wait and see (but we very much doubt it). TO HELP! 1 What game do you prefer out of the SNES versions of: Earthworm Jim, Donkey Kong Country, MK2 and Kick Off 3? CVG: Personally, I'd put them in the order of Mortal Kombat 2, Earthworm Jim, Donkey Kong Country, Kick Off 3. However, some people would disagree about the order of the middle two Rad. 2 When will the SNES 32-bit add-on be released? and what will be the estimated price? CVG: Don't wait up. 3 Is the Super Game Boy worth buying? CVG: Only If you've already got an extensive Game Boy collection and you use lots of expensive batteries. 4 What d'you think is the best platform game on the SNES? CVG: It's still Mario World, which is saying something I sup. pose, but Donkey Kong is well worth a purchase. Cheers. Arli, Surrey Those of you who're thinking that 32x games are going to be compatible with Sega's Saturn, forget it. A If you've a question on any of the new machines then send them in and we'll put you right. NEW CONSOLE DATES DEAR CVG I hope you'll answer my questions about the next generation consoles and their games as I am currently deciding which of the three new machines to buy. lan N Cottam, Doncaster, S Yorks. 1 Have you got any UK release dates for the Sony PlayStation, the Sega Saturn and Nintendo's Ultra 64? CVG: Saturn and PlayStation will most probably be released next autumn, although there are no firm dates as yet. Ultra 64 is unlikely to see the light of day in Japan until then (or after), so an official UK release is a long way off. 2 Which, in your opinion, is the best, Cruis'n USA, Daytona or Ridge Racer? CVG: Daytona is definitely the most fun in the arcades. 3 How much will the PlayStation, the Saturn and the Ultra 64 cost when they're released officially in the UK? CVG: No idea, to be honest, although we'd expect prices of around -400 for Saturn and PlayStation. 4 Have you any idea what games will be bundled with the three new machines? CVG: Well, the relevant companies have nearly a year to decide, so we're not sure. Import machines are bundled with whatever games the importer has been able to get hold of. 5 Which, in your opinion, is shaping up to be the best the PlayStation, the Saturn or the Ultra 64? CVG: Hey Why don't you read our amazing Next Generation (which starts on page 16) feature this very issue and make up your own mind? It's always much more fun. 6 Will Namco release Ridge Racer 2 on the PlayStation? If so, will it be better than Daytona, Gale Racer and Cruis'n USA? CVG: Let's hope they do release it, but we can't tell what kind of a job it would make of the conversion. Or what Ultra 64 Cruis'n USA will be like either. But they can't be much worse than Gale Racer which is a dog. 82 "


"CVG TIPS JAGUAR CHEAT MODE DOOM Mr Karl Anderson of Lowestoft, Suffolk has kindly thought to send us a list of in-demand cheats for this fantastic title. To warp to any level between one and nine, simply press and hold the corresponding num. ber on the joypad and then Pause. If you fancy a level beyond this realm, press and hold A then Pause for level 10, or B then Pause for level 20. If this isn't good enough, hold # then press Pause twice for all keys, full ammo, 200% armour rating and all weapons. If you still can't get anywhere then you must be utterly crap. The new year is upon us, and no doubt you've already broken all of your resolutions, and promised your parents, girlfriend et al that you're going to spend less time playing games and hopefully they'll stop their nagging. Well, here's how to spend less time on your games as we help you complete them that bit quicker courtesy of our handy hints and tips section... MEGA-CD MEGA DRIVE SNATCHER Blimey, a decent Mega-CD games that isn't by Core Design, can't remember the last time we saw one of these. Anyway for a number of interesting events far too numerous to go into here, try entering the following names into the Jordan Computer Systems at Junker Headquarters: MICHAEL, KIMBERLY, KIRITA, KOJIMA, SASAKI, TOGO, JEREMY, SAITOU, INAMARU, ADACHI, KUSHIBUCHI and NOSE Even better here's a list of incredibly useful numbers for use on the Metal Gear MK2 Videophone, including Isabella's. For maximum effect dial these numbers several times. PROBOTECTOR Paul Bergen of Saltley, Birmingham sent us a rather cocky letter about him being hard, the upshot of which was this pretty topper secret level for Probotector on the Mega Drive. On the third level, after you defeat the half-way boss made of junk go past the security gun pods until you reach the two security gates before you get to the hacker. Don't shoot the gates, but instead jump on to the wall above the first one. Walk up and you should see a ledge with a man perched atop. He'll ask you if you'd like to earn some money. Say yes and you'll find yourself in an arena fighting a string of bosses which would be more at home in Dynamite Headdy, which sounds like jolly good fun. Sasaki: 79-6641 Jeremy: 41-6766 Togo: 44-6454 Inamura: 44-3723 Kushibuchi: 33-3333 Isabella: 39-6004 Cupid Love Line: 39-0910 SNES MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE 32X POWER RANGERS OK, I'm sure there are some Power Ranger sad gits out there who've bought this game and who subsequently want the following tipette. 0411 1007 1212 DOOM Huzzah, it's the great cheat for the greatest game yet on Sega's new mushroom thing. To be come invincible PAUSE the game and press X, Z, MODE and UP all at the same time. And for infinite ammo PAUSE again but press UP, A, C and MODE. I knew that Mode button would come in handy sooner or later. SNES SHINING FORCE 2 This game is concrete proof that the dear old Mega Drive is just as capable of handling a decent RPG as the SNES. The journey is long and tough though, so to make life a little easier here's a neat cheat from Mr Boutros to access a secret cheat configuration screen. At the Sega (SEGA!) logo, press UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, B, START. SPARKSTER It's amazing how much better this is on the SNES, compared to the Mega Drive version. To see all the levels with out the hassle of playing them press UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A on the title screen. 88 "


"TIPS CVG MEGA DRIVE AMIGA ECCO 2 Ah, Ecco is a sweet old thing isn't he, and might even make me switch to dolphin-friendly tuna. Still, while he's cute and soft, the game he's starring in is as hard as nails so this cheat should make things a little easier. When playing the game PAUSE it when Ecco is turning and press A, B, C, B, C, A, C, A, B for a programmer's debug mode which allows you to alter just about every parameter in the game. GAME BOY JAMES POND 3 A1200 The best version of this class platformer is to be found on the A1200 and thanks to D Buxter of Nottingham you can quickly skip through the levels and see how great it is if you're not the patient type. From anywhere in the game simply type \"NIGHTMARE', then pressing F10 will bring up a cheat menu with numerous options. CERPTOR SNES MEGA DRIVE EARTHWORM JIM As all students know, worms are a great source of protein and judging by Virgin's effort capable of being turned into an excellent computer games character. Anyway, if you're looking for unlimited ammo for Jim then PAUSE when in a game and press A, B, B, B, C, A, C, C. THE LION KING Never mind whether you can feel the love tonight, more to the point can you finish this game tonight? Maybe if you use this handy cheat for a debug mode. On the OPTIONS screen press B, A, R, R, Y and a menu with all the useful cheat options will appear. SNES MORTAL KOMBAT II Here's a fantastic cheat which allows you to play as the plump Goro. Once you've beaten all the characters hold UP, LEFT, SELECT and A. Now enter your initials in the high score table and the next time you play the game you'll be Goro. Huzzah! YOGI BEAR Here's how you go about skipping through the levels, thanks to this cool cheat from Danny B Boy again. On the title screen press UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, Y, B, UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, B, Y, UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, START. 50% PC CD-ROM GAME GEAR tx1130 SHINING FORCE 2 All credit to Sega for managing to cram this neat but bulging RPG into such a small place, but it's arguably as good as its 16 bit cousin. For a handy cheat on the character-naming screen highlight END and press 2 and START at the same time. Thank you. AMIGA RISE OF THE ROBOTS Ron Graham of Cinderhill, Notts, has brought two count 'em) ace cheats for this game to our attention. The first allows you to select The Supervisor when training or playing in two-player mode. On the menu screen move your joystick from Left to right a couple of times, but not too fast. The screen should flash, which indicates that the cheat has been activated. The second cheat is activated with the same technique, but this time moving the joystick and hitting the keys rapidly. Actually, it's not much of a cheat, since it merely initiates a two-player match with Military droids, but it's better than nothing. Cheers anyway, Ron. CANNON FODDER A few readers have rung in of late asking where the massive hidden stash of bazookas are, so being the good wholesome people we are here it is once again.

"CVG REVIEWS supershorts ass These are the games we didn't have room to review. Except here, of course, where they are given the treatment known as supershorts... mega drive nc super nes_ IDEMON'S CREST DC ALL NEW WORLD OF LEMMINGS DAFFY DUCK IN HOLLYWOOD DC LACES OF THE DEEP DREAMWEB SI 62 Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts 2 this ain't. in fact this is a mix of platform tomfoolery and RPGing, and It's a piece of cake to complete the game on your first go, with only the bosses posing any sort of a threat. It's not even interesting enough to return to once you've beaten it. Avoid heartily. Unconfirmed If there's one thing there's a lot of on the Mega Drive it's platform games. Here's another one with Daffy running round various movie-themed levels until you catch up with some evil henchman. It's not as good as any of the others, even the crap ones. That's all you need to know. .99 Wahey! It's an 'adult' adventure. Plenty of the ole nudge, nudge, wink, wink etc. Well, pervs out there shouldn't get too excited because the graphics for Dreamweb are utterly crap. The plot's pretty good though, and as a whole it should appeal to most players. Unconfirmed The subject matter (submarine simulation) means that by definition this is going to be slow and limited. It is, but it's also quite tense (which is something for a simulation these days) as you take charge of a German U-Boat trying to sink Allied merchant ships. One for genre fans only. .99 SA No it's not, it's all the old same lemmings faffing around as it always was. The concept was great and quite revolutionary four years ago, but it's starting to look dated now. Still, if you're that into Lemmings you'll probably buy this anyway. Go ahead. We just don't care anymore. .99 mega drive super nes BONKERS BLACKHAWK DC WARCRAFT mega drive super nes POWER RANGERS | ARDY LIGHTFOOT BO BT Sega has designed Bonkers for younger players and is no doubt going to be marketed as such, but that's still no excuse for the four limited and simplistic games that are on offer here. Most kids should be capable of handling Sonic at least it certainly has a lot more mileage in it than this. .99 While the control method Ã  la Flashback takes quite a bit of getting used to, once you've settled down this is a superb explorative shoot-'em-up with some amospheric graphics and great sound. Don't be put off by the high difficulty setting or the sedate pace and check this out. .99 Unoriginal but ultimately challenging strategystroke-God game. You take control of two races who are at war with one another. It's slow to get started and it's perfectly likely that you'll already have one or more games of this type (ie Populous), but Warcraft is certainly worth checking out. .99 Morphtastic cash-in potential! Power Rangers follows the TV series very closely insofar as it's absolutely terrible. Only a complete moron would pay money for this cackhanded and unplayable beat-'em-up, made worse by the fact that the game only utilises two of the joypad's firebuttons. .99 Ardy Lightfoot is the lowest common denominator of the platform genre. In this game you will find plenty of bright bouncy backgrounds, bright bouncy characters and themed levels. Nowt, in fact, that you haven't seen or done better before. Very boring in the extreme. .99 ms super nes_ ms ILION KING super nes pc NOCTROPOLIS DAFFY DUCK IN HOLLYWOOD | LIBBLE RABBLE I NOSFERATU 25 BE Whilst Daffy features few new ideas or novel concepts, this master System version is far more playable than its Mega Drive counterpart and has less competition on the games shelves. You might find yourself getting a wee bit bored by the end, but this is actually quite good fun. Unconfirmed B16 A deceptively simple puzzle game (and incredibly lame graphics and sound also) concerning two gnomes and their magic tape. OK, it looks absolutely hideous, but it more than makes up for everything by being incredibly playable. Definitely worth a look for its gameplay element. EUnconfirmed Strangely, the Master System has had quite a good run of things since Sega dropped it in Japan. The Lion King is another solid quality platform title which gets the edge over Daffy Duck for this month's best purchase accolade for the Master System, and is far better value than the Mega Drive game. .99 Billed as Prince of Persia with a beat-'em-up element, this is in fact an unresponsive and uninteresting crock. Not big enough, too predictable and unoriginal, Nosferatu is a case of style over substance; the control method is painful and the levels are all standard fare I'm afraid. Unconfirmed Despite a rather weird control system which takes some getting used to, this is a highly atmospheric adventure in the Gabriel Knight mould. Some might say it's a bit easy, but this is more than made up for by the involving gameplay and the horrifying graphics. Pretty ace. .99 90 "

"CVG COMPETITION the best ever BIG EDS the best ever footy game compo The editors of Britain's top computer and console magazines tell us what games have molested their fancy this month.. Andy McVitie, Editor This month's fave game is Nintendo Magazine System Unirally, which is brilliant! It's the first game in ages to have given me good old Nintendo thumb from constant bashing on the joypad. Something else that's been keeping me busy is NBA Jam Tournament Edition, which is like the original only better.... Steve Merrett, Editor Yep, Saturn Fever has hit the Mean Machines good ship MEAN MACHINES, with the likes of Clockwork Knight taking up more time than they should. The Mega Drive hasn't been ignored either, with Jelly Boy deserving special praise for its bellybouncing japery. Tis a pity about the crap 32X relases, however.... Richard Leadbetter, Editor Although 32x and the incredible Sega Magazine Saturn have been hogging the headlines, there's been a fair amount of quality 16-bit wares released in the meantime. One that looks superb is The Adventures of Batman and Robin on Megadrive. It looks great, and it sounds plays excellently. It's going to be big. Some claim to fame, eh? But we have seen more football games than anyone else and Konami's International Superstar Soccer is the most brilliant ever game of its kind. Guess what? There's one copy of the game on SNES to be won for each of five lucky winners, plus the overall winner will also get a football strip of their choice. 00000000 Alan Dykes, Editor Mortal Kombat ll may be more CU Amiga of an \"event\" but I've been playing Shadow Fighter. It's a very down-to-earth game of the beat-'em-up variety with long-term playability, lots of characters and more to come on a data disk. The game's a pleasant surprise: Gremlin only acquired it a month ago People aren't used to having Andy Nuttall, Editor The One for Amiga Games good cutesy platformers on the Amiga, but with Boo from MicroProse in development that might change. MicroProse did very well out of Impossible Mission 2025, and it wasn't particularly good so if Boo tums out to be as nice as it looks it'll do well for itself. And your question is... How long has Gary Lineker been in Japan? Wing Commander 3 most defiDavid Upchurch, Editor PC Games nitely. For a start it's got Mark (Luke Skywalker) Hamill in it, plus, although it's not genuinely interactive, it feels like a movie, sets a high standard in direction, and unlike many games which use live action sequences, the sets aren't made of old egg boxes. Answers on an old unwanted Christmas card or a stuck-down envelope to: \"I'm a star, I'm a superstaaar\" compo, Computer and Video Games, EMAP Images, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London ECIR 3AU by March 15th. Please state your chosen team kit and let us know whether you're wafer thin, ordinarysized or rotund. Christina Erskine, Editor I was hoping for thrills with the PC Review PC version of Voyeur, a nudgenudge game which promises lots of, er, 'action'. Sadly, it was an empty tease, but hey, I'm not bitter I also managed to nab a copy of the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit and I've been redesigning all my SimBuildings ever since. Steve James, Managing Editor Last month we said Virtua Computer and Video Games Fighter was the best first game for a new machine in a dog's ages. And so it was until this issue when Ridge Racer on PlayStation came our way. You'd have to be some mad bugger of a driver to keep on the road in the advanced stages of the game but you'd have to be mad full stop not to be wowed by it at all!!!
