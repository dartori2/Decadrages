"EDITOR TIM BOONE Sunning himself on some faraway paradise isle during his hois. Tim stunned the locals with loads of amazing bits and bobs on his Gameboy and tried to persuade them it was worth a lot more than a second-hand sunbed and two takeaway ke. babs. He failed. ED FIRST All relaxed (and sporting a luvverly tan, girls!) after his hols in Greece, the man they call Mr Boone gives YOU the lowdown on what's HOT! HOTI HOT! in this month's CVG! DEPUTY EDITOR PAUL GLANCEY Sadly, this is Paul's last month as CVG's illustrious Dep Ed. It's ginger and salt 'n shake crisps all round as our multi-talented maestro packs his suitcases and stays exactly where he is. What's he up to? Well, it's something new, exciting and dead sexy OK girls? NEWS Phew! It's been a busy month since we last left you clue yourself up on exactly what has happened in Computer Game Land since the last CVG! YOB'S MAILBAG 38 It's holiday time, and YOB has packed up and toddled off to sunnier climes for a spot of sun, sea and sadism. So who's manning the store while the man tops up his tan? You'll never guess!!! ART EDITOR JON BILLINGTON It was big hugs all round when Liverpool's liveliest lad popped home to see his mum. Then our resident motorbike tan announced he'd bought a VW Polo and spent the next few weeks wondering why it's got four wheels, where the handlebars are and why he just can't get his leg over... SADIE'S SCORERS 79 She's mad! She's bad! Her scores are rad! Are YOU one of the privileged few to make your mark in the high-score table to beat all others? PREVIEWS 122 We've got the sequel to F19 Stealth Fighter! We've got the sequel to Gunship! We've got the Megadrive conversion of a classic computer game! In short, there's everyuthing in this month's Previews so read 'em! STAFF WRITER PAUL RAND What does CVG's resident lady killer do when he spots Page Three stunna Kathy Lloyd jiggling about in a pub? Simple he chats her up with another of his witty one-liners. \"S'cuse me, can I borrow your ashtray?\" stutters our man Rand, who denies he was wearing The Sun's giveaway 3D glasses at the time...

He's the Ultimate Warrior, star of Sky TV's WWE Wrestling soon to appear on a Nintendo console near you ADDITIONAL LAYOUT YVETTE NICHOLS Life's been just a load of old bulls for CVG's caring Kiwi ever since she went to Spain and witnessed a bullfight at first hand! Does the fact that she didn't enjoy it have anything to do with the fact she wore a red dress? Honestly, I ask you... Challenge MANAGING EDITOR JULIAN RIGNALL Life's been tough for Mister Mean Machines. With all sorts of special projects on the go our Jools still found time to burn up in the sun watching Nigel Mansell burn up the track. A few days breather in Wales and he came back full of all the local custom, charm and unspeakable swear words the talts know and love. "


"Another truly gripping slice of.... ED-FIRST HELLO! It was incredible, honest. There we were, beaveTring away on the mag when in swaggers the Ultimate Warrior, slams his fist down on the table and threatens to flatten the lot of us unless we preview the new WWF Nintendo megagame! Well, what would you do? Ruin your underpants and call for mummy, run screaming from the room or tell to stop Paul Rand to stop pillocking about, take off that make-up and get on with our Exclusive WWF pull-out poster preview! That's just one of the amazing goodies packing this month's mag, including our scoop first review of the longawaited Super R-Type and other ace games including incredible Ice Hockey action from Electronic Arts, a full review of he brill Jimmy White Snooker and all sorts of other amazing bits 'n' pieces. By the way, there will soon be a new man in town here at CVG and his name is Frank O'Connor. A certified games freak, first-class journo and very nice bloke, Frank steps in as Deputy Editor from next month. What's happening to the heroic Paul Glancey, I hear you cry. Well, Paul's getting involved in something so goosepimplingly exciting it has to stay Top Secret for now. Watch this space and all will be revealed. So until next month... Byeeeee.

"NEWS! VIRTUAL WORLDSS. ACTIVISION LAUNCH NINTENDO GOODIES   Like a number of other American Nintendo developers, Activision see Europe as a budding and bountiful console market, and consequently they'll be launching a number of new NES games between now and Christmas. The four we've seen already are Rad Gravity (an oddball inter-planetary arcade adventure). Ultimate Air Combat (an unusual mix of Afterburner and Xevious), Galaxy 5000 (a wacky road race game set in space) and Die Hard (not surprisingly, a game of the film). Activision don't know when the games will be released or at what price because Nintendo are still putting them through their rigorous quality control. From what we ve seen, though, there should be no misgivings about the quality of these games, they're all extremely impressive. NES fans, watch outfull reviews soon! VIRTUALLY REAL GOOD VALUE This Virtual Reality business gets everywhere doesn't it, and the definition of Virtual Reality seems to be getting broader, too, because both Elite and Domark are releasing compilations of old 3D games on the back of the buzz word. Virtual Reality Volumes 1 and 2 are Elite's contribution and they both feature a strong lineup of titles. Volume 1 consists of Midwinter (acel).

"REVIEW FAMICOM .00 BY IREM Arcade addicts across the world can finally stop holding their breath Super R-Type is here at last! After months of near-fran. tic anticipation, Irem's conversion of their legendary coin-op touches down on the Super Famicom. Anybody who failed to witness the incredible R-Type saga in the arcades must need their head examined. R-Type literally blew away the competition when it first appeared breaking new ground in game design and shaking the world of shoot 'em ups right to the core. Featuring truly gorgeous graphics pick-up weapons, bolt-on shields, amazing end-of-level basses and a driving sound track, the machine quickly guzzled up everybody's loose change and established itself as on of the greatest blasts of all time Could anybody do better? After dozens of painting rip-of trem Themselves unleashed R-Type Il to supplne fix the fans were so desperate for. Taking all the best bits am the original leaving the plot basically the same. R-Type Amproved the quel of the enemy and weapons availaible to blow them back to bits Countless conversions, cores and rip-offs of R-Type have al ready made it onto home computers and connes the best bar probably.ort the PC Engine. Moecently Action picked up the license to pe land turned in a competentnoduct to keeplans LEVEL 3: Here your ship magically transforms into a kind of submarine to take on the worst of the aliens in a subterranean showdown of epic proportions! Bol everybody's been waiting for this official Super Famicom conversion promising a perfect clone of R-Type ll with a bones level thrown in. So alter all the hype and the very long wait, how does Super Type measure up BLASTING STAGE BY STAGE Super R-Type features a grand total of seven levels that's one more than R-Type Il in the arcades. The bonus stage comes right at the beginning, so here's the gen on the worlds of action just waiting to be beaten: S ROT LEVEL 1: Completely new, the action takes place out in space, complete with strange-looking space clouds and other weird and wonderful things. LEVEL 2: Stage one on the original, here you take on great leaping space bugs which throw huge missiles in your direction and all manner of flying nasties against a tech-mech background. The most eagerly awaited Famicom game has finally surfaced, but is it the blaster to end 'em all, or was all the talk just a lot of hot air? Well, you can see from the screenshots that Nintendo's 16-bit wonder has excelled itself in recreating the coin-op's highly detailed graphic style, capturing all the sprites and backdrops perfectly and even including a brand new level for the home version. It's only on sitting down to play Super R-Type that you begin to notice the flaws. For instance, the scrolling isn't nearly as smooth as it could have been (it's been said that you don't notice the jerkiness when you're playing, but I did). Also, horror of horrors, there's an abominable slow-down when there are a lot of sprites on-screen at the same time not what I'm looking for in software for the console to supposedly beat them all. The hard and fast in-game music compensated in some small way for the other deficiencies in Super R-Type, but when push comes to shove, were I to fork out for this cart would be feeling slightly cheesed off that it isn't the masterpiece it could have perhaps been. PAUL RAND 016 "


"_ REVIEW GPS2 BIG, BAD AND BOSSY Super R-Type features some of the meanest end-of-level bosses you'll find in a console game. here's a quick run-down on those scary fiends you'll find at the end of each stage... BOSS 2: A big-bellied Bydo beastie who fires swirling uglies and a whopping great laser blast from its stomach! PAUSE 2 PER BOSS 1: A spinning space horror who throws little balls of destruction in your general direction, but pretty easy to overcome. YPS BOSS 3: A snake-producing head thing so 'orrible you'll just have to blow him away before throwing up! LEVEL 4: Basically, a huge mother of a Bydo ship Is this level, complete with guns, cannon and bits which fly off in your general direction! LEVEL 5: Here you begin to enter the heart of the Bydo Em. pire, with moving wall defences and a whole fistful of enemies on red alert. LEVEL 6: Deeper into the core of Bydoland, here you have to make your way through a maze of defences and hostile horrors before the final challenge. LEVEL 7: Abandon hope all ye who enter here: this is the final level and toughest of the lot, with scary space snakes and tur. tles of terror to contend with before coming face to face with the ultimate challenge big bad Bydo. Like the world and his uncle, I've been waiting for Super R-Type for what seems like light years. Could it really be as good as everyone claimed? The answer just has to be no. Don't get me wrong, this is one hell of a good conversion and a great game but it just doesn't reach the standards you would expect of the official Super Famicom conversion of the arcade classic. The gorgeous graphics of the original are faithfully reproduced, the sound is excellent and the bonus level a real treat but there's something missing. Even this Irem conversion doesn't manage to reproduce the smooth arcade feel of the incredible original and on the Famicom that shouldn't be too much to ask. Occasionally some jerky backround scrolling can be detected and sometimes horror of horrors the sprites flicker! Generally speaking this is a fine game, but in my view a conversion of this magnitude ought to be flawless on a machine like the Famicom and perfect this ain't. Perhaps I ask too much, but the upshot is that my cotton socks are still firmly in place after everyone promised this would blow them off. . TIM BOONE "


"PO NEW co cacciato BOSS 5: A moving monster which slides around against the backdrop, forcing you to negotiate a maze and take him on at the same time! BOSS 4: A mechanical monster which blasts back from up to five different directions around the screen as you take pot shots and hope for a quick kill. SUI WELL HARD WEAPONS FOR WAGING WAR! ROT With an entire empire to contend with, you'll need some pretty hefty shooters to take on those Bydo baddies. Luckily enough there are sackfulls of 'em just waiting to be picked up at various stages throughout the game. Here's the full lowdown on the wonderful weapons at your command... POWER ARCS: These colourful arcs of death will quickly dispense with most of the minor baddies who stand in your way, but only fire in straight lines BEAMUP: By holding down the fire button, you can boost the charge of your front shooting beam to monstrous proportions. Blue beam will take care of most bad guys, but for end of level bosses hold down the button for a supercharged orange beam and unleash some real power! NOSE CONE: A seriously useful bit of kit, this can be bolted either to the front or back of your ship. Serving as a shield and highly effective ramming device. GUN: The bog-standard wea pon bolted to your ship from the start, its only use is to help you survive until something more useful comes along PODS: Prize possessions for the well-equipped space jockey, these little jokers hover just above and below your ship firing as well if you collect the right weapons! PHOTON TORPEDOS: Seriously usefull for napalming ground-based enemies, these flamers travel across the ground wasting everything in their path! BOMBS: Fairly straightfoward and, surprisingly, not all that useful. Still, who's complaining when they help you knock six bells out of alien scumbags? MISSILES: Much more interesting, these little cuties actually home in on Bydo bogies and blow them apart before their stupid brains work out what hit them. LASERS: Useful for wasting enemies hiding in those hardto-reach nooks and crannies, these bounce around the screen until they run out of power or run into something bad. "


"REVIEW : M o PER BOSS 6: A three-bit beastie, which means triple the trouble as it splits up to hassle you from all directions! BOSS 7: The biggest baddie of the Bydo, holding you buddies hostage and spawning little Bydo babies to boot. Blow this away to beat the game! SPEEDUP: Like the name says, these give your ship that extra zip. Be careful not to collect too many or you'll whizz around and fly out of controll D C D FAMICOM GRAPHICS SOUNDS 92 DIAVABILIT ASTABIL THANKS!

"tra REVIEW AMIGA .99 ER BY AUDIOGENIC Its a hard life, this space exploration Tark. But this mission is over, I and the navigation computers have been programmed for the return trip to Earth Time to lie back and wait... But things are never that simple. Monitors light up all over the ship. each one filled with the image of Columbus Force Commander Sprake, telling you of the escape of genetic scientist Triax, imprisoned in a space cell a century ago but now free, his life extended using his own experiments, his mission to create a race of maggots which will infest the universe and destroy all life within it. What else can you do but descend onto the planet Phoebus hunt down Triax and bring him to justice? Sounds simple, but as soon as you arrive, Triax beams aboard your craft, steals the Destinator navigation system from the control console and, before you can reach him, disappears into the void. So there's the aim find a way into Triax's underground lab. bring him to justice, then find the Destinator and blast off from Phoebus. Use the many items littered around the playing area to UPDATE assist in your quest, and above all, use your noddle hard prob lems require hard thinking before they can be solved. Exile is also available on Commodore 64 disk. The gameplay is almost exactly the same, and it's just as good! Wa-hey! >EX Ok, so Exile isn't the most graphically impressive game in the world on either Amiga or ST, but, as the adage goes, graphics maketh not a game, and this is most apt in the case of this product. Exile is a sprawling arcade adventure, quite unlike anything I've ever played, and Audiogenic's inclusion of save features to both disk and RAM is appreciated. Trying to control the jet-propelled main character is a job in itself, but that's nothing compared to the task ahead in this nippy (more so on the ST) exploration title. To begin with, everything seems far too obscure, so far as solving any problems goes, but perseverance is the key to success: there is usually one place which hasn't been visited and, sure enough, that's where the required item will be lurking. Arcade adventure fans should lock themselves away with a copy of Exile and not come out till they've completed it. PAUL RAND This looks completely duff. The graphics are so dull they don't look like an Amiga (or even an ST) and the little bloke appears to be nigh on uncontrollable, so it looks like there's nothing but frustration in store. BUT... Stick with it for a while and you will be surprised to find that this is a very compelling arcade adventure. The playing area is vast, but fortunately it's not so bland that everywhere looks the same and you're con stantly getting lost. As for the puzzles, they're equally varied, unusual and clever which makes Exile more interesting to play than many other games like it. What's also refreshing is that the game isn't all blasting robots, and most of the problems are caused by the planet's odd natural lifeforms the doves and Imps are particularly annoying. Arcade adventure fans are getting an awful lot of game for their money here, and you normals needn't be fooled by Exile's apparent ugliness It's a game of unusual depth which will keep anyone occupied for months to come.

C D  Not only are there killer robots and, of course, the dreaded Triax to contend with, but in Exile all manner of creatures abound to hamper and harm the budding bounty hunter. Many, such as the green birds, just flutter around and hem you into corners without causing any physical damage. But others, such as doves and wasps, home in on you and don't let up until they're either blown to bits or they've kitted you out with wings and sent you to join the Choir Invisible. There are also some cute frogs playing in one of the ponds quite what their use is, if any, is yet to be established, but it is fun to pick them up and drop them into fires! \"Oh my gosh! Bees. Bees! They reall around me!\" JET-POWERED JAPES Phoebus is an enormous place, and to walk everywhere would not just take a very long time, it would also play hell with your corns! So it's a good job your character owns a smart jetpack to propel him in eight, smoothly scrolling directions. It must be constantly topped up with power, though, and although there is the odd loose energy pod lying around the planet, most of them can only be acquired by destroying robots, either by blowing them up or, in the early stages of the game, pushing them from high places.

"REVIEW PC ENGINE .00 BY HUDSON SOFT The life of your average caveboy is fraught with danger and PC Kid is no exception. Not only are there all manner of dinosaurs to avoid, but that horrible Bonk the Dragonsaurus has gone and kidnapped his girly again. Barely out of nappies since his first excur Sion into the neolithic unknown, the sweet little bundle of prehistoric innocence must once again venture out of his cave and alternpt to rescue the love of his young life. PC Kid 2 sees the bold, bald youngster battling it out across six levels of sun, sea, sand and the soldiers of the nasty Bonk. As in his first outing, the kid can dispose of any creatures by headbutting thern or by consuming his favourite kebabs and cutting a swathe through the hordes before the effect of that hot chilli wears of Bonus levels are accessible, in which the kid can rack up his points tally and, of course, there's an assortment of weird and not So-wonderful guards at the end of each level whom PC Kid must despatch to that great boneyard in the sky it he wishes to continue further into the game.

These cute little dinos with half-eggshells stuck on their heads were the loyal fol lowers of Bonkin PC Kid's first adventure, and now there are even more of them! Not only do they appear as cavemen, they can also be found butterfly-catching, surfing, dressed up in naval un form and practicing sema. phore, and even relaxing by the water and indulging in a spot of fishing!

"DD REVIEW KID 2 ANTHROPUS COMPUTERS DONER DELIGHTS PC Kid's favourite food kebabs come in two lavours sweet 'n' sickly and extra hot! The former turns the Kid into a vision of loveliness, complete with long, curly eyelashes, allowing him to literally kill his enemies with kindess by blowing lovehearts at them. The second allows him to literally blow his top and charge right through the minions of Bonk, giving them no chance of retaliation until the chilli Wears off. De 28 7450 FLOWER POWER On picking the flowers situ ated around and about PC Kid's world, our hero is instantly whisked off to one of the many bonus levels of the game. Here, he must collect as many of the Smileys as possible, either before he reaches ground level or with in the given time limit, which ever is appropriate to the stage in question. At the end of the level, the Smileys are turned into points and Kid is transported back to the position he was at before he picked the flower. Handy or what? The first PC Kid game was an absolute joy, both to look at and play. So it comes as no real surprise to find that programmers Hudsonsoft have hung on to the basic Wonderboy/Marioesque formula which made that title such a HIT! and added extra features around it such as new baddies, secret rooms and bonus levels. What we end up with is a cart which not only is a darn sight larger than the original, but infinitely more enjoyable in the playability stakes. PC Kid is as agile as ever, being able to jump, headbutt and even land flat on his bonce from a great height! All these actions, and those of the multitude of monsters to be tackled, are picked out in beautifully animated, almost cartoon-like quality when the Kid is underwater, for example, and comes across a fishing Eggosaurus, he jumps out of the water, eats the fish and the line along with it! The sonic treats are as maniacal as before, mixing old tunes and effects from the original game with some great new ones and combining with the great graphics and superb playability to create one of the best PC Engine games of all time.

"REVIEWDOPC KID 2 bos PREHISTORIC PERILS This time around, the endlevel guardians are angry, and even more difficult to defeat than in the first game! They have become even stranger, too, and include a Tortoisaurus with a volcanic shell on its back, a Rhinosaurus with a laser-mounted nose (and a gunsight perched on the end of its horn!) and even a ballet-dancing monster complete with tu-tul 3750 Looks can be very deceiving, and at first glance this appears for all the world like a bog-standard cutesie platform game. In fact, it's a lot, lot more. PC Kid is a huge bundle of laffs from beginning to end, combining some well wicked gameplay with touches of humour guaranteed to keep you coming back for more. The play area is vast, which means you'll stay superglued to the joypad for hours on end until you think you've discovered everything only to find a whole new region chock-ablock full of thrills 'n' spills to conquer. You'll need to keep your wits about you too: our Kid has to contend with a huge variety of obstacles and enemies and those critters just keep on coming. PC Kid 2 is one of those games you'll quickly grow to love, and this bald little tyke even manages to give Mario a run for his money. For good honest Engine-owning gameplay freaks, this is a dream come true. The rest of you will just have to sit there and ponder over all the goodies you're missing because you don't have a PC Engine and PC Kid ll is another on the list. It's terrific!

"Sese REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY ELECTRONIC ARTS V hen unemployment hit new heights and the politicians told V people to \"get on their bikes\". you took them literally, bought a 400CC speed monster and started racing for money. The venues Choose your for your chosen sport are five stretches of North America's free ways through the Sierra Nevada, Palm Desert, Grass Valley, Redcourse from wood Forest and along the Pacific coastline. Of course, racing on a this menu. public highway is highly illegal, but the substantial amounts of prize money make it worthwhile as long as you're good enough to win. ROAR RASH You're joined by 14 other riders, all just as eager to collect the purse and, like you, most of them don't care how they go about winning. Your opponents are all pretty tough hombres, and if you try overtaking they may well boot you off your bike or at least give you a friendly smack in the face as a warning. Of course, you're not above using the same tactics and would happily eliminate them from the race by driving them into the path of an oncoming car! Nasty, eh? Complicating things are the highway patrolmen who cruise up and down the state on their Harley Davidsons causing trouble for honest outlaw bikers like you. If you let one of them catch you for PRESS \"A\" FOR get about finishing the race, because you'll be in jail. Unless you PLAYER. SELECTE can afford to pay a hefty fine, you'll be staying there till the racing season's over! PAUSED 000 PAUSED 200 PLAYER A 03:40 @7 A CRUNCH! A collision with a car (visible in the mirrors) sends bike and rider flying! NEW BIKES FOR OLD! It's usually not long before you have a bit of prize money burn ing a hole in your leathers. Save it up and you should soon be able to afford a more powerful bike just what you need when you finish the first five races and move on to the stiffer competition of the Level Two riders All the bikes are outwardly based on real street machines, al though the names have been changed. After all, what sell-respecting real world biker would buy a motorcycle called a Panda? A beat 'em up on motorbikes, eh? Now here's a sight we don't see very often. My first impression was that this is really just a racing game with the fighting bits tacked on as a gimmick, but it is actually an essential part of the game. True, you're not meant to thump every rider you come across, but some of the more stubborn ones just won't let you past without a fight! The aggro broadens the enjoyment you get from Road Rash a great deal and makes you wonder why no-one thought of it before. You can't beat charging through a pack of four bikers, then swerving a bit to knock them all flying! The 3D effect, though not silky smooth, is very fast and sufficiently convincing to make you think you're rocketing up the road at 140 mph and the crash effects are excellent! Run into the back of a car at high speed and both you and the bike are catapulted over the bonnet, and while you're lying stunned by the roadside, the car is bouncing the bike further up the road! Road Rash makes all other race games seem like a crashing bore, so try it and buy it! PAUL ROAD-RASH CRISTI SOPANDA56LBS BASE 030 GLANCEY "

OP AUSED DAX 98 1219162113 SAFETY LAST As if your competitors didn't make things dangerous enough, there are all sorts of other hazards waiting to rearrange a careless rider's facial features. Naturally you need to take care on bends or risk running off the road into a tree, sign or building. Also, watch out for cars coming down the other side of the road towards you, or crosstraffic at junctions. It only takes two collisions with a car to write off the bike, and perhaps the rider. Both the bike and the rider have damage indicators, and if either run off the scale that's the end of the race. If both survive a crash, the fallen rider has to get up, run back up the road to his bike and get going again before he loses too many positions!

He's smug, he's rich, he's not a particularly good rider and he probably has no laste in music. Before the race, he'll either be bragging about how much his custom made bike has cost or promising that his conduct will be nothing but sportsmanlike. Try to pass him on the road, however, and he'll either try to kick you off your bike or pull a club and smash you over the helmet with it! IF YOU SEE A COP IN THE MIRRORS, PULL OVER AND STOP.

This is one hard 'n' fast racer, with a whole load of extras and some very nice touches thrown in on top. The fighting aspect is crucial to your success mastering your machine and learning how to throw a punch are top of the list of any boy racer's priorities. Although fairly simple, the graphics work very well and the illusion of speed is so convincing you'll almost wince when you fall off the bike!

"Oo REVIEW VETEM 520.89 SPIDH the AMI MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY SEGA Deter Parker works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle newspaper. Not a very interesting job, you may think. But when the forces of evil get up to no good, Peter becomes Spiderman, one of the greatest superheroes of them all. After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter received all the skills available to the eightlegged creature; walking up walls, spinning webs (with the help of a special invention he invented), great strength for his size and that sixth sense which alerts spiders just as you're about to squash them. Spidey's new adventure revolves around one of his most dan gerous adversaries The Kingpin. He's broadcast a television message alleging that Spiderman has turned to crime and planted a bomb which will spread pollution all over the city! Of course, it's not true, and it's the Kingpin who has planted the bomb, but this doesn't save Spidey from suddenly becoming the target of the city's police force. He has to prove his innocence by tracking down the bomb and doing over Kingpin's henchmen. The Kingpin has recruited some of the most ingenious supercriminal minds to help him, such as The Lizard, Doctor Octopus and The Hobgoblin. All of the baddies have been entrusted with one of the five bomb disarming keys, and Spidey has to find them and beat them up enough to get the key out of them. Once all the keys have been found, Spidey must then track down The Kingpin and force him to reveal the location of the bomb. Doc Octopus is well-armed (haw haw!). \".-BUT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO MUCH OF ANYTHING IF I DIDN'T GET SOME YOU'RE MARY 6 JANE WATSONS FIGURE TRONG, I'm more than surprised to see Spidey on the Sega 1 would have thought that, with the likes of the Turtles doing the rounds, the old web-slinger himself would be a bit long in the tooth for kids of the Nineties. That shouldn't stop you grabbing Spiderman vs Kingpin as soon as you can, however, because he's been transferred to digital form brilliantly. All Spidey's powers have been recreated on the Master System, making it possible to fire webs, walk up walls, vanquish evil enemies just like the man himself even Spiderman's Spidey Sense has been included, to warn the player of oncoming bosses! When you play the game, it's as if you're participating in an interactive comic strip, even though Marvel's marvel struts around as if he's Chris Eubank on a bad day. One tiny problem is the sheer amount of cut-scenes interspersed throughout the action; nice to look at the first time round but after that you'll be hammering away at the fire button to get rid of them and continue with the proceedings. All in all, Spiderman vs The Kingpin is a faithful interpretation of Spidey's comic book and cartoon exploits, and should be snapped up forthwith. PAUL RAND 034 "


"AZING REVIEW ER:MAN \"MY SPIDEY SENSE IS TINGLING!\" Cool of W 0 0DUR Spidey gets a shock! The wall-crawler heads for the Daily Bugle. Some people have ESP. Peter Parker has his Spidey Sense. Whenever danger is close at hand, his sense tingles to warn him to be on his guard. This has been included in Spidey vs Kingpin, to warn of nearby end-oflevel bosses. Represented by a flashing Spidey-face, Spidey sense doesn't come into operation until all of the ordinary enemies have been defeated. OC: KAAREN Rodent extermination the Spidey way. HQ HADDE Retract GET SERIOUS! SPIDEY GAMES TO SNAP UP! This is a fine example of using a licence to it's best advantage. The cut-scenes look and read very much like a Marvel strip, and this lends the game a lot of atmosphere. It's also good to see the gameplay includes all of Spidey's superpowers (except maybe his super strength even stepping on a rat can knock him for six!). However, there are a few things about the game which I found irritating. One was the fiddly control method, which takes a lot of getting used to, and results in a lot of unforeseen deaths in the meantime (especially frustrating because Spidey only gets one life). The other thing is the music. The Master System wasn't built for good sounds, but Spidey's soundtrack reeeally grates, and ! was forced to jam the volume down to save my ears from permanent damage. Once you're accustomed with the controls and adjusted the sound, Spiderman reveals ite self as a strangely compelling game, and it's power to keep you playing is overwhelming. If you were ever keen on the comic, this is a must, and anyone who likes platform games won't be disappointed either. PAUL Spiderman vs Kingpin isn't the only game to feature the webslinger other digital treats include Doctor Doom's Revenge (a crabby beat 'em up from the USA which also featured Captain America). The Amazing Spiderman (actually there are two of these, one on computer which resembled Manic Miner, the other a Shinobi-with-webs beat'em up on the Gameboy), and who remembers the Spiderman adventure game by Adventure International from waaaay back in 1984?

"AUNTEYBS. AUTO O 0 ! no Ooo Lo Se A WEAKLING WRITES... Dear AUNTIE YOB, I am Richard Green and I would like to know how to build my muscles up as everyone beats me up for being weak. What shall I do? RICHARD GREEN, Surrey AUNTIE SAYS: You may be a pathetic little wimp, Dickie ducks, but don't despair: Auntie Yob will see you through this crisis. First of all, face up to your fears. Approach the cruel thugs making your life a misery and reason with them. Tell them the error of their ways and explain how they could be gaining a friend instead of an enemy. then whack them over the head with an iron bar, boot them in the family trinkets and run like hell... I CAN'T TAKE A BEATING! Dear AUNTIE YOB, I'm writing in reply to David Black (issue 116) who said the amusement arcade is a place of sin in parents' eyes. I agree it did seem to be a bad word until I converted mine. My Dad really enjoys a good bash on Golden Axe you should see him bashing away Hello dearies, welcome to Auntie Yob's at the buttons. I call him smasher because by the time problem page. That horrid nephew of he's finished, the arcade mine has gone down with a dreadful cabinet has not joystick or case of food poisoning (he's been pickbuttons left. My mum's a little less adventurous though she sticks to her ing his nose again, the little blighter) and twopenny fruit machines. My brother's like me he enjoys beathas left me in charge of this month's ing hell out of bad guys. But I do have to disagree with the statement \"the arcades are a Mailbag. Sorting through his sack I can i great place to make new friends\". I only seem to make new see that you've all got problems you enemies. For example, I was in the arcade and this kid came up keep writing to YOB'S AMAZING MAILto me and asked me for a game on Final Blow. I happily accepted and paid for us both. But no-one told me this guy was the BAG, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, heavyweight boxing champion of the world. He knocked me PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON down three times in under two minutes and went on to finish the game. then he had the nerve to ask for another go (do you ever LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. Just hold on get the feeling you're being taken for a sucker?). while I do up me boots and open another Another example was when I was on Golden Axe, doing really crate of Guinness and I'll sort out all . well, and this kid joined in. We were playing for a bit when he said, \"Wait a minute while I kill this annoying little git with the your little troubles... axe.\" And you know who the annoying little git with the axe was, don't you? Yes, yours truly. loob 600 S o igo dodo Jpdol COD "


"EMAILBAG Throughout my time I've been constantly thrown around the screen by my neck, bashed over the head with a lead pipe and slashed to bits, all by my so-called team-mates. With friends like these, who needs enemies? GLEN FOSTER, Carlton, Nottingham AUNTIE SAYS: I fear it's not your playing partners with the problem, luvvy, but you. Don't you realise how much fun it is to completely wreck other people's games by cutting them off in their prime? Honestly, what's your problem? You ought to take a leaf out of your old man's book and become an axe wielding homicidal maniac but make sure you put your coins in the machine first. JUST POTTY OVER POPULOUS Dear AUNTIE YOB, I'm a little annoyed. In issue 113 there was a preview of 8-bit Populous saying it would be available in March. Do you know of any shops in London which might sell it? SEAN SANGSTER, London SE13 AUNTIE SAYS: Did you know that stress accounts for more illnesses than eating too many Jelly Tots on an R-360 arcade machine? I'd hate to see you pop a gasket over this, dearie, so why not calm yourself down, try some yoga whilst chanting \"I must not be a stupid little prigg\", take a close look at this issue and all will be revealed... YOU CRAFTY LITTLE BEGGER! Dear YOB, Please, please, pretty please could you print this letter and please could you give me the cash prize because (oh I hope this is a good excuse) I need it to buy a Nintendo. If you will not give me the money could you at least give me yours? I own a crappy Master System. WESLEY COLEMAN, Kidderminster YOB: Whaddya mean, crappy Master System? You should think yourself lucky, 'cos there are plenty of people out there worse off than you! Take Art Editor Jon, for example: up until recently all he had for company on a Wednesday evening was his greenscreen Vectrex and Flintstones videos. So my advice is to look on the bright side. After all, at least your name's not Wesley. MUM'S THE WORD Dear YOB, I have recently found out the address of your Mum and if I don't get the 100 I'll tell her what you're up to. T ELEMENT, Stockport, Cheshire PS The old-style CVG was better. YOB: So what? My mum taught me everything! knew. I remember the days when she was champion cat-hurler for Sudbury. She didn't actually live in Sudbury; she just beat up the organisers until they let her compete there. My kinda gal! NO IT WASNT DUMBASS BOINNK! Naff off, Auntie these are my pages and I'm not let. ting any raving old biddy tanked up on Guinness take over! Auntie's gone to, ah, sleep off an unexplained blow to the head, so I'm back at the helm. Honestly old people these days you have to have eyes in the back of your head. Now if you'll just excuse me for a couple of paragraphs while I lug her back into the ambulance... BRING BACK THE GOOD OLD DAYS Right, I'm back. Normal service will now be resumed... TAKE A HIKE, WALKER! Dear YOB, I haven't really got any idea why I'm writing to you. Anyway, Hi! How's it going? Oh, I have just remembered a question for you why don't most cheat modes work on my ST, for instance Dragon Breed, Robocop 2 and Forgotten Worlds? PHILLIP WALKER, Framlingham, Suffolk YOB: They're probably not working because you're so braindead that you've be trying to enter them into the family toaster. Do us all a favour and stick yourself under the grill instead. I'LL BELIEVE ANYTHING. I WILL Dear YOB, Is it true what I read in some crap mag, that Nintendo has dropped its copyright laws? Does this mean that Sega can release the Super Mario Bros games on the Master System or Megadrive without being sued? SOMEBODY Somewhere YOB: If you seriously believe that then you're a bigger fool than Phillip Walker. Come on matey, would you buy a Nintendo if you could get Mario on computer? Do me a favour! Dear YOB, I have been reading some computer mags and very few have Amstrad, C64 and Spectrum games. Even CVG has not had a review of a C64 or Amstrad game in four months ad on the highscores and Bytesize you have been complaining about C64, Amstrad and Spectrum. In the May issue it was so bad that you put Spectrum and C64 Bytesize on one page. There is just no more months when there is something good to say about the C64, Spectrum and Amstrad it's all Amiga, ST and PC. Even my best chum said when he came over to play my Game Boy that the Game Boy graphics were better than the C64. Some say it's change, but I want the good old days back when it was Spectrum, Amstrad and C64 fighting for first place. CIARAN MHELHALL, Co Wicklaw, Ireland PS There is nothing wrong with the Amiga, PC or ST. YOB: It's all well and good whinging on about \"the good old days\" but why don't you take your head out of that smelly, dark place and look to the future. Honestly, you're more out of date than my library books. THE GOOD OLD DAYS! "


"SIZE DOESN'T MATTER, HONEST Dear YOB I would like to congratulate you on a fine magazine. I've seen so many letters complaining about the size of your reviews and, personally, I think they are fine and give me what I want to know without \"beating about the bush\", so to speak. A certain Mr Jenkins in issue 116 complained about the \"inane caricatures of the reviewers\". I think that these are very useful as I can see instantly from the reviewers' expressions whether the game received a good review or not and I appreciate that greatly. So thank you, YOB and the rest of the CVG staff for an interesting and informative magazine. B RUTHERFORD, Ewell, Surrey GROVEL (od (C harSCRINGE CRIN LE YOB: If you could see my face right now, you'd see instantly that I think your a horrible little crawler who has about as much chance of getting star letter as my chiropodist raising a smile... A M DISH THAT DOSH, OR ELSE! Dear YOB, I am writing a letter to ask you to pay me the sum of  or I will come round your house and give you a sloppy wet kiss and use my art of Y-Zitzu, a deadly Yfront in your face and you will soon give the cash to Mr Round, ruler of the YOB house and defender of the CVG crown. I will also ask not to insult my friends Mr Wizard Man and Mr Stoolhead. I have to be looked at now. Bye bye. MR ROUND, Dyfed, Wales YOB: What is your mother feeding you? Whatever it is, don't worry: I can remember my first pint too. not to insult my friends me wit CVG crown. I will also ask 001021 h a YOB: At least I'm popular. I've heard that people hate you so 23:> W me s EVERYBODY HATES ME! Dear YOB, I have just written to say that you think you are taught when you are not. Everything that I hate about YOB is listed below: 1. He always calls everyone a boring old git or fart. 2. He's so tight that he never gives away that hundred quid prize. 3. He never helps anyone when they need help. For example, a boy asked how to load Narco on the PC in issue 116. 4. His armpits are so hairy he looks like he's got a hippy in a headlock. BICCY BAR CRUM, Croydon YOB: At least I'm popular. I've heard that people hate you so much that kids at school pay the teachers to keep quiet while they beat you up. Look, buy a packet of biccy bars, shove them in your gob sideways and say the alphabet backwards to find out how much sense you make. WHAT A MUG! Dear YOB, I think Barry Jenkins (from issue 116) is a boring, tired old human being and a large chunk of CVG readers will, without question, agree with me. As I'm sure my hypothesis is correct, his friends must look like the cartoon of Tim Boone on page 44 of issue 116 (no offence Tim). PATRICK WAKEHAM, Exeter, Devon YOB: What, you mean he's handsome, suave and generally hunky? (No, you can't have a pay rise Ed). Actually, I've heard that his friends look exactly like you, so they must be boring old farts as well. I'M FUNNY, I AM... PATRICH Her er det noen andre bebor WAKE.MAM Knock Knock! Who's there? Kylie! Kylie who? THAT'S SHOWBUSINESS! Q: How many pessimists does it take to change a lightbulb? A: None, because it'll only go out again anyway. Q: How many folk singers does it take to change a lightbulb? A: Sixteen one to change the lightbulb and fifteen to sing about how good the old one was. Q: How many Californians does it take to change a lightbulb? A: Eight one to change the lightbulb and seven to share in the experience. RADION AUTOMATIC, Wantwich, Cheshire PS My Rowtron is better than your Famicom. PPS Welcome back Paul Rand, my favourite reviewer, but shame you're taking the job which surely would have been mine. YOB: There's nothing like a good laugh. And there's nothing like a good laugh in this letter. Who writes your material Dot Cotton? "


"PONCEY POET'S CORNER Dear YOB. I have written a poem about your mega-groovy mag. CVG is ultra-groovy. It's a brilliant mag. Not just because of the reviews But because of YOB's Mailbag! Yes, it's a delight To see the writers' plight, As their grovelling for a hundred pound, Is refused by YOB, then they kneel on the ground. As they lick YOB's boots YOB cries \"You coots!\" And then proceeds to wrestle every limb From the grovellers' bodies, and tells their next of kin. STEVEN, Mario World With The Stick's kids at him, but don't shoot too many of the audience! Kill him and you are in the last level... SIMON BARRETT Pontypridd, Mid Glamorgan YOB: And so it goes on. I've decided to cut the rest of this drivel to do Yob's bit for the environment and save a few trees for my pet Rottweiler Poodle cross breed to cock his leg on. How about this idea for a new game: SIMON BARRETT'S BIG NIGHT IN FRIENDS: 0 TIME:ODO POINTS: 000 YOB: There is this bloke called Steven His crappy poetry's bad, He think he's going to win a prize But no he's not. How sad. 2.000 LEVEL ONE: Simon waits for his friends to come round and ask him out to the cinema or something. FRIENDS: DD TIME:630 POINTS:ODO lilil LEVEL TWO: Simon remembers he has no friends 'cos he's such a drip, so he stays in. Good, eh? Jill JUST A STUPID LUNT Dear YOB, Excellent though your letters page may be, I've discovered a very worrying trend. Why, when some idiot writes in is there some sort of cartoon drawn next to their letter insulting them? They can't help being complete thickos and could get upset over these graphical masterpieces. STEVEN LUNT Wigan, Lancs YOB: What's the matter, thicko? Want a cartoon drawn of yourself? Mmmm. What do you reckon, Jon? Kolor NO CHANCE.JON. AUNTIE CLIMAX CONSOLE CRAZIES DRIVE ME NUTS Dear YOB, What is all this poo flying around about consoles taking over the world? I myself have a PC Engine (which I won in one of your fabby compos) but I still think that they are no better than computers. For a start, games are incredibly expensive on consoles, and you can't even make back-up copies if the cartridges bugger up. Also, if consoles are so good, why are the makers (ie. Sega and NEC) bringing out PC versions of their consoles? Don't get me wrong, I think consoles are marv (especially the Super Famicom) but they are not better: I'd say on par Anyway, nuff said. I've designed a wicked game and it's called REVENGE OF THE SEQUEL OF VIC REEVES BIG NIGHT OUT Dear YOB, I'm back in the Ronald Reagan ward at the Institution where my head is recovering nicely no thanks to you! If the fingerprints on that saucepan match yours, you'll be in hot water when I tell your Mum, you mark my words! Honestly, you were such a sweet little boy. Young people today. I could weep I could, really Hugs and kisses, AUNTIEXX PS. I'm warning you, I might come and visit again next month YOB: ULPI 1. LEVEL ONE: You are Les and have to hunt around backstage and in the studio in a forced-perspective romp to find the keys to his Bontempi organ which Vic has dismembered. If you find his ceremonial gown you get an extra life and his giant power supply gives you speed. LEVEL TWO: This is a side-on beat 'em up. You play Wavy Davy and have to find Graham Lister (boo hiss!). His henchmen are in abundance but you can use your fists, The Man With The Stick's stick, bits of fence from Novelty Island and if you collect three icons you become the devil and fire beams from your eyes! LEVEL THREE: Unfortunately, Lister escaped and in this level, which is a front-on view, Op Wolf-style shoot 'em up (on a static screen) where Lister is hiding in the audience, you fire The Man van 27 "

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY ELECTRONIC ARTS ummer's finally underway, and what better way to keep cool than to head off to the nearest ice-rink and kit yourself out for a rough, tough game of ice-hockey? Of course, if you're unfit (or just plain lazy) you could always hook up the Megadrive and go headto-head against the computer (or a friend) in a simulated version of the sport, courtesy of the producers of the excellent John Madden's Football, Electronic Arts. The idea is to score goals. Lots of 'em. But not with a ball, but a heavy piece of flat metal otherwise known as a puck. And in EA Hockey the player is given the opportunity to take on the cream of the world's seven-a-side crop, it's even possible for two teams from the same country to go up against one anotherl Take on the computer by yourself, team up with a friend or challenge a human opponent in a game which can be adjusted to suit your skills the length of each match and even the rules can be tweaked to meet the players' requirements. And if that's not enough, there are even onrink fights if the action gets a bit too heated! John Madden Football was something else, but just wait until you see EA Ice Hockey you wouldn't have believed that the Megadrive could handle such a game. Brilliance exudes the moment the cartridge is plugged in and switched on, with a thumping Rob Hubbard soundtrack to introduce the player to the proceedings. But it's the game itself which most delights, being very easy to play yet extremely challenging and shockingly addictive, whether you play against the computer or a human opponent. The extra touches, such as the action-replay are a joy to use and watch and then there are the delightful in-game touches, such as cameras clicking in the crowd, various cries from the audience when different actions occur on the rink and, of course, the fights what good ice hockey game could be without them? EA Ice Hockey has the lot; it really cannot be faulted in any area. This is going to be as hard to get hold of as John Madden's was when it was released, so get those advance orders in NOW! PAUL RAND "


"REVIEW FOLLOW THE RULES.. But only if you want 10. EA Ice Hockey can be played according to the full game rules, complete with penalties and sendings-off (the disgraced player is sent to OCcupy the Sin Bin for two minutes), which adds realism but will appeal most to avid ice-hockey followers who Crave such additions as it does tend to slow up the game. On the other hand, combatants can play with scaled-down rules, which helps playability (and speeds up the proceedings) no end! GO ON! KICK 'IM! If you ever watch Ice Hockey on the TV, you've doubtless no ticed the way a few friendly nudges can erupt into full-scale war within a matter of seconds. EA have captured this one of the best parts of the real game. perfectly. The players pull off their helmets, throw their sticks to the floor and ice hockey is completely forgotten about until one or the other is sprawled across the ice. If only we had that in footy, eh?! van playere then The Shan 4:39 55 Benale Penalty PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM One of the most impressive features of EA Ice Hockey is the ACtion Replay It works like a VCR, with controls for last rewind, slow forward and play. This means that, even though the action moves at such a cracking pace, those holly-contested goals can be replayed over and over again, and any arguments quick ly ironed out that's the theory anyway, it still doesn't help stop heated exchanges over whether that last shot was an own-goal or not (it was a boon to our taking of screenshots, however)! 045 "


"REVIEW ER NOCKEY (Goal! It looks like Electronic Arts are fast becoming the masters of Megadrive sports sims. After John Madden Football, PGA Tour Golf and Lakers Vs Celtics they've worked their magic on ice hockey and produced a game that is just as playable and exciting as their past hits. What makes EA Hockey so good is the way it perfectly recreates the speed and extreme violence of the actual sport. There are players flying everywhere, and the addition of a little punch-up subgame is a great idea that way at least you can win on fight victories, if not goals scored! EA Hockey is one of the most actionpacked sports game available for the Megadrive, so whether you're a sports fan or not this one is absolutely unmissable! m-mate attened Thanadian och STATS PAUL GLANCEY Shop 00 AAK tackzone MEGADRIVE GRAPHICS SOUNDS AVABILIT) ASTABILITY OVERALL 95 046 "

"REVIEW AMIGA BY OCEAN .53 HEEEEEEEE They're the SEALS Sea, Air Land America's version of our own SAS, and almost as hard, too. Trained in covert action behind enemy lines. Their role in the Gulf War ensured a lar simpler time for the regular lighting forces in this game of the film, a US forces chopper has been shot down somewhere over the Gulf of Oman, and the SEALS have been called into action to rescue the stranded crew. And, seeing as they're in the vicinity, they ve also been given, as a secondary mission, the lask of storming the streets of Beirut in order to destroy a rumoured stockpils of Stinger missiles. What this boils down lo is an eight-level shool and collect'em up across various multidirectional scrolling areas, with the player planting detonators, killing Arabs and generally getting up to all kinds of cover shenanigans. TRETANT UPDATE Navy SEALs has been knocking around since Christmas on 8-bits (including the GX4000 console). This Amiga version has been released alongside an Atari ST version which also costs .53. 001325 . 04:27 7| 01:08 The SEAL plants his bomb and swings downward. A Phwoar! Kentucky-fried terrorist! 001400 US 00:27 NAPS FIGHTING FIT Being one of the world's most advanced fighting units, the Navy SEALS have to be supremely fit, and the character which you control in the game is certainly that. Not only can he run around nonstop without getting out of puff, he can climb over boxes, jump from ledge to ledge, haul himself up onto platforms and shimmy along walkways to somersault up and take out those tea-towelwearing fiends! It's difficult to find the words to describe Navy SEALS although I suppose \"rubbish\", \"abysmal\" and \"blooargh\" would fit the bill. It's so frustrating to play; the controls themselves are unresponsive, but even worse, the main character runs so close to the edge of the screen that he all too often runs straight into a terror ist and is gunned down without even being given the chance to duck! Not only that, but the game is bugged! Yes, hard to believe but true. I was climbing down a ladder, got to the end and attempted to jump off, but my chap was having none of that! No, the SEAL continued climbing down the wall, Spiderman fashion, until he fell into the control panell About the only good point in the entire product is the animation of your soldier, but that's one healthy point in an otherwise terminally ill piece of software.

"LI REVIEW BABES JETTI SUROR ENOS Charlie Sheen prepares to kick butt in the movie. i 1000000 TIME 09 02:14 THE FILM OF THE GAME Orion Pictures produced Navy SEALS (the movie) which is cur rently on general release, rated 15. It stars Charlie Sheen, Michael Biehn (who also played a SEAL, albeit a loopy one, in The Abyss) and the love interest is provided by everyone's fa vourite nurse, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer. Alas, Navy SEALs is not one of Orion's best flicks, and it's been panned by critics both in Britain and across the pond. Word also has it that the release of the film was originally scheduled for last Christmas, but was promptly postponed until the conflict with Iraq was over, for fear it might upset our Middle Eastern allies. Don't mix politics and film-making, that's what we say. SEALS \"Practise all of the available moves until you can use them instinctively, it says in the instructions. \"How the hell can you use them instinctively when the controls are extremely unresponsive?\" it says in my review. Perfect control is essential in this game, firstly because the terrorists are crack shots, and secondly because the time limits are very strict and if you can't swing down when you want to, you have to take extra time to find a long way round or fall off and risk instant death from a sprained ankle. The frustration this creates makes Navy SEALS far too annoying to keep you playing to the end of the game. Also, it's high time Ocean did something new with their film licences because this platform format of theirs was tired out last Christmas. That and all the other problems conspire to make this a game which is seriously second rate, and which I'd advise you to steer clear of PAUL GLANCEY AMICA GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 48 LASTABIL OVERALL 45 "

Too late they've landed, grown from their spores and are busy feeding their faces on the population of the Earth, Stunned by the speed of the attack, the armed forces are taken completely by surprise and are reduced to a mass of goo by the extra-terrestrial invaders. A storm is brewing, and there's no place for weathermen... But three heroes survive to fight the good fight, take on the seemingly impossible task of defeating the aliens and hopefully win through, for the sake of the world (and a lat pay rise if they do the job well!) Cut a swathe through the nine levels of cosmic calamity, pitting your wits and massive weaponry against some of the ugliest crea tures ever to grace a console screen. Use those armaments spar ingly, though; they have a tendency to run out just as a sprawling, alien guardian is about to zap you with a bolt of interstellar laser en ergy! This was obviously going straight down the road to mega-gamedom when WHOOPS! something went drastically wrong and the finished product turns out to be about three-quarters as good as it could have been. The game looks stupendous, and the gameplay is just as good, but there's just not enough of it! The levels are over very quickly, and before you know it you're zapping the UFO in the last mission. Even with the game set on the hardest possible level (single player mode, rapid-fire off and HARD energy level and game difficulty) Alien Storm presents little lasting challenge to anyone more skillful than a sedated pineapple. It's sufficiently playable to keep you coming back after you've finished, but not for very long I'm afraid... PAUL GLANCEY MEET THE TEAM! Although the coin-op allowed simultaneous, three-player thrills 'n spills, this Megadrive conversion only caters for two. However, all three original heroes are still there to choose from here's who they are: GORDON Alien Storm on the Megadrive is a graphical spectacular, with wave upon wave of ugly alien baddies eager to have a go at your character. Great attention to detail, combined with smooth animation of all the sprites, makes Alien Storm a real eyecatcher. Just like the Golden Axe conversion, this cart actually goes one better than the original coin-op by introducing two brand new levels to attempt, adding value for money. At least it would do, were the game not so incredibly easy 1 reached level seven on my first go, and I wouldn't exactly call myself the world's greatest shoot'em up expert. Alien Storm is a fun blast, right enough, but if long-term shoot 'em up frolics are what you're looking for, I'm afraid you won't find 'em here. PAUL RAND Big and butch, like a real alien ass-kicker should be. Packs an impressive laser cannon trouble is, it's a short-range weapon, which puts our lad in easy reach of enemy attack!

"DIVE VERSION HO STORMTROOPERS ONE-ON-ONE Like the Megadrive Golden Axe conversion, Alien Storm has the bonus feature of a one-on-one battle between two human players or at least, the Japanese version does. The Official English game features a single player battle against a pair of alien beasts. When the first two are beaten, up pop two harder monsters to slay, and when those two are gone... Kalra is all woman until she straps on her flame thrower and goes off in search of all manner of intergalactic adver saries. Then she shows just how tough a girl can bel He may be a robot, but this towering hunk of tin can show those bad guys a thing or two when it comes to wielding his frighteningly effective laser-whip!

The bad guys swarm on from all sides, but keep your trigger finger pumping and watch the offworld slime fly! SHOOT DOWN THE SHOPS, LUV! Somewhere in each level a cry for help comes from behind a a door! Walk through and the action changes to an Op Wolf-style subgame to find extra energy for your special megaweapon. This is done by blasting the scenery (as well as the aliens behind it) to uncover energy pods. If you're REALLY lucky. you may even find the odd firstaid kit too.

"REVIEW NINTENDO BY NINTENDO .99 The President has a big problem. Someone has tapped into the country's defence computer network and rearranged the code, making it impossible for the Pentagon to control its nuclear arsenal. Needless to say, the White House is at crisis point, but there may be one hope The Image Transfer System. A revolutionary new machine, this is capable of transforming the human mind into binary code, allowing a person to travel inside a computer and check programs first-hand. This system is required now, but there is one small problem; the ITS is completely untested, and the scientists have absolutely no idea what happens to the user once inside a cir. cuit board. Enter one Colonel Scott O'Connor, crack soldier and crazy kinda guy. Crazy because he's volunteered to be guinea pig and allow himself to be transported into the defence system. And this is where the game starts, with O'Connor finding to his relief that the only real side-effect is that he assumes the appearance of a Kabuki player. Kabuki, as if you didn't know, is a an exuberant Japanese thea. trical style, and O'Connor's transformation is adequately explained by the fact that his granddad was a famous Kabuki actor. Makes perfect sense to us. The thing about Kabukis, though, is that they have extremely long hair, and O'Connor can use his new mystical mop to whip the bugs which are ransacking the defence code. So, running, whipping, shooting and swinging around platforms is the order of the day as each level of the computer's defense system is negotiated. Blocking the exit from each stage is a guardian who is especially tough, but if O'Connor can destroy him he is rewarded with an extra weapon before he enters the next level. xo E:171 Like Paul, I wasn't too keen on this to start with. The smart graphics and the animation on Mr Wig made it look nice, but it was just soooo difficult! A bit of perseverance taught me the error of my ways though, and after a half-hour's play I was hooked. The programmers obviously know their stuff, but I'm a little concerned about whoever came up with the plot. As if being beamed into a computer gone haywire wasn't bad enough, the Colonel is also transformed into a traditional Japanese actor, just because his granddad was one?! Still, it doesn't stop this from being a topper game, which should give real Nintendo hards a run for their money. PAUL GLANCEY SCOR: 0022850 CHIPS WITH EVERYTHING Not only can O'Connor punch and whip baddies, he can also blast them with his microchip-controlled gun. The chip only has a limited amount of energy though, and must be topped-up with power from blatted beasties when it runs out. Quite weak at the beginning of the game, it's powered up at the start of each level to provide unstoppabullets, and a three-way fusion cannon!! "


"REVIEW 5S CHIP 2011 SCORE: 0008090 BUG-ER ME, BOB! The bugs that inhabit this computer system cannot be destroyed by a re-write, which is why our hero is in there in the first place. Take on big-eyed bouncy spacemen, squat, flying crocodiles and even giant fleas! Some of the enemies carry power-ups, giving O'Connor either a dose of life energy or a supply of power for the gun and you'll need them both if you want to get anywhere in Kabuki o that's a Climb the ladder then spin-jump onto the platform on the right. Kabuki (or Ninja Wig, as it's affectionately known as in the CVG office!) is the latest in a long line of horizontally scrolling beat 'em ups to grace the NES and, to be honest, it's not really too bad. The graphic style is reminiscent in some small way of Batman, with dark, moody colours throughout the game. To begin with, wasn't too keen on this one; to me it was just another addition to a genre which was beginning to wear very thin anyway. But I played a bit more, was irritated by the difficulty setting (Kabuki is a toughie, let me tell you), went away for half an hour, came back to it, got a bit further, and was pleasantly surprised when I found I was beginning to enjoy it! A couple of niggling points, though; for one the ludicrous storyline which basically tells us that being beamed into a computer turns you into a hippy do me a favour and there's the horrible, grating music which was obviously composed by a tone-deaf masochist! My advice is to buy the game, turn the volume down and stick at Kabuki, because in the long-run you'll not want to leave it alone. PAUL RAND B02 20 Don't let go or you'll end up in the water!

"REVIEW REVIEWS AMIGA .99 BY CORE It's the near future, and the world is not a very pleasant place to live in. Conflict rules the day, and the politicians are powerless to put an end to it. The time has arrived to call upon the pure, destructive power of the AH-73M Thunderhawk, the most adyanced milltary helicopter available. Built to withstand heavy attack and carry a wide range of different weapons, the Thunderhawk is a last-resort piece of hardware, a line of defence to bring into play when all else fails. Become the pilot of this awesome flying mission and enter six distinct theatres of war, each one encompassing ten missions. Use the kit available to complete each mission, then make a speedy re. turn to base to grab a few minutes of shut-eye before the next outing Like Microprose's F15 Strike Eagle il AH73M Thunderhawk can be best described as an \"arcade Simulation\", as it too dispenses with the need to press untold amounts of keys, opting instead for simpler controls and faster action. After the long, animated intro ductory sequence, the screen switches to a view of the war-room, from where the player selects the desired battle theatre. Following a briefing by the Commander-in-Chief, which includes a short polygon-generated film sequence of the current mission, the player is then taken to the hangar in which the Thunderhawk sits, waiting to be loaded with suitable weapons. After which, it's up, up and away and into the thick of the battle. AH-731 THUNDERI FFAR ROCKET PU. Ok2LE POD MIT 2 GROSS HEIGHT:13032 103 AUTO Being a flight-sim buff who felt that F15 Il could have been so much better with a horde of keys to wrestle with, I approached AH-73M Thunderhawk with some reservations reservations which went completely out of the window once I'd grabbed hold of the mouse and got stuck into a mission! The most noticeable aspect of this game is the speed. Core have produced a product which is breathtakingly smooth and fast, even more so than Microprose's recent crop of combat flyers. That said, Thunderhawk is lacking in the ground objects department, but to be fair, the action is so intense the player has little time to sit back and admire the view. A lot of work has gone into the front-end too, not least the imaginative animated Introductory sequence which sets the tense scene for the main game perfectly. Thunderhawk reminds me of the Air Inferno coin-op, and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much I loved the all-round fluency of that game, and Core have managed to capture the same feel in their title. Sticking to a rigid set of missions instead of randomly generating them as most flight games do, Thunderhawk may not have the same long-term pull as F15 Strike Eagle il, but with sixty difficult, atmospheric sorties to fly, there's enough to keep the most ardent fly-boy up in the air for quite some time. PAUL RAND WATHER WONDERFUL WEAPONS Being a future chopper, the Thunderhawk can utilise a far greater range of weaponry than more conventional helicopters. Here's just a selection of what's available: 30mm CHAIN GUN Forward mounted, unguided: must be aimed by pointing crosshair at target 060 "

"REVIEW THUNDERHAWK AH-73M THUNDERHAWK Sese A Don't hit the oil rigs A BAVOOMA! The power station takes a direct hit! SIMULATION WITHOUT THE FUSS Being an arcade simulation, much of the fiddly stuff normally found in conventional sims has been dispensed with For instance, no need to turn on various engines and up-throttles from the key board whilst battling to keep the chopper from spinning wildly all speed and movement is controlled with the mouse only. In fact, the only keypresses required are to switch on IR and radar jammers, activate nightsights, switch camera modes and alter outside views! PSG UPDATE The Amiga version of Thunderhawk is to be joined by an ST version (also .99) and a PC version (.99). Both should appear at the same time as the Amiga game. When it comes to helicopter games, I AM the most ardent flyboy! I've been waiting excitedly for Electronic Arts to release an ST or Amiga version of LHX Attack Chopper only to be disappointed, but this is just as good, if not better! It doesn't have such an ultra-realistic simulator feel to it, because of the simplified controls and the heavily beefed-up weapons, but these features make it much easier to get into and therefore more fun to play. The graphics are simply superb not as fast and smooth as the vacuous F-29 Retaliator, but more than adequate and the fading light on the twilight missions is very effective indeed. The sounds are equally spectacular, and I'm not just talking about the brilliant rocket, gun and explosion effects, either the animated Intro, as well as looking good is full of excellent speech! This is one of the best Amiga air combat games I've seen, so even though it's not the cheapest it's got to be bought! PAUL GLANCEY WONOG.

"BYTE 2 . 19 Paul Rand, self-confessed Amiga lover and creator of Mr Benn demos, sallies forth on another 16-bit journey of fun and laughter. But he stops all that when he has to write the Bytesize column. Read on... NORTH AND SOUTH ACTION SIXTEEN .99 Control either the Union or Confederates in a one-or-two player assault on the American States, interspersed with comical cut scenes whenever anything important occurs such as fights, mail train pick-ups and the like. The game itself is jolly, enough for a budget title, but why oh why do the French insist on ruining any atmosphere by treating a serious subject in a Benny Hill style? I was expecting the Yankees to storm on dressed in big, floppy hats and bifocals! I wonder what sort of game they'd make out of the Battle of Waterloo.

Not so, according to neither yourself nor the dead Titus, in whose game a huge guy on the floor. It looks crap, it brass plaque decorates their sounds crap and, by golly, it is headquarters! Hire either an Itacrap. Oh yeah, there's also a lian mob or some Chinese seal on the packaging claiming gang, then walk one of their endorsement by The Mafia.

What a recession, you see, so they've a hoot. obviously had to flog their limos), picking up objects and OVERALL 27% SHERMAN M4 ACTION SIXTEEN .99 It's World War II, and you've been given the opportunity to take charge of a Sherman tank platoon in one of four battlezones. Go off on reconnaissance runs in a jeep, then grasp the controls of those armoured hulks and face the enemy in a series of do-or-die campaigns. Although there are better tank sims doing the rounds today, M4 Sherman Tank is an abso lute snip at the price. Fast 3D polygons, more than a few missions and a tense playing atmosphere combine to put this chea ply a cut above a lot of the other armour battle guff. TOMAHAWK .99 The CIA haven't got any dosh left to take on the Pacific drug dealers since they lost it all in the BCCI collapse, so it's all down to the Cougar a one man army who unfortunately is in cho key at the moment. The idea is to break out of nick, then go after the bad guys using a variety of transport. Horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, highspeed driving and pseudo flightsim styles all come together to make a hotch-potch of average gaming fare fun in the short term but not one to seriously consider as a purchase.

"TOMRIN IOUSK BYTE TORPEDO RANGE SETA .00 The aim of this navy lark is to steer your World War Il sub around the world hunting enemy fleets then fighting it out with all torpedo tubes blazing. The battle subgame takes one of five different forms dependent on the type of target you attack, and though the action in all of them is basic they're decent fun reminiscent of arcade oldie Wolfpack. You can also save up to four campaigns in batterybacked memory which is another plus. OVERALL 79% SHE FLOW CARD REORING! SOCCER Paul Glancey delves deep into his Sainsbury's carrier bag, pulls out his Game Boy and gets stuck into the latest batch of hot titles, kindly loaned to us by Advanced Console Entertainment (on 071 383 0480). Watch out for more next month. TONKIN HOUSE $20.00 Up till now, the Game Boy has been pretty badly served for a good footie game, but Tonkin's Soccer does something to rectify the situation. Link up with another player or try the computer side in a friendly game or an eight team world tournament. Fouls, corners, throw-ins and penalties are all included, and the game's controls are pleasantly uncomplicated making it a very enjoyable kick-about. There are some nice presentation points too, so this is definitely worth a go. OVERALL 82% PARODIUS CHOPLIFTER II them back for a mug of cocoa in friendly territory. Apart from the smartened-up graphics and the addition of extra weapons (bombs and stuff), there aren't many new features in this new version, but then when the original was so good there really isn't much else you need. An unusual and fun blast. VICTOR MUSICAL .00 This update of the Dan Gorlin classic has you rotoring across a horizontally-scrolling landscape, rocketing enemy tanks and gun emplacements. When it's all clear, pick up any hostages you can find and taking use them. At various points in each level, some rather unusual bosses appear, the first one being a pirate galleon in the shape of a cat. The game is very silly, but it's really challenging and fun, as well as good-looking. The smaller sprites are a little indistinct unless the light is perfect, but the bosses are tremendous. Meanwhile the loudspeaker provides some great sounds the music contains snatches of the Gradius tunes and some pepped-up classical tunes. All this amounts to one of the best shoot 'em ups yet seen on the Game Boy. An essential purchase! OVERALL 92% KONAMI .00 In Parodius, Konami takes a sideswipe at the console shoot 'em up establishment and why not, seeing as they're responsible for most of it? Fly either the Vic Viper, Twin Bee (from the game of the same name, which is also called Bells and Whistles in UK arcades), an OCtopus or Pentarou the Penguin into a horizontally-scrolling battle against the Parodius Empire. Each ship has a different range of weaponry, but as in Gradius, you have to shoot a crowd of aliens and collect the remaining pods before you can "

A new threat has arisen from the world of the supernatural, and the Ghostbusters are recalled into service to save NY from the evil Vigo, in a three-level bonanza of sewer exorcism, Statue of Liberty controlling and, finally. Vigo destroying. The three subgames are, um, unusual, but they are competently programmed making them playable if not particularly addictive. A good buy at this price.

"ATARI ST CRIME DOES NOT PAY TITUS .99 The Mafia obviously don't care who knows about them not only have they 'stamped their seal on the game's box, on coming to play you find they've even stuck a brass nameplate outside their HQ!

Filled 3D vectors portray the action excellently and, even though the playing area can be a bit sparse at times, there's enough diversity in the modes of transport (not to mention loads of death to be doled out!) to warrant the purchase of this large and challenging game.

The idea is to build molecules from various atoms. That's it, nothing else. No rescuing princesses or saving planets, just simple molecular science. It's rather a lot of fun, too very much a member of the Tetris School of Puzzling. As you'd expect, the more levels completed the harder they get, and you can soon find yourself hooked, attempting to get yourself out of a spot. Highly recommended to thinkers, this one. OVERALL 82% 50000 KG WRECKERS AUDIOGENIC .99 Denton Designs unleash their latest 16 bit extravaganza onto an unsuspecting world in the form of this forced-perspective 3D adventure. In this race against time and green amoeba-like aliens called Plasmoids, the player is cast as controller of a deep-space beacon whose task it is to ensure that the thing runs smoothly, whilst at the same time ridding the beacon of Plasmoids. Whilst the plot doesn't sound too interesting, the game itself most certainly is. Running around the beacon, repairing numerous broken-down pieces of equipment, and at the same time killing waves of aliens eats up time, which is not on your side as the beacon is primed to explode within the hour! Fun and japes all round, and pretty graphics into the bargain! THISPECTLET STORES BOOK FOR OVERALL 82% 087 "


"6642 SDI SIZE HIT SQUAD .99 Take control of a Strategic Defense Initiative satellite in this conversion of the Sega coin-op. Once positioned in orbit you have shoot down enemy missiles headed for the USA with the built-in laser cannon. If you really want, you can play with a friend, one player steering the satellite while the other guides the laser sight. It's all a bit like an updated version of Missile Command, and while it's not particularly addictive or attractive to look at it's a fair buy for four quid. OVERALL 72% THE UNTOUCHABLES Even more budget titles in the C64 Bytesize, which are given the once over by Messrs Rand and Gla ncey, The Two Paulies. Take it away, lads... RENEGADE III AMERICAN 3D HIT SQUAD POOL .99 Hard Mr Renegade's girlfriend ZEPPELIN .99 has been kidnapped AGAIN, Where the American bit comes and he has to rescue her from we don't know, as this is a AGAIN, but this time things are simulation of good old English more tricky. Her captors have Pool, as well as Billiards and taken her back in time, and with a Trick Shot editor thrown Renegade has to warp back to in to boot. Play the computer or Stone Age days, and kick in a a chum, and enter either the load of cavemen and dinosaurs league or championship, and to reach her. Unfortunately, take the Pool title! Although that's just the beginning, as there are a few dodgy bits such Renegade has to chase the misas the way the computer can alcreants through the timesways manage to get itself out of treams, beating up mummies in a hopeless snooker, this game ancient Egypt, knights and draisn't too bad at all. Long-term gons in Medieval times... you qualities are highly questionget the idea. Unfortunately, able, but if you've got a few gold while this looks really smart (the ones jangling in your trousers, sprites are incredibly detailed), give it a shot. Renegade III's gameplay is frusOVERALL 75% trating, mainly because your bloke is very difficult to control accurately. Even more annoying is the fact that the smallest enemies are the hardest to beat because low punches are most difficult to use! OVERALL 69% HIT SQUAD .99 Join Elliot Ness and his squad of G-Men in this six-section crusade to arrest Al Capone, and fill as many of his lackies full of lead. This was a departure from Ocean's usual film license formula of platform/puzzle/driving games, and as a result is just as interesting to play as it was when it was first released. The games does consist of platform sections (no escaping that I suppose), but the rest of the game is mostly 3D shoot-outs which look great and play nicely too. A very worthy cheapo. OVERALL 88% ODERN MULTIMIXX 3 KIXX .99 was, is and always shall be horrendous and 1943, as well as being very dull, is incredibly easy to complete. Bionic Commando, on the other hand, is one of the best conversions to ever grace the C64, and it's really the only possible reason for buying Multimixx 3. If you already own that, don't bother. Capcom's Street Fighter (beat 'em up), 1943 (shoot 'em up) and Bionic Commando (swing 'em up!) may have been classic arcade games, but this collection of conversions amounts to a real mixed bag.

"CHASE HQ GAME GEAR SEGA .00 Join two top car cops in this race and chase conversion of the hot arcade game. Driving a squat Porsche, you have to belt up the highway, avoiding the law-abiding drivers (for which you score points) and hunting down a criminal in another speedmobile, finally bumping him off the road before time runs out. This version of the game is even faster and smoother than Master System Chase HQ, and it even has a few extras, such as a route map and spare parts which provide extra speed and bump power. Shinobi was the first game that made the Game Gear worth buying this is the second! OVERALL 90% FSIZE Game Gear owners get their first Bytesize this month, as Paul Glancey plugs in and finds that Shinobi isn't the only good game on the machine...

HASTLE GOLBY! SEGA 124.00 This bizarre game lives up to its bizarre title! Golby controls the conveyor belts in a factory, and he has to switch over junctions in the belts so that the nice stuff that comes out of the machine gets to the people waiting at the bottom easy, if it weren't for the patrolling security guard who for some reason wants to lock Golby up. This is such a simple game, it comes as a major shock to discover that it's such fun to play. Definitely worth putting on the shopping list preferably somewhere near the top OVERALL 85% DEVILISH MAGICAL GUY SEGA $24.00 Here's an odd game. It's a cross between Breakout and pinball, set in a scrolling maze of gravestones and ghosts! Your objective is to bash as much of the scenery out of the way, while keeping your ball from running off the bottom of the screen using a bat, which, at the push of a button, changes shape. It sounds odd and it is, but at the same time it's quite good fun, and it makes a refreshing change from ordinary bat and ball games. One to try before you buy, but it's certainly one of the better GG titles so you should be impressed OVERALL 80% SEGA .00 An odd Japanese import, this, being a shoot 'em up which starts in (what looks like) the corridors of a school?! Guy is magical insofar as he can fly through the air, zapping any evil monsters that come his way, and he has a special Magical Gal who gives him an extra weapon when she meets him. There, told you it was odd. Actually, in spite of its oddness, it's not a bad game. The graphics are nice and smooth (especially the bosses), and the action is, well, not rivetingly exciting, but we've seen worse on the Game Gear. OVERALL 70% 089 "

There've been many snooker Sims gracing most machines, and here's another one .enter Jimmy white s Whirlwind Snooker Except this isn't yer normal 2D. Iook-down-on-the-table kind of computer snooker In Whirlwind Snooker the player is treated to full 3D views of the action from any angle desired Zoom in and out on individual balls, take a look at a prospective shot from directy be hind the white even have a butchers from the pocket which you re, hoping to pot the ball into Apart from that, the game's the same as it has been since time immemorial Pol all the reds, with a colour alter each one, followed by the colours in order of yellow, green, brown, blue, pink and black Snooker Loopy nuts are we were all Snooker Loopy Courtesy Matchroom Mob Crap Sonos Inc) There's the usual player set-up screens, and even an option to create your own trick Shots GARE CONTROL RETURN TO TABLE ARCHER 70 AORI SCORE INFORMATION 45-1 35 ARENE.\" TERLOPTE UNE DE SE IN URTE UPDATE Don't get your balls in a tangle, Amiga owners Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker is on cue for release at the same time as the ST version! A KERPOW! What a shot! TRICK SHOT Coming from Archer McLean, who kept teenagers around the world up into the early hours with Dropzone and International Karate +, this was expected to be something a bit special. But no-one told us it was going to be THIS good! Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker is simply incredible, with super-fast, pixel-perfect scrolling 3D, and an ultra-realistic game of snooker to boot. Honestly, turn off the lights and shut the curtains and you'll believe you're the Whirlwind himself, in the smokey Crucible Theatre lining up that match-winning pot! Even if you, like me, are utterly hopeless at snooker, you can't fail to be hooked in fact, just like the real thing, practice does reap its own rewards and you begin to instinctively discover the best places to hit the ball, when to put side on you even have to chalk the cue! These screenshots really can't do the graphics justice, and they certainly can't show how well the 3D works when the balls are moving. If you're the sort of person who likes prodding balls with a piece of wood, there is nothing I repeat, nothing to even come close to Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker! PAUL RAND Now THAT wasn't very good... 092 "


"REVIEW JIMMY NHITE'S A Another of Archer's little japes... SNOOKER SHOW-OFF? HERE'S YER CHANCE! Ok, so you may find that you're a complete Joey when it comes to snooker, but why should that spoil your enjoyment of the game? Just click on the Trick Shot option and open up a whole new dimension of spherical sauciness! Just pick up a few balls, put them wherever you want 'em to go, and then try and pot them like the professionals do when they're not playing in competition! Sheesh, if only I could earn a living that way... TRICK SHOT Should be a spectacular trick shot! LOOKING AT IT FROM ANOTHER ANGLE A A certain pot. Think this is the normal viewpoint in Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker, do ya? Well, you'd be wrong, matey, 'cos in this game, it's possible to take a look at the table from almost any angle imaginable. Archer McLean has cracked the problem of creating fast, realistic 3D and at the same time has come up with what is undoubtedly THE most realistic simulation of snooker yet seen on a home computer. The direction indicator helps out. BREAKo n93 "


"REVIEW JIMMY WHITE'S WHIRLWIND SNOOKER WHIRLWIND SNOOKER INTE A A bit of side can work wonders. A PCLACK! Great pictures these, eh? If you've got a snooker table you might as well make yourself some money and sell it now. This game takes up less space in the living room and is so realistic you might as well be playing the real thing! The 3D is stunningly fast and smooth, and the motion of the balls is perfect obviously all-important to a Snooker game. The range of options is exemplary, so you can view anything from any angle and, with practice, play any shot just as you would in the real game. The only thing missing which I would have liked to see is a Replay Shot option, because you can play some pretty spectacular shots. The computer opponents are all challenging players and Jimmy White himself is astonishingly good. If you fancy taking on the master or even if you're only vaguely interested in Snooker this is a game that you must try out, because it's a perfect conversion of the sport which has to be seen to be believed! PAUL WHAT THE COMMENTATORS REALLY MEAN... \"Forever the showman, the Hurricane\" (He'll have another black eye if he's not careful). \"A beautiful pot from the young challenger\" (How the hell did he put that one away?). \"There's a tense atmosphere in the Crucible tonight\" (This bloke's taking his time, isn't he?). \"There's a ,000 prize for the highest break of the tournament\" (I bet he misses the next ball). \"And the young Scots lad takes the title yet again (Thank God it's over, pint, anyone?).

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE 23.00 Street .00 BY TRECO Vou're the toughest kid on the block. Hard as nails, you are. So mean, in fact, that you're not averse to going out of doors in just your jim-jams. But word soon gets round if you're a nightclothed sort of dude some folk might even think you're a little...weird. And what's the best way to silence the gossips?

A SELECTION OF STREET FIGHTIN' MEN PER SEE BOBBY Beat 'em ups are actually few and far between on the Megadrive, so it's refreshing to see a good example of the genre popping up now and then. And while Street Smart isn't the best ever, but saying that it isn't bad either. Graphically, you can't help but compare it to Streetfighter big, bold and brash baddies compared to the relatively minuscule main character, and some welldrawn backgrounds into the bargain. The playing area scrolls from left-to-right as opposed to just a static screen, giving room to move around and, more importantly, keep out of the enemy's way, giving time to plan some sort of strategy. And with some of these guys, that's exactly what you'll need to do, it's not just a case of storming in there with fists flying. The betting idea is a good one, although I must say I fail to see any significance in it it would have been a neat touch to link the winnings in with the purchase of extra training, for instance. Probably my biggest complaint with Street Smart is the lack of moves available punch, kick, jump and a special move is all you get, and in these days the punters expect to enact their on-screen battles with a flurry of attack options. Having said that, I found Street Smart a playable game, and suitable fodder for those of you starved of the genre. PAUL RAND He's the young upstart of the circuit. Not the most powerful fighter you'll meet, but don't make the mistake of thinking that he's a pushover! The mad, bad trucker who knows how to handle whippersnappers like yourself.

"REVIEW 2525 I'VE GOT THE POWER! The key to success lies in your three attributes Power, Attack and Defence. All of these are quite low in relation to your opponents to begin with, but can be increased throughout the game, Each time an adversary is dealt with a number of energy units are earned, and these can be shared out between the three categories, depending on the talents of the forthcoming enemy sometimes you may require extra power, while others might call for a boost to your attacking or defensive skills, I approached this game with some excitement, not because the arcade game was particularly good, but because the Megadrive really needs a Street Fighterstyle beat 'em up. Unfortunately, I was to be sorely disappointed. Street Smart is competently programmed, and fairly playable, but if you're expecting something comparable with Final Fight on the Super Famicom you'll be gravely disappointed. The fact that the sprites are very small wouldn't be too much of a problem if there was a bit more scope to the gameplay. Punch, kick and a fairly unadventurous super-slap special move just don't make for ultra-excitement these days, and when the opponents don't really have much in the way of fighting technique either, the whole thing gets pretty dull. The betting business doesn't add much to the gameplay, nor does the two player mode, in which both players take turns at fighting a baddie, then fight each other. It would have been much better if you could fight the other player all the time. Desperate fight fans may enjoy this, but I suspect the majority of players will find this a disappointment.

"REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY TECMAGIK The battle of Good versus Evil is a common cause, and can be found in most games in one form or another. But Populous takes the fight to its highest level God taking on the Devil in a tussle for ultimate control of the world. Being deities, though, you won't find these two slogging it out in a boxing ring; no, as you'd expect, it's the poor followers who must take the flak. Populous is all about faith-building, closely followed by faith-smashing. Each god must build up his followers by giving them ever-bigger houses in which to, erm, procreate and become fully paid up members of whichever faith they belong to. Once enough people are available, the gods then pit them against one another in Simple, honest-to goodness fighting, until one or another race is wiped out. Good and Evil have other tricks up their sleeves, however. If things start going badly, and providing they have enough believers, they can invest that faith in a little divine intervention to tip the balance and hopefully win control. And once that happens, it's onto the next level, where holy high-jinks get that bit trickier. A Lots of mini-castles, just waiting to join together... SECTS AND VIOLENCE More wars have been fought over religion than for any other rea son, and Populous is no exception. Once a large enough army of believers has been assembled it is possible to pit them against the enemy in a number of ways. The simplest is to click on the crossed-swords icon which instructs your followers to randomly attack the opposition. The most effective form of violence, however is only possible once enough faith has been accumulated. Selecting a follower as a fighter and then choosing the helmet icon furns him into a knight with instructions to kill the enemy and destroy his homes, and that's all he does until his death sort of a biblical Terminator. The best thing about the knight is that, should he come across people of his own faith, he'll absorb the energy of that chap to become even more powerful! 104 "

The computer versions of Populous offered only four types of worlds to conquer, but with the Master System, Tekmagic have taken those, bolted on the contents of the Promised Lands expansion disc and added some of their own making a staggering FIVE THOUSAND LEVELS! That's a lot of levels, and a lot of holy wars. UPDATE Populous has been available on Amiga, ST and PC for some time now, and the Megadrive and Super Famicom versions appeared not too long ago. All are absolutely brill (even if the Megadrive game struggles to keep up with the pace of the others) and are well worth buying, along with the Promised Lands expansion disk for extra levels (sorry, only available on computer versions!). I must admit I had my reservations on seeing the Populous-cart lying on my desk. I simply didn't believe tha: such a product could be successfully converted to a console such as the Master System after all, Bullfrog (creators of the original 16 bit versions) had a hard enough job putting the game on the Amiga But I was absolutely flabbergasted at what TekMagic had achieved! Start playing and you won't believe you're using an 8 bit Sega. Graphically it's extremely close to the 16 bit versions of the game, but what is most noticeable about Master System Populous is the speed at which the landscape scrolls it's incredibly fast! And, unlike the pretty sloppy Megadrive conversion, 8 bit Populous has a redesigned control method which suits joypad play perfectly. It's heartening to see that stuft other than flickery shoot 'em ups being released for the Master System, and when that stuff has the quality and depth of Populous, It makes you wonder why you upgraded to a Megadrive in the first place. PAUL RAND EEEEEEE "


"REVIEW POPULOUS Being down at the seaside is no fun when arcades haven't been invented. MAKE A QUAKER WITH MANA The faith which increases the more people join your sect is called Mana, and Mana can be used against the opposing god in some quite spectacular ways. As has been mentioned. enough Man allows the creation floods, earthquakes and even volcanic eruptions! And remember, the more power you use the more Mania you use up, and it's a long wait for supplies to in crease, so use it sparingly. When it first came out in 1989 I liked the idea of Populous, but the novelty soon wore off after getting through a couple of dozen landscapes and finding they were all pretty much the same. Luckily this version, as well as being technically brilliant, has the addition of lots of different types of world, a feature which helps stave off any boredom. The 16 bit versions weren't detailed graphically, so Master System Populous manages to copy the look of the game almost exactly, and actually improves on It slightly by the addition of the super-speedy scrolling. The fear of the game has also been accurately carried across, and it hasn't lost any of its features in the translation all the special powers are in there, as are all the commands, with a fluent command selection system. TecMagik Populous is a very clever game indeed, and it will knock the socks Well-and-trulyoff any Sega owner who craves a good strategy game Evil wins by taking all your towns and castles!

"REVIEW REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY 21ST CENTURY ENTERTAINMENT hy on Earth can't people leave a poor little frog-like alien V V alone? There's our amphibian lookalike sitting in the bar when suddenly a wise old man approaches. According to him, the evil criminal Uncle has returned and is draining the energy from the life-towers of seven key planets. As only Pogo has any knowledge of the workings of these towers, he has been chosen to take up the challenge of liberating them. Trouble is, this time round there are \"Up\" and \"Down\" towers to contend with! The aim is different depending on the tower. On \"Up\" towers, the object is to get to the top and destroy the controlling lighthouse found there, whilst \"Down\" towers require the repair of at least 80% of the damage inflicted by Uncle and his henchmen. These goals are achieved by travelling across the walkways, using lifts and hidden doors and utilising special items to be found on each tower, whilst all the time avoiding or destroying Uncle's minions strategically blocking the route. On successful completion of a tower, Pogo must travel to the next by means of one of three subgames, played on land, in the air or through the water. POGOA GOGO O MLIRTUTADE ETT HIGH-RISE HI-JINKS Unfortunately, the creators of these tower blocks forgot to build an elevator shaft into the middle! This means that Pogo must walk along the outside platforms, dodging and killing baddies and working out the correct routes along the gangways.

MOOD CITEKTOLITET Beece WAT ATT WET OG 9866666 Same game, different programmer. That just about sums up Nebulus 2. John Phillips, creator of the quite staggering original, has passed on the job of producing this sequel to German team Infernal Byte Systems. Although they've added a few extra ideas to the basic concept of the game, such as the bonus screens and item selections, they really haven't done a lot else with it. Graphically Nebulus 2 is as good as, if not better than, the prequel, and the rotational scrolling of the towers is simply superb. Sound, though, is extremely off-putting the plinkety-plink tunes are very annoying. and in Nebulus 2 only serve to annoy the player. What grates most, though, is the frustrating gameplay which forces the player way, way back down the tower when ever a mistake is made and which puts Pogo right back to the start whenever a life is lost. There's some dodgy collision detection too: I was a good couple of pixels away from one of the baddies but still was sent hurtling to a watery doom. Sequels are rarely a match for their original concepts, and this rings true with Nebulus 2. Nice to look at, you'd still be better off playing the superior original.

There are four categories of armament Laser, E-Beam, Fire and Missile, with three types of weapon in each category (apart from Missile, which has two). These allow for the alteration of weapons systems for a particular level, should what you currently possess not be up to the job! LASER: E-BEAM: Let me ask a question: If the PC Engine is as much a dead duck as people would have us believe, how come it's attracting software of such mindblowing quality as Final Soldier? What we have here is a top blast, pure and simple. Sorry, did I say simple? The game starts off quite easy, but come the fourth level you'll be trying so hard to stay alive that half the time you'll not notice missiles flying up your rear end because you're desperately attempting to dodge five or six of them lining up in front of your ship! The game is hardly subtle as far as progressive difficulty is concerned, either. One minute you'll be soaring around, popping off enemy craft as though they were fish in a barrel. The next you'll be met with a hail of bullets so concentrated they look like, erm, something very, very concentrated indeed. Graphically, Final Soldier puts most Megadrive shoot 'em ups to shame and so does the gameplay, for that matter. What I really liked was the opportunity to select the type of add-on weapons you wish to collect before the game has even begun, adding more scope to what is an already excellent blast. Great music and FX too raucous and catchy complementing Final Soldier blasting action to a tee. Great fun.

"SRED 252 PHUSE 11 Blast attleships on the Ocean Wave UPDATE Do you honestly think Final Soldier could ever appear on anything except the Engine? Forget it! PAUSE THANKS Thanks to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the review gamecard. shot makes short work of the pod-spitting plant DEADLY ALIEN MAYHEM Final Soldier pits you against worlds of alien scumbags whose sole purpose in life is to blow you away in a hurry. Among the monstrous horrors you'll encounter are spinning discs of doom, spawns of death and laser breathing mega monsters so ugly they make your hair curl. With that lot up against you, it's damn handy you've got a limitless amount of firepower and not a care in the world about using it all... Here it is: a blast 'em up straight from the jaws of Hell and yet another runaway winner on the amazing PC Engine. Just when everybody starts to write off this ageing 8-bit machine, along comes a blast so gobsmackingly superb everybody wants to play leaving all the other machines to gather dust until Final Soldier is finally beaten. This game leaves even the Megadrive looking a bit ragged around the edges with huge, colourful sprites shifting fast above the super-smooth vertically scrolling backdrops. You'll soon lose count at the sheer number of objects whizzing around on screen and the gameplay doesn't slow on jot. Ironically, that's the only minor niggle I have about the game: there's so much going on at such incredible speed it's sometimes hard to follow enemy fire and you're blown to kingdom come before you know what hit you! That aside, Final Soldier is a damned fine slice of arcade-quality blasting, and yet another reason why the Engine will still be around when other so-called superior machines are long gone. Buy this!

"REVIEW AMIGA BY OCEAN/ACCLAIM .99 THE SIMPSON BART VS. THE SPACEMUTA Vo, dudes! Listen, man Earth's in serious trouble and its up to us to sort it all out. Check this out our poor old planet's been invaded by a load of totally unradical aliens real putrid slimebags, man and they're trying to build a weapon to take over the whole planet! This is serious, dudes, and it's up to me, El Barto to send these space mutants back to wherever they came from before everyone gets taken over by these horrible-headed alien slimebags. Now how on Earth am I gonna do that? Well, luckily yours truly has himself a pair of totally cool X-ray specs which allow me to see through the aliens' human disguises. Then I have to hide or wreck the crucial items the aliens need for their super weapon, using spray cans, sheets and just about everything else I can get my hands on! As if that's not enough, I have those evil dudes Nelson the bully and Sideshow Bob getting in the way. Somehow I've got to persuade the rest of the family to help me out, and you know they never believe a word I say! That's right, man, we're in big trouble so I'd better jump on my skateboard and get down to it before everything goes totally crazy.. RAND SPRAY PAINT 00000000000 THE SIMPSONS 500000000000 RADICAL BITS 'N' BOBS! Luckily for mankind, there are a whole host of goodies Bart can collect throughout the game to make his struggle against allen kind that little bit easier. Here's a quick look at some of the great bits and pieces our hero needs: Wow man! This is tough! As if the space mutants didn't make things hard enough, Bart has to solve some pretty obscure puzzles just to finish off level one. You can get hold of three or four spray cans to paint the purple objects red, but only three things that I sprayed actually changed colour! Dropping washing and tipping paint cans over the awning are both neat tricks, but I couldn't work out what I was supposed to do with all the other bits and pieces. Making things even more difficult is the complicated joystick control which takes a lot of mastering, simply because there's been so much crammed on there. Try to get Bart to run faster or use another object and he'll more than likely just put on his X-Ray specs while you try to work out the correct combination of direction and fire button. I'm sure I would have enjoyed The Simpsons a lot more if I could've got a bit further into it, because the later levels described in the instructions sound more interesting than the first, and I didn't even get to enlist the help of the rest of the family. This has most of the hallmarks of a good arcade adventure, but I fear Simpsons fans expecting something a bit more along the lines of the arcade game may be disappointed. PAUL DART GUN: On display at the museum, each of these also has 12 shots. Thank crikey for that! SLINGSHOT: You'll find these dotted about at the Krustyland Amusement Park, and with 12 shots apiece they make pretty darned tootin' shootin'... 114 GLANCEY "

Then the action shifts to the Springfield Shopping Mall, where those crazy mulants are looking for hals (hais?) as their second choice for building blocks. It's up to Bart to find as many pieces of headgear as he can and herally knock em oil Over at the Krustyland Amusement Park there are more mus tants, this time looking for balloons to transform into a deadly weapon. This time Bart's gotta get rid of that rubber, either by grabbing the balloons or bursting them with his slingshol Skating over to the Springfield Museum, our hero discovers that signposts are the next crucial ingredient needed by those out of their heads outer spacers. To collect them. Barl can use his dart gun. avoiding the laser trip-wires at the same time! All this leads up to the showdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where those aliens need nuclear rods to complete, their weapon. Bart has to collect them as quick as he can and shoot down to the basement to put them all back in place! TO tally radical, man! 00 TOOL WORLD SPRAYPAINT: A crucial piece of kit which Bart can use to hide important items needed by the aliens by simply spraying over them! COINS: These turn up in all sorts of unlikely places You'll need them to buy all sorts of goodies including keys, spanners, bombs, rockets, magnets and more! Bart can carry these around and use them whenever they're necessary. Phew! "


"REVIEW THE SIMPSONS OD 11 DANDY 111.14 USE 750 PAUSE 1 836 20 4 26 22 KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY! Throughout the game. Bart needs to convince his family that the aliens really have landed. Trouble is, nobody believes the little storyteller! What can poor Bar do to persuade them he's telling the truth? Simple . dispose of enough aliens to provide prool that these outrageous extra-terrestrials actually exist! Each time he totals an alien, another letter spelling out the name of one of the Simpsons appears under his or her picture. Once Bart has collected the lot, that character is convinced he's telling the truth and decides to help out! This has to be one of the biggest licenses of the year, man and one of the year's hardest games! I must admit to fearing the worst when The Simpsons first arrived. Would this be another second-rate tie-in using a tired old theme? Thankfully it isn't that, although there are going to be some mixed opinions. For my money, developers Acclaim have come up with a title which is both good fun and extremely challenging. The Simpsons smacks of quality from the cartoon-quality intro se. quence, complete with speech, through to the game it self. Looking very Bart-like, our hero is a highly complex little dude and it'll take a while to figure out all his moves, but once you have it all becomes a lot simpler. Be warned that this game is no pushover and some might argue it's a tad too tough. But with plenty to see, explore, try out and chuckle over, this is a game I'll want to keep coming back to until the challenge is finally completed. My advice is to check this out before parting with any dosh because this may not be your idea of a great game at all... TIM BOONE PAUSE TOOLWOEL 86 UPDATE Bart Vs The Space Mutants will also be available on the ST and 8 bits, and Acclaim's Nintendo game (from which all the other versions were converted) will be released in the UK well in time for Christmas!

"PRE VIEW DIDIVO GUNSHIP 2000 MICROPROSE When a game enjoys a worldwide sales figure in excess of one million copies, securing a list of top industry awards as long as your arm, it makes good business sense to release a sequel at some stage. Smash Apache sim Gunship is the software in question, and Gunship 2000 is the sequel which promises much, much more than even the original could deliver. This time around, the player is not restricted to only one chopper. Seven helicopters feature in Gunship 2000, from which three can be selected for each mission. Gone are the wire-frame graphics to be found in the first game, moving aside to make room for the sort of detailed, filled 3D views usually found in Microprose's more conventional, fighter-plane sims. With missions available in either Central Europe or the Persia Gulf, and a mission editor included in the package allowing the player to create, design and save his own custom missions, Gunship 2000 could well be as big a hit as its four-year old parent.

"GRAHAM GOOCH WORLD-CLASS CRICKET PRE VIEW AUDIOGENIC By the time you get to read this, England will have been well and truly stuffed by the West Indies in the Test match, so what a fitting time to release a game based on the \"exploits\" of our \"merry\" band of \"cricketers\". Goochy and co are brought to life on computer in a way which they struggle to do in real life. A look at the screenshots shows just how much effort has been put into making the game as realistic as possible so no doubt Hick will be out for a duck, we'll lose 5-0, and it'll start raining. Actually, we've played an early version of the game and, to be honest, it's not bad at all; in fact, Graham Gooch World-Class Cricket is shaping up to be one of the best cricket sims available.

It received quite high acclaim and sold a few copies and, helped along by 21st Century Entertainment (the phoenix which has arisen from the ashes of Hewson), Razorsoft are releasing a Megadrive version of Stormlord, complete with nine-channel stereo sound and over 400K of graphics.

World-Class Rugby lets you scrum down with the best of 'em, line up for a line-out, go on searching runs and convert that egg-shaped ball to your heart's content. But is it playable? Well, an early version we played suggests yes, but you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled to CVG if you want to find out whether WorldClass Rugby is to be the Kick Off of rugger games, or struggling to score a try.

Blindingly fast, smooth polygons whizz past your car as you forge ahead of the pack to hopefully take first place and spray bubbly onto the crowd from the winners prodium.

Bushbuck Dis a global scavenger hunt in which you (and a bunch of other players if you like) have to race around the world looking for various weird and wonderful items. Of course you don't know exactly where to look so you'll need to find clues which will get you to the correct cities before your supply of air tickets runs out. What we've seen of Bushbuck looks good fun, and you get facts on each city as you enter it, so it could even be \"educational\" as well! Horrors what a thought! VERSION DATE PRICE PC OCTOBER  TBA Here's a clue to help you find the metical This port capital on Africa's southeast coast replaced a previous capital which was on an island. Press any key to continue LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS II ACTIVISION Infocom lives! Well, maybe they don't as such, but one of their classic titles has been revived so that a sequel could be written by the original author. Unlike the first in the series, Leather Goddesses of Phobos Il is completely graphical, and there's hardly any text at all the characters' lines are even spoken rather than written on screen. As well as that, for maximum player-friendliness, the command interface is completely mouse-operated. The game starts in Fifties Mid-Western America, where aliens are about to land and claim the Earth as their own. The tone of the game is the same slightly racy spoof SF yarn, so it should appeal to anyone who enjoyed the first game. The PC version is to be released first with other 16-bit versions to follow. VERSION DATE PRICE PC OCTOBER  TBA THE KILLING GAME SHOW that has been reet females on since the dawn of hrew the earthling ground and began off her garmor ELECTRONIC ARTS CA are soon to be knocking out a Megadrive version of this Splatformy shoot 'em up which was a minor ST and Amiga hit for Psygnosis last year. The action is supposedly set in a futuristic game show, but an ED-209 lookalike leaping around a platforms, zapping strings of hostile robots seems more like a recipe for a present-day video game to us. Still, let's not be cynical, because we've seen an almost-finished copy of the Killing Game Show and it is, in fact, quite a jolly blasting romp with some nicely detailed graphics. Shame that the fab intro of the computer versions has been cut down, but that would have necessitated an 8 Megabit cartridge, and hence, a larger price tag. Psygnosis fans are also warned that Electronic Arts are releasing Shadow of the Beast on Megadrive and, according to a short EA spokesman, that will be exactly the same as the Amiga game. Oh well...

"INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS LUCASFILM/US GOLD VIEW This is Lucasfilm's latest Indy adventure epic which stars The Man With The Hat on a trip to uncover the secrets of the the lost continent of Atlantis. Whether or not this is also the plot of the fourth Indiana Jones movie is a subject Lucasfilm seem to skirt around when you ask them, but they do admit that The Fate of Atlantis is the title of a series of Indiana Jones comics currently available in the USA Anyway, back to the story. The Nazis are after Indy again because they want to construct a nuclear weapon but they need a mysterious metal which was supposedly to be found on Atlantis. Of course, only an ace archaeologist like Indy would know how to get there, and he's not too keen on helping them out. Luckily, on this adventure he is accompanied by an assistant, Sophia, who does her best to help out... or does she? The Nazis chase the pair all over Europe, the Middle East, and finally the sunken catacombs of Atlantis itself. As you can see from the screenshots, the programmers have kept the familiar point-and-click command system but have beefed up the graphic and sound elements which help make these games such great fun to play. The PC version is due out first, but other versions will follow. There are also plans to release another Indiana Jones action game alongside the adventure, and this will appear on all formats. VERSION DATE PRICE PC OCTOBER  39.99 THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND II: LE CHUCK'S REVENGE LUCASFILM/US GOLD That squirt of grog obviously didn't finish off the phantom pirate Le Chuck in The Secret of Monkey Island. Now he's back, terrorising the Carribean for all he's worth, and only heroic Guybrush Threepwood, who caused his downfall in the first game, is man enough to take him on again. The same author is putting together Le Chuck's revenge so we can expect the same brand of wacky adventuring as before, but with better graphics. The first one was a massive hit in the CVG office and we expect this one to put the shivers right up our timbers. Again, the PC version will be followed by Amiga and ST games.

"MAGIC POCKETS PRE RENEGADE Cirst seen on TVS's Motormouth, Magic Pockets is now comring to your computer screen. Sean Griffiths of the Bitmap Brothers is, as we write, slaving to put the finishing touches to the game's many levels of platform action. Each stage is a massive maze packed with monsters which the Bitmap kid has to negotiate to find one of his toys which has been stolen by ne. farious forces unknown. Along the way, there are numerous baddies out to stop Kid, but luckily he is armed with Pocket Power. After a quick rummage in the pockets of his trendy shorts he pulls out whirlwinds, freezer bombs and various other weapons which destroy 99% of all known foe, turning them into fruity bonus points. Instead of having a boss to beat at the end of each stage (which Sean thought had been done to death anyway), there's some kind of special bonus round. After recovering his tricycle at the end of stage one, Kid has to challenge a load of Frankensteinlets to a race. Beat them all to the finish line and the points are yours! From what we've seen, Magic Pockets looks like it will be a right topper game, and no mistake. Watch out for a review in the next ish.

Eye of the Storm is a vast 3D arcade game set in the turbulent red spot of Jupiter (hence the name), and these shots show just a few of the plants, animals and other craft that inhabit Jupiter's atmosphere. Strange benefactors in need of entertainment give the player various missions to accomplish for cash, but these usually involve doing something very dangerous... These shots are from PC version, but Eye of the Storm will also be appearing on the ST and Amiga. Whether or not those lesser ma. chines will be able to cope with the beautifully smooth lightsource shading of the PC game is something we'll have to wait and see.
