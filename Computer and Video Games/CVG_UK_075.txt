The System 3 guys are certainly on a roll delivering knock-out games, that pack more than an average punch, kick, butt and This time we're off to old Siam Thailand now for a no holds barred experience of the Thais' national sport. It's a mixture of boxing and karate, a lethal mix if ever there was one And it's just superb. The word \"big\" does not describe the graphics for the fighters. Huge is a much better description for these excellent cartoon creations. The copy of Bangkok Knight's I saw was almost finished but there are extra touches to be added, such as digitised speech in the later stages. But, even so, I would whole-heartedly recommend this game to you. It's a rag to riches story of a young Thai boy with a gift for street fighting, taking on the local toughs, and gradually finds himself fighting in Bangkok's top stadium.

No one was strong enough to resist the power of the Imperium. Except for a small defiant planet which had eight towering cities rising about its barren surface: the planet of Octapolis. Its secret weapon was one of enormous mental power.

You control one of three monsters -Lizzie, a Godzilla type reptile, the Wolf Man and a King Kong Gorilla monster and then you go on the rampage, smashing buildings, crushing tanks, knocking helicopters out = of the sky and generally have smashing time. The best way to play is with two or three friends that way you discover the true competitive spirit of the game!

All that's missing from the game are the fabulous prizes that are given away on television. I must admit I had my doubts about this and the other games in the series The Krypton Factor, Treasure Hunt, Countdown and Bullseye. But if the others are as good as Blockbusters, then they all should be worth checking out. BLOCK BUSTERS The game faithfully follows the format of the programme. Even presenter Bob Holness has been digitised and nods enthusiastically if you get an answer right, shakes his head if you were wrong. The playing area is a hexagon matrix. Player One must form a chain of linked hexagon from, say, left to right, while player two tries to link top to bottom. Each player selects letters which are in the hexagons. For example, a V question might be: \"What V is a raptorial bird with a naked head and neck?\" The first player to hit their button gets to answer. Get it wrong and your opponent has a chance. (The answer is Vulture). The person who gets the answer when captures the hexagon. The computer decides who presses their button first, so it's all fair and square. There's no cheating. You play the best of three games and the winner gets to go for the Gold Run, in which you are given 45 seconds to answer enough questions to cross the board. There are various skill levels and enough questions to stop the game becoming repetitious. If you like the programme and quiz games in general, you'll find this one of the best.

The peace of the village of Tautega has been shattered by the death of the Star Seer, Cas Wallen. A reclusive Drune-a sort of wizard-who lived in the Sky Tower, was blamed for the Seer's death and as punishment was locked in his own fortress by the villagers. The Drune's daughter, Reya, freed her bad old dad and to show his appreciation he entombed her in the tower! Why? Because Reya could destroy him by revealing his name to the villagers.

You have a minimum number of targets to hit. IRON MAN RACE: You must build-up and maintain your maximum running speed whilst avoiding the various obstacles such as rocks and mines, as you try and negotiate the terrain. FIRING RANGE TWO: In contrast to the fixed gun emplacements you had in the first firing range, this event presents you with a chance to practice your skills with a handheld machine gun. Robot tanks descend at random from the top of the screen and you must knock-out as many as possible in the allotted time. ARM WRESTLING: You must try and build-up and maintain maximum power to defeat your opponent. In the one player game you will be pitted against the computer, while in the two player game you'll be competing one on one. FIRING RANGE THREE: This is similar in control to the first firing range, but you must avoid shooting any of the red targets. If you do inadvertantly hit one of these, your cursor will freeze until the next batch of targets appear. COMBAT WITH INSTRUCTOR: Here you are one on one against your instructor and must use all your martial arts and combat skills to defeat him.

Luckily, in between each wave the land is cleansed. A bonus is awarded for each sector of ground left uncontaminated at the end of a wave, and herein lies the strategic element of the game. In order to get a good score, you must wipe out the enemy as clinically as possible. This cannot be achieved by merely flying around aimlessly, ENEMY RANGE You may well have been wondering what the co-authors of Elite have been doing in between counting up all their lovely lolly. Well one of the duo, David Braben, has spent the last few months developing the first ever game for Acorn's new super-computer, the Archimedes. Entitled Zarch, it is a mixture of arcade and strategy rolled into an absolute hum-dinger of a game that will probably sell as many Archimedes systems as Star Raiders did Atari 400s back in 1981 You are the pilot of a Zarch hoverplane, with orders to save your planet from infestation by a deadly red virus being sprayed over the countryside by waves of marauding aliens. The game contains a three dimensional, sculptured landscape, complete with hills, lakes, trees, and other landmarks. The action elevation actually changes as your plane gains or loses altitude. Flight control is via the Archie's three buttoned mouse. Actually manoeuvring the plane is not at all easy, and is based on the principle of a central mouse position'. The direction and distance you move the mouse away from this central position, determines the \"compass direction the plane will face, and its declination (angle of dip) to the ground. By combining these controls with the thrust button (left hand mouse button), the plane can be flown at any speed, at any angle, in any direction... quite a handfull As you press the thrust button, a beautiful plume of matter spurts out the back of your plane, and is left hanging in space like a three dimensional wake. Alien ships each have their own plumes but such is the power of the Archimedes, that the smoothness of the animation of each individual matter particle doesn't even flicker when the processor is called upon to handle a number of planes concurrently ENEW RANGE HIGH 001000 PL 1 001000 "

The game remains as good as ever, probably the best strategy game on the market at the moment. The single player tries to establish himself on a map of the ancient world a Roman Empire, deploying troops and commanders in variable-length moves of about 20 years. The game has no end and no objective, except survival (the real Roman Empire lasted more than 1600 years). Like the real Romans, the player will find that he has to conquer the world just to stop the world from conquering him. If the game remains as good as ever, it is hard to see what the converters have done with the Commodore's extra 16K of memory. The playing map is actually smaller than on the Spectrum 2076 GEAH WWW This is the Spectrum version of Gunship, the best flight/combat simulator available on the market today, based on the American-built Apache combat helicopter now coming into service with the US Army. Microprose has now produced Spectrum versions of most of their best-sellers. But Gunship has so much in it that the question was always whether they could fit it all into a Spectrum's memory and graphics. I'm afraid that the short answer is no. The scenarios have all been kept, but the solid WAT LEAS PLN 1 BATTLES IN NORMANDY Y Y Omahah, Utah and Sword beaches, the American drive on Cherbourg, and the three British attempts to take Caen in the Villers-Bocage, Epsom and Goodwood offensives.

Battles in Normandy is an operational Corps level game of eight scenarios covering the major battles of the campaign before the breakout: the American airdrop at Carantan, the crucial landings at There is also, as normal with SSG games, a design routine enabling players to develop their own scenarios. If all this sounds like a development of the earlier SSG Corps-level game Battlefront, then that's because that is exactly what it is. Scenarios developed on Battlefront will run on Battles in Normandy and vice versa. SSG provide, as a rule, expensive but high-quality games. Battles in Normandy is well below their normal standard.

"GAVG YSHIP ROAD TO chance the Germans had of winning on the Eastern Front, a quick victory before the Soviets could build up overwhelming forces, and before the dreaded Russian winter could take effect. On the campaign scenario, which covers the entire war, the Russians will surrender only if every city on the screen (Moscow, Stalingrad, Leningrad and everything west of them) are captured. Since this is just about impossible, there are also four one-year scenarios for each year from 1941, with their own victory conditions. The player has to concentrate on two essentials: keeping his crucial Panzer forces well forward, but in supply and not so heavily engaged that they become useless, and judging when to call off an offensive and prepare defensive positions for the winter. The end of the game, by the surrendering of either side, can sometimes be triggered by accident, which is annoying. The game is meant to save directly onto the playing disk, a good idea but with the review copy it didn't work. But these are minor grumbles at what is a good computer wargame with an excellent playing mechanism.  MACHINE: CBM64  SUPPLIER: ELECTRONIC ARTS FOR GAMES DESIGN WORKSHOP PRICE: NA REVIEWER: STEVE In this game of the Eastern Front in World War Two the single player takes the Axis forces (the Germans and their allies) against the computer as the Russians on a map that covers the whole Eastern Front from Finland to the Crimea (achieved by having East at the top of the map so that the Germans attack upwards). The playing mechanism could hardly be more simple: in the order phase, each Corps is landscape view and multiselected by joystick and moved with up to five directional changes, coloured map have been then in the movement phase they replaced by wire-frame hills and all attempt to move together. trees, and the cockpit layout is far harder to read than in other The computer calculates how versions. far such a unit could actually move The problem is that Gunship over that type of ground in those is in fact so good.

Something of SSG's view of the campaign comes out in the fact that all three were German failures. The main game on the disk, however, is one of grand strategy starting with the German invasion 6 ARMEE NORMAL directive RETRERT DO in 1941. Each Army Group (or Russian Frontal Command) revises its moves and objectives once a week. But once every four weeks the higher command may allocate resources, priorities and strategy. The computer can take as many roles as required. The problem is that much as for Europe Ablaze, the player who opts for high command has to sit through 15 minutes of the computer bleeping to itself. If the player takes one or more Army Groups as well, it becomes 30 minutes. As the graphics are very poor ones used on Battlefront this is 30 minutes of total confusion and boredom.  GRAPHICS REALISM  VALUE PLAYABILITY Russia combines features of two earlier SSG games, Europe Ablaze and Battlefront. Unfortunately, they are some of the worst features of each game. Like Battles in Normandy this game uses the basic three divisions to a Corps organisation of Battlefront, renamed as three Corps to an Army Group, and there are three training scenarios: Army Group North's drive on Leningrad in 1941, Army Group South's drive on Stalingrad in 1942, and Army Group Centre's Fresh EXC LOS Open Supply Admin ARMUROT INF Ground who ALAN "

Hundreds have been sold to date and if last year is anything to go by a last minute rush is on the cards. For those of you who do not know what to expect at a P.B.M. convention, read on. This year's convention takes place on 20th February 1988 at The Porchester Centre, Queensway, London W2, which is a straight 300 yard walk left from Royal Oak underground station. The 22 P.B.M. companies in the U.K. are attending and a few of the companies that have already confirmed that they will be attending are: Sloth Enterprises, Mitre Games, Spellbinder Games, Legend Incorporated, D.M.C. Games, Jade Games and The Laboratory There are many others, but I cannot list them all. There will be a large number of amateur P.B.M companies attending. This is your chance to talk to the games masters and owners of the companies and put your questions and queries to them direct. Find out about games that you wanted to join but were not sure about, meet friends and enemies, and chat to the players of every game. This is a golden opportunity to find out first hand what is going on in the P.B.M. scene as well as pick up a few freebies. You can also find out all about the B.P.B.M.A. players association and join on the spot. The organisers also realise that most players of P.B.M. are closely linked or involved with Fantasy Role Playing, so they have organised a large F.R.P. display as well. There will be live roleplaying, run by the Labyrinthe Club, where you can actually participate in dungeon adventures or watch demonstration adventurers, a F.R.P. stall where you can stock up on all the latest games as well as buy miniature figures, paints and other accessories, an AD+D open their booklet \"Guide to P.B.M.\", which covers every aspect of P.B.M. including playing hints and tips plus advice is still available.

"DEAS CENTRAL DEASRAL Nebuli Hewson's Nebulus -a C+VG Game of the Month in December is probably the most original game concept of the year. It's simple that doesn't mean easy-and very addictive. Programmer John Phillips has written this exclusive guide to his game. ebulus is a unique game in which the character you control Pogo-has to climb and ultimately destroy a series of mysterious towers which rise from the sea on an alien planet. Pogo works for Destructor Inc, a demolition company given the job of destroying the towers. These towers are covered with ledges, lifts and tunnels. Some of these ledges disolve when you step onto them, plunging Pogo into the sea, others are slippery and will send him shooting along. Pogo's progress is further hindered by flashing blocks and bouncing balls and leering eyes. What makes the game so Level 1 Level 2 Level 2 1: THE TOWER OF EYES bouncing ball without getting too returns. Once you have arrived on the close.

The next few robots are fairly straightforward to pass. Thefourth one requires good timing to jump over. Alternatively you can wait on the ledge next to it and a spinning alien will come along and knock you down a "


"E18 Players Guide special is that when Pogo climbs the tower rotates. The 3D scrolling has to be seen to be believed Right, over to John Phillips for his tips. General Hints and Tips The key to completing a tower is to learn the most efficient route to the finish. For the first few towers this is straightforward. However, the later towers give several choices, some of which lead to dead ends. Make a map. Make a note of where the dissolving ledges are. Some need to be avoided by jumping over them. Others have to be fallen through to get anywhere. One of the main hazards are the spinning aliens which when there aren't many other fly across the screen. These can aliens around so you should be easily be avoided by careful use of able to predict their appearance. the tunnels.

Now XOR is available for the C64 and Atari ST. The game consists of 15 graded mazes, each more cunning than the last. By completing each of the first fourteen mazes, you will get fourteen letters that form an anagram. But all is not as it seems as these letters are also coded, thus perhaps A=E or C=H. It is only by completing the final maze, that the code is revealed, giving you a chance to solve the anagram. In each maze, you control two shields, that can be moved under certain conditions, dictated by the other elements in the maze. Each shield starts in a different part of the maze, and you often have to bring the two together, so that they can work in harmony to solve some of the trickier logic problems. Your task is the same in all the mazes, and requires you to collect every mask of XOR you find. This may sound easy, but with the exception of maze number one, it requires ever increasing powers of logical deduction as you progress through the game. Some of the elements in the D mazes include ducks, that will always move towards the left when they are free to do so, and fish that will always drop downwards the vertical equivalent to ducks! There are also bombs that can be dropped on the maze elements, causing a digitised, three block wide, explosion. It is vital to master the use of me bombs because it is all too easy to blow up a mask by mistake. Other mazes are populated by weightless dolls that can be pushed in any direction, and a contain blocks that can only be passed through in certain directions The graphics, and movement in XOR are rather similar to Boulder Dash, but any real similarity between the two games ends here you move about the All PLE mega-machine supplement 0001 160 RANARAMA It is only by reaching the lowest are likely to be in the room with dungeon, and defeating the most you.

Diamond Games has been guilty in the past of releasing sub-standard product such as their abysmal chess program Checkmate This time they have come up with an original and enjoyable little game that will appeal to many of the puzzlers amongst you. Diablo is based on the old mosaic puzzle, which consists of a matrix of jumbled up tiles each with a portion of a pattern or picture. The pattern can be restored by sliding the tiles either vertically or horizontally In Diablo the matrix is made up of 119 tiles, each containing ty pieces of track. At the start of the game, a ball appears at the top of the screen, and starts rolling long the track Each time the ball rolls from one tile to the next, the track on the tile it has just left, disappears. So, as the game progresses, ERIES LEVEL 81 HRAP FONT 858 BONUS SCORE 1588 and, for the first part of each level, you must also stop the ball from rolling off the edge of the screen. To do this you can manipulate tiles, just as in the original puzzle, by sliding them into the \"tileless\" square on the screen. When you can see there is a long stretch of joined up\" track ahead, you can make the ball roll faster to save time, although it is all too easy to suddenly discover the balt has got nowhere to go with little or no time to do anything about it. With plenty of screens, and a random track generator thrown in for good measure, Diablo should keep ST owners amused for long enough to justify the .95 price tag. But at .95 the Amiga version is not such good value. It's a lesson companies are going to have to learn if the Amiga is really going to take off as it should do. Let V.F.M. be the lesson.

"MACHINE: ATARI ST SUPPLIER: INFOGRAMMES/ERE INFORMATIQUE PRICE: $19.95  VERSION TESTED: ATARI ST BUBBLE GHOST death and yet is still fun to Sadly most games, progra and/or released in the UK, dont fall into this category because it's not what the predominantly male market wants, or are portioned to want by TV ardiente software publishers Anyway, the Bubble Gosis at the games that be necesso shows your score, lives remaining need m e room number, and high score. grap One final One final point of interest about gauty and ease of contre this game is its apparent popularity on tive and fun tor with women. For whatever reason, though 1995 price tag Bubble Ghost seems to appeal to on the sees side female gamers. I'm not suggestin for one minute, that games should be tailored to the tastes of one sex or the other, but it is nice game that has no violence Bubbles are definitely in at the moment. No sooner have we had Firebird's excellent Bubble Bobble than Infogrammes chip in with Bubble Ghost Luckily the two games have very little in common except that they both have the word 'bubble' in their title and are both fun to play. In fact Bubble Ghost features one ghost, namely you, and one bubble. The bubble in question is your soul which has unfortunately been separated from your body. If you can call it that. Your soul is so light and fragile that it has taken on the appearance of a bubble and, as bubbles do, it will burst when prodded, or even touched, by anything sharp. The scene is a giant old castle, decked out with the latest in surrealist high-tech equipment bristling with sharp edges. Unlike your soul, you can move through any of the objects in the castle's rooms without danger. The only way you can be reunited with your soul is to blow the bubble out of the castle, by guiding it past all the nasty bits in each of the many rooms. Each room is seen from the side, the graphics being simple but effective for this type of game. The rooms are variously decked out with futuristic looking heads, pointed lances that go in and out of the walls, and crystals (sharpededge of course) that pulsate, growing and then shrinking, inviting you to try and pass them before they grow again. Many of the hazards can be removed by cunningly blowing in the right place. Take fans, for example. These have an annoying tendency of blowing your bubble off course, invariably into something pointed. A quick puff on a fan's power pack will take the wind out of its sails for good, allowing you to pass safely. Other 'blowable' hazzards include trumpets and candles. Wherever you find a trumpet, there's a fair chance that the room contains a seemingly impassable object or hazzard. By 'blowin your own trumpet' the char are that you can remove the hazzard leaving you exit the room. As you get deeper inte castle, better timing and a reactions are required negotiate path narrower, and more objects problem what you do is move the ghost round the room with your mouse, using the left and right buttons to rotate it either clockwise or anticlockwise. Being a ghost, you are impervious to all the sharp edges which are so damaging to the bubble, so you can move freely, passing through objects and hazzards in true ghostlike fashion. To blow the bubble, you simply position the ghost alongside it and press the 'shift' button. The bubble will then be blown away from the ghost. Thus, if you want to blow the bubble up, you must position the ghost below it, pointing upwards before blowing. The jelly-like animation of the bubble, as it floats across the screen is superb, and when it pops it actually looks like a bursting bubble. The ghost character is equally impressive, especially immediately following the loss of a bubble when it frowns and putsats hands on its hips accusingly, as to say \"you careless wally!\" The general room graphite good but not stunning, bath sound effects are definitely above average for the ST.

"VOCABULARY ATMOSPHERE  PERSONAL VALUE PER table, and the occasional table the crumpled paper, and the small piece of paper. The plot is somewhat linear, with side branches at frequent intervals leading to the player's arrest for the murder (end of game) but the puzzles to enable the dead-end branches to be bypassed are quite clever, and give satisfaction in solving. The further one gets into each of the three parts, so the ram save STORE command becomes more and more useful, producing a highly playable adventure in place of what would, prior to ram save, have been completely unacceptable. A ltogether I found Jack The Ripper pleasantly unpleasant to play. This is certainly St. Brides' best to date. The text descriptions flow long and atmospheric. It is amazing to think of the amount of development effort by programmers that went into the bug-ridden Sherlock, also a Spectrum game, compared with the superior results achieved here in a shorter time by nonprogrammers using what is a commercially available adventure creator utility Brides' School, did perhaps help with the atmosphere. Secondly, this is the first commercially available adventure written using Gilsoft's Professional Adventure Writer-the successor of the Quill. It's capabilities are most impressive, as you will see in a moment-to sum up, you could say that here is Sherlock without bugs. The comparison with Sherlock is inevitable. Ripper is set in London in about the same period. Couple that with real-time playing so that other developments are happening \"behind the scenes\" as time ticks by, and you will begin to get the picture. Multiple word input is accepted, and indeed, necessary from time to time, so as to be able to distinguish, for example, between the fine carved Jack the RIPPER THE SECRET THE CROWN OF RAM HOTEP/ THE PROSPECTOR cursor key, making correction of typing errors a chore.

"ADVENTURE ADVENTURE, Ferd. And it came to pass that the Fiend descended from the Folly to move among us ordinary mortals and go in search of adventure. Or rather adventure games. Was he pleased with the state of play? Read on to find out in the latest missive from Folly. FIEND I stood atop the Folly the other day, looking down upon my domain and amusing myself by observing the scurryings and bustlings of you mortals, when an idle question popped into my craggy cranium: just how many adventure games have i bought for old faithful in recent times? And more to the point, perhaps, just how many new adventure games have been available? Us Fiends are nothing if not dynamic, and leaping forth upon the very instant I set out to investigate. The day was beautiful, with dark glowering clouds pouring forth and reducing the daylight to a mere glimmer, so I felt confident enough to slink abroad before the hour of sunset, for once. I honoured the nearest large town with my presence, and sought out both Boots and Smiths in order to count the number of adventure games upon their shelves. Methought this would be a fair indicator, as the twain dominate the High Street in software terms. And to be really magnanimous, I would condescend to count the Commie 64 games as well, despite the fact that these are usually way beneath my notice. The results of this Fiendish survey are as follows: Adventure games for the Spectrum in Boots, zero; for the 64, zero. Adventure games for the Spectrum in Smiths, zero; for the 64, zero. It does not take a mind as powerful as mine to figure out that the sum total of games for both machines in the giants of the High Street retailing was zero. And before anybody shouts \"foul\", the Fiend would point out that he counted them all twice, and promptly took himself off to another large town to repeat the survey, in case the first was subject to followers, but mind you don't break something inside your feeble brains. Is the fact that the software houses can charge more than  per game for the new machines seducing them away from the older machines, where .95 is considered expensive? Or is it lack of new software that is causing the upsurgence of the cottage industry GAC games that seem to be proliferating? Whatever answer you decide upon, I will tell you this. If a mega-game came along tomorrow, then the buyers of the said High Street stores would insist that it was packaged in a double-sized cassette box. It was very apparent that both operate a full-price-big-box, budgetgame-small-box policy. I mean those big boxes really make the games look worth , don't they? BAH! This makes the Fiend very angry, for he loathes and hates big boxes. They are a total waste of space. It's not so bad for me, for I can always find another cave to store things in, but the average house soon fills up, to no purpose. This may come as a shock to the said buyers, but these boxes take up TWICE the storage space of the little ones, and are very inconvenient. But I suppose that yet again I am a lone angry voice screaming in the wilderness. You lot probably like large boxes. It's probably the pretty colours that attract you. Double BAH! So I conclude this month's scroll by thumbing my large hairy nose in the general direction of the stores' buyers, and to all you who think that big boxes are a pretty neat idea! A Fiendish PS: How do you like my new photograph? Rather flattering, don't you think? Signed copies are available... some statistical fluke. And the Darkness? results were identical! No Oh it's all right for all you adventure game here, either. Swanking about with your 16Where was Rigel's Revenge? bit machines, you have the Where were Dracula and world of adventure at your Frankenstein? Where was the feet.

There is an engine temperature guage just below the track so you can see when you are close to overheating. If you overheat, you stop and have to wait a few seconds at the side of the track, you also lose time if you mistime your leaps over obstacles on the course and fall off. The obstacles on the course include dirt ditches, lumps of grass, other riders, steep platforms, and little hurdles you can wheelie over.

You must infiltrate the alien rebels' headquarters, braving force fields, fantatical killers guerillas and the like before encountering the final confrontation. Initial signs suggest its captured all the coin-op thrills. SEO HITS Howdy, pardners, and get ready for some German Wild west fun. Sounds bizarre? Well wait till you see Western Games, a wacky sporting spoof from Magic Bytes. The events are: Arm wrestling: battle of biceps, as you struggle to force your opponent's arm onto the table first. Shoot the beer: Take a steady aim and a fast draw to shoot the froth off the beer. Tobacco spitting: Chew on the baccy and spit into the pot at your opponents' feet. Be careful not to hit him though-you'll lose points. Can can: The saloon girl demonstrates the dance first then all you have to do is copy her. Milking the cow: Be careful, or Daisy will kick the pail over, and you'll have to start all over again! Eating the beans: Scoff down as many tins as you can in the given time.

That's the stark if somewhat over the top message at the start of Ocean's Platoon, the Vietnam war game based on the highly successful film released earlier this year. The idea is that you lead your platoon of men through the Vietnamese jungle with the ultimate aim of finding and killing a renegade brother in arms. The six-part war thriller's release will coincide with that of the video sometime in January. You control five men in your platoon, each capable of taking five hits. The game starts off in the jungle which you must explore, avoiding the enemy who leap out at you. The aim is to find the entrance to an underground tunnel. And then into the dark, water-logged tunnels to find secret stores. The Viet-Cong leap from behind corners and emerge menacingly from the water to attack. The next section is in the bunker where the VC come at you under cover of night. You have a small supply of flares to light up the night sky in the hope of spotting the snipers. It's then onto the hunt to find your renegade colleage holed up in a bunker and blasting away with a mortar. But to get to him it's back into the sniper-ridden, booby-trapped jungle and finding your way through a maze of paths. 03 $200 $0.00 142 READY TO LOOK "

Written by Peter Jepson and Eric Christensen from Denmark, Thunderforce is set in a deep cold dungeon were you've been imprisoned by a bunch of criminals! You have learnt some very secret information about the underground chemical factories the bandits are running. The dungeon is very well defended and it is difficult to escape alive. The guards are very human at first, but as they see your efforts to escape they start using more powerful weapons to stop you. As the game proceeds your attackers adopt more devious and violent means to prevent your escape. Out now for the C64 at a bargain 2.99! Clever and Smart are well known cartoon characters on the continent but are virtually unknown here. However, that won't stop you playing this game from the German software house Magic Bytes. Clever and Smart are two private detectives. Clever is able to disguise himself to help in his investigations. Smart is an egghead. In the game, Clever and Smart must freeze the kidnapped Dr Bakterius. You control Clever, and with the aid of money, bonus points, and devious disguises, you must discover hidden clues and implements which will help you in your mission. Sweet Scene....... "

"Computer + Video Games 30-32 Farringdon lang London ecmr zau Mailbag: Now you and everybody else must know about Play By Mail, well I think it's about time that PBM should not be taken lightly as a two page feature in C+VG. think that PBM should take up a few more pages in C+VG and maybe go on to be another sister magazine to C+VG and CU as an adventure magazine just like White Dwarf. Surely PBM is a growing hobby and should expand on to other new magazines, don't you think so too! It is obvious that most people would agree with me so please do something about this. Wenchin Ng, London. Editor's reply: What do the rest of our readers think? First of all, congratulations. How have you managed it? You've managed to keep the price of your mag down to 1 but you've just about doubled its size while almost all the others have jacked their price up to about .25 or shrunk until they're just a cover and a few pages. Second, why don't Micropose release more Amstrad versions of their flight sims? I'd like to see Solo Flight II and Gunship so how about it, tune. How about including a demo of 720° or Out Run on a future cover cassette? balances the price.

Also Berkshire. I feel that the size of the Editor's reply: The price of games which you buy ST software is dropping quickly and you can expect it to get cheaper. Paul is a big fan of the short story idea watch out for one soon! Until I read your Play By Mail page in the May issue of C+VG I had never heard of PBM but from that day! have enjoyed every minute of it. Crime review, I joined and it's been a delight to use the old grey matter in something more taxing than blasting aliens to bits. After turn 10 I am pleased to be second in the notoriety list but also with a much larger gang than my nearest rivals. So out went the computer. I would just like to thank you once again for introducing me to PBM and maybe one day we will cross swords in some game we are playing. Leslie Bunker Devon. Editor's reply: You are one of many new recruits to the joys of PBM, Leslie. Glad you enjoy it. How about trying some other games? Well, here I am again, with two grouses (grice?) this time. (A brace of grice?). catalogue them as follows. 1. Who is the old bat running Ideas Central? Where has Melissa gone? I warn you now that I will be there in horrible person to wring the truth out of you if no satisfactory answer is forthcoming. Fiendish notice is hereby given that I am drumming up support for the \"Bring back Melissa\" campaign, and we shall not be denied! 2. Am I wrong? Did I really note at a casual glance that the ST version of \"Indiana Jones\" guys? Back to the magazine. I loved the cover cassette but the music sounds nothing like the Thundercats' only runs in medium resolution on a colour monitor? Is it standard practice, or should all games run in all three modes? If forking out over 20 quid we deserve to know in advance what equipment is needed. Should this not be an essential part of your reviews? I rephrase that, it I have been housebound MUST be an essential part of for the last nine years with your reviews! agoraphobia and apart from 3.
