"CVG NEWS the wired-up gaming news section Are Nintendo about to PlayStation for PC? connected NO-GO ULTRA 64? fall at the second hurAliens invade the Amiga dle with Ultra 64? And Magic Carpet back x2! if they do what next for Dangerous Playstation software Is Ultra 64 coming or isn't it? We've heard some nasty rumblings from Nintendo Japan and it isn't just morning-after curried sushi syndrome... them in the home Dodgy 3DO software yes ! market? Knuckles changes name Disturbing rumours have reached our ears that Nintendo have been forced to scrap the Ultra 64 because of its high manufacturing costs. Nintendo, who originally claimed a $159 price-point, have apparently been told by development partners Silicon Graphics that the minimum costs for the basic hardware would be $349. Add to that other components such as joypads, CD drive, packaging and distribution and we estimate a UK retail price would have to be set at around . If this is true, Nintendo won't be able to survive in the home market just with the Virtual Boy (see CES report last issue), so the likelihood is it would plough its money into on-line systems and set-top boxes. However, Nintendo has recently signed up UK-based company Software Creations as an Ultra 64 developer which either means Nintendo is staying involved with the coin-op hardware, or that the machine is still going to happen. More news as we hear it. However, the Saturn Jaguar CD launch date set pushes forwards with Shinobi x late again an enhanced version of Primal Rage goes multiformat Virtua Racing. Cosmic Race crap official "


"NEWS CVG Connected ALIENS IN AREA SATURN VIRTUA RACING REVS UP With Acclaim gearing up to launch their remarkable Alien Trilogy on PC CD-ROM this autumn, Wakefield-based Team17 look like they're going to steal the march on them. Currently in production is a 3D version of their not-unlikeAliens smash Tower Assault. It promises to deliver the same kind of pulse-battering action as the 2D versions, but with incredible 3D graphics and it's on Amiga. Just feast your eyes on these pics. There should be a PC version scampering along later in the year Time Warner, not Sega, will be producing the Saturn version of Virtua Racing. The game, which is scheduled for release at the end of the year is going to be an enhanced version of the coin-op, mainly because of its improved graphics and more tracks. Warner are also releasing the Saturn version of hit coin-op Primal Rage around the same time. The game's being converted by Probe, and is destined for just about every format around including Mega Drive, SNES, Amiga, PC and 32X. Work in progresses coming soon. FLOPPY DON'T TAKES A CARPETING Bullfrog's CD ROM mega-smash Magic Carpet is set to appear on floppy disk this summer. It turns out that the game engine tseif doesn't take up too much space and will happily sit across four olde worlde diskettes and all you lose are a few sound effects. And speaking of Carpet-connected disk stories, Bullfrog have just realesed a data disk for the game containing 30 new levels and should be in the shops right about now. It also looks like there's going to be a 3D0 version in the offing as well let's just hope it doesn't end there and we see it on PlayStation or Saturn too. POSITION One minute we're sitting back pleasantly watch288. ing all these wonderful next-gen games roll in A Bigger and better Virtua Racing Saturn promises to be at the heady rate of great, but Daytona'll be here first. three a month, then Cosmic Race comes along. It's quite unlike Please don't waste It's one any race game we've your money on this of those ever seen. You control it sucks. bikes out this sort of levitating of bike thing which bobs Battlestar around nicely in 3D, Galactica. and that's it really. In fact it's totally crap, so we'd thought we'd tell you about it so you don't rush out and blow nine million quid on it, or whatever importers are charging at the COURSE moment. The 3DO version of Magic Carpet is due to roll out later in the year, possibly around Christmas time. "


"C vs NEWS Connected 058 LATE OCEAN AGAIN GET TUFF Last month we said we'd have Shinobi X for you this issue, but Sega has put its release date back yet again. We'd like to say to you it'll be here next month, but we're not going to stick our necks out again... A Shinobi X on Saturn has slipped on Sega's release schedule. When it arrives though, with its digitised characters, it should look top. Aeons ago we previewed a promising platformer from SCI called Mr Tuff. Well it still has potential, only now it's coming from Ocean. The game, which is currently only on SNES is due out in April, so we'll tell you if Ocean has scored a hit or should have held on to its cash next issue. CLOCKWORK KNIGHT WOUND UP FOR UK Sega's more-miss-than-hit platformer Clockwork Knight promises to arrive in Britain with the Saturn, and a suitably revamped image. The game, which rated a moderate 74% in the February ish, will have more levels than the miserly four it came with in Japan. If that's the case, and Sega isn't telling porkies, it could be one for potential Saturn owners to add to their hit list. An improved Clockwork for UK release? Ocean has a pile of releases for the next couple of months, including the Mega Drive Mister platformers Mr Nutz and Mr Tuff. Tough cookies, or nuts? PLAYSTATION | YABBA DABBA PC BOUND? 06/ Flintstones next month. With Creative Labs' 3DO Blaster card already on the shelves, rumour has it that Sony is working on a similar project to furnish PCs with a PlayStation equivalent. The board, which would plug into the standard PC slots would only make use of the machine's power source, monitor and CD-ROM drive. However, the same time we heard this little story, we also heard a conflicting report that, no, Sony isn't working on a hardware add-on, but is actually planning to convert some of its third-party PlayStation games to PC. This sounds a bit silly because without custom graphics hardware only Pentium machines and above would be capable of running games such as Ridge Racer. We should know for sure this September when the PlayStation is launched. Fans of the Flintstones movie (If such a beast exists) will be pleased to know that the game is finally set to surface on Mega Drive next month courtesy of Ocean. You know, one day someone will bring a game out the same time as a movie. But then again there's probably more chance of John Major turning into a three-headed Zamwoop from the planet Plim before that happens. "

"cVG NEWS connected SPRINGTIME FOR JAG CD The Jaguar CD unit is due to be launched this spring; there are no software releases confirmed yet, though. At long last the Jaguar CD drive is set to appear. Atari is promising it will hit the shelves before summer priced at a mere .99. The unit is officially due to be launched at the spring ECTS show at the end of March, with the general launch following a few weeks later. The machine itself fits into the Jag's cartridge slot but don't worry about having to unplug every time you want to play a cartridge game. Atari has sensibly built a through-port into the device so once it's in you never have to unplug it. As for software, well, there hasn't been a confirmed release yet, and, worryingly, there weren't any on show at the press launch. However Atari's marketing manager Daryll Still was confident of having at least six titles on the shelves with the machine. However, we did get a chance to play with the built-in virtual light machine, which produces loads of incredible effects in time with audio CDs. It's hardly a reason to buy the unit, but it's very impressive all the same. ROCK, SCISSORS STAR WARS SET FOR SATURN! JABBERCRACKERS Our spies in Japan have tracked down one of the reasons why the 3DO has done very well out there. Go into any 3D0 software stockist in Tokyo and you'll find shelf upon shelf of 'adult-orientated' software. It looks as though the Japanese have got this stuff down to an artform. Being the investigative types we are we thought it necessary to look into this burning issue. Of the titles we sampled, the most interesting has to be Strip Rock, Scissors, Paper a sort of updated version of the old playground game. It really is sordid stuff. Choose either rock, scissors or paper, a young lass makes her selection and if you win she loses an item of clothes. I don't know, any excuse for a bit of porn. As yet unconfirmed reports from Sega have reached us that it has already wheeled out the development wagon for a Saturn-specific Star Wars game. Provisionally titled Rebel Strike, it looks like taking the best scenes from the three movies and combining them in one game. The speederbikes from Return Of The Jedi are most likely to feature along with plenty of space combat. If this is the case, and Sega is working on this (face it, it would be dumb not to) it's unlikely we'd see anything before the end of this year. No taxing gameplay here, you have a one in three chance of winning and getting these women to take their kit off. It's as sad as it looks. salamat A The rumoured game heading for the Saturn, Rebel Strike, is probably going to be an amalgamation of the Star Wars Trilogy films. th Big credible licences are what the new machines need, and a decent Star Wars game would do the Saturn a lot of good.

"NEWS CVG connected VIRTUA FIGHTER FOR NEPTUNE LAUNCH STIMET a 99% OFFERY 99 Sega has confirmed that The Mega Drive 32X System the all-in-one Mega Drive and 32X unit will arrive in September. Previously known as the Neptune, Sega is hoping to hit a retail price of under $200 and possibly bundle it with Virtua Fighter. If Sega manages to do This it would be nose-tonose with the Jaguar for a stake in the entrylevel console market. 0930 832 1-4319 Although these are Saturn shots, the 32X version of Virtua Fighter promises to be almost identical as the machine uses the same processors. Sega hasn't set a price for the Neptune, but it should be around . ONE MOTHER SEGA GETS BACK TO BASICS OF A GAME Another title set to appear around the same time as the 32X System is this excellent-looking shoot-'em-up called Motherbase. We had a sneak-preview at Sega's HQ and can tell you this game looks like being really hot. It's a sort of vector graphic-based version of Viewpoint, but faster and more varied. More news soon. With everyone gearing up to produce amazing 3D and polygon-based games, Sega has stepped out of line and produced what looks like being a red-hot platform-based shoot-'em-up. Alien Soldier, from top programming team Treasure, is completely over the top, but combines some superb features to make a game that we can't wait to get our hands on. Watch out for it this summer. From the team behind the excellent Gunstar Heroes Alien Soldier looks like being a real smash. If this plays half as a good as Viewpoint, Sega will be on to a real winner. We're certainly looking forward to it.

"EKNO REVIEW CVG 10800 10000 S PlayStation PLAYSTATION On Import Oi! You! Yeah, you about to turn the page. Stop right there and read this, it's bloody priceless. goddesses A It looks good, doesn't it? Well it bloody well isn't. These screenshots are flattering. ook, forget about this game, it's crap it's the story that makes it 2000. OK, sitting comfortably? Right. You see there was this king called Love Radient III, who lived in the castle of Love Radient on the planet LoveRadient, which apparently is a nice place be Tyou're the sort who can live fe without watching The 0000 RADran VERDICT Now LoveR III has two twin daughters, Nina and Syilin who, despite all this ove and stuff are a bit good a scrappin'. Anyhow, the evil Carmilla ms up (you can tell she's evil *cos she ears the black costume and employs unrea stic-looking cartoon henchmen). who's a yourger version of that Repulsor woman out of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, kills their old man, nicks Castle LoveRadient and turfs the girls out on the ears. Anyway, for some reaSon Zeus (as in the grand god of kebab herders) steps in and gives the two girls the powers of Love and courage. Ahh. What this means is that their tight-fitting spandex leotards morph into tightfighting spandex leotards with plastic bits. After that, which is played in a rather tasteful movie sequence, the game starts and it's all down hill from there. It's a laff though, ain't it? Unless you buy it, that is. Pirgend Battle Fighter plect A Live action meets car. toon. Just like Roger Rabbit, but crap. PLAYSTATION Few beat-'em-ups could rival this. The game itself is a steaming pile of pimply (I can't use the word 1 want to here) crap. There are almost no moves, only six enemies, the controls suck and the graphics are pathetic.

LET THE BATTLE COMMENCE! Cybersled features the usual beautifully pre-rendered intro that we've come to expect from these new fangled machines and shows the six sleds having a good old scrap over one of the maze-like levels courtesy of some inspired camera angles. Ah PLAYSTATION Namco PlayStation Namco's second arcade conversion hits the PlayStation, but can this blaster match the exhilaration of Ridge Racer? cybers o you remember a crusty old coin-op called Battlezone? Bearing in mind that it debuted some 15 years ago, Battlezone's graphics are a bit ploppy by today's standards, and comprised garish green wireframes overlaid on a black background. Set over a flat landscape with odd bits of scenery to hide behind, the aim was to destroy your opponent's tank before he trashed you. Simple but highly playable basically. Whizzing through the cosmic threads of time to 1995, Namco's Cybersled follows a similar pattern. Except the graphics now consist of polygons (which in this version are fully texture mapped with an option to select the plain polygons of the arcade ver. sion), while the levels are set over a number of maze-like areas that become increasingly hard to manoeuvre around. These levels are litfor each of the six controlTable sleds; the standard above-and-behind or the more realistic but difficult-tocontrol first-person perspective. Each sled has a rating out of five in three categories; weapon and shield strength and speed. The sleds tend to range from lightly armoured but extremely fast affairs to a high powered and ultra strong tered with pick-ups behemoth that moves as which include missiles well as an elderly elephant and shield boosters, plus a with no legs.

"TEKNO REVIEW CVG MY SHIELD Like Starblade on the 3DO, Namco has provided the original graphics as well as a souped-up texture mapped alternative. 03 A An interior view is available but unlike Ridge Racer it's harder to play with. A Missiles dish out the damage, so a few direct hits should ensure victory. SECOND OPINION I can't say I was the biggest fan of the original arcade version of Cybersled, but even so this comes as something as a disappointment considering how smart Namco's PlayStation version of Ridge Racer is. This plays like an arcade game in that it's great fun the first couple of plays, but it soon becomes repetitive and while it might be worth spending a couple of quid on it in the arcade it certainly isn't worth 90 of the bleeders. If you're looking for a class blaster on the PlayStation then Raiden is far more deserving of your cash. MARK PATTERSON VERDICT ALTERNATIVE ARCADE Cybersled About a quid The original arcade game is starting to look a little crumbly but is still a decent enough blast, especially with a mate. ISSUE 149: 82% PLAYSTATION Cybersied lacks variety and as a one player game soon becomes tiring. The original's saving grace was its two-player link up but the two-player on offer here is split screen and dull. The imaginative Battlezone-style controls have been dispensed with and in their place are two cumbersome control methods. As an arcade conversion it's admirable though, and the graphics are actually better thanks to plenty of texture mapping. It's also a shame that Namco didn't add in new features to the home conversion like it did with Ridge Racer. RIK SKEWS 03 A Partly replenish your shield by rolling over this green cross.

"TEKNO REVIEW CVG Use smart bombs sparingly you'll need them for the bosses. SCREEN THREE Raiden, unlike most games of the genre, doesn't con fine itself to your screen. As you play events around the periphery of your vision continue as normal which usually means someone's shooting at you. There are two ways you can alter the screen to get a better view of the opposition (and more room to avoid them). The first is Panorama Mode which expands the thin strip of play area to fill the screen, meaning more Sideways movement but less fore and aft play. The best setting is Arcade Mode which runs the picture up the longer part of the screen, meaning you need to turn your telly on to its side to play the game properly. A The arcade conversion is an almost exact replica of the coin-op. The little fairy that you can see here distributes random power-ups. VERDICT The bosses in Raiden are, without exception, very large indeed and take quite some killing Keep an eye on what's happening to the far left and right of the screen or you'll come a cropper, SHOOT THEM TO BITS Raiden harks back to the days when power-ups were power-ups. When simply collecting a few icons would arm your sprite with an array of weapons which sweep the screen clear of enemies in milliseconds. There are three, count 'em, different kinds of power-ups. One switches your main gun between a rapid-fire cannon, a powerful laser and a homing beam (each of which can be powered-up three times), the sec ond grants the use of extra missiles (forward firing or homing, depending on the icon) and the last, ever handy smart bombs. There are two types available, one which produces a single huge explosion and one which ignites a number of little explosions. The second is the more powerful weapon, but it does need careful aiming for maximum effect. PLAYSTATION All right, so Raiden doesn't exactly look like a groundbreaking piece of 32-bit software for Sony's new hardware star, but it's still one of the best games to be released on the PlayStation so far. It's nice to play a game which relies on playability and challenge to impress, as opposed to a half-cocked 3D control system or somesuch. Both the games on the disk are incredibly rock hard, even on normal level and should keep the best gamers going for some time. Easily worth a go. (Watch out for the easy to find cheat though.)

His search takes him to all sorts of strange locations: a pirate ship, a fast food restaurant, a magic competition and even the Three Bears' cottage. Yes, Simon Il is even wackier than the original, and looks to be just as much fun. Simon Il is a big game, with over 80 locations, more than 100 characters and truckloads of tricky puzzles.

Don't they remind you of the plant in Little Shop of Horrors, though? Runt is caught reading by his dad, who doesn't think much of such intellectual pursuits. Shades of Monkey Island here: Simon gets press-ganged and ends up pris. oner on a pirate ship. The book is Sordid's old spell book, and by burning it Runt's dad has summoned the evil sorcer er. Whoops! AM NOT NICE Somebody's going to wind up in the stocks, and you better hope it isn't you. Sordid rewards Runt by making him his appren. tice. Runt's first job is to locate Simon and bring him to Sordid. Once he's found young Simon, Runt conjures up a magic wardrobe to bring him back to Sordid's tower. One of Simon's many tasks is to win a magic competition. Not being a very good wizard, he'll have to resort to cheating to get what he wants. Simon has grown up since the first game, he's still just as nosey though, as he nips into the closet. Although Simon II has roughly the same number of locations as Simon I, the locations are much bigger. Most of the locations scroll, and the biggest are three screens wide. Many of the screens also contain animated objects, making them far more detailed than the backgrounds seen in the original game. These woods are just one of the many places you can visit, though as you can see the characters haven't been added yet.

It is pool (and not the more Anglicised snooker) that is the subject of this preview. What is so cool about Virtual Pool though has to be the control method: when you take a shot you simply hit 'S' and your mouse becomes a \"virtual' cue, and shots are taken by dragging the mouse across your mat. Obviously the further you drag your mouse back the harder you can hit the cue ball.

Here you either team up to destroy the common enemy which, frankly, isn't half as much fun as the other mode where the aim is to simply blow each other out of the sky.

A I just said, \"Off you go Dredd, it's an early shower for you\", and he went mad. SNES M This looks somewhat thrilling, does it not? Dunno what's going on, though. he producers of One Foot in the Grave probably thought they were being really clever making a series about a grumpy pensioner, but sadly they'd been beaten to it some years before by 2000AD comic. Surely the world's most thoroughly miserable old bloke must be that bastion of law and order Judge Dredd, played somewhat implausibly we'd of thought by Sylvester Stallone in the forthcoming movie of his adventures. Now comes your chance to grab a slice of petty-minded vexation with the official game of the film. We'd love to tell you what the plot is, but to be perfectly honest we haven't a clue what it's about, except that it's got something to do with some perps and judges and there's quite a bit of shooting. And the judges ride these cool bikes, and they've got one of them in the window of Planet Hollywood, but it looks really cheap and plasticky up close.

SNES The Judge Dredd movie has been in production hell for about five years now. The project was first announced with Sylvester Stallone cast in the lead role, but he dropped out before shooting started. A succession of other un-famous actors were linked with the flick before Stallone repented and reprised the leather kecks of Dredd under the condition he was allowed to take his helmet off indoors (which, of course, Dredd never does ever). A year down the line and presto, Judge Dredd is ready for the big screen. Having seen some clips we can say, hand on heart, that it looks ace. As to whether the plot will be up to scratch is still anyone's guess, however. Judge Dredd often, as a part of his work, finds himself in dangerous situations. Here is one as an example. Looks mighty perilous. SNES All your favourite 2000AD characters called Joe Dredd make an appearance. JD pops down to Hell for a spot of demon-bashing. Or it might be a steelworks.

CVG takes to the track... Elite is aware of similarities between the games, and has included plenty of features to set the game apart. For one, you're not racing on a narrow track. Because this is an off-road game you're at liberty to take your motor for a little jaunt through the countryside as you try to track down short cuts or ways past the other driver. Elite has also tried to spice the objectives up a bit, instead of normal first-across-the-line courses. Each stage features HP 1:1 ISIP The two-player mode promises to be far friendlier than Stunt Race's. Dirty tactics yes! That's what we want. t doesn't take a genius to spot a certain similarity between this and Nintendo's Stunt Race FX. That's partly because Dirt Racer is powered by an SFX chip, the same type as in the Nintendo game, and though the SNES is a great piece of kit, it is a little limited when it comes to producing complex polygon-based objects such as the cars in Stunt Race FX.

"CVG LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH  PRIZE WINNER in the bag COMPLETE NUTTER I think I can predict the outcome of the front cover of Issue 159. When plain polygon Lau comes in to attack Toh Shin Den's wonderfully texture mapped Eiji, Eiji will simply sidestep to the left (a move which Lau is not capable of performing) and smack Lau in the ribs. Consequently Lau will fall on his knees and give Eiji ample time to finish him off by decapitating Lau with his sword. Lau's dismembered body would then fall to the ground and gush out polygonised blood, but only a couple of polygons, because the Saturn can't handle too many! Frank Wiseman, Ayr 'All Aussies living in England should be sent back courtesy of Slowtugs Animal Freight UK'. Yes that's the sort of contentious issue we like to hear at CVG, SO if you have an issue that's burning a hole in your pocket (though what it's doing in your pocket God only knows) write to us. CVG: We take it you're a PlayStation fan. CHEAPSKATE I am a bit upset about the price of games and acces. sories for consoles. Recently I purchased a Super Nintendo and all of a sudden the Saturn, Jaguar and 32X come out. I mean a Jaguar would set me back  plus the  or so for each game. I am sorry but not every one can afford  plus for games. Andrew Bell, Newcastle NEO GEO CD MOANS It really angers me to see how late SNK has left it before finally releasing a machine with reasonably affordable software. its timing is pathetic, Mr Blobby could have done it quicker. If the Neo Geo CD had been created a couple of years ago SNK would be the giants of the British game industry by now, while Sega and Nintendo would be struggling for survival. With its GENUINE arcade-quality graphics and sound it would have been a massive hit. As it stands today, no matter how successful the Neo Geo CD is, SNK will find it impossible to overtake Sega and Nintendo's domination of the videogames market. K Murray, Riverside, Glasgow A-250 CVG: Unfortunately, software doesn't come cheap any more, and although the hardware is relatively low in price (admittedly the new consoles are expensive, but the 16-bit machines are dirt cheap) the basic premise of Sega and Nintendo getting you to buy their machines is that they can then make money on the software, you dig? Plus the cost of making a game these days can run into millions, Ground Zero Texas and Wing Commander 3 for example, and this reflected in the final price. And OK you've just bought a SNES, but if you can't afford expensive games then at least there's a back catalogue of loads of great games at reasonable prices for that machine. So you can't afford a Jag, Saturn or PlayStation, I'm sorry but neither can a lot of people yet, but eventually when they're released over here they'll be a lot cheaper than import, and unfortunately games are a luxury and they don't come cheap. UPER Famicom atendo CVG: Even today the Neo Geo is still something of a technical masterpiece, but its problems lie in the chronic lack of variety of its software. Even if the games had always been available on CD instead of massive carts we doubt whether there'd be any more punters willing to shell out for endless beat-'em-ups. Plus SNK's best titles have been successfully ported over to other formats which offer a greater variety of software. on SUPER NINTENDO WRITE TO: IN THE BAG, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 3032 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU OR E-MAIL: CVG@emapimag.demon.co.uk. 54 "


"LETTERS CVG J MORRIS IS A PRAT 1 After reading Mrs J. Morris' letter in issue 159 I felt that I had to reply to her comments. I realise that she may not actually read this letter if it's printed, because she's obviously way above the likes of CVG readers. But why do these people just go on pushing their prehistoric views on to us. If we the readers didn't enjoy reading your magazine we would not buy it. As for her mentioning the glorification of pornography and violence, what a load of tosh. I think she must be reading the wrong magazine. The computer magazines are on the bottom shelves, not the top. I feel very sorry for her son. It must be very boring reading walking magazines and playing games designed for the under threes all day. I will not prevent my daughter from using game systems, I was rather she was in her room playing Doom, blowing people away gratuitously, than out in the street, where anything can happen. Most children go into crime because they have nothing better to do with their time. Is this what she really wants from her son. I realise that these are my views, but I am sure that they are the feelings of most games players, who are always told that there's too much violence in games. This is rubbish, after all it is only a game. What about the violence on the news everyday, and this is shown throughout the day so anybody can watch it. People like Mrs Morris are the reason that censorship in the UK has been pushed to ridiculous standards. Thank you for spoiling it for everyone else. To Mrs Morris, on behalf of video gamesplayers all over the country, get stuffed and keep your views to yourself, ya miserable old mare. Christopher Stevens, Cheltenham Glocs J MORRIS IS A PRAT 2 J MORRIS IS A I can't believe Mrs Morris nicked her son's CVG saying itD DA would make him abnormal. This is going too far and I think she should have a good look at her past to see What doctor let Mrs Morris what has made her so abnormal. So much for her so out, eh? It's people like called facts. She even admits at the end that they are this who are butchering the action and horror not facts anyway. Let's go over to her comments and movies on TV, video and at make them truthful: the cinema. Mrs Morris FACT: Video games give pleasure to millions by showing please crawl back under violence (among many other things) who most or all your rock and stop spreading bad press and insult(such as myself) would never dream of hurting anyone in ing not only every game in any way. FACT: Video games show sexy women in order to provide the world but one of the entertainment. These games are made by boys for boys. best magazines in Britain. Most of us are fairly intelMale game designers are not going to show lots of sexy men in their games. There would be more girl-orientated ligent and open minded games if there were not so few female game designers. and I feel most people FACT: Video games increase intelligence, hand-eye with Mrs Morris' attitude are frightened of new co-ordination, puzzle-solving abilities, reflexes, memory etc. technology and just have a bad case of technofear.

"THE REVIEWS START HERE... CvG reviewed this month... MIA f you haven't guessed all ready, Dark Forces is superb. You may also have noticed the large amount of PC software this month that's where most people are headed at the moment. It's simply because a lot of companies are planning PC to Saturn/PSX conversions, so don't be surprised if some of the PC software you're seeing now appears on console at Christmas. Still, with 16-bit titles like X-Men 2 and Air Cavalry, there should be enough stuff on the way to tide you over the summer months or until you win the lottery and buy a 32-bit machine. Mark Patterson Grant Foster FACL hot , but what cadire ted loor Jungle Strike p.75 X-Men/Arcade p.78 What we're playing this month X-Men/MD p.80 This month's hot-hits Streetfighter 3. Completely thrilling, homes. Capcom will have to go a long way to top this. Return Fire p.84 MARK Dark Forces/PC Having had a crap Mark Hamill hair-cut a few years back, I suppose it makes sense for me to like this. It's bloody good regardless of what any other mags might say. Raiden/PSX One of the most explosionthirsty shoot-'em-ups in history and a refreshing change from the waves of bland half-finished polygon games on PSX Stone, Paper, Kalackas/3DO Low on game, high on undressing is the best way to describe this bizarre amalgamation of playtime contest and pervery. Here at CVG we don't give high scores away lightly. A game has to be rather special before it scores 90% or over and a CVG Hit. Even rarer though is a CVG Gold (awarded to games that have pushed back the boundaries of gaming) but don't expect to see more than a few of these a year as it takes a score of over 96% to earn one. Anyway, here are the top games this month... Dark Forces p.58 RAD X-Men/Arcade Probably my favourite game of the month. Packed with ludicrous special moves and sporting toply smartness graphics. Hopefully this will set the pace for future beat-'emups especially Streetfighter 3 which could end up being a massive white elephant. X-Men 2/MD Well, alright, perhaps I am a bit of an anal X-Men bore, but this really is a dead good game, honest. No, really. And I've got all the comics too. Beavis and Butt-head/MD The game might be a bit crap, but you can't deny that it's funny. And you've got to laugh, incha? Especially being a bit of a reformed rocker and still young enough to be a 'yoof it sort of appeals to my childish nature which is most of it really. 58 Dark Forces/PC 75 Jungle Strike/PC 78 X-Men/Arcade 80 X-Men/MD 84 Return Fire/3DO 86 Metal Marines/PC Windows 97 Sonic Drift 2/Game Gear you can run people over in tanks and armoured vehicles. Asterix/MD The big-nosed, garlic. eating, vino-swilling, peddle bike-riding, beretwearing, foul-breathed wrong side of the road driving hero makes an almost welcome return. But not quite. A damn fine game though even if it is a bit, you know. Frenchlike. They have good food though, but they can't make a decent pizza. X-Men/Arcade At last, Capcom releases a new one-on-one beat-'em-up. and it might as well be GARY Return Fire/3DO A superb mix of arcade and strategy elements which allowed me to indulge in my strange unnatural cravings for death and mass destruction. And The big picture If any other version of a game is available, then we'll tell you via our Alternatives and Other Versions boxes. We'll even tell you if it's destined for any other formats. For consistency's sake, games retain the original scores in alternative boxes. 52 "


"CVG REVIEW PC CD-ROM Shoot-'em-up Virgin .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned Is this really just Doom with lasers, or has LucasArts managed to come up trumps yet again? Iright, we're not going to kid you. In many ways this is a high-tech bloodless Doom in that it's 3D and you spend more time shooting than thinking. What really makes the difference in the action is having laser bolts whizzing through the air from all angles. In Doom the first you know of something appearing behind you is when it starts gouging huge lumps out of your back. Here it's when a pencil-thin laser bolt singes a sideburn and sets fire to the wall in front of you, proceeded by you swearing loudly and reaching for the run button. As expected, you play a mercenary who's (barely) on the side of the Rebel Alliance who, with the help of a few of his mates in the Empire, is out to make the galaxy a nicer place by rubbing out stormtroopers and nicking top-secret information and this is what helps make the game so good. Rather than just run around blindly blasting everything in sight, each mission has a number of objectives to complete, which normally include finding a certain item, assasinating or rescuing someone (depending on whether you like them or not) and saving your own 380960 backside. The LucasArts 3D is noticeably more powerful than the one used in Doom. The graphics are clearer and, as in Origin's System Shock, you can look up and down as well as jump and crawl. This actually serves to complicate things at times, as you're often so busy fiddling around with the keyboard trying to look up and shoot something that you don't notice what's coming towards you. dark forces < Phasers to stun. Oh bugger, there isn't a stun setting only certain death. A You start the game with a crappy little pistol. Easy on ammo', light on power. CUTTING EDGE As the game is set between the Star Wars flicks, you obviously need to be kept up to speed on the latest goings on in the Empire so plenty of cutscenes are provided. It's this progressive storyline which really sets Dark Forces apart from other 3D action games. Here the scene is set in the production facility for the Emperor's new toys dark stormtroopers. One of these blokes is worth a dozen rebel fighters, which makes them quite hard really. GAME BY LUCASARTS CONTACT VIRGIN INTERACTIVE (0181-960 2255) FOR INFORMATION 58 "

"CVG REVIEW Some of the stages feature massive drop,s which means certain death for cow-footed Rebel agents. NOW WHO'D LIVE IN A DOOM-BASE LIKE THIS? You're not confined to Imperial bases in the game, instead you're allowed out and about for a spot of fresh air, including a dabble with mountain climbing on an ice world which is more like a platform game than a shoot-'em-up. Finding the crampons here are essential as it's impossible to stop yourself slipping on the ice. 0900211 A Look, up there! You can look down too. BGB DDD D SECOND OPINION The Doom clones are coming thick and fast, but when LucasArts becomes involved in producing a Doom lookeylikey I'm not one to complain. What I could complain about, though, is the lack of a network option (this multiplayer option made Doom rife from nine to five in many an office building). There's also a lack of blood and guts and not too many Star Wars references in later levels, but apart from these three whinges, it's great, believe it. GARY LORD 888 DB . 02 VERDICT The concussion gun is just one of 10 neat weapons in the game. PC CD-ROM I could never imagine this turning out to be anything less than amazing. The action surpasses Doom for several reasons you have better and more varied weapons, the sound eff. ects are amazing and, naturally, Star Wars-heads like me love anything as long as there's a stormtrooper in it. The 17 levels are massive, varied and challenging, which explains why you're given three lives as well as generous amounts of energy and shields. Dark Forces is every bit as good as I hoped and is clearly the best Star Wars game yet. MARK PATTERSON 350 033 0 A Ain't that the bloke who fired that big laser on the DeathStar. I thought he'd died. Still, with your three-way gun he won't last long. ROLL OF HONOUR This is your mate who you've got to rescue in one of the missions.

"CVG REVIEW SNES Platform Acclaim Unconfirmed Out March/April Game Boy and Game Gear versions available Mega Drive version planned HOW DO THEY DO THAT? If you're one of the many people wondering just how the Stargate team produced those cool morphing effects, wonder no more. So long as you've got a PC CD-ROM, that is. A new product entitled The Secrets of Stargate is now available, featuring Quicktime movies illustrating the production of the film and the full unadulterated trailer for you to feast your eyes on. If you're not sure you're that interested and don't fancy spending lots of cash on the finished product you can find an abridged version on the cover of this month's PC Review. ALE Words cannot convey how cool the animation for Kurt's wobbling-along the balance-beam Gladiatorsstyle skills are. A Behiiiind yooooou! Oh yes it is! Oh no it isn't! It's a star, it's a gate, it's a film... it's three wishes in one! It is possible! An Egyptian God looks lonely. Poor chap. stargate orget Mario and Street Fighter, Stargate beats all comers for the first translation of a video game to the big screen. A coin-op by the name of Stargate hit the arcades over ten years ago, and while it had nothing to do with Egypt, sand, pyramids or paedoerotic costumiers, it obviously inflamed the imaginations of several Hollywood types enough for it to hit the cinema more than ten years later. Well, you know what film production schedules are like, they're always putting things back and performing re-edits. And now, a bit like with the proposed Street Fighter 3, the movie has been converted back into a different game by those mighty marvels at Probe. You play the part of Kurt Russell and his hair, running through the desert with a gun and limited supply of grenades on a mission to save his buddies (and the world). Along the road there are a number of sub-missions, such as collecting supplies for the starving alien/Egyptians, which aid your progress. At the end of the game lies a showdown with arch girlface Jaye Davidson, the outcome of which decides the fate of the world as we know it (except not in real life). James Spader must die!

"REVIEW CVG Hopefully this picture should demonstrate just how throbbing with action Stargate is. Because it is, you know. NA Having your knees chewed by large (and largely unidentifiable) creatures is a constant worry in Stargate realms. You know, they have beetles that big in Egypt. It's true. saw it on telly. A A cricket-loving Middle Eastern deity takes exception to Kurt's chin (which looks like a bum ha ha). Kurt's gun isn't actually much use. You have to depend upon his supply of grenades most of the time. A Each level features a number of sub-sections. Some are set in caves, some in buildings and others are set in other sorts of places. VERDICT This little screen here tells you your missions and how close to completing it you are, along with information about your possessions and general well-being. DEZ MISSION TIND ELDERS SNES There's not really anything original in Stargate at all, but that doesn't stop it being quite good fun. The graphics are pretty sharp, the action moves at a fair old lick and the level of challenge is balanced towards the higher end. However, it must be said that you probably already own Stargate under a variety of different names, and unless you're a real platform blaster addict this is unlikely to get the hormones blazing. RAD AUTOMATIC A KURT NOD You know, that happened to me just the other day. What a bummer. GRAPHICS 90 SOUND 83 PLAYABILITY 87 VALUE 69 It's not an easy life as Kurt Russell. Your eyes are too close together, you've got a silly chin, and to top it all off you're being menaced by hordes of angry Egyptian gods and their giant beetle cohorts. Luckily, Russ (as we like to call him) is pretty sharp on his platform skills. He can run and jump as per usual in platformers, but he's also picked up a few Prince of Persia-type talents too. Pull down on the joypad and your little man lowers on to his haunches to stealthily inch forward on his knees or roll grenades across the ground to stop them bouncing away from enemies. Kurt can also hang from the lips of platforms, shimmy up and down ropes, walk into rooms and appear alongside Goldie Hawn in Overboard with a straight face ALTERNATIVE SPECTRUM Big Trouble in Little China Skrelpsoft/.50 Die-hard Kurt Russelll fans should lap up this amazing slice of gaming history.

Buy equipment with these great equipment-buying sections. he war machines of the future, it would appear, will be giant bipedal death robots bristling with massive laser cannons and piloted by top-crack, battle-hardened elite troops. Which is a bit short-sighted, if you ask us. What you really want is a tiny, spherical flying thing piloted by remote control so no-one gets hurt. And it could have special, silent invisible guns which fire around corners and everything. They could call them killex 2000s and the pilots would become known as Killjockeys in the cyber-slang of the future. That'd be ace. Of course, though, things don't work like that in the wacky world of games, which is why in Battledrome you find yourself stalking a large arena engaged in single combat with another giant robot of similar stature. Every aspect of real-life giant robot fighting has been included, which means you need to use both hands to control the thrust, pitch and turret movement of your war machine.

"CVG REVIEW PA1200 Pinball Sim 21st Century .99 Out Now No other versions available CD32 version planned, A500 conversion likely 21st Century has given us Dreams and Fantasies, now it looks set to top the Codie's excellent Psycho Pinball with its latest little metal ball sim... ninball eath wielding nutters, scantily clad foxes from Babesville and psychopathic bungee jumpers are just some of the delights that await you in the latest game from 21st Century. Sadly these aren't characters in the game but situations from the three pinball tables on offer. This is a game from 21st Century after all, a company who seems to have single handedly swamped the computer market with pinball sims. That isn't a bad thing though, as they've all been decent enough products. Thing is Pinball Fantasies, sequel to the original Pinball Dreams, didn't really offer anything new, just more tables. Doing that a third time would probably be pushing things a little so thankfully Illusions has a host of new features. Most notably there's a multiball feature, a first for computer based sims, but of course beaten to the market overall by Codemasters' Psycho Pinball on the Mega Drive. A startling hi-res mode is also available which allows the player to see nearly all of the screen at once, although the downside is that there's fat, black borders along the sides of the screen. There's also a whole host of brilliant new mini games which the player is given the chance to play when they've hit certain targets in the right combination. Oh, and the tables are larger too. Whooh! ANOUE BURGER RACE The bonus games take place in the LCD table at the top of the screen. And they're great! ACK put JACK JACH mut This is what a table looks like in hi-res mode. It's most useful when in multiball mode. Unfortunately you just have to put up with those big black stripes down the sides of the screen.

It looks rather splendid and is a really neat idea but poorly executed. NOT PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED TRAR VERDICT AGB SECOND OPINION A1200 Like its predecessors Pinball Illusions plays a smart game of the old metal ball. Special praise has to go to the graphics and sonics which are first rate and a considerable improvement over the earlier titles. I particularly like the sound FX which have been used very cleverly, so when the ball drops past the flippers in the Babewatch table for example, it's accompanied by a splash of water. Illusions' new features, particularly the multiball, make this the most complete and enjoyable pinball sim on any format. RIK SKEWS I don't know about you but if I want to play pinball I go down my local pub or arcade. As far as I'm concerned computer pinball will never compare to the real thing, but that said Digital Illusions has done a far better job than most. The graphics are excellent, although it's a shame the hi-res mode doesn't fill the screen completely and I love that Beach Boys-style Babewatch music. As a game it's undeniably fun, with some superbly designed tables and bonus features, and it's worth considering even if you have the first two titles. GARY LORD SO WHAT?

VERDICT esides everyone's collection of Marvel (and the odd DC) comics piled in the bedroom when you were just entering teenhood was an additional pile of reading material, which contained the likes of Asterix, Obelix, Vitalstatistix and Big contact Brenda (whoops that last one was a different pile). These Gaulic adventures were only equaled in my mind by Herge's Adventures of Tin Tin, but Sega hasn't just released a game called Tin Tin and The Golden Crab, but Asterix and The Power of The Gods, which I am reliably informed is based on Asterix and The Chieftan's Shield. This is essentially a platform romp, at first sight anyways, but what makes the game such a delight is that there are elements of other game genres: that is RPG, adventure and shoot-'em-up styles are mixed in to the non-linear approach that the game takes. Basically you, as either the little fella or Obelix, have to retrieve the chief's shield which those pesky Romans have roamed off with. It doesn't make a whole lot of differnce who you choose, especially as the animation captures the humour and graphical style of the books perfectly. There are 20 different levels taking you as far a field as India and Egypt, but you don't have to start at the same point, you can wander via a main map into a number of locations. The adventure-style ele. ment comes into play in that you'll need to solve a puzzle or find a certain something before you can progress. A There are various stop points where you get advice. 3.22 MEGA DRIVE After the deluge of lovely, flash platform romps at the end of last year it's good to see something like Asterix come along. Why? Because it's something a bit diff' to the Sonics, Headdys and Ristars which are Sega's mainstays.

Acclaim has tried to tie the whole thing together with a couple of backdrops based on scenes from the flick, and some dodgy digitised pictures.

At least we've got the True Lies game to make up for that abomination. In fact, the game is just the violence from the movie, and bears little resemblance to anything else which transpired which means that crappy love bit in the middle doesn't appear. What has happened though, is a shoot'em-up which is more than a bit similar to Renegade's The Chaos Engine, ie a Commando-style blast with extra weapons and eight-way scrolling: and that's it really. Shoot a few terrorists, try to avoid killing honest, law-abiding American citizens who get in the way, grab a few extra ammo clips and repeat. But shooting in anger is the name of the game, and that's it really. Not much thought, not much more than naked aggression. Sounds perfect. But it isn't. It looks like a classic example of a licence not only gone bad, but hitting skid row, drinking bottles of Thunderbird down in one and asking for any loose change, sir'.

It's a definite maybe... 000 et's just get one thing straight this isn't as good as Mario Kart, there isn't much that is. What Manic Media has created is an all together more serious karting sim, which fits the PC's idiom perfectly. But is that what people want? KEVIN MOORE Who knows, certainly this PLAYER 1 SELECT DRIVER is a very slick game. The 3D engine is powerful, fast and flexible enough to run even on slower 486s. This is partly because it rather clever adjusts the frame itself, rather than wait for the PC to get so tangled up with calculations that the whole thing starts running slower than a sloth through a cesspool. We do recommend though, that the feeblest machine you try this on is a 33Mhz with 8meg, because if the frame-rate drops too far it's like watching a zoetrope version of the game. The gameplay itself is dead simple. Bomb round the tracks, collect cash on the way, spend it souping-up your kart, then bomb around the next track. It's hardly revolutionary, but it's the multi-player mode that makes it a winner. Sad loners with no friends can challenge the game over its numerous courses which feature in the league mode, and are damn tough when you set the game to hard mode.

Terrorist, one missile. Sorted. jungle strike He interrupt this becadcast for a special rep VERDICT PC his is Jungle Strike, pure and simple, and beautifully created (or should we say converted) for the PC. Which is somewhat of a contradiction because Jungle Strike, with its tale of evil desert madman, Kilbaba Jnr, taking on the good ole US of A, is very un-PC. That's not stopped Gremlin however, taking EA's original Mega Drive game engine and creating what resembles a cracking conversion of the isometric, 3D shooter. The principal craft you take control of in Jungle Strike is a storming Commanche 'copter, and to control it (or the hovercraft, stealth fighter or motorbike) simply use the keyboard or joystick to manoeuvre your craft. The good thing about Jungle Strike is that the helicopter (et al) is PDQ and when aromoured vans, trucks and HARVS are in the area, you can usually dodge cannons and missiles once you've mastered the control method. The Strike series is very playable, and the PC is no exception, and as you complete each section of a mission you become more adept and eager at facing the next lot of guns and terrorists. Luckily there are passwords at the end of each campaign, and always check out the menus for info on your fuel and ammo stats, and only collect it when you really need it and you should be able to stop the Desert Madman and South American drug baron before he nukes Washington. Scott Antonio: EGO Ego is the Most focused copilot of the group. He doesn't have a life, doesn't want one. He's average with the gun and Hinch. Alwaus readu. Ego never sleeps. I think that is what you could competently say is a hit.

The missions are more detailed and better structured than in Desert Strike some of them actually require brain-work to complete. This is still one of the most playable and original shoot-'em-ups available on any format. A word of advice, though, use the keyboard, not a joystick.

"CVG REVIEW PC CD-ROM Adventure Gametek .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned Demons, cyberpunks and Dennis Hopper join together to form the most star -studded adventure yet. Interactive movie, anyone? Your efforts have failed, death is your only reward HELLRAISERS Death lurks around every corner: you never know when a demon's going to pop up and rip your head off. t wasn't long ago that software companies used the vocal talents of their receptionists, marketing assistants and programmers to make their \"talkie' adventures, but nowadays the likes of Mark Hamill, Tim Curry and Dennis Hopper are queuing up to star in games. It's not even as if these are has beens, either: Hopper, the star of Hell, is a main player in Hollywood with Speed last year and Waterworld this year. Could it be that Hollywood is taking games seriously at last? Perhaps. Hell is a huge, cyberpunk adventure. The storyline is complex, but basically America is being run by a tyrant (Grace Jones) who has outlawed smoking, drinking, gambling, free speech and computer technology. She has cut a deal with the demons of Hell so that any law breakers will be damned forever. The heroes, Gideon and Rachel, are government agents, but they find out that they've been betrayed. Someone wants them dead, and they must find out who and why before they are dragged down to Hell forever. This means dealing with outlaw gangs, corrupt government officials and even the demons themselves, including Hopper's Mr Beautiful. It's difficult to know where to start with this large, non-linear game, but the idea is to travel around, talk to people to find out information, solve puzzles, carry out errands and recruit people to your cause. Much like any other adventure, really, except that this is a very tough game and the complexities of the plot are often baffling. Still, this is an impressive title which is both slick and attractive, so it should please experienced gamers who are looking for a challenge. A Gideon and Rachel have to deal with many unsavoury types as they try to find out who wants them dead. This is Mr Beautiful, down right demon, trouble maker and professional Dennis Hopper lookey-likey. In fact, he even sounds like Dennis Hopper. Hmm, now I wonder why that is? VERDICT PC CD-ROM There's no doubt Hell is a good-looking game the locations are atmospheric and although the animation is jerky, the characters look smart. But there are two problems with the game: firstly, the music (and I use 'music' in the loosest possible sense) is tuneless and annoying, and secondly, the puzzles are obscure, making the game baffling to play. It's completely non-linear, so you're never sure what you should be doing next, which can be daunting. Even so, this is a polished, glitzy game which is rewarding once you've got in to the game. CAL JONES Combat happens automatically, but to win you usually have to get hold of a particular object or solve a puzzle beforehand. Otherwise you're toast. This is Cynna Stone, hologram and demolition expert. Why is she a hologram? Because she blew herself up. So she's not that much of an expert, then, is she? And where's the 'H' on her head? Some characters are more co-operative than others, but most want you to run an errand, solve a puzzle or kill someone before they tell you anything.

"CVG REVIEW ARCADE Arcade Beat-'em-up 40p/play Out Now No other versions available Saturn and PlayStation versions What's the world coming to? A Capcom arcade beat-'em-up that isn't Street Fighter? Surely not.. he designers of Children of the Atom have obviously done their X-research quite thoroughly since the coin-op features a host of familiar, and not-so familiar, characters from X-comics old and new. They needn't have bothered, of course, because let's face it everyone's going to pick Wolverine. He's everyone's favourite short, hairy, Canadian psychopath and just about the most popular comic book character in Christendom. And who wants to control boring old fuddy-duddy Cyclops when you can wade in with a four-foot-nowt pointy nutcase? Well, once you see the stature of some of the other characters you may well change your mind. Eschewing the usual proportionism of one-on-one beat-'em-ups, Children of the Atom pits incredibly mis-matched looking opponents against one another. Witness, for example, the Sentinel which is almost the full height of the screen, compared to wickle Wolvie standing at about an inch tall. Combatitively all the protagonists are pretty evenly matched thanks to the heavyweight employment of combo-friendly special moves. These are accompanied by suitably super-powered speech and visual effects which help distance the game from the hordes of other Street Fighter clones. Although if anyone was going to make a Street Fighter clone, Capcom is the last team you could really blame for it. GET DOWN ON THAT KILLING FLOOR Super heroes are well known for their mega-destruc, tive battles, which usually end up with the local scenery taking more of a pasting than any of the combatants involved. Capcom is well aware of this, and has taken steps to include such un-public spirited behaviour in the game. The more powerful the attacks launched during the rounds, the more structural dam, age the floor incurs. After sufficient trauma the entire thing gives way, dropping the characters into a lower section of the environment. This can happen a number of times before the combat reaches rock bottom.

"REVIEW CVG POWER X-TREME! Many beat-'em-ups currently on the scene reward the use of combos, and X-Men is no different. Each character has, along with their energy bar, an X-Power bar. This fills up as you score more damage, and once it's full you're able to unleash your mega-powerful XAbility, which is commonly good for up to 20 succes sive hits. The joystick commands for these attacks are predictably tricky, but it's well worth taking the time to learn them. It's also well worth learning how to counter (by avoiding or blocking) each of these. The huge size of the Sentinel makes it very difficult to co-ordinate. A Children of the Atom features a cheat which lets you play as Akuma Long! Sadly, we couldn't print any pictures 'cos there wasn't any film in the camera when we found him. Boo hoo. SECOND OPINION VERDICT A What do you call a sick superhero? An Ecchs-man! Ha ha. A The speech for Wolverine is provided by the same actor who plays him in the ace cartoon, trivia fans. Now why on Earth hasn't anyone bothered doing something like this before? I'd much rather play this than one of those crappy sideways scrolling things they usually produce with Marvel characters.

It certainly bodes well for any coin-op freak who fancies playing something that isn't Killer Instinct and as an alternative you won't find anything better in the arcades at the moment. MARK PATTERSON ARCADE With Capcom being the grandaddy of the beat-'emup scene you'd expect something pretty decent from its team, especially considering the potential of the X-Men licence. The resulting game exceeds all expectations. Indeed, if Capcom dropped the Marvel tag and called it Street Fighter 3 it's unlikely anyone would've been disappointed. The sheer scale of the action is exhilarating in itself, not to mention the fantastic presentation and superb playability. Roll on the home conversions, that's what I say.

III ould you send your children to a school where the headmaster is called Professor X? | mean, Mr X is suspicious enough and Dr X implies underworld connections, but Professor X sounds like an evil Nazi scientist plotting to take over the world before destroying it. And he doesn't even run proper classes, his star pupils spend their days roaming the streets tearing up downtown neighbourhoods during fights with rival gangs. And he's bald, as if that wasn't enough. But let's not be cruel, he is a goodie after all. And of course, with sinister slapheads contributing to the delinquency of minors as the heroes, you wouldn't be far wrong to believe that the real villains are beyond our mere mortal judicial system. In this latest platformer the X-Men (or an incarnation of their line-up) are pitted against just about every major mutant villain that ever appeared in the comics. You're given the choice of six characters before each level and after each lost life, with each having their own strengths, weaknesses and special abilities. Unlike with many games of this M kind, it actually does make a big difference which mutant you use, with different routes for characters We who can climb or teleport or who can't do anything. Sounds beezer, but is it? Now read on, true believers. A Cyclops exhibits his amazing optic blast. What a surprise, Wolverine's in the game. Hmmm. Beast's power is a bit useless he just pounds the floor in an imitation of frustration. Nightcrawler is the best all-round character, and also has the best climbing abilities.

This is what the inside of a sinister Sentinel looks like. How educational. ISSUE 139: 72% SECOND OPINION VERDICT Sega has broken a couple of boundaries, here. Firstly it has actually managed to produce a decent X-Men licence, and secondly it's also gone and brought out an original platform game something Sega hasn't managed to do for quite some time. The number of characters adds a lot of lasting appeal and the variety inherent throughout the game stops it from ever becoming boring. In fact, it's a bit scary. GARY LORD Wolverine is rock hard. He's my hero. NOW WITH ADDED INTEREST Lack of originality is one complaint all too often levied at platform games. But not X-Men 2, oh no. Every level in the game features a new twist, sometimes even devices new to the genre. For example, you're dumped into the first level with a random character without knowing what's going on, after which you're asked to infiltrate a security complex, climb inside the robot workings of a giant Sentinel to destroy it, then find your way back out of the exploding building, without so much as a little arrow to guide you. Once you've managed this, your mission briefing for the next section is interrupted after about 15 seconds (SO you have to read fast) before you're cast off into space and... well, you get the idea. MEGA DRIVE While the X-Men have always had the potential for a great licence, so far none has appeared. Until now that is. The characters are, at last, sufficiently different to make an impact on the game which, at last, has been designed with the X-Men in mind and not Sonic or Johnny Flashback. The game kicks off at a cracking pace and gets more furious as you progress, moving at a fair lick and constantly throwing in new enemies and hazards. In short, this is one of the best action plat. formers Sega has released in absolutely ages. RAD AUTOMATIC The emergency lighting makes it difficult to find your way out of this bit.

"CVG REVIEW 3DO Shoot-'em-up Prolific .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned Destruction on a scale only a hyperactive three-year-old could match in the latest shoot-'em-up frenzy on 3DO... hey say the best things in life are free. Rubbish. The best thing in life is a big, red, throbbing Ferrari F40 (and Pamela Anderson sat in the passenger seat wouldn't go amiss either). Still I'm more inclined to believe that other old saying, that the best ideas are usually the simplest. Why I'm inclined to believe this particularly at the moment is because I've been fortunate enough to whittle away hours indulging in the latest 3D0 blast, Return Fire. It's a game so simple it's likely to turn into plankton and get David Attenborough to make a major nature series about it. Destroy, destroy and destroy is the aim in Return Fire. Buildings, enemy installations, soldiers, trees, everything can be blasted to itty bitty little pieces as the player searches for the enemy's flag, tucked securely away inside one of their buildings. Four vehicles are on offer; a manoeuvrable helicopter, a heavily armed support vehicle, a tough tank and a speedy jeep. Take out the bad guys with the heavy weapons and then send in the jeep to pick up the flag. A brilliant twoplayer mode is also included where the aim is the same but it's more likely to end up turning into an almighty ruck, rather than any sort of strategy fest. * return fire A Escape with the enemy's flag by using the speedy jeep. ALL HAIL! Rather tastefully. Return Fire celebrates each great victory by running a few reels of old footage showing a dictator-type (that's you, that is) basking in the glory of success while the populace has a good old knees up.

"REVIEW CVG VEHICLE DUTY Return Fire features three ground-based vehicles and a helicopter, each of which is important to the success of a mission. Water isn't a problem if you stick to the lightly shad. ed parts. Stray deeper and your vehicles sink. For the helicopter there's the menace of the submarine which patrols the deeper water. The Jeep: super fast. Use to pick up an enemy flag. Don't hang around, it it is weakly armoured and has little in the way of weapons. Each level of the game offers a number of progres. sively difficult sub-levels to fight through. Only one has to be completed before you can progress to the next main level though. The standard view is above and behind, but it zooms in if a vehicle is not moving. The Tank:: the standard battle weapon. A decent blend between speed, amour and weapons the tank is a great all rounder. ALTERNATIVE SNES Cannon Fodder Virgin/.99 Lots of bullets, death and destruction (not to mention humour), but a little more thought is required in Sensi's superlative blaster. Oneplayer only, though. ISSUE 158: 90% Each vehicle has its own classical music theme tune. And for the helicopter it's Ride of the Valkyries. SECOND OPINION VERDICT Return Fire is vaguely reminiscent of games such as Cannon Fodder or the crinkly Herzog Zwei on the Mega Drive in that it mixes strategy and action in pretty much equal measures. If you just wade in blasting you're certain to come a cropper, and if you spend too much time planning things out you can expect similar results. The controls are perfectly pitched and the capacity for cruelty within the game does inspire some evil behaviour. Basically, this is completely ace. RAD AUTOMATIC APC: an armoure d personnel carrier. Super armour, loads of powerful weapons but very slow. Keep away from water. 3DO While I write this piece it's Valentine's Day, which is apt as I love Return Fire. Gameplay's similar to the old Amiga version but the audiovisuals have been beefed up. Now there's a neat 3D engine which pans the graphics out when you're driving at speed and zooms in when the action is slow. Special mention has to go the music and sound, I don't think I've ever heard better. There's not that much variety, but the two player mode and simple, but highly charged, action is exhilarating and a worthy purchase for blasting-starved 3DO heads. RIK SKEWS A split-screen two-player is available. A You can splat individual men in your tank or APC. Carry less ammo and stock up on fuel. Copter: can cross terrain quickly and effortlessly but is slow to turn. Useful for taking out enemy aircraft. Watch out for AAA guns tough.

BADER 9 2 017 If the word 'strategy' sends you to sleep, worry not because the words 'Marines' and 'Metal' will wake you out of snoresville pronto. Metal marines are great for attacking, but are a good defence alternative to gun pods. Commander Garland is one of the easier opponents. VERDICT AI'm making short work of Commander Joan Rile-her base (top right) is getting trashed by one of my marines. Missiles are your basic attack weapon, but also reveal enemy installations. can't say I'm a big fan of hard core war games let's face it, any game where you spend a weekend reading the manual is more like hard work than fun. Metal Marines, though, is a breath of fresh air. Yes, it's a strategy game and yes, it's about war, but don't let that put you off. Think Battleships (that old pen and paper game you used to play in the car on the way to your Aunt Florrie's) and you're half way there. It's a bit more complex, but you can pick it up and play it without touching a manual and it'll keep you going into the wee small hours. You start with an island, a base (or three, later on in the game) and some weapons, namely missiles and metal marines (big, transformer-type robots which do lots of damage). Unluckily for you, so does the enemy. This game runs under Windows, so your island appears in one window and the enemy's appears in the other. The idea, put simply, is to blow up his bases before he destroys yours. You have a small amount of cash which you can use to buy more weapons and defences such as gun pods (for dealing with enemy marines) and interceptor missiles (to, er, intercept enemy missiles). To begin with, the enemy island appears blank, but as you send your missiles and marines over there with a simple click of the mouse, his installations become visible. The best strategy is to take them out with your missiles, before polishing off his bases with your marines, but since he's trying to do the same to you, you can't forget about defence. The computer opponents are tough enough, but You can defend your for added challenge you can bases with camouflage. also play against a friend over Enemy marines will ignore camouflaged bases. Only a modem or serial link. missiles can destroy the camouflaging PC WINDOWS This game is very addictive. Although it sounds simple and isn't anything special to look at, it's one of those games that gets you hooked like nobody's business. The different computer opponents provide a real challenge, and occasionally you'll get stuck on one level which is frustrating. But even if you do manage to beat the computer, you can still play against your friends so the game has true longterm appeal. It's well presented, and comes on only two floppies. Never mind multimedia, Marines has real gameplay. Get it now. CAL JONES The first level is easy — you start with lots of defensive weapons and the enemy has hardly anything! Gun pods protect against attacks, but they aren't much use against upgraded marines. GRAPHICS 79 SOUND 80 PLAYABILITY 94 VALUE 92 OVERALL Radars are pricey but improve your missiles' accuracy.

"REVIEW CVG CD32 Platform Ice .99 Out Now A500/600 versions available No other versions planned Imagine the world's a nice, fluffy place, where the days of huge film licences spawning pappy platform games has been banished forever. And then again... The art of ducking is enough to see the enemy soldiers off in the platform stages. Thun A In the film, Tetsuo morphs into a planet-sized demigod, in the game, he's this turd-like thing. The car is the best bit about Akira; it is faithful to its film counterpart. Unlike everything else. t's nice to think that however bad a game gets, there's always an element, like the graphics for example, which can command a degree of respect. ICE's Akira deserves a small amount of credit too, only because it attempts to mix a number of game styles together to make one good one. Sadly, though, it fails in every way. Let's imagine you've seen the film. Great, isn't it? Right, you'll be familiar with the bike-chasing scenes where Kaneda goes bonkers on the back of a motorcycle. In the game, this becomes a left-to-right scrolling devastated' road, with big red cones to collect for points, fuel to pick up, and policemen and huge holes in the road to avoid. A bit Fisher-Price, but pleasant. There's also a scene where Tetsuo goes bonkers in a high-security mental institution. This translates to a crappy. pre-Harlequin (hell, pre-Manic Miner) platform section, with the naffest, most washed-out graphics ever. And the worst gameplay. And finally, there's a bit where Kaneda goes bonkers on a flying bike, trying to save his great mate Tet. However, in the game, this follows a theme similar to the ancient arcade game Scramble; slow, tedious, with ridiculous and badly designed levels. The other levels', and I use the term loosely, are those three themes repeated over. Even the attempt to throw in scrappy bits of badly digitised film footage, presumably as a cover-up measure, hasn't worked. No, ANIMATIONS no, no, ICE. 1, 2 & 3 VERDICT akira Scramble returns, in the shape of the appalling Flying Bike levels. Dull, tedious and stupidly difficult. These images, digitised directly from the film, show up between levels and, for eight seconds, at the start of the game. However, where ICE fell down was in apparently passing the images through a 'make great images appear awful' filter. Or so it seems, anyway. CD32 It's difficult to imagine how poor Akira is without seeing it first. Incredibly, the team responsible has turned each facet of the visually stunning film into a shoddy mish-mash of poorly thought out ideas. The film's high-speed, high-contrast images become pallid, washed-out pastel-coloured graphics; Mr Yamashiro's unusual and striking soundtrack translates to a stock piece of Amiga-generated music, completely lacking in atmosphere. And the gameplay; well, it's so poor it's laughable. I warn you now, stay away. ANDY NUTTALL This pseudo-perspective is a nice idea, but is pretty useless when faced with flat obstacles like this. The 'devastated' road of the first level is a cunning labyrinth of huge holes. GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY VALUE ALTERNATIVE CD32 Any game... EVER! No, really. Oh, all right then: if speed's your thing, then you might like to try Acid's superb Roadkill. Or, perhaps Psygnosis' Flink, for a halfway-decent platformer. But personally I'd consider cutting off my own legs as an 'alternative' to playing this drivel.

Blinkin' Charlies it's those prehistoric namesakes the BC Racers. bc racers A Everyone's going for first place so use your club. peed is not one of the words that springs to mind when you're racing round the tracks in BC Racers. But that's not really the effect Core's after in its latest foray into PCdom. This is not really your Ridge and Virtua Racers, but more your cutesy, fun, bash-your-fellow-racer-overthe-bonce-with-a-club sort of shenanigans. Much the sort of gameplay you'd find in Mario Kart and Street Racer from Nintendo and UbiSoft respectively. Core hasn't gone out too far our of its way to change this from the Mega-CD original, although it is noticeably faster and smoother. Race round eight different tracks, and with some particularly lush backgrounds and well-scaled sprites it looks a treat. But apart from that it has the same difficulty settings and the standard viewpoints right behind the racer, slightly further behind, and further and higher behind. It does, however, support the three PC control systems of joystick, mouse and keyboard so you don't have to rush out and by a gamepad. Of these the keyboard work's best as the racers are incredibly responsive which is exactly what they should be. As for mouse-control, forget about it, it's just too darn difficult 'cos the game is nice and fast later on. A The bridges are difficult to navigate over. VERDICT A There's no slow down in the two player mode. A Now all I've got to do is catch up with the bleeder (or dino) who's first. PC CD-ROM The PC version of BC Racers is a lot better than the Mega-CD version, the backdrops look really excellent, the bikes handle well, and the two-player mode is pretty good. The problem is that the game doesn't have that 'play me again' element. The characters have a samey feel about them, and the drone oppenents seem to fade out of existence. The prehistoric theme is also a bit lame after we've had two summers of Jurassics and Flintstones.

"REVIEW CVG 25VES The MEGA DRIVE Platform Ocean .99 Out Now SNES version also available Game Boy version planned I can sing a rainbow sing a rainbow toooo... Just a shame It's the last thing I'm ever going to sing really, since I'm in the process of falling to my death. Aaaaarghh! I don't know why Jelly Boy is looking so miserable turning into a pop bottle was really an inspired idea since his fizz spurted out and wasted all the approaching enemy. oco \"800 cod 8500 Bounce, bounce and bounce again lemons and oranges extend your time limit DEG DOO VERDICT Ever heard of Malteser Girl? Dolly Mixture Man or Twist Cough Candy Woman? No, neither have I but here's a boy you will have... MEGA DRIVE I first saw Jelly Boy in development at Probe HQ more than three years ago. It's a shame it wasn't released then because it would have been revolutionary. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game, but now a million and one other platform games have hit the Mega Drive, it's lost the edge a bit. Graphically and animation-wise it's a winner. It's also a big, varied and very tough game, with lots of secondary aims apart from the obvious of getting to the end of each level. All in all a winner wich wouldn't go amiss in anyone's collection. LUCY HICKMAN To complete the game properly, Jelly Boy has to collect a piece of jigsaw from every level which are usually concealed in the most obscure and inaccessigreat, big steaming lump of jelly may seem a rather bizarre gaming hero especially one whose party trick is producing a mighty fist from his nether regions to knock anyone in range for six but it certainly works for this game. Jelly Boy's a platform jaunt which has our wobbly hero bounding around six massive and varied worlds all of which contain several different levels in all his naked glory. The main aim of the game is unsurprisingly to reach the end of each level without being blitzed by the army of baddies which accost you on the way, and without exceeding the tough time limit. To complete the game properly though, you have to collect a piece of jigsaw from each level which is usually secreted in the most inaccessible places. You're faced with masses of obstacles and puzzling situations which can only be overcome by finding one of the special icons and transforming yourself into another shape. For example, if you're faced with a brick wall, turn into a battering ram and bash your way through: if the impending fall looks too risky, change into a brolly so you can float down, or if you need a bit of extra lift, mould your shape into a pogo stick. Just remember: bash all comers, watch out for the bonus rooms and gather as much fruit as you can for extra lives, extended time or invisibility. GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 86 PLAYABILITY 88 VALUE 89 ALTERNATIVE SNES Donkey Kong Nintendo/.99 If you had to buy a SNES platform game last year then this is the game you probably bought. Stunning graphics and it's a huge game to boot. OVERALL A The battering rams are great, putting pay to any impudent wall which tries to stop you in your tracks.

This is the one EMPTU that started in the arcades of yesteryear... 1991. And popular it was. Yyou could be very easily forgiven for thinking that this was Star Wars, since you have to destroy Planet Red Eye, which doesn't look dissimilar to the MECHANIZO PLANE I \"RED EYE\" Deathstar. At certain points Starblade is even more derivative when Tie Fighter-type craft whizz all over the screen trying to fry your ass. Starblade is not only reminiscent of Star Wars per se, but many of those old-fashioned early-3)* eighties straight-forward shoot-'em-ups where firing blinding is almost as good as trying to apply tactics to the proceedings.. You're supposed to be aided and abetted by some bloke blahring on in your shell-like, telling you things like 'You kill the ones on the port and I'll take the ones on the starboard', (port means left by the way).

But big doesn't usually mean better, for example you don't want a great hefty great Walkman in your pocket, do you, or a hifi that takes up half your bedroom. So case in point that big doesn't necessarily mean better. In the case of Starblade though, it does because in the arcades when you had six of you playing on six different screens it was better. No really, it was. DISTANCE OSED 1820A 3DO 3D programmers 1 assume have a 3D0 programming kit dispensed by Trip hawkins Inc, as each 3D0 game seems to have the same standard explosion. They're not so impressive this around though. The game doesn't have the wow factor it had in the arcades where a whole gang of you took control of a whole squadron of Geo Swords. As such the gameplay becomes tiresome without the notoriety of a licence like Star Wars and the visuals aren't anything new these days. This game just doesn't cut it I'm afraid.

"CVG REVIEW 3DO Shoot-'em-up Panasonic .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned S ... ? It's a 3DO, right? So you'd expect 3D that'd make you go \"oh!'. Yeah, right... 01F ow remember kids, never, ever mess with nasty giant robots with long names. Even if they claim to have a stash of exceedingly cute puppies stored at Uncle Alfie's. No, they are most likely to shoot you, then stamp on your still-warm corpse. Or worse still, force you to buy a game about them. It never ceases to amaze us when we try to think what was going through the programmers' heads when they complete a thing like this. Surely they can't be pleased with it? If we did that then we'd be doing the publishing equivalent of wiping our backsides on a bit of paper and then charging a fiver for it. Whatever the case is, this 3D blaster is dead poor. It's not only the appalling 3D engine which causes the trouble, but the horrendous gameplay. All you're asked to do is wander around trying to find the right lift to take you to the next floor. And as each floor is populated by around half a dozen robots, you're on your own most of the time. This certainly isn't how we expected this game to turn out. There, got through the whole thing without mentioning Doom once. Iron angel of the apocalypse VERDICT Aiee! Davros! We must destroy, destroy. 3DO I didn't see the beta version of this and only had Rad's preview to go on, and from that I thought it sounded quite good. Since then I have experienced the bitter taste of disappointment while Rad has experienced the bloody taste of my fist. 'This', to quote Beavis, 'sucks'. It's slow, unimaginative, unplayable and, in a nutshell, a bag of crappy old pants. If you're after a 3D exploro-blast, go for SSI's Slayer, it's not fantastic but a ringworm hamburger is preferable to a couple of hours sat in front of a 3D0 playing this.

"REVIEW CVG GAME GEAR Driving Sega .99 Out April VERDICT No other versions available No other versions planned sonic drift 2 GAME GEAR The difference between this and the first Sonic Drift is like the difference between a pint of Guiness and one of diarrhoea although that does usually depend on what pub you're in. Whatever way you look at this, Sega will be hard-pressed to produce a better handheld game all year. All the right things are in here and with the two-player link up feature, you couldn't ask for more (apart from free Guiness vouchers). MARK PATTERSON boo 2 Oh no, an ice level. Thank God there isn't a mine cart one. A Use your turbo Sonic, that'll scupper Knuckles. They scrapped the original, so is it second time lucky for Sonic and pals? ou wouldn't have seen the first Sonic Drift in this country because even Sega realised it was just too darn crap to be worth releasing. And a good thing too, if they had chances are nobody would believe us when we said that this is actually a very good game. It may sound strange but Sonic Drift 2, despite being on a handheld, is probably the closest thing to Mario Kart on any system. This is mainly down to the fast scrolling and fluid gameplay which is normally missing from this kind of game. On top of this are all the features you'd expect multiple courses, different cup competitions, plenty of characters to choose from and enough bonuses and special features to distract you from the real business of racing. If you pick a fast character they will slide all over the place while the fat slow ones stick to the road like a run-over rabbit. Each character has its own special move, from Sonic's turbo boost to Robotnik's unsporting mine-laying activities. Using one costs two rings, although plenty of extra ones are scattered around the track waiting to be collected. Dirty tricks, eh? Dontcha just love 'em?

"CVG THE PC GAMES MACHINE So you want a new games machine? Before the next generation of consoles arrive from the Land of the Rising Sun, why not consider the other option: a PC. Not only can you play some of the best new games, but a whole host of other options are at your finger tips... sa games machine the PC has really come into its own in the past six months. Sure, games like FIFA on 3D0 or Ridge Racer on the PlayStation look impressive but the problem with any console is that they tend to stick to what they're good at. That's fine if all you want is action games. But if your tastes vary, and you want to keep up with the latest software, a PC is definitely the smart move because it has the capability to adapt to new styles of game and changes in technology. Just look at the ground breaking stuff that's coming out on the PC first (now that games developers are really starting to make use of the power and flexibility of the PC) like Wing Commander 3 and Doom, or the the forthcoming 11th Hour and Phantasmagoria shockers. The price of PC games is far lower and the sheer number of releases every month is vast. How much you want to spend on a PC depends on how far you want to go. You can get up and running for less than ,000 with no trouble, and you can keep adding flash new extras and upping the power of the system for as long as you've got the dosh. For the sake of argument, let's imagine we've just one the lottery. What would you need to put together the ultimate gamesplaying PC if money was no object? Well, you're going to start with a mother of a basic system... Powerwise, it's got to be driven by the latest 64-bit, 100MHz, Pentium chip. Some PC games are already \"Pentium only' or 'Pentium optimised', like US Navy Fighters and Wing Commander 3.

"THE PC GAMES MACHINE CVG Joysticks likes of Carrera or Compaq will set you back about ,300. Ouch! You'll probably want to make some tweaks even then: upping the RAM to 32Mb will really kick games into life, and a big hard disk is always an essential (let's say the 720Mb Quantum drive at ). And a 64-bit video card like the Diamond Stealth 64 () will make things fly faster than a speeding bullet. Last, but by no means least, you'll need a decent monitor. Let's skip the standard SVGA, 14-inch PC job: if you want the ultimate in visuals for your games then it has to be a huge, 21-inch Sony monitor (,599). So for around ,000 we've got the basics just about right, now for the essentials check out the different boxes on what peripherals you're gonna need... WHERE DO YOU STOP? The best thing about a PC is that you can just keep on adding whatever takes your fancy provided your wallet will stand the wear and tear. You could add a modem like the ultra-fast Hayes 28.8 Accura () so you can indulge in a bit of Net surfing through cyberspace or dive into multiplayer games over the phone lines. Then there are MPEG cards such as the first rate Ace Coin Movie Master 24 () for playing full motion video games and movies on your PC (like a Digital Video card for CD-i, for example). The list of possible addons and desirable gadgets for the PC is endless. How about a TV card like Haupennage's WinTV system (). Let's get really pointless and throw in the Although there is plenty of straightforward arcade stuff, the biggest PC games are often very complicated (particularly the flight sims) and they need something sophisticated to control the action. There are a mass of different methods, from simple digital sticks through to cordless mice, gamepads (essential for beat-'em-ups there's no way you'll ever hit the special moves using a PC keyboard), footpedals, flight yokes and multibutton analogue joysticks like Gravis bizarre but extremely effective Phoenix or the Thrustmaster F16 FLCS. The Thrustmaster is a monster of a flight sim joystick with buttons for everything, and there's always the option of adding the Thrustmaster Weapons Control System, too. With those two on tap, you've no excuse for getting shot down ever again. Zye Radio FX () (a 16-band AM/FM programmable radio for your PC), or a graphic equalizer like the Platinum Pro from BitPower (). Perhaps a virtual reality headset like the Forte VFX1 () or the CyberMax () since a number of PC games like Flight Unlimited or Superkarts already have built-in VR modes. You can't be without a CD-ROM if you expect to play the best PC games, and the drives just keep getting faster. This is where the PC has a huge advantage over fixed CD systems like 3DO or the Saturn PC drives are not only two steps ahead of the competition in terms of performance, they're also cheaper. When a new drive becomes available CD-ROM Drive you just fork out the dosh and drop it into your PC. Sound cards and speakers The state-ofthe-art in CD-ROM drives is Plextor's new six-speed CD-ROM drive, new out this month. Quite simply, it's the fastest off the blocks, and it's compatible with Video CD. The ingredients for an \"ultimate games PC ...

If you want to go the whole hog, there are cards out there that will give you directional 3D sound, Q Sound, Dolby ProLogic, MIDI compatibility, Chorus and Reverb, you name it, all at the same quality as an audio CD or DAT player. For our hypothetical 'ultimate games PC' the obvious choice would be the Creative Labs AWE32 () As for speakers, well, to be honest most dedicated PC speakers are not worth the plastic they're made out of and you're far better jacking the whole thing through your hi-fi system. But if you are after decent, standalone speakers then the Aiwa TS-D20s () make an impressive racket.

"THE PC GAMES MACHINE CVG How much were you thinking of spending Si THE PC CD-ROM DRIVE SOUND CARD JOYSTICK SPEAKERS Under  OK, so cash is tight. Somehow you've managed to beg, borrow or steal about 800 big ones. Can you get a decent system for that? Yes. Just make sure you put the bulk of your money into a quality, expandable basic machine. You can add the luxuries later. Mint DX2/66  No frills PCs don't come much cheaper than this. It does the job in the processor department, but you will need to do something about the weedy RAM and hard disk capabilities because they're enough for todays games. Bluepoint ICD-310  Cheap, cheerful and as capable as any other double speed drive. It's dead easy to set up, so why pay more? Many double-speed drives are manufactured with the same components so have similar data transfer rates. Sound Blaster Pro  OK, so it's only 8-bit FM, but it's the only one you can be sure will work with every game. More than adequate. Sampled speech does get fuzzed though, so if you can afford the next one up, go for it. Quickshot Super Warrior .99 Mostly a flight sim stick, but the Warrior can double up as a good general purpose joystick if you have to. It's also very reliable, which is something rare in this price range. Cheap 'n' nasty .99 Any pair of cheap speakers from Tandy will do to start with. Or better still, hook the whole thing up through your hi-fi. Otherwise you'll probably be better off with a pair of decent headphones. Under ,000 TMJN DX2/66  The MJN is a well made PC inside and out, and is a nippy games performer thanks to an excellent basic specification, with a good hard disk and enough RAM to get you started. Bluepoint ICD-310  As mentioned before, cheap, cheerful easy to use, and as capable as any other double speed drive. If you've got an extra , though, go for the NEC quad-speed. Sound Blaster 16  Moving up to 16bit sound is a big plus, although you're still stuck with FM sound processing. Does the business, though. The reproduction is far superior its 8bit cousin. Gravis Analogue Pro  Looks rude. Very rude. I'm not going to describe it just go and look at one in the shop some time. Anyway... the Gravis is the best all-round PC joystick by a mile. This is commonly called the entry level' price for a PC. In other words, for near ,000 you should get a decent brand name PC with a good specification, and expect it to last more than a few weeks without dying on you.

Not the ZiFis, though. Under $1.400 Escom P60 ,049 A hugely powerful, well designed Pentium PC with a monster spec for the money (8Mb RAM, PCI graphics, 500Mb hard disk and so on). Gets you straight into the real power play. NEC CDR271 quad speed  Quad speed performance is essential for really good video and decent CD gaming. The NEC CDR271 puts this sort of speed at the price of last years double speed drives. 'Nuff said. Sound FX 3000  16-bit Wavetable cards like this are the dog's wotsits when it comes to top quality, bet ter-than-your-hifi sound. The Sound FX is ultracompatible and really lets you crank it. It's a three way decision: buy a multimedia PC all in, and get lots of software too; go for a top-ofthe-range 486 and spend some more on adding the extras; or find yourself a cheaper, super fast Pentium PC (you'll spend less on the extras) but it's probably the best option. | Wingman Extreme  Koenix Speedking  Logitech's Wingman Extreme can't be beaten if you're a serious sim nut. It's more responsive and has more features than other sticks at twice the price. Pick up a SpeedKing for arcade games and platform action while you're at it.

"REVIEWS CVG supershorts A mixed bag of little reviews, this month. Some good, some bad, some who write home to their mums and some who wear Argyle socks. So read about them. C snes amiga DC SUPERSKI PRO KA-50 HOKUM OC NATIONAL LAMPOON'S BLIND DATE CLAY FIGHTER 2 DEATH MASK Quelle surprise another month, another PC flight sim. Hasn't everyone already got about six of these? Well, if you haven't you might like to look at this. It's lacking in atmosphere, but very strong on realism. A bit of a curate's egg, but worth investigating. As if there weren't enough one-on-one beat'em-ups for the SNES, along comes another manky novelty one. No no, no, you cretins, no more. People want real playability and depth, not unfunny Claymation characters. There's nothing to redeem this game at all. A sporadically amusing chat-up package which doesn't actually feature anything relating to an actual game. Use a variety of lines on a number of ladies and see how much success you have (you sad man). Fun for 10 minutes, but way too expensive for what it is. Take Doom, lose threequarters of the screen, ditch the parallax, lose the artificial intelligence, screw up the controls and cut out half the scrolling animation presto! Death Mask! Not, without wishing to put too fine a point on it, a particularly good game. Slalom, ski jumping and snowboarding package which is a bit finickety to play. Not what you'd call bad, but there are much better ways of spending money. Like at a dry ski slope or something. Or perhaps some snowboarding lessons. We like snowboarding. .95 .99 .95 .99 .99 32x amiga snes I WONDER PROJECT J DC ALADDIN mega drive MOTOCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP I KINGPIN ROADRUNNER DESERT 22 92 32 A strange kettle of fish which casts you as a fairy trying to teach a wooden boy to be human. The controls are deceptively straightforward, but the game itself isn't. Brilliant puzzles and an incredible amount of depth make this a real winner. Oh dear. The 32x takes another great leap backwards with this release. You'd think they could have done better than this by now. Horrible clashing colours, awful sound and a complete lack of depth or real playability point to a waste of money. It's cheap, and it's a professional enough conversion of ten-pin bowling, but obviously this is only going to captivate fans of the reallife sport. Who don't live near a bowling alley. Probably the best computer version of the sport around, though. Following hot on the heels of The Lion King is another quality platform game for the PC. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, and the gameplay is totally spot on. Maybe a tinge too straightforward for 'older' players, but great fun nonetheless. Roadrunner coyote's after you. Roadrunner if he catches you you're through. And if you buy this game, you're through, too. It's another tedious platform title. Yaaaawn.

If you've got a lot of patience and a strange sense of logic this may appeal to you. A sort of reverse Tetris, in which your little drag. on spits coloured bubbles at the ceiling to clear other bubbles of the same colour. Great fun, especially in twoplayer mode, but chances are you'll already have a similar title in your collection. Like the console versions, Lion King on Amiga has too many competitors to really shine. The graphics are great, but they're not very original. If you're new to platformers, this is a good place to start, but veterans won't find anything new. This may look a bit on the average side, but it's actually a pretty playable and nicely challenging piece of software. Proper bike fans are most likely to get into it thanks to a good level of realism, but even two-wheel haters should get a kick out of Kawasaki A weird sort of Tetris derivative that uses snakes instead of blocks. Anyway, it takes longer to explain than it does to get into. Just have a go in the shop because it's absolutely ace.

"CVG CVG each Q &A HELP! \"I was walking along road t'other day, and some young turk kem up to us and asked us whether 'e should buy a PlaySation or a Saturn of wait for Ultra 64. Well I sent 'im oft wiv a flea in 'i's ear, telling 'im he can buy a Mars bar for all I care, 'cos I dinnee know nowt about nuffink, he'll have to write to CVG, and they'll tell ye.\" And we will, whatever your NEW MACHINES QUESTIONS gaming query, so if you've a poser along the lines of this page of hard and softDear Help 1. I'm very confused with all the new super consoles being released and don't have a clue ware quessies send 'em in to Help!, CVG, which one to buy. The consoles that I am trying to choose between are Nintendo's Ultra 64, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, Sega's Saturn or Sony's PlayStation. Could you please give me your opinion on each one and London EC1R 3AU. tell me which one you think will be the best? CVG: Best at what exactly? It's difficult to say at present as not all of them have been released (and no-one in the press has even seen so much as a mockup of the Ultra 64), so giving an opinion is pretty tough! At the moment the PlayStation is picking up most enthusiasm from both software companies and the public alike, so if you're a rich geezer with cash burning a hole in your pocket, that's the one to go for if you want a super console NOW. 2. Will the Ultra 64 be sold with a joystick or joypad? CVG: Knowing Nintendo, a joypad's much more likely. 3. Will the super consoles cost over ? CVG: Because they are classed as videos (though you'd have a job trying to tape EastEnders). super consoles are almost certain to be at least . unless the companies concerned are prepared to sell the hardware at a loss and make money on the software instead, like Nintendo and Sega do at present. This seems unlikely though, as the hardware is much more expensive to produce (and develop) in these super consoles compared to the 16-bit machines. 4. Why does the 3D0 cost ? It's only a 32-bit machine, while the Atari Jaguar is a 64-bit machine and only  CVG: The Jaguar doesn't have a 64-bit processor, it's just clever adding up on the part of Atari. By the same maths, the PlayStation would be about 75 bit! Coincidentally Sega is using a similar ploy in Japan where the Saturn is being advertised as a 64-bit machine. The 3D0 is true 32 bit, has a CD drive built-in and suffers from the same import tax problem that the other machines will face, 5. When will we see some Ultra 64 screen shots? CVG: You've seen Crusin' USA on Ultra 64 already and rest assured we'll bring you more pix as soon as we have them. 6. Is Toh Shin Den really any good? In issue 159 you said the gameplay is like Street Fighter which is rubbish. CVG: Street Fighter rubbish? We at CVG hope you're talking about the film and not the game otherwise we're going to come round your house and duff you in good and proper. Except we can't because not only did you forget to put your address down, you also neglected to include your name. Doh! And Toh Shin Den is the business (see last issue for the full monty review). so there. CD-I VS JAGUAR PHILIPS Dear Help 1. What would you buy, a CD-i or Jaguar? CVG: Neither! Just kidding, the Jaguar would win hands down. 2. Does the FMV for the CD-i 210 work on the CD-i 450? CVG: Yup. 3. Will the following games appear on the CD-i: Doom, Quarantine, Mortal Kombat, NASCAR, Another World, Alien Breed, Sim City 2000 or Theme Park? CVG: Doom, are you kidding? Quarantine no. Mortal Kombat no. Nascar no. Another World is a possibility as Philips is releasing Flashback. Allen Breed isn't likely though, and nether is Sipr City but Theme Park is a possibility 4 Does the CD-i play musiq CD's too? CVG: Yep, and competeptly too. 5 Is Burn:Cycle any good CVG: It's very good and is the best CD-Ptitle to date Richard Cartwright, Leicester. 104 "


"Q&A CVG SUPERSCART MORTAL TIL INFO Dear Help, Could you tell me if it's worth buying a SCART lead for my Atari Jaguar? Is there much much of an improvement in picture quali ty by using one? R McGovern, Essex CVG: SCART leads make a big, big difference towards Improving picture clarity, although if you're using a telly it depends on how decent it is. If you plan on sticking the SCART lead in a monitor then it's essential, and is like the difference between AM and FM Sound on the radio. And that goes for SCART leads for all machines, not just the Jag. MORE 3DO TEASERS Dear Help 1 Is it true that Mortal Kombat III will only be released on SNES? CVG: Nope, it will probably only be released on PlayStation and Ultra 64, and of course in the arcades. 2 When will the Mortal Kombat movie be released? CVG: Too soon, but the summer probably! 3 Is it true that Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition is out on the Mega Drive. If so how much is it? CVG: Certainly is and it's .99. Don't buy it though, because it's complete pap, just like the original game was on Mega Drive. 4 Is there going to be an Earthworm Jim 2 on Mega Drive? CVG: Yep, but how can Playmates possibly improve on it, that's what we can't wait to find out. 5 Have you got a cheat for either Super Smash TV or Spiderman on the Mega Drive? CVG: No, try the tips section! PC SPECS-TACLES Dear Help 1 Will there be a stunning driving sim on the 3DO? CVG: There already is. It's called The Need for Speed and scored a healthy 93% And for the more action orientated 3DO readers out there try Road Rash which scored an equally top. per 91%. 2 Who is responsible for CD films on the 3DO? When will the FMV unit be available? CVG: Er... the various film companies perhaps? About Easter, but that could change. 3 Are UK/US games compatible with a Jap 3DO? CVG: Many are but we've come across some that aren't, so try and play an imported title on a machine from the country you own before purchasing. 4 Does the 3D0 have a strong, stable future? CVG: It's too early to say, but if the high quality of recent software and the fact that many shops have sold out of their initial stocks suggest the answer's 'yes' at present. It's far from the worldwide success that Trip Hawkins had hoped for though and that was without any competition, so once the likes of PlayStation and Saturn muscle in on the market who knows. 5 Will the 3D0 become the most powerful console around with a Bulldog upgrade? CVG: Yes, on paper at least. But while power might create more realistic games it in no way guarantees better ones. 6 What's the difference between the Panasonic, Goldstar and Sanyo versions of the 3DO? CVG: At the moment it's gwly cosmetic, check out Goldstar's pad for instance. But differing hardware bundles from the different manufacturers pright appear in order to create competition and therefore forte prices down. Steve, Kuala Lumpat Malaysia Dear Help Despite buying your magazine for almost eight years I still need some help please! I now have quite a collection of consoles and one Amiga computer and I'm soon to come into some money and have decided to spend some on a multimedia PC. Thing is I'm at a loss when it comes to terms like DX, SX, 486, DX2 and 66MHZ etc. What I want to know is which would be the best machine to play games like Doom 2 and the Star Wars titles on, as well as use art, music packages, multimedia and encyclopaedias. Also how many soundcards do I actually need, and will I require an MPEG cartridge to play movies and FMV games on CD? Will all movie and music CDs work. with this set-up? Mark Hogg, Derby looking for a machine with these type of specs: 486DX2 66MHZ (the speed of the processor, 8Mb RAM (memory), SVGA video display and about 500Mb Of hard disk space. If you can, spend about  more and get a P60 TPentium) processor. These are becoming more popular and are likely to be required to run much of the new software released by the end of the year. Anyhow, turn to page 98 for are top-excellent guide to buying the perfect games PC for as little money as possible. Or try to win one instead. CVG: It's worth spending about ,500 on a PC because then the thing won't be out-of-date in about six months. Ideally you should be Dear Help. 1 I was thinking of getting Demolition Man on 3D0. Is it any good, because it looks wicked? CVG: Yes, it's quite good with plenty of variety but not an essential purchase by any means and hardly 'wicked'. 2 When will the 3DO MPEG Digital Video cart be released in the UK and how much will it be? CVG: Around Easter, about . 3 Is MK2 going to be released for the 3D0 and if so when? CVG: There are no plans as yet, but after the brilliance that was Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo we'd sure like to see what the 3DO could do with MK2. How 3DO TICKLERS about it Acclaim? 4 My dad thinks that the CD-i is better than the 3DO overall. Which do you think is the best for technology, games and value for money? CVG: The 3D0 wins on all accounts. Give your dad a good slap from us and get him to read the mag! 5 Will you be able to buy anything to upgrade your 3DO system to 64 bit? CVG: Yeh, it's known as the Bulldog or less snappily the M2 accelerator, and will be out at the tail end of this year. No prices confirmed as yet. 6 When will Doom or Doom 2 be released for the 3DO? CVG: In just a few months time you'll be able to play Doom in all its glory on 3D0. Whoopee! 7 Will Panasonic's 3DO be able to compete with Sony and Sega? CVG: Don't write the machine off because although the 3DO is not technically as capable as Sega's and Sony's new machines, remember that Panasonic has got formidable corporate backing as it's owned by Matsushita (one of the biggest companies in the world). The 3DO has support from one of the biggest leisure software companies in the world too, Electronic Arts. And remember the other 3D0 hardware developers like Goldstar will be contributing to the marketing spend too, which can only help the 3DO's cause. Lloyd Mutton, Warwickshire 10 105 "


"CVG COMPETITION SEGA GO \"BOARDING AND GIVE AWAY A MEGA DRIVE 32X' t's grim up North. Or so the saying goes, but one thing the CVG team found out last week is that it's bleedin' cold in the Midlands. The main reason why it was so cold, though, was because the CVG team were watching (and indeed taking part) the 32X SEGA UK PRO SNOWBOARDING TEAM. Hold on a minute, we know what you're thinking, 'there aren't any ski slopes round Birmingham'. And we here at CVG read the tabloids and know that when all the poshies go off poncing around on the ski slopes they are usually in France or Switzerland, not Val d' Brummie. That's where we were wrong, though, because in Tamworth just outside Brum, there's the Snowdome wet-ski slope where we tried our hand (or should we say feet) at this radical sport. And no doubt that's precisely why Sega's decided to sponsor the snowboarding team as they compete on the ISF World Tour.

Cheers to DB again and get back to your revision mate! MEGA DRIVE VIEWPOINT MEGA DRIVE SHINING FORCE 2 Let's face it, the levels in Viewpoint are pretty darn large. So we're here to tell you about the handy warp zones in each level which allow you to skip to the next one. Brilliant RPG action on the Mega Drive can be made even better via this secret debug mode. It allows you to tamper with all the usual parameters like extra lives and invisibility. To enter it simply enter U, D, L, R, L, RU, R, D. L, B and START. Enter this at the sort of speed required to get the Sonic 3 cheat to work, ie pretty darn fast. Do keep trying if you can't get it to work first time! Level 1: Play through until you see the stage where you see the enemy forms a circle. Kill all the red 'blobs' (the easiest way to do this is to use a bomb) and a warp will appear to whisk you to level two. Level 2: Mid-way through the stage there are two catlike things. Fly behind them to discover a warp to level three. Level 4: Again mid-way through, look for some hills and behind one of them will be a warp zone to level 5. SNES TURN AND BURN GAME GEAR MEGA DRIVE THE LION KING URBAN STRIKE Regular contributor Julian White is back after what seems like forever with all the level codes to EA'S Urban Strike. Seems to be turning into something of a Strike special this month doesn't it? Cheers Julian and away we go: Not the world's greatest shoot-'em-up it has to be said, though, it's a perfectly acceptable blaster none the less and here are some perfectly acceptable level codes to help whizz through the game. Thanks to John Speaks, who's living in Holland at the mo, for these 'uns. A groovy Lion King cheat is all yours thanks to much excellence from the man known as Dean Compton down in deepest Surrey (well Redhill anyway). To access the cheat wait for the Sega logo to rear its pretty head and press and hold button 2. When the logo disappears, rotate the pad clockwise until the Disney screen goes and you should hear another one of those \"ping noises that seem to populate cheat land, and which will let you know everything is working fine. Proceed to 'Start' and a level select should appear.

"TIPS CVG AMIGA MEGACD GAME GEAR DESERT STRIKE MARVIN'S MARVELLOUS ADVENTURE REBEL ASSAULT You want level codes for this version of the classic Mega Drive blaster too, eh? Well, you've come to the right place then, what with CVG being a multi format extravaganza and all that Ugh, can't say we're big fans of this very cute platformer from 21st Century, especially that horrible Euro stuff that passes for the music. Plenty of you seem to like it though, so here's the level codes to chomp on. SCORE 0007510 Campaign 2: CIWEJFD There's no denying that this is a playable little action romp, thanks mainly to its excellent use of the Star Wars characters and worlds. Other than on easy level it's 'well 'ard' as Robbie from EastEnders might say in that irritating way, so here's all the cheats for all the difficulty and indeed game levels to swing the pendulum of chance your way.

At the title screen press AA, BB, XX, YY and then A, B, X, and Y again, all on controller 1. If all goes well an Ewok (aah!) should cry out. Then, on any side-scrolling stage, press I and R on controller two. This will bring up the debug menu which lets you choose any character, weapons or stages in the game. Oh, and it also gives you unlimited thermal detonators as well. PC QUARANTINE It's always a risk getting into the back of a cab, especially if you've just drunk 20 pints and finished off an El Greeko Shish death kebab. Still that's nothing compared to the horrors on offer in Gametek's Quarantine. To sooth that nightmare ride here's a complete list of all the game's level codes. Screen scrolling thang Just press Y, Y, Y, Y to flip the Star Wars intro logo round and round. Not that exciting we admit but we know you lot like to know everything possible about games so we aim to please! Music Menu Hold DOWN and then A, B, Y, X and START on any sideways scrolling level to bring up the music menu. Seven continues If you want at least seven continues, and who doesn't, then on the title screen press A, B, A, Y, A and X. To see the end credits of the game it's A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B.

At any point in any game, simply press L, R and SELECT for a new diagonal viewpoint which somehow manages to make the game about 50 times harder to play than it was. Hmm. WE WANT PC YOUR TIPS RISE OF THE ROBOTS Ooh, ooh we've found a secret character! Going by the name of Kuroko you can get to him by doing the following. Simply win three matches in a row and on the second round in each match make sure be you finish off your opponent with a weapon breaker. Do so and in the fourth match Kuruko will appear. Beat him and you'll be treated with an ending with all sorts of weird goings on. By the way you can also select Kuruko on the character selection screen, but only in the two player mode. Select him by entering UP, R, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN and A. HARD Chapter If you've managed to complete upteen levels of a game and in the process acquired the level codes, or you've wangled some great cheats then we want you to tell us.

Anyway if you're one of the many people to have picked up a copy of the definitive PC version then here's a wee tip for you that will let you play as the Supervisor in training. Go to the options screen and press LEFT, LEFT, LEFT and RIGHT. The screen should turn blue and the supervisor's yours for the control ling. By the way his special moves are: DOWN, LEFT, UP and RIGHT (Insect) and DOWN. RIGHT, UP and LEFT (Terminator 2-style melt). CVG CheatMode, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. AXELAY Regular tips man John Speaks is back (there's obviously not a lot to do in Holland except gather tips, not that we're complaining mind) with this handy cheat to Konami's supremely classic blaster. To become invincible start the game as normal and press PAUSE. Press PAUSE again and press SELECT, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT Y, B, A, X and finally PAUSE again. "


"CVG COMPETITION star BIG EDS wars 5 The editors of Britain's top games magazines tell us what games have molested their fancy this month... compo Andy McVitie, Editor So what if neither the Ultra 64 or Nintendo Magazine System the Virtual Boy are going to be released over here until 1996 even though Japan and the USA are going to get them both this year. There are still plenty of ace titles like Jam TE, Superstar Soccer, Hagane and the forthcoming Starwing 2. So I'm not bitter at all, me. Much. Steve Merrett, Editor Panzer Dragoon has been wilting Mean Machines my oyster so to speak, as at last the Saturn gets a game to rival Virtua Fighter in the playability stakes. Aside from that, though, we've had a sneak look at Acclaim's Judge Dredd, and been practising our Cantona flying kicks on our office copy of the awful Victory Goal. Richard Leadbetter, Editor This month I've had the pleasure Sega Magazine of playing the quite fantastic Panzer Dragoon on Saturn. Import owners will probably be able to get their hands on it now, and I reckon it's going to be a top seller. Things are definitely looking up for Saturn Daytona should be here sometime in April and that looks great. OOOOOOOO Alan Dykes, Editor It's racing time again if you've CU Amiga got an Amiga, with Team 17's All Terrain Racing, Arcane's Turbo Trax and the delayed but bloody wonderful Super Skidmarks on the way during March and April. Our mailboxes (real and CIX) have also been jammed with 'in development' Doom-style 3D game engines. Hmmm... Andy Nuttall, Editor Street Fighter 2 on the Amiga The One for Amiga Games was something of a non-event, but if you avoided it you might like to know that Super SF2 is under development promising to be, well, super. We've got a full and exclusive Work in Progress, along with a preview of Virgin's CD32-only smash Lost Eden. Fab. We don't expect for one minute that there's anyone out there who hasn't seen all three of the Star Wars films (and if there is anyone then it's even more important that you read on), but that doesn't mean you wouldn't want your very own copy of the excellent Inlogy for posterty now would you? And of course any Star Wars aficionados out there can't have missed our Dark Forces review that starts on page 58. (and if you haven't noticed the cover then we're surprised you can read this, because it's not in Braille) the fab new Doom-style shooter from Virgin Virgin has also given us 10 top-looking Star Wars T-shirts to give away to the runners up who don't win the Trilogy videos. So answers on a postcard to CVG Darker than Dark Forces compo. CVG. 30-32 Farringdon Lane, Farringdon, London EC1R 3AU, once you've answered, this quick quesie... David Upchurch, Editor Although we've been exclusively PC Games hunting down aliens in X-Com: Terror From The Deep, it's Dark Forces that's made us gibber wildly with enthusiasm this month. We've also taken a peek at Descent, Discworld and Premier Manager 3, while Falcon 4 and Slipstream have fallen under the Preview spotlight. Christina Erskine, Editor Much like our sister mag PC PC Review Games (and CVG) we have been clocking all the Doom clones this month. Of course there's Virgin's Dark Forces, but we've also been playing Descent from Interplay. The control method adds something new as you fly instead walk round the 3D texture mapped levels. Top stuff. And your question is... What was Mark Hamil's last starring role? All entries have to be here by April 15, the editor's decision is final and no one from Emap Images or Virgin Interactive can enter, so there. Mark Patterson, Editor Is Dark Forces better than Computer and Video Games Doom? Not quite is the answer. But being a sad Star Wars spanner it's one of the only games I've actually spent any of my free time playing. Still, I'm looking forward to Panzer Dragoon on the Saturn 'cos I've finally given up on Magic Carpet and clocked Raiden so I'm in desperate need of a shoot-'em-up fix. 112 "
