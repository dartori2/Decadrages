"C+VG D to Internation 0000090 Reviews this issue International Karate 2 Super Sprint Alpha Mission/ Hollywood Poker Quedex/Hysteria Joe Blade  MACHINE: CBM 64 SUPPLIER: SYSTEM 3/ ACTIVISION PRICE: .99 REVIEWER: PAUL Had enough of being kicked in the head, punched in the kidneys and smashed in the stomach? No? Good. Just get your bruised and battered body over to the computer and get ready for another bout of flesh-flaying body-swaying, cruel-punching, bone-wrenching, fist-flailing, high-kicking karate. So what's new? Let's face it, they've been some pretty excellent martial arts games over the past year or so-who needs another one? There's nothing new to be done, is there? WRONG! Sound the fanfares and get the flags out for System 3's International Karate 2, the sequel that's more than equal to the original. The man given the job of creating this masterpiece of macho mayhem is Archer Maclean, creator of the classic Drop Zone. C+VG has seen a very early copy of the game and there may be a number of changes added to the finished copy but, without any fear, we say this game is the BUSINESS The obvious innovation is that Archer has added an extra computer controlled character to spice up the action. This means that you can get thumped from two different directions at the same time! No wonder the fighters are always seeing stars. Obviously, in the one-player mode, the computer controls the other two fighters. But when there are two players it's quite good fun to gang up on the computer man. It won't take too long before you discover there are some new moves which you can make. My favourite is the backflip, an almost acrobatic movement which allows you to zip out of trouble. The other is more difficult to describe. Imagine your player is trapped between the other fighters. It's possible to get him to face out of the screen and jump with both legs moving out and upwards in what is a very balletic way. Get your timing right and it's possible to put your opponents flat on their backs very quickly.

Archer has also added a touch of humour by making the fighter's karate suit bottoms fall down occasionally, turning the game briefly into a sort of Carry on Karate.

"LOG Super Sprint SOTS  SUPPLIER: ELECTRIC DREAMS  MACHINE: C64/SPECTRUM/ AMSTRAD/ATARIST PRICE: .99 (SPEC) .99 (AMS) .99 (C64) .99 (DISCS  VERSION: SPECTRUM/64 REVIEWER: TIM Here's a real treat for arcade addicts. That all time classic, Super Sprint, converted for your computer will all the features of the Atari coin-op intact except maybe the steering wheel which you have to supply yourself. But don't borrow one from your Dad's car just as he's going off to work. That could spark off a few family arguments... If you've never seen the arcade machine you won't know that Super Sprint gives you a bird's eye view of a race track there are eight different tracks to choose from and challenges you to drive your super sprint machines as fast as you can to beat the rest to the finish line. Along the way you'll encounter hazards like oil-slicks, puddles, tornadoes ramps and underpasses. Not your ordinary race tracks these, as you'll discover. You can play alone or head to head with a friend the best way take part in a series of races or simply practice. You'll need plenty of practice even if you are an expert on the arcade machine. Its take sometime to come to grips with steering and accelerating at the right moment in time. When I first picked up the stick I found myself getting aquainted with the trackside walls quite frequently. Luckily Catalyst Coders have included the helicopter sequence which flies in a new totally undented car when you've damaged the first one beyond repair. All the time you are bouncing off the walls the drone computer controlled cars are racing away four laps isn't long you know and the race ends when the lead car crosses the finish line. Then the scene shifts to the winners circle -an accurate representation from the coin-op this and you see your finishing position, score and any bonuses while the crowd waves at you! Get a high score and you can enter you name in the Super Sprint Hall of Fame. If you manage to beat the drone cars or your opponent in two player mode you move onto the next track in the sequence. If you are playing alone, or come second, you can simply selct any track you want to race on. The C64 version is a multi-load game, so when tracks 1-4 are completed you have to load in the next four. The spectrum game also ads in all eight tracks at once. Each race consists of four laps -and as you race you'll see golden spanners and bonus scores appearing on the track. Drive over these to collect them. Pick up three or more golden spanners during a race and you'll be able to customise your race car by fitting extra features. Features like super traction, higher top speed, turbo acceleration or increased scoring. Apart from scoring each feature has five levels. It's up to you to work out what combination of features and levels you need to win. As a novice I'd go for the increased traction before anything else just to help get to grips with the tricky steering. The Spectrum version of Super Sprint is pretty basic the graphics are simple but adequate, as is the sound. The cars are small and the whole appearance of the game is a bit fiddly. You do get the winners circle and hall of fame features however. The 64 version is excellent. It looks good, plays pretty much like the arcade machine and has sto many nice touches that you'll want to keep comeing back for more. I found the music for the one-player 64 game terribly irritating after a while and turned the sound down. By the way, the two player option allows you to compete one-on-one or drive against a computer car as well. Once you get to grips with the fiddly steering you're in for a whole lot of fun so don't throw away your joystick in disgust after a couple of attempts. It will help you if you've played the coin-opand may be Super Sprint addicts will get more out of this offering, than the rest of you. But despite the initial frustrations I still came back for more and eventually got to grips with the game. So far the 64 version is the ultimate conversion. But I've had a sneak peek at the Atari ST version which looks even nicer. We've yet to have a look at the Amstrad game at time of going to press.

This is where you begin your Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom about this game. I think that the sound could have been a lot better, though. A lot of the sound effects were not all that descriptive. There's one or two snags that I'd like to point out. Firstly, each level which is made up of three scenes has to be loaded in separately, and when you lose all of your lives the first level has to be reloaded. If you purchase the game on tape, you will find this both tedious and tiresome. Secondly, it will take you quite a lot of practice to eventually master the game as it is extremely hard.

All that ever seems to be written nowadays is either updated versions of old games or converted arcade games. More often than not, these are pretty appalling. But this is not the case with the conversion of Renegade. Although the actual arcade original was nothing much to rave about, Imagine has done a marvellous job at converting it. You plan the part of a street wise vigilante who is on his way through the squalid streets of an infamous city to meet his girlfriend, Lucy. The only problem is that she's on the 'bad' side of town. \"So what?\" hear you cry. So what indeed. But this guy has to defeat a series of attacks by the most vicious gangs in the city. There are five different levels: Subway, Pier, Sleezy Street Scene, End Street and interior You have to pass all these levels, until you are eventually united with your girlfriend. Each of these scenarios is infested with thugs and villains, brandishing a selation of harmful weapons. To attain tedious character control the game is superb value for money and will give your hours of knucklebusting fun. All of you ST and Amstrad users will be glad to hear that the versions for your computers are well above average and well worth spending all your hard earned pocket money on. Any of you who are Spectrum or C64 owners will, I'm afraid, have to see the game for yourself, just so you can make your own opinions about the game.

At any one time you can train up to as many as three characters, one after each other. These \"extras\" are very helpful in your progression through goody goodies who will either help you or follow you, to rebel palace guards who will confront you and attack without hesitation. I found this to be one of the low points of the game. You see, in certain places the guards turn up in abundance and it takes so long to actually jump from the adventure screen to the combat screen, you are left waiting about twiddling your thumbs for ages. Even for the Commodore, the jump is very slow indeed. Once you get into combat with the guards, you have to fight them barehanded until you obtain a weapon whilst they wield swords. I found them easy to defeat. All you had to do was keep was waining. kicking and punching low and For each guard you defeat they collapse. It got quite you may get an item you can repetitive and my enthusiasm use, be it a torch or a hammer REVIEWS training. Once over the training hurdle, you then set off on your mission. This is where the adventure/fantasy role-playing comes into it. You have to search around an island for the orb and this involves going through jungle and other vegetable-covered terrain. You meet various folk, from When I opened Moebius, I liked what I saw. There were two disks, a reference sheet and a free oriental headband! Some blurb on the box told me that the game was a combination of both an adventure and an arcade, with a healthy dose of fantasy role-playing thrown in. leagerly got involved and found out that you play the part of the newest disciple under instruction from Moebius, the Windwalker. He tells you that the Orb of Celestial Harmony has been stolen by the forces of evil and this has caused turmoil on the planet. Earthquakes, droughts and other natural disasters are now commonplace. It is your job to get it back and set the world to rights. However, before you go off merrily Bruce Lee-ing through the countryside, you have to prove yourself in all the three styles of combat: swordfighting, barehands and the mental prowess of Divination. The training mode is very easy indeed. Even an incompetent like me got through it without much trouble. I liked the choice of keys available for these tests, they made it that much easier to control your character's actions You can select up to nine speeds in training combat mode, one being freeze frame plus some experience points. These points enable you to get better at skills such as listening out for your opponents. These skills are measures in levels and the higher you get the better your skills are. The game continues on this basis as you plough through the levels of Earth, Air, Fire and Water, defeating ninjas, guards and other random encounters alike until you recover the orb. The game has lots of other gimmicks including the abilities to cast spells (two systems). read magic maps, throw shurikens and encounter wild animals. When I finished playing this game for the last time, I examined the blurb on the box once again. It claims 50-100 hours of playing time. I can believe it. The only trouble is that you are going to spend half of it hanging about waiting for something to happen when you should be in combat! Moebius is worth a look if you can afford it.

The ever-hungry Yogi must replenish his energy by finding food-expecially the nourishing picnic baskets left behind by forgetful campers. And as if you hadn't already guessed â€” there are lots of hazards for Yogi geysers, bees, birds, frogs, etc. At the bottom of the screen is the Boo-meter which shows how far Yogi is away from his pent up pal. Each part of Jellystone poses different problems rivers to jump, lakes to cross, sharpfanged snakes, angry campers, furious fat ladies, a meanminded moose, hot-tempered hunters and Ranger Smith who always chases Yogi. As well as being full of crazy critters, Jellystone has some strange caves. Yogi will have to use them from time to time. But when he goes in one he doesn't know where he's going to come out. It may be nearer to BooBocor it may be further away. When Yogi starts his mission of mercy, it is January. When December comes, Yogi has to hibernate and Boo-Boo will never be rescued. So Yogi has to free Boo-Boo as quickly as possible and as the seasons change and hibernation gets near, things start looking bad for Boo-Boo.

Well done, Starlight. The best yet. Earth's resources are running out (even Starlight acknowledges this idea is a bit over-used) and using three battle droids you must form a continuous link across an intergalactic link across a grid. Each step on the way you must complete a landscape by collecting the energy pods there. Win and the link is yours. But if you are defeated it shows white on the grid and you must try for another link. You have three ZMX battle droids at the start of the game, each with its own strength and capabilities. Select which one to use and which grid link you wish to play for and the droid is plunged into the battlescape. In all there are 37 landscapes to explore. So you can go for the quick link win (hopefully) or travel the grid piling up the points. Lots of action in this very playable offering.

The two games are pretty similar, although personally I prefer this excursion into the tried and tested shoot-'em-up format. Like Hades you fly your space fighter up the screen blasting on coming aliens and shooting up ground installations. Like Hades you can collect extra bits of firepower from pods on the surface of asteroids and space stations. Like Hades the game is initially very difficult to master. this game many times before Things move FAST! Like Hades It's nicely presented and there's a neat high-score table packaged with good sound with a gimmicky way of putting effects and pretty graphics but your name up in lights. it's still a standard shoot-'em-up Other than that you've seen without a big arcade name to give you a reason to rush out and get it.

All this is in aid of announcing C+VG's awesomely exclusive arcade competition. Yup, you could be the lucky winner of a extra special Namco Bosconian arcade machine, as used by the programmers of Mastertronic's newest coin-op conversion. Imagine it. Your very own coin-up, happily humming to itself in your bedroom, just waiting for you to take the controls and save the world from zillions of trigger-happy aliens. Bosconian just happens to be one of the Ed's favourite arcade machines so you're really lucky we've managed to persuade him to give it away. Still, he's been locked away in a darkened room until the winner has been chosen-giving you time to get your entries in! What we want you to do is read the Bosconian game scenario and then come up with an illustration of a scene from the game. You can draw a space battle, an alien or even the Bosconian Starfighter itself. Your imagination is the only restriction.

"THE SCENARIO The time had come at last. The domination of the Orbitals had to end, and this was the only chance. It was time for mankind to regain their place as the aliens had destroyed the old order in the disastrous \"Rock War\"--when they had rained meteoric destruction down on Earth from their orbiting Spacestationshad put aside their differences for one final effort to regain their independence. They had built a space-worthy Starfighter and equipped it with the best technology that they could acquire. Of course the aliens withheld their most sophisticated devices, that was how they kept the world enslaved. However, due to the secret nature of the project, only one such craft could be built. The aliens must not be allowed to let their dreaded missiles loose again. Your mission is to fly the only space craft available to destroy the orbital Spacestations. This is the last chance for the people of Earth, for their orbiting masters will never again allow them even this slim chance to regain their freedom. You must not fail! Be careful, space is full of debris and mines. The aliens have plenty of fighter craft, and they are faster then yours! Only a true hero can save the Earth! VICO "

"Knightmare was viable and would attract a devoted following. adventure game should never play the same twice. A lot of adventure games are based on mapping and solving a dungeon or some other sort of maze. This just wasn't good enough for a TV series. Once a good team worked out the correct route they would have cracked most of the problems. And worse still, so would the viewers. \"Contestants won't escape from the Knightmare dungeon that easily. For a start it's irrational-it keeps shifting and changing. And the perils and puzzles change with it.\" This constant change can only be realised by the use of the sophisticated computer trickery. Conventional studio sets would be \"too restrictive,\" says Tim. nightmare is the brilliant television Wood, 12, and the three advisers were Edward Halliwell, 13, Jonathon adventure game now stunning audiences Morley and Paul Knight, both 12.

It's taken him two pulsing. Time is running out for Dreams' computer version of the TV long years to convince the television Richard. Safe with Treguard, show which should be out soon. But companies that the Knightmare idea Richard's three advisers are wracking for those who haven't yet been their brains trying to save him. exposed to the magic of Knightmare, There are two ways out. One is too here is what all the fuss is about. ghastly to contemplate, the other is Teams of adventurers aged back up the monster's gullet. But between 12 and 14 take up the quest how? to explore and survive in a computerThen the solution! Get Richard to created world of fantasy.

"-d dream come true The helmet he wears means he can only see the floor. He must rely on his He insists Knightmare owes more to computer adventure games rather than straight role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. \"I'm a games player\" he says, \"but not Dungeons and Dragons. played it for half-an-hour once but I don't have five hours to spare. It doesn't fit into my life-style.\" He continued: \"I admire computer programmers, people such as Steve Turner (Dragontore, RanaRama) who do their research property.\" He rates Turner's RanaRama as far superior to Gauntlet. Â«My sons reckons I'm the only over-40s arcade champ going.\" It is really only possible for a show such as Knightmare to appear on television due to the technical advances in computer trickery. The man behind the graphics is Robert Harris, who spent hundreds of hours creating the mystical maze and special effects. In the control room next to the studio he uses two Spaceward Supernova computers to change scenes, control apparitions and the surprises which confront the adventurers. But before you rush out to try and buy a Supernova, you'd better know that they cost around ,000 each. The backgrounds were originally painted by artist Dave Rowe. The pictures were then digitised, ammended, relit and merged on the Supernova. Models of monsters were also made, photographed, digitised and then animated. When all this is combined with the live action, the effect is breathtaking. But it is all brilliantly executed illusion. The adventurers never see F RE EZ E R Treguard are filmed and these shots are later slotted in to the action. One false move or dodgy advice from the advisers can put the adventurer in deadly peril. One wrong wrong action and the game is over. And the game is for real. The adventurers can do what they like. They are not given any warning of what can happen. As Hugo Myatt, the actor who plays Treguard, says: \"My biggest problem is not knowing what the adventurers are going to say. It's not just a challenge for them, it's a challenge for the actors as well -we've got to advisers totally for help and be quick enough to react and respond directions. in the right way.\" In the control room he can be seen And that is Knightmare-a dream on a monitor. On another monitorare come true for games players. It's a the computer graphics, backgrounds. pity that everybody can't have a go. animations, etc. These two pictures There are already enough teams to are overlayed and it is this united compete in the first series but you image which is shown to the three could be lucky if the TV chlets give advisers. So for them the adventurer the go-ahead for another series. And actually appears to be in a monster's that will only happen if the stomatch, stone corridor, or dungeon programme is supported by you. with hideous monsters and strange Knightmare is screened creatures. Neat, eh? throughout the ITV network on In another studio the advisers and Mondays at 4.45pm. how the effects are done while playing the game because this would niin the atmosphere. A technique known as Chromakey allows all the different elements of Knightmare to be merged into what you, the viewer, and the adventurers It works roughly like this. Richard, or the other adventurer, is placed in a studio which is totally pale blue in colour, with various objects or actors, they are included that particular scene. "

"OOO0000000000 REVIEWS Tony Takoushi will be pulling out all the stops to bring you all the latest, hottest news and reviews from the console scene-not only in the UK but worldwide. Just look at the gems in this issuean exclusive review of Nemesis plus a red-hot news on Nintendo games coming soon from the US/Japan. So stay with C+VG, it's where the NEWS is! Until now I thought that MSX Nemesis was the definitive version. Well it's been topped by the Nintendo version. The Nintendo version has all the elements of the MSX version BUT also has superior graphics and is actually more playable, as the controller has a second button allowing you to choose your weapon without a wild lunge for the keyboard.

Nemesis was the first game to follow in the Defender style and in many respects was an improvement. 1 000013100 HI 000013100 ME AN MACHINES SHITET 217-000092500 HI 000092500 The aim of Nemesis is to go from planet to planet, destroying aliens and taking on a mean mothership at the end of each planet. You can beef up your armaments by shooting complete alien patterns which turn into red pods, if you collect these pods an icon at the bottom of the screen shows which weapon can be chosen. There are six weapons to choose from, speed/missile/double fire/laser/ optional extra ship and force field. Your ship moves left to right against a very smooth scrolling backdrop, there are six planets to work through and the backdrops get ever more colourful and detailed 1P 000048100 HI 000048100 O...........

Mitre Games is giving away FIVE copies of their excellent boxed P.B.M. Tribes of Crane Tribes is without a doubt THE best presented game in the UK. Each of these boxed sets are worth .95 so they are well worth winning You are a leader of a tribe attempting to survive on a hostile and barren planet. To win one of the five boxed games all you have to do is write in and tell me what a Mitre is, what it is used for and how is it used. I will pick the first five people out of a hat on October 16th. The winners will be printed in this column. Mitre has also asked me to tell you that if anyone wishes to join their excellent game Mitgard, they can have their first turn FREE Mitgard is a complete simulation of Military, Economic, Political and Cultural activity on a large scale in a fantasy world. As you work your way up you can control vast forces of wealth and political influence. There are graphics, depicting forts and deployment of your forces, sieges and strategic positions. It is computer moderated, but I believe there is a large G.M. involvement and participation for written reports. Start up costs .00 for a large rulebook and further rounds cost .00 a time. This game should seriously be considered by wargamers, or people who like a lot of diplomacy and tactics. Finally, Mitre would like to know that they are always on the lookout for new G.M.s, so if you have O' levels in English, good handwriting, experience of fantasy role playing and have a good imagination, drop me a line and I will pass all the details onto Mitre. Turnaround time in The Hunting is going to be increased because as I write the G.M. has just had a couple of weeks off. The word on the street is-be patient! Although we would like G.M.s to work 24 hours a day, 52 weeks a year they are only human (well some of them anyway) and they deserve a break. I suppose that as computers do not take holidays, computerized P.B.M.s can count this as some kind of advantage. Sloth Enterprises has decided to re-launch their game The Enchriddion. It's a great game, and if you win, you receive a cash prize, which is a fixed percentage of the turn fees. I have seen it first hand and even played in the playtest, so I feel qualified to tell you that it is a very enjoyable game. You need good powers of imagination though, for the game is set in a fantasy-medieval type world, where you have been asked to find the most powerful book in "

"Who or what is Moebius? \"Who\" is easy. He's a real rarity: comic artist as opposed to a comic hero with a secret identity. By day, as it were, he's Jean Giraud, artist/co-creator of one of France's most popular western strips, Lieutenant Blueberry. By night (creatively speaking) he's probably the most off-the-wall genius in comics today. Giraud had already built a reputation as a fine \"mainstream\" comics artist under his own name, particularly on Blueberry, when he realised the need for other outlets for his creativity and for his interest in science fiction. His solution was to dream up a new identity for himself, enigmatically named Moebius after the German, mathematician who devised the \"endless loop\" of paper known as the Moebius strip. Since the early 70s Moebius (sometimes, just to add to the confusion, signing himself Jean Gir) has unleashed on the public a series of extraordinary fantasy/ science fiction stories. These, and his part in founding the revolutionary comic strip magazine Metal Hurland, marked a great leap forward in story-telling techniques, in public acceptance of comic strips ... and in sheer mindblowing story concepts. It didn't take long for American publishers to recognise the genius of Moebius (wouldn't that make a good title for a book?). One of them, in fact, provided what seemed like the ideal vehicle for Moebius to conquer the English-speaking world: an American edition of Metal Hurland called Heavy Metal. Unfortunately, the reality didn't live up to the promise. The translations of Moebius idiomatic French were stilted and sometimes inaccurate, and the colouring was not at all as Moebius had intended. Nevertheless, his fame spread, and a year or two later found Moebius in America doing design work on two films dear to C+VG's heart, Alen and Tron. This long preamble is all leading up to something something quite unlikely, in fact. Would you believe Marvel Comics to the rescue? To be more precise, the Epic Comics division of Marvel, which began as a sort of alternative to Heavy Metal, is now in the process of re-presenting all of Moebius' works, specially re-translated and recoloured under the supervision of the man himself. They're being published as a series of six deluxe volumes aimed at \"mature readers\". The first two have already appeared; the third should be out by the time you read this. All six are being imported by Titan Distributors and sold through comic shops at about .50 each. And they're highly recommended. Those are the facts. What's more difficult to define is: what is Moebius? You could say he's a true artist, constantly pushing himself to achieve something new and different. You could call him a master storyteller in the fantasy genre. Or you could choose simply to judge him by his works. What you discover is that here we're dealing with a man who's seriously weird. For instance, the first volume of \"Collected Fantasies of Jean Giraud\", as it's subtitled, contains: \"The Repairmen\" Our first meeting with Stel and Atan, who crop up again in the next story. They find a very strange way of fixing a damaged Waymaster, one of a \"mysterious race who drive endlessly across the incredible networks of road which covers their planet\". This, though, is just a prequel to... \"Upon a Star\" â€” A wonderful story originally commissioned by Citren, the car company, as an extra-special giveaway for their top sales people \"thereby\", as Moebius puts it in his introduction, \"frustrating all the traditional French comics collectors\"! It concerns a space-bound \"Marie Celeste\", a graveyard of abandoned spaceships whose 300,000 crew members are camping out in the shadow of a gigantic blue pyramid (which turns out ot be something else entirely)...and a 1938 Citren. We begin to get an idea of the cosmic scale on which this man works! \"Aedena\" has a similar theme humans lifted to a higher plane by alien civilisation but with a rather different focus and some beautiful colours. \"Celestial Venice\" â€” Did you know that there are 127 active Venices, over 4,000 having already sunk? This is the story of one that's saved in the nick of time... Volume two contains the stories that revolutionised French comics. \"Arzach\" is a series of wordless strips about a silent, pterodactyl* riding warrior, plus a brand-new Arzach tale which hasn't yet appeared in France. Each story is characterised by a final, cruelly humorous, twist. Enough words go directly to your nearest comic shop and experience Moebius for yourself! Philip Morton "
