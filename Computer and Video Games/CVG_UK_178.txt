You might guess that there are people here who don't ordinarily 'go for games' in such a big way as the those writing the magazines, marketing personnel and ad managers for example. But all faces lit up at the sight of Super Mario 64, and you could feel the atmosphere in the games room lift in the way it would if a famous celebrity were to make an entrance. Underlying all this are developments with just as much potential, with the only frustration being that the UK has to wait so long to reap the benefits.

"games NEWSO [VIDEO GAME ARMAGEDDON! ] NINTENDO 64 very special news section this month, which deserves a small introduction. The release of Nintendo 64 has inevitably caused our industry to seriously examine the broad scheme of things. This has been a crucial month for Sega and Sony as they vie for the best possible position to face the onslaught of Mario 64 mania! NINTENDO On the front page of FreePlay, we tell you about how Quake has already been pirated and posted right across the Internet. It's a worrying situation when the biggest PC event since Lotus becomes a free for all placing another perspective on the future of PC Games, especially protection against software pirates. It's a volcanic situation out there, to say the least! (Nintendo NINTENDO 64 SELLS 300 000 ON DAY ONE! On 23 June 300 000 people claimed their Nintendo 64 from shops across Japan. The majority of which had been reserved since 21 April. In response to this initial demand, Nintendo planned to ship a further 200 000 systems by the end of June. However latest reports are that 800 000 units have been shipped to Japanese stores in order to meet with consumer demand. Nintendo of America are claiming an \"Industry Sales Record\", with US customers already asking for more N64s than can be supplied come 30 September the official launch date. Apparently 500 000 won't be enough! With sales figures like this, Nintendo may not be exaggerating with their intentions to have 3.6 million systems in Japanese homes before April 1997. ELEVEN 623E! Nintendo 64 NEWS BUTI CONVENIENCE STORES TO THE RESCUE! After the initial N64 furor, hardware sales are reported to have dropped in Japan apparently through lack of new software. The situation is not that Mario 64 is in any way disappointing, just that the next batch isn't due until two months after. Nintendo's original plan was to have 21 games available Of course Nintendo fully expected the initial N64 frenzy. It was also guaran:  by the end of the year, but that figure has since dropped to 14. However, teed that Super Mario 64 would be sold on a ratio of 1:1 (which it did!). So, : Nintendo intend on releasing 1.2 million brochures in Japan, introducing the company entered an agreement with Daiei Convenience Systems, who these games to the public. Games are also going to be previewed in retail own the Lawson chain of convenience stores, to sell the initial three software stores. The next big N64 release is Wave Race 64, to be released in titles. Seven Eleven Japan, and Family Mart already sold Nintendo software : September, together with the not-so-exciting Cu-On-Pa (the Japanese name evidently Lawson didn't want to miss out! : for Endor fun) "


"BIZARRE CONSOLE SALES FIGURES! computer video games based on the predictions of Alps Electric (who make controllers for Sega, Sony and Ninendo), forsaw N64 affecting PlayStation sales. By their reckonSo is N64 crushing its puny Sony and Sega competitors into the dust? Well, ing, N64 would steal market share from PlayStation, which currently holds from latest sales figures, printed in Japan's leading video games magazine, 42% of the Japanese market (equal to Sega). With Sega holding steady, and Famicon Tsushin, it's difficult to tell. While initially the N64 took a clear sales N64 claiming 9% by the end of July, this means that Sega would EFFECTIVELY lead, in the weeks that have followed Japanese PlayStation sales have be market leader in Japan! steadily increased, to the point where its weekly sales are above those of It's going to be a few months yet, before these turbulant sales figures settle N64. Saturn sales meanwhile, have remained steady. and we can more clearly see how things are. Could this be the first three This contradicts sales reports published in Computer Trade Weekly which, console domination war?

Nintendo and Microsoft, together with Nomura Research Institute have announced they plan to launch an information service linked to satelitte broadcasting and the internet. Currently, Nintendo run a satellite-based games service called 'Satellaview', for the Super Famicom. Sega also have a netlink add-on for the Saturn in Japan (a screen shot of which is seen below). More news on all these, as and when it comes. 100 Incredibly, both Duke Nukem and NIGHTS have managed to reach the top of the Japanese multi-format games charts in the weeks following N64's launch. There's still great interest in other formats! 1297 Apliz SEGASATURN INTERNET N64 NOT HERE UNTIL NEXT YEAR! *** FOK44038HP **** us * * That says it all really. Amid all this N64 madness the fact is, Hiroshi Yamauchi, head of Nintendo, has clearly stated that N64 will NOT be released in Europe this year. So ignore what you've read in other magazines, Nintendo 64 will be here next spring (April, we reckon) at the earliest. If you're really desperate for the machine this year, you're going to have to consider buying an import machine. We don't believe there's any safety risks in buying import (after all, we have ourselves). However, bear in mind your machine won't be guaranteed by the manufacturers, you're going to need a power and signal convertor, you're going to be paying more, and your machine may not be compatible with a UK model. But hey, that's the life of the dedicated gamer! 000000 ** B   FEEL THE NOISE!

"computer video games MEGALO THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL ARCADE MACHINE! \"SEGA ENTERPRISES, SPECIAL «HANDS-ON» SHOW, INVITATION ONLY, 2ND FLOOR, SMALL EXHIBITION HAL NEWS O [min] Co 3 LAUNCH: SPECIAL REPORT he most powerful piece of gaming hardware was revealed in Kamata, Japan on 26 July: Virtua Fighter 3. Our correspondent in Japan received a personal invitation to the event, hosted by Director Yu Suzuki of AM2, and one of Tokyo's most famous gaming celebrities Shinjuku Jacky. His report begins with general observations of the game, and progresses through details of each stage, eventually handing over to Mr Yu Suzuki and Shinjuku Jacky for a final discussion. Enjoy. Apparently this is the roof top of a Chinese restaurant. Pai's leg attack is using the new motion blur effect. Lau uses a sideways dodge [via the E button] to avoid Takaarashi's outstretched arm thrust. GAME DESIGN NOTES Reaction to new characters Sega's design team have been handing out a lot of questionnaires at the location tests of VF3 to get feed back on the public's impressions of the game. While most comments have been favourable, one point of dissatisfaction has been the almost naked Takaarashi. Apparently, too much flesh makes him look a little bland so they are taking him back to the drawing board to put some clothes on him. FU On top of the restaurant again, Lau fights Aoi. Aoi and Jeffry fight on a desert island in the South Seas. CHALLENGER STAGE DESIGN 016 COVER STORY Unlike previous games that have a rather artificially rigid feel to them, VF3 has a more natural-looking design. All stages have an open sensation, giving a feeling of freedom. It looks like you can go anywhere. In reality, carefully positioned natural features and man-made objects prevent such wanderings if they didn't, it would turn into an RPG! The new Undulation (Terrain Topography) adds even more incredible realism. All fighting stages are designed to be a little higher than the surrounding area, so that the camera can swing around and look down and around the characters. Some levels even allow you to jump down ledges, walk up steps or wade through water. Each level has it's own distinctive layout so each one has to mastered. Now players have to consider the stage layout, as well as their favourite character, as some fighters are better suited to certain areas!  Texture maps being prepared for use in Virtua Fighter 3. Scenery is used strategically in VF3.  SEGA ALL SCREEN SHOTS ARE WORK IN PROGRESS "


"computer video games JEFF GENERAL OBSERVATIONS  When you select a character, their head turns slightly toward you, their eyes look at you, and they screw up their faces in preparation for battle. In two player mode the other selected characters move also Jacky's hair is always slightly waving.  Both Wolf's and Shun's hats come off during the game if they suffer a violent hit. Just like Pai's in VF2, the hat remains on the screen where it fell.  The sound is awesome too, with great noises and sound effects throughout. Selecting Wolf and he imitates the cry of a wolf it's very realistic. In VF2 the balance of music was 40% to the special effect sound 60%. In VF3 the music is 20% and the special effect sound is 80%. They used a lot of stereo sampling. DALLENGES DIFFERENT COSTUMES FOR SECOND PLAYER! V Costumes change completely depending on whether you are 1P or 2P. For example Wolf's traditional wrestling kit is exchanged for the all-new cowboy hat and spurred boots. Jeffry has either his tropical look, or his new fishing-boat kit complete with Wellington boots and strong trousers! Sarah has either blue Jeans, or tight black pants and mini-top. Designing these new outfits took a long time, but the capabilities of the Model 3 board allowed AM2's imagination to run wild! Five DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VF3 AND NEWT (1) New Characters: Umenokouji and Takaarashi. First chance players got at hands-on experience, they devoted most of their time to original characters Jacky, Akira, Pai, and the rest. As you would. So everyone is going to be learning from scratch with these exciting new characters. 235 NEW? (3) New Dodge Operation: The Escape 'E' Button. Commonly thought of simply as a sideways-step button. However pressing kick or punch immediately after using the E Button enables a 'transposition' a move which is key to VF3! AOI 3 LAUNCH: SPECIAL REPORT COVER STORY (2) Undulation: Difference in Terrain Level. Where your opponent is sent flying with a mid-air combo. his/her journey down an inclination means the time it takes you to land increases allowing you to get in more hits during the mid-air combo. On the other hand, an upwards sloping surface decreases your chances of hits in a mid-air combo. Undulation changes combination attacks to a large degree, so you'll need to adjust to the new fighting system quickly. But of course practice pays off in the end, by making the game much more enjoyable. Also, in the case of a top-down attack from a higher place, the height difference between you and the opponent increases the damage proportionally. Using your skills to position yourself above an enemy makes your attacks much more effective. Making the most of the undulating stages will become accepted as one of the most important strategies in the game. In VF2 attacks like Sarah's Mirage Kick can prove almost ineffective against heavier characters. VF3 has inherited a similar problem', but with undulation two things can happen: 1) three-hit-attack charas at the bottom of a sloping surface might slip back, unable to get in all of their attacks. 2) Where they are at the top of a slope, it is more difficult for an opponent to escape all three hits. TAKAARASHI About Transposition Moves: While dodging you opponent's attack, or straight after you've dodged your opponent, you can get in an attack. It's also very effective for close combat offensive moves: For example, in the case where your opponent is delivering a barrage of punches, until now you had to suffer the blows by using the Guard Button, using your best judgment for retaliation. But, with the 'E' Button, you can approach the opponent offensively to get your own attacks in. This kind of play is far more positive. Through dodging, sharp players have the scope to increase their chances of victory. With this method beginners have a better chance of trashing even veteran VF2 masters! DOOOOO  "


"computer Video games NEWS O OYU SUZUKI INTERVIEW, WITH SHINJUKU JACKY STAGE DESCRIPTIONS Please note that neither the stage names, or which characters are assigned to which stages, have been decided yet. These names and character assignments are my personal opinion only! All levels are still in development. Where you see the word COMPLETED means only that a picture of this level appears on the Stage Select screen, while the other playable levels have only an empty space. High Rise Building Stage: [Jacky] <COMPLETED> You get a great feeling of height from his stage the glass floor and perfectly scaled vanishing points really give you vertigo! Buildings both near and far give the impression of great depth of field. As one who used to work at the top of high buildings, I can tell you it's incredibly realistic. Otherwise the fight area is typically flat, and square. Although protected on two sides with railings, the other two are unprotected. If a character rings out here, the camera pans out faraway as fast as possible, leaving the victor much smaller on screen, while the loser plummets to his/her death. Although the speed is lightning fast, the buildings' scale out beautifully smooth. Distant buildings just have yellow squares for windows, you can't quite make out what it is behind the slightly closer ones, but the nearest are clear enough to see desk lights, furniture and other office equipment. Sometimes looks as though people are moving behind the windows! YU SUZUKI INTERVIEW, WITH SHINJUKU JACKY 3 LAUNCH: SPECIAL REPORT SJ Shinjuku Jacky YS Yu Suzuki SJ Firstly, the biggest difference for VF3 is the new board. Compared to VF2 what are the main differences? YS If you talk about hardware then compared to the Model 2 board it's more than three times as powerful. With the improved computer graphics a whole variety of things have now become possible to do. Caribbean Island Stage: [Jeffry] <COMPLETED> For me, the best stage of all: So many things are moving around the fighters, it feels as though the whole stage is alive. The general setting is a tiny sand bar, a few meters away from a small peninsular. There are clouds in the sky, but the sun is seen shining and it's light reflects off the waves. Because the sand bar is cambered all round, the sea level raises and lowers with the tide, shrinking and enlarging the play area. The rippling effect of the water across the sand is perfect. And when it subsides, a ring of darker wet sand is left. But this quickly dries under the hot sun to a light yellow again. Seagulls, sometimes a few, sometimes a lot swoop and soar in the sky. Occasionally they dive into the water to catch fish! The motion of the birds is very accurate, with their wings folding back as they dive then flapping madly to get airborne again. They fly towards and away from the camera a little as well. Characters can also interact with scenery: sand is kicked up as they walk, and falling on the floor sends sand scattering too. You can take them splashing into the water too. If you are knocked over, the water splashes high. Stand motionless on the edge, and the sea comes in around their feet with a slight ripple effect. SJ The detail of the stage representation is almost lifelike. Would you say that the most important part of VF3 has to be the graphics? YS Of course that's an important element. However, whether the game is enjoyable or not has nothing to do with the technology. Really, I want to talk about the technology but, after all, enjoyable gameplay is the most important point. Anyway, the new CPU compared to the Model 2 board is much more powerful. This means that an incredible amount of detail can be managed. So with regard to the various fighting techniques, they can be produced more beautifully and smoothly. Japanese Fortress Stage: [Akira] <COMPLETED> Similar old fortresses were all the rage in the Shogunate Era! The fighting area is set inside a fortress, close to one of the main outer walls and fortified entrance. A portcullis prevents escape! This area has a number of height changes: Large steps towards the entrance; a long inclined area; and a long drop to one side where the floor gives way to a lower fortress level. Stone walls and floor slabs have a weathered appearance, with moss growing on the wall, and weeds between the slabs. Leaves resting on the floor are easily disturbed merely walking on them shifts their position a little. A fast kick or turning action lifts them off the floor where upon they spin around. Someone falling scatters the leaves in all directions. Attention to detail is amazing, with the leaves quickly rising off the ground, but slowly zig-zagging down. Two continuously fast moving characters are always surrounded in moving leaves. COVER STORY Foto Chinese Wall Stage: [Pal] <COMPLETED> Boasts the most impressive scenery of all the stages. A magnificent view of the Chinese wall stretches into the distance, with mountains in the background, and a hillside runs alongside the wall, sharply dropping away. Every guard post on the wall is marked by a giant banner, fluttering in the wind. A rising sun is seen above the land, with a slight blur due to the horizon. Between the hills and mountains is mist (Probably a crisp early morning). The wall follows the curve of the hills up and down, enabling characters to use the steps along the for tactical advantage. They can also use the small walls at either side of top to trap opponents. As the fighting area is long and narrow, occasionally the camera angle puts the wall in the way so you so can't see your character, whereby the wall fades to become opaque if the viewing distance is far. Close in, where the wall begins to fill the screen, it fades away completely leaving a clear screen. Wow! SJ This time the biggest difference is the operation configuration. Up to now there have been only three buttons, but now you've added one more. Could you explain this? YS In the beginning the VF series was released with 3 buttons, however you could play by just using 2. You could defend by pushing back on the lever instead. Of course, a simple interface is good, however, you can't say that the more buttons there are, the more complex it becomes, and the fewer buttons there are, the simpler it becomes. At a glance, functionally making the Guard operation a separate button is conceptually easy to understand. In the same way we've made the dodge operation a separate feature, and it also is easier to understand. We've taken this bold move to develop this new interface, and we believe in it. Even so, you can still use two buttons if you want to. This game can handle that. However, the location of the 'transposition' will have lost it's meaning. Chinatown Stage: [Shun) <COMPLETED> AM2 are using Shun's stage for all the official screen shots. The fighting area is on top of a slanted, wooden board roof of a shop. There are a lot of Chinese signs around so it could be a shopping area. This curved roof gives a great feeling of depth. As the camera angle swings you can see other shops and houses, and the streets below. In the distance are only more houses, so you really get the impression that you're right in the centre of a built-up town area. An iron bar fence to one side prevents fighters from falling off, and the slope of roof becomes steeper on one side, making it look like you couldn't get up it if you tried. In fact it is possible to fall of other side! SJ The merit of not having to rely on complex move ments means it's now become easier hasn't it? YS The distinctive feature of VF2 was that good timing was essential. For someone as good as yourself who's become an expert, the judgment of timing and precision hits isn't a problem, but to the average person getting the timing right is extremely difficult. Those who've already seen VF3 have commented that although it isn't bad, compared to VF2 it has become a little easier.  O SEGA ALL SCREEN SHOTS ARE WORK IN PROGRESS "


"computer video games However, we don't want to reveal lots of fighting techniques all at once. Rather we want to build up gradually by first releasing easy commands and then progressively more difficult ones. By learning the commands in this way everyone has a chance to use them. Snowing Waterfall Stage: [Aoi] <COMPLETED> Set in a small rock gully at the base of two small waterfalls. It's snowing and there's a thin layer of snow on the floor, and th walls are frozen with bits of ice and snow clinging to the crags. An irregularly shaped floor is caused by the weathering of the mountain stream, and a slightly sunken pool, with a few streams of water flowing between the rocks. The rock floor is smoothed off, and curves into the water as opposed to a sharp drop. Snow isn't small white drops falling in front of the screen it's 3D! This means that the snow in the distance is smaller than the snow in front of the screen so as the camera angle swings, so does the snow. When a pans out away from the characters there's a slight misting effect, simulating brief obscured vision. This changes in intensity depending on the distance. At the bottom of the waterfalls white foam bubbles up, then drifts away from the waterfall, fading with distance. Look at the ripples on surface of the water, and you can see that the current shifts away from the falls. Walking, jumping, or falling in the water sends water splashing in all directions. If the gully wall gets in the way, it is faded out or completely removed. No ugly polygon clipping here. SJ Even though the game is still in development you've decided to make some of the techniques public haven't you? YS That's true but just because we revealed some of the techniques doesn't mean that its power to interest people has been lost. Even if you know the techniques, it's the way you use them that's important. SJ Looking to the future what do you have planned? YS From here on we will continue our efforts day and night in order to get the game balance right. I hope that everybody will look forward to it's release. Underground Cavern Stage: [Wolf] <COMPLETED> Set inside a deep cave, the only light comes from a large log fire in the distance. Fire crackles and spits with little cinders occasion ally flying off. The flames twist and change with all the characteris tic roaring of a big fire. Light from the fire flickers on the walls. Shadows fade or darken accordingly. The brightness is good enough to pick up the detail of the rock strata you can even see mould growing, and the occasional mark where water has run down the wall side. Nothing is flat here: Walls curve and bend like a real cavern, there are stalagmites and stalactites in the distance and the floor is uneven. The fighting area has a few rock floor tiers rising on one side, with a gentle slope running from one side to the other. At one-side there's large hole in the floor, revealing another dimly-lit cavern filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Needs to be seen to be believed. V Totoro Japanese Sumo Ring/Shrine Stage: [Takaarashi] <UNDER-DEVELOPMENT> A long narrow stepped path, cut into the rock, leads down from the Shrine and up to the fighting area a huge circular rock Sumo ring. to one side in the distance a path wends it's way around the mountainside and going over a small red bridge that straddles a small waterfall. On the other side you are looking away from the moun. tain, and over the surrounding land with an impressive skyline. Although the fighting area is basically flat, the circular Sumo ring gives an unusual visual effect and there's a sharp but not too far drop to a lower ledge on the side away from the Shrine.Players need to be cautious of position when fighting on this level, because the tightness of the Sumo ring is hidden by the deceptive wide open scenery. Subway Station Stage: [Sarah] <UNDER-DEVELOPMENT> An apparently disused subway station, the two main features being he passing of a train, and the steps leading to an exit. The train moves fast and smooth, appearing behind the moving characters with no problems whatsoever. Four or five steps are available on one side of the station for strategic fighting. The extra height can be used to jump over your opponent, or make for easier head blows with a kick attack. On a technical note, I saw Wolf knocked down while he was standing on the stairs and his shadow was drawn perfectly on the steps below him! Though the station looks a little barren at the moment, some superbly drawn billboard signs brighten up the place. (Look out for the car commercial in particular). Whether or not you can fall off the platform edge and be hit by a train isn't certain, but it's a possibility. Nervous gamesplayers study the new VF3 techniques for the first time ever. Desert Stage: [Kage] <UNDER-DEVELOPMENT> Deceptively simple-looking, but Kage's area contains absolutely stunning visual effects. The entire stage is set in a vast desert which stretches right back to the horizon. In the distance is a blazing sun dips below the dunes, causing heat distortion. Sand dunes fall in huge arcs and curved tips. Whenever the strong breeze blows, and when catches the edge of a dune, it blows up a gust of sand over the dunes. Amazing! BTW this is not a 2D sprite trick, but full 3D. The modelling of the air dynamics as the sand billows and dissipates into the air is beyond belief. And it's not just in the background either occasionally the sand is blown across the characters' fighting area, straight towards the camera. Wow! Just like in Jeffry's stage, sand is kicked up and sent scattering by the fighters. Because the sand is darker here, you can see foot steps left by walking. Dragging your feet leaves a line too. Falling over leaves an appropriately sized mark in the sand. And if you watch carefully, you can see the wind gradually erase the marks. Incredible considering this stage isn't finished yet! The stage area is difficult to determine, as I never saw anyone 'Ring Out'. Whether or not you can be pushed off the edge, and be sent rolling down the side of a giant sand dune is yet to be known. Fest 3 LAUNCH: SPECIAL REPORT COVER STORY    Library Stage: (Lau) <UNDER-DEVELOPMENT> At the beginning of a new round, when the camera zooms across the great hall, it starts high near the ceiling, then swoops low before fixing on the characters. It's awesome!!! Although I couldn't see any moving parts to the background, it is very impressive. Huge pillars and marble arches support walkways around the side of walls. Detailed patterns are found both in the wall design and stone flooring. Side walls have giant windows running for most of their length, and there's a huge domed ceiling of glass. The main arena is a raised dias in the centre of the library. However, you can come off here and fight around the immediate area too. The steps are carpeted in lush velvet, and all the railings glitter gold. But it is of the library which really catches your attention. While the other levels, like the mountain and beach areas, are visually bigger in appearance, the fact is that the backgrounds are just pictures drawn to give the impression of distance. In the library everything is constructed from polygons so the true scale of the model 3 board's capabilities are clearly shown. Playground Stage: (Lion) <UNDER-DEVELOPMENT> This stage looked so similar to Shun's Chinatown Stage that for a long time I thought they were the same thing! Set on a concrete yard with a metal fence around the outside, this is the most like Fighting Viper's of them all. Although there are some buildings around the outside of the fighting area, you can still see some scenery in the far distance. Similar to the other levels, there are sharp drops to the sides meaning Ring Out for somebody. The surrounding fence fades away when it obscures the fight. The fighting area looked flat which is why I'm sure it can't be the other roof top stage. YOUR FAVOURITES N ACTION Hidden Stage: [Dural] <?> Although Dural is in the main cabinet illustrations: at the moment, she's not a selectable character and didn't appear in any of the game battles I saw or played. As to whether she will have her own stage hasn't been revealed yet, but with the apparently limitless power of Model 3, the mind boggles as to what kind of stage they could create for this fighting machine. 13 "

USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES * A PC OF EVERYTHING CHECK 0:233 cos Dear CVG, I would be very pleased if you could answer some questions of mine. Noils LAP 20-S Dear CVG, I hoped that you could help with my questions. Will a Japanese controller work on a UK Saturn, as I've seen the Mega Lo and it looks cool? Also, after hearing about the PAL version of X-Men being slower than the Japanese version, and not to mention more potentially great games. I would like to know if I got a Datel converter and played the Japanese version, if there would be a 17.5% speed loss and borders? Can't you get your Saturn 'chipped' so it plays all Saturn games, regardless of their origin? Also, have you seen the posters of Orchid and that woman with that half-naked chest in KIZ? To me this shows that the industry is developing from the female side. Maybe there should be a game which contains all women fighters and you get to fight girls with hot attitudes. Personally I think that this is what the readers want to see in magazines babes and news from Japan. Finally I would like to know if there's any way I could find out about the beat 'em ups released for the Mega Drive in Japan ie Art of Fighting. Oh, and if anybody thinks they know my identity, they are all mistaken. All I can say is CYBER CITY OEDO RULES! Have you seen it? All three are excellent aren't they. I just can't stop watching them! I would be honoured if you could tell me where I can get myself the music CD for it, and posters etc. And tell Paul to hold on in August you shall feel a lot better as I will subscribe soon. Please keep up the good work!!!! Japanese Sensation LRP TIMES 10:35.o 2 O:125 ENERGY PlayStation Wipeout 2097. Michel Playbell hopes his PC can match it. 1. I own a 486 66 Mhz PC with a quad speed CDROM, 8 Mb RAM. I love speed so what do you think can be the best upgrade to my PC so that it can be fast and I could play smoothly every game? . I am about to buy a UK PlayStation but I think that I am going to regret buying it. The main reason that I'll buy it is because of games like Tekken 2. Wipeout 2, and others. But now you say Tekken 3 has started and that the PlayStation doesn't have the power to make it, and the other games that will come from System 33. So will it come on PlayStation, and does PlayStation have enough power to make it, along with all the other System 33 games? Otherwise what will Sony do? I heard that an upgrade was planned. If there is I will buy a PlayStation. 3. When is Namco's Power VR coming out officially in the UK, and how much will it cost? 4. What must the power of a PC be to run the Power VR games FAST? 5. When is Wipeout 2 (2097) coming to PlayStation? 6. When are Street Fighter Alpha and Marvel Super Heroes coming out on PC? Michel Playbell, Cyprus S8117 CVG: So far we haven't encountered any problems running a Japanese pad on a UK machine. However the Japanese system seems to freeze if switched on with a UK joypad in either port. Yes, you can have your Saturn specially adapted to run every country's games, but the speed still needs sorting out from 50 to 60 Hz. There have already been fighting games featuring just girls, unfortunately they've all been crap. Anyway, surely there's more pleasure to be gained from a female perspective, with girls kicking guys. Given your chosen nickname we suspect that the best kind of magazine for you is any one of the quality publications to come out of Japan on a regular basis: Famicom Tsushin (weekly); Saturn Fan (Bi-Monthly); Dengeki (monthly); and especially Gamest (monthly). There's more Japanese news than you could possibly handle, and more often than not, some cool 'babes'. Most Europeans could find this too much. Super Street Fighter is still the best fighting game on the Mega Drive the SNK games didn't translate that well, unfortunately. Paul is over the moon. CVG: 1. Well, a Pentium 133 Mhz plus another 8 Mb RAM would be pretty awesome 2. There's no upgrade planned for the PlayStation, though it's a nice rumour. But while Sony's 32-bit system may not portray Tekken 3 to its full graphical advantage (it's rumoured to rival VF3), there's no reason why the PS can't reproduce the gameplay unless that is so incredibly radical too. 14 "


"WE LOVE YOU NAMCO, WE DO! computer video games BAG Dear CVG, About two years ago I stumbled into a Bridlington arcade, where I saw an incredible beat 'em up called Tekken. Since then I have been playing it nonstop, as well as its bigger brother Tekken 2. I thought Tekken was THE GAME (even better than VF2!) Since that experience I have been hooked on video games, and especially Namco games. I've played all their recent ones including Rave Racer, Dirt Dash, Time Crisis, Cyber Cycles, Alpine Racer, and of course Soul Edge. All are brilliant (except maybe Alpine Racer). I was so overwhelmed by Namco I bought a PlayStation with Tekken. I was hoping to buy Tekken 2 as well. But I've heard out of all the above mentioned games only Soul Edge is PlayStation bound. THIS REALLY P*****S ME OFF! Because Namco were the only reason I bought my PlayStation. Recently the top games mags including EGM and Games Master have said that Dirt Dash and Rave Racer would be made for N64. Is this true? Was I wrong in saying only Soul Edge on PlayStation? If I wasn't, I'm selling my PlayStation and buying a Saturn. Or if Namco do develop for Nintendo, an N64. Please put my mind at rest. Chris Charlesworth STAR LETTER MSX AND THE PSX CVG: We love Namco stuff too, and it's understandable that you bought a PlayStation just to play their great games. But Tekken 2 is already available for PS, Chris, and we know that Time Crisis is coming. Where have you been? And even if Soul Edge were the only Namco conversion in the pipeline, that's still bloody amazing! As for Namco and N64 our lips are sealed WINS 14 CHALLENGER. SEUNG MINA VOLDO Dear CVG, I own a US PlayStation and SFA and Resident Evil as my top games. As an import machine owner I would like to see more of the import scene in your mag. I was thinking, maybe you could put in a checkpoint for the US and Jap games, because their release dates are almost always different from the European games. Before I had a games console I owned an MSX computer. There were a lot of great games available for it. Is there any chance that any of the following MSX games will come out on PlayStation: Solid Snake (Metal Gear 2); SD Snatcher, Maze of Gallious; Nemesis; Fray, and Xak? If you've heard of MSX, you know that they're fantastic games. Main developers were Konami and Micro Cabin. Since Sony made MSX machines for the European and Japanese market, I was wondering if Sony still has connections with MSX developers. If not, maybe they could restore those connections. I'm sure that those games in a 32-bit version will be perfect for the PlayStation. Peter Klungel, Appingedam PS Best games mag around. Keep it up! namco FREE PLAY Soul Edge: Version B is being ported over to PlayStation. Yee-haah! Could it be that Dirt Dash is one of the first N64 games from Namco...? * USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES namco PC FIGHTER '96 CVG: Crikey when somebody starts talking about the MSX you know they love their games! Konami have Gradius (aka Nemesis) Deluxe Pack available in Japan, and Track n Field (AKA Hyper Sports) is now available for PlayStation in the UK. Unfortunately Micro Cabin aren't develop ing for Sony. Back to your first point, we hope to incorporate some kind of Japanese and US release schedule soon, though only for the titles which people are likely to want on import, as we don't want to encroach too much on our UK coverage have you seen how many games are released in Japan each month! Dear CVG, Your change in the magazine's look was astonishing. So keep up the good work. My questions here are, in my opinion, very useful for people who all need a satisfying answer. So please give answers that are straight and understandable. 1. With the things you wrote in your Free Play (issue #3) you meant that after its arcade release Tekken 3 will come out exclusively on Power VR card?\" 2. I've got a 486/ 100 DX4 and 8 Mb RAM. Which is the wisest upgrade? (I was thinking for a Pentium Pro upgrade) 3. Are Marvel Super Heroes, SF Alpha 1&2, Tekken 2 and Night Warriors coming out on the PC? If yes, when? 4. On what and when is Street Fighter 3 coming out? And do you have any idea of how good it's going to be? (You said it's going to be 3D, but where's the proof?) 5. Will there be exclusive games for Saturn 2, and will the current Saturn games run on it faster? Is the current adaptor compatible with it? Anastasis Antoniou, Cyprus WOHIALI 190 CVG: 1. No, what we said was Tekken 3 is rumoured to be using Power VR. Arcade Rave Racer. It looks 2. Either a Pentium or another 8 Mb of incredible through Power VR too. RAM depends on what you can afford. 3. Noooooo... 4. The arcade, and it's being previewed in September. Capcom have officially announced that SF3 is 2D. The 3D thing was always just a tasty rumour. 5. We take it you mean the Flash Saturn? In which case the answer is no. Sorry, you didn't say which kind of adaptor so no one could answer the last question. 15 "


"computer video games MR HYDE WHO HAILS FROM CLYDE Dear CVG, Great mag! Nice to see a games magazine adding humour in here and there! Please answer my questions. 1. I've played Duke Nukem 3D on the PC-CD ROM and it has loads of controls. So how will the PlayStation control-pad cope? Will this mean some of the controls will be left out of the PS version? 2. Will there be a PS Doom Level Editor coming out? And a Duke Nukem one? 3. How do you get cheats out of games? Do you need to have the Action Replay card? 4. Resident Evil looks superb, but is it true that you can kick the zombies' heads off? And can you put the barrel of the gun in their mouths? Where can I get a demo of it? Craig Nicolson, Clydebank O T CVG: 1. The honest answer is \"we dunno\". 2. No. No. 3. Ed Lomas fell onto the conveyor belt when the Action Replay cards were being made. So we have our own walking/ talking living cheats device. He writes pretty well too, and makes great Pot Noodles. 4. You can kick and stomp on the heads of zombies in RE, but you can't put the gun barrel in their gob. Please see a psychiatrist Craig! And why worry about seeing a demo. Just buy the game, you won't regret it! You cannot get a Level Editor of PS Doom... ...or a Duke Nukem one for that matter! I TELL YOU. ROLL ON CHRISTMAS!!! Dear CVG, I have a couple of suggestions to make your magazine even better: USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES 1. Put coverdisks/ CDs on special editions of your magazines. For example a special PlayStation edition on which there would be a cover CD. 2. Use charts to show which games scored highest with your rating system, and compare this to the chart of the most bought games. 3. More competitions, with better prizes not Power Ranger toys! 4. A gossip column that tells rumours about companies' games, and suspected releases. Gavin Gregory, Potters Bar Dear CVG. I stumbled upon your magazine and, judging by the cover, bought it. I must admit that your magazine is definitely number one, tied with Maximum. The amount of depth and screenshots surprised me. I think that the gaming world is becoming more and more advanced each day. I own a Mega Drive 2, and practically love Sega. The quality of games coming out for Saturn are incredible, which has made me come to the conclusion that I'm going to get a Saturn this Christmas, no questions asked. I would get a PlayStation because of only one game: Tekken 2. But with the rest of Sony's tatty games (excluding the Namco stuff of course), you can understand why Saturn sales are going up. And Nintendo with their 64-bit machine... I mean it looks promising but expensive. Finally a few questions: Can CVG: 1. To put a CD on the cover would put the price up. As its contents would be great for some, but not all, we'd rather give you more in the magazine for less money. 2. The most bought games tend to be those with an attractive price. That's why budget titles feature in the charts quite a lot. So comparing our ratings to sales isn't worthwhile. 3. Hopefully the recent competitions are more to your liking. Power Rangers is a Paul thing which crops up from time to time. He's on stronger dosage these days. 4. We'd rather fill space with facts, but where there's room je Free Play we don't mind sticking in a few potential 'time bombs'. 1. When is the S2 coming to the UK? 2. If you hire a Tekken 2 arcade machine with a key for a week for home play, how much will it cost? 3. Where can you get a guide for King of Fighters '95 which tells you all the moves for all the characters, and how much would it cost? 4. Have you printed move lists for any other beat 'em ups like X-Men or Samurai Shodown 3 in any of your issues? Keith Brooks, Chadderton N OUSIASTOR TALLINN computer video games DEAR HORSE AND PONY computer Video games WIPEOUT 2097 NIGHTS CVG: Thanks Keith! Glad you know exactly what you're after, though you've quite a wait until Christmas! A dedicated fan of beat 'em ups, judging by the extensive list of games supplied with your letter? Your answers: 1. If you mean the \"M\"2, the answer is, probably, never. 2. We guess that figure would come to around . Expensive, eh! 3, 4. Not yet, but it's something we're considering. All requests for guides are taken into account keep sending them in!

Ecstasy's effect on your brain can make you feel happy but could also cause periods of depression and anxiety that last for days afterwards. It might even cause brain damage. Taking Ecstasy doesn't guarantee you a good time. Taking Ecstasy can cause kidney and liver damage. A bad reaction to E could suddenly develop even if you've taken it before and felt O.K. Another danger is dehydration. The best way to combat this, if dancing, is to sip about a pint of water an hour, take regular rests and keep salt levels up. Ecstasy could be pure or it could be cut with all kinds of other stuff. You just don't know. Even if it's pure, that doesn't mean it's safe. The dangers could also be increased if it's taken with other drugs or alcohol. national drugs helpline 0800 77 66 00 If you'd like more information about drugs or just a talk, give us a call free and in total confidence.

If the answer is even only «maybe», Super Mario 64 will transport you to a high you never knew existed. We've been there. We know. Better than that, we can tell you all about it. SUPER 6A SUPE mazing. The game? Sure. But not just that. No, it's amazing how quickly everyone got used to it here arguably the greatest video game experience ever; Super Mario 64. At first the very sight of a mere attract sequence is enough to draw gasps of wonder. Disbelief which is magnified X10 after realising this is the game environment displayed to brief, dramatic effect not an untouchable pre-rendered demo. Soon as Mario takes less than twenty steps into his new world, any inquisitive mind in attendance with eyes to serve it, and a mouth to voice ideas, goes into overdrive. It's very difficult to keep suggestions and exclamations to yourself when watching another player. If you're lucky enough to be in charge of Mario you will hardly be able to speak at first, guaranteed. And all this before Mario so much as goes near one of the enchanted paintings in Princess Peach's castle. Now, at long last, the time has come to go inside. And we recommend anybody with a thirst for the new and exciting to take a look at what Nintendo have achieved. SUPER GREATEST GAME!  1990 Nintendo Just six years ago... ... Mario looked like this! 64-BIT TECHNOLOGY 24-CARAT GAMEPLAY 8C39EUR 3Z(tu.   * 7* . -Super Mario 64 is all about unlocking secrets, searching for clues which may lead to astonishing discoveries. Rather than release a new type of driving game, or advanced 3D fighting game to establish what N64 is about, Nintendo have opened a whole new world of gameplay with Super Mario 64. Its creators didn't set out to demo how a Silicon Graphics Reality Engine can merely enhance existing video game environments. Instead they crafted something entirely new. An unknown. This is the celebration: We have a new technology to appreciate great! But more importantly, there are these people who know how to create the perfect guided tour of that technology. A introductory tour of the castle, courtesy of Lakitu. THERE ARE PLATFORM GAMES The basic premise of a platform game has remained unchanged for over ten years. Nintendo's Mario wasn't just there at the beginning, he was the beginning; in a game called Donkey Kong. (NUOSTINIWUS) Running from left to right, manoeuvring skilfully to collect bonus items, and jumping onto enemy characters for more points is Mario territory. You're either stubborn or unfortunately ignorant not to recognise this. The best anyone else except Nintendo has ever achieved with an original character oriented action game in the light of this has been attitude and variation, with one exception NIGHTS from Sega, which you can read all about elsewhere this issue. As each new door opens in SM64 you don't know what to expect! It's worth reminding ourselves what traditional Mario gameplay is about, in order to highlight the huge step SM64 represents. Many of the most ingenious stuff first appeared in Super Mario Bros 3. 18 "

However there are blocks which the transparent and metal hats, serve exactly the same function, Mario's whole body is affected. though they can't be placed. Of course. But the Nintendo team are always full of clever surprises in this area. What you see in a Mario game one year, is sure to appear in somebody else's game a few months later. Super Mario IV boasts a wealth of clever approaches. 20 MARIO MARIO x 106 ** *116 16 *110 Now platforms/sections of land lie in any direction through 360° There's still the same level of inventiveness, like the wind-up catapults, and magic carpet. SWITCH PALACE WARP CANNON First introduced in Super Mario World, like the Warps these are key to the ultimate completion of the game. In the Super NES game there are hundreds of transparent blocks which form paths to far-off locations, or contain useful power-ups. There's so much travel involved in Mario games that shortcuts are deliberately included to save time and tired fingers. However there's no big sign-post saying shortcut here'. Players have to find them, which is part of the fun. Sometimes exits in Super Mario World take the form of a cannon, disguised as a pipe. These launch Mario into the air, at the perfect height to pass through a half-way bonus gate. It's a neat feature which adds humour, but not much to the game. As Super Mario 64 isn't connected in the same way as Super Mario World, Switch Palaces don't have the same wode ranging effects. At least not that we know of yet. Most courses hide invisible areas which transport Mario, Star Trek style, to another section of the same course. Not so wide ranging, but useful in another way. LOOK AHEAD When Mario climbs into a cannon during his new adventure, players may direct him wherever they please within a 180° left or right. GREATEST GAME! A useful feature in Super Mario World which helped accustom play ers to the L and R buttons on the Super NES controller. The feature allows Mario to see what's slightly before and after him, by scrolling the screen left or right. Mario can look all around him from any point. Lakitu hovvers close behind his head, allowing players to examine anywhere except behind. For that he just turns around. A DATE WITH BOWSER In all except Super Mario Bros 2 (aka Super Mario Bros USA in Japan) a showdown with this mutant dinosaur, is inevitable. He's always in custody of Princess Peach, and almost always totally easy to defeat. What a buffoon! Bowser is absolutely terrifying in his 64-bit incarnation! Now this is how you always believed a fire breathing, sorcerer king to appear. Still a buffoon though. 19  Nintendo "

"computer BLOCKS games SOUNDS ALIVE! ***** Their colour dictates their prize. Initially the red, green, and blue variaty are transparent, for which Mario needs to locate the Switch Palaces in order to solidify them. There are eight red coins found in each Switch Palace, providing incentive to spend more time than absolutely necessary in each one. NINTENDO YELLOY Because Super Mario 64 is streamed from a cartridge, Nintendo have been able to work wonders with the sound. More specifically the music, which adapts to suit the scene the split second that scene changes. This is happening all the time, some times it's so slight the player hardly notices. So if suddenly you feel a little more cautious than usual, or closer to discovery, the music is no doubt the reason. Break these for a bunch of coins. It's a good idea to jump again to prevent the coins from scattering about the place jumping collects them before they hit the ground. GREEN Terminator T-1000! Now Mario is able to withstand damage from all enemies, and his extra eight enables him to walk beneath the water where ususally he just floats.

The remainder are accounted for as Castle Secrets. A specified number of stars rewards Mario with increased access to various parts of the castle. Plus certain events are triggered upon reaching key amounts. NINTENDO 64 Bomb Soldier's Battle Field Lots of open space for Mario to stretch his legs, and for players to get accustomed to his control. Trailing Mario up the side of a mountain is the first breathtaking experience in the game as the ground level fades into the distance, and huge iron balls rumble toward you.

SUPER GA Run rings around the eyes to make them dizzy, so they vanish. Just like taking a ride at the best theme park in the world!

But it is what lies beneath his feet that is the major concern in the dunes SAND TRAPS! Solving the riddle of the Pyramid is of paramount importance, a task which unveils some of the desert's untold mysteries. Punch the giant hand in the eye to win! Mario is safe, only if he stands under the cut-out in that cube. COURSES GREATEST GAME! Water Land Even by looking at the picture in a magazine, it's hard to convey the enormity of Bowser's submarine. Apart from the Star which hovers above the deck, secrets found elesewhere in Water Land are much less obvious. A whirlpool threatens to suck Mario in, as he struggles to collect coins. Looks like Bowser's been here. Yep, definitely him. Well at least he was daft enough to leave this Power Star! 320 W 106 COURSE 10 Cch 1 x 10 Snow Man's Land Even the water is treacherous now, with sub-zero temperatures all around freezing shallow pools and chilling ponds. Before chatting to the cannon monitor, reaching the top of the giant snowman is a tricky problem, with an amusing solution.

"computer video games COURSE 11 NINTENDO 64 Flooded City Hey, no problem! Mario's a plumber, right, so handling a course which depends on teh flow of water should be a cinch. Much of his time is spent raising and lowering the water level in order that he may gain access to bonus blocks and helpful signs. A trip 'down town' requires being shot out of a cannon! He's not friendly. So be careful. 0 COURSE 12 x6 108 * 7 SUPER Big Big Mountain Anyone who has played the Legend of Zelda series should be familiar with Wa-Ki-Ki the monkey. He's here again, though at first it appears he's just playing games and won't be a help at all. He even steals Mario's hat! Explorers should keep a sharp eye out for anything mysterious. Gimme my hat back you monkey! Hard to find, this bit. COURSE 13 Little Big Island Mario uses his magic pipes to alternate between giant and miniature versions of the island. Puzzles which arise as a result are truly ingenious, plus there's the obvious comic benefits too. For obscure, how about \"find five secrets\" as your clue! For amusement value you need only to have Mario biff a tiny koopa! Giant Pirhana Plants. Aak! Hate creepie crawlies! COURSE 14 Cx25 GREATEST GAME! is 10 *706 Tick-ta Clock Even entering Course 14 at the right time requires thought. Once inside Mario is confronted by an abstract representation of clock workings.

Watch the time carefully, it... The clock tower is incredibly high! COURSE 15 Ox0 *106 Rainbow Cruise So fantastic that we don't want ruin all the sights for you. But we will tell you that this matches the Tubular Star World in SMBIV for complexity.

"computer games video SUPER MARIO 6415 HORRIBLE, BUT LOVELY SUPER MARIO 64 IS PROBABLY BETERIHANI AIME SMITH WHY SUPER MARIO 6415 TOTAMIYAWESOMEDIAS com use MA NINTENDO Mario 64 is definitely the best-looking game I've ever seen. But that doesn't make it the best game ever. It just means it's on the most impressive machine ever. What DOES make Mario 64 the best game ever is the quality of the gameplay. The level design is unbelievable! Huge unfolding set-pieces that each provide a uniquely genius series of challenges. It's the classic Mario formula granted fullfreedom in a totally solid-looking world. This combination makes it a gaming experience far beyond anything I've encountered before. It does have faults. The camera angles are illthought out and DO hinder play at times. It's driven me to frustration and I've almost smashed my machine. But this isn't justification for criticising Mario 64. It's scary how quickly we accept what is unbelievable and then start knocking it. Whether it's my favourite game or not is irrelevant. Mario is something totally new and brilliant. You have to experience it to understand why people aren't even comparing it to other games. Although I'm obviously not as devout as 'freak boy' Lomas, to the quest for absolute perfection in video games, I have plaved Mario 64 quite extensively over the last month, more so in fact than any other game during the last five years, including Street fighter. The level of excitement generated by this game and the release of the N64 only compares, in my opinion to, the release of the Super Famicom over six years ago. Most people seem to be ques tioning whether or not Mario 64 is the best game ever. All I can say is that it is the only game that I have ever considered to be that, even though it is certainly not perfect. Aesthetically the game really is something else, and although there are some technical faults it really is the most incredible game ever. Right from the beginning of the game it's clear that you're playing something new not just because of the graphics but because of the freedom of movement and it's something amazing. The worlds have been designed so carefully that every puzzle is logical and can be worked out. Maybe a star will elude you for a week, but you know that with some work you'll get it in the end. Bad points? The camera view isn't totally free, occasionally wandering off to stupid angles just as a tricky jump needs to be made. This means that lives are lost when it's not your fault something that never happens in Super Mario World. Also, serious gamers will play all the time for about a week to finish it, and I've got slight doubts about how much it's going to be replayed. But the overall game is one of the best EVER! MARIO VIEW FROM A BRIDGE: 360° GAME VISION! TACTUALLY DONT MIND PLAYING SUPER MARIO GA & N&USON Up close. Pressing the top C button zooms players right in to the scene. Tap the right c button to swing Lakitu around to the right of Mario. Mario 64 is the most structually sound breakthrough since the Wonderbra. Graphically excellent, an eye opener, with superb three dimentional gameplay. Overall a well rounded concept, packed with hours of fun... And the game's not bad either!! GREATEST GAME! WHY SUPER MARIO 6415 MY FAVOURITE GAMEELER AW. DAVISS Your friendly camera bug boy swings to the left if you press the left C button. To get a wider view of the scene below, press the bottom C button. I'm known for getting very enthusuatic about most great games. In a sense I feel like The Boy Who Cried Wolf a lot of the time. But I have never gone on record to say that a game is the best one ever. Until now. Super Mario 64 is the best console game ever for a number of, mostly obvious, reasons: First of all it is immediately accessible to any player, which reflects Mr Miyamoto's wishes that his game is essentially a toy. People can have as much enjoyment fleeing hissing bombs, and jumping over small hills as mastering the trickiest obstacle on Course 15. Next up, to somebody who has been playing video games for 14 years, discovering a completely new game environment is really special. The 32-bit systems have done a great job of mimicking the arcades for the last couple of years, but SM64 save the obvious platform heritage is totally original. Even greater than that, it manages to play incredibly despite being so different some people could have been completely turned off by it. The great hardware and Nintendo's flair for great graphics and entertaining music only support the experience they don't rule it. The image of SM64 I carry in my head is not just the amazing routines have played through, but which puzzle am going to solve next. If I have one observation which may dissappoint hardcore Mario fans, it's that Super Mario 64 is not the logical next step after Super Mario World; that continuity isn't there. But none of you will want to exchange this for anything else, I guarantee it. Mario uses his 30 stars to open this door. COMING SOON Now we always used to think that stained glass windows were pretty boring, but now... Co-oar! Easily one of the most beautiful scenes in the game.  Nintendo 25 "

Pilots are at the beck and call of the elements, so the trick is first of all to sustain height in order to carry out the tasks set. As with the Rocket Belt, the pilot's legs are the undercarriage. But, unlike the Rocket Belt, there's no propulsion to enable a soft landing if the approach is too fast! GUR Some hang glider missions involve taking photographs of famous landmarks. Pilots use the wind to maintain height, swooping then climbing to maintain speed. Thermals air currents rising up from the ground -lift the glider to greater heights. Tapping the B button stalls the hang glider, by letting some air out of the canopy. 26  1996 NINTENDO/PARADIGM SIMULATION, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. "

Tasks involving missiles vary between target practice, and encounters with a giant metal robot gone haywire.

SATURN BOMBERMAN 9100 6:00 2400 5:40 Conhear Of all Hudson Soft's famous games, Bomberman is the one players associate with the most. Mainly because Bomberman is best played with a group of friends in a four-player competition. But the ultimate in Bomberman thrills have previously only been available on rare occasions at major video games events where Hudson staged challenges on their special High Ten Bomberman set up. 5 10500 6:00 10-PLAYER BOMBERMAN FOR SATURN! HIGH TEN? In other words: Ten-player Bomberman played on a High Definition, Wide Screen TV. Obviously a specialist set up, not intended for home use. Bringing players together has always been part of the 'Human' Hudson Soft tradition, which reached its peak with High Ten Bomberman. Previously the most players a consumer (home) version of Bomberman could support at one time was four. In fact Hudson were the people who pioneered the four-player multi-tap to make this happen.

The two we don't know too well are Honey the Cowgirl, who is currently hosting Hudson's Fun Club on their web site, and her Samurai partner, Cotetsu, who is apparently her number one fan!

ALIEN TRILOGY COMES TO THE SATURN! t's one of the best-selling PlayStation games to date, and no surprise! The combination of a Doom-style shoot 'em up and the awesome presence of the infamous acid-blooded Aliens, is perfect grade-A videogame fodder. And it's something Saturn owners have been begging for (some of them, anyway). Well, the begging stops here, cos the Saturn version is just around the corner. It looks to contain all the traits of the PS version. The brilliant blasting action, the spooky atmospheric graphics, the totally unthreatening aliens that look like men in rubber suits, and the facehuggers that resemble Ed's spindly hand over your face. Still, there's always the samurai androids (obviously removed from the films) to provide a hardcore challenge. Yippie kie yay, everyone! If it isn't already obvious to you, Alien Trilogy is a game based on the three movies. Unlike the three-game Die Hard Trilogy though, these movies have been combined into an single ongoing alien-hunting adventure. Taking on the role of Ripley (who else?) the game starts at the Acheron colony base, after your marine compadres have been wiped out. From there, the action moves onto the prison colony of Alien 3 (obviously it's just next door), and finally onto the crashed alien ship from the first film, which has to be destroyed to end the spread of aliens. 105 137 w 100 1110 The intro is great, but strange.

ALIEN-REPELLENT ROCKET WEAPONRY! SWITCHING TO SPECKLE VISION! 139 With the exception of the second film, the Alien movies aren't exactly drip ping with gung-ho weaponry. Not a problem with this game! It just ignores this fact and loads you up with plenty of destructive toys. Not straight away though. Starting with just a pistol, you work your way up to shot guns, flame throwers and of course, the trusty pulse rifle. Adding to the atmosphere too, are the legendary motion-trackers. Guaranteed to make your stomach tighten every time a biip appears on the scanner! You have to watch out for the giant popcorn kernels that fall from the ceiling. Use them to your advantage. COMING SOON 101 **** Grende If there's one question over the Saturn version, it's the usual \"How well have the lighting and transparency effects have been converted?\". Well, just to upset all those anal-retentive worrywarts out there, the mist-effects have transformed into floating net-curtains, but apart from that the games look near identical. The trade-off (just to cheer you up), is that the Saturn version has much superior sound. But look, quit worrying about it. If you're still bothered by this whole transparency effect issue, you don't deserve an ace machine like the Saturn. NEXT MONTH... GAME NOT OVER, MAN! Grief no. In fact, it's only just started as we review the finished version of this longawaited 3D blaster. Until then, to quote the second film. \"Flippin' heck, we best scram!\" YOU WANT SOME?

Traditional platform action on the Super NES, with lots of twists. I AM YOU AND YOU ARE ME KIRBY SUPERSTAR arnessing such a versatile character as Kirby is tricky. Which is probably why we've seen his name associated with numerous alternative titles such as Pinball, Blockball, Dream Course and Ghost Trap. As a platform personality, Kirby is too clever for his own good — which made the Game Boy and NES outings a doddle to complete (though they are enormous fun while they last). The Super NES, however, is no stranger to intense platform games... ................................................... In case you needed reminding, Kirby has a rather unique way of dispatching his enemies. Which in turn leads to a rather unique way of gaining power-ups. Instead of being limited to bonus items found in boxes, Kirby need only look as far as his next foe for assis. tance. The majority of smaller enemies can be swallowed whole, then spat out as a missile, or absorbed in order to take on their power. In the case of larger ene. mies, their weight is such that it causes stars to emerge from the ground as they pounce. Kirby uses these as against them! BOORE ROOCORTADO There are six styles of game in Kirby Superstar, two of which are only accessible after working through the first four. They're mostly platform-style affairs, but with a broad spectrum of crazy ideas thrown into the mix. Schloop! Kirby attempts to vacuum this tiny Dedede trooper. Over here!

"computer video games %001 ACTION ACTION COMPLETE BY JVC BY JVC 1 PLAYER  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED MEGA CD PREQUEL  STORAGE 1CD  PRICE.99  PUBLISHED BY JVC TEL: 0171 240 3121 SECA SATURN SEPT RELEASE SEOA ATURN Why would a Japanese school girl dress in a Bunny Suit, and brandish a hammer? It's about time you knew. KEIO'S FLYING SQUADRON 2 evoted fans of the Mega-CD might remember the original Keio's Flying Squadron. At least you may remember waiting for that game, only it didn't come out in the UK by virtue of an enormous marketing disaster. But that's all by the way. Very soon Sega Saturn is to support the equally funky 32-bit antics of Bunny Girl Rami Nana-hikari, and her pet dragon Spot. LUNATIC PLATFORM SHOOT 'EM UP FROM JVC IT'S A BOSS THANG While Saturn keio is blatantly unoriginal, it boasts some ingenious boss routines within that tired structure. Until recently all platform games were judged on the complexity of the boss routines, so it's refreshing to encounter this 'old school' again. WOA! DRAGONI Rather than release a graphically enhanced version of Mega-CD Keio for Saturn, JVC have modified the game structure. Instead of setting out as a shoot 'em up, Saturn Keio begins as a platform game. It's very similar in style to the 16-bit Goemon games from Konami lots of traditional Japanese culture references and ingenious boss characters. It's only after progressing through the first couple of scenes that Rami meets with her trusty steed Spot and takes to the skies. EDSEDGANGEB8000Remots DOGCODUOGOOLWAS ODEODOLJ 050QSORGET u003EOGHORN GOEDGEKgnts OGOOO. Boss No 1 is encountered in the Sumo Stadium. Seems the people here are used to seeing weird stuff.

After three hits it transforms into a furious muscle man who tries to pummel Rami. Lastly the charm spins like a top on a pencil-time to bounce on its head again. GREAT EXPECTATIONS TIME FLIES An interview with Yasushi Endo, programmer of Keio's Flying Squadron, printed in Sega Magazine in 1994 revealed some interesting promises for the Saturn sequel. There was talk of using video backgrounds and including 3D bonus stages. Though we haven't encountered any such thing yet. Still, the interview took place before the Saturn hardware was finalised, so we can't hold Endo-san responsible for anything he may have omitted under the circumstances. There's not a great deal more we can add at this stage, short of showing all the game in full-blown detail. We intend to bring you the full, explanatory review next month yes, even the mystic Japanese stuff too. 40 "

Yippee! DESTRUCTION DERBY 2 1 DD2 features an new physics engine, enabling, flips, rolls, and smashes like you wouldn't believe! recking cars is what Destruction Derby is all about with a vague kind of racing theme thrown in for good measure. But once you get past that, what then? Well there's always learning how to make those crashes more spectacular earning points for 360° spins, and so on... .................................... CRASH AND BURN! DESTRUCTION DERBY 2 Well, for a lot of people this routine lost its appeal once the magic of the PlayStation's powerful 3D graphics wore off. For the sequel, development team Reflections thought more about the number of tracks, and the intricacies of them to make more of a racing game. While also increasing the authenticity and detail of the physical models. Plus a big name sequel also gets its own guest celebrity to do the commentary Paul Page. What an overhaul! DECONSTRUCTION CLASSICS No doubt about it, Destruction Derby is best known for its crash scenes 'drivers' don't need to come in first all the time for thrills. For DD2, the designers re-wrote almost the entire game engine, enabling separate parts of the bodywork to show severe damage. To make this even more spectacular, sparks fly and cars which catch fire may even explode! THE PITS Both the 'hood' and 'trunk' of a car can be sent flying in DD2 if hit hard! To account for the excess of damage possible in DD2, the game now features a pit-stop. Reflections are yet to decide how much this service will be limited, as it would be fairly shambolic having drivers nipping in there every second lap! 07 Tracks are now wider to allow drivers to get back into the race after a spin-out. Drivers who spend too much time cowering in the pits miss out on all the action! THE INCREDIBLE DANCING STOMACHS Tracks are now longer and more complex in design; typically meaning that there are jumps involved, and banked corners characterising circuits up to eight-times longer than before. To compensate for this, the handling of all cars has been written from scratch too. In DD2, when cars bank too hard, the four-wheel independent suspension may reactjust like in real life by flipping the car over. We're told that skilled drivers using an analogue controller (Mad Catz, Neg-Con) can drive on two wheels after a bit of practice. You can roll or flip the car in DD2, thanks to the 3D impact dynamics employed. CRASH AND BURN? Expect at least seven race tracks, and four 'Destruction Derby' bowls in the finished version of DD2. If the release date holds, we should have the review next issue. 44 "

This month you could be playing it. We already have! 1'41\" 18 STAGE 3 /:) :) FIGHTING VIPERS nly two weeks after this issue hits the newstands, Fighting Vipers will have been released in Japan. Incredibly, the date has been set for August 30th! Perhaps, following the release of N64, Sega want to remind fans why they bought a Saturn, and there's no better reason than AM2's fighting games. Virtua Fighter and VF2 almost singularly sold the machine in Japan (to the current figure of over 3 million) and Fighting Vipers is set to maintain this fan following. For UK Saturn owners, news of a Japanese release may not seem so exciting. But get this, Fighting Vipers is out here in October! We've already played a 75% complete version and it's incredible! TWO WEEKS TILL THEY HIT THE STREET! ALL THE FIGHTERS * REVEALED! * NEHODNOU SECOND PLAYER COLOURS! All the alternative costumes are now in the game too!

Fully-functioning and ready to SLAM! * GRACE Previously only six Vipers had been revealed. Now all nine are present, and they're all fully playable! Every move for each character (with the exception of the wall climbing ability) has been programmed in, complete with all the hit detection. Timing of the moves, chaining, recovery times, everything is exact. And it's all up and running at arcade speed.

"MOUR EXPLOSION! computer video games CHECKPOINTI TE SHADOWS The 50% Tokyo Toy Fair version featured character shadows. These have been removed from the latest code. Clearly AM2 are reworking them. Unlike VF2, stunted shadows won't be good enough for some levels, especially the low-lit Bayside stage. One feature of Saturn FV we've been dying to see is the armour busting off the Vipers. Now we have, and it's everything we hoped for. Shattering your opponent's protection with an impact move is every bit as dramatic as it is the arcades. Just look at this! SATUR 28 CHECKPOINT 2: THE WALLS Honey Awesome overhead view... BAHN BAHN All the enclosures are present and look excellent. Railings, concrete walls and even the transparent barriers are there (although the latter have a net-effect 212 to their reflections) Busting through them is already possible too! NIIHOLY 1 Watch out! She's powering up an impact move! FICHIANGPERS 1 of Picky getting shelled! KER-RAACK! CHECKPOINT 3: THE SOUND All the arcade music is in there and it ROCKS!. Saturn VF2 was criticised for poor sound effects (due to memory capacity, it's rumoured). FV S sound is currently quieter than we'd like, but the coin-op's effects were always more potent than VF2's (more similar to VFs), so that's an immediate advantage. 1 The sharp smashing sound increases the pain! 1 TAke that you little runt! CHECKPOINT 4: BACKGROUND ANIMATION 284 Honly House The backdrops in Saturn FV are flat. However, they seem to be cleverly locked to the foreground, so the 'floating ring' of VF2 isn't so apparent. Moving scenery such as the truck and plane are still missing and we don't know if they'll be included. CHECKPOINT 5: EXTRA CHARACTERS? YEP! For starters, the boss Mahler (BM over here) is playable. But get this, AM2 are 100% DEFINITELY including a character called Pepsi-Man. Fighting Vipers features Pepsi advertising in Japan (see Picky's board). In Japanese Pepsi TV ads, there's a T1000-style character with no features, who saves the day (by refizzing people's Pepsi for example). He's going to be in the game! Yes, yes, YES! TWO WEEKS TILL THEY HIT THE STREET! COMING SOON TWO WEEKS TILL THEY HIT THE STREET! PRESS START RITON 1 And stay down! PLAY IT AGAIN! 50\" 71 51\"00 With his board strapped to his back, Picky can slide through his opponent's legs and smash 'em in the back! Arcade Fighting Vipers is famed for its awesome multiple replays of the armour-shattering. The Saturn version replicates this effect to perfection. Three multiple-view replays instantaneously cut in, emphasising the power of the attack! OOH MA TRON! K LIGHTING VIPER S! 19.. NEXT MONTH... Saturn VF2 pushed console graphics to new heights with incredible hi-resolution visuals and 60 frames-asecond animation. As we showed last month, Fighting Vipers goes two steps further. First by light sourcing all the fighters, and secondly by gourard-shading them. There is a cost for these added effects though. The res olution is lower (although not so much as Sega Rally s). and we're unable to tell whether the frame rate is still 60 fps, mainly because of the staccato nature of the action (it's all snapping attacks and impact moves). Don't worry though, it all looks totally awesome. The close proximity of FV s Japanese release date to our press deadline, more than likely means we won't be reviewing it next month. Nonetheless, we'll give you better coverage than any other magazine around. Trust us. NEXT MATCH 1 The observation tower is a good demo of the lighting-sourcing. Each corner has a set of floodlights that flick alternately on and off. 47 "

It became a landmark title on the PC, reaffirming Bullfrog's position as a premiere developer of innovative software, and has duly received the conversion treatment to every gaming platform known to man. All excepting Game Boy and Game Gear, of course. Now, with the advent of 32-bit technology, Bullfrog have responded to public demand and produced a sequel to the ever popular original, designed to take full advantage of the power of the latest systems. The Corporation is back, ladies and gentlemen, and they've never looked better. nal game, perfectly blending superla Syndicate Wars has NOTHING to do with a group of people arguing over a lottery as a premiere developer of innovative soft ticket! It has EVERYTHING to do with guns, violence and badass corporate assassins in the Cyber-Punk cities of the future! BULLFROG'S CORPORATION IS BACK! POLICE POLIT POLICE Exitosive action!!! Follow this sequence from left to right: The corporation agents drop a mine then run for cover. A moment later, the mine explodes, reducing the stacks to a pile of rubble. Destruction like this is common place in SW! TAKING SDES Compared to the original, the basic structure of Syndicate remains unchanged: Arm your team of crack 'agents' with hi-calibre weapons and cybernetic body parts, then deploy them into an isometrically scrolling city to effect a series of missions. This time players may adopt the role of Corporation Exec, or a Church Elder; with control of the third power a biker gang planned to appear on an expansion disk at a later date. Each power requires different tactics to succeed. CHP OFF THE OLD BLOCK NH A hundred years have passed since the sinister Corporation achieved global domination in the original Syndicate. Since then they have discovered a way of controlling the world's population with an advanced mind control device known as the CHIP. When attached to a victim's nervous system, the CHIP renders the recipient ignorant of the grim reality of everyday life, and keeps their mind pure of all rebellious thoughts. After almost a century of unchallenged authority the Corporation has grown complacent, and is slow to react when a growing number of CHIPS start to malfunction. allowing citizens to perceive life as it really is. Out of this chaos have risen two major forces: a chain of marauding biker gangs, and a religious cult both using the breakdown of order to seize territory from the Corporation. The scene is set for an explosive showdown, in which YOU determine the outcome! V You can play PONG and BREAKOUT on that screen! No, you can, honestly! Just one example of the many powerful weapons in SW's arsenal! There are two different sides that you can take in Syndicate Wars. The men in trench coats are Corporate agents, while the white robes belong to the Church. The intro shows an ordinary citizen being gunned down by a Syndicate hit squad. Charming. 48 "


"MISSION: MPOSSBLE! computer video games PULILE Missions are based around 30 international cities, and are much more complex than those in the original Syndicate. Some involve visiting two or three locations before completion, where failure to complete part of a mission can result in the mission goals changing. For instance, if a prisoner whom you are transporting escapes, your objective may change from \"Escort' to 'Terminate'. Also, there is more than one way to complete your mission objectives.

"computer Video games EIVE) SCORE ATTACK!! BY SONIC TEAM  PRICE TBA  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE STORAGE 1 CD PUBLISHED BY SEGA TEL : 0181 996 4620 SECAM OUT SEPT 1-2 PLAYERS SATURN SATURN HOLD EVERYTHING! Reading this review is essential to everyone interested in video games. Witness here the birth of an allnew game type the Score Attack! GHIS or months now, we've said NIGHTS is going to be brilliant. But what did we know? We hadn't played it properly. So we feel no shame in admitting to you that we were wrong. Brilliant is way too ordinary a word for NIGHTS. It's one of the most sensational video games EVER made! And we're saying that in a month when the two other greatest games on Earth have arrived. Super Mario 64 redefines the boundaries of video games, Quake pushes escapist violence to the most vividly believable limits, but NIGHTS' contribution lies in its uniqueness. Sonic Team have disregarded all previous videogame rules and created a totally new game concept! Prepare to have your game-brain turned upside down! THE EXHILARATING SENSATION OF FREE-FLIGHT For their first Saturn game, Sonic Team wanted a character that would outpace even their famous hedgehog. As Naoto Oshima, the designer of the Sonic character says, \"You can't beat Sonic running on the ground, so that left flying and the search for a greater thrill from it!\" The result is a character with amazing freedom of movement. Even though NIGHTS is only steered about in a 2D fashion, the degree of control is staggering! So much so, that Sonic Team have created an analogue pad to more effectively play the game. GUE CONTROL! 1640 2500 Although not crucial to the game, the analogue controller is no gimmick. The self-centring cup can be rolled and curled about with ease, more accurately and pleasantly steering NIGHTS about. The best way to describe its move ment is like your eyeball, following NIGHTS around the screen. This should also give you a better idea of NIGHTS' 2D control. He can freely fly up, down, left and right, but can't be steered into the screen. 1 The A-pad turns the stiff control into pleasant rolling sensation. 1 Tight loops like this are simply impossible with the normal D-pad! 1 Pushing the pad fully in one direction increases NIGHTS' speed. 10.40 280 THRUST! Hitting the fire button powers NIGHTS forwards. You can smack enemies away with this.  You'll be able to buy the game with or without the pad. We seriously recommend you get it WITH the pad, for tighter control and relief from the excruciating thumbache the normal D-pad causes. Performing a full loop, creates a warp that sucks anything into it, including baddies. PARALOOP! DOING THE TWIST Sonic Team wanted NIGHTS to portray the sensation of free-flying to a greater degree than merely looping about the screen. That's where the Land R buttons come in. Tapping these allows NIGHTS to spin and flip about his axis in a multitude of ways. It's when using these that you realise NIGHTS IS possibly the most intricately animated game character ever devised. When hovering, L and R twist NIGHTS left and right respectively. Floating upwards, they wheel him both clockwise and anticlockwise. 1 When in motion though, they really come into their own. HE'S LIKE A RAG ON A STICK! 54 Flicking his leg up and curling him back. 1 Cupping his chest, he twirls about. 1 He even grabs his toes and tumbles. "


"PIOT! WOT! computer video games SEGA SATURN There is a storyline to all this escapist madness, and it's as surreal as the gameplay! It follows two children, Elliot and Claris, from the town of Twin Seeds. Both are, having trouble in real life. but when they sleep they dream of a mischievous character called NIGHTS. He has been imprisoned by the ruler of the Nightmare World, and can only fly free when joined by the kids. In return for their help, he flies around Nightopia searching, for their Ideya the strength to overcome their real-life problems stolen by the Nightmarens. It sound like nonsense (and it is), but Sonic Team heavily researched the works of German psychologists, Jung and Holtz, to create this game. What this breaks down to in easy to swallow game, chunks is three dream levels for each kid, with a final level where they face the ruler of Nightmare Wizeman! 1260 25 AWESOME STUNT! 3:25 8320 GIANT LOOPO NGHTS When collected, this ribbon trails behind NIGHTS, and for twelve sec onds you get a chance to perform as many stunts as possible, with a rating given at the end. Paul was overjoyed to be commended by the comment Nice One!', until he realised it meant he'd only done one stunt! Ed's record is a Magnificent Nine, Tom's got a Superb Ten, but the office record is a Dreamy Eleven! Not so amazing when you consider there are around 35 stunts possible! Anyway, the Stunt Ribbon gives us the perfect opportuni ty to show off how the Land R buttons twist NIGHTS about! 16 TO 1 Passing through these loops triggers the Stunt Ribbon. ROULETTE R! TYPHOON! 1 Woah, an Excellent Seven. Not bad, but you could do better! DANCE! MIDDLE LOOP! 104 .2010 102 TORNADO! SCREW! ROULETTEL! GREATEST GAME! THE BASIC GAME A FOUR COURSE DREAM! With the play mechanics sorted out, it's time to face the game itself. Each dream level has four courses that have to be completed. These courses are like aerial race tracks. NIGHTS can't deviate from the route, but can move freely within them. Shown here, are the course layouts for Elliot's first dream Splash Garden. Each one is longer and harder than the last. Once you've completed one, you move straight onto the next. 3 23 EXCELLENT THING!! 1. This hint shows the basic objectives to idiot gamers. And it serves as a good demonstration here! 2. This is where you startNIGHTS' temple! Heading left is the way to go! 5. Now clock up points collecting balls, flying through loops etc. 6. Get back to NIGHTS' temple before the time's out. Your score is totalled, and your course rating shown. CR 106 200118 1 In Splash Garden there's a clock showing the real time! (if your Saturn is set correctly). 6) 3. Collecting blue balls is your primary task You need twenty (indicated top left). 4. They have to be dropped off here. Once done, it explodes and you enter BONUS TIME! THE END? That's only the tip of the iceberg in what is one of the most devious games ever created! If you think the objective of NIGHTS is to finish the seven levels and see the end, you're sorely mistaken. Turn the page now and witness NIGHTS: The Real Game! 55 "


"computer video games SCORE ATTACK THE REAL GAME! 36 602 16410 +70°C \"We made it to take several hours to finish, because we want everyone to see the end. After that, you can still enjoy playing for hours by the 'score, attack' function.\" So say Sonic Team, almost nonchalantly, about NIGHTS' most important fea ture. This is where the spirit of Sonic is reborn. True Sonic fans know the games didn't end on the final boss. Breaking time completion records, gaining all the Chaos Emeralds, collecting every ring on each stage this was what kept you coming back! And Sonic Team have evolved this fan culture into recognised gameplay. Complete mastery and hi-score records are the only objective of NIGHTS! OCH Stop admiring the view and start taking notice of those score multipliers! 919 655950 Collect Chips SPIOSENNE STETUD Once into Bonus Time, all the blue balls turn into gold balls known as chips. Collecting these is the most obvious way to earn big points. BONOS 6700 NIGHTS From the name, you'd think this was just a bit extra' to occupy your remaining seconds. But Bonus Time is when you get to clock up all the big points. So drop off those twenty blue balls as quickly as possible and concentrate on the following areas! 19090000000 12 1500 1 Because the chips are found where the blue balls were, they're the easiest items to locate. 1 Groups of balls are best collected by sucking them into a loop warp. 1 Cages of balls are hidden around the courses. Smashing them yields big rewards. Stars They exist for no other reason than points scoring! Grab these at every opportunity. On every course there are tunnels of rings, which often guide you through the best route. Passing through these adds to your score like everything else. Each ring passed through, causes a consecutively higher-pitched sound to ring out, until you miss one. Pleasant, but it also creates ari incentive to make 'links' of these rings. And that's when the big revelation of Score Attack becomes apparent! LINKS! 361 190 2380 GREATEST GAME! 2 Leute 1 Stars aren't essential to complete the game. So you may overlook them. But they make essential fillers when making long links. NI The kids are only controlled on two occasions at the beginning of each level, when you guide them to NIGHTS. Secondly, when time runs out they separate from NIGHTS, and you have to collect the balls on foot and find NIGHTS again. The kids have full 3D freedom to wander the entirety of every dream level, but they are SLO000W. At first their importance seems minimal, as if Sonic Team put them in with no real purpose. As if they would!! FANCY A NIGHT CAP! Instead of going straight to him, you can wander off collecting balls first. How CREVIEW 1 Some are only available to the kids. Such as these in the igloos! 1 Following the arrow at the start, leads the kids to NIGHTS. 060 O 130 10 ! RUN AWAY! 56 1 NIGHTS has to fly up this tower... 1 ...but Elliot can take this lift to the top! 1. When time runs out NIGHTS dumps the kids! 1 If the alarm clock catches them, they wake! "


"LINKING THE KEY TO HI-SCORES! compute vided games It's not just chains of rings that link together everything can! Collecting balls in a row, stars in a row, balls and then stars and then rings in a row! What's more, as your link increases, so it acts as a score multiplier, making links the most vital Score Attack technique! We've discovered that on some courses, complete links are possible meaning you can go around the course again and again, making immense links! The highest we ve seen is a 114 link! It's yet another competitive element of NIGHTS first stunt chains, now longest links! SATUR. 100 A 31 28470 992 * 100*Z 1009 * 100 * 1 This pod is totally link-related. Once collected, you have to maintain a link to open it... 3030 13 0 POU TVEGHIS 1 The number of links is indicated at the bottom of the screen.

EXAMPLE: A COMPLETE LINK IN ACTION! *)31 5926410 27090 55 28410 1 Flying through these rings starts the link off. 1 Now circle these balls, meanwhile collecting the stars. 1 That reveals more balls!

RESTAAT RUSTAZ 1 Now you're a dream-master it's time to face your living world! 57 "


"mputer Video ames THE WORLDS OF NIGHTS! Seven levels may not seem like much, and in a normal game they wouldn't be. However, in NIGHTS they are more than just stages they are dream worlds! Sonic Team have designed NIGHTS So that you don't merely move from one level to the next. You can choose your favourite dream world and play that. Once completed, it's game over! It's more akin to selecting a race course in a driving game, than working your way through a platformer. What's more, there's more incentive to return, than just beating your hi-score. You need to nurture each of the dreams. FINAL STAGE SPRING VALLEY STICK CANYON 1 Each world has it's own A-Life. Anyone playing can affect it. So beware who you let play! 3380 4740 1000 323 N.GHTS FROZEN BELL MYSTIC FOREST SOFT MUSEUM SPLASH GARDEN 9880 GREATEST GAME! No joke, NIGHTS is a living game! Sonic Team have incorporated what they call A-(for Artificial) Life into the game. Each of the dream worlds is inhabited by creatures called Nightopians. These coneheads are actually programmed with emotion parameters, allowing them to be happy, sad or angry. This isn't randomly-generated, but affected by their surroundings. If NIGHTS doesn't harm the creatures, they relaxfishing, painting or sweeping. If he kills them (you can suck them into a paraloop, whereupon they squeal horribly), they start to fear him and run away. If he treats them well-natching their eggs they play him tunes, mimmick him, follow him. And yes, they really do breed, increasing the numbers of Nightopians on each level! The final level excluded, this gives you six fullydeveloping environments saved inside your Saturn. And you dare to label them as mere 'levels'. + There! See! Little eggs. Just fly over and tap them. 9880 1 Out pop baby nightopians. Delicious between two slices of bread! 1 The little fella is playing his flute you can see the notes, look. 1 Loads of the little brats. Come on breed or I'll kill the lotta ya! 1 Haha, squeal you little turds. You're toast! WEIRD HAPPENINGS! EXCELLENT THING!! 25 451110 'CREVIEW Sonic Team have claimed the A-Life may cause weird things to happen, which even they had not conceived of. Well how about this we hatched a Nightmaren from a horrible green and yellow egg! When you hit the baddies about, they bounce about, eventually coming to rest. Should a Nightopian then touch it, they become contaminated and lay mutant Nightmaren off-spring. They truly are disgusting to look at! 1 In Stick Canyon, NIGHTS passes through a beam that magnetises everything to his body, Drag the cluster to the scales for big points. 58 1 A selection of freaks for your curiosity. DISGUSTING! "


"LIVING SOUND! compute vided games COMMENT NIGHTS is full of amazing features. but easily the most incredible is the sound. It is truly unlike anything we've witnessed before. All the tunes (created by Sonic Team maestro Tetsu Katano have that distinct Sonic flavour, sounding much like those of Sonic CD initially. Sonic Team have invented a system called Cybersound that is tied into the A-Life. Each time you play a level, the Saturn sound chip randomly remixes the tunes. We can't BERSGEND emphasise how phenomenal this is. At first, new instruments are blended over the tunes, but before long the tracks are almost completely unrecognisable new sections have been added, all the instruments have been changed but it ALWAYS sounds superb! We've yet to find the continuous remixing reaching any limit. This is the best videogame sound ever FACT! 89 Just when I thought score-based games were dead, NIGHTS revived those 'old time' thrills in a major way. Of course! wouldn't have devoted long hours finding this out if NIGHTS weren't such a revolutionary experience from the Sonic Team. On the surface, yes it is possible to see everything in a couple of days. Less if you're dedicated. But as soon as you start chasing those impossible links, and revelling in yet another dreamy remix of the best video game music ever, EVER, you'll wonder what you ever did with your life without this game. To say I'm hooked doesn't do the thrill justice. NIGHTS is like hanging onto a favourite recurring dream: when you're deep into it, you don't want out! PAW DAVIES 79000 1 The in-game music is 1 Music for the boss levels played off the Saturn sound is taken off the CD. It's brilchip, mutating with each play. liant, but doesn't change. 1 The are two replay tunes. One for a record-breaker and one for a normal score. HUSS-A-NUIA COMMENT IV.CHIS At first the bosses in NIGHTS seem incredibly easy. But that's when you first play the game to complete it. Once you play for hi-scores, they're infuriating! The time remaining from your boss encounter, is turned into a score multiplier. Beat them with a hundred seconds left and you get your score doubled (x2.0). Beat them with 10 seconds left and you get hardly anything (x1.1). What's more, your boss performance, can effect your overall rating for that stage, pushing you up to an A or dropping you to a D. Never before have bosses been speed tests too! Like Tom, I'm a massive Sonic fan, so the style of NIGHTS appeals to me, but I wasn't as instantly impressed as he was. I finished the game in a few hours, and while I enjoyed it, there didn't seem to be a lot to do other than collecting balls and flying to the right. But playing it again realised the lasting value-racking up massive scores, finding hidden bonuses, mastering the stunt ribbon, getting complete links and then I discovered the magic of A-Life! Breeding a completely new creature and having it live in your level forever is such an amazing idea! This game is pure magic! ED LOMAS 5th night 94730 pts X 1.1 35 sec REVIEWER 104200. GREATEST GAME! 3247 10: 79000 12 1509  GILLWING GULPO REALA 65 Sonic Team haven't let me down! NIGHTS is the perfect evolution of the Sonic game. The high-speed looping gameplay, enhanced by the freedom and power of flight, is more captivating than ever! The incredibly animated character, fantastic worlds and sound, create a hypnotically magical atmosphere. Completing it is easy, but that's not the objective. After initially hanging on for dear life, you suddenly become aware of the razor-tuned gameplay within, goading you to be the best. It's all about rewards. That's why the A-Life is fascinating. Developing your own worlds, breeding your own creatures (monsters if you want) is chilling. Each game should come with adoption papers! And the ever-mutating music is as amazing as it sounds it is the best! People judge games by technical merit, as such NIGHTS won't be acclaimed as the great est. It has too many graphical shortcomings. But beneath the surface it's doing things never done before. NIGHTS has provided me with the most enjoyment of all the games this month. It's my favourite game, and you HAVE to play it! Tom GULSE 29630 CLAWZ PUFFY DREAM FOR TWO Once you beat Reala, a versus option is opened up, allowing a second player to control him in a split screen flying dog-fight. It's mildly diverting as you try to loop-attack each other, but overall quite dull We think Sonic Team could have made much more of this bit stunt ribbon challenges or link races! Sigh. HIGIENE RATING RATINGO V NIGHTS-WIN Exhilarating gameplay like nothing before. And touches of genius that make it a real magical game. As high a five as you can get! REALA LOSE 59 "

Terrorists stick to this man like flies to poo! DIE HARD TRILOGY O DIE HARDCOREI A merica, battling East European terrorists Iew action movies have succeeded in spawning a series of superb sequels. Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark are probably the most famous, with Terminator and Alien (excluding the dreadful Alien 3) following close behind. And then there's the totally superb Die Hard. The original Die Hard film is responsible for more spin-offs than just its own sequels. In fact, it invented the whole everyday-joe-stuck-in-lethal-terrorist-situation-with-trousers-down genre, subsequently keeping Steven Seagal, Wesley Snipes and Keanu Reeves in healthy employment. But we're not concerned with those lesser clones (otherwise we'd be looking at a game called Die Hard and Friends). Nope, what concerns us is the three Die Hard movies. Following the massive success of Alien Trilogy, Probe have turned their roving film-licenseexploiting eye to Die Hard Trilogy. It's multiple Bruce Willis' in a Yippie Kie Yay overload. Or something. Unlike Alien Trilogy, this Die Hard license doesn't pack all three films into one contin uous game. If that was the case, Bruce would be jetting across the expanse of America, battling East European terrorists in his bare-feet! Instead, it's split into three distinctly separate games, each one concentrating on bringing home the best flavour of its respective film. First stop Nakatomi Plaza! nom172m * DIE HARD TRILOGY DIE HARD UTEN The first and best of the films has spawned a semi-overhead 3D blast 'em up. Controlling John McClane on (bare) foot, you have to work your up through 19 storeys of the Nakatomi Plaza, starting in the basement car park. The objectives are simple enough shoot all bad guys and rescue all hostages, then move onto the next storey. On first impressions, this game doesn't seem so great. The tasks seem too repetitive and simple, and actually avoiding enemy fire proves frustrating. However, after a few go's, it develops into a much more enjoyable affair. Learning to tactically avoid the bad guys, strategically picking up power-ups and conserving firepower creates an atmosphere not so far removed from the film's. Even the graphics which initially seem too chunky and Food can be collected for much unappealing get better as you progress to higher, more needed health. Look it's a hotdog. intricate levels. Good solid fun. Yum yum. One neat feature of the first game is the 'fading walls technique'. So the scenery doesn't block your view, as you steer Bruce around the various corridors, the foreground walls subtly fade away. It's much appreciated when you're playing, but to a casual observer it looks like the graphics are screwing up! x2 * QUIJOUUU MULJOUU. MEILE 1 Big weaponry is available machine-guns, explosive shotguns, stun grenades etc. This all adds to plenty of scenery destruction. You can even blow up cars, setting off neat touches like the sprinklers going off. Once inside the main building, things get a lot tougher. Expect to make your own escape route. "


"O DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER 0001850541 computer video games GIFTS NEWS PlayStation The second film's Washington airport hijack scene has spawned a Virtua Cop-style gun game. Compatible with the PlayStation light-gun too! The similarities with Virtua Cop are quite outrageous in places. The circular targets appearing over primary targets, for example. However, Die Harder has merits of its own, that prevent it being just an uninspired rip-off. Such as being able to pan the view around an area slightly larger than the screen. Also, as with the rest of this trilogy, the over-the-top gore factor is highly entertaining. You can torch people, explode them (neatly filleting the skeleton) or just pop loads of shots into them, spraying fleshy wads everywhere. This extends to the nature of the game too. Unlike Virtua Cop, you don't get penalised for shooting innocent people (good thing too, cos it's fun). If you don't murder citizens though, you get rewarded with a Good Cop Bonus, which gives you an extra section of destruction, yielding 'permanently' acquired weaponry. With the gun, this is highly entertaining (and reasonably fills that we want Virtua Cop on PS' gap). However, if you haven't got the gun (which is more likely), it's all quite frustrating, although still bearable. New York is packed with people who just get in your way. Don't worry though, you can just run \"em down, popping them like Ribena berries. Easily the best feature of Die Harder is the scenery destruction. You can destroy near enough anything. Look at those bullet holes everywhere! OOOO0G7404 The levels alternate between Central Park and the city streets.

"computer video games SPORTS GAME BY SEGA IM SEGA\" SATURN  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  STORAGE 1 CD  PRICE .99  PUBLISHED BY SEGA TEL : 0171 996 4620 OUT SEPTEMBER 1-2 PLAYERS SEGA SATURN Athlete Kings is better known as Decathlete in the arcade, where it runs off Sega ST-V technology. Question is can the Saturn version which is identical in every way out perform Olympic Games? Or Track n Field on PlayStation for that matter? ETE KINGS 3: PLEASE SELECT ATHLETE KINGS (AKA DECATHLETE) ssuming that you're languishing in some kind of Olympic frenzy at the moment, Sega may well have the perfect supplement. In athletic video game tradition, the control is essentially very basic button hammering in case you hadn't guessed — though Sega introduce a couple of interesting elements to the formula. Once you learn that AM3 have assisted the project, a couple of control innovations is the very least we could expect. The team who enabled the spectacular Sega Rally visuals on Model 2 have managed to turn around some super sharp 3D for Athlete King. So, what might appear as just another sports sim is really worth chasing after all. Two players may compete in whichever gameplay mode is chosen. Strangely though, Athlete Kings is just as enjoyable when one player goes up against the computer, as the game's arcade heritage lends it more addictive qualities. This is largely due to the variety of control methods available to master. 19 19 16 DUSK TILL DAWN POLE VAULT PRO 1m 70cm 1m 64 cm Each time an attempt is made at an event, the time of day changes.

EASY HIGH JUMP What you see within the first half hour of play here accounts for everything; with extended time being spent getting the most out of the athletes. Something similar could be said about most fighting games, except fighters have many complex moves and tactics which require months to perfect. A game which employs such simple techniques is nowhere near as rewarding. Of course the competitive element could make all the difference, except Athlete King only supports two players. Perfectly understandable in the arcade, but a little disappointing for a home game. The 3D engine is extremely slick and, for the most part, solid. A few glitches here and there is all (though watching someone's head flicker on and off is pretty disturbing!) Athlete Kings is definitely a classier title than Olympic Games, but on balance has less to offer in terms of replay value. 1. Sprint toward the bar by tapping A or C. 2.

Finally, after another five months of waiting, the first episode has been released as shareware and the whole world looks set to explode with excitement as the true successor to Doom arrives. This version is available just about everywhere on the internet for free, and features a total of eight levels six regular, one secret, and one for the boss. Shareware Doom is installed on millions of machines the world over, and Quake is going to be just as big. Want to know why? Just read about episode one, then turn the page for the complete nightmare! The Knights grab their bleeding necks! Quad Damage sorts out the evil Fiends! GREATEST GAME! THE SECRET W NIGHTMARE MODE ! WE DON'T NEED INO STINKIN MENUS ! One thing that hardcore 3D shooting fans don't want to do when they turn on Quake is fiddle with boring options to select their difficulty level and starting episode. Id Software don't either, so they've transformed these options into levels! EASY Nightmare mode is hidden in Quake, so it takes a good player to even select it! Of course, we're brilliant, so here are directions! Unlike Doom, nightmare mode is actually of a sensible difficulty the enemies are faster and more accurate than usual but do not respawn as before.

It may look like an empty room with a lava pit in the middle, but when inspected, a massive beast stands up from the lava! It then throws chunks of exploding rock at you with incredible accuracy! He can't be harmed with normal weapons, instead he must be destroyed by lowering pillars on either side of him, then treading on a touchplate to activate a lightning bolt through his head! That's actually a lot easier to do than you may think. The terrible Chthon roars as he's awakened, then attacks with exploding lava! Electrocute him three times to finish the episode. 64 "

On the first level, run behind the pillar near the start of the base... 2. Look up and shoot the TV screen to raise a hidden lift... 3.

After only a few goes on the net, you'll start to recognise regular players, making both friends and arch enemies at the same time! The advanced artificial intelligence of the enemies means that they won't stand for mistakes by others. If one monster gets hit by another, they'll normally ignore the player and go for personal revenge, even if it means jumping from bridge to bridge something we've seen happen before! 1. Here, a Fiend gets in the way of a Shambler's lightning bolt... 2. The Fiend jumps for the Shambler... 3. And bashes away at it with his claws...

Ever since I got Doom I've been looking for something with the same quality level design, imaginative enemies and fast, destructive gameplay. And here it is. It's obvious that id have spent ages on this; adding incredible light-sourcing effects to the awesome levels to make the game one of the best-looking on any system; having Trent Reznor do the excellent atmospheric background sounds and cool ambient \"music\": designing some of the best levels ever seen; perfecting the movement and inertia of the players getting just about everything perfect! The one-player game works brilliantly, but it's the multi-player mode where the fun is multiplied by hundreds! The shareware version may only be eight main levels, but there's enough in it to keep many people playing forever, while teasing everyone else just the right amount to make them get the awesome full game. There really is no way I can recommend this as much as I want to, other than saying it's the best PC title EVER, and the most enjoyable action game around. And how many video games can you name which will literally last forever? Here, two players have an axe battle right in front of us while another player tries to get three frags at the same time by firing a rocket into the bundle!

The monsters in Quake have all got more advanced artificial intelligence than any other 3D shooter, meaning that they take more cunning to kill than Doom. Once destroyed, those carrying weapons drop a backpack for you to collect which contains a few units of ammo. While you may think that the enemies introduced in episode one were tough, wait until you get further into the game and meet these guys! GRUNT VORE Almost identical to the players, only with horrible mangled zombie faces! Only take a couple of hits from even the weakest weapons. The Zombies stagger around pulling chunks of flesh from their buttocks, stomach and head, then throwing them at you. Normal weapons will take them down for about ten seconds, but they'll keep getting up unless you gib them with a rocket or grenade! GREATEST GAME! These disgusting creatures first appear at the end of episode two, crawling around like three-legged spiders. They fire magic spikes which home in on players! SCRAG ENTORCER Normally hang around gangs of Grunts, then jump at your face! As weak as they come, but very fast and quite scary. Sometimes. ROTTWEILER Wizards now The QTEST float around firing green snot trails from above. They don't take much to kill, but often come out of nowhere to attack from behind.  Only found in the base levels at the start of each episode, these armoured soldiers fire powerful lasers but only take a few good shots to kill. OGRE KNIGHT SPAWN These guys throw grenades from the other side of the room, and use a chainsaw when they get close. They can cause a lot of damage, and take quite a lot of hits before going down. The Knights aren't too much to worry about. Their swords can hurt, but they don't take long to kill, even though they patrol in big groups.  Blobby lumps of blue goo which bounce all the room very quickly, off the walls and the ceiling only to pound you in the face! When destroyed they puff up and explode! DEA SHAMBLER KNIGHT These started off in the QTEST as big Demons, but are now much smaller just bigger than the Rottweilers. They are very, very fast, and jump for your head from large distances. In close, they swipe with their singleclaw fists to try and punch your head off! The massive white yetis jog about, launching lightning bolts from their hands. When they get close, they use their huge claws to pound you in the head. They take LOADS of hits to kill and can cause instant death with a direct hit. Very nasty! Like the regular Knights, these have got a long sword for close up attacks, but can also fire an arc of magic sparkles from the other side of the room! ROTTISH > Only found in the water, in case you hadn't guessed.

Set in and around evil work through until you discover the powerful Rune at fortresses, players need to find a way inside first the end. Once all four are collected, their power sometimes through the front door, and other combines to blow open a new section revealing the slip times by sneaking in via a moat! There are gate to SHUB-NIGGURATH'S PIT! plenty of traps and puzzles to solve, but most of the time is spent hunting around for ammo and health to take on the hundreds of monsters! Se players need to and around evil ROM O THE NETHERWORLD T A very clever episode indeed. After the mass carnage of episode two, it's nice to see the enemy count drop slightly, but that doesn't mean that this is any easier to complete! Loads of tricky trap sections need to be negotiated and deadly lava needs to be avoided in order to get through these levels. Level five of this episode The Wind Tunnels is one of the most fun in the game, as the player gets sucked and blown along a series of giant pipes as they try to find a way out! THE ELDER WORLD ODEATHMATCHO As well as the three real episodes, id Software, have created some of the best Deathmatchspecific levels ever! Each one has its own theme, from loads of teleporters, to giant levels, back to tiny arenas for just two players, and even modified versions of the original three QTEST maps are included! These are the levels to play to enjoy multiplayer Quake to the max! Total confusion! This episode plays tricks with your mind, as things often aren't as they seem to begin with. For example, you may see a pool of water with a key on the other side, but jump in and you fall straight out the bottom into a pit with a Shambler! Sections of the episode are almost impossibly dark, and there are some terrifying moments with well-placed monsters. But work your way through to get the final Rune and only Shub-Niggurath awaits! GREATEST GAME! OBJECTS POV R! QUAD DAMAGE PENTAGRAM OF PROTECTION The red pentagram gives the player 666% armour for around 20 seconds, making them invincible. As with the Quad Damage, players with the power of Satan glow, making them easy to spot. LIZ The blue Quake symbol powers all of your weapons up so that they do four times as much damage as usual, meaning that most regular enemies can be gibbed with a single shotgun blast! It's easy to spot a player with Quad Damage they glow, lighting up all the walls around them! COME OR PAL. LO YOUR WORST! RING OF SHADOWS LEFATTIRE BIOSUIT The Ring of Shadows is rare in the early part of the game. It makes players invisible and therefore difficult to spot. It's just as effective, against the computer enemies, as they have difficulty aiming properly. It would be unfair to make a player totally invisible, so all that can be seen of Shadow players is a pair of floating eyeballs! The biosuit enables players to survive underwater for longer than usual, as well as making it possible to swim in poisonous slime. YOUR EYES THE RING "


"computer video games THE GUN GALLERY! ROCKET LAUNCHER It's important for a game like Quake to have a good selection of well-balanced weapons. Thankfully, id Software knew this and gave the player an excellent arsenal of guns to play with! This fires a rocket straight forward at very high speeds, doing loads of damage to whatever it hits. Absolutely useless at close range, but one of the most valuable weapons against distant enemies and Deathmatch opponents. ROM NAIL GUN AXE Usually used as the lastditch weapon when totally out of ammo, but does more damage than you might expect. It's especially good fun when using the Quad Damage power-up. The nail gun fires two lines of rapid nails but isn't as powerful as the other weapons. Also, the view shakes around quite a bit when it's being shot, which is enough to confuse stupid players. SUPER SHOTGUN --> SHOTGUN Fires slower than the regular shotgun, and uses two shells per shot, but is still very handy. A direct shot close to an enemy does masses of damage, and from long-range it has a large damage area. The standard weapon which fires at a reasonable rate, but isn't any use against big enemies. Should be upgraded as soon as possible. SUPER NAIL GUN GRENADE LAUNCHER Fires a grenade at a time which can be bounced off walls and around corners, or aimed directly at enemies to explode on impact! Much like the regular nail gun, only the nails are fired in a more concentrated stream and at a much higher rate. Can wipe out some enemies in under a second. GREATEST GAME! THUNDERBOLT SHAREWARE SECRET ! Only available in the shareware version by cheating or by using the \"Registered 1\" command in Deathmatch mode. In the later episodes, it's just about everywhere! It's also really powerful, but shouldn't be used when you're in the water you'll fry everything in there, including yourself! I'D LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT ! CEEATURES Like Doom before it, Quake is filled with blood and violence. When hit, chunks of flesh fly off enemies, blood flies around the room, and screams ring around the dungeons.

"computer video games CALLING CTHULHU ! MULTI-PLAYER MALARKEY AHOY! Does the name Shub-Niggurath ring a bell? It's probably because of Quake's roots in the Cthulhu mythos created by HP Lovecraft. Many of the creatures and level names in the game are from the popular horror writings, but where's the link? The answer lies in Sandy Peterson creator of the Call of Cthulhu Role Playing Game and one of id Software's premier designers. II. 3D shooting games like Doom and Quake are always ten times better with two players than one, and the fun levels go through the roof with any more players! In fact, setting up a two player game isn't as hard as you may think just go to any decent PC shop and buy a serial cable (otherwise known as a null-modem) for about .

ROM DEATHMATCH The Deathmatch Mode is similar to Doom's each player for him/herself, running around a level shooting everyone else for Frags (the technical term for kills). An option new to Quake is Team Deathmatch, whereby one bunch of players gangs up on another bunch, making for a real blood bath!

They took her advice. hile Virtua Fighter 2 is one of the best games ever, there are still people who aren't too keen on it. To attract more people to the game, as well as give fans a collectable update, Sega have released Virtua Fighter Kids. All of the characters and moves are the same, but the super-deformed fighters are faster than before, making it slightly easier to link moves. Also, there are plenty of new options to make the game all the more accessible to beginners. NODE SELECI   KR *GP PPPK KIDS PLAYROOMS! 21-1 STRAIGHT HAYER SELECIE MPLES IPS With a game this cute you wouldn't expect a normal sound test screen, and by gringo you don't get one! Here, the VF Kids band plays each tune to you!  as SOUND ROOM Here are all the modes available in VF Kids Arcade, Vs mode, Ranking Mode, Combo trainer, Watch Mode, Records view, Controller config, and even more options! Once the game's been completed with any character, they go and sit in the Movie Room, where it's possible to watch any of the end sequences again! Simply highlight a character so that they turn around and watch the movie play on the screen! MOVIE ROOM GREMLINS: THE NEW BATCH EXIT One of the most attractive reasons for VF fans to consider buying Virtua Fighter Kids is the awesome rendered intro sequence. It shows all of the VF Kids characters and their adult counterparts doing battle in their home areas Lau in the kitchen, Wolf in the wrestling ring, Kage in the forest. In an unfinished version of the game we saw, the fights took place on a plain black background, and the adults occasionally won, but that's now been rectified as the kids always outwit their giant relatives!  Sega Enterprises, Ltd. REVIEW DCBS "

RENDERED ENDS! 1464 535 It was slightly disappointing to get to the end of Virtua Fighter 2 only to be \"rewarded with a still image of your character and the end credits, but VF Kids sorts out this problem with some amazing rendered ending sequences! Some of the endings relate to other AM2 games Jacky driving the Daytona Hornet car, and Pai starring in a Virtua Cop movie, for example! kids This cheat makes Dural see-through, revealing that she's got a fish in her head!

We're very sad. SUPER VF PUNCHOUT KIDS! REVIEWER One of the biggest surprises about PlayStation Tekken 2 is that it has an excellent wireframe mode cheat. VF Kids boasts an identical secret option where the player gets to view the action from behind their see-through character. It's easy to find just hold the L button while selecting a character, but it's great for seeing the expressions on opponents' faces. EXCLUSIVE SO In my opinion. Virtua Fighter 2 is one of the best games ever definitely the best 3D fighting game available. Because of this. think VF Kids is excellent too not surprising considering it's an almost identical game. The cosmetic differences are instantly noticeable (big heads, colourful backdrops squeaky voices), but it takes a few goes before you notice just how different it is to play. For beginners and young children, it really is perfect the extra speed makes it more fun, and moves can be linked much more easily: plus the extra \"Kids\" mode makes special moves as simple as pressing, one button! For VF2 players, these changes may just make the game more frustrating, The fighters have a smaller range, and have had their special attacks weakened, meaning, that a new style of play needs to be learned. Personally, I find the one-player mode a bit, annoving, as complex special attacks are often less effective than rapid punches and kicks, but the two-player Vs option evens things out slightly. Even with this element of frustration, this is an excellent game, and one that can be recommended to all VF fans. and newcomers alike. 6D LOMAS Characters grimace when hit hard! Controls remain the same as usual. REVIEW Wolf looks angry when he's knocked down. Wireframe mode looks really excellent! RATING Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute. And one of the best fighting games available now with added Blant heads! "


"computer video games SHOOT EM UP BY LOBOTOMY  PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED  PC VERSION AVAILABLE TM SATURN OUT SEPTEMBER 1 PLAYER  STORAGE 1 CD  PRICE .99  PUBLISHED BY SEGA TEL : 0181 996 4600 SATURN Saturn owners have been pulling their hair out in frustration, waiting for a decent Doom game to arrive. Well, Sega fans, give the follicle tugging a rest and cop a load of EXHUMED! It's incredible! t has to be said that the Saturn back-catalogue isn't exactly overflowing with decent first person perspective shoot 'em ups. There was Deadlius (Robotica over here) and, er, well, that's about it. While the PlayStation, Jaguar and even Super NES have all received versions of id's seminal blastathon Doom, the Saturn has remained worryingly Doom free. Until now... EX-DOOMED! EGYPTIAN DOOM AND A WHOLE LOT MORE! While Exhumed offers a lot of innovative features for a 3D shoot 'em up, it still owes a large debt to Doom. The style of play, weapons-selection system and control mechanics are all essentially the same as id's classic which is no bad thing. The player views the action through the eyes of the hero, moving into the screen to negotiate mazes, blast enemies, collect power ups and solve puzzles. Weapons aim into the centre of the screen, and you target enemies simply by moving to face them. Sounds easy, right? If only! The inside of the tomb is bathed in a eerie red glow. Only kidding. It's because I was getting hit! JOHCAL PROHRESSION! Everyone knows that Doom is coming out for the Saturn, and this may lead people to think that Exhumed is merely a derivative Doom clone. Not so! Exhumed contains plenty of innovative features that lift it above Doom, and indeed any other 3D shoot 'em up. Take a look at the opposite page! See that purple triangle? That's a save game point. They only come once every few stages, meaning you have to conquer most levels WITHOUT saving! Lighting effects (left) and buckets of gore (right). What more could possibly you ask for? UNS. GHOLISAND GORE REVIEW As with any 3D shoot 'em up worth its salt, Exhumed contains more than its fair share of weapons, monsters and excessive violence, while maintaining the game's Egyptian 'theme'. So expect to see plenty of spiders, mummies and Anubis guards lurking within the games many tombs and temples, while the weaponry is a blend of the mechanical (Pistol, Machine Gun, Flame Thrower) and the supernatural (Staff of Ra, Fire Ring, Amulet of Power). As for the gore, Sega reputedly asked for the game's violence level to be stepped UP a notch on the The Anubis guard throws Arrgh! 'Orrible boney fly Saturn, resulting in every creature dying in a explosion of blue light sourced fireballs. things that buzz! Kill them blood and guts no matter which weapon you use! They look amazing! all! Kill them all! Ahem. You won't get far if you suffer from Arachnaphobia. Spiders are everywhere! 72 "


"computer games video SARRER DINOKUPAND DOWIN! SATURN By holding down the 'look' button, you can then use the d-pad to angle your view either up or down, allowing you to view areas above or below you. This was a feature that was sorely lacking in Doom, and allows for multi-level fire fights. Look up! Look down! Look everywhere! You can with Exhumed's fully three dimensional graphics engine. Good for aiming too! The intro features the voice talents of the man behind a thousands film trailers! 2) JUMP! ARTIFACTS One of the buttons allows you to hop up small ledges and leap across platforms. Because long drops are potentially fatal (unlike Doom), this adds a real sense of vertigo to high locations, as you are often required to jump from platform to platform. RANSMITTER QUE GANEWS Collect artifacts, guns and the pieces of your radio transmitter. Or look at your map. See that gap? You've got to jump that, you have! Just don't look down! EGYPTIAN DOOM AND A WHOLE LOT MORE! 3) SWI REVIEWER After jumping into water control is automatically switched to 'look' mode. The control-pad is used to point in a direction, and the B button to swim there. But watch out for man eating piranhas, as most of your weapons are ineffective underwater. Unlike Quake or Hexen, in Exhumed you can actually see through the surface of the water! Though until you get the aqua mask you can't swim far before you drown! I love Doom style games, and rate Doom 2 as one of the best games of all time. Recently the \"corridor' genre has been taken to new heights by the Duke Nukem 3D and Quake both of which I've played extensively. So for a 3D blaster to impress me, its really got to be some thing special. Which, to my surprise, Exhumed is. Surprising because I'm used to playing this type of game on a high end PC, and this is the Saturn! The speed and smoothness of the graphics is something you'd expect off a  Pentium, while the sound effects and CD audio are utterly amazing. It's been a long time since a game's sound has made me sit up and take notice, but Exhumed's crystal clear FX and, spooky Egyptian tunes really create a palpable, atmosphere all of there own. The tried and test, ed search and destroy Doom gameplay is as addictive as ever, but Lobotomy go one step fur ther by adding an RPG structure that puts as much emphasis on exploration as it does on killing. If you're a Saturn owner waiting for a 'corridor' game, and can live without a link up mode, your prayers have just been answered. 4 SLIKEAN RPA Exhumed abandons the traditional 'level to level' linear structure of most 3D blasters, opting for a Hexen-like 'hub' system instead. Several special artifacts and weapons allow you to reach new areas in old levels as progress is made deeper into the game. For instance, winged shoes allow for higher jumps, thus allowing you to reach previously inaccessible ledges on the first level, while a flame thrower is used to burn down certain wooden doors. REVIEW DALE JEVOMIS SOBEK FA RATING RATING LITY TV Not just a typical Doom clone Exhumed ranks among the best 3D Blasters around! Go and dig it up for yourself now!  "

Motorloon CRAZY CARS REVIEWER Motoroon This giant house is full of fantastic-looking scenery. There are five main characters to begin with, and three more are accessed once the \"Normal' championship is won. Each car handles totally differently from the next; for example Raptor & Raptor's UFO turns almost on the spot, and hovers over some scenery, while Vanity's motorbike has to be banked right over to get round corners. Motoriloon The first Motor Toon GP was pretty rubbish. Though there's not much different here, there's still enough to make it worth playing, but thinking about buying it is something else. For a start, the wobbly cars and over-the-top scenery make the game look pretty good, though not a lot better than when the first game was released two and a half years ago. The track design is interesting, but occasionally it seems as though more time was spent making them look fancy than was spent making them play well. But the main problem is that the car handling is very strange. The graphics probably have you expecting cars with unrealistic and fun control, but most of them handle very heavily, ruining the feel a bit. Overall, MTGP2 is worth a go and is occasionally good fun. Yet even the hidden features and excellent two player mode don't make it anything worth recommending highly. hly 60 LOMAS HIDDEN GOODIES! ONE TANK COMBAT MEITEN Drive your tank about, and shoot the other player! Can be linked up! FREE!! Players good enough to win a championship season on the Normal setting (just about everyone) get an extra three characters and five new tracks. By winning in Professional mode, two hidden games are revealed Tank Combat and Submarine-X. Though the games aren't brilliant, they're a real incentive to play the actual Motor Toon GP more. There are also bonuses gained by winning the season in Hard and Expert modes, but we don't want to give everything away just yet. TWO SUBMARINE RATING RATING O RIVAL ATTACK It's just like Battleships, only with 3D graphics! This can be linked up too! While it looks pretty, and is quite good fun to play, Motor Toon GP 2 isn't quite worth a high recommendation to anyone. 74 "

Well, its too odd for us to review. Let's hand it over to an expert. TENSION SEA BASS FISHING ................................................. ap'n Blackbeard's the name and fishing's the game. I've sailed the seven seas, braved storms more ferocious than Jaime on deadline and caught everything with a pair of gills. Anyway, CVG have given me this here Sea Bass Fishing game to review. See if it measures up to the real thing and all that. It'll be hard work playing it with no arms or legs, mind you, but I'll give it a shot anyway. Saturn Ahoy! HEAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? Cap'n Birdseye offers you the range of findus options. THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON Well, shiver me timbers, this game's got it all: from choosing your lure to the mid morning nap. Why its so realistic I can even the smell the fish! Though that could be my gammy leg stump. Anyway, in case you're not experienced in the ways of Sea Bass Fishing here's how it works. You pick up your skipper (normally at the local pub), pick your lure, sail out to your designated fishing area then wait. SEA BASS FISHING 1:36am REVIEWER LINE DEPTH 8. B. HEY. GET UP! IT'S TIME TO GET UP! TER YUURE HUNUERING HHY YOU SHOULD BUTHER EMPLOYING A HUMAIN, RENT YUU? Your skipper provides an element of social interaction to Sea Bass Fishing. Should you pick the woman? Well, at least she could cook the fish properly afterwards. CATCHING SEA BASS 45 12 lb Double Line Shock Leader Lure PER Bea TEPIH H. Well, slap me around the chops with a wet kipper if Sea Bass Fishing isn't actually a half decent game. Yes I know it's a game about fishing, but there's a lot of enjoyment to be had here. From the strategy of choosing your lure and location to the adrenalin rush of reeling in a hooked fish, Sea Bass Fishing consistently exceeds your expectations of what a fishing game would be like. The aesthetics are better than you'd expect from this type of game (particularly the polygon reeling in bits) and the atmospheric static shots and laid back jazzy music all go create a strange sense of, dare I say it, involvement! Admittedly, fish 'em ups are about as niche a market as you're going to get, but if you're even remotely interested in sport you're definitely going to get your money's worth here. In fact, I can safely say that sea Bass Fishing is without a doubt the best fishing sim I've ever played on the Saturn! Make of that what you will.

You can't turn your boat without bumping into a shoal of amberjacks or yellow tails. You can even catch dolphin! I caught a dolphin once. It got tangled in my tuna nets. Anyway, make sure you net the right fish during a competition or you'll earn some harsh words from your skipper or Captain. Your prize catch is the Sea Bass, a worthy aquatic adversary that requires real skill to catch. Why I lost both me arms bagging mine!

LTD.  TEL: N/A OUT NOW (JAP) 1 PLAYER VIDEO COMPUS GAMES REVE ITION  ere is the greatest home video game that has ever been. Good you trust me enough to carry on reading for an explanation. Super Mario 64 deserves this recognition, because it has opened our eyes and senses to a completely new gaming environment; one that brings us closer than ever to full interaction with a set of virtual worlds. Corridor games Doom, Duke Nukem, Quake; they're all awesome, and that theme with all its possibilities outside of the solo-player situation keeps getting better. Driving games; fighting games; shoot'em ups these are all developing in new and exciting ways. But SM64 is, Toasted Plumber! to its very core, a huge multi-faceted surprise waiting to unfold. The splendid, almost perfectly solid 3D environment is only the half of it. We could never have predicted the intuitive, versatile, and perfectly attentive control method given to Mario. Players feel complete Grrr...where is he? ly in touch with their virtual marionette at all times, to a degree that has never been experienced before. Where there have been criticisms, these have always, and only, been focused on the few shortcomings of Lakitu the 'camera man': sometimes he is difficult to position, and there is one occasion where he just can't see Mario at all. It's unlikely that the latter problem is deliberately placed. In spite of this ONE hiccup, the whole is a true monument in the develop ment of video games. There hasn't been anything so revolutionary a game that you just accept unconditionally as amazing since maybe arcade Virtua Racing. It's still hard to believe Super Mario 64 exists as a home game. Most people who have played Super Mario 64 have proclaimed it as the best game ever. That kind of comment doesn't come from nowhere.

But whatever your opinion of the game structure, PW64 is unquestionably magnificent. It is almost as though the design team had tried too hard to impress: the Space Shuttle taking off; ocean cruisers churning the waters; night time cityscapes; perfect star-lit skies; moun tains; with any number of dramatic routes available out to appreciate it all. But while we're judging this game primarily on its killer graphics engine, the accuracy of control and userfriendly presentation should not be taken for granted. After qualifying with at least a Bronze in each area, players can dip into whichever mission they wish in order to perfect times, and admire the relevant landscapes in more detail. This is a strength. However the possible downside is that Pilot Wings 64 is not structured in the same way (and some would argue as well as its predecessor. Most players enjoy being led from A to B, so long as there is an element of freedom between times. With Pilot Wings 64 a competent player will find every thing laid out before them after the first day. Which means no more surprises. The game might not sell machines in the same way Super Mario 64, or even future titles will. But its performance cannot fail to convince potential customers of the N64's prowess. I'd like to put CVG on record as say ing that Paradigm and Nintendo have produced another landmark title. If you already own an imported N64 the extra shell-out is worth it you will love your system even more. The majority hanging on for the official launch should have it near 386 the top of their 'wants' list also.

LTD.  TEL: N/A OUT NOW (JAP) 1 PLAYER 37 38 059 38 19704-3 These people have the patience of a CVG designer. It's true. f you're into Shogi (Japanese Chess), read Japanese proficiently, and value Yoshiharu Habu as your hero, THIS IS YOUR GAME! But we're almost certain that none of these attributes rest so easily with the person reading this, so we could justifiably end this review right by saying, 'don't buy this game'. Even if we were to recommend Shogi, there's fat chance of being able to obtain it seeing as so few importers are bringing the game into the UK. Regardless, there are a few factors which contribute to making Shogi of interest. On a purely technical note, Seta's is so far the only N64 game to use the Controller Pack, on which to save complex game data. So we can tell you that information takes approximately six seconds to transfer, with progress displayed on screen as percentages. Anyone attempting some kind of game discovers that Shogi features extensive speech samples, albeit of one lady commentator who announces all moves, and welcomes players into, then bids farewell out of each game \"arigato gozaimasu\", and so on. Which is great! (Sort of). As for why the Japanese should go after the game, playing Shogi is a popular pastime for many people. And the features included cover every possible wish list: Habu-san offers the advice of a champion, and even sets examinations to monitor the player's status, which is saved onto the Controller Pack. In addition there is a selection of real life professional Shogi players to match your wits against, with the ultimate goal of challenging the World Champion himself at the end. There are options to toggle music and speech on/off, so that extended learning sessions can be spent in silence. On fact overall the presentation is excellent, though it doesn't require an N64 to produce. There's no reason why Shogi shouldn't be a steady seller for Nintendo in Japan, though not in a major way. But any Westerner needs to be totally HI CHICKSI N64 crazy, or a closet Shogi fanatic, to chase it. PAUL DAVIES 2* W za 24 OKAY KID, GO FOR YA TILES INSANDI 5.1 LIV 09 PRINCE OF PERSIA MEGA DRIVE PLATFORM TM SUPER NINTENDO OUT NOW BY PSYGNOSIS 1 PLAYERS he original Prince of Persia, when converted onto the Super NES, was a brilliant game. It took the groundbreaking computer platformer, added superb graphics and atmospheric music, tidied up the controls, added more levels (including Hell and a god for the final boss) and turned it into a much more arcadey adventure. By comparison, Prince of Persia 2 is really quite poor. It looks worse than the original and doesn't offer anything new in terms of gameplay. The rotoscoped character animation isn't impressive anymore, and the poor response time is awful. Even the Megadrive, while lacking a good Prince of Persia conversion, doesn't need it. It has Flashback after all. Once you're used to the controls, it's an alright action/puzzle platformer.

You were boxed-in by the sides of the road, and when you slowed down the backgrounds would jerk as the film ran slower. Megarace 2 attempts to make up for all this. The cars move much more freely, with power-sliding and car-bashing thrown in. The backdrops too, look and move more convincingly, although you still can't spin the view around. Do a U-turn and you steer into the screen. The weaponary missiles and mines really don't affect the game that much. Driving and avoiding damage is the main objective.

"computer video games If you know video games well, you know Capcom. It's that simple. CVG brings you this exclusive report, direct from Capcom HQ in Japan. PlayStation Mr Shinji Mikami, Senior Planner at Capcom Co Ltd. f the key Japanese software developers, Capcom are currently enjoying a higher profile than most. Whether you spend your time playing in the arcades or at home, everyone reading this should be feeling the excitement surrounding Capcom's games. With Street Fighter III short months away, the promise of a sequel to Resident Evil, plus the big 64-bit question are Capcom developing for N64?CVG just had to find out more. Our man in Japan, Warren Harrod, visited Capcom's R&D team recently to hear news on their new games for 1996-97. We put some questions to Mr Shinji Mikami, Senior Planner of the Producer Section. * CAPCOM AND CONSOLES * video What do you think about the consoles currently available? Video If you use this system are perfect conversions of arcade games possible? SMThe general impression I have is that the Sony PlayStation's ability to display polygons is very high so it's a very good machine for creating 3D games. With regards to the Sega Saturn, compared to other hardware platforms up to now it has strong 2D capabilities. We haven't finished evaluating the whole specification of the Nintendo 64 yet, so it's not possible to say. SM-It depends on the game. For example, if we don't use it for Street Fighter Alpha 2 then it certainly isn't possible. However, having not yet tried to use it we don't know whether a 100% conversion is possible or not. In the case of a simple game then a perfect conversion is possible, but the amount of data for each game is completely different. REPRESS START ? Do Capcom have any plans to release games for the N64?

"computer video games CYBERBOTS SMNo, I don't think so. Not all titles. It depends on the game, what kind of data they're using and how much data they have. Also, it depends on where they put the CG data on the disc. It takes time to load the data so if the game has been badly programmed with the CG fragmented and stored here and there all over the disc the seek time will be high. It's much quicker to read the data all in one go. Every game is different, so you can't say that the Saturn is always going to be faster than the PlayStation.

Look at this bonus floating island up in the sky! NEMC nanco **26 This is the actual quality of the graphics! NAMCO AND SEGA'S CRAZY CABINETS! amco are getting a reputation for creating fun arcade games which don't go by the usual \"Joystick and six buttons\" cabinets. Here's what is probably the most unconventional of the lot! Namco again move away from the traditional joystick and buttons control system to create a new experience, rather than a regular game. Propcycle is controlled by sitting on a full-size bright yellow bike and peddling away! The bike's steering and angle is controlled by moving the handlebars about. In addition to the moving bike and giant screen, the cabinet has also got a fan just in front of the player which gently blows fresh air while playing the game, to give the impression of flying. The idea is to take off from the starting ledge, and fly around popping all the red balloons on the way by flying into them, collecting flashing balloons for extra time on the way. These time balloons are often hidden (there's a 20 second bonus behind the start point on the first course), and some are in excellent secret sections in a cave behind a waterfall, for example. There are two modes one of which is a simple time attack while the other is a story mode: Get up, watch a bit of plot, do a level, go to bed. There are three regular courses of increasing difficulty, each with amazing scenery. The graphics are the usual System 22 quality clear and smooth and the overall feel is similar to that of Pilot Wings 64. While it's not really the type of game that will appeal to regular arcade fans, it's excellent fun and good value as you can get quite a bit of play for . Highly recommended.

The big difference is the way that gems of the same colour made into squares will join to make one giant bonus gem. To make the Capcom link, there are four Street Fighter Alpha 2 characters and four Vampire Hunter characters to choose from, who fight in a window in the middle of the screen while you play. They fight according to how well you're doing and look extracute as super deformed characters.

GUNBLADE NY SOUL EDGE: VER II Like Alien 3: The Gun, the Gunblade NY cabinet has got giant guns fixed to the front of it, instantly meaning that it plays differently from Virtua Cop and Time Crisis. The best difference is that the player's got infinite ammo, meaning that you can just spray shots around without having to worry about reloading. Also unlike the Namco and AM2 shooting games, the player isn't walking around the level they're hanging on to the side of a Single shots explode like this! high-speed helicopter which aims roughly in the direction of the enemies. Also different is the way that the enemies don't die instantly with one hit. There are fewer targets than most other gun games, but this is because just about all of them act like bosses jumping about to avoid shots, and getting up after being gunned down, only to explode in an awesome mushroom of Model 2 flame when destroyed! A lot of the scenery is incredible to look at, with the usual Model 2 style of crisp graphics like the giant boat carrying loads of troops! The whole game is non-stop action, with loud explosions and bright flashes all over the screen all the time, giving good value for money. There are three sections to each of the levels, so there's quite a bit to see, and anyone can play it gun game experts or complete novices. Great fun, and a good challenge in either one or two player mode. This is a chip upgrade for Namco's supposed follow-up to Tekken 2. The first version is hard to find around the UK, and as such hasn't done too  well. The upgrade adds two more playable characters See FreePlay for a Soul to the game: Edge moves list.

People who'd never normally consider playing an arcade game can step up and play straight away, and on top of that, it looks great and is good fun to play. Alpine Surfer is almost the same, only it's based on snowboarding therefore, the cabinet has changed from two footholes to a half-size snowboard. The graphics are also just like Alpine Racer clear, smooth and detailed with the usual two views first-person and just behind the player. There are two different difficulty levels, each with two courses. While riding down-hill, players come across ramps and handrails which can be used to perform tricks though this doesn't seem to be beneficial to the overall score. Also, the tricks don't seem to be controllable riding straight over a jump can often cause a backflip and an excited \"Yaaaaahoooooo!\" cry. Surprisingly, it's not as much fun as Alpine Racer, and the stupid yells and lingo (\"Gnarly\", \"radical\", etc) are just annoying. Also, the games are over far too quickly for it to be worth .

CORE'S AMAZING 3D ADVENTURE GAME! This looks like a tricky jump.. Hup! Noo! I'm not going to make it! Whoah! Hanging by the finger nails, Lara pulls herself up!

Lara grabs the beam and puts her feet on the wall... Then pushes off to force the switch down! GORGEOUS GRAPHICS! NEW GAMES Tomb Raider is a very ambitious game for the 32-bit machines, as it manages to create a full 3D level in a similar way to Super Mario 64! The graphics don't suffer much from the limitations of the machines, and everything looks surprisingly solid. There are also some great special effects, like the way that everything ripples when underwater. All of the character movement is excellent, and what's more, it hasn't been motion-captured! Instead, the programmers have used key-frame animation to keep the game playing properly, rather than concentrate too much on the graphics. To tell the truth, we couldn't tell the difference Lara moves so convincingly that it just as easily could be motion-capture! As with Super Mario 64, Tomb Raider's stages are completely 3D. Because of this, Lara can stop and look around the level with a camera view just behind her head.  "

Not only can Lara hold two guns at once, she can also fire them at separate targets! hot spot Left arm Right arm This sketch shows how the aiming works: any ene mies in the hot spot will be targeted with both guns, otherwise each arm will aim at any enemies in their sector. This means that Lara can be running towards two enemies while shooting them both at the same time, one with each gun! Cool or what? SEGA SATUR Although Lara has no reason to shoot when there's nothing around, she can arm herself. With her guns raised, her movements are slightly limited but she will aim at any threat. This makes it much easier to spot enemies in the dark, and is a clever way of managing an attack system which could be really complicated. LOVELY LIGHTING! On all the versions of the game, there is excellent light-sourcing on the main character. When Lara walks into bright light, she lights up all over, but there are times that the lighting comes from the side which looks even better! CORE'S AMAZING 3D ADVENTURE GAME! Shoot the disgusting wolves quickly, before they get close. 1 If you don't, you'll be leapt upon and mauled to death! By rotating Lara around, you can appreciate how the lighting affects her. NOTE!

"1 win Twin 12 20 100% computer video games FIGHTING ADV BY DREAM FACTORY  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD COMPLETE TM PlayStation AUTUMN 96' | 1-2 PLAYERS  PUBLISHED BY SQUARE COLTS  TEL: N/A A short while ago, CVG featured an amazing new RPG from Square Final Fantasy VII. This awesome game is nothing less than expected from Square, but no surprise apart from the PlayStation angle. Tobal No.1, on the other hand, is a rare revelation! hen Tobal No.1 previewed at E3, players were surprised at the three dimensional range of movement. Instead of 3D characters operating on a 2D plane, fighters have 360° freedom in any fighting area toward, away, to the left, or right of an opponent. Jumps and crouches are executed by holding the block button, which also triggers grapple attacks. So, initial impressions led everyone to expect a complex fighting game from Square, something far removed from their usual adventure games. Well, a lot has changed since then. TM O SQUARE O DREAM FACTORY O BIRD STUDIO 16 win G FIGHTING SYSTEM THE SQUARE UMBRELLA You might be surprised to learn that Tobal No.1 is being developed by a team called Dream Factory, working alongside design agency Bird Studio. Square's involvement is as producer and publisher of the game. We mentioned this before, and the rumours still stand, that some members of the Tekken and Virtua Fighter teams have been involved with the project. Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball Z, penned the artwork before CG artists transposed it. GANOTHER DIMENSION Four buttons are used command the fighting: High, Middle, Low attacks, plus Guard (Triangle, Square, Cross, and R1 respectively). When Guard is not being used, the direction buttons walk the fighter around up moves away from, and down moves toward the screen. In this mode the attack buttons affect punches and kicks only. By holding Block, pressing up jumps, and down crouches. Pushing A high attack, which away from the takes the form of a kick. opponent leans back. To grab an opponent, hold towards plus the mid attack button. Once inside of a grapple, players may choose to elbow, knee, or throw their foe around. It's all Powerful sweeps typify very clever! low level attacks. Woosh! REVOLUTIONARY NEW STRATEGY EXPLORATION FIGHTER WEN GAMES Another area of the game places characters in a dungeon setting, where they battle enemies using combat techniques learned in the isolated arenas. Here players go in search of crystals a valuable high energy mineral which will help restore the balance of power on planet Tobal. We haven't played these sections yet, so we're looking forward to talking about this in more detail next month. So far we know there are potions and food as health pick ups. And huge rolling boulders, deep pits, electric walls, and so on as hazards. A force field protects the crys tal, preventing central character Chuji Wu from getting near.

"computer Video games REAL-LIFE PILOT WINGS ilot Wings 64 is so awesome! It's just like the real thing! But how do we know? Cos we packed off the resident office guinea pig Dave Kelsall to sample the delights of «real life PilotWings», that's how! sport that I'll definitely be taking up. Though hot-air ballooning has never made it into a PilotWings game (probably due to the fact that they're only semi-steerable) they offer an extremely beautiful and relaxing form of flight (you've also got a pilot to worry about the flying!). Thunder & Colt and Cameron balloons, one the worlds largest hot-air balloon manufacturers were the target of my next blagfest as prepared for a trip in a craft that gave man his first genuine flight in 1783. From launch to landing, where its tradition to get a nice NASA glass of champers, the flight was awesome and. because ballooning is very much a complete experience, most operators encourage you to help prepare and then pack away the balloon afterwards. And don't be put off by the fact that you're standing in a laundry basket under a bag of hot air at 3,000 feet, because you're at no greater risk than the retrieve crew that follow in a vehicle below! As you can probably gather I've got pretty addicted to this flying lark and YES I'd certainly say that PW 64 is an accurate simulation of the feeling you experience when airbourne! Trying it out for real won't be everyones cup of tea, but I've included a few numbers for anyone interested. Nass B Bay Paragliding is one of the simplest forms of flight in the world and originated about ten years ago in the ski resorts of the Alps. Parachute enthusiasts found ways of gliding down the slopes in a similar fashion to hang-gliders and with the availability of modern materials the sport of paragliding was born. Now, to fully appreciate the pleasures of paragliding it's definitely recommended that you spend USA a weekend away at a specialist training centre where the instructors wean their students from theory to the hillside, where you move further up a hill depending on your ability. As you progress into the sport you are taught new techniques that will have you staying aloft for hours! Wahey! Just like Pilotwings! (See PARAMANIA in that ORANGE box over there!). Unfortunately deadline restrictions meant that I had to go for the slightly cheaper \"getting dragged into the air by a tow cable on a racecourse option\". After my 15th attempt to successfully fall onto a mat in the correct manner for landing, and a bit of theory, I was finally ready. With the chute laid out behind me I started to run and within seconds the cable had launched me into the air. A couple of minutes later and I was flying. The adrenaline rush was unique, and apart from hang-gliding, is possibly the nearest sensation you could possibly get to flying. In the comfortable harness I just relaxed and took in the view as I gently tugged at the ropes to stear the craft around the sky. Unfortunately, on landing I managed to plough my way through a plastic showjumping fence but undeterred I prepared for another two flights that made me confident that paragliding (one of Europe's most popular outdoor pursuits) is a USEFUL NUMBERS PARAMANIA (01544) 350 375 Learn the thrills of paragliding with the experts, over a fun packed weekend in Spain or the Welsh Borders.

Such is the N64 craze in Japan at the moment, that supplies of coloured joypads are running short, even though there aren't any games that need more than one pad yet! Nintendo have teamed up with Seta (who did Shogi) to produce an N64 arcade board. Sega are going use the miniature 8 megabit RAM Toshiba memory card (reported in CVG #175) with Saturn VF3. Tekken 3 on PlayStation is going to need a hardware add-on. Electronics Boutique are going to sell PlayStations for a special trade-in offer of $99. They'll take 10 NES carts, 13 Megadrive games or five Saturn discs. A similar deal is set to take place over here. Enix (makers of the Dragon Quest series) are developing an RPG for Saturn. They've also got their first N64 project lined up Wonder Project J2. Datel are going to release a 3 1/2 inch disk drive for the PS. Each disk stores the same as a memory card (15 games). But obviously a disk is cheaper. SOJ are going to ban all naughty games on Saturn possibly to make it more suitable for younger users.  Peter Molyneux (creator of Populous, Theme Park and Syndicate), unhappy with EA's control of his company, Bullfrog, could be leaving to start a whole new one from scratch. Mr Mizuguchi has left AM3 to form his own division, AMS. His first game is based around European touring cars. SNK and Sega are abandoning the Twin Advanced Rom System.

"computer video games VIDEOIJAMING Dave Kebally Retro Computer Cabins WIN! A NINTENDO DONKEY KONG 64 CARTRIDGE! No...sorry not for the Nintendo 64, but a Nintendo cartridge for the Commodore 64! This neat little cart plays a great game of Donkey Kong even though there aren't the full four arcade levels. To win it just answer this question: Q: Mario has only ever played the 'BAD GUY' once! Which game was it? Send your entries to \"DONKEY KONG CABIN COMPO\" at the usual address. s N64 Mario fever grips the office I decided to take time out and dig up a few of my old favourite platformers... nothing to do with the fact that Paul Davies commandeered my Nintendo for back-up purposes in case his ever went wrong! Oh no... why waste such technology on an old fart like the MicroGoblin, who still prefers his games to come with a nice bit of sprite flicker, eh? Then I was a young lad my parents used to load up all the grannies and my sister into a big packing crate and ship us off for our annual trip to 4 Llandudno in Wales. It's a tradition that we still carry out today... It's still tradition that I blow all my money down the GOLDEN GOOSE arcade within the first five hours of getting there! And to this day I still have the fondest memories for an ATARI arcade machine called PacLand. It's played as a horizontally Yahoooo! scrolling platform game (a It's a me... Wally Weak! unique departure from most ...innit? Pac games) where you, as the hero, must transport little fairies that have become lost in PacLand back to the door that leads to Fairyland! As you traverse through the levels your old enemys Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde are all driving around in dinky little cars, flying planes or riding weird little UFOs in their attempt to hinder your progress. Only when you come across a Power Pill can you reverse rolls and gobble them all up for a hefty bonus. Pac can also interact with the scenery to get some brilliant secret bonuses-on level one moving the fire hydrant rewards you with a firehat thing that lets you collect the mini ghosts dropped from the planes, or pushing a log in the woods releases a load of balloons that can be collected for bonus points. When Pac finally reaches Fairyland he releases his fairy and is given a pair of magic flying boots as a reward by their Queen. Then begins a mad dash home where his wife and baby are waiting to congratulate him. It's these little touches combined with the wonderful cartoon graphics that make PacLand so appealing and the difficulty level is set I'm not kidding right, Paul Davies in such a way that you are constantly lives in that house! He does. being tested on your joystick dexterity and arcade skills. I was lucky enough to pick up the original cabinet (see below) but you can also experience PacLand via the excellent C64 version released by Quicksilva in 1988, the nearly arcade perfect PC Engine version or the up and coming totally perfect PlayStation version (under the NAMCO arcade classics label). Hello, I'm the old CVG This month's small platformer taster CHAMP, apparently! 195 wouldn't be complete without at least mentioning a few of the many awesome Mario games. He began his debut way back in 1980 with Donkey Kong followed closely by DK jr, DK 3 and the rather unsuccessful DK IV that never made mass circulation due to it being rather similar to the original. From this he bounced back in a coin-op called Mario Bros. It's a one or two-player game in which the brothers run around a series of platformed screens attempting to clear it of the usual collection of turtles, flies, crabs and snowmen, which emerge from the pipes. First of all the baddies are punched by jumping at them from a platform below, you then jump up to their level and kick em in. The good thing about all these games are that Nintendo licensed them out onto various formats. The early Mario games can be found on the C64, Spectrum, Intellivision, Collecovision and more! It wasn't until Super Mario Brothers that Nintendo fully realised the fact that Mario would play a big part in selling their machines! Now... I shouldn't really be saying this cos i think it was banned, but Rainbow Arts did a great little Super Mario Bros variant on the C64 and Amiga called The Great Giana Sisters. The story goes that one night Giana from Milano was fast asleep when she had a dream and found herself in a weird and wonderful 32 level world in search of a giant magical diamond! The game is packed full of surprise bonus blocks and treasure rooms and as you can hopefully see from the screenshot it's very much in the mould of the Mario games. If your lucky enough to find a copy you should snap it up... and send it to me cos I've been after it for years! Though Space Panic was officially the first ever platformer, the one that most people will remember is Manic Miner by Matthew Smith on the Spectrum. It was later released onto nearly every machine going due to its incredibly well thought out and devious screens. The object of the game was to guide miner Willy through 20 caverns collecting objects that would open his exit to the next more difficult cavThe Great Giana Sisters. I wonder ern. Needless to say this is an if they fancied the Mario brothers? absolute classic and comes highly recommended along with its sequel Jet Set Willy (though I found the latter infuriating due to the fact that one small error would lead to the dreaded multiple deaths bug!). The mining theme was always popular with platform games and provided the storyline and setting to one of my all-time favourites—Wanted: Monty Mole. I won't bore you with the storyline except to say that Arthur Scargill's caricature appeared later on, thus getting the game some excellent TV and press coverage during the height of the miners strike. The difference between Monty and Willy is that Monty requires a certain degree of luck to get past the various crushers and the infuriating mine cart sequence. The bright bold graphics and animation of all the characters is superb and rather than hinder the game, the frustrating difficulty of the later levels still keeps me coming back for more. I'm going to round off with perhaps one of the rudest and funniest platformers ever. Chan and Monty Mole. Time for a comeback? Chan is very much in the Mario Bros mould with loads of secret screens and bonuses to be discovered as well as a hero who farts to kill off the baddies. Add the fact that you have to dodge deadly poo and kick your buddy whilst he's peeing in the bushes, this PC Engine title is a MUST HAVE. Aw gawd!!! I've got tons left you know... like Miner 2049'er and Bounty Bob Strikes Back, Stop the Express, Impossible Mission (AWESOME), Kangaroo, Pitfall... I'll just have to do another platform special. Until then... Have a look out for the Giana Sisters would ya. Ta. ssssssssssssss nnnn **CabinRetrom Jarndo Chan and Chan BUY YOUR OWN CLASSIC ARCADE MACHINE!!!

"ames FREEPLAY FAN o much of our mailbag received each month is full of opinions about which machine is better than another, and for so many reasons. We wondered if it was about time to open a forum for this kind of banter. So this is the beginning of an answer: two pages full of the pros and further pros of each individual game system. This month we requested the opinions of the 'pros' people who work for the UK's biggest selling games magazines deliberately keeping ourselves out of the argument, you see. Read what they have to say, and form an opinion. If this opinion starts burning a hole in your head, let it out. Send it here. Mailbag will continue in the main magazine, but we know this subject is a law unto itself. VV LET'S PLAYSTATION! TO BE THIS GOOD TAKES AGES ATM SEGA\" SATURN FREEPLAY FAN The Sony PlayStation... let's be honest, it's excellent! Why? Well how many machines not only offer you games with all the quality graphics, CD sound and sheer playability of an arcade TM machine? Come up with a few names PlayStation have you? Okay, now tell me how many of those ALSO have about a billion games either scheduled for release before 1997 or at least well into development? Exactly! Never mind your 'wonder machine' Nintendo 64 or second runner Saturn, how about owning a console that has incredible games here and now? If there's one thing that was quite obvious from all of the recent E3 show reports, it's that pretty much every game developer and publisher has one machine foremost in their mind at the moment yes, it's your favourite and mine, the PlayStation. Considering the machine hasn't even celebrated its first birthday in the UK and yet we've already been privy to such wonders as Tekken and the forthcoming Tekken 2, Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer Revolution, WipEout and the imminent WipEout 2097, it's really becoming very hard to bring the machine down. Ladies and gentlemen, get realistic get into the PlayStation!  MATT BROUGHTON DEPUTY EDITOR; MEAN MACHINES PLAYSTATION (OUT SOON!) My loyalty lies with Sega, and I'll tell you why. Firstly, the Saturn is an incredible piece of hardware: Developers are only just starting to maximise the incredible potential of it! As the Sega Graphics Libraries continue to develop, we can expect to see even more impressive 3D routines in the future. A conversion of VF3 using the new Sega 8 meg memory cartridge I can't wait! What's more, Saturn is the undisputed king of 2D games: Capcom have admitted they CAN'T do Marvel Super Heroes PEU 4,06063 FNSS START on PlayStation, and there's no way Sony's machine could match Guardian Heroes. Secondly, Sega INFINITY COUNTER coin-ops will always be the exclusive property of Sega machines. Even the most loyal Sony or Nintendo fan cannot deny that AM2 are among the finest programming videogame creators around, while AM3 Marvel Super (Manx T), Treasure (Guardian Heroes havoc! Heroes), Team Andromeda (Panzer Dragoon Zwei), Sonic Team (NIGHTS) and Climax (Dark 38 Saviour) all programme exclusively for Sega. Wipeout has come to the Saturn, Ridge Racer and Tekken 2 may well come to the Saturn, but VF2, Virtua Cop, Daytona, Sega Rally et al will NEVER appear on PlayStation or N64. Finally, Sega culture to claim you are a Sega fan says NIGHTS one of the greatest something very specific about games ever, only on Saturn! your game tastes. Sega are cool. They have been and always will be. Mario 64 may be a more amazing game than NIGHTS technically, but there's no debate as to which is cooler. And there's certainly no debate as to which is the coolest system. Crash Bandicoot he's bandicool!! Tekken 2it's truly awesome!!!

"computer Video games NINTENDO POWER! NINTENDO 64 90 Mario 64 the best video game ever! Waverace 64 fingers crossed, this will amaze too. TIME 0009032 Consider Nintendo's back catalogue of Super NES games: Super Mario World, Legend of Zelda, Super Metroid, StarFox, Pilot Wings, F-Zero, Donkey Kong Country, Super Mario Kart, Yoshi Island... most of these with incredible sequels on N64 here and now, or planned for the near future. These represent the best that video games have to offer. And, of course, I would venture that they are THE best. I can think of no Nintendo game not even the much underrated Virtual Boy titles Galactic Pinball and Tele-Ro-Boxerthat is not a beacon in the field of video games. Even Game Boy is home to some of the all-time greatest exploits of such characters as Zelda, Metroid, and of course Mario. In contrast to the relatively shallow action games which characterise Sega and Sony's systems, Nintendo has always been home to the greatest adventures, and most in-depth racing games ever devised. For a while, fans have been concerned that Nintendo had been left behind in the battle for the greatest hardware but Silicon Graphics helped change all that. So now, not only do we have the greatest possible imaginations working toward producing phenomenal games, but the best possible technology to support them. And, speaking of support, you know that Nintendo won't abandon their hardware until it is well and truly time to lead the industry forward one whole step. DAVID UPCHURCH EDITOR; NINTENDO MAGAZINE SYSTEM 21 74 km/h 253 SPEED PHOTO SEA LEVEL  A shot of breathtaking flight action, taken from Pilot Wings 64. PC FOREVER OLD FATHER TIME ROM FREEPLAY FAN id software's Quake sums up to me why the PC could well be the ultimate videogames platform and will probably remain in that position years after the Nintendo 64 is but a distant memory. Put in simple terms, it's all down to expandability. Quake looks, sounds and plays brilliantly as a one-player experience. In fact, in single-player mode alone I rank it alongside (if not slightly above) Super Mario 64. But the PC is the future because of networking. Sure, one-on-one PlayStation Doom was great, but PC Quake allows sixteen players from across the world to battle it out over the Internet... all for the price of a local phone call. And in its shareware incarQuake from id Software, nation (another better than Super Mario 64? great PC institution), this experience is free. You can even reprogram the -CREUR entire game. The PC is a master of adaptability and so is Quake. The game has its own map editors and programming language, meaning you can design your own game world, change all of the monsters, 100 B create your own new Net play is the only way to weapons... heck, you can play Duke Nukem, okay!!! even redefine the whole objective of the game to your own specifications! The current batch of consoles would be hard pushed to replicate the single-player Quake experience and for the time being, the PC is the only platform truly equipped for cheap, multinational, multiplayer action. And for me, that's the future of games. Geoff Grammond's F1 GP2. RICH LEADBETTER A long time coming, BUT... EDITOR; MAXIMUM As anyone who knows me will tell you I'm a bit of an owd git. I've been in this industry too long and genuinely think I have seen it all. Well, that's what I used to think. I've had my opinions seriously revised lately with the arrival of a couple of titles. In the first instance, there is NIGHTS on Sega's tragically underrated dyn* 76 **31 Saturn. Not only does it look quite unlike anything previously seen, but it plays in a completely new and wholly unique way. NIGHTS may just have invented a whole new genre for itself it's not many games you can say that about. And then there's the small matter of Super Mario 64. How can I begin to describe a game that is so fundamentally radical in every way? I'd say SM64 has gone a stage further than NIGHTS in redefining the boundaries of what is possible in a game. I cannot do justice to the Mario experience in such a short space, it has to be seen moving and played to fully appreciate the groundbreaking importance of this title. No self respecting gamer will want to be without Mario 64 or NIGHTS. In these two titles, Sega and Nintendo have demonstrated their continuing dedication to the advancement of gaming something Sony has yet to do. ANDY MCVITTIE PUBLISHER; EMAP IMAGES (EX-EDITOR OF NMS) OH YEAH! OH YEAH! As you can tell, people in this place are every bit as self opinionated as any dedicated gamesplayer.

Now that the shareware version is available to everyone for free, we decided it would be worth giving you some basic info on where to play Quake on the internet, and how to configure the game just how you want it. Please note that some of these things (like the crosshair) will only work on shareware version 1.00 and above.

You can play for fun, messing about and enjoying yourself; or you can take it too seriously, work out strategies and not have any fun. This technique guide is for sad people who want to do the latter. 100 METRES Though the power bar fills very easily, it's worth going flat out just before the jump to make totally sure that you get the maximum speed. To make timing the jump easier, count ten steps from the beginning. If you can clear 2.70 before the third attempt, you'll be able to move the bar off the top of the posts to 2.99, making mega records possible. 24.61m R Don't bother looking at the screen. Concentrate totally on speed and don't bother dipping for the line as it isn't worth losing your concentration.

This should give you an, angle of around 45 degrees. Again. Don't start running at full speed right at the start or you'll tire by the jump. Instead, tap slowly until you get going, then go flat out as you reach the board. Then hold the jump button to get an angle of around 45 degrees.

Don't try holding the button as long as the other throwing events or you'll just chuck the discus a few metres. If the discus appears to be going out of the scoring area, it can be curled back by tapping either the left or right run button to bend it to that side. HIGH SCORES PLEASE! As with the Long Jump, don't go too fast at the start of the run up. Press the button as you land for each jump, and keep tapping away all the Remember that the time.

Watch the direction indicator until it turns orange, then throw it the next time around. It's also possible to get quite a big distance by releasing the hammer when the indicator is yellow, you know. The best angle is around 45 degrees again. As with the discus, it's possible to curve the line of the hammer by tapping either run button when it's in the air. Simply go as fast as possible, but always concentrate on timing the jumps.

We also went on to tell you how, within months of his employment, he earned himself a job on a US games mag in sunny LA. The response to this fairytale has been incredible. No fanzines have come in this month! Perhaps you're all hard at work on your own awesome publications. Well whatever, here's another excellent fanzine which granted its owner work at this very company. He's since earned massive respect for his efforts and was even selected to contribute to our Freeplay Fan page this month. Can you guess which one he is. Capcom Fanzine is clearly the work of a true fan of the legendary software house. Packed with news, previews, reviews, historical features and moves guides, it's extremely informative, wellpresented and clearly demonstrates its author's abilities. What's more, it made them a fair bit of money too! If this hasn't got you buzzing with the idea of putting together your own fan magazine, goodness knows what will.
