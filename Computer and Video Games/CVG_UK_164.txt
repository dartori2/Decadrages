"CVG NEWS connected After the relatively disappointing Winter CES show, the whole video games industry was fully geared up and ready to rock at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in sunny Los Angeles, or E3 to us bods who can't handle long phrases when we're jetlagged. Naturally, we were there. It's not all work, work, work you know... inere's no doubt that the E3 show was a resounding success, with over 40,000 visitors over the three days there's even talk of a European version to be staged in London. However, while it was a chance for companies to showcase, as much as anything, their new technology developments, 16-bit was still the prevailing force. However, this looks like being the last charge for the old warhorses -expect them to be the minority next time around. ULTRA SLIPS AGAIN So do you want the good news or the bad? The bad? Well, you little gluttons for punishment, you, read on. But don't blame us if it makes you cry though... AP OK, so the bad news. Nintendo have announced further delays to their cartridgebased Ultra 64 games system. The proposed release dates are December 1 in Japan and April for the USA and UK although it could slip further into the year. What's going on? Don't Nintendo love us any more? But on a slightly more positive note Nintendo have confirmed that the Ultra 64 chip itself is designed, prototyped, tested and ready to be produced. Along with that they have also unveiled a preliminary design for the machine which can only be described as being 'very Nintendo'. Aside from that though, they confirmed that they're still on-course for meeting their muchtouted $249 price tag, and from their bullishness at E3, nobody doubts that they'll succeed. The software line-up still remains unchanged, with yet more third-party developers shelling out the rumoured $250,000 for the full development kit. One thing has changed though, with Killer Instinct coming to the SNES, Rare are already crashing their way through the sequel, which could well be out in the arcades at the same time as the machine is launched in Japan.

"NEWS CVG Connected SATURN BURN:CYCLE FOR SATURN LAUNCHED! Philips much-acclaimed, and highly excellent futuristic adventure Burn:Cycle is due to hit the Saturn later this year. The game, which received a huge score when we reviewed the CD-i version is one of the most innovative CDbased adventures to surface in a long time. Currently it stands as one of the best-selling CD-i titles, and who's to say it won't have similar success on the Saturn when it appears again at the end of the year? ACCLAIM GEAR UP FOR SUMME SEGA SATU The Acclaim bandwagon continues to roll on undaunted by the loss of Mortal Kombat 3. In fact they're spreading their corporate wings to cover almost every format you can think of. Sega, in a fit of total marketing genius, surprised the entire American public along with most of the stores, by releasing the Saturn on May 11 without telling anyone. A rumoured 30,000 machines were available in the first week with another 100,000 allegedly following by the end of the month. Whether or not this was a panic measure to steal the limelight from Sony couldn't be confirmed, but one rumour flying around was that a Sega Exec was quoted as saying the average pricetag of $399 was too low and it could even increase by the end of the year. What with the Yen being so strong at the moment, it doesn't bode well for the potential UK price. As for the machine's release date in Britain, Sega are aiming to launch their 32-bitter on September 9 which they've labelled Saturnday. Comedy may not be on the cards, but gamstrels everywhere at least know how long they've got to save up for now. But as for the software talk about low-key! Considering the Saturn had just been launched, it accounted for only about 10% of Sega's stand and to top that there was only one new title! The one shining light which almost made up for the poor showing came in the form of the Saturn version of Virtua Cop. Without beating about the bush too much it's flippin' ace! Everything about the game is a spot-on conversion from the original arcade game. It runs at the same speed, the frame-rate's just as smooth and all the sounds are ripped straight from the coin-op. BATMAN FOREVER The game was still in the very early stages of development when we featured it last issue, but it's come a long way since then. Most of the enemy characters have been added, and Robin's in there as well, although for some reason he's in the dodgy Sixties Burt Ward outfit. Expect to the see the game in the Autumn on (deep breath) Mega Drive, SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear, 32x, Saturn, PlayStation and PC CD-ROM. The only sore point is the lack of a UK release date, but the compensating factor is that Sega are also producing light guns which will work with the game. Aside from that the only other \"treat' on show was the single-character Virtua Fighter 2 demo which features Pai going through her paces. It's impressively fast and spot-on to the coin-op, but we'll be convinced when we see it running with a full background, another character, music, sound effects, game logic... Finally, not that we're ones to gossip, but a little birdy whispered in our ear that, allegedly, Sega Of America have given up on the 32X. This is only a rumour, so don't read anything into it if you don't want to. REVOLUTION X This is a newie. Acclaim have signed the rights to this rather surreal coin-op which managed to confound arcadesters the world over. It's destined to appear on most 16-bit formats plus Saturn, PlayStation and PC CD-ROM. Look out for it later this year. "


"CVG NEWS Connected connected IT'S RIDGE RACER ISN'T IT? PLAYSTATION PRICE ANNOUNCED Screamer. Doesn't sound much like a race game, does it let alone one on the PC? In fact, that's what it is and a totally superb one to boot. Virgin, who are releasing it, had wisely hooked it up to a steering wheel controller to deliver maximum impact. We've got no doubt it's superb, but there's a little dissenting voice chattering away at the back of our communal mind... It's a bit like Ridge Racer, isn't it. In fact, it's a hell of a lot like Ridge Racer. Which isn't a bad thing at all, unless Namco decide that they want to release their race game on PC, at which point things could get a little messy. In a two-fingered response to new-rivals Sega's surprise launch of the Saturn in the States, Sony announced that the US price for the PlayStation would be some $100 less than the new Sega machine-clocking in at just $299. The worry for Sega must be that the PlayStation is going to be much closer to the Ultra 64 in price than the Saturn, and that when Nintendo get into gear that's where the market is going to form. Which leaves Sega with the dilemma of taking a massive hit on the Saturn's price, or really doing a number on the marketing, DONKEY KONG TAKES KONG A BIT OUT OF COUNTRY 2 HAME BOY UNVEILED Donkey Kong Land, which Nintendo finally put the followup to their monster hit Donkey Kong Country on show and met with mixed reactions. There's nothing wrong with the game, it's just that it looks a bit like they could have called it DKC: The Lost Levels. It's very similar to its predecessor, although a number of new gameplay devices have been included to spice it up. Another new addition is Dixie Kong, Diddy's chimp girlfriend, which gives the game a similar two-player and tag-mode option to the previous one. RAYMAN'S REVUE will be Nintendo's biggest Game Boy title of the year, is still not ready to hit the shelves. However, there is a silver lining to this particularly dark and gloomy cloud and that is it looks like it could even steal Mario World's crown as the best Game Boy platform game ever. Time will tell, but we should have more pics and info in the next El few weeks. Ubi-Soft's much-delayed Rayman plat former finally emerged from the shadows to dominate most of their stand at E3. He's gone from being tied solely to the Atari Jaguar to emerge on Sony's PlayStation and Sega's Saturn too with each version doing their respective machine justice. As for the game itself, it mixes just about every platform cliche imaginable, but with great visuals and sound. Time will tell if it's enough to prevent Rayman sliding into the little hole where the failed platform stars live. 8 "

"NEWS CVG Connected EA SPORTS TARGET 32-BIT In a move which will have millions of EA Sports fans breathing a collective sigh of relief, Electronic Arts have unveiled a PlayStation conversion of their excellent 3DO FIFA Soccer as well as an allnew version of the classic EA Hockey. FIFA promises to be an almost straight conversion from the 3DO incarnation. The main differences will be in the player graphics, which are more detailed and just generally look better close up. First impressions put it above the forthcoming Konami soccer game, but that's still only very early so it's a bit unfair of us to compare the two. However, with PlayStation International Superstar Soccer due, anything could happen. Meanwhile, EA Hockey is quite clearly an attempt to marry the superb playability of the 16-bit versions with the graphical power afforded by modern systems. The results speak for themselves. Providing EA can flash things up enough, this is a sure-fire hit. Elsewhere in EAworld, Origin are producing a PlayStation version of their superb space opera Wing Commander III. This comes at exactly the same time as they reveal plans for the fourth game in the series. It will see the return of the most popular characters from the game, including Mark Hamil as Christopher Blair, although producer Chris Robots is aiming to integrate the FMV sequences more with the missions So your flying skills determine what happens next in the plot. The missions themselves will also be updated, with you selecting multiple wingmen and generally having to think about things a bit more rather than simply getting into scraps with the Kilrathi. Wing Commander IV: The Price Of Freedom is due to hit at the end of the year. We'll keep you posted on its progress and any conversion news. M2, BRUTUS? 3DO have already stolen a major march over Sony and Sega simply by being the first company to put a 32bit console on the shelves, and now there's finally full-on news and information about their next step the eagerly awaited M2 accelerator. The machine, as you would imag. ine, is purely designed to make everything else look instantly dated. There's no denying its power; from the graphic hardware to the sheer capability of the 64-bit processor at its heart. After seeing several demos running we're more than convinced by its capability to, technically at least, eclipse most other consoles, but the question of what the software support will be like still remains. In the mean time, here are a few shots of some real-time graphical demos that we've managed to procure. These aren't so much designed to create a visual 'wow' factor, but to show just what kind of special effects the machine is going to be capable of creating through its operating system. With all this technology they draw cows. Still the one on the bottom shows the graphic smoothing capabilities. This dinosaur isn't that pretty, but he's drawn in real-time and made up from a humungous number of polygons. Another demonstration of M2's real-time graphics capabilities. We reckon it could easily reproduce Virtua Fighter 2. It's that damn cow again. She's here to show off one of the built-in special effects. Although \"fog' isn't the best. A close-up of dinosaur vs bird. Only a demo, though, 'cos it would be pretty weird if it was a real game. "

They've done more to prolong the life of the market than any other company. Constantly innovating, creating new ways to overcome hardware limitations and then getting Rare to develop a SNES version of one of the most talked about coin-ops of the last 12 months. But Killer Instinct on a 16-bit console? Isn't it supposed to be the flagship for the Ultra 64? Wasn't it produced on an SGI machine then running on a 32-bit coin-op? Shurely shome mishtake here? It's all true though. Nintendo's announcement that they were converting the game was met with, quite fairly, general disbelief. But having now played the game we can tell you that this is one of the most remarkable carts ever produced for a 16-bit machine. The finished game will clock in at 32-Mbits, which doesn't sound too much considering the sheer volume of graphics which has to be crammed in. However, there's talk of an innovative data compression chip being built in to the cartridge which could allow as much as 64-Mbits of data to be stored. If that turns out to be the case and it works, it looks like it could well be a trial run for the system that will be used  GAME BY RARE CONTACT NINTENDO (01329 822565) FOR INFORMATION 14 "

All the original SGI images have been used in the game with the animation being as fluid as ever. Their size is impressive too.

They finally unveiled their Jaguar VR kit which, despite rumours to the contrary, is actually dead good. On show for it was a 3D version of the coin-op classic Missile Command. The game itself works perfectly with the VR system, clearly demonstrating that Atari's VR helmet will be one of the most responsive on the market. Shame they had to give out a pic that looks like something out of Country Living. After the disaster that was the Game & Watch cartridge, Nintendo have unveiled four superb twin-game Arcade conversion carts. The pairings are Missile Command/Asteroids, Galaga/Galaxians, Defender/Joust and Centipede/Millipede. These should go down a storm. KICKING UP A STORM 123456789 Novastorm may have received mixed reviews all round on PC and Mega-CD, but that hasn't deterred Psygnosis from developing a PlayStation version. They promise us that the game will be a lot more interactive, as well as better looking. Let's hope so, eh? LANDS OF LORE 2 DEBUTS clied After much dallying Virgin finally had something to show on the forthcoming sequel to Lands Of Lore. The follow-up looks like a decidedly better prospect, with awesome visuals and plenty of involving adventure gameplay. BIG BOYS STEP One of the biggest corporate names strutting their stuff at the show was 20th Century Fox. Considering their massiveness in the entertainment market, it's quite amazing that they haven't made an impact in the videogames side of things. This time out for them it's multimedia entertainment leading on the comedy package 'The Comedians' (one of whom is Whoopi ). 16 "


"NEWS CVG connected MORE PLAYSTATION FOOTY STREETFIGHTER FOR GAME BOY START Psygnosis are the latest software company to take a concerted shot at producing a decent footy game and from what we've seen they look like they're going about the right way. PowerSports Soccer boasts the most realistic-looking footballers we've seen in any footy game, but they won't count for squat if they don't get the playability right. Here's hoping. FINALLY, BLADE RUNNER — THE GAME! This was originally a CVG April Fool several years ago. Remarkably, though, Nintendo are finally bringing out a version for the Game Boy. The graphics are large and well defined, although the tricky bit will be getting the controls to work with just two buttons. It's been hailed as the greatest licence that never was, but finally someone has got around to signing the rights to Ridley Scott's cinematic masterpiece Blade Runner. The kids with the golden cheque book are Virgin Interactive Entertainment, who've handed the job over to crack programming outfit Westwood studios. But don't hold your breath as the game isn't due for release until late in 1996. VIRGIN GO ACONQUERING Virgin are hoping to emulate the massive success they had with Dune 2 with Westwood Studios' latest strategy game Command And Conquer. It features a similar sort of interface and strategic gameplay, interspersed with animations of sodding great explosions. It's due this summer and we're actually quite looking forward to it. EVEN MORE MYST The latest chapter in the story of the much-travelled adventure Myst is that Psygnosis are now responsible for the PlayStation version. We just wish they'd hurry up and get on with Myst 2. "


"CVG REVIEW 00015000  Boss me now nacl 000 SONICS PLAYSTATION Shoot-'em-up Sony  PlayStation Out Now No other versions planned No other versions available 200 This is the first boss you fight. He might look fairly huge, but there are loads of regu. lar enemies not much smaller. It may look like a standardy, scrolly type of a blast fest kids, but when Gunner's Heaven is incoming on Sony's new toy, it's cataclysmic territory! 0002060D couple of years ago, the Mega Drive was cast in a new light. This was solely thanks to a somewhat talented bunch of programmers called Treasure and their first release, called Gunstar Heroes. It did things (such as 'scaling' and 'rotation' the buzzwords of the time, ah, how long ago it seems etc, etc) with the hardware which not even the people who designed the Mega Drive thought it could do. Plus, it was probably the most playable platform/ shoot-'em-up ever produced on any machine. Now times have changed, especially with the advent of 32-bitery, but it would seem, games haven't. Behold Gunner's Heaven, a PlayStation title 'influenced' slightly by Gunstar Heroes (although that's no bad thing). But without the two-player mode (which is a bit of a bad thing). All that would seem to have changed in the formula is that there are lots more huge enemies wandering round each stage, instead of saving themselves for end-of-level duties, and that there are two characters to choose from Axel Sonics (a boy) and Ruka Hetfield (a girl). Now this might seem like a bit of a waste of hardware, and in fact it is, but at the end of the day if it's as playable as Gunstar you could run it on a Zircon X3000 Space Mainframe and we wouldn't complain. 0002360D -6000 GAME BY TREASURE CONTACT COMPUTER EXCHANGE (0171-636 2666) FOR INFORMATION "


"REVIEW CVG BUDE SHOOT EVERYONE Given the odds against them Ruka and Axel have sensibly packed four guns apiece. And they're no ordinary guns either. These are nuclear-powered battery guns, which your character of choice can power up by collecting nuclear icons dropped by compliant enemies. While the two arsenals consist of similar elements, the actual weapons on offer differ somewhat between the two. NORMAL A rapid-fire attack which is best for taking out lots of little enemies. Axel's red laser is nice and powerful, but Ruka's (once powered-up) three-way blue laser is best. The big bouncy gun does Its thing. It's essential to use it here to destroy mis. siles fired at you by the boss. Who's now hiding. 2 .28 Area Buss Crushed? FLAMER Excellent for damage, but a bit lacking in other respects. Axel fires slow moving fireballs, whilst Ruka has a short-range flame-thrower sort of effort. youture 00024900 A.SONTCS 009 Rea Ross HOMING Pretty self-explanatory. This drains the power batteries like nothing on Earth, but is dead useful against bosses. Axel's single constant homing laser requires re-targetting against more than one foe, although Ruka's rapid fire job isn't as hot against guardians. GO REBOUND Bouncy green lasers are the order of the day here. Axel has the upper hand thanks to his big, fat and wide fast-firing lasers, while Ruka's globular shots, although handy, are limited by only allowing nine shots on screen at once (and some of them bounce around aimlessly for ages), YOU BRING OUT THE BOOST IN ME Every so often you'll stumble across a glowing green star-shaped bonus, with the word BOOST emblazoned across it. Grab this and your weapon is automatically powered up to maximum potential. Understandably, this then unleashes a massive swarm of death upon the screen, with nasties coming a cropper left and right to the massive sprays of firepower emanating from your chap (or chapess). However, its effects are only temporary, so make sure you don't get caught out. 2! SMART BOMB The one category in which Axel definitely has the upper hand is with smart bombs. Axel's blasts cover the entire screen, while all Ruka can manage is a feeble localised explosion. caver 19 "


"CVG REVIEW 00034000 1.SONTEC Areo Boss MINE SWEEPER It must be said that mine cart levels are the bane of the modern platform game, with such varied (and incongruous stars as Taz and Asterix all too willing to participate. Luckily, while Gunner's Heaven fea. tures one such level, you yourself are kitted out win a lovely pair of rocket-powered roller blades, and your task is to decimate the trolley-bound forces of darkness surrounding you. And their big tanks Luckily, you're able to use uncanny leaping and low sliding acrobat ics to dodge 00033400 much of the flak that comes your way. BUCU The swamp level is hazardous, dangerous and thoroughly capably murderous. SECOND OPINION 0002890 Well, Gunstar Heroes on the Mega Drive doesn't seem all that long ago, and as bonkers blasters go, it certainly was one. Gunner's Heaven is an excellent follow up, the only real niggle about this game is that it's on the PlayStation and we really wouldn't mind something a bit more ingenius than a horizontal-vertical scroller for our new machine. But like Raiden, which was a storming shoot-'em-up on the PSX, this more than makes up for the lack of 'Next Gen' ingenuity by having some lush backgrounds, great spot FX and excellent game design. Oh and it's rock too. GARY LORD VERDICT Oh no, it's a big, scary boss robot from Hades! Hooray for homing lasers and their pals! ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE Gunstar Heroes Sega/.99 Quite simply the best platform blaster ever. Tons of action, more originality than you'd ever believe and absolutely amazing bosses. Never a dull moment, and it's got a two-player mode too. ISSUE 142: 92% 09033600 A Take too many hits in a row and your sprite is momentarily stunned, leaving them open to further enemy attacks. PLAYSTATION Gunner's Heaven isn't a Next Generation game. There's nothing here which you couldn't, with a bit of effort, produce on a 16-bit machine. But that's not important, because it's also ace, and you'll need sharp eyes and strange alien elastic fingers if you want to get anywhere. Some of the bosses are a bit easy, but the levels themselves contain enough of a challenge for most players. As platform blasters go, this is dead smart. Although not as top as the two-player five yearold Gunstar Heroes. RAD AUTOMATIC Well, that's Axel and Ruka if you ask me. CHARACTED SELECT SONICS RUKA HETFIELD GRAPPLE SOURCE As a fully paid-up space ninja, you'd expect your little man to have some decent kit at his disposal. And he has. Like this nifty grappling hook thing. While it's useless for fighting with, the grappler is a defensive tool par excellence. You can fire it in any upwards direction and it'll jam into any solid platform it hits. Release the button and your interstellar commando spins right up to the end of his tether.

You play 'Man In a Tunic', a hardened RPG character who due to an unfortunate nuts accident walks, thanks to a wonderfully emotive performance from the central thespian, like he's got an upturned porcupine in his pants. Your job, as director if you will of this digitised screenplay, is to waddle him through a succession of harsh fantasy environments, doing battle with all manner of hideous monsters (\"Man In a Goblin Suit', 'Woman With Sword') and finding some ancient lost treasure of some description.

"CVG PREVIEW nachines A When Bug goes a. climbin' vertically you get this lil' viewpoint of him. SATURN Sega We all know Clockwork Knight was a bit pants but can Sega's new Saturn platformer cut the mustard? Anywhere where the trail is surrounded by a green verge Bug can't fall off the edge. SEGA SATURN is, but Sega are hoping his particular brand of platform A Lots of gaps in the plat. forms could mean that you're (ahem) bug-gered. ou've got to feel sorry for the Saturn, haven't you? I mean, it beat the other Next Generation consoles to the shops and launched with the superb Virtua Fighter, and since then it's done little to stun people (other than the excellent Panzer Dragoon). And, as a little Falcon Crest-style sub-plot, in the meantime it's been trying its hardest to revolutionise the staid and strip-mined world of platform games. And it hasn't done very well, let's face it. Clockwork Knight, pretty though it was, was hardly a testimony to ground-breaking game design. And then Jumping Flash! comes along. It's a bit of a bugger really, so far as Sega are concerned. But, obviously loathe to bring out the hedgehog cavalry so early in the game, Sega have a new champion waiting in the wings. He's only a little chap, being an insect as he versely huge as Bug is tiny. For you see, Bug is the latest practitioner of the burgeoning three-dimensional platform stylee. But instead of approaching the idea from a complicated first person view and making things difficult for everyone, Bug is the kind of 3D platformer your lil' sister could play. Bug himself is viewed from the standard flat-on third-person platform game view, with the level twisting and contorting and crossing over into the distance and our hero cavorting to suit. Bug, with its cartoony graphics and cutesy character, could be a decent hit-esque title for Sega, and you can find out if it is in a future issue of your supersoaraway CVG magazine!

"CVG REVIEW This pink 'thing' tries to kidnap your feathered friend. If you give him a quick slap about the head you'll find that he'll let go. 12 P SEGA SATURN SATURN Platform Sega |  on import Out Now OK, you were disappointed by Sega's first foray into the platform world on the Saturn the rather lame Clockwork Knight. Have they learnt their lesson? Apparently not... our guess is as good as mine when it comes to fathoming out Astal's plot. It's all explained in the cartoon style intro but since it's a Japanese game the text and speech is, surprisingly enough, in Japanese. Let's say it's about rescuing a princess ('cos these platform games invariably are) and that it's set over five large levels (because it is) which are broken down into smaller zones. Each level finishes with the oblig. atory boss from hell to dispose of. Astal has a number of attacking moves to kill such nasties and once the first level is completed a bird is rescued and will aid Astal in a similar way that Tails helped out Mr Hedgehog in Sonic 2. Except this bird isn't as crap as Tails and doesn't conk out at the first sign of trouble. aster DOUJI ASTAL LA VISTA! Refreshingly Astal's intro strays away from pre-rendered Silicon Graphics footage and is cartoon based instead. There's still some clever effects though, particularly the flickering sepia tone style section where Astal reminisces about his kidnapped girlie. Aw, bless.

The arrows are simple to avoid though, so the whole exercise seems pretty pointless to me. ALTERNATIVE SNES Donkey Kong Country Nintendo/.99 It might be Mario World with smart graphics, but that's one hell of a combination if you ask me. One of the best 'Next Gen' games so far and It's on the flippin' SNES! ISSUE 157: 90% SECOND OPINION There are also magic beans which Astal can gather and turn into smart-bomb style weapons. As a game Astal is very traditional in style. OK, SO there's an intro, but it's cartoon based, there's none of your pre-rendered gubbins here. The game itself strays away from 3D in-yer-face visuals that are becoming So common in 32-bit games and apart from some neat sprite scaling and a wide variety of palette there's nothing on offer here that screams Next Gen. Still, it's playability that counts so does Astal deliver? Right, well, platformy shooters with nice Jap-style graphics are the sort of games I like to see on the New Machines, and if you take a look at Jumping Flash on the following pages you'll see and read exactly why. Which isn't really the case with Astal, because it's basically a 16-bit game but with some groovy rendered graphics. Gameplay is located in the mediocre department, afraid there's nowt new here. GARY LORD VERDICT Each level culminates in a showdown with a boss. As they become damaged they break down into smaller but deadly foes. SATURN Astal is another average platformer from Sega. Much has been made of the graphics and it's true that there's some smart sprite scaling, but other sprites such as the dragons in the volcanic level are laughable, and the parallax scrolling is horribly wooden! Gameplay is shallow with a strange difficulty curve. Levels start off difficult but there's a knack to each one and once that's discovered you'll cruise through. There's only five levels and with a price tag of 70 quid this is poor value and one to avoid. RIK SKEWS A Astal has some subtle but clever programming tricks such as sprite scaling and this ginormous enemy sprite. 81 RAIG PH-80 ICS SOUND 72 BYA 40 OVERALL 62 22 "


"CVG REVIEW ma PLAYSTATION Platform Sony - PlayStation Out Now No other versions planned No other versions available Jumping Flash. It's a gas, gas, gas. As they say. What it really is though is a Next Gen platform game that is so radically different to anything that's gone before. Oh and it's a gas as well (ie funny)... and it's viewed from a firstperson perspective through the eyes of your bunny, so to speak. This obviously means there's a lot more to the jumping tomfoolery than just running right and hitting the A button every now and again. Indeed, it adds new strategic depths and puzzle elements to what was previously a reflexes-only genre. It's also going to make you feel very travel sick indeed. oh, don't you just hate titles with punctuated endings? Those stupid question marks and suchlike just get in the way of a sentence, and you're never sure whether to actually obey the literal command you're faced with or ignore it, and possibly muck up your reading flow. Jumping Flash! has one of these very titles. And, to cap it all, it's a platform game. Mind you, it also has a giant leaping robot space bunny, so it can't be all bad. And the main bad guy of the piece is the stupendously-monikered Baron Aloha, which is good for another few points. The other little element in favour of Jumping Flash! is that, as platform games go, it's rather original. This doesn't mean it's got a minecart section or a shoot-'em-up level it actually does something radically different with possibly the tiredest game format of all.

"REVIEW CVG Of all the pictures to caption in the world, it has to be the one which doesn't make Jumping Flash! look exciting. SPACE HOPPER Jumping. Every platform game character does it, one way and another. But R-1 (as your robot bunny character is so catchily named) does things a little differently. A single press of the jump button produces what you'd expect a small jump. But press the button again whilst you're in mid air and Frisky (as we call him) leaps miles up into the air, and casts his head down so you're able to view the descent. The easiest way to line up your landing is by using Frisky's shadow, although a sight is placed in the centre of the screen for this purpose. If you still don't think you've got enough elevation, a correctly timed third press at the peak of Frisky's second jump is good for an extra few feet. It takes a while to get used to all this, your first few jumps are incredibly disorientating, but once you adjust to Frisky's eyes it's as instinctive as taking a wee. STIGE BONUS STAR Only you, giant robot space bunny, can save Stonehenge from evil aliens. Maaan. EYES DOWN The trouble with having three dimensions to peruse is that it's very hard to see exactly where everything is in relation to your own bad self. But fear not platfans, for Frisky's incredible neck allows him to look not just around himself on the horizontal plane, but also to gaze up and even down JUST LIKE REAL LIFE by pressing the top buttons on the PSX controller. As always, though, there are conditions under which it's inadvisable to try this. The first is whilst moving, as you'll end up crashing into an enemy, getting lost or plummeting off the edge of the level (which spells instant doom). The second is when you're already quite high up on a platform, as the glare from the sun can all to easily blind a sensitive bunny and disorientate the player even more. The Egyptian level is ace, especially as you can jump all over the Sphinx. Which isn't allowed. R-1 29 "


"CVG REVIEW WORLD 1 STAGE 2 STAGE STAGE 3 PLAYBOY BUNNY Aah, what would a platform game be without a bonus bonus-collecting bonus level? Not much different, we reckon, but that's not the point. The point is that most levels have, secreted somewhere about their person, a bonus icon. They're usually rather hard to reach, but once you collect one you're whisked to a power-up Avalon. Balloons of various colours are scattered wantonly around the level, some on blocks, some on the floor. Your job is to bounce upon or shoot these, whereupon they release their iconic beauty. But beware, as you're only granted a limited time allowance in which to gorge yourself on bonuses. TIME UP This bit takes some explaining, but doesn't actually do anything. So don't worry. Frisky checks his descent. Use the gun sights or shadow to guide him. Shoot balloons to release the bonus goodies contained therein. Or jump on them. We're not bothered. Go ahead. ICON TINA TURNER Power-ups. Bonuses. Icons. Call 'em what you like, they're the meat and potatoes of games character enhancement. Luckily for Jumping Flashl players, there are three whole dimensions of the bleeders to collect. Here's a quick rundown of what they are and what they do. ACORN BOMB/LASERS/ SWEETS BOMB Three smart bombs, all with similar destructive functions. Collect the set! HEALTH-UP Grasping this power-up heals a small amount of damage Frisky may have incurred. HEALTH-MAX Heals all known wounds with a single easy-to-follow step. Particularly useful. Remember BARON A the in-level locations of these. 1-UP An extra life is yours for the taking simply by collecting the bunnyadorned 1-Up Icon. MAGIC BEAN It might look like a cold capsule or some drugs from Grange Hill, but this is in fact an invincibility icon. Mind you, it also makes the screen oscillate with vibrant primary colours, so perhaps Zammo did have a quick go at it. TIME-UP Adds 30 seconds to your dwindling time supply. However, the time limits are fairly generous anyway, so these aren't that useful. TIME STOP Freezes all eneyour well-being you'll like them. JETPOD Your very raison d'etre. Each level contains a certain number of jetpods, all of which require collecting before you're allowed to exit the level. Fortunately they're indicated on the horizon with a yel. low JETPOD sign, should you gaze at the right spot. mies, moving plat. forms, bosses, icons, magnetic walkways and all other things which utilise motion.

"REVIEW CVG WARREN EXPLOSION Frisky, as a well-armed fellow, can carry up to three smart bombs at any one time. There are var ious varieties of these, from bombs which look like acorns to ones which fire what look like green-and-yellow liquorice bootlaces. These are the ideal complement to his (pretty tame) blasters, which are useful for taking out regular inlevel baddies, but which are almost useless against the giant bosses which occupy the third and final stage of each world. Always keep your smart bomb levels topped up. This dragon boss doesn't normally look like this. He's just temporarily flashing after being shot. SECOND OPINION This game really does have the most amazing feeling of elevation. This new PSX platformer is what Next Generation gaming is all about, mainly because there's just no way that you could ever produce a game of this kind on a 16-bit machine. The idea of leaping from one platform to another is simple but not very innovative, and although it incorporates many elements of past games like Mario, Sonic it does so in a totally unique way. Plus it has that mad, Japanese feel to it: brilliance beyond belief. GARY LORD VERDICT o RABBIT RADAR As a giant robot-leaping space bunny it's only natural that you're going to have a few on-board extras. One of these is your radar which appears as a blue circle in the top right of the screen. Your field of vision is illuminated in a lighter shade of blue. Enemies are white dots, while jetpods flashing red ones. It takes a while to get used to the radar, since it's only two dimensional, so you're never sure at exactly what elevation the object in question is. Warning: do not fry an egg over a volcano in real life. It may prove hazardous. PLAYSTATION Jumping Flash! is a big leap forward in platform games. It's also the sort of game your mum would never learn to play in a million years. Once you've orientated yourself to the unusual viewpoint, and got used to the feeling of elevation, you still find yourself twisting and contorting in your seat as you take each Jump, such is the level of realism. But it Isn't just the spectacular feeling of being there that makes Jumping Flash! so outstanding. It's also an Imaginative, challenging and highly playable platform game.

Barring global nuclear war or massive global disease etc, it's very likely we will (hopefully) live to a ripe old age I hope to be playing video games when I'm 90! Also, he failed to point out the following important facts: 1) By the time the machines are released in the UK there should be a wider range of quality software available on both machines instead of the few currently on offer. 2) Not wishing to be biased in any way, but Sega seem to be repeating the same trend seen in many Mega Drive games -ie amazing graphics/sound but no depth or real difficulty in completion of the title (witness Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon). Let's hope this doesn't continue as  plus is a lot for a few nights of gameplay! 3) Finally, seeing as both machines are fairly evenly speeded technically, it will come down to price, quantity and quality of software support available to decide LETTER OF THE MONTH  PRIZE WINNER 32 "


"LETTERS CVG Dear C&VG, I noticed in your last issue a letter from Darryl Still of Atari UK. I liked his comments about racing cars when comparing consoles, but he overlooked one thing. None of them go without petrol! Where is the petrol for the Jaguar, or rather, where are the games? In fact where is the CD player? Perhaps it's being sold by a six-foot invisible rabbit called Harvey, which is why I haven't seen one? Every time I ask at Silica, I'm given a new release date. Where were all the television adverts over the Christmas period? Surely it would have been good marketing practice to actually try to sell the machine that you produce? You'd think that Atari would have learned from their mistakes by now. I've had my Jag a year and if it wasn't for Doom I would have sold it long ago. It might not be the exact same as the PC version, but PCs aren't available for . In my opinion, Darryl Still couldn't market condoms in a brothel. Noel Wallace, Carluke, Scotland CVG: Congratulations Noel you're the 700th person to stretch Darryl's motor racing analogy! I wonder how long we can keep this up? This could become an issue and we'll end up going on about hubcaps. Anyway point taken. poor old darryl good old get a job, pauper darryl Dear CVG, There has been a lot of talk in your magazine recently about Darryl Still's Jaguar/Saturn/PSX comparison. All three machines are very powerful, outclassing anything else in the console world at the moment. The Jaguar has received more than its fair share of bad press recently, for a number of reasons. We all know that Darryl Still's letter was never going to be an unbiased and objective argument in the Jag vs Saturn/PSX debate and he would gain little but a slating from PSX/Saturn owners. In terms of sheer straight-line, flat-out processor speed, the Jaguar comes out on top. Perhaps not by as much as Darryl Still suggested, but it does come out on top, purely on the merit of its high bus bandwidth and 64-bit data bus. Comparing 64-bit to 32-bit is an unfair comparison, but that is just what the machines are based on. Darryl Still's comment about the Jag's sound system is fair. It is better than any of the 16-bit audio, the same as all the new consoles and multimedia PCs. The question of graphics is a complicated one. Again, the Jag uses the Super Console general standard of 16.8 million colours, again just as the PSX and Saturn. The Jag does have a pretty damn high rendering speed of 850 million pixels per second. I don't know about the PSX and Saturn. I won't attempt to compare 3D polygon power, because it is so complicated and there is no real standard to judge it on. Though the Jag hardware is well within the range of the PlayStation and Saturn, if not ahead, and the Jaguar games scene is improving with the Jag CD giving programmers more freedom. The Jag is starting to gain strength, and the longer it takes for the Saturn and PlayStation to arrive the longer the Jag accumulates more owners. You probably won't agree with everything I said, if anything, but it is the truth. Michael Bolton. Dear CVG, I am writing about that crusty old subject, the price of games. Software houses like Sega, Virgin etc say that the reason for the high price of games are development costs, shipping and distribution. With the videogame revenue being nearly as much as that of movies, you'd think that game manufacturers could bring out games for  on average (videos cost -20). Dave Perry said that the budget for Earthworm Jim was between -3 million, the average movie budget would be  million (low budget would be twice that of Earthworm Jim). I would not imagine videos are more mass market than videogames. On the subject of development costs, programmers say that with new machines the voices of real actors (ie failed 'Hollywood stars') bump up these costs. Now, can actors like Mark Hamill or Grace Jones cost as much as Jack Nicholson cost for Batman ($60 million)? Then there's advertising. Sega have ads for big games, just like Warner Bros or Universal have ads for big movies. Sometimes with movie tie-in games the advertising is already done. Look, what I am trying to say is games do not cost a quarter as much as movies do to make, yet cost four times as much to buy. And what I want to know is, quite simply. why? John F. Templeogue, Dublin, Ireland CVG: The thing is, John, movies have long runs in cinemas before they're available to buy, and film companies make loads of cash that way. And film producers don't have to pay a royalty to every cinema just for the privilage of using their screen, unlike poor old cartridge developers. Plus chips are more expensive than film. And there are facilities to manufacture lots of films in Britain, whereas most disks and carts are produced overseas. That's why. 33 "

Like all the finest in its class, FX Fighter's characters will all boast over 40 moves each, including all the multiple hit attacks and combos a beat-'em-up freak could wish for. FX will also have wide screen options, various views and the dreamy tracking camera that Virtua, Toh Shin Den and Tekken employ. Best of all, for fans of this genre, is the fact that FX Fighter has been written with the Gravis joypad specifically in mind. So rather than fumbling around on a huge keypad trying to work out a combo, you can luxuriate in a SNES-style-button bashing routine. Programmers Argonaut, famous for among other things Starwing, are also promising that we won't get a Rise of the Robots out of them and not only will it look stunning, but that it's having plenty of time invested in the playability. Release is scheduled for about July, so until you get the full lo-down in review form from your fav-ourite mag, just drool at these shots (they are taken from a playable demo)! Oh, and try not to cream your shorts at the fact that Argonaut claim FX can run, quite playably, on a 486 33mhz, with only a small reduction in detail. Just check out that texturemapped pussy.

In the game the airships literally launch the fighters into mid-air, and this pic' here is a diagram of one of the original air ships. I think I'd rather take the train myself. War. What is it good for? Computer games spring to mind, but then that's my occupation. If I was in a parallel world, though, and a member of the Arayan Dynasty (the ruling family of the land mass that we in our world call Russia) whose patriarch (the emperor) had just popped his clogs, then war would be what I would use to claim the empire as my own, and get rid of my three rival peers. Such is the plot for Rowan Software's latest addiA VGA and sumptuous SVGA graphics options.

Quality rendered bloke with big mus. cles and guns. oaded PLAYSTATION Expected release: OCTOBER Loaded is going to be a top-downshoot-your-mother-if -she-gets-in-theway-affair. Good news for Play Station owners because the bizarre mind of 2000 AD artist Greg Staples is set to spin into the machine's CD drive courtesy of Gremlin. Revenge, violence and large weapons set the scene for this top-down 3D shoot 'em-up which centres on a cut-throat band of murdering mercenaries (nice people as Brucie would say) imprisoned, thankfully, in the toughest high security, straight jackets and padded cutlery prison in the galaxy. From what we can gather the inmates have been inside doin' a stretch a mite too long and must escape the evil clutches of FUB the Elvis Impersonator. Unfortunately all that walking the chain gang and prison food has left your choice of characters all a little twisted and a wee bit unstable. So, you'll have the chance of marauding through 12 levels of arcade blasting as Psychotic Fwank or snipe your way through the terrain morphed environ ment as cross-dressing Butch, that's if you don't mind laddering your tights.

Crickey, it's Britain, it must be, a place where old ladies roam wild through desolate urban decay, completely unattended, drinking strong lager and carving their initials on phone boxes with Swiss army knifes. No, it's not actually it's Neutropolis, a place so dull even the paint can't bear to watch itself dry. There's not much information available at present on the guts of the game because it's got a long way to go, but CVG can categorically confirm that there's not so much as a sniff of old ladies in Normality Inc. What it should be, though, is a huge first person adventure featuring tons of motion capturing and celeb voice overs where you play a down-on-his-luck hero with a quest. Admittedly we don't have a clue what the quest is, but rest assured as soon as we do you'll be the first to know. GE ITS Huge first person perspective thrills beckon in Normality inc.

"CVG PREVIEW WORK INPROGRESS PC CD-ROM IN PROGRESS Unconfirmed Football sim Gremlin Interactive Fotonfirmed Programmed by Gremlin initiated 1993 180% complete No other versions planned Playstation version available Estimated release September At Gremlin's HQ a major breakthrough in footy games is being made! CVG witnesses Zool's substitution for the real soccer professionals! SEUHAR ame technology in the Nine ties is racing away and the public now demands a new breed of soccer game to dethrone the Sensibles and Int. Sup. Soccers of the world. Surprisingly, there are few challengers and the uptake is slow, Sega's Saturn console spawned Victory Goal, but this, while looking good failed to impress. Gremlin are about to change all this with investment comparable to Jack Walker's in Blackburn Rovers, for their championship contender, Actua Soccer. Aside from invest ment in Silicon Graphics machines and a motioncapture studio, Gremlin have also brought in professional help to make sure their polygon players behave as they should. Enter Andy Sinton and Chris Woods, both Sheffield Wednesday and England players, but why get involved in a video game? Andy expl-ained to CVG: \"I've got a Mega Drive which I've had for about three years. With playing for England, Sega are one of the major sponsors and they kit us out with all the new titles. \"I like golf games and, being a pro sportsman, Sega used to give us titles that had a sporty angle.\" That seemed to validate Andy as a gamer, but for Chris the whole experience was for a different reason: \"I gave my Mega Drive and my games to my son. I'm doing this because ever since I was a kid it's always been a dream of mine to appear in a film or a game.\" The game itself looks superb. What's interesting though, is that it started life as a simple, Endland playable 2D arcade footy sim and has evolved from there, which is always a good sign where playability is concerned. Play should feature all the things we've come to expect like aftertouch, plus a host of new ideas. Each player should have his own set of characteristics like height and weight and these, in conjunction with more standard statistics, will dictate his ability. Far more exciting though is the link-up system being perfected for Actua. This should allow 20 people to play from first-person perspective at the same time. Link this up with nine virtual-camera angles, linesmen that actually follow play, refs that can be seen to make decisions and celebrity commentary and I think you'll have to concede that football games may never be the same again. ACTUA SOCCER WHAT'S ALL THE CO-MOTION? Motion capture technology is the industry buzz word at the moment and the great white hope for the future of gaming to boot. The effects that can be generated in an amazingly short period of time are both visually exciting and accurate as well. But the actual process which creates the final images is remarkably straightforward. Gremlin's motion capture studio uses six wall mounted cameras to pick up the actors, or in this case footballers. The first thing that the Gremlin boys have to do is attach roughly 70 reflector balls all over Andy Sinton's body. V Andy then strikes the ball in a variety of positions. These are picked up by the cameras and are sent to a Silicon Graphics workstation. Note that because Gremlin's soccer game will feature a 3D texture-mapped ball, the ball that Andy is kicking also has receptors on it so that the ball's motion and spin is caught accurately.

"PREVIEW CVG WORK INPROGRESS MEGA DRIVE IUnconfirmed Action Sega Programmed by Sega initiated August 1994 190% complete No other versions planned No other versions available Estimated release August 1995 Comics are an amazing form of passive entertainment, which require imagination and suspension of disbelief to be fully enjoyed. The only TV prog' which can boast this also is Shane Ritchie's Lucky Numbers, which requires an awful lot of both imagination and 'suspension of disbelief just to work out why exactly it was allowed to happen. The great thing about comics, though, is that they're a good workout for the adrenal glands, without being too hard on the brain. You can just close them and throw them on the floor when you're finished, instead of having to worry about all this interactivity business and completing levels and things. Unless, of course, you're Trevor Supermanfan, be-ponytailed star of Sega's Comix Zone. Poor old Trev has, through strange alien psychic intervention, been sucked into his comics collection, and has to fight his way out, past hordes of evil supervillains and mutant terrorists. A bit like hometime at CVG, actually. Except poor old Trevor, unlike us, doesn't have any superpowers of his own with which to combat the evil menaces in his path. All he has are his uncanny martial arts ninja abilities (obviously picked up by reading Daredevil or something). Poor lamb. Anyway, if you'd like to help Trey out you'll have to wait a couple of months for the release of the game (full review soon-ish). PANEL BEATER Comix Zone is almost the Crystal Maze of the videogames world. Progress through the game depends upon the player being able to complete a single task in each panel of the comic. Some of these are straightforward fighting jobs, others are puzzles and some are more platform-y type skill tests. Only once you've completed the task put in front of SAETONEEDS HELP you is your character advanced to the next frame, as the hand of an evil cartoonist draws the next threat.

"CVG PREVIEW VOAK CNPROGRESS MEGA DRIVE Unconfirmed Sports Codemasters Programmed by Codemasters initiated Jan 95 90% complete PC and Game Gear versions planned INo other versions avall. able Estimated release July WORLD TOUR Two rebel alliance freedom fighters in their Hoth fatigues prepare for tennis war on the Empire. WORLD TOUR TOINETTI Pete Sampras is certainly popular with sponsors. Let's just hope that Codemasters haven't spent as much as Nike did last year on their poster campaign showing the young tennis star serving a hand grenade. Let's face it, that was a bit silly. Not just because of the physical danger they placed Pete himself in (playing with explosives indeed), but because Nike have a broad range of products they'd surely like to sell, and using Pete Sampras to publicise them is going to sell nought but a pile of plain white shorts and T-shirts, because that's what tennis players wear. Not exactly great for business now is it? But the programmers of Pete Sampras '96 won't mind it means they can concentrate on adding new features to the game instead of wasting time colouring-in all the characters. And what features they're adding, SINGLES SINGLES PETE I NA SAMPRAS Y COACHY-COO gamestrels. The original Pete Sampras was favourably received by all as the best combination of realism and playability the Mega Drive had seen in a tennis title, and it looks like the forthcoming update should top even these lofty peaks. Indoor courts make their debut appearance and special secret player characters are hidden away in the code. It's a 4-player J-Cart again. Plus there are hordes of new on-court moves, the laws of physics are present thanks to the inertia system and there are all the camera angles and replays that you could possibly want. The launch of Pete Sampras '96 is scheduled to coincide with Wimbledon fortnight, so hopefully we should be able to tell you whether Codemasters have magically fixed an unbroken thing or gilded a lily in the next issue. One of the more interesting features Codemasters have devised for Sampras '96 is a coaching system. Apparently, after every change of ends, the CPU shows the players how they could have improved their performance and demonstrates shots which would have been better used in certain situations. Sounds very clever, the little show-offs. Still, it might be rubbish, so make sure you read the review. POVIRHEE KURBERIAO Pete Sampras, in this age of equality, allows you to play mixed singles. HE OASTER Unlike ice hockey, tennis doesn't have scope for including a beat'em-up section. Such a pity. Suddenly the school obstaclerace leaders burst on to the court in a desperate rush for the finish. PRO TEMAOMESON Even amputees with stubby arms can play tennis.

A Parasite looks like a cross between Doom and Flashback let's hope they make it gory. arasite looks set to be the darkest, dankest, moodiest, evilest same to hit the PlayStation. just drips nastiness and oozes atmosphere. Certainly not a game for the faint hearted. The plot is, for once in a game, novel. You take the role of a plain old John Doe, going about his business without a care in the world when, with all the tact of a bulldozer running over a pensioner, an alien copper descends from above and possesses his body. That's all fair enough Room for a few jolly adventures, lots of gunning down allen criminals and generally being a real coffee-anddonuts cyber-rozzer. Unfortunately for our hero, the alien inhabiting his body isn't a pleasant sight, and to make matters worse he's slowly mutating his new found ally from normal Johnny Homosapien to nasty tentacled alien. The game itself looks a little like a high-tech version of that little-known Psygnosis classic Persian Gulf Inferno. The object there, rather than take on hordes of aliens, was to blast loads of Arab terrorists with a shot. gun while rolling around looking suitably gung-ho. But Parasite certainly takes the formula a massive leap further. There are over 300 fully rendered locations for you to explore with thousands of aliens to destroy, plot twists to uncover and puzzles to solve. Hopefully this game won't get dwarfed by the rest of Psygnosis' more mainstream releases, as we think it's looking dead ace. All things being well and present, and barring any major mishaps, there's every chance of Parasite hitting the shelves early next year. Watch out for a full in-depth work in progress which we'll be bringing you as soon as it's physically possible. A The character graphics are superb.

Fresh from his deserved success on Mega Drive and SNES, he's soon to appear on Games Gear and Boy, courtesy of Eurocom. First impressions suggest that Eurocom are doing a sterling job converting the wriggly one to handheld, and while the graphics lack the finesse of the 16-bitters they are still impressive considering the technical limitations of both machines.

Earthworm Jim looks like being one of the summer's big hits so come back with your grow bag next month when we dig him up for the full review. Jim slips about in a Sonic 3 stylee at the start of level two. Boo! Hiss! It's the arch baddy, the evil Psycrow. Asteroids is the bonus game, and darned good fun in the 16 bit versions it was too. Each level features a mid-stage as well as endof-level boss and they're right gits to finish off I can assure you. il: HN205 GAME BY EUROCOM CONTACT VIRGIN (0181-960 2255) FOR INFORMATION 48 "


"PREVIEW CVG ANPAOGRESS Unconfirmed Platform Infogrames Programmed by Infogrames initiated October '94 90% complete INo other versions planned No other versions avail able Estimated release July MEGA DRIVE NEW YOUNG TV Spirou is a cartoon character. A French one, in fact. And, uncannily, he's in a platform game licensed by Infogrames, themselves hailing from the Gallic (or garlic) territories. Anyway, if you're interested in seeing how Spirou struts his thang he's a journalist, not a kebab shop assistant realthen invest in a satelite dish. That's because his very own show is to hit the Children's Channel this summer. Poor old Spirou. His best pal Count Champignac has been kidnapped by the robot Cyanida, and it's up to him to save the day. This never would have happened if he'd stayed in the kebab shop with his uncle Pokapodu like his dad said he should. But life's like that, eh? Just when you think you've got a stable life of carving strips of horse and plopping then into a slice of raw bread you make friends with a mad scientist and a squirrel. But it's not all bad. Spirou's salachili adventures take him all over the world, confronting a gamut of evil platforms and their kin, for such are adventures ADDNI Urin UTU such as these. But the titular Spirou's quest also features elements of puzzling. RPGing and shoot-'em-uping. It's three wishes in one! Spriou himself is the cat that keeps it all together, thanks to the fact that, when the game finally sees the light of day, he should be able to walk, run, jump, bend, slide, dive, swim, climb, push and use objects he discovers along his travels (and travails). Just another platform game, probably, but we'll reserve judgement 'til next ish. CONTACT INFOGRAMES (0171-911 3094) FOR INFORMATION 49 "

"REVIEWS CVG reviewed this month. here's a whole ruck of ace new software in this issue. Apparently. I wouldn't know, because I was too busy swanning around the States playing all the even newer and acer stuff at the E3 show. However, my slaves seem especially impressed with Jumping Flash! and Gunner's Heaven both on PlayStation as well as reopening the Street Fighter vs Mortal Kombat debate playing SF: The Movie and Mortal 3. Personally, I'm too mature for all this sort of behav. iour, so I've whiled away time on Ultimate Soccer Manager, hir, ing players who scored against Arsenal this season and sacking them. Dr LOVESUN PATTERSON, EDITOR What we're playing this month MARK USM/PC The perfect soccer management title, the right level of realism without getting bogged down by millions of menus. And it's great for revenge plots. Wipeout/PSX Yeah, I know it's not been reviewed yet, but I've already played the game loads and it's absolutely the best thing you will ever see. Better, in fact. Killer Instinct/SNES Another game that you won't get to play for aeons but this is totally and incredibly mind-blowing as well. Just you wait and see. late how amazing It Is, but it'd just make me cry. Mortal Kombat 3/Arcade Just because Sindel reminds me of all the deadly ninja attack techniques could perform with my hair. When I had some. Street Fighter: The Movie/Arcade Actually, I prefer Gunner's Heaven, but I don't want to start any Mortal/Street Fighter tiffs by favouring one or the other at the moment. Prisoner of Ice p.58 This month's hot-hits Here at CVG we don't give high scores away lightly. A game has to be rather special before it scores of 90% or over and a CVG Hit. Even rarer though is a CVG Gold (awarded to games that have pushed back the boundaries of gaming) but don't expect to see more than a few of these a year as it takes a score of 95% or over to earn one. Anyway, here are the top games this month... Streetfighter p.52 tiful gaming moment. Ultra Vortex/Jaguar Not exactly my favourite game of the month. I couldn't get past the first opponent, actually. And then I got bored. SIMON Prisoner of Ice/PC Infogrames bare their glow-in-thedark plastic horror fangs to bring us this cortex-plercingly swoonsome Call of Cthulu-type adventure. Rise of the Triads/PC Pass the paracetomol I'm on a Bruce Lee tip, pad-pad. dlers. It's kind of Doom-y, but with a dodgy-dubbing chop-socky ambience all of its own. Jumping Flashl/PSX I 'hop' Sony don't 'sklp' this one on the offical release schedules. It's a great \"leap' for platform games, I'll put 'bunny' on it. Ho ho. 28 Jumping Flash PlayStation 52 Streetfighter: The Movie/Coin-op 54 Star Trek: TNG/PC CD-ROM 58 Prisoner Of Ice/PC CD-ROM 72 Ultimate Soccer Manager/PC GARY Jumping Flash!/PSX Bunny rabbits are dead cute, so it's nice to be given the chance to have that fullon virtual rabbit experience I've always wanted. Gunner's Heaven/PSX It might not look like a 32bit triumph, but Gunner's Heaven is all-playable and all-challenging and a beauThe big picture RAD Jumping Flash!/PSX The best platform game ever devised ever by anyone. Ever. I wish I could articuIf any other version of a game is available, then we'll tell you via our Alternatives and Other Versions boxes. We'll even tell you it it's destined for any other formats.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVC Bet he didn't feel very silly filming his moves. the movie then it was more or less a two horse race, until Virtua Fighter with its fierce 3D characters and bone-breaking combos, not to mention the likes of Killer Instinct. Tekken to name two more. Are those belonging to the Street Fighter Sect going to have to lose their religion? 'No fear is the answer because five years on Street Fighter the Movie has hit the arcades, with a whole new Jean Claude Van Damme kind of a look, and special 20 hit combos to boot! Could this be the new testament? Well, should you wish to take communion you'll be treated to 14 characters, two of whom are totally like, new and they have the monickers Sawada (Guile's second in command, and possessor of a lethal combo technique) and Blade (all we can tell you at the mo is he's very quick!). There's also a tag fight option and some rather impressive backgrounds, I have a penchant for the one that is just a wall of monitors hors showing clips of the film. The game has also stayed true to its origins as all the old moves have been incorporated (so there's no fumbling around with the controls trying to do specials). The beauty of the latter is that this gives you more time to find the new moves. like Chun Li's rising bird kick (great for starting a punishing combo). What makes Street Fighter the Movie such a great game though is one major factor: playability. and in a beat-'em-up this is defined by the character's control method, enabling you to work out different combo techniques easily. A major drawback though is there aren't any special finishing moves or hidden characters like MK3, but SF the Movie is certainly as playable which should have die-hard SF fans flocking to the arcades. Especially as all the familiar controls are in place. Beg, borrow or steal (only do the last one if you nave your parents' permis Sion) to get some cash to play this game, in fact don't bother wasting your money on the film. just play the game, after all that's what it's all about. 18 SPRITES ANIMATION SPECIALS PLAYABILITY V cpu MULTIPLAYER 393 18 18 TAG ALONG IF YOU LIKE... We at CVG believe in the adage 'many hands make light work, and when the light in our games room goes we all help change the bulb to help make the light work. In Street Fighter the Movie the same applys, as there's a tag match option. Simply go to the selection Screen and choose the character who you will start playing as, and then choose a second player who you wish to continue with should you lose the first round. On this stage if you choose E Honda as your partner, and you lose the first round he will break free from his manacles and rescue you. 53 "


"CVG REVIEW Adventure Spectrum Holobyte Unconfirmed Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned PC CD-ROM Fancy encountering strange new civilisations, solving ancient puzzles, and blashing loads of aliens? f you enjoy graphical adventures, with the emphasis on the graphics and good solid problem solving, then you must be jumping up and down in anticipation of Spectrum Holbyte's latest creation. If you're a Trekkie also then cream your panties now, because TNG is a Star Trek fan's wet dream on your PC. No two ways about it, Spec Holobyte have made the most out of the licence they got from Paramount. Even the intro is done like a regular episode, including a prologue and full titles. However, for all the digitised video in the intro, the game doesn't use FMV at all. Instead, you get SVGA animations of the crew based on photos of the cast. It takes a bit of getting used to, and definitely isn't a gorgeous as video, but it allows for more gameplay in the long run. So it's a traditional graphical adventure, with away teams on different planets solving puzzles to continue the star trek the next generation plot. Two things make it a bit special, though. For one, the sound is amazing. Each character's lines are from the relevant actor, and all the sound effects are spot on. And then the on-board segments of the game involve tactical control of the Enterprise strategy bits if you will. You have to manage the ship: from chatting with dignitaries to full-scale battles, and use the crew as best you can. You can travel to any planet in the galaxy, even if it isn't directly involved with the plot. In all it's a pleasant breather from telling away team members to 'use object X with object Y to solve puzzles. Star Trek: TNG is like plenty of graphical adventures before it. It's a good game with some great puzzles and long enough for almost anybody to feel they got value of money out of it. But it does have the Enterprise, and that just tips the balance from good game to great game. Ah, the bridge, looking just like it does in the series. This is where you spend most of your shipboard time between planets and when engaging the enemy. CAPTAIN'S LOG, SUPPLEMENTAL Failing to solve puzzles correctly the first time round results in your crew getting mashed, sliced and dicedsometimes all at once. There we were, just casually cruising round the galaxy (as you do) when suddenly we discovered the whole crew had been turned into SVGA graphics of themselves. In a bid to solve this mys. tery, we set course for planet Plottwist-1, which was suitably green and evil. looking so we knew we were at the right place. Locals were friendly though. Over in the transporter room, I tucked my shirt in for the umpteenth time this episode and beamed the away team, well... away. Now if I can only remember what button it was.

BIO PC There are hundreds of graphical adventures on PC, and some astoundIngly good ones too like Full Throttle (last Issue). The difference here is one of graphics (SVGA Instead of standard VGA), sound (fully digitised speech from the series, with great Fx too) and the whole Star Trek: TNG theme.

"CVG REVIEW Beat-'em-up SNK .99 Out Now Arcade version available No other versions planned NEO GEO CD While Street fighter carved up the market, one game quietly sequeled itself without anyone, apart from the hard-core gamers, noticing. Shame really, but it looks like tarnishing its reputation here. atal Fury, in its first two incarnations was a good, solid, go-for-the-throat kind of game which wowed arcadsters and made a good, solid profit wherever it went. Not many people could tell you why. Basically, apart from being damn good fun, it was nothing more than a Street fighter clone with a few extra nobbly bits tagged on for just good measure. This latest version features most of the villains and heroes from the previous game along with five new characters and host of new locations to duff them up in front of. Like so many other recent beat-'em-ups, the combo potential has been boosted off the scale, but if that's the only real device SNK considered implementing to improve this game, they've missed plenty of opportunities. You see Fatal Fury's strength comes from its excellent stylised characters, and speedy gameplay. But you can only have that served up in front of you so many times before it becomes stale and tasteless. And that's what's happened here. While beat-'em-ups have progressed thanks to the likes of Tekken and Killer Instinct, Fatal Fury has been left wallowing in the mire of previous success. SLUG SCHOOL As if surviving a ruck wasn't tough enough, Fatal Fury 3 also rates your performance. A-students will normally be the ones who've completely trounced their opponent in a blaze of combos and special attacks, while Es and Fs are normally the people who go for those snide 'tappy-tappy' low sweep tactics. But it does all depend, ultimately, on how well you vary your tactics.

VERDICT NEO GEO CD I'm a big fan of the Neo Geo CD, and it's good to see SNK sticking by thier release policy and getting games into the home as they arrive in the arcades. Which makes this a double shame, as the efforts have been wasted on a game which, while very playable, is uninspiring. Apart from being able to leap into the screen, there's very little else on offer to separate it from the myriad of Street fighter wannabees the Neo Geo has spawned.

"CVG REVIEW RPG Infogrames .99 Out June No other versions available No other version planned PC CD-ROM The Necronicom, I found the ancient text of the Necronicom, the HP Lovecraft fan shouted, until a rational human being slapped him back to his senses and he realised he'd just been playing Prisoner of Ice... A Wow, it's Don Estelle of It Aint 'Alf Hot Mum fame. don't know how many of you out there in gamer land are aware of the celebrated horror novelist HP Lovecraft, but he was responsible for the short stories that became the cult movies ReAnimator One and Two and also From Beyond. He was also responsible for creating the creatures and world of the Cthulu mythos: strange, giant, alien deities that visited Earth long ago and left their cults and other bizarre artifacts around to send anyone who found themselves one pube short of a toilet-seat full. Prisoner of Ice is the sequel to an earlier Infogrames product, Shadow of the Comet and plays in a similar style. Set just before the outbreak of the Second World War, Prisoner's plot centres around a mysterious cargo box, a Nazi scheme and some dodgy Latin types. Add this to the Cthulu stuff and add motion-capturing video sequences and a set of extremely logical puzzles and you've got Prisoner of Ice in a nutshell. As you'd imagine from those arty French types, the animation is beautiful, using over 1,500 different frames to make your character, Ryan, and the other 40 punters you interact with tick. It's a must if you're a fan of the Cthulu role-playing game, but if you're not it shouldn't really put you off because it's a really well-planned adventure. And the winner of the 1939 Eurovision competition is err, definitely Germany. It's time to escape from the open-plan school toilet level.

"REVIEW CVC And I think it was Prof. Plum in the bottom with a nuclear weapon. A Hey gringo, you want to come with me and see man about dog A Go on mate, give us a record deal, we're good honest. WAR OF THE WORLDS Prisoner of Ice's front-end is a treat and sets play up superbly. It tells the tale of the unfortunate sci entists'escape from the Nazi camp and their subsequent encounter with the demonic occupants of the cargo cannisters. Time runs out for them as they race to meet you, chased by the German hoardes and attacked by the denizens of the unknown. Incidentally, while most of you probably find this stuff far-fetched, bear in mind that this scenario was based on real (-ish) life events. In 1935, the Nazis created the Ahnernerbe, a division of scientists dedicated to studying certain occult acts and black magic to see if there were any practical implementations for demonic weaponary. A Typical HP Lovecraft, stuck in a stuffy museum. A Mr. Frosty and his magic lollypop gun strike again. VERDICT When the alien strikes there's not too much you can do without an incantation on you. PC CD-ROM Any fan of RPG-type games will really take to Prisoner of Ice as it's a beautifully scripted intelligent foray into the demonic world of HP Lovecraft, and therefore a little different to your average romp around a dungeon with your standard quota of Elves and other short-arsed mythical types. Prisoner also uses a very logical pattern to deduce the puz. zles so you can get through locations pretty easily. Hardened adventurers might find it's over a little too quickly, but you're saddos anyway. SIMON CLAYS crates \"Gunner Sugden! The kettle is a boilin\", screams irate Windsor Davies.

"CVG REVIEWS Platform/Puzzle Ocean Unconfirmed Out Now Mega Drive version available No other versions planned SNES putty squad Ocean offer another chance to putty your life on the line... A superb action shot here, completely ruined by the large pause message in the middle of the screen. his is a tale of glamour, of style, of high fashion. This is the tale of those jet-setting Nineties icons The Supermodels. Yes, at last Cindy C and her ilk have been transformed into a team of crack beauty consultants The Pouty Squad. Actually, sorry for getting your hopes up there, but that was just our feeble little joke. It was just our way of trying to make this game sound more interesting. It's Ocean's sequel to their much-forgotten, but pretty clever, platform puzzler Super Putty, the story of a blob of window fixative talented in the stretchy, sticky arts. And there's certainly no change on that score. Putty's main strength as a character lies not in his visual appeal (which is negligible), but in the sheer amount of stuff he can do. He's got weapons, he can morph himself around platforms, float, flatten himself and do about, ooh, three other things that we can think of straight off. The environments he's placed in mean the player has to use all these abilities to progress, and the search-and-rescue basis of the missions mean you have to explore each level fully, instead of just the usual left-to-right run through That said Putty Squad, despite the slick presentation, is lacking quite badly in atmosphere, which detracts disproportionately from the gameplay. If you're just after a fastpaced platform puzzler with plenty to keep you occupied or you liked the original, this is perfect. But don't expect Sonic-style showbiz or the depth of a Mario title. A Gasp! A deadly trump stuns both good and evil characters. VERDICT GRAPHICS 85 SOUND 83 PLAYABILITY 89 VALUE 82 OVERALL SNES I was pretty enamoured of Super Putty, so it's nice to see that it was popular enough to warrant a sequel. Which is almost the same, really. Not a bad thing particularly, but perhaps this could have been an excuse for a total revamp-fest and mega-huge levels and a new graphical style and... ooh, lots of other things they didn't do. Putty Squad is still a fine title, but one with a selective audience, methinks. RAD AUTOMATIC 84 MEGA-CD samurai shodown Beat-'em-up JVC Unconfirmed Out June Super NES.

Nowadays it takes a lot more to impress and entertain) your average games player than a couple of gaudy kabuki shaking their choppers at one another. So you might be forgiven for thinking that Samurai Shodown hasn't aged too well. And that's because it hasn't.

"CVG REVIEW Beat-'em-up Thalion .99 Out July No other versions available No other versions planned WIN! AMIGA CD32 Beat-'em-ups on the Amiga though, they're great! Er, although quite often, they're not. Come on down Thalion, your time has come... GREASERS Oughya! They don't like it up 'em, do they? hough many things, the Amiga isn't a machine with an impressive past as far as beat-'em-ups go. Yes, there have been a few corkers over the past couple of years, but, even though the CD32 offers six buttons, along with the magical media of CD, owners have generally had to be content with straight ports from A1200/5/600 releases. Until now that is... Indeed, for Thalion have decided to have a bash at something a bit different, and a jolly good bash it is! Though being a tad presentationally challenged', X-Fighter offers the player some 32 characters to fight with, being grouped into eight specific teams; Thai Boxers, Martial Artists, Bouncers, Greasers, Ninjas, Soldiers, Bounty Hunters and The Minions of Death. Apart from the various special moves that accompany each fighter, there are also 'Special Combos' which, once attained and activated, set the player on automatic pilot, running through a set sequence of moves which, when properly timed, can send your opponent home in a small brown envelope. Varied options allow for tag team bouts, as well as a 'see-saw' versus battle, where one enormous health bar \"tugs' back and forth across the screen as fortunes change. Indeed, it all sounds pretty groovy, ah, 'but what's it play like?' I hear you ask. Step this way... x fighter He flies through the air with, er... big sticks. VERDICT Not only is this fella a damn fine fighter, he also does gynastic displays! Fancy a bit of variation? Why not build yourself a team from your favourties? Gosh! So many to choose from. Can't I just have one of each in a bag? AMIGA CD32 Hmm, a right difficult one to mark and no mistakin'. X-Fighter makes up in playability and feel what It lacks in presentation and sound, but first Impressions are important to many people, and I fear it might not get the playing it deserves. Still, scratch beneath the surface and you'll find a lasting and challenging BEU to rival anything cur. rently available on the humble CD32. With this many characters to choose from, value for money certainly can't be argued with MATT BROUGHTON Cor! Special moves with a difference! Enormous fists or a vertical waterfall?

OVERALL CD32 AMIGA Super Street Fighter 2 US Gold Try to forget the ancient US Gold SF2 conversion, as this looks to be not only a competent offering, but also the first CD32 BEU to take advantage of all six buttons.

A 2012 ow, for as long as I can remember BBC Saturday morning cartoons have always been far, far, better than ITV's, so it was a great surprise when interrupting that great broadcaster and presenter, Pat Sharpe, was a quite brilliant cartoon: Animaniacs. Now the Animaniacs are about to hit the Game Boy as they did with the Mega Drive and SNES.

The game's concept is much like any other platformer, ie move boxes, jump from ledge to ledge and collect things. What makes Konami's new one that bit different though is it's a bit more interesting than your average platformer. You can take control of each of the TS three characters, and each Animaniac has their own specific ability. So Dot can throw hearts which put the baddies to sleep, Wakko has a paddle ball to attack his enemies, and Yakko has a huge wooden mallet that he uses to smash bricks and to light the fuses of bombs and cannons. To progress on to each stage you will need to use all of the three character's attributes to solve various puzzles. This is an above average platformer that will appeal to anyone who enjoys the series. A Schwing from the chandeller. UZ 200 GAME BOY There is no doubt that the Game Boy's capabilities have been utilised well on this conversion of Animaniacs. Although I'm not big on platform games Konami's latest is enjoyable, even though some of the stages are on the bland side of bla. ndness.

It's intuitive to use and looks great when you want to gloat over a cracker you've just scored. Check it. Football has really been blocking the U-bend up of late. Allegations of match fixing, crowd trouble and managers taking backhanders have all sunk footy firmly in the brown stuff. However, US Gold's latest kickabout aims to place some respect back into the game. An unchallenged header from midfield... Als he diving or has he just been run over? ootballers, to hear some of them talk it's as though they get a rough deal, negotiating between five, six or seven million pound contracts just to play the noble game. Spare a thought for the amateur who, regardless of Saturday night, braves the elements on a Sunday morning to compete against 11 other sporting heroes. The training schedule consists of 16 pints of lager and a curry followed by a serious wretching session on the morning of the game. Once at the pitch, the amateur then has to pick axe his boots from the slag heap within which they lie fossilised from a previous match, tie-up vampiric laces, that turn to dust on impact with sunlight and change into a BO-ridden undersized kit. Fortunately, US Gold have totally ignored the down sides of the amateur game and based their product on football's top-flight. More fun than simulation, Fever Pitch uses eight footballing stereotypes, all with special abilities, for you to collect as you progress through a cup competition. It's an idea that's never been tried before and it has to be said that it works very, very well. After a goal your team can enjoy some male bonding. Head out into the desert and play on sand.

A lot of games these days have two-player modes, but few of them encourage co-operation in the way Virocop does. Virocop, being a robot, is able to move in one direction whilst firing in another. In one-player mode the gun locks posi tion once it's firing, but pick the two-player simultaneous mode and it's a different story. One player controls the movement of the main body, whilst the other aims Virocop's weapons. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of 'No, ! told you to fire over there' fun. ECOLE i kids, Virocop here and I just can't wait to tell you about my new adventure! See, the evil Virons have invaded the Games Dimension and are stopping you THE KIDS from playing your favourite games. Only one good guy can save games as we know them from evil viruses, and that's me! So you better start paying me some respect, you little punks. I get so much as a look I don't like from one of you and you can kiss your precious software collection goodbye. Now listen up there's a game coming out soon. It's a kind of 3D isometric shoot-'em-up thing, and it's named Virocop, after me. Buy it. If it doesn't get to the top of the charts within a month you can just forget any chance of me doing anything to help. Risk my butt for a bunch of ungrateful wretches like you? Pah! If you think I'm doing all this out of the goodness of my heart you're sadly mistaken. I'm a top-class virus exterminator, built to clean out the insides of NASA mainframes in space, not piffling little Amigas in someone's bedroom. Look at this mounts for three different weapons.

Each of the themed levels presents the player with a whole gamut of different hazards, which bump up the variety factor as well as the difficulty.

"CVG REVIEW Shoot-'em-up Sega Unconfirmed Out June No other versions available No other versions planned 32X 3D OF A KIND Stellar Assault's 3D graphics are competent, if not that inspiring. After all the lovely texture-mapped 3D-ness of Doom and Metal Head, you can't help but feel a little let down by the sparse number of polygons which make up the enemy ships and the fact that there's almost no detail at all. It's one of the great enigmas of our industry. It's good technology, but where are the games? CVG commission special agents Muldar and Scully to probe our very own 32X-files... This is your ship. It has a big gun. It gets blown up a lot Great, eh? he 32x was forged high in the hills of Japan by the mystic monks of Pting. 'Let's make it good and let's make it look like a plastic mushroom.' Unfortunately the monks' sense of humour is the kind that makes them laugh at funerals and snigger at road accidents. So they accidentally on purpose produced just enough software to make people buy it, but not enough to keep them using it. Oh dear. And that's the 32X story so far. It's OK if you normally only buy one game every three months, but for gamehungry animals, what do you do? Well the answer seems to be keep your fingers crossed and hope. With this latest 32x offering Sega have managed to produce a good, if somewhat unspectacular, shoot-'em-up. While the game's polygon graphics are all very nice, you can't help but feel that, if Sega's claims about the 32X are true, that there should be a bit of texture mapping to liven things up and make the game seem a bit more realistic. As it is, the action can be a little plodding at times, with constant strafing runs past the bigger ships interspersed with dog fights with much smaller, and far less interesting fighters. However, the overall package comes together well and it is good fun to play, if not that fast and action-loaded. The fact remains, though, that there are better blasters on the Mega Drive. They might not have all the polygon fripperies of Stellar Assault, but they should be a lot cheaper. This is more a game for hard-core 32X enthusiasts, should there be any out there, who can stand the thought of leaving their add-on packed in the box while they sit there and wait for Virtua Fighter to be launched. This isn't quite the game every. one expected it to be. In fact it's rather dull to tell you the truth. stellare GAME BY SEGA CONTACT SEGA (0171 373 3000) FOR INFORMATION 68 "

That's football for you. A barrel of laffs, a few tears and runny, caved-in noses for several young stars. It's also about fans pouring loads of money into clubs that sell their best players while the team gets relegated and the chairman points out that, well, we've spent a bit doing the ground up. And it makes for great footy games, which is exactly what we have here. Impressions have been quiet of late. A few wargames here and there is about their lot. So we were taken even more by surprise when this turned out to be one of the most comprehensive footy management games ever pro duced. All the usual features associated with this genre are there, plus bribes, match rigging, gambling and a Sim Citytype stadium construction feature. But best of all, unlike games like Premier Manager 3, you can start in any division, managing any team with up to  million in the bank which is more than enough, once you've sold your naff players, to invest in a few star strikers and create a team that's capable of taking on the world. SPORTS NEES One of the best features of USM is the bungs option. Should you feel there's a very big match coming, or perhaps a few of your star players are injured, a quick  grand changing hands in a hotel room could well swing the result in your favour. If you're dead honest this feature can be switched off but it's fun trying it all the same. Simply being able to select a Premiership side instead of starting off with a Nothing Conf. erence League outfit was enough to keep me playing this game. Being able to manage the Arsenal and sign Le Tiss for them is superb and they actually won something. But with all the other features, plus cash bungs, this has proved itself as one of the finest football management games ever released.

Bottoms.' And by this time it's too late to turn the mine cart around and head back just for the old duffer. Still, you don't need your parents hanging around you all the time, cramping your style. Let's face it, the last thing you want when you're confronting a demon priest in an ancient Aztec pyramid is your old man faffing around doing his awkward little dance and telling everyone about the time you wet yourself after mistaking your first Fisher Price whip for a snake at age three. But surely even this embarrassment pales in comparison to the shame of appearing in your millionth platform title, an especially long fall for a movie character. But that's just what Indy's doing, reliving the glory days of his three films in this licence of the trilogy. As you might expect, each level is loosely based on a scene from one of the three flicks (obviously chronologically ordered), or is a completely made-up plot fabrication designed to explain Indy's jet-setting travel penchant. That's artistic licence for you. WHIP CRACKAWAY Indy, debonair adventurer that he is, has four ways of duffing his foes. The first, his trusty fists, are provided gratis by the game. The second, grenades, act as smart bombs. The others, his trusty whip and gun, are 'hidden' in various power-ups. Possession of the whip is a necessity as it enables Indy to swing across WU ZOSU otherwise impassible chasms, as he is doing on this rather delightful screenshot OG F50 MEGA DRIVE As a film licence, it's hard to fault Indy's latest game. It's full of digitised cut-screens and each level contains all-new hazards and play elements, and while most of them have been used before it has rarely been in this quantity. Sadly, though, Indy lacks the fluidity and solid responsiveness that a game like this needs to make it special.

Another outstanding feature of ROTT is its multiplayer mode. There are more options for net work/modem play than there has ever been for any game of this type before. There are oodles of levels, tons of game modes, and even a fair smattering of game objectives. Essentially though, it's best played when you're blasting chunks out of your mates. BUOD 08 A Two guns: much better than one. hen the games industry first saw Doom, everybody whooped, hollered and generally just flailed about. It was an event that called for much frothing at the mouth. One thing though, the papers and public panned it. This was not because it was a crappy game or anything, far from it, it was the gore level you see, there was too much of it. Little did they know that not only would it spawn a million clones, but each one was to get progressively more violent. Rise Of The Triad: Dark War is the latest, and by far the most intestine intensive. For a start the sprites in the game are more life-like, which already rings alarm bells in the 'bad taste' sector, and when they die, they DIE!!! A simple gun will produce a spray of blood, a machine gun will tear chunks off your opponents, and a heat-seeking rocket launcher will tear them limb from limb, spraying other meaty lumps across a ten-yard radius. Fantastic! The rest of the game is your basic Doom-alike kind-of affair, with one or two twists. Firstly, there's all these spring-board points scattered around the landscape that enable you (and the bad guys to much comic effect) to bounce fifty foot into the air, generally to collect a power-up. Then you've got platforms, in the shape of floating discs, allowing you to play on different levels within the same environment. It's odd, but it works... just. Oh, and I almost forgot, there's a plot too, but who cares? rise of the triad A It's no fun killing someone when you're too far away to enjoy it. OUUUUU MUS MURDER SHE DEFINITELY DIDNIT WRITE Sometimes, when you only manage to wound your opponent, they kneel in front of you beg. ging for mercy.

There are five characters you could choose, another option that makes ROTT different from other more normal Doom clones, and this is espe. cially helpful in the two-player mode. Not only that, but they do say that variety is the Schwartz Spice Rack, or something. PC CD-ROM Doom games are bril liant, there's no doubt about that, and it's very hard to cock it up when you're using the same game engine. Apogee almost did by adding the platformy stuff, giving you a cross between the most violent of the genre and Sonic. But there are so many levels (all of which are pretty well designed) and the weapons create so much havoc that I'll forgive them this once. Not only that, but watching the game enemies pogo-ing around is something everybody must see.

"REVIEW CVG Beat-'em-up JVC Unconfirmed Out June SNES version available No other versions planned MEGA-CD Sudden and inexplicable reversals of gravity are a constant worry for everyone in today's modern society. Continuing the current trend for all things retro comes this blast from the past. fatal furvan speciale hey're a talented lot that Bogard family. You can say what you like, but you can't knock the fact that the Bogards have a bigger concentration of talent in their ranks than most clans. There's Dirk Bogard, inventor of the famous assassin's knife which shares his christian name. And no one can forget Humphrey Bogard, the celebrated actor and trivertebrate dromedary. But every family tree has its bad seeds. And in the proud Royal Oak of the Bogards it's only fitting that those seeds be acoms. As seeds go Andy and Terry Bogard are large and hard, much like acorns on a seed scale of thinking. Andy and Terry, whilst admittedly talented in their own rights, are more at home with beating the fun out of pensioners than helping them across roads. As a result they're much-famed participants in the regular Fatal Fury fisticuffs tournaments which exist in Mega Drive fantasyland. These tournaments pit one mad loony against another in a best-of-three, bare-knuckle combat situation, with the winner progressing to the next scrap in the contest. This time around, thanks to the wonder that is CD technology, the brothers have been joined by some old boss-type pals and some groovy new sound effects. My, it's so hard to contan oneself in these modern times. VERDICT A Facing bankruptcy, the Flumps turn bad. UHR Andy and Terry what awe-inspiring names. HI chicks, my name's Krenktaar. Hey, come back. MEGA CD Fatal Fury CD is a bit of a deadweight on a couple of counts. Firstly, the cart version has been available for about ten billion centuries, so big FF fans will no doubt already own a copy. The second problem is that it's been almost maliciously surpassed in its field by the likes of Mortal Kombat Il and SSF2. And it's on CD, which means lots of lag time as you wait for each level, or demo, or title screen to load. Not the most advisable purchase and certainly several years too late in arriving. RAD AUTOMATIC BRUISE FROM THE FRONT Fatal Fury isn't just another Streetfighter clone, oh no. It's different. Honest. It's three-dimensional, just like Tekken. Well, not quite. Fatal Fury allows the players to jump in and out of the background (well, one layer of it). This means you can dodge any attack, or use your positional advantage to get a cheap free hit in, depending on your whims. Or alternatively, you could spend the whole game leaping in and out. A fat bloke. He should try eating fewer pies. GRAPHICS 78 SOUND PLAYABILITY 71 VALUE 86 OVERALL OTHER VERSIONS The original Neo Geo Fatal Fury is way superior, although outclassed by Fatal Fury 3 (reviewed page 56).

"CVG REVIEW Shoot-'em-up Acclaim Unconfirmed Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned Fifteen years in the wilderness for the future's Dixon of Dock Green with little media attention, then along comes Hollywood and he's on more formats than people he's shot for double parking. Well, he is the law. MEGA DRIVE, SNES, GAME BOY, GAME GEAR judgeGAME BOY udge Dredd is he rock or what? As characters go he's probably the least forgiving of all mainstream British heroes. None of your lily-livered liberal rubbish with him, smile at him at slightly the wrong angle and he'll blow your underdeveloped little 'nads right into the dusty corner of an iso-cube. Dredd hasn't always been so committed to his job. At one juncture of his gory career he got slightly tired, would you believe, of the violence and the never-ending death. So he went off into the mutant infested, war-ravaged Cursed Earth to contemplate. I always rather hoped that his illustrious career would be blighted in a far more sensational fashion. Imagine the scoop for the Mega City 1 vid-shows as old infallible Joe Dredd is caught on camera with his neoprene suit around his ankles snorting crystals of pure sugar from a mutant's cleavage while injecting himself with neat caffeine. As the Justice Department swoop, Dredd guns the Lawmaster and drives recklessly through the streets extoning the virtues of his newly found high while firing his Lawgiver like some wildeyed grinning Mexican bandit, before attempting escape by SNES kidnapping a bus full of nuns and threatening to kill one an hour unless his nefarious demands are met. A hover-pod, a billion credits, a team of female acrobat strippers and enough pure sugar and caffeine to put him into orbit are duly arranged and Dredd flies off into the sunset, like a hybrid between Harvey Keitel, Clint Eastwood and Maradona. And you know, the ridiculous thing is he could get away with it because there's no one tougher on the whole face of the planet than him. Having said that it remains to be seen whether the film will end this way, but it sounds good to me. dredd GAME GEAR NES 3 xoo 1000215 00 0001 Judge Judged GAME BOY GAME BOY Dredd looking pretty hard with his gun.

"REVIEW CUG MEGA DRIVE SNES SNES GAME BOY WHAT FRONT END? We were expecting that the SNES and Mega Drive versions would at least have a sexy front end. No such luck, what we're showing you is all you get. I guess Acclaim would say that all their efforts were put into the actual action itself. MEGA DRIVE SNES GAME GEAR GAME GEAR MEGA DRIVE coiiz SNES A It's tricky to look look hard whilst being shot in the stomach, but it's no problem for Judge Dredd. GAME BOY SNES WHAT THE LAWGIVER THE LAW TAKETH AWAY It's all very well being The Law, but hardened MC1 perps are just going to laugh in the face of your feeble Earth justice unless you've got something to back it up. Luckily you have, and it's called a Lawgiver. Like all the best instruments of authority it's a big gun which fires a variety of bullets. General Purpose shells are the most frequently used, and Dredd has an infinite supply of these. Along his travels he also picks up ammo for some different functions. Heat seekers lock on to the nearest opponent and chase them until death, ricochet missiles rebound off walls and floors without stopping (although they can knock Dredd for six if you're not careful), incendiary shots explode on impact and armour-piercing shells (the most powerful of all) kill just about everything they hit. Dredd also has access to some supplementary weapons, grenades, highexplosive missiles and double whammy' missiles, all of which are grades of smart bomb, and Boing bubbles, used for imprisoning the smokey immortal spirits of the Dark Judges.

"CVG REVIEW MEGA DRIVE Ooi SNES This is you, AKA Joe Dredd. And you're standing there, looking all hard. Grrrr. What a man. dredd SNES TD0965 VERDICT SNES MEGA DRIVE Stand by doors and look hard in Judge Dredd. VERDICT GAME BOY You can even look hard whilst teetering like a girl on the edge of a barrel. GAME BOY Obviously the Game Boy isn't exactly suited to cope with the finer points of a game like this, so the portable Nintendo version of Judge Dredd is more action-orientated than its 16-bit siblings. However, it's also much slower, in both running speed and the pace of play, and this is definitely to its detriment. And sadly the Game Boy just can't produce the atmosphere required to offset this. It's not terrible, but there are better examples of the genre available. Try Capcom's Metroid instead. RAD AUTOMATIC VERDICT GAME GEAR SNES Judge Dredd is an excellent use of the licence in all respects. The central Dredd character behaves as you'd expect and has a repertoire of (usually violent) moves which stay faithful to the comics. It's also unlikely that Dredd would really work as a game without the masses of material lifted from both the books and the movie. But as it stands, it's pretty ace. Atmospheric, challenging and even a wee bit original, Dredd should keep most people happy, even if the action does lag at some points. RAD AUTOMATIC ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE/SNES Alien 3 Probe/.99 Another cracking film licence, Alien 3 mixes tons of hardcore blas. torama action with amazing levels of rock hardness and hugeosity plus the sound's lifted from the movie. A classic. ISSUE 139: 94% GRAPHICS 70 SOUND 67 PLAYABILITY 69 VALUE 65 VERDICT MEGA DRIVE GAME GEAR Obviously you can't expect the same of the handheld versions as their 16-bit counterparts. The Game Gear version is much more straightfor. ward than the SNES or Mega Drive versions and much more geared towards action. That doesn't blight it though, because the Game Gear version is a quality product containing plenty of thrills, spills and shoot'em-up frolics. In fact, as far as Game Gear prod. ucts go, this is actually one of the best the machine's ever seen. Well worth a blast.

By Gandalf's trouser staff its DM2, and its got nothing to do with two 14-hole boots formally worn by skinheads now adopted as a standard fashion accessory for a generation. A Don't you just love the English weather they always put in these RPG's? Wow! Aren't stats screens good? ungeon Master what a classic, back in 1985 you just couldn't fault it. Take a party of stereotyped Tolkien rejects down into a labyrinth of tunnels, puzzles and angry, bored monsters. It didn't matter that all the characters were, in hindsight, stereotypes because at least that little dwarf fellow off the cartoon, the dungeon master, wasn't there to annoy you. Did anyone ever notice what a total spazzy waste of time he was and, considering he knew exactly what the crack was, did absolutely sod all to help the beleaguered party except to offer some cryptic crap or other? If I was one of those spoilt American kids who metamorphosised into a knight or something that pint-sized gargoyle would be the first one for the chop. Anyway, we digress because the important thing is the game. It's sad, the RPG that moulded every adventure subsequently, hasn't moved forward or even sideways for that matter. With so much competition from fifth generation versions, DM2 feels as though it's been lost in one of its own mazes for ten years only to emerge old, grey and past it. master EU TIDOS VERDICT This beautiful self-assembly fondue table can be yours from Ikea for only .99. MEGA-CD Dungeon Master invented the control system and gaming style that nearly every RPG has mimicked since. Its Interaction of on-screen events, realtime fighting and use of magic have all been copied and hybridised to death. Apart from clever monsters and the odd feature everything looks and plays the same as its predecessor.

"REVIEW CVG SNES Sports Virgin Unconfirmed Out July No other versions available CD 32 version planned One day the world will be controlled by the legions of golf games. Save us. 230D A Oh my god!

A You know, you could just have a nice sunbathe. irds do it, bees do it, even Beastie Boys' Mike Ds do it let's do it, let's play some golf. So sang Frank Sinatra, and, given his heavy mafia connections, we're not about to argue in case he has US shot. In fact, we're just going to take up the sport ourselves, just to show a bit of solidarity with ol' no-teeth. But being lazy square-eyed gameplayers we can't be bothered with all that walking about, fresh air and exercise business. No, we're just going to play a computer game of golf in the comfort of our luxurious offices. The game in question is World Masters Golf. It offers a choice of four courses, from the nice sedate greeny one to the mega-rock beach course of sand traps and tidal pools. You can take part in a tournament (against other human players if you like), or you can just faff about practising forever. As with most games of this ilk these days there's a whole gaggle of course fly-bys before each shot (so you know where to hit the ball) and after (so you can see how miserably you performed), along with the usual array of stats designed to show you up for the worthless cur that you are. And numerous small holes, generally found on the greens. world masters golf MORE POWER! VERDICT A That's a pretty good shot. Very well done. I 175 A Some sort of abstract impressionist landscape. SNES I can't say that I think World Masters is particularly bad. But you can't deny that it's remarkably similar to almost every other golf game on the market. The power meter, the course maps, the close-ups of the green, the variety of clubs, it's all alarmingly familiar. The SNES might not have many outstanding golfing titles, but despite the variety of courses on offer and the challenge presented by them, World Masters doesn't exactly rectify this situation. For major Pringle fans only. RAD AUTOMATIC A Trees. The lungs of the world, or so scientists believe. Hey golf game fans guess how you take your shots in World Masters. Why, that's right, with a power bar. Press the shot button once and the meter shoots towards the left shot line. Press it again and the bar moves back to the right. The idea is to stop the bar right on the maximum potential lines for a long, straight shot, or stop things earlier for less power or a curled shot. Obviously your choice of club affects the performance of both the shot bar and the thwack itself. DO A Looks like a pretty straightforward putt.

"CD32 CVG REVIEW Strategy Mindscape | .99 Out July Amiga. PC CD-ROM, SNES and Jaguar versions available No other versions planned Missions tend to involve either killing or 'persuading' someone to join your syndicate. That's kidnapping to the thickies out there. There's no lottery winners but still big stakes on offer in Bullfrog's classic cyberpunk strategyfest... et in a miserable cyberpunk future Syndicate's plot revolves around a number of mega corporations, or Syndicates as they're known. These guys are far more powerful than, and have long since replaced, governments, but crave still more power and so in a Risk-stylee set out to destroy each other. The syndicates are still companies at heart though and don't want to risk offending their product audience, ie the general public. Therefore missions must be carried out covertly as the player takes control of up to four cyborg spies drugged to obey orders as they carry out assassinations, kidnaps and other unsavoury acts. The game window fills about 75% of the screen, with the rest taken up by a scanner which keeps track of the player's cyborgs, enemy spies and civilians plus another four windows which represent the cyborgs' stats. Things become increasingly vicious as time wears on so funds can be ploughed into research to develop stronger cyborg body parts and more destructive weapons. Special mention has to go to the flame thrower. You haven't lived until you line up a number of weak, pathetic civilians and toast them to the accompaniment of great sampled screams. A ha ha, extreme power is mine! ALTERNATIVE SNES Cannon Fodder Virgin/.99 Plenty of death and blood in this vintage Sensi outing and a few Syndicate style puzzles to boot. Most essential. ISSUE 157: 90% The aim is to conquer the world and the final battle takes place on that artificial island in the Atlantic Ocean. Here you can see that I've conquered Europe and the next mission will be in a territory directly opposite my border. VERDICT Invest funds in researching new and more destructive weapons. TEAM SELECTION A Total carnage! The missions in this CD32 conversion are the same as the original Amiga and PC versions rather than those featured in the Mega Drive and SNES games. CD32 The game engine in Syndicate has dated badly and the graphics are hard on the eye, even when played through an SVGA monitor.

But only if you've got a CD-ROM... pyros It's all gone rather strange, blocky and it has to be said... square. hink about the future... imagine piloting a starfighter along twisting tunnels at fantastic speeds. Picture blowing up countless alien ships, rescuing stranded humans, and making huge amounts of wonga. If this sounds like your idea of fun, then read on. In the future, information on alien life forms is the most valuable commodity around, with big corporations willing to pay top whack to anyone willing to retrieve it. Obviously, nothing in life is easy and if a Runner (the name given to data retrieval specialists) wants to take a company's money, then they've got to expect a few difficulties. The first problem is that the info is stashed away in some pretty inaccessible places like the cores of dead stars), and the second problem is that these star cores are protected by a large number of very, very nasty alien cyborgs called Adherents that are programmed to defend this knowledge at all costs. Take control of a ship flying through a 3D maze environment, blow up everything that comes near you, rescue some humans who are stranded and collect the information from the core... oh yes, and get out of there pronto. There are eight weapons at your disposal, ranging from mere grenades (which kill enemies that are hiding behind corners) to a heavy laser (which blows up everything but it's very slow to recharge). . Watch that you don't touch the edges, only it doesn't do ya much good. VERDICT PC CD-ROM The first word that springs to mind when you start playing this game is 'Descent, and the game is very similar to the Interplay classic in both graphics and playing style. But it lacks that magical quality that made Descent so playable. The graphics are smooth and colourful, but you don't quite get the feeling of being there' that you get with Descent.

"CVG REVIEW Platform Adventure US Gold .99 Out Now Mega Drive, SNES, Amiga and PC versions available No other versions planned 3DO flashback Another 16-bit classic makes its weary way on to the 3DO... IT'S ALL LOOKING DIFFERENT HERE NOW... The only noticeable difference to the earlier versions of Flashback are the slick cut scenes and full motion video intro, which are of course up to the high standard you'd expect of a 3DO game, especially one done by the likes of Delphine. A I'm inclined to agree with you, it does look much like any other version. tep back in Time' as that rather diminutive little Ozzie, who's now performing high kicks in Street Fighter, once sang (and more embarrassingly remember it); or more to the point flashback in time to when we first saw this kind of fluid rotoscoping animation on our gaming screens. Well it was many earth moons ago, especially if you think of its predecessor: Another World. Flashback is certainly the best of the three though, and certainly a worthy game (the last version we reviewed was the Mega Drive one and that scored a triumphant 94 percentages). For those gamers who're unaware of what the whole shebang's about though, let us digress, briefly... Conrad Hart's your man, and the story goes that he's a secret agent who's been kidnapped by aliens (who were posing as politicians) and has been taken back to a hostile planet. Hart's memory has been erased, and it's his job is to find it, escape the planet and return to earth and expose the aliens. The 3D0 Conrad sprite has all the manoeuvrability that his counterparts had, and the backgrounds look as lush as ever. Where the 3DO version excels however is the sound, it's so crisp and the samples are trés realistic, especially the gun shots. Not forgetting of course the cut scenes, which on our Panasonic player look particularly handsome you know. VERDICT 300 Al like Conrad's crouch (no, I said crouch!). Do 3DO owners feel like they've bought a refur. bished Mega Drive or SNES. I mean who wants age-old games on a 3DO? We've seen the games the 3DO is capable of: The Need for Speed, Return Fire and FIFA, all of which showed off its capabilities well. While Flashback is impressive, it's arrived late in the day on 3DO. If someone's upgraded from a SNES or Mega Drive they've seen this game yonks ago and no amount of FMV or clear, crispy CD sound is gonna make them shell out the readies for this. GARY LORD In the future people will wear purple trousers. Nice little spot effects, don'tcha fink?

VERDICT Fores TH 2018 A Arms and opium fetch the best prices but be sure you reach a port that offers a good rate. A1200 Impressions' games tend to be heavy going, treekilling manual fests, but High Seas Trader is easier to get into than many of their titles. Watching your balance surge from lugging cheap goods from one port and flogging them for a profit at another is very satisfying, as is spotting emerging trends. Unfortunately there's a lack of variety, with many of the locations looking similar and little in the way of new commodities to discover. Overall though High Seas Trader is a competent sim, if a little repetitive. RIK SKEWS Calculating Autocomot Avoid the areas marked with skull and crossbones. These are the known locations of vicious pirates. Treat the crew badly too often and you'll find your self walking the plank. Gulp, where's my flippers?

Movie fever continues to infest the dotmatrixed flipper-frenzied world of the pinball table, as Midway announce another licence tie-in. Based around the plot of the Shadow movie, Bally claim to have recreated the tension of good battling evil with flippers, ramps and digitised dialogue from the soundtrack courtesy of stars Alec Baldwin and Tim Curry. Let's just hope that the pinball table has more thrills than the movie, which shouldn't be too hard. ONDE Jaleco's latest footy title could be set to revolutionise arcade sport as we know it. World Cup PK Soccer is a penalty competition with a difference because you actually have to boot a punchbag to shoot. When it reaches our hazy arcade emporiums it'll be you against a 40-inch monitor and a goalie. The system works by asking you to kick a bag which responds to different strengths and angles to produce your shot on-screen. Really catch it right and you'll trigger off one of six 'Super Shots' which will leave the keeper completely 'Grobelaar-d', catch it wrong and it's head in hands à la Chrissie Waddle. We've yet to play PK Soccer but judging from the way it's been designed it's going to be a tall order for left footers to get a decent shot in without being fouled by the side of the cabinet. Now That's Magic. Mua More pinball frolics from Midway in the shape of Theatre of Magic. Based loosely around the dusty old music halls, Theatre of Magic features some revolutionary new features like the Spirit Ring which will divert your ball from one ramp to another or the Magician's Trunk which will capture your ball and feed it to the haunted basement. Available about now Theatre of Magic is geared for the novice and pro alike. You Talkin' to Me? CEAIRE MAGIONE Coin-Op Hero or Sad Retard Pinball fans will shortly be able to shoot ramps and flip flippers with none other than Robert De Niro, courtesy of Sega Pinball. Their latest incarnation is an adaptation of Kenneth Branagh's movie version of Mary Shelley's gothic novel, Frankenstein. The table features Sega's new high-definition dot-matrix screen which is twice the size of any other currently available, plus there's music and sampled speech from the movie. Without a shadow of a doubt the crowning glory will be the miniature monster version of Bob! He even throws the ball back at you like some psychotically possessed extra from Punch and Judy on acid as he mumbles speech from the movie. In fact, he looks more like Phlidenstein than Frankenstein. While Sega's pinball division continues to impress we're waiting with baited breath for a Taxi Driver pinball where shooting all five of Harvey Keitel's fingers off gives you a bonus multiplier.

"CVG Q & A KILLER CONSOLES HELP! IS NEO GEO CD FOR ME? Dear CVG. 1. What would you buy out of the following: a PC (with CD-ROM). Play Station or Saturn taking the price into consideration? CVG: If you're considering price then I'd wait until the official launch of the Play Station and buy one. At the moment I'd get a PC. 2. What's best out of Toh Shin Den. Virtua, Fighter 1 or 2. Tekken. Killer Instinct and Primal, Rage? CVG: Tekken and Virtua Fighter 2. Killer Instinct is good but still third. 3. Do you think Ridge Racer 2 is worth .50 for about two minutes of play? CVG: Not really, but then I remember paying 10p a game in arcades so maybe I'm just being an old fart. 4. Any chance of Dark Forces, Tie Fighter, X Wing or Doom/Doom 2 appearing on the Saturn or Play Station? CVG: Doom's probably too old now and it would probably be too difficult to fit all the buttons in from Tie Fighter and X Wing on to the PlayStation's joypad. Doom 2 and Dark Forces are likely conversions though. 5. What games will be packaged with the PlayStation? CVG: Ridge Racer or Toh Shin Den are the most likely bets, 6. Any news on Secret of Mana 2 because I've finished the first and can't wait. I hope the ending is better though. CVG: Hmm, according to who you believe Chrono Trigger was supposed to be Mana 2 but that's open to some debate. No news on Mana 3 yet but it's unlikely to see the light of day before the summer at the earliest. 7. Will there be a sequel to International Superstar Soccer? CVG: Yep, a sequel will hit the SNES at the end of the year. A PlayStation conversion of the original is also planned, John Meloin, Somewhere Dear Help! 1. Apart from cost, why didn't SNK make the Neo Geo CD quad speed? CVG: You've answered your own question. When SNK were designing the NEO GEO CD, quad speed drives were a lot more expensive than they are now. 2. Are the CD games any different from the carts? CVG: NEO CDs tend to have more cutscenes and anims as well as the original coin-op music on CD audio. 3. Which is better. Art of Fighting 2 or Samurai Shodown 2? CVG: Tough call but personally I prefer Art of Fighting 2, but at the end of the day they re both top beat-'em-ups. 4. Is it advisable to sell my Neo Geo and buy the CD sys tem? CVG: No, SNK have insisted it will continue to produce titles for Neo carts as well as the new CD machine, K Murray, Glasgow MISERABLE SEGA FAN Stuck in the technical syrup that is hardware, games and techie-type questions? Fear not because HELP! is here with a ladder and rope to rescue you. So whatever's bothering you, fire it our way at the usual address (see Contents pages). Pronto. Dear CVG I am a disillusioned Sega owner fed up with escalating, cartridge prices and have decided to defect to the 300 I am really keen to buy a US NTSC unit for so that I can have a full screen picture and extra speed, but I need answers to a few questions first: reab 1. NTSC uses less lines on screen than PAL. Does this mean that I would be sacrificing graphical detail for speed? CVG: Not really. The graphics themselves remain the same, they are simply displayed at a lower resolution It's definitely worth it for the full screen image though, 2. Can the 3D0 be connected to a hi-fi system at the same time as to a SCART TV? CVG: Yep, no probs there. 3. I am going to buy SSF2 X. FIFA and Need for Speed with the console. What other games (apart from the forthcoming Doom) are worth buying? CVG: Theme Park. Return Fire and Road Rash spring to mind. 4. Would you advise buying the SNES joypad adaptor or a proper six button pad for use on SSF2 X (and other games)? CVG: Put it this way, what would you rather have the most responsive and comfortable joypad ever designed or any of the crap lumps of plastic available for the 3DO? 5. Any chance of Dark Forces on 3DO? CVG: Quite possibly yes. Norman Jobling, Glos 13.36 A 106 "


"Q&A CVG AMIGA NEWS Dear CVG. About a year ago I sold my Amiga 600 to buy an A1200, but because of the lack of them in production I decided to buy a CD32 instead. I like football and football management games but these are non existent on this machine so I am thinking of buying an SX-1 module to enable me to play these games again. With this in mind could you please answer the following questions: BOOKEOFF DAGENHAM CVG: Yep. 4. Is the SX-1 easy to get hold of?, CVG: It's fairly scarce in the shops but well supported at mail order level, try Silica or Special Reserve for instance. 5. How much would everything cost? CVG: Shop around but an SX-1, keyboard disk drive and mouse should come to no more than . 6. Would I be better off selling my CD32 and waiting for the A1200 to be produced again? CVG: Yes, it doesn't look like Escom, the purchasers of Commodore are going to sup, port the CD32, only the A4000, A1200, A600 and, get this, the C64! Retro rules. 7. Do you know when the A1200 is going to be back in the shops? CVG: Escom have said they are going to start manufacturing the A1200, A4000 and A600 as soon as possible, so about three months seems likely. David Willson, Birmingham HORDSHORT 1. Does the SX-1 do the same job as an A1200? CVG: Yep. but you need to buy all the addi tional extras like a keyboard and external disk drive. 2. Can you use an ordinary PC keyboard which you can get for  instead of spend ing  on a CD32 keyboard? CVG; If it's PC80 yes, otherwise no. 3. Is there a printer port on the back of the SX-1? RICH PC OWNER Dear Help! Recently I bought a CD-ROM with three games: Wing Commander 3. Theme Park and Magic Carpet. I'm doing well on Theme Park and WC3 but am finding Magic Carpet difficult, so could you answer these questions because I know you'll be able to HELP! MORE JAG ISSUES 1. Can you recommend any helpful hints or cheats for Magic Carpet? CVG: Make sure you play it on a Pentium! Ho ho. But seriously, we printed a big tip on it a couple of months back so have a look through your back issues or give our back issues department a call on 01858 468888 if you haven't got it. 2. Are the games I've bought are a good choice? CVG: Most definitely. 3. My CD-ROM is double speed, do you think it's worth upgrading to quad? CVG: Not at the moment. Double speed drives will probably remain the dominant standard for about another year simply because there's so many of them out there. 4. I want a footy game but I don't know which to choose from Sensi. FIFA or Action Soccer? CVG: Sensi's control is a bit iffy on PC so it I'd have to recom mend FIFA at the mo'. Action Soccer isn't out yet but looks promising 5. I'm thinking about getting a driving sim so could you say what you think is the best (most enjoyable, lasting) out of Super Karts and Micro Machines 2? CVG: No competition, it has to be Micro Machines 2. Chris Davies, Aylesbury Dear Help 1. Is Fight For Life better than Toh Shin Den or Virtua Fighter? CVG: Nope. 2. Do you think the Jaguar CD is worth buying? CVG: We haven't seen any finished software for it yet so it's difficult to make a decision. 3. Will FIFA International Soccer ever come out on the Jaguar? CVG: There's a good chance that FIFA '96 will make an appearance next year. 4. What exactly does the virtual reality head set on the Jaguar do? CVG: It will play VR games, eventually that is. 5. Is Cannon Fodder for the Jag any good? CVG; Yep, it's a spot on conversion. 6. Is the Jaguar more powerful than the Ultra 64? CVG: No way. Ben Reading, Middlesex HELP GIMMIE SOME JAG ADVICE WINS:00 Dear CVG. I have just bought a Jaguar with Cybermorph and have a few questions... 1. Will Monkey Island come out for it? CVG: Nope. 2. Which game do you recommend I buy next? CVG: Doom, without a doubt. 3. When will MK3 come out on the Jaguar and how much will it cost? CVG: Early '96, around . 4. What's the best two player game out at the moment? CVG: Sega Rally in the arcades. On the Jag it will probably be Sensible Soccer. 5. How much will the VR headset cost when it comes out? CVG: Around  (it's $250 in the States), Ollie Brummell, Leicester MK3 will be out on the Jag in early '96, but check out the latest Atari beat-'em-up, Ultra Vortex, on page 41. 107 "

Simply hold down all the buttons on both of the pads and start a game as normal. This will select the blood code and enable you to see plenty of red splashes every time you hack into an opponent. Hurrah! 108 "


"TIPS CVG PC GAME BOY JAZZ JACKRABBIT If you want a painless way of accessing the bonus level in this shareware classic try going to the world select screen, pressing the UP arrow and then ENTER. Easy when you know how or are Stevie Evershed from Sidcup. WARIO BLAST Another Initiative of the Month award goes direct to lan Godfrey from South Lancashire for realising that Hudson Soft's frequently used 5656 code also works in Bomber... sorry Wario Blast. Entering the code will take you to a battle game where the aim for Bomberman is simply to survive for as long as possible and take as many baddies as possible down with him. Go for it bomber dude! MEGA DRIVE FIFA '95 If you're a real crapster when it comes to playing FIFA then try entering A, B, C, A, B and C on the options screen. This should make the opposition so crap that even your mum should be able to score herself a goal! SNES SPARKSTER So you reckon you're one mean gameplayer huh? In that case try entering LEFT, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP, DOWN, UP, A, and X on the title screen and you'll be able to play a super tough cookie version of the game which is nearly as tough as Probotector's easy level! Ta muchly to Sam Beeches from Ireland for sharing that one with us. SNES SUPER METROID Here's a couple of codes from Mancunian Simon Pritchard that should make travelling through the large world of Nintendo's Super Metroid a tad easier. BRES RES! 17 DUO 7EOA 7780 Gives sexy Samus the super powerful hypa beam right from the start of the game. 7E09 A3CO This provides Samus with the grappling hook and X-Ray vision to make finding those hidden items a breeze. AMIGA IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2025 Poor old John Thorn down in Redhill was unfortunate enough to buy this insult to the Epyx classic, but at least he can console himself by accessing a perfect conversion of the oldie version via the title screen. Clearly John's been too busy playing the 2025 version though, since it's that game for which he's supplied these comprehensive codes. GAME GEAR Car Park: Office Zone: Industrial: Computer Centre: Construction Area: ETQFJXXD EXQEJXDC FBQDDXRE FFQCVXIA FNQAYXHI FRQYCXVL FYQOPXEF GKQJYXDI GOQJFXBK THE JUNGLE BOOK It's level select time for this spot-on handheld conversion of the 16-bit platform smash. To access it turn on your Game Gear, wait for the Disney logo to disappear and push UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT. You'll hear a ping and once you press START the level select option will be all yours. Ta to Chris Price from Clacton on Sea, Essex for sending that in. GSQFDXZA 109 "


"CVG TIPS 3DO cheat mode SUPER STREET FIGHTER 2 TURBO X If you want to play Akuma against the computer then the code to do so is exactly the same as it is in the arcade. Should you wish to play him in a versus affair then press and hold all buttons until Akuma's shadow appears on the character select screen, and then select him as normal. Cheers again to DB for that one. MEGA CD 32X CLIFFHANGER If you've been unfortunate to buy this steaming pile of shoddy software (try reading our reviews next time eh?) and it's been gathering dust in your draw ever since dig it out once more for this tidy little level select sent in from Richard Warr. Using pad two on the title screen press START, C, B, A, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT and LEFT. If all's well then you should be able to skip levels by pressing C on pad 1. Done that? Good. Now curse the game and cast it back into your drawer for all eternity. MORTAL KOMBAT II Remember the test mode' code that we printed for the Mega Drive version of Mortal Kombat Il a couple of months back? You know, the one that gives you all sorts of options like 'one hit kills' and the infamous 'Fergalities\"? If so you'll be pleased to know that exactly the same code works on the 32X version of the game. If you've forgotten how to enter the code it goes like this: highlight 'done' on the options screen and move the pad left, down, night, right, down, left, left, left, left, right, right and right. Now move the joypad down and there should be an option to enter the test mode. Thanks to Darren Russell in Bromley for that piece of cheat-testing initiative.

"CVG REVIEWS Out no OK, here's the best games from the last two months, and if you're particularly sad, you can glance across the page to the charts and see how many games we tipped for the top made it. carts carts carts IFEVER PITCH INFL THAGANE QUARTERBACK carts carts ISUPER TURRICAN 2 IWAYNE GRETZKY ALL-STARS 32X issue 163 88% SNES issue 162 91% SNES issue 162 190% Despite being more than a little dated, this game is a worthy clone of such esteemed titles as Probotector and, indeed, the previous Turrican. It's tough, fast and action-packed with a decent variety of levels and features. MEGA DRIVE issue 163 88% It takes a big game to go up against the mighty hocky-master of EA's NHLPA, but Gretzky is a more than worthy challenger. And it's got good punch-ups in it too something which EA bottled out of for several versions of their game. SNES issue 163 88% Although this isn't a proper football sim, with US Gold going for a much more arcadey game, it's still a good laugh. As you progress through tournaments your team collects new players each with special moves. This is a major improvement over the original Mega Drive version. The graphics are larger, sound better and it plays really well. A few features have been lost in translation, but fortunately the game doesn't suffer becuase of it. Like Super Turrican 2, this is very much an attempt to return to the glory days of gaming. For difficulty it just has the edge over the Ocean platformer, but for sheer rock-hardness there's very little around that comes close. carts ITHEME PARK carts ITHE FIREMEN co ITEKKEN DAYTONA IFLIGHT UNLIMITED SNES issue 162 93% PLAYSTATION issue 163 97% SATURN issue 163 96% Strut bas MEGA DRIVE issue 162 91% With this remarkable conversion, Bullfrog have managed to retain almost all the features which made the PC original such a winner. The only thing it lacks is a battery-save, which means you keep having to start from scratch. Fire is your enemy. Remember, an overfull chip-pan is bad news kids. So play it safe play Firemen. This novel shoot-'em-up is one of the brightest sparks the SNES has seen all year, so it's well worth trying to track it down. This is, hand on heart, probably the best fighting game released on any format ever! Its superb graphics and, amazingly, innovative gameplay and controls make this a priority purchase for any PlayStation owner. Although not visually as striking as the PlayStation's Ridge Racer, Daytona certainly has more of an edge on the Namco game when it comes to playability. Fast and more furious than a very fat bloke on an extremely mean diet. PC CD-ROM issue 163 95% Just check out the visuals this is a game which really does play as well as it looks. There isn't any shooting, but you're guaranteed to be sitting at the controls of the most realistic, detailed flight simulation every released. CO handheld IFULL THROTTLE ISLAM AND JAM *95 floppy IMORTAL KOMBAT II floppy ISUPER SF2 TURBO IMICRO MACHINES 2 PC CD-ROM issue 163 91% 3DO issue 163 92% LucasArts have come up trumps yet again, with what's possibly their best adventure game to date. The characterisation is superb, as is the plot and gameplay. If you've loved their previous stuff, you'll wet yourself over this. This is the first step forwards for basketball games in a long time and it's so good you don't even have to like the sport to enjoy it. The graphics are massive and well animated, which contributes greatly to the gameplay. 1PC issue 162 93% For a whole month until Super Streetfighter 2 was launched, this was the best combat game on PC. Despite not quite being able to match up to SF2, this is still a topnotch conversion, featuring everything which made the coin-op a hit. PC issue 163 95% This is probably the best conversion of Streetfighter 2 Turbo to hit any machine and that's even taking into account the PC's lack of decent controllers. If this is your type of game, you won't find anything better than this. GAME GEAR issue 163 96% There hasn't been a bad version of this game yet and Codemasters have kept that tradition alive with this latest incarnation. It's in twoplayer link-up mode, but don't let that put your off what is still one of the best Gear games. 112 "
