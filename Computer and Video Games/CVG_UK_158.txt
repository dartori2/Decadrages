The Virtual Boy is a RISC-based 32BIT system which uses two high-res LED screens to produce the virtuality effect. The console also utilises a special double-handed controller to facilitate movement in keeping with realistic laws of spatial geometry. The system is priced at $199 in the US, with software weighing in at a suspiciously low $50 and below. Sounds too good to be true? Well, if the unveiling ceremony is anything to go by, you could be right. Apparently the system doesn't really offer the true 3D freedom of existing arcade VR systems, and the graphics appear only in red on black (as you might expect using LED screens as opposed to LCD). Nintendo foreVIRTUAL BOY cast sales of three million Virtual Boys and fourteen million VB carts within a year of launch (first machines hit Japanese shelves in April), but unless the finished software is of a far superior quality than that on display in Tokyo this seems a rather optimistic target. toy a 'virtual' version BT postpone games channel of the Game Boy...

NET SOME SAVINGS NEW 3DO BY APRIL SIM MONEY SPIN Goldstar has announced its launch plans for its version of the 3DO Multiplayer in the UK this April. Although the technical specifications of the machine are identical to the Panasonic console, Goldstar is allegedly trying to release it at a more competitive price. We can but hope. Meanwhile the 3DO Company has reported world-wide sales in excess of 250,000. Compared to established formats this really is a drop in a very big ocean. However, for a relatively high-price console in an uncertain market the results must be viewed as very satisfying. It's been a while since it debuted, but Sim City 2000 isn't finished yet. By the time you read this the A1200 and PC CD-ROM versions of the game should be on the shelves, with a Windows version to follow shortly. Also on its way is SCURK.

His moves, however, are a bit, well, normal when compared to the other combatants. 30 240 FIGHTER fighting in the third dimension 19 999 he last machine to generate so much interest in this office was the arrival of one of the first Famicoms in the UK, compropaganda designed to get you unnecessarily excited about a piece of new kit the Saturn has fulfilled its potential, delivering a knockout blow to the 16-bit gaming systems and sending people scurrying off to the bank to check their balance. Virtua Fighter impresses without resorting to graphics streamed off a CD and with out packing a disc full of cutscenes you'll invariably skip past. It's a genuine example of the capabilities of this system. Something made all the more impressive as it bucks the trend of debut games on new systems turning out to be utter tosh, and was produced in a rush, with a deadline that was pulled forwards so the system would have a big-name title to be released with. You're probably familiar with Virtua Fighter the secthis really is something else. What Virtua Fighter represents is $15,000 worth of arcade kit reproduced almost blow-for-blow on an (eventually) affordable home machine. This isn't magazine ond offspring of Sega's recently formed AM2 development department (also check the review of VF 2 on pages 86/87). It combined cutting edge arcade technology with motion capture techniques and some excellent gameplay design. The result was a game that wasn't Street Fighter. People appreciated it and Virtua Fighter went on to become one of the most popular coin-ops of the year. Obviously the graphics are a major draw for this game. No matter how many times we play Virtua Fighting on the new Saturn, we still can't quite get used to the realism of the moves or the smoothness of the 3D. But it isn't all visuals. Backing up the polygon protagonists is some great gameplay, with each fighter having his or her own particular style to master, which adds depth to the gameplay and hours of experimental button pushing as you try to work out the special attacks. The Saturn may be too dear for most people while it's on import, but if you've been sitting on the proverbial fence waiting to see what the finished article was capable of, you'll be sorely tempted to part with the pounds when you see this. RUCK 'N' ROLL Time your attacks right and you can devastate an opponent in just two hits. A throw followed by a hefty stamp to the face is normally enough to knock the stuffing out of anyone. This is made all the better by the realistic movement of the characters, something which is made possible thanks to the use of motion-capture techniques. Here real people are filmed performing fighting moves, digitised, then points plotted on the joints and limbs and the results used to form the skeleton of the polygonbased characters. You really have to see it moving to appreciate just how good it really looks. "

"CVG SATURN OUT OF THIS WORLD? SEGATURN Already thinking about buying a Saturn? Well read this before you reach for the cheque book... So You Want A Saturn SEGASATURN ou've probably read the Virtua Fighter review by now and are drooling great globs of spit all over these pages we've worked so hard to create. But we understand, and that's because we have a Saturn, and you're probably thinking of buying one too. Firstly, the machine is most definitely not compatible with the Mega Drive, although the cartridge slot could one day become the home of a converter should Sega feel the need. The access time from the CD seems very good, although as most of Virtua Fighter runs from RAM we'll reserve judgment on just how fast it is until we've seen a few more titles. However, there's still no news as to whether an import machine will be able to run official games. No doubt some clever bod will invent an import-busting device, but there's always a chance they won't... We are very impressed with the machine as it stands, although like most things we'll have to wait and see what the future releases are like before we can make any predictions as to how well the machine will do. There's no doubt about its potential, though, it isn't just a souped-up 32X. The Saturn is one of the most impressive machines to debut in many years. The Saturn isn't compatible with Mega Drive joypads, so you'll have to make do with the eight-button affair that comes with the machine. Although it feels a little cheaply made, it's more responsive than the old Mega Drive pads and very comfortable to hold. PAYING THE PRICE The good news is that there's an option which switches the console's menus into English, however, that won't affect most games. Still, many of the first SNES titles were perfectly playable in Japanese. The clincher when it comes to actually buying a Saturn is the price. You can expect to pay anything between - for one at the moment, which is pretty hefty for a machine which costs  in Japan. Still, when it's released officially over here, what with the EU's wonderful import tax where they'll class the machine as a video recorder and whack a load on the price. We estimate it will retail for between  and  officially, unless Sega suddenly unveil plans to manufacture it in Europe which is highly unlikely. If you definitely want to buy a machine contact Andrew Blumson on 0370 314255 who should be able to point you in the right direction (don't hassle him if you're not serious). Alternatively, try your hand in our Saturn compo on page 120 of this issue. 20 "

Actually, thinking about it, perhaps SeaQuest and Star Trek do have something in common after all. That is to say it's about a dedicated self-sacrificing crew scouring uncharted depths for the benefit of mankind. Something which the two serials also have in common is that SeaQuest DSV is now the basis for a new Super NES title, as is Star Trek with Interplay's Star Trek Academy. Anyway, the idea is you play a rookie recruitSEAQUEST type aspiring to the command of the SeaQuest DSV submarine and all the little mini-vehicles (a bit like in Thunderbirds) which are carried in the belly of said submersible. In order to get this far you first have to pass a number of test missions on blue waters of the world prothe SeaQuest simulator and moting peace and harmony then rendezvous with the and all that over a lengthy craft itself once you're series of sub-missions.

A Meet Jim in the Gym. Jim is known as Giant Jim by his friends. Like a scene from Terminator 2, you can go one on one with a policeman in a steelworks. As you are wandering around the United States looking for trouble, where else are you going to fight but in front of Mount Rushmore? A If you want, you can play an armed character, but don't think that this will make much difference to the odds. A If you could fight like Neil Axe, you'd probably end up in bar brawls too. he Amiga has always been a bit of a novice when it comes to beat 'em-ups, with the passable Street Fighter 2 conversion and Team 17's Body Blows being the only ones of note to appear in the last couple of years. Millenium is trying to put paid to that at the moment though, with its newest licence, Neil Axe. Neil, one of this country's leading martial arts experts, is a Kung Fu teacher who believes in selling the art of discipline and skill over combat skills (yeah, right), and that is something that he is trying to reflect in this single player beat em up. You play Neil or one of three other fighters, each with a different combat skill, as they trudge around the US of A looking for the perfect fight. Each new location brings a harder opponent, all of whom also have different combat skills (unarmed, armed, kickboxers and so on), and the fights are never fair. Millenium is very confident that this will rise head and shoulders above the fullon attack Street Fighters and will challenge the player to learn strategies and skills for each character, thereby introducing the discipline and skill elements. The Kick Boxer might look a bit conspicuous on the beach, but are you going to tell him? Elvis was very into Kickboxing, apparently. Bet he couldn't do that in his jumpsuit and nappy, though. I'm sure there's a pun about Neil Axe fighting in a wood, but I can't think what it could be. GAME BY MILLENNIUM CONTACT MILLENNIUM (0223 844894) FOR INFORMATION 32 "

Estimare a nuary MEGADRIVE If you could trust a criminal not to rob your house or murder your wife, they'd probably be alright. But instead they're nothing but trouble... that this is in fact the plot for the very first 32x beat 'em up. The aim of the game is simple beat everyone else to death until you are the only remaining candidate for the single remaining escapebound shuttle. Obviously, as is the norm in this sort of game these days, the powers and abilities (far beyond those of mortal men) of each character vary wildly. The four crooked characters are all pretty scary-looking primal hunks of alienhood whom you certainly wouldn't want to meet in a dark crawlspace. The heroes, on the other hand, look a little less anging's too good for fem, that's what we reckon. They ought to be forced to participate in one on-one gladiatorial combat on a crippled space hulk stranded in the depths of a barren galaxy. Quite a coincidence, really, when you think The special moves are all accompanied by these overthe-top special effects. COSMIC CARNAGE As you can no doubt see, the graphics are rather impressive, especially in spatial terms. deadly, despite their wide range of player-selectable power armour. \"It's got aliens, it's got gore, it's got funny joypad commands for all the special moves and, of course, it's got combos but is Cosmic Carnage actually any good?\" is probably round about what you're thinking right now, but as this is a preview you probably also know that we're going to say \"See next month's issue for the full scam\" in reply. So we won't bother. Hmm, the loser here has been decapitated. That's a new trick, isn't it? That's a rather splendid effect, isn't it? Doesn't it look exciting? SCALE OF THE CENTURY Cosmic Carnage also takes advantage of the scaling powers of the 32X and as a result the view zooms in and out gradually, closing up into full detail when one charac ter pulls off a gory grab attack. These two shots here demonstrate how the viewpoint moves in from reet far away to very close up indeed for added drama.

Although it may have been the second. Smog may have be a little tricky to animate.

Of course, you can never tell what these platform types are going to be like until you get a go, so we're firmly reserving our judgement until we get a decent crack at the blighter.

"CVG LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH  PRIZE WINNER SAME AS IT EVER WAS in the bag I can't stand magazines who keep going on about how originality is now dead. Who cares about that when games like Mortal Kombat 2 are around? And if originality is dead, what have they got to say about games like Theme Park? Of course there isn't much originality when every genre has thousands of different games. The future won't be much better, except for perhaps interactive movies. But what it will do is bring technically brilliant software, pixel-perfect digitised beat'em-ups for example. Just look at games like Mirage's beat-'em-up Rise Of The Robots (reviewed issue 156) and tell me that they don't look excellent. What you should be expecting from the future are near-perfect games, not totally original ones. Danny Jones, Liverpool So you'd be happy with a few more versions of Street Fighter 2, or perhaps Space Invaders arriving on PlayStation. With pixel-perfect graphics of course...

What are you on? This is one of the best games ever written. It's got more levels that the first, is much tougher and the new shotgun and enemies round it off perfectly. You must be mental if you don't like it. Frank Close, Peterborough For extra Doom levels see wads, there are thousands available with new monsters. you want difficulty, try the nightmare mode. What you're getting, basically, is the same basic engine with a new shotgun. It's hard to justify the asking price when you consider those factors. David Taylor, Cheltenham DOOM LORDS Doom was my all-time favourite game, and I love the follow-up, but I resent having to pay so much for it. Surely, as it uses the same engine and iD made its money on the original Doom, they didn't need to put the price up for Hell On Earth. It's not as if they had to spend ages programming it from scratch. M Parsons, Hull I've just spent a fortune buying Doom 2 what a rip-off! I don't see how they can justify the extra price for something which is essentially the same game. There's no excuse for it. I've been taken for a mug. Still, the new shotgun is pretty cool...

Some people may think this is a good thing. I don't. With so many machines around it's obvious that new software won't be released on every format, so you could spend a fortune on a new system and miss out on a lot of big name titles. The other major point is price. With so many companies and machines out there, shouldn't they be undercutting each other? Let's hope that a manufacturer takes the lead in slashing prices and triggers a price war. Elliot Vernon, Leicester ALIEN VS PREDATOR PRODUCTION STILLS Under an EEC goods directive the new consoles have been re-classified as VCRS and will be subject to additional import tax: add to this the VAT, shipping costs and UK re-packaging which are imposed anyhow and it's unlikely that there'll be much Dom for a price war.

"RING CVE STEP INTO THE RING CVG UNNATURAL BORN KILLERS Super Street Fighter Il Turbo X versus Mortal Kombat II Steel yourself for the duel of the decade as CVG takes the trickiest of bulls by the horns in a do-or-die bid to find the best ever beat-'em-up 43 "


"CVG STEP INTO THE RING ATTACK THAT SQUIRREL JET! It's all very well having loads of characters, but are they all well-rounded playing machines with loads of ace special moves? Well, the fighters on offer in Street Fighter are probably more well-rounded in their abilities with a few (like Cammy and Zangief) who are only really deadly in the hands of expert players. Mortal Kombat offers more obviously graded levels of character rockness, but the special moves are waaay more original and interesting. Both games make the deadlier moves harder to pull off than the weedy ones, although it's technically more difficult to fathom MK's strings of directional commands than the relatively fluid Street Fighter equivalents. Whether this is good depends on how much patience you have. UNNATURAL BORN KILLERS FIRE each one as near as dammit to the coin-op. Angling for a Nobel peace prize, we at CVG decided to put the two contenders head-to-head in a fight to the finish (fatalities and come one and all to the 3D0 Super Street Fighter II Turbo X Edition Vs Amiga Mortal Kombat II head-tohead showdown. treet Fighter vs Mortal Kombat. It's the latter day equivalent of the old Tintin or Asterix conundrum, the United or City, Spiderman or Superman complex, if you will. The great clash of cultures which divides a generation. All attempts to resolve the situation have been doomed to failure, but now a glimmer of light appears at the end of the tunnel. Two new conversions of the latest models of each game are hitting the streets very soon, and for all, which really is the best beat-'em-up ever. in our opinion. So wel A The moves in Mortal Kombat Il are far more original... ROUND ONE FIGHT! Street Fighter grabs an early lead in the presentation stakes thanks to the faithfully converted coin-op attack sequence which trumps MK2's measly story text. Mortal Kombat's wide selection of 12 characters also pales in comparison to TOM the enormous 16 offered by Street Fighter. And it's got a map, too. FINISH HIM! OR HER! These beat-'em-ups are all very well, but you have to admit it's possible to knock your opponent out with a feeble kick to the ankle in most of them. So do either of these big-name contenders allow the player to finish a bout of fisticuffs in a more realistic fashion, such as ripping their still-beating heart from their chest, or turning them into a baby? Well, both of them do, yes. However, Street Fighter's finishing moves require the player to have scored enough decent hits to fill a power meter at the bottom of the screen and are merely posh-looking versions of existing special moves. Mortal II, on the other hand, features rucks of gory fatalities, vaguely amusing babalities and tabloid-confounding friendships, if you can remember the techniques to perform them all. Mortal Kombat convincingly triumphs in this case, ripping Street Fighter's head off and urinating down the bleeding stump of its neck (like Goro would).

"STEP INTO THE RING CVG LOOK TO LA LUNA I've got a secret, as Madonna sang oh so recently but have either of these games? Well, Street Fighter makes its first tentative foray into the world of hidden elements with the appearance of Akuma Long. However, Mortal Kombat easily triumphs in this category thanks to having three secret enemy fighters. We're not sure as yet whether the programmers' cheat modes have been carried over to the Amiga version, but we reckon they probably have. And that's obviously very secret. V If you think this is good, wait until you see it on the PC it could be the best yet. A Ken vs Ken, flam. ing Dragon Punches and all. Watch out for his new attacks as well. COMBOS You can't move for 'em. Go to your local KFC and a menu of Meal Deal Combos stares you in the face. Work on a farm and it's likely you'll have to drive a combo harvester at some time. And, of course, when conversing on the subject of beat-'em-ups, if you don't mention a five-hit handcuff re-dizzy combo you're obviously crap. Whilst the 'combo potential' of Mortal Kombat II is vastly improved over that of the original, fisticuff connoisseurs are all in agreement that you can't top Street Fighter Il for linked attack strings. Heck, you're even awarded bonus points for some combos. Just to be a bit trainspottery about it, this is because characters freeze in the same spot for a split second when hit in Street Fighter, giving more scope for a swift follow-up than with Mortal Kombat, where punches often cause victims to fall over or slide backwards making them impossible to resmack. Part-timers obviously won't care about this, but serious gamestrels to whom the concept of an attack strategy seems pretty obvious should please take note. AND THE WINNER ters and a far superior atmosphere. Basically, if you've got a second player If there was ever a games hanging around your related question destined house constantly, and the to cause major ructions patience to sit there learnthroughout the office iting new tactics and attack has to be the old Street patterns, the strategic Fighter versus Mortal precision of Street Fighter chestnut Certainly there will appeal to you. If you're are positive and negative after a game which aspects of both titles requires you to think on which should be borne in your feet a little more mind. Street Fighter has than unleashing a predemore buttons and more termined flurry of blows, combo potential, whereas Mortal Kombat II should Mortal is a more exciting tickle your plumcake. Us? escapist game with more Well, in our opinion the variety between characwide variety of moves and secrets gives Mortal Kombat way more longevity as a one-player game and the less anorak-esque, atmosphere of the game makes it a more enjoyable two-player game too. If you disagree, as some rabid Street Fighters obviously will, we'll welcome any rational, constructive arguments from anyone. You probably won't change our minds though, but why not let us know anyway (Send your letters to CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU Ed). BUT CAN YOU BE THE BOSSES? Not as such in either title. The original four bosses from the first Street Fighter 2 edition can be selected from the title screen, but a new boss, Akuma Long awaits top-notch fighters. Shang Tsung, big cheese of Mortal Kombat I is now a player character (albeit a lot younger looking) in Mortal II, although there's no sign of Goro, but the game also features two new end-of-game adversaries Kintaro and Shao Kahn (him out of the advert). It's possible to pull off a morphing-stylee Kintaro Fatality with Shang Tsung, but that's the closest you'll get to controlling the bleeders. 45 45 "


"CVG STEP INTO THE RING UNNATURAL BORN KILLERS movie kombat \"The battle of the beat-'em-ups is being taken out of the arcades and on to the cinema screens\". Remember that phrase, because everyone'll be saying it in a couple of months, except possibly Barry Norman. Anyway, it's true though as both the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat movies are currently in (post-)production and due for release just a little too close together for comfort. However, everyone's seen the publicity shots of Street Fighter, so we thought we'd unveil the first pics of the Mortal movie. As you can see, it's a rather dark and scary-looking translation of the admittedly dark and scary game, in complete contrast to the bright colours and friendly-looking settings of Street Fighter. No big names on the credits either; unless you're a hard-core martial arts fan or you've seen Shopping, from British director Paul Anderson who's at the helm of the MK flick. Goro fans will be pleased to hear that everyone's favourite four-armed half-dragon makes a welcome return to the series in the movie, thanks to the magic of stop-motion. Mr Anderson reckons the Mortal film will inspire the same feelings in the same people as the game, so expect loads of right-wing grandads harping on about it being the work of the devil while lots of normal, well-adjusted people who can cope with real life thoroughly enjoy it. NEW LINE A Bruce Lee lives! Well, he doesn't really. But if he did we'd be sure he'd appreciate the latest advances in headache cures and those handy little warnings they now put on bottles of paracetamol. 46 "


"STEP INTO THE RING CVG the politically correct mortal kombat Obsessive Mortal Kombat fans should be delighted to hear that a PC version of the sequel is on its way. And, just to clarify the point for any Americans reading, this doesn't mean they've taken all the gore and violence out to make it Politically Correct, it means that the game is being converted for personal Computers. Apparently, according to our US sources at Bally Midway, the PC version is the closest yet to the coin-op. As you can see from these fantastic screenshots, there's practically no difference between the graphics on the PC and those found on the arcade machine. And it's not just the stills either the animation is as fluid as any player could hope for. We don't want to give too much away right now because it's still not finished, so there's time for them to botch it up. However, let's just say that at the moment we're very much looking forward to getting this one in for review. A Watch out, mate you've got loads of red stuff coming out of your hat. Up there, see it? A kage and Liu Kang get down to some funky 70s sound, but mourn the passing of flares. I there can be only three A No, really, it was that big or my name is Shiggertons. It's strange when you think about it, but the Mortal Kombat series is about five years younger than the Street Fighter line, yet work has already commenced on the production of Mortal Kombat III, while SF would appear to be stuck in the 'difficult' second game slot. We talked to our mole at Bally Midway in the States about how production is going to date and, in his awed words, «Mortal III is to Mortal Il what Mortal Il was to Mortal I.\" Kano, Sonya and fanfare please Goro, game villain of the decade, all make a return after something of a makeover. Smoke and pals are back too, but this time as player-controlled characters and not secret hidden ones (shades of Reptile here). We'll be pestering the development team to tell us more as the game takes shape, so keep reading for more up-todate info as and when we get it. 42 "

Some would say that this seals the 3DO's status as a real contender in the next generation supremacy battle, but let's not forget even the Sinclair Spectrum has a Streetfighter 2 conversion. This conversion, though, is somewhat more advanced than the 8-bit tape-loading spectacular. For a kick-off it features the full cast of characters, all of them player selectable (except Akuma Long), including the four 'new' combatants Cammy, Dee Jay. T Hawk and Fei Long, The basics of SF2 are now ingrained on the conciousness of anyone who's ever even looked at a home games machine. Take your lone fighter up against a variety of ugly-looking foreigners and paste them with your three strengths of punch, three strengths of kick and variety of special moves accessed by a string of joystick commands. Once you've mastered this you move into combo-type territory and it all gets rather serious. All you really need to know is that this is easily one of the best games to hit the 3D0 and it's one you should buy just as soon as you possibly can. super street fighter II turbo x VERDICT 3DO Pre-empting Capcom's highly likely follow-up to the current arcade model of Super SF2 Turbo those wily 3DO folks have come up with a conversion which they reckon tops the coinop. As indeed do we. The game shifts faster than the arcade machine in top whack and features all the new moves, characters and features not present in other home Street Fighter conversions. Basically, as if you couldn't guess, this is absolutely firkin' brilliant. If you've got a 3DO you've got to have this, it's as simple as that. RAD AUTOMATIC A Cammy and Chun-Li have their own little slap fight. England's come on a bit since we last looked. 1P 7500 FCO 1702500 TAKE THAT, YE VARLET Super Street Fighter has more to it than just four new characters.

A Not like that, you fool, rip his flippin' head off. It makes a better screen shot. mortal kombat VERDICT ell, there's life in the old dog yet. Indeed, the dog has in fact risen from the grave transformed into a lycanthropic red-eyed demon wolf with bloodstained jowls. The Amiga, knocked by most console owners as outdated, has only been and got the best conversion of Mortal Kombat yet seen on a home system, The graphics, as you can see from the shots, are absolutely spot on. Not only are the sprites the right size with the right amount of detail, but they're also very well animated. Apart from some slightly sub-par scrolling there's precious little difference between MKII on an A1200 and the real thing in the arcades. That is, until you start playing, where the Amiga button deficiency comes into play. If you're an expert on the coin-op you'll no doubt be disappointed to hear that you'll have to relearn all the special moves. It's not so bad with a two-button configuration, but single switch players have a bunch of new techniques to master. Still, all the moves are there, and as it's actually easier to perform them all it makes for more exciting play and evens things out for inexperienced players. The only other apparent criticism is the amount of disk-swapping, between two-player bouts, although this is completely eliminated if you've got an external drive. Absolutely ace, AMIGA 1200 I wasn't sure how this would work given the lack of fire buttons open to Amiga owners. However, the system used for special moves and the use of double button presses for some attacks means every character has their full offensive complement and each move is fairly simple to activate. It was the quality of the conversion which counted, and Probe have done a sterling job. The action's as fast and furious as it ever was, and to put it bluntly if you don't buy this you're a fool. The best Amiga beat-'emup ever. RAD AUTOMATIC Toasty? It sure is. Not sure about the stripey spandex hot-pants though. GRAPHICS 96 SOUND 92 PLAYABILITY 95 VALUE 97 OPEN THE BOX! RIP HIS HEART OUT! Kombat vets should no doubt be over the moon to discover all the characters found in the arcade machine are present and correct in the Amiga conversion including the smart secret hidden characters. It's still no easier to find any of them, but at least you know they're there to be found. OVERALL A MKII certainly makes up for the lack of a decent Amiga version of Street Fighter. 96 49 49 "

"THE REVIEWS START HERE... CVG reviewed this month. head's been ested catetea hat a perfectly brilliant thing to happen for the last issue of 1994. I'm talking about the release of Virtua Fighter on the Sega Saturn, of course. And although I know that, for the moment at least, the machine is being sold on import for more than the national debt, the sheer power of Virtua has left me gasping for more. Elsewhere this issue we've got THE best versions of the two best ever beat-'emups, plus the first review of the new Virtua Fighter 2 coin-op, which exclusive-wise gives us a Virtua Double Whammy, don't you think? Steve James, Managing Editor What we're playing this month This month's hot-hits 999 STEVE Need For Speed/3DO Akin to Road Rash, but with all the comforts of a modern motor car. Doom/Jag Save the lives of your family and friends by taking out the frustrations of putting together a magazine on this harmless game. Doom/32X If that doesn't work, try it again with this one before they lock you away. Virtua Fighter p. 12 like my ples raw, bloody and dripping with lard. And this is Hike that, but without lard. Mortal Kombat/Amiga More gore and so on, but this time with babies too (another fave ple ingredient). Super Streetfighter 2 X 3DO Streetfighter 2 may be getting a bit long in the tooth now, but this is probably the best conversion yet. Shame about the lack of ples. Here at CVG we don't give high scores away lightly. A game has to be rather special before it scores over 90% and a CVG Hit. Even rarer though is a CVG Gold (awarded to games that have pushed back the boundaries of gaming) but don't expect to see more than a few of these a year as it takes a score of over 96% to earn one. Anyway, here are the top games this month... Mortal Kombat II p.49 GARY Virtua Fighter/Saturn It's even better than we thought it would be. Except the box for the Saturn looks a bit cheap. 12 Virtua Fighter/Saturn 48 Super Streetfighter 2 X/3DO 49 Mortal Kombat 2/Amiga 54 Snatcher/MCD 66 Samurai Shodown/3DO 72 Doom/Jaguar and 32X 86 Virtua Fighter 2/Arcade 94 Need For Speed/3DO TOM Virtua Fighter 2/Arcade I'm a big fan of the original game, so I was happy to see AM2 have made such an excellent job of the sequel. Doom/32X I actually think that the border is quite cute, to be honest. And I was wondering if it would go out with me. Snatcher/M-CD Good plot, decent dialogue, plenty of investigating to do... and stacks of blood and death and perversity! Wahey! RAD Virtua Fighter/Saturn Quite probably the most Impressive home game ever in the world ever ever. Absolutely brilliant and just what I want for Christmas (ha!). Snatcher/M-CD One of the first games I've played right through to the very end in ages. Highly entertaining. Snatcher/M-CD This is actually quite amus. ing, which is something of a turn-up for the books. Biker Mice/SNES Not so much that I wanted to play it as that I had too, really. Has anyone ever seen the cartoon? It's daft. The big picture If any other version of a game is available, then we'll tell you via our Alternatives and Other Versions boxes. We'll even tell you if it's destined for any other formats. For consistency's sake, games retain the original scores in alternative boxes. MARK Samural Shodown/3DO I like my beat 'em ups like 5 3 "


"CVG REVIEW MEGA-CD RPG Konami Out December No other versions available No other versions planned CVG Hooray! It's a UK console game that's not only an RPG, but it's packed with unwholesome behaviour! The trouble with Snatchers is that they're able to assume the form of any human being thanks to their flesh-moulding facilities. This one looks not unlike a blood-spattered robot. What a cunning disguise. uess what everyone, the future sucks. Chemical weapons pollution is way up, ozone levels are way down. Every remaining city in the world is a hybrid of modern day Tokyo and a medieval leper colony. There's a surprise, eh? Actually, there is a bit of a surprise, as Neo Kobe, the world's top famous city, is being bothered by a plague of robot assassins known as Snatchers. These malevolent mechanoids appear completely human from the outside and take great pride in knocking off influential pillars of society and assuming their places to further whatever nefarious aims they may have. You are cast as Gillian Seed, a government agent (with amnesia, plot twist fans) who specialises in hunting down and destroying Snatchers with a little help from your robot Navigator sidekick called Metal Gear. If you're just looking forward to the destroying bits you may be better off looking elsewhere, as Snatcher is pretty intensive on the investigative side and a little lacking in arcade action, unless sporadic (Justifier light gun compatible if you're interested) shooting sections are your idea of an all-out gatfest (eh? Ed). However, fans of gore and perversity should be well happy with the 18-rated pics and text which proliferate throughout the course of the game. This is your chief, complete with dodgy 'tache. snatcher WELCOME TO THE TEAM... BANG It's your first day on the job, you've just had a quick briefing from the boss on what is expected of you and what happens? The guy you'll be work ing with radios in with an emergency request for back-up, that's what.

There's no-one around so it looks like you'll have to get inside. A Hmm, what's this lying here on the floor?

"CVG REVIEW GIVE US A PIECE OF EVIDENCE As a top raincoat-wearing detective you'll doubtless want to get looking for some clues and evidence. There are a number of ways to get hold of what infor mation you want, all of which are pictured here. The most useful two are probably Napolean, your informant (if you can find him) and Jordan, the super com puter at your HQ. A Things are getting rather cosy, but is it just your particulars that she wants to take down? INFORMANT CRIME SCENE Catastrophe, The On June 6, 1996, a mysterious explosion destroyed the Chernoton research facility near VERDICT Moscow logical cplosion released JORDAN MEGA CD Snatcher might have the plot of a weirdo 80s science fiction B-movie, but it's also one of the most compelling role playing games to reach a console in a while. Clever, well put together, atmospheric and sometimes genuinely funny, Snatcher makes for an engrossing game. The shooting sections aren't so hot, however, so it's likely that blasting fans will without a doubt be disappointed and the graphics look a little dated; but if you've got an attention span longer than three minutes you should rightly enjoy Snatcher considerably. RAD AUTOMATIC SECOND OPINION QUESTIONING It's been some time since an RPG caused such a massive stir in the office. Just about everyone has their own saved position and has taken to wearing headphones or covering their ears lest they pick up unwanted information on what happens later in the game. Basically, Snatcher is a title which all kinds of people really want to play. The plot is unpredictable without being overly ridiculous and the lighter moments balance the gore out nicely. Very great. GARY LORD INTERROGATION GRAPHICS 81 SOUND 92 PLAYABILITY 93 VALUE 88 OVERALL ALTERNATIVE IN THE CINEMA Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarantino/@ A lot less sex and violence than you'll find in Snatcher, but there's a lot more swearing if you're into that sort of thing of course.

"CVG REVIEW MEGA DRIVE/SNES Platform Acclaim Unconfirmed Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned No doubt after Spidey this guy has to be the coolest superhero ever to grace a Marvel comic, and now he's decided to drop in and visit you too... SNES A The collision detection in the SNES version is rather lame, sometimes you'll be trying to hit someone, be making contact but you'll have no effect. MEGA DRIVE aturday mornings, don't you just love 'em? Your week of toil is over and out, and the only thing that is required of you is to gradually come out of Slumberland, futon or whatever is to reach for that remote control and get in some serious Sat morn' TV, and what better televisual feast than the XMen. Now though, SNES and Mega Drive owners can have their favourite mutant ('cos he is everyone's fave) as a constant videogame companion as Acclaim have immortalised him in his very own platformer. Now, don't groan 'Not another plat. former', because although essentially it is, the game's style is individual enough to disguise what is a fairly formulaic platform game, on the Mega Drive at least. The first levels on both formats are gargantuan affairs where you have to escape from the mutant labaratory, disposing, courtesy of Wolverine's multifaceted moves (on Mega Drive at least), of armoured drones, end-of-level bosses and work your way through endless puzzling levers, lifts and disintegrating platforms or painful opponents who just won't give you a fair fight. This of course depends on which version you're playing as one is a pleasure the other is pure pain. Which is which? Well cast your eyes across the page. The levels in the Mega Drive version are on the hard side of tough should we say. SNES MEGA DRIVE One main advantage SNES Wolvie has over his cousin is that he can walk up walls and across ceilings, Spidey style. The ninjas are both well drawn and animated, and a bugger to kill. MOVE OVER! MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE SNES A The scenery in the Mega Drive version is far more interactive than in the SNES. 1. It's worth taking time to become au fait with the moves; this flying jump gets rid of the flying drones. 2. If they're coming in too low then this just-above. the-ground kick is the one to try and use. 3. My fave move of the bunch has to be this flying swipe, or as I've dubbed it The Blue One.

"REVIEW CVG wolverine MEGA DRIVE FOXIE.. OK, don't expect FMV intros but the one on the Mega Drive is far superior to the SNES machine's attempt. ECPAD VERDICT Well come on X-Men, don't just stand there, try a bit of mouth-to-mouth; have you never watched Casualty? MEGA DRIVE SNES Wolvie doesn't quite scur. ry up ladders, unfortunately. SNES The only thing that playing the SNES version does is make you yearn for the game on Mega Drive. The Super NES version just pales by comparison. The graphics have not had as much time and attention paid to them, and the sprite never feels fully under your control, the scrolling is slow and the levels, although some look similar, aren't as varied or intricate as the Mega Drive's. Not only this, but the levels and the collision detection is frustrating in the extreme, and trying to find a clear route through is Painful with a capital P. GARY LORD VERDICT The graphics on the SNES version are not as clear and well animated as those used on Mega Drive Wolverine. MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE The Sega version of Wolverine more than does justice to Marvel's premier X-Man. The programmers have encapsulated all of his cool characteristics, and he moves so fluidly it's a pure joy to discover the sprite's armoury of moves and kicks. once you suss the basic idea behind the puzzles things become a lot less complicated and the levels are varied enough to keep Mr Monotony at bay. Not as polished or as fun as Earthworm or Mickey, but it's a change from the cutesy look that seems to be vogue at the mo. GARY LORD GRAPHICS 70 SOUND 80 PLAYABILITY 68 VALUE 60 OVERALL The MD Wolverine is dead hard, and the sound sample when he breaks through glass is hyper realistic. SNES SNES SNES GRAPHICS 89 SOUND 89 PLAYABILITY 88 VALUE 84 LECT OVERALL ALTERNATIVE 3DO ANOTHER WORLD INTERPLAY/.99 A far more stylish version of the Prince of Persia engine, this is an excellent platform game full to the brim with atmosphere, gameplay and kickin' graphics and sound. ISSUE 152: 90% 4. This move is in both versions and is handy for those double whammie attacks enemies are so fond of. 5. The SNES Wolvie seems to have been spending far longer in the gym than his Mega Drive mate. 6. This is the ole up-andunder and is ever so handy for disposing of drone spewing machines. 89 59 "


"CVG REVIEW A1200 Shoot-'em-up Team 17 .99 l Out Now No other versions available Auto detects and enhances for AGA machines; CD32 version planned The bitches are back in Team 17's explosive finale to the Alien Breed series... Alien Breed was always a lot like the arcade classic Gauntlet, and Tower Assault features similar baddie spewing generators. ip back in time three years and ask any gamesplayer who Team 17 are/were and they'd probably respond with a guppy-like stare. That soon changed though when the Wakefield wonders crashed in on the software scene with the classic blaster Alien Breed. Such was Alien Breed's success that it has since spawned a \"remixed budget version (one of the best selling Amiga budget titles of all time incidentally), last year's proper sequel Alien Breed 2 and now Tower Assault. Essentially Tower Assault irons out the flaws of the previous games. Most noticeably the characters now have the ability to fire backwards while retreating, which is useful for avoiding those nasty aliens pouncing from behind. Game size has also been vastly increased with each level featuring multiple exit points. Not only does this negate the linear feel of previous Breed games and offer greater lastability, it also ends the frustration suffered if stuck on one particular route as another can be tried. Other fresh bitz include new varieties of alien like the ammo' wasting invisible breed, plus different level types including completely dark ones with just the aliens' beady blue eyes for company. A Simple puzzle elements to break up the frantic blasting. Here, for instance, all the auxiliary power generators in a level must be found and activated before a door will open later in a level. COMING SOON A The sound FX have been beefed up, espe. cially some of the alien squel ching noises. CD32 Tower Assault Team 17 Tower Assault on the CD32 will include heaps of rendered footage, digital sound and music, as well as the complete Alien Breed 2 game, previously unreleased on CD. Bargainbleedin'-tastic! EXPECTED RELEASE: TBA As well as aliens look out for man-made dangers like mines and security lasers which are scattered across the levels. VERDICT alien breed: 3 tower assault It's the start of the game and your partner's dead already. Not good. Still I bet there's a few quid in his wallet that he won't miss! A1200 Tower Assault is the definitive version of the Breed series. The multiple exit points in particular make all the difference and stop the frustration of getting stuck at certain points in the game, as well as increasing long term gameplay. Graphically it's an improvement too, especially over Alien Breed, but the high level of scenery detail can lead to debris being mistaken for pickups. A solid purchase if you own no previous Breed games, but have a close look if you've got Breed 2 since it is rather similar in places. STEVE JAMES ES GRAPHICS 86 SOUND 85 PLAYABILITY 85 VALUE 88 OVERALL Not only does the new retreat feature look cool, it allows the player to fire backwards while making a hasty escape. Some of the graphics and sound FX are quite gory at times (especially where the aliens are eating human remains) so Tower Assault has been given an 11plus certification. 86 GAME BY TEAM 17 CONTACT TEAM 17 (0924 291867) FOR INFORMATION 60 "

On some of the ramps there's a rolling tack before them, which should catapult you over any obstacles. biker mice from mars he possibilities of follow-up programs to The Biker Mice From Mars are of course endless, the new series could be infinite in range. Much like space itself, where Mars in fact is. So can we expect The Stunt Racing Stick Insects from Saturn? We can only hope not, seeing as my CVG comrades have informed me that said Mice from Mars, unlike their spider comrades, are not exactly we would call cool. This is a racing game where you get to race as one of the dear little rodents on a variety (albeit an uninteresting variety) of three-quarter view tracks. All the racers have different attributes (albeit not really that different), ie Rodent 1 is faster while Rodent 2 has a better grip. Each race becomes more complicated and your opponents more tricky to pass depending on whether you've opted for easy, normal or hard. And you can nip into the Race Shop to acquire bike accoutrements like tires, better engines and would you believe Snickers, formerly (and preferably) known as Marathons. Product placement, ain't it great? Pre-race and you get a quick look at the course in full so that you can reccie the hazards. MIDSEA ISLAND VERDICT You've got to finish in the top three to get through to the next round. Some of the scenery will interact with you, so if you bump into the fire hydrant expect to get rather wet. There are various projectiles that your fellow racers will bung at you. SNES If you're after a decent Konami game check out Batman in issue 156. Biker Mice is a racing game in a similar vein to Rock 'n' Roll Racing, but not quite as playable or as much fun or with such a good soundtrack. The race tracks do not have enough obstacles to make the game particularly interesting or varied, and don't expect any sexy Mode 7 scrolling, cos it ain't here. No real challenge and maybe if there was a Micro Machinesstyle two-player mode there might have been a reason for buying this, but it hasn't and there isn't. GARY LORD GONE SHOPPING Should the mood take you simply nip into the shop for that V8 engine you've always wanted, or pig out on as many Marathons as your waistline can handle.

World interceptor each buggies are fab aren't they? Think how much better they'd be if they had a few sizzling laser cannons strapped on to lay waste to anything unfortunate enough to cross their path, especially if it resembled, in any way, David Hasselhoff. Off World Interceptor offers just such an opportunity. Set over six particularly unfriendly alien worlds, babe-less post-apocalyptic Baywatch sets if you like, each is divided into separate zones with the obligatory mother of all bosses at the end. A nifty two-player battle mode is also available. In-game hazards include ruddy great hills, all manner of ground and air-based enemies plus other racers doing their best to hinder the player's progress. Help comes in the form of pick-ups scattered around the worlds, although these are often difficult to reach. They include fuel and missiles plus cash for spending in the speed shop between levels. It offers an extensive range of equipment and more general objects like extra lives and vehicles, although both these options come with a price tag only affordable by collecting the bounty after wasting an end-of-level boss. Reach certain points in the game and a refuel ship beams down supplies. They're well situated as they tend to appear just when needed. VERDICT BOUNTY WANTED CASH TOTAL 500800 At the end of every world a seri. ously tough boss has to be taken out. A large supply of missiles is handy because the lasers do little damage. Like Cybermorph any of the worlds can be selected right from the start of the game but some are much harder than others, natch' of course. 3DO I didn't like this at first as it uses more fingers than a Van Halen guitar solo takes to play. Once the controls are mastered I was happier. This satisfaction extends to the audio -visuals; stunning texture mapped graphics, bitmapped explosions, and chunky FX; they're all here in abundance. Gameplay's smart at first, especially with the great sense of freedom to wander the landscape offers, but my overall mark is lower than it should be because there's little variety, either from the levels or the different cars and weapons available.

Better than Street Fighter 2? More action packed than Mortal Kombat 2? Samurai Shodown could be all these, and of course much, much more... \" samurai t's one thing to do something well, it's another to do it with style. This is particularly important in a genre filled to bursting point with clone upon clone, many of which are very good anyway. Which is why Samurai Shodown shone in the arcades. It takes its lead from those ace Seventies martial arts movies where the action seems to freezeframe when the fighters make contact and the speech is always totally out of synch. It's this kind of action which is faithfully re-created in Shodown. The fighting's all together faster and more vicious than Street Fighter, without having to resort to the over-the-top violence gimmick of Mortal Kombat 2. Instead Samurai Shodown resorts to a little known tactic gameplay. After the basic special moves are loads of extra ones to discover, many of which you're likely to encounter by accident thanks to the 3DO's quirky joypad. Even though this version of the game has been superseded in the arcades, and now on Neo Geo CD, it's still exceptional. We can but hope that we'll be seeing games such as Art Of Fighting 2 coming to the 3D0 next year... Some attacks call for your opponent to be close up, but do huge amounts of damage.

In this sit GROSSO uation is imperative to reclaim it as soon as possible if you don't want your hero to then become parted with bits of their body. However, if this sort of unarmed combat suits you, there's an option to remove the weapons. This completely changes the tactics you need to win a fight as it takes a lot longer to kill a fighter in hand-to-hand combat. COM A Most screens contain a generous amount of objects to slice up.... shodowny CEBUEUER Earthquake is probably the biggest character ever to feature in a beat-'em-up. But pit him against himself, and they cancel each other out. So you won't want to do that, really The bonus round lets you vent any remaining anger, should you have any, on straw dolls. SECOND OPINION VERDICT When you've seen as many beat-em-'ups as I have, even a game as good as this doesn't quite have the attraction it used to. Technically it's a perfect conversion of the coin-op which is exactly what it should be considering the 3DO's power, but I just can't understand why they opted for this when Sam Shodown 2 was just around the corner. Perhaps it's the sequel that prejudiced me, but I just didn't enjoy this as much as I used to GARY LORD HOLAWAN Some of the special attacks are down-right unfair, such as Galford's surprise teleport. Not all the attacks are orthodox. Earthquake's bowl-shaker, for example, wouldn't go down well in most street brawls. 3DO While Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat have gone from strength to strength on home machines, Sam Shodown has suffered at the hands of extremely dodgy conversions. Whether that's to do with the game being a bit complicated to convert, or programmer incompetency, it's good to see, finally, that justice has been done to one of the best beat. 'em-ups ever. This is a perfect conversion of the SNK coin-op, with plenty of options, a good control system and no gremlins. If you're sick of Street Fighter, this is the game to buy. MARK PATTERSON A Galford and Nakoruru use animals in their battles, which is handy 'cos you can't knock an animal out. Squeamish types can switch the blood off, but the game's not half as much fun without it.

Just as a couple of years ago all movie producers needed to do to sell a film was place a marathon sex scene, à la Basic Instinct, now there's one sure way of making you buy a video game, and that's to ensure that there's a bit of blood contained within the game, à la Doom. And Bloodshot is a Doom style shoot-'em-up for the Mega Drive, where you, as an Elite Trooper, must invade an alien battleship, find your way through the maze of corridors and destroy this big, head-like plasma node; and then get the hell out of there (the way you came, only it's darker and there's a time limit) before the whole thing blows sky high. And that is that. The thing is though, there's not really very much blood at all. In fact, there's not even a proverbial pin prick, which leaves you thinking that maybe a bit of blood and gore in your video game isn't that gratuitous after all, since it certainly adds to the effect of the game. This does not mean that you don't have plenty of ammo' though, and for those big end-oflevel n'er-do-wells there's always your grenade or assault cannon. There's a wee map on screen to guide you round and numerous restart points and keys to be collected, so that you can find that last alien to blow.

"CVG REVIEW ISNES Beat-'em-up Nintendo .99 Out Now No other versions avallable No other versions planned Three knock downs or a super-punch are enough to win a fight We don't need any fireballs or other Japanese fighting efforts. We're British, we fight with our fists and Queensbury rules because we're innately hard, don't ya know? super punch ith the current decline in boxing standards, we reckon the WBA et al should go back to the old days where two men in long johns, with handlebar moustaches and names like Jack 'scrapper' McJack used to slap each other, sans gloves, for the best part of a couple of days. None of this softie gloves and gum shields stuff. But until that happens it's highly unlikely we're going to see a bare-knuckle boxing sim, so we've got to make do with Super Punch Out, which is just as well seeing as it's jolly good. It's based on Elite's old 8-bit punch-up sim Frank Bruno's Boxing, with similar, although improved, gameplay and one or two familiar faces. Well, familiar until you've punched their noses flat and fractured a few bones. But it's all in a cartoon stylee, so that's OK. Right? One of the nice things about the game is that it does give you a good feeling of contact when you land a decent shot. It's certainly a lot less painful than doing it for real, and possibly a lot more fun. TKO A The key to winning fights is adapting your tactics for each opponent. VERDICT Apart from being a rather potent and expensive cock tail which makes you fall over, a TKO is also the way you win fights. Flatten your opponent three times and the ref obligingly calls a halt to the contest, declares you the winner and lets you move on to the next fight where you'll invariably be hammered into the canvas. Dragon Chan's a survivor from the original Frank Bruno's Boxing. He still cheats by kicking his way through a bout. SNES Considering that, from first impressions at least, Super Punch Out is a rather limited game, it's amazingly playable. As soon as you work out how to win more than one game the fun really begins. There's plenty of challenge in working out the tactics to beat each of the increasingly difficult oppo. nents. It's this tactical gameplay which makes Punch Out so absorbing, and a little frustrating at times. Still, the best boxing game by far to grace any home machine. Could have done with a two-play. er mode, though. MARK PATTERSON 1. This ancient Frenchman is a bit of a doddle, so use this opportunity to practice your punching prowess. 2. Landing a series of hits powers the meter up at the bottom of the screen.

JAGUAR 32x couple of months ago we said that there wasn't a lot left to be said about Doom that hadn't been said already. Well, that's even more true now thanks to the swine Patterson, but suffice to say that Doom is destined for a place in gaming history thanks to its subtle blend of death and gore. That's not all there is to it, of course. No, there's also a generous helping of maiming, murder, slaughter, rampaging demons and huge guns. Strangely, Doom is yet to garner the sort of tabloid notoriety peers such as the comparably tame Mortal Kombat have VS MODE attracted, despite a (now How do the two versions banned) ad campaign for shape up?

JAGUAR EXTRA JAG LEVELS Hell must be a pretty big place when you think about it, what with all those lost souls needing beds, not to mention the purgatory wing, which must take up loads of space. Aiming for total realism, the designers of Doom have attributed a level to each department of Hades, from the front door to the computer department (which is full of BBC Micros as Hell's own would be). The Jaguar version, however, has more levels than even the PC original, having a few apparently lifted from the sequel and some all-new layouts to boot. The 32x, however has had its level quotient reduced to 17 which, as hardened Doomsters will tell you, is still enough to challenge the hardiest gameplayers.

That exploding barrel is in the midst of blowing that thar room full of zombies to bits. JAGUAR VERDICT Shoot to kill! Shoot to kill! JAGUAR One of the best things about Doom is the corpses stay where they die. 32X JAGUAR It might not have quite the resolution of the PC version, but Jaguar Doom is a blimming Incredible game. All the guns and injuries of the much-famed original are there, along with some never-before-seen levels to boot. There isn't much you can say about Doom, really. If the thought of wandering around an Incredibly atmospheric and well-designed first-person afterlife blasting the shinola out of everything sounds good to you, buy this. In fact, buy this even If you don't like the idea. Just pips 32X because of the extra levels. RAD AUTOMATIC VERDICT Various pirate Doom levels are now in circulation, based on the original game engine but with revamped graphics. There's Alien Doom, Charlie Brown Doom and even, if you're a raver-type with thursday nights free, Megatripolis Doom set in the trendy club of the same name. It's got corpses hanging in the cloakroom and everything (in the game that is, not real life) and the aim of the game is to find a different way to interact with the environment other than by shooting everything (which would seem to take a lot of the fun away). You can have a go (it's free) if you want (and you're over 18 and have enough money to get in) by tripping down to Heaven by Charing Cross Station in London of a thursday and popping in to see the delectable Mr Martin Cavanagh in the VirtualiMore plasma-spattered play.

"CVG REVIEW MEGA-CD Racing Game Core Design Unconfirmed Out Now INo other versions available ICD-ROM, 32X AND Jaguar CD versions planned MEET THE GANG CHUCK AND JNR CLIFF AND ROXY Speed and smash your way through the Jurassic era in the latest shiny disc wonder from Mega CD saviours Core Design... B.C. Racers features 13 different competitors, seated two to a car. Look out for Chuck Rock and son Jnr and Gary Gritta and Brick Jagger from Core's Chuck Rock series. The last character, Stiggy Saurus, can't be selected for some reason. hunderhawk, Battlecorps, Soulstar. It seems that most of the decent software released over the last year or so on Sega's Mega CD has come from Derby-based Core Design. Its latest title isn't a shoot-'em-up like the above, instead it's a racing game, and it's what Sega must be hoping is its answer to the irrepressible SNES racing champ, Super Mario Kart. Set in Flinstone-y times the story involves millionaire playboy Millstone Rockafella arranging a dirtbike race, the winner of which will receive the droolsome ultimate boulderdash bike. The main challenger is caveman hunk Cliff Ace, who wants to win the superbike in order to impress top babe Roxy. All this translates into a prehistoric racing game with overtones of Bump 'n' Burn on the Amiga. Select six teams of two racers, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses in areas such as speed and weapon power. Eight different tracks have to be completed and points are awarded according to finishing position. Various track-based and roadside obstacles attempt to slow the player down as do the racers who lash out. Thankfully you can do the same simply by tapping the A or C buttons to hit either left or right. Finish top of the league after the eight race and the gleaming ultimate boulderdash bike is yours. A The night rally level is tricky with only the dirt bike's spotlights providing Ilumination. A Finish the race in the top three and you'll be treated to this Virtua Racing-style flyby. Corweee! A Hit any button other than start to check up on a character's strengths before selecting him. bc racers ANOTHER FAB INTRO! B.C. Racers' neat cartoon-style intro is definitely worth more than one look. It's similar to that seen in the Chuck Rock series but shorter and lacking the speech. It depicts the main prize and the characters scurring around as they prepare to race. Still, it doesn't make up for Core neglecting to use their best 3D graphics engine.

All you get in Dawn Patrol is a couple of machine-guns strapped to the front of your World War One aircraft, and your own cunning. Rowan Software has come up with a subtle twist on recent flight sims by returning to the roots of aviation. Added to the wingtip-to-wingtip exhilaration of flying a rickety old biplane in combat, the programmers have put in SVGA graphics that'll have you rushing for your goggles and flying jacket. The look and feel are enhanced by having a unique set of options screens represented as a book of stories about the famous fliers of the time. You get to take on the more spectacular missions, from either the Allied or German side, starting in the thick of the action. None of this faffing around with take-offs and landings, no messing around for ages trying to find the enemy. Nosiree, Dawn Patrol is seat-of-the-pants stuff right from the off. On the down side, this unorthodox approach to presentation means that Rowan has missed out a real campaign mode, and it is missed. Details like better sound and fuller ground detail might have helped raise some more eyebrows, too. As it is, with Origin putting its weight behind a WWI flight sim in the shape of Wings of Glory, it might end up being a close shoot out between the two to see who becomes the king of the Great War sims. TWO'S COMPANY In Dawn Patrol there are missions for everyone. Wade into multi-plane may. hem, all guns blazing... N4 THE MISSI ...or go for the challenge of taking on the aces oneon-one.

The latest in the series, Pinball Illusions, has just been released and is currently being drooled over by the Amiga press. The various titles have been converted to a whole host of machines, but none as yet have managed to capture the brilliance of the Amiga originals. Both these conversions feature all four tables from the Amiga game. Partyland is based around all the fun of the fair, Speed Devils has a race driving theme, Billion Dollar Game Show is a pastiche of tacky 50s quiz shows while Stones and Bones is similar to the Nightmare table in Pinball Dreams, with plenty of churchyard fun. There's certainly plenty of action on offer, the only thing really lacking is a multiball feature and that's since been rectified in Illusions.

Lots of ghosts and tombstone action. SNES Oh dear, Pinball Fantasies on SNES bears little relation to the excellent Amiga original. The most obvious bugbear is the simply appalling music and FX, I never thought I'd hear music worse than Alfred Chicken, but it looks like Fantasies has cracked it. The graphics look rough too, and although the scrolling is smoother than the SNES version of Dreams, it still judders. Gameplay is equally uneventful and very slow. An insult to the original; you'd be better of shovelling a few 10 pees in a table down your local arcade. RIK SKEWS GAME BOY This is more like it. Obviously taking into consideration the limitations of the Game Boy this is still as good as I could have imagined it. The scrolling is pretty smooth and the music and FX are much higher quality than their SNES counterpart. Graphically it's quite sparse but very clear, which makes keeping track of the ball much easier when for example you're on the move. Not as much fun as Kirby's Pinball Land but if you're looking for pinball realism this is as good as it gets on Game Boy at present. RIK SKEWS The SNES' Speed Devils table.

Like so many CD conversions, when it appeared on the CD32 it was little more than a portover which failed to live up to peoples' expectations. In fact, for your investment in a 32-Bit machine you got a game which was almost identical to the SNES conversion. Now the 3DO has arrived, and there are plenty of excellent conversions, Road Rash, FIFA to a name but two, where the gameplay hasn't been touched, its just the graphics which really make it a 3D game.

It's not all buying players and planning tactics in Premier Manager 3; you've also got to think about your supporters, and the condition of your ground. As you start to make a profit from gate receipts, you can put some of that money back into things such as heated grounds, better parking facilities, and even a supporters club complete with cheap beer.

SMALL CAR PARK TO BUILD MEDIUM L88888 5 WEEKS VICTORIA GROUND RATING: 22% TICKETS:{L MATT BROUGHTON BANK ACCOUNT  North East South Hest hough Amiga users have enjoyed such sequels as Heimdall 2 and Cannon Fodder 2, it's surprising how few titles make it to a No. 3. Of course, if any genre calls for the full trilogy' experience, it has to be football management simulation; with its ever changing team lineups and player statistics. Gremlin's Premier Manager is about to cross that bridge known in the industry simply as 3. It seems as though Amiga owners can't get enough of footy management games, and even though there have been a fair few of them within the last 12 months, the additions to Gremlin's already proven Premier Manager formula should guarantee PM3 shifts like hot cakes. If it ain't broke, don't fix it' Premier Manager 3 isn't that different from its predecessors. What Gremlin has done is make the already incredibly user-friendly control system even clearer, and to include a more detail tactics editor and an improved match display. Gone are the text-based management screens, replaced by high quality icons and player representations. So it's now down to you to take some of the worst ever conference league teams to the heights of Premiership, not forgetting to balance the books, employ the finest coaches, keep an eye on the ground improvements, and even sell the board advertisements. Think you're up to the challenge?

STEVE JAMES ASSISTANT MANAGER DO TRAINING SCHEDULES TREAT INJURED PLAYERS CHECK SPONSORS BOARDS HIRE AND FIRE EMPLOYEES NEGOTIATE PLAYER CONTRACTS AMIGA Premier Manager 3 certainly retains its reputation for user-friendliness, but with opposition such as On The Ball, maybe is in need of a bit of visual 'tarting up'. The game scores highly for its ease of control and speed of play, but loses a few points for perhaps neglecting to add enough features to be a major progression from PM2. If you're looking for a management game, this is certainly high up on the recommended list, but I'd suggest PM2 owners have a look before shelling out for much the same as before. MATT BROUGHTON BUIDONITOR You can choose how to view each match; selecting the speed of play, as well as watching either tiny players, the ball, or just players' numbers.

As well as towns dotted across the map, there are also all sorts of industries producing and demanding goods. All you have to do is figure a way to make a profit from them. If you don't, you'll go under, because at the same time as you're trying to cash in on one lucrative run so are up to seven other companies. Give it a couple of game years, and things get tough: the towns are huge, the industries are poring out goods, all sorts of stuff is being shuttled back and forth, and new vehicles like monorails and hovercraft are up for grabs if you've got the cash.

For starters the backgrounds have been completely revamped in a polygon stylee and some, including the majorly impressive raft level, even scroll around a set track as you fight. LION He's a brash young martial artist with floppy hair who specialises in fast-paced strings of attacks and is the nearest Virtua equivalent to Ken or Ryu. SHUN Shun is an old codger who's three foot nothing, with a big, baldy slaphead and a long white beard, Shun is pretty hard for an alcoholic prune who looks like he's got his head on upside-down. Once you get used to his moves he turns out to be one of the better people in the game.  GAME BY SEGA CONTACT SEGA (071-373 3000) FOR INFORMATION 86 "

Erm, right... syndicte ome of the more infamous moments of British gun-lore tend to feature such incidents as the loner who's pushed too far, then pushes back at the first person he meets or the copper who 'thought the safety was on' before blowing the top of some guy's head off. And with such incidents in mind, it's a wonder that Syndicate never, despite several attempts, struck a controversial chord with anyone. The potential's still there. While the SNES and Mega Drive versions, whether through technical limitations, or higher forces are fronted with cartoon-like graphics, the Jaguar version is a bullet-by-bullet match to the PC original. Obviously with such small graphics, there's not much gore potential, but programmers Bullfrog succeeded in squeezing out every bloody drop while giving innocent bystanders more occupational hazards than a skinny dipper in a piranha pool. As well as a few more inventive, if less painful, ways to die. The object is to simply take your company to the top of the corporate table by killing or kidnapping execs from rival companies.

"REVIEW CVG PULP FACTION With the world now divided into into several syndicat, ed chunks, certain companies have access to better technology than their rivals. This means bigger weapons and tougher cyborgs, so it's important that you stay ahead of the game and pour plenty of money into research. Obviously civillan casualties can't be avoided, but who cares? It's actually good fun seeing if In you've got enough ammunition Tor at the end of a mission to wipe out the entire population of a small town. T By the time you get to America, the enemy agents you encounter are kitted out with all the best weapons and body parts. The doughnut floating in the middle of the Atlantic is where the final battle takes place, as enemy agents from every syndicate join together to prevent you completing your goal of global conquest. The close-up view is completely pointless. All it does is pixellate the graphics so you can't make out what's going on. SECOND OPINION The only way TEAM SELECTION that your cyborgs are going to survive the later missions is if you invest in some high-tech body parts for them. A new set of eyes will make the shoot accurate, while a state-of-theart chest reduces damage and comes complete with a self-destruct mechanism. Compared to the 16-Bit versions, this is leagues ahead. It retains the dark, moody atmosphere of the original, although the new zoom features are tricky to use and, frankly, pointless. Using the Jag's over-complicated joypad takes some getting used to, especially if you've played the game before with a mouse. Along with Doom, this is one of the best games you can get for the Jag at the moment, and as for the violence bloody great, isn't it? GARY LORD OTHER VERSIONS VERDICT And speaking of self destruct ing. When the going gets real. ly tough and the odds are utterly against you exploding, one of your cyborgs will kill almost everyone on screen at that time.

The Amiga version was the first format that Syndicate appeared on and the subsequent versions haven't differed greatly. SNES and Mega Drive reviews are overleaf. (Turn that page!) A Unlike the ridiculous close-up view, this distance shot let's you see any enemy agents in the area.

JAGUAR Jaguar Syndicate is a perfect conversion of the Amiga and PC originals, although, to my ear at least, some of the sound effects aren't quite as meaty as on the PC version. Still that's a very minor fault in an otherwise excellent game. Using the Jag's joypad takes some getting used to as the controls make full use of the telephone pad, but once you've got that cracked the game's just as playable as ever.

MEGA DRIVE n the next century deregulation and the free market are taken to their extremes in a business environment that makes the current commercial activities of the Tory Party seem positively ethical. Across the globe, syndicates wield political power in the face of nation states by an effective mix of market monopoly and thuggery. Futuristic press gangs abduct civilians, implant them with controlling processors, replace their limbs with cyborg components then send them out to assassinate, abduct and enforce any other elements of the syndicate's business plan. Bullfrog has shaped this warped prophesy into an atmospheric and involved strategy game, with a level of complexity above that of the average console game. The player coordinates 50 different covert operations, equipping his team and dispatching them via a RISK-style global map. The meat of the game takes place in the labyrinthine streets, with plenty of opportunity to wield an Uzi, drive a magnetic bubble car over the speed limit, and slaughter any unfortunate who gets in the way. Syndicate has already become Bullfrog's most successful game, by virtue of the floppy versions. These console conversions have been restyled, with simpler graphics and control system (dealing with the limitations of a joypad) and all missions have been redesigned. MEGA DRIVE yndicate demonstrates Bullfrog's surefootedness with console conversions and its strong bias towards gameplay over presentation. On first play it seems fiddly and overcomplicated, but perseverance really does reap rewards. You can barely swipe a Barclaycard between the SNES and Mega Drive versions, though both are slightly inferior, in my view, to the computer versions in both look and elements of style. But it brings an unexplored genre to the Mega Drive with panache, atmosphere and playability. ANGUS SWAN A Walking on the road is inadvisable. SNES SNES The missions and map layouts differ from the Mega Drive, but graphically it's a lot closer to the Sega format than the earlier floppy versions. Music and FX are better, but a delay between menu and in-game screens has annoyingly crept in. In common with most Bullfrog games, initial playing time is frustrating, with a zillion functions spread across the six buttons. But Syndicate suits the classic definition of a grower.

They are, however, relatively new to Core, whose futuristic crack at LucasArts' crown comes to PC after reasonable success on Amiga. So what's the difference between the two titles? Not a lot really, except that there's a damn sight fewer examples of this genre on Amiga than there are on PC, meaning that Universe has to go some way to be up there with the likes of Indy Fate Of Atlantis and Sam 'n' Max. The story here is that you've been whisked to a parallel anti-matter universe, courtesy of a new time-travelling gizmo constructed by your Uncle George. Which wouldn't be so bad had you told him beforehand that you were taking the trip. Unfortunately, you didn't so it's up to you to find your own way back to Earth. However, unbeknownst to you, old George has figured out what's happened and has beamed himself to this new universe in search of his nephew. And on top of that, the alien rulers of this other dimension have noticed your intrusion into their territory and, believing you to be some big mythical saviour of the oppressed masses, are hot on your tail. PC Good graphics and atmospheric storylines aside, the most essential part of any adventure with aspirations of LucasArts-like success has to be an intelligent structure of action and reaction, so that what you're performing onscreen at least seems logical. Universe doesn't really hack it in this department indeed, I was struggling at the start only to find that I had to perform a bizarre action.

Who'd have guessed it, eh? That's a plot you don't hear often. Anyway, this violent future sport has a difference it's in cars (a bit like in Death Race 2000) which speed around a hazard-laden track (à la Megarace) picking up power-up icons (not unlike those in Speedball). Of course, there are a number of other cars vying for the number one position and you'll have to get past them by hook or by crook (perhaps comparable to Rock 'n' Roll Racing at a push). But hey, there's nothing new under the sun, right kids? What counts is that this ultra-violent future sports simulation is from the team responsible for the critically applauded Skidmarks. Adopting a Micro Machines-esque top-down view of the action and a similar clockwise/anticlockwise steering mechanism Roadkill pits you against eight tooled-up opponents, the destruction of whom is a sure-fire cash-spinner. Finish in the top three and you're through to the next round, lag behind and you lose one of your three lives (although the password system means you can usually restart only a couple of races behind where you died).

"REVIEW CVG The result of failed engagement with a law enforcement officer is a ticket for speeding. 'BLACK ICE? WHERE?' For all the programmers' good intentions when it came to making a realistic driving sim, there's still one fundamental thing which, for the wrong reasons, is one of the game's highlights multiple head-on collisions. God knows how they managed it, but the crashes are the closest thing you get to piling the wrong way down the M25 in fifth. The resulting flips, rolls and impacts are like something out of one of those stuntmen shows they always put on at Easter. Naturally, you get to walk away, limbs intact, from every spill. It's just your no-claims bonus that goes to pot. A Overtaking at high speeds is fairly simple providing the road's straight enough and there's nothing coming the other way. The other drivers are pretty pedestrian, so to speak. They don't care what you're up to as long as you don't get in their way. VERDICT SECOND OPINION It's actually easier to play the game with the external views, but you don't get the same sensation of speed. When I was nine-years-old the thing I wanted most was to be able to drive. If I'd been given a 3DO with The Need For Speed though, I would have been more than content until I got my driving licence. This is the most realistic racing sim, the cars are so lifelike it's unnerving when you hit something head on, and you really do hold your breath when you slip between two on-coming cars. 3D0 salesmen get ready for rush hour!

Not only must he find the missing family dragon, but he also has to gain the approval of the other knights by performing tasks for them and finding his father's ceremonial armour.

Although you can't really select from the band members of Slayer (or Slade), you can choose from a range of fighters, magic-users, thieves, and clerics, and they all come NICE HOUSE, MATE in a range of flavours from Typical.

ISSUE: THIS ONE: 94% VERDICT slayer 3DO I love Doom and I used to enjoy D&D, so Slayer should be right up my street, but it isn't because it fails to satisfy in anyway. Looking at it as a D&D game, it just doesn't have enough depth. Generating characters Just to have them wander around an endless number of mazes is pointless. Even a D&D battle game that played like Doom would have been good, but this isn't even that. A lack of entertaining opponents and the almost non-contact fighting make this a poor cousin for Doom. Go and see Slade instead. TOM GUISE Bad enough that I'm an seethrough spook, now I find out I'm bald too. Bloody great.

"CVG REVIEW MEGA DRIVE SNES Shoot-'em-up Virgin .99/.99 Out Now AMIGA, CD32 and PC versions available No other versions planned Grit those teeth and chomp that cigar, the privates are back on parade for the latest console conversion from those Sensible Softie funsters! cannon MEGA DRIVE ensible Software has in its catalogue enough hits to turn even Cliff green with envy. From the dinosaur days of the Commodore 64 with stonking titles like Parallax and Wizball to modern classics like Sensible Soccer, everything the team puts its hands to hits the spot like a Patriot missile. The latest title, Cannon Fodder, is an overhead shoot-'em-up similar in look and gameplay to The Chaos Engine. The idea is to guide a number of raw recruits through a variety of missions, many of which are multi-stage. The mission squad size varies, but tends to be four or five. Continued mission success results in promotions and this translates into the soldiers having higher weapon and grenade accuracy. All missions require complete annihilation of the enemy soldiers and the buildings they occupy. Buildings can only be destroyed by grenades or bazookas which have to be collected from nearby. These pickups are easily destroyed by a stray bullet and this leads to plenty of tension as troops wander into enemy areas without firing in an attempt to collect them. Later missions require vehicles to be entered, either for easier travel or for destroying larger enemy buildings. Vehicles can also be destroyed by a stray bullet often meaning the only option is to start again. A tactical element is introduced by the ability to split the soldiers into separate units and in later missions this becomes essential as teams can attack on two or more fronts at once. SNES Grenades are found in these square crates. Simply run over them to collect them. SNES AL; ACHE A FRIEN A Bazookas can be found in these round crates. They have a greater range and are more powerful than grenades. ro MISSION IMPOSSIBLE Many of the levels are broken up into multiple mis sions which all need to be successfully accomplished before the next level can be undertaken. Here's an example. MEGA DRIVE SION 5 Lob a couple of grenades at a building to destroy it and the soldiers inside. THE VALLEY OF ICE BRIEFING WITH @ SOLDIERS YOU HUST KILL ALL ENEHV OESTROY ENEMY BUILDING SO RECRUITS REMAINING GO FOR IT A Read the mission brief for clues. The title usually gives away what's going to be in store for that particular mission The Valley of Ice: This mission is pretty straightforward, with no hidden surprises. Plenty of baddies to waste though A Bazooka Army: Quite a toughie this one. Find the bazookas to make wasting the enemy bazooka carriers easier. A My Skidoo: Find the skidoo and climb in. Its speed makes avoiding enemy bazooka fire much easier.  CONTACT VIRGIN (081 960 2255) FOR MORE INFORMATION. 100 "


"REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE fodder MEGA DRIVE Every so often a bird or two flies overhead. They're quite distracting and it's easy to take a shot at one when the going's tense. SECOND OPINION Cannon Fodder is an excellent strategy shoot-'em-up, and although it has a cute look and feel it's not without its blood and guts quotient. The style of the game is original and has that Sensible feel to it, and it's not just mindless shooting since there is a degree of thought required to fathom your way through each level. The graphics on the SNES version are slightly better, but there's not a lot of difference between the two versions. Let's go to war. GARY LORD WAR IS STUPID Cannon Fodder was criticised for being offensive to war veterans but for a shoot-'em-up it gives a pretty good example of the futility of war. ALTERNATIVE CD32 The Chaos Engine Renegade/.99 A similar style of game but faster paced and much, MUCH harder. Features one of the most atmos. pheric pieces of game music too. SNES VERDICT VERDICT AUTO Dead soldiers spray blood and scream, they don't just flash and disappear as in most shoot-'em --ups. ISSUE 151: 88% HEROES IN VICTORY MEGA DRIVE This is an excellent conversion with the only differences being the slightly rougher graphics and lack of vocals on the title track. The mouse control has been transferred perfectly to joypad and is just as instinctive. Gameplay is a joy with plenty of variety, from simple blast fests to more tacticalbased brain teasers. The difficulty curve is well set, but this isn't really a hard game as each level reveals a clear strategy after a couple of plays. Yet another classic for the Sensi team. We suggest you sign up immediately! RIK SKEWS This screen comes up after every level to remind the player of heroes who've been killed. SNES Much the same comments apply to the SNES version as on the Mega Drive, although the graphics are more faithful to the Amiga original and the sound is naturally better (still no vocals on the title tune though!). This is a brilliant game basically. I wish Sensible Software would release a crap game because I feel like I'm trying to get into their pants as they get so much praise from me! Cannon Fodder certainly isn't a crap game though, and it's as highly recommended as its Mega Drive brother. Get ready to leave the trenches. RIK SKEWS MEGA DRIVE The arrow is pointing out a wounded enemy. Sometimes soldiers take more than one hit to kill.

"CVG REVIEW AMIGA Shoot-'em-up Virgin .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned at present but Mega Drive, SNES and PC versions likely Frank, Tubby and the rest of the Cannon Fodder crew go once more into the breach, beach, desert and this time even outer space... Most mis. sions require all enemy soldiers and buildings to be wiped out, but there are some exceptions. On this level a switch needs activating before a spaceship will land and whisk the player's troops away. quip some Sensi Soccer sprites with big sod-off guns, dump them in the jungle and what do you get? Cannon Fodder that's what. Released a year ago, the topdown view shoot-'em-up was another smash hit for the Sensi team. A further 72 stages await you in Fodder 2, but the levels have far more variety and more Sensi weirdness than the original. This time round the game starts off in Beirut, but it's not long before the troops are whisked off by a spaceship to fight in an alien war. Despite being crack troopers they're not up to fighting aliens, and consequently they get sent back in time to hone their skills against medieval knights and 1930s gangsters. It's certainly tough going but as in the first game limited supplies of grenades and bazookas can be picked up to aid the soldiers in their quest, while vehicles can be used for protection and speedy travel. The neat touch is that the vehicles are context sensitive. So the medieval levels, for instance, offer the chance to ride a mechanical dragon and charge with battering rams. Cannon Fodder might use the same game engine as its predeces. sor but there are plenty of new ideas on offer. As the title screen says: 'War has only been this much fun once before'. cannon fodder 2 Here the only way to kill the guards behind the fence is to find some grenades and lob them in. VERDICT AMIGA This is better than the original thanks to moro level variety and depth. Levels are a lot less maze like in structure while some are linked Tower Assault style. Graphically it's much the same, but sound has been beefed up with another amusing title tune and better quality FX. My only real complaint is that the loading times are sluggish, but overall this is another winning product from the Sensl crew. Be warned though, apart from Probotector on Mega Drive, Cannon Fodder 2 is the toughest game l've ever played. RIK SKEWS Cannon Fodder 2 starts off in Beirut and the levels here are like many in the first game. Later levels are more var. ied though. A Enemies can be shot as long as wanted and each hit sends their bodies higher into the air. Tasteful huh? A Cannon Fodder 2 is a lot more open and less maze-like than its predecessor. The routes through a level are also less linear. Aliens don't just appear from generators, they also leap out of these holes in the spaceship floor. GRAPHICS 82 SOUND 89 PLAYABILITY 90 VALUE 88 ALTERNATIVE SNES/MEGA DRIVE Cannon Fodder Virgin/.99/44.99 Just released, this is a brilliant conversion of the Amiga original with the intuitive mouse control faithfully converted to Joypad and is reviewed on the previous page. OVERALL Whereas the first game featured squawking birds flying through the air, the space levels in Cannon Fodder 2 sport bulging eyes! 90 The game keeps a count of losses, how cheering don'tcha fink? Cannon Fodder 2 is not for shoot-'em-up virgins since it's so tough. GAME BY SENSIBLE SOFTWARE CONTACT VIRGIN (081-960 2255) FOR INFORMATION 102 "

"REVIEWS CVG supershorts 2 A fab new (ish) look for Super Shorts this month, but the same old name, I'm afraid. Never mind though, eh? Just read it. snes I JOE & MAC 3 nc mega-cd snes SAMURAI SHODOWN amiga STAR CRUSADER EYE OF THE BEHOLDER CRYSTAL DRAGON 84 All of you The tuinone o 86 Conversion of the much lauded Neo Geo beat'em-up featuring an array of weapon-toting Japanese types. Dropping and picking up your side-arm in the midst of combat adds a new element to the ordinarily pretty exhausted one-on-one fighter format. Worth a look. ETBC Latest in the series whose longevity defies belief especially considering poor sales. If you're a cave fan you'll be pleased to hear the dino-based platform beat-'em-uppery has been supplemented by new projectile attacks and loads more levels. Otherwise, don't bother. 1 ETBC Right, let's get this out of the way at the startthis isn't as good as TIE Fighter. However, if you've completed it you may be interested in this. The graphics are very clever, but not that attractive, and the plot makes you want to get further ahead. For die hards only, though. .99 Icon controls make this role playing game a piece of cake to get into, but the hugeness of the adventure and the rock puzzles mean it's a lot harder to get out of. Not quite up there with Snatcher, but without doubt a highly ace roleplayer for all you roleplaying types. .99 Graphically, this RPG looks a little dated, but the gameplay is right bang up to date. It's tough, so you'd better have a lot of patience before tackling the task, but the whole thing is as rewarding as it is taxing. Certainly one for cerebellum fans to take note of. .99 snes DC I ALIEN LEGACY game boy_ amiga FIELDS OF GLORY snes MADDEN '95 INHL '95 I TARZAN They just keep coming, these Electronic Arts sports updates. Here's another one for all you ice hockey aficionados who've missed out on your four or ten previous opportunities to pick up a conversion of your fave sport. It's not bad, if you're interested but you probably won't be. TBC Game where you've got to wander around building stuff and picking up some other stuff, according to the rather undernourished manual. The game itself isn't bad, but it's very confused. There are better games of this ilk already available, and you probably have one already. .99 Indulge in the ultraBritish pastime of French bashing with this Napoleonic-era wargame. While it's possible to pull off some incredibly deep strategies it's actually possible to win just by wading straight in. You won't get the most out of this unless you try hard. .99 A Game Boy platformer oh be still my beating heart. This one's got some good ideas, but the object-hunting basis of the gameplay is undermined by the time limits which render it technically impossible to collect all the objects without losing a life. Get Kirby or Wario instead. ETBC It's surprising how many SNES owners don't own a Madden game, despite there being about 400 billion versions. You can tell Christmas is just around the corner, because here's the latest installment. Brilliant if you don't own a prequel, pointless if you do. .99 DC THE CLUE mega drive mega-cd nc CYCLEMANIA amiga PSYCHO PINBALL MICKEY MANIA CD I CORKERS COMPILATION A4 29 Play as a dirty, filthy thief in this Austrian adventure set in a hilariously stereotyped cod-London. Visit the Fat Man Pub! Steal their loot! Buy an oxy-acetylene torch and do it all over again! Absolutely brilliant, although the graphics and interface are both very off-putting. .99 Pinball games. Love 'em or hate 'em, you probably hate 'em. This one, however, actually fulfils the claims of the software house and is the most realistic conversion of the game to date. Four tables, loads of sub-games and plenty of steel-springing excitement. Brilliant. .99 Platform frolics hit the CD add-on once again thanks to those wily folks at Disney and Sony. The graphics are superb and some of the in-level ideas are quite novel. However, the pace of the game is rather slow, which can be extremely irritating. Not Earthworm Jim.   Schmimulation, that's Cyclemania's attitude to 'traditional PC gaming. This is a full-throttle arcade razzle-fest sporting lovely graphics. A little limited at only five tracks long, but great fun all the while. The best bike racing game on the PC so far, that's what we reckon. .99 VFM compilation comprising Blob, skill game, Blastar, a no-frills blastathon, Cyberpunks, a kind of Kindergarten Chaos Engine and platformer Wonderdog. which was born to be a budget game. So perhaps they should have called it Underdog. Ha ha. .99 102 "

"REVIEWS CVG out now Helping you see the wood for the trees is CVG's quick recap of some excellent software currently doing the rounds of a games store of your choice right now. Go get 'em... carts carts DC MAGIC CARPET carts carts DONKEY KONG COUNTRY DINO DINI'S SOCCER RUGBY WORLD CUP ALIEN VS PREDATOR SNES Issue 157 90% Nintendo's 32-bit platformer for its 16-bit machine is an essential purchase as no SNES game is going to look better than this. And don't worry about the gameplay as the game is replete with all the necessary ingredients. MEGA DRIVE issue 157 85% If you have a Mega Drive, and you don't have a decent footie game, then this is the one to get. Admittedly the controls take a bit of getting used to but aside from this there's a multiplicity of moves and tactics that make this a joy to play. PC CD-ROM issue 157 96% What will be hailed as the PC game of the year is Bullfrog's magic Carpet. No business sims here though, this is an arcade blast of the highest order with masses and masses of detail, and looks like an absolute dream. Pentium recommended. MEGA DRIVE issue 157 91% Great rugby computer games have not been aplenty, but that's all set to change with the advent of Rugby World Cup from those sports games aficinados EA Sports. Instinctive and incredibly realistic it hooks you in from the beginning. JAGUAR issue 156 90% What the Jaguar needs is an arcade Doom-style shoot-'em-up affair that has been programmed well, stylish sprites and enough firepower to blow any another new console game in to touch. And by chance that's just what Alien Vs Predator is. nc amiga carts carts NOVASTORM ZEE WOLF PITFALL 2 I VIRTUA RACING DELUXE MAD DOG MCCREE PC CD-ROM issue 157 87% A 3D shoot-'em-up on the PC that is akin to Rebel Assault, but it looks even better because of the rather top lookin' rendered backgrounds and spot fx. And a pounding soundtrack to boot. Without doubt one of the best PC shoot-'em-ups. A1200 Issue 157 91% Inspired by games of the ilk of Thrust, Desert Strike, Sub-Terrania et al this is as classy a tactical shoot-'em-up that you will come across. You take on the role of a futuristic mercenary who has a host of taxing missions to complete. MEGA DRIVE/SNES issue 157 91%/92% Cool platformers are just perfect for the SNES, and that is the only slightly) better version here, but both are huge, sprawling, beautifully animated affairs based around a central sprite that is a joy to watch as he runs, crawls, swings and slides. MEGA DRIVE 32X issue 157 93% One of the first titles to arrive for the Mega Drive 32X (and don't forget to use your  discount voucher included with the machine), and it not only plays like a dream but it's virtually arcade perfect. The two new cars add an extra element too. CD-1 issue 157 82% If you enjoyed this in the arcades then you'll enjoy this shooterama, as the FMV is excellent as you go Wild West to root, toot and shoot all those varmint. V. pricey at  but nonetheless fun. A TV no smaller than 21-inches is recommended. amiga carts OC carts handheld DREAMWEB ECSTATICA PROBOTECTOR IHEBEREKI'S POPOON MICRO MACHINES 2 A1200 issue 157 86% A tantalising graphic adventure that gets a bit lascivious, hence its 18rating. Moody and atmospheric graphics add to the violence and the sinister plot of this top-down view game. Men in macs beware, however, the sex scenes are over-hyped. SNES issue 157 91% Another Tetris clone, but with an exciting two player mode that will have you and a friend battling over who can align the most Popoons cute beans from the Mean Bean Machine. Furiouslypaced, this is a real test of skill and strategy. PC CD ROM issue 157 90% An expensive month for PC owners with this and Magic Carpet. Ecstatica is an adventure game set in the year 928, and you have to contend with the likes of minotaurs. Similar, gameplay wise to Alone in the Dark, and it has graphics to die for. MEGA DRIVE issue 156 94% MM2 plays like the original, only with more vehicles and tougher tracks. No flash graphics, just solid gameplay and the most fun you can have with four people, a TV, a Mega Drive and a J-Cart Believe us we've tried everything else. GAME BOY issue 155 84% Overhead and horizontal scrolling combined in one five level shoot-'em-up. You get some hefty hardware from level one that can be upgraded into something even heftier. Close to the SNES original but without a simultaneous two-player option. 109 "

"COMPETITION CVG ceva booking out... COMPO! MAXIS t's funny that, because booking out is exactly what your character does when it dies in a game. It books out of the little bit of silicon life it had and drops away into the bottom of your machine's case where it rots away into an itty-bitty pile of dust. And as whole civilisations perish in Sim City 2000, it probably explains why PCs are so dusty inside. But you can prevent this needless slaughter with the aid of these handy game manuals from, well, Computer Manuals. Their comprehensive book list includes official guides to such gems as Sim City 2000, Under A Killing Moon, Myst, Doom 2 and Microsoft Space Simulator. We're giving away four of each of the above books so twenty winners will each be getting a book of their choice and all you need to do to win one is answer the following questionette: What does TIE (as in TIE Fighter) stand for?

Andy McVitie, Editor The fact that I'm still playing Nintendo Magazine System Donkey Kong Country is a measure of the quality of the game. On the new side, Super Punch Out is one of those games that's so good it's actually a pleasure watching someone else play it. In the NMS Office it'll soon be a spectator sport in its own right. Steve Merrett, Editor All praise the new king of conMean Machines soles the Saturn is here! Virtua Fighter is quite simply the best game I have played this year, and office beatings are now more commonplace than coffee breaks. Apart from that... actually, that's a complete lie. Virtua Fighter is all we've been playing. Sorry. Richard Leadbetter, Editor It's a bit glitchy in places, but Sega Magazine there's no denying that there's only one true Next Generation game out now (to people willing to pay up to  for an import machine) and that game is Virtua Fighter on Saturn. It's simply incredible, an audio-visual feast of unprecedented proportions. If you're one of those wonderful early birds who buys us as soon as we come out, you could be in line for a wonderful  worth of gift vouchers to spend on any games you want. On the other hand, if you're reading this in January, shame on you for buying us late, but we'll let you enter the comp anyway because we're such nice joes.

Again. 00000000 This month I've had the priviAndy Nuttal, Editor The One for Amiga Games lege of being the first Amiga journalist to preview Chaos Engine 2, and from what I've seen it's going to be excellent. On a more general note, it's good to see after a shakey spell, the Amiga is once again home to brilliant Xmas games. Hurrah!!! And your question is... What nationality is CVG's editorial director David Kelly? David Upchurch, Editor Tube. No I don't need a nasal PC Games decongestant, it's a game called Tube, which and I've been allowed to indulge in a rare spot of Big Eds propaganda here you'll only ever see on the next PC Games coverdisk.

This time round it's Wolf, from US Gold. It's really novel, you get to be a wolf, hunt, sleep, eat and do everything in a wolven fashion.

Steve James, Managing Editor This month's biggie Computer and Video Games could be none other than the release of the Sega Saturn.

THE HORDE It's tricky, it's taxing but it's jolly good fun. Here are a few tips on how to make some extra cash out of your cows. Always place your cows at least two squares apart otherwise they'll end up turning the land to rubble. Also, place a bomb, or knight, next to a slab of meat, which should attract the Hordlings straight away, leaving you more time to deal with any stragglers. During the building sequence before the last winter of a level, dig up any trees, cows, knights and other objects then cash them in for crowns as you won't be able to take them with you to the next level. One of the most powerful weapons that you'll find in your arsenal is the flute. When used in conjunction with the morning star, it attracts Hordlings straight to it. You can also use the music to lead them to a watery grave in nearby lakes and rivers.

Always try and establish your colony so that it's close to water and at least one resource that isn't too close to an Indian vil lage. Build it with the soldier, since you won't be attacked in the early stages, and use the pioneer to clear some land for crop Mis Iroquois le pass t U plois growing De feuille Ile Set It's imperative that you obtain a scout Coate int o this Posts early on so he can track down all the treasure discs in the game. However, searching a burial mound that's close to an indian village is liable to start a war. Meanwhile, back at the colony, aim to build rescource-multiplying buildings such as lumber mills and a blacksmith's shop as soon as possible. Don't forget to send goods back to Europe to trade. It helps if you send a ship with a full cargo since each time the same goods tum up on the con tinent the price dips. Don't worry about defending yourself to begin with. It's only when you start expanding that you'll come under attack from nervous Indians and other Europeans. By this time you should have a maga zine and a gunsmith working away in one of your colonies. And remember to link all your colonies by roads so you can transport men and goods easily Now if you're the kind of adept, or even adroit, gamesplayer who is usually the first to discover something secret in a game: or you just want to tell the world about a hint or cheat on your current fave game, then send it in to CVG, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU.

ALIEN HYPE SCORE: 00000 35000 Dear Sirs, Please can I just say that this is a general enquiry and I have no wish to have it published. I was looking at issue 156 November '94 and I saw two things. Firstly, in your news section, you had a small feature on the Alien Trilogy game for the Satum and it said that it is planned for the 32x as well. Please can you tell me if the 32X version will need a Mega CD to run it? Also, in your brilliant review of Alien v Predator on the Jaguar, you said that it could become one of the greatest SCIfi movies this decade and as well as that, in the alien profile, you said that they have a Hollywood contract for a fourth movie. Please could you shed some light on the subject as am an avid Aliens fan. I would really appreciate it if you could help me out with all of this, and congratulations on your big and brilliant mag Richard Taylor, Eastbourne CVG: This is more like it. What a nice polite young gentleman. We'd be only too happy to answer your questions. Alien Trilogy should be a cartridgeonly project, so don't worry about picking up a CD-ROM drive. As for the fourth Alien film, well that's a matter of some conjecture. The last we heard Ripley, Hicks, et al make a staggering reappearance. It turns out Alien 3 was just a bad dream (which is exactly what anyone who saw it wished it was) and they carry on from the end of Aliens. Sounds a bit crap really. 118 "

CVG: Jag's probably your best bet for games, but CD-i has the multimedia advantage 2 I've got a PC and want to get a new game. What's the best out of FIFA Soccer. Theme Park. Sim City 2000 and Doom 2? CVG: Depends whether you want a sports title, a god game or a shoot'em up. Go for Doom 2 if you don't have the original, otherwise Sim City 2000 is probably the safest bet. 3 What's the best machine out of the Jaguar. CD-i, Saturn and the Ultra 64? CVG: You've already asked that. The Ultra 64 isn't even real yet, 4 Will FIFA :95 come out on the Jaguar, CD1 or the PC? CVG: It'll probably surface on the PC, but I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for the other formats. 5 Is Alien V Predator on the Jag worth getting? CVG: Yes 6 Does the CD add-on for the Jag play music CDs? CVG: Yes. CVG: Right. Er, you're in luck actually. This month features an in-depth head-to-head Super Turbo V Mortal Il special (and If you turn to page 43), so hopefully any Information you require will be in there. SSF2TX is not coming out for the Mega-CD, sorry. But thanks for writing anyway. SO YOU DREAM OF THE 3DO? OK CVG, You guys know all there is to know about the 3DO so could you please answer my questions: Luke Mutlu, Fulham, London BLIMEY THESE ARE GOOD ONES Dear CVG, I am thinking of buying one of the new 32-/64-BIT machines. But before I buy one I would like to ask the experts a few questions. Sorry about all the questions but they have been puzzling me for ages. Thanks for your time. David Taaffe, Co Louth, Ireland 1 Will the Sony Playstanon or Sega Saturn be out over here around Christmas? CVG: Only in the most Import of stylees, I'm afrald. 2 Which is better, the 3D0 or the Jaguar? CVG: As we said earlier in this section, they're on level pegging so far as all-round quality goes right now. 3 When the 64-bit add-on for the 3DO is released will that make it better than the PlayStation or even the Ultra 64 (when it is released)? CVG No, no, no, no, no. 4 How many buttons are on the 3DO controller? CVG: Seven, counting the Play and Stop buttons which some games utilise 5 Is there a big difference between CDs and cartridges and can technology change that? CVG: Blimey, that's a good question. Well, gDs are cheaper and ca hold more information, but the technol1 Will SNK bring out any other titles on the 3DO apart from Samurai Shodown? CVG: No-one's sald afything yet, but you never can tell. We bet that they could well plump for Art of Fighting (but that is mainly based on rumour started by us, but it would be a bloody brilliant game don't you think Mr SNK Development Man? We think so). Nevertheless, be sure to read what we think of Sam shodown on page 66-67. 2 Will Capcom bring out any other titles for the BDO apart from Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo X? CVG: Maybe, maybe not. But if It's a review of Street Fighter on 3D0 haven't you seen our special plece starting on page 43? What's up, is your name Helen Keller of something? 3 Will there be any more Star Wars games on the 3DO apart from Rebel Assault? CVG: Dark Forces from LucasArts is a probably going to be a good bet. 4 Will any racing car games come out on the 3D0 like Daytona USA and Ridge Racer? CVG: Read all you want about Need For Speed in this very issue. Believe us these graphics look even better moving. See pages 94/95 for the full monty. ogy to read them is more expensive and there can be annoying lags when the game loads as you play. Updated CD technology could eliminate this, and a super-chip made of special allen fibres found on Venus could possibly be the key to massive storage space on ROM chips which cost virtually nothing and are lighter than air. 6 Do you need an extra bit of hardware to watch FMV clips on games like Road Rash on the 3DOR CVG: No 7 Do American/Japanese 3Do garnes work on the PAL version or is it like the SNES you need a convertor? CVG: No, and you can't get a conyertor because it's a CD console with no cart port for CDX-type device. 8 Is Total Eclipse on the 3DO any good? CVG: It's OK, it's not brilliant. 9 Is Cybermorph (Jag) any good? CVG: No. 10 Are these the only games that come with the machines or can you get different packs? CVG: These are the only ones as yet, sorry. Aih 119 "

"PREDICTING THE TRENDS CVG TEKNO taking the plunge The new machines are arriving on our shores, and even software companies can't foresee which ones will dominate. We go behind the scenes at Gametek to see how one business is bracing itself against the next big wave... A These are the roughs for the characters in Brutal 20,000, after this it's the models then onto an SGI machine. DE BE 3DO, Saturn, PlayStation, Nintendo Ultra 64? Games players aren't the only ones being buffeted by the maelstrom of new consoles. Predicting which systems will make it big is nigh-on impossible especially if you're a software house planning to take the plunge and throw millions into development. Like many companies at the moment, Gametek, which has predominately operated in the console market, is increasingly moving back into PC. And it's through this machine that companies hope to slip sideways into the new console market without risking their pension funds... code. The basics can be produced on PC then ported relatively easily across the different systems. As most music on these machines is read straight from the CD it's the processor speed and graphics hardware which will make the main difference. Apart from letting a softco test the water with a game in the PC market, it also means that games can be produced independent of the console companies who are notoriously unpredictable when it comes to approving games for release. Then there's the royalty fees: $6 from every 3D0 game sold goes to the 3DO corporation while the fee for Sega, Sony and Nintendo's machines is reputed to be somewhere in the order of $12-$16. Looking at the market as a whole, with the Ultra 64 specs just coming to light, it seems as though there are two firm candidates for next year Saturn and PlayStation. 'Technically the current 3DO doesn't come close to PlayStation, and because of its relatively small user base they'll have a hard time selling the 3D02 into the home,' says producer Dave Lynch. Bear in mind that these are one person's opinions, and that other companies are more positive about 3DO (Panasonic's new, cheaper 300 just launched in Japan is expect. ed to ship to the UK, and the Goldstar model, here before next Spring, is allegedly less expensive, too). Currently, however, it's the PlayStation that's the favourite toy of many programmers around the country.

"PREDICTING THE TRENDS CVG TEKNO taking the plunge In truth, the 32X's capabilities bring it up to Amiga level for bitmapped graphics. 000 Punishe SEE buffer costs money and putting in a quad-speed drive would mean upping the price by around . continued from page 123 development kits were sent out, the PlayStation came in one handy unit, while Saturn updates were appearing every few months as Sega attempted to pre-empt the power of the Sony machine. On paper it certainly seems to be the most powerful, and according to Dave 'it's awe some on 3D. As for existing official technology it still has a future, as does the 32X in Dave's opinion, the biggest boost it gives to the Mega Drive is colour, but it doesn't offer anything like the power of the Saturn or PlayStation The biggest problem with it is that you're now able to do more with games but still have the difficulty of fitting them onto a cartridge. The move against silicon-based storage is the main reason for hardware companies current drive towards CD-based systems. While compact disc is far from the ideal format [ from the ideal format the access times are appallingly slow it's highly cost-effective. Even on double-speed systems, it costs just over 40p to duplicate a disc about  less than a cartridge. There isn't an easy solution to the speed problem. Increasing the RAM Brutal Facts Gametek's first 32-Bit game will be an enhanced version of their 16-Bit cartoon beat 'em-up Brutal. By just improving on the existing game they're able to have one of the first third party games on the system, as the development time for an original 32-Bit product can be anywhere from nine to 18 months. Working on the 32X development kit turned up a few surprises. Firstly that the Mega Drive's 16-Bit processor can be used in tandem with the two 32-Bit ones in the 32X. But once again, the more clever things you try to do, the more memory is taken, the larger the cartridge becomes and the higher the price goes. So Brutal 32x, rather than being a radical departure from the other versions, will be more of an update, a trend we'll be seeing from many software houses. And with the relatively small Mega-CD user base, it doesn't look like continued on next page EEO gateway to hell TRE A Quarantine on 32X should be a straight conversion from the PC original. Game's such as Gametek's forthcoming PC CD adventure, Hell, are comparatively easy to convert as the graphics are just streamed video footage and the core of the game is written in C.

"CVG PREDICTING THE TRENDS TEKNO taking the plunge Repffe\" Vendomatic REPAIR 030 SECONO5 ODS many publishers will be making the move to CD-based 32X product. But producing a game for the Saturn is a completely different prospect, with its vastly increased graphic capabilities and faster processors. Brutal 20,000 is currently going into development for the system. Gametek has set aside two Silicon Graphics workstations and a model maker for its development but whereas in the old days graphics were produced straight from sketches, or originated on computer, now 3D models are required to make sure the images are accurately rendered in the game.

'It's bad practice to look at the hardware and force games to use the new features. You should see what the hardware can do and work towards that,' says Lynch. Let's just hope that's what happen and we're not barraged with the 32-Bit equivalents of Kriss Kross Make My Video.

Even if it would have been technically possible, chances are that a couple of years ago consumer-sen sitive Sega wouldn't have approved a game where you, as the world's most dan gerous cabbie, spend as much time running over passengers as picking them up and customers get up to all sorts of unsavoury things in the back seat!
