No human has set foot on it for centuries. The androids are super-intelligent and like all intelligent beings they have become stupid! They created a race of menial droids to carry out mining and other naff jobs so that they could sit about having a good time! But there was one android who hit out at this state of affairs. His name was Socrates and he was deprogrammed and turned into a droid for his rebellious thoughts! But he still continued fighting for his belief that all androids are equal and on his dying day transferred his rebellious thoughts to a receptive droid. This droid then sets off on a quest to find three envelopes which contain the necessary data to enable him to reprogram himself at the central computer and save the world! As you can see from our screen shots the graphics are pretty neat! NuWave isn't some kind of shampoo it's a new software label.

And once again Keith Campbell's Adventure Helpline was besieged with people wanting help, advice and guidance. And we're proud to say all the back issues of C+VG brought along to show were all snapped up along with T-shirts, A new organisation for youngsters interested in wanting to find out more about computing has been launched by the British Computer Society. The Association of Young Computer Enthusiasts (AYCE) is aimed at people aged 11 to 18 and will cost  a year.

World Karate champion Jeoff Thompson tries out the new C+VG T-shirt and bags of goodies. C+VG's new Big Red T-shirt also caused quite a stir and looks like being a big, big hit. You can see how it packs a punch from our photograph of the T-shirt and World Karate champion Jeoff Thompson, who was at the show promoting Melbourne House's Way of the Exploding Fist. Champagne Corks popped when bank clerk Nigel Parsons received a JVC MSX micro for winning a competition based on Electric Software's The Wreck game run in the June issue of Computer + Video Games. Nigel, from Cardiff, received the micro at Electric Software's stand at the Personal Computer World Show held in September at Olympia, London. With him were Electric Software's Mike Hall and MSX's Pieter Glas. Some people make you really sick don't they! Especially when they win vast sums of crinkly brown folding stuff money to you! One of those people is 15-year-old Matthew Woodley who will down in computer gaming history as the person who actually SOLVED Domark's Eureka! Matthew picked up his giant ,000 cheque of the Personal Computer World Show. Domark supremos Mark Strachan and Dominic Wheatley even managed to smile as they handed over the cash! Matthew was just one of the 100,000s of people who have been getting up to strange things in an attempt to solve the fiveadventure riddle. Now many of them have been reduced to tears by the news that Matthew from Middlesex discovered the secret phone number. Matthew spent much of his spare time working on Eureka! which his brother purchased soon after the game was released last year. \"My brother Mark bought the game originally,\" Matthew told C+VG, \"But he went away to Reading University so I got my hands on it! He's really sick now! But I'll give him a share..\" What is he going to do with all the pennies? 'Well I think I'll get a Commodore 128 and all the peripherals and then invest the rest.\" Matthew didn't win the big prize without a few false alarms however. He once rang someone up and asked for the Prime Minister because he thought that was the answer. \"The lady at the end got very confused!\" said Matthew When he's not playing computer games he owns up to being more of an arcade game fon than an adventurer Matthew enjoys playing all sorts of sport. Perhaps that's why his favourite C64 game right now is Summer Games II. Motthew finally solved the game on August 29th the day that he gave up his paper round. Fortunately he won't be needing the pocket money any more! Anyway, C+VG would like to add our congratulations the prize couldn't have been won by a nicer gamester! Perhaps he'll be able to afford a subscription to C+VG now...

If anyone out there knows any tricks/tips on Atari's I Robot arcade machine do drop me a line as I have just started zapping into the early hours of the morning with my new toy... Talking of which has anyone out there beaten my record on Tempest (the Atari arcade machine) 676,705 level 67? pumping. It's spot on and places the game in a niche of its own when it comes to presentation. The graphics for the comets, ship and satellites are crisp and sharply detailed, coupled with three excellent tunes, makes the game a hot property! The music for this game was written by the same person who did the music for Thing on a Spring and Monty on the Run. Need I say more? You have three ships to start with and extra ships awarded for every 10,000 points. There are three high score tables (Points, Ultra and Galactic!) and a total of 255 levels (higher waves featuring more comets at a faster pace pulsing different colours). My only real gripe with this game is that the player cannot turn his ship around (arcade officienados may just miss this one...) to fire in all eight directions. This aside the action is fast, frenetic, colourful and down-right addictive. Crazy Comets will not stun you with its variety of screens but it is an exciting, compulsive and polished product all you zapper fans will appreciate. Now, if you will excuse me, I have some serious zapping to do SILENCE. My world is filled with darkness â€” yet a sliver of light streaks towards me. It approaches. Suddenly the ground trembles beneath me ...A full deep rhythmic beat fills my senses and the sky is filled with flaming comets.. Crazy Comets from Martech is here, so get into the groove because this one's for you! Martech is not well known for its arcade titles but this is about to change. Crazy Comets is a stunning reproduction of the arcade game Mad Planets. The game involves the shameless annihilation of hundreds of Crazy Comets that are spinning out of control. At your disposal is a zapper ship that can move all around the screen and your fire power is restricted to the vertical (up the screen). The comets enter the fray from all sides of the screen and slowly grow in size. You must try to destroy them before they reach supernovae condition. The comets spin around you as they grow in size and if contact is made you lose a ship. The comets are restricted in as much as they can only destroy your ship if they touch its base (the ship being in the form of a pyramid). As you zap the comets they change colour and flames leap from the planet surface. As if that is not enough the comets rotate as they spin around you and as they grow weak they spin faster and home in mercilessly on your ship. When you clear a sequence of rounds there are bonus waves where you can rescue space capsules for bonus points. Throughout the game there is a backing rhythm beat that really gets the adrenalin All you Marble Madness freaks can now sleep easy. An American software house is currently writing the official licensed versions for both the Commodore 64 and the Amiga. I will be previewing it exclusively for you as soon as it lands in my sweaty little mits! So tell your friends. Throwing your spacecraft into a 90 degree turn can cause havoc with your joystick. And making your supersports hero pound along the athletics track by waggling the joystick from side to side subjects it to great wear and tear. But now comes a baseless joystick which should solve all those problems. \"The Stick\" is from the Merseyside company Lightwave Leisure. It consists simply of a shaft, with no console, trigger switches or micro switches, just tilt switches. These are glass tubes about 1cm long, set at an angle, into which two contacts protrude at one end. A small drop of mercury is sealed into the tube. There are two fire buttons for the thumb and index finger and a standard ninehole Atari type connector. \"The Stick\" costs .99. Has anyone been bitten by the Monty on the Run bug yet? Isn't the music good? Not to mention the game! If you should be having problems with the game its author told me that a cheat mode is built in. Simply type: 1 want to ... on the high score table. What can the last word be? Have you always suspected somebody or something is living inside your computer? Who or what causes all those program errors, bugs and glitches? Well, thanks to an amazing scientific breakthrough in the United States, the existence of a life form inside your computer has been proved beyond all doubt. Officially they are known as a Little Computer Person or LCP for short. This fantastic discovery was made by David Crane, one of the leaders of the Activision Research Group Now Activision is making its amazing program available to Commodore 64 owners who will be invited to join in the vital research into LCPs. The Activision Little People Discovery Kit will be available soon in Great Britain. It includes a replica of the \"computer house\" which was first used to lure the LCPs out into the open. There is also an LCP owners guide. All owners must be responsible for providing food and water But Activision warns that ownership of a LCP is a very serious business. They need lots of care, affection and attention. Watch out for what will probably be the hottest game yet from System 3 Software. A sequel to Deathstar Interceptor is being written by none other than Tony Crowther based on the Trench scene from Star Wars. A new software house, Sabre Technology and Software, is releasing two games in time for Christmas. The first is The Crystal Step, Amstrad .95.

So BLOB sets off in his spacecraft with just an A-Z to the Galaxy for company. His spacecraft comes down with a bit of a bump leaving BLOB high and dry on a planet, which is about to explode and with only a short time to rebuid the core. Still, with your help he'll soon be zapping around the underground caverns collecting objects, discovering secrets and solving puzzles meanwhile you'll be having a great time! The planet is inhabited by alien creatures who drain poor old BLOB's energy on contact. But he can zap them if he's quick enough! To help him get about, BLOB has platforms which he can drop and stand on. Useful for getting over tall obstacles when you haven't got one of the space-hoppers which you can use to fly about on. You'll find Hoppers dotted about in the cavernsalong with teleports, weapons packs, key codes and cards. Lots of puzzles, great graphics over 400 screens, some of the best sound ever from the Spectrum and a cute hero. What more could you ask for? The money to buy the game of course!

Shinning up and down ropes and ladders gain him entry to new locations, but there are other ways! The Spectrum and Commodore versions have been released almost together which presents us with a chance to dissect them both. Well, the plot is the same. The graphics are virtually the same quality, though there are more flower pots and a C5 in the Commodore one! The House However there is a big difference in the games the sound. The Spectrum is not noted for its sound. The Commodore game explodes into life with the best sound we have yet encountered. It has a strong beat that draws even Monty to sway in time to the tune. The game is a great test of timing requiring lots of thought to work your way through the locations without getting stuck All the locations contain some of the hazards but they also have unique touches added like telephone box lookalikes, lifts or beam-me-up-Scotty machines and fighting off the nasties is impossible fun! Monty on the Run is a worthy successor to the excellent Monty is Innocent. If you're a climbing game fanatic then this is the game should get it's what Jet Set Willy Il should have been.

Slip into your leathers, grab your skid lid and prepare for a real blast! Speed King does for the Commodore what Full Throttle did for the Spectrum. Which is not surprising as Mervyn Escourt wrote both games! It brings the thrills of promotorcycle racing to the small screen. You have all the power of a 500cc racing bike at your fingertips in a Pole Position style race game. You can choose to race on any one of ten world famous circuits and there are three skill levels too. The animation of your bike racer is really nice. He leans into corners and crouches over the tank of his machine in true racing fashion. Like many racing games, you can't really tell if the tracks are any different but at least in this one the scenery does change slightly when you choose a different track to compete on. The other riders are prone to bumping you from behind. That's if you manage to overtake many of them that is! It's essential to learn the circuit before you start racing so you know the right line to ride in order to get a good finishing position. It's also essential to learn how to use the gears efficiently. There are six on your highpowered bike. You have to take your finger off the accelerator to change up or down which often causes problems, especially if you are being chased by a bunch of other bikes. Overtaking is very tricky but not impossible. It just takes practice! But even if you don't win there's always the joy of setting a new lap record. At the finish of each race which can last anything from just two to six laps you get a nice display which details your race performance Speed King is well presented fun to play. Recommended.

But things have slowed down on the 64 and the game has suffered. The basic idea of Fractalus is to pilot your Valkyrie fighter over a hostile planet rescuing fellow pilots who have fallen victim to the laser towers and enemy ships which patrol the skies. You have to monitor your instruments to spot the fallen pilots' homing beacons, watch out for enemy ships and blast the mountain top laser towers all the while zapping along between jagged peaks and down into deadly rock filled valleys. You must land near the pilots watch for their flashing beacons among the rocks and they come trudging wearily over to your ship. They bang on your airlock door, you open it and they climb in. This is accompanied by some neat sound effects! Then it's off to find more pilots or if the mothership is around back to base to drop off the rescued fliers. Initially Rescue is a fun game but it does get a bit boring after a lengthy session with your 64. The Atari version is completely the reverse it'll keep you hooked for hours. Must be something to do with the speed! Rescue comes with a comprehensive instruction sheet, complete with tips on flying your Valkyrie craft. There are many skill levels â€” including a night flying instruments only sequence which is fairly difficult.

Your job is to lift the curse on the village. Simple, eh? No, not really! In true Ultimate style the solution to the cursed village is left entirely up to the player.

They've created an entertaining and enthralling game which will have you super-glued to your joystick for hours! Blackwyche is the second Ultimate game for the 64 and is a distinct improvement on Entombed. It stars good old ace explorer Arthur Pendragon the Indiana Jones of the computer gaming world. This time he's in big trouble aboard a haunted pirate ship. Old Arthur couldn't keep his curiosity under control when a mysteriously deserted phantom galleon came up at him out of the mist. Unlike other normal people, who would just run away. Arthur has to climb aboard and nose around. That's how he finds the captain's log. And there's not a stardate in sight! The log tells of a doomed expedition. The captain, one Richard Cavendish, spent days searching underground caverns on a mysterious island which had, as its best feature, a mountain in the shape of a skull. The skipper and his men were looking for the lost Crystal Skull of Souls. They found it and brought it back on board their ship the Blackwyche. The last words the captain wrote were in rhyme and told of the dreadful fate which befell him. His soul was taken by the dark, evil forces of the skull. Arthur sets out to free the captain's lost soul and that's where you come in. You find yourself on the deck of the Blackwyche graphically quite similar to the original Entombed game. You soon discover that you're not quite alone on the ship as nasty green and white Harpies start attacking draining your energy. You must immediately make a dash to your left, rush through the first door you come to and grab the captain's sword which will help you fight these horrible creatures. But the room is already inhabited by skeletons well you can't have it too easy, can you? These skeletons attack as soon as you enter -so be prepared to make a run for it. Blackwyche is miles better than Entombed the graphics for the Arthur character could be slightly better but that's a minor quibble. If you liked Entombed you're going to go ape over Blackwyche. Just like we did at FVG Graphics Sound Value Playability 1. Always try to find a collonade. It will help you work out where you are 2.

Go to the Celtic cross and go to the cave opposite where you will find a spade, take it to the cross and count ten paces north, drop the spade and the hammer will appear. When you have all four parts in the starting room, drop them in a heap on the floor and drop Calum's Hammer next to them. A message will appear signifying the end of the game.

Antipodean Andy: Keep hitting him with the right head blow until you get the chance to block him and he goes down easily. Duck when he gives you the double hand punch. Peter Perfect: Keep hitting him with your left until his stamina runs out. This is the only way to win. If your K.O. flashes he always dodges your punches. HELP!

To get Nuada's sword you need the feather from the storm cave at Storm Base. Then get some bones from a cave in the plain of Lies. These will admit you into King Dhomnuil's room in Dun Dhomnuil. You have to get the honeycomb from this room to allow you to get in to Badrig's Shrine in Badhelm. Once in the shrine drop the feather at the block with a feather drawn on it and an oak leaf will appear. Drop the oak leaf in King Dhomniol's room and he will give you Nuada's sword. To get Dagda's Cauldron, get the book from the water cave at Glasmarsh and take it to the ice cave at Tir Clacham and you will gain entrance to the cave. There you will find ice and a half-torc. Take both. Then find a spade and take it to a place between two brick buildings in Lon Liath. Drop the spade and the and the other half-torc will appear. Put the torc together. When you wear it, it will make you invisible. Then find the daisy which enables you to get out of the back door of Caerdach Calum. Got to the front door of Caerdach Colum. Enter and find Nathair the dragon. Walk back until he is out of sight, then put on the torc. Walk back up to Nathair. If his eyes are still open do not attempt to pass him. Repeat this process until his eyes are closed. You will then be able to pass and get the cauldron and escape. To get the Stone of Fal you will need the ice. Take it to a door marked * in the slige warrens and go through the door, pick up the sting and take to a door marked \"C\" in Tir Clachan. Go through the door and you will be in An Lin the net. There find an axe called Halberd and take it to the little peak and drop it. The stone of Fal will appear. To leave An Lin look for the door PROFANATION Tony Milburn completed this game after 5 days of play. Was that continuous, Tony? Tony says try jumping over the rain drops instead of walking under them. On Screen 10 make sure you notice something about the Diamond you need it if you want to get further in the game. On Screen 28, to jump the small volcano, position yourself towards the end of the small ditch in the floor before the FRANK BRUNO'S BOXING Shaun William of Merseyside is going to show us how to finish off the rest of those prizefighters. Trible Trouble: To beat him you must be fast. As in the first fight, you must quickly hit him in the stomach and then quickly in the face. If you do this successfully he won't last long. Frenchie: Fighting Frenchie takes a lot of time and often ends in a draw. So, to beat him, you must get your K.O. going and then it is easy. To do this you must wait until he drops his guard then hit him a few times. Repeat this procedure. You must duck when he does his windmill punch. Ravioli Mafiosi: He may prove to be the hardest boxer to defeat. He has a habit of dropping his right arm, so you must keep blocking his punches until this happens. Then go in Not bad kalliber, not bad..... but, can the Bug Hunters keep this standard up each month? But don't forget that the Bughunters need your hints. Now for some game playing tips.

This takes practice to perfect. Sometimes the blue squares you touch are not activated. To activate them you must touch other blocks first. FOURTH PROTOCOL Although C64 owner Alex Prior of Doncaster has only got 35% on the first part of the game, what he has found out so far might be of help to other novices. Firstly, unless you check the security at Building 17. you will be told off and your prestige will decrease. The trick is to close off the basement, computer rooms, data rooms, security door, both offices, main entrances, photocopy room, key desk and the tea room. A clue. Check the \"Nato Docs file and transfer all the files that are named in the Nato Docs' file. These files are available from Blenheim. The number is listed under \"telephone in your filing system. When Johnston is suspected, follow him with 25 men, and then wait and see. By doing this you will gain at least 22% in prestige. Follow Abbs and her companion with 25 watchers each. When asked for a course of action, select \"Other suggestion! Then type the word 'DEFECT: The computer will then ask WHO: Next type in Ms Abb's companion's name. When the memo about the list of houses arrives, put 25 men to watch the subject, then to watch his wife's lodger. When the memo about burying a package arrives ring the number at once. Then dig it up, and hand it over to Special Branch. Follow Bracton with 25 men â€” NOT Thorn. You can check this by asking for their files from Blenheim. After a while you may discover something interesting about Bracton. If you do, phone Hot off the presses comes these tips for Ultimate's Nightshade from Jeremy Youngman of Norfolk. Take a look at the table and you will see four antibodies along the top and four highlevel monsters down the left hand side. Unlike low-level monsters acid pools, germs etc the high-level monsters cannot always be killed with a single antibody When hit by an antibody a high level monster may turn into a low level moster, turn into a different high level monster or multiply into two monsters of the same type. If you shoot one of the pair again it will die. On the table an arrow () indicates the new monster formed, and a x2 indicates the monster doubling. There are never more than four antibodies waiting to be collected in a room. Whilst normal high and low level monsters progress your plague by one colour, a guardian monster (one of the four to be killed) will totally consume an elife. Jeremy reckons that sectors of the map are totally devoted to one type of high level monster. Always be prepared and carry a large quantity of the correct antibody. If you come across a potion you may as well collect a set of antibodies nearby Always put your guardian killers at the bottom of the weapon stack â€” even if you have to clear it of antibodies. That way you carry maximum antibodies without having to fire your gaurdiankillers which do not kill normal monsters. ELITE Richard Shaw of Sutton Coldfield has sent some clues for the Beeb version of Elite. As the controls can be difficult for a beginner it is best to decide whether to use the keyboard or joystick Richard's advice is to go for a self-centring joystick as using the keys can make the Cobra do some funny things. Spend as much time flying around practicing using missiles on asteroids. Tactics: Computers, furs and narcotics are the best items to trade with. Gold and platinum can also be used. DO NOT carry 35 tone of narcotics as this will rouse the vipers. Only take a few tons along with other cargo and the Vipers will only come to look. Once you have gained enough credits, the first thing to buy is a docking computer. Keep trading between an agricultural and an industrial planets for as long as you can but watch which governments you trade with If attacked by three or more ships in a bunch, knock one out with a missile, while at long range and follow one of the rest. This means one less attacking you and you are not a sitting target. When a ship is seen on your scanner, face it and manoeuvre it into the centre of your targeting cross. Target a missile. When it locks on your lasers will be in range and ready to use on that ship. Don't attack ships in the safety area as this will bring the Vipers out and your docking computers won't work. Try ramming ships instead. When Thargoids attack, try to detroy the mothership first. This will disarm the fighters and you can scoop them up as alien times. Don't use the fuel scoops to pick up cargo cannisters if your cargo hold is full, or else they will explode and destroy your shields. Alien items can be picked up as an exception to this rule. When trying to cool down your lasers, hyperspacing or approaching the planet, look through one of the side views as this will speed the process up. Richard has also found a bug in the game when you are galactic hyperspacing on the countdown press docking computers, this will take you back to the same space station but in the next galaxy. This is useful because most galactic hyperspaces will land you on an Anarchy planet in the next galaxy FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD To start with if you pick the flok jacket and go to the ZTT room and use it, you will be immune from the bullets that come from the wall. Then press the yellow button for the puzzle. When it shows you six buttons move the cursor onto them in this order: top right, top left, bottom middle, bottom right, bottom left and top middle, pressing fire each time. The wedding ring can be used in the War and the Cybernetic breakout rooms to save you from pain. The security card can be used in the terminal room with disks to activate the computers which will give you access to games. When the murder has been committed, if you go back into the room with the body in, a window will appear. Do not waste anything as the difficulty of finishing the game will be greater. On the Talking Heads screen, shoot the hole at the very top of the screen, Lure him down to the middle of the screen and get him interested in your barricade. Now move to the top of the screen and open fire on him continuously until his bullets reach you. Then repeat the process. -BOC NASTY kills +4x2  5 kills  11 X 2 x 216kills 2  31 216 kills "

"15+ ARCA LAYER 1 BUBBLES A game based on the kitchen sink is a pretty weird setting. but Williams has seen fit to base their new game Bubbles in just such a location. The idea is to rush round the sink swallowing up such tasty morsels as ants, crumbs and other floating garbage. All highly palatable to your average bubble ! As you whiz round it feels like controlling someone on an ice skating rink the bubble gets larger and larger until it eventually grows a face and starts to smile. At that stage it means business and nothing is safe from its predotory jaws. The life of a bubble is a temporary one. After all, razor blades don't do them much good and neither do sponges One burst and the other absorbs, and that's the end of you if you happen to touch one of those lurking nasties. On the other hand, you do have some protection. On every level a broom appears which must be swallowed instantly. That gives protection against sponges and roaches which look like huge hairy spiders crowling out of the plug hole. It's curtains for your bubble if you skid too near a plug hole unless the centre is flashing green. I'm not sure what happens then as I kept running into razor blades and was getting rather bored anyway. Once the greasies have been cleared away the tap is turned on and you are washed into another level over again. Bubbles is neither addictive nor colourful each screen is shaded in blue, the colour of water I suppose. Williams must have been desperate to have concocted such a silly game. Once again CLARE EDGELEY, IDEAS CORP's arcade spy has been venturing out into the game booths to bring you news of the hottest and naffest arcade games around. Here she reports on two wo your hard earned coinage ... stumble or hang around too long. Perching on top of the tombstones doesn't help either as you can only kill them on level ground. A lance thrown in this position will fly over their heads. Let those ghastly creatures touch you once and you are unclothed and flicker a bit to show your weakened state. If touched again, you turn instantly into a skeleton and collapse into a pile of musty old bones. And then what will become of the beautiful maiden? Bonus points are scored for runing over objects and the game has a continuous play facility which enable you to loin cloth the next you're insert more money and equipped for war. continue from your last And then comes the spooky position. That's a nice touch as bit. The walk through the there is nothing as frustrating graveyard. The undead rise as having to start from the from the ground and like beginning each time you die. A chase through a graveyard in every good horror movie, start Ghosts n Goblins is fast and the dead of night isn't closing in on you with blood intriguing. Well worth playing if everyones cup of tea, but there shot eyes, fang like teeth and only to see what other horrors are some who like being arms outstretched. You can stop lie in store.

"DE ACTION PAC RAT The huge success of Roland Rot must have set the Atari boys thinking. Peter Pac Rat is their answer to Roland a cute little creature who is a kleptomaniac. The way he goes about it makes a magpie look like an amateur. The game starts off above ground with Peter in his tree house. The screen is the platform and ladders type with three shiny objects scattered throughout. The hazards in the game are the animals which range from a bulldog and dragonfly in the first screen to crocodiles, bats, snakes, cats ws. And they all do their Pat's activities. the animals and so inake off with the goodies as he jumps around each screen. When stunned, some can be used to carry him round for a short period. The flying creatures are used for this purpose as they can get him to the top of a screen far quicker than he could climb. Each level takes place in a different location. The second screen finds Peter underground in a larger screen with more levels land objects. Bats and large rats must be avoided as he scurries up and down ladders. The bats are especially important as the time limit is tight, and towards the end of the game you should stun o bat and use it to carry Peter to the top of the screen to collect the last few objects. Once the objects are back at the start he can go on the next collecting trip. That takes place in a tree where much the same thing happens. And then its back to the start where the first screen has been combined with the second to create a large and varied playing area, with few added extras like a large spider's web. Each level is larger than its predeecessor, has more objects and is much harder to complete in the specified time limit. Movement is smooth and the game presents a real challenge. The music is fast and there are several different jingles in fact they all sound very much like the type of music found in American Sit-coms. Play it if you can find one near you O WELCOME A MACHINE! Watch out for next month's great arcade double competition. We're not giving too much away except for a real live arcade machine and a genuine pintable. That's all! If you've got space at home for a mega-prize then pick up a copy of December's special C+VG. You could end up with a real Christmas bonus! BARADUKE BaroDuke from Namco is one of those classic arcade shoot em-ups which don't have a story line, not much in the way of graphics, but there's plenty of blasting material, The screen is dull, mostly blues. blacks, browns with the occasional touch of pink, Appropriate when you think thot the whole thing takes place in the bowels of the earth, in some deep underground cavern. The idea seems to be to travel as deep underground as is humanly possible to defeat the monster's boss. Anyway, cavern one Descent in your lunar jet suit to confront the squidgy blue Octy. Octy is really the mother octopus rather like a mother-ship and she crops up on each level, spewing out her dull coloured offspring to attack you. Not very nice at all. They are fairly slow moving and are easy to shoot down, As their numbers grow in each successive cavern, you'll have more trouble coping with them. Add the baby octopuses to lots of lethal bubbles and you get the picture Once you're rid of the octopuses, you can have a bash at their mum, Shoot her a couple of times and she turns into a metallic ball with a yellow square in the middle. Run over that and a Paccet is revealed. Could this be a baby pac.creature? It is in fact a yellow splodge sometimes with a face and ears. Run over the Paccet to pick it up and down the shaft to the next cavern It is possible to earn extra shields by rescuing enough Poccets to win a bonus screen That involves pressing the fire button at the right moment and you will either win a shield, lose a shield or gain nothing Why the game is called BaraDuke is anybody's quess. Perhaps that is the name of the monster's boss. BaraDuke is reasonably fast, mildly addictive, but hasn't got the qualities to take it into the top ten arcade games METRO CROSS Namco has used an old idea that of running from one point to another and has come up with an unusual and playable game. Metro Cross is all about running through a scrolling screen, jumping some objects and kicking others and all within a time limit, Limber up and get ready ther are some sticky patches ahead of you. Your slightly pot bellied character chugs off slowly and then gathers speed, Not for long though. Some oil drums hurtle towards you in formation and must be jumped. Easier said than done. It happens quickly and you are more likely to end up flattened. Pick yourself up and continue, must not waste time as once that's run out you'll be electrified and disappear in a puff of smoke. The area to run through is marked in blue and white tiles and as you charge from left to right be sure to avoid the green patches. These are slippery areas on which your player will quickly slide out of control. It is vital to move him off as quickly as possible and the best way is to jump him into the air and move him across in mid-leap. To make life harder, oil drums aren't the only hazards. A continuous stream of objects lie or move into your path and it is in your best interests to time your jumps os tripping up can only slow your progress. The running area zig zags up ond down and at full pelt it is difficult to slow down in time to change direction. When you reach the finishing posts on each leg. your runner collapses and has to bend over in a struggle to catch his breath. Anyone would think you had made him runa marathon! Metro Cross is fun and strangely addictive for such a simple concept. However, it is often the simple games which do better than the really complex ones TUITE OBJECTS NEEDED 2 TEASER HILIALE "

"Got a problem? Feel in need of a bit of help and assistance? Then why not write to the Bug Hunters at Computer + Video Games, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London ECIR 3AU. ... DEARE GIORS ow what's the point in having a team of heroic Bug Hunters, if they won't tell you what the bugs are? Oh, they searched out and destroyed all the bugs from the listings in the previous issue, but refused to tell us what they were so that we could pass on the information to you. The reason they gave was 'security, but personally think they're after more money. Obviously some intrepid reporter was going to have to volunteer to infiltrate the group and get the low-down on what went wrong. Guess who drew the short straw? Yes, Rik Link Wearing dull clothes, dark glasses and a dirty raincoat, I tried to appear inconspicuous as I crept into the Bug Hunter Recreation Room (out of bounds to all organic life forms) and crouched down behind a sofa, just inside the door. Peering over the top of the thick cushion backs, got my first glimpse of the extravagantly furnished room, complete with drinks machine, oil bath and a whole host of microcomputers. Big Red was just relaxing into the bath, whilst in the far corner, B-Con was projecting a film onto a white patch of wall. He and the others were watching some robot (presumably female) removing various outer casings to some electronic music. Suddenly the whole room began to vibrate as Big Red started humming to himself. A chorus of shouts immediately erupted from the far corner. \"Can it, you mechanised moron!\" screeched OTISS, straining to make himself heard above the reverberations. \"Can't you see we're trying to watch a movie here?\" \"But I always sing in the bath. I've been told ! have a very nice singing voice,\" protested Big Red. A floodlight swept past me as B-Con turned round, all interest in the film lost. \"You! A nice singing voice. I've heard better sounding pneumatic drills. I've also heard you singing bass with that Commodore 64 of yours. Terrible.\" \"Well, it's got better sound than that Spectrum you keep fiddling with, and I didn't think much to the music in that Rockfall game that was published in the Book of Games,\" roared Big Red. \"That's okay\" said BCon, cheerfully. \"I had a call recently from Sean Swift in Shipley, who's improved the tune data. Have a look at this.\" B-Con swung around to project a program line on the far wall. They all hummed quietly to themselves for a moment as they checked out the new tune against the original. OTISS was the first to finish. \"Well, I suppose it's all right if you like that sort of thing, but ! think I'll stick to my BBC and Atari any day of the week. Anyway, why didn't you tell that bunch from the magazine about this new line of yours. It's not like you not to try and show off in that petty little way of yours.\" \"I didn't tell them because you refused to let them in.\" \"You can't blame me just because the Incredible Lump was sitting in front of the door,\" said OTISS. Meanwhile, Big Red had been splashing oil over all and sundry in a desperate effort to scrub his back. \"I was only sitting in front of the continued on page 86 "


"DEARUH symbol, looking remarkably like an upsidedown, back-to-front question mark, should really be the right-hand square bracket (1). \"Now, the symbol in the middle, which looks very much like a capital 'N is the backslash key you'll find this just below the square bracket keys on the keyboard.\" \"Who cares where you find it on the keyboard?\" shouted OTISS. \"Look, is this going to go on much longer?\" \"You did ask him.\" chimed in Big Red, cleaning his feet with a bit of wire wool he'd found lying about. \"Yes, shut-up and listen!\" agreed B-Con. \"These three symbols crop up yet again in lines 860, 865 and 870,\" continued X. \"More importantly, you'll find that funny looking 'N' in lines 890, 1290 and twice in each of lines 1275 and 1525. There may be more, but I can't find any. \"Lines 1015, 1125, and probably others, contain a symbol like '*. This is the up-arrow key on your keyboard â€” the same key as the pound sign. This isn't a real error, as most printers print the symbol this way. \"Finally, there are a couple more unusual symbols in lines 3020 and 3028. The first of these, which is only just distinguishable as two dots at the top of the character space, should be the left hand curly bracket. You get this using SHIFT+'t Lastly the character looking like two vertical lines with a squiggle at the top should be the vertical bar line. This is obtained with SHIFT+'@ \"By the way, I'm not sure if I should mention this, but is anybody going to do anything about that guy hiding behind the sofa.\" \"WHAT!\" Four pairs of eyes and a rather bright light turned my way... door because you told me to. You said it was a matter of security. And then, when I asked what we were keeping secure, you told me to stop trying to change the subject. Then I said I wasn't, and you told me that I'm extremely stupid at times. Then I...\" \"Okay, okay!,\" said OTISS. \"You do go on at times. Anyway, if we refuse to speak to them, maybe they'll change that drinks machine over there. What do they think we are? Fancy putting coffee, tea and chicken soup into it. Urgh! What's more, none of us had anything to say in any case.\" \"I did.\" OTISS turned and glared at the previously silent X. \"Don't tell me you've been having more trouble with that Amstrad of yours. Not that I'd be a bit surprised,\" sneered Otiss. \"Well I did have some trouble with the printing. Unfortunately, the printer produced a number of weird symbols which confused all the Amstrad owners who tried to type it in,\" said OTISS, in a very matter-of-fact manner. \"I know I'm going to regret this, but why don't you tell us all about it. Get it off your chest, so to speak\", said OTISS, in that annoying imperious manner of his. \"Very well then. Most people were able to handle the hash symbols, which appear as a sort of compressed Pt,\" began X. \"However, on reaching line 855 things started to get awkward. There are three very unusual symbols at the end of this particular line the type you wouldn't credit a printer being able to handle. \"The first of these resembles an inverted exclamation mark. Believe it or not, this should be the left-hand square bracket (1). Having said this, it might not seem quite so unusual if I were to tell you that the third Don't forget you can call the Bug Hunters on 01-251 6222, ext 2470 every TUESDAY. They'll be around to deal with your problems. But please remember to call only on a Tuesday otherwise you might just annoy Big Red... "

Both were intent on winning a prize beyond money, a prize which would bring both pride and honour. And so they met in a deadly duel at the fabled fortress of Farringdon, home of Computer + Video Games, to win the title of August Hot Shot of the Month on The Way of the Exploding Fist. The warriors were dynamite Daniel Gilbert, 16, of Heathfield, East Sussex, already with a record 3,064,000 points to his credit, and mighty Matthew Stunt, 15, of Hemel Hempstead, Herts, with a high score of 1,126,700. The atmosphere was electric as the titans met at the computer to battle through five 10 minute bouts each. Would Deadly Dan become Desperate Dan under the pressure? Would mighty Mat have the rug pulled from under him? Only time would tell Daniel was first to the joystick and scored a very respectable 103,100. Matthew, forsaking the joystick to use the keyboard, could only respond with 42,300. Big fight nerves seemed to be affecting Matthew more than Daniel Round two: Daniel, confident and assured, smashed his way to another sizzling score, 108,900. Matthew could only respond with 65,200. Round three: Was Daniel slipping? His score was down to 91,800. But Matthew was unable to take advantage, scoring only 63,700. Round four: Daniel, let off the hook, recovered to knotch up 116,900. Matthew managed just 45,200. Round five: Daniel slumped to a low of just 58,000. But it was too late for Matthew to win even though he took the last round with a fine 75,400, And so Daniel took the title of August Hot Shot of the Month. Both the victor and vanquished received a package of Commodore games and a bag of C+ VG goodies.

"C+VG ADVENTURE MAILBAG another Book of Adventure, we hope to include a double page. By the way, youll soon be in trouble over your treatment of that horse read on... Dear Keith I'm afraid most of this letter will be devoted to grumbles. I won't sign myself \"Disgusted of Poole\" though I am sorely tempted to do so. herlock Id review Dear Keith, Contrapositive! Contrapositive? Produced or characterised by a type of mode of conversion in which from a given proposition we infer another, having the contradictory meaning of the original predicate of the subject. So says my dictionary! Yes, you've probably guessed it I'm currently playing Ghost Town on my Beeb! My hypothesis is therefore that by inverting the proposition of the ghostly voice I WILL collect $200! But it seems that right now I can't do either! Scott Adams' Ghost Town is very, very good indeed, more than living up to your old review which I dug out and re-read before buying it! Playing at 1.30 yesterday morning I finally worked out how to break into the jail and, in a further fit of brilliance, made some gunpowder. The main problem remains shoeing the blasted horse. Armed with gunpowder I've been trying to blow open the safe without success, and being particularly evil, I've also been igniting it under the horse in an attempt to shock him into movement! I am thinking that it would be a very good idea if you included a separate letters page for the Helpline, in view of how many people are writing about adventures in general and not just their problems. Might be useful to give space for people to air their opinions, give praise, suggestions or hurl a few brickbats. What do you think? John English Northfield, Birmingham Keith replies: A few brickbats coming right up! We are planning to have a regular page devoted to readers letters and adventure news from now on. John! Next month, with First grumble: I see you made great play of the fact that 8th Day Software couldn't spell BROOCH. I find spelling errors annoying myself, but why pick on this small firm? My copy of Sherlock (CBM64) not only includes a GRAMAPHONE in one location, but Melbourne House has used this very screen as an illustration on the box as if they were proud of it. I have yet to see a reviewer refuse to review Sherlock! Fair's fair! Cuddles costs .50, Sherlock .95. Nuff said. Second grumble: What is this rubbish I see on page ll of the July issue? I always knew most computer games mags were aimed squarely at silly little boys, but I thought your adventure section was different. Adventures are played by many adults, and many females who, like me, prefer to flex their brains rather than their fingers. The term master adventurer will now have a new significance when used in C+VG. Shame on you for being so sexist! Third Grumble: I must confess I find the C+VG Adventure Club offers very poor value to anyone who isn't thrilled by a tacky plastic badge. The news sheets seem concerned with not very special special offers. Also a couple of hours per week for the Helpline phone-in seems derisory. And any caller has to waste money hanging on to the switchboard. It's OK if you live locally, but not even cheap rate time for members who live further afield. Going back to the July issue. Fourth Grumble: I would not it would seem pretty silly to have brought this up at all for have adults putting themselves fear of seeming ultra-squeamish in the position of Adrian Mole but a friend of mine was so (aged 13 and 4) to test how disgusted he refuses to buy realistic the game is, wouldn't C+VG any more, so I was not it?

Here is adventures as games such as the latest print-out Sabre Wulf, says Kerry. from the top Sean Kenny of Bridlington points out that I was wrong in floor ... stating that Pirate Adventure was available for the Spectrum, and asks when it will be. The version was advertised well over a year ago I spoke to Adventure International recently and they were not sure if the early games in the Scott Adams series would undergo further conversions, they seem to feel that many people now consider them outdated. This is a great pity, for they are still a lot better than many current releases and the logic in the problems is second to none! On a lighter note, Adam writes from Watford with a hitherto undocumented Hobbit bug ... \"I have found a small bug in The Hobbit. At the beginning, if you type: SMASH CHEST, it says: WITH ONE WELL The two ladies who were at the correct location to collect the Pimania were by no means the only people getting soaking wet in their quest for the Golden Sundial on 22nd July. One reader wrote from Telford the day before to say he was heading for Stonehenge. \"I think I've solved it!\" he exclaimed, tieing in the fact that Stonehenge is a giant sundial, with pillars in the shape of giant 'PIs. \"Please keep my name out of it unless I'm right of course.\" John Davidson of Gosport wrote after the event, thoroughly disappointed and soaked to the skin. He had been to the Westbury White Horse, and was not alone. There he met someone from Essex, and heard of a boy and a girl who has also been at the location earlier but had left. \"Noon came and went, nothing happened, and we went our separate ways.\" Disappointing indeed! Another reader who made the annual pilgrimage was Mr Willis of Nottingham. He went to a white horse at Pusey, and was absolutely convinced that he had the right place when he saw it. There was even a white gate he had to enter, shaped as a Pi. He became quite excited when he saw the site, as everything seemed to fit. Well, almost...! The last word on Pimania from our famous original loony Pimaniac, John Yeates. John lives in Jersey, you will remember, and he received the news during one of his more serious moments. \"Those who knew of the existence of the Hindover Hill horse would have had a head start,\" he said, \"but it would have been unheard of by non-English players.\" I suspect that the horse in question is unknown by most English players as well. But would knowledge of it have given anyone a head start? HELLO SAILOR!

"C+VG ADVENTURE REVIEWS/1 The Rats is a game based on the book by James Herbert, in which giant killer rats threaten London. The book isn't supplied with the game. And although the background of the story might make the game more enjoyable, having read it beforehand I can assure you that it is not essential. Play alternates between strategy sessions and adventure \"interludes\", the objective is to organise your strategy in such a way that the Research and Development establishment comes up with superweapons capable of destroying the rat population In the adventure episodes you take the part of various characters in the story, The greater area of the screen comprises a text window, to the left of which is a vertical column. Below these runs a strip offering a choice of COMMAND, INVENTORY, or REDESCRIBE.. The mini adventure starts off by telling you where you are and what objects can be seen. By moving a highlighting cursor you can select one of the three options. The most frequently used option, of course, is COMMAND, which causes a list of verbs to be displayed in the column to the left of the text window. Only verbs which can currently be used appear in the list. Next the cursor must be moved over the verb required and selected by pressing the fire button. Options for the next command word will be displayed following this. In other words, the game is controlled by text icons, either through the keyboard or joystick. Thus a command sentence is built up by selecting a combination from the London area, for once they get required, as the computer is left lists. out into the country at large the locked solid and has to be To a certain extent you are game is lost. turned off before it is any further playing blind.

During play, parts of the text window are overlaid with graphics, to the accompaniment of sound. These depict attacks by the rats, and their horror-stricken victims. Even successful strategies in the adventures can lead to failure as there is a random element built in, and sometimes the rats are just too powerful, whatever action the player takes. Between the adventures come the 'real' strategy parts of the game, during which the player can allocate his research resources to different aspects dealing with the menace, and as more information becomes available, deploy and equip his forces to defend the population and eventually annihilate the deadly creatures The strategy must be directed at containing the rats in the next call is the house by the park.

"REVIEWS/3 ROBIN OF SHERWOOD As the Outlaw of Sherwood Forest your task is to find the six touchstones of Rhiannon and return them to the stone circle they should be in. No problem, as long as you stay alive and that's not easy as practically every location which isn't a tree is booby trapped. This graphic adventure moves satisfyingly quickly from one death to the next in my case only slowing up in the forest. It's crucial to map the forest as one big vegetable looks very much like another; it is possible to bash into the edge of the forest repeatedly before it finally twigging that you have been in the same place for the last ten You are in the Great Hain. You see The Sheriff of Nottingham. Door. EXITS: UP WHATSHILLIT DO NOH ? GO LEFT The Sheriff Cal 15 the guards, far too many soldiers, you are soidiens guards. There Sherwood is over. key presses, and that the forest can only be left through proper exits. Once a way has been found to an interesting location, save the game. The chances are that sudden death will follow a wrong decision and send you back to the beginning of the game an exceedingly boring dungeon from which there is only one escape routine. The other locations are more interesting, castles, courtyards and caves with objects to find and hidden places to explore. The adventure includes short re-runs of Robin's most famous legends including the treacherous archery contest set up by the Sheriff of Nottingham to trap him and the fight with Little John. Unfortunately, neither of these events seem as romantic or exciting as the stories. Maybe that's to do with trying to fit complicated scenes into a few words and a small illustration. The programmers, Mike Woodroffe and Brian Howarth, have gone to some length with subtle detail where they can. The waterfall is animated (try going under it for a surprise) TIME SEARCH and Siward the Thief is so light fingered that he steals not only from the Sheriff, but also from you. It's a fair bet that you won't realise how much he's taken until you try to bribe someone and find your slush fund is all gone. There's a free hint sheet available. It's a good idea to get it and to read the instruction sheet carefully as the game is very particular about input. Remember to talk to every character in the game. Of course, stopping to talk to a bunch of furious guards is a good way to get killed, but with everyone else it's worth a try. Not that all of them say anything very interesting, especially the downright boring Herne the Hunter, who looks impressive with his stag's head and robes, but never says much more than repeating his prophesy about the return of the stones. Cheeky maid Marion is more fun! Robin of Sherwood is a competent and clean adventure game. Denise Shemuel  Personal Rating: 8 BOOKS After playing Time Search for a short while, I became thoroughly bored and amazed that games like this are actually produced. It is a text adventure with an inane line in replies. The objective should you care to know is to find a time machine. Starting off outside your own front door, after a lengthy and clumsy loading routine that demands a reload of data should you need to restart, GO IN elicits the reply THAT MAKES NO SENSE. Open front door WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? In the pub you can get a tankard of beer but you must drink the tankard because the program cannot see the beer. GULP! CRUNCH! Up the road, you find one of those long obsolete outdoor cigarette machines and, should you be sharp enough to think of inserting a coin, the machine magically swings away to reveal a hidden exit. The adventure map is a nightmare, with logical exits blocked for no apparent reason. For example, it seems you can move around inside the pub only in a certain direction, and you can't seem to go back and forth from one bar to another. Personally I found Time Search so poor that to describe it as mediocre would be to overrate it. It failed to hold my interest at all. Keith Campbell  Personal Rating: 2 Price. WRITING the program.

The program typed into data statements within only knows that it doesn't understand the word here, and not whether it might understand it elsewhere. The YOU CAN'T DO THAT reply is one that adventurers tend to find very frustrating and unhelpful. For speed, I would have preferred to have seen a machine code subroutine (entered in Basic) scanning the whole vocab and giving a more intelligent reply. This is a very well planned and written professional approach to adventure game programming. It introduces such concepts as linked lists and text compression, so a potential reader will need to be computer literate. A good knowledge of Basic is essential and familiarity with other aspects of computers and computing, such as knowledge of binary arithmetic. If you are interested in writing an adventure game on your Amstrad then you will enjoy this book and probably learn a great deal from it. Keith Campbell "

There are a lot of ANTAGONISTS COMPETITION, TAKE A TRIP TO ENTHAR SEVEN! COMPETITION Some games are good and others are well ... just \"others\". Antagonists falls firmly into the camp of \"others\". I was amazed to find that this game had no loader, so when the header program loaded I had to type RUN to get it started! Programming like this always gives me a feeling of unease! Once running, text scrolls up the screen. A few words describe the location and a line is devoted to the exits. The location descriptions lack any sense of atmosphere and, as far as I can tell, the game does not contain any prose likely to inspire the imagination of the player. For example, the sort of conversation you have with the computer goes something like: \"You're in a room. Exits North, South, East, West. You see a gold bar.\" EXAMINE GOLD BAR \"It isn't here.\" Although pages of text do not automatically make good adventure, I do feel an effort is needed in the direction of improving the contents of the text in many games, especially this one. I did not play very far into the game, so I feel that it would be unfair for me to comment any further. I will not give a personal rating because I have not completed enough of the game I was just too bored to continue!

Only you can help. At first he only has to jump rocks and holes. Then he must jump and duck almost simultaneously, to avoid the logs and low hanging tree limbs in the Petrified Forest. The only way Thor can get across the river is to hop on the turtles' backs. These turtles sometimes get tired and submerge at the wrong moment, much to Thor's dismay. To add to Thor's difficulties, his arch-enemy Fat Broad is waiting on the other side to ambush him. If Thor's timing is good, the Dooky Bird will help him over the lava pit. If he jumps the pit just when Dooky Bird is overhead, the prehistoric bird will pick him up and carry him across! Thor must build up plenty of speed during his downhill run before the cliff. Timing is crucial, too. If Thor's balance is off or he is too slow he will crash into the ravine or the face of the cliff. Once over the cliff, Thor faces his most difficult challenge: the volcanic eruption. In addition to the obstacles on the ground, he is showered with boulders from the sky. Once again Thor must cross the river on the turtles' backs. Then, at last, he must face the dinosaur! If Thor can get past the dinosaur and into the cave, he has only a short way to go to rescue Cute Chick. On his way Thor must duck under stalagtites and jump over stalagmites to avoid crashing. If Thor does crash, don't worry: he has five wheels.

"VIDEO-TECH/1 Computers can do wonderful things we all know that. But sometimes they do it so well that you don't realise that they were involved in the first place. Here we look at what you can do when you mix computers with video. First up are the amazing computer generated graphics featured in the latest Dire Straits video. Then Marshal M. Rosenthal, our U.S. correspondent, tells us how computers are putting the colour back into Laurel and Hardy's cheeks! ROCK BAND'S VIDEO MAGIC! Have you seen the latest Dire Straits video? Did you know that it features some of the most advanced computer graphics ever seen on the small screen or the big one for that matter? Want to know how it was done? C+VG editor TIM METCALFE investigates. nce upon a time the world's best known rock band, Dire Straits, were working on ideas for a video promo for their latest single Money for Nothing The song is all about someone watching pop stars on video and complaining how they don't really have to work for a living. Pop promo producer Steve Barron looked at the lyrics of the song and said: \"Why not make the person complaining about the videos a video-creation himself?\" And so an idea was born. But how to put it into action? That's where the people at Rushes, a video production company in Old Compton Street, London, came in. Steve knew that Rushes had a wonder-computer called the Bosh FGS 4000 which could produce some amazing computer graphics. But could it do the job for Dire Straits? The man who drives the Bosh is Ian Pearson. \"I said I didn't know. It had never been done before. Once Steve knew that he really wanted to do it!\" The Bosh FGS 4000 is a German machine made under licence in Salt Lake City U.S.A. It's dedicated to producing stunning computer graphics, but â€” until the Straits video came along had only been used for adverts doing weird and wonderful things for adverts and TV company logos. The joy of using this machine is that all the graphic capabilities are built into the hardware â€” you don't need to keep loading information into the machine. Unless you're doing something really complicated like the Dire Straits animation! For the most part the Bosh is menu driven. Ian simply calls up the various commands/controls he wants at a given time and the computer executes them. The graphics can be treated in one of two ways. Either using the \"mouse\" like digitiser which is moved painstakingly over a one dimensional drawing or using a graphics programming language called ROL. Read Only Language is a kind of special code which helps lan get the Bosh to produce complicated graphics. \"It's sort of a mass of x/y co-ordinates,\" he says. Ian and Gavin Blair used ROL to create the three minutes of animation included in the Money for Nothing video. It took Ian and Gavin about four weeks including several 24 hour stints to complete the sequence. Before Ian even sat down at the Bosh, a lot of planning had to be done. \"Steve and I sat down and thrashed out what he wanted â€” literally putting ideas down on the back of cigarette packets!\" Steve acquired the services of illustrator Micky Finn who designed the characters of Sal and Harve. "


"animation and fitting the live action in with the computer generated graphics. The great thing about computer graphics is that once you've set up the basic \"picture\" you can play around with it. View it from any angle from the back or the front, top or bottom. Even turn it inside out if you want! And, unlike live action, you don't have to move cameras around in between shots. And you get perfect continuity at all times. Once Adam had done his bit Ian and Gavin set about animating the sequence, two frames at a time. Meanwhile the live bits of Dire Straits were getting the Quantel Paintbox treatment in the room behind the Bosh. Vivian Scott was the person who put those nice flourescent colours on Mark Knopfler's guitar! Then Dave Yardley, ace pop promo video editor, went to work and stuck the whole lot together producing a simply stunning finished product as seen on Top of the Pops, Max Headroom and other rock music shows. So that's how the world's first computer generated pop video came to be. Will there be more? Well, right now lan isn't working on one and they are extremely expensive to produce SO only the few top bands will be able to afford to do it. Computer generated graphics and special effects will still be seen in blockbuster movies and more mundane TV adverts however. And the things the computer will be able to create will be getting more sophisticated too. Ian told us that in Japan graphics experts have created realistic looking \"skin\" which stretches and moves just like the real thing! The Japanese have also created a stunning animated Chrome Tiger which looks so real you think it's going to take a bite out of you! The only trouble is that this technique takes an age to produce a finished graphic. It took 18 hours per frame to complete the tiger which means you get a second of film every 30 days! Ian's current favourite piece of computer generated animation comes in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan movie. It's the sequence where the Genesis Bomb explodes on a asteroid transforming it from a dead planet to one teeming with new life. Will the computer eventually take over from the normal methods of film and cartoon animation? Ian thinks not but he does says that the time it takes to generate computer graphics will get less as the hardware improves. \"The computer is just another production tool,\" he says, \"It won't take over completely.\" But what about the future? What wonders has the computer got in store? \"So far we've stuck pretty much to reality,\" says Ian, \"If we move away there's no end of things that could be done.\" If you want to see some of the things Ian has created on the Bosch just look out for the new Reporting London logo on Thames TV, or the S4C logo in Wales or the Yorkshire TV logo. He also did the Wembley FA Cup Final title sequence if you can remember that far back! If you are interested in computer graphics there's a big show being held at the Wembley Conference Centre in London from October 16-18th. Harve's the fat one who does all the moaning! Micky also worked on a storyboard for the video while Ian designed things like lampshades and the factory backgrounds to slot into the finished animated product at a later date. Things like the lampshade can be stored away on hard disc to be used later. Ian has a library of hundreds of items which could be used in other graphic works of art. \"But we don't really use them. People don't really want to use something that's already been seen.\" Meanwhile back at the video lan was having problems visualising Harve's face and so a model had to be made which now occupies pride of place on the top of the Bosh's control panel. \"I just couldn't get a good idea from the drawings,\" said lan, \"So I needed the model just to give me a better idea.\" Once the characters and the backgrounds had been worked out, director Adam Whittaker began his side of the operation.

"VIDEO-TECH/2 ANOTHER FINE MESS Laurel and Hardy have delighted thousands of cinema and television audiences over the years with their slap-stick antics. Now, thanks to a new American process, Vidcolor, new life can be breathed into these comic classics. Stunning colour brings a startling new aspect to many black and white movies. Marshal M. Rosenthal donned his bowler hat and went out to discover how to paint the past. There's an old argument among shows, the most recent being a movie buffs on black and white remake of The Alfred Hitchcock versus colour. A lot of them feel Hour. The master director's that black and white typifies a introductions were changed into timelessness, a feeling of depth colour from their previous black and space which colour can't and white incarnation.

"COMPUTER + VIDEO GAMES 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE LONDON, EC1R 3AU interesting to hear from other readers on this how many of you agree with Roddy's view? reviews for all kinds of computers. All sorts of extras like film reviews etc, etc, etc. And if you are an Adventure fan, you could almost buy the mag just for the Adventure part. Then there are the ads, they tell you what kind of products are available and they keep the price of the mag low. Why do you complain about a magazine that has so much to offer? We in Holland, Germany and several other countries in Europe have to pay twice as much as you do you hear us complain? Darius Heydarpour, Holland increasingly boring. I find it really frustrating to own a game with 50 stages knowing that I will never see more than a dozen of them. I am even not certain that the cheat tricks in some games are really found by users or are given to them by the programmers themselves, especially the tricks that were obviously incorporated in the game to ease its design. I don't think that adventure games and their sales suffer from the issuing of clue sheets, such as Level 9's, as I doubt that Adventures such as Snowball and Retum to Edent can be solved without any help. So, please give us more Pokes  After being hacked to pieces by the evil forces of Doomdark, from the fantastic game Lords of Midnight, I decided to settle down with a cup of tea and my copy of C+VG. I flicked through until I came to Mailbag. A chance to have a good laugh I thought. No such luck! 99% of the letters were from people complaining about features in the magazine. I mean, a little creative criticism here and there is OK but last issue was going a bit far. . There is a wide spectrum (forgive the pun) of home computers each with its own particular strengths and weaknesses, yet Spectrum owners seem to make fun of every computer on the face of the earth, bar of course the Spectrum. Certain mags (not this one) don't help matters, for example a Commodore mag comments that the Spectrum is a simple calculator not a computer, then a Sinclair mag comments on the C64 being a simple calculator. Now be honest, which of these two computers resembles a calculator more than a computer? You're probably now thinking that I am a biased Commodore owner, well you're wrong. Okay, I did once own a C64 and a Vic 20 and a Dragon 32 and a ZX81. Now I own an Amstrad 664. Each of the above computers does have its strong and weak spots. Take for example that old (virtually extinct) favourite the ZX81. You can't moan about pathetic inaudible sound (Spectrum) as it has none. How often have you bought a game and on the box it states \"superb, unbelievable hi-res graphics\", on a ZX81 you wouldn't have to worry about comments like that as it has no hi-res graphics! Spectrum owners are really a modern example of this. All you anti-Spectrumers, do you agree with these comments about a typical Spectrum game? Flickery graphics, merging colours, single coloured graphics, music let's face it, my dead gerbil God rest his soul makes better music than a Spectrum. So, all you readers who don't own Spectrums let's unite and fight this continual wave of evilness, the Spectrum. I have included my address but, please don't print it as I don't like letter bombs. That's how my gerbil died! Mark Hula Bristol  I haven't written to a magazine before, but in this case I felt strongly enough to do so. I have read the letters in C+VG for some time now and I have found that a large proportion of them have said something about how good or bad a certain micro is, or how little it's mentioned If everyone would stop being biased and realise that every computer has something going for it, the Mailbag page would be a brighter place. Apart from this minor gripe, which isn't your fault anyway, I find your magazine is excellent. I can't imagine it being any better than it is, but, when it is it will be superb! Nic Herring Cleveland Editor's reply: If we get any more letters like this, my head will soon be as big as Big Red's! houses to include skill levels or demo routines in their games, allowing the customer to satisfy his curiosity and see what the 255th screen looks like. Patrick Montier France. Editor's reply: OK Patrick, we'll make your wish come true. From now on Melissa and the Bug Hunters will be bringing you MORE hints, tips and cheat modes for your favourite games. Three pages this issue! So, I thought I would write to creep, err sorry, cheer you up. Well here goes. Arcade Action is amazingly amazing (even in black and white). The reviews are fantastic The listings are fun to type in and play. The Hot Gossip and the games news really keep you in touch with the computer world. The competitions are generous and the Mailbag, well what more can I say. Now that I have crept, crawled and got deep down in the slime can I have a t-shirt? Please... pretty please. Greg Schofield, Cheshire. Editor's reply: Sheeesh Greg! You're making us blush. The lengths some people will go to get a C+VG I-shirt eh? But since you've messed up your good clothes grovelling about in the slime we can't refuse you can we? . I have just subscribed to your excellent magazine and I noticed in the September issue a letter from Keith Blomerly, who feels that Professor Video does not give pokes for infinite lives for arcade games. In your answer, you argue that software houses don't like such information to be issued as they prefer customers to spend more time on one game. My opinion is that there is a real need for easier ways to perform a game as many of them are really too hard and fast and can only be achieved by players with very great skill I believe that many games would need several skill levels, or at least to restart the game at the latest stage reached, so as to avoid doing again and again the first stages, which becomes  As you are bringing about a new look C+VG, I thought that I would drop you a tip. So many people have recently written in complaining about the amount of advertisements that you publish. I don't really mind them as they keep me informed of new and exciting games, and keep both you and the companies themselves in business. They also make great posters, But, one of the main problems is that they get in the way of features and reviews. A good idea would be to keep the adverts separate. That way they could be read at leisure. Does your ad, manager, Louise Matthews, agree? Roddy Havaression, Middlesex Editor's reply: Thanks for your interest Roddy, but I think you'll find that our advertisers reckon that having their ads dotted around among our features, news and reviews makes people like you take more notice of them and therefore fulfill their prime function, making our readers take an interest in the products. But it would be  Many moons ago there was a young Dungeons and Dragons fanatic who bought a ZX Spectrum, thinking he may be able to play computerized D&D. Years have passed since that time and his hopes for finding a true D&D style adventure on the computer had almost vanished, Suddenly, his seemingly helpless quest was completed when he bought Mastertronics Joumey's End which contains many of the features of D&D adventures including hiring a party of men, finding treasure, gambling, using spells, graphical battles, hunting for food, magic items, gaining experience, traps, puzzles etc, etc The amazing thing is that the price of his discovery was a mere .99 and that for a 3  This, letter is meant for UK readers who are complaining about too many adverts and not enough computer news in your wonderful magazine. You only have to pay 95p and look what you get in return! Every month several competitions with excellent prizes to be won. Colourful CONTINUED OVER PAGE "


"Milling COMPUTER + VIDEO GAMES 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE LONDON, EC1R 3AU program totally graphic adventure. Thank you Mastertronic, it was well worth waiting for. Peter Craig London. Editor's reply: Hey Red! Get over to Mastertronic and ask them why we haven't seen a copy into the C+VG office will you. Like most computer fanatics I enjoy playing games and also reading reviews about them, but where have all the Amstrad reviews gone? The first C+VG I bought was the July issue, wow what a mag. Knight Lore game of the month, and plenty of other Amstrad reviews. (I won't go into detail about the unfair review of the game compared with the Beeb version, because it would take up too much room.) A month later, I decided to buy the August issue. Only two Amstrad reviews and one didn't even have a screen shot. PATHETIC. What is happening??? Now I have just bought the September issue, and there's only one review of a game which is also available on the CBM and Spectrum. Aggggh....I felt like ripping the magazine up! Instead of Amstrad reviews, there're four T199/4a reviews, (Midnite Mason springs to mind, how can a game costing $24.95, receive a factor of 8 for value for money?) and a few MSX (boo, hiss) reviews. Why don't you cut down on Spectrum and CBM reviews? I realise that a high percentage of your readers are CBM and Spectrum owners, but aren't you over doing it a bit?? Apart from the magazine's lack of AMSTRAD reviews, the rest of the mag's O.K. With reference to Mr R. McClenaghan's letter in the September issue he says that the Pontoon program in the book Sensational Games For The Amstrad, doesn't work because the program lacks line 11100 this is true, I advise him to change GOSUB 11100, to GOSUB 11000. I haven't tried this so it may not work! Paul McGuire, Holsworthy, Devon.  I have just read Mailbag in your September issue and I was enraged by David Sayers' comments on your excellent magazine. For one thing if David wants a mag with lots of articles on CBM64 I suggest he buys a magazine catering only for the 64 and not a well balanced mag like yours. Another thing, Ultimate deserved to be named Software House of the Year as it continually releases excellent games that put other games in the shade. As for not knowing the programmer's names, who remembers names anyway? My last point concerns the insulting way David put down British software houses. I for one would not buy a U.S. Gold game as they rely on propoganda to sell their games ie Raid Over Moscow I believe home-grown houses like Ultimate, Ocean and Software Projects are far better at producing top quality games. In fact the only overseas company worth mentioning is Melbourne House. Now I have got that off my chest, I can continue reading your first class magazine. Steven Hargadon, Strathclyde. run of the mill computer publication (like some mags I could mention). It is nice to see news of how computers are being used around the world. I don't doubt that many adventure game fans will be interested in establishments like the one called Treasure Trap that Keith Campbell and Co. visited If enough mags did the same as you did with Dr. Who then it would be back on the air again. New and better programs? You mean like Eastenders or Allo Allo? Don't make me laugh, the BBC's days of making good programmes is long gone. Scott Adams only wrote the first home computer adventure, so I don't see why he should be so important on the Adventure page. Well, Mr Mitchell, why don't you just stop buying C+VG if you don't like it, and then we wouldn't have to suffer little ***ers like you writing in and complaining about unimportant little gripes that nobody else agrees with anyway. By the way, Marcus Groan, thanks for doing what I mean to do â€” shoot an obnoxious little *!$* down in flames. But remember, everyone is entitled to their own taste in music, but it really annoys me when someone like Michael Steinmets forces his bands onto those that don't like them. As for record shops, they rarely have a section for specific types of music anymore, showing that they are becoming like everybody else, ignore the minority just make a fast buck. I'm sure Sir Clive knows what I am talking about. Tan Birch, Birmingham argument, preferably in my favour. I would like to say I agree with Stewart Wood's comments, from the July issue, that the adverts are a good idea, showing the reader which games/utilities are currently on the market. Also I agree with Marcus Groan, from the August issue, by saying that Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Duran Duran, Howard Jones etc, are all teenybopper nerds. David Wild, Attenborough, Notts. Editor's reply: Look, I know it's going to come as a big shock David, it did to me, but Max IS a real person. The actor's name is Matt Frewer who should be shot for revealing the secret! Still, maybe his alter-ego will do something about this little sneak in his next series. I for one can't wait for the return of Mr Headroom. TV isn't the same without him, is it? . I have bought your magazine ever since I got my CBM64, about 9 months ago. In this time I have not noticed a listing for a \"Turbo\" program. Surely you should include such a program that would at least speed up the time that we wait for games to load? Michael J. Lee, New South Wales Australia. Editor's reply: Great idea, Michael. Has anyone out there got a fast loader for the 64 they'd like to pass on to C+VG readers? I live in the United States, and recently while in London, I picked up a copy of Computer + Video Games. It's excellent. In the August issue a person wrote in and was complaining about the price of CBM64 software. I would love to be able to buy software for .95. In the USA the average price for software is around $35 (). Some of the better software sells for more than $60 (440). So, whoever you are, I just cannot sympathize with you. The software in the UK is good and inexpensive. Pirates like you will probably make the price of software go up, just like it did in the U.S. You people over there have a good thing going, don't spoil it! Karen Middaugh, U.S.A  I thought I would send you my little artistic outburst which took me all of 2 days to complete. Of course if you like it, you have my full permission to print it, in your wonderful magazine. As I am writing I must say how good C+VG is, especially the games reviews. Also I don't mind how many adverts are in it, your magazine is the best there is. Keep it up. Jonathan Howard, Bristol  Will somebody please tell D. Mitchell to shut up!!! Nobody asks him to buy your mag, but all he can do is moan. There are some people who use their computers as computers not as games machines like he obviously does and we like to hear news of how mainframes are being used in the film industry etc. It is the general interest articles that stop your mag becoming just another boring  There is a big argument in our family between my brother and myself because my brother, Matthew, read an article in one of the papers, with small pages and big print, about Max Headroom being an actor. I told him this could not be true. But he said it would cost thousands of pounds to program every expression and synchronise it with speech, and only a few computers in the world could do it, and the Pentagon has one. So that's what the President does in his spare time. Please could you settle this . With the weather being terrible outside I decided to purchase your magazine to help cheer me up. Like hell it did. 126 END "
