"hy Silicon Graphics Workstations should keep game costs down; Sega launches its new Mega-CD/Mega Drive handheld machine; and the latest news on how well the Jaguar is selling. SILICON GRAPHICS INFILTRATES GAMES INDUSTRY evelopers like Acclaim, Argonaut, Electronic Arts, Gremlin, Ocean, Sega and US Gold have been developing their games using Silicon development systems for some time, and at a recent seminar held by the technology gurus at Silicon Graphics they were showing precisely why these development machines cost in the region of ,000-,000 and over! Despite the high price of a Silicon Graphics Workstation, the company claims that development times can be significantly reduced and so reduce a game's development costs; certainly the crux of the seminar seems to be 'with a Silicon Workstation you can do a year's work in a month'. So will this mean cheaper games? Well, it hasn't been the case so far seeing as all the major software houses have been using these systems for some time, so CHANESSE obviously reasor; other than development costs must be why software prices still remain high. The sequel to Microcosm developed on Silicon gear was the game Silicon was showcasing at its seminar-comesales-pitch. Named Scavenger 4, it looks incredible and one of the game's artists was quick to point out that he'd generated graphics for entire levels in under a day. So why, if the graphics take so little time to produce, aren't developers devoting more time to creating that all important gameplay? We want to see more than just fancy introductions clogging up disk space. Certainly most software developers seem to be adopting the Silicon way of doing things just look at Probe's Mortal Kombat and Sega's Virtua Racing, and this can only mean more realistic environments for future gameplayers. From a developer's point of view, using a Silicon Graphics Workstation can halve a game's production times. For you, that should mean cheaper games but sadly it doesn't. Fancy graphics are easy to achieve with Silicon Graphics software. Apparently it doesn't take any experience to draw images like this! Silicon Graphics Workstations are already common place in movies (like Jurassic Park) and are now also used by big name developers. Above is Sega's 'Motion Theatre' ride. Virtua Racing is another example. "


"NEW SEGA PORTABLE NEW MULTI-FORMAT CONSOLE AT LAST We've heard as we doof a console made by Active Enterprises Ltd which is making the exciting claim of compatibility with Mega Drive, SNES, NES and CD-ROM games all in a single unit! It's designed to be portable so it's got a built in 3.2-inch screen and so, has a TV tuner option. That's all we know at the moment, and it probably infringes UK copyright laws so won't be on sale over here. he Multi-Mega one of Sega's best kept secrets was revealed at the Las Vegas CES. Combining both a Mega Drive and Mega-CD in the same box it's also a wonderfully smart, compact, portable unit. The CDX has all the features of a normal CD portable, so you can now play your music CDs without needing a Ty. The official release is April 1994, but there are only going to be limited stocks. It will retail for something in the region of , and will be bundled with a six-button joypad, an AC adaptor and a Mega-CD title as well as a Mega Drive title. The American version is to be called the CDX, so be careful you don't confuse the Multi-Mega with Datel's import cartridge thing for Mega-CDs, which is also called 'CDX'. ETERNAL CHAMPIONS BOOKS FOR GRABS TEGR DRIV FULL COLOUR O CONTACT: SEGA 071-373 3000 PLANS FOR 3DO CONSOLE ATARIS JAGUAR DOES THE BIZZ STATE SIDE irgin Publishing has released the inevitable Eternal Champions tips book. Each character gets the usual look-in with profiles, and strategies for attack sequences and defensive procedures. In fact, the book claims to be the only place to find EVERY detail about the game fully explained. It'll set you back a reasonable .99 to purchase but CVG has been given 10 copies to give away. TO WIN: tell us how many female characters there are in the game. Send your entry to: 3am Eternal, CVG, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. Alternatively, go buy a copy. You probably realise that 3DO stands for a specification rather than a machine, which is why different companies can make their own version of the system. Panasonic did the first, Sanyo is working on one, and now AT&T has decided to make one too. THE OFFICIAL POWER PLAY GUIDE Complete step-by-step guide to moves and tactics for every character! MEGA DRIVE ON-LINE O CONTACT: VIRGIN PUBLISHING 081-968 75540 TDS TRADING SOLVES IMPORT 3DO PROBLEM In a bid to bring further interactivity to games, AT&T of America is also launching the Edge16, a device which links Mega Drives over the phone line and allows you to talk to each other while you're playing. Compatible games will also be enhanceable with plug-in RAM cards for extra weapons and stuff. It sounds good in theory, and there's a lot of big name support for the system, but we can't help feeling that it's only really suited to head-to-head games and keep in mind that it's a lot cheaper to use a modem in the USA too. ales of Jaguar consoles in the USA appear to be reflecting scenes similar to the launch of the SNES in Japan. The lure of 64-bit power has caused a complete sell out of over 20,000 systems over the Christmas period (which would explain the lack of import machines over here), and at the recent CES the Jaguar pounced away with its share of awards from the American games magazines. These included 'best game system', and 'game of the show' for Tempest 2000. Bad news for 3DO eh? While the Yanks continue to rant and rave about the console, it remains to be seen how us down-to-earth Brits will take to it when the system eventually gets released around Easter. Let's hope Atari gets a foot-hold before Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation-X hit the scene by the close of the year, because 1995 is going to mean war. TDS has come up with a smart little gizmo which will allow you to finally connect your 3DO to a standard TV via an RGB SCART Socket. What it does is transform the NTSC SVHS signal to RGB. There are similar units around, but the TDS version is the only one to offer controls for fine tuning the picture as there are different tolerances between each 3DO machine. The unit also offers a red hue control to get correct skin tones with future MPEG applications like movies and games. So, now you can play the games the correct way in 60Hz and proper colour.

"STARDUST REVAMPED FOR A 1200 AND CD32 BACK-PACK KICKS BASS FOR GAMES he best graphics ever seen on an Amiga are about to get better when Stardust appears in May for A1200 and CD32 owners. Re-rendered in 256 colour VGA, the graphics in this shamelessly Asteroids based game will be more realistic than ever and destined for some sort of industry award. Extra levels, even better sound and of course improved speed, will be just some of the other enhancement. Yet the boys from Helsinki are also promising a few other startling surprises, but they ain't telling yet. ossibly the silliest thing shown at the recent CES show was the Aura Interactor. You strap this on your back and it vibrates in time with tunable bass frequencies from games. The idea is that you'll be able to feel on-screen explosions and enemy fire. Now that is S-A-D. At $80 it's also a right con and CVG reckons you can get the same rumbling effect by eating a large curry with the added sensation of smell too.

Peter Gabriel's multimedia project, All About Us, features his seven best videos on just one disc, including titles which have won Grammy and MTV Video awards. These include 'Kiss That Frog' which is a Silicon Graphics affair, so you can imagine the sort of quality you get here. The disc also includes rare interview clips with the people behind the videos. While comparable to Gabriel's similarly themed Xplora 1 disc for the Apple Macintosh, the CD-I version opens a new window for experiencing your music through more than just your speakers. Expect other musicians to follow suit. ooking shamelessly like a CD-I, the TXE console from MSU Limited is a PC-based 32-bit RISC system incorporating a 25Mhz 386 CPU, 32-bit colour, a double speed drive and built-in FMV capability. The system isn't due out till later this year offering a few games like Robocod and Lotus, but as always, unless it gets some developer support it's going to have a hard time getting established.

But just released is the official plug-in gun which should help a lot. It'll be out in the States by March 30. Also, following on from its sad attempt at Mad Dog McCree on the 3DO, American Laser Games is releasing a similar game set in the gangstar-ridden Thirties. Here you'll have to seek out the killer of Johnny Rock in a similar style of gameplay. Harvester will offer some horrific fighting action with a variety of deadly weapons.

"1994 PREVIEW LAS VEGAS REPORT NINTENDO CES Vegas home to the biggest cars, stars and hotels in the world, and now it's host to some of the 'biggest' computer games, consoles and silicon junkies on the planet at the 1994 Computer Entertainment Show. But the show wouldn't be complete if CVG wasn't there to bring you all the info about the new releases for '94. And no show would be worth attending unless the Big Nin' was there also to keep the punters happy, and so Las Vegas is as ready as anyone else to say \"Viva Nintendo...\" he Japanese giant has been out in force at the CES, in its own Ninimitable way. Apart from billions of new games it has filled the space with giant screens and arcade podiums. Brand new SFX chip games have been playing constantly, plus also on show is the first game to feature the SFX 2 chip, Stunt Race FX. But the subject on everyone's lips has to be the joint console venture between Nintendo and Silicon Graphics Project Reality, but the only thing on show is a couple of Onyx Reality Engine 2's (the giant quarter-of-a-million-pound development system that Silicon Graphics uses to produce its film graphics). Despite this, the two companies still claim they'll have demo machines this year and that the whole kaboodle will retail for under $250. Well, we'll just have to sit and wait, the following games are what we will be able to see on the shelves in '94 though... STUNTRACE FX trate a derelict tower block and defeat the renegade rogue droid. Puzzles, traps and lashings of violence. A sure winner! Kick Off 3 will be the most accurate footy sim around on the SNES, because players will have the chance to use any one of 30 spectacular finishing moves to score goals with, like trick overhead shots and other such spectacular set pieces. KICK OFF 3 BOOST 0'54\" CITADEL Grab hold of a 30-foot tall polygonbased robot and knock 12 bells out of like kinds! Yet another SFX chipbased game from the Argonaut stable. You can change into a land cruiser, walker, a jet or an impregnable hard shield. This really looks monster! There's no denying that the SFX 2 game by Argonaut looks absolutely stunning. It features four flexible cars that can change shape to squeeze in-between obstacles and 20 different tracks. The simultaneous twoplayer option works a treat and the way the car comes apart and blows to pieces is fab, but as racing games go it'll be pipped to the post by Virtua Racing know the score, the bloods on the door, but not in the Nintendo version. Eight Warriors from the past, present and future battle in a timeless arena to win the prize of immortality. Totally brutal war cries complete the carnage.

ZOOL Hack and slash, bash and dash! Nice scrolling backdrops and plenty of fisticuff action. Specials are a bit thin on the ground, but worth a look, if a little brief! Sun Corporation might have made crap games in the past, but things are definitely getting better. And Bugs Bunny Rampage is certainly a good example, the cartoon graphics are out of this world. Flan flinging, carrot exploding and often rib-ticklingly good. LOO PIRATES OF DARK WATER Giant Jap rubber dinos stalk the metropolis, not unlike King Of The Monsters, but in a SF2 scenario. Three-headed dragons and, of course, Godzillas that breathe fire, which can only mean one thing if you get in the way death. Last one left standing's the winner.

"1994 PREVIEW LAS VEGAS REPORT SEGA CES When Nintendo come to town, it goes without saying that you-know-who is going to be right there next to them (we daren't say behind them). CVG play and probe with everything Sega n Las Vegas they do things big. Finding your hotel room, for example, among the 3,000 other is a task in itself, and the Vegas Computer Entertainment Show makes similar events in Britain look piffling, and subsequently every major player is here. The other half of the Japanese duopoly (we're talking Sega here, just in case you haven't read the previous pages on Nintendo) is here in a bid to make sure it remains the other big player in the market. Sega is the second occupant of a huge Big Top set up in the middle of the show, and the star attraction is its amazing Virtua arcade games. One bank has been devoted to no less than five full-sized racing cars linked to Virtua Racing, while another portion holds the star of the show, an arcade Virtua Fighting machine! But enough of this introduction, here's a blow-by-blow account of the whole shebang... TIME O 30 01.3 crystal caverns, and battle amazing droids that can give as good as they get almost! VIRTUA RACING TIME 0 30 01 THE SIMPSONS: BART'S NIGHTMARE Anyone that doesn't know that Virtua Racing is completely nappy soaking by now must be the son of a thousand baboon fathers! In a PauUUU12 principle, Hurricanes is another popular cartoon series to spawn a videogame. The underdog football team is challenged to a match by arch enemy Stavros Garkos to determine the best team in the world, but it has to get to the stadium first! The soccer platformer lets you choose from the hot shot Hurricane team players and use their footy skills and brilliant graphics to defeat Stavros. Sonic!), 3D bonus levels and a proper simultaneous two-player option. In one-player mode Sonic and Tails are submerged underground, catapulted around a colourful anti-gravity carnival and nearly frozen in Arctic wasteland. In split screen, two player mode, there are even more new levels and a new time challenge where players race against each other to the end of a level against the clock. But why are you wasting your time reading this mere snippet when the full review is on page 34. From what we can see this is exactly the same as the fabulous SNES version. Join Bart in his nightmares and travel to strange lands inhabited by weird and wonderful beasts, like Homer Kong and the Temple Of Maggie. You can even get trapped in a wacky flick of the Itchy and Scratchy Show. The cartoon graphics are perfect and the varying game styles fun and seem endless. SONIC SUB-TERRANIA show with little ground breaking to offer, most are agreed that this cart has stolen the show! The new SVP chip has given the Mega Drive something to brag about. The game is an incredible achievement on the Mega Drive and has four fantastic camera angles with which to watch the action and a split screen feature. (Preview page 100.) Mind-blowing graphics as you take control of an experimental attack fighter on an 'offworld' satellite. Fly through gorgeous locations, such as BUBBA 'N' STIX One of the biggest surprises at the show was Sonic 3. Why? Because it was absolutely fantastic! Completely new levels, a new character, Knuckles (a kind of red version of HURRICANES Not at all unlike Soccer Kid in 16 "

Choose between, the prince apparent, or loz, a cunning sage and battle the pirates of evil Lord Bloth. Original platform games? Never! But you'll be surprised. Bubba is a thick truck driver whose best friend is a stick, an alien stick!

Once again gameplay leans heavily on brilliant bursts of animation and slapstick humour HIT THE ICE SPEED RACER JIM POWER SYLVESTER AND TWEETY CAGEY CAPERS Rattle your bones and strap on the padding for one of the most physical ice hockey games around. With the meanest checks and slap-shots outside of the Mutant League and a special power puck blast shot the competition in the ice hockey cart arena is warming up! Amazing animations and sampled voices that come straight out of the cartoons. The huge sprites and cartoon graphics hide some hilarious gameplay as the two get into all sorts of trouble with the Warner Bros characters. Accolade's very graphic racing game based on the Manga-styled American cartoon of the same name. Each of the 42 legs of the race is based on an episode of the show like Valley Of Destruction, Danger Pass and Snake Track which gives you some idea of the state of racing play! Great graphics and some nice racing action. The old Amiga platform shooter, but it's been given a clean up with improved graphics and sound. Supplied with the game is a pair of 3D glasses, so you can enjoy the fun multidimensionaly! RAINBOW ISLANDS SKITCHIN' BRET HULL BATTLETECH This ice hockey game features digitised players and instant replay options. There's also a chance to train players up and they can improve on such skills as stick handling, skating, shooting and aggressiveness.

Collect multiple rainbows and different treasures and progress over loads of themed levels past their guardian keepers. Toy world, Robot world and loads more stand in your way to getting over the rainbow. Fortyton battle droids scrap to the death to gain control of distant worlds. Fight on familiar terrain to gain control of planets or go up against a friend and his armour-plated machine, the choice is yours.

The WWF stars have been captured in full motion video and digitised into the game and put inside the cage. The action adventure version of Disney's classic film. Dodge carnivorous wolves in the snow-laden forests and use the enchanted servants to protect the castle from the villagers. Average graphics and not a lot of gameplay. Aladdin it is not! games. No prizes for guessing that this was based on the NHL games! The best athletes in the galaxy smash each other up while avoiding hazards in the arena, like gaping holes, fires and sharks! Oh what larks! The MTV cult metal heads inevitably get a video game to call their own courtesy of Viacom. None of the guys' particularly sick humour sticks out in the game, but the look and feel of it is pretty close to the cartoon series. Playability? From Viacom? Whadda you think?

"tions are still as impressive today as when the original laser disc arcade game was introduced. Impress your gran and perhaps have a laugh with Readysoft's Mega-CD version. COULD I INTEREST YOU IN A MEGA-CD TITLE SIR? Well if you are going to buy one, or you're the proud or pleased recipient of a Mega-CD (and if you're not then you're an ungrateful git 'gift horse in the mouth' and all that) then what you'll want in 1994 is plenty of new titles. Well these are some of the games on show at the Vegas Show... MANSION OF HIDDEN SOULS A kind of Seventh Guest adventure as you explore a strange mansion and encounter all its creepy inhabitants. Featuring digitised video footage in a window larger than that used in Night Trap but even more grainy. DRACULA UNLEASHED A large video footage window opens you up to the world of Dracula. The caped night creeper has been brought back to life and it's your job to unmask him before time runs out. Quite Gothic at times with a heavy element of mystery and suspense. DUNE 2 GROUND ZERO, TEXAS appearances from Corey 'Lost Boys' Haim and Debbie Harry The action's set in a creepy Edwardian mansion and players must find scores of secret rooms, traps and unravel the mysteries of the mansion by flicking between the digitised video footage and unravelling the cryptic clues given by the actors. TOMCAT ALLEY Top software is at last coming out for Sega's games-thirsty machine. The digitised video footage is the first to be full screen on the Mega CD. Jump into the cockpit of a fully armed Tomcat, you get the choice of being navigator or missiles expert. Dogfight through seven missions that are different every time. The movie footage was actually directed by Sam Nicholson who was responsible for the Star Trek movie. Virgin has taken this version directly from the PC CD-ROM game, but the problem is that this strategy game about the story of Aliens have invaded and landed in small town America, Sonic knows why! Another patented TruVideo adventure which basically boils down to a Mad Dog McCree video shoot-'em-up! If you want to know more then scroll to page 38 JURASSIC PARK Just about every format Jurassic Park has appeared on has provided a different styled game and Sega's Mega-CD EYE OF THE BEHOLDER PRIZE FIGHTER the Battle for Arrakis is looking pretty dated now. The intros and video footage are pretty impressive, plus some of the landscape scrolling is breathtaking (check out our early review of the game in our January issue). Console owners finally get a taste of what the computer buffs have been raving over for years, fantasy role playing adventure games! Eye Of The Beholder was the modern day Dungeon Master when it was released, and is the adventure that every other computer RPG tries to beat. Some have since, but with new graphics and atmospheric CD sound, this will be a classic. A first-person perspective video beat'em-up directed by Ron Stein, the fight choreographer responsible for Rocky III and Raging Bull. Real boxers take real punches and you can see all the action as the screen rocks and shakes as you get hit. Jab, weave, upper-cut and hook. At last Mega-CD technology put to some good use! version's no different. The dinosaurs and special effects have been created by Silicon Graphics, the original movie's dino creators. Players must negotiate the park and get off the island. The amazing Q sound effects complete the atmospheric gameplay. DRAGONS LAIR DOUBLE SWITCH Famous stars come fast and furious in this Night Trap style adventure.

"1994 PREVIEW LAS VEGAS REPORT JAGUAR  CES Where better for Atari to shout and holler about its 64-bit super console than the Vegas Computer Entertainment Show... NATARI I he Atari stand, despite its formidable new machine, seemed to have been relegated to a stand on the far side of the arena -hardly the prime position it was no doubt hoping for to sell its new wonder machine! As you might expect, though, visitors to CES went hunting for a glimpse of the Jaguar, and they weren't disappointed once they found it. Software is sparse at present; however, thanks to some clever marketing and the employment of several helpful young Jaguar ladies, we managed to secure all this fine information on all the best forthcoming 64bit games! The Jaguar has managed to pick up four out of five awards at the CES, given out by the American press, among which were Best Console and Best Game (Cybermorph). Take a look here and see what else is on the way. can lift this one above the ground. Just your average run-of-the-mill shooter I'm afraid, that admittedly attempts to show off what the Atari Jaguar is capable of graphically. INTRO ODENSE ALIEN VS PREDATOR This has come a long way since the early development pics were shown to the press. Players select either the Alien, the Predator or a Space Marine and skulk around 3D rendered tunnels and mazes getting to grips with digitised monsters in the texture mapped locations. The Alien can use its tail and razor-sharp jaws EVOLUTION: DINO DUDES The Jaguar needs this version of Humans like it needs 50,000 volts Jaguar and just about finished you can't fail to be impressed by its smart swish looks and speedy frame rate. What with the Mega Drive version of Virtua being so incredible, Chequered Flag 2's got to have the gameplay to match the graphics if it wants to be a real contender and not just a high-end also-ran. more animation and fabulous sound. There might even be some cartoons included in the game to reward players who have done well. But the amount of colours (16 million of them!) and graphics speak for themselves. CRESCENT GALAXY Simply a bog standard shoot-'emup with flashy ray-traced graphics. Not even the stunning backgrounds and massive pseudo-3D guardians CLUB DRIVE Set off around the globe on a Sunday drive like no other you've experienced before! A cross between Hard Drivin' and Micro Machines, all programmed with 3D polygon graphics. Race around carpets and breakfast tabletops, avoiding the marmalade (thin cut of course). to fight with. The Predator uses sophisticated weaponry like infrared night vision to seek out its victims while the poor old Marine has to rely on the tried-and-tested machine-gun and computer equipment to hunt the others down. The camera even races along the corridors to recreate the high tension chase sequences in the Alien movie. (Want to read more about this sexy new title? Turn to our in-depth preview on page 24.) passed across its 32-bit bus! Move the cavemen from one end of the screen to the other by balancing them on top of each other and using various objects that they find lying around. This is not what the Jaguar was created for, Atari let's not let it happen again, eh? TINY TOON ADVENTURES CHEQUERED FLAG 2 Touted as Virtua Racing on the Specially enhanced version of the Konami classic with 20 "


"3DO CES The CES has to be a golden, nay, platinum opportunity to show off the 3DO and fulfil the promises of quality games' for the new machine... rip Hawkins' 3DO Company obviously sees the CES as an excellent platform to announce its debut titles for the 3DO. There are no less than 143 new games in production for the machine, and there are scores of companies like Bullfrog, Psygnosis and Interplay signing up to produce games, which has to be good news for 3DO; certainly everyone was expecting it to be a major player from the word go. Rumours are rife about 3D0 signing up Capcom to produce games for the machine; certainly if anything's going to make the 3DO a worthy purchase then an arcade perfect conversion of Streetfighter 3 has to be it! So here's an insight into what you can expect to see games-wise when the machine's launched over here... JURASSIC PARK ROAD RASH TOTAL ECLIPSE ESCAPE FROM MONSTER MANOR The 3DO Jurassic Park is looking as good, if not better, than its cross format cousins. Varying gameplay styles, from Operation Wolf to normal racing and great attention to detail! Reworked from the Sega version, Road Rash uses actual film footage The way scenery speeds past you and the rate the screen updates is unbelievable, but when the bike moves to the edge of the screen it tends to 'float' in the air. Crystal Dynamix products are light years ahead of most of the others and this top-rated shoot-'em-up is a fine example of the 3DO's potential for gorgeous, playable releases. 20 levels, synthesised actors and lasers galore! Collect the pieces of a scattered talisman and rid the world of various ghoulies! The special effects are truly film-like with transparent spooks and clay animated zombies, A real shocker!

"1994 PREVIEW LAS VEGAS REPORT HANDHELDS CES You don't need a Mega Drive or SNES to enjoy decent carts, as the new handheld releases at the CES only go to prove... GAME BOY | andheld users have little to worry about this year, apart from Lynx owners that is. We haven't been able to find one single Lynx product on display at the show. Despite Atari heralding the arrival of the Jaguar, it seems to have forgotten about its handheld counterpart. However, if your main machine is a Game Boy/Gear, or it's simply what you play while you're 'on the move', then feast your eyes on what is only a selection of titles coming your way in '94... GAME BOY GAME GEAR you collect eggs 1 EUR from inside the park and try to escape through the electrified compounds. Clear graphics that work well. CRASH DUMMIES DAFFY DUCK water to get your birdie. Possibly one of the best golfing games on any handheld BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES Slapstick action as the plastic crash droids get up to their tricks on the Gear. The colours and detail are great and far superior to the Game Boy version, so check it out Daffy, alias Duck Dodgers, comes up against Marvin the Martian and has to stop him destroying Earth because it spoils his view of Venus! The daft duck's got a little help from his shrinking raygun, but he really needs you on his side to pull it off! Based on the current cartoon series, and in the same graphical style. A basic platform game that just pips the now ageing Game Boy Batman game to the post. e A basic 1 2 -23 BART VS THE WORLD JURASSIC PARK Five gigantic levels to explore, with jungles, swamps, towering cliffs, fierce volcanoes and wild dinosaur chases. Great graphics, but lacks the sound of the 16-bit versions. ANDRE AGASSI TENNIS The Simpson family return with more crazy stunts and weird and wonderful characters. DESERT SPEED TRAP T2: JUDGEMENT WARIO LAND 3 If this were a Mario game it would be the best ever, but as the evil Wario it just outstrips the competition for best handheld platformer ever. Loads of moves and secret rooms as you hunt for treasure with big, clear sprites and stunning gameplay DAY Tennis hasn't done well on the Game Boy, and the mono screen doesn't help. In contrast Andre is quite smart and apart from normal one-on-one you can also play doubles! You play Arnie in a heavy platform romp where you have a variety of weapons to battle the T1000 (some nice liquid versions) with. Road Runner and Wile E Coyote scorch across the desert and sun kissed highways in a race to the finish. Keep the bird away from the furry rascal and top up on seed to stay in the race. METAL MASTERS COLUMNS 3 MUHAMMAD ALI BOXING DEEP DUCK TROUBLE Years old beat-'em-up that first turned up on the Amiga. Two giant robots bash it out in an arena for cash with you at the controls. Buy better weapons and armour and make it to the top of the BE league As any fight fan knows it takes more than a couple of jabs and a few moves in your arsenal to make K = a top beat-'em-up and I'm afraid The Boy's just not up to it! The presentation is quite clear but it's simply not going to be 'The Greatest'. PAPID COLORS The Mega Drive version plays with five human opponents, but here you're limited by the size of the screen. The game plays the same and so are most of the features. More Disney platform fun. Uncle Scrooge McDuck has contracted a mysterious curse from an ancient pendant.

VOYEUR REC STRIKER ccording to Philips, it has now sold 200,000 CD-i players worldwide, and with a more impressive new joypad replacing the infrared controller, a light gun and its stunning Digital Video Cartridge, the company is resembling more of a major contender in the CD market. From what we've managed to glean from the show, CD-i's products are way ahead of any of its CD competitors. On equivalent titles such as Mad Dog and other video-style games, Philips' rivals are lacking in the picture and sound quality fronts. The company has also signed up film giant MGM, who join Paramount, as one of the ever growing list of movie producers bringing out CD films for the machine. Also announced is a new carousel player, the Magnanavox, that allows up to five CDs to be played, one after another, thus eliminating the problem of CD movies coming on two discs and having to be swapped half way through a feature.

"WORK IN PROGRESS  ALIEN PREDATOR M CVC CO ON LOCATION TO OXFORD TO TRACK DOWN THE MEN WHO COMPRISE REBELLION ONLY TO FIND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON A HUGE NEW JACUAR LICENCE. THE WORDS \"ON MOTHER' SPRING TO MIND... "


"AVP FACTS Machine Jaguar Out: March (provisional) Producers: Rebellion Team: Jason Kingsley (Producer), Andrew Whittaker (Alien Intelligence), Toby Banfield (Graphics), Stuart Wilson (Graphics) Justin Rae, Rob Dibley and Mike Beaton (Coding) because we've achieved so much in only nine months. When we showed the game to 20th Century Fox at the CES they were really impressed. I think that up until now no-one has really done justice to its licences.\" The plot is simple, and you can't help but get the feeling that if 20th Century Fox decide to unite Aliens with Predator on the big screen, this would be the best way to do it. A Yes the bitch is back, and facing an opponent almost as formidable as Sigourney Weaver. How many colours? The game is set predominately inside a marine base, where most of the troops have gone off on exercise, leaving you and a few mates behind. That's when you discover an abandoned ship; abandoned that is except for the aliens, who are released into the base. After getting to a safe area you send a distress signal. Fortunately your marine buddies pick it up, but so does a passing n the outskirts of Oxford something big is happening. Two of the most ferocious aliens ever to hit the big screen are about to take on the human race in an entirely new breed of game. Development house, Rebellion, is working on what is undoubtedly one of the biggest licences ever to hit a home computer, Alien vs Predator This impressive licence is for an equally impressive system, the Jaguar, a machine Rebellion head-honcho Jason Kingsley can't enthuse enough about. «With Alien vs Predator we've got a game which has the Jaguar easily matching the performance of a '486 DX2 66Mhz PC.\" More impressive is that the Jag costs a fifth of the price of a decent PC. Rebellion's Alien Vs Predator on the Jaguar will look as good as anything on a 486 DX2 66MHz PC. Predator ship... There's certainly plenty of storThis translates into a first age room to play with. Although person perspective Jag cartridges have a similar storshoot-'em-up, age capacity to normal SNES and along the lines Mega Drive carts, special compresof games such as sion routines allow more to be Terminator crammed on. In the case of AvP it's Rampage and a 2Mb (16M-bit) cart with around Doom, although as 40Mb (112M-bits) squeezed on. Jason Kingsley points out this isn't a case of producing a similar Let's go ape game. «Doom is certainly All this room has been put to good impressive, but that only use. The game is set over seven levruns in 8-bit colour mode, els of Marine base, two on the AvP runs in 16-bit (65,000 Predator ship and one in the Alien colours). You also have the craft. Elements have been boropportunity of playing the three rowed from the movies for the varmain characters which gives the ious scenes, such as the Med-lab in game even more lasting appeal.\" the base and the egg room, 21st Century game Even before the character intelligence routines had been included, the game was attracting plenty of interest. At the CES it pulled crowds to the Jaguar stand where Kinsgley and Co had to fend off questions such as \"So it's running on video, is it?\" The fact was what they were seeing was the real Mcoy. «We're very pleased with AVP so far,\" says Kingsley, «especially MODEL GRAPHICS With the characters all being drawn in 3D, the graphics team needed to come up with a way of making them look convincing from all angles. In the end they opted to use models, which are photographed, scanned in and then retouched before being dropped into the game. The models are a mixture of off-the shelf kits and custom-made figures. A similar system has been used for the backdrops. The walls, ceilings and floors are made up from tiles which were first made out of wax and resin and then digitised and overlaid on the backgrounds. The technique used to map the graphics on to the background is similar to texture mapping on the PC, which has become common place in the last 12 months. Rebellion calls its version Advance Texture Manipulation, which allows fast graphics movement in high resolution mode. In this case that means 64,000 colours on screen at once. The resulting 3D effect is astounding, especially when your character moves sideways. First a resin and femo model of Predator is built, photographed against a plain background and then picture scanned into a PC. Then it's a case of cutting out the image and calculating various facets such as light sources. The next part of translating the Predator from film to computer is the backdrop. Nearly all of them start off life like this. The yellow panel is actually made out of wax to give it a translucent look, which will form the walls of the Predator ship. This is a model which will feature in Rebellion's Dungeon, a Jaguar game due for release later this year. It's a Dungeons & Dragons adventure featuring all manner of ghoulish critters that are after your flesh. Rebellion believes in the 'method' way of programming. This is one of the team getting into a role. "


"WORK IN PROGRESS where you can go crazy-ape with your flame thrower just like Ripley did in Aliens. From what we've seen, Alien vs Predator could do for the Jaguar what Sonic did for the Mega Drive. Even though the version we saw was at least a month from completion it's clear to see that this game is going to be something special. The game's characters all have different tasks and different weapons at their disposal. they've included an 'honour' points system. Basically if you attack something that isn't armed or isn't a direct threat to you, points are deducted. Keep up that sort of behaviour and you'll be kicked out of the tribe. You ultimate aim is to claim the head of the Queen Alien in one-on-one combat. Your mission, as a top marine, is to take care of the Predator, kill the queen alien, make acidic crunchy mincemeat out of her drones and rescue all your marine mates before the face huggers get them. For this you have access to all the neat weapons from the film, ranging from the totally ace pulse rifles and flame throwers the rather puny pistol and knife All the ingredients you need to create your very own version Alien vs Predator. Wax, a gas burner, several bits of multicoloured Lego, a few books and some models. Oh, and of course, programmers, artists and several thousand pounds worth of development machine. Alien Despite their fearsome film presence, the Aliens in the game start out disadvantaged. Without ranged weapons they might be helpless compared to the marines and the lethal Predator. But this has been remedied, with the Aliens being able to run twice as fast as any of the other characters and use air ducts. So basically they can find out where a character is heading and get there before and lie in wait. Their mode of attack is short and violent; like in the acid-spewing Aliens use jaws, hands, tails, or a lethal combination of all the above. Predator The biggest problem Rebellion had with including the Predator is that, basically, he's death on legs. Having loads of high-tech weapons plus and invisibility gadget means he'd make short work out of the marines and the aliens. To get around this A Predator's-eye view. As in the movies, he has several different displays which come in handy for particular situations. He's also kitted out with all the necessary tools of the trade, including a cannon, net gun and the rather deadly boomerang which sliced Gary Busey in half in Predator 2, film fans. 65,000 colours and 40Mb of game could AvP set the standard for the Jaguar? DARI HO COMIC CAPERS Alien vs Predator the game isn't the first time these two have gone head-to-head, 1992 saw them thrashing the hell out of each other courtesy of Dark Horse Comics. The storyline was basically an excuse for an ultra-action slug-fest, with the Predator landing on an alieninfested planet where a small band of humans are struggling for survival. What it boils down to is the Predator is after the aliens, the aliens after the humans and the humans after everyone. Keep an eye out for the Predator's latest Dark Horse comic outing where he squares off against Robocop. Med-lab is a dangerous place to hang around. Fortunately there's usually several inches of glass between you and the aliens. The face huggers behave just as they did in the movies, scuttling across the floor then leaping. You have to move fast to shoot them. As a marine one of your only advantages is access to the armouries. The Aliens aren't bright enough to use weapons and the Predator is hard enough already. If you don't keep a note of their location you're liable to run out of ammunition leaving you wielding just a knife, which isn't the best weapon to attack an alien with. POC# Doors don't open automatically, which can really slow you down if you're running from an alien, and not all doors have convenient glass windows. Often there's no way to tell what's on the other side other than to open them. This is has to be one of the highlights of the game the alien egg room. Get too close to an egg and it slowly opens, at which point you'd better start shooting or you'll find yourself wearing a face mask which isn't very easy to get rid of. Sound effects for doors, guns, the aliens, the Predator and many other features are being sampled straight from the appropriate films. Rather than opt for background music, Rebellion has decided to put the Jaguar's sound processor to use, churning out atmospheric background effects. If you're a marine, the Predator is your greatest worry. If you're unarmed and run away without bothering him you should be OK; but if you decide to attack you could end up as the latest addition to his trophy cabinet, "

"WORD UP WITH PAUL f you've been watching TV, reading the newspaper or listening to the radio lately you'll no doubt be aware that the Monopolies And Mergers Commission is currently investigating the videogames industry following a number of complaints from various parties concerning, among other issues, the huge market share enjoyed by Sega and Nintendo and the high price of software. Good thing or bad thing? To be honest, it'll probably end up a waste-of-time thing. Despite the claims of high production costs, cartridge prices are excessive and if you don't think so at the moment, wait until you have to fork out  for a copy of Virtua Racing. Also, compare UK prices with their US equivalents - over here, as opposed to $40-$50 over there, which works out at around -. A hefty increase, in anybody's book. What makes the MMC investigation a little pointless, though, is that the punter you is voting against these high prices by hitting where it hurts the industry purse. It's not really the fault of the games companies that they charge through-the-roof prices for their titles after the distributor, retailer, licensor (if it's a movie or coin-op based title) have taken their cut not forgetting the substantial amount which has to be paid to Sega or Nintendo for the privilege of creating games that run on their systems there's not a lot left for profit. Cartridge sales are down dramatically, according to various industry bigwigs, and increasingly more people are looking towards new technology such as Jaguar, CD32 and high-end PCs, with better graphics, faster processors and bigger games than the current crop of consoles. So by the time the MMC's report is given to the government at the end of the year, it could be possible that The Big Two's market share is a far cry from the 90% currently held. And what can the MMC do anyway? In America, where similar action was taken, the result was a ticking off and a slightly less rigid licensing system. So, worthwhile attempt to loosen the grip of the big boys, or too little too late? We shall see. In the meantime, make sure you only buy the best by reading CVG every month, and happy gaming!

SIGHTING Tap the C button to proyoke the enemy and reduce their green energy bar. An excellent and highly amusing feature. Bandwagon. Definition? See Sega's release of SF II clone Art of Fighting et al... mitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so they say, and if that's true then the original Streetfighter machine that appeared way back in 1986 is probably feeling as flat as a pancake by now. Apart from spawning the greatest beat-'em-up ever, Streetfighter II, it's inspired no end of run-of-the-mill fighting games. man, while the other has a head-on collision, but we'll leave the final judgement for the verdict. As for the story, well what do you expect. Exactly. There's no surprises here either. It's the usual cliche-ridden rubbish about some pretty looking girl being abducted and requiring the assistance of a group of braindead musclemen. This, of course, boils down to the standard beat-'em-up affair with lots of combat-able dudes thumping the stuffing out of each other over different backdrops and differing time lengths and hey, you can even play the bosses or both have the same characters. Big Deal. The character profiles include what the blood type of each character is. Why? All the standard Streetfighter attacks are here, such as this fireball attack. Moan, moan, moan The other pale imitations rely on either ripping off Streetfighter moves or require gameplay-destroying complex combos. GRAPHICS Only Bally Midway's excellent Mortal Kombat series has offered anything like competition to Capcom's wonder though. The reason? Well, apart from the infamous death moves it also has a range of regular fighting combinations which are as easy and nearly as much fun to pull off as Streetfighter II's. To access the special attacks the green energy bar is used up. To replenish it hold the C button and the character meditates. Rant, Rave Predictably Art of Fighting goes down both of result? One is in dire need of an AA GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 8 VERDICT Beat-'em-ups have to be pretty special nowadays to compete with the likes of Streetfighter II and sadly Art of Fighting isn't. Like Turtles Tournament the basic SF moves have been ripped off, but unlike the Konami game the new moves are bland and require difficult combinations to pull them off. Add this to slow and unresponsive controls, irritating NeoGeo-style music and muffled FX and you've got a beat-'em-up that should be kicked into submission. Stick with Streetfighter Ilon Sega's own excellent Eternal Champions. ONWOOD 59 RIK SKEWS Art of Fighting is mediocre and dreadfully uninspired. Stick with Streetfighter II SCE. 33 "

After all, they've had two games with which to get used to his evil manner. Knuckles is more naive however. He's guardian of the Chaos Emeralds and like a Good Samaritan is willing to believe the best in everyone. ing the world. So when Knuckles catches Sonic heading his way, fresh from grabbing the Emeralds from Robotnik's Clutches, he sets an ambush to return them to Robotnik. Sonic 3 has everything: the graphics are stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking; appropriate tunes complement the action perfectly and the sound FX are equally brilliant. But this is nothing compared to the gameplay! You can play it fast for a buzz or you can take it slow and look in every nook and cranny for bonuses. Either way you'll have the time of your life. Bigger, better, faster, more; Sonic 3 packs every gameplaying treat you could possibly ever want. RIK SKEWS Sonic the Hedgehog Robotnik's taken advantage of Knuckles' friendliness and has made up all manner of despicable stories about how Sonic is the Emerald stealing evil doer while he, Robotnik, is a gallant robot, dedicated to savSonic 2 Little does Knuckles know that Sonic was going to return the Emeralds to him. Now, with the power of the crystals in his hands, Robotnik can set about the task of recharging his war machine that was crippled at the end of Sonic 2. All these events have left Sonic a little ruffled as on the one hand he must yet again put an end to Robotnik's evil plan, while on the other he must get his pal Tails home. Sonic Spinball However, he and Tails are running late anyhow and Sonic quickly realises that the best course of action would be to plunge back, once again, into platform related action With this being a Sonic game the main idea, of course, is to collect rings. Apart from the standard extra life to be gained from collecting 100, if just 50 are gathered and a special stage marker passed by, Sonic will be transported to a special bonus level. Here he starts SUPER-SONIC Sonic's not taking any nonsense from either the scenery or the baddies and to this effect he can collect three different and highly useful pick-ups.

"USE OU SO ON YOUR MARKS MEGA DRIVE There's a great two-player split-screen mode in Sonic 3. What's even better is that the levels are completely different to those in the main game. Value for money huh?! Here's a gander at them: TIME U bor TIME, O 12 42 Loops a-plenty await you in the Azure Lake zone. PROS: Bigger, better, brighter and more. VIME UMA SUE CONS: More of the same. BINE DUBLATNE TIME 0212 43 Knuckles and Tails succeed in defying gravity! GRAPHICS Some of the best we've seen on the machine for a platform game.

UMEA TIME, IT 26 27 MHE LU Avoid the quicksand in the Desert Palace... ... And watch out for the falling platforms too. GAMEPLAY Play it fast and finish it quick, or slow and search for hidden rooms.

If this is done then a power-up laden gum ball drops out. Collect this and one of a number of bonuses (extra-life, shield etc) is your reward. VERDICT In previous games, heaps of rings had to be collected before Sonic got a sniff at the special stage. In Sonic 3 you need only collect one Mega Ring, but rest assured it's tucked away so finding it won't be easy. Once you do you'll be whisked away to an excellent 3D level. It's here where you have to pick up all the blue spheres, while avoiding the deadly red ones and bouncers which will spring you all over the place. Succeed and you'll be rewarded with one of the Chaos Emeralds. Fail and you'll die horribly. Just kidding you'll return to the main game. Sonic 3 A nifty save game feature has also been included. This allows you to save up to six different games at whatever level you wish. However, it doesn't save which act you are in or the position that you've got to, simply the level. It does take account of how many continues and Chaos Emeralds you've saved though. Anyway, by now you should have gathered that Sonic 3 is a truly excellent game, and if you haven't then listen up. 'Sonic 3 is brilliant'. Thank you! ONWUOVO MISS OK HIT! I was all set to be highly critical of Sonic 3 after hearing that it was more of the same. Well, the same it is, but there are so many new and imaginative ideas that I have no complaints. The speed is brilliant, the graphics are far more detailed than the previous games, and being able to accelerate from a standstill is a superb addition. The levels are bigger, and in two-player mode it's really interactive with Tails being able to pick up Sonic and drop him elsewhere. This will keep you busy 'til Sonic 6 comes along. 94 DENIZ AHMET 36 "

To cover as much of the town as possible, there are four battle cameras, with these you can keep up with all the goings on, gain information from your field, agents and blast the miscreants into atomic soup.

"ILLIULIT VERDICT GROUND ZERO TEXAS Built at the far-off Mechan-o works, the aliens' space craft is the Reliant Rialto of the spaceways. Capable of reaching warp five with a push start and rolling along at an economical three-parsecs to the gallon. The idea of spending millions on 'real' film footage has paid off in Ground Zero as the production is excellent, but the problem is that the plot is still something akin to a Fifties B-movie. Various scenarios have been filmed so you can't just learn a level as a different alien will try and kill you each time. Once you've got past the painful film intro though, there is decent game here, but at the end of the day (and indeed the end of the game) all you're doing is pointing and shooting. PROS: Excellent film footage and some novel gameplay for this kind of game. CONS: Can get a bit repetitive and the FMV is somewhat grainy. GARY LORD VERDICT GRAPHICS Slightly grainy in places, but the screen area is nice and large. it up. As the cameras get damaged the picture breaks up, until it's finally put out of action. Hard hat By hanging out with the locals you gradually piece together what the aliens are after, plus discover the four digit access code which takes you to the next level and their hide, out. The game changes slightly on the later stages as you try to infiltrate the aliens base and encourage them to abandon their plans for world domination. The format switches to a first-person perspec. tive as you're now in control of a mobile camera strapped to a marine's helmet. Despite the evolvins plot, it's still the same shoot-orbe shot gameplay, even when you get to see what the aliens look like I'm in two minds over Ground Zero, Texas. The production is excellent: massive cast, excellent sets and totally overthe-top acting. On the other hand, the action is repetitive and the controls aren't very responsive. Together the plot-scenes almost balance the action, but what you're paying for is a game, not a movie, so in that respect it's a bit of a let down. However it comes on two CDs and there's enough action to make it reasonable value, if a bit tedious. One of the better interactive movie games around. ONDOS Clear speech and plenty of whizbang effects. DENIZ AHMET GAMEPLAY Varies slightly later on, but is still very basic and repetitive. when they shed their human shape Technically the game is impres sive. When you shoot an alien the cut to it flying backwards is instanta neous. The footage is very grainy in places when compared to Sega's latest offering, Double Switch, but the action's usually so fast it doesn't make any difference. For two discs and the amount of action they contain, it's a decent price. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES This is one of your marine pals so don't shoot him.

The game itself is something of a disappointment, though: the graphics in the boxing section are pretty poor; the 'management' sections are basic once you strip away the FMV, and the fighting is lifeless, with only a scant number of moves to perform. The only enjoyment you get out of the game is by rising up the ratings, but apart from that there's very little here unless you're a massive boxing fan. Hurrah! Another win under your belt.

The wire-frame view shows that the plumbing has yet to be connected. TITITIE ries, leisure facilities and the like, and your decisions dictated the success or failure of your metropolis Sim City was a huge success across the formats and now, Maxis has launched the sequel, initially available on Apple Macintosh with other incarnations to follow close behind. f you wanted to do a rundown on the most influential games ever to appear, then Sim City would be high on everybody's list. Your task was to build an O or may not The idea is to build a bustling community from nothing. Gameplay is similar to the original, but compared to 2000, Sim City looks positively ancient because there is a wider array of features. Many of your choices can be broken down to specific options -for example, clicking and holding down the industrial area icon brings 2AXIS entire city from scratch on a barren area of land. You decided when and where to build homes, shops, factoWER FREE HOUSE! The residents in your city don't just think of themselves all the time they can show their gratitude for your building them a fine place to live. Once the population's reached 2,000, they club together to buy you a smart mansion. Since we're all snobs down here, we keep placing our mansions as far away from the common herd as possible.

"VERDICT There's a staggering amount of options and features in Sim City 2000 which you can employ to keep your cities and interest ticking over for ages. Whereas each of the city-building icons in Sim City allowed you to perform only one action, in 2000 they're more like an index to an array of options. In fact, there's too much to talk about here.

Whereas the original Sim City offered only the basic rate of income tax to be tinkered with, here you can add sales tax and other indirect taxation, including the legalisation of gambling which rakes in valuable dollars but encourages crime. Remember that, for every decision you make, there will be a reaction from the inhabitants of your city, be it positive or negative. Residents are never happy with their lot though, and will expect you to make various improvements and if you want those taxes flowing into the city bank account, then it's wise to listen to what they have to say. The best way of monitoring the populace's wishes is to read the newspapers; to begin with there's only one paper available, but as the city grows more journals appear.

From there on in you can decide to become a buccaneering type, running riot on the high seas freeing trading ships of their cargo and turning over remote outposts. Mutiny Mr Christian irst off, don't confuse this with the absolutely dreadful NES version of Pirates. This is a different game, despite being crammed full of salty sea-dogs and released by the same company. Set in the days when it was polit ically correct to flog miscreants over gun barrels and beat your servants, the aim of the game is to take your ship and kill, maim and trade your way around the West Indies. If you've been a particularly good captain you'll be awarded with commissions from the Navy and a chance of carving a name for yourself in history. In many ways Pirates is very much like Elite on the ocean waves. Like that game you start off with a ship, a If things are going well for you, it's worth ditching your ship for something a bit better. When you've got your hands on something with more guns than sails you can team up with the local Navy and take part in battles. The problem is that the larger the crew you have, the greater the chance of a mutiny. The sword fighting section looks passable, until you see it moving.

STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT TIILIT As much as I like open games like this, where you can basically sort out your own tactics and strategy, Pirates Gold tries to do to much without the substance to back it up. Technically this sucks like a granny with a Murray Mint, but the biggest travesty has to be the fight sequences. The graphics and animation are awful, which is a shame seeing as the CD32 is 32-bit with 256 colours.

What you get here is 12 distinct types of game, some of which are action based, like tunnel shoot\"em-ups, and others which are puzzle-based, like a Vortex Bridge where you have to outwit an invisible opponent in getting across without landing on the same tile. However, there are a number of such stages which reoccur at intervals with a harder setting, so you end up with quite a large game of 30 odd stages. Controls are simple and of the cursor key type, so you get an There are quite a few maze type puzzles to sort out. Different paths provide different routes through the game. VERDICT This is easily the best movie tie-in yet on PC. The graphics are spectacular, and shift at a pace which defies their complexity. Most of the animation has been rendered from different view points so it's likely to be different each time you play.

Chuck doesn't take kindly to hidden objects popping up. 0011108S 0001610S f there's one thing you expect from a CD game it's lastability, and one good way to achieve this is plenty of levels. Now I realise the prehistoric era wasn't a particularly dynamic time, but I would have Chuck can actually get away with falling long distances. your common or garden caveman club quite unenthusiastic. Nothing new here Chuck Jnr can climb on his stick to avoid ground dangers and bash through some scenery (for sake of secret passages), but these features aren't really put to creative use, and are used rarely. Ultimately, it's a case of cosmetic improvements over the important one of gameplay for Chuck II. There's lots of clever parallax in Chuck II. The bosses are actually a high point of the game thanks to their creative animation. As usual, you have to bash them on the head. ONDOS thought that with a little imagination the programmers would have been able to stretch beyond the rather lazy sum of six levels. Now the other problem of course, which makes the first one worse, is that Chuck 2 is rather easy. Initially, because the levels are quite compact for a CD game, but more to do with the simple puzzles you face. As Chuck Jnr, the quest to rescue your old man brings few demands on a player's skill, being restricted to merely dodging falling scenery and avoiding spikes. Sure, there's some enemy clubbing action in there, which is made fun by a well-animated and humourous character sprite, but the enemy lacks any intelligence.

It's too easy and predictable, and six levels isn't going to challenge the mature player. The bosses and likeable Chuck Jnr sprite save the game's appeal, but it still feels like a cartridge game.

The switch to a platform from shoot-'em-up for Twinbee hasn't come off badly at all. Familiar aspects like the power-up bells have been retained and the 'cute' factor is still evident.

"REVIEW CD32 by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 | Out now. Contact Electronic Arts (0753 549442) for information. THE Labyrinth offers some spectacular graphics, but unfortunately they don't scroll. o E TIME One of the few animated sequences in the game. That coffin will swing open. Mindscape's Liberation showed what a good maze-type game should be; was Labyrinth paying attention? The puzzles in this are straight forward once you find the correct object. Go inside his mouth for a confusing maze of mirrors. Use your map to help you out. These look good but don't actually offer any use which is the problem with this game. GRAPHICS SOUND You start in the subway train with two exits to the game. and discover this game is little more than a gallery show. Yep, the graphics don't scroll they simply refresh when it comes to every new scene. What's more, each scene has to be loaded in, so there's a frustrating pause while data gets shifted. The object of the game is to destroy the labyrinth before it extends to consume time and space. You do this by solving puzzles of the 'collect A to achieve B and activate C' variety. The trouble is, there's too rom the packaging you'd think Labyrinth to be a stunning graphic adventure, not unlike Virgin's Seventh Guest. Your initial excitement soon collapses however, when you begin to move the cursor EPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES much emphasis placed on the exploration angle. This means that every room needs to be examined in detail, looking at objects, moving objects and opening other objects (but that's all you can do by the way). The end result is a tiresome trudge with trial and error gameplay. There isn't much here to interact with at all. VERDICT U6 There used to be a time when maze games didn't scroll. These days most of them do. Not so with Labyrinth however, and this limits the game's interactive quality. Perhaps CD32 isn't technically up to scrolling images of this quality, but you still expect it. The best thing about the game is the atmospheric music, because the gameplay is actually very dull, with little to do apart from explore. You can never seem to do what you want, which is partly due to design, but more to do with the lack of icons at your disposal. Stick to Liberation I'd say. ONWA UONO Round in circles Your travels are helped by the automatic mapping option which helps you out of disoriented situations (which are quite often). You can also use elevators, transporters and the subway to enter other dimensions which gives some depth. Labyrinth is unlikely to appeal to the majority.

SNES OUT ON IMPORT -70 R TYPE uper R-Type on the SNES was one of the first titles to be released on the machine. It was a blinding conversion of the second R-Type coin-op, but suffered immensely from jerky slow down. This was made worse by the fact that the older PC-Engine version had none of these problems, and is still the best conversion of that coin-op. So you had all these proud new SNES owners put to shame by a console the size of a matchbox. A lot of the bosses feature excellent Mode 7 rotational effects, unlike previous R-Types. No go slow Times have changed though, and programmers have learned a thing or two about the SNES, SO with R-Type Ill the first thing which has to be said is that there is no slow-down problem. The graphics have also been improved in definition, the scrolling DCCSSTEFEES A shoot-'em-up with backwards scrolling graphics? Yes, the game which coined the term 'shoot-'emup' has returned in a new improved incarnation... 62 All those familiar weapon add-ons are here again. However, the death of baddies is far more graphic and dramatic. You can now select from three awesome weapon systems. "

A display in the bottom-left of the screen shows your status, and if things get hairy your co-pilot lets out a sampled yell telling you to get out. Spin me round The gameplay is based on a system called Rotoscoping, where your helicopter remains static on the screen while the landscape rotates around it. This system has been used in other games, such as Super Contra, and does take some getting used to. When you've been through the basic 14 missions, you're taken back to the start, only this time with more enemies, who are better shots and react quicker. Enemy missiles are also more accurate and a hell of a lot quicker.

SES Desert Strike this isn't, but enjoyable it is. There are no CD-specific thrills, just a very simple, fun shoot-'em-up. All you're asked to do is point your helicopter in the right direction and fire. There's plenty to see and shoot and the later levels are very tough indeed. The only beef I have with this game is the price. There's not enough in the game to justify the price tag. A tenner less and this would have been a worthwhile purchase, but in its current form it's just not worth the asking price.

R-Type is more of the same, just more technically refined. Gone is the slow-down, the jerky graphics and unintelligent baddies. In are three new weapon system defaults, lashings of bolt-on weapons and clever Mode 7 effects which are part of the gameplay. The ideas in this are not new, but who's to say that old ideas are bad, especially when they can be crafted into a game as playable as this? R-Type III is smart, but not as spectacular as you would expect, and why no two-player option? ONWA0000 IIIIIIIII parallax is more layered than ever, and there's some fancy Mode 7 rotational stuff appearing on bosses and tunnel sections. Baddies also swarm out from clunks of scenery so there's a surprise element too. While unmistakably R-Type, there are some essential improvements to previous elements.

Sky Blazer is another typically Japanese 'hero' game, except this one crams in a drastic assortment of game styles SKY BLAZER SE00000 f the world was a peaceful place then half the world's games wouldn't have a plot. Now with Sky Blazer being set in the mystical era of the ancient gods, peace becomes something for which you have to battle with the evil forces of darkness for, and predictably save a princess in the process. Spiderman-like talent of sticking to any surface. There is also a mastery of flight to be experienced, but it's only available on just a couple of levels and even manages to ruin those moments with an awkward control system. That aside, what makes Blazer a respectable chap is his sheer range of spells, which amounts to some awesome magical weapons.

Punches and kicks occur in combinations. Just tap the keys a few times. Unexpected tale E Doom 900 00000 5 89 CSS VERDICT Despite the fact that it's only possible to have all your best weapons at the end of this game, the journey there is one of the most interesting platform battles around for the SNES. There's never too much of a single type of game style in here, be it flying or combat. You'll find plenty in Sky Blazer to surprise you, there's even a remake of the C64 classic Nebulus, complete with revolving tower. There are some hidden levels and the path through the game is a bit one dimensional, ending up with a rather short-lived game, but enjoyable with it. There are only a few flying stages in the game. These are quite fricky to play as you have to tap the keys quickly to stay in flight whilst avoiding getting trapped in the automatic scrolling screens. PAUL RAND "


"IIIIIIII MEGA-CD VERDICT Sky Blazer works because it has that I want to see what's next syndrome. There's an assortment of different playing styles which give the impression of excellent value for money. Unfortunately, it's all a bit easy and isn't as big as its map suggests. Some wild magical weapons impress, but never get used well because they are all geared to dealing with the bosses, and you can get by without them for most other baddies. What Sky Blazer offers is a refreshing game, full of new and old ideas which works where others haven't. This spectacular move sends streaks of lightning down parts of the screen, killing anything in its path. PROS: Plenty of variety and action. CONS: Lack of depth in gameplay DENIZ AHMET which require some drastic reflex adjustments, or negotiating a sandy waterfall where agility is crucial. There's only one route through though, and those hidden levels are perhaps too hidden. But Sky Blazer's smart graphics should distract you from its shortcomings. By turning into a phoenix you can fly to the end of a level if you're quick. GRAPHICS) Vivid and original, but some glitches in parallax and sprite collision. E>00000 The screen scrolls upwards too, so explore high places for collectables. ONNOS Mystical music, but silly attack sounds. Not very appropriate. This move freezes baddies, making them easy meat. ZOO TICKER GAMEPLAY Easy to get into, and rewarding with perseverance. Sky Blazer can summon his powers to dash across the screen killing all before him. This tower spins around as you jump and within the doors are sub-levels. I CAN DO MAGIC Possibly the most attractive feature of this game is the varied and well animated special powers. Unfortunately, you can't have all the powers shown here until towards the end of the game, because you are only awarded a new weapon after completing certain stages in the game. Lots of variety but it's a bit easy. Same each time you play This move causes Sky to spin around fast before launching multiple shots. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES IIIIIIIIIII This weapon is available from the start and once released will destroy all baddies in its path. This makes you invincible for a while so that you can run around destroying what you like. Enables you to stick to any surface you like vital for your survival. IMISSIDK HIT! D50000 86 This has the same effect as the blade except that it launches you across the screen. By pressing your L and R buttons you can decide which power to summon.

Nah, it'll never work JETSTRIKE There are over 40 different weapons systems to choose from, so this building probably doesn't stand much of a chance! PUDD! Original intro eh?! That's where the originality ends I'm afraid as there's one super cheesy plot about to unfold right infront of your eyes. Anyhow, SPUDD (Society of Particularly undesirable Dastardly Dudes) is a secret organisaand it's up to you as a top pilot to win the fight against evil. There are 100 missions to be played through, each with its own objective, such as destroying things or dropping spies behind enemy lines. An option to tion (well, would you tell anyone if you had a membership card?) made up of all the usual nutters, you know, arms dealers, dictators, that type of thing. With 100 missions to choose from air traffic control are having trouble keeping up with them all. train or fly practice runs is also available, as is an aerolympics where you complete the 'objective by gathering balloons and the like. The most novel aspect of the game is the control method. Your ship's direction is altered by moving up and down, while speed is changed by moving left and right. It's crap at first, and highly frustrating. Bear with it though, 'cos you'll soon find it to your liking. \"Is it a bird or a plane?\" Well i think you'll find that it's quite categorically a plane. Bored with the standard jets that usually turn up in these games? Not to worry, there's also a selection of helicopters for your amusement.

STRATEGY SKILL ACTION Weapon selection. Now do you just want to mildly chaff your enemy, or blow them to Kingdom Come? The choice is yours. REFLEXES 10 VERDICT Jetstrike is a fine example of how great graphics and sound do not a decent game make, because at the end of the day it's the gameplay. The control method takes a while to get used to and the fact that you start with only one life doesn't help, but it's definitely worth sticking with. Once you get into the game you'll be overcome with a warm glow of satisfaction in knowing that you bought this for the gameplay, and not a five minute graphical feast. With extra mission and update disks this should keep you busy for ages. JANUARY SALE Following on from Daze's excellent .99 price for Stardust, Alternative has clearly been blessed with a fit of generosity also. It hopes to get a series of extra mission disks and upgrades put on the front of Amiga magazines so thatupgrading won't cost you a penny (apart from the mag of course). And with a major prize based on reaching the Apocalypse sequence in the game, could we be seeing the beginning of caring, independent Nineties-spirited software houses. Group hugs all round, eh?

Although the game offers little new to the Gauntlet-style it emulates it perfectly and is great fun to play, thanks to its accurate difficulty curve and strategy-based shooting action.

SPECIALL SPA ou (and a friend if you want split-screen fans) are about to travel through eight magical worlds, which in turn are divided into 80 levels. Pick up the bonuses, grab the keys and potions, blat the baddies and make your way to the exit. The exit opens once all the keys on a level are collected. being a fan of Allister Brimble's music, but even they admit that Project X has one of the best pieces of game music ever. There's some crunching sound effects and realistic speech too. Indeed presentation is top rate and thankfully the gameplay is too. The original was way too tough, and this isn't easy, but the difficulty curve has been pitched just right. There's surprisingly few blasters on the humble Amiga and with Project X around anything new will have to be mighty special to topple it. the objective is to complete the level and collect as many collectables as possible before the time limit runs out. Woof Qwak is unusual in that it's just as much fun to play by yourself as it is with a friend. There's more than enough variety and new features on each level to sustain interest initially and over time. Neither the graphics or sound are particularly good, but they're cute enough and sustain the cheery atmosphere throughout the experience. A great little puzzler and a bargain at the price. Here's one of the guardians. OK he doesn't look tough but he moves like the clappers. Well tricky! hoot-'em-ups generally have duff plots. If it's not a mad dictator on the loose then some sort of mutant biological experiment has broken loose and hey, strange coincidence or what, but that's just what's happened in Project X. Moo Apart from your regular baddies there's also some nasties that fall from the sky should you activate a trap, and end-of-level guardians to contend with. Baddies are wasted by firing some of your limited supply of eggs at them. Additional help comes in the form of a challenge scene which crops up every so often.

This was ou're the assassin hired by allied security forces to try and end the reign of the villain Midan, who's lurking in his underground lair. Or put simply this is a Strider-inspired platformer set over 16 levels. Mr Motivator Sassy (the game's hero-type chap) is armed with a pulse-laser that's powered up by killing the bad guys. And smart bombs can be found by destroying containers or guardians. Around each level are gold stars. Collect 50 and a star-burst mega weapon is your reward, while collecting 99 will reward Sassy with an extra life. As is usual with platform games, Assassin is played against a strict time limit but instead of dying when the time's out, Sassy will lose bonuses and encounter harder baddies. Like Project X Special Edition, the difficulty level has been tweaked for more balanced and easier to get into gameplay. Graphics, sound and music are very polished and the animation on Assassin is quite something. Gameplay is solid but with only four backgrounds it can get boring.

"MEGA DRIVE by ACCLAIM MARCH RELEASEL .99 B38 VERDICT 10 SHUT There's a plethora of basketball games on the Mega Drive , which is surprising considering the sport isn't very big over here. That's not to say they're a bad thing, games like Dave Robinson's Basketball are very playable. However, NBA JAM doesn't aim to be realistic, just fun, so it doesn't matter if you know the first thing about the sport. The controls are simple, the action's a little too end-to-end at times, but despite that, this is a perfectly excellent conversion of the coin-op. RIK SKEWS BURNING BALLS When a player sinks three baskets in a row without the opposition scoring the ball, he's deemed to be 'on fire'. Basically this means that he has unlimited turbo power, and a better chance of scoring from virtually anywhere on the court, plus every time he touches the ball it bursts into flame. This only lasts until the opposition score, but in the mean time you can rack up a decent lead. The problem with basketball courts is that they're just too small. Here's a complete piccy (created at much time and expense) of the entire NBA Jam pitch. The sad little defender closest to the centre of the pitch appears to be dancing, when in fact this is his attempt at tackling the on-coming player. You can shoot from anywhere on the court, but obviously the closer you are to the hoop the better chance you have of scoring. It's always worth taking a long-shot when the clock is about to run out. BARELE TSFEC TORE 2 PARKLEY DIPPEN TILFBO 59: MEGA DRIVE: If you get in close to the hoop, chances are your player will perform a back-snapping reverse dunk. These are almost impossible for a defender to stop, but not particularly interesting to watch, so you'll probably end up using flashier and more risky moves.

Jam, in the basketball sense, is just like a slam-dunk, which in turn is simply putting the ball through the hoop. But any fool can do that, the real skill is making it look as flash as possible. Which is why, once the top players have got the boring business of winning the league out of the way, they get together for exhibition Jams to show just how good they really are. SNES ONWAUOVO IIIIIIIIII mm UIT Top players Taking part in this tournament are the two top players from each team in the league, except those already under contract for other games. These two-on-two encounters make for more action than five a-side games, and they are much faster, making the perfect recipe for a decent console basketball sim. There's hardly any difference in the graphics between the Mega Drive and SNES versions. Here we see the players being showered with razor sharp glass and not, as you might expect, being reduced to a bloody pulp. The SNES version looks slightly sharper than the Mega Drive game, but it doesn't make any difference to the overall gameplay, which, after all, is the main thing. MEGA DRIVE: If you've got particularly crap mates playing against you, there are several very poor teams included in the roster that you can choose to balance things out. On the other hand, you could always go for a scoring record and choose one of the top sides such as the Chicago Bulls (minus the now-retired Michael Jordan) or Charles Barkley's Phoenix Suns. 89 77 "


"REVIEWS least not while the ref is looking, any amount of off-the-ball fouling is allowed. In fact, the best way to get the ball from the opposition is to knock them over then grab it and run away before they get chance to hit back. Each player has his own strengths and weaknesses. Some are better at long shots, while some are only good for pushing their opponents off the ball. Obviously some teams are better than others, such as the Phoenix Suns who'll stomp on the Denver Nuggets, who deserve to be punished with a name like that. The rules have been altered for the exhibition game. Whereas you're not really allowed to shove your opponents in real baskets, at Turbo nutter basket Whatever the name of the game and new rules, the object is the same get the ball through the net at any cost, even if it means dispossessing your team mate because you think he's crap. Often the best tactic is to go it alone and dribble the length of the court before pulling off a dazzling dunk. The problem is, like in THE EASY LIFE Realising that not everyone is a game god, Acclaim has incorporated a useful 'fair-play' feature. If you fall too far behind as a result of your own crapness this mode kicks in, making your computer opponents slightly thicker and increasing the odds of the ball going through the net when you shoot. Of course, if you're really hard you'll go to the options screen and disable the feature, won't you? MEGA DRIVE NOW WE'RE JAMMING You want shots? Well NBA has the most outrageous arsenal of improbable, and down-right dangerous, shots to be found in any basketball game. Just take a look at these: SARILEY STURBO SNES: Pippen is 'on-fire' so his jams are almost unstoppable. HALFTIME REPORT 00:6 real basketball, you've got 30 seconds to a take a shot or pass the ball, and if the clock runs out possession goes to the other team. What separates these players from normal basketballteers is their built-in turbo charger. Whether this is down to SNES: A bit of digitised footage introduces the half-time scores and statistics. Anti-grav float: Defy gravity as your player leaps 15 feet into the air and glides slowly to the net, pushing the ball through the net to cap off this highly improbable move. EARILEY Anson PIPPEN EINING Super helicopter spin: Another highly improbable move where the player jumps so high he has to duck his head to stop cracking it on the roof, while spinning faster than Jimmy Hill's chin. This is the most unstoppable shot in the entire game, as your player's so high nobody can get close enough to dispossess him. The height he actually jumps to depends entirely on what his dunk skill rating is. If it's low he'll barely reach netheight, making him easy prey for alert defenders Rim Rocker: This is the most dubious move of the game because the player shoves the ball between his legs, jumps backwards towards the hoop and dumps it through for two points. It's a relatively easy shot to stop, but considering where the ball's been, who could blame a defender for not trying? This shot is normally only executed when you're close to the net, so if you're behind on points it's not worth risking. Instead run backwards, or pass, to avoid the defenders and take a shot from further out. 78 "


"SNES by ACCLAIM_MARCH RELEASEL_ .99 PRICE DAUGHTET MINER SEINALY PRESS URED VERDICT The SNES doesn't have many basketball games, which makes this NBA Jam all the more attractive, but it's streets ahead of any other basketball game, it's just not worth mentioning the competition. As a four-player game it's outstanding, there's nothing quite like seeing beaten enemies when the final buzzer goes. It's an excellent conversion of the arcade original, but more importantly it's just a good fun title which is packed with action, loaded with speed and immense fun to play. DENIZ AHMET PRICE SNES: All versions of the game feature the same rim-rocking moves. No matter how complicated they look, they're all executed in the same way. Get your player running with the ball while holding down the turbo button, and as soon as you get near the hoop hit 'Shoot'. Providing you've still got some turbo power left your player will launch into a death-defying dunk. Exactly what type of dunk that is depends entirely on how far away from the hoop he was when you hit 'Shoot'. For best results leap when you enter the red semi-circle. DRUGHERTY MINER SEIKALY START UREO E PRICE DAUGHERTY SEIRALY START MINER TDABO WAS GRAPHICS GO SOUND SNES: Players dribble the ball automatically when they run, but if you stop with the ball, attempt to take a shot and don't actually release it, your player isn't allowed to move, On the Mega Drive and SNES version the commentator calls out 'Tent Peg', while Game Gear owners get a bit of text at the top of the screen. All you can do in this situation is pass, shoot or be tackled. 99 PLAY VALUE SNES: Normally the best way to gain possession of the ball is to try and smack the person who is in possession of the ball. Fortunately there are few rules in this game and the occasional knee in groin goes unnoticed by the referee, except by the fact that the player is writhing in agony on the floor. All the players have a defence rating which determines how effective he is when it comes to shoving opponents, so you get some really bizarre situations where a short player spends the whole match terrorising someone who towers above him. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 UASHINGTON PORTLAND IST CURTEET NO-NW AUTO NO IIIIIIIII 2ESB BREAKING GLASS When you've been particularly greedy and raked up masses of points all by yourself, chances are that a powerful jam will shatter the glass backplate behind the net showering the players below with razor-sharp shards. This serves no purpose and the players don't get so much as a scratch, but it's a nice touch all the same. At least it shows you're doing well, allowing you to make insulting gestures at your mate. SNES: Tip-off for possession. the latest development from Nike or something funny someone slipped into their drinks, the result is the most improbable display of basketball skill ever. Hold down the appropriate button and your player will power SNES: Passing isn't that necessary in NBA Jam, as the best tactic is just to put your head down and run. But if you do want to stick to convention and pass the ball about a bit, you'd better be up against a weaker side, since passes are very easy to intercept, especially against turbo charged players. 88 79 "


"GAME GEAR by ACCLAIM_MARCH RELEASE .99 REVIEWS VERDICT While obviously not being able to match up to the 16-bit versions in graphics and sound, the Game Gear still comes out rosy when it comes to playability. All the moves are there, the same gameplay features, although there isn't a link mode which is a bit of a downer, since half the fun of the other versions is playing a pal. The court is a bit too brightly coloured when you compare it to some of the rather drab gear that the players wear, but otherwise this game is brill'. GARY LORD GAME GEAR: If you perform a particularly improbable dunk the audience reward it by taking loads of photos, probably blinding your player in the process. Three point shots are much trick. ier, because you have to take them outside the goal area. Because you can't dunk them, precision timing is called for when you shoot. along with extra speed, strength and shooting ability. This really takes it out of the players though, and they can only stay turbocharged for a limited time before they revert back to normal mode. A gauge at the top of the screen shows how much power you've got left, but as soon as you take your finger off the turbo button it soon recharges. Turbo also comes in handy when you're defender as it lets your player jump higher and stand a better chance of smacking his opponent off the ball. Using the turbo is a little tougher on the Game Gear version because it's activated by the Start button, which leads to finger-breaking combinations when you try to slam-dunk the ball with turbo held down. GAME GEAR: The graphics on the Game Gear version are large and well defined, including the ball. The players on some teams are a little hard to tell apart, even with a ruddy great arrow pointing to the head of the one you're controlling GRAPHICS ANNOS 80 8 3 NBA JAM GAME GEAR: Because of the small screen it's a little harder to time your tackles on the Game Gear version, which inevitably leads to higher scoring games. GAMEPLAY 8? STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 5 NBC JAMMIN' ON 16-BIT Fancy some real opposition in the courts? Well if you've got the Mega Drive or SNES version and a four-player adaptor you and three mates can thrash it out on the courts. That way when it all goes wrong and you have the pants thrashed off you, there's always someone else to blame. On the other hand, if you're a sad, lonely, no-friends-atall type, there are two ways to play the game. The first is in tag mode where you control the player with the ball. This can be a bit confusing, especially if you're big on passing the ball as you're basically trying to pass to yourself. The alternative is to play in arcade mode, where you control one player with the computer doing the additional leg work. Here you can make the computer player pass to you, or if you're feeling particularly generous even tell him to take a shot. HALFTIME REPORT! ONWANO IIIIIIIII GAME GEAR: Apart from the obvious graphic differences, the Game Gear version of NBA is identical to the 16-bit versions. At half-time you even get the same bit of digitised slam-dunk footage before you're bombarded with game statistics. GAME GEAR: Programming team Iguana have done a fine job of including all the 16-bit games' slam dunks in the Game Gear version. They're executed in exactly the same way, but the turbo button this time is Start, which is awkward since it's not that easy to hold down while pressing but tons I or II. It gets easier when you've had a few games, but it's always going to be a little awkward. 80 "

VERDICT O-NW AUTO Graftgold (Andrew Braybrook and Steve Turner in particular) has been responsible for some of my all-time favourite games so I can't understand why this has turned into a standard console platformer. Graphics are adequate, but some of the sprites can merge into the background making them difficult to see. However, the main problem is the frustrating control method, the lack of sensibly placed restart points and the fact it's quite boring and repetitive in places. Avoid.

The game looks fairly similar to the classic Amiga version, but unfortunately plays nothing like it. The chief complaint is the ridiculously unresponsive control method. CHORTO VILKEE PLAY Soccer Just like real life, team colours can be altered to avoid confusion, unless you're playing in black-and-white that is. Sensible Soccer's classic footy game scores an own goal on Sega's handheld CENE LEISTA HEM USIC BAD BUTTONS HD TERM GLASS IGLURS DIFFICULTU 1B Your first option should be to turn off the highly grating accompanying music. ow many times has CVG reviewed Sensible Soccer? Go on, guess. Well, for our less informed readers here's a clue: how many team members were there in The Fantastic Four? Yes, you guessed it (well actually I just told you, albeit cryptically I know), four. Count 'em: Amiga, SNES, Mega Drive and PC SO we'll not waste yours and our time telling you that this is the most addictive footie game ever to be released on a multitude of formats. Normally when a game gets converted to this many formats we'd think twice about giving it the full review treatment. After all, with most games nowadays you can be more or less certain of getting more or less the same conversion on differing formats, can't you? If you thought the graphics on the Amiga and console versions were small, wait until you see these miniatures. The ball shoots about so fast it'll take ages until you finally get it in the net. CHOOSE TERMS GRAPHICS INNOS It's all gone horribly wrong Not this time though. No siree, not on your nelly. This conversion smells like yesterday's nappies. Anyway let's leave the criticism for later. One thing that the Game Gear version has managed to retain though is Sensi's excellent game options. BD BD BDG MT14 SME CAT 11 GAMEPLAY There's a multitude of teams on offer, allowing you to play classic encounters like Torshavn against Vilnius! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT It's been a long time in coming, and I'm afraid there's going to be a lot of peeps peeved with Sony for somehow managing to foul up the best footie game of all time. There's so much wrong with this version of Sensible Soccer it's difficult to know where to start, but the mindblowingly unresponsive controls seems like as good a place as any. To be fair the Game Gear's joypad isn't designed for such intricate control but even so, after the sad graphics and sound are added this is definitely one to miss. All the favourite formations are here but the game plays so badly you'd be hard pushed to spot the tactical differences. Offside surely? There's lots of tactical formations to choose from to satisfy fans from Milan to Scunthorpe. You can't design your own sets though, which is a real shame, none of those groundbreaking 1-0-9 tactics here. Game length can also be set and the type of pitch that you wish to play your matches on. The key feature of Sensi, though, is the incredible control of the ball which the joypad enables. However, this feature is sadly neglected here which has resulted in big time disappointment I'm afraid. ONWAO TIIIIIIIII RIK SKEWS 84 "

Enter the caves to find a shop where you can buy powers. DINOBASHES rmed with a club which is actually not much bigger than his nose, this caveman game is a feast of predictable headbashing action. Very similar in may ways to Joe and Mac, Bignose toddles through plenty of prehistoric terrains set across four islands, clubbing no good creatures and avoiding pits and falls. Usual stuff. Bignose The Caveman wants you to enjoy this game. But is it rather snotty? The search for food is your quest for starters. 120 Them bones Among the fast scrolling platforms are rocks and bones. Rocks can be used in a bat-andball combination with your club and are best saved for the bosses. If you collect enough bones however, you can go shop for extra weaponry from a list including such powers as invincibility, light magic and even earthquakes. Unfortunately, to use these spells you have to activate a pop-up menu, which freezes the game while you make your choice, and so this takes away the action element which a power up is supposed to add. whole point of collecting super potent power-ups quite pointless. Dino Basher has a gentle difficulty curve which isn't going to frustrate you, but it doesn't quite cut it with the gameplay against the current competition GRAPHICS 50 ONNOS 8 .1. The graphics and difficulty improve with progress, but the gameplay is always the same. Bash 'em and run. Dino combat Sadly, the baddies are all rather simple and they are few and far between, which makes little in the way of demands on your combat skills. Things improve the deeper you progress, but there's always a distinct lack of variety and imagination in your opponents. Apart from the bosses, all are easily disposed of with your basic club which makes the 59 STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 VERDICT Bash boulders for rocks to bat at baddies with your club. Most people in the office who have managed to have a quick go with Dino Basher, found they soon got fed up after the first couple of levels because it starts off in such a predictable way and is so unimaginative. It livens up with progression however, and evolves into a fun little game suitable for younger players. The graphics are a bit boring for a platform game, and the power-ups disrupt the gameplay, yet the sprite handles well. Shame about those crap end-of-level bosses.

Philips prepare to amaze you with one of the most graphically incredible games ever! The sequel to the groundbreaking Dragon's Lair, Space Ace used pioneering laser disc technology to bring cartoon action into the interactive arena. Created by Don Bluth, the man behind the Steven Spielberg-produced animated movie An American Tail, Space Ace and its prequel were drawn by a team of animators whom Bluth poached from Disney, and that quality shone through. need a hero The plot behind Space Ace centred around the evil alien Borf, whose intention it was to take over the Earth using the dreaded Infanto Ray, a device which turned grown-ups into babies. Ace, defender of the world, went after Borf but Gories, 1395 etc G you get to see death secuerce/ just like this one. f you look back to the heady days of 1984, you may well remember that Frankie Goes To Hollywood were banned from Top Of The Pops for singing dodgy songs, Richard Burton starred in the movie version of George Orwell's 1984 (it's just a pity old George got it all wrong), and Liverpool FC probably won something.

What we want to know though, is whether or not Philips has any plans to release the original Dragon's Lair or, even better, the third in the trilogy, Super Don Quixote, which was streets ahead, gameplay wise, of either of its two cousins.

Two's company The player two option is going to be an important aspect of the game we've been told, since the idea is that interactivity will be increased by permitting a second player to fire Special Weapons and take charge of allocating the ship's power resources between shields, engines and weapons. Vocal commentary will keep you company throughout the game with genuine advice and there's even a Soulstar features some nice FMV clips which will play between stages depicting your next destination. promise of FMV sequences between missions.

Not the kind of thing you'd expect to find converted to a Mega Drive eh? In fact, we didn't think it possible when word first reached us, and it wouldn't have been if Sega hadn't triumphed with its new SVP chip (Sega Virtual Processor). This is the first game to use it, and boy can it shift those vectors! Good ole Sega Although the cost of the chip is going to bump up the price tag to a jaw dropping  or so, talk is that Sega is planning to shove the chip into a converter-type device so as future games which use the technology will cost no more than normal. Pat on the back for that Sega. Having previewed the game extensively, we can honestly say that almost every aspect of the coin-op has been converted.

Watch this space for the full review. EXTEHO TINE One of the imminent releases for Atari's Jaguar will be Chequered Flag II which is currently been coded by Rebellion Software (see page 24). It's the first racing game for the system, and is actually looking faster than Virtua. No need for special chips here, the 64-bit hardware provides plenty of punch for its higher resolution 16-bit images and smoother screen updates. Chequered Flag will feature similar viewing perspectives, 10 or more tracks, impressive transparent raindrops and an experiment track where you'll be able to do what you like. Rebellion's creative director Jason Kingsley describes the experiment track as 'acid-house driving' allowing you to race 'irresponsibly', ie in turbo without brakes and in thick fog! Swal 209 GEO It's actually easy to play from this perspective because you can see bends a lot earlier. Apparently, it's also easier to overtake the other cars.

Stage of Development 100% Complete You'll have to take large jumps to avoid those loose tiles. That red stuff is what's left of you in the snapping jaws. WERPES There's also some sword fighting moments in the game. If you're about to fall, it's possible to grab hold of a ledge. Games don't come with more gore than this, or more platforms. Yet another conversion looms for the prince of animation. tall order and you don't even know if you'll get a date out of it. TIL The path to the princess has many routes. The suspence will kill 'ya Pioneering the technique of 'human' animation, as seen in games like Flashback, Prince of Persia will be an entirely platform-based puzzle adventure. Each screen will present a puzzle hindering you from the next. Such puzzles however, will be stunts, for which you'll have to avoid loose floor slabs, climb, leap and hang from ledges, tip-toe past touch-sensitive hidden spikes, crawl under gates and even fight your reflection.

Surely (even Mega Drive owners) must have heard of the classic, slickly animated Prince of Persia by now. The SNES has been the best version so far, and this version looks more or less the same, minus some colour plus a conversion of the moody SNES audio tracks which leaves you going 'Hmmm'. The tale involves your quest to rescue the princess before the Persian Sultan takes her hand in marriage. Having been beaten and dumped into the palace dungeons, you must work your way up 20 odd levels to the tower that imprisons the one whose heart you're after; it's a Who turned out the lights? Discovering new dangers will be part of the game's appeal. The gnashing metal jaws for example will split your body in half with more blood than any other Mega Drive game around. You'll also deal with the Sultan's guards who gradually gain intelligence and will chase you. As you fight them with your sword you can even force them into traps set for you. Prince of Persia is going to be brilliant, and it's that simple. Don't waste time standing around the clock's ticking. 102 "

Choose one of these from the options screen. probably overrated the game at 58%! The game on CD-i looks to be a big improvement over its supposedly superior competitor, however. Ride 'em cowboy Running under the control of the Digital Video cartridge, it's a graphic treat with fluid frame update that doesn't jerk like it does on 3DO. Disc access when pulling off anims is a little laboured, but that could change as we only saw a pre-production gold disc (that said, with 2Mb of memory available there's no reason why the anims can't be stored in RAM for instant access). Putting the limited nature of these games to one side (if Op Wolf-style games are your bag, you'll like it; if not, you won't) the only major gripe with CD-i Mad Dog is controlling the gunsight with the remote controller is almost as bad as the 3DO's pad; however, Philips assures us they're going to produce a light gun to go with the game.

I read it and thought what Philip Owen wrote was absolutely correct. Me and my mate own Amigas and we spend far more time on our computers than we possibly could a SNES. Don't get me wrong, consoles are good and I like them, but they just don't have any flair so to speak. There are some good points, though, such as good platform games and graphics and being able to have CD addons. But the Amiga and PC can produce games such as Indy I Fate Of Atlantis and so on.

Now I've called my local computershop and they don't know. Do you know when Microcosm, Inferno and TFX will come out in Belgium? 2. Do you think X-Wing will come out on the Amiga? 3. Which is better: TFX or Inferno? 4. Do you think the CD32 is gonna be a real monster hit? This was my last question. I really thank you for reading my letter. Frank Thoelen Hoeselt, Belgium Pro YOB: 1. I've got no idea and even less interest. 2. Not a chance. 3. They're the same game, you Belgian baboon. 4. Depends. If Commodore does get its act together and actually release a CD add-on for the A1200 (turning it into a CD32) and a keyboard for the CD machine, it might just work. What happens is this: if enough people own compatible kit the software companies will release more and better games for the machine(s). Then more people will buy them for the games and more and better games will be written, and so on. On its own the CD32 won't have enoug.. fans to prove a 'monster hit' but if Commodore manages to hit both console and computer owners at the same time there will be one hell of a lot of people out there owning Commodore machines. The big problem now, though, is the competition: with the likes of the 64-bit Jaguar already out at less than , Sega's Saturn and Nintendo's Project Reality both on the way, it's hard to see CD32 really cutting the mustard. For a change I'm going to reserve judgement on this one, since I'm quite a fan of the Commodore machines and hope they do well. Some of the greatest games of all time were written on Amiga (Captive, Stunt Car Racer, Formula One, Damocles and Hunter to name just a few), but if you want my opinion it's about time Commodore released a ground-breaking new computer with as much impact as the Amiga had when the machine was launched. The Amiga was light years ahead of its time, and if Commodore can pull that off again it will be sitting pretty for another decade. 108 "


"NOEL EDMONDS IS ONE SAD MOTHER... WHY DO ALL THE WEIRDOS WRITE TO ME? Dear YOB, I sent you a letter last month but you didn't print it. If you don't print this one! will come round your house with a stick of dynamite and shove it right up your bum and light it. 1. What console or computer do you have? 2. What is the best Mega Drive pack to buy? 3. Is Rocket Knight Adventure worth buying? 4. What do you think of Toejam And Earl 2? 5. That 100 quid is mine. What do you think? Joe McQuillan Dunblane, Scotland PS Are you Mr Blobby? YOB: I'm happy to announce that this letter is something of a classic. I'd suggest that everyone cut out and keep it for reflection on those uninspired days when nothing good is happening and you're in need of a bloody good laugh. Stewart has actually deluged CVG with letters over the past few months which are all similar to this. Here's a choice selection of his edited highlights, proudly presented for your amusement: YOB: 1. All of them except the Amstrad GX 4000 because it's the biggest electronic turd ever devised. 2. Streetfighter Special Champion Edition. 3. Yep. 4. Personally I think it's a bit cacky, but lots of sad types reckon its pretty good. 5. It's no good nurse, I can't find the brain. Quick, take out the endoscope before he does himself any permanent damage... PS Yobby, Yobby, Yobby! Dear YOB, I am writing to tell you that your magazine is brilliant, excellent and perfect in every way. It gives you everything, from a variety of previews, competitions, news, CheatMode, Arcade Action, your very own Mailbag and many more sections to read and enjoy. The magazine is far better than any other in the universe, and I am very proud to own and read a publication of such quantity and quality. Tam a careful observer of magazines and I recommend this one to anyone who feels that good magazines create warmth and power in people's hearts. To some people reading computer magazines is their life, and they absorb every bit of information blasted at them. People have different opinions about the quality of the magazine, and expect people find this amazing magazine useful to computer owners. Not only that, but they would find it interesting and exciting. If I saw it for the first time then I would pick up the magazine and throw my eyes down at the pages and take in as much computer knowledge as I have and store the information in my head. This would create conversation during computer language. As I have expressed, I am very interested in magazines indeed and I am very interested to hear what people have to say about them. People would ask me if I read the review on Sonic The Hedgehog II and I would say: \"No, why?» They would then say: \"Because there was a very interesting comment about it.\" Most people think magazines are just pieces of paper thrown together. Well, I can assure you that the magazine has been written carefully and read thoroughly to produce such a magazine. I would of thought that CVG was the best, but people think otherwise. I don't agree, because the magazine is well known and is well produced and written. I would certainly buy it if there were plenty of other magazines to choose from. I am thinking of being a jurnalist (sic) when I grow up, so please print this letter so that I can show it to the interviewers. I'm sure they would be very interested to read it. (I wouldn't count on that YOB). If I become a jurnalist then I could write an article on the greatest magazine ever: CVG. And print it on the best paper. Yours Jurnolisticly Stewart Green Lancashire SWEDE AND CARROTS Dear YOB I'm writing to complain about your magazine. For example in issue 144 GO! was part of CVG and not a very good isea because, now the section which GO! used to a separate magazine has less information on handhelds than ever. Take for example (CENSORED ON THE GROUNDS OF BEING ENDLESS DRIVEL ON THE SAME SUBJECT YOB). Anyway, the real reason I wrote was to ask some questions and here they are: 1. I know you told us what happened to Garth, but you never told us what happened to the rest of the team. 2. Why are the following sections of the magazine no longer in the magazine: What's Your Problem?, Celebrity Challenge and Question Corner? 3. Lastly, how can I get a subscription for CVG? The One And Only Me (Oscar Molina) Stockholm, Sweden YOB: 1. Anglin sank to obscurity in television, Jon sank to obscurity in Bath, Tim was murdered by Paul Rand, Julian has gone to America, Jenny is now an international winter wear model and undercover agent for the Swiss government and Gary is a sad man. 2. What's Your Problem was axed when I put an axe through the head of the bloke who was writing it. Celebrity Challenge was dropped after I accidentally killed one of the celebrities thinking he was from EastEnders. Question Corner was axed because Paul Anglin used to do it but moaned about it, left and sank to obscurity in television. 3. Don't bother. We don't want readers like you. What did Sweden do in the war, exactly? 109 "

"I WRITE POEMS, ME PRESS How To GCT A Dear YOB, Why do people always ask such crappie questions in this -agazine? I mean, of course there's a release date... It's out now, you demented wheelchair with no wheels! The list could go on for years, and I could cause great upset to you all. I would just like to say how unique I am on consoles, so that basically leaves me as a supreme star... I'm not boasting or anything, but no-one can pick up the joypad because they see the frightening terror in my eyes... Print this letter to create jealousy. You see it all started last week when my dog was run over by a steamroller. Suck, suck, CVG is best! Here is a poem I have so cleverly written: I had a bit of cash to spare And overcome with joy I went along to Rumbelows And bought myself a toy. JOB C+VG VOL MIND LESS GROVEC THE AMBROSIA KID Dear YOB, How do you do? I get this mag every month and I think it's So good leven start to dribble at the thought of buying it Answer these questions or I will come to your house, tie you up and attempt to shave off your eyebrows and nasal hair blindfolded with my chainsaw. Get it? 1. One of my mates reckons that in America Blanka's first name is Jemima and that he's a girl. Is this true? 2. Will there be a version of Super SFll on the Megadrive? 3. Does YOB stand for: a) You Old Bugger? b) Yellow Old Bumhole? c) Yodelling On The Bog? 4. Why do people all over the country think that everyone in Devon lives on farms, drives tractors and eats a certain brand of creamy rice pudding? Tell me that! Thank you. Ben Baillie Exmouth, Devon PS I expect that  within a month or your eyebrows will go down the toilet. I used to have a Spectrum But I flushed it down the bog 'Cos now I've got Mario, And that game is just a dog. How I loved that little game I played it every day But after I had finished it The thrills all went away With no more hidden levels And Bowser being no more All I've got is Mario And he's becoming quite a bore. There's the European Championship And tennis on the telly And CVG said Mean Machines Was boring, crap and smelly. YOB: 1. Your mate is a pratt. 2. Yep. Together with the Super NES version, it'll be out in June. 3. None of them. Any more guesses? Whoever gets it right wins a game. 4. Because that's exactly what they do when they're not just standing there with their fingers up their backsides trying to work out which way the wind is blowing. I don't fancy R-Type much The scrolling's far too slow So all I've got is Mario And that guy has to go. (I HAM 2 MORE PERT S THAN YOU. Stewart Green Holme, Lancashire EENGLISH PEEG! YOB: It's so effortless. How does he do it? Nothing! could possibly add would say more about Stewart than he has himself. Unless any of you lot would like to add a thing or two... NARKY SPANIARD IN I'M JUST SAD AND SPANISH Dear YOB, It's for me outrageous the answer you took to the Spanish kids that write to this section (\"...because you are Spanish after all»), («Spanish geek»), («when his sad homeland of Spain is transformed into somewhere worthwhile\"). As I see you have a totally wrong sight of that Spain is: for your information, Spain has an enviable history and culture. Maybe this word doesn't sounds to you, but the Spanish CULTURE is one of the world's most importants. I don't understand why you say that to be Spanish is bashful: maybe 'cos we know how to have fun and be happy? Maybe 'cos we like the binge and we know how to enioy the life? Maybe because we are pert and our womans are the world's prettiest? Maybe 'cos we aren't a boired repellent islands? Maybe 'cos we are more man than you? You are very brave behind your name 'YOB', but I can assure you that if you find any Spanish who knows the way you have speaked 'bout us, he'll hit you so strongly that you never won't speak another time this way 'bout Spain and Spanish people. OK? Iker Mendoza Capella Barcelona, Spain THE AREA. YOB: Whoops, sorry. My mistake. Why don't we all move to Spain and live excellent lives? "


"SPOILT OZZIE BRAT *%^&@*\"!?! Dear YOB, My mum reckons you're a right *%^&$ $%*. What does this mean and is she right? Can I have the ? David Watson Farnham, Hants YOB: Yes she is and no you &*%$@% &^%$ can't. Dear YOB, I am currently at boarding school trying to do my science prep but I'm sick of it, so I thought I'd write a letter to you explaining how | wish I was back home playing my Mega Drive. I don't know whether to be annoyed with my parents. I had my heart set on a Mega-CD for my birthday, so what do I get? A car. The good thing is that it's very good because it was made in England and is one of the old Triumph TR6s and they are pretty rare here in Oz so I suppose it was all right. Anyway, here are my questions: 1. Do you know if there are any more SNK games coming out on Mega Drive such as Burning Fight and Crossed Swords? 2. Is Streets Of Rage 3 definitely coming out? If so, when? 3. Will this be a 24-meg cart? 4. Will Final Fight 2 come out on Mega CD? 5. Will Fatal Fury 2 have a bigger sized cart than No 1? Bye for now Julian Landy Victoria, Australia WELL, I MAY YOB: Tell you what, send over your car and I'll send back my Smegga CD by return of post. Seeing as you're Australian, you'll probably do it as well. Anyway, you might be a spoilt little waster but your questions were mildly interesting so AS WELL OPEN MY here are a few LAST PRESSY. HOPE YTS answers: SOMETHING I TRULY 1. There may indeed be DESERVE. more Neo Geo conversions, but I don't think either Burning Fight or Crossed Swords will make it. 2. What do you think? After the phenomenal success of the first two games, is Sega going to say: \"Oh, sod it.\" and not bother? There's been no official (or unofficial) word, though. 3. How the hell should I know?  4. Seeing as the Super NES version was a diabolic travesty and sheer waste of perfectly good electricity, I sincerely hope not. 5. Yep. READ THIS IT'S ABOUT STREETFIGHTER Dear YOB, I am writing to you about that fave of your letters page Super Streetfighter. BUT WAIT! Before you screw this up and throw it in the bin, it's not what you think, because what I want to say is that I am becoming increasingly annoyed about the way software companies think they can chuck a couple of extras on to a cart and throw it on the shelves for . This has happened on a number of formats with games like the NHLPA hockey series and the John Madden m g ames. The game becoming infamous 77 for this, though, seems to be Streetfighter II. I bought SFIl last year with my SNES, as did many others. But then Capcom and Nintendo released Streetfighter Turbo. Why? OK, so you got a couple of nifty new moves and four extra characters and that would be fine, but immediately after SF2 has sold plenty they announce that Super Streetfighter is to be released in 1994. Who do they think we are? After all, next summer or whenever the game is released, how many SNES owners will be without either SF2 or SF Turbo? Very few, 1 think. And then everyone will realise they once paid  for a game that just isn't the best any more. Maybe Nintendo and Capcom should think twice before releasing Super Streetfighter on to the SNES. After all, how long will it be before Super Streetfighter Turbo Championship Blackbelt Edition is released? Next Christmas maybe? Will Nintendo ever reach the end? Tim Nosurname Mansfield, Notts BIRTHDAY JULIAN NH (MAMBO Onu RUSSLE! THE IRISH QUESTION (S) Dear YOB I just want some info, so please answer my questions. 1. When will the Amiga CD32 be out in Ireland? 2. How much will it cost? 3. My friends said Mortal Kombat is being made for it. Is this true? 4. How much will the games cost for it? Sorry about the writing. Neil McAllister Co Dublin, Ireland. YOB: Actually, I think you've got a point proved by the fact that I can reveal that Capcom is planning, wait for it, Turbo Super Streetfighter in the arcades! No, this is not a wind-up it is planning to release a version of Super Streetfighter running at Turbo speed. I ask you: is this really necessary? Like everyone else I am starting to wonder where it's all going to go, and nowadays there's some really decent competition out there. If you want my opinion, Samurai Shodown on the Neo Geo is as good as, if not better than, Super Streetfighter. It's got about a billion hidden features and special moves, tons of blood, absolutely brilliant graphics and razor sharp gameplay. It's time Capcom put its thinking cap on, because Streetfighter III is going to have to be really, and I mean REALLY, good to stay ahead of the competition. What do you lot think? Write in and tell me! YOB: 1. Q: How do you confuse an Irishman? A: Put him in a room with two shovels and hit him over the head with both of them. 2. Q: What do you call an Irishman with half a brain? A: A stupid bloody paddy. 3. Q: How many Irishmen does it take to change a lightbulb? A: Not enough to stop me kicking the cack out of them. 4. Q: How does an Irishman remember to take his trousers down before having a crap? A: Beats me. BEST LETTER Dear YOB, You'll probably not print this letter and if you do you'll probably call me a monkey nut-sucking idiot, but (CENSORED ON THE GROUNDS IT CONTAINED MUCH MONKEY NUT-SUCKING IDIOCY YOB)Keep up the good work. YOB: How refreshing. A letter which answers itself. 112 "


"I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, ME SENSIBILITY IS GOOD FOR YOU Dear YOB, Could you answer these quezzies for me? Dear YOB, I just wanted to tip you off about a new game coming out in December. As my dad works for Nintendo, I should know. It's called 'Sonic Spinball', and the idea is simple; you are Sonic and you are a ball being flicked around the screen. Unfortunately it's on the VIC 20. 1. Do you think I should buy the Jaguar 64-bit console or CD-i? 2 What games have been released for the Jaguar 64-bit console? 3. Will Streetfighter II and Mortal Kombat ever be released on the 64-bit Jaguar and CD-i? 4. Will 3DO prices cut down to  or will it stay at ? 5. What do you think of the Saturn games console? 6. How much will the Sony PS-X cost? 7. How much do games cost roughly for the Jaguar 64bit console? MR BLOBBY Crinkley Bottom PS If this isn't in the magazine I'll castrate you with a blunt chainsaw, you rectum-faced pygmy, you see if I don't AMIT GULRAJANI iford, Essex GOOD POINT, POOR PROSE PS Please, please, please print this letter or I shall personally rip your spine out. YOB: 1. I think you should make your own mind up, instead of relying on me to live your life for you. 2. Currently, Cybermorph and Crescent Galaxy are available for the machine. 3. Hopefully, once the two machines make a big enough impact, but there are no details at the moment. 4. Let's hope so, because face it, nobody's going to fork out  for the system when there are so many good new machines available for far less money. 5. What do you think of Saturn the fifth planet in the solar system? 6. I've heard a price of around  mooted. 7. Roughly, around forty sovs. Dear YOB, I have been reading this magazine for a long time and the people never change; they always ask 'can you answer my queries or these questions', like in issue 146 on page 144, when he asked about the CD-i (information) and there was supplement in the issue before. Why doesn't CVG print a YOB question page and ask questions like When will the colour Game Boy come out in this country and how much will it cost?' or to praise you and your colleagues for the magazine's review and sarcastic comments on peoples' letters like mine. YOB: I just wanted to tip you off about some men coming round to your house in a few days time. As my dad works for Rampton high security mental institute, I should know. They're called 'The Men In White Coats', and the idea is simple; you are a sad lunatic and you are about to be carted off to a small cell with padded white walls. Unfortunately I won't be there to see it. RICHARD CURTIS Sutton, Shropshire YOB: Poorly constructed letter maybe, but the questions page is a good idea. I'll put it to the boys.
