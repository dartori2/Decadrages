"INNOVATIVE TRS 80-GENIE SOFTWARE from the professionals JUMBO Fantastic new flying simulation Occasionally a program comes along of such magnitude that it is hard to describe it, especially within the space allowable in an advertisement Jumbo is such a program. There have, of course, been flying simulation programs before, but they have all rather fallen into the trap of trying to produce a graphic representation of the ground at some stage or other in the program, thus taking up space, and/or they have concentrated on the single act of flying in other words, although one gets the feeling of flying a small aircraft, one is not going anywhere. Jumbo is a fantastically accurate simulation of flying a Boeing 747. These planes are not small, and are not flown by eye. They are flown by eyes and instruments, and the instrument graphics in this simulation are really first class. As you may know, the primary instrument of an aircraft is the artificial horizon. This is simulated very well, and includes instrument landing approach indicators Graphic maps of very high quality are produced and it is possible to fly in all of the British Isles including Southern Ireland, and to New York on the Eastern U.S. seaboard. The actual airports are at London, Birmingham, Manchester. Prestwick, Edinburgh, Belfast, Shannon and New York The program was written by two authors who combined their joint skills to produce a unique piece of software. The programmer got the last byte of performance out of the machine and the pilot the last drop of authenticity out of the simulation. Other simulation programs produce at best a similarity towards flying. With Jumbo you really feel that you are behind the controls The authors have used a number of gimmicks and programming techniques. For instance, it is possible to switch on an automatic pilot and to jump forward in time in increments of one minute or one hour otherwise of course a flight from London to New York or vice versa would take some 8 hours to simulate. Whilst in this time skip the various controls are left as they are but fuel consumption and distance to go are taken forward at their correct rate A chart is supplied containing various items of data which you will need, including the take-off data for a 747 with various take-off weights, flap retractions, climb and cruise speeds and descent distances Realising that not everybody can fly a 747 and that there is even a large proportion of the population that cannot fly anything, two important items of assistance have been added. First of all is the documentation. This is split into two parts. The second is a manual on flying the 747. In other words, the instructions for running the program. The first part, however, is what amounts to an instruction manual for flying. It assumes that the user knows nothing about aircraft and although we do not purport that it gets anybody up to any sort of standard after it has been assimilated, the reader should have sufficient knowledge of flying and the theory of flight to fly in the program itself. The second feature of assistance to the novice pilot is a feature in the program which enables the user to practice landings. When the program is started, if one presses the p key, the aircraft is automatically put 11 miles out from London Airport approaching on an instrument landing The controls are pretty well complete, even to dive and wheel brakes. The flying track may be continuously monitored on the map display. Bearing and distance to your intended point of landing are available all the time. The instruments, incidentally, consist of Artificial horizon Attitude Fuel Aileron indicators Compass Elapsed time Indicated airspeed Turn indicator Distance to landing Power setting Flap indicator Rate of climb Elevators Altimeter Six maps may be chosen, as follows: Scotland, Northern England, Southern England, Ireland, Eastern U.S.A., The whole of the U.K. Route information and present position are shown on the map displayed. It is very difficult to think of any factor that the authors have overlooked. Even the quite meaningful thinning of the air with increasing height, which greatly affects the airspeed indicator in real life, is taken into consideration. Rather than having a fixed stalling speed, this continuously changes with the flight configuration, the weight, height and power setting again as it does in real life. We like to think that we publish good programs. Jumbo is outstanding. It is available on tape or disk for 16K or 32K memory machines. It is compatible with the Modell and Model III Tandy.

"THE \"STARWARS OF THE 80's\" LAST CHANCE TO TAKE IN PARIS Tron lives inside a mainframe computer. He is referred to as a 107 \"Program\" and he fights for the \"users\". He has also given his name to the Walt Disney film which is set inside a huge games computer. The film has just opened to rave reviews in the U.S. and will be in London's Odeon Leicester Square Cinema from October 21. The film is unique in combining real actors, animation and some superb computer graphics and has been tipped as the \"Star Wars of the 80's\" by those privileged enough to have seen it. Our September issue gives two pages and the front cover over to this marvellously imaginative film, which is quite different from the usual Disney offerings. We look behind the scenes at the graphics men behind the film, a review of the film itself and a rundown on the huge boost it is already giving to the video games and computer games industry, both here and in America. This could be your very last chance to go to Paris at our expense. If you have a game for any machine which you think we ought to publish, then we want to hear from you. Come October, Computer & Video Games will be a year old and the writer of the best game to be published in the magazine in that first year will be treated to an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris with any friend he (or she) may care to take along. We already have some idea of the games we most enjoyed trying out in the office and those reviewers who have tested games have also given us some forthright opinions on their favourites. But the perfect computer game still has to be written and the judges will wait until the last moment before pronouncing on the selection. However, we would also like you readers to have a say in the result. So if there is a C&VG game which stands out in your mind as giving the most hours of fun, please write in and let us know. We want to know the name of the game and why you gave it your vote. After all it's your magazine so it's important that your opinions influence the result. Write to: the editor, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8, Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JB. DEFENDER IN ONE \"K\" NEXT WHAT'S THE ANTIMATTER?

And as usual comes up with a listing to illustrate his points. Have you ever dreamt up your perfect computer game but felt that the programming skills necessary to convert it to your computer were beyond you? Next month we are offering the perfect solution. In conjunction with Sinclair Research and Psion Computers, we are challenging readers to come up with an original idea for a computer game.

"NCOMPETITION COMP WIN A BALLY PINTABLE It is this kind of completely fresh outlook on a game that Bally hope the winner of this competition will produce. It can be a single feature on a game or a whole new concept ... but it has to be practical, so bear in mind the following criteria: Physical dimensions. That the game is capable of Bally's marvellous Electra pintable takes pinball just about as far as it can currently go. Pinball fanatics will know it as the three level pintable which adds a mini-playfield to the excitement of a two tier game. This pinball machine will go to the home of the lucky winner of our pinball competition. And the winner could even find his ideas incorporated in a future Bally pinball design. So how do you win an Electra pintable for your own living room, bedroom or hallway? Simply by being original. We want you to come up with an idea for a feature on a pintable or any other arcade game which you think would greatly enhance its playability. Or you could come up with a completely new machine. You'll have to go some to match the current crop of pinball designers, who have introduced some pretty impressive features lately. The Electra itself is a good example of many of these and we have gone into some of these, below. But among the many innovations, currently pulling people into the arcades are: drop targets, playfields on more than one level, captive balls, pinballs that talk back to you or the Vector's machine's flip-ometer Pinballs have also found a new direction recently. The Williams' Hyperball and Bally's Rapid Fire (reviewed on page 27) have given a new twist to the pintable by turning them away from the usual keep-theball-in-play strategy, to a firing game, shooting balls at lit targets. being mass-produced. Cost. Weight That it is safe to be used by the arcade player. The idea must not be stolen from any other arcade or pinball machine. And most important, it should be creative and original. The Bally Pinball Division will present an Electra pinball machine to the grand prize winner. All entries will be judged by the Bally Pinball Division's new product board and announced in Computer & Video Games. All entries will be the property of the Bally Pinball Division and the entrants will assign all rights, patents and privileges of their design to the Bally Pinball Division No employees of Bally or Computer & Video Games or their relatives may enter the competition. The judges decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into. Send your entries to The Pinball Competition, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR 5JB before September 16th 1982. More features than Cosmopolitan, is one way you could bill the Electra pintable. For pinball buffs, we'll just outline a few of these. The first difference you will notice is the split-level playfield, which has two upper tiers and a central miniplayfield. On the upper level you'll find stand-up targets, rollover buttons and a saucer arrow which will release another captured ball. Drop targets and a stationary target combine to produce a boot-a-ball multiplier. Passage to the third, mini, playfields is achieved by collecting Electra time units on the upper levels. Each sequence of hit targets leads you into new possibilities. Now take a deep breath and vow never again to refer to any arcade machine as: \"Just another pintable\".

"WORLD SHOCK There was really only one way to put our June issue's World Cup Manager game to the test. And that was to get a national squad manager to play it. So we invited England's manager Ron Greenwood to test out his soccer skills against the computer. Ron graciously accepted the challenge and just before the England squad flew out to Spain, Sharp sent three computers (complete with the game) down to the squad's football headquarters at a Hertfordshire hotel Several other members of the squad also tried their hand at the game with Steve Coppell and Kenny Sansom being the notable successes. Between them they guided a rather strange England line-up through the first round and with Kenny in charge the team narrowly failed to qualify for the semi-finals on goal difference. Ron fared rather less well. With a team that consisted of: Corrigan, Mills, Foster, Sansom, Wilkins, McDermott, Coppell, Keegan, Mariner, Woodcock and Rix, Ron took on Hungary in the first game of his tournament C&VG's editorial assistant, Susan Cameron, helped Ron to key-in the opposition names and choose his tactics. And the result? England lost 7-0! Well we never said the game was easy .. But he ran into a few tactical problems, like being forced to bring on substitute Peter Shilton, in the attack after a disappointing first half showing, in which the Hungarians claimed most of the midfield and stamped their authority on the game early Confessions a Bug Machine code! What on neutral gave the editor the impression he could sneak that past us? The Bug hasn't been born who can't put a spanner in the works of a machine code listing. Snag Junior got to grips in line 1 which has a real question mark over it. Unfortunately author Pat Norris, soon spotted the problem and came up with a subroutine which makes data entry into that first line much easier. First of all replace line 1 with 45 fullstops. 1 REM (45 full stops) Next type in the following short routine: 3000 FOR A=16514 to 16553 3010 INPUT B 3015 POKE A,B 3020 NEXT A 3025 STOP After this short program has been typed, type in GOTO 3000. The cursor will appear, awaiting input. Put in the following data: 33,215,64,17,43,117,35,126,167,254, 118,32,7,35,35,35,35,35,24,242,254, 23,32,1,201,214,28,135, 135, 135, 135, 35,134,214,28,18,19,35,24,223. After the data has been entered, delete lines 3000 to 3025. One other point is that the asterisks in line 65 are two multiplication signs and NOT a power sign. Also a piece of rogue paper obliterated a part of Pontoon during the printing process-ably abetted by T. Hitch. Line 133 suffered as a result: 133 IF V=2 AND A=21 THEN PRINT \"YOU HAVE BLACKJACK\" is the correct version. Moonshuttle was left to Screaming Foul-up but he couldn't do much with it (he's not been well recently). But the printed version was for use with the keyboard rather than a joystick. The J in line should be changed to 37137 if you wish to use joysticks to play the game. Bye for now. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 13 "

"This program is based on those plastic puzzles which consist of 15 numbered plastic tiles which have to be arranged in ascending order of value. In the program the numbers are replaced by shapes which when positioned in correct order make a picture of a sail boat. This picture is displayed at the start of the program before the computer scrambles it. Your task is to unscramble the bits and complete the picture in as few moves as possible. To do this you move pieces into the space marked with a cross. If the section you want to move is above the space you must press M the down key. Other keys used are U-up, H-left and K-right. There are five skill levels to the game. After you have become familiar with the method of moving the pieces you should be able to advance to higher levels which scramble the picture even more.

"HAUNTED HOUSE Listen to the children of the night how sweet they sound. Their howls and moans echo through the gloomy corridors of the Haunted House. Once within the rambling edifice you will be confronted by many unknown horrors. There are several rooms to explore and dangers to cope with but you must escape. Otherwise you could be joining the inhabitants of this gothic mansion before long! Once the door locks behind you there is only one way out-but telling you more would spoil our macabre entertainment. Useful words to use are; Go, Take, Leave, Use, Exorcise, North, South, East, West, Up, Down. Statements 10-600 set up the arrays describing the rooms and their contents. 600-700 ties the subroutines together. 1000 handles the keyboard entry. 2000 lists what you are carrying. 3000 decodes verbs and generates the associated messages. The author reckons the strength of his program lies in its flexibility. Any room names, object names and room contents can be changed simply by altering the statements assigning the string contents. The vocabulary will alter accordingly. The interaction between the room contents can similarly be altered and does not depend on the names contained in the arrays. Thus the body of the program can handle any number of rooms, with any interconnection, without alteration. OLIS A on RUNS ON AN ACORN ATOM IN 12K BY ALEC PEARSON "

"AKOUT Here's a knock-out game for all you BBC micro owners. There's a pretty red and yellow wall at the top of the screen which Mr Hurd invites you to lay waste in the traditional time honoured fashion. Using a bat moved from side to side by the X and Z keys. There's a supply of three balls served by the space bar. The ball speeds up when it hits a red brick and leaves the bat at a somewhat random angle, defying the laws of physics in a carefree manner. Once a complete wall has been demolished a new allowing seasoned veterans of the one appears game to build up impressive totals on the high score display. You can make a couple of alterations to the program if you wish. The sound effects can be improved by changing the final parameter on each SOUND call to 5. For more advanced BBC owners a further improvement could be made by using the FX commands to change the responsiveness of the keyboard.

"BY ROSS FULFORD RUNS ON A TRS-80 LEVEL II IN 16K HOPPER You could really get caught on the hop in this original graphics packed extravaganza. Space Hopper has five different stages to test your skill and dexterity. In stage one you have to leap your Hopper over buildings as they move past. You earn 10 points for each leap -and as the game progresses the gaps get smaller. Stage two sees the appearance of a dragon type monster in the top left hand corner of the screen. This monster grows bigger as you attempt to bounce your Hopper into flying bricks which flit across the screen at random heights. Then comes stage three which sees the monster start to move across the screen. You have to land your Hopper on the monster to win points. Stage four and a spaceship appears. You have to guide the Hopper into the landing bay. You get 500 points for a successful docking but take care as there's not much room for error and there is a time limit. Three other space hoppers appear for the final stage and you have to guide your Hopper onto one of its bouncing chums. You receive 300 points for a perfect landing.

IT111 Galactic FIREBIRD Those ever circling, swooping, diving Firebirds of the famous arcade machines, brought to the micro in Mike Chalk's ultimate achievement--Galactic Firebird Yes, it's the latest in the Kansas Arcade series, but alas, his last, for Mike has been writing these right back from the original Arcade Invaders, and feels he wants a rest. The reason being that he has always bettered his preceeding program, and feels that with Firebird he has reached a pinnacle. Many programmers of many machines have tried to emulate the arcade game, Firebird, but nobody, the Americans included, have managed to For TANDY TRS -80 & VIDEO GENIE get the circling, swooping firebirds on a computer. Until now! It is incredible how the Firebirds peel away, circle around in numerous positions on the screen, then suddenly sweep in to attack, all the while raining down their bombs. Even if you manage to dodge all their bombs whilst shooting them down, it is as though they realise they will not get you this way, for without warning they'll take kamikazi action and come straight for you! Then come the Astro Blasters, shooting down a solid energy bolt, to fry you completely, in adition to their own brand of super bomb. Oh, you can fire at them, but a solitary hit will have no effect whatsoever on these nasties. As though Firebirds and Astro Blasters are not enough, as the game progresses, come the Megon Bombs. With no less than three hits needed to destruct. And you can't dodge them easily either, as their explosions spread. Scores are kept of course, and there is the now expected realistic sound effects. And wait for it--it progresses to FOURTEEN levels of difficulty! Mike's last words:\"Nobody will ever get there!

"S . WE acool MARTIAN EXPLORER Here's your chance to bodly go where no games player has gone before-deep into the mysterious caverns of the red planet Mars. Fly your spacecraft through the network of wierd and wonderful underground caves and tunnels but remember you could run out of fuel. Luckily for you previous Martian explorers have left fuel dumps which you can use -if you can land safely among the rocks cavern floor. The landing pad is coloured light green and is located on the right hand side of your screen. Once down safely your ship will be refuelled and the next cavern will appear. Points are awarded for a safe landing based on the difficulty level and the amount of fuel you have left. You have a display which tells you your speed and fuel the amount of fuel in your ship's tanks. If you come into land at a speed greater than 10 units you will crash. And of course you have to avoid contact with the cavern walls during your flight. You get five ships per game. To get the action underway all you have to do is press the red button on your joystick. This ignites your ship's engines. Gravity is simulated in this program so when you release the button your craft slows down and will gradually start to fall downwards at a gradually increasing speed. No error loops have been included to cover the accidental flight of a spaceship off the cursor end of the screen and if this happens an error message will ensue. So you should take care not to send your craft off the screen in this way.

"and stay alive-by blasting Rock and roll among the planets in this intergalactic adaptation of an all action arcade game. Rocks is similar to that arcade favourite Asteroids. You control a spaceship threatened by a swarm of deadly meteorites. You score points the rocks. When you have scored 300 an alien saucer streaks across the screen and attempts to ram you. You can avoid or shoot it down. To control your VIC ship use key 1 and 2 to turn, 8 and 9 to move left and right, 0 to fire. You can also use the spacebar to hyperspace your way out of trouble but this will cost you 100 points each time you use it. The main variables are: SC-score. X2-shape of space ship. RL the rock variable. Jinput form keyboard.

"REVERSI BY JOHN BALL SUBTLE USE OF THUMBS The standard board values would strongly persuade you to avoid playing next to a corner, but look at diagram one. There is one square next to a corner that is safe due to white holding the side. So a White play at A would be far prefer8 CBOO 1 DOO A ly a must to play in. It is White's best move, so teach the computer to spot it. Generally, any corner with an odd number of squares is preferable to one with even. Maximum piece capture overall is thus not best judged by captures per go even near the end. The Japanese Othello machine seen in the shops has the major weakness of taking thumb three to extremes it hardly ever takes sides. In diagram three, you are fast running out of options as White, so you should take the side at F. For a computer program, you have to teach it to count \"options\", so that when there are few \"good\" moves, you make it take sides more readily before it is too late and corners have to be given away! Yet if you had plenty of good moves, taking sides would invariably be wrong especially if it meant getting a 5-five pieces in a row along the side. 8 2 The family Reversi champion can probably tell you the \"do\"s and \"don't\"s of the game. These are the \"rules of thumb\" which most keen Reversi â€” also known as Othello players will stick with, even though he may not have categorised them as such. But the expert Reversi player/ programmer will also know when to break those same rules. In the last article on computerised Reversi (C&VG May) I outlined these rules. They were: Board Values, so that the nearer the corners the worse the move, but capturing corners being best. The whole game is really about capturing the corners to help you capture pieces permanently. I have included the values diagram below. 8-9 29 5 4 4 5 29 -9 7 29 22 3 2 2 3 22 29 6 5 3 1 1 1 1 3 5 5 4 2 1 0 1 2 4 4 4 2 1 1 2 4 35 3 1 1 1 1 3 5 229 22 3 2 2 3 22 29 1 -9 29 5 4 4 5 29 -9 a b c d e f g h Piece capturing, where ironically it pays to take as few as possible to reduce your opponent's choice of moves. Side taking, which helps shortterm \"option-battles\" but is bad in the end-game, so generally avoid them. I said that a computer program based on those three points, if carefully balanced would result in a reasonable standard of play. But of course that is not the whole story. In my book Key To Othello, only half a dozen of the 36 pages deal with what I now call the three thumbs. The rest deals with other finer points that are really exceptions in other words telling you when to give the \"thumbs down\". 5 a b c d e f g h Fig. 1 able to B. B would provoke a Black reply at C, and give Black a future good play at D. So the values of the board squares change due to the position. They are not fixed. The most obvious exception to Thumb two is near the end of the game when you need to take as many pieces as possible to win. So at some point say 10 moves from the end, you reverse the Thumb. That abrupt change is a bit crude, so that more subtle methods of selecting moves near the end are required. For example, if the four squares of a corner are filled up with three pieces as in diagram two, then the empty square at E is almost certain 4 31 OOOOOO a b c d e f g h Fig. 3 Pattern Recognition Ultimately you find exceptions to the above exceptions! This forms the basic human skill and knowledge of the experienced player. The difficulty of transforming a good playing knowledge of Reversi into a good computer program, is that the game is so simple in format that many players find good moves by sheer instinct. It is turning that unconscious knowhow into hard and fast rules which enable you to write a worthy program. There is a simple way of giving a computer this detailed knowledge. This is best left for another article. DIO a Fig. 2 b c d e f g h "


"Gedich? ALTERNATIVE DIMENSIONS Fig. 3 Any video game or simulation that deals with real events and scenes has to face the problem of how it can successfully represent the real three-dimensional world on a flat two-dimensional video screen. The eyes and brain of every person have to cope with a similar problem because we see the world only via a flat image of it produced on the retina of the eye. The secret of representing threedimensional images in a realistic way on a flat surface was discovered by the artists of the Renaissance in the fifteenth century. One of the set-pieces used for teaching perspective at that time was to draw a chalice, and there is a famous drawing of a chalice by Uccello in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence which bears a startling resemblance to the most modern computer-generated images. The idea of perspective is that the cone of rays of light reflected from an object into the eye becomes narrower the further the object is from the eye. This explains why an object appears to be smaller when it is further away from one's eye. Students of art are usually taught to deal with perspective on say a street or a straight fence, by drawing a \"disappearing point\" on the horizon, this is where the houses or A surface can be represented by a 'wire-frame' model obtained by taking a rectangular grid in the x-y plane, calculating the height of the surface above each cross-point of the grid and then joining these surface points. A part of the surface z = x -y drawn in this way is shown in figure 2. A three-dimensional curve can be defined by the intersection of the fence would slip beyond the line of sight if they were to continue for ever. It works well on straight boulevards but more thought is needed on twisting or hilly terraces. This idea naturally leads us to a way of representing solid objects on a flat surface. We can specify the position from which an object is being observed and the position of the flat surface on which it is to be represented as shown in figure 1. The eye is at the origin of the coordinate system. The picture plane is parallel to the x-y plane at a distance d from the eye with its origin on the z-axis. A three-dimensional point with coordinates (x, y, z) can then be seen to correspond to the point (X, Y) in the picture plane, where X = x + (d/2) and Y = y* (dz) Using this perspective transformation, three-dimensional surfaces and curves can be represented by transforming points in the picture plane and joining them as appropriate. A three-dimensional surface can be represented mathematically by an equation such as: Z = x-ya or, more generally, by any equation giving z in terms of x and y. If the x-y plane is taken as horizontal, then for every point (x,y) in this plane, the height, z, of the surface above the plane is given by such an equation P(x, y, z) I Fig. 2 picture plane two surfaces, and so it can be given mathematically by the equations for a pair of surfaces. Any point lying on two surfaces at the same time must lie on the curve in which they intersect each other. Part of the helix given by: x = cos(2/2) and y = sin(2/2) is shown in figure 3 from several points of view. By Gary Marshall "

"GAMES SAY You are in the hands of chance only if you believe in luck, according to ARNOLD ARNOLD. In this article he examines \"So-called\" games of chance whether they are played on computers, on game boards or on the stock market. Great, Ghengis Khan, Napoleon or Adolf Hitler. But the available variety of dirty tricks is sufficiently great so that they will wear out and defeat any aggressor, no matter what he does, provided he can't wipe you out with the first blow. Unless that occurs â€” and it is rare or impossible, except in nuclear war he who strikes the first blow, or makes the first move in any game, suffers a severe numerical disadvantage. That disadvantage is precisely equal to the number of turns he enjoys, unless he knows how to play perfectly. This is a mathematically based Many game of chance players generals, admirals, investors and habitues of gambling casinos believe in luck. Good luck to them, but bad luck to those they command or whose money they invest. Games, love and war can only be understood in terms of human behaviour (subjectively), machine behaviour (relatively objectively) or mathematically (with total objectivity) The latter method can provide an understanding of all three, thanks to newly discovered mathematical techniques which merely confirm what some people have felt all along â€” although they usually get into terrible pub arguments. The new mathematics of games ends such arguments because you can't argue with the facts. For one thing the new mathematics demonstrates that luck and chance are human superstitions believed by those who want to evade responsibility for their own actions. Let's start by pitching penniesby hand or by computer. No luck is ever involved there. It all depends on whether or not you know what you and your game partner human or computer are doing. If neither knows what he is doing, first one and then the other may win for a while. If both pitch pennies in a random, mindless manner for long enough, that game will end in a draw. But if both players are perfect craftsmen and know how to manipulate the coin with precision, each will get what he wants every time. That's also a draw. The only genuine victory that can be achieved is when one player knows how to manipulate the coin perfectly and the other can't, and doesn't believe that this can be done. The same principle holds true for war games and for actual warfare. All wars are based on dirty tricks. They constitute the only winning strategies â€” just as in pitching pennies. The idea in war is to create maximum confusion for the opponent so that he makes mistakes. Then you move in for the kill. To try winning by brute force is stupid, expensive and eventually fatal. No one can keep that up forever, whether it's Alexander the Given the new mathematics of games and a little self-discipline, anyone can win steadily and consistently at roulette, or any other socalled game of chance, unless the table is fixed, the croupier knows how to manipulate ball and table with relative precision, or the betting rules are rigged. Except for random programming that is nonetheless limited or deliberate exclusion of certain combinations, computers can't be made to cheat. The limits of systematic machine randomization can now be defined mathematically. That poses a threat for many who write game programs and for gambling casinos, but only from knowledgable players who are first rate mathematicians. The possibilities for human cheating may seem endless. But even such cheating has its limits. Once all cheating methods are known, no-one can ever take advantage of anyone else. One of the so-called winning ploys in what were believed to be games of chance consists of temporary alliances that are dissolved as soon as convenient. Then you turn on your former ally when he least expects it. That is virtually the only way to succeed at Monopoly, Risk and in other games in which such strategies are not expressly forbidden by the rules. But these realistic policies are difficult to apply in computer games, unless specifically allowed for in the program. As in the previous article which dealt with Space Invaders, the difference between defensive and attack strategies become clear. As far as any attacker is concerned anything goes. Defenders are best off with those they can count on to remain loyal, come what may. None of this involves any moral judgments. These are mathematically verifiable facts which are confirmed by experience, The trouble with war games is that one wonders to what they lead? What is won when the opposition is wiped out? In real life there is then no one with (or against) whom to play. In games, one war game can only lead to another. No chance, luck or fate is ever involved in either case. statement. Anyone can verify it by comparing the sum of choices available to the first moving player in Noughts and Crosses. This disadvantage declines towards the end of the game, but then it doesn't matter any more. The game ends in a draw when the first moving player's numerical disadvantage declines to zero. These facts are even true for games that are traditionally known as games of chance and luck. As every poker player knows, the player who makes the first bet is said to be under the gun. That is a very big disadvantage. illustration: Jon Davis COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 65 "

"THE KEYBOARD QUESTION For the unadventurous, replacing the keyboard on the Sinclair machines can seem a daunting task. There is a large selection of possible keyboards now available, for the ZX81 in particular, and it can be confusing to decide exactly what you need from the keyboards and how much hardware you wish to fit inside the case. Most of the models currently on the market have been produced in the same form for some time. They are usually about three-quarters of the size of a normal QWERTY keyboard which makes them especially attractive to users of the ZX81 who wish to keep their system as compact as possible. The case provided with many of the keyboards are even large enough to house the ZX81 itself. Unfortunately, for those who regularly use a full size keyboard, and are familiar with its \"feel\" there is, as far as I know, no alternative. That is, unless you are prepared to do a little modifying with knife and soldering iron. There are available, I know, several versions of unencoded matrix keyboard but as Sinclair uses a non-standard matrix, as tions will be effected by wire links. This will make your job all the easier, as all you will have to do on this side is to rearrange the links. The trouble will come when the tracks on the bottom of the board have to be changed. Fortunately, here, the most frequently used means of key connection is by soldering a fine wire in a very large plated-through hole. This will, as a consequence, mean that there will be plenty of room for the new connecting wires when you come to reassemble the board. After unsoldering the keys the next and most important step to take is to make a sketch of the board and all the usable connections. It is no good rewiring the board and then finding out that you have made a wrong connection somewhere. It will invariably be in the most inconvenient place, according to Murphy's Law, chapter two. Once you have convinced yourself that you have the matrix right, and you can refer to the diagram in last month's edition, the offending tracks must be cut and replaced by wire links. Do not remove the track at all, but cut through it with a very sharp knife. This will allow you, if you wish, to modify the board later to a different matrix without much trouble. I prefer to use singlestranded wire for this type of job but multistranded will do. Try to make the links as short as possible pppp Spele 11-2-3-45 6 7 8 9 0 Q-w-E-RI YU TOP A S D E G H-J-K-L-n sh -x-cV B-N-Msp you use the same sort of socket. These, fortunately, are generally available from \"most good stores\", as is the connecting strip. The modification above can, of course, be made on almost any type of keyboard, even the encoded type, which normally has an RS232 output. This would become redundant if the matrix is changed, though. These keyboard are, however very expensive for a straight modification and it is possible to alter them for both forms of operation. This is a very tricky job as the matrix must work in both systems and should only be undertaken by those who know how the UART (look it up) functions. Of course, second hand keyboards are available in junk shops and at computer bring-andbuy sales and many other places. These are ideal to practice on as they are cheap (as little as ) for the associated electronics are often defunct. You can make the most of the board by fitting extra sockets to take joysticks and other associated add-ons. Also, the boxes for these keyboards are large enough to take the machine, the power supply and the memory pack if you wish. You would then be left with only the printer and any other controls you yourself had added, to carry separately. RP3 LKBD 2 EKBD 1 shown last month, these are not suitable in their original form. If you contemplate buying a full size keyboard for your ZX80/81/ Spectrum try to get one in kit form. This will save you the job of having to unsolder all or most of the keys when you come to modify the matrix, as the connecting tracks are often on both sides of the board. If you are very lucky the top connecand as close to the board as you can this will ensure the machine is robust. On the board there should be a connector of some sort that would have taken the signal from the original matrix. You may decide to use this one or one of your choice. Whichever it is you will find it difficult to attach the same type of connector as is used by Sinclair unless BY KEITH MONT "

The keys 7, 9, 1, 3 can also be used for movement in the appropriate direction. Another possibility is to use cursor control keys, if they are available, to implement directional movement. DO YOU TALK TO YOUR USERS? Even some professional software tapes fall down in the vital area of communicating with the person who will end up using them. Communicating instructions or other help in deciding what the computer next expects of its player is an important part of the games program and should be built into the program at an early stage. There are two types of input routine: in the first type the program looks to see if an input is ready and continues if there is not, in the second the program stops until an input is ready. The two forms are implemented in Basic by GET or INKEY$ for the first and INPUT for the second, although there are other differences. GET and INKEY$ are extensively used in interactive action games, where the display and the state of the game must be continuously upWHICH KEY DOES THAT? An important consideration in this type of program is the actual specification of which key does what. The keys and their functions should be easy for the player to remember; the above example satisfies this criterion if L, R, U, D, F stand for \"move left\", \"move right\", \"move up\", \"move down\", \"fire\". It is less satisfactory to use, say, the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as there is no immediate connection between the digit and IMMEDIATE RESPONSE In the action games, considered above, the program responds to one key at a time and the response is immediate. The player is given no chance to correct an error, but since such games are mainly a test of speed and dexterity pressing the wrong key is one of the hazards of the game. However, in strategy games and data processing applications we need a different approach to errors. As an example, consider the problem of checking the player's move in a game of chess. A standard format for specifying the squares on the board and the moves is to label the columns, from left to right, with the letters a to h, and the rows, from bottom to top with the digits 1 to 8. A square is specified by the column letter and row digit, and a move is specified by giving the starting square and finishing square of the move. For example, e2 is the square at the fifth column and second row, e4 is the square at the fifth column and fourth row, and e2e4 means move the piece on square e2 to square e4, as an opening move this would be, in another standard chess notation, P-K4, pawn to king four. dated whether or not the player has done anything, while INPUT is more often used in games where turns alternate or in applications where the program processes data that is typed in. In an interactive action game there is usually little difficulty in processing the result from a GET or INKEY$ instruction. It is often possible to have a single routine to handle the player's responses, which will work something like the following: BY TED BALL the corresponding action and the player will have to learn arbitrary key values before he can really get into the game. On machines with a numeric keypad separate from the main keyboard the keypad is often used to define direction of movement. With the standard layout: 789 456 123 O?? The keys 4, 6, 8, 2 can be used for THE CHECKING PROCESS The checking process can be divided into two parts: first, checking that the input string has a valid form for the specification of a move, and second, checking that a valid form specifies a legal move accord70 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING Com ing to the rules of the game. To use some jargon, the first part of the checking process is a \"syntactic\" problem, while the second part is a \"semantic\" problem. The distinction is that syntax refers to form while semantics refers to meaning. In general, syntactic problems are much simpler than semantic problems, and this is certainly the case in checking a chess move. The syntax for a move can be defined precisely as requiring exactly four characters of which the first and third are letters from a to h and the second and fourth are digits from 1 to 8. This can easily be checked by a simple routine, for example: 1000 IF LEN (M$) < >4 THEN GOTO 2000 1010 IF MIDS(M$, 1, 1) < \"a\" OR MIDS(M$, 3, 1)>\"h\" THEN GOTO 2000 1020 IF MID$(M$, 2, 1) < \"1\" OR MID$(M$, 4, 1) > \"8\" THEN GOTO 2000 where line 2000 is the start of the error report routine. Android Nim: \"Get a move on we haven't got all day!\" and scientific applications it could be disastrous. Although a games magazine is not the place to discuss such applications every programmer should appreciate the importance of data validation. THE POLITE COMPUTER ARE YOU SURE THAT'S LEGAL? The semantic problem of deciding if a syntactically correct move is legal is much more complicated; too complicated to deal with fully here. A little thought will reveal some of the things that must be checked: does the player have a piece on the first square specified; is the second square vacant; if the second square is occupied is it occupied by one of the player's pieces or one of the computer's pieces; does the move expose the player's king to check. If a chess program is to be effective the routine that checks a move for legality must be thorough and efficient as the main use made of such a routine will not be checking that the player's moves are legal but in generating possible moves for the program. When the program is testing many lines of play for several moves ahead the move generator may be used thousands of times and must be very fast to avoid unacceptably long times for deciding on moves In game programs where the rules and the format of the input are precisely defined it is always possible to make a complete check on the input for validity and legality, and this should always be done. A program should never accept an invalid move and all invalid inputs should be trapped by checking routines written into the program and not left to the programming language or operating system. For example: in a gambling program if you try to bet 100 when you only have 50 the program should detect this and give a message like \"You don't have that much, try again\". If the program accepts the 100 it may later try to use the 50 left after subtracting 100 from 50 in an expression where negative numbers are inadmissable. In that case you would get a system error message, \"Function call error in 1234,\" or something similar. The program would then terminate and the machine would go back to Basic command mode, which could be confusing to someone who does not write programs and only uses his computer to run pre-recorded programs, and would be annoying to someone who had typed in 100 when he meant 10 and has been given no chance to correct his mistake. In game programs, failing to trap an invalid input is at most annoying to the user, but in serious business As a corollary to the trapping of errors we should also give some though to the form of the error messages given after an error has been detected. All messages from a program should be informative and polite. In some cases it may be sufficient to say simply \"Error\" or \"Invalid command\", in other cases it may be necessary to be more specific, for example in chess suitable error messages may be \"That move would put you in check\" or \"You already have a piece on E4\". Regarding politeness in error messages you often find messages like: \"You can't go there, you rotten cheat\" or, (a real example) in Android Nim, if you are slow in making a move you will be told: \"Get a move on, we haven't got all day\". Such things may be amusing the first few times you see them but by the 100th time they are just annoying. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 71 "

"DOWN TO BASIC PRESENTATION IS VITAL In all uses of computers, the presentation of the output is vital. This not only applies to games with a visual emphasis like Space Invaders, but also to business applications such as payroll systems. In many cases, a lot of the time spent in designing and developing a program will be spent on the presentation of the output. The importance of this aspect of programming causes me to devote this month's article to the extra facilities provided in many versions of Basic to help programmers improve their display of information. These extra facilities can be divided into two main categories: the extra forms of the PRINT statement provided to allow the programmer to specify precisely where results are to be displayed; and the special graphics statements sometimes available â€” such as the PLOT statement which are particularly useful for pictorial displays. each column. The section of program PRINT TAB(3);\"NAME\":TAB(10);\"HEIGHT\" 75 PRINT 80 FOR I=1 TO 3 85 PRINT TAB(3):N$(I);TAB(10):H(I) 90 NEXT I could be used to output a table with the following format NAME HEIGHT FRED 1.84 MARY 1.62 CECIL 1.97 I have described the effect of TAB(X) as being the printing of the next item in positions X onwards. It should be pointed out that in some versions the effect would be to print the next item in positions (Xxl) onwards the result being that everything is shifted one position further to the right than in the version I have described. Some systems also have the statements HTAB and VTAB. These can also be used to specify the required position for printing however, these appear not as part of a PRINT statement, but as statements in their own right before the appropriate PRINT statement. EXTRA PRINT FACILITIES If the number of characters that can be printed on one line of the screen paper is N, then you can think of each character position on a line as being numbered from 1 to N (N will vary from one system to another). The TAB function specifies a move to a particular character position on the line. The general form of the TAB function is TAB(X) where X may be a constant, a variable or an arithmetic expression. If the function TAB(6) were encountered in a PRINT statement, then a move to position six on the line would take place. If X is a variable or an arithmetic expression that takes a non-integer value e.g. X= 14.5, then the integer part of X will be taken as the required position in this case 14). BY MOIRA NORRIE 78 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES The effect of using the TAB function is that printing will continue from the specified position. The statement 30 PRINT TAB (3);\"FRED\":TAB(10);Y would produce the following output, assuming that Y had the value 1.25. position 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 FRED 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ... 1. 2 5 The cursor will move to position 3 then print \"FRED\" in positions 3 onwards; it then moves to position 10 and prints the value of Y in positions 10 onwards. The reason that the digit \"1\" appears in column 11 is that whenever a number is printed it is preceded by a minus sign, if it is negative, or a space, if it is positive. Therefore, position 10 will contain either a space or a minus sign depending upon the value of Y. It is important to remember the space that precedes a positive number as it causes the values to be printed one position further to the right than might be expected! It is also important to separate the items in the PRINT statement with semi-colons rather than commas when using the TAB function otherwise you will be mixing up the precise specification of positions in the output line with the ideas of \"skipping to the next zone\" caused by the appearance of a comma. In many systems, it is in fact possible to omit the semi-colons and obtain the same effect: 30 PRINT TAB(3)\"FRED\"TAB(10)Y The TAB function is particularly useful when printing a table â€” it allows you to specify the position of HORIZONTAL HELLOS HTAB (horizontal TAB) is similar to the TAB function in that it specifies the required position of the cursor on the output line. VTAB (vertical TAB) can be used to select a particular line on the screen as the next output line. The statements: 60 VTAB 10 70 HTAB 15 80 PRINT \"HELLO\" would cause the word HELLO to be printed on line 10 of the screen in positions 15 onwards. A number of the microcomputers offer special graphics facilities. These can include such things as special graphics symbols, statements for plotting points and drawing lines and things like selection of colours. The range of facilities varies greatly and I will, therefore, only cover one of the more common "


"DOWN TO BASIC POS statements the PLOT statement in this article. Before using the special graphics statements, such as PLOT, it is often necessary to indicate that you wish to enter \"graphics mode\". For example, on the APPLE II, you can use the statement 30 GR to set the computer ready for graphical display the screen will be set up with 40 rows and 40 columns which can be referenced by graphics statements, and 4 lines at the bottom of the screen reserved for text. It is then possible to select a position on the screen to be \"shaded\" by use of the PLOT statement: 40 PLOT 20, 10 will cause the small area in column 20, row 10 to be shaded. The APPLE II has colour facilities and it is therefore possible to select a particular colour for shading by using the COLOR statement. The number of different positions that can be selected will determine the amount of detail that can be produced in a picture produced in this way. The APPLE II system offers two levels of detail â€” low resolution and high resolution. If the statement 30 HGR is given, then the high resolution option will be selected. In this case, the area of the screen used for graphics is divided into 280 columns and 160 rows. Positions on the screen can then be selected for shading by use of the HPLOT statement, which is similar in use to the PLOT statement. The penalty paid for the increase in the level of detail is the reduction in the range of colours available.

The main differences between the 400 and 800 computers is that the 400 cannot be expanded from its basic memory capacity of 16K, and it also has a sensory surface keyboard instead of the full typewriter keyboard which the 800 boasts. With the 400 system comes the computer itself, a power adaptor which can be plugged into an ordinary outlet in your house, a switchbox which is connected into the back of the television and allows you to swop from TV viewing to computer operation. An operation manual is also given with the machine. Software for the 400 comes in two forms, either cartridge or cassette. The latter must be loaded by tape recorder, the former can be plugged straight into the computer. You cannot change the information on the cartridges because they are ROM based and therefore not addressable.

Whitby, South Wirral L66 PUN Tel 051-339 7267 To date the only peripherals available in Britain are made by Atari itself. Each piece of equipment which can be hooked up to the Atari 400 and 800 computers is a product of the firm covering almost every computer owners' need. For loading programs into the machines there are two options open to you, either via cassette recorder or disc drives. The 400 computer can only be cassette loaded, but the more sophisticated 800 can use either method. The Atari 410 Program Recorder looks like an ordinary tape recorder but there is one significant difference. To facilitate easy loading the volume levels are set for playback and recording to the correct pitch. You can use the Program Recorder to load and save programs which have been written in Atari languages. It is available from listed Atari dealers for .00. For faster loading of programs Atari has produced a range of disc drives for the 800 series. A minimum of 16K memory space is needed to use the Atari 810 single disc drive which allows the use of one 5. inch floppy disc at a time. The computer does have the facility to attach up to four single disc drives which gives you about 92K bytes. It costs . Printed out information can be obtained on a printer which is plugged into the standard RS 232C interface. In Atari's range are two printers a 40 column thermal printer which prints out in dot matrix forms to a maximum of 40 characters per line. With the Atari 822 thermal printer comes an input/output data cable and an AC power adaptor. The price is costly at  for the unit. An 80 column printing out 80 characters per line is also available from Atari dealers. Code named the Atari 825 Printer can carry out a variety of functions, with underscoring and backspacing capabilities.
