Capcom on the latest Atari get ready to launch some YET MORE STREETFICHTER version of the Street Jaguar CD games. Fighter coin-op fea Virgin go PlayStation. turing of course Kylie, Imagineer sign old arcade the Muscles from classic Mr Do! Brussels and Raul Julia News on the Virtual Boy Ever wondered what a cross between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter would be like? Well dream no more dear reader because it's going to happen! (RIP). Plus turn the Some Ace Combat on PlayStation page for the latest Baywatch pinball! With the imminent release of the Street Fighter movie, Capcom USA have the next version of the game ready to roll. It's the eighth to date, not including any of the illegal altered ones, and they've promised to take the gameplay way beyond any of the other versions. Instead of the old-fashioned sprite-based graphics, all the characters from the movie have been digitised and put into the game taking up a whopping 260 Megabits on their own! As for the playability, well, there's going to be 12 backdrops taken from the film, texture-mapped graphics, 50 all-new combat moves and multi-hit combos including many from SFIl turbo. It all sounds very promising, but the question is how will people take to a bunch of characters who've changed completely since their last outing? With Cammy transformed into combat Kylie, who knows how it'll go down... Meanwhile they're also putting out a little number called Street Fighter Legends. The game features most of the characters from SFII, plus a couple from the original Street Fighter. All the graphics have been redrawn so they're larger and more detailed, while there's more combo potential than ever before. It should be in the arcades before the end of the year. news on Ultra 64 Perfect Golf on the PSX. "


"NEWS CVG Connected MK FOR PG? WINS. 00 SHANG TSUNG WINS: 00 The MK conversion saga continues to twist and turn like a very twisty turny thing. The latest news is that new boys GT Interactive, have signed the rights to 32 and 64-bit versions. Although Sony have now finalised the deal (and gazumped Atari in the process) in which the game breaks on PlayStation first, apparently they forgot to include the PC CD-ROM version in the exclusivity contract, which means there's a possibility of that version appearing before Christmas. As for GT, they're aiming to have the Saturn and Ultra 64 versions of the game ready for spring '96 Meanwhile the coin-op's almost ready to roll, with final versions going on test in this country during May. The list of features for it continues to mount. In addition to the cheat codes, you can now hit the others characters so hard you blast them into another level. Watch out for the review and all the cheats and moves we can muster, next issue. WINS: 00 W INS: 00 WINS: 00 WINS-00 SMILEYA THE PERFECT GOLF For the first time in ages, there's a golf game on the way that doesn't use digitised characters. The Perfect Golf on PlayStation relies on Tekken-style texture mapped graphics for the golfers. Import copies are due to arrive in a couple of months. SATURN VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 â€” FIRST PICS! With Daytona only on the shelves for a couple of weeks, Sega have already eclipsed it with the unveiling of the Saturn version of Virtua Fighter 2. At a press conference in Japan, they showed off the preliminary graphics which look almost arcade perfect. The texture mapping, speed and animation are all up to par, so it looks like Saturn owners can expect an arcade-perfect conversion later in the year. However, there's no news of a UK release. Which begs the question, what's going to happen to Virtua Fighter 12 Chances are it could come packaged with the machine which means we could see the sequel on the shelves before Christmas. ZERO DIVIDE With the PlayStation already boasting two of the best beat-'em-ups to appear in a long, long time, there's a third 3D combat fest on its way this summer. Zero Divide replaces most of the traditional human characters with giant robots, each boasting plenty of excellent special attacks along with tons of hidden features. Preview next issue. SECA "


"CVG NEWS connected BABEWATCH BB%OH BOY OH BOY Forget Dirty Harry, Friday the 13th and Addams Family pintables, here comes one with real lethal weapons. I mean, Baywatch Pinball is pretty sad, right? But a with a video function featuring young Pamela Anderson too, well, just what are Sega trying to sell this game on? The game features a good, clear play area, with plenty of secret games, including a fantastic video mode on the super-sized LED display. On top of that there's a six-player mode and doubles setting unseen on any pintable until now. It's also loaded with all the usual multiball and lock features, sub-games and ramps. And. yes, there's plenty of David Hasselhoff speech which has been especially recorded for the game, although, thank the dear lord, there's none of his singing. With still no firm release and price details for the Virtual Boy, it's no wonder that people over here seem to have given up on it. It's a different story in Japan, though, where increasing amounts of software are being shown to the press. The latest batch include a Tetris-style puzzler and a scrolling shoot-'em-up. Both games look rather fun, although unless Nintendo can bring the Virtual Boy out for less than , we don't think it's worth releasing. ACE IN THE HOLE BAG Feast your eyes on these pics of what could well be one of the hottest PlayStation titles this summer. Ace Combat is a cross between Afterburner and more conventional flight simulations, fronted with some of the fastest, neatest 3D graphics the machine's yet seen. The aim is to complete a series of increasingly tough missions which pit you against a variety of ground and air targets as well the usual hazards of running out of fuel and ammunition. Early news of Ace Combat on PlayStation is that it's looking cool. VIRGIN CONSOLE THEMSELVES MIDO! MID! Finally the retro-gaming fad has caught up with one of the most addictive games ever. Mr Do!, hero of the arcades a whopping 13 years ago is set to appear on the SNES in Japan thanks to Imagineer. Although there isn't any information as to an official release date, it should be available on import this summer. They won't have any trouble producing an arcade-perfect conversion, but it remains to be seen if the game's still as playable now as it was all those years ago. Virgin's commitment to the next generation super consoles took a step in the right direction with news of their 1995 schedule. Development teams from both sides of the Atlantic are work ing on about a dozen titles for the PlayStation and a similar volume for the Saturn. PlayStation titles include IndyCar Racing, Hoopz (a basketball title), Nascar Racing, Papyrus', Tilt (a pinball simulator) and Cool Spot 2. The return of the carbonated hero in an isometric platformer should show off the PlayStation's impressive 2D capabilities in full. Meanwhile, Virgin are hoping to have about six Ultra 64 titles ready by Christmas, depending on whether Nintendo's machine rolls off the production line for the festive season. DA-DO-RUN-RUN "

"CVG NEWS connected ULTra bright for Ultra 62 SIGN ON THE DOTTED Nintendo's  dream machine is no longer a figment of the imagination. Its 64-bit technology should be invading our bedrooms come Christmas of this year. CVG gives you the lowdown in the Ultra 64's rather secretive development... It's early days, but companies are chomping at the 64-bit to get involved with Nintendo's next generation console RARE Currently working on Killer Instinct and Bond licence, Goldeneye. SIERRA ON-LINE Pioneers of on-line gaming should bring us Ultra 64 Red Baron SPECTRUM HOLOBYTE Flight sim specialists should bring aeronautical thrills to Ultra 64 owners. WILLIAMS Programmed Cru'sin' USA for the arcade. It's a fair bet it'll be converted for the Ultra 64. OK, so you're all aware that the Ultra 64 is supposed to be the things dreams are made of, but to make a winning console takes more than state-of-the-art hardware. It takes development kit and creative software to turn today's dreams into tomorrow's realities. In their bid to be console kings, Nintendo have taken a celluloid leaf out of the movie industry. Alias is the software VIRGIN Have over half-a-dozen Ultra 64 titles under development. Other interested parties include, DMA, Software Creations, Ocean and GameTek USA. package responsible for the special effects used by Industrial Light & Magic in movies like Terminator II, Jurassic Park, The Mask and the new Batman Forever film. What Alias possesses is extremely powerful and creative animation tools which allow developers to create 24-bit graphic images with speed and simplicity. Filmmakers and special effects departments have been so impressed with sequences created by Alias that they believe without question, that some movies would not have been logistically possible without it. With this in mind, and the fact that Alias has extra tools for game production, Nintendo are drawing on the software's creative muscle 10 "


"NEWS CVG connected HEY, MISTER WHAT'S IN THE BOX? While no-one's confirmed what's going to lurk beneath the plastic casing of the Ultra 64, most folk are backing this spec. These robots are courtesy of Alias' software and by the looks of them they're well oiled R4200 RISC processor (PlayStation uses an older R3000A chip). Clock speed in excess of 100 Mhz (top PC's achieve this kind of speed). 24-bit with 16.8 million colours available with high resolution video and CD quality. HDTV (TV screen resolution of the future) 3D anti-alias texture mapping (this allows shapes to feature surface detail with higher definition than current TV standard). VAVAV GameTek USA's stunning Robotech front end. to bring this type of technology to Ultra 64 owners. So when a software house becomes an Ultra 64 producer they are immediately shipped Alias to work on. It may come as a surprise, but Nintendo are putting great stock in British creative talent. In fact, the majority of the 16 current worldwide developers are from the UK. One such developer is Rare, who brought SNES owners the groundbreaking Donkey Kong Country, which would never have been realised without the advantages of Alias. Rare are currently developing solely for Ultra 64, and while practically all projects are being kept tightly under wraps, it's a known fact that they're working hard on an Ultra 64 version of that coinop winner, Killer Instinct. Timed for a conjunctive release with the Ultra 64, Rare say that the machine has the power to run all the features present in the current coin-op, plus some extra improvements. Rare claim there'll be no difference in sound, detail of character or speed. They also say that following feedback from the gaming public they've been able to fine tune and improve the gameplay. On the topic of Ultra 64 itself, Rare's Simon Farmer, while tightlipped on the actual machine specifications had this to say: \"The Ultra 64 will be the most powerful console on the market when it's launched later this year... The Ultra 64 compares extremely favourably with other new machines. In almost every area it outclasses the competition.. Developers will be capable of producing true next generation software... The power of the hardware is such that we can begin exploring areas of gaming not yet seen on any system.\" So, if you want a taster of what the Ultra 64's going to be like, stick a quid in Ultra 64's older brother and play Killer Instinct "


"CVG NEWS CREATURE SHOCK Virgin's interactive-ish CD-ROM title is to be converted to the Jag. At present it looks the same as its PC counterpart, but Atari promise that the action will involve some playability. ataRI'S DEATURESIDER Can Gets The With the Jaguar's CD unit just weeks away from its launch, the first taste of a few shiny CD appetisers are filtering through the proverbial games percolator CReam F1 RACER SOUL STAR Core Design's 32% space shoot-'em-up is currently being warped over to the Jaguar. With 19 levels Soul Star on the Jaguar should boast a few enhancements over its Sega relative, but don't expect miracles. BLUE LIGHTNING Developers Teque are looking for a September release for their impressive F1 Jag title. Based on, yes you've guessed it, Formula 1 Grand Prix racing, F1 Racer will bring texture mapped driving thrills to Jag owners. The game will also boast a splitscreen option and seven views to enjoy your drive from. Take to the skies in a variety of state-of-the-art jets in Atari's souped-up version of what was the Lynx's answer to Afterburner. What we've seen moves very quickly, but with only a few levels anywhere near complete it's difficult to gauge whether we're dealing with just another 16-bit style shoot-'em-up. Lehm Ho Time: 87 F1 Racer on Jag CD looks far more promising than the turkey that was Chequered Flag. Atari reckon they'll have an 20 extra titles by the summer and 100 by the end of the year. "


"NEWS CVG Connected DEMOLITION MAN BURN OUT Going on looks and first impressions this plays exactly the same as the 3DO version. Being packed with digitised segments from the movie and extremely mindless play. Demolition Man has every chance of being a winner. The end of June should see the release of this Nineties Super Hang-On clone: Burn Out. Set across eight courses, it also features a highly playable splitscreen option. BIG CAT CLAWS EA r PE ice 0 00-54 FIGHT FOR LIFE Atari's padded a tentative claw forward this month by securing a deal with Electronic Arts. It's odds-on that Jag owners can look forward to conversions of the Wing Commander series, FIFA and Magic Carpet heading their way. Atari's other deals should secure a version of Sega's Daytona USA reaching the machine soon. Meanwhile, Acclaim are to produce three titles: an early '96 release has been penciled in for a Doomstyle reworking of the Judge Dredd licence, while NBA Jam and Frank Thomas 'Big Hurt' Baseball are scheduled for Christmas. Another attempt from Atari to boldly go where Kasumi Ninja didn't. The beat'em-up FFL will see eight Virtua-style fighters with 40 moves a piece. VARUNA'S FORCES Jaguar owners are promised true interactive entertainment in this futuristic combination of rendered graphics, full motion video links and 3D shoot-'em-up, due for release about November. WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP 300448 00 A tenuous spin-off from the movie of the same name will put two-on-two basketball on to an Atari cartridge. Played in four different styles of court, the game will feature a large variety of sampled swearing. 'Eat my shed, you muddy funkster', or something along those lines. PREDATOR ULTRA VORTEX After the success of the Jag's flagship title, Alien Versus Predator, Atari are currently prowling the nation sniffing for a team to develop AVP2. Why there should be a sequel to any game is questionable, but rumours are rife that AVP2 will feature the appearance of Atari's Virtuality helmet which was unveiled for the first time at E3. Although Atari bod, Daryll Still, wasn't too forthcoming, he did have this to say about AVP2: \"I can forsee each player playing a different character from any of the films all linked up through VR.\" Another bash at the lucrative beat'em-up market will see Atari stabbing at the buckets of blood punters. Ultra Vortex has the look and large sprites of 3DO's Way Of The Warrior. HIGHLANDER JAGUAR Following the success of the animated Highlander series in the US, Atari have snapped up the licence. Early impressions liken it to the highly successful and influential Alone In The Dark series, but as we said, it is early days. HIGHLANDER (June) "

The first testing turn is as you go through the mountain and you have to make a quick turn to the left for the tunnel section.

"CVG REVIEW 5231/40 REPLAY DAYTONA WA 277 shte 6063000 to Daytona vs Hulge-racer 5/20 U LU OK, so what's best, eh? Ridge Racer or Daytona? It's a thorny one, but CVG have the answer. So read on, find out, then complain if you disagree... WUS302AS CONDITION Back to the question that's going to crop up for time in memoriam, and that is if you put Daytona head-to-head with Ridge Racer which one is the bestest? Here goes... 290 TE THE TRACKS Daytona certainly has more tracks, though you could say that Ridge sort of has three tracks as first off you've got your standard course, then you have the extra twiddley twirly winding section which isn't that detailed followed by the mirror mode. There's no getting away from the fact that Daytona has three in fact totally separate courses that are all very different indeedy, which surely adds to the playability and longevity factor of the game. So THE CARS There's not much difference here as in both games what you lose in grip you gain in speed. Daytona does have a novel car when you've completed all the tracks, it's only one horse power though! What gives Daytona the edge though is that you can ram the other cars, which gives it a big plus over Ridge Racer when it comes to realism Sega come out top there. makes up for the lack of clarity though, is the detail present on all of the tracks. Daytona in that more tracks makes this game so much more interesting to play. The collisions and other opponents are far more aggressive and courses are far more ingenious. THE SOUND The engine noises in Daytona are somewhat gutsier than ir sier than in Ridge Racer, but it has to be said that the music in Ridge is far better than the 'Blue, blue, skies' ditty you have to put up with in 'Tona. 1/2 6533 OKT 30/30 ON YER HEAD JEFF On track three, as you pull up to the statue if you have a fiddle with your joypad you'll be able to make Jeffry perform some basic gymnastics. Clever, eh? THE GRAPHICS Certainly Ridge Racer looks far smoother than Daytona far smoother than Daytona as the clipping destroys the illusion of reality. The screen redraw looks as if there's a bunch of Scene shifters putting up t he scenery as you're driving along. What THE PLAYABILITY This is of course the $64, 000 question, but I have to come down in favour of IT'S A VICTORY LAP FOR YOU AM2 Come first and you're treated to a customary victory lap cut scene, not only this but you get to see a naff picture of the programming team. kongratulations : 30/30 33085 ID 31 20 "

In the end I took to it more than Ridge Racer, despite its slighly jerky update and hideous soundtrack. SATURN Daytona drives like a dream, which is why it's a winner. Playability alone won't sell a next generation machine just look at Tempest on the Jag. So games on your Saturns and PlayStations have got to look state-of-theart. Although the clipping somewhat lets it down, the rest of Daytona's graphics are sublime. The soundtrack becomes irritating, but the car's engine has a real roar to it and the crashes are smashin'. The competive racing element is pitched just right and once you pick up that joypad you'll be after personal bests from the word GO. GARY LORD GRAPHICS MUSIC EFFECTS 96 PLAYABILITY 97 REALISM 95 VALUE Where've they all gone? playing Catch-up 30/30 RUN WHITE HORSES On track number three you'll notice there's a field of horses. Now if you've ever gone for a walk in the country then you'll have noticed signs about not \"mithering sheep' (especially in Wales) or horses and the like, since you've probably never moved away from the front of your new Saturn. Well worry not, because in Daytona you can mither all the horses you like. Just drive after them, go on, try and run them over, and don't worry since it's not real! They're only virtual 'orses. And you can drive one later in the game too! MARK PATTERSON Although Daytona is nowhere near as polished as Ridge Racer, it does play better, mainly because you can ram the other cars off the track and smas your own car up.

That's yours, that is because you can't afford a Saturn. VERDICT NO ACTION MAN Deadalus is one of those games which had plenty of potential, but sadly that's how it's destined to remain. It's like a football match, but with only one team, which is made up completely from refs, and no fans like at a Wimbledon game. In fact, there's almost no action, just check out these shots if you don't believe us. SATURN It's not that Deadalus is a bad game, it's just dull. Kind of like the Saturn equivalent of Douglas Hurd, but without the silly hair. Technically there's no faulting this game. The scrolling's smooth, there's no ridiculous loading time and the controls are easy to use. But games like this usually depend on floods of enemy creatures attacking you to keep the pulse racing and the action flowing. Sadly that element is not here and the game suffers as a result.

VERDICT PLAYSTATION Fans of the coin-op will probably go out and buy this game for their new PSX, and no doubt when they sit down and blast away for a few hours it will hit them that, well, Starblade isn't all that good. Its simplistiic graphics keep the game uncomplicated and fast, but the problem is that it just doesn't have much playability and long term appeal.

Dear CVG, Please tell Darryl Still (marketing manager of Atari UK) BULLOCKS. BULLOCKS the Jaguar is on a par with PSX and Saturn. I own a 3DO and a Jaguar, and the 3DO is superior in all aspects (bar price). Never mind comparing the Jag to PSX/Saturn, it's not even as good as 3DO. The Jag is crap, so I'm selling it. There are less than five playable games available, there is even less than that planned (Mortal Kombat 3 wow), the joypad is shoddy, games are expensive and unoriginal. The 3D0 is far, far better than the Jag. I don't care what Mr Still says, 300. PSX and Saturn are streets ahead, so stop trying to compete. Their software and hardware is out of your league, mate. Ex-Atari fan, Lancs. yes, we have no bananas 3 BUY THE ONE THAT YOU LIKE THE MOST. These people that write asking which to buy, exactly what do they do with the magazine? They obviously don't read it, because if they did they'd be able to form an opinion of their own. Do they write to Fashion Weekly and ask which pair of socks they should put on? Or write to World Soccer asking which football team they should support? As for those people who ask if they should buy an Ultra 64 no comment. Matthew Withers, Crewe, Cheshire.

I've just bought it and, to be honest, I'd rather have spent my money going to zoo to watch real monkeys expose their bottoms and throw crap at each other. Devon Walsh, Mile End Dear CVG, I am writing in reply to the letter from Darryl Still, marketing manager of Atari UK, printed in the May issue of CVG. Contrary to what was written, it is universally acknowledged that The Jaguar is not as powerful as either the Saturn or the PlayStation. in fact, the hardware found within the Jaguar finds the competition from both the 3DO and 32x, more than a match when it comes to producing quality software. The technical inadequacy of the Atari machine is not as important as the games it plays. Software sells hardware, and this is where the Jaguar has its biggest failing. In almost 18 months only 17 cartridges have been released. More than anything, these Jaguar Eames simply do not look or play any different from the best games available on the 16-bit consoles. Worst still, the CD-ROM add-on for the Jaguar contains no additional hardware chips, and the line-up of games is equally short in supply and lacklustre in quality. Like Darryl, I would like to make a comparison between the console market and that of the Formula 1 circuit. Much like Ferrari, Nintendo has the pedigree, status and ability to become world champions again. Meanwhile Sony mirror the Williams setup, with the most powerful machine and the most money to spend. Sega have the slickest package and the most dynamic marketing, Similar to that of Bennetton. Whilst Atari have the history of Lotus. A former number one whose glory days have gone. Anthony Stevens, Southend, Essex CVG: Appropriate surname there, Matthew CVG: Hmm, we suppose if scatological primates are your thing, you're probably right. CVG: Just two of the two letters we received disputing Darryl's claims. Le ballon sont arrives dans your court, Mr Still, and your legions of loyal Jag owners. If you'd like to contact us, perhaps we could arrange a big scrap. 25 "


"CVG REVIEW TEKKEN PlayStation TEKKEN 26 "


"REVIEW CVG SIITSU PLAYSTATION Namco Beat-'em-up  PC CD-ROM version planned No other versions available A The picture to the left is way more interesting. Check out that big pointy sword! Wahey! Some beat-'em-ups come as quickly as they go, but then there are the ones that stay and stay: your Street Fighters, Mortals and Shodowns, but now with the onslaught of the next generation consoles there's going to be another one to add to that ever-increasing ist, and believe us when we say that this one's definitely a stayer... ekken is the product of five years of con stant one-onore beat-'em-up experimentation. Instigated by the how-legendary Street Fighter II, Scourge of tabloids and Newsround a ke. these games revialised the arcade business, drawing untold billions of new customers into the ang glue-haze atmosphere of these sinister backstreet dens (or nice, clean, mod. ern places, depending). Since then every company has had a pop at developing a Street Fighter beater. Some have been as popu lar, such as the infamous Mortal Kombat and its even bigger sequel. Others have been more violent and destructive, such as Samurai Shodown or Capcom's new X-Men title. And some have been more innovative, like Sega's awesome Virtua Fighter. But now we've got Tekken, which is all of these things, and also contains all the combo-led super-depth expert-potential playability that made an art out of playing Street Fighter. The only element of modern computer thumpery absent is the notion of projectile attacks, which is a pretty good thing, since they tend to clutter up the action by preventing players from getting close enough for any proper fisticuffs. Apart from that every character has a large and varied arsenal of manoeuvres. Blocking incoming hits, that old standard, is achieved by pulling back on the D-pad (providing you're at the correct height). Getting past a block is a simple matter of performing a throw, preventing anyone from just standing still and defending when they've got a crucial energy advantage and time is running out. What raises Tekken above the norm is ARE THERE SIX ELEPHANTS OR FOUR? Tekken is not only a newcomer to the PlayStation but also to the arcades. So in the interests of you, the noble reader, we decided to spend lots of money in Funland arcade playing the coin-op version in order to compare it to the supposedly identical) PSX version. Playability wise, there are absolutely no deficiencies. Namco have included every nuance of the coin-op's gameplay, as well as adding new features detailed elsewhere. The graphics, however, are slightly off. While the animation is as smooth and complex as that of its counterpart, the PlayStation can't quite handle some of the more lavish costumes. Thus, sadly, Law's spare track suit looks even more Mr Byrite than before. 22 "


"CVG SHOWCASE KAZUYA Kazuya has entered the tournament for more cash than the (admittedly substantial) prize money. See, he's heir to the megahuge corporation sponsoring the tournament, and he's hoping daddy will pop-off a bit faster if he wins. As the final bout nears, Kazuya realises who he has to fight Wang, MD of the Mishima Corporation! Once Kazuya tops the old duffer (no mea feat, he's pretty sprightly), the final fight is against the evil CEO! Once he's top of the management tree, Kazuya throws his unconcious would-be boss over the edge of a handy cliff, thereby claiming his inheritance. That Anna is Nina's sister, you know. It's true, you find out at the end. He says, ruining the surprise. However, she's in possession of a fine selelction of mega-kick combos which are quick to hit and frequently knock down the unfortunate recipient. the way these elements have been implemented and blended. The characters are the main strength. There are eight key protagonists, each one varying wildly in their advantages and disadvantages. And just to illustrate this point, we're going to detail the details below. sadly Kazuya always needs to take a run up or pull back his fist, giving his opponent plenty of time to pop in a quick fist before Kboy can swing. Paul's face, because he's not real. And if he was, his repeated kick specials and charging punches would probably dissuade you from taking the matter any further. plement of very dangerous throws, although his puny legs deliver rather pathetic kicks. JACK Like most giant Russian androids Jack is immensely strong but rather an unwieldy type. Most effective up close, Jack has a large comPAUL After Guile, Jacky and now Paul you'd think people actually wore their hair in that ridiculous style. Still you wouldn't say that to NINA Like most girlie fighters, Nina is nimble but weak. KAZUYA Possessor of the fiercest attacks in the game, but KING King takes quite a lot of practice to play properly. Most of his attacks are single powerful hits, with nary a decent combo in sight. If you've got the skill to keep a foe on their toes he's brillaint, but you'll have to be sure of your abilities. YOU'VE BEEN MAIMED While 3D camera angles aren't new, Tekken makes a meal of them. The viewpoint flicks around to follow the action and keep the characters on a horizontal footing. However, every time a grab or throw is instigated the Tekken camera moves in for a close-up of the ace animation. And if you're playing in one-player you can switch between three views and elevations with a press of the Select button. And if that isn't enough, you could always turn your telly on its side for amazing vertical fighter action. YOSHIMITSU Despite the heavy metal suit of armour he wears, Yoshi is probably the fastest A Looks like Law is going to need an elastoplast on that nasty cut. He'll blub if you use TCP though. 28 "


"REVIEW CVG JACK character in the game. And his sword doesn't come into play all that much, as most of his best specials are rapid kick combos. Block one hit of these, however, and you can beat him to a pulp while he tries vainly to complete the move. Jack hasn't actually entered the tournament himself. His Russian government creators are merely using this excuse to test their latest android soldier hardware. Jax will get a change of oil if he wins. Ooh, those sneaky tournament organisers have pitted Jack against the new-model prototype, Metal Jack, with a blender for a hand. Which android is the best? Once Jack has proven his superiority to the relevant authorities full production of a Jack army is commenced. Aieee for the world! LAW A bit of an all-rounder is our Law. Skilled with both punches and kicks although weak with throws) the only real let down on his side is the comparitive lack of damage his blows cause. One for typewriterskilled button-bashing merchants MICHELLE The most politically correct character in any game, Michelle is both female and, as a native American, a member of a disadvantaged ethnic minority. She also has uncanny Sioux wrestling skills, which make her top with throws. Now you've met the gang it's time to get the hang of the rules. Each match is fought on a bestof-three basis, with a time limit placed on each round although both these constraints are player adjustable). Unlike most 3D games, there are no physical constraints to the actual fighting environment. However, as your characters move further apart the camera scales out, to give an illusion of a huge massive playfield when it is, in fact, not infinite at a . Once you're good enough to fight your way to the end you'll notice something else different about the characters each one has their own individual boss before the very final chap. A boss programmed specifically to exploit the weaknesses of your character. Ha ha. And that, at the end of the day, is that. The rest is all down to learning how to handle your favourite character and, preferably, all the others so you'll know what to expect of them in combat. Good luck, young Jedi. YOSHIMITSU Yoshimitsu has a slightly unfair advantage, thanks to his suit of armour and large sword, but that's allowed because he's a criminal diverting attention away from his gang stealing the prize money. Sadly for Yoshimitsu, Ganryu the Sumo is just too fat for any sword to penetrate. Also watch out for his sumo slap combos, which are almost impossible to get out of Get to the end and you discover, why, Yoshimitsu isn't a criminal at all, he's distributing all the loot to the poor! And in the crowd it's Law, Michelle and baby Tekken grasp ing the free cash! 29 "


"CVG SHOWCASE KING A masked Mexican priest, King, is using his religious leopard powers to claim the prize money for his orphanage. Although beating people to a pulp doesn't seem too charitable to us. It appears there's more than one Mexican priest in a big cat mask out for the cash, and this one's wearing armour Perhaps he's a Satanist. Win and good old King goes and gives all the cash for the poor wickle orphans, so they can all lead lives of luxury. Until they leave the orphanage, completely unprepared for normal life. Here Jack is pitted against his mortal enemy, a big. ger and more heavily armoured version of himself. Suddenly, Nina's giant elbow felled both fighters. HEAD-TO-HEAD-TO-HEAD Tekken has some serious competition in the ninja-like shapes of Toh Shin Den and Virtua Fighter. But if these games are ninjas, Tekken is a fully powered-up Megazord martial arts robot, complete with Power Ranger pilots. While Tekken is closer to VF than TSD, relying more on close-quarters combo dealing than projectiles and longerranged fisticuff attacks, it thrashes the Saturn's hide. This is because of the feel of the game. Every punch and kick registers with a solid, satisfying snap, and the grotesque sounds of bones being broken during throws adds to the atmosphere of extreme violence. While the characters may lack the design polish of Toh Shin Den, the animation is way more lifelike and the controls equally more responsive. Basically, Tekken is probably the best beat-'em-up ever anywhere. 9999 Jack seems to be getting a rough time of it again. B5703 30 "


"REVIEW CVG LA VIE) STOP PRESS BRILLIANCE OF CVG Each character in Tekken faces their own personal penultimate boss. But what we haven't mentioned is that you can play the game as any of them! The cheat for this wondrousness is simple enough just complete TEN levels of Galaga without missing a single alien. You'll be able to select a boss by moving off the side of the character select screen. Alternatively, when the hits total appears after a round just press Select, Start, Select and you're given another go. VERDICT The bosses in PSX Tekken have all-new move and throws not even seen in the coin-op! Plus, the ace-looking rendered endings for each character are Sony-only too! What a bonus! THE HEAD-TOHEAD TEAM VERDICT MARK PATTERSON This is simply the most perfect, fully rounded beat-'em-up on any system. And now I've become a master of King's 10-hit combo, I'm almost unbeatable. At last, real power! PLAYSTATION Tekken combines the special moves intensity of Toh Shin Den with the close-quarters skill requisites of Virtua Fighter or, dare I say it, Street Fighter. Most combos depend upon the use of specials in conjunction with perfect timing and almost telepathic preempting of your opponent's strategy. As a result it's as impressive to watch as it is to play. The camera constantly flicks to the most attractive angle, and while this is unobtrusive when playing it makes for an attractive spectator sport as the two combatants wade right in and start smacking the hecky out of one another. Needless to say Tekken requires loads of practice to mas. ter, and if you can complete it on Ultra Hard mode then big yo'speck indeed. Buy this game! RAD AUTOMATIC SIMON CLAYS What can I say. Tekken is the Harrods of beat-'em-ups. When I saw Toh Shin Den I thought wow, but this is simply awesome. Brilliantly addictive and intuitive to boot 88 GRAPHICS 90 ANIMATION MUSIC FX PLAYABILITY 98 VALUE 94 93 OVERALL GARY LORD This is like Virtua Fighter 2 taken to the extreme. There are so many moves and tactics that you'll be playing this for months. And with 17 characters in total, who could ask for more? If Namco can ever produce a Tekken 2 Ultra Fighting Punching Faces edition, they'll be onto another winner. 31 "


"CVG PREVIEW WORK ZINPROGRESS MEGA-CD PROGRESS Unconfirmed Beat-'em-up JVC Bune confirmed Programmed by SNK initiated June '94 80% complete No other versions planned Game Boy and 3DO versions available Estimated release June/July .. Each character has their own victory spiel, which doesn't often make sense. YOU'RE NOT VERY OM. ETTER PATUTE NOT THAT BAIT. A Samurai Shodown fea. tures loads of background animations. FAT BOY IN THE HOUSE Samurai Shodown features possibly the motleyest crew of characters yet to disgrace a beat-'em-up. Every fighter looks like just the sort of person who'd go round to your gran's, drink her tea, turn the telly over and then eat the budgie. Our sort of people in fact, so let's just take a little piece of the page for you to have a gander at them. A Like all games of this ilk, Samurai Shodown is laden with spe. cial moves. A The weapons used range from normal swords to spears and even eagles. VOD DDD Last month the Mega-CD had one of the best 16-bit beat-'em-ups ever thrust upon it, next month it's going to get Samurai Shodown. Will it match up? We take a sneak peak to find out... We've said it before and we'll keep on saying it until someone slaps us and tells us to shut-up, but Samurai Shodown is one of the most underrated beat'em-ups ever. It doesn't offer any remarkable features there aren't any death moves, 3D effects or digitised characters, just good, solid gameplay. All the original features are in there, including the scaling effects which are an integral part of the game. What it has also are huge weapons, even bigger characters and plenty of style to separate from far more normal run-of-the-mill combat games. Unlike games such as Eternal Champions CD, it's a lot easier to pick-up and play Sam Shodown. The moves are straightforward, and easy to work out if you've ever played Street Fighter, and it's this simple, easy-to-grasp action that makes the game such a winner. The lack of variety was a problem on the other versions but, as ever, it's the two-player mode which compensates and we're sure that will be the major strength in this version. If it's even half as good as the coinop it'll still be a cracker. Ahar! Buckets o'blood, matey!  GAME BY SNK CONTACT JVC (0171-240 3121) FOR INFORMATION 32 "

"CVG PREVIEWS We like Core Design at CVG. Not because of any of the games they've put out recently, but because they're good old Tommy Britishers, supporting our fair isle in the jingoistic international games market! Hoorah! Britons never ever ever shall be slaves! Well, alright then, perhaps our favourable disposition has a teeny bit to do with the likes of Battlecorps and the wondrous SoulStar. But these days Core are progressing way beyond the somewhat limited confines of the Mega-CD and have taken their rather inspired approach to game design over to somewhat more capable formats. The lucky dog that's getting first dibs on the next brace of Core titles is the trusty old PC. Or rather, a big, brand new Pentium PC, if you want to get the most out of them. Not to mention, of course, all the VR hardware you'll need too. SOULSTAR 32X/JAGUAR EXPECTED RELEASE JULY SHELLSHOCK 32X/PC EXPECTED RELEASE JULY :0 YO. tanks is massive. In the area. Yes, this is your opportunity to take control of a gang of G-up homies from the \"hood, who've managed to get hold of a tank. Bored with blowing South Central LA to pieces the wigger-stylee crew have decided to end all war on the planet. By killing everyone. You play the part of new recruit, eager to make his (or her) bones, and your job is to pilot the tank and shoot things (so the rest of the team are obviously kept busy). Shellshock is already shaping up to be pretty smashing, so you can rest assured that we'll be covering it again darn soon. SoulStar proved somewhat popular with us games reviewing types when it was released on the MegaCD last year. Indeed, such is Core's faith in the product that they're even throwing a conversion in the sales mÃªlÃ©e that is the Jaguar market. But, good news for real people, this souped-up and revamped version is now also slated to hit the 32X. The basic gameplay is to remain intact, so it's still a 3D blast-fest with a selection of three gun-laden vehicles to control. This version, however, should feature smoother update, bigger sprites, more colours and generally all the adoring attention to detail 32-bits provide one with. With coding work nearing completion, a full review should follow soon, hopefully. THUNDERHAWK â€” THE NEW FRONTIER PC EXPECTED RELEASE JULY Sequel to the game that started it all, Thunderhawk 2 is, unsurprisingly, another helicopteresque combat title. However, this one is set eight billion years into the future, and as a result your chopper is somewhat more advanced in technology. And so should your PC be, too, for Thunderhawk Deux has been developed with full VR headset compatibility in mind. If you're the kind of old-fashioned fuddy-duddy living in the two-dimensional past you'll not be left out, but full-on cyberjocks of the new century will, hopefully, be able to experience real-time helicopter combat action in three amazing dimensions. There isn't an awful lot of the game itself to actually see at present, but what there is promises more tank-busting head-burning person shooting fun than even the original. There'll be a lot more on this one as soon as we can get hold of it.  GAMES BY CORE DESIGN CONTACT CORE (01332 297797) FOR INFORMATION 34 "

"CVG PREVIEW INPROGRESS PC CD-ROM Unconfirmed Platform Virgin Programmed by Amazing initiated 1992 90% complete No other versions available INo other versions planned, but expect super console versions Estimated release November Those inimitable French programmers Delphine have a new name and a new game; wait 'til you get a load of this... any of you out there in Gameland will remember the awesome Flashback and Another World. Both were converted to the majority of platforms and received rave reviews with practically every magazine, proclaiming then the new face of platforming. That, believe it or not, was back in 1992 and since then there's been very little heard of the French programmers who conceived the ideas. The reason for this is that both the programmers, now called Amazing Studio, and their publishers Virgin have been keeping their latest project shrouded in secrecy. Amazing claim that Heart of Darkness, three HEART OF years in development, picks up (graphics and gameplaywise) where Flashback and Another World left off. The plot stars a young boy called Andy, who, after run ning away from school one day, is surreptitiously kid napped by aliens and swept off to another dimension During each of the levels Andy can perform a wide repertoire of moves to help him through the bizarre alien world. In fact, to make Andy jump, run fire, shoot, swing, climb and swim takes a staggering 1,600 frames of animation. Heart of Darkness also features over 27 minutes of animations which cut in and out of play depending on events From what CVG has seen of Heart of Darkness to date it looks set to impress as much as Another World and Flashback did. The animated seguences have a real Disney quality about them and is a reflection of the amount of time that Amazing spent on developing the characters. The other departure from traditional platformers is the fact that every object on screen at any given time can be interacted with. This should make the problem solving aspect, which is an important part of that allimportant word 'playability, of Heart of Darkness that extra bit special. Being a CD-ROM title all the digitised speech and speaking parts are currently being cast by Virgin, and rumour has it that some big name celebrities are being lined up. The graphical style and playability of Flashback and Another World gets a true lick of paint for Heart of Darkness  GAME BY AMAZING STUDIO CONTACT VIRGIN (0181-960 2255) FOR INFORMATION 38 "

MACKAY G.VAN.DAM rible sports upon itself through time, but you'd have to go back a long, long way to find something as bad as cricket which was probably thriving at the time anyway. I mean, you can see the point in golf, as least you get a bit of a walk in the country with that one. But cricket, what's it all about, it all just seems to be about standing around in a field. And no-one ever wins, either. Even if one side get decimated by a million runs it's still a draw. All very British, yes, but not exactly the recipe for a nail-biting adrenalin frenzy of a game. A.

Or game, rather, because you'll still never have finished the first match. Let us save you some time it's going to be a draw. You won't win. Still, those of you with the tenacity or who shudder actually like cricket might like to know how this one plays. Well, obviously, we'd love to tell you, but sadly our version is just that little bit too early for us to say with any conviction. Look out for a full review next month. Umpires signal with their arms just like real life! LONGVIEW This might look like just another dull as ditchwater cricket game, but it is in fact the first example of Virtua sizing techniques on the SNES. Well, alright, perhaps that's a bit of a lie, but it does feature two amazing Virtua-style viewpoints. One close-up one for batting and bowling, and a second long-range shot. Once the ball gets thwacked boudary-wards the screen flicks out to an overview of the whole field so you can co-ordinate the semi-automatic efforts of your fielding team. Hooray.

"CVG PREVIEW PROGRESS Unconfirmed Beat-'em-up JVC Programmed by Jvc initiated october 194 80% complete No other versions planned Mega Drive, SNES versions available Imated release July ISNES ESTE GIOSE 03 Hages Well, here's a novelty. A one-on-one beat'em-up for the Mega Drive. Hmm. You can say what you like about the Mega-CD (as people frequently do in language too strong for a family magazine), but at least you don't have the same difficulty as the SNES when it comes to choosing from the millions of samey beat-'em-ups available. Well now Fatal Fury is coming along to change all that, and quite possibly to herald a new age of CD updates of some of your least-favourite fighting games. Can't wait for Art of Fighting CD. Or Tuff Use a number of attacks to cause damage to your foes. MULIN Fm WIL E Nuff CD. Or Golden Fighter CD. Hooray! But whilst we're waiting oh-so-eagerly for these future titles, let us console ourselves with the imminent arrival of this, an updated amalgamation of Fatal Furies 1 and 2. The casts of both games are fully present and correct, and even the bosses are player selectable from the off, so no use of any tiresome cheats for that. Each character has their own selection of special moves (surprise, surprise) along with their own strengths and weaknesses. Although it must be said they're strengths and weaknesses shared by hundreds of similar characters in dozens of similar games. But originality was never the big selling point for Fatal Fury anyway. So if you're a fan of strange joypad commands and lengthy victory catchphrases, you'll be wanting to read our review in the next issue. A gripping day in the life of those wacky fighters. THE INCREDIBLE STORY OF THE BOY IN THE BACKGROUND Oooooffyaaaaah! cerea se Despite its appearance, Fatal Fury pre-empted Virtua Fighter et al by some years. Not content with the standard two-dimensional gameplay on offer in most beat-'em-ups the programmers programmed their program in full, luscious 3D. Well, that is to say two levels of two dimensions each. If you're trapped in a corner, or on the receiving end of a kicking, your character can jump into the background, where the fight continues. This provides one with a lot more fighting space. Or at least the illusion of such. EER CREDO Hands up if you've already got Street Fighter 2. The character who loses all their energy first is the loser. 42 "

"FEATURE CVG The face of games is changing. Graphics which used to take an animator weeks to draw can be produced in a matter of hours and the results are more realistic. And the one title that shows just what is possible is set to revolutionise gameplay is Alien Trilogy. Just cop a load of this... TRILOG "


"CVG FEATURE Construcomarine ALIEN TRILOGY The process of taking an actor, motion capturing him and shoving the finished product into the game is ludicrously simple. An actor dressed in a black suit with around 65 reflectors attached, goes through his paces in the studio, where the film is automatically transferred to a Silicon Graphic Onyx workstation. Here it maps all the reflector points and then connects a rough frame around them. The next stage brings the bone rotation software into play, which calculates exactly how the character should move. Once that's done all that remains is to wrap a texture over them and bingo, one set of character animations ready to drop into a game. The same applies for the aliens, although, for obvious reasons, the human actors have to have various appendages strapped to them, otherwise they wouldn't look much like aliens, would they? act: actors and games don't mix well. Interactive movies just don't work, but let ting actors loose in a motion capture studio to create proper in-game graphics, well that's a different prospect. Comparing motion capture to normal computer game graphics is like comparing movies to a zoetrope there's more than a world of difference. When CVG visited Acclaim's headquarters in up-state New York, we found out just how far this technology had come. 20 minutes was the key figure. That's all the time it took to produce a perfect 10-second animation using one actor and two production staff one of whom spent most of the time explaining to us how it all worked. More than just the static character, they'd actually dropped him into a fully scalable backdrop and had the finished article running on an SGI machine through a PlayStation and Ultra 64 emulator simultaneously. Interestingly enough, it look best on the Ultra but then all the emulator does is switch off various elements of the workstation so it runs at a similar specification. It's also an expensive prospect. So far Acclaim have had to relocate their headquarters into a building with a custom-built studio in the basement and buy up a medical company, Biomechanics, who were working on specialist software for limb injuries. But the investment looks like it's going to pay off. So far Acclaim make more money than almost a ny other software house, something which they're looking to double next year. The question is, what does all this mean for us? Well, looking at the kind of stuff they're developing at the moment, we're in for some great games. No more so than Alien Trilogy... THE ALIENS ARE COMING By far the most impressive use of motion capture so far is going into Acclaim's forthcoming Alien Trilogy. The game's based on all three movies, and combines Doom-style action with remarkable 3D graphics. Currently the game's Currently the game's been in development for nearly three years now, and this is where some of the problems with the technology come into play. The motion capture studios themselves are actually based at is based loosely on all Acclaim's HQ in New three films, the game York, while most of the designers have plenty of game is being pro material to work with. grammed by Probe Basically what they're Software, who are based trying to do is combine in sunny Croydon. the atmosphere from the Because Alien Trilogy first film, with the action 46 "


"FEATURE CVG 000 The finished graphics are nothing short of astounding and take up less memory than sprites! Alam and suspense of the second. Hopefully they'll give up trying to incorporate anything from the third The static screenshots on their own look impressive enough, but when you actually see the graphics running, they're nothing short of mindblowing. Naturally, this restricts the game to CD formats, with Saturn, PlayStation and PC CDROM versions of the game currently planned. From a developer's point of view it can't be the easiest thing in the world when your graphics team are based halfway around the world, but everything's starting to come together at last and it looks as though we could be seeing the game before the year's out. This technology is so powerful and flexible, and the results so impressive, that it's attracted interest from film producers. In fact, some of Batman Forever's special effects were produced at the motion capture studios, although Acclaim won't let on as to which scenes use it. It's conceivable that, for some of the stunts at least, it was used to replace a stuntman's features with those of one of the actors. From Acclaim's point of view, this is excellent, as they hold the complete rights to this form of motion capture technology. However, there is potential for them to licence it out to other developers, but you can bet they'll only do that after making a killing from it themselves. Because of the quality and detail motion capture graphics gives, Acclaim are sticking firm ly with big name licences. This gives them access to a huge amount of resources when it comes to producing the game and also let's them cash in on what hype-wagon has been rolled out. From a business point of view it all makes sense, but somehow it's disturbing when a company openly admits that they go for a big-name licence over original product. As Acclaim's chairman Greg Fishbach admits \"We won't touch a product, regardless of quality, if we don't think we can sell it.\" It's a bullish attitude which has so far been responsible for some of the biggest, and worst games of the last couple of years. But with a current portfolio boasting, Judge Dredd, Batman For Ever, Alien Trilogy and forthcoming swashbuckler Cutthroat Island, who's going to be against Acclaim being anything less than massive in '96? 47 "


"CVG FEATURE TRILOGY 5*S JE Sior This brief Spiderman demo shows the potential for producing full animated productions using motion capture. 4lom Batman Forever looks like it's going to be very good. These pics are taken from the SNES version. BATMAN 05 Batman Forever Once a face is scanned it's a relatively simple process to map it over a pre-captured shape. Making use of the more conventional greenscreen character digitising technology is Acclaim's forthcoming Batman Forever. Licensed from the up-coming movie, Acclaim have put the platform engine that powered Stargate and Judge Dredd behind them and opted for something more akin to Mortal Kombat II. The graphics have all been digitised using green screen technology, where the actors are filmed against a single colour background, cut out and dropped into the game. 48 "


"FEATURE CVG The Duel This was actually the first demo Acclaim showed of the potential of their motion capture system. All it is, simply, is a bundle between a demon and a rather muscly looking bloke. It wasn't so much the detail of the graphics that made people's jaws drop, but the faultless animation. A full 3D scan of a face takes just under 20 seconds. The guy on the screen on the left is Frank Thomas, baseball hero and star of Acclaim's forthcoming Frank Thomas 'Big Hurt' Baseball.

"REVIEWS CVG reviewed this month... GER@ O KUN t last there's an end to the Street Fighter vs Mortal Kombat conundrum Tekken beats the beans out of both of 'em. It really is the apex of fighting game design and a good proportion of my time this month has been spent by furtive practice sessions. Mind you, it's been a good month for quality software, with Full Throttle and the amazing Flight Unlimited both giving Namco's PlayStation star a run for its money. And 16-bit owners are well catered for with Alien Soldier and Megaman X2 both offering plenty o thrills. But why don't you just read about them yourself, eh? mc marky boyeee junglemania, editor What we're playing this month This month's hot-hits Tekken p.26 MARK Flight Unlimited/PC The PC further advances its reputation as a games for mat to be feared and respected with the release of this absolutely stunning simulator. A truly splendid piece of software. Full Throttle/PC I love LucasArts and their wacky games, but Full Throttle is tops even by their (high) standards. A great mix of graphics, gameplay and humour without getting bogged down by feeble jokes. Tekken/PSX I wasn't sure this would be too great, but once I started playing it I was amazed to find that it very nearly is too great for my feeble pie. strained heart. An awesome game. Just ace. RAD Tekken/PSX It's the best beat-'em-up ever. What with all the moves and combos and face-pasting to be had. Daytona/Saturn This game features the most brain-splittingly execrable soundtrack I've ever had the misfortune to suf. fer. The game's absolutely great though. Alien Soldier/Mega drive Treasure are gaming gods amongst men and this, the final release of their earliest effort, is smart stuff. Here at CVG we don't give high scores away lightly. A game has to be special before it scores 90% or over and a CVG Hit!. Even rarer is a CVG Gold (awarded to games that have pushed back the boundaries of gaming) but don't expect many of these as it takes a score of 95% or over to earn one. Anyway, here are the top games this month... 298 SGS Daytona p15 15 Daytona USA/Saturn 26 Tekken/PlayStation 60 Micro Machines 2/Game Gear 72 Street Fighter 2/PC 76 Full Throttle/PC CD-ROM 79 Slam 'N' Jam/3DO 80 Illusion Of Time SNES 84 Fever Pitch/SNES 94 Flight Unlimited/PC CD-ROM Ing type get his own title at last. Daytona/Saturn Forget the grainy graphics and terrible soundtrack, once you take the time to get to know Daytona you'll love and treasure it forev. er. Not so polished as Ridge Racer, but definitely more playable. Tekken/PSX I'm not normally the beat'em-up sort, but Tekken is just so superb that I've renounced my non-violent ways completely. GARY Chaotix/32X I always preferred Knuckles' dreadlocked and dispropor. tionately jointed cool to Sonic's wirybacked smugness, so it's great to see the lit. tie ant-eatSIMON Wiggedy wiggedy wack, gamestrels, it's Simon the new kid here. I'm too new to have an opinion of my own, so I'm not going to say what my favourite three games are this month. I like whatever everyone else likes. Hopefully my indoctrination course of injections and brainwashing should be finIshed by next month, so I'll tell you then. Viva Gamos, god of Games!

For consistency's sake, games retain the original scores in alternative boxes. "

Interestingly enough, both Alien Soldier and Gunstar Heroes were developed for Sega by Treasure. ISSUE 142: 92% Try doing this with your eyes closed LIEK VERDICT TEAM VERDICT MARK PATTERSON Big sprites, big everything really, apart from impact. It's not that Alien Soldier is in any way poor, it's just that we've seen plenty of practically identical titles that came out a while ago. Still, looking at the pluses, Alien Soldier's a pretty solid boss battler that has some nice graphical touches. GARY LORD MEGA DRIVE This is a a well worn genre and there aren't many roads forward. Alien Soldier doesn't exactly build a new orbital motor way, but it does lead you down quite an interesting B road. Basing play on boss fighting isn't a new idea, but Alien Soldier does quite a tidy job of delivering the goods. Alien Soldier will take any budding sadist a lot of determination to complete, my only worry is that your blood lust may dry and your interest shrivel into repetitive stress syn. drome before you kill that final infernal boss. SIMON CLAYS AMWAY The bosses are all well animated hard little suck. ers who take some time and some sussing out to kill, giving the game that 'I must finish this' feel. Oh and there's ome nice endof-level geezers to take out all your frustration on into the early hours. RAD AUTOMATIC GRAPHICS 79 SOUND 77 PLAYABILITY 80 VALUE 74 OVERALL It builds on the tradition that was Gunstar Heroes of taking the bosses and completely expanding them exponentially. The only thing that Alien Soldier really seems to lack is pace. Very rewarding, hard and ground breaking don'tcha think. I I like it and I'd buy it. 57 "


"CVG REVIEW Shoot-'em-up Game Tek Unconfirmed Out June No other versions available No other versions planned SNES 0002 LIVES Big choppers. Ahahahaha. That's funny. Big choppers. Snigger. WHODU OOOOOO HOZU COMO DOLORO Muda ULOGADO BOUVON XOUR 2. ir Cavalry. That's a bit of stupid name isn't it? I mean, the word cavalry is the common name for horse-mounted riding troops, having little to do with aviation in any fashion whatsoever. So unless this is a game about sword-wielding old-time soldiers gliding through the skies on Pegasuses the chosen titular moniker is rather off-target. And there isn't a winged horse to be seen in this game. They should have called it some thing more appropriate, like Air SUN Fighting or Sky Shooting. Might not have the same ring, admittedly, but it's a lot more accurate. So equestrian fans are going to be disappointed, this much we know. But what about blasting fans? Will they be kept happy? Well, the SNES hasn't really seen many titles of this ilk in recent months, so it's likely that anyone desperate enough for a helicopter-bound frenzy of doom-dealing may well start to get a bit excited anyway. They'll be running around the room pretending to be Stringfellow Hawke from Airwolf and putting an eyepatch on their dog to make it look like the agency boss from the same show. And we're not about to argue. 2.75 ROCKET Has anyone played Mario Kart? That's got nice Mode 7. VERDICT CANNON SNES Three years ago Air Cavalry might have aroused my curiosity slightly, but in these days of Tekkens and Daytonas a bit of jerky Mode 7 doesn't really doesn't cut the mustard I'm afraid. It'd be all right if there was any real playability to it, but there simply isn't. There's just a lot of seemingly aimless flying around and using the computer-targeted weapons to destroy unthreatening-looking tanks and trucks. Not something I can bring myself to recommend. RAD AUTOMATIC ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE Urban Strike EA/.99 The third instalment in Electronic Arts' hugely popular helicopter shoot'em-up series. Not as good as Jungle Strike but still a damn good blast nonetheless. ISSUE 156: 82% A Hey mum, check out this new game I programmed, it's really neat. I'm just going to kill myself. GRAPHICS 64 SOUND PLAYABILITY 45 VALUE 49 OVERALL TWO BIG CHOPPERS Now you might be looking at this thinking 'Hmm, looks like a regular 3D flying shooting game to me. Lots of Mode 7 and that's all', but you'd be wrong. Because Air Cavalry features not one but TWO two-player modes. These put you and your friend in the same war-zone environments as the single-player option and allow you to either co-operate to banish evil from the world or conspire to blow each other to bits. The competitive two-player mode is definitely the best way to play, if you ask us. GAME BY GAMETEK CONTACT GAMETEK (01753 533445) FOR INFORMATION 58 "

"CVG REVIEW Platform Capcom .00 Out Now (import No other versions available No other versions planned SNES 1122 | Megaman saves the world again. After he's drawn his pension, I mean he is getting on a bit now you know. A As usual, you can pick which stage you try, but the set order is always easiest. A Megaman is about to become Deadman. A Check out that groovy new costume. he games industry is in crisis. But it's not escalating cart prices, format saturation or the mysterious disappearance of Tails the Fox that's causing the trouble. It's game designers, not foreseeing the popularity and longevity of the scene, have peaked too early, bottoming out of ideas. Every software house has run dry of new ways to title sequels. Turbo, Jet, Super, X, O, even trusty old numerals, each of these rich sources has been mined to its full potential and exhausted. Even now, in a time of Super Turbo Editions and X2s, top scientists are working to develop new ways to distinguish the titles of sequels from one another. Use of fruit. runes and endangered species have been discussed, but for now follow-up monickers will continue to become more cumbersome and ridiculous until the year 2000. Which is Dr Wily's latest evil plan, and the only man who can save our sanity is our hero, Megaman. As player, your job is to guide Megaman against Wily and his subordinates, smiting their plot once and for all. Obviously there's a great platform jungle filled with enemy robots between you and each boss, with the theme of the level decided by the special powers of the foe waiting at the end. Luckily Megaman is able to leap, dash, scale walls and shoot things all skills you'll have to master before finishing a level.

"REVIEW CVG SECOND OPINION Frankly, I'm starting to get a bit fed up with the millions of platform games launched in the wake of Donkey Kong Country. Sure, most of them are great, but there are already loads of great SNES platformers, and these new additions just seem to be cluttering up the selection. Still, if you're in the market for this sort of thing you can't knock Megaman X2. Slick, professional and highly enjoyable. Again. GARY LORD AA super plasma bolt. A big jump. D Only the sartorially redundant couldn't notice that Megaman, intergalactic hero though he is, has been wearing the same costume for some years now and it's starting to look badly out of date. But don't worry, for top designers have slaved night and day to create a new catwalk vision for Megaman, if he can find it. See, it's split into a number of pieces and secreted in certain levels of the game. If you can collect all the bits, Megaman is endowed with amazing extra powers of speed, as well as having even better attacking capabilities. And a nice new hat. A Use the jump button repeatedly to climb walls. VERDICT man x2 SNES The SNES has recently seen a return to the old traditions of platform/ blasting action last seen when the machine was still new to these shores. While that's no bad thing, it means that some, however good, are destined to be left on the shelves. Megaman X2 could be one of those titles. While it's playable and tough it just doesn't exhibit the originality or variety of titles such as Hagane. If you're a follower of the series doubtless you'll want to add this to your collection, but otherwise you'd better shop around. RAD AUTOMATIC GONE ON YOU ARSENAL Every time Megaman defeats a boss he's able to sequester their personal special weapon. Aside from the obvious satisfaction gleaned from controlling a mega item which was previously being turned against you, these power-ups are seriously ace and normally help with the quashing of the next boss up. Highlights include the Crystal, which encases enemies in giant frozen blocks which Megaman can use as platforms, the Bubble Gun which fires a stream of floating translucent bomb bubbles and the Burner, which blasts a huge wave of flame at the almost unfortunate wrongdoer, followed by several ground-hugging fiery aftershocks. Perhaps unsurprisingly this last goodie is held by the final boss before Wily himself, and is very hard to get hold of indeed. GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 86 PLAYABILITY 84 VALUE 89 ALTERNATIVE SNES Hagane Virgin Graphically this may not look like a ground-breaking game, but it has all the hallmarks of a great Nintendo title: non-stop action and a difficulty level that is T.O.U.G.H.

"CVG REVIEW Platform Sega Unconfirmed Out June No other versions available No other version plann 32X PLAYER SELECT THE FAB FIVE Forget Mark, Robbie, the fat one, and the other two: there's a new 'Fab Five' in town! Knuckles has brought four new mates into his ESPIO THE CHAMELEON 32-bit adventure... KNUCKLES: he seems to have forgotten his past as a Sonic bad guy, and has inherited some of his blue rival's skills too. His spinning attack is devastating, and he is also rather adept at climbing walls and gliding across huge chasms. CHARMY BEE: the only character who can fly (useful for lifting heavy characters out of danger). VECTOR: a crocodile-like thing yet to evolve into a handbag. Extremely fast, and also equipped with a spin attack. MIGHTY: a dull armadillo with the same-ish moves as Knuckles. What did you expect from an animal with no redeeming factors in real life. ESPIO: A chameleon with a spin power which sends him into the air, well above the ability of his mates. He can also run up walls. Hooray! It's a new Sonic game for the 32X! Hold on, if it's a Sonic game, shouldn't there be a hedgehog in it somewhere? t is a nightmare most pop stars face. Imagine the scene, you're the latest chart sensation, with your face leering out from countless teeny's bedroom walls, and your precise dance routines gracing Top Of The Pops and the Chart Show (sponsored by Twix) every week. However, while out touring and dancing to backing tapes in small halls, your support act have a hit with 'Boys and Girls' and *Park Life', and suddenly you're out on your ear, your second album fails, and you have to join Worlds Apart Oh, the ignobility of it all... And this is just what has happened to Sonic. There he was: Sega's most famous game icon, star of three huge-selling platformers, a pinball game and pants and vests, when all of a sudden a pink pretender gets equal billing on the world's first plug-thru cart. Then, as Sega 'rest' their spiky blue mate, Knuckles steps in through the back door to star in what is still billed as 'The First Sonic Game For The 32X'. Weird. Still, whilst Chaotix retains the pastel look of its Sonic-starring predecessors, and contains Badniks to kill and rings to collect, this is different from the usual loop-the-loop fare we have grown up with. Chaotix offers the player a very different control system which adds a new selection of (very marketable) mates for Knuckles to drag across the platform-laden play area. As they get to grips with an inertia-based system the pair, linked by chains and spinning around, try to get to the upper stages. In fact, this is such a large departure from the usual Sonic fare, perhaps Sega are using Knuckles as the risk-taker so save their blue mate's face if the game flops. No, surely not... chaotix 64 "

Ivo is at the end of each stage in a variety of clunky machines, and the usual procedure of bumping him on the head until he gives up follows. Except for some reason, he seems real easy to defeat here... $ denonton LEVEL WITH US The in-game levels are sprawling affairs, with five worlds split into five sub-levels (preceded by a smaller stage). The levels are based on a mix of technologically advanced stages, gaudy cityscapes and forestlands, with Knuckles and co whizzing past caterpillars fountains, conveyor belts etc. The levels include Botanical Base, Amazing Arena (inside a huge clock), and the watery Marina Madness and for variety, the levels switch between day and night for extra graphical touches. 1300 TIME 1'21\"50 RINGS BF97000 INCE BINE TORE 57400 TIME 0.07 78 F.NES12 133 LE A LLLLLLLL 109LESS Fame!

Whilst the same moves apply, Knuckles is attached to his partner by two rings and a chain. The player can switch between the two, choosing which character will lead the other. However, the ring slows the characters down as the other acts as a dead weight, but by spinning or throwing your partner, extra speed can be gained. Robotnik in ghostly apparition scandal.

REPLACE: replaces your character with the one PAUSE on the monitor. GRAB: Another subgame icon, makes grabbing goodies easier. INVINCIBILITY: I wonder? 32X Chaotix shows what the 32X can do: loads of sprite expansion, stunning sub-games and pas. tel shades, but the gameplay is lacking. Once you've got to grips with the control system you realise that the Badnik quota is low, and after a few worlds I was desper. ate for something to try my new-found skills on!

NOT REVIEWED Activating the kit change allows you to play cricket disguised as a satsuma. here's nowt like it, the breeze, the sun beating on your brow, the crack of leather on willow and a bar that's open all afternoon... that's cricket. Well, it would be if the weather ever knew what it was doing for more than half-an-hour and you didn't end up half-soaked. But, there's a light meter at the end of lunch thanks to Codemasters' Brian Lara Cricket. Mr Lara has become something of a phenomenon in the cricket world, and subsequently has been immortalised for eternity in videogame land. Using all the top teams, BLC allows you to recreate any one of the many England defeats suffered at the hands of the world's cricketing nations. To make proceedings realistic all the players' names are accurate, with the English names getting crap scores to match their crap world rankings. You can also dress them up in those Kerry Packer marmalade coloured outfits and even change the angle of play to see the collapse from a different viewpoint. It's also a pleasant surprise to see the West Indies resembling West Indians rather than anaemic albinos. Ultimately, cricket sims are never going to set the gaming world on fire because in an attempt to be realistic they become like real cricket, large periods of tedium interspersed with a moment of high drama. The gaming paradox being, the more realistic you make them, the duller they become. STE VERDICT LITS A Viewing from one of the angles can make life even more miserable for the batting side. A A wide?

Worth prac ticing with, though. VERDICT 32X Mortal Kombat II Acclaim/.99 A good and very close conversion of the ace coin-op, this features all the characters, secrets and juggle combos of everyone's favourite blood-spattered beat. 'em-up. We liked it a lot. ISSUE 160: 93% PC I wasn't holding out much hope for this version of Street Fighter, especially when I heard Capcom were farming out the conversion job to a third party. But I was just being a cynic, because, as it transpires, this is totally flaming groovy. The graphics are great, especially on a high-end machine, the sound is nearly exactly spot on and the game is exactly the same as the one in the arcades. This is probably the best conversion of SF2 yet, and definitely a top-ace, top dead-good buy for PC owners. RAD AUTOMATIC FEI LONG A Bruce Lee look-alike with big Denis Healy eyebrows, Fei Long is probably the most versatile of the new characters, although his lack of projectile abilities is a bit of a downer.

You might already have a couple of games like this, and it's not as good as Hagane, but still well worth a look. PC issue 162 193% At last techie anorak PC owners get to have some fun. Mortal Kombat Il is, whether you like it or not, totally excellent, and anyone with a compatible format should have a copy by now. And that includes PC people now. MEGA-CD issue 162 192% A big improvement over the cart original, which is saying something. Loads of options, features, secrets and general thrills. Some may be tiring of all this one-onone beat-'em-up business, but this is a great addition to the range. AMIGA issue 162 90% Probably the only alternative to Micro Machines the Amiga has mustered so far, and an original enough game in its own right. Super Skidmarks combines superb gameplay with some more superb gameplay to just be darn ace. 32X issue 160 187% Metal Head is a rare beast -a 32X robotbased blaster that you could never produce on a regular Mega Drive in a million years.

Better than the Mega-CD version. SNES issue 162 91% Wrapped in a shiny halo of aceness, Hagane is a return to simple principles of jumping, deathing and variety found in old classic platform shoot'em-ups. Rock hard, but worth persevering with. (See our tips spesh starting on page 104. Amusing and mildly diverting puzzle game which fails to capitalise properly on the licence, and is ultimately too frustrating to hold the attention. But it's a must for real hard core B&B fans (such as Rad) nonetheless. SNES issue 161 76% Disappointing platform shooter based on the equally unastounding Star Wars-wannabe movie. If it had been given a bit of pace and smoother action this could have been a laugh, but as it stands it's just a chore. MEGA DRIVE issue 161 89% Eschewing Sonic-esque speed for Mario-esque depth of gameplay, Asterix is a fine looking and fine playing platformer.

MEGA DRIVE issue 162 91% Theme Park has an enviable reputation in strategy game circles, which this cart version does nothing to diminish. A few options missing here and there, but otherwise an absolutely splendid and complete version of an ace title. Combining strategy and quick thinking with plenty o' action, The Firemen is one of those wacky Japanese one-off games which fractures a mould. Whilst not too difficult, The Firemen is a shoot'em-up with a difference and great fun to play. SNES issue 162 91% Neatly sidestepping the stigma of licensed platformerdom Ocean are fond of, Addams Family Values is an original and well thought-out RPG with bags of atmosphere. It's also got plenty of Zelda-style action to keep everyone happy. SNES issue 162 79% Despite the promise that is offered by the amazingly flexible central character, Spiderman is a bit too slow in movement and progress to make it brilliant. Not bad for an Acclaim platformer, but certainly not great. 74 "

A gecko lizard can run, jump, flick enemies with its tail, catch flies with its long tongue and stick to walls and ceilings with the aid of little suckers. Gex however, is a lazy little so-and-so who prefers to sit in front of the world's largest television and watch repeats of the A Team and Hawaii Five O than go out and do lizardy things. All this tube activity is not good for a young lizard, and soon our young hero is being scrutinised by the things that live on the other side of the TV screen. These things are led by the evil and nasty Res, who is the lord of the Media Dimension. Res wants Gex for a new mascot so he reaches through the TV screen and grabs him, dragging him into the depths of TV hell. The only way he can get out is to explore the Media Dimension and collect all the remote controls so he can turn off all the TVs there.

"CVG REVIEW Adventure LucasArts Unconfirmed Out June No other versions available No other versions planned PC CD-ROM full Strap on your helmet, straddle the throbbing beast and roar off into the sunset with LucasArt's latest adventure. ucasArts are trying to corner almost every genre in the games market. Platform games have been covered by the Super Star Wars trilogy, flight sims are taken care of by X-Wing and RPG/adventure creators cower before the words 'Monkey Island and Sam & Max'. Now they are looking to build upon the success of those titles and Day of the Tentacle with Full Throttle. To be honest, calling Full Throttle just an adventure game is doing it a disservice. It's more a combination of Tentacle and the Space Quest series with bits of Road Rash thrown in for good measure. In FT you assume the role of a large unshaven biker called Ben, who is the leader of a hard collection of gents known as the Polecats. Now all the Polecats seem to do is ride around stopping off at various drinking establishments to consume alcohol and arm wrestle each other. Then, one day, this blissful existence is shattered when Ben and co are framed for the murder of Malcolm Corley, head of Corley Motors: the biggest and bestest motorcycle manufacturers in the world. Fortunately, Ben manages to avoid capture, and this is where you take control of our hero. You have to help Ben find out who framed him and why. Now this isn't as easy as it sounds, as the Lucas guys have done everything in their power to leave difficult puzzles in your way. Also, the game is chock full of little references to other Lucas masterpieces such as 'Help us Ben, your our only hope', when our hero rescues a damsel in distress from a garbage can. Oh, and just in case I have gone and got you all worked up, you need at least 8 megs running on nothing less than a 33Mhz 486. OK, sol let you tie me down, but do you really have to wear the gas mask? MEET THE FAMILY.. Full Throttle is packed with characters so off-the-wall they've hid the floor and are now residing in hospital with a severe concussion. Here are a few of the friendly, and not so friendly faces you'll encounter. Malcolm Corley the head guy at Corley Motors and old biker. Unfortunately, he gets bumped off quite early in the game so don't get too fond of him. Ben our hero and leader of the Polecats. What can you say about a guy who has got a jaw line that strong?

"REVIEW CVG 3DO Basketball Sim Crystal O Dynamics/BMG EUnconfirmed Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned COS slama The latest title from Crystal Dynamics certainly captures the realism of a basketball court. Boom shack-a-lack! Yo my homie! Step up to the court and get down with some serious five on five slam dunkin' action... and jam '95 ersatile chaps these Crystal Dynamics people! Not content with producing shoot-'em-ups like Total Eclipse, or platform romps like Gex (elsewhere in this issue). Now they go and bring out one of the most exciting-looking basketball sims that I've seen for many a moon. The action is viewed from an end-of-court perspective which is similar to the old SNES game World League Basketball. You can select full season, mini tournaments or friendlies and there is the choice of all the American basketball teams with the proper names for the players. Play the full season, and go all the way to the NBA play-offs! The game also features full match commentary which lets you know about the rebounds, interceptions and penalties. The announcer is not above having a go at the players if they make a mistake or two during the game. Unfortunately, he does not swear (perhaps this could be considered for use in an adult-only version of the game). Each of the players have different attributes such as threepoint shooting, speed, stamina and so on. Also there are markers above each guy's head to show his position (centre, guard etc), this is handy for basketball novices as you learn to understand the game as you play it. HE SHOOTS, HE SCORES As in other basketball titles, each player has his own signature 'dunk when he scores. These are activated by pressing the shoot button and then pressing the D-pad in different directions. To demonstrate this, here are some dunks. But we won't tell you the key combos... HA!

One moment he's a typically impish, grubby schoolboy whose only worry is when he might get his latest copy of CVG, the next he's asked to consider riddles that have taxed mankind's brains for thousands of years. Questions like why exactly were the pyramids were built, and why wasn't there an outside toilet fitted if they were so smart? And why does Pammy Anderson's... Sorry, different pyramids. Anyway, as if this isn't enough to baffle a young lad, he faces yet another dilemma. Part of the plot, and it's completely vital, transforms Will into a ruthless out-foraction warrior. So, imagine it. One moment you're sitting there, a soft-skinned cherub, the next you're twice the size, covered in sweat and hair and full of strange urges for all kinds of odd practices. Actually, this isn't the first time that our Will has been through this Biactol-inducing transformation.

Sadly, Jetstrike embodies all that is bad about sideon scrolling shoot-'emups. It's not very good. Anoraksville in the area! If you're a big-time wargames fan Ticonderoga should butter your muffins. There's reams of maps and stats and options, but the game is surprisingly easy to get into. A horribly indulgent and poorly scripted American quiz show simulator starring a cast of thoroughly detestable characters. You're better off with Trivial Pursuit and some mates.

Another interesting feature is the option to select your teams playing strategy, this can range from aggressive attacking play to defensive 'lets keep everyone behind the puck mode. Gretzky's is stat packed, with every type of information on every single NHLPA player. Each skater has to deal with inertia so it's difficult to stop and turn, and you can also practice penalty shots, face offs and team passing.

"CVG REVIEW Footy Sim US Gold .95 Out June Mega Drive version soon to be available No other versions planned SNES With Football at its lowest ebb in a long time, US Gold feel it's the appropriate time to bring on their boot boys to literally kick their rivals into touch. ENG 8 4 ITA he quest for the greatest footy game continues apace, with Konami currently reigning supreme with the utterly great International Superstar Soccer. However, US Gold have been quick to realise there is one area of footy games yet to remain unexploited: the players themselves. Now, we're not talking crap licences here, such as that Giggs game or Handball Maradona (one for you oldies, that!), but differing personalities within the game itself people who have special skills. International Superstar Soccer experimented with the idea by adding recognisable sprites to their international sides, with Baggio and Valderama's haircuts standing out, but their skills weren't really accentuated enough to make them particularly noticeable. With Fever Pitch, though, US Gold are set to introduce eight characters, each of whom possess a very visible skill. Similarly, while the view is very much FIFA, US Gold have placed the emphasis on arcade playability, stating that the EA game is far too slow to be enjoyable, and that they aim to prove that 3D and speed CAN go hand in hand. As such, a wealth of international sides are at your disposal, and by going through the round taking on the likes of Mexico and the mighty Brazilians you can build your side to your own specifications it's almost like being Terry Venables.

"MD32X CVG REVIEW Sports Acclaim  Out Now Mega Drive and SNES versions also available Saturn version planned III! 0856 Sadly, all the sprites run like girls. You know, a skippy kind of run with their hands in the air. CAM AND GET IT The basic gameplay of the Mega Drive game was as good as it got, so Acclaim have concentrated on tarting up the graphics to warrant the 32X label. NFL 32X-stylee uses larger sprites and better resolution to allow for close-ups of the bonecrunching action, and they've even gone to town on the grass, making it look far more realistic than before! Best of all, though, are the camera angles which allow the player to view their tackles and kicks from a number of TV-style perspectives: BLIMP: The flying eye EVERSE TSS Three, two, X... Hut! Hut! Hut! Acclaim's plans for 32X domination continue as they beat Madden to the next generation. 00 AND 10 ON THE 3015T QUARTER 01:00 5TRGTONSIDE COVER DOLELE AVE VS 49ERS es, we know that American football is just a bunch of nancy Yanks who are too wet to play rugby without padding themselves up to the nines, but it still provides excellent fodder for video games! Why not ask EA, who seem to have milked so much out of John Madden, it's surprising there's anything left of the man. Well, ever quick to jump on a bandwagon, Acclaim have turned to newly bought developers, Iguana, to convert their popular Mega Drive and Super NES American Football game to the 32X. Their vision of a 32-bit American football game includes all the greatest US sides, camera angles galore and adding digitised backdrops to all the options screens. One noticeable omission, though, is that the training section which allowed the player to practice throwing and kicking and stuff has now been omitted in favour of the said graphical wonders. At the moment this reigns as the premier 32X sports game, at least unless EA decide to get in on the act. Just imagine what they could do with FIFA... However, it's not only the graphics which have been stepped up a notch for the 32-bit version, the game. play's also been improved. The controls are far more fluid, the response better, and the whole thing is far more enjoy able than its 16-bit juniors. A This is an absolutely huge space to fill with a caption. Still, I can probably fill it by saying that this is the tactics part of the game where plays are plotted. There, filled it. A Your chosen team's attributes, including speed and the usual bits.

"REVIEW CVG SECOND OPINION The 16-bit versions of NFL didn't really make me switch from being a Madden fan, and the omission of the training in the 32X version seems a little needless as it added variety and actually proved a bit useful if you were a novice to the sport of American football. The main difference about this souped-up NFL Quarterback, though, looks superlative, with more camera angles than you can shake a copy of Accolade's Unnecessary Roughness at. Not only this but the game seems to handle better than its lowlier Mega Drive counterpart. GARY LORD 00:58 01:00 Go on, kick 'em, punch 'em just get the ball across that line.

Just select this, and the best view will be given at any point during the game passing has never looked so good. NORMAL: Seen from slightly behind and above the action. Your normal, run-of-the-mill Madden view. You know the score AUTO: Can't be bothered to mess with the cameras? Well, let ALTERNATIVE 3DO John Madden's/EA Looks really, really cool, but it has to be said that NFL plays a darn sight better. Oh aye it does. NOT REVIEWED AND G VERDICT 543 AND GZ utico do 00:31 do te 32x It took Acclaim's Mega Drive version of NFL to get my interest in American football games going, but this 32X version has really got me into it. Before, the excitement of a long pass or a fantastic kick meant nothing because it looked dull and failed to convey the power of a crunching tackle, but now, thanks to Iguana's addition of multiple views and slick presentation this has all changed. NFL plays well too more or less the same as the MD version and all-in-all is a worthy conversion.

"ARCADES CYG Skoda Rally? I don't think CE RALLY SEGA RALLY FSE Sega Championship Rally 1995 ISI Driving Sim  per play Sega 1-8 Players MAKOS R&D WORKS SA Full Castrof LE Have you ever sat down to watch the Lombard Rally and thought to yourself I really want a crack at that? Well, Sega's latest driving escapade enables you to do just that. The Top Gear' experience comes equipped with two of the top cars on the rally scene at the moment, the Toyota Celica GT Four and the Lancia Delta HF Intergrale. There's really no difference between the two, except that the Celica looks cooler. Sega Rally is the first game to be developed by AM3, who are the new research team born out of AM2, the team responsible for Daytona (see pages 1521) and Virtua Fighter. The backdrops are much more detailed than Daytona and the buildings are drawn absolutely superbly. There are three stages, forest, desert and mountain and each one incorporates such high graphical detail that it's almost impossible to tell them from the real McCoy. Detail is such that on parts of the course a helicopter follows you around, hovering straight in front of you and sweeping up dust and debris from the track, momentarily blocking your view. It's apparent that the programmers have concentrated more on realism and the drive of the car than the actual race itself. As you career around each course you find yourself spending time more on manoeuvring the car than actually racing. To help you, and keep in line with the realism, you're given a co-driver who lets you know when a corner is just about to come up and whether it's sharp or gradual. Cornering is given an extra dimension of reality as you'll find yourself fighting inertia and the wheel as your car starts to slide out, but be careful not to over compensate. Like the best in its genre, the object of the exercise is to win. Well, in Sega Rally, what sounds like a formality is actually extremely tough. The other drivers seem to have high intelligence. This is probably the best race sim I have ever played and if this is the shape of things to come from the AM 3 team I am sure arcado-philes are in for a real treat. A slight niggle is the control of the car, it's harder than trying to steer a shopping trolley, but worth persevering with. Sega Rally is a real winner and beats Daytona hands and feet firmly glued down. The virtual seat only adds to the thrills and SPRITES helps push Sega Rally ANIMATION into pole REALISM position.

"CVG REVIEW Flight Sim Virgin Unconfirmed Out June O No other versions available No other versions planned PC CD-ROM Make like Gandalf's birds and fly, fly you fools with Virgin's latest lovely PC release; it's just like flying a real plane but without the travel insurance. here's a number of ways to fly. You can buy a ticket at an airline company, or learn in the RAF. Or you could just be the kind of spawny kid who's got loaded parents who buy you everything you want and pay for flying lessons when you're about seven. However, there's only way to pretend to fly and that's by sticking out your arms and running around the park going rrmnyyeeer\" and tipping your shoulders when you tum to simulate banking. But if that's too much embarrassment (or fresh air) for you, you could always rely on the tried-andtrusted legion of PC flight simulators. But it's a jungle out there, with all those millions of flight sims available. You don't want to spend a massive ruck of cash and rush home to find you've got Mike Smith's Stunt Helicopter Fun. You want the bona fide BEST FLIGHT SIMULATOR IN THE WORLD. And that, according to Virgin, any road, is exactly what Flight Unlimited is. They reckon they've got the closest thing you'll find to real flying without taking massive loads of evil drugs. And we're not ones to argue, especially as this is also fully VR-headset compatible (one of the first titles to boast this feature), so if you're dead wealthy (and probably have a real plane anyway) you can experience flight sim action BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HUMAN BELIEF. Or perhaps not. This view allows a good look at the controls as well as the landscape below. One of them flying lesson things fully explained. How nice. SAVED BY THE PARACHUTE You might think this simulated flying lark is a piece of cake, but not even computerised flying authorities will let you up in the air until you've got your pilot's licence. Sort of. Unless you're a real pilot and a games genius rolled into one, your best bet is to head straight for the Flight Training option, where a real honest-to-gosh flight instructor offers advice and warnings as he guides you through a selection of 25 cool-looking aerial stunts. Once you've completed this course you're safe to fly free and invent your own. A Cor Jordy, just look at those graphics.

But Flight Unlimited goes a step further by including real, actual real landscapes. This doesn't mean there's a load of soil in the box, but rather that each background comprises thousands of aerial photographs, digitally digitised for maximum realism.

Some are big. some are small, some have propellers, some have jet engines and some have no engines at all (and they crash).

The full run down of aircraft is as follows PC CD-ROM The basic premise of Flight Unlimited doesn't make it sound very exciting take control of an aeroplane and fly it about. But that's reckoning without the superb feel and depth of realism contained within this CD.

"cvG Q & JAGGED EDGE HELP! Dear CVG. I purchased an Atari Jaguar last November and I think it's bril liant, so I would be very happy if you could answer these few questions. Do you think RAM is some sort of sheep or that a byte is something to do with eating? Perhaps you thought MPEG was what you used to hang the washing out with? Well don't worry 'cos CVG is on hand to sort out all your techy troubles. So get scribbling to: HELP!, CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. SNES AND PC TICKLERS Dear CVG I have recently bought myself a SNES while my father owns a 386SX 33Mhz PC for his job and I wondered if you could clear up a few questions I have about both machines? 1. In the summer I want to buy a fast and powerful PC but I don't know where to start. I like ultra fast flight and racing simulations, but don't want to waste my money on a PC which I'm only going to use to play games on. I want a CD ROM drive too. What do you suggest for around ,000? CVG: For around ,000 try and get a PC with this type of spec: 486DX2 66Mhz, 8Mb RAM, Soundblaster and speakers, 250MB or more hard drive and SVGA monitor. If you can spend a more do so, it's worth it in the long run, especially if you can get a larger hard drive. 2. Under the SNES console there is an opening marked EXT. What's it for? CVG: Origigally it was for the SONY designed CD-ROM drive add-on which has of course since been developed and turned into the PlayStation. It's unlikely to ever be put to any use in this country but in Japan it's used to connect a modem add-on for downloading software. 3. What are the advantages of getting an AV stereo cable for the SNES? CVG As long as you have a monitor ar TV with composite or SCART connections then you will benefit from vastly improved picture quality. And equally, if you have a stereo monitor or telly, you'll get crisp stereo sound too. 4. Could you tell me the finishing mve of Kano of Mortal Kombat on the SNES? CVG: Quite possibly yes. 5. Out of the following: Wolfensteil, FIFA, Vortex, NBA Tournament, Madden, Top Gear, Mortal Kombat II, International Superstay Soccer, Barkley Shut up and Jam, Stunt Race FX, Probotector, Mario Kart, Starwing, NBA Live '95, Castlevairfa 4, Donkey Kong Country and Pilotwings which three games should I buy next? CVG: Mario Kart, Mortal Kombat 2. international Superstar Soccer. Costas Charalampous, Cyprus 1. I've been reading a lot about the Jaguar CD. Do you have a release date and price for it? CVG: Yep, it should be out about now at around . 2. Do you think I should buy the Jag CD or wajt for the Saturn and PlayStation to arrive? CV It makes sense to wait until the end of the year at least, so you'll have a better idea of which machines are becoming successful. 3/ Will there ever be a Jaguar keyboard? GVG: One should appear eventually but no confirmation as yet. 4, Is Crescent Galaxy on the Jagyar any good because it looks absolutely stunning? CVG: Appearances can be deceptive. In other words it's complete plop. 5. Is there going to be an AVP2? CVG: Yep. 6. Is Ultra Vortex any good on the Jag? CVG: We haven't seen a finished version yet, so it would be unfair to judge it. 7. Do you think I should keep my SNES because I think it's pretty good? CVG: It depends on what games you have. If you have a library of classic titles then yes ,but even so it's worth keeping for any more classic games that are released over the coming months. The SNES has a good two years life left in it yet. Ben Dicker, Middleton-on-Sea, West Sussex WHAT'S ORBITING SATURN? Dear CVG I own a Saturn and was wondering if you could answer the following questions please: 1. Do you have any new pictures and/or release dates for the following games on the Saturn: Virtua Racing, Panzer Dragoon, Shinobi and of course Daytona USA? CVG: Hmm, something tells us you don't read the maga zine as much as you should cos we've printed pix of all those games but hey, we're nice people so we'll tell you that Virtua Racing should be out in September, while Panzer Dragoon is out now on import (and was reviewed last month) as is Daytona (see page15) and Shinobi should be out in June. 2. What games are Namco planning on releasing for the Saturn? CVG Cybersled is a definite (nevermind) and they have at least 10 other projects on the go. 3. How long would you expect the lithium battery to last in the Satum? CVG: The same amount of time as in a cartridge, so about five years. Of course it's possible to change the battery in the Saturn so it isn't really a problem. 4. Will AM3's Sega Rally appear on the Saturn? CVG: It should be in the arcades as you read this and you can see a review of it on page 90! Mark Tabron, Liverpool 16 96 "

CVG: Jungle Strike's already out and jolly good but a conversion of Urban Strike looks increasingly unlikely 4. Is it possible to use a cheaper keyboard and disk drive with the SX-1 or does it all come in one package? CVG: Unless you buy a complete package from the likes of Silica or Special Reserve the sx-1 comes naked so shop around for the best prices on key, boards, disk drives and the like.

Is it worth buying one because I'm worried about the lack of software support the machine has? CVG: As long as you like beat-'em-ups you'll be fine! But seriously SNK have said they will give the machine comprehensive support, but third party support seems to be very scarce. 2. Could you compare the power of the Neo Geo CD to the PSX or Ultra 64? CVG: No, the Neo Geo CD is undoubtedly a powerful machine but it is getting on and doesn't compare favourably to either the PSX or Ultra 64. 3. Which would I be better getting hold of, a Neo Geo CD, a PSX or Ultra 64? CVG: At the moment you'd be best off with a PlayStation as the Ultra 64's not going to be available until next year. 4. Will the Neo Geo CD be more popular than it was before. CVG: Probably not. 5. Should I just stick with my CD32 and see if its position in the 32-bit market improves? CVG: Things look bleak for the CD32 until something happens with the remains of Commodore. Unless you have a lot of games you'd probably be better off selling it and invest ing the cash in one of the new machines you've mentioned. Neil Rowley, Little Hulton, Salford. 1. In another mag it said that MK2, NBA Jam and Judge Dredd were going to be released on Jaguar. Is this true? CVG: Yep. 2. Is Sega making any games for the Jaguar? CVG: Not directly, but there's a good chance that games like Virtua Fighter could be ported as part of an agreement between Sega and Atari. 3. Will 3D0 games work on Jaguar CD? CVG: Don't be silly. 4. Will Doom 2 appear on Jaguar? CVG: No plans yet but probably. 5. Are Ultra 64 games going to be affordable? CVG: Depends what you mean by affordable! There's a good chance they'll be around the  mark. James Quantrill, Bucks PC OR PLAYSTATION? Dear Help! 1. I've got a SNES but can't choose between a PlayStation or a 33Mhz 4Mb RAM PC as my next machine. What do you suggest? CVG: Definitely a PlayStation, a 33Mhz PC just isn't powerful enough these days. 2. Is the PlayStation likely to get conver sions of Dark Forces, Doom and Doom 2, and Alone in the Darks 1 to 3? CVG: Dark Forces and Doom 2 are almost definite but the Alone in the Dark series is only a possible. 3 Is Striker or FIFA likely to appear on the PlayStation? CVG: FIFA yes, Striker no. 4 Which is better out of Virtua Fighter on Saturn and Toh Shin Den on PlayStation? CVG: Toh Shin Den has the better graphics and sound and is superb fun but Virtua Fighter has longer lasting appeal. 5 Is Ridge Racer 2 going to be released on PlayStation? CVG: Yes. 6 Is International Superstar Soccer as good as everyone says? CVG: Yep and it's coming to the PlayStation. lan Mars. TED 92 "

STAGE: 1-1 This primitive stage presents Hagane with the oppor tunity to gain a lot of power-ups as well as experi menting with his array of artillery. The ship that attacks Hagane on this stage releases Koma sol diers armed with guns. Take out the cannons and the napalm dispensers to overcome him. STAGE: 1-2 Watch out for spider-like creatures that are attached to the ceiling, as they lob rocks at our hero. Hagane will come to a ledge where he can advance no further, or so it seems. Use his double jump to bounce off the walls to gain access to the higher platform. Now this is where you fight the first mini-boss. Keep Hagane at a distance and use your shurikens, when he nears you double jump over him and continue the process. Prme2 S TRW STAGE: 1-3 Carefully edge Hagane along the first section as there are gant worms which rip through the floor to get at him. You'll need to be precise with your jumps when trying to complete this level. 104 "

STAGE: 1 BOSS Watch the shoulders of the sorcerer's two guardians, they twitch when they're going to punch. Stay on the opposite side to the one that is about to strike. Attack the sorcerer with your blade as this does the most damage. TIME 778 S U RROW NONNU STAGE: 2-2 A nimble set of fingers are the order of the day if you're gonna survive this one.

When the boss reconnects itself it will fire out spheres. These spheres can be destroyed by the aid of your sword STAGE: 3-2 Hagane will now rip through the surface of the warship so he can stalk down the third boss of the Koma's. Inside the warship Hagane will come across its ceiling-mounted defence lasers. To destroy these jump and cling to the ceiling and unleash the power of your sword. While continuing to the right Hagane will find some rotating platforms.

These take you to different areas, the key is to use them to gain as many power-ups as possible, these will become an essential from here on in. Also start saving your smart bombs.

Hagane must make his way speedily up the tower, as the spiked floor below decides to come up after him. Try to collect as many of the power-ups that are on offer here; you'll need them! STAGE: 5-5 Here Hagane runs from a wall which appears from the nght this time. To slow the chasing wall throw some bombs at it, this will momentarily halt its chase.

Well our Haga isn't having any of this! So he chases after the missile. The missile has two sections to it. The first should be taken out with Hagane's blade and the second part should be attacked with all your smart bombs as well as your standard bombs. Oh yeah! You've got just over a minute to do this! 01 SRO STAGE: 5-6 Wah, Hagane has made it to his final challenge. To defeat the Koma's head boss arm your bombs. Make sure you do not use, any smart bombs.

"CVG COMPETITION | YOUR WEIGHT IN FEVER PITCH CARTS! (IF YOU'RE QUITE LIGHT) GER 0 3 ITA There's an awful lot of football games available at present, and it could be a hard inb choosing between them. But we at. CVG, generous once more to a fault, are here to help you. With the aid of this competition and your own skill you can WIN one of SIX copies of US Gold's Fever Pitch game FOR NOTHING, instantly solving the little soccer cartridge purchasing conundrum 2:44 currently facing you. And if you don't really fancy it that much you can always hope to be a runner-up, for such types will recieve A WHOLE PLANET of Fever Pitch goodies, such as T-shirts, bags and the like. -EWANI OCE E A6 SO WHAT DO I GOT TO DO?   Ah, it all seems so simple up to this point. Well, we were pretty struck with the musical efforts unearthed by the PSX competi tion we ran couple of months ago, so we're going to continue in that vein. What we want you to do is compose your own football chant about Fever Pitch. Or US Gold. Or CVG. It doesn't really matter, so long as there's a tenuous connection in there some where. Like all good football chants it should run to the tune of a famous/classic number, so if you can't be bothered actually chanting the bleeder on to a tape (which would be nice) you can just send us a lyric sheet with a note of what standard you're robbing for a tune. We won't shout. Once you've done that, just make a note of your name and address, along with your choice between a SNES or Mega Drive cart in the event you're a winner, pop it in the envelope (or on the cassette box) and send it to SCARLET FEVER PITCH COMPETITION. CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU, to reach us no later than June 15. Normal competition rule apply, so no multiple entries, and don't expect a reply if you write in to whinge that you didn't win. 112 "
