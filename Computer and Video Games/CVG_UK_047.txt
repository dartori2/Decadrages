So, his friends have gone on without him to enjoy the fun and games at the top of the castle. This is the setup for the new game from Quicksilva, which has been released to coincide with Rupert's 65th birthday this year. more and more obstructions and, once he has taken six tumbles, it's back to Level 1. Which can get tiresome. Watch out, though, when he is jumping over an obstacle as he may hit an obstacle on the next floor which causes him one tumble. Rupert and his friends look remarkably like their characters in a well known daily newspaper. The graphics are amazing! Obviously, a lot of thought and effort has gone into this. Look closely at the screens and see the detail involved from the trees and flowers to Rupert Bear is 65 this year but there is no sign of him going into retirement. And thanks to our friends at Argus Software, Computer & Video Games is giving you the chance to join in Rupert's birthday celebrations with a great competition. There will be five first prizes of Rupert & the Toymaker's Party plus a Rupert scarf. The next 20 runners up will receive a copy of the game.

After he has collected all the invitations from the 4/5 screens on each level, the door will open up allowing him through to the next level. Look out for the white bird and plane as they are on his side and if he jumps on their backs they will carry him over the obstacles and gaps in the floor.

So stop moaning and get playing those games! manage to kill her, go right and you will see a hole with the magic wand in. Well, after that I think Michael deserves to be helped. So if YOU know what the wand is used for, what the wizard flashes and how to complete the quest, write in and I shall pass it on. TECHNICIAN TED Meet the person who finally released Technician Ted from the agonies of roaming round Microchip Factory David Adams. He was presented with a silicon slice (as featured in this top-selling game) to celebrate his success by Hewson Consultants. To help other TT addicts, Hewson Consultants released a list of tasks and the order in which they must be completed. BUT the secrets of the animated sequence which finishes the game are still closely guarded. c. GAMES WORKSHOP Old CASTLE QUEST The anonymous reader who sent in the tips for Castle Quest back in July has finally owned up he is Michael Dobson from Kent and he has included some more hints! To get out of prison, pick up the stool then stand underneath the torch and press RETURN and CURSOR KEY UP buttons together. This will knock the torch down. Pick up the stool and place it underneath the ledge by the door then pick up the torch and jump up onto the stool and then onto the ledge. Throw the torch in the direction of the bed. The bed will catch alight and the guard will rush in. When he has passed you, step off the ledge, pick up and store the stool, and run out of the door and up a few steps-BUT, be careful that you don't bash into the patrolling guard. If he is there, stay on the stairs until he turns and goes back-follow him -but not too closely until you get to the point where there is a ladder above your head. Jump onto it and you are safe. If you have had anything confiscated, wait until the guard has gone back the other way then go down the ladder and turn to your left, up a few steps and there they are. It is safer to stop and pick up one item at a time. Once you have completed this, go up the ladder and turn right, then down a ladder. Run left up a few stairs, run on a bit further and jump the gap you will land on a bridge. Make sure you have the sword in your hand and run right until you are a couple of steps from the end then jump. If lucky, you'll jump the gap and land on the other side where you will have to fight off two Red Ogres. Once this is done, go up as far as you can and store the sword, pick up the aqua-lung and fall off the edge. When in the water, go left and up a ladder. Carry on going up, then jump from your ladder to the one next to it and go up to the top. Next, drop an item NOT the aqua-lung and run right, right to the end of the platform and jump. You will hit your head on an overhanging ledge and fall straight down. Quickly press the \"p\" button several times and you should pick up the bucket. This time when in the water go right and up a ladder, drop the aqua-lung and retrieve the bucket. Stand at the top of the ladder and throw the bucket into the water. Put on the aqua-lung and go down and pick up the bucket hopefully it will have water in it. Go back up two ladders and go right past a gold coin, drop the aqua-lung near it and retrieve the bucket of water. Go down one ladder and slowly down the second. As soon as the screen scrolls, press the JUMP key so that you slide down the ladder fast then, as quickly as possible, turn right and press the throw right button. If lucky, water will fly out of the bucket, hit the witch and kill her. If you miss, it is fatal. If you HELP!! Jason Patridge of Northants is tearing his hair out trying to complete Micromega's Jasper. Any clues? Someone else having trouble is Jeffrey Walton of Darlington. His particular problem is Technician Ted. He manages to plod through the first seven tasks but then he gets lost. He has managed to find 43 out of the 50 screens, but, alas that's where the problems begin. ... How does he do number eight? TIR NA NOG Miles Dorrington of Devon writes in with tips on how to get LUNGH'S SPEAR. First you must go to the Lava flats and get the ring. Go to the door marked \"O\" for ring, in the Plain of Lies. Get the antiers and go and give it to Cemos in the forest of Cem. He in tum will give you a harp. Go out of the cave and pick up the pin. Follow the Sidhe. He can't kill you because of the harp, though this only works in the forest of Cern. The Sidhe will take you to the secret door. If you still can't find it, move a bit left or right, then turn and try to go in again. Once in, get the spear and take it back to the starting room. To help activate the Seal, you need Calum's hammer. This is found by going to Storm base. With a spade, face the Celtic cross found there, walk NORTH nine paces and drop the spade, et voila! You will also need an oak leaf to open a door. To get this powerful item, take the feather and the honeycomb to the door marked \"B\" in Badheim, go in and drop the feather 42 "


"PROFESSORVI you are immune. Keep away from the dwelling of the Wulf as much as possible. MANIC MINER Eugene's Lair don't panic. When getting the last brick, wait until Eugene is very near the top of the screen and jump to the right. Keep these keys on to get onto the brick wall and then push right to land in the exit. Do not waste time, as Eugene will come down and stand on the exit, to prevent you getting inside. If he is at the very top when you get the brick, he will stick to the ceiling. MINER WILLY MEETS THE KONG BEAST Pulling the lever on the left side of the screen will open up part of the wall, while the one on the right will cause the Kong Beast to fall down and give you points. When jumping onto the conveyor belt, face left when you are underneath the conveyor belt and the platform above. Keep the jump key on and, when you land on the conveyor belt, you will be facing right. You will then jump onto the platform above. RUBBLE TROUBLE Do not destroy all the rocks. When on HAYFIELD, go towards the crumbling rocks. JOE DIGGER — Try not to get rid of all the land marsh, mountains and forest. Do not dig holes for the meanies push them into the sea. On the blue screen and onwards, keep your shovel down all the time. by Balrig's shrine and there you have it. To enter the ring of stones in Tir Clachan, you will need the book. Enter the door and go into the icecave. Get the ice and half torc. That's as far as Miles has got in this game, so, if anyone can help him to get the other parts of the seal, please write to me, marking your envelope TIR NA NOG tips. BRUCE LEE One observant reader Gareth Randall of Essex noticed that we had left out an important and very useful tip in our Bruce Lee map, July issue. On screen 16, two circular orange objects appear, one on top of the other, at the bottom right of the screen. Each time Bruce Lee touches these, he gains an extra life. By running in and out of the bottom level of the room and picking these up, up to nine lives can be gained after which no more of the objects appear. This works on the Atari version, so you will have to try it out yourself to see if it works on the others. One last tip, from round three upwards, Ninja and Yamo become so vicious that they will kick you to death the moment you stop moving. Do NOT get trapped in a comer you no longer have any chance of survival there! POKE CORNER Sorry for the lack of pokes this month but we haven't received any in the office.

BEEB LOVERS Joe Williams from Northumberland was playing around on his Beeb and discovered the following tips. SABRE WULF-When waiting for orchids to bloom, stay near to the exits in case of bush-fires and indians. Mark the route to the cave entrance on your map. When you have collected all the bits of amulet, find your way onto and follow the path to the cave entrance. The guardian will have disappeared. Explore every \"one-entrance\" clearing, as the pieces of amulet are always in these rooms. Keep your finger on the sword button all the time, even when DOHS TOMS W9 Su AVALON Calling W Carvallo of Amersham. Here are the clues you asked for in July. In the Labyrinth there is the sword of Caliburn which you must collect. To get the sword you must have the \"find\" spell. Then go to where the face is and go through the door it is looking at. Keep going that way until you reach a scorpion and slay it with a missile. Then cast \"find\" and move the eye near the door. You will now see the sword get it and find the unlock spell which should be in the labyrinth. Cast unlock on the door that you cannot open — this will lead to the catacombs of the undead. In the catacombs there is an Energy Source and an Energy Sink, both guarded by wraiths. Get all the spells you can find some of them are very interesting. The oil can lubricates the locks which are very old. You will find the keys on this level. Find the amulet spell which is one of the locked doors you must take this with you. In the Chambers of Chaos use the sword on all the monsters, goblins, wraiths, warriors of chaos and ninjas. The only way in at the start is the summon spell then later you can go through the labyrinth. In the Chambers of Chaos, you need to find four items resembling plates. To get them, you have to go through a door which can be opened by the coir from the chest. The chest is opened with the key from under the skulls. Take the four plates to the large compass and pass them over it in a certain order. An invisible portal will appear go through. There are only four rooms on this level-occupied by goblins, wraiths, warriors of chaos and ninjas, but there are also indestructible, large, black, firebreathing demons. Get out of their way until you reach a small box \"Avelach\". Make sure you have the wraith bane, chalice spell, amulet spell and the sword of Caliburn. Pass the sword over the box and HEY PRESTO you've done it! Thanks \"Tipmaster\". "

"Your mission is to rescue 30 hostages held captive. To carry out the rescue mission, you must avoid the enemy and watch out that your helicopter does not run out of fuel. The chopper can be controlled by either a Kempston joystick or the keyboard. The keys are Q=up, A=down, O=left, P=right and V=abort. All the user-defined graphic characters in this program have been changed to underlined upper-case letters. So, for instance, if you see \"A\" in the listing go into graphics mode (CAPS SHIFT+9) then press the \"A\" key [you'll see a graphic character) then press CAPS SHIFT+9 again to return to normal text. Some lines use symbol graphics (the ones on the number keys). When in graphics mode, type the underlined number. If the digit is preceded by sh, then hold down a \"shift\" key while pressing the number, to give the reversed graphic.

"MAKING TRACKS tape until it's all how you want it to sound. The main advantage as far as Beat the Sharks were concerned was that this cut the cost of studio time as a lot of the backing could be pre-programmed. The other benefit is that when using a relatively small recording studio you save lots of those precious tracks by putting all of the programmed backing onto the same piece of tape. The single \"Runaway\" was recorded at a 16-track studio so obviously all of these techniques were very important. But it wasn't all sweetness and light! Having set everything up and pressed the start key, engineer Richard Joseph and producer Mike Burdett did have some problems with keeping the sync track at a constant speed. But these were soon sorted out. Computer magic in the studio: A musical note is displayed as a three. dimensional image on the super sophisticated Fairlight Computer Musical Instrument. So you've always fancied yourself as the next Frankie Goes to Hollywood? You have a great idea for a song. It goes something like doo dum da doo doo doo dum da Relax. But there are two slight problems. First, you think you may have heard the song before somewhere. Second, you have just raided the piggy bank and you are still ,000 short for the necessary computer gadgetry. Don't panic! As pop group Beat the Sharks discovered, the technology is available and it's cheaper than you think. So relax, write a new song and read on ... The story so far... New record label Pure Trash had signed the Sharks to release a single called \"Runaway\". That was the good news. The bad news was that Trevor Horn would not let them play with his costly computerised music toys. Unabashed they turned to the little Yamaha CX 5M, an MSX micro with an add-on piano keyboard and excellent music chip. Indeed inside its small frame it packs half of a Yamaha DX9 synthesiser's voice generator. The band's main interest was to take what is basically a home computer system into the studio and come out with a production that was truly professional. The aspects of the system which most appealed to the band were its ability to synchronise another keyboard and drum machine. Also, using the optional music computer software, some of the backing tracks could be programmed before going into the studio. This obviously saves money. The idea was to lay down a pulse track from the CX 5M onto an outside I bet you thought musicians went into a recording studio with their guitar slung over their shoulder, The Yamaha CX5 in action in the studio. played a few tunes, sang a bit and then emerged with a smash hit What you hear on the record then are number one record! Well We did computer controlled drums, bass and at C&VG until we delved into the keyboards. The rest of the tracks, guitar, amazing world of computers and keyboard and vocals were then played music.

Software House of the Year Ultimate? What about US Gold, Taskset, Epyx, Activision etc? Programmer of the Year The Ultimate team? The voters don't even know their names. What about Jeff Minter, Bruce Carver and David Crane? What did you do with all the Commodore owners votes? Lobbed them in the bin probably or said \"They don't count!\" This is an absolute farce and the results show that nearly all the award winners are Spectrum software houses. Also, the Game Of The Month for the past two months has been Squishboard (Spectrum to you) games. Is this because they are better than some of the Commodore games reviewed? No, it is to please the immortal C&VGloving Squishboard owners. Recently, your space given to Commodore articles has greatly decreased. Please try and give more space to Commodore features. Do you know why the Commodore has been taken off the shelves of our local Boots store? Regarding your listings, why not put up the price of the mag and enclose a cassette with the games already saved on it? It would be more convenient and far quicker.
