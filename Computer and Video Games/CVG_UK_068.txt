Yes, this Tiger Heli lookalike, this amazing game that Press releases go on and on about, is just run of the mill stuff. Maybe it's news in Denmark, but over here it's no big deal. Anyway, the game scrolls, as I said, a landscape underneath a chopper, which is let loose into your hands. You must destroy various on coming enemies, and collect lots of points.

This level is tougher than the previous one, and has a lot more tanks at the start, making it very difficult to get very far. Should you make it past the seventh set of tanks, consider yourself brilliant. The graphics are very simple, nothing to elaborate, I suppose it's so that it can be converted to other machines easier. (ie. ZX81 and Jupiter Ace) Gameplay wise the game is a dead ringer for a lot of games which have hit the market recently, and there are far better versions of this theme available.

But once again the dreaded curse of the movie spin-off has struck. Big Trouble has a reasonably good game idea, pretty graphics and nice sound but it all gets let down by the tedious gameplay. You get three characters to control. Each has different abilities and each is brought into action for different parts of the game. If you've seen the film then you'll know the basic plot which is a simple save the girl from the evil, oriental mastermind adventure. And that's just what the plot of the game is. You can control the heroes Jack Burton, Wang-Chi and Egg Shen on their quest to save their girlfriends from the villainous Lo Pan. Jack is armed with his fists and when he finds it, a gun. Wang Chi is a martial arts ace who sometimes gets to use a sword and Egg Shen is a wizard who fights with mystical energy bolts. Initially Jack is able to defend himself only with his fists. However if you can penetrate far enough into the Mandarin's empire you will find a Bushmaster gun which you may use. There is only a limited amount of ammunition, though more may be found lying around. Wang Chi is gifted with a knowledge of the martial arts. In addition to this a sword will eventually be found. Swords have a comparatively short life and will eventually break. More swords may be found during play and if picked up will prolong the life of the sword you are carrying if you already have one. At the beginning of the game Egg Shen uses magic bolts which he can fire from his fingers, those only have a very limited range. Eventually a magic potion in a bottle will be found which will enable him to use stronger magic. He will now have control over lightning bolts which will have devastating effects on the Headquarters: The Storms are elemental beings who must be defeated before you are able to face Lo Pan in combat.

It's a split screen two-player game, in which the spies have been sent to a tropical island, where the deadly XJ472 missile has crashed. The spies must get all three bits of it, and escape from the island before a volcano on it blows. Well, it is a Pacific island. On the one player game, you can also choose the Black Spies 1.Q level, from Sun reader mentality to nuclear physicist. The spies can also set all sorts of traps, like land mines and the old rape 'n tree trap in order to ambush their opponent. Where the game falls down. however, is in its speed of play. Everything happens so S-L-OW-LY it just isn't true, and the scrolling is so jerky, it wouldn't look out of place on a Spectrum, even if you do get seven different island to choose from .99 is too much for this game, A Avenger knock two or three quid off, and unfortunately, in limited supply, unfortunately, in limited supply, it shapes up a lot better.

Trailblazer is highly addictive, and with 14 tracks to choose from, you won't get bored in a hurry. At .99, it's well priced, the graphics not being spectacular, while the scrolling is excellent. Donkey Kong... Hmm... name sounds famliar... got it! It's that old game from 1982, can remember playing it in France. Well, folks, Ocean seem to think that it can still stand up in the games market today, so they've re-released it. In case you don't know the storyline, it goes something like this. Kong has captured your girlfriend, and has taken her to the top of a building, or at least, the top of the first stage of this building, because it is divided into four stages, each one supposedly harder than the last. The first involves you, as ever, trying to get to the top. while mighty Kong tosses barrels down at you, along with an occasional fireball. If you complete that, then it's up a level to the custard pie factory, where mad custard pies (?!) chase you. This is an easy screen. Screen three involves Various homing fireballs that wait on the ladders, as you have to make it up using only lift and ladders, while screen four involves you pulling the rivets out of the building, so that it collapses, bringing mighty Kong crashing to earth. Then, its back to the start, and the barrels and fireballs, and everything becomes just a bit repetetive, until you feel bored out of your mind. The animation is all very nice, with King looking fearsome enough to deter any would be heroes, but the game Jacks any sort of depth, and, at .99, is overpriced. It's at about the level of a good budget game. Which would be fine if it was a budget game. But it isn't, so you may as well forget it. Sorry, Ocean, try again. I won't say much about Nemesis, merely that it is the game that has been making the WMSX world stand back in amazement at what can be achieved on the vernerable SCORES E 1909 ILLVLL!

If you've elected to blow up the fortress, you must locate and activate the hidden explosives on each floor. When rescuing the captives you must first find each one and lead them, one at a time, back to the ground floor and freedom. Understandably, your rescued comrades are sometimes a little slow to follow you, having been shackled to a stone wall for a week, so be careful not to go too fast or there'll be lost off the screen. On the minus side, the status column, on the Amstrad version, can only be seen when the game is paused. This makes it more difficult to succeed as you never know quite how many hits you've got in hand or whether you're about to fire your last shot. Although there is a small chance you may experience slight flickering in certain situations in the Commodore version, it is more or less faultlessly produced and an exceedingly playable. Overall the Commodore version of Eagles Nest is the best of the three. The game can be played on two levels, either as a mindless blast with no overall plan of action, or as a mindless blast with some idea of how you've going to succeed.

After saving the local townfolk from the local fire-breathing dragon, by turning himself into a more powerful dragon, he flipped and started rampaging around just like the original dragon. St George never had this problem. Anyway, the Great Wizard shut him up in a cave along with a spell for his release scattered around in 16 bits. To release himself, Imogen must use all his intelligence and stamina to retrieve the complete spell. Tough break, huh? But it provides the excuse for a very entertaining graphic adventure game in which you roam around 16 levels searching for pieces of spell and solving various puzzles in the process. Of course, this is a familiar format — you pick up and use objects, and so forth. But Imogen is a more interesting hero than most. He can turn himself into other creatures, for example, in order to surmount problems and obstacles a monkey to climb ropes and trees, a cat to leap over chasms. You can swap between the various characters whenever you like, and very handy it is too. You can also get around by using passwords, although only four are supplied at the start. The version I reviewed was a preview, and only two levels were supplied. But from what could see, the mode are graphics are smooth and unusually lifelike, with nice clear detail.

Once they had the moves on tape Steve used the freeze frame facility on his tape machine to pause the picture and then he traced each move frame by frame onto clear plastic film. The tracings were then transfered to a specially prepared grid which enabled Steve and Gary to recreate the live action in pixels.

We are, of course. talking about Conan--the six foot tall muscle-bound monster created by Robert E. Howard way back in the 1930's. Conan has long outgrown Howard's stories which first appeared in a *pulp\" fantasy magazine in the States called Weird Tales. Howard ended a promising career in 1936 by shooting himself.

You can see that a role-playing game is obviously a very different type of experience from a computer adventure. It doesn't even have a fixed end: after your character has completed an adventure, points are awarded, and the character 'moves up a level', acquiring new skills and powers so as to be able to face greater dangers and a wider variety of monsters.

"u situations and the Dungeon Master again oversees the battles. In fact there are rules which cover almost every possible situation players may encounter during the course of a session in their fantasy land. So what do figurines have to do with this world of the imagination? Although the games do take place in the mind, some referees began to use markers to represent the positioning of characters in relation to each other. This helped for instance in combat situations, since it determined just who could see who, or if the Dragon could rip the dumb barbarian in half or was he possibly just out of range? Although all that was needed were simple markers, these were not very attractive, and some people began making models of their favourite characters. These proved so popular that professional toy soldier makers began taking an interest, and applying their talents to this new trade. The fantasy miniature figure business was born. Although there had been a huge wave of interest in figurines there had only been sporadic attempts to explain what to do with them. A lot of people were drawn into the hobby simply through the miniatures themselves, since they were very collectable and attractive. Artists had meanwhile discovered that figures were another medium in which to exercise their talents and the results, if well done, could be astounding. Gradually, the magazines responded to this interest and began running features which included full colour photographs and, importantly, guidelines as to how the complete beginner could learn to use the painting and modelling techniques demonstrated. A basic figure is generally twenty five millimetres high. The sculptor of the figure works from a concept sketch, so the idea of what he is trying to produce is fixed firmly in his mind. Then a wire skeleton is made and the bulk of the model is built up using a coarse putty. Once this is dry, a finer putty is used to add fine detail. The sculptor employs a wide range of instruments, from pencil tips to dentists' tools to create various effects. What surprises the outsider is that the sculptors work in the same scale as the finished model. Once the master figure is completed it is used to create rubber moulds. If one mistake is made then the likeness of that particular model is lost forever. The figure is cast and sitting there in front of you. What next? Once cleaned of unwanted bits of metal, it may be painted.

"FIRELORD O FIRELORD O FIRELORD kery 4 1 ao 94 Here is a detailed map drawn by Battlelord Chelev and Battledroid Baljhor of Norway. The map doesn't show the landscape only the important objects and the possible directions are drawn. Places mapped as houses can also be caves. It can be totally frustrating if you loose your enchanted crystal without carrying another object with you. Although there are several crystals located in the kingdom and the watch and purse can also be found on the street, it will be very hard to get to these objects since herbalists don't offer their transmitter-service and gatekeepers won't let you pass through, if you haven't got a thing to barter with. You will find the enchanted crystals in various locations. Be careful when you pick up an object lying on the street. It may be exchanged with an object you are carrying Just walk over the object you lost to pick it up again. Remember you can only carry four objects. Charms are also objects but you can't barter with them. There are four people who can give your information about the charm. Each person only has knowledge about one charm. These are: Wizard-location 2-6-hat charm.  Socrates location 6-14Hanshead charm. Bishop-location 7-24 Starcolumn charm. Socrates-location 7-32bow diagonal charm. The bishop needs three objects or he won't offer his info-service. Socrates (7-32) can only be reached via the Gatekeeper. Both need two objects for their service. Remember that you need enough bartering power and two objects after getting information from Socrates if you want to go through the gate-keepers house. Only other exit is through two flames. The area near magic place three is very interesting because the column-charm and the corresponding barter object can be found there. Make sure you have enough bartering power to leave this area via the transmitter or gatekeeper. There is also an icy flame in front of one exit. You can take this way if you wish to risk your life. You can get all services the princess offers without worrying about the direction she looks at. If the flame at location 516-14 won't turn to a pulsating flame after using the switch go into the peasants hut and out again immediately. The flame should now be okay and you can reach Socrates to gain information. The three deadly crystals at location 15, 16, and 32 can be avoided by going through the peasants hut. Usually you are not forced to use a way where deadly crystals patrol. Think of what you are doing when you trade the four charms for the Firestone to the queen. Although the land will be free of the curse provided the dragon has its stone back, an evil queen possessing eternal youth is NO fun. Just look at Mrs T! That's your lot.

He has good leadership and jousting skills, but his swordfighting is only average. This usually means that he doesn't do too well in the love stakes. Geoffrey Longsword is also a good character. He has strong swordplay, which means that you should be able to get the fair maiden, no problem. But although he is a superstud, it doesn't help him too much in the jousts, and he will usually lose.

He leads his men quite well, and is not that bad with a sword either. He can win the fair maidens hand, but it will take considerable skill on your part. Each character CAN win but Cedric and Wolfric find it the hardest. Always leave at least 20 men to guard your home castle, unless you are at the top end of the map.

Paramount loved the multivision idea and had given the green light. Meanwhile, back in Liverpool, the team had decided to start preparatory work on the project in anticipation of the design's acceptance. It was about now that the first major problem occurred. Kenny takes up the story. \"It became apparent that it would be impossible to implement multi-vision, excellent concept though it was, in the form in which it had been presented in the spec. \"The team were now faced with a dilemma. The game had been sold to the States no doubt partially on the strength of multi-vision. So Multivision couldn't just be binned. \"Morale in the team was pretty low by now. Anyway we sat down one afternoon and massaged the design into a much more tangible and progammable form. At least now we had something concrete to aim at.\" \"The game was still going to have to exist within a pseudo-multi-vision framework because that's what had been promised. The idea of having animation in each of the sub-screens was quickly dropped although the screens themselves remained.

At last, Steve was able to launch himself into the creation of the game's graphics. \"I had two main sources for references; five Star Trek photo novels, and an Airfix model of the Enterprise.

"Flight Simulator factories so the other half of your mission is to shoot down as many enemy fighters as possible. This part of FSII, as with everything else in the program, is enormous fun and could almost be a stand alone game in its own right. The final feature that can be mentioned here is the Multi-Player option which enables two or more players, using separate computers, to fly together. Communication between computers is through the ST's modem port, although you can communiate with any computer which runs FSII and supports the multi player option, as long as you have the Once in a blue moon a product emerges that goes on and on selling as if it had been launched only last week. Sub Logic's Flight Simulator il is one such program. Originally released for the IBM and then the Apple Il series way back in 1983/4, FSH has sold by the hundreds of thousand to businessmen, pilots and gamesters alike. Now the world's most popular flight simulator for home micros can be enjoyed by ST owners in an upgraded form, which has been souped up to take full advantage of the ST's extra processing power and graphics capabilities. FSI/ puts you at the controls of either a single engine Cessna 182 or a Gates Learjet 25G. Whichever your choice of plane you are in for a rare graphical treat as soon as you've strapped yourself into the cockpit. Apart from the usual cockpit View you can also view your plane from the control tower or a spot plane which can be made to fly alongside you at any distance and/or angle. Tower view allows you to observe proceedings from the comfort of the control tower, the position of which can be set independently so you can set the tower at the destination airport and see yourself land! There is also a map view which can be used to gauge your present position in the world and plot any changes to your present course One of the most spectacular features to be added to the latest version of FSil is the ability to combine different views on the screen at the same time using the multiple window function. Thus the main view could be a 3D cockpit display for example, over which map and spot plane views could be overlayed in their own separate windows, each of which can be any size you want. Range).

Flight Simulator II is easily the most authentic program of its type to have been released for a home micro. The 3D graphics are stunning, and the whole package has been religiously documented by people who obviously love flying. It is rumoured that hundreds of Americans went out and bought an IBM or Apple just so they could use this program and, having clocked up more than a few flying hours myself, it's easy to see why.

"Shoot'em — Ups doesn't seem to be such a pain here as it happens at a natural break between stages. Incidently, Plutos comes on just one disk! To the right and below the action window are the status areas where you can keep a check on the stage you're in, the number of lives you've still got to play with, as well as your score and fuel status. In the two player game two sets of information are displayed. If hit by any flying alien, raised structure on the mother ship, or bullet from alien or gun turret, you lose a life. But programmer Derek Johnson, obviously a shoot-'em-up junkie on the quiet, has allowed play to continue during the transition between one life and the next.

At the end of the grace period, the outline ship is once again filled with its normal colours. Your ship can once again sustain damage (ie). You can be killed) and the game continues as per normal -minus one life of course! By thoughtful game design such as this, Plutos manages to overcome such shortfalls as poor sound effects and slow scrolling. Instead it whips you up into a destructive frenzy and doesn't let go. When you find yourson swearing at an inanimate object (namely a monitor) and fighting a losing battle against finger cramp, you know the game's got you well and truly hooked!

"BAC The final game in this mini round-up of all things destructive, is Goldrunner, the latest offring from the prolific Microdeal/Michitron stable. Goldrunner is the only one of the three which has two-way vertical scrolling, technically making it a shoot-em-up-or-down! There is even a passing attempt at offering some justification for what's going on... The Earth is dying. New worlds have been found. But between the old legacy and the new hope lie The Ringworlds of Triton'-gasp swoon etc! Built by an inconceivable technology, the Ringworlds will destroy anything that comes within range, but it seems this technology was so inconceivable that it never thought anyone would have the audacity to attack a Ringworld alone in a single small craft. Against such an attack the Ringworlds have only the most rudimentary of defences... rudimentary to them but still pretty awesome to us. Of course you're the Earth's best pilot and last hope etc. etc. Each ring has a specific amount of energy which is reduced every time a building or piece of machinery is destroyed. Although many ground features can be flown over, the taller ones represent a health hazard and must be dodged. After a while you'll recognize which elements need a wide berth, but a good rule of thumb is avoid anything casting a suspiciously large shadow. In between avoiding high buildings, the Ringworlds will give you plenty of other things to think about in the form of wave after wave of flying fighters. These come in all shapes and sizes but have one thing in common-the defence of the Ringworld and you're in their way. Contact with the fighters themselves is harmless but don't get caught by their disrupter bombs. At the start of the game, your craft has an armour strength of five and fully powered lasers and boosters. All these function will suffer as a result of successful attacks from the enemy. You lose a life when your armour strength decreases to zero. The graphical design of the Ringworld backdrops are impressive indeed. Each appears as if you're looking through a pair of tinted specs -first green, then purple etc. The animation and shadow of your ship, as it spins round in mid-air, is a real visual treat. Add to this some very atmospheric digitised speech, nice decaying explosions and some of the fastest and smoothest scrolling you're ever likely to see, and that's the very classy Goldrunner. Not the easiest game in the world to play, and certainly less frenetic than the other two, Goldrunner will appeal to Uridium freaks and those who are prepared to work a little harder before savouring the delights later levels.

Now many of these games can be enjoyed by ST owners courtesy of Loriciel who have entered the 16 bit arena with a vengence, announcing the release of at least seven titles over the coming months. Probably the most impressive of the earty Loriciel releases is Macadams Bumper. MB is a pinball game and pinball table construction set of the highest quality, putting Microdeal's similar effort of last year firmly in the shade. Once the program has loaded you are presented with a ready made table on which you can instantly play.

Apart from left and right flipper, you can also set controls for \"hit table\" left, right, or in the middle. The ball movement during play is smooth and realistic (unless you got carried away in the God screen), and the sound effects associated with each game element are what you would expect from a real pinball game. When you get too physical with the table it shakes warning you that the game was nearly tilted. Macadams Bumper is a perfect example of an existing idea given a thouroughly professional going over resulting in a polished, easy to use, and enormously enjoyable pinball game that should appeal to all tastes. nothing for more than 20 seconds the program I Karate Kid II. How often have our expectations of a forthcoming game been fuelled by seeing the film or reading the book, only to be dashed by a half-hearted attempt to transpose the property to the computer medium. So it is doubly nice to find a film tie-in that is actually worth its salt. Karate Kid Il features some of the most impressive graphical backdrops ever to grace a monitor, this martial arts classic has all the ingredients that made Fist such a success on eight bit machines, plus a little extra The game is in two parts. Combat and concentration or bonus interludes. To begin with you must defeat Toshio and Taro in the first two levels. The first two levels are set indoors looking out onto a variety of outdoor scenes, which vary from mountains to a lake scene, and even a seaport. In all there are five outdoor scenes and five different illustrations that adorn the interior of the first levels. One from each is chosen randomly giving a large variety of different interiors to fight in. KKll has all the usual karate moves you would expect to find in a combat game including high and kneeling punches, forward and backwards somersaults, and a selection of five assorted kicks. In all there are 16 different moves that can be made which takes some mastering, but a few games is all that is required to comes crashing down on the poor ice is outstanding Having warmed your hands up its time to meet Chozen in the castle of king Shohashi.

If you think this sounds like a tall order you're absolutely right, after all it took Myagi 40 years to catch his first fly. Your task isn't made any easier by the fact that Myagi can only move his joysticks around half the screen-a limitation not extended to the fly! A nice touch is the way his eyes follow the fly around the screen.

When will someone create a live science fiction adventure game? So, the people of Labyrinthe, and to anyone else with lots of money, will someone please create a live science fiction adventure game, with laser pistols, alien soldiers, a maze with six feet high walls, computers, corridors, rooms, a castle, etc? A space opera equivalent of the Labyrinth game? Let me know if someone has turned this idea into a reality Techo C+VG's reaction to the response to their Xevious competition. Virtually all the spaceship paintings/drawings were brilliant! My favourite artists include Chris Foss (how about a C+VG illustration cover by Foss?) Tony Roberts and Peter Elson Patrick Lee Herts Game graphics are improving all the time. Check out some of the Atari ST and Amiga adventures. Seeing is believing. As for live role playing games, they are becoming increasingly popular. The high tech style games you like are hugely expensive to set up.

But well now. those adventures This is the first time I have are the type written to your magazine so I hope pertaining to that you will tolerate the fact that swords and most of what I want to say has little to do with computers. First of all, when will someone create a computer game where the graphics make you feel that you're really in the scenario. Elite is one game that gives you the feeling that you're really in space, but what about walking on the ground of another planet, entering buildings, entering and flying spaceships, and doing all the sort of things that you'd dream of doing if you were on another planet. Mercenary when it is available for the Amstrad sounds very promising, but when you are outside a spaceship, you are apparently not armed with a hand blaster. Explorer, which has just come in, sounds like just the thing, except that the reviewers are unenthusiastic. I myself am not interested in this game, if you have to wait for the graphics to build up every time you turn round. A large scale version, ie Swords n' Socery, would be welcome, I think. Cholo probably makes up for the things missing in "

FOOD COLLECT -HOLDING -B10UNDS -FULTER VERTONRY Believe it or not, it's been around 18 months since word of System 3's The Last Ninja was first heard. Now, at last, the Commodore 64 version of the game is due out in the shops in May. As you can see it's another martial arts extravaganza but, hope System 3, one with something extra to make it stand out from its many rivals. The added ingredient this time is that the Ninja must explore complex mazes, searching, for food, weapons, visiting shrines for guidance as to which objects must be collected to complete the level. These will include various items such as a flower, glove. And all the time there are the Ninja warriors to do battle with plus extra hazards such as fire-breathing dragons and tricky swamps. The ultimate aim is for the Ninja to find the secret scrolls of the Ninja which are hidden in a palace. The Last Ninja will be a multi-load game because of its size. The first four levels have 25 screens each and the last two levels 15 screens each. The movement of the Ninja is really impressive as are the exotic backgrounds. It may be an unfair comparison but it looks like The Last Ninja could be the game Fist II should have been. They both combine fight action with exploration. Early signs are that Ninja should be triumphant. NIN FOOD FOOD -COLLECT -COLLECT -HOLDING SIHOLOC LUNDT SERPONRY NINA "

A PERFECT NIGHT FOR MURDER** \"I Hercule Holmes, had gotten used to nights like this. As the world's greatest detective and resident house dick of the infamous Gargoyle Hotel, I've made a living looking for the subtle signs of impending foul play. Gloomy weather, blood curdling screams, gunshots, empty bottles of poison, bodies tumbling down stairs, a mutilated corpse or even an axewielding maniac might slip right by the untrained private eye. But to a master sleuth like myself, these telltale signs can only mean one thing. The Murder Club has just checked in!\" Poiso! CERERE CONTINUE **The Murder Club? Yes, the Murder Club! Five of the world's bestselling murder mystery writers who transpose their fictional pulp plots into real-life murder and mayhem. Once again they have convened for their annual reunion here at the Gargoyle Hotel. And once again the dark, damp halls will echo with the cries of *Don't shoot!\". I've been poisonedl. Who stabbed me?\". I've been shortsheeted!', and 'Who took all the hot water? Yes, with the Murder Club as tonight's guests, more than the plumbing will be amiss!\" **Each member of The Murder Club will try to bump off the others and lay down claim to the crown of \"World's Greatest Murderer'. But it will not be a piece of quiche! For these brilliant criminal minds must match wits with moi. Hercule Holmes! I have only until midnight to discover the would-be murderer, victim, murder weapon and the scene of the crime.\" *At my disposal will be every imaginable piece of high tech crimestopping gadgetry known to sleuthdom: minicameras, hidden bugs, even wire taps. Yet all these modern electronic wonders cannot replace my inherent ability as a born detective... instincts passed from generation to generation in the Holmes family Therefore, I accept the challenge. I will uphold the family honour! Before this night is over I will prevent a murder or be murdered trying!

A chequered floor riddled with pitholes, a barrage of obstacles that hinder your progress and no go areas that bring you to a standstill make this race against time increasingly impossible. But not everything is against you. Springboards are primed to catapult you forward and a speeding skateboard waits ready to hurtle you along that desperate rush to the finish line. If you beat the clock the first time there's no guarantee you'll not be flattened at the next level. name CBI 64/128 Cassette .99 Disk .99 Amstrad Cassette .99 Disk .99 Spectrum Cassette .99 Atari ST Disk .99  1985 Namco Ltd U.S. Som rade ne GOLD: U.S. Gold Limited Units 2/3 Holford Way, Holford, Birmingham B6 7AX.
