"THEWS True Virtual Reality could be in your arcade soon... Philips' CD-i player finds a powerful friend in Virgin Interactive Entertainment... A graphical stunner is set to make waves on 3DO... Inter-play games with Ocean... Bugs Bunny's coming soon to SNES... and go golfing on Game Boy with Konami! ADVANCED CD-I IN VIRTUAL REALITY VIRGIN SET TO HIT TERRITORY ARCADE COIN-OPS ivision, the world's leading supplier of VR technology, has recently signed a deal with a major amusement manufacturer which could see revolutionary advancements in immersive VR entertainment and you could be playing the games by the end of the year! Virtual Reality Games Ltd looks set to be at the forefront of VR coin-ops with some very ambitious ideas for the technology. The company comes from a background of producing 3D games, so it is looking to produce VR games with traditional gameplay elements lacking from existing VR machines. This will mean bonus rounds, secret rooms, passwords, bosses, power-ups and even cheats. Thanks primarily to Division's new VR technology, Virtual Reality Games Ltd. will be able to produce truly complex games without having to worry about the limitations of the hardware and that's a fairly unheard-of proposal for VR hardware. So advanced is the technology in fact, that it Imagine being able to play as this may be supporting creature. 'Feeling' every move. up to 16 players simultaneously in Soon you will be able to one environment. play VR games with up to Given this, the idea 16 other people. is to establish a 'virtual cinema' network through franchising, enabling you to pick your choice of game like you would with films in a cinema. The company is also talking about producing motion based cockpits, which will mean you get physically chucked around like you would in an industrial flight simulator. All-in-all, we think it sounds flipping exciting, and we've been promised a free ride sometime in March, so hang-on for our report. t has been announced that Virgin Interactive Entertainment is to produce software for Philips' CD-I player. Details are scarce at time of going to press, but the deal involves Virgin developing three CD-i titles converted from PC CD-ROM games which the company has in production. We aren't sure exactly which Virgin games are to get the CD-i treatment, but everybody knows the volume of compact disc-based software which it has in its portfolio Demolition Man, The Terminator, Dune and 7th Guest II (the prequel to which, produced by Philips' own programmers, is nearing completion on CD-i and should be featuring in the very next issue) are among the obvious favourites to appear on the machine, but we're also told that it could be something completely different. We'll be bringing you more information as it hits, so keep your eyes peeled to CVG over the next couple of issues for further developments. INTERPLAYING WITH OCEAN ant to buy a copy of Rock 'n' Roll Racing or Clayfighters, but can't find it under 'l' for Interplay? That's because you've got to peruse the 'O' section for Ocean, for it is they who will be releasing these two SNES games. Interplay aren't bowing out of the SNES market or anything like that; they just don't distribute their own cartridge product in the UK, that's all. Another World, for instance, was distributed by Bandai, while Lost Vikings was handled by Nintendo themselves. "


"MAC'S BACK SandaDom QODOS) ata East will soon ship an enhanced sequel to Elite's Joe & Mac on the SNES. There are plenty of new weapons in this and rather than knocking opponents off the screen with them, Joe and Mac now hammer them into the ground. You can expect more of the graphic humour of the original with silly expressions on sprites and more objects, and scenery interaction like driving round in vehicles and swimming in streams. Out now on Import. ANOTHER WORLD TO GO ON 3DO O INTERPLAY 0865 390029 This sequel even lets you climb into different driving devices. nterplay is all set to release that oldish, but graphically acclaimed US Gold game Another World on the 3DO. It'll go by the title of Out Of This World and is looking very smart indeed. The game is a Same graphics as other formats, but series of cine the detail and colour is immense. matic sequences which you have to trigger off by performing a number of tasks. There's some blasting, and dodge-'em action along the way, and essentially it's a less puzzley version of Flashback out now on other formats. The layout is all the same, but the 3DO version benefits from more detailed graphics, smoother animation and dramatic music. We'll review it next issue. It's even possible to go swimming, but watch out for dangers. Again, you get some really silly expressions on the characters. GREEN SCREEN GREEN GRASS OKONAMI 081-429 2446 Nintendo Another World gets a new name for 3DO. Out Of This World on 3DO probably will be. sw 70 onami is ULTRA about to ULTRA release Konami Golf on the Game Boy which is going to be a top notch simulation of the game featuring 36 different holes and the ability to scroll through an entire course before the shot. Before each Nintendo shot the game will also suggest the best club to use and there are many skills open to the player like applying backspin or topspin to the ball. You also get a two-player mode which is quite fun. RABBIT RAMPAGE There are heaps of options for swinging. FRIRRY ollowing on from its recent Daffy Duck release, Sunsoft is finishing off its latest Looney Tunes game based on the rather more likeable Bugs Bunny. This one looks a lot more fun, with more variation in gameplay, better animation, and a more cartoonish feel. Bugs can splat cakes at people and perform a super kick and a couple of wrestling moves. There's a lot of funny moments in the game and familer characters from top Bugs cartoons. Due in the early new year, it's looking good. You can scroll to view the entire course. JAGUAR BITES ACCOLADE atest in the long line of software houses being scratched by the Jaguar 64-bit is Accolade. Five new titles are in the process of being produced for the Jag from the people who brought you Pele and Winter Challenge (reviewed this issue). Bubsy the Bobcat will be appearing in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind. Brett Hull Hockey will also be making the shunt, offering an 84-game season. Hardball 3 will boast rendered stadiums, while Charles Barkley Baseball will offer a tough sporting challenge. Finally, Jack Nicklaus' Power Challenge Golf will offer digitised visuals and a not-shabby game, too. We'll bring you more on these babies very soon. There's plenty of familiar characters to meet and beat in Sunsoft's new Bugs Bunny game. "

"NEWS NEW CD32 BUNDLE SEGA GOES O COMMODORE 0628 770088 O 64-BIT AMIGA CD32 EET ega Japan has finally confirmed that a 64-bit processor will be present in the forthcoming Saturn console, now due for release at the end of 1994. The main processor is still going to be a 32-bit RISC chip, with the 64bit aspect being set aside for the video processor. The Saturn will even feature a wide-screen display mode and is fitted with 24 Mb of RAM (which is a lot). Already there are reports that Virtua Fighter (see our coin-op review on page 100) and the Sonic coin-op are in the process of being converted. We'll see, and keep you posted as always.

It hardly sets off your emotions. Top game.             .     SONY 071-734 5151 O etails are secretive, but Sony is all set to release a CD-based console by the close of '94 in Japan. European distribution is unlikely however, until late 1995. The machine looks like being based around a 32Bit RISC chip-set, running CD-ROM software only with the graphics power and special effects of most systems on the market. In fact, Sony Japan is suggesting that the machine will advance beyond the super systems being developed by Sega and Nintendo. Let's hope that with the birth of 32 and 64-bit technology hitting the market, those naff 8-bit systems will finally roll over and die. Just think, the Spanish will never get to do a fly kick.

Not content with being the biggest selling game of the year, Virgin Music has now released the official single on CD and 12in. The techno based tracks performed by The Immortals (who have had a series of major White Label hits storming the Lapland snowboarding scene) includes familiar game samples and character namechecks. This can't be any worse than the Tetris single, and it's not any where near as embarrassing to be seen with. Give it a spin. FULL MOTION VIDEO ut soon, we hope, will be Commodore's eagerly awaited Full Motion Video board (FMV) for the CD32. Like the one out now for Philips CD-I, the board conforms to the MPEG (MOTION PICTURE EXPERT GROUP) standard so you'll get compatibility with the growing library of featuremovies being released on 5-inch CD.

In fact, it seems as though Ocean has decided to cut more than a few corners as the SNES version of Untouchables is exactly the same as the Amiga version, which was a licence of the film back in 1989.

"GORE BLIMEY! MORTAL KOMBAT 2 IS HERE! MORTAL KOMBAT 33733) TISTES No sooner do we get over the media hype surrounding Mortal Kombat, than Williams go and hit us with the follow-up! It's bigger, better and bloodier than before, and CVG's got the exclusive pictures! It's fair to say that Mortal Kombat caused something of a stir during the latter part of 1993. The only real contender to the Streetfighter crown, Mortal Kombat was the name on the lips of the mass media whenever videogame violence was brought into the limelight, thanks to its highly graphic Death Moves. The game courted controversy left, right and centre, but that didn't stop the home versions selling thousands of copies and shooting straight to number one in the charts. The violence argument rages on, but that hasn't deterred Williams, creators of the coin-op original, from producing a sequel and we've got the shots to prove it! (59) 17 "

Mighty Kombat moves, such as new baddy Kung Lao's hat being used as a decapitation tool à la James Bond, and some incredible new fatality attacks which include the use of said hat to chop opponents in half and, even more impressive, Liu Kang (from the original) turning into a 20 foot dragon and biting his adversary in two! The new version of Mortal Kombat, imaginatively titled Mortal Kombat 2, comes complete with a clutch of new characters, new attacks and an array of jaw-dropping death moves. The plot, such that it is, is that Shang Tsung has been beaten by Sonya who 'has captured the wanted Kano. Shang Tsung now joins the list of Kombateers in a new challenge a challenge that consists of 12 different fighters this time round! The version we played is one of only a handful of machines in the country, and at time of going to press only version 1.1 is available, without a 'Test Your Might' bonus game, which Williams apparently intends to include from versions 2.0 onwards. The company is reckoned to have spent $35,000 on digitising the fighters in MK2 using professional equipment and costumes in Unfortunately, you can't see the state of the bloke who got uppercutted in this pic.

"CLASS OF 194 MEGA DRIVE 6 MEGA-CD Yes, Commodore may have unveiled its new CD-based system. And, yes, Atari has bravely entered the 64-bit zone with the Jaguar but Sega isn't afraid. MegaTech's Editor, STEVE MERRETT, explains why... et's face it, when you buy a video game system, you want the machine with the widest variety of software available. You want all the latest film tie-ins (along with all the best forthcoming movie licences), Greatest HeavyweightsSega's new big fight contender reviews Knockout! Funky! and Too Jum & Lar || inside! you want all the latest coinop conversions for it. Hey, and if you fancy stretching the old brain cells a bit, let's add some flight sims and puzzle games to that list, yeah? Well, if that's what you're after, look no further than the Sega Mega Drive. Yeah, the Amiga and PC-owning snobs will sneer and say you can't get a decent RPG for it but, hey, Monkey island is now available for the Mega-CD with Eye Of The Beholder on the way. And you try getting something as playable and visually impressive as Aladdin for the Amiga or PC... just look at Sonic CD and Core Design's Thunderhawk if you don't believe me. And that's another thing the Mega Drive can offer a future. While there's no doubt 1993 saw the Mega Drive come into its own, 1994 will be THE year for the system. The software on the horizon is fantastic, with Sonic about to make his third appearance, and the coinop classic, Virtua Racing, set to break new barriers in coin-op conversion technology. What's more, old Amiga faves like Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker and Goal! are on their way, making the purchase of a Commodore machine virtually redundant after all, why wait a few minutes for Jimmy White to load when the Mega Drive version just slots in and there's no hassle regarding ball update and other such tedious techy matters.

It's not that it's not great to play games on, just that it's not naturally geared up to it like the others are. For one thing, there's the price. I know I couldn't afford to buy a PC just to play games. I bought it, I'm sad to say because I needed it for work. Sure, games were a large part of the reason (Rebel Assault, Ultima Underworld, IndyCar Racing etc), but we're talking about ,000 for a good and decent PC and that's a lot of dosh.

Can be a touch complicated X-Wing is just typical of a PC game a stunning, graphically wonderous game that's just teeming with atmosphere. Don't think that the PC's domain is just flight sims and RPGs; it can run Mortal Kombat as well as the consoles. NUDE PCs you want to play games over phone lines you can buy a PC modem the size of a credit card now.. Full-motion video? Yes, 3DO and CD-i games look great. But the PC can do that too — the ReelMagic card runs full screen full motion games. Because, hey, when you get right down it, it's all about who has the best games and the PC has more than its fair share of original, breathtaking and, of course, BIG games. co Back in the bad old days For a long time the PC was the poor relation of the games family, saddled with all the boring games; the intense hex-based strategy, sadder-than-sad RPGs and serious flight sims. Now, there's nothing wrong with these, it's just that you can have too much of a 'good' thing. The best games eventually make it to the PC but it usually takes a long time. But all that's changed in the past year. The PC still gets its share of dodgy conversions, but a lot of good games are now appearing on PC first, and sometimes they wipe the floor with the other formats. But the best thing about the PC is the variety of games it can cope with. Games get bigger and more demanding all the time and if any games machine can take these in its stride it's the PC. Usually this is because of the sheer size of games, their hi-res graphics and the huge processing power required. It's not that the PC is head and shoulders above the rest in ALL departments — it's just head and shoulders above the rest in most of them. From a gameplaying point of view, the PC has strange habits. Not BELLE least of which is the fact that nine times out of ten it arrives naked. The PC's sound for example is useless for games. You want stereo four channel music not 'beep, beep, beeeeep' and the odd resonant 'blurt'. So what do you have to do? Buy a sound card that's what. Then a joystick. Then a CD-ROM drive, then another joystick for flight sims and so on. The good thing about this is that you get to choose what you want on your PC. If you suddenly get into a particular type of game you can custom build the most awesomely perfect machine for it. The catch? Well you've got to pay for it, and it isn't cheap. GOOD POINTS Think about the future Just think about the future. Think about a time when people want more from their games machine than another cute platform game or a racing game. Think about CD and video and stereo sound. Think about multiplayer battles, hi-res simulators and movie-esque space epics. The PC can do all this. It's high tec and there's really no machine that can match it. So if you're looking for a machine that will take you into the future, and that won't be obsolete two years after you've bought it and that can play Rebel Assault, Oh! What a scare! I never thought to Mega Race, Inferno and Alone in the Dark make it... I'm wet but safe and sound, without batting an eyelid, look no further than the PC.

"CLASS OF '94 SNES games means quality games, because no game gets published without the Nintendo Seal of Quality NINTENDO Nintendo SUPER Famicom Nintendo made the jump from 8-bit to 16bit with one of the most ground-breaking consoles ever seen and it's holding its own in the marketplace today. Editor of Nintendo Magazine System, TIM BOONE, gives you the reasons why it should be your next big buy ook, this is so obvious I don't know why I'm writing it. But the boys at CVG asked me to explain why the SNES is the greatest console in the world, and who am I to refuse? If you don't already know that the SNES is the greatest console in the world I'm afraid there's not much hope for you is there? And if you own any machine except Nintendo then you might as well face up to the facts: you've been sold a dodo. The SNES is the big boy of the three Nintendo consoles and it remains the most popular console in the world. Since its Japanese launch in 1990, Nintendo's 16-bit monster has reigned supreme and will continue to do No platforming character has been around longer than Mario (Sonic who he?), and\" we all know what format he's on.

Cast a glance at the technical specifications of the beast and it's still vastly impressive today. At any one time the machine can display 256 colours from a palette of 32,768 and it delivers eight-channel digital stereo sound. To hear this at its best, hook up the SNES to your stereo and play Streetfighter Turbo. Heard anything better? I don't think so.

"INSIDE THE SNES A Link To The Past where else are you going to experience gaming legends such as these? They are at the very apex of great gaming, and they're all on the Super Nintendo. The machine cannot be beaten for value for money either. With the Mario All Stars SNES machine bundle currently selling at less than , and a wide variety of games similarly bundled in attractive deals, you'll have to go a long way to make your money go further. And if you're not into buying bundles, nowadays there are hundreds of games available and their size and complexity is growing all the time. Some of these are written by Nintendo, direct from their research and development facilities in Kyoto, Japan. The majority, however, are written by thirdparty developers, who must submit games for evaluation before earning the Nintendo Seal Of Quality and the right to publish them. CPU CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT: The heart of the SNES, controlling everything that the machine does. Although the machine contains specialist graphics and sound chips, the CPU commands them, calculates the maths to deliver the games and constantly monitors everything in memory. PPU 1 and 2 PICTURE PROCESSING UNITS: Control the graphics and special effects delivered by the SNES. They manipulate scaling and Nintendo is planning a 64-bit successor to rotation modes to allow enlargement and the SNES in 1995, then it'll probably be manipulation of any sprite from any angle. time for Streetfighter The Twilight Years. WORK RAM: Used to store data during gameplay, enemies killed, score, items picked up etc. This work RAM is erased when the machine is switched off, which means battery back-up is required by all carts which save scores and position. You want good FX Perhaps the biggest reason for buying the SNES is for Super FX. Demands for better games led to the The SNES is where you'll find the one of the most playable action platformers of the year Super Empire Strikes Back. DSP and SMP: These stand for Digital Sound Processor and Sound Micro Processor. These two processors control all sound generated by the SNES, reading data from games and converting them to the audible signals we hear. 62-PIN CONNECTOR: Cartridge slot through which all the data is transferred to processors within the SNES. It's important that all the pins on the connector and the cartridge are working at all times, and the protective cover keeps out dust when no cartridge is connected. RF MODULATOR: Converts signals generated by the CPU, PPU and Sound Processors into radio frequencies sent to your TV and/or stereo which decodes them to display pictures and play sound. MULTI OUT: This is the same as the RF modulator, but generates SCART signals for use on SCART monitors. EXT EXTENSION: Designed for connection of any special peripherals which Nintendo may develop. Initially this was added to accommodate a CD-ROM drive, but work on this project was scrapped in favour of the proposed 64-bit console. It's considered highly unlikely that Nintendo will ever support a CD platform due to its inherent drawbacks. SNES AT A GLANCE GUIDE complete and a series of games will be launched in 1994 aimed at the chip. Rumour has it that the FX2 will not be the last technical innovation to turbocharge the SNES... And let's not forget that the SNES is the forerunner to Project Reality, Nintendo's 64-bit wonder console planned for 1995. The machine is being co-developed by Silicon Graphics, who produce specialist animation machines costing ,000 upwards, but Nintendo will introduce their machine for less than . If Nintendo can achieve this, and there's very little doubt that they will, the machine will generate an even bigger stir than the SNES!

And quantity-wise you can't go wrong with the Amiga it's estimated there are over 1,000 games currently available for the machine. Of course, the quality of Amiga games is not to be sniffed at either. After all, it's true to say that the best games appear on the Amiga first. Think about it: all the truly classic games of the last few years Populous, Sensible Soccer, Frontier, Formula One Grand Prix came out on Amiga first.

What about a PC then? Ah, nice try but I'm afraid it's a similar story as the consoles, only the other way around. Oh, the PC is great for adventures, sims and strategy games, but a bit of a dog when it comes to anything even remotely arcadeorientated. (Have you seen the PC version of Street Fighter Il? Street Fighter Poo, more like.) What you want is the best of both worlds, a games machine that's as good at arcade games as it is at the more serious stuff like RPGs. I put it to you that the machine you are looking for is a Commodore Amiga. Consoles are crap And the sheer variety of Amiga games is staggering. You're not limited to endless platform games or identikit flight sims your Amiga can do anything. And because of this flexibility the Amiga is the only place you'll see original, different and exciting software. Come on would you ever see something as weird and downright funny as Wizkid on the squeaky-clean consoles? Then there's the price of the software. Not only are Amiga games top-quality, varied and original, Flight sims are not just the domain of PCs you know; you can fly high on Amiga too. 30 "

Without the gun, and because of poor programming and CD access, Mad Dog McCree is a lame duck; Star Trek: TNG: Picard and the boys boldly going where no one has gone before and nobody's likely to go again, solving mysteries and setting phasers to stun.

Estimates range from -, which could well price it out of the market, but then you've got to look at what the machine has to offer.

"CLASS OF '94 AMIGA CD 32 32bit Commodore's great grey hope for 1994 is CD32, the first 32-bit CD games machine. Deputy Editor of The One For Amiga, SIMON BYRON, tells you why you need this machine... BRITAINS THE endorsed the machine at its launch. Previously Commodore was never eager to promote its machines in the National Press, so to get a high profile personality to launch the machine is out of character. Why this is significant, though, is that it demonstrates Commodore is wholeheartedly behind the marketing of the machine. Commodore is doing this because it believes CD32 is a world beater. And when you look at the specifications you understand why. It's the world's first 32-bit CD console. This means stunning 3D texturemapped games like Liberation and Microcosm can be converted to CD32 easily, and will run as fast as they would on a PC. Microcosm, of course, features loads of digitised footage and the huge amount of information that can be stored on a CD enables programmers to come up with imaginative titles like this. On a standard computer you'd need 30 floppies to see these intros, and I doubt you'd ever get a cartridge with enough memory to store the sound, let alone the graphics. AMIGA GAMES AMIGA LIBERATION: HEM Sounds groovy And while we're on the subject of sound, most games that are solely developed for CD feature studio-quality music, which is invaluable when it comes to generating atmosphere. After all, if you are playing a gritty RPG you want mean and moody music. And any CD-based machine is capable of playing standard audio CDs, so when you're not struggling through the latest arcade games you can listen to Take That or what ever while you peruse your favourite games mag. CDs can store more info than a floppy disk or cart, which means more graphics, sound and levels can be packed in a game (like Liberation). Amiga, amigos ast summer Commodore stunned the videogaming industry by launching CD32. What caused everyone to sit up and take notice, though, was that it had managed to create a CD console with the most impressive tech specs this side of a Silicon Graphics machine (OK, a bit of an exaggeration, but CD32 can display 256 colours on-screen from a possible palette of 16.8 million), that would retail for less than . Perhaps the CD32's biggest advantage is it's an Amiga. This is important when you consider that most new formats only have a few games available for the first six months that it's on-sale, whereas by the time you've read this you'll be able to pick up over 40 games for the CD32. Over the next year you can expect to see software support for CD32 booming. Many companies agree CD technology is the way the industry should be heading and are investing huge amounts of time and money into research and development. CDs are cheap to produce and the risk of piracy is negligible, making the format an attractive proposition It's the first With a huge number of games machines on the market, the question an enthusiast should be asking is: why buy a CD32? Well, one bizarre reason is that Chris Evans 36 "

With people screaming out for a single home entertainment system, many video distributors are focussing on CD. For  you can now purchase most major film releases on a couple of discs, giving access to sharper picture quality as well as nearcinemaquality sound. The CD32 can play CD films (if you buy a Full Motion Video add-on for just under ), which means you could probably cajole your parents into buying one because they'll be able to watch Brief Encounter on it.

And if you're after a piece of software to impress your mates with then Psygnosis' Microcosm should be for you. Its use of videofootage is second to none and the game itself is not too bad either, if a bit basic. The other CD32 games available CD32 has its own platforming hero in are all ports from the standard the form of Zool, The Ninja from the Nth Amiga machine the A1200, with Dimension. Who needs bloody hedgehogs? additional animations and sound effects. Heading the list comes Gremlin's Zool, which although is getting on a bit, still scores highly in the playability department. Then you can take your pick from such Amiga favourites as Alien Breed 2, Nigel Mansell, Sleepwalker, Diggers, Oscar, Deep Core, Mean Arenas... the list goes on. Frontier and Uridium 2 will both be debuting on CD early next year with the former rumoured to be featuring texture-mapped graphics as previously seen in the PC version. Although we'll be treated to loads more games over the coming months, Renegade's Flight of the Amazon Queen, a graphic adventure, looks set to be the most impressive because it will be the first 'talkie' adventure the Amiga has ever seen.

"WORD UP WITH PAUL appy New Year! The games industry lurches into 1994, with new markets to exploit and better machines available on which to create more impressive games than ever before. Which can only be a good thing; 1993 could hardly go down as the year of originality, with an almost endless stream of Mario/Sonic clones and Streetfighter wannabees cluttering up the marketplace. Last year wasn't desperately rosy for cartridge sales either, according to several members of the industry. And who can be surprised when 90% of games are essentially the same, but with different graphics? Hopefully, the softcos will realise that people simply won't put up with this state of affairs; I think they already have, having largely been hit in the most painful place the wallet. We'll see big games, cheaper games and have even more fun than we had in \"93 if the boys with the wonga do actually pull their fingers out and realise that we're all getting a little tired of the same old thing.

"TIREVIEW SNES SNESI by ZAMUSE + Out now. Contact Console Concepts (0782 712759) for information. MACROSS Japanese animation is shockingly gruesome, and what better place for them than a super-scrolling space blast? Could Macross be the shoot-'em-up of '94? Anime wol I counted about 10 layers of parallax scrolling in this level! ith the enormous success of Manga videos, it's no surprise to see the anime influence slipping into video games. One of the most famous anime stars, Akira, has already found his way into Sega's awesome Virtua Fighters coinop. So while we all wait for an official Akira SNES game, another top Japanese anime series has formed the basis for the latest shoot-'em-up. Macross is nothing new gameplay wise, but there's nothing wrong with that because it does what it sets out to do very well. This incarnation is a throw back to the traditional elements of the genre, pumping layers of parallax scrolling, masses of baddies, hefty motherships, and those obviously exaggerated power-ups. When you plunge all this together and synchronise some typically metallic clashes, well mean music and a sprinkling of robot speech, then you get something rather cool and hip. Blink, and you'll miss something But it doesn't stop there. Macross is This stage is fab. There's lots of big attack craft chasing after you. DCC-OTOS DEE DIES PUSH You don't need to dodge the grey asteroids, but watch out for the enemy craft which like to swirl in behind you if you miss 'em. You must try and dodge the brown space debris. At this point the enemy start to enter the screen from all sides. SELECT PLAYER SELECT PLAYER THREE ISN'T A CROWD SELECT PLAYER TYPE=VISOLFOSTER TPC EVA1325-3 PILOT HIKARU PILOTA ERWALK 2013 Macross gives you three anime heroes to choose from. Each one has a ship which can transform into three different attack craft while in flight, and each of these has three types of power-up. Confused? Well check out the visuals on the right. JOAQA QOL Hikaru's ship has very powerful lasers, and is a good allrounder. Max's ship isn't very good because only the homing cannon is any good. Millia's girlie ship is similar to Max's in that only one of the weapons is worth bothering with, so a bit dull overall. "


"VERDICT SNES ADE There's nothing I like more than a decent shoot-'em-up, and there's been a distinct lack of them lately on the SNES. Until Macross came along that is, with its garish graphics, spectacular explosions and wondertul, over-the-top anime characters; it's all that a good shoot-'em-up should be. The gameplay, well it's there; alien ships are unpredictable and end-of-level bosses have their full quota of Mode 7, in fact Macross wreaks of it, the only thing lacking is some really hefty weapons. Other than that it's a real top game. This mid-level boss has a habit of launching black-holes which suck in your ship. keep clear. PROS: Spectacular graphics that never let up, and a great anime licence. CONS:No two-player option, and a couple of the craft are a bit lame, GARY LORD blessed with professionalism, it never slows down, no matter what's on the screen, and that's where every other SNES blaster to date has failed (except Super Aleste). What's also impressive (as it was in Axelay) is the atmospheric Mode 7 effects which give it that anime feel, and best of which is the black hole effect which sucks the screen inwards. It's little touches like these which give reasons to buy 'another' blaster. S UUT GRAPHICS Superb special effects and defined visuals. Tough as old boots ONNOS Loud, satisfying and atmospheric music. Throughout this level missiles keep flying across the screen, so destroy this launcher to stop 'em. GAMEPLAY There's no slow down, and the action overload makes this a dream. With all this going on you might be expecting Macross to be a tougher than leather shootout, and it is to a point, but it really depends on the choice of craft that you enter the challenge with. The three ships are not really well balanced in their effectiveness, and one of them appears decisively more potent than the others. Macross is perhaps the most involving shoot-'em-up yet to appear on the SNES. The balance of appeals is spot on and you get to power-up quickly. What more could you want? Costly, but it is a big game. It's all that you'd expect from a decent bloater STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 This huge ship breaks apart so keep your distance and avoid the enemy which hide around. ON WOOOO VERDICT UNUT MUUT  MISS.OK HIT! While Macross is a mould of previous blasters, it is also individualist in its approach to gameplay. Someone has stepped back, looked at other blasters and made one that's fast, exciting, challenging and doesn't slow down. Resultantly, this quickly beckons itself to be the perfect shoot-'em-up. Everything's bundled in this from the selection of attack craft to the exaggerated motherships. Plenty of visual effects create an atmosphere not found in recent blasters. The only drawback is there's no two-player option. 89 DENIZ AHMET This weapon is a trailing bolt of plasma which can be controlled to act like a shield. 43 "

There are various traps and puzzles to obstruct your gang that hinder your progress; Olaf's shield can deflect alien fire and be used as a makeshift parachute; Baelog is the firepower, his bow and arrow is dead useful for flicking inaccessible switches and disposing with unwanted aliens.

If platform puzzlers are your thang, then there's plenty here to amuse, frustrate and excite.

"TREVIEW SNES SNES by EMPIRE by EMPIRE .99 Dexter better watch out. His princess isn't what she seems. She'll change into a baddie. Out February. Contact Empire (081-343 7337) for information. There's a lot of jumping in this game, but it's very hard to judge the size of gaps. Is there more to a game than attractive graphics? Space Ace finally shows how it's done Deceptive appearances The graphics have a lavish and detailed cartoon feel to them, and this surrealism is one of the game's main attractions. Particularly spectacular are the number of huge animated sprites in the game, and these have a bad habit of appearing at the most awkward of moments and you have to jump past them. You can complete each level in at least two ways, and at key points in the game you have the chance to energise and earn yourself pace Ace has thankfully reached the SNES in a totally revamped version from its more-than-crap coin-op brother. Unlike the coinop, which only required you to move the joystick once every few minutes, this version is actually a proper game. What you find in Space Ace is a huge focus on providing variety in the gameplay. Out of the 25 levels, expect to encounter shoot-'em-up stages, bike races, underwater battles, platform dodge-'em action and even roller skating within a rotating maze. There's lots of animated bits in this game and why not, when you've got Sullivan Bluth doing them! Having energised, Dexter will find himself equipped with a gun. VERDICT Space Ace shows off the SNES colour palette better than any other game. It also embodies a collection of the biggest sprites ever. Fortunately the gameplay hasn't been sacrificed for the visuals, and there's a large variety of game styles. The game is difficult to start off with, and it takes a while to get used to the collision detection, but thereafter the game provides a hook with the lure of more impressive action. It would have been nice if the game had some more shooting action on the platform stages, but this is still brilliant. Dexter is about to jump to his death. When confronting bosses always keep your distance in order to learn their attack patterns. PAUL RAND 48 "


"VERDICT GOOD LOOKS RUN IN THE FAMILY SNES Niniendo SUPER Famicom You'll need plenty of patience with Space Ace, because you tend to die incredibly often; but once you work out the safe spots you can get through with little hassle. This game is about learning attack patterns, though there's enough levels and variety in game styles to give it lastability. Each level scrolls continuously so you have to think quick or you'll end up dead. This can get frustrating, but it's worth it to see the superb graphical detail and colour. It's the sort of visually lavish game others try to be but can't achieve. SUPER NINTENDO PROS: The best cartoon graphics yet seen on the SNES. CONS: It's very difficult, and there are no passwords. DENIZ AHMET Space Ace has been put together by ODE (who were the team behind Team Yankee and Pacific Islands) in conjunction with Sullivan Studios. Sullivan Bluth Studios hold the talents of 14 ex-Walt Disney animators who left the latter in 1979 because they felt that they could do a better job at the huge Dublin-based Sullivan company. By 1984 the firm had established itself as a major force in the industry with its Spielberg release of An American Tail. This became the highest grossing animated feature for a first release. Sullivan Bluth has since gone on to produce such classics as The Land Before Time and All Dogs Go to Heaven, and the company's next film, scheduled for release later this year, is Rock-A-Doodle. Considering the animating pedigree behind such a game it's no wonder Space Ace looks so smart! GRAPHICS Very impressive use of colour huge sprites and parallax. Silly music which does match the action well. Good speech. GAMEPLAY Lots of variety, but a tab repetitive and dull. Too hard for some. There's plenty of variety in the gameplay; this underwater stage is a shoot-'em-up. There are plenty of shoot-'em-up stages like this. 'a gun (but you'll have to pick up energy disks first). Once energised a huge monster will appear from somewhere and probably kill you instantly. After a few encounters with these cretins you'll notice that they always attack the centre of the screen first, so it's best to dash to the edge of the screen the moment you energise. It's a very big game which is going to take ages to complete. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES ent routes so not all of the game is predetermined. Even so, any destination you choose is going to be incredibly hard. This is due to the loose collision detection which can become very frustrating after a while. Space Ace does gives you plenty of lives to compensate for the fact that it's very difficult. Combine that with a lack of passwords and you have a game which will take yonks to complete. 100 It's a mazin' A space maze allows you to progress through the game via differHaving energised, this is the type of monster you'll have to deal with.

The free game is Apache, a pretty ropey Choplifter rip-off. It does feature decent parallax scrolling, samples and an atmospheric Brimble score though, and as it's free you can't really complain.

The 256-colour screens are lovely, as is the ultra-smooth scrolling. And Allister Brimble has come up with some astonishing title music, in-game tunes and FX which add tons of atmosphere.

Small, furious and rather furry, the Tinies score in a stonking puzzle'em-up from those Mindscape people CD planet to find everything not as it should be. A nasty character has used a transformation ray to alter all the other Tinies into killer zombies. King Tinie looks in serious bother here though... Looks like it's a job for James Tinie Kirk and his crew. nyone who's played computer games for a while has probably come across a game written by our French chums. It may be a generalisation but the one thing you tend to notice is that whoever programs them must be completely mad, because the games are bizarre to say the least. The plot thickens EEEEE What about this one though? Blue can swim underwater, hence why they called him blue. Like my goodself Red likes a pie or two but as there's no shop about he has to munch whatever's around in this case bricks! What's worse, the king's been kidnapped and he's the only one with the special powers that are needed to return his subjects to normal. Guess who you've got to rescue then? The game plays like Lemmings with the speed of Sonic (on an A1200 anyway). You've got to guide four of the Tinies, each with their own different skills, across numerous puzzle-infested platforms to the exit. All the usual puzzle-type things are here, falling blocks, spikes, pits, that type of thing. It's great basically. GRAPHICS Fury of the Furies is completely mad too. The plot is well, two biscuits short of a packet really, and from what I can manage to gather from the manual and the intro, it goes something like this.

He's got a grappling hook that can be fired in mid-air, this means you can complete a level without him even touching the ground! To be honest I'm not the greatest fan of these puzzle-type action games. The last one that managed to shake up my grey matter was Lemmings, but fury has affected me in a similar way. It's clearly based on the Psygnosis classic, though rather than being some cheap rip-off it boasts loads of brilliantly original ideas.

"SNES VERDICT VOGELWNTEMDE * I love footy and I'm a big platform fan so just the idea of Ocean's latest excited me. Thankfully the game has been implemented as well as the idea, although the graphics and sound have clearly been ported across from the Amiga original which is disappointing. Where are all those lovely console effects demanded nowadays? Still, the game's a blast with heaps of variety and a long lasting challenge. Control of the ball can be fid dly at first but once mastered you won't put this down until it's complete. The first zone in England is Home Town. The idiot you can see is a builder called Derek. PROS: Neat idea, large challenge and very playable. CONS: Ball control can be dodgy at times and the game's pretty tough. RIK SKEWS Kick the ball at the baddies to do 'em. Great fun but it can take a while to master. GRAPHICS Much the same as the Amiga version. No thrills but pleasant enough. ONNOS Appalling music and some uninspired FX. Inside the factory level. Trying to avoid the fireballs and sparks is hard enough, but wait until you meet the mad professor. lar features in the game too like restart points and powerups. These are generally found in chests and can be grabbed by kicking the chest with the ball until it explodes. Eleven cards need to be found on each level then a special bonus room can be entered where Soccer Kid attempts to get a piece of the cup. Just make sure you complete the game so England can win the World Cup in 1998 OK?! both platform and footy based it's been implemented superbly and contains a host of great features. The most obvious is the way Soccer Kid is controlled. None of this jump on their head business or blast the baddies with obscenely large powerups, no siree! Soccer Kid solves puzzles and kills baddies by blatting them with his football. Clever stuff huh? There's all the reguGAMEPLAY Frustrating at first, but long term play is rewarding. VERDICT Should keep you amused well into the new year. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES It's got football in it so I'm bound to like it right? Well yes, but Soccer Kid has more than enough redeeming features to soften my hardened and cynical exterior. Admittedly the graphics and sonics have obviously been ripped from the Amiga version but the gameplay is what gives it an edge.

The Voyeur manual goes to great lengths to explain it's an adult game and Philips has provided a lockout feature (see the 'Enter the Code picture caption).

You can also send your evidence to other characters. Make sure you choose carefully though... Pros: Graphics, sound. It really is an interactive movie. Cons: Sooner or later scenes will start to repeat. DENIZ AHMET pretty strong. So if you think your parents will disapprove, then stay away from the game!

Even so, this is still playable for what it is, and no worse than US Gold's Winter Olympics where gameplay is concerned.

Vamp To prevent Drac being rebom you can play as either Johnny Morris or Eric Lecarde, both of whom are descendants of the vampire-hunting Belmont family Different weapons come with each, but Eric's lance is far more destructive than Johnny's whip.

"VERDICT MEGA DRIVE 16-BIT As a fan of the SNES original, i find this Mega Drive version dull in comparison. The graphics are bad, and it lacks the attack manoeuvrability of the SNES. What most players will find however, is that it's just too easy. There are some nice effects however, especially the sprite rotation, which is a difficult thing for a Mega Drive to do. You also get some very nice bosses to contend with, such as the spectacular multi-part clockwork monster on level four. Even so, it's fun while it lasts, if a little lacking in substance. chase while others camouflage themselves against the backdrops springing on you unexpectedly (and annoyingly). It's just a shame that you can kill most of them so easily. The other thing which starts to happen as you progress is that platforms and major bits of scenery start crumbling, sliding, and rotating beneath your feet which causes some problems if you mess up, because the clock is continuously ticking away. You've probably gathered by now that there are quite a few extra surprises lurking in Castlevania, and it's this added element that makes you want to play what is otherwise a standard platformer. PROS: Very playable and atmospheric, plus plenty of surprise to spur you on. CONS: Poor graphics and no long term appeal. DENIZ AHMET Bring a camera While in Paris some monsters like to get crafty and attack from the air. Eric can deal with them fairly swiftly, but Johnny struggles with his naft whip. which often conceal more than just extra points, usually they contain additional weapons, which come in handy though you can only use them for a limited period. These can be anything from huge axe heads to bottles of lethal potions. The quest lasts for six levels over various countries and you by-pass some famous landmarks along the way, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Throughout the journey there are many wall-mounted ornaments, Some stages look good, some look dreadful. Special effects are pretty decent. Are you startin'? Nice atmospheric tunes and plenty of them. Chilling sound effects too. As you progress the opponents do get more aggressive, so your early attack strategies need to change progressively. Some start to give 180 1881 As you progress the scenery frequently crumbles away under you. Try to learn where this happens. A wobbly screen is a good indication. Johnny prepares to embark on his quest. This is just the intro screen which is why it looks good.  Lots of mindless action and a true arcade adventure feel to it. It's too easy though. There's a lot to see and battle, yet it isn't going to last long for your money. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Inside the house hit the candles for points and special weapons if you're lucky. NONWOO llllllllllll VERDICT IM SOK HIT! TIES Castlevania is a playable and atmospheric slash-'em-up, and you'll probably stick with it for a while, simply because it continuously offers up strange visual treats and a suspense-filled scrolling scenery. Of the two characters, Eric is much better than Johnny, so you'll always find yourself selecting the former and his lance, though enemy hits always seem to send you flying. Castlevania is well designed but unfortunately, it's easy to get through and without a two-player mode there's little to return to. Encounters with water make nasty fish-like creatures appear which proceed to spit water at you. They are fast and you're not, basically. PAUL RAND 63 "

Each Eternal Champions contestant is unique in abilities and character. Here's a run down on each including their special moves. But remember there are secret special moves which we couldn't possibly comment on: MIDKNIGHT Bio-scientist, Mitchell Knight, fell foul of his own concoctions and turned into a vampire. Refusing to feed on human blood he rotted and snuffed it. Midknight partakes in a whirlwind romance... with death! ETERNAL CHAMPIONS SPECIAL MOVES: LIFE DRAIN: Midknight grabs his opponent's head when at close range draining about 17% of their energy. MIST ATTACK Transforming himself into an invincible gaseous mist, Midknight usually attacks his enemy from above. SLASH As an exceptional Neanderthal, Slash was killed by his people when he suggested something radical like inventing the wheel. Check out the game that could knock the mother of all beat-'emups off the top spot... Slash 'n' Larcen practice their new Madness routines. The balance between good and evil is precarious, and with the number of politicians ever on the increase, evil is usually tipping the scales in Satan's favour. For centuries the Etemal Champion, a wise old chap with the collective spiritual force of all warriors ever, has been keeping an eye on the situation but now it's got out of control. His solution is to find a champion from one of nine warriors. The main thing they have in common is they were all tragically killed at crucial moments in time. Resurrection Now the Etemal Champion has resurrected them to fight among themselves so a winner can emerge. Like Streetfighter II, you can choose a variety of fighters who all have their own strengths, weaknesses SPECIAL MOVES BATTER-UP CLUB SWING: A vicious uppercut swipe with a chunk of wood. SPINAL CRUSH: Slash crushes his opponents' backbones by vaulting on their heads with his club. SHADOW Former ninja assassin, Shadow got religion and quit killing, but her bosses disposed of her via a 101 storey window, instead of with a P45. RAX An ex-kickboxer, RAX implanted cybernatic body parts in order to compete in their fights. Unfortunately his agent shut down his vital signs just as he was about to take the world championship. SPECIAL MOVES JET KNEE SMASH: Ankle-rockets boost RAX across the screen at great speed, driving his opponent into the wall. OVERLOAD: By focusing all his power in one fist or foot, RAX delivers a mega-powerful charging punch or kick at his enemy. BLADE A bounty hunter sent to deal with a rogue scientist who'd developed a virus capable of wasting the world! Sadly, Blade's bust went sour and the vial containing the plague was broken. SPECIAL MOVES TRACKING BLADE: A rocketcontrolled saw blade homes in on the enemy and explodes after digging into their flesh. POWER DRAIN: Blade launches his Power Probe from his wrist into his opponent's forehead. Not great on the damage stakes, though. LARCEN TYLER A cat burglar who was framed by his boss. Larcen finds the parcel he's carrying is not the false evidence that helped frame him, but in fact a bomb aimed at the chief of police, but it blowsLarcen's head off instead. SPECIAL MOVES: SHADOW MODE: Pressing X, Y and Z causes Shadow to melt into her namesake. Moving as a living shadow, Yamoto is invincible for five seconds. TWIRLING FAN ATTACK: This begins with a deadly kick and ends with a lashing blow from her Ninja fan. SPECIAL MOVES CEILING DROP: Using his hand and foot climbing spikes, Larcen crawls across the top of the screen then drops his foe. SWINGING HAMMER FISTS: This dazes and confuses opponents, as well as inflicting severe damage if unblocked. 64 "

All the presentational bits, like the Battle Room, are fab, the graphics are spot on and ace sounds help create the perfect atmosphere. But what this has got where others fail is speed and rock hard difficulty settings, so you really need skill not just blind button-bashing.

This follow-up has dispersed with the strategy and settled on the routes of arcade action. Equinox 29193 Like Sony's Equinox, the game is played over a huge map, allowing you to start from a number of destinations. Once you complete a few you get access to others, and so it goes.

ActRaiser is nifty in the air. Good for passing dangers. 1P-DDDD de OSR8006 VERDICT ActRaiser 2 does a fine job at pretending to be a coin-op. Pounding action and arty graphics make this challenge one that you've got to complete. Although the flying addition is fiddly, it soon becomes a real asset giving the game that edge of combat creativeness. Unfortunately, the special powers are never practical because you have to charge them up each time. There's also a fair bit of slow down, but nothing distracting. Fans of the original may not like the lack of strategic depth, but it hasn't disappointed me.

"SNES VERDICT SUPER amicom HON -> SUPER NINTENDE ActRaiser 2 has played it safe and dropped the strategy elements of the original for a pure arcade challenge. Luckily it's worked, offering an indulging game. It's very big and you can kick-off from different levels to create your own path, while being charmed by the moody graphics and dramatic soundtrack. There's a welcome blend of combat stages and relaxed platform romps, which equal variety, but I'm not convinced that the easy bosses add anything to the format other than decoration and tradition.

SUBIVAR 2050 ubmarine sims don't have a rep utation for being the most exciting games in the world. They usually involve sitting at the bottom of the ocean, a few echoing sonar pings and a lot of complicated torpedo angles. Doesn't exactly fire the imagination does it? But it doesn't have to be this way, because MicroProse has just released Subwar 2050, a submarine The thermal grids are important tactically. A green grid indicates colder water while a red indicates a warmer layer. As a freelance sub pilot you are based aboard a huge mothership like this one crawling along in the distance. combat simulator that boasts excite ment, action and lots of portholes. The attention to detail in Subwar is amazing. Texture-mapping, Gouraud-shading, even bubbles rise off the hull when you turn. SOME SOUND ADVICE R: TORBA 108 TOTAL LOND Rockets Torpedo 10 20,000 leagues under the sea Have you seen that SeaQuest DSV show on Sundays? The one with Roy Scheider and a talking Dolphin? Well SubWar looks and feels a bit like this. The year is 2050 and as mineral resources become scarce, the huge mining corporations have started to scour the ocean floor for riches. Nothing will stop them from getting what they want. If another corporation gets in the way, war breaks out and fighter subs duel to the Underwater battles are a big feature of Subwar. Well, you've got to have something to do between waypoints Success in Subwar is all about trying to be as quiet as you possibly can. You see the faster you go and the more violent and exaggerated your twists and turns, the more noise you make and the more visible you become to sonar. So it's often better to sit and wait than to go charging loudly' into battle. If the enemy see you before you see them, the chances are you'll probably be dead within minutes, your expen sive sub ending up as expensive scrap metal on the ocean floor. Decou The arming screen allows you to, er, arm your sub.

"VERDICT At last a submarine sim that isn't boring. Subwar 2050 has rekindled my enthusiasm for underwater conflict. It looks simply superb and there is really nothing like it around. Strange this, since Subwar itself is such a simple concept: take a bit of Wing Commander, a bit of flight sim and dunk them all in the ocean. Eh voilà, Subwar 2050. It isn't an easy game by any means, but once you get the hang of the laws of the ocean (thermals, sonar etc) you're rewarded with some engaging gameplay. I love it. USING YOUR THERMALS Thermal layers (represented on the screen by red and green grids) are the boundaries between sunlight-heated surface water and the cooler deep water. This isn't just interesting science, though, because it makes for interesting gameplay since sonar cannot penetrate a thermal layer. So, if you position your sub so that there is one of these layers between you and the enemy, neither sub can see the other. Thermals are also useful for dodging homing torpedoes. Simply nip into cooler water and the torps on-board sonar radar is confused and will lose the lock. Good use of the thermals could very well save your life. No kidding. PROS: Deep gameplay and graphics to dive for. CONS: You need a fast machine to appreciate it, and it's not an easy game to play. PAUL RAND GRAPHICS Texture-mapping, light-sourcing and Gouraud shading is probably in there somewhere. ANNOS The only sounds are the thrum of your engines and the whoosh of the torpedoes. GAMEPLAY Like a flight sim it's mission based. There's only four campaigns, but god they're hard. The sea isn't completely empty either, there is some life swimming around like whales, squid and sharks. Submariners are very fashion conscious. Today's pilot is wear ing an all-enclosing body suit and Gaultier oxygen tanks. It's a dangerous look, a look for the 2050s. It's a very difficult game and it's unlike any submarine game you've played before. death beneath the murky ocean waves. So where do you come in? Well you are a freelance submarine pilot, hired by one of the big corpo rations to do its industrial dirty work like destroying mining vehicles, contaminating fish stocks and dramatically rescuing stranded scientists. In fact, SubWar 2050 is almost like a flight sim under the sea, with a variety of offensive and defensive missions spread over four increasingly difficult campaigns. are brilliant, with a wealth of outside views. Your sub almost oozes through the dark water, spotlights bright in the gloom. Bubbles boil off the texture-mapped hull, while the sea ebbs and flows above you. It's glorious stuff. Almost poetic. Subwar takes a refreshing new look at the crusty old submarine game, adding a whole new dimension of action-adventure that, because of the very nature of a sub, STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES has never been implemented before. So out go the periscopes the ballast tanks and the depth charges, this time around the subs are more like fighter jets and what a tremendous difference it makes. At last a sub game with a bit of excitement. About time. MONWOO 111lllllllll Davy Jones VERDICT But it's the look and feel of SubWar that sets it apart from the usual combat sim. The underwater sequences MISS OK HIT! Subwar 2050 looks stunning with its muddy waters, texture-mapped subs and frantic gameplay. It's a welcome change from games like Silent Service and the forthcoming Aces of the Deep and SSN-21 Seawolt, hard-edged sub sims in the old tradition. Not so with Subwar though, which reminds me more of Wing Commander than anything else I've seen. Sadly if you haven't got a fast 486 the graphics will only chug along, but if you have a monster machine you're in for a visual feast. Oh and the gameplay isn't bad either. RIK SKEWS 69 "

What this game relies on, though, is gameplay, so bear with the dull presentation and an enjoyable platform game will shine through.

The problem is however, that it tends to become terribly tedious before it becomes compelling and that is due partly to the naff controls, but more so because the different teams fail to have any noticeable character in their play.

Edward Carnby returns to fight the 4 legions of dead. 5 In a house full of pirates once again he's... alone in the dark REVIEW SALONE IN THE DARK 2 he original Alone in the Dark was an absolute classic. Influenced by the weird stories of Love craft's Cthulhu mythos, Alone in the Dark took the original notion of the graphic adventure and chucked it out of the window. With quick-drawing polygon graphics, quirky camera angles, an eerie soundtrack and an unparalleled sense of atmosphere, you found yourself trapped in a haunted house, plagued by the forces of darkness and dogged by unspeakable wickedness. All you had to do was escape... HELL'S KITCHEN : CALIFORNIA and kill (but not necessarily in that order). It's 1921 and you have unearthed a terrible secret. A group of pirates have made a sinister pact with a voodoo priestess, promising to sacrifice a young girl every Christmas in return for extended life. As if that wasn't bad enough, your detective buddy Ted Striker has disappeared while investigating the disappearance of a young girl called Grace. He was last seen entering \"Hell's Kitchen', an old Californian, mansion perched dramatically on the edge of a clifftop. Lightning flashes, thunder booms and dirty clouds boil in the darkening sky. This is OneEyed Jack's place and you've got to wander in, shoot everyone, save Grace and escape without a scratch. Hey, no problem right? Home alone In Alone 2 Edward Carnby returns to do what he does best, namely sleuth The eerie pirate mansion of One-Eyed Jack sits atop this rather tall cliff, and don't those clouds look spooky? The pirates have made an evil pact with the voodoo priestess here. Beauty isn't her strong point. VERDICT This is Grace, the girl you must rescue. Cute kid. DETAILS The attention to detail in Alone 2 is stunning. Apart from the superb animation of the rough-edged polygon hero and the splendour of the static backdrops, the game is packed to the brim with detail. Drink grog and Carnby staggers around in a drunken haze with little control over his legs; watch the pirates shoot and reload, pump shotguns and change machine gun clips. They speak too. \"Hey you,\" shout the guards in the maze, \"Hi guy\" intones the chef and the nastier pirates laugh evilly as they pump you full of lead. I loved Alone in the Dark. I loved it so much that I would have wined it, dined it and married it without a moment's hesitation. Hence why I was, understandably, more than a little excited about Alone 2, and I must say I haven't been disappointed. The graphics are stunning and the atmosphere is still unequalled. One of the criticisms levelled at the original was that it was too easy, but you can't accuse Alone 2 of being a breeze. This game is so hard it's often unfair. One pirate is no problem but seven? All at once? Wow! RIK SKEWS 72 "


"VERDICT The prequel to this was one of the best 3D games ever on the PC. This sequel is now THE best 3D game on the PC. It's faster, there's more happening on screen simultaneously, and the game is thankfully far harder.

A racing game's a racing game, and they all have much the same features right? Normally yes, but Lotus 2: RECS is slightly different to the rest as I'll explain later.

I realise part of the licence was not to have any car damage, however this makes for an unrealistic and weird playing style with the car bouncing all over the shop. The RECS (the course constructor) is a great idea, but despite much tinkering most of the tracks I've created all handle the same. Leave this in the showroom and check out Domark's F1 instead (reviewed page 91). O-NWAGOO IIIIIIIII The course constructor (RECS) enables the tracks to be altered by moving these sliders around. They control parameters like number of hills and how steep the roads are. The more red in the bar the more of that particular parameter has been selected.

BANGET MIRIIN Is Virgin's new fantasy adventure a magical treat or just an illusion? rom the makers of The Legend of Kyrandia, Virgin's Young Merlin unfolds a similar tale of magic and fantasy adventure and much as its name suggests, Young Merlin is about the adventures and exploits of the young magician as he learns his magic skills and spell casting. Behind this is a deeper plot which places Merlin in a land that is being destroyed by a nasty shadow king who desires the place as his own. With this at hand, you must perform a sequence of tasks which gradually allow you to progress en route to the King's cave and the final thrashing. Our clean-shaven Merlin must find gems, and other magical objects which will only work at the right The fairy tells you what to do. Each time you touch the lake it will do the same. The water effect in this bit is superbly animated, but how will Young Merlin get across to the other side?

These disappear as the scrolling graphics reveal more complex puzzles. The gem from behind the free will give you a magic spell to get past these deadly plants. 78 "


"VERDICT Inside the mine, Merlin can use a board to skate around on, providing he can find it first. SNES Nintendo SUPER Famicom Young Merlin's graphics are impressive for the Nintendo, and the sound and speech are atmospheric too. It's the gameplay that has been neglected though, as it tries to suit everyone but ends up pleasing no-one. Older players will feel patronised by its easiness and unsubtle clues, while younger players will be bored by its lack of action. It's not bad by any means and if you persevere a large challenge will present itself, but considering the pedigree of Westwood (Legend of Kyrandia on PC) it's a disappointment. PROS: Great graphics and lasting gameplay. CONS: Older players will find it patronising and younger ones it lacking in action RIK SKEWS place and time to outwit the king's spells. The game's 10 lavish terrains are multi-scrolling and when they move no further this indicates that a puzzle needs to be solved. In this way, the game forces you to complete set puzzles before deeper exploration is permitted. adventures, you never really interact with other characters. There isn't the talk, use, take icons for example, which leaves you with the shallow tactic of stuffing your inventory with objects and trying them all out at each puzzle point in the game. You will be able to solve most puzzles quite logically though. Young Merlin is clearly a beginner's adventure game, which is thankfully big enough to give it lastability and variety GRAPHICS Smooth, fluid and incredibly detailed backgrounds. Kids play ONNOS Silly, sassy sounds that evolve with the game. The puzzles you encounter have a rather erratic difficulty curve, since the game starts off with Merlin displaying thought bubbles to show you what to do next, but these soon disappear and all you're left with is experimentation tactics. Most puzzles are logical, which is just as well as there are few clues. Unlike other Young Merlin can use spells to blast the baddies, but a combination of a 'stun' spell and shooting prevents them hitting back. GAMEPLAY Too easy to begin with and eventually becomes more difficult. VERDICT VALUE Has a wide appeal but may be too juvenile for some. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES One of Merlin's spells will elevate him momentarily to avoid enemy fire and ground dangers. The clues in this adventure game are a bit too helpful to begin with; however, it soon becomes an action-heavy game with puzzles placed to form barriers between new lands. As such, you can only progress by doing the puzzles, and hey, that makes it an adventure. Young Merlin is a very playable challenge, and as a 16 Mb game it has plenty of lovely graphics as well as silly sounds to captivate your attention and reward your perseverance; that's its strength, and despite a lack of humour it does have an appeal.

You pilot a rescue helicopter, and it's your job to sneak behind enemy lines and rescue the unfortunate POWs left behind after a massive conflict. This is no Rambo mission either, where the enemy is a sitting target, ar is bad. People get killed, it costs a fortune and someone always gets left behind.

The aim is to get your lads out of the danger zone and transport them back to the friendly base, where they can shower, shave, stick on a clean pair of togs and go home. But it's not quite that easy. 120 You've got to hover over the hut and blast it until it explodes, freeing the POWs whom you must pick up by landing near the wreckage.

"SNES VERDICT GE00 SUPER Famicom intendo 1993 was the year of the beat-'em-up. If Choplifter 3 is anything to go by, 1994 could be the year of the shoot-'em-up. The gameplay has barely changed, but that's good because the original is one of the most addictive blasts ever, but now there's some powerful weapons to collect and very dangerous end-level bosses to combat. The levels start easy, but quickly become very difficult you've really got to concentrate on staying alive. To coin a phrase from a wellknown advert, Choplifter 3 is as fresh today as it's always been SOAP PROS: Generally excellent shoot-'em-up action, highly addictive, CONS: Sad people might say the idea's getting on a bit.

Uncle SAM Not all the enemy are on foot, either.

Such speed however, is achieved at the expense of detailed graphics which can make it all seem quite dull. There's in fact very little variety in the challenge offered by different tracks, and with limited control of your car's parts this certainly isn't a simulation.

You can keep your video games as soon as I step into an arcade I head straight for the pinball machine and start tilting that table for all its worth self you can change the angle of tilt on the table, and you also have the choice of playing with either three balls or five. All the usual features, such as ramps, ball traps and targets, are there, though these vary from table to table. There's even a multiball feature (something that's lacking from most other computer pinball games), which makes the play even more frantic than usual because silver balls come at you every which way.

Well, not quite it's just an old contender with a memory implant. reatest Heavyweights is basically the same as Evander Holyfield's 'Real Deal Boxing, The year-old game has been pumped up to 16 megs though double the size of the original, with the extra capacity being used to speed up the gameplay and add some world champions to the list of boxers, including Muhammad Ali, Rocky Marciano and Mr Holyfield himself.

The new version of the game benefits from the 16-meg treatment with much faster gameplay, beefed-up sound and some really neat samples, as well as the great heavyweight champions boosting the roster of boxers on offer. But it still doesn't give you the real right there in the ring' feel you get from Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, which I would personally recommend if you want a good battle.

There's also this old granny, who just wonders around aimlessly and to protect her from coming to harm you need to guide her around the platforms, avoiding the dangers at every stage. She only walks in a straight line so in order to make her jump (because the exit is at the top) you need to boot her up the backside. negotiate it all with the granny.

This is frustrating enough in itself, but just imagine when you get up to higher platforms and then she drops right down to ground level because your timing is a bit off.

Here some electric fish jump out randomly and hit her. This looks and feels like a bad Amiga game. The graphics are plain and repetitive and there's a lack of imagination in the structure of the platforms. What makes it so bad however, is the frustration caused by trying to control two characters at once (like Sleepwalker). This makes it hard to play and isn't helped by the sluggish sprite detection.

CVG forced itself to take an afternoon off work and raced down to the new arcades on display at the Novotel in Hammersmith, London to see what's new in 1994... 150 f you can't beat 'em, don't try When someone is beaten the screens slowly spins and shows an all-angles replay. Tasty! and copy 'em,' appears to be Sega's response to producing an alternative beat-'em-up to the Streetfighter Il coin-op. And Virtua Fighter, with a price tag of around ,000 is an alternative to SFII. TO say the graphics are brilliant is an insult. They are brilliantly brilliant 64bit and they animate very, very fluidly. The perspective changes often, moving above and zooming in and out to capture all the action. Gameplay revolves around taking control of one player from a choice of eight, each with its own set of moves. The action takes takes place over either two or three bouts depending on personal preference. To beat an opponent Wolf gets into a manly wrestle with Jeffry. 100 Kage is stunned by how good he looks on a 50 inch monitor. "


"CHARACTER PROFILES KAGE Full name: Kagemaru Nationality: Japanese Kage's specialty is jujitsu. He's on a fighting tour throughout the world in order to annihilate the evil Syndicate that took his mother away and also killed his ninja father. JEFFRY Full name: Jeffry McWild Nationality: Australian A fisherman whose boat was destroyed by a man-eating shark, Jeffry is practising his technique in order to get revenge on the shark. Entering tournaments is also helping him to pay for his shipbuilding expenses. JACKY Full name: Jacky Bryant Nationality: American Jacky's recovering from an injury and uses his fighting skills to aid him in the investigation into the mysterious car race accident in which he was involved. Full name: Lau Chan Nationality: Chinese Lau is said to be the world's best chef as well as the world's best fighter. He is promoting Chinese 'Kempo' which he believes to be the ultimate fighting art. PAI Full Name: Pai Chan Nationality: Hong Kong An action star in Hong Kong, Pai hates her father who's been in pursuit of his own ideals at the expense of his family, so she's challenged him to a fight. SARAH Full name: Sarah Bryant Nationality: American While investigating the car accident in which her brother was injured, Sarah was captured, hypnotised and trained by the Syndicate in its bid to try and get her to kill Jacky. WOLF Full name: Wolf Hawkfield Nationality: Canadian An Indian descendant, Wolf is a woodcutter turned pro-wrestler who has Herculean strength. Boasts he has never been beaten since his debut. AKIRA Full name: Akira Yuki Nationality: Japanese The only person to whom the ultimate martial art 'Hakkyokuken' is handed down, Akira is fighting his way around the world to test his skills. VERDICT GRAPHICS QU either pummel them to pulp or knock them out of the ring to force a 'ringout.' When one of the characters is knocked down you are treated to a smack-in-the-mouth vision replay reminiscent of the replay on Hard Drivin'. Bit of a gimmick but it looks great. SOUND 78 In our opinion Virtua Fighter doesn't have the long lasting appeal of Streetfighter 2. Virtua Fighter is stunning to look at, however, there's no long lasting gameplay here. I mean I could be wrong, but I played this game for over an hour and couldn't find any special moves to tempt me away from Streetfighter II. Also the controls don't feel very responsive, which can be irritating when playing against the computer. Apart from this the game also suffers from the infamous leq-sweep syndrome in that the same move (hit the punch and kick button at the same time cheat fans!) will dispense of enemies far too quickly, which means you don't get value for money. Sega should be praised for pushing back the boundaries of arcade games, as it did with the R-360, but that game was all look and no gameplay and sadly this is much the same. mm 110 mm GAMEPLAY 70 OVERALL DE RIK SKEWS 101 "

"SNES Just one of the many guardians in the game. This one may be big, but it only takes one fully charged shot to kill him. by KONAMI EVIEW TBA MARCH RELEASE Stage of Development 99% Complete Keeping your finger on jump will charge up enough power to launch into flight in any direction. Any baddies in your path get destroyed. Konami's latest platform TWINBEE game is far too cute. Could it be time to RAINBOW BELLADVENTURE dump your teddy? ho can forget Konami's child ishly cute shoot-'em-up, Pop 'n' Twinbee? Some of you may also recall Parodius, another cutesy Konami blastup. So what eh? Well, the primary star of both of these games has now gone solo. Yep, Twinbee has his very own game and this time he's entered the domain of platform action. Twinbee's adventure involves him jumping, flying, running, One feature of the game is an additional battle mode where the screen splits and both players have to try and smash the nuts out of each other, though what point this serves is not clear. What else? Speed seems to be good with some hi-speed ramp runs. The bosses are also quite original (if a little easy), and you get plenty of levels, on the whole this game is looking pretty good. In battle mode both players have to locate each other and bash the other up. ODAMISEE for punching and blasting all manner of baddies in his search for bells on the way to an exit for each stage. Apart from the ones you collect, bells may also be dropped when baddies are destroyed, with different colour bells providing various power-up options (as in Pop 'n' Twinbee). which you get the choice of two other Twinbee look-a-likes. Teamwork is very important, for if one character goes off the screen the other player can still move blindly (very odd), and you can switch control by hitting 'select'. DEEZO Pd Little fluffy clouds Keeping your finger on the punch button will charge up sufficient power to demolish objects in your path. The game seems more of a simultaneous two-player effort however, You can smash through the scenery to create your own paths and discover new bells. 111 "

"PC PC by GREMLIN .95 PREVIEW OUT NOW As you might imagine, Mutt doesn't want to wake this feller up he's bad enough when he snores! Stage of Development 100% Complete Gremlin's devillish dude might have taken a while to appear, but he's about to make one hell of an entrance... iti Sivil Battle with the guardian to enter the game. Now you'd have to be a bit of a nutter to want to go through that door! the later, more demanding stages of the game. Still waiting Every time you take a step, part of the platform changes on this level so be careful. hey managed it with a ninja ant from the Nth Dimension, now Gremlin hopes to make a star out of an apprentice devil with an eye for pizza! Mutt is his name, and he's the «lucky' feller who's been volunteered to enter The Labyrinth for the annual search for pizza! What devils are doing scoffing pizza is beyond us, but that's the story and Gremlin seems to be sticking to it. Anyway, the game is essentially a maze affair, picked out in glorious second-person perspective 3D, with you controlling Mutt, guiding him to the special rooms on each of the five sprawling stages. It's in these special rooms where all the real action is hidden in, as they contain arcade-style puzzle games which Mutt has to complete in order to receive the keys that will take him to We've been waiting for Litil Divil for, ooh, forever, and it doesn't look as though it's going to disappoint. As you can see from these shots, the graphics are gorgeous the 3D sections scroll smoothly, and there's all manner of enemies to overcome. And while the maze game itself could get dull, the whole package is given that bit extra thanks to the various subgames which include sumo wrestling bouts, leaps over sinking stepping stones and walks over disappearing platforms, all picked out in fine isometric 3D. Litil Divil's a bit of a treat check it out. Save the mermaid from the piranhas of doom! Not only do the stepping stones sink, but a big slimy monster rises up to grab you, too. 113 "


"MEGA DRIVE by VIRGIN TBA PREVIEW Dragon is quite unique because it will allow you to fight two opponents at once. This sounds mighty fab' to us. JULY QORO Q000 202 Stage of Development 30% Complete As you progress you will actually improve your moves automatically, with smoother more effective attack combinations. Bruce devoted his life, and died in the quest for, physical perfection. Can Virgin keep his spirit alive in this huge 30 meg game? This chap is the dude who's said to have haunted Lee's mind. frames and sprites that are on screen at once, not to mention layers of parallax scrolling One final note for music fans, the sound effects and music are being composed by Allister Brinble of Team 17 fame, and that's just one other reason why CVG can't wait for this game. ruce Lee's unexplained death at the age of 32 still remains somewhat of a mystery. Accord(c)1993 VIRGIN INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT (EUROPE) LTD. ing to his widow, he was Here are some of the Brucie sprites, apparently he has a actually killed by super natural forces. This and massive 36 combat moves. other Brucie experiences were recently covered in the recent biopic, Dragon. If you've seen the film and thought that it was a bit too loveydovey for you worry not, because Virgin is releasing the official game which will return to what Bruce was all about fighting! All the characters you face will have intelligence levels. this beat-'em-up is that you fight two opponents at once, which appears to work brilliantly. There's going to be 36 fighting moves to learn, and Bruce's tutor, Yip Man, will help you out. We've also been promised that as you progress the moves will be adapted to swifter techniques, which could give the game some unique depth. STICK LABY ( DIVINA TBC) The attention to detail on the sprites shows the care that's been taken with the game. Meanest In the game Dragon you'll find yourself challenging 12 opponents, including characters from the film and the Phantom, who is said to have killed him. What's impressive about Biggest Dragon is going to be the biggest ever beat-'em-up (we're told) and that's due to the masses of animation Here are a few sprites from one of the opponents. There are heaps in the game. 114 "

"MASTER SYSTEM/GAME GEAR by US GOLD Here you can choose the course you want to race on. .99 PREVIEW Watch out for police patrolling. Check your rear mirrors as often as you can. the last thing you want is a ticket for speeding. Not only does it hold you up, but it knocks off valuable dollars in your quest to buy the best bike. If you feel the need for speed then you'll have to wait until March for the release, but we'll be giving it a full service and MOT before then. MARCH SILVER (AND OTHER COLOURED) DREAM MACHINES Stage of Development 100% Complete old on to your helmet! That crazy biker with a passion for punching and kicking other drivers off the road has now been let loose on the Master System and Game Gear in Road Rash. The game is more or less an identical conversion from the Mega Drive, spread over five tracks including Grass Valley, Redwood Forest, Sierra Nevada and Palm Desert. Basically the idea is to race against 15 other bikers in the fight, literally, to win enormous amounts of prize money and gain a top-of-therange motorbike. You may be born to be wild, but have you got the readies? Roadfighter Road Rash has been acclaimed as a Streetfighter-style game and although you do kick, punch and ram other drivers, the violence is not as graphic. To win prize money you have to finish the race in one of the top four positions. A race can be repeated as many times as you want, until you reach the desired position, but this could get tedious, since races later on in the game are 22 miles long. Road Rash is an easy game to get into, although if you get too cocky after a few miles you'll find policemen lurking round the corner, and It's been on the circuit a while but now it's set to accelerate to the top on Master System and Game Gear. It's spreading like... well, a rash SHURIKEN 400. You start on this bike, so the top speed is only a 60hp (that's horse power). PANDO 600 A good allround sports bike with light steering up to 90hp. BANSAI 750. Bikes star to get more expensive at $7,000. KAMIKAZE Slow steering and a top speed of 105hp. Has an $8,000 price tag. SHURIKEN 1000 Plan your turns carefully on this one or you could skid out of control. FERRUCI 850 This bike costs $ 14,000 and it weighs in at a rather hefty 450lbs. PANDA 750 Zooms up to 120hp, magic handling but it costs a packet. DRANLO 1000 The ultimate mean machine with fuel injection and 150hp. It's a mere snippet at $25,000. Punch your opponents off the track. It's cheating, but it works. IT'S A GREAT DAY TO FACE CHALLENGE ON THE OPEN ROAD. BEST OF LUCK FRIEND! BIFF The Man in Black has got to deliver his box of Milk Tray, and woe betide anyone who gets in his way. Biff is one of the competitors, shame he's got a stupid name. "


"(EV00000  SNES by SONY IMAGESOFT TBA The password screen comes in very handy. It is actually possible (with luck) to make up a password that will work. PREVIEW EASTER RELEASE Stage of Development 100% Complete This is the first boss you encounter in the game. You can only destroy it by hitting the pot. poodle 100.000TO SKYBLAZER C Has Sony This flying sequence is typical of the variety element in the gameplay. Plays really well too. CEO0000 come up with the most varied, yet playable arcade game possible? espite having possibly one of the most dullest intro sequences for a long while, SkyBlazer looks like it's going to offer some of the best arcade action seen for ages on the SNES. However, accumulating these special weapons seems to be a major attraction of the game since some are truly spectacular, and many of the better ones even turn you into a Fiery Phoenix or summon bolts of lightning. What looks like making SkyBlazer particularly good though, is the huge variety of challenges in it. They all follow the same theme of bashing things, but the action is different in each of the 21 stages. Expect to find climbing, flying, swimming and other physical elements to contend with. At the end of the game you'll also encounter not just one boss, but a whole range of different ones, one after the other! SkyBlazer looks as though it's going to be a very polished arcade game, with plenty of themed music and lots of imagination too. You've got to get the girl In this mystical adventure, you take control of the game's hero SkyBlazer. His mission? To free Arianna the Sorceress from the clutches of the evil Ashura. Rather than collecting your power-up weapons en route, SkyBlazer has to earn them by completing each stage of the game. Initially you will start off with little more than a W punch, kick and a special weapon. Sky Blazer has heaps of special weapons. This flash dash is very effective in a straight line. SkyBlazer's standard attack move is a chop 'n' kick. This can up be used against any baddie. The map allows you to progress back and forth between stages you've already been to but why? "

The grandmother of all shootem-ups gets a sequel to its sequel is R-Type III as good as the original? Why not take a look and decide for yourself! This large spaceship spins through 360 degrees it looks the business. you've played the previous R-Type games, you'll know that that's a lot. If you're new to the R-Type phenomenon, however, here's a quick rundown. You control the R-9, a small yet highly manoeuvreable ship which starts with only basic weaponry, but can be fitted out with some incredible kit as you travel JEST PLEASE BUIC LOUISA.eus TROD MODELE 'he Bydo Empire is back! Irem's classic coin-op and console game R-Type is soon to make a welcome return to SNES screens in the third of the trilogy! R-Type III once again has you controlling the powerful R-9 fighter against all that the boys from Bydo can throw at you and if There are three different types of force pod available in R-Type 3 make your choice at the start. If you've ever played R-Type (and who hasn't?) you'll know that there are loads of weapons to collect. 118 "


"This time round, you can power up your force pod blast by a stupid amount. The end-of-level baddy on stage one is captured in all its Mode 7 glory. A rip-roaring time is in store for anyone who gets their hands on R-Type III full review coming soon. You might think this section looks rather dull, but when playing you'll soon change your tune! through the game. Shooting special enemy drones releases pods which, when picked up, give you all manner of goodies, such as missiles, threeway shots, speed-ups and, probably the most important item in the game, a pod which can attach itself to either the front or back of your ship and not only emit powerful blasts of energy, but also shield your R-9 from enemy fire. ment of weird and deadly alien creatures, but also a massive boss at the end which requires you to hurl everything you've got at it in order to move on. It sounds simple, but believe us, it isn't not by a long way. The Bydo baddies swarm on to the screen at a ridiculous rate in wave after wave, and just when you think you've got past a particularly tricky section of a level, the screen rotates and starts to scroll vertically! Just like in the original, you can detach your force pod from the front of your ship and use it as a free moving weapon or even attach it to your behind as a shield from back baddies! Six of the best R-Type III or, to give the game its full title, R-Type III: The Third Lightning contains six levels, with each stage, harbouring not only a wild assortI remember The SNES hasn't seen a proper shoot-'em-up for some time now, and who better to get the ball rolling again than the company which kicked off the genre as we know it today? R-Type was the game which gave us end-of-level bosses and bolt-on weapons, and from the not-inconsiderable play which we've had off the 'hot-from-Japan cartridge, it looks as though Irem has lost none of its knack at releasing quality blasters. O Now here's a blast you've never seen before! R-Type III has been suitably spruced... If you think this portion of the level looks tough, you ain't seen nothing yet! All six levels are incredibly tough, although the bosses could be better... R-Type III isn't so much a new game, more like a follow-on from the brilliant original. The levels are similar, and they play similarly excellently! All your favourite weapons are in the game, as well as a few new ones! 119 "

In fact it's going to be a Zelda-type RPG with lots of puzzles. The plot of the film will probably be followed quite closely, but so far we've only seen the first stage of the game, which has Fester wobbling around the garden in search of the exit. The play area is a scrolling maze and within it Fester has to deal with typical spooky enemies like ghosts and demented killer bats. Fortunately his large body deposits of fat make him quite a durable chap and he can hanWherever she goes, Morticia always has a spotlight in her face. let's hope the game doesn't turn out to be a pale-face imitation.

This first stage involves Fester dashing round a maze in search of an exit. There are spooky bats and ghouls to blast and items to collect. It's looking good. probably have to collect all the items, so we're expecting a puzzle based in the main, with maze and blasting elements wacked on top.

Look out for more on this one soon. dle a fair number of attacks. He can also protect himself by shooting a puffy substance from his finger tip and this can be replaced by a number of other weapons.

MARCH RELEASE Stage of Development 45% Complete The animation is very realistic. It uses real people digitised in motion to give the desired effect. Scrolling's a bit shabby though. The fun aspect is in bashing opponent racers to the ground. You can use different weapons. From the makers of Road Rash comes a very similar game, except instead of a motorbike you ride roller skates! et in 12 major cities across the United States, Skitchen is all about roller skate racing, and fighting off all the rival skating gangs so that you manage to make it into one of the top four positions necessary for progression to the next city. By moving up behind a car you can grab hold to accelerate ahead. there's a special bonus for hitchin' a ride on a police car. All the sprites in Skitchin have been rotoscoped off real people, so the animation is expected to be realistic (although what we've seen looks a bit rough). Skitchen will also feature a customary split-screen option for two players, and hopefully the finished version isn't going to slow down as much as the version we've been playing. Plenty of pushin' and a shovin' There are no rules on the road, so you can punch, kick and elbow onents as much as you like to get them out of your path; then you have to grab hold of a passing vehicle and whiz ahead of the pack. The game will also feature nine weapons like chains, nunchukas and metal bars, and you will even be able to perform tricks off ramps to earn money at the end of a race for being flash. Any cash accumulated can be used to purchase faster skates and extra equipment like pads and gloves, and Road Rash's little bruv There are 16 different music tracks to choose from, and on the whole, this 16 meg game looks like being fun, even though it does play incredibly like Road Rash!

DOD-0-0-0-0-ey ZOOM Dear YOB, I've written countless letters to you that haven't got printed so I'm desperately hoping this one will be interesting enough for you to print. I have an Atari STe and I'm seriously considering buying something new. I don't want a Super Nintendo or a Mega Drive as many of my friends have them and I don't think much of them. I am looking for something new, such as a Jaguar, but would like to know whether to keep my ST in case I can play my games on the Jaguar. My other choices are the 3DO as it looks impressive and comes from a good background ie the man behind it is the former President of EA. My final choice is to wait until (at the earliest) 1995 for the Nintendo 64-bit Silicon. I've looked through issue 145 and it has helped me a lot in comparing the consoles. Thanks for looking at my letter. ter I've yet received, I'll give you a rundown on all the new machines because at least you gave me a good laugh. For a start, don't keep your ST. Find somebody sad enough to flog it to for the maximum amount of cash you can stiff them for because the smelly old dinosaur is not worth a light. Second, in my opinion you might as well forget about the 3DO as well. Sure, the machine's got some impressive technical specifications, but these have already been surpassed by the Jaguar. So, should you buy the Jaguar? Now there's a good question. Technically, there's every reason why you should it's got devastating potential and currently puts all other consoles in the shade. However, Atari has a bit of a reputation for spanging things up (just look up the ST in the Where Are They Now file) and there's no guarantee that the machine will take off. If you want my advice, hang on to your cash and wait to see what happens. Right now some of the wiser people I know are buying Amiga 1200s because they know there's a CD-ROM attachment on the way, which effectively turns the machine into a CD32 and remains one of the best home computers money can buy. What do the rest of you think? Drop me a line and I may even print a few. ANDI HEAD Birmingham YOB: Well, I looked at it and I laughed at it.

"mation or paint package and use it for word processing, so a computer has many more uses than a console. I don't dislike consoles, despite all that I've said. It's just that I'm sick of people putting computers down. MARK HAYES Sheffield FUNNY FEET Dear YOB, I'm writing to agree with the letter you printed in issue 145 about consoles and home computers written by Philip Owen in Surrey. How can consoles even be compared to a computer? Take flight sims as an example. On computers flight sims are very good, with lots of different key combinations, and it's a challenge just keeping the plane up in the air. On consoles all you have to do is change speed and direct your plane towards the targets, fire at them and that's it. Consoles do bring out some good games, but compared with computers console games still don't match up. Take the recent conversions of Zool, Sensible Soccer and Silly Putty these don't have anything over the Amiga versions. When will the arrogant console owners see this? Then there's the price of games question. An adventure on the Amiga like It Came From The Desert II, Eye Of The Beholder or similar, would keep anyone going for ages. But console games aren't very deep and there's not much to do compared to computer versions. Plus with computers you can use an aniPS I don't give a cack if you don't print this letter as you know I'm right. PPS Keep up the good work, because your mag is excellent! PPPS Why are all the addresses so long? ty, is it? Certainly, computer games are more complex but which are the games you keep coming back to for months, even years? Console games like Mario etc. Why is this? Because their designers know that the most important element of any game is gameplay, so all the best console games concentrate on this area. CVG will always tell you the right ones to buy, so if you use some spark of intelligence you'll always pick the right carts. Sure there are crap games on consoles, but isn't there a massive dungheap of festering computer titles available as well far outnumbering cack console games. It seems to me that you're looking at the world through your grandad's gas mask and it's all become so steamed up with your ranting that you can't see your hand in front of your face. I'd recommend an immediate lie down, and make sure you don't get up again for, oh, at least 45 years. YOB: You may have a rather sad way of putting things, but you do actually have a point. Lately I've found myself playing more and more games on PC and Amiga because some of the releases like Elite II and Rebel Assault are nothing short of superb.

There was a plague and pestilence across the land, cities were flattened and the sound of a billion tormented souls filled the air.

"SAD  BLAG 003 SLOW FOR A SWEATY Dear YOB, I want that  and I want it NOW. T. AXMAN Inland Revenue Dear YOB, This is the very first time I've ever written to a mag. I'm fed up of all those sad letters from people who think they will win your most generous  prize for their letters, bragging about how their SNES is better than Mega Drive and so on. I've had this on my mind for so long and just felt like putting pen to paper about it. Anyway, every year a new and fantastic games machine is made from both Sega and Nintendo. Sega has just released the Mega-CD and is currently talking about the brilliant Saturn. Meanwhile, Nintendo has been working on making the SNES a rea contender to the Mega Drive, with brilliant graphics and all the new, exciting games coming out but will this carry on? Has Nintendo got a secret weapon up its corporate sleeves, something that will knock all Sega goodies with a big bang? Tell me, oh knowledgeable one YOB: Certainly. How would you like your money? (SHO NUFF\"> DAVID SIMPSON Turriff, Aberdeenshire YOB: News obviously doesn't travel well up the East Coast Line, otherwise you'd know that Nintendo has managed to join forces with Silicon Graphics to create a 64-bit super console, which should be available by 1995. TAY / F.A.B CLOCKWORK ORANGES Dear YOB, This is the ever first time that I've wrote to a magazine (from the looks of things it's the first time you've wrote at all YOB) and I'd like to write about the prices of games. All commercial and console games are far too expensive for the average gamer's budget. I'm sure everybody would agree that games are far too expensive, but they still spend up to  a time on a game. This is why computer software companies get away with selling them at this price. If nobody bought the games then the distributors would be forced to reduce the prices and more people could afford to buy them. Also, if people actually had the decency not to pirate games (and not rip the companies off so EVERY they can afford to lower their prices) and per( PIRATE SHOULD haps buy the games (after they have been low HAVE ONE! ered in price for the stated reason, then the companies could afford to lower their prices even further. My point is: (at last YOB) have patience. Wait. Do not buy the games when they first come out and they will go down in price and follow the law and do not pirate software. REYNOLDS IS POINTLESS: DISCUSS DANIEL MEAKINGS Stamford Dear YOB, I think CVG is totally crap... NOT! I have read your excellent mag for nearly a year now, and it is bloody brilliant so far. You might I think I'm a sad git, but I'm not More than a year ago, I wanted a SNES with Streetfighter 2. But I got really mad because I wasn't allowed to have it. It was because my diwy dad said it was too much money! No way is it! Anyone can afford it! But in the end I got a NES with Super Mario and Duck Hunt. Then a couple of weeks later, completed the games which were so easy. By now I have still got the same games which I'm bored with, and I haven't even touched my NES. My parents haven't bothered to just buy me some more decent games. I think the NES is all right, but the SNES is much better. This is so bad: I got the NES with two controllers, a light gun and two games for  and now it's gone right down to  Please can you put a picture of you slicing me to bits with a massive axe. Thanks. YOB: And then the princess kissed the frog and he turned into a handsome prince and everyone in the kingdom was happy again and the Tories got booted out of office and beer was made free and nobody had to get out of bed in the morning and people like Daniel Meakings were exported to the North Pole. I'm afraid the real world is like this: if nobody bought any games the software industry would stop producing them altogether and nobody would have anything to play. Much more sensible is what people like me just keep on telling you read CVG and we'll always tell you the best value for money games to buy. It's that simple, and yet some saddos still can't get the message. What's wrong with some people? ANT LEE REYNOLDS Bedfont, Middlesex ROOMS YOB: Remember kids; this is what happens when you don't pay attention in English lessons. 128 "


"SCREWBALLS Dear YOB, Please, please, please, can you answer these questions for me? 1. Is the Lynx handheld better than the Game Gear? 2. People say the Mega Drive is 16bit. What is 'a bit'? 3. Will Streetfighter Il come out on either the Lynx or Game Gear? 4. What's your favourite console? 5. What's your favourite handheld? 6. What's the best game out for the Game Gear? 7. What's the best game out for the FUNNY FACES Dear YOB, My dad was ranting on the other day about how he doesn't think you're in the least bit funny, and he never laughs when I show him the pictures, in fact he thinks they're boring. He says I just waste my money by buying the mag, so please do something funny in a picture or say something that will make him laugh, and then he'll probably change his mind and let me buy CVG, otherwise I'll just have to spend ages in WH Smith reading it. Lynx? OLIVER BAKER Cardiff YOB:1. Is a Ferrari better than a fart? 2. It depends entirely where you are and whether anyone is willing to give you one. 3. Will Cardiff ever be exciting? 4. It's a toss up between the Super NES and the Turbo Duo. 5. PC Engine GT. 6. Believe it or not, Sonic 1. 7. Klax. MICHAEL CLAYTON DOESNT MAKE Worcester ME LAUGH... YOB: Michael, your sad dad is obviously beyond all help and there's no reason why you or the rest of your family should suffer him any longer. It's time to get rid of him, or at least trade him in for someone worthwhile. Yes he needs to go, along with those tacky slippers he wears and those boring old fishing mags he spends his time poring over. Have a quiet word with your mum I already have and she feels the same way, and has done for some time now, apparently. It more or less comes down to a straight choice: CVG every month or your sad and useless father forever. If you ask me it's no contest. Kill him. Now.
