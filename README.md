You can find issues of video game magazines at http://archive.org or http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/ among many places. Most of the time, these scans come with no text or really badly digitised text (archive.org used ABBYY FineReader 8 and it wasn't great). Here are better quality versions of these texts. Note that they are still far from perfect (except in the case of CGW 1-100).

## CGW (1-100)

Text corrected by the [Computer Gaming World Museum](http://cgwmuseum.org/).

Use their [index](http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=0&pub=0&id=500) to navigate through these magazines.

## Tilt (1-122), Joystick (1-99), CGW (101-185) and CVG (1-200)

OCR with Google Vision API. No further correction. They have a lot of mistakes (but less than with 10 years old OCR technology).
